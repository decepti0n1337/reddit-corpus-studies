And in today's 24hour live broadcast, we continue our full, all day coverage of the song "bringing sexy back".  Sung by two drunks with a chicken.
---
---
---
I even wrote a song parody ‚ÄúWatoga Death Aura‚Äù (sung to Carpenters ‚ÄúClose to You‚Äù)
---

---
Why does death suddenly appear
---
Every time you are near?
---
Sunny skies, body count rise
---
Close to you
---
Why do birds fall down from the sky
---
Every time you walk by?
---
Just appears, they too should fear (being)
---
Emanating instant death, you decimate the city
---
As corpses litter everywhere you tread
---
Like they sprinkled poison everywhere and demons beat their wings to help it spread
---
That is why all the bots in town
---
Lay in heaps on the ground
---
Sugar and spice, Grim Reaper‚Äôs scythe
---
ants are designed to have a queen in fallout ( new vegas example ) besides more content... more fun IMO
---
Is there a guide to figuring out the code? Did you go in there with PA? Think I could survive solo without it?
---
That would be awesome. Find a magazine spot and check it every time. There's two in watoga around the shopping center in a shop and a bus.
---
I love the wastelad game like playing fallout within fallout. Idk if all of the games were available in fallout 4 but they're pretty neat 
---
You can join in-game. Just go to menu then social. For some reason the friends list from game is broken.  
---
I noticed this as well. Shady as hell.
---
&gt; Take this magic shit to Elder Scrolls.
---
So, you're saying you're not looking forward to the alien tech tiara's that let people shoot TSE Telekinetic blasts?
---
agree
---
oh god the fanart.
---
only ants ? or all 6 legs type creatures in game ?
---
So the Presidency Quest is a PVP event? great. because everyone just loves PVP events for exclusive items.
---
They grow up so fast
---
Two Dog !
---
 I'm looking to trade for one/buy one. I would pay good caps for the plan. \[PS4\]
---
ok i give you a point on that ... they are trully bullet suckers but... as a content woudnt be nice ?
---
My friend tamed a Deathclaw and when another player killed it, it respawned the next time he logged in. Later it died for an unknown reason and now he has the phantom ~30% of his budget taken up but the Deathclaw didn't respawn. It's been about a week and still not respawned nor has the budget gone down. He moved his base and rebuilt parts of it but nothing worked so far.
---
Epescially if I just want to hold off that little bit longer going to a vendor or stash box.
---
The was one for fallout 4 that was literally just the in game Pip-boy, but on you phone. I'm hoping the port it over to 76 at some point. 
---
I would trade/pay good caps for the plan \[PS4\]
---
Toxic Larry's Meat n Go, just above Berkley, spawns 3 snallygasters in front of the hut, they drop 12 to 18 acid total, respawn instantly on every server hop.
---
You would have to run a separate or split the circuit.  Off the generator put a switch inline to the insise circuit and one for the outside circuit and itll work just fine
---
I just started having this problem, too. Did you ever find a fix?
---
With all of those low levels down there it just adds damage resistance and they don't contribute in causing damage. Its caused me to break my dragon a few times and not be able to kill the sbq. I will admit its annoying. Just focus on getting to that place comfortably 
---
Humanoid NPC's will be added over time (well that's if the game survives long enough).
---
They weren't at launch because 76 is the first vault open.
---
Always amazed me why people crying out for human npc....they all die the same, they all end up with the same annoying text quest that lets be honest most people skip anyways! Bethesda and Fallout's main story has never been up there with Witcher type story telling or Red Dead so even if there were proper humans around they'd just me more mamma Murphys annoying the hell out of everyone!
---
I'm sure with the DLC's though it will progress the over seers story and once the other vaults open well start seeing npc settlements etc, especially if they do continue DLC's for the next few years. Hell were probably going to find out all Preston Garveys dad is actually from vault 96 in WV and hes going to be bitching about settlements needing our help soon enough (fo4 reskins is bethesda's thing it seems).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Just a feedback post here with a few ideas (some of which I'm guessing have already been said). Most of them are just random things that me and a few mates have just said whilst walking around Appalachia so it's understandable if they get shot down.
---
1) preset perk card loadouts for when you want to get a change done quickly. Just set it like a CAMP blueprint and switch it up on the fly (they'd all be reset if you swap a special point though).
---
2) add in the craftable fast travel waypoints from fallout 4 to stop people from spawning inside cliffs or into water where they get diseases.
---
3) either remove the text from the BOS combat armour mods that states it adds rad resistance OR fix it so it correctly provides the buff.
---
4) Make it so tamed creatures and robots at someone's  CAMP will reaspawn after a set time/ or can be "repaired" when killed by another player. They also shouldn't yield loot or xp when they are a tamed creature as well as giving the attacker a bounty (as they should count as a player's property like defensive turrets do).
---
5) perhaps create a new serum or service in-game that can only be purchased from the enclave vendor for a high-price and is unable to be crafted by players, which allows you to fully respect your SPECIAL points? This could be like the shrines in ESO and would make it easier for people to continue progression via levelling up and not needing 5 or 6 levels wasted just moving points around. (However this should NOT be a microtransaction as that would make it too easy for people to get. It should have a cost and difficulty akin to its value).
---
That's all we really came up with in terms of "good" ideas, but I'm sure at least one of them has already been suggested. Just thought it'd be worth a shot posting them here just in case one of them can be made into reality! 
---
Anyways my platform is Xbox 1 and my GT is: ThePancakeGod95.
---
Super Sledge
---
and if you want to see overly complicated wiring you need to see my maze on xb1 
---
Agreed
---
Omg hilarious.
---
You don‚Äôt need it calculated, you can guess if it will be cheaper. 
---
This would be such a waste of coding time and development. 
---
You probably have to attach them to a different power supply, though I'm no expert.
---
I remember the first time I looted one and trying to figure out why the ‚Äúminer suit breather‚Äù wasn‚Äôt a wearable gas mask 
---
You can fix a bug... You cannot fix a community haha
---
You can even use speakers as a mic, just have to be really loud. 
---
The marine wetsuit mask is in the game. It's called the marine helmet. I got it in the Glassed Caverns. 
---
I dump plans in the various containers at vendors. Sadly I haven't found anything myself 
---
Thank you! Now to hunt for a good one lol
---
Yeah, that vampire outfit with the cape is just no, no. 
---
Crashaskins and Smaskins - husband and wife - pacifist enabled - lvl 113 &amp; 91
---
Not like it was my first rodeo. I'm 150, with a pile of legendaries, who else should be there but end-game Players like me?
---
Sorry for the late response, but I'll sell you a level 50 TS Gatling Gun for 650 caps.
---
Ok thanks
---
I agree that the end game is not all there yet and that the ‚Äùdrop distribution‚Äù, server hopping for items/plans/mods needs a rework.
---
But, drops are not horrible. I play with lots of players who has been in the ‚Äùend game‚Äù for a long time and we all have more or less stacked gear for our builds by looting/sharing/trading. I admit that if I had only played solo and never shared/traded I would not have as much as I do now but that makes sense. I would still be able to have a Queen viable build many hours ago, by way of messuring end game strength.
---
Anyway, might catch you later in Appalachia if you pop back after more patches. Have fun with whatever you replace the time with meanwhile
---
Yes, after spending 30-45 minutes in a nuked out Whitespring you can accumlulate dozens of legendary items. If you're super high level you won't need 99% of them, and you can only sell so much each day, so it's easier to just drop them someplace for other people who might want them.
---
In addition to checking the suitcases and cash registers at vendors, be sure to check the ice machine box just outside the entrance to the Whitespring golf course building. Lots of people drop stuff there in between rounds of ghouls because it's often not worth it for us to carry it anywhere else.
---
How much are you looking to buy it for?
---
Was it near Helvetia? There is a loose Blunderbus in that town.
---
Voice chat be like:  AARRRCHKMMAAKKHARLCHCHICH
---
Are they not aware of this or something? Amazing that we're a few months/patches out and this simple text display mistake is still there. 
---
Well I will do that! Thank you
---
Sorry there's no argument to be had here the drops are horrible I spammed the nuke sound over 40 times in a row and killed legendary monsters and all I got was Barbie walking canes into shot pool cues so don't give me that b******* excuse motherfuker kiss my ass to heaven and back
---
No no no. Morgantown Highschool. üëç
---
I only play every once in awhile and lurk here a bit, and this is the first time hearing about this. I now know my next goal, thanks for that!
---
Where exactly are you talking about? I've found a damaged assaultron that has a healthbar in a laundry bin inside whitesprings before.
---
lvl 76 here, still hunting for a TSE. Don't even care about the nerf, just wanna find one at this point.
---
"If there‚Äôs places you shouldn‚Äôt be, we have the ability to see that. If you‚Äôre equipping 50,000 Super Stimpaks, a million Bulk Ballistic Fibers, or any other absurdly high quantity of other ‚Äúrare‚Äù items in the world, we can find out how many you have. When our systems detect abnormalities, we are suspending these accounts indefinitely pending further investigation.¬†"

---
Wow you're special no I don't care about YOU or your falsely made accusation nor does anyone else but that's the type of reading comprehension I'd expect out of someone acting like a 7 yr old. I'm sorry if your daddy didnt hug you enough as a child I'm sure someone out there loves you. I mean I guess I could log on to prove you wrong but I'm not because it's not that important and football is on. You can troll elsewhere
---
Oh god yes.
---
Whitespring farming is popular for a reason.  You'll walk away with a TON of one stars, maybe a few two, and occasionally a few three stars.
---
It's not hard, turrets are pretty useless. Hope you feel good about yourself.
---
Yeah I have a full set (also on PC) am online now
---
They could have not been exposed to it yet. 76 is the first game that has ever mentioned the scorched plague or scorchbeasts. To me, this indicates that most of the United States was entirely unaffected by it (this could be because we're eliminating the threat currently). While are purpose as members of Vault 76 was to survive the war and begin rebuilding, I don't believe that we are meant to be a sort of Garden of Eden. 
---
As a matter of fact, several notes reference things happening outside of WV, meaning that there are people elsewhere. Why wouldn't they move into an area that wasn't hit by nukes (before we showed up) and has green trees and wildlife to eat? Sure, they will probably come across scorched and become infected, but there would be a time before that where they're just normal people. 
---
Just thought of this though: what if the reason there's a never-ending supply scorched for us to kill all across WV is because outsiders are coming in and getting infected before we meet them? 
---
this happened to me yesterday was a legendary on every ghoul i killed.
---
Got me a 2 shot submachine gun so not too shabby of a haul :).
---
After level 50 what difference does level make other than being able to get a bigger collection of cards (can still only equip the same amount though).
---
You seemed to think a level 12 having a TSE was a dupe. Ive given my low level weapons and armour....doesn't mean I've been duping.
---
I'm not defending cheaters what im saying is your making a lot of assumptions and can't proof them. Just because a low level with a tse killed 4-5 "high" level players doesn't mean shit and certainly doesn't 100% mean he was using duped weapons!
---
Whenever you need a basic upgrade, do not forget to look in the ice chest in front of the whitesprings golf course clubhouse.
---
This has never been implemented in a Gamebryo game. You can't just wish it to be true and "poof! Magically it has happened!"
---
+karma 
---
I noticed this and it happens when I equip my explosive gatling laser, but the damage goes back after unequiping. My guns look trash now. I wonder if the mutation Grounded is doing this, I got it today.
---
:-(
---
I don‚Äôt feel good. I feel great! Thanks
---
Mine were like that without being equipped and I don't have the grounded mutation. I have marsupial which I've had for a while now and never had any issues 
---
No it hasn't
---
They do have the ability to tweak certain things at the back end though apparently so take what you will from that. 
---
:-)
---
Sort of. It has variable enemy spawns, so you have to scout the area first to see what's there. If it's populated with mutants or scorched when the bomb drops you'll only get higher levels version of those enemies.
---
You might want to try gas masks - you can wear helmets over them and they look pretty bomb.
---
You're doing good in this world sir.  Bless ya &lt;3
---
It could work like the Skyrim bookshelves. Select shelf, choose the junk to place and it will be placed in whatever order and stay there.
---
Anyone who bought the game....
---
I mean I lost 1,000 damage off my two shot explosive dragon so I'm not really sure how much more they will want to take from it
---
Great. How do we meet up?
---
That's the kind of thinking someone had when they're so bad at games they gotta cheat to stay almost even.
---
I tried Monongah last night. Server hopped before to get Ghouls. Then when we got there after launching the nuke, it was Mole Miners. And it would change after leaving and coming back. Whitesprings is King for now, as you know what you're getting.
---
Not so. From Solomon's Pond I've fired artillery rounds into the employee parking lot (which sets off all the junker cars very spectacularly).
---
End game in Fallout has always been aboutchu.
---
totally agree.
---
I was taking grafton steel on weekend and this lvl130 guy comes up and gives the thumbs up and starts taking my base like WTF.
---
So i shot him and grabbed his loot.
---
He must of blocked me str8 away because i couldnt see him on map and figured he moved away.
---
so i keep building generators to power the extractors and this guy just lights me up with a tse 50cal or minigun.
---
i respawn and wanted revenge but this guy was just chameleoning and waiting and as soon as i step foot towards my worskhop he lights me up again.
---
All i wanted is to open the workshop for everyone to collect resources but no asshat griefers lol. :)
---
I have over 450 hours lol. I can't  remember the last time I was this addicted to a game
---
There seems to be very little focus on adding any content to things that seem to be set up for things to be added to, there are still numerous bugs (Assualtron head still uses all fusion cells) and there has been little in the way of making it actually work like a real, functional MMORPG.      
---
I would guess this game will die within the next year, unfortunately. I love the environment and the idea of it but it was executed very poorly.
---
The spawns can change between checking and nuking though. Ask me how I know... :(
---
I would not be that angy if i got ‚Äùwrongfully‚Äù banned ( lvl 250 more or less complete gear for 2 builds) as long as a huge chunk of the real dupers got it up the pooper as well. That is how tired I am of what the duping has done to the market and the gameplay (infinite bobbles etc for the assholes).
---
My 2 cents. Probably not the common view but hey, fuck dupers/glitchers online, especially the real money beggars.
---
Peace to everyone else &lt;3
---
Ya they totally should...once they also get to the point where they aren't just slowing it down for the people that made it to launching nukes. If you can't even launch em yet, you shouldn't be there.
---
Lol, no mate, not me
---
Played a bit this weekend. Had three SBQ encounters and only one of them dropped a weapon which was a 1 star nocturnal golf club. 
---
Three Ultracite Explosive Vents and mostly junk. 
---
They really need to tweak that as it‚Äôs not even worth the time or ammo to fight the SBQ. 
---
There went their current end game. 
---
Providing you have either the plans or the mod you can apply it to any level
---
Sentinel is still great against mobs.
---
Awh, does someone need their diapey wipey changed? 
---
That would be awesome if masks changed your voice chat, mole miner respirator turns you into pyro from tf2
---
Even if you could thats ill advised.
---
And that chunk of land that decided tree houses weren‚Äôt cool enough!!
---
Thanks üôè That‚Äôs the answer I was looking for 
---
my name is darrelgamespro ps4
---
Wym
---
It would use up the mod, so you wouldn't be able to place it on other pieces while leveling.  If you can actually craft the jetpack though, sure, go for it.
---
Yeah. If I recall correctly there's multiple memos from HR talking about the problem. It's pretty hilarious.
---
Kk
---
Or mole miners
---
All, OP says he got banned yesterday. It‚Äôs a troll post. 
---
Does it needs repair or you debuffed by a disease or the negative effects of a mutation? 
---
Only asking as a damage reduction like that being done without an update and on the sly without telling or announcing it to people seems out there?
---
My friends and I are also experiencing this. One time, we were walking, and I noticed he didn't have his right arm, or left leg. I told him. He said he reequipped them, I still couldn't see them. Shortly after, I made my excavator armor, and I only had enough stuff to make one of each piece, and I ended up with two right arms. 
---
Better than having high DR and ER you think?
---
&gt; Hey gamers,
---
FELLOW LIT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY
---
&gt; A communist version of Liberty Prime
---
Then hopefully if this becomes true we can remove everything on the wiki pertaining to 76. Lets do it, please.
---
It was happening with my T60 right arm for a few days a while back. It fixed itself randomly tho
---
That would be awesome but really hard on Xbox lol I‚Äôve already been using Xbox messages to talk with other players but it can be tedious. It‚Äôs a bit better now that I‚Äôve got the Xbox app on my phone .. I‚Äôd even prefer to use a mic to transcribe my words for a text chat lol 
---
Howd you do it? Slow or in one big blast?
---
Is known bug.
---
Marine wetsuit also has a chance of dropping from the savage divide treasure maps, it's more of a chance than farming but it's something to try between server hops. 
---
Yes
---
I ended up with two left legs too!  So it‚Äôs related.  Nice.  Fuck this game is buggy.  
---
There is a cure to the scorch plague, remember?
---
Got a good way to get strike beacons? Theyre so damned expensive to craft
---
Increasing armor pen and damage would make the players less of a bullet sponge. Also pvp is just people 1 shotting eachother. If enemies had similar damage to us like you purpose i feel it would be adiquite. Or just increase their armor a little not from 21 to 200 maybe 75 or 100. 
---
Funny thing is they're probably not noobs.
---
Yes all the way, I‚Äôve been wanting a way to direct people to a spot to trade for goods. 
---
Same, x299 1080ti PC 100+ up/down net, and I basically just play Between disconnects still. I stream at 1080p 60 and have Never had connection issues. Having a super good time, but I get to level 40, delete the character and start again so not to waste my time attempting anything that matters. I dont even have a character WITH power armor yet alone mods. 4 re-installs and one system format thanks to the FAQs attempting to say its my fault too. One note, I did make it through a map nuke, a double nuke, and some issues yesterday for the first time. Of course I was stuck at an airport at level 9, so dont know if those in the zone got lucky. I had never seen the "Controls have been disabled" tag end and the game go back to smooth before, so I still have some faith. The one and only thing I have noticed is that I get fewer FPS and way worse play on borderless, so far fullscreen is the only way I can play at all. Too many hours to mention, been playing since hour 1 day 1 of b.e.t.a.  
---
Oh how I hope a stranger walks in here like they do my CAMP and schools me/us on something basic so the game plays better.... 
---
I have. I went into whitesprings with a level 35 Furious lever action rifle with +50% crit effects.... Perks:  +30% damage Rifleman, level 1 Adrenaline, level 3 Concentrated Fire, level 3 Glow Sight... wearing a hamat suit with 15 agility + Evasive and 15 luck with Better Criticals and Critical Savy.
---
this was my friend's character and they had marsupial. No deaths. Ran out of stimpaks though
---
For energy weapons, yes. It reduces energy gun damage by up to 50%, depending on what level you have class freak (if you don‚Äôt, then it‚Äôs 50%)
---
Sir, I am a shit sales man. Got me 6 brahmin. Thats 12 head. You need shit, Im your man. J started with one brahmin and it went from there. With some fancy remodeling I think I can get to z or maybe 8 brahmin.
---
You stumble across a bag of shit with a molotov in it in your camp, that was me. It's my calling card. Think of it as a flaming bag of poo. 
---
Equipping being the key word. If its already in the inventory they cant track it, but if you equip it from your stash and such then it will flag..
---
Jokes on those neanderthals land people suck tree people will live on in luxury 
---
It might have been a glitch that got fixed, but early on I'd tag an entire camp of mutants and then watch the pips slowly disappear, one by one, at about the pace I'd tagged them. No weapon switching involved. I've heard others say the same.

The last 3 days in a row, every time I have taken on a daily mission from Watoga (cop a squatter iirc) , I would get disconnected between 2-5 minutes later without fail. It has happened so consistently that I felt like reporting it here as a bug. 
---
I don't know or hope this have happened to anyone else, but if you have experienced this bug, please let me know. 
---
It is.  Hornwright Industries quest where you repair and find the motherload in the basment.  Happens just like described: A massive tunneling machine bursts out of the ground then after a few moments returns below the surface (ground shaking and everything)
---
Marine resistant lining plans can be found at the bos vendor Phoenix. Cost me 440 caps and a couple server hops to reset his inventory after purchasing the first lining plans for 220C
---
Yup!! =D
---
I have a furious flamer I used on a Scorchbeast queen didn't work as well as I thought it would
---
For what it's worth, I'm not "crying" over the lack of human NPCs. I think the initial complaints were because there wouldn't be NPCs around to drive the questlines and interact with. That's not what I'm talking about as specified in the first line of the post. 
---
I think the addition of "normal" NPCs that don't have melted brains, a disease, or isn't a robot would make for a more dynamic playing experience and that the activities of these NPCs would offer new opportunities that aren't available to us currently with NPCs that are unable to plan or otherwise act of their own volition. This idea is not advocating for interactive human NPCs, just killable ones.
---
Thx. Where‚Äôs it the best place to track known/confirmed bugs?  And/or submit new bugs?
---
Just server hop a few times and make sure its got ghouls there before nuking :)
---
Look up how to get the t51-b nuka cola paint and the Alien Blaster EC converter plans, they are both part of a pretty extensive unmarked quest that takes you all over the map finding keys, codes and holotapes.
---
It can be used for good... and evil?
---
Sorry I need that plan, plus Xbox 
---
What weapon and did you loot it or buy it from someone?
---
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Toxic_dried_lakebed  this is what I meant :)
---
Nice build - I run a similar one without the sneaking. I would also recommend a single rank of Gun-fu. That target switching is beyond fun.
---
As far as using this with PA, one downside I noticed is that fusion cores get drained fast when you're using your AP. So going into VATS to deliver some crit pain will take a toll on your fusion core's power. I believe there's perks you can take to help with this, but I don't know enough to recommend them.
---
This kinda sounds like you want to make these areas inaccessible to 90% of the player base. Like level 95? That's higher than the queen! Damage resistance, damage potential and give them fatmen\ Gauss rifle? Sounds kinda like a death sentence to anyone without TSE. I don't hate the idea I do want nuke zones to feel more special but I think this is going overkill
---
Search C0DE_E
---
It's a zero for the O 
---
I was under the impression that it doesn‚Äôt change her HP but rather her DT, meaning it could easily change as new players enter without the change being readily visible. 
---
Depending on the intention of the person who controls the station, yeah.
---
Thats the thing though: it's my only energy weapon. All the rest lose half damage when I equip the energy gun.
---
Keep it up bro
---
The lore would have to be tossed out the window if they do anything drastic.
---
Imo dlc will introduce the overseer and maybe some ghouls.
---
I can't say it was a Fat Man, but I've seen a similar thing where the Scorchbeast Queen was dead before I could even Fast Travel there.
---
You may be unaware, but having a turreted base behind the whitespring club is highly frowned upon, so people usually destroy them.
---
Don't bother with the images, no one cares really, well except the guy who's base it was but as its on the golf course they've probably been moaning on here that someone destroyed there pixels with more pixels already :D
---
This is datamined information, not the actual development road map. It's not like he opened up some secret document that outlined the next 2 years of FO76.  Seriously, it's fun stuff to read, but nothing that should be taken seriously.  You can come back in off the ledge, it'll be ok. I promise
---
The only issue being, you‚Äôre wasting a lot of high end materials or an expensive mod on under leveled gear
---
P.s. jetpacks destroy your cores reeeeal fast
---
Another mans trash is another mans treasure.
---
What in the godamn 
---
This seems like its not common enough to matter 
---
Pipe pistols only!! Or melee defense quest!?
---
Make a few different options,  so everyone cam have a turn at a few different playstyles.
---
You can encounter them in West Tek building where is a fusion reactor ( side area of building )... It shreds player like hell :/
---
What? My post has nothing to do with what you said, I know how to join, the problem is the crashing.
---
Im talking like as im going through useless or items I know im going to trade i could set the prices in my inventory as a constant.   Long before a trade just price everything and anything i have priced is up for sale.  The amount of times im selling junk someone tries buying the armor im wearing or my only weapon.
---
Just clickbait for the masses.  Nothing to pay attention to.
---
I think you added me already? Says your offline
---
I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs just a nasty rumor trying to hurt Bethesda for their lackluster product (it‚Äôs not bad, I enjoy it, but there‚Äôs a lot of problems they‚Äôre not addressing). 
---
Most people aren‚Äôt going to buy it if they think it‚Äôll become F2P. 
---
There is a website that lists the code every weeks. Nukacrypt.com 
---
This is so perfect and I gotta think not that hard to implement.
---
Unlimited? Sorry, there is a budget there man.
---
Sure. I don't really understand how armor and defense works in this game to be honest. The gist is just make it more of a challenge. The semantics are lost on me. I updated my original post to remove 200.
---
I am getting very frustrated with clearing an area out being level 25 then all of a sudden a lvl 68 will come near and boom all the enemies I cleared now respawn at lvl 60+ and next thing I know I am dead, arrghhhh
---
Appreciate it.

Either modder, or dudes crazy.

It spawns at the door to silo alpha on my experience. After completing I'm am death of course
---
Seriously. While I respect what /u/teplitzin is doing here, to the idiot masses, this just throws gasoline on the FO76 sucks bonfire.  This is in no way indicative of any or all of the content they may or may not have planned, nor does it show a specific road map for the future.  Next time, I would lead with the disclaimer about what exactly this is and \*more importantly\* what it isn't. I'd also leave the cynical comments out, and just report the "facts" here...those bits you threw in there as attempts to bash Bethesda certainly got the intended response, eh?
---
This has never ever happened to me. Is this a console thing? Everyone is really solitary I've noticed unless playing in an actual team. People usually just come in thumbs up and scurry off.
---
I drop plans and bobbleheads in camps I come across 
---
I haven't seen any pipe revolvers.
---
Move it?  
---
I‚Äôm not being snarky. You can pick up your camp unit and move it around the build area. I‚Äôm pretty sure this affects the fast travel target as I‚Äôve been able to keep from spawning in awkward places by doing so. 
---
There was no need to exploit to be 200 by now
---
Yeah I know.  Guessing you mean trying to join from the immediate social menu in game?  It has crashed every time for me too. But if you press start (Xbox) then got to menu and social and try the same, it will work. 
---
Yeah sorry wasn't directing the crying comment at you or your post just the uproar in general at launch about it and ever since.
---
I'd defo be open to everything in your post though, anything that add's to the game is a positive and it would be an easy addition for them as well!
---
How's the flora there?
---
Nope and it was on every weapon that had those prefixes. I had a two shot automatic Tesla rifle that used to do like 111 damage with all the commando perks and now it only does about 77. 
---
Brother grab the flamer.
---
Good it's not just me!!  The final room spawn yesterday was 3 protectrons and an eyebot. I could have taken the silo with a rolling pin.
---
Text chat is more of a pc suggestion than anything else 
---
I understand, I just take this problem a little personal as I do some coding myself and shits hard man. XD
---
They can be bought from Resin, at Pleasant Valley Ski Resort 
---
I was talking about both options. But it doesn't matter, today it seemed to work fine, but not after countless restarts the day after.
---
Sound pretty bad ill take it off ya for 1 cap
---
Ant Hill DLC, they could open up more of the ash heap.  Ants have carried items down there and you have to go do hero things.  Scorched Ant queen boss at the end. solid. 
---
The only mutation I have is marsupial and it's never affected my guns before 
---
- The Queen is level 95.
---
-Mobs in Fallout 4 had Fatmen. Gauss rifle isn't that strong since mobs don't have damage perks or criticals and can't perform sneak attacks, nor can they chomp down chems.
---
-Without TSE? Not so sure about that as weapon balance is an evolving thing which I hope gets ironed out over time
---
I looked it like 2 weeks ago in a nuke zone. It was suppressors grognaks axe. The first one I lost was All Rise hammer
---
I picked one up and saved it in case any couple needs it.
---
&gt;Yes fair, but no hint of anything
---
Do you understand what this is? It's just datamining files that are already in the game, but obviously unused.  If content has yet to be added to the game, it wouldn't show up here.  And if you paid attention to the last Inside The Vault issue, it was clear that they're going to be announcing new content very soon, and following that up quickly with a release.  I'll bet you 1000 caps we hear something this week.
---
Bethesda is 100% convinced the community as a while is screaming for more pvp.  No matter how many posts on so many different platforms seem to indicate otherwise.   Speaking for myself I'm really hoping somebody will remove their heads from their butts?
---
From indications like this it would appear their direction is to push PVP content.  At this point considering the financial struggle they are under post launch,  is there any money to change this direction?
---
I mean from their stand point why struggle to make new creatures and events surrounding them if they can make our fellow community members into the monsters.  Lots cheaper! 
---
Hope it keeps working!
---
Happy Cake Day
---
With competent programming inventory/stash size wouldnt be a problem.
---
I fully agree that it should and could be done (it sucks playing with more than 3 friends because one always feels left out).
---
That makes sense 
---
A troll posted about it it going here on reddit. the youtube click train picked it up as people talking about fo76 going f2p. i am surprised it is still popping up.
---
Well, today i'm trying to play since like an hour or so. Got disconnected from server 3 times and hard crashed twice. Sent info to Sony both times for what it's worth... I'm going to try and disable boost mode and see if it helps.. 
---
I wear the Veil of Secrets and the flight helmet. Kinda makes you look like a weird bird mask. 
---
I also found a Ritual Mask somewhere that looks pretty freaky. But I don‚Äôt wear it often. 
---
The scout armor one that someone else mentioned is cool but I haven‚Äôt found them often. 
---
Oh Ik that it is and very time consuming but the team/time/budget they have compared to one guy or an indie game company, should have been enough to put out a complete product beforehand or at least fix it as top priority not this much later after launch is all I'm saying.
---
Play the main story quests, that will get you close to level 50.
---
From the milk of human kindness 
---
Appreciate the help. What do you think would be my best be as a prefix for someone who doesn't pvp? I was considering getting each of the -15% npc damage reducing ones but idk. Maybe weightless?
---
hmm maybe they've been tweaking the values behind the scenes or something then, maybe trying to find that sweet spot before going all Mj√∂lnir with the nerf bat 
---
What you don't like an underpowered bolt action rifle using a left handed bolt for some off reason ?
---
Since the last patch it's been brutal for me as well :(
---
No, it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôve dropped dozens of nukes. 
---
The porta-shitter is the exit.  You can‚Äôt enter the silo through it, similar to dungeon exits in ES5. There‚Äôs specific entrances (elevators) for each silo concealed within buildings.  Alpha and Bravo are the most obvious as they‚Äôre just small shacks in the middle of nowhere. 
---
Once inside the tiny shack, you‚Äôll see an elevator. Get inside. There‚Äôs a hand scanner inside that you can activate and go down to the silo. 
---
If you‚Äôre having trouble with this task though, the silos are gonna be a real PITA for you.

Always check the tills. I leave plans and any spare bulk etc there for peopl. I started doing it after some absolute legend left the barn plans in watoga cash register 
---
Weird how opinions differ.
---
I do the glass cave to farm ultracite and I enjoy doing the run start to finish.
---
Then again FO76 was my gateway drug into looter shooters and I can't get enough of the genre now.
---
Hell I've been stuck in The Division's Dark Zone (PvP) area for a few days now trying to get my loot out and I keep being wasted by overpowered players and NPCs and I still enjoy every minute.
---
No1curr
---
&gt;It doesn't, but I think it's understandable that people adjust their expectations based on what they can see was cut, and what they can see hints at future events.
---
But that's not really what this is. It's datamined from the list of messages that are already in the game.  Whether they are used or not, or (despite the label) how they are used can be debated. But this isn't actually a list of "content", nor is it any sort of roadmap or indication on what is, isn't or will never be in the game.  
---
It's "neat", but nothing beyond a curiosity. It's nothing people should get up in arms about.
---
Played today, but yeah I banned lol. Go back to being miserable 
---
I'd also think its be fun if they offered some atomic shop items just for completing some challenges 
---
Skyrim refrence
---
My friend always gives people the emote with the red circle and the line when they piss him off lol
---
I just got them today from Lewistown, level 130.
---
Yeh same. Like Op's moxy but B. Already has suggested this.
---
Maybe still kinda weird that they said it would be coming in the patch and yet here my weapon damage is dropping very noticably 
---
I‚Äôve been to a blast zone one time. I was a level 23 at the time (currently 29). I‚Äôd seen enough mushroom clouds from afar that I really wanted to see what it was like inside the red circle. So I dropped all my junk, put on my hazmat suit and grabbed my best rifle and shotgun and went in. The experience was awesome, though I knew what the result would be. Saw my fair share of glowing baddies and helped take them down. Took what I could from the buildings til more spawned. No interest in legendary this or that or the XP‚ÄîI wanted to see what it was like in there and I had a blast. Lasted about 10 minutes all told‚Äîwas seriously out leveled. Never even tried to get back in to retrieve my dropped junk‚Äîyou‚Äôre welcome to whoever claimed it. 
---
You play the way you want, the rest of us will play the way we want. If you‚Äôre bothered by low-level players being in there, oh well. Deal with it. 
---
I would like to see more nuke-bosses. Moth-Man Master,  Flatwoods Alien Queen, Giant Grafton Monster, Sloth Behemoth, etc... With legendary loot. Area dependent, like if you nuke grafton = Giant Grafton Monster
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer pls pls pls can we have this? üòä
---
Haha?
---
Okay here you go. I should have posted them in the first place, my bad. I would have screenshots of him alive, but i was in power armor as i was walking around in the mire, and PA fucks up print screen screenshots.
---
https://imgur.com/a/jsGeOyI
---
Trying to play the game. In the last hour i got disconnected from server 3 times and the game hard crashed twice... Right now, i can't even log in, it's keeps saying "trying"... beggining to get sick of that not better then pre-alpha game..
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll matter. Monster mash is ‚ÄúPvP‚Äù and nobody ever shows up. It‚Äôll be the same once the glow of being new wears off. 
---
Just click bait for those on the "This game sucks" band wagon
---
People don't understand what this is.  It's not a list of game content. It's 2% datamined messages from the game and 98% speculation.  But it's not officially gospel since it's hit the front page of /r/FO76.
---
&gt;  they actually think this game has that much content to keep people interested for that long.
---
They don't. That's why the nerfed XP gains, so that people don't get to the endgame too fast and realize there really isn't anything worth grinding for. 
---
I decided to go on newbie patrol last night. Needed to burn through some leather etc. And I had a metric shit ton of 10mm and .38 ammo that I'll probably never use. 
---
So there I am, running around in my straight jacket and Faschnact Mask. Trying to give low level players goodies. Trying to get their attention over mic, etc. I spent probably 10 minutes doing this before I realized my damn mic was unplugged. 
---
All in all, I handed out 5 sets of leather armor, pipe pistols, over a thousand rounds of ammo, and 30ish stimpacks. Probably would have given out more if people had been able to hear me. 
---
Great question. Experiencing it a lot on Xbox, too.
---
Thanks! I do know about those. 
---
How original. That's what I'd assumed someone who's been proved wrong would say
---
Can't even empty a single reload of my two shot exploding flamer before it breaks some days.
---
I‚Äôve been playing them at regular speed and they continually require me to level up in between. I‚Äôm level 19 and the enemies in my missions are getting drastically higher above my level
---
As long as the AI is significantly smarter than it's been in previous games I'm down? 
---
Enjoy!
---
I got the plans from Phoenix in watoga after about the 900th jump. Almost as rare as the jetpack bit since I yet yet to see that, that's more rare.
---
Are you using the complete set? Excavator extra weight only triggers if you‚Äôre using it with no other parts.
---
You just cant do it, can you?   You're so butthurt over being called out, that you just cant walk away.   Let it go, dude.   Go play a game you haven't been banned yet in.
---
He gotchu good bro, cause here you are 'doing something about it'.
---
Why are you starting over? There is no reason too. You dont need new playthroughs. Just dumb... 
---
Woman broke her Christmas ornament, an angel, and buried it because it was so precious to her.  ^^ignore ^^the ^^baby ^^toys ^^and ^^carriage
---
You can get the unique All Rise from a quest in Watoga.
---
Yep. ‚ÄúPack Rat‚Äù. Reduces junk weight by 25/50/75% depending on level. 
---
If he had lvl 3 that junk would have only weighed 50lb. 
---
Could not agree more in this case
---
Your first encounter with a twink üôÉ
---
You have to have all six pieces of excavator PA equipped to gain the 100 carry weight bonus. If it is not working, try relogging and equip it after you login.
---
Bring a mass of lvl 1 so your high lvl character can kill the scorch queen "solo".....its a bit to abuseable.  
---
They should have a chat with blizzard to find out how the mobs scale to multiple lvls. rather than just the highest.
---
I'll do that, thanks!
---
I shouldn't have to pay just to make a bigger camp
---
Lol?
---
Also Pleasantville cemetery has 3 level 3 safes. One gave me a plan for the Gatling gun.
---
People who do this are legends to us lowbies. Especially the plans. We thank you for your service
---
Your are the worst kind of idiot, you're proven wrong and still cant let it go lol. Go ahead and comment back so you can get the last word since that's seemingly what u want. I'll let you have it
---
true.
---
What you propose?
---
Oh hell yeah, with you on that!
---
It is Bethesda though and nothing should surprise us anymore :(
---
They think customers are just 0's and 1's they don't think communicating with us or letting us know whats going on with the broken product is as important as there bottom line though :(
---
Oh I‚Äôll try that. Thank you
---
Did you find the ultralight plans?
---
Oh, hey, thanks!
---
I dont have a ton of time to play but I love the idea. Bethesda tag APA643
---
How about you just go get a mic/headset? They are cheap. You can get a logictech that will last you decades for 20 bucks or less. 
---
I am level 112 and im really bored
---
I'm bringing sexy back, SQUAK!!
---
If you are ever at Watoga Station, always check the blue suitcase to see if it has stuff in it. This is a normal location for people to dump plans they already know or equipment they dont need especially after a SBQ fight. Some people also use the blue lunchbox next to the suitcase or the cash register at the actual vendor bot.
---
We cant sell plans and there is only so much stuff we can sell so it's good to see this stuff go to others that can use it.
---
Just throw PA on and do it, been doing them solo on my rilfe build since lvl 35 (ish) and around the same level on my melee toon as well.
---
Yes, or some sort of text chat. The sort where we choose from a selection of words and phrases, rather than type in full would be great.
---
Totally. I'd like to see a Giant, mutated, floating Todd Howard head that shoots radioactive lightning bolts out his eyes... personally.
---
Maybe you dropped or sold it accidentally 
---
Yeah, that surprised me when one of my pieces got fully damaged. Need the full set equipped. 
---
Lol
---
There are legit, out of the way, non-glitchable places with a zero percent spawn rate, and zero turrets required. Don‚Äôt give up hope.
---
I won‚Äôt say where my husband and I are though. For one, I don‚Äôt want to start a land rush, and two, we‚Äôve been mauled by fucking assholes too many times in the last couple of weeks to trust anyone anymore.
---
One question: can you do it with syringers alone?
---
I'm at level 15 and struggling
---
Not being allowed to use your pip boy in bed is the biggest miss in this game. 
---
Pretty much. I wonder if they thought people wouldn't notice the change. I switch between rifleman and commando perks quite frequently so I kinda have an idea of what perks I have on when I go to kill enemy's and they don't take as much damage as I thought. That's what playing with the guns reminded me of that's why I checked the damage I was doing.
---
Thats really nice! But you know... Dont quit your day job.
---
Okay, so on top of being a sorry cheater, you're also an idiot that doesnt know what the word proof means.   You also still just cant let go.
---
Tell ya what, if we're gonna spend more time together, how about you post a bunch more links I won't bother to click?   Then you can waste even more time telling me what they were and how totally owned I would have been if I had bothered to click them.   Go on.
---
That's why I think the radio is a good idea though. It can be used for trading and helping folk as a responder woild. Each faction could have a blast doing what they are actually meant to do. Raiders raiding, brotherhood basically raiding, free states folk could be paranoid together. It could really feed into the role playing side of things. Maybe I'm being too ambitious though.
---
See my post.  Buy weapons and armor. 
---
Man, what a badass. Even namedropping. Totally not going to get downvoted. You are such a cool tough guy. 
---
lmfao.
---
Thanks, but I‚Äôm in school. Since midterms are coming up, it‚Äôs been really boring, so...
---
and for ffs pause thirst and hunger when intentionally resting.  Give us a small reason to use the furniture. 
---
It's just a rumor, nothing more and honestly I think going free to play would hurt the game a lot more than what has already been done. Because if that were to happen, it would piss off everyone who spent 60+ dollars on this game, then that gives more fuel for the people to make clickbait videos on the game and that might just kill off the playerbase.
---
I loved the cave! Its an awesome area, and i walked out with tons of ultracite... the problem was the four scorch beasts... the glitch locking me out of completing belly of the beast... and then a glitch that burned all my 556 in one shot, ive had a pretty glitch free experience until i do missions. 
---
Hell, Im offering anybody that needs help with belly a hand, i certainty dont mind rolling the cave or the mission now that i know you can skip it all and go straight to the end of the cave.
---
Because jetpacks are that rare I would not place one on a lowbie PA set that you will eventually scrap. Save them for your higher end sets.
---
Thank you everyone for clearing it up for me!
---
Lvl 275 an i break a couple of guns easy in a queen fight if there are scummy barn/gully dwellers hanging around and doing fuck all. You dont know what youre talking about 
---
The most recent fix seems to have finally fixed my constant crashing problems. Previously I could only play a few minutes before getting booted, but now I haven't been kicked at all during playing the last few days. I'm on Xbox, and was hoping that meant it was better for everyone across the board. I'm really sorry to hear it's gotten worse for you, that was the most irritating thing to try to play around, in my opinion. 
---
I do not want to but if they also nerf notmal TS i will roll back to melee from my favorite heavy guns build....
---
They'll put it on the map for you?
---
I feel like it made the game better, I got to dealve into more stories and building and no longer had to worry about enemies so much.
---
Then post the video dawg, don't leave us hanging!
---
Sounds like you could use a supply drop.
---
If you want to avoid a lot of flak, you should have mentioned the clearly duped items in his drop bag in the OP. 
---
Yes to all, and also why can't I sit in PA? Don't tell me my legs won't fit under the table, because that bench inside watoga station has no table.
---
Pick a location near by and go clear it out, dump junk in stash and rinse and repeat.
---
Uh I do it all the time on my vats rifleman I use unyielding gear and oneshot everything in there. This games difficulty is very build/gear dependent. Seems like you‚Äôre just lacking a bit if you used that many stims. 
---
Better luck next time, wastelander!
---
You found a Heavy Bolter. Where's your commissar, Guardsman?
---
Awesome this community needs more players. The game gets better ever update aswell
---
Yes you are
---
I like to help out low level players with quests/general exploring. It can seem repetitive but I‚Äôve noticed things I didn‚Äôt see on my first exploration of certain places so that‚Äôs pretty cool 
---
Hmm...my xbox app...achievement fallout 76...7hrs ago... = not banned for anyone with a functioning brain
---
when i find these locked camps I always try to find a way in. easiest way is usually open the shutters and use a crafting table. If you leave a flaw in your design I will find it and use your things!
---
Uh huh.
---
Pacifist PVE explorer type here. Don't play too often but the name is Knytmare
---
BuzzFeed.

Wtb TSE Super Sledge
---
I've been there multiple times myself. Kinda currently am in one lol but there's always highs and lows. You'll get you're stuff soon
---
I get that message to if I‚Äôm indoors or under a branch- move your instrument to an open space and test it there
---
Time to make some leather armor and a board and get to work
---
I have not seen this looting or for sale. How did you get this?
---
Pretty much. Was doing a quest to get bone meal and basicly broke my armor and used alot of ammo.
---
If anyone has any suggestions on a decent mic setup for people who use speakers I‚Äôd gladly join in the mic party.  I absolutely hate wearing headphones for several reasons, I‚Äôve got an incredibly comfortable set of sennheiser hd650‚Äôs and I don‚Äôt even like wearing those for long.
---
But I also don‚Äôt want to cause a bunch of feedback and crap in games, so I‚Äôve never really bothered trying to use a mic.  I‚Äôd love to if there was a decent solution (lapel mics, really long goosenecks, I dunno)
---
Get a mic. My ps4 came with one. Works great. You realize its a online game right?
---
Indeed I am
---
I never let that phase me. I think when I was around that level I was doing the story missions near the ‚Äútop of the world‚Äù. I was running into enemies between the levels of 22-38 but they weren‚Äôt necessarily any harder to take down. By the time I was in the 40s I was killing enemies level 68 with ease including scorchbeasts. 
---
Agree the icon that shows the mic, show the no mic.  Simple fix.  Of course there is no text chat...
---
"Spelt" is an acceptable alternative for the past and past participle form of this meaning of the verb "to spell." Try a dictionary before using passing out your "pro tips."
---
Awesome photos demonstrating an amazing concept! Well done!
---
It will only cost you as much as the new Mic in Adams
---
I got my plans from Phoenix for the t51 calibrated shocks.
---
Yup.
---
Nice me and my wife will probably go get them tomorrow now.
---
Yeah just saw some videos from 3 days ago but they just talked without proof or any real collaboration 
---
Yeah a death claw keeps killing me 
---
Nope.  Mine never returned either.  Was anyone near you?  I thought I got pickpocketed by some creeper.
---
Was it that quest for radshield?
---
Probably played S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
---
How come those sneaky ruskies could cure themselves of rads with Vodka but the surly Yank just gets some strength and/or charisma? 
---
I've got some extra rounds of 308 since I recently scrapped the gun i used it for. I was getting ready to drop it actually. Subsidingcross2
---
A level 1 mothman just dropped out of the sky on my head once...screamed then killed him ü§£ü§£
---
My bad thought she was 85. I like the idea of higher levels i just don't want all of them to be 95 standard. Maybe as the nuke zone goes on they get stronger, so they start at say 50 and after 30-40 minutes they will have gone up to 80. 
---
I also don't have a problem with enemies using these weapons, actually I'd quite like it. It would give them some variety. I just don't want them constantly spawning. I want them to be more like a mini-boss. Someone you have to think about. My main problem lied with that you also wanted to increase their damage and their damage resistance. In my mind that made them some annoying bullet sponge of an enemy who would just one shot people. 
---
Final point I will agree i do hope weapon balance gets fixed because as long as you have certain legendary effects you will dominate the game currently.
---
Wtf? Great info. I was in a lookout tower today and was going to use my scope to look around and an interaction popped up asking if I want to survey the area, 3 new sites showed up on my map... 
---
[removed]
---
That's it right there though, they don't seem to care one way or another if people do notice :(
---
They need to take stock and replace a few key members of staff (imo) for this game to survive past the first year. 
---
Someone / multiple someones seriously dropped the ball during production, i mean some of these bugs made it in from FO4....if your going to rip off your own game and recycle the assets at least get them working perfectly. One or two of the issues were having ok but it's almost everything in game is broken or not working as it should and so far with each patch they've broken more than they've fixed :/
---
Shielded enclave under armour gives 3 strength
---
&gt;And why the two PA chassis? Do you regularly use two different suits of PA?
---
Yeah, look at this guy... two chassis? Pssh!
---
^(I have a chassis of every power armor in the game in my inventory at all times... thank god for Portable Power perk)
---
Marine Wetsuit mask and hallowed mask are cool. 
---
Exactly, not sure why you were downvoted for that
---
You‚Äôre totally missing the point here because you haven‚Äôt seen the endgame yet. He‚Äôs not talking about blast zones in general, only when a nuke is dropped on Prime and the Scorchbeast Queen is spawned. 
---
Every player that enters the event (she gets her own event called Scorched Earth) increases her damage resistance. If you‚Äôre there and not contributing in a meaningful way to taking her down, you are a significant burden on the ones who can. 
---
Are you on ps4 mate?
---
That‚Äôs a ridiculous statement. This is cut content. Perhaps cut because they didn‚Äôt feel like it spoke to their audience? There‚Äôs absolutely 0 evidence that any of this will end up getting released. 
---
This is why data mining is typically a bad idea, because you get raw data without any context and people jump to different conclusions about it. 
---
Same today for like 5min. O.o
---
Open the whitespring bunker vault door.  Jump down and to the left, theres what looks like a pile of junk.  Its a destroyed assaultron that you can interact with.
---
Eventually you can upgrade the vault under armour 4-5 times is it?
---
There are quite a few though, only ever upgraded my vault one though so others will be best to comment on them.
---
I'm on Xbox one x and I don't know about ps4
---
I would certainly pay for excavator p.a. Paint jobs!
---
When does the conga line of team mates end?
---
I think so. I know I found some lady's bunker listened to a holotape and it said go collect bone meal.
---
Well.
---
I'm done with sleep. 
---
Well it is Bethesda so probably a good amount
---
Thank you thank You! I'm glad I've been grinding stable flora now :)
---
The more people you bring in, the better the game will be. Keep up the good work mate, the Enclave salutes you. 
---
im not sure how your going to progress unless bgs updates the game again.
---
As in the last update they did something so as if you go into elevators instead of taking you to the top of what ever structure it just reloads you back at the bottom in front of the elevator..
---
Very much would suck. do you play on ps4. maybe i can help you see if it works within a team?
---
There are always arguments. You seem pretty upset with your lot in the game regardless so i guess a break would do you good. And farming whitesprings over and over for specific gear is boring and probably not even that effective. Me and my friends seem to have gotten our gear from a spread between the golf-rave, queen and random legendary monsters but above all we share and trade since we use different builds to some extent and we so not hoard or sell stuff to others that we could share for free within the group, everyone wins. The luckiest guy always wins the most but thats the game and over time the difference is minimal.
---
You argue like a random loot system ows you something and then you most likely will end up dissapointed. The game and loot spread has flaws absolutely but I think you need a break and a tissue my friend.
---
An hour of non stop attacking could kill anything 
---
Literally ants, the crickets are a bit nightmarish but I can deal with anything.
---
Even giant spiders, millipedes etc. Don‚Äôt bother me.
---
I dig up a nest in my garden helping my Mum as a child and got swarmed, hated them ever since.
---
its why i asked where to go to report. i dont game much so im not on specific forums. Either way it was interesting to get flak for it. like i said in another comment ive had a good exp w fo76, im usually the one hitting up lvl 40s an 50s dropping them things i dont need from nuke runs without charging caps.
---
My bad on that just figured a lvl 12 murdering have a server during a nuke run would point me in that direction of how to actually report
---
I haven‚Äôt been on in a couple weeks and thought maybe things would have improved. Some things have but somethings are WORSE!! Very long load times, requiring me to leave game and restart, and power armor is glitching again. Also, several times I have finally loaded in after waiting a long time and my controls don‚Äôt work and I have to restart! Very frustrating. I‚Äôm on PS4- VitoriaRain is username 
---
Yup on ps4.  I've tried all three levels and no luck
---
Did you have to kill a deathclaw by chance?
---
No kidding, and I didn't see it in a search.
---
Call it the Knight Rhys Special. Dat boy thicc. 
---
Yeah, I'm just not 100% sure that his findings are related to that specific instance, or if they maybe planned on it happening elsewhere too. That is definitely an instance that would fit with what he found though.
---
Haha
---
Ironic that you "read" one of the magazines, but couldn't be bothered to actually "read" the effect
---
you could open a support ticket and do your suggestion there.
---
This comment right hete, Bethesda.
---
Tower defence in '76. Yes please.
---
I know right im really bored
---
You cant go up in the lift to meet rose until you've done 2-3 missions for her. Once you get near the lift she'll start chatting shit to you and you should get the first mission from her show up. If it doesn't quit out and go back and it should fix it.

Have a look through that, you'll see where your up to on Madigans :)
---
Yes I as well enjoy that lol joined a trader store in chaos and I leave and heard a guy go wth am I paying you for he left and no one helped him..1 star on yelp wouldn‚Äôt shop again
---
Exactly. Fire teams that make a fo76 platoon
---
Rats.
---
you will find these maps on the walls of the broadcast towers as well, where you upload the "us supply requisition" holotapes.  fyi
---
Honestly it's about the same as beta they just flip flop back an forth! For example their nerffing TSE but their bugged already and heal ennimies! Don't get me started on energy weapons, their all broken!
---
What was the purpose of this post? 
---
I have had my base pretty much since day 1. The last thing I want, is glowing ones knocking on my door asking to use the toilet. 
---
It's locked right? But can't someone just smash a hole in your wall and get in that way?
---
Hang on can the new person chat again u cant see it on the comments you said you need help from the final...? (Just received a notifacate but when i clicked on it i didnt see it from the comments)
---
I miss having different grenade options for my Auto Grenade Launcher. That was an awesome feature in FO:NV. 
---
Think it was from one of the enclave events. 
---
Unfortunately, if you try to use a stealth boy the Assaultrons are smart enough to detect you, even if you're stealthed. So just be sure to avoid those bad ladies when trying to go for terminals, otherwise the jig'll be up. 
---
(I don't know why they didn't just phase out all other bots in favor of those badass bitches.)
---
Same, got my hands on the first ever for me. A level 15 10mm two shot. Dropped for my level 40 toon. Rngeesus was not with me tonight... I will take it to flatwoods and gift it to the first low level i meet tomorrow.
---
Indeed it has to do with where you put the C.A.M.P module inside your build radius. You have to play with where it is vs where it causes you to spawn. Just start moving it around go to the map and fast travel to your camp (even if you are already there), rinse and repeat...
---
erm collect some junk to repair your shit ... do you think you're screwed as in that's it your character is now useless?
---
Loved all the responses, though I can't imagine anyone killing robots in the enclave, especially not just one bot. Hard to see that. Also, frequently i'm wandering all over the place in a location before something dies in front of me. 
---
That's what is taking my ammo and broke my armor lol. What don't help is I've got alot of rads 
---
Ye my cave camp sucks spawning inside the rocks

under create a post button you shouls see your name and add user flair button.

doesnt do anything its just for fun.

You forgot that if a player challenges you to PvP but is broke, you get squat when you kill them but they get the normal amount when you die.

I assume you're talking about the flair, if on mobile app it's the triple dots in the right corner,  on an android atleast, and other wise it should be in the side bar.
---
I know how you feel. Moving east would be more efficient, but I love my little place on the river.  So pretty and quiet. Sure, those burnouts down the road at the farming supply place are bothersome, but I know how to quiet them down. 
---
Smdh ya I don't know why breaking a gun would be such an unheard of occurence. They don't last forever, especially not heavy guns, and *especially* especially when that includes a pair of plasma gatlings and a laser gatling ü§£
---
Just the fact that I'm not great at finding material
---
Thanks
---
DT?
---
also server hop at camden park until you can buy the calibrated shocks plan or modx2 from the vendor there.  bring that carry weight up to wonderful level.
---
15? I'm getting at least 99 rads 
---
country roads
---
Interesting. Some print screens would be fun to read, even with blurred names etc. but that might be hard to get and share. Anyways i hope they all get the banhammer hard from Beth
---
I like to think that the higher ups were pushing to get the game out as fast as possible which made it so they had to recycle parts of the game. I personally love this game I'm level 141 I think and play almost daily when I can( having a wife and kid kinda eats into my game playing time haha). It seems like they are trying but with the backlash they are facing from the community I'm sure the stress us getting to the team. I hope they continue to keep updating and improving the game because I personally love it. My brother in law said it best when he said this fallout game is more for people like me. I usually play multiplayer games like call of duty but I played fallout 4 and fell in love. He has played since fallout 3 I believe and he likes it but it's different. People said they wanted a multiplayer fallout and that's what we got but people are never happy about getting what they think they want. 
---
-Full charge is the only effective way to use a gauss rifle.  
---
-The 95% = Miss is a known issue ATM, :(. 
---
Sorry, DR. 
---
DT is damage threshold. I still think from the earlier days of 3/NV. 
---
This game is terrible.....IF you are narrowminded. This game is fantastic so far, and nothing can truly be perfect, so it makes sense it will be improved where it isn't perfect. I can't wait for the future of this game, it seems bright and the servers aren't full of haters. The internet is instead. This is my first Fallout, and as I understand the lore and atmosphere,  this game nails every bit of it.
---
OR DONT ALLOW TS AND EXPLOSIVE TOGETHER OR DONT ALLOW IT ON SHOTGUNS *mind gets boggled*
---
Will do  thanks again. 
---
i think they will.
---
The Dev room had Wooby and he was alive.
---
i dont think he was there as a test bed i think he is part of something to come.
---
So yes they should and will add NPC's.
---
This happen to me at an early level like 16 maybe, but I kept using the elevator and it somehow worker eventually. I get it's annoying though :(. I can't remember what exactly fixed it, but just wanted to let you know it eventually worker out somehow ha..
---
Over 350
---
I think it's all scorchbeasts as my tse gun does not damage to any of them 
---
Some of them appear to only drop for lower level characters, just like the handmade plan.. Really hope they fix it.
---
hahaha CLASSIC! :)
---
I think one of the best parts is you can still talk back as well and freak some people out. 
---
Where is whitesprings and why is it frowned on?still relatively new to the game...
---
um... Ad Victoriam? this is awkward.
---
next time go to whitesprings and try to get him to dink a robot. they you get the junk he was trying to steal from you.
---
Im sorry but 1/35 is not less than 0.03%, its just under 3%. So about 100 times more likely than 0.03%.
---
I think the Gauss Rifle is a rail gun, in which cause it would be because there is no primer/bullet involved in the projectile launch. Instead a metal slug is launched through the tube at high-velocity through the use of a highly charged magnetic coil.  Something along those lines anyways
---
Oh no. Glad I haven't found this yet.
---
 **Gauss rifle** is a type of projectile accelerator consisting of one or more coils used as electromagnets in the configuration of a linear motor that accelerate a ferromagnetic or conducting projectile to high velocity   
---
In short is uses huge sums of energy to fire a round and is non explosive unlike a standard bullet.
---
There appears to be a a bug ATM, image lost a couple weapons recently to this and a power armor leg, just vanished 
---
Trick I found with assaultron head is: a) can you load it and b) do you see an ammo count.  No to either means poof goes the ammo.  It's pretty much poop even if it wasn't eating cells. Surprised ya got caught cold, it pops up pretty often in thr sub for obvious reasons.  ;)
---
If you want more cells server hop until you find the ammo factory unused, makes hordes of it pretty quick.
---
(Relative) Heaps of cobalt, crimson and a bit of yellow. I didn‚Äôt run into any violet (and I looked). 
---
I‚Äôm going to write a quick ‚Äúhow to very effectively farm Violet‚Äù PSA in the next day or two, watch this subreddit :) 
---
pick a direction and loot everything in front of you and you'll be fine :P
---
Put everything in your stash or in your inventory. If that doesn't work try a different location for crafting.
---
Sweet, now can you tell me where to find a bed that sleeps 2?
---
I"m not sure what your problem was. From where your screenshot was taken, you certainly could hit parts of the Whitespring grounds ‚Äî because [from Solomon's Pond](https://www.beldar.org/2019/WhitespringAtty01.png), I can [hit](https://www.beldar.org/2019/WhitespringAtty02.png) the [Whitespring parking lot](https://www.beldar.org/2019/WhitespringArty03.png).
---
But...I put my camp near there
---
You're welcome. I am pretty new too. only starting using reddit because of this game XD.
---
You mean "how the building was programmed" and "developer foresight and competence."
---
Yes?
---
Social anxiety squad reporting in, I definitely feel like we need more variety. Right now I'm rocking the hunter's long coat and assault gas mask because they match surprisingly well, but before that it was either the fire breather gas mask or a combination of a bandanna, welding goggles, and combat armor helmet.
---
Also the explosions set mobs on fire. The actual flame doesn't need to hit them
---
I play solo and through speakers. I don't like wearing headphones for long periods of time. 
---
How do you know :(
---
As would I. I wonder if the reason we don't have it yet is due to the way Workshops operate. If it was PVE only, one person would own the Workshop for the entirety of their game play session. 
---
Combat armor helmet has a lamp on the top. Can't they just port over the fo4 mod that let you use it?
---
At my current CAMP I was spawning in on top of some  wild firecracker berries and found a solution.  
---
You can replace your CAMP machine in the exact same location, but with a different rotation, and you will spawn in at a different spot.  
---
This does erase your CAMP, storing all placed items. So it would be best to do this when first setting up a new CAMP. 
---
Another fun one for your list, evidently the AP perk cards are ballistic only.
---
Meh.
---
Only one from how it seems to currently work
---
She‚Äôs glitches sometimes and is impossible to kill. I‚Äôve seen it many times. A decent amount of heavy hitters who wail on her for 1/2 hour and barely make a dent. After a few minutes of not doing any damage, I usually drop the event and flux farm. No point in wasting ammo. 
---
You're title got me thinking you had built a penis house for some reason 
---
Well it honestly sounds like you *did* contribute, if only temporarily. So I'm fine with that. Dip your toe, great way to experience a part of the game that's new for you. But that's a lot different than when a Prime Fissure nuke is launched and the entire server flocks to hide in a barn, while 3-4 people do the actual fighting. *That's* the bullshit part.
---
And I did deal with it, I chased someone around with a measly Drill till they died ü§£
---
And you can charge it up for some extra ouch
---
You are right, but it's still frustrating that I then cannot claim Workshops and therefore get plans. 
---
And that's exactly what the other guy was saying. He had a regular weapon, non legendary, and no marsupial, so he couldn't jump on things to out range the glowing ones. You had the exact opposite, so of course it was easier.
---
I'm a stealth sniper with all the related mutations, and yeah I can go into a nuke zone with nothing but a hazmat suit and my TSE lever action and one shot everything to my heart's content. But i remember before I got the weapons and mutations, going into whitesprings when nuked was a very bad experience, basically spent most of the time running back to collect my junk.
---
I don't use the targetting HUD (database) and since the last patch I've been getting between 2 and 4 CTD's an hour.  
---
Before this patch I had not a single CTD.  
---
I really hope it stays that way.
---
Yeah if a high lvl player passes through the area is kinda hard. That is why I learned to love my shotgun and enforcer perk. take out the legs and even deathclaws are easy.
---
Again: that has to do with how explosive works, with shotguns, honestly the problem would solve if shotguns couldn't get the explosive modifier, as each pellet explodes, not just one per shot
---
K ill add ya and hop on ur game when your able meet at the church in flatwoods
---
Probably at the very least not this month. I suspect not for at least a couple months. But hopefully we'll get it relatively soon.
---
Gas mask?
---
Was farming Whitesprings nuke and a glowing one dropped it. 
---
Yah I know
---
Same (I started for 76Market)
---
It's good, but you can craft it yourself.  The dream is double damage to full health enemies legendary mod on a hunting rifle, only found one on a level 35 lever action
---
Oh, I've read some books on game design, I've wanted to be a dev for a long time now, I'm just not artistic, more of a 'number cruncher' type guy
---
What platform? 
---
Fully charging and aiming for limbs specifically, can give you an advantage. Tough enemies that have a broken leg can't out maneuver you, and breaking the right arm of an enemy can disable them from attacking with their weapons. (Granted, some animals will require more than one limb broken to keep them from attacking.)
---
Just a suggestion. 
---
You guys have got to make Belly of the Beast have more checkpoints. Please just put a checkpoint after we trace all of the signals. The cave you have to explore afterwards is HUGE. With disconnects being fairly common around the area, and the area getting nuked fairly commonly also, I don‚Äôt want to spend another 45 minutes getting back to the cave. This mission is already too hard for one player to complete, just help us out and add a checkpoint. 
---
There was a very popular mod for fo4 that basically transformed junk items into a single placeable decotation. It made you not hate the physics engine too.
---
Let's keep this in the groove, hey?
---
No worries, hang around making you some deep pocketed leather armour, but am out of leather, hence the jumping around the map
---
It's true fpsrpg gamer satisfaction
---
Yup, I went into it going "I wanna know how to cook ALL the things" and while I may not be absurd in combat, I can still contribute and have a ton of fun in the game
---
First of all: it's not.
---
With that out the way... basically somebody posted it here as an experiment to see how people lap up controversy about this game. And my god they did. It was literally one random guy saying it but it spread like mad. Pretty sure he later posted explaining this but it was all over youtube already.
---
It‚Äôs the details like this that makes this game so shit. Game feels like a skeleton
---
To be honest I'm not even sure what the levels really mean in this game. I have seen so much discrepency that the 95 is perhaps more symbolic for "hardcore". 
---
As it stands... we're the bullet sponges and enemies are getting one shot so something in the middle. Given we have access to more resources and human intelligence too ... making them harder would be nice. They can't jump or sneak. Tactically there really isn't much going on with the AI. Since this is the case I'd rather the game be more like Serious Sam level crazy-hard end game
---
The issue with damage resistance is how weird this game is with perks and such. If realistic ballistics were a thing I doubt any power armor would be able to withstand many gauss shots.
---
Pretty sure Mononga power plant also under-represents its available resources 
---
if you want to trade your tse hunting rifle for something else and your on ps4 hit me up - Chronic\_Coit.
---
I just figured energy weapons meant directed energy not kinetic energy. I understand what a gauss rifle is, but regardless of how the projectile is pushed, in the end its still kinetic energy. 
---
 It just made Melee the OP build like it has been all along..Melee build can get 10k dps legit but u know TES are op...when they really are not.
---
If you enjoy a game, then for you, it is a good game.
---
Good is an opinion, it's subjective.  Just like bad is.
---
I got hit with this after moving CAMP for 60% (I was told my Radtoad would move to the new location, but *nooope*), but everything but the non-"Stored" 10% of the alive-but-missing Radtoad thankfully went away on its own after about 4-5 days.
---
Odd, given I've always known it as common place. 
---
You know we use single hand sword, so you need 15 str to begin with.
---
And agi are for pistol dmg and ap regeneration. It's not suitable for stealth since We use Phantom Device.
---
the handmade plan only is buyable from vendors at a low level
---
i got the handmade plan from that one prison event when i was around lvl 180
---
We haven't started fighting each other yet in the canon of the games so it's fine.
---
There is the terrifying [Faschnacht Man Mask](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Faschnacht_Man_mask)
---
Been playing for over 200 hours and this is literally my first tse 
---
Want a kitty. :(
---
I can give you a hand if your on xb1
---
I added one to a level 40 set before I knew how rare they are. Took ages to get another when I made a level 50 set.
---
One ring to rule them all...
---
The range is actually insanely good
---
Really OGs will build their bases either in Cranberry Bog or Whitespring Resort. ^^^^^^^/s
---
Han is busy being spoilers.
---
Why do that when you can just 1 shot? Lel
---
Well neither did i but now we both know
---
Some people are like, "just get a mic," as if people either:
---
Can't afford it.
---
Have other people in the house that are sleeping, busy, etc, and can't talk loudly enough to warrant using a mic.
---
Have other reasons for not using a mic.
---
I think a "no mic" emote or icon would be great.
---
At least you got one lol. I have yet to get one.
---
It because all shotguns are broke. Shotgun shots 8 pellets that all get max damage per pellet.
---
If memory serves you spawn in facing the front of camp station at outer boundary of build zone.  Rotate it to where you want to spawn.
---
Fast travel mat is workshop only.  If you do teat builds of camps at workshops make sure NOT to include it in the BP or it will be workshop zone only.
---
There are many cans of coloured paint in the world... obvious really........... come on Bethesda
---
Damage reduction for them is not enough, i want them to drop some weapons &gt;:-(
---
oh yeah that doesn't happen for another decade or so, sorry my friend.
---
I need help getting brick plans, but am XB1 :/
---
I've been getting it too. I have same card btw but I don't think it's that.
---
I have lost 3 PA pieces, fairly certain I dropped two of them by pressing R accidentally, yet, no bag dang it. I fear it is just a matter of time until I lose a calibrated X01 leg, in which case a tantrum would likely follow. Also, a calibrated T60 mod seemed to disappear, I am quite certain it was not scrapped because I had crud loads of resources.
---
okay, so this is somewhat common. I wasn't sure what the issue was- whether it was the level of the queen or the tse weapons being "nerfed" (is that the correct term)?
---
Attacking your base isn't griefing its just pvp'ing.
---
Glad you enjoyed it though :)
---
Thats too bad i have spare actually
---
I had some dudes mini nuke my base yesterday but I just server hopped. I'm a level 95 and they were like in the 40s but I'm not a PvP type player. Base is still intact though ;). 
---
There's lots of reason to do it depending on how you play. Some people enjoy the end game grind and some people like me don't.
---
I'm on my 6th character and each one I roll I do something slightly different. Always in PA. Never in PA. Melee only. Ranged only. Stuff like that.
---
Try trading with others they might help you
---
"Felt like a first person multiplayer shooter"
---
So... Not like a Fallout game, then?
---
Maybe dead stuff spawning in when it loads the cell for you?  I've seen dead SB's do really strange things after fast travel.
---
I would be happy with even that at this point would make the game more immersive. I can't believe I never saw that app for fo4.
---
Even better is you don't have to get lucky with events for the plans. Just buy each one from MODUS, each level bought will unlock the next one. 
---
Well how do you get to level 50 and not find at least one legendary weapon is what i want to know.
---
I like the idea of Marie Kondo actively petitioning Bethesda demanding a higher stash box limit.
---
That's not bolt action, the bolt-action uses .308
---
/whispers:/ They're learning...
---
Right next door, in the dried out lake. I‚Äôve moved a few times and keep coming back
---
Okay now imagine your changes, your 2-4 hits is now 10-20 hits. They can chase you down faster and you stims are gone twice as fast if you don't get one shot or instadowned by rapid fire antiarmor.
---
Because whats the point in having a bunch of toys with fun effects, and different applications, if you're just running around one shotting crap with them TSE's? It just doesn't sound fun to me, especially with a lack of post endgame quests..
---
To show how much of a dick OP is...
---
I think any items placed in your camp would have to count against the budget, then this shouldn't too taxing on the servers..
---
I would love to have all my power armors on display.
---
What I hate is when I see a scorched with a really good gun then I kill it and it just has a pipe pistol or something else useless
---
It's all good, mate.
---
At 400 you can one shot anything but big animals (gulpers, deathclaw, hermit crabs) and super mutants. 
---
This can be easily achieved with mutations and perk cards with fist and 2h weapons.
---
With the right legendaries and a good 2h you can get enough damage to one shot super mutants
---
Outside of highly specialized (low hp drugged up)  builds this is the threshold of damage. 
---
If your intended targets are these use high damage. If your enemy can survive one hit speed then suddenly becomes very important. 
---
Tldr; get 400 alpha damage, then get swing speed increases. 
---
 
---
Just be sure to store your decontamination shower if you're sure your about to get bumped, they actually cost a bit to repair.
---
Glad you had fun.
---
Cool
---
Handmade drop from quests is possible but much more rare / less controllable, point was is some things do seem
---
Level locked
---
Yeah it puts it in your map just like when you use a survey tower.  It is gray so you can't fast travel to it.
---
I mean the game has been out for over two months so you cant be surprised if people are at level 200. I get what you mean about the people that was at a stupidly higher level early on but I don't see them around anymore, they must have gotten bored with doing the grind to get to those levels in the first place. There is a large majority of players that are 100-250 now which is pretty normal to see.
---
I am about level 140+ and I had never exploited or grinded the game. I took my time to explore, do all the storyline missions, build bases, build in workshops, collect things (bobbleheads and teddy bears :P ) and I felt like I was just playing pretty casually. Really there is no difference between a level 50 player and a level 500 player in terms of what skills they have or damage they deal etc because all guns and perks are maxed out after level 50. Really the only difference is players above 50 have more perk cards (that they cant equip) or have more points lying around not being used.
---
I do feel like we are due for some new features though. There has been a lot of fixes but not any new content/events etc. I would even settle for a bit more of a plan from Bethesda that details what they are looking to add and rough timelines of when they are expecting to implement them etc. 
---
I am still enjoying the game for the time being though.
---
You always had the power to just not use them if they were getting boring, idiot
---
You reported him?
---
Skyrim had this feature too, if you saw [a map with flag pins](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/File:Reunification_of_Skyrim_1.png) in it, you could click the pins to learn the locations on your own map.
---
I did a nice one inside the red monorail piece (The one just near Fort Defiance). Gotta say, it looks quite cool, and there is also a junk deposit near it as well. 
---
&gt; This is my first Fallout, and as I understand the lore and atmosphere, this game nails every bit of it.
---
Ooooh no, it shits on the lore.
---
Prepare your atoms
---
Toying with you're prey is more sastifying to myself, and the Interloper does too. A swift kill is not a thrill...
---
Yep that's the quest to get radshield. Best advice I can offer is to fall back and try to resupply, also try getting a big gun to deal with that deathclaw.
---
If you seek the bear, you shall find.
---
I ended up running into some guys who going to drop a nuke and they invited me to a team and helped me run through the quest. Ironically, the one dude killed me earlier on because I had a bounty for stealing someone's purified water. He was the one who pretty much showed me what to do. 
---
We ran through it pretty quick and I know I wouldn't be able to do it again. I'll just wait for other to drop nukes I guess. 
---
We did kill the scorch beast queen thing. First time I saw one of those. Shit was wild 
---
Yeah, those don't exist from what I've heard.
---
They really should though along with adding the enclave stuff into the lvl list via enclave events
---
What‚Äôs a duper?
---
What system are you on? 
---
For example my current mission has me going into the mine with 10+ Glowing Mole Miners all 40+ where my weapons don‚Äôt make a mark on them. That‚Äôs what my campaign is like
---
Oh that's awesome!, thanks for the help :). 
---
Outside of watoga to the northeast, where the two roads meet, there should be a spot where you can get both copper and gold extractors.
---
I love how the weather isn‚Äôt the same in all parts of the map
---
There is an option for "craftable items" to be the only thing displayed. 
---
This is a known bug. Others have recommended not fast traveling at the same time in order to prevent it. 
---
Please explain
---
It was a google search that lead me to a month old reddit post about it, after it happened.
---
Regardless, its common knowledge then it **should** have beed adressed in the last updates. Maybe its a harder fix then you would think.
---
But in all honesty lasers are poo poo compared to most other weapons, so i doubt a lot if people use them, making it not game breaking issue. In fact I was dumping weight using them so, i guess you could say its not a glitch... its a feature ;)
---
Marsupial isn't even that useful for killing mobs as most of them run away before you have a chance to hit them. Speed demon, eagle eyes, scaly skin would have been much better.
---
And how are you without a legendary weapon at this stage in the game?
---
And what are your perks? Do you have Adrenaline, bloody mess, crit perks? I don't know your build. How can I even comment on this. Do you have level 3 **Glow Sight**?
---
Scorchbeast sonic attacks are explosive damage. I use rank 3 fireproof and padded chest and take literally 0 damage from sonic blasts. Had 3 spawn on me and i just stood there and tanked them all while I crippled them down.
---
I‚Äôm able to sort by craft able items my pressing either the left or right control stick on PS4.   Of course I found this 2 weeks ago after playing since thanksgiving.
---
I don't understand when I see requests like this. Isn't the fact you're not using a mic and just using emotes enough for the other player to know you don't own a mic? Lol
---
Gotcha thanks, definitely not a memorable location to me lol, just pick a semi-interesting point on the map  
---
Me wondering why we don't have the blue paint job you see on all the posters for garahim mining....
---
I do miss people... but now i have my dog...so I'm good
---
WhiteSprings... some asshat left mattresses allover the top floor, so when I was getting swarmed by level 68 Ghouls, I accidently hit E next to a matress and proceeded with the ultra long animation which got me killed.
---
That is awesome.
---
All Rise. Lighter and does more damage.
---
Congrats. I still haven't found one and yet my friend got two in an hour. Considering buying one at this point üòÇ
---
Nice! I‚Äôm always short on violet. Lately for me unless it‚Äôs the queen fight, I‚Äôm just heading to nuke zones to pick the flowers!
---
Congrats. Also modifiable and cheap to fix.
---
The idea is worth a try, feel free to add me - Kramarite
---
I'm PC all the way and PvE. loving exploring and working through the quests. I play Aussie east coast times though. 
---
Will check it out on PC, I might be a dodo.
---
honestly i haven't used the chat mod since its first iteration since i decided that i don't actually want to be super social in 76, but i think it has a solid community.
---
i'd love to swap base tours with you too! i'll pm you.
---
This is literally the first enjoyable post I‚Äôve read about griefing. Well worth the read, thank you OP.
---
No, that he was able to oneshot every player. That's not how slap damage works. It's been pretty well proven.
---
PS4
---
Lots of places have them. Enclave bunker does too.
---
ü§£
---
I felt like I was in the fallout world with a deadly intelligent opponent. Like all the other fallout games were lacking.
---
Hell, if memory serves that was a bug in fo4 as well.  Kinda wish they just let us plug in a FC/PC and use it in death ray mode.  
---
They revised their statement. They are not removing two-shot, they are reducing it. But, whatever. Downvote reality. Maybe that will change it.
---
Good tip!
---
Decontamination shower? Damn. Got some plans to find.
---
&gt;Can't afford it.
---
I personally find that hard to believe when people are playing a (typically) $60 game on an expensive console ($300-500) or more expensive on pc. Pretty sure those people can't afford a $20 headset.
---
Plus people who just use emotes is enough for people to figure out others don't own a mic/aren't in a position to like you mentioned:
---
&gt;Have other people in the house that are sleeping, busy, etc, and can't talk loudly enough to warrant using a mic
---
you sure aboot that? i thought deathclaw hand(fist weapon) and assualtron blade(one handed) were the best in their types
---
tho legendary effects can alter which one you would end up using
---
Agreed.
---
Got one too. Took 300 rounds to kill 5 super mutants. Yay. 
---
I don't care anymore. People are forgetting this is an online game and Bethesda said it will be around forever. It needs a better endgame. 
---
So which party would it scale off of? I mean if there's 2 or more in watoga ect you're gonna have the same problem
---
PA unequips them oddly 
---
Some players keep talking to me and don't seem to figure it out for a while. Awkward
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Turrets
---
Going from normal sunny to the fallout area of a nuke is such a stark contrast. I almost feel relieved when I leave the fallout area. The devs did a great job creating an immersive world. I almost wish I had VR goggles just so I could really feel like I was in a PA lumbering across the wasteland.
---
Yeah...  at level 38 you‚Äôre not likely to have them. 
---
They‚Äôre a drop from the SBQ and require flux to make. 
---
Well I just seen a video last night, I guess you can have more so long as you have enough room 
---
I hate it when I‚Äôm at a vendor. Hi x to trade
---
Dur I‚Äôm in my popboy. Drop item...
---
Fuckfuckfuck paper bag?! Phew...
---
Your username I guess
---
Like warframe?
---
Ice Cube?
---
At 24. Ya know. The max server size üòÇ on a real though I wouldn't mind seeing an increase to 6 for some activities like raids and such
---
I thought DR was purely based on the level of the first player who initiates the Queen fight
---
The first thing ppl would do is building a giant dick (from wood?) so that it remains in F76 forever.
---
Holla.
---
[Here?](https://imgur.com/a/MxKRRjf)
---
Not even mad.
---
Had it happen yesterday in Whitesprings. Felt weird giving stuff to my invisible friend.
---
I prefer the medium speed weapons like black diamond or blade of basset, and can kill off most enemies in 2 hits, 1 if I'm sprinting.  Like you said, I land a lot more hits in the same amount of time as the 2 handed weapons.  
---
Gotta go, see you around!
---
Damn, this looks super cool! Love the lighting and decoration you have for the diner. It looks legit like a pre-existing structure in game. Are you opening for visitors? It‚Äôd be cool to have a tour at it in game =p
---
I mean whenever I don't feel like using my mic I just keep using the thumbs up emote. But most of the time when I see someone talking I just say hi.
---
Just curious, how old do they sound because whenever I see someone, the first thought I have is usually "I wonder if they have a mic/have it plugged it?" most people who aren't newbies know most players don't use their mics or don't immediately start talking to people. 
---
Also getting it when entering a building that loads, one of us is always goes invisible. If its my mate thats invisible, when I exit the building his body is standing in front of the door we entered, standing like a statue in a fighting pose.
---
Usually he has to log off the server and log back in to fix it.
---
We haven't had the fast travel one yet. Its getting tiring for one of us to log out/in several times a night.
---
I mean, it can be situational!
---
Maybe you want to get into a bare-knuckle brawl with a Level 91 Deathclaw with no weapons besides you standard fists? This'll let you do it!
---
Yeah I've had my camp on the cliff there by the copper deposit for weeks... Please don't nuke me.
---
Sounds great, just don‚Äôt invite scorchbeasts! 
---
Thanks! I'd like to help redefine the term.
---
Same, gotta wait 5 more levels until I can give it a shot
---
Those are the best for gaining HP though, beat them up one by one and then just respawn when they kill you.  
---
Sounds amazing. I‚Äôm m going to have to invest
---
Had this bug, weirded me out but fixed itself quickly
---
I can‚Äôt say either way cause‚Äô I‚Äôve never experienced anything like that, but there has been a lot of people talking about it, and I haven‚Äôt seen anything prove that slap damage has a cap, or how it‚Äôs defined. If slap damage has a cap at which is like 0.01% your weapon damage, then it‚Äôd be perfectly possible, hell even 0.0001%.
---
Again, I can‚Äôt say one way or the other, but I wouldn‚Äôt be all too suprised if it was possible through bobblehead stacking.
---
Stealth. It's the only way to play solo.
---
I really think they need to add chat bubbles, at the very least. Emotes are nice and all, and easy to monetize, but we still need communication tools that have been present in PC gaming for over a quarter of a century now. 
---
Guess I‚Äôve been lucky on PC not to have that happen.  I‚Äôve only really had positive experiences.
---
*We are learning animals.* \- Scorched
---
I think some of the fancier ones also require spec'ing into the low level energy or explosives as well. 
---
I did consider a non-PA build, but with so much investment in defence it leaves little for anything else.
---
Long ways off.
---
My quest has been bugged for about 2mo now. I send in a ticket every few weeks and only get told they are aware of the problem but lack the tools to fix.....and I get a guide. Also, from what Ive gathered the people on here that say their quest was fixed are PC players. Console players are screwed for now.
---
Hell, I'd pay 1000 atoms just to have them lmfao
---
lmaooo this brought back a serious memory of teen-me screaming into one ear of a pair of headphones because my mic died and I had a CS1.6 match that night
---
Like the tesla rifle? Still POed how odd the range on that is.
---
there you go... i didnt wanted neither ant queen to random spawn especially that she is a natural ''non mover'' so i think an event or new land with enormous hole and massive maze of tunnels will lead into her
---
Nah, i heard worked properly in 4 from a buddy. If it didnt... thats a pretty rough bug to not address.  At first i was thinking it worked as intended... like if you had enough cells you could death star blast the queen in one shot.
---
Like i said i dont care for cells, but maybe somebody reading this does and missed those posts you mentioned same as i did.
---
That I am not sure, this is too simple of a solution to fix all of the games issues. There will have to be tweaking. But I say it's better than nothing.
---
Even then... I scouted it, confirmed Ghouls, and launched the nuke. Mike Miners were spawning when I got there.
---
There‚Äôs usually one at Charleston Fire Dept.
---
I really want to move but i cant find an alternate spot that has a water source. I wish i could live on a cliff like that i love that concept
---
I see this all the time, or sometimes your teammate spawns in nothing but underwear. 
---
I walk around always wearing the ritual armor and mask. Makes me feel like somebody that has gone crazy in the aftermath of the war, just wandering around murdering things and picking up useless junk. Lol
---
Handy information thank you
---
razorgrain and.......steel? i think. required mats should be in the build menu.
---
If they had pets in the Atom shop I would make my first ever purchase. As someone who doesn‚Äôt care at all about what my character or my camp looks like there really isn‚Äôt anything in there now that interests me. My only request is that pets be unkillable because my heart can‚Äôt take that. I would pay real money for a pet that followed me around like Dog Meat did in FO4 (helping me by attacking enemies isn‚Äôt necessary, I just want a buddy.)
---
I know two people who have refused to give Bethesda an extra dime for the Atom Store, and both have said that this would be the thing that convinced them to. (They spent earned currency as they get it.)
---
Yeah in fallout 2 and tactics, gauss weapons were considered small guns (and the gauss minigun was a big gun). I think the issue happened within fallout 3 and NV...3 turned the gauss rifle into a single shot pulse rifle, and NV removed the small/big guns distinction and changed it to just guns, so weapons like the flamer had to commit to energy. Then in F4 for whatever reason they decided to turn it back to what it used to be, except they didn't fully commit and only transitioned halfway (with a smaller clip size and still counting as energy). 
---
The gauss is not the only victim of this, the repurposing of skills really caused some issues in the past couple games. Since F3 removed the ability to throw anything other than grenades, they removed the throwing skill and changed it to explosives (while still keeping big guns for the launchers). Then FNV decided to bring back throwing weapons but the throwing skill no longer existed, so they had to be classified as melee. Now F76 still has a distinction between big guns and other weapons (sort of; explosive launchers still only benefit from demolition expert), but weapons are also considered energy despite their actual classification (i.e flamer is a big gun again but treated as energy, tesla/gauss/laser/plasma rifles are considered rifles but also energy). There's just no consistency between the newer games
---
Shake your head in game. Plus get your broke ass a mic.
---
The death claw and asaultron blade are the only two plans I don't have so you're probably right ha. Now I have to spend all my time finding them lol thanks for that. It's weird though I mean I figured the Chinese blade would at least be more powerful than a basic meat hook. I'm getting +300 damage with just twisted muscles and a armor that increases 2 strength. All other blades barely get 200 damage. 
---
Oh im sorry I mean I cannot find it in the build menu. What section? But thanks for that ill collect some
---
Well I got the rose one to finally activate and so did a few more missions and now I'm stuck on the flavors of Mayhem part of it. I guess you're supposed to steal from a super mutant camp but it doesn't actually show up on the map.   
---
do you have the exact mats?  
---
I know when I am making shotgun shells or bulking items if i have the exact amount of plastic it sometimes doesnt let me make them.  
---
They did, its actually 2 gifs in the imgur links, shitty phone video but its there.
---
It‚Äôs the fertilizer producer under resources. 
---
Still goin?
---
Just decided to throw science at the walls to see what would stick - Cave Johnson 
---
I obviously need to up my stealth. In general it is my preferred way of playing. I am not a fan of melee or even shotguns - I don‚Äôt want to get that close to the enemies. 
---
Just ended
---
Love your name by the way ;). Still one of my fav movies. 
---
Yep many F4 on steam had posted same issue. Funny thing is I played F4 on my pc with no problems at all. 
---
Tried uninstall game and installing it at OS SSD. Game CTD again. 
---
So I made a ticket to Bethesda.  If I ever come up with a solution, I'll post it here. Till then I'm hoping for someone to suggest something new to try.
---
I dunno. I wouldn't wanna hurt their feelings. What if they find out we had a gathering via Instagram? It's probably better to invite them but downplay the event... make it sound boring so they stay home.
---
should be in rescources i think. it generates fertilizer.
---
Probably going to launch another soon though
---
Only use for cells I've had is tesla, which comicly enough is ballistic.  So I didn't fuss much when I dumped my stock, twice.
---
I built mine on the green nearest the Miner monument.  The Whitespring robots provide free security.
---
I understand your feelings and i respect them ( i have arachnophobia ) BUT the ants are here anyway AND if the queen will even gonna be added then she will be in one spot. As she is natural hive non mover ( shes in ant hive ONLY ) ...and you will avoid it that's it nobody needs to go where he doesn't want to in fallout 76 but additional content for others as a gamer should be approved by you IMO
---
Interested in selling?  If your on pc, heh
---
I feel like they did, I use to one or two shot enemies with my Tse. 50 cal but now I noticed it does less damage.. 
---
Nah I‚Äôm on Xbox lol
---
I guess I am simply not used to dying so frequently. I like to feel like I am making progress, and even if I am gaining experience, it doesn‚Äôt feel productive. I don‚Äôt mind grinding levels, but dying to do it feels less enjoyable.
---
Right now I'm using a regular spiked ski sword, just finishing the quest for the black diamond, and it seems to be out performing my legendary super sledge which has exterminators with 40% more power attack damage and 40% less damage when power attacking. I guess since I can only power attack twice before I run out of ap those effects dont come into play much.
---
You can just place small water purifiers, they just need dirt
---
Just loot any super mutant camp. There are plenty of raider camps in the nearby area and they have a good chance of spawning mutants (otherwise robots or maybe scorched). Try to loot the "main" chest before you kill off the mutants
---
Maybe, but the duping market has ensured that even the rarest of the super rare drops are now cheap and everywhere.
---
That is the second problem. Bethesda has not been able to get rid of their duping bugs and even if they do, there are so many out there already that they will be the mandatory dominant weapon until they are removed.
---
All good, Just had to ask. üòä  that‚Äôs a badass leveling weapon!
---
8% x 5 pieces equals 4%. Math seems legit lol
---
Ive heard pc is like that. Console on the other hand..
---
Im into that too! Maybe that give passive buffs!
---
Oh aha the user. Im not angry..  my 14 year old husky dog is. she runs the account
---
I‚Äôm finding the opposite 
---
Area gets swarmed by sub level 30 fuckers and ruins the whole queen run
---
Then they leave at 2mins left, and the health gets chunked off for all the high levels that are left.
---
25/75 success/fail from there...
---
Ok so I'll stick with my ski sword for now. Most still can survive my super sledge
---
I think it's just the server, all the servers I have played on[Xbox] damn near everyone shows up to take her down.
---
Would love an explosive melee weapon that just instakills you when you use it
---
Good video, What did you do exactly to farm the assassins/sentinel armor?
---
the items are going to rotate.. it‚Äòs no one time only thing
---
Not just change the enemies to a different variant but actually spawn mobs in the zone.  I dropped a nuke in a non-standard area just to get something different and we had all of 5 scorched.  I was able to get a ton of plants, but otherwise a complete bust.
---
You play this with your 8 yo that‚Äôs rad man 
---
It unequips all armor an it being nonessential I'd guess that has something to do with it. Can't cheat in power armor anyway. Hohoho\~
---
I've done to Camp so far one in Grafton and one in the dried-up riverbed. Neither worked
---
It did this to me earlier today, after a while it just works again.
---
Make sure all your junk is in one spot. Either your stash or on your person. It doesn't like to pull from multiple sources as of late.
---
Yes hours of fun even with the stuff that needs to be fixed
---
You gotta post it on fo76 not marke76, ppl join quick.  Just give ppl a 10 or 5 minute heads up before launching.
---
I choose not to go mainly due to the fact that for certain builds/weapons it‚Äôs basically an ammo dump. I used to go through like 2000 .50 cal rounds in my tse .50 mg every time. Now adays i use my tse harpoon gun and it‚Äôs a lot better but that‚Äôs my view from it
---
why is it marked down to that? store going out of business or something?
---
I really want a hockey mask for my Jason build (still looking for the right legendary machete too).
---
It is a feature. The bonuses are varied but inconsistent and some thing like most guns don't get them atm
---
You mean they need to add an "I'm broke and can't even afford a $15 headset/mic or can't even be bothered to use earbuds from my phone or I'm really just anti-social and really will come up with any reason not to talk to another live human being" emote. Do you mean one of those?
---
I'd never buy atoms for real money, but free atoms are plenty in f76
---
I was looking for a new spot yesterday and found one of the random shacks that's splattered around West Virginia.  To my surprise, it wasn't counted as a reserved location, and I could place my camp right there.  I didn't do it, but it's a concept that could be interesting to play around with.
---
Yea, XBox I‚Äôve gathered Is especially bad
---
I solo'd all the way to level 75. Stealth rifleman will keep you alive. Admittedly levels 20 to 35 are particularly difficult and grindy. But if you can get to 40 you'll be in clear, and have full access to the map without getting tuned by every mob you see.
---
This is beyond science.
---
Will do. Plans are especially valuable (not literally). Thanks!
---
I'm jealous. I was running an explosive pipe with fully ranked demo, rifles, and pistols for all the deeps. Never found a tse version. 
---
I would spend money on stash space, and maybe certain skins if they are really something I like. I would definitely like Excavator skins, but they'd have to be cool. I'd like a kind of Rose Raider look paint job. I'd also love that for my T-51b and all other PAs.
---
Just outside of flatwoods, between the town and the overseers camp. Not tons of traffic but its a nice location and gets just the right amount of new people and vets alike. 
---
I have one every 5 min of gameplay. Basically the game became unplayable since the last update. Reinstalled the game countless times, rebuilding the database doesn't do shit. I've stopped playing it with a hope they'd fix it one day but than maybe I won't be interested coming back at all. Must say, I don't even miss playing it and I always considered myself a fan of the entire fallout franchise. 
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking. And he‚Äôs level 75? I‚Äôm not even level 30 yet. 
---
you can farm the assualtrons in watoga to get the plans for the blade(and its mod plan) i dont even know if there's a plan for the deathclaw
---
Erm...
---
I have multiple characters with different SPECIAL allotments.
---
You cannot be a hand to hand fighter, a heavy gunner medic, and a stealth sniper on the same character even with every perk card unless you have tons of points banked up to change SPECIAL every time you feel like it.
---
Yes! This is the first online game I've played and I was so excited to "meet" people but I've only found someone to chat with once. I'm a lonely lone wanderer. 
---
Im proud clean player of fallout 76 never brought anything from market never sold anything.... i just have 3 game brothers and we share gear even the best ones ( recently i have given to my friend Quad/Explosive/faster movement while aiming western revolver ) . My opinion on the topic ? DONT BUY SELL LET IT DIE AND BE BANNED ( sorry but im just frustrated that all my hard work can be brought by real money and bullshit duped i have absolute ZERO understanding how people like dupers have fun )
---
What system?
---
Not a bad rule of thumb I guess.
---
Thanks for the input! time to farm Ultracite :)
---
It actually dropped it for me! Was super surprised. (I assume that means it picked it up.)
---
Cause ill trade for it or give you a crazy amount of caps for it
---
You can think of it as a hybird gun. It is energy gun and use energy gun perks but gives you the versatility vs. Ballistic resistance. 
---
Maybe it shouldn‚Äôt be changed but apply only +25% when appearing with other increasing effects (bloodied, execution, explosive, etc)
---
Cosmetic enhancement = Atom shop ... they could monetize this.  IF they ever realise no one is gonna spend $10 on a table cloth.  If they put a ton of small cosmetic items into the shop and charged 5 atoms each, they might get some people interested.  They might even get enough interest to make us stop resenting the hell out of the atom shop, and spend some real money.
---
It was indeed, mystery solved.
---
I adored the Mistress of Mystery quests. 
---
Ive never put much thought into the pvp aspect of the game. Shouldnt have dropped so many assassins parts into the whitesprings cooler!
---
You, sir, are not my ‚Äòhomie‚Äô.
---
Im on ps4 and when i had my camp near charlston, it was destroyed by lvl 120+ almost daily
---
It loos really cozy! I'd love to come tack a look sometime
---
And this is why you LISTEN to the quest not just usain bolt through everything. 
---
Kill 3 star legendary's. It's a extremely rare drop, most sets are duped.
---
We can only wish/hope
---
Might be time for me to go for X01. Found a nice set of 51 that ive just left in my stash unused 
---
Except there are no energy gun perks lol. That's why the break in 3 reloads. 
---
Those could be too far away. All of her quests bring you around parts of the savage divide. It took me two camps for it to work but it triggered on one of those abandoned raider camps near the top of the world (with the skull circle images on the map)
---
Maybe or it‚Äôs just a thing with leveling to keep OP weapons from low leveled players but it‚Äôs still annoying to be shot with a rpg then kill him and get a short rifle
---
It breaks in 5.0 seconds is how it works.
---
How do you build the excavator PA? I've been looking and nothing
---
Aren't they putting boosts into lunchboxes...
---
I had the issue of it not showing the mutants camp, just server hop and it should come up 
---
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Ask me how many times I've been killed by being at ground zero without getting the trophy.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it is. I have never actually seen one in real like though, lol.
---
What platform. I‚Äôm up to help.
---
Tis the same.   Also, if you are on ps4, pick up one for me &lt;3
---
"add additional spawn locations to areas that have a low density of enemies" is  already on the list. And yes its so weird being in a nuked zone with just a bunch of nuked flora.
---
Rad puppy!!!
---
Fuck this.
---
This sounds like it was made by someone who plays too much and is bored
---
Would love to see a video of this.  Sounds awesome.  Wouldn‚Äôt have guessed the range could get there.
---
Never seen a real one with an overcharge though. Might be a pet project one day, last one I made was about a decade ago, and the newer batteries could pump out the extra juice. Still not a feasible weapon to use IRL.  Fun for science and small plinking fun.
---
Oh geez so either console, that sucks.  
---
Coop fallout 4 would have been better than what we got.
---
Thats why i wouldnt mind eso style pets.
---
That‚Äôs 1/35 for a cosmetic item though. There are multiple cosmetic items that can drop. So that jacket specifically would be 0.03%
---
Yeah I get that, I‚Äôve killed tons of 3* legendaries but never got an assassins/sentinel piece.  I‚Äôve got maybe 2 pieces of sentinel at all. Just wondering where these guaranteed 3* legs are
---
I had to server hop a couple times before I got a marker on the map, led to a missile launcher that completed the quest.
---
Activate Windows
---
Ah, I have to open the links in brower to get them working on mobile.
---
We are an enclave general by the end of the game.  All it takes is for us to send a distress signal, vertibird shows up and we board.   Cue loading screen to a whole new dlc map and more traditional fallout environment.
---
$15? Amazon $6.74
---
Because no one needs their 56th copy of Ultracite Vent plans
---
The radio station should be stuck in a never ending public radio pledge drive. You take the radio station to stop it. Then you should be able to set the playlist by collecting holotape copies of all the songs in the game.
---
I could make some use of this head...
---
Yes. In the event with the wise mothman i always try to grab the bioluminescent fluid from the flyies,before they hit the ground.
---
Ok thank you.
---
Damn son! You're a wild man!
---
Yup! And you can only get one if you're above L15 and below L40.  (Though Bethesda acknowledged some issues with plans being incorrectly selected).  If it's not at Watoga all you need to do is log out and log back in a few times, if you're between those levels.  Out of 10 login attempts, I was able to buy 3 plans for the Handmade.
---
What's the point of gathering so many fluxes when you need so many of the rarer materials from nuked enemies? 
---
I know a lot of people who actively try to be nice and helpful, so I'm glad you met one.
---
Be careful about moving your CAMP. There used to be an issue where you wouldn't be able to place the blueprint if it contained items you can't build yourself; lately, I've heard that you might not be able to rebuild and place the items individually, either.
---
Some butthurt explosive shotgun user probably.
---
I have excess of 4kv caps from old defibrillators they usually give a ball bearing some get up and make holes motivation, 
---
I thought it was cute.
---
This is common as us advanced players we know how much it sucks not having a power armor station or a water purifier because you don't have the plans. I myself have only done this once I just placed all crafting stations and if I ever come accross a newbie building a camp I'll do it again. I also keep 2 extra stimpack plans so I can hook people up.
---
**Just don't scrap crafting stations on accident or you'll have to wait untill you find the plans to rebuild.
---
My experiences in this game have generally been positive and if someone's acting like a dummy I'll just server hop (why give them the satisfaction) plus it gives me a reason to check modus for x-01 mods
---
So you're saying you like the difficult where it's at right now I take it. Could have just said that without taking a jab at me.
---
Yeah, I want to be able to see my personal inventory, stash, and all weapon and armor conditions.
---
Someone already did it. They say nuke harpers ferry
---
Yeah people should be able to rampantly  cheat in all sports as well...'Just a game right?'
---
This idea again.it's not gonna happen.ever.
---
Dumbass
---
I play them on my home terminal, but I am a PC gamer, so that makes sense. Console players should get the option to play them on the TV. 
---
Try this with a chainsaw (and the corresponding weapon perk) for a nice surprise. (Make sure you actually try out the chainsaw instead of just looking at the stats.)
---
At the time , he might be at a higher level now 
---
This is going overboard. The amount of difficulty increase would require people with tons of bobble heads to up their op weapons damage to survive the onslaught
---
I never understand what people mean by this, but I guess that‚Äôs because as an unarmed build the only trees I really spec in are str, agi, and end
---
Nah. I mean, deaf gamers don't need to communicate, right?
---
How frustrating!  I guess you've logged a support ticket?  I sure would.  That platinum is a lot of work!
---
[Sell sell sell!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2uu6NF2inY)
---
I think so.
---
I think you can store the crafing stations even if you don't have plans
---
Anyone who is mute and/or deaf would like you to think a little harder before you say things.
---
Cry about it then?
---
Fuck this ... easy end game?
---
There are at least 10 emotes in the game. That should be enough for anyone. 
---
That's the one I need.
---
How I roll is I have a 3* instigating grognak, it has +1 str, +100% damage to full HP target, I forget the 3rd effect, its damage is 450~ when over repaired - melee weapons gain damage above 100% / artisan level (every weapon I pick up off kills is also artisan with my 13 luck and the boost from unyielding armors). I have a basic 1* executioner power fist that is 500 damage and I use via quick swap if anything survives the sneak attack I drop on it (combining instigation, ninja sneak, nerd rage, and adrenal reaction mute). 
---
Well, sometimes i feel like i'm his maid..  more often than not i have to be the one to replenish all the inventory to fix his armor, weapons, etc.  Preping for events, etc..  constantly reminding him he has to go out and get all the stuff he needs so he can finish a fight so he doesn't run out ammo or anything and always have a few backup weapons.  Thats why i'm a lower level than him.  Aye!!
---
I logged it just now.  Man, it's pretty hard to not be super irritated at this.  It took me 363 hours to get to this point. 
---
never exploited,  And pre white springa nerf you could get 10 levels in an hour with a good group.  I still can get 2 levels in an hour just dicking around before work in the morning.  It always seems anyone that isnt doing good as the next person is always accused of exploiting.  I run a heavy guns build and have found many explosive guns but no 2 shot.  I was sellling all my 100 percent legit junk and then had people yelling duper and slap attacking.  I have a base thats a maze with a dozen dead ends and any other was forces you to attack my base or fast travel.  That is if the flame throwers dont kill you.  Anyways. With being nearly 200 and getting screamed at I led everyone back there forced them to attack the base and walked away with over 1000 in bounties and didnt lose a thing.  
---
My point there are duper and exploiters.  But never doubt human perseverance.  My 2nd character took only 24 hours in game to hit level 50 with 0 white springs .  Thats with messing  around but I still hear the complaints how slow leveling is. Im not hardcore.  I have a 60 hour work week and play 2-3 hours at most on a day and hit nearly 200 and have stopped playing other than base building or pvping weeks ago.  
---
Jumped in a whitesprings to help some eager little kid last night and still managed 4 levels unused when I logged off.   Its all where you put time in at
---
What ever you decide, they both can be effective.
---
Hahaha .. really.. another "Is it worth it for xxx" thread?  I'd have paid full retail and be happy. Anyone who plays a game for 200+ hours can't complain they've had a bad deal.  
---
A couple shots to a car and it‚Äôs a mini nuke going off.  No way I‚Äôm getting in a death trap like that 
---
This is my first time commenting anything here or whatever, so I hope this is okay?
---
I'm on XBox One, my gamertag is Royal Octo.
---
The issue I'm having is as follows; upon loading into the game world, I can move freely. But when I attempt to open the Pip-Boy, it's missing. I'm not using the Quickboy overlay, and there's a huge chunk of arm missing, too. When this happens, I'm unable to exit the Pip-Boy. Occasionally it will load the model of the Pip-Boy, sans any intractable menus, and I'll still be unable to exit. Funnily enough, sometimes I CAN exit, and then I can't move at all, even though I can draw my weapon. I can't aim, fire, walk, look around. I can open the menu and fast travel, but the issue continues, even when I spawn after fast travelling. This oddly occurred most severely after dying in a PVP thing. I don't blame the other player for killing me, after all, it was to claim a workshop, but now I'm unable to play a game that, despite it's flaws, I genuinely love.
---
I'm hoping I'm not alone with this issue?
---
It's a really weird bug, and I only started noticing it lately. 
---
Hope this is okay to post!
---
It hit pretty close to home for me.
---
well there is something I am missing I just don't know what. I know its 75% dmg from sentinels and 8% from players. So 40% from players dmg reduction then a 75% from just standing there. which would give you 115% dmg reduction which wouldn't make sense. so you would have to round and -!5% each time. from the value of dmg you are taking. It's weird because it stacks but then it does not. but I see what u mean xD
---
What happens when you manually reequip the arm or other missing piece(s) from the apparel menu?
---
If they are tongs use in metallurgy it should weigh more
---
Or when you have a 5 cap bounty and nobody wants to kill you because your over leveled and overpowered and still let them kill you only to return and kill all of them hahaha 
---
Last night i wasn't paying attention,while in the atom shop,and bought the leather armor skin by mistake. 800 fing atom in the drain.
---
I don't even know if i could ask Bethesda to cancel the purchase.
---
2 Kababs especially if they are with lamb 
---
You need to investigate Garrahan Mining Headquarters after level 25.
---
Some derps with TSE shotties rolled up on my low level friends last night. They got slapped repeatedly by my  vamp fist
---
Bring that shit!!
---
I found the rings; now all I need to find is a wife.
---
XD I can be if you give me a chance ;)
---
I‚Äôll definitely try that. I figured it was just bugged out but I thought I‚Äôd cover my bases. Thanks!
---
IT IS NOW SCIENCE!!!!!!
---
I hate to tell you this, but that TSE MIRV was actually the propulsion unit of a Project Orion spaceship.
---
A few of the items are very close to exact, I‚Äôll go and collect a few extra just in case. Thank you!
---
This is definitely a work of art! 
---
They do. Battery included. Energy guns may be high maintenance but they are not useless. I carry 4 laser pistols with me and it's the only mean of combat I use and I have pretty much finished the game with no problems.
---
They always ruin the atmosphere though with their crazy lights and beats, I just want a nice gathering with my nuked buddies. 
---
I farmed the whole area of watoga and did awol armaments a lot as well as heart of the swamp. That's how I got the pieces. Those are my favorite events to do. 
---
It started with a furious Deathclaw gauntlet with +50% limb damage. After that, Clarence knew he had to HAVE THE WHOLE SET.
---
That did it for me as well and finished off all trophies, my first platinum on PS. Haha
---
hardcore rng though.  
---
The struggle with the stash is basically my game now. That's what I play every time I load it up. I juggle what I need to keep and what can go to vendors.
---
For junk I have a self imposed cap (anything over gets sold): semi-useful stuff like glass, steel and wood only has 1 bulk, more useful for me gets 2 bulk (leather, oil), rarer gets 10 bulk (aluminium, copper, gears), things that don't bulk have a limit of 40 before I sell them. Except ballistic fibre and screws. I keep as much of those as I can. Concrete and bone gets sold the moment I make it into bulk.
---
Oh and I try to keep down to about 100 springs. If I get too many I start crafting guns to scrap and learn mods for.
---
I have 2 sets of power armour in the stash and 2 on me as well (been meaning to sell one of them). Quite a few random cosmetic items as well because I like to change my look every few days.
---
Aid has 5 max of disease stuff. Important chems have 20 each stored (radaway, stims. Rad x only has 10). No food or water as I collect a ton.
---
200 max gunpowder is the only thing taking weight in Misc.
---
Luckily ammo doesn't weigh much but I only keep certain ammo types. If I pick up any of the following I leave them at a train station in a suitcase: .38, .44, 2mm, plasma, railway... A few others I don't remember too. Misiles and mini nukes I fire at distant mountains for fun.
---
Now. Weapons are the problem. I've found a few 2 shot guns in the game and I can't just give them to a vendor for like 100 caps. They are really good guns but the .50 cal and .308 machine guns weigh 20 each alone.
---
I usually submit a feedback ticket using the suggestion category on their support site. 
---
The small details are great I came accross a locked cage with a man and a dog in it I forgot the dogs name because it was like a month ago. About a week later I found a note about a guy who was pissed off and gonna get his dog back even if it kills him. Poor fella
---
Well, a cheap mic goes a long way. And wont gut your wallet either, it may also be in your control instead of relying on someone else to create a way to say you can't.
---
It re-equips like normal, but elongated hands still remain and can not exit Power Armor
---
Uhm, its metal working tongs.
---
Hey great conversation guy, bet your a full fledged liberal.  Just like them, when you dont agree on something they resort to insults.  Good job man, tnx for the downvote 
---
I was pretty sure it was a glitch too, it‚Äôs pretty funny that it happened on the last item though. Thank you!
---
Seriously though lol these kids are all whine whine whine come do this for me!!
---
Lol, that‚Äôs what Bethesda calls balance anyway. Looking at the tse guns!
---
That. Is. SICK!
---
The Follow me Emote but in Reverse. XD
---
why are you even looking for that garbage
---
All factions of Appalachia must unite to face this new threat the Sierra bravo queen can wait 
---
I bought one but also was able to get one from an enclave event. 
---
He's saying you have a dick in your anus. 
---
Tse haven't been nerfed yet, they added to here armor a while back. Plug her with a Syringer, the one with the armor penetration mod. Makes a big difference. 
---
"For most people" I'm pretty sure means for you. Where you getting these facts from? If you're not into it you're not into it. That's cool. But don't pull imaginary people out of thin air to back up your position.
---
No Super Duper?
---
I lost one weapon and I sworn never sold never dropped nothing out the norm just a 2 star Gatling but it was kinda the main backup 
---
 No.  To rebuild you have to blueprint your base.  This can get complicated because of map physics and such that prevent placing a blueprint down.  You can replace your camp almost anywhere, but recreating your base is not so easy.
---
Nah same issue here. I went with a fairly central C.A.M.P. location because it's free to fast travel to it and Vault 76. I got sick of rebuilding. Geography has a lot to do with it. If you bulid to fit a specific area the new area may not have the same clearance. Just one of those things we have to live with until they fix it 
---
Do u no de way, de way of de devil
---
Ok I'll try it, thanks!
---
You have to go into saved building iirc, it normally pops up as the default choice but not always. It should be the first option in the CAMP build menu (far left)
---
As everyone else said yes. When you purchase it, and learn it, it is titles as ‚Äúhandmade gun‚Äù. Once you attempt to craft it will still be handmade gun. It will only be a handmade rifle once you put a stock on it.
---
Everyone who plays seems to have social anxiety or something, theres literally hundreds of excuses I read why they won't/can't use a mic, just plug it in damnit!
---
It‚Äôs very south in the ash heap, I don‚Äôt know how far you‚Äôve gone in the game but it‚Äôs the charcoal colored area. If you look southeast in that area, you‚Äôll see those two towers.  And just south of those is Garragan Mining headquarters. There should be posters advertising the Excavator PA. If you read those it‚Äôll tell you what to do and you‚Äôll be able to craft it.
---
I mean, I have it, but I didn't think it works with armor. 
---
I don't think you read the post correctly. He is saying don't sell to dupers who have been banned.
---
Not gonna lie, I would buy disease cure off this guy. Like 100, that would be awesome.
---
Be cool if you could form "battalions" where your party of 4 is a team with another party. But you can only share perk cards with the 4 in your specific group. 
---
What if a friend hung around while you ran the silo? Might that sort of lock the spawn in?
---
Its part of the game.
---
There are things you make from the unprocessed flux, like orbital strike beacons.
---
^
---
you missed that you really should be running lone wanderer with this setup.
---
Dude, nice.
---
When it packs up, indivdual connected structures are stored as blueprint tab. So you move it, then if you hover over the stored blueprint, and you should see the whole house hologram to place.
---
Whether you will actually be able to place is kind of a toss up. Its often more then a little choosy about minor terrain issues.
---
You can also press Square (I think) to break the blueprint back into its component parts to place 1 at a time from the stored tab.
---
Bingo!
---
Kill some low level scorched and you'll find a few. 
---
That would have been a sight to behold. Cheers, sir.
---
Another bug or issue that has been known since day 1. Easiest assumption is,if it doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs going to be dlc.
---
That's fantastic. Are the cars pre-existing?
---
Thanks this worked
---
I usually do this when I log in a run all over the map with over 200 lbs of bundled goods , as well close to 50. Plus plans to sell to other players 
---
Lol I live in a warband clubhouse on a lead node in Toxic Valley on a moated irradiated ridge between a mutant encampment and the Space Station. I log in every day, turn on Scrapper, and scrap all the weapons from the mutant camp and the Scorched/Super Mutants spawning in the Space Station wreckage. Makes me a good 400/600 .50 cal rounds to start my war machine up in the morning. Clubhouse is mildly attractive on the outside but obviously strictly business, especially inside.
---
If you see a T-51b "Black Knight" on PS4 with a .50 MG (or Fat Man, Missile Launcher, Flamer, Auto-GL...etc.) it's probably me.
---
Also don't screw with my house, I have full wrecking ball, full demo, and an anti-armor MIRV Fat Man. Guy had a house down the hill and decided to shoot at my house with a missile launcher. I completely leveled his little fort with glee and two mini-nukes (he had two buildings).
---
Pile of wood. 
---
Please.
---
No. No. No. We don't need any MTX, ESPECIALLY ones that effect gameplay. Get the fuck outta here with this bullshit and learn to PLAY the game instead of just paying for everything. People like you are the reason EA attempted to have p2w lootboxes in BF2. Stop asking for this shit. If they add something like that in the game then the majority of the playerbase will quit, and then they won't be making ANY money apart from you and select few others who think similarly. Seriously, stop.
---
Got it - thanks!! Yeah it was really awesome that this person helped me. I think I want to move it around, it‚Äôs kinda close to the vault but I‚Äôm not risking it. 
---
Yes, I had a much higher player stop buy my habitat and left 6 or 7 plans I didnt have and some scrap in a brown paper bag. I didnt know what to do, I shrugged, and this player sent a PM welcoming me to the game and everything was extra and something about not wanting to hang on to them anymore. Very nice. But there is a real problem with high levels harassing low level players. Today, fortunately, this 193 was hitting me with a cue stick until I left. I was at a steel plant killing same level mobs...I dont understand why. As soon as I left I checked the map and the 193 also left... I didnt get to loot all the mobs I spent an hour killing. It's time I spent, not just a game. There needs to be some equality in the game to fight back.
---
Wow, they really designed that like shit. Thanks for the response all.
---

3 ppl attacking 3 ppl with tse loadouts is anything but griefing.
---
The elevators worked properly about two weeks ago. Now they‚Äôre unusable 
---
Ugh I love how those stairs turned out.
---
The existing scaling issue could be solved more easily by managing player lvls per server. Most pvp games have some sort of lvl matching per server.
---
Even using a generous min max lvl difference for sever assignment and gating would go a long way. That way you'd have servers exclusively for players under 30 say, then 50 etc.
---
It'd fix 100+ players running around farming every server, leaving max lvl creature spawns for low lvl players to get killed by
---
Never seen an explosive weapon under 45 how can this be ?

Oh btw, the bug is still active \^\^

The patrol event at the penitentiary on the north end of the forest also spits them out pretty reliably (and regardless of level).

Without testing just from my personal experience I THINK the way it works is 75% damage reduction and then a 40% reduction on the remaining 25%. So if a player would normally hit you for 100 it now does 10 damage. But in my experience I don‚Äôt take any damage but I have no idea how much of that is further mistagged by DR, dodgy, serendipity, evasive, fireproof, dense armor, etc.
---
Violet flux  is impossible to find in the Whitesprings area when it's nuked, but the Fissure Prime area is loaded, there's flash fern everywhere amongst the small groups of trees around.
---
I think Crimson Flux is the one I'm lacking in tbh.
---
Only two being used? I see excavator, ultracite, x-01, and t-51b being used by players, and i personally use t-60
---
Wait another month mate
---
Good stuff and critical fixes to garbage mechanics that should not be a thing...

Also, most recent patch introduced at least one game breaking bug to do with the pip boy (no button input but bring up map - actual trash, easily recreatable issue; no idea how it got through testing)

I've found 2 there constantly. However, the Spiked mod gan only be applied if you have the Melee Creation perk at level 4. You'd have to invest in that perk heavily and focus on being at least a 2hd/ranged weapon build.

You do not need wastland whisperer. I've gotten a sloth,rad toad &amp; deathclaw.... They can still kill it pretty easy when passive mode is on. I gave up after a while because people just kept killing it.

Pretty awesome, the cars definitely add to it, but must suck when they explode. 
---
You're an idiot.  First off I'm 38, not some noob kid.  Secondly, I did listen to what she said. It's not like she gives you exact coordinates longitude and latitude smartass.  It's not my fault that Bethesda can't make a game that's not full of bugs every single mission to complete.
---
Maybe they came from Harbor Freight.
---
Alright. My wife has taken over my system to watch Netflix at the moment but when she's done I will I screen shot your gt so I'll send it

They are in your guts and the acidity in your stomach is higher than alcohol. If they can live in you and cause problems drinking a lot of alcohol is going to fix it. It'll do more damage to your liver than anything.

if you need others to convince u to play the game, then dont bother, everyone has different reasons for why they may or may not still be playing, and by the sounds of it, you've already convinced yourself not to play it.

Very cool mate :) You've clearly put a lot of work into all these! Looking forward to seeing your next build

Hey, don't you shit on my collection.

I personally would spend money on it. You could grind free atoms all you want. I don't give a shit what you do. A lot of people spend money on games. And if Bethesda isn't getting it someone else is.
---
You dont have to American.  Did i strike a nerve bwahahahahah 
---
All it takes is making a larger "raid group" like in WoW (Blizzard and plenty of other devs have done this for the same reason, to prevent party-based buffs from overrunning the raid party-based ones and have wider support roles) which I'm sure will be implemented when they're not worried about 12-man armies overrunning the Forest as a raider warband, held in check only by the other high-level players' resistance to joining the snowball of chaos in a Fallout setting.
---
And to keep those raiders in check we need a "faction powers" system. Debuffs and buffs to game mechanics based on what faction you're in and with what faction you're dealing with. Not sure about anything else that could keep large groups of allied players from laying waste to everyone and everything if they wanted to.
---
I have 4 characters all above 50. Never had a problem with roses quests what so ever. Even in beta I ‚Äúlistened‚Äù to what I was told to do and I did it.

Longer/persistent world events are badly needed for the endgame!
---
If there arent any events or nukes it feels thoroughly empty 
---
Nope.but you obviously spend your time on the Internet trying to. 
---
No, people have gotten the lunchboxes from the Dev room and used them with no effects but enemies exploding in confetti. Why would they code that effect into lunchboxes we aren't supposed to have yet, and not the boosts? Maybe they initially were going to have those boosts as MTX and saw all the hate they would be getting for them and now they're just left over code?

ya 300+Hrs of farming.  I try to get stuff legit because as a none bs youtuber I have to keep chasing content constantly. Because I hate wasting peoples time with  rumors and speculation videos. It was a showcase as well of just the armor. But you are right about running perks with it.

Was it energy in f2? (Dont think so, though I'm not sure)

---
"Understand it's not griefing. It's within the bounds of the rules set within the game. Play chess. Get in the game."
---
I'm sorry but no. This is bullshit. Just because there's not rules explicitly against it doesn't mean it's not griefing. Griefing is about picking on people unprovoked just to get your shits and giggles. Doesn't matter if it's "part of the game." It's still childish people ruining someone else's fun for no reason. 
---
Yeah dunno what he is going on about, the issue is due to the last patch, they added a check to ensure that u dont clip into terrain and other objects when fast travelling, however it also affects tight areas like elevators unfortunately
---
The Treehouse Village? Or the Treetops?
---
Damn never noticed this before. Thanks for the tip
---
&gt;You play the way you want, the rest of us will play the way we want. If you‚Äôre bothered by low-level players being in there, oh well. Deal with it.
---
Well said, now its a case of not being able to play a game you purchased because of some self centred millennial.
---
How many full priced games do you know of that have MTX that effect gameplay? Really I'd like to know what company is making the money that you think is being spent on p2w MTX.
---
I like all of that! Having the original map and the expansion available simultaneously would be excellent. 
---
I think the biggest concern at that point is just the server situation. I suspect a large majority of players would head out to the new area, so the server capacity would need to be accommodate that. I don't know much about how hosting game worlds works, but it doesn't seem like one server could host both at the same time. Assuming that is correct, we'd then run into the issue of splitting up the servers between the two worlds, which I imagine would create a less-than-seamless transition from one to the other. It was also be a real bummer for those who pick up the game around the time that the expansion would be implemented; there won't be many people in WV!
---
I'm also unsure of how involved making a new map would be, but whatever they put out would need to be large enough for people not to be bumping into each other all the time. Previous DLC for Fallout games only needed to entertain one person at a time, which allowed the new area to be substantially smaller than the primary map, but just as detailed. It would be pretty frustrating to be stoked to play the new area and quests, only to show up and find most locations along the primary quest path are already looted. 
---
Just spit balling, sorry for the novel here! And for clarification, I do like the idea quite a bit and think it would be great to see done!
---
I never played much FO4 and thought for sure the paint cans were how your acquired new paints for things...that was a big disappointment 
---
good bot
---
Its summerville.
---
If you relog it'll show on the map
---
Yeah, he actually found it pretty humorous and started role playing as my "ghost pal". However, it was frustrating that he kept saying "hey come over here". üòÇ
---
If you‚Äôre desperate enough you can walk on the line from one of the cliffs the entire way and then get there without a loading screen
---
I remember reading a post about this I dont recall exact number but i think they said 20% if you suffer from all addictions
---
Are you fucking paid by BGS to make it look like actual players want this shit?
---
So cool!
---
They reward camp plans
---
Yes!!
---
I swear I saw these around LVL 15 and thought **"Handmade rifle?  WTF kind of rifle is made by hand, must be a POS pipe rifle variant.  ill keep my Combat rifle, THANK you very much!"** and walked away.  *Cries in high level*
---
And if someone comes along to take the workshop, it's PVP and you lose caps when you get killed (not just what you invested). Don't forget that.
---
if consoles got text chat, it would need to be through an app which I would love
---
I hear her voice
---
I‚Äôve never had the elevator work for me. And I‚Äôve never seen it work for anyone.
---
I'm loving the radiation lightning bolts, i want them to do closer to 1000 damage and give you a temporary debuff where you shock nearby players dealing 300 damage to them every zap. This debuff would apply for 3 in-game hours and persist even on logout.
---
From previous threads 'pretty reliably' needs to be qualified as 'pretty reliably for some people, sometimes, sort of, except not really" :)  Some people say it's happened to them frequently, others have followed that goddamn slow tin-ass mofo around for days and never seen a Handmade plan!
---
I shall start doing that thank you kind sir.
---
Also my camp is always open I like it when I can help out a fellow vault dweller
---
Ok, thanks. Glad to know it's known of. I guess I should consider myself lucky that it's the first time I've experienced it considering the hours I've logged.
---
No scorchbeast should EVER meat pile.  It isn‚Äôt realistic anyways to be honest.  
---
I'm in 3 fallout chat rooms not in reddit and there are still plenty of people that have a difficult time with aid items.
---
I on the other hand, know the beauty of chemist and super duper with stimpak recipe, canned dog food and nuka cola perks. I don't really have any problems. But a lot of people still don't know about such things or think it's as good
---
well that sucks for you then, because prior to the last patch it worked fine, for a lot of people
---
Two Shot Explosive Paddle Ball 
---
I had a house there too! it was a nice spot but I moved into a cave
---
Yeah having more stash space is totally pay to win. Just like that spaceman helmet that doesn't have the -2 perception. Totally pay to win., I bought one and then I was owning everybody.
---
Considering I was the one that advocated text chat in the first time I had hoped that the sarcasm was fairly dripping. 
---
Junon is a city in Final Fantasy VII, with a massive cannon coming out of it (City is staggered vertically). From one angle, it kinda looks like Junon, namely the first screenshot.
---
Welcome to Far Harbor Freight
---
I got a place way up north,  junk pile and a pond big enough for the industrial water purifier. Haven't regretted moving there yet. 
---
I moved back to the forest just because I need steel and couldn't find any good spots elsewhere
---
Just got the in game challenge completion for 76 weapons modded, no achievements for 50...
---
BTW if anyones on PS4 and wants to sell plans cheap, hit me up
---
Maybe it comes down to how much I despised the "Defend Settlements" quests in Fallout 4, but the Workshop equivalent in 76 is pretty fair.  After you initially take the Workshop, you'll typically have a Defend quest within a few minutes.  But after that, you should have at least an hour where nothing happens.  Both the taking and the defending can reward useful Plans.
---
The only thing I dislike about them, IMO, is any time Mole Rats get involved.  They are such buggy enemies, tunneling out of rooftops, or failing to dig up at all.  If I were Bethesda, I'd nix Mole Rats completely from all Workshop events.
---
Console bought a few years back when they had the money to do so. Game and/or internet time was a gift.
---
Or maybe they could just barely afford the game and now have nothing left for accessories.
---
It's unfair to just say, "Go get this or that" when you have NO idea what a person's circumstances are. That's my point.
---
Get off my lawn!
---
I haven‚Äôt gotten any camp plans for a while now. It‚Äôs just a chore I have to do every time I capture a camp 
---
I've experienced the underwear thing somewhat frequently, invisible was somehow (luckily) new.
---
Very literal.
---
T-60 is by far the cheapest to repair as well but pretty weak in protection.
---
I‚Äôm currently carrying a heap of bulk junk, but
---
I went to defend another players workshop to farm plans and xp. After I‚Äôd done I had a scavenge and found a level 3 safe to pick.
---
Dumbass move. It was inside the workshop zone so now I‚Äôm flagged, my stash is full and I‚Äôm carrying the only thing that can be lost on death. 
---
I‚Äôm waiting for one of my buddies to get online so I can transfer some gear safely. 
---
Oooohhhh, I forgot about that
---
I also lauched my first nuke today solo,but only low levels joined the event. I just grabbed some plants,as the queen was way out of reach for them.
---
Blueprint your core structure but not things like water purifiers, crops, fences, etc. that are sensitive to the topography.
---
Bru so beautiful. Like flower.
---
They're not pointless. You get a bunch of stuff for completing it, including caps, xp, items, etc. I would say increase them, have larger waves, with higher level enemies the longer you hold it and better rewards. Make it more fun and engaging.
---
Only if the character animation looks like the Stormtrooper tapping his helmet.
---
Theres an in game loading message that reads: 
---
"The raider groups of Appalachia were bloodthirsty psychopaths who terrorized the other survivors, taking whatever they wanted from them".
---
I've taken a few out of them on ps4 since the update
---
Or Mao Prime since it‚Äôs communist china
---
I recall pre-release them touting all the fun halloween masks they had while doing the in house beta... still haven't really seen them.
---
So when talking about the patch and it "ruining" these weapons. How exactly is it going to do that? From what I've seen the patch is ONLY limiting the Two-Shot modifier. 
---
Isn't explosive where a mass amount of the damage comes from? Particularly with shotguns?
---
I wear a T-51 helmet with my X-01 because I don‚Äôt like look of the other helmet. It also bumps physical resistance which is the X-01 lowest stat. With those pieces, the over repair bonus on PA and the grounded mutation, I am over 600 resistance on physical and energy and just south of 500 rad resistance. 
---
Thank-you, Jeeves.

He even duped some spoiled meat lol
---
Just got it, doesnt seem better than the 44 Western Revolver
---
You have to sexually assault at least five brahmin before you can obtain the plain.
---
I think you misread. I haven‚Äôt convinced myself to not play it. I would love to give another shot. But you can‚Äôt tell me that it‚Äôs not hard to filter through the flaming of the game and such. I‚Äôve watched some newer gameplay but most of the time it‚Äôs just people roasting it still. I‚Äôd love just some opinions of what people think. 
---
Plan: Brahmin Pen. 
---
Resources, fertilizer
---
Dude you on this all the time,  your on some anti duping rampage.  Like if it matters, you aint changing nothing.  Your nobody in this game just like me.  So stop with your sense of righteousness  and enjoy the game.  
---
An emote for "I am deaf, can't hear you" would be nice too, it's really awkward when someone keep talking to me and I have to message them to tell them I am deaf, an emote would be easier.
---
For me it flexes toward what legendary weapons I have obtained so far. It keeps gameplay a little bit more fun for me as I level up I will just adjust the build if it really needs it.
---
I'm lvl 46 with two shot explosive gauss (dmg 900 &amp; shotgun (dmg 660) they just do nothing to them, the fact they regenerate health slowly makes the encounters nothing but unfair
---
J42.... J42..... 
---
M‚Äôolerat
---
Just fix them.  They often take 15-20 minutes for me because one critter will be off, out of range, not even attacking the workshop and I have 9 seconds to get it's attention and get back in the area or lose the quest.  If they're actually happening as planned they'd be fine...
---
Lol. 
---
 Just the quickest view of your profile shows no comments or activity in this sub or any Fallout sub, for at least a month. Leading me to believe you've played this game for less than 10 hours. Id say you're opinion on this game is not only dead wrong but has no grounds.  
---
I honestly forgot i just rememeber i was in a place built on a tree. 
---
I like big butts and I cannot lie.
---
Go drink from the toilet 
---
It's probably already not a bug, but an Easter egg that's not really meant to be interacted with, just admired/speculated over. Bethesda's games tend to have a lot of Easter eggs like that.
---
You can find that shit in game too pal, and I don't care about it because you only need one. If they added a stach increase to the Atom Shop you could buy multiples of them and then you'd have a major advantage over people that can't afford them. Your idea is just downright bad. 
---
Because it really isnt worth it. Dumping hundreds of rounds of ammo into something and using up about a lot of aid items just to get the same shit reward for the 20th time. The reward isnt worth the effort
---
All fusion generators behave like this.l, and always have. They appear on and running even without the core.
---
The last patch reduced the spawn rates.
---
I just want a jetpack or a white/black paint.
---
Was that meant to be a double F$&amp;k F$&amp;k sake... üòÇ
---
How about you convince me to tell you why.
---
Could you imagine SBQ fights though?  Everyone would be shooting everyone's pets in the chaos.
---
Blueprints
---
Stimpaks 
---
Loot
---
Caps
---
There quite useful for farming meds...
---
I think your just upset a bit bruhda
---
I sold one exactly like that to a vendor today lol. Then later found another but 3 stars two shot.
---
Probably an assumption based on the fact that the Atom Store prices are extremely high like in a F2P game vs the low cost/high purchase scheme we see in games we paid $60 for.  
---
Which f4 already had an app.... so it‚Äôs certainly possible in the engine
---
You‚Äôre not alone.  Others have had the same issue.  I‚Äôm getting close to that point and I‚Äôll be very disappointed if I don‚Äôt get it.
---
Curious, do you have the trophy for reaching the earlier levels?  Are you using your same character from the beta?  
---
Yeah, I had to modify 70+, and hacked nearly as many before those unlocked.  I had assumed my B.E.T.A character was messing with the numbers total. 
---
But I distinctly made a new character at official launch to bypass this type of idiocy, and here I still am.  Angry that something as simple as reach level 100 can't be unlocked. 
---
This took a ridiculous amount of time as well. 
---
Obviously.  
---
This changes nothing about what I said.
---
It doesn't change interior cells, just building interiors, so the HS wouldn't change. For example, if you've been to Whitespring, the golf clubhouse is an "interior," but the main resort is an interior cell (and so isn't affected by nukes). If you load when entering it, it's not touched by nukes.
---
Fair nuff dawg
---
Why do you need to base your opinion on what everyone else is thinking? If you want to give it another shot go for it.. If not that's okay too. You don't need anyone to make decision for you.
---
Yeah, that perk is for creatures 
---

Good luck

The Quartering needed more content, he can only talk in a slow pedantic tone for so long before he runs out of stuff to say. 
---
Half these guys are only getting views if the video is outlandish enough
---
No i didn't misread, u are asking people to convince u to play the game, how about u just make up ur own mind, play it and see if its for u. But based on the fact that ur asking to be convinced suggests uve already convinced urself not to bother. Thats just my opinion on what u wrote.
---
I am currently trying to do this mission and I had 3 scorched beasts following me the entire time finally made it to the glass cave mine thing then my game crashed and when I loaded back in the mission wasn‚Äôt there any more it reset so I did it again got to the third part right before the glass cave mine thing then I crashed and couldn‚Äôt get back in. So I decided this is dumb so I started a new account then after about 1 hour I decide to go to my other account and the mission reset again surprise and this time i spawned in dead and turns out the place I needed to be for the mission was nuked so this is the gayest mission in the game hands down.
---
Thanks. That helped a lot!
---
The way you‚Äôre misusing you‚Äôre is the dark meat of wrong.
---
Purposefully using/keeping duped items is just as bad as duping them yourself, douchebag.
---
Shh
---
What advantage do I have having a stash filled with weapons that I don't use? No advantage whatsoever. You are talking crap. And you can buy it with free atoms, so there's no problem. Also people who have friends that play or multiple accounts can just use mules and put 2000 lbs of stuff on another character. So they have an advantage I don't. And I'm sick of being overencumbered. So I would pay real money or free atoms to increase my stash space. And I don't care what you think about it.
---
Same reason why that piece of gum weighs the same as a med-x.
---
Damn what a bargain! 
---
I pulled one each from Grafton and Watoga generators just last night
---
Negative, Ghost Rider. I like my pattern full.
---
 Eh debatable, they explain everything in game fairly well. It'd be better if they'd had altered skins and maybe different names for creatures. But that could all be explained as us being the ones who actually went around naming things and subsequent generations just carried on. 
---
Idk I'm an awful critic and totally expected to be appalled at the lore but wasn't disappointed like I thought I'd be. 
---
Pets are the tame able animals noobs
---
It definitely works with armor, I recently made a second suit of X-01 and after building everything, I had 2 helms and 2 right arms. 
---
I had the Excavator bug last week though, every time I left my armor and got back in the left leg would de equip. It has also randomly happened to my chest piece in T-60 but I could never get that to happen on command; the Excavator did it every single time on recently. 
---
I have all other trophies, and they unlocked as intended.  The modify weaponry and hacking terminals took 20+ additional successes to unlock. 
---
I did play the b.e.t.a, but not with this character. 
---
This character was made after official launch, as I assumed my b.e.t.a character would've been screwed for a platinum run. 
---
Why you blowing up camps? You can't be that out of stuff to do.
---
There was one quest that needed you to gather blue and yellow (I think) paint for the Wall at Fenway park. Other than that, they were useless.
---
I remember the Battlefront Companion App was great. The mini game that was in the app gave you credits which was great. But in addition to that the mini game itself was SO much fun. It was like an addicting strategy board game, and items you bought in game (like an upgraded jet pack, or something) would add to the mini game. If fo76 has that, it would be amazing.
---
I want a text chat cause i Don't want/will not use a mic‚Ä¶ :(
---
I've let the team know about it, thanks mate!
---
You forgot that radiation resistance exists and would dramatically reduce 500. Glowing ones do I think 85 rad damage per hit without resistance. 
---
Dont come back.  You're free.
---
Autocorrect. My bad
---
Nah. The text chats in every MMO game are fucking cancer ridden shitheaps of broken dreams.
---
The best bot
---
i was just in 3 SBQ fight in a row, lots of people, 2 i found by watching the silos being worked on, the last was announced here :)
---
All of them went good :D well not for the queen :D
---
Upvoting this. Please refer to the first bullet point.
---
That's cool, dude. You can opt out. The rules of the game gave you an out. 
---
It's just a gist. 
---
No. You either want to be here or you don't. It's not our job to handjob you back into it.
---
Now we're talking. Honestly though I have no idea what the levels on mobs actually mean as they're seemingly not very good indicators. 
---
Maybe you're thinking of tweezers? :)
---
It says standing and not moving, is that standing COMPLETELY still or can you turn around and aim while not actually walking?
---
This makes me so sad we didn't get these in the game but I'll hold onto hope that they add them in the future.
---
Cowabunga it is
---
Vault Boy with a big X over his mouth
---
Will do. Thanks for tagging me mate!
---
I identify as a Tonka truck.
---
For what it's worth, I pretty much dumped two-handed in favor of one-handed after I found a 3\* Instigating Combat Knife.
---
You hit *so much faster* with a knife, and higher-level enemies still have that Fallout 4 thing where they can shrug off rocket-powered hammers with the back of their arm.  The sooner you can get off another shot, the better.  Plus, the stab often staggers them anyway, so if you have Martial Artist, you'll go stab-crazy and they can't do anything about it.
---
I want a pet Radroach. Even just a small one as a shoulder cosmetic or something.
---
Keep holding out.  Much like fortnite, this over priced piece of shit will be free soon enough. 
---
TS Fatman is good as fuck, B.
---
Still will be after the nerfs.
---
Make a offer?
---
Xbox
---
You said to drop mines. Does anyone know how long these persist in game? Like, can I drop them, and if they don't go off they will be there the next time I log into a server?
---
MANNNN wish it was ps4üòπüòπüòπ
---
is just found a lv11 , dead and under the queens corps, no ider why he diden't re spawn and how the heck he even made it to the fight, lol :) well, ar least he tried, hahaha
---
was also a lv27 rouning around, but we did get the SBG, with onoy 2 mins left on the clock...
---
How about not having to go out and farm as often as people without all that extra space? We all paid full price for this game and you are literally the only person I've seen that wants game effecting MTX in this game. Fuck, I know a lot of people that refused to buy 76 just because it had cosmetic MTX.
---
Gimme that blackbirb excavator, son.
---
Interesting.  I hope it will unlock at a future level. 
---
Don't worry, i only test on customers i don't like.
---
Ummmm yeah just ignore literally hundreds of posts by people online
---
I found a 3 star lv50 vampire's weightless walking cane with 40% faster swing that outperforms my lv45 blade of bastet or black diamond. I soloed my first silo with that thing.
---
I'm restricting myself to 1-handed melee and non-auto pistols for this character. So I want to make the most of it until I find something better, and even then I'll probably keep it as a backup weapon because it's weightless.
---
grafton and watoga
---
How the heck did that title make it past the bot?
---
I have to wonder if all the dead are the previous guests who didnt get out after all.
---
*Hello **Plan: Ultracite Explosive Vents***
---
There is quite a few masks. You just need to explore more
---
See this is the kind of unlocked we need in this game!
---
Must be just bad luck on my part then.
---
Whats the best item you got from both?
---
Well crap you just answered my question! No way I would sell it. After getting nothing but wood armor, robot and other stupid weapons with garbage stats and low level....I believe I hit a small jackpot lol!
---
Also, mods scrap before bulk junk and only aluminum and lead save weight when bulked.
---
Yep.
---
This is very, very helpful information. Thank you mate. I'm sharing this thread with the team
---
You're like a Nick Valentine when we expect a Protectron.
---
Better than the 3 scorchbeast defend event. Absolutely not worth it. Just bullet sponges for a rug plan. 
---
I mean, I don't think it's necessary to get a headset, but headsets are cheap. Most of the time the emotes are enough for a random encounter with someone. But if you want to make friends and talk with others over multiple sessions it's obviously a necessity. 
---
Theres quite a few masks in the world, get out there and explore.
---
Yeah I still have to mod it up. I need steel which is easy to get
---
How do you get the plan for the artillery 
---
Perhaps they could scale their frequency to the total defense value of your workshop?
---
You mean those things that take half a year to activate and then do ~4 damage overal?
---
Ye i personally just threw it out
---
&gt;collection
---
?! How many?? Fuckers weigh .25 per plan, haha
---
I leave them in vendor cash registers...
---
Ur a Christmas Ornament? Who buried you?
---
Because im helping
---
Can confirm on xbox at least that it only broke after last patch. 
---
It can‚Äôt appear with bloodied or execution as they are also primary effects 
---
Yeah because Fortnite and GTA Online are such epic flops with MTX. Um no, they are two of the most profitable games in history.
---
I built on the golf court there but ghouls and scorched keep spawning like mad and the security cant handle it 
---
Idiotic posts about it, followed up by posts like yours... Keeping the term trending.
---
Please stop.
---
You underestimate humans.
---
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the snarkiest of them all?
---
You are, my dear.
---
Quick Note: the building sets I needed for this were Advanced Power Connectors and Rolling Metal Doors. I don't know if you need the Barn Building Set mentioned by others above, but I have it and the system works. I think you can also do this with a pressure plate but I haven't messed around with em yet so I can't tell ya.
---
I was able to get it to work like this using the Wooden powered door with keypad access.
---
Components:
---
Powered door with keypad access-wooden
---
Simple Switch (the blue one)
---
Keypad pylon
---
Mostly using the simple witch as a junction. You could probably do it without it but this is the way I've tested that works.
---
1. Simple switch is wired to main power and left in the 'on' position. From there it runs to the switch on the door and the keypad pylon.
---
2. The keypad pylon is wired to the door itself.
---
Hitting the switched pylon code will open the door temporarily from the inside. The switch on the door actually does work in that it does what it's supposed to (I imagine?) which is control whether the door opens. You can't manually switch it to open the door, but it audibly clicks off and back on when you hit the keypad on the door.
---
Essentially the built-in door switch can be wired to continuous power without forcing the door to be open all the time, which is what you run into if you try to use another simple switch. This is because it's set automatically to off AND the only way to get it to send an 'on' signal and open the door is to enter the correct keycode outside.
---
Convoluted and I don't know if someone has already solved this problem at some point but it got me thinking and I got it working.
---
Signal chain goes like this:
---
Simple switch-&gt;keypad pylon
---
Simple switch-&gt;door switch
---
Keypad pylon-&gt;door
---
And that should get you working. Again, hope this helps somebody out.
---
I had this just yesterday for the first time. My friend completely invisible. Funny thing was, when he exited his power armor it would phase into existance. He'd get back in and it would phase out. Weird to watch! I relogged and that fixed it
---
BOS mods for combat armor from grafton, also saw the lever action rifle plan but couldnt buy it.
---
Watoga was more camping plans like advanced power connectors and brick set.
---
I have not been to harpers ferry yet.
---
Error. Spawns normally with 3 dead traveling merchants with a deathclaw by the corpses. This is the glitched and more common version
---
While I agree they are great, my power armor just doesnt have room for 30 vents per leg
---
Sweet! I haven't been to Grafton yet. I'll have to check it out soon. Thanks!
---
Nah. Means you have to throw the nukes yourself. Adds an unnecessary 30 minute bunker run. 
---
Step 1: farm whitespring for ~50 hardened mass, glowing mass and the fluids. Stash them away. 
---
Step 2: find any old SBQ aftermath and collect it from 
---
a. The trees and log pile just due east of the grove, but really all around the tall trees if you run in a broad circle around the grove.
---
b. The trees just south of the train yard 
---
c. The trees just east and northeast of dropaite D9.
---
d. Around the forward station SE of watoga train. 
---
If you aim your nuke like a decent person, you can get all of them (and the prime site for the SBQ). 
---
Farm around 50-70 flux for a poorly placed drop, or around 110-120 flux per good drop. 
---
I haven‚Äôt seen a more efficient way. 
---
My camp is permanently residing beside one of the missile launching sites, I believe bravo, I like it there, it's not finished yet sadly, as my friend who also played stopped.
---
What if they just had your mouth wrapped in bandages or something (or the PA moth/speaker looked busted) if there was no mic present?
---
That's good to hear, I am glad it worked out for you. I have a bit of a compulsion to shoot down drones. I don't need the nuke cards, I just have a need to shoot them down :P
---
Omg the crosseye... The glasses... Thank you I'm dying. I find this way funnier than I should tbh.
---
Agreed. It was a fair trade.
---
Attacking a base at all has been called "griefing" on this forum. I thought it was a great fight. I'm attempting to redefine the term.
---
Like I said though, I'll stick it out when it's a 3v1. I promise.
---
I was using it on my melee characters even at level 2 i definitely noticed a difference.
---
in that case just to let you know there are 2. one at train station and another in a building.
---
That's awesome. I thought about building my CAMP at Solomon Pond but didn't want to be bothered by the natives. How do you deal with them? Do they constantly try to break in?
---
....or the duped meat he had spoiled.
---
It's one of the things that renders certain guns (and entire perk trees) so uncompetitive that you just don't see them being used.  Some guns break too fast, some do too little damage, some chew through mountains of obscure ammo.. you'll find lots of people agree with you on this one.
---
I think the large bed in the top floor of the hunting lodge has two mattresses
---
It looks like a hairless squirrel and a flying fish had a baby, and that baby has explosive diarrhea.
---
Both of those games are free, hence why they can have MTX in them and nobody cares. Same with mobile games. WE ALREADY PAID FULL PRICE FOR THIS. Them adding a paid stash increase would just be content locked behind a pay wall.
---
Also there‚Äôs one on the sound side of summersville on a bench with a guy who got rejected
---
Platform?
---
The way I see it, "Energy Weapon" is kind of a catch-all for all of the "sci-fi" guns.  It is confusing, but I really don't know a better way they could phrase it.
---
But then what about people who want to play with friends of a lower level, still the same problem with high level enemies for you lower level squadmates to deal with. And even on solo, there would be no newer players to give already learned schematics and extra ammo to. I do enjoy giving my useless things to people who still need them.
---
Harder to farm, though. Not as great respawn rates seems like.
---
I would I just hopped off. Xbox right? 
---
I will, off of the top of your head do you know a static spawn for the chainsaw?
---
Things like the BoS existing... 
---
Not this bug, sorry.
---
Often when I log in, my weapon will be showing however many shots were showing when I logged out, but if I try to shoot at that point in time, the display will update to 000 and my weapon will automatically reload.
---
You should be able to craft a board with nails in it from the beginning, as early as lvl 2. It's a little weaker than fire axe, but not significantly. 
---
Fire axes I typically get from Scorched. Usually around lvl 5 at Morgantown Airport. There's also an event there, at the east end of the airport, I forget the name, where waves of Scorched come. I often get multiple fire axes there. 
---
Plans you can buy from responder vendor bots, but it's random. Sometimes it takes a lot of server-hopping to get them to show up. They are also awarded by random events, but again very random, you can do a hundred and not get them.
---
I wouldn't call that stupid - it's a really subtle and easily overlooked feature.  I didn't know about it until I had already discovered them all.
---
PC?  
---
Me too! Same type, same part
---
You do have a mic. Every controller comes with one. So you really need one that says ‚ÄúI have a mic but I don‚Äôt want to talk to you.‚Äù
---
I actually got one from the supply drop at the Responders air port! Ill have to make sure I take screen captures and share his progress. 
---
Two shot 5 cal with the extra damage to workshop items works pretty well. 
---
Making sure they are now. Thanks for tagging me mate.
---
You can buy mutations serums from people for dirt cheap
---
XBOX, my bad. Usually put that in there 
---
Nah you have to buy GTA V full price game. And I also bought the highest tier Founders edition of Fortnight before it even went free to play with that Battle Royale BS. So wrong, and wrong again.
---
They‚Äôll probably sell t on the Atomic Shop like other useful emotes like the I‚Äôm starving or I‚Äôm dehydrated emotes.
---
nope sry
---
I feel your pain brother.  I know where you need to go, and ill commit my weapons to your cause if youd like a sherpa to help get it done fast.
---
womp womp, jealous much.

 &gt; Making sure they are now. Thanks for tagging me mate.
---
One of the nicest camps I've seen yet. 
---
u can aim and be fine while looking left to right. reloading counts as moving though for some reason
---
Or not, if you're on PC... 
---
I got one mutation I wanted from the toxic water at the whitespring spa, then bought the other two.
---
Roger that 
---
I love habor freight. Nothing like having 12 extra tarps at home 
---
No, aside from paying for serums, around 4.5-5k from Enclave vendor, or as low as 500-1,500 from players. Though players often don't have all the serums on hand.
---
I've been using two approaches. On my melee char, only a handful of mutations were very, very bad (Empath, Herd Mentality, Electrically Charged). So what I did was get ALL mutations. And then started taking them off. If I took off the one I liked, I could immediately get it back. And even if I took one I didn't like, followed by one I liked, odds were I would get the good one back, immediately, half the time. It...sort of worked. 
---
On the other hand, with my rifles char, I only needed a few. So I worked RNG until I got 3 good ones, and no bad ones. And I paid for serums for the remaining 2 I needed. 
---
yes please 
---
My complaint with the two shot nerf (and only the two shot, TSE absolutely needed it, but not either by themselves) is that it has taken any point out of playing the game any further for me.
---
Given the low damage output of all the guns I was forever running out of ammo and moved into practically melee only between levels 20-60, I finally found a two shot handmade last week, which far from being overpowered (still only two thirds the damage of my sledge) has finally made using any guns *at all* worthwhile again. The only thing really keeping me going at this point was the drive for better weapons (lvl 70ish, done with quests).
---
Now they are making my gun that took me 70 levels to find close to useless, along with most other ballistic weapons, I just have no desire whatsoever to play any more. If I am not going to find anything much better than what I have already I am done with the game, there is practically no end game content other than grinding for better legendary weapons and they have just killed that.
---
I understand why they chose to do it, but in my opinion is should have been fixed by just making it so TS and E couldn't be on the same weapon and leave the individual effects alone, as it is I am done and off to play something else. I have no real complaints or opinions with the rest of the changes.
---
I regularly see that plan from Forest treasure map locations.
---
That's the thing I hate about this game.
---
They want players to interact then make you wanted when you do. Now the entire game comes at you en masse. Great job with the overkill Bethesda. Now people exploit the gaming mechanism to rob you.
---
I was at Whitesprings killing glowing ones and when I threw a landmine into a room of them a duo took action on me. One of them purposely ran into the room getting injured causing me to be wanted as if I was shooting him.
---
The other one immediately 2 shotted me and took all my shit and left the server.
---
this as well
---
Or how about an "I surrender" symbol to show those who would kill you that you mean no harm?
---
I would use that spot, but I want my camp to be near watoga and the cranberry bog so I can spend less caps fast traveling. If I make a new character tho I'll definetly use it, thanks for sharing.
---
My personal shotgun, irl, loads from the bottom. It's a pump.
---
It's not griefing, it's a game mechanic. 
---
Git good
---
Also make it not flip over to 24999 when accidentally set prices lower then 0
---
It‚Äôs not anywhere else this ‚Äúfeature‚Äù but in trade - so annoying 
---
I wish they had just made another single player fo5 tbh. This has been a rough launch
---
You may have struck (what I think is) the same bug as me. I was able to do Patrol Duty once, about a week or so after the launch of the game. Then after that point, I wasn't able to do Patrol Duty for weeks - I tried server hopping, waiting around the area for hours (but not in the area, just returning to it every now and then), and checking the map to see if someone else had spawned it.
---
Then one day when I logged in, the event was active from some other players, I joined in and finished it, and ever since then, it spawns fairly regularly for me - I have my camp set up nearby, so I fast travel to it every now and then to check if it spawns.
---
We sell serums for 150c. GT MadDogMolina
---
The building to the West of Mama Dolce's
---
Sell it lol.
---
Bethesda fucked this game up big time with that latest patch. Between being booted from the server and the awful loading time to get back in I'm spending half my time doing nothing.
---
This. They "fixed" Mama Dolce's, but I always felt that was the best thing they could have had. High levels came in and did it just because it helped everyone. It was an inadvertant meeting place, because someone was always helping out at Mama Dolce's.
---
&gt; This game is terrible.....IF you are narrowminded...This is my first Fallout,
---
Heh.
---
All I ever hear from your whiners is pay walls and pay to win. You don't even know the meaning of the word. Maybe you should check out some Korean MMOs if you want to know the real meaning of the words.
---
With a big ol smile :)
---
*go the fuck away*
---
You know, Fallout 76 has been a really interesting study of the "fake news" phenomenon.  Most of the time, people target Facebook and Twitter for spreading it.  But YouTube has really flown under the radar in terms of how easy it is to spread willful disinformation, because their algorithm is all about keeping you mired in controversy, and therefore watching.  Every time I talk about 76 with skeptical friends, they'll often cite YouTube videos as the reason for their continued skepticism.
---
Why would I be jealous? Infinite crafting/consumables would be as boring as god-mode to me. 
---
I think there should be a Fire Breather Skin for it as notes explicitly mention that they recommended members to look for the plans or any existing suits for use due to their protective properties.
---
Yeah thats how pumps reload with the internal tube magazine.  Next youll be telling me black powder rifles exist...
---
It's nerfing the explosive part too.
---
I've noticed the same thing. Particularly in "fresh" areas where they shouldn't have been taken already. 
---
Shells go in the bottom and out the side brother.
---
I can consistently make my head do that in game by equipping a hat that i have two of (like two identical clown hats) and then switching to another hat.
---
Me and my homie on our way. We are participators. :)
---
Oh, duh
---
You want an Endangerol Syringer for the effect. 
---
I hear you.  This morning I was greeted with an empty slot on my radial menu.  Where is my trusty Shotgun?  Scrapped, apparently.  One of this morning's quests was finding and modifying a new replacement.
---
Fortunately, as you get more Legendary gear, it becomes harder to do this.  My Shotgun is the only weapon that isn't at this point.
---
OP has the most confusing thread and comment history i have ever run across
---
Is it a bot that likes to pair numbers with random games and make topics?!
---
The sneak card is completely eclipsed by shadowed armor mods.
---
This is how they work. Nothing to fix.
---
A confirmation dialogue box would cover this.
---
A new black powder rifle should be easy enough to get. Try Pickett's Fort or the Harper's Ferry vendor. If you want plans, try the vendors inside the Whitespring.
---
I'm not saying I have over 400 hours, but it's a lot.
---
Don‚Äôt kill it before I get in
---
Which is probably why it's not enabled 
---
They amended the initial post. Two-shot is being adjusted to have the extra shot deal only 25% weapon damage, and the Explosive modifier is going to deal only 20% of the weapon‚Äôs damage as explosive. 
---
Exploring will bring you a lot of cool quests. 
---
Not sure why someone would downvote you for actually trying to help.
---
Ah. Thanks I missed the bit about explosive. Thanks for the info.
---
Do you imagine the shells loading into the ejection port?
---
Get a mic
---
This is rezzing an old post, but this was the first thing that pops up when Googling.
---
Unless these are bugs:
---
I've had cap limits reset after just a few hours (+/-). So is it 24 hours in-game? Is there a threshold at which it resets? I worked nights at the time it reset after just a few hours. I wonder if it's similar to how mobile games do timers ie 24 real hours if not playing or 4 hours if logged in and playing. This is after the Jan 15th patch (PS4).
---
The very first time I went to the Watoga vendor it had 0 caps. Even after I swapped servers, it showed 0.
---
While cap limits are directly connected to the player, items being sold are shared between all players on that server, at least plans are. A teammate bought a plan, then I could no longer see it. A random also bought a plan after I had looked.
---
Interesting. I just reached 50 with my original highest character and am starting to learn the basics for legendary star items a little more. From what I see so far we are up in arms in general because tse is sort of absurb but by themselves would lose relevance and not be fun to use after being reduced
---
700 caps and that's generous for what they are actually worth.
---
I'm a blacksmith in real life and some of my tongs are pretty heavy... 
---
Well, some are worse than others.
---
I believe they all draw from the same prize pool, so it's not like you need to take difficult Workshops like Abandoned Bog Town.  I typically end up picking ones in the Forest.
---
You completely over look at how much isn't enable it's in there and they went oh let's not turn all this stuff on yet. 
---
Fuck the original post, OP, that deserves an upvote right there.
---
Let us all gingerly touch our tips.
---
I tracked down another but it‚Äôs lower level :/ know any way to guarantee I‚Äôll find a higher level one? Would buying the plans allow me to craft one to the highest level relative to mine?
---
Yeah, but it makes perfect sense now. Weird. Guess I'm just one of those guys that just has a long-standing brain derp. Apologies for the confusion.
---
There is no problem, you just dont know how pump action shotguns work. 
---
[Here is a decent visual](https://youtu.be/M9RJhI2EMI8?t=23)
---
Oh...
---
Wow, I'm dumb.
---
Yes I did become wanted.
---
When the guy ran into the room when the landmine exploded it told me firing on other players can cause me to become wanted. I looked on the map and there I was red and wanted. Then I died immediately from his bro.
---
No worries man. 
---
You learn something new everyday!
---
Download the Xbox app. Chatting is as easy as texting on your phone. 
---
South east of vault 76. I dunno just google it.. 
---
You see, people farm whitesprings golf club for legendary items dropped by ghouls. There are many ghouls in this location so people build camps at the back of the building and turrets high enough so it targets the ghouls on the top and bottom level. The player doesn‚Äôt have to do a thing, if the turrets hit the ghouls the player is guaranteed loot drops. It‚Äôs a scummy move because A, the turrets fuck with the frame rates and B, people won‚Äôt get loot because ghouls are already dead so people are well within their right to blow up these annoying camps. Have your camp down the stream, away from the golf course, it‚Äôs a nice area. Just don‚Äôt be a dick and turret spam the golf club.
---
You're right. Only think to fix is my pride as this dumb question is a bit of an embarrassment.
---
I've seen it on the map twice in one day, and the only other time I found it I had to walk into the prison.
---
I dont believe they do. The spotlights are in the turret section because that's all they are used for.
---
I always get a ton of crimson when there‚Äôs a nuke at that fissure prime site in the SW. 
---
Ah. Cool. Yeah, I'm just dumb. Thought shells loaded from the ejection hole.
---
I haven't even found one 
---
No problem! It‚Äôs still a great combo, as others here have already pointed out. I‚Äôm only disappointed because I found it on my level 30 character and likely won‚Äôt be able to reach the level 45 requirement before the patch drops. :(
---
You guys may be on different platforms?
---
Cool! I wish I saw this before posting.
---
Im trying to complete the challenge for taking all of them once. 
---
I dont know about the plan pool. Just commenting that ive taken the same workshop multiple times  and once its 4 waves of mongrels, another its one wave of mole rats, and then it was 3 scorchbeasts. Very unbalanced to jave them be part of a defend event. 
---
Sounds great but like all the other "news" be great with proof they were duper or offering money. This should help combat newsites picking this up and writing articles and blowing it out of proportion again when it doesn't actually happen. 
---
Yes and they're multiplicative, so the latter
---
Hmm. Don't know. I dropped them because the fight was happening for a good bit.
---
Worth some testing. If they persist, they certainly shouldn't off friendlies. Otherwise, you might accrue a bounty unintentionally.
---
It should that the only gear you can use for candidacy is the patched suit and a sign as a weapon. 
---
In a garage behind the antiques place that is NW of Watoga. 
---
If they'd just add a text chat, we wouldn't have a need for specific emote phrases.
---
They have made them rarer since the most recent patch
---
Wait really 
---
On both? I have the max on whichever pacifies. 
---
Yea im on Xbox, ill message you
---
I play a 30 percent or lower health/melee build.   You can solo a silo with a combat knife.. Dodgy and serendipity are amazing for any build.  I has to vendor and give away hundreds of stimpacks.  If use power armor I dont use a stim pack for hours.
---
Lol, I wonder if that happens a lot because I did that! I had finally found some players near New River Gorge Bridge West after accidentally picking the lock of someone's CAMP at an early level. I went so far as to unequip all my armor and tell them they can have my junk. Wasteland justice was served AND they let me keep my stuff. 
---
There actually are a LOT of good people out there in the wasteland, not just griefers and dupers (good riddance).
---
For ffs af
---
I came here to say the same thing! Whack em then spam grab 
---
Someone didnt read the whole thing. 
---
Why can't I download the patch iv done everything they ask I'm not use to playing shit online so I don't have a clue how much it costs to play and shit like that so I was just wondering why I can't get off the screen that says restart after patch finishes downloading 
---
‚ÄúFrig off Randy‚Äù
---
I got my first TSE (shotty) today. Was actually pretty surprised. I wasn't farming at all, it was just a random legendary me. Gutsy in surgar Grove when I went in for springs.
---
I'm looking forward to the patch though. I haven't used it cause I think it's too OP and would ruin a lot of the challenge.
---
Hmm..  so in the past i've noticed she has stayed on the ground longer than what would seem normal.  Is that perhaps what she was shot with?
---
"Might live near arseholes"... just like real life!
---
You clearly don't understand what "griefing" even means. Go read a book. 
---
Lvl 136 still in the forest I keep saying I‚Äôll move but I can get 3 bobble heads 4 fusion cores a couple magazines and a small stash of nuka cola where I am in maybe 10 minuets 
---
I get that all the time and I roleplay on my trading character. The radiation ate my throat.. ya know cause I drink swamp water.. I love swamp water.. plus I'm a scorched old lady.. taking baths daily
---
I sort by New. Every 3 weeks a gem like this pops up.
---
Thank You.
---
I'm not online but the lowest level one per wikia costs:
---
Adhesive (10)
---
Asbestos (14)
---
Copper (9)
---
Rubber (10)
---
Screw (10)
---
Spring (8)
---
Steel (31)
---
I had the exact same thing happen to me i cant continue the quest line
---
Tongs of that style irl weigh upwards of a few pounds. .75 is a bargain.
---
There is a scrap heap under the walkway as you enter the enclave bunker via the traditional vault entrance that has the assaultron head skillcheck, it seems to be broken though. 
---
3k
---
It looks like mine did after it got hit by a nuke
---
In the beta i found one in the insane asylum
---
Wonder if scrapper affects the fuel recovered
---
Robot waifu might get me to re-install the game.
---
My budget says it's at 34% I have a very modest Shack with a few turns on top a bed a weapons bench a stash box and a cook station. It says I can't build a single thing even though I deleted a ton of stuff. Can't even build a fence rail but I'm sitting at 34% of my budget. Something is definitely up.
---
I know it's an old post but I'm trying like heck to find the plans. If anyone on Xbox finds a set and wants to sell I'd be happy to fork out the caps it takes to make you happy. Hit me up, phat dastard is my xbl gt.
---
That's in a similar location to where mine is. Mine is right below Top of the World on the first ledge. It works well for my needs. 
---
What console mate?
---
I can craft them for a T-51 on xbox
---
You get it figured bud?
---
You are welcome my friend.
---
To hell it is! There's only one static spawn for Handmade rifles and they never spawn there anyway, handmade mods are definitely worth more than 700c
---
Would work well with my suicide missions build. Paired with Last Laugh, it could be a real gas 
---
Honestly, of all the other problems going on, I really did notice the absence of any meaningful holiday content. I'm not counting over-costed deceptively advertised DLC as holiday content.
---
Is that an alien with a fedora?
---
Enclave bunker. 
---
enclave med bay
---
Banned for duping?

If you have money you can go to Disneyland to have fun.

Lets hope they don't find Ebay.

Imagine the spamming, ‚ÄúFULL POWER ARMOUR SET 100% LEGIT T-60 FOR 750 CAPS!‚Äù
---
Have you tried to google it? Are all updates done, I normally get errors when I need to update!
---
Watoga (train station and BOS vendor) and Harpers Ferry and good for more unique plans and weapons. The Watoga station has the added benefit of being the train station where everyone goes after a SBQ fight and sell all their stuff so they may also have some good legendary gear in there too.
---
Grafton (both responder bots) are great for Combat Armor plans. 
---
Enclave base is good for X01 mods, scout armour and medicine recipes.
---
Grahm has the best unique plans and equipment but is also the hardest to find (he is a super mutant vendor that walks around the whole map with Charlie the Moo Moo).
---
There is also a rare vendor that's spawn near the Charleston station (not the vendor in Charleston starion) that sells unique plans and outfits.
---
Whitespring stock does change but not by much and is pretty predictable.
---
Everyone else stock is kind of random what you can find.
---
It's computer code for "It just works".
---
Yeah the lights and beats I can deal with.. It's the karaoke that kills me, or at least breaks my armor and limbs.
---
Well CoD has tighter shooting and movement anyway.
---
Baseball Bats are surprisingly effective and have a lot of good mods that only require a level 2 perk to craft. Scrap a few until you unlock 'Barbed' and 'All-Star'.
---
Man that's rough
---
What if the first of these was the rail lines? Clean up the rails so the trains can pass. Boot up the trains. Then they enable cheaper station to station fast travel. Maybe a fixed price of 5 caps from any station to any station
---
There are multiple events that give out plans and a vendor that sells it regularly. 
---
I mean if you want to pay 10x the average price on the trade subs go ahead Ill sell you some wood scrap for 20,000 each if you want too.
---
I want to say they said they were working on a way to do this in the last ‚Äúinside the vault‚Äù
---
How to catch a duper?
---
Check e-mail
---
They were all found. However the ones other than the "man" mask are all in the developer cell that people hacked into on pc. They are likely coming in the future at some point. On an interesting side note, there were the other two ritual masks present, as well as the marine helmet everyone wants but isn't obtainable yet. Alot of goodies indeed.
---
Probably his second character acting as a mule 
---
It's pretty much all about expectations. The historic expectations of long time fans, the quality expectations of a full priced game from a well known developer and the many/varied pre conceived gameplay/feature expectations. 
---
The plus of buying the game now like you and I did is we aren't expecting the world and are able to enjoy whats actually fun about the game :)
---
If you ever get down to like 1 or 2 caps available from a vendor and want to get them because... reasons... you can sell them a bobby pin for 1 cap.
---
She has high resistance to explosives too.
---
Anti-armor and prime mods work better at the Scorchbeast queen.
---
Its good once a day for plans + flux
---
Buy another ps4.
---
Get another account going.
---
Have both on the same server. 
---
Trade items.
---
All of your favourites should be legendary man....
---
How much would you sell your favorite weapon for?
---
They sell for 1000-2000 on the trade subs if you want it for thousands over average price go for it. 
---
I love the workshop defense missions.
---
Great way to level
---
Great way to get materials
---
Great way to get meds/chems
---
Great way to get Plans
---
Absolutely no reason to remove them.
---
If you don't like them, then don't participate
---
0.00080 ish. If you‚Äôre talking real $$$
---
The Uranium Fever event at Blackwater Mine, because all the glowy mole miners have a good chance of dropping nuclear waste.  Also the people who run the event are usually friendly and there's legendaries who need to drop their legendary wooden nipple armour!
---
You can get some through events, I learned the Psychobuff recipe from something in the Mire and Radaway from a power plant powering-up. Bunker is a more reliable location though.
---
Also can get chem plans from various event rewards.
---
A lot of it - nuked Whitesprings. Kill enemies and loot everything.
---
Some material - nuka-cola factory.
---
I‚Äôm afraid of weirdos trying to chat me up.   Look, I just need backup on missions and my camp was destroyed.  Guys wanna talk but I ain‚Äôt TED.  I‚Äôm ScoliOsys in game on Xbox. 
---
I wouldn't. I'm the kind of person who would just give something away to someone if they needed it, but not my favorites.
---
I am actually in the mire, but being on a cliff has immense advantages. Everyone talks about turrets and defenses, but really terrain is the best defense!
---
"What have I become?"
---
You sir, are a raider and a fiend. Looks like it's time to swap out that responder flaire for a raider one.
---
My guess is its the id/ address of the server. I got a similar message when the entire server crashed, I was with a team and everyone got disconnected, and I tried rejoining via social menu and clicking on one of my teammates, join game. That format of numbers popped up, maybe with some other text
---
Well, yeeeee haw!
---
Anyone?
---
I guess I'm way out of the loop, I remember the prices for these being around 7k. They've really gone down
---
I get that the high resistance would explain me not doing godly damage. That said though, there were a dozen other guys lighting her up too.
---
I can't imagine going through that once a day. I'm going to need a few days just to work back up the ammo I spent, much less if I want to use something like my two shot .50 cal.
---
ThisüëÜüèº
---
Hmm. I‚Äôve not tried using it w/o power armor - maybe I should. 
---
Given that power armor prevents against environmental, and if I‚Äôm not eating - the only thing should be from creatures. And either they spawn too many chances to overwhelm any reduction, or it‚Äôs not seeing a lot of value for me.
---
If you have committed, your future livelihood to a career as a gaming youtuber, unless you are streaming Fortnite daily to kids like Ali A, it is difficult to create daily gaming content on YouTube. 
---
Unlike investigate journalist in the BBC, CNN etc that research news, there only source of information are gaming forums.
---
Fallout 76 might have issues, but the bigger issue is Youtubers need to make a living and getting more clicks directly affects their paycheck at the end of the month. 
---
But did you have to pay a second time for BR mode? No you did not. Did you have to pay a second time for GTA Online? Again no. What you bought were Fortnite's Save the World mode and GTA5's single player game. Jesus.
---
I am using Nvidia, but unfortunately not. I can't get either Task manager through it's combo (enabled to be on top) or the user menu through ctrl alt del.. 
---
5k lowest I'd go. 700 is pretty much giving it away for free.
---
It really is. I mean I do have a few turrets but those are mostly for the super mutants that tend to spawn at Top of the World sometimes. My only real complaint about my little cliff is I don't have much dirt for produce. 
---
"Hello my baby, hello my honey, hello my ragtime gal..."

HM Rifle plans worth 2k max lol.

Who's crying? You can point to dumb shit by raising your finger, not your voice.
---
I agree, that's exactly how it should be
---
They generally sell for about 1500 caps
---
Fire Engine Red.
---
I'm sure that's what the winterized paint job from the dev room would have been for, too bad the scammers had to go and ruin it.
---
I've seen bluderbuss ONCE. Im about level 140.
---
You can also cry without making a sound...
---
It does sound like an inventory synchronization issue.  I wonder if you retained the scrap from the gas mask or if it went away?
---
Yup, it's built on a parking lot
---
You either die a responder or live long enough to see yourself become a raider...
---
Powerplants the contro lroo mwhere you complete the "power up ......." quest will have these maps too. They indicate all stations that get powered boxes after completing. The boxes provide 10 power when the plants are off 100 when on. plan shops have 400 iirc.
---
Gotcha. 
---
Yeah and toasters are plastic and lightweight too :D
---
Thats weird cause ive never seen anyone sell them for that price ever.

Gotcha

I'd hold my breath since as far as we know they only patched out the most well known duping method and I've heard through the grapevine (yes, I know but it's hardly unbelievable) that some people still have confirmed working methods as of the latest patch of duping that they purposely kept secret for when they removed the popular method everyone already knows about. Just so they can probably profit off it until they get bored and then try to sell it (for actual money) to as many former dupers out of the loop as possible before it too blows up and gets patched out.
---
Dupers were getting $5 per 25,000 at the time.  
---
This exactly! 
---
I dunno but you need to keep doing that to get the Platinum Trophy!! (PS4)
---
Ammo\Med dispensers around the map need to accept pre-war currency. Makes no sense for them to run on caps.
---
Its like normal scorchbeasts, they get easier in time.
---
I use a shotgun while she is in the air and my black diamond when she is on the ground, saves some ammo.
---
No, but there is a syringer that can add broken limb to her as an effect. Different mods though
---
Yes? Your question is phrased oddly.
---
But yeah I've one shotted players plenty l.
---
lol alcoholism amirite?
---
You can also be exposed to criticism you don't agree with without trying to belittle the person raising it. 
---
I wonder if the reverse ever happens. An ill meaning raider who can't help but do the right thing. Always by accident too. 
---
One day he tries raiding a homestead, only to find it overrun with mirelurks. Naturally he kills the krass crustaceans in self defense. The unwitting homesteaders take him for a kindhearted savior and shower him with thanks and canned dog food, much to his confusion of course.
---
Too easy to acquire in large quantities. It‚Äôs worthless for a reason. 
---
Check your email, this what people that got banned received as messages when logging in.
---
You mean 3% drop. 0.03 is the decimal equivalent of 3%. *It's not quite that bad.*
---
Cut the cord! Or dont haha.  You do you :)
---
there no way they can go from full price game to free 2 play.
---
they will lose too many of the player base as the atom shop is a rip off atm imagine a free2  play/ FREEMIUM game well the shit would hit the fan and prices for the most basic of shit would be exponential. :) 
---
I like that. I will trade you for that "dark meat of wrong" metaphor: "[person] is a compass that always points at magnetic wrong." 
---
 That sounds fairly worthless.
---
If you don't mind me asking, what part of the map is it on?
---
lol it does
---
Is that possible? I haven't found a paddle ball at all
---
I've used it as a CAMP before. Theres a junk node there. 
---
No they do get ballistic damage, it‚Äôs just not listed because energy weapons don‚Äôt display ballistic damage besides the plasma gun. My exploding Tesla shotgun does more dmg than my exploding double barrel.
---
I'd suggest just implementing text chat, sort of making a "no mic" emote unnecessary.
---
There's a workshop in the southern part of the savage divide that churns out a lot of nuclear material. 
---
On the map it's the place with all of the concrete spikes sticking out of the ground. Don't remember the name though.
---
I have had friends get banned for rapid cooking/crafting. This has to be more selective. 
---
Does the projectile or the method of acceleration cause the damage? I say the former, in which case, I agree it should be ballistic damage. Should take the Science perk to craft and repair though. 
---
Players must have taken them already
---
I'm on Xb1 and no.
---
Yeah, probably would work.
---
Pay to play baby &lt;3 
---
It was the 20th PVP kill for my good griefer trophy. No idea how/why i killed all those other players...
---
If you reference the spreadsheet in the post then it comes out to 0.6% because there are only 5 drops in the Mire.
---
Yes, you must have terrible luck or something.
---
It kinda does remind me of bumblebee from transformers one of the most badass autobots on a list of badasses.
---
Still at the kids table with those generators üòπ
---
That godawful prize bot periodically walks up and gives me 20 pounds of pre war money mid fight.
---
We need more storage space for helmets and masks
---
Yep, normal

Credit to whomever built it, no idea whom sorry
---
There‚Äôs already Dog Helmets in game so I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs SoonTM and will be like 20$.. Which I‚Äôm not looking forward to.
---
And you can give criticism without belittling people too, you know?
---
A plague of radtoads in a specific place, like a nuke.
---
Yeah and save the world mode had guess what microtransactions. And Legendary characters and weapons for Founders. And free Llamas and other stuff every day etc. I didn't play for a while and I log in and get like 100 Llamas with Mythic Grenadier Ramerez and Legendary Machinist Harper. Etc. Is that pay to win? Well it's a co-op game for a start. And I don't even play Fortnight Battle Royale and it is just cosmetics also. GTA V I only bought it for Online mode. And I never spent a penny on Shark Cards. I grind out missions in the game. Headhunter and Sightseer to make money. Some games I will spend money on and some I won't depending on how I feel about the game and developers and publishers, and what it is I am actually paying for. 
---
Like I said before. There are a lot of people willing to spend money on games. And GTA Online and Fortnight prove it. If Bethesda isn't getting that money somebody else is. You can make atoms in game and buy whatever you want. I can buy atoms for real money and buy whatever I want. I choose not to at the moment. You problem is with how I or others spend their money, just because you're not willing to. There is no pay t o win with st ash size. There is no pay wall. You are full of crap. And if you ever played a Korean MMO you would quickly learn what it really means.
---
Running this character with pistols so definitely happy to see it.
---
 I agree.  There should be a tag to make things unscrapable.  Also if they are going to have events like the rad reduction for every toy carried then make it so they can be locked to inventory as well.
---
no, that's not the way it is, if enough people complain to bethesda, i'm sure that they'll figure out a mechanic for expanding the stash because I (and i'm sure others) are tired of being 2500/350 weight capacity. with a full stash.
---
Train station and all the other whitesprings vendors in the lower level. 
---
Yep. I think it gives out a stack of 100 sometimes. They‚Äôre in cargobot drops (at least the nuke ones, but I think regular ones too) and the enclave resource drops. It‚Äôs also laying all over the place. 
---
Thought:  how about a money suit in the Atom shop made from pre-war money?  
---
I enjoy playing it, but the game is simply not that good.
---
It‚Äôs stupid m. Do you have 2 drives?
---
Dang it. Didn't think of that. I already stashed all scrap.
---
My bad - didn't look close enough.  I only get BA pipes :(. At least I know now.
---
I don't use a mic and had some guy the other night following me around, going "BRO. BRO. YOU GOT A MIC? BRO. YOU GOT A MIC? YOU GOT A MIC BRO? BRO. HEY BRO. HEY. YOU GOT A MIC BRO?" I obviously don't, mate.
---
Please Bethesda don‚Äôt change the TS effect of the weapons. If you do then u must also increase their base dmg and their durability. Don‚Äôt reduce this effect and leave us to farm bullets and repair resources 2x.  
---
Do you remember if it's 1 tall thing or several huts in trees?
---
Are you suggesting that I have insulted you?
---
Oh so I bought that plan for nothing. Great.
---
what's the point of constantly building and crafting if you have nowhere to put the things you've crafted!?
---
You can also climb the relay towers and click "survey" on the top railing and it will put markers on your map for the surrounding area
---
Yeah. If you get the plans you should be able to craft a level 45 or 50.
---
Yeah it sucks that i can just plow through things with a reg power fist no prob and not be in danger.
---
No unfortunately I gave up but I still have 2 keycards
---
How telling, right? They let you know early what to expect.
---
Let the human psyche figure out that time is a flat circle.
---
üòâ
---
Maybe wearing a different headgear would also improve your rate? You know, so you don't look like you're trying to "Purge" them.
---
In the patch notes it said reduced rate to find them in generators. 
---
Channel your inner Eugene Krabs with the MONEY SUIT
---
We need paint for everything honestly. 
---
What did Feed the People used to do?
---
Did you kill her ?
---
Directional charges are desired
---
No the only plans Bethesda has Rn is to reduce the TS (and the E) effect of the weapons. Therefore we will spend more bullets and more durability at the expense of slowly kill mobs. 
---
Did you eat a Berry Mentat?
---
It gives that effect. 
---
I totally missed the part about cranberry bog sorry. Lol
---
I'm rather attached to my furious CR so I'm not too bothered by a lack of PR legends.  Really I'm needing a .38 PR to replace my homemade.
---
Deleted my beta character and have two characters lvl 77 and 80, with only 5 achievements left the 2 I already mentioned are bugged now I‚Äôm scared to even try and push to 100
---
Please explain what griefing means to you. 
---
Just a guess, but were you marked by an orbital scan beacon? That's the only thing I can come up with.
---
Hey now... moving is expensive and I didnt have the means to make the big ones!
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
I didn‚Äôt even have one on me, which is why I was so suddenly confused. I was just collecting duct tape. 
---
We did, we failed the event but she never left the event so we ended up being able to kill her.
---
Praise be to Atom!
---
I think that's the metal under the yellow paint
---
I think you meant git gud.
---
üòò
---
There‚Äôs a thousand should-be-simple fixes they haven‚Äôt fixed yet. Probably hundreds in weapon/armor mods alone. 
---
I guess we have different experiences then. When I play, I see an overwhelming majority of Excavator power armor, with a handful of Ultracite, and then an even smaller number of X-01. Ive never seen a T-60 or T-45 when fighting a scorchbeast queen, I have seen 1 or 2 T-51, and, from what ive seen, im one of the only one who uses Raider power armor.
---
My roleplay group wants it too. 
---
True. At least my disconnects have dropped from roughly 1-2 an hour to 1 ever 4-6 hours, if at all. I assume it will always be an ongoing struggle until Bethesda just implements a different method of control, ie autobanning if items get above certain amounts with increased severity the more it happens until permaban.
---
I understand that won't likely stop dupers, but at least it wouldn't be in the quantities that disconnect the servers.
---
thanks! yes, my in game name is the same as in here
---
That‚Äôs..... actually a really good point. Similar to how the pre-war programming of the vendors in the Sierra Madre used it for currency (though in an aggravatingly clunky fashion). 
---
It‚Äôs going to get worst once the TS gets nerfed = less dmg = more bullets = less durability. 
---
It's blue and red. You can clearly see the logo on the knee in white letters its a G and i think an mco?
---
Okay cool now I just gotta save up lol. 
---
Please add text chat for PC!  You have a game that will last years and years, but some of the most basic options are still missing:  text chat, showing which plans I already own, inventory sort-by-weight doesn't take into account quantity owned, confusing trade interface.  The game is solid, but UI still needs some refining.
---
Yay for the patch, now i freeze and crash 5 times more than before , and that was bad then.   You broke it , please send  mr handy to fix it.     Xbox one
---
Did the same thing. Launched a nuke solo, but realized when i tried to take on the queen i had 0 stimpaks... Doh.
---
Gareth Bobby Ferguson Jr. Is that you?
---
On both, then you have to go to one of the random event spawn locations and hope you get an animal. If the animal is at most half your level and you have level three of both perks you will have a new "tame" option. 
---
Hmmm. No. 
---
At least not the onei have, and it's set for max range. 
---
For the most part the community is unbelievably helpful. I found alot of them here as well https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
Unless it‚Äôs been fixed, shotguns with two-shot alone are pretty bad. It just adds one more pellet; since they shoot about 8, with 9 pellets you get like 12% more damage *if* all the pellets connect. 
---
It's right next to the Miner's Monument, south from Whitesprings
---
I played Blade and Soul up till they started added p2w... and yes, being able to buy a game changing mtx in a full priced game is stupid, hence why they were REMOVED from BF2. It gives you an advantage over people that can't afford to spend money on them. You keep saying that I can spend my earned Atoms, but you can buy them mutlitudes of times faster than earning them. There's this thing called balance and in multiplayer games, ESPECIALLY multiplayer games, it is necessary that all players have access to the EXACT same things foer the price they paid. You having the money to spend on MTXs in games shouldn't have any effect on how the game is played. If you want that shit go play all those Korean games you love so fucking much.
---
Awesome ‚Äúglitch‚Äù would award every player on the server canned dog food 
---
With the heavy rocket mod it does 21 more damage for me.
---
My goal in life is to leave the world a weirder place than I found it. 
---
I don‚Äôt know what that is, but my buddy, who was right next to me, didn‚Äôt get the effect. 
---
Gave everyone on the server food that increased exp when eaten.  Now it just gives the people in the event the food.
---
I'm not sure if follow. The paper thing ghouls drop can summon supply boxes?
---
Ah.  I actually like the stuff.  I use Canned Dog Food and Purified Water for my supplies.  I got a perk card that makes Dog Food give 75 HP and 37% hunger.
---
This is probably the best bet since they mostly fixed server hoping for static world spawn items. Monsters are the most reliable source when server hopping, so snallygaster spawns  are win.
---
Just out of curiosity....were you essentially at the center of the blast zone right before the nuke hit?  That was the only way that trophy popped for me.  
---
No email
---
Thank You! I love messing around with the C.A.M.P just to see what I can build for the fun of it!
---
I don't know. At least in the case of the enclave, the robots seem to just be there, walking around, then they die as I approach. 
---
With the scorchbeast, I had been in that location quite a while, killing stuff, and had begun scavenging. 
---
Not at all, but you did insult BGS Devs and you could've come up with better criticism than "They've got no IQ."
---
&gt; [I genuinely have no idea what this is. What grill is it even talking about? When will it be ready?]
---
You can craft a grill as part of your base. Potentially it‚Äôs a cooking station that requires prep, maybe certain recipes can only be crafted on it?
---
There is a mod for this in the meantime. 
---
You can have sound play from your speakers, but still use the mic on your headset. Just leave the headset on your desk in front of you or something.
---
If you go to one of of the various antennas in the map you can load a holotape into the compute and Uncle Sam will drop you a Shiskabob. 
---
How would they not have an emote for such a commonly expressed feeling
---
I realize that you're trying to lighten this up, so thank you for that. But I had to bury my son, so seeing this whole thing tore me apart.
---
Yup starts a side quest
---
If you were constantly shooting it for the full 3 minutes that condition is probably really good.
---
I mean seriously, a $10 headset with a Mic will work.
---
When I played yeah
---
Let us use Pip-Boys while moving. I dont know about you all, but i can definitely walk while looking at my watch
---
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one where you are!! My base is huddled there as well!
---
Still a nuisance.  Had a buddy make up a nice Recon Rifle to burn off .308 while I rebuilt my primary ammo supplies.  Felt a little sheepish when I had to ask him to make me another cause I scrapped the first.
---
Found a bone hammer a friend indicated they wanted.  Hadn't seen one before.  Yeah, scrapped that too.
---
Lucky!  
---
A lot of people haven‚Äôt realized this, but in one of the early patches, they ‚Äúfixed‚Äù world loot spawns to try to prevent server Hopping. There‚Äôs some exceptions that make people think it‚Äôs just RNG, but it‚Äôs really not. If you loot something from the world (and this includes looting containers), that loot location won‚Äôt reset *for you* until about 20 hours have passed (basically same as vendor caps). 
---
The weird part comes in with areas that get ‚Äúrespawned‚Äù by another player- you can go through and ‚Äústeal‚Äù their loot, so to speak. 
---
That is no one's problem but you're own though. You choose to keep items instead of deciding what is needed, wanted and useless. Yes complaining may result in change but it is also you're job as a player, to manage you're stash till a bigger stash limit is implemented 
---
Just go back to playing your mobile games so you can buy your way through them.
---
We wanted the new Fallout... not a multiplayer. A lot of us HATE multiplayer but wanted fresh console content. I‚Äôm not using my mic because I don‚Äôt want to talk to your dumb ass.
---
You‚Äôre absolutely welcome. I truly hope it helps. 
---
You think having 100 or 200 or 400 more stash alters how the game is played. Nah I could just dump all of these weapons in a container and log in another character. Or if I had a friend I could trust in the game I would give them and log in another character and pick them all up and then I am unburdened and I didn't have to pay a penny or spend any atoms. You are just a whiner who thinks everything is pay to win and pay walls because you're not willing to spend anything more to support the game. I would pend more to support the game if they offer me things I want. P.S beehive hairstyle, crow face paint, 50 summer clothes, 5 pip boy skins, not something I would even spend free atoms on.
---
Super duper and chemist are both essential perks for me too. They're too good to pass up.
---
I don't understand why this is a problem.  You have to craft the stash to begin with so why not make it so you can craft multiples?  just make them really expensive and let me store like 600 weight in each.  Then I can CHOOSE if i want to dedicate those resources to storing more things, or crafting other things...  it should be a build choice.  it's already a disadvantage that you have to store these things away from your adventuring (at your camp instead of on your person), and I think that's totally reasonable (one can only have so much pocket/backpack space and carry so much, i get that), and I also get that you should only be able to store so much in a single container... ok...  but let us craft more storage containers (for a hefty fee) so that we can store legendaries that we can then sell/trade and make collections of the things that we like (like various suits of power armor for example)
---
If it says "Appalachia" don't open it..?
---
My personal best is 1573 with full adrenaline 
---
Spam?
---
As some others have said this is more pvp than griefing. I think griefing would be more like they wait for you to leave your base than destroy it while you are gone.
---
Where do you change the language? The launcher?

This cannot be upvoted enough

You‚Äôre amazing 
---
Reread what I wrote. I specifically indicated the idea, not the devs. 
---
I've found that bases near the overseers camp tend to get ignored on the PS4 at least. 
---
I've never had mine raided once by people.
---
I believe most dailies only trigger when you get somewhat close to them.
---
I noticed it. Ive been going to power armor spawn locations and taking them from the armor.
---
Bethesda please
---
You can find some that are pre-assembled in lots of mid-level areas, especially Raider camps on the cliffsides. Sneak around and see what you find.
---
It's fine to ask for help here, btw, someone will be happy to mod your rifle if you provide the materials.
---
I doubt there is a prime receiver, I haven‚Äôt seen Prime for any explosive based weapon
---
Not me
---
Nice. I still have my sleeping bag and benches beneath the stars. Maybe I‚Äôll finally build. 
---
Raider camp, gotcha! And thanks for the advice :)
---
Buy them from players.  They are an SOB to get the recipe for but they are thankfully quite reasonable to craft (just takes a flux).   I imagine a lot of 150+ characters probably have found at least one serum recipe by now.
---
I find myself getting the 2-3 I think of as necessary, then I just let them accrue naturally.  With Class Freak even the sketchy ones aren't too bad.  Only ones I really dislike are Herbivore, Empath, Talons, Twisted Muscles, and Egg Head.   If I get one of those I start popping radaway until they are gone.  Then I re-serum the couple of ones I have constant access to and just let the others accumulate on their own.
---
t-51b at 200% repair + grounded+ blocker+ emergency protocols+ nerd rage means you have more than enough time to pop a stimpak to get your health back up

i play a glass cannon  build and its really not that bad,90% of my deaths are still from blowing myself up
---
u/dorklogic I was only asking because in my own research I hadn't found anything. I'm a huge fan if this game even if I'm now waiting on new content to play 
---
This happened again to me, 2nd day in a row...
---
Wow I thought there was for all weapons even the crossbow 
---
Go away
---
Tis no biggie and maybe someday you'll get a regular rifle. 
---
Jesus Christ with the "proof of a rushed release" bullshit. People had a ideas for side quests that didn't make it into the initial release, welcome to the fucking world of video game design. 
---
I hate to agree bc I love dominating the wasteland with no regard to life around me but one time I got a 10 cap bounty and because of my tse I made almost 1000 off of hunters. I was killing xo1 armored hunters through their stimpaks with three or four shots
---
I just want to build my base of a couple hundred cats &amp; cat paintings 
---
Something like this! And if they aren't dealt with/killed in a certain timeframe they spread to more places on server
---
I would buy "Junk Packs" annd "Decor Packs" from the atom shop in a second.
---
It's not a grind if you're having fun doing it. Every monster hunt is a different experience. 
---
Yeah him and a few other videos that popped up as related but couldn't find more information other than what they cited with "someone messaged me but I have no confirmation but it's totally the thing that is happening"

I don‚Äôt remember it
---
That's because it DOES effect the way the fagame is played. Why should the majority of players have to struggle with weight managment when you get a pass on it because you can afford to spend more money? If they didn't want you to have to decide what you want to keep amd what you have to throw out then they would've made the stash unlimited. And don't even start with the server stability crap, that's not true because if it were then the infinite carry weight glitch would've crashed the servers. I've been avoiding insulting you, but I seriously think you're a dumbass if you think this is a good idea. That's all it is. You're just too fucking stupid to see how terrible of an idea this is.
---
I can make you one 4 free.. ps4 'tigertemper'

Well I was just going off what the other guy said but still a lot less than 3%
---
Love it!  Can you tell me where or how you got colored lights? Those are so awesome
---
I Dont know if TSEs were too powerful, but there was far too much of a spread between them and the base model gun. They're like 3 times better. Thats crazy. Its crazy that they wanted guns out there that were objectively the best, and faaaaar superior to other guns. You would think they would want a few guns to be situationally the best. But really, there's only TSEs. No matter what your play style, you should be using a TSE. It makes me think that they never wanted balance in the weapons. Maybe lunchboxes were supposed to help you land these god weapons? Maube they planed 
---
Can you throw in their weights of individual tabs? I‚Äôd how much of my total weight is aid etc. 
---
Mixed bag.  Lately I've been finding I need to hustle my butt down because the Queen gets dropped so quickly.  Going to be damn interesting once the next patch adjusts things.
---
Honestly I hate how much ammo I dump into her so I do sometimes question whether or not to head down.  Been grabbing an off-ammo gun to "help" lately.  Doesn't seem to make much of a difference with some of the guys doing crazy damage through one thing or another.
---
Lets get rid of TSE weapons and buff melee.

Two shot and anti armor on the same weapon?

Dailies are bugged, sometimes they trigger and some other times they don't. As for rewards I don't really know.

---
The camps with an icon that looks like binoculars are a good spot to check, they tend to be scenic viewpoints or sniper nests. You'll also unlock mods for weapons as you scrap them, so keep breaking down extra rifles at workbenches to collect better stocks and scopes.
---
Are the legs on it broken?

You should join the Reddit fallout discord channel. I think it's in the sidebar 
---
fireproof perk with Dense torso eliminates explosive damage. Sentinels plus Assassins armor reduces damage by 75% when not moving and another 40% (multiplicative) from players. That‚Äôs ignoring any other perks he may be running for damage reduction. So your two-shot Gatling probably does, what, 200 a shot (the explosive part is ignored). Knock off the Sentinel, you‚Äôre down to 50 damage. Knock off the Assassins, you‚Äôre now at 30 damage. Then there‚Äôs the perks. He could easily be down at like 10 damage per bullet. 
---
Wheres ur argument to why they should? besides "I dont wanna shell out caps". I mean they want to encourgage exploration which ur more likely to do if u have to pay more to travel further distances, then if u could just travel anywhere for the same cost.
---
Probobly that also considering how fast it was rushed
---
Work around is to utilize CAMP and Vault 76 to reduce the cost. Fast travel to those for free, which ever one shortens distance to destination, then fast travel again from there. Can also swap in the Travel Agent perk card for some reduction.
---
I don't personally mind it so much, encourages me to explore versus fast travel as I'm cheap. 
---
You were still being belittling, and that's actually not criticism at all if you're just talking shit without any idea on how to improve it.
---
There needs to be a set time the vendors reset. Unless Bethesda is up to making a holotape like the silo one that tells you the cooldown. That seems like a lot of work though. 
---
:) has done me well for years
---
I've found that Endurance is the least useful SPECIAL stat for the most part. A lot of the Perks simply aren't worth it when compared to other Perks in other trees. It isn't even a good "Dump Stat" for SPECIAL points, as any extra SPECIAL points you don't need for your core build should be dropped into LUCK so your looted items (Legendaries) have better initial durability.
---
It hadn‚Äôt occurred to me before, but you are right. A flat rate would discourage all those tiny 5 cap jumps and increase exploration. People are still going to pay for far away travel regardless 
---

Tip, put your camp on the right side of the map, because fast travel to vault 76 is free. 
---
The first time I tried to run it, I probably used 40+ stimpaks and still failed.  Put it off for a couple of levels, built up my meds.  I did a little reading about the run which helped.  I went in with excavator armor, converted all of my weapons to armor piercing, and carried some pulse grenades and mines.  It was simple after that.
---
Sounds familiar. Two assholes came into my friends camp and just stood there while their lvl200+ buddy stood on the outside blasting the walls with a TSE. They were waiting for me to attack him so that they could drop me.

Its pretty good, 98 percent of the people are normal players.   Add me if want to do a few missions together or you want some ammo, legendaries, etc., my teammate and I have plenty.   Im level 77, but just started the main quests.

Head, and just under the wings seem to be critical spots. My Lv250 is a VATS crit build so when she‚Äôs in the air I use my lever action to crit charge on her head, when she‚Äôs on the ground I switch to the handmade and hit her head or underwings. My Lv150 is a heavy gunner so unless she‚Äôs hovering in the air I usually wait for her to hit the ground then use my .50Cal on her underwings or my quad harpoon. 
---
Use adrenaline on ads for the five stack, count to twenty to twenty-five and kill another ad, then switch back to the Queen. Psychobuff on the favorite wheel and occasionally a Big Guns or Small Guns bobble. Heavy guns have a perk to stagger which when hitting her wings seem to keep her on the ground longer. When she procs health regeneration she will almost always go back in to the air, and in my experience anytime AoE (grenades, missiles, nukes) are used she will go back up as well.
---
From what I was told, each player who enters the event increases her health pool by X% (I was told 10% but that‚Äôs unverified.) I‚Äôve had the whole server show up before and it‚Äôs definitely a resource sink if you‚Äôre the only one outputting damage. 
---
Usually my team *tries* to be nice and let lower levels know in proxy chat that this is end game content and they shouldn‚Äôt go in, some actually listen but most don‚Äôt. I used to get quite a few ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been in a nuke zone before‚Äù from Lv5-30s so I would ask them what they want to see nuked, run another silo afterwards and nuke it for them if they‚Äôre patient enough.
---
I don't think this would b fun for anyone but people in deep end game, since nuked areas are the place to get actual gear/stuff, it leaves a gaping hole of a mid game. The diseases would be harsh but at least plague walker value would shoot up lol.   
---
I like difficulty but this feels more like an April fool's joke than legit difficulty
---
Sooo... how does this work exactly? You camp the supply drop for unknown reasons and somehow people get wanted? What am I missing here?
---
No. TSE is a balance issue regardless of duper‚Äôs. When one specific legendary combo supersedes every perk card build choice (you specc‚Äôd heavy into rifles. You find a TSE shotgun. Completely unperked it outclasses your rifle), you have a problem
---
They don't have to struggle. They can choose to spend atoms on it. Idiot.
---
What would be best, level 50 instigating grognaks axe, or the all rise or another super sledge/sledgehammer variation?
---
Dailies are bugged unfortunately so often they won't trigger for a while

There is a Whole thread on the Animal Taming Perk. Only need animal friend maxed and supposedly lvl 3 charisma (I'd prefer level 6 to be safe).

So if supply drop is locked leave it alone

TL;DR .

Im sitting around 3500. Have yet to see anything worth buying.

Can I get in on this? Need marsupial and speed demon
---
You just pissed them off bro.... It's a you problem lol
---
I have both. Join me at gt MadDogMolina 
---
No, it‚Äôs not the whitesprings resort robots. It‚Äôs regular old robots. 
---
Oh hell yeah. 
---
Been happening about a month for me.
---
You wait for someone who hasn't gotten the memo that supply drops are bound to the person to unlock it then you open fire on them. 
---
Eh, not the worst odds in the world.  The spreadsheet running around indicates it's simply a regional reward for any event.  Do 4-5 events a day and you'll get it soon enough I think.  Good to have something to work towards.
---
One round of spawns turned into 30+ eye robots. It was so weird 
---
Sounds like you done fucked up. 
---
More simply, you hit a bot and now they‚Äôre all hostile to you. Log out then back in, problem fixed. 
---
Rare spawn for the golf club. Bet they're all diseased too, right? They have a virus
---
Upvote. Great point.
---
Let's define what griefing is.
---
I'd argue your scenario isn't griefing. It's a poor choice of location in your base (basically, where I built mine, derpty derp). As stated in the post, you can ghost out of most of this. Isn't this part of the strategy of the game? It's a big map, but sometimes shit goes down.
---
i don't know if it's just an extremely rare spawn or server weirdness or a bug or what, but sometimes the club will spawn shit that isn't ghouls. in all my hours of server hopping, i've seen liberators spawning instead of ghouls exactly once.
---
There are a lot of ballot machines and ballot printers for voting all around the landscape so it is certain the developers wanted to do something with elections and voting mayhem.  Maybe they stepped back from politicizing the content because of the current state of partisanship.

Follow the brotherhood quest line. Once you get a military I‚Äôd, you can unlock the brotherhood recon rifle. It‚Äôs a fully modded hunting rifle that costs the same mats to make as the hunting rifle.
---
Can't pull the fish in if they don't bite. 
---
Correct! All diseased 
---
I just logged off. Send me a message and I‚Äôll let you know when I‚Äôm back. Should be on tomorrow if that works. Sorry. 
---
So how are you using the junk pile?
---
A while back I had my camp there, steps on the inside going up over the fence, then a door out the back of the house and if I crouched I could access my junk collector there.
---
They aren‚Äôt the whitesprings bots. They are all diseased robots 
---
It was in the Automatron DLC
---
There was a great mod for it in fallout 4, same with the bozar. I hope bethesda will be adding more weapons, or at least reskins, in the future.
---
Ah, they updated the supply drops then? I had no idea.
---
I had hat I just don‚Äôt remember ever encountering the bug. I remember the salvaged assaultron head working fine.
---
Oh. I had an odd glitch like that once. About 30 eyebots followed me out of the golf club once. I guess they spawned instead of ghouls. 
---
TSE weapons will be capped at 45% power increase, right? They'll be less than two fold stronger. Take a look at an 1800 attack bloodied build and tell me what you think ha
---
So you‚Äôre telling me you want to get destroyed by TSE weapons?
---
Yeah last time I used it that‚Äôs what happened

I do as well, even on hot mic, it never picks game audio up
---
I noticed my mutation effectiveness is all over the map.  Not sure what's causing it.  I'm aware of the Rad-X and Strange in Numbers factors but there seems to be something else.
---
Why not just increase their armour penetration. 
---
Fair enough. it's just not **as** bad lol.
---
May have found a temporary fix; collect your power armor and redeploy it every time you wish to enter it.
---
In other words, never enter power armor that you've previously exited and hasn't been returned to your inventory.
---
Are TSEs too powerful?  Yes. 
---
Do they deserve a nerf?  Yes
---
But eliminating them from the game would not only be a bad idea (certainly scorched earth would much much more difficult) but would also piss off a lot of players who either farmed caps to buy one or farmed legendaries to get one from a drop. There‚Äôs already a lot of us aggravated about the nerf anyway (some TS guns won‚Äôt be usable afterwards, and it doesn‚Äôt even touch on the root of the problem, bobble stackers). 
---
They probably messed up the perk card. They said they did something with it in the last patch
---
It‚Äôs ok but thank you for the offer 
---
In fallout 4 the flamer couldn't spawn with the explosive effect. If you cheated it in it would do what you described.
---
I mean like one run of whitesprings golf club (no nuke)
---
You can also take workshops for additional fast travel spots.

Need to rename them yearly's - you might get one at some point in a year.

I think TSE guns are at least 10-fold more powerful than normal guns right now...
---
Check please!
---
Oh did you not hear about the nerf?
---
I've opened several cargo drops, never been flagged for it 
---
I have 3 for myself and can wear all 3
---
finished
---
I do how to improve it: remove the legendary system. There is no good reason for it to be in the game. I assumed that would have been obvious from what I wrote. I will re-iterate: The legendary system is a bad idea and an example of lazy game design.
---
OP mentioned you in an edit

Only in tales of myth and fantasy

Am I the only one who thinks that's a bullshit "opt out"? Forcing me to log out and log back in and try and continue doing whatever I was doing because some asshole thought it would be funny to attack is stupid.

Are you using the explosives perk? Explosive weapons are very good.
---
Did you request them? 
---
That black and gold respirator would go perfect with my civil war suit and bowler hat.
---
Yeah for the arms or legs.
---
Maybe a noise canceling desk mic could do it for you? I know some are really good at ignoring keystrokes and outside sound. If you don't have a desk, look at reviews for noise canceling clip on mics that you could put on your shirt or something. 
---
Why not just a server chat window? 
---
Again you'll be buying them at a rate much faster than I'd be earning them fuckwad.

You can buy them from the Harper's Ferry vendor iirc. It's the cycling light bulb, part of the "Assorted Lights" plan

Just like "Techncial Data".. bothers me to no end.

I tried the immersion method but finally just gave up and bought the serums.  Hurts the wallet, but a lot less of a waste of time.

Dont forget the maze out back of the torrance house!

Yeah I am and I have a good m79 but with nerf they definitely wont come close to explosive guns and are kind of underwhelming anyway for ammo cost and weight vs damageü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Hmm that shouldn't be damaged, but he was talking about another one.
---
Should be all damage.
---
Use the looking for group section on Xbox can build a team fast that way we got 12 players join for queen other day

Probably the bug with materials where if they are split between your stash and what‚Äôs on your person, it won‚Äôt combine them. Try sticking it all in your stash or vice-versa.

I'm still waiting for cage armour.

Yeah! Hell yeah! I love this idea.  Some of the best content is made this way in other games.  Turn the Atom store into a market place.  My first thought was 'It would have to be moderated' but you even thought of that.

So, I'm noticing an issue with the quest [**Tentative Plans**](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Tentative_Plans) where, you go near the radio to pick up the holotape but for some reason, it wasn't there after I picked it up, which I thought "okay maybe it's because I already have it" and I'm playing with a friend who hadn't done the quest (at the time) and when we went over it wasn't there either. We decide to leave it up to "server bug", so we go back the next time we play and low and behold - not there. 
---
I was eventually, able to drop the holotape (when before I couldn't???) and they were able to listen to it and complete the quest, but it was weird that she couldn't find it, the only other idea I have is that we were in a team, but I had already started the quest without her, so it was bugged. Not too sure what it is and I worry for other people who might be doing this quest, okay thanks!
---
I suppose that's true. I don't think the explosives perk should benefit legendary weapons with the explosive effect.
---
It's pretty easy to figure out when people can't hear you, if it keeps saying they're talking it's probably just background noise being picked up by the microphone, or they're just talking to themselves (which I do sometimes even though I know my teammates can't hear me). 
---
There is the halloween mask its pretty good
---
Ran into this tonight.   Odd thing is lvl 1 eyebots still dropped legendary loot.
---
When I say damaged, I mean it has been dumped into the laundry bin. I can't recall if it had a full healthbar or not.
---
I have a t51 nuka cola and an ultracite but i still use a level 35 excavator just for the +100 carry weight. Carry weight is more precious in this game then any legendary weapon imo
---
They sound like adults, but for some reason don't always ask if I have a mic. 
---
How do you know your exact damage number?
---
Grammar isn't your best it seems. 
---
I can easily take multiple shots from TSE 1k+ damage without dying. The reason people are complaining about them is because either:
---
1. They don't understand all the mechanics of the game, know the counters or willing to put the work in to counter them.
---
2. The TSE weapons were duped to were is way more weapons on the market than there would be, if there was no duping people would not be complaining as much because less people would be running around one shotting everything.
---
3. Not only that but TSE will be nerfed by the time the pvp mode comes out.
---
What about ultracite users
---
I have found 3 or 4 initiate paint plans for t-60. As for combat armor paint plams just server hop at graftons train station.
---
I already missed out on the level 50 one. I guess I will have to make a new character. I didn‚Äôt use my beta one either. 
---
Oh boohoo. Poor you.
---
The emote can be the "Speak no evil" monkey, or a mime in a box

I'm very much down on that bet. Outside of Events there will not be anything new that they haven't announced. In this month, and I would say next month. 
---
Scrap OR sell! Lost my furious lvl 50 mole miner‚Äôs gauntlet today, RIP :(
---
"Nuked squirrels" nothing like thinking your safe then dying from powerful knee bites
---
Awesome! Now how do you feel about unique weapons/armor from FO3 and NV? (I haven't played much of 1 or any of 2 so I'm unsure if they exist in those games)
---
I quit trying after it crashed on me 3 times.  Haven't tried it since the last patch though, might give it another shot.
---
I have 19k caps, and I didn‚Äôt get the earn 10k trophy.
---
Are you riffle gaming
---
Where at? This shit is absurdly hard to find. 
---
I experienced the same thing. I got a couple legendary spears out of it 
---
Exactly. Double super duper, once creating stable flu. And once more creating ammo or whatever else from it. 
---
Also - green thumb of course. 
---
You get violet from
---
- flash ferns (95%)
---
- goo plants (if you use them immediately when you approach them) (4%)
---
- tarberries in the trenches (for example there‚Äôs a few next to the windmill in the south part)
---
Nowhere near ten fold, a simple bloody weapon can easily destroy the wasteland. Same goes for 2 shot, although that will suffer after the patch. Melee will be dmg meta after the patch.
---
hey at least it aint smashing you over the head with a minigun
---
That would be very nice...
---
I have arrived to have missions fail within 15 seconds of me arriving.

Short for Garrahan
---
I would like if they made you make different characters so they could tweak somethings in the normal mode of the game like the food and water thing
---
Upvoting. I think this is an important perspective.
---
That's tough, man. But maybe you're not playing the game that you think you're playing.
---
As stated, I think you shouldn't opt out. You should embrace it. Life in the best of terms is tough. We're playing a game in the worst of terms. There's a little buy in required of you, otherwise you might be continually disappointed. Because shit is going down in this game. Some asshole lets himself go nuts and randomly attacks without reason. Isn't that fallout as eff?
---
I'm willing to hear you out, though.
---
The Whitespring would seem like an appropriate place to get it done along with reception and everything, to be honest. Even has a nice spot for dining and shopping. 
---
There‚Äôs an Ithaca model where that‚Äôs the case. 
---
It ejects out the bottom. 
---
This is the first I‚Äôve heard of it coming back, my personal belief is that you are likely mistaken about it.
---
"Oh I know, Vaultie, this shit *burns*"
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the president thing is pvp most of the new power armor skins are tied to factions and pvp it seems although I hope I‚Äôm wrong 
---
I think silence gets the point across whether you don't have a mic or you just don't feel like using it.
---
EXACTLY! I AM poor, and I managed to get the money for the base game. Why should you be able to have an advantage because you have money and terrible spending habits? You sound like a fucking high class elitist, moron.
---
It wouldn't make sense since they were wiped out before they got the plans on the suit/developed the suit. A Fire Breather paint job theorectically doesn't exist since they (Responders) never made one.
---
Ah - it did have escorts.  Thought it might've been a key card, but wasn't sure and didnt want a wanted tag.  Was overcucumbered with a bunch of junk.
---
My all plastic and aluminum toaster is a feather compared to the Iron Worker tongs in the game.  Those things can weigh a several pounds easy.
---
Sell them to vendors? Not the best effect/weapon combinations
---
I was impressed when I saw this in game.  Shame there are not more skill checks.
---
*What about Raider users????*
---
Just what its saying in the pip boy I know its a lot more with crits and sneak and all that, but the pipboy number is object.
---
The devs don‚Äôt bother to have the plan names match the construction names. 
---
I asked this during BETA and everyone thought I was making it up  
---
People do this to grief and it's annoying as hell
---
Eh I seeing less bumblebee, more Bulldozer with the look.
---
All I want are for the spotlights from the Torso to actually appear on the armor and not just in the inventory
---
I have an idea related to sitting - make the ‚Äúpick shit up‚Äù button different from the ‚Äúsit‚Äù button. It‚Äôs completely aggravating to jam the ‚ÄúPSU‚Äù button to clear off s tab,e covered in loot only to get locked into the sit down animation accidentally. 
---
p.s. this is for console, btw
---
Yeah creation club was one of fallouts greatest features imo to keep the game interesting, would love to see a nuka cola painted excavator armor chinese combat armor or maybe a mini nuke themed t60 armor paint job, there are way to many players in power armor suits running around the game and the means of standing out in a crowd are very limited (american patriot, camo, northern lights, nuka cola, BOS, etc) the goal should be to make it as unlikely as possible to find another player with a paint skin exactly the same as yours.   
---
Well you might wanna spend that time studying... You're gonna need it man
---
I could be wrong but the inside the vault announcement, said imagine the game you are playing but with PVP restrictions removed. I don't know if they plan on changing any of the mechanics outside of that. 
---
If they're one-stars nothing but vendor food. 2/3 depending on what the other rolls are
---
That small gift would have gone a long way in the PR department.  Even it was just a shitty hat and outfit.  
---
Even Fortnite allows free users to earn stuff.  Shame Bethesda, shame.
---
I'm actually working on a costume like that right now. It's tough.
---
(1) 99% of the gear that drops in nuke zones is garbage. After fifteen minutes I have junk legendaries overloading my inventory. You can find other spots to farm legendaries that aren't as hard that give just as good gear. Watoga is great for farming legendaries.
---
(2) The difficulty of nuke zones at the moment is equivelant to "easy" or "very easy" in fallout 4 if you're at a decent level. It's not remotely challenging for me. Since we can't change the difficulty of this game like we could in Fallout 4, I think a "very hard" zone would be pretty cool. So, no, its not a joke. 
---
(3) In 76, I leveled up from 1-100 wearing zero armor except a harness on my first character. The only exception was hazmat suits in nuke zones. By the end, I was sneak attack soloing level 80 scorchbeasts in my underwear with a deathclaw gauntlet. With Scaly Skin, Grounded, Barbarian, Evasive, Dodgy, Lone Wanderer, Moving Target... I was as tanky as anyone wearing  combat armor... 
---

Maybe that's why holiday items were released a day or so before Xmas in the shop.  Holiday items should have been at least 2 weeks before becoming irrelevant.

Praise be to the wise mothman, may his 5% XP bonus guide you through the wasteland.....

It depends on the story behind it. Legendary weapons (and creatures) in Fo76 and Fo4 have no story and no justification to exist. In an Elder Scrolls game they could call these "magical" instead of legendary and that would fine because magic is a thing that is ridiculously common in the Elder Scrolls universe. There is no lore in the Fallout universe to support these common (and often stupidly silly) items. It was an arbitrary "design" choice that is at conflict with the lore, theme and genre of Fallout.  
---
Depends what his major is.
---
Unless there has been a recent change I've opened many, many drops that I have not requested and not been made wanted.
---
Horde events are always random levels. I picked up a lvl 50 from a super mutant in the Forest today. Watoga has a few "dungeon" buildings with high chances to spawn legendaries, I usually just hop to the hospital over and over because it's usually a 3 star there
---
That's the best armor. My biggest pain was not being able to carry a lot of stuff. Excavator armor takes care of that.

Sorry for not listening/reading carefully.

But we may have come to an impasse. Embrace the loss. Get in the game. Stealth your base. Git gud. ü•∞

That was what I encountered my first time there, about level 15. Its been super mutants every other time though, and scorched.

This is nice. I like seeing camps that blend right in. Best compliment I had was a user saying they didn‚Äôt realize my place wasn‚Äôt an in game asset.

IM LEVEL 107...And ive just done this also. spent a couple of hours at the weekend, moved camp and built a brand new proper abode. i love it too. feels like coming home now 
---
By the looks on the tongs laying around in  Prickett's Fort, I'd assume they could be easily used as a weapon. Unique version would be proudly named *Balls Buster* then.

Anti-armor and instigating will be great

Can you pass the dog food üëÄüëÄ
---
I did that weeks ago but just now got it I guess? 
---
You gotta post lvl, system and price
---
100% agree.  Who cook steak by stirring it in a pot??
---
Decks really are the best option.
---
A card can only go in one, making dupes useful. We get a new tab under the main pipboy screen to swap decks (Status, Inventory, Decks, etc).
---
Boom. 
---
I use the neck scar for that.
---
I finished that weeks ago and just now got it I guess?
---
They said quarter 1.  A lot of people took that as January lol. Now it's Feb, then March.  It won't be ready for a while yet.
---
Yes you can craft things to your level. It's why I walk around with dual lvl50 black powder pistols. 
---
I have been, even accessing the computer.
---
WoW didn't start with a good 'endgame' just the same old content to play that you used to get too the end game content.  But they added more, and more, and more content as time went on, adding in more content and pushing the end game further and further out.
---
FYI check the suitcases and registers at vendors (particularly white springs and watoga), endgame players leave legendaries there for new players
---
Yeah I mean I could make you just a plain rifle..

What the eternal shit is up with your post title? Also make sure the legs aren't broken

Can sombody please sell me a lever action 
---
Super Duper and fluxes may help, as crafted cores can have over 100% charge
---
PvP is needed to keep the game alive.  Cause there sure as shit ain't no decent content or endgame.
---
Yeah poor you. You want to deny everyone the chance to increase their stash because you are not willing to spend real money or time to get the atoms. All you care about is yourself. You don't care about the company making money to support the game. You don't care about everyone being able to get it. All you care about is denying others because some might choose to spend real money. It's called envy.
---
At first I thought you were replying to me I was like what I role play? Lol 
---
There are already plenty of shooters out there. If that's what you are after than go play one of those. The game I am playing is multiplayer Fallout. The game I am playing is about rebuilding the world as Reclaimers, not raiding players. The fact that there are clearly people who prefer pvp and people who prefer group pve (or solo if that's your thing) tells me there needs to be a way to group up the servers. Let everyone who wants to run around shooting each other play on their own world and those of us who would rather team up against the world play on another. 
---
I got all 3 Free States bunkers this morning and got cores from all of them.

Luck of the draw I guess.

It seems like the game could've actually been really good, but for some reason they had time constraints that forced them to rush the game out the door ASAP. While it's still enjoyable (for me at least), you gotta wonder what would've happened had they not had to face time constraints.
---
Seems liks that has a habit of plaguing Fallout games, doesn't it?
---
The Holiday gift part hit me like a ton of bricks. They actually wanted to be awesome people and give us a little Holiday gift (likely the T-51 paint), but *something* made them unable to do so. Shame, really.
---
Broken on PS4, as well. Last patch. Really want my concrete.
---
For me, at least, I'd simply like to have the lore I've discovered available in an app. Read it on my lunch hour, on the bus, etc.   
---
I've been asking for this for Fallout/Elder Scrolls games... since there's been Fallout/Elder Scrolls games. Does anybody ever REALLY read all the books in Skyrim or all the Terminals in Fallout 4 *while* they're playing?
---
You aren't there target market.  Groups of PvPers will spend more money than role playing sims.
---
I have the assorted light plan but i don't remember these.   Ill check again
---
Ridiculous
---
Mine is pretty basic as I don't have a lot of plans yet, it took a while to get the first foundation placed at height and angle that would allow the walls to be placed on the existing roof. [https://youtu.be/48Kh-XMG9-E](https://youtu.be/48Kh-XMG9-E)
---
Agreed 
---
I wish someone knew the answer to this question. I keep having this problem regularly. I googled it and your question was the first to pop up. The mission just randomly fails with plenty of time on the clock. This last time there wasn't a single enemy around either
---
&gt;A confirmation dialogue box would cover this.
---
There is a confirmation message. "scrap $xxxxx?" pops up before you scrap anything that isn't junk.
---
People just hit buttons too fucking fast and don't pay attention to what they're doing. 
---
That would require effort.
---
Just lost 4 stable Cobalt flux I was going to use to upgrade my vault suit. Had that glitch where it says you don't have enough materials to craft, but clearly I did. I read the only way to fix it is to drop the materials and pick them up again. So of course I drop them and they disappeared. I'm so pissed. I spent so much time farming blast zones! I'm seriously considering giving up 76 for a while.
---
Well, if they are taking place in what Bethesda says is a high- level portion of the map why should the levels be random?  Are you  seriously telling me it makes sense for enemies to drop level-30 gear in both in both Grafton  and cranberry bog? 
---
my favorite is the drill. 
---
What does bulking up the accounts mean
---
Blacksmith tongs are made of iron and are very heavy duty due to the heat they need to withstand, the forces needed to hold the hot metal when working with it, and also to resist the hammer that may hit them.
---
Toasters are pretty light, and are mostly air. Nintendo 64's are heavier.
---
Honestly, instead of legendary enemies dropping weapons with special effects have them drop legendary mods you can apply to the appropriate weapon group (melee for melee, guns for guns, armors for armors etc) which would also allow us to get Legendary PA pieces, and hell it'd let us get the unlisted legendary pa/hazmat effect as a potential thing to put on other armor chest pieces, which is 50% reduction of all incoming radiation, before resistances
---
Nice place mate!  That one and the one I got to see you building.  
---
I'm confused. Has the nerf even dropped yet?
---
This isn't like a "Hostel" thing, right? Like, some rich players are paying you to set this up so when people get there you can sedate them? Next thing you know, you're waking up tied to a chair with someone coming at you with a Mr Handy Buzz Blade. I see you, OP. I see you. No, but seriously, this sounds cool. I'll have to check this out. 
---
Let me continue. In the other fallout games--all of them--you're the psychopath, even when you're playing a nice person. Think about how many establishments you rolled up without thinking twice. How many people you put down without reason.
---
This game evens the odds. You might be the person that's put down.
---
But cheer up! The losses are basically inconsequential. It's mostly feelings and ego.
---
+1 you‚Äôd enjoy stealth rifle build imo 
---
We're well past "screenshot or it didn't happen" levels on my personal skepticism scale at this point. So many anecdotal stories getting picked up by YouTubers and treated as fact.
---
Which is 25 caps per workshop. Which is only useful if you're going in and out of that area often
---
No, *smiles*
---
Yeah, I like to call it ‚Äúninja looting.‚Äù I kill and loot them so fast, they‚Äôre dead and naked before they hit the ground.
---
You want a regular rifle or a legendary one?
---
In general, they should start the camera in a selfie position, not looking at what you‚Äôre looking at, or at least have a button to instantly swap it there 
---
That actually would be pretty cool.
---
 It might be a bit discouraging for people to invest alot if it's a constant target to be attacked as that just means more resources to continually invest.
---
 But if we could hold more resources in our stashes then it would be less of a "risk".
---
NO üëè FINE üëè PRESSURE üëè SENSORS
---
I have had this, tried to re-add the parts to the chassis, but they were already 'on it' but putting on the Chassis didn't equip them.
---
Resolved it, I had to go into the pip-boy and 'wear' the missing pieces (While wearing the chassis), which put them on instantly, despite not being at power armour station.
---
Reduced feels like non-existent anymore. I haven't needed fusion cores yet but every fusion generator has been empty for me
---
No, I care about FAIRNESS and BALANCE you stupid fuck.
---
They could just refund the cost of the item.
---
I had a sort of cliffside spot near a water source. I haven't played in a hot minute, so I can't remember exactly, but I know it's in the east. I want to say it was relatively close to Site Bravo.
---
The river forked and split two ways, there was a bridge...but even if it was remote, it still had company every few server hops. Had 4 large purifiers running there.
---
I hope they didn't just nerf explosive expecting pvp to be balanced, explosive wasn't even that great after they updated fireproof. Only people that can afford sentinel will compete. 
---
Well no wonder you think you understand it. You've never even touched any of the other Fallout games ever. Even 76 craps on 4's lore by shoving in Far Harbor's unique creatures (and even some one off weapons like the Cryolator) into the map because reasons.
---
Def works for armour. works for literally everything you can craft...
---
If you have enough to keep rebulking/breaking down bulked items, you can increase most crafting items. (assuming you have enough plastic.)
---
It‚Äôs not the acidity of alchohol that gives it sterilizing properties
---
I'd *love* to see this. I spent *days* in Fallout 4 building settlements, and I've already played around with a few public workshops. (Had a really nice outpost at Wade Airport a few days ago.)
---
If I could redeploy it and expand it, I'd take over the Forest every time I log in.
---
Change the rules of the game?
---
Sure. The rules of the game would be changed. I'd have no argument, because there wouldn't be one.
---
If that's what you want. 
---
Just to be clear its a bar what im trying to do is to gather every people in my camp
---
It‚Äôd be nice.. I‚Äôve only liked blackbird so far.
---
And record it
---
Im sure it has a nice personality 
---
Do you know if the bear rug can be found lying around? Or must it be purchased?
---
Nope. Has not. Just the notes for next patch.
---
Right but how the hell do you know someone is/was a super?  They got banned=new account.  This is like being scared of the boogie man.  I just bought a tse shotgun from a guy and I can‚Äôt even use it for another 13 levels(granted I would never pay cash for something like that). Does that mean he shouldn‚Äôt have sold it to me?  
---
I like this idea... as long as duping and such is under control. otherwise people will abuse the hell out of it. Would be worse to constantly find vendors with nothing but purified water.. or with 987 bulk steel.
---
I like this idea. Adding onto it, I think it would be cool if we had something similar to the FO4 store thay you could setup in your camp. Except it's full of inventory you're wanting to sell. This way, people can visit your camp or store or wherever it is that you set it up, and buy from you.
---
Because we go so much stuff that becomes useless later on, it'll also help us clear up some space and help other players out. The stock rotation is a little too random for my taste. 
---
There are theories and hints that FO and ES are in the same universe/timeline, so maybe mutations were the start of magic? I mean you can get a mutation that zaps melle attackers with electricity, doesn't that sound a bit like magic?
---
It wouldn't hurt anyone to just have favoriting a weapon stop it from being removed, and the only way to un-favorite is a confirmation box in the pipboy.
---
that is awesome!  Excellent and creative build.   
---
This is pretty impressive. I didn't realize the flamers did so much damage.
---
Layout of the place is awesome and I especially like the lakeside deck area.
---
Plus points for powered doors as always.
---
Great work dude.
---
Still selling?
---
r/woosh
---
Omfg I'd make jetpacks for free if my Super Duper perk card procs.
---
... this isn't fallout 5. This is just an in-between spin-off title. They should've named it Fallout World or something, tbh. But yeah. This is something many have wanted. If you don't want this, play Fo4 or NV. 
---
They were going to give players a gift, and rightly so for all the fuckups and server disconnects.  Never mind just some Goodwill and holiday spirit.  But some jackass at Bethesda decided not to.  Fuck this game and fuck Bethesda.   
---
From an Animation perspective, yes.
---
From a PERK perspective, no.
---
Thanks very much! There is also 3 Tesla coils and 2 radiation emitters behind the cabinet:)
---
Depends how tolerant you are. Servers are still dodgy and crash frequently. Most game breaking bugs seem to be patched.
---
Good point, Having a 3 stack, 2 stack and individual is useful, (I do tend to rank all my cards up.) 
---
Love the idea of having it in the pipboy screen.
---
Thanks!!
---
I play both this and fo4 still. Just saying I'd rather Bethesda stick to what they are good at: single player worlds. Sorry that opinion twisted your panties so much.
---
I own every fallout game and I still think it's fun as hell. :) (and my first was NV. I bought the others later. FO4 is my least favorite. This got rid of all the things I hated about FO4 and what I would prefer out of it. Still doesn't mean I don't want a proper Fallout 5. I do. I just also enjoy this.
---
I‚Äôve got around 30hrs. I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore after that. Forgot this sub is a fucking circlejerk 
---
2423 fusion cell rounds lost in one shot with the two shot salvaged assultrons head gone to one scorched commander. Yea not thrilled at all with fallout 76 on Xbox one....
---
The devs are working on it and they're promising more content + semi-frequent patches that include bug fixes.
---
A lot of the disconnects aren't even Bethesda fault as much as it is the isp or even the people's own connection at home to their isp
---
And it's reactions like yours that make the community terrible
---
I also want pictures of others having the funs
---
Maybe as a reclaimer you have to prepare and brace yourself for apeshit nuts people on the road. You keep to your code. They lost theirs. They lost their way. You prepared for such a thing.
---
Different quests trigger differently.  Sometimes you find an item, sometimes you talk to someone, sometimes you just need to go to the general region or specific location.  If you disconnect you lose the quest for the day.

---
I found a legit TSE myself. After 180 lvls and likely 40 Whitesprings run. I did however purchase two TSE weapons that where mysteriously underpriced LOL. But I thankfully held onto a handful of furious weapons I've found. I...just...couldn't...shake the feeling...of...this shit is getting nerfed as fuck...ya know? 
---
Get it... or don't.
---
We're not your dad &lt;3
---
Works great for me
---
You stop and think that not everyone is ABLE (not WILLING) to spend money on a game they've already paid for? And time is money, so if I spent more time earning Atoms then I'd actually be more poor than I already am.
---
"Sorry I can't come into work today, I gotta spend my time earning Atoms!"
---
Fucking Christ you're stupid.
---
PotatoToucher. West coast USA. I'm on pretty frequently. 
---
This ^ often can find 250 per serum on fo76bazaar 
---
Why are you here then?
---
I mean come on man give us something, you have people ready to slam lever actions up your ass and you're not biting? Its been seventeen minutes!?!!?
---
Is it level dependent? I've done every single daily and event that this outfit is a reward for in the past month and I've only received combat armor pieces as a outfit reward. I am level 110
---
Can you just fast travel to your camp or are you overencumbered? FYI I had a 250 bounty and logged in and got killed before the game fully loaded so if you can fast travel you have the same odds of keeping your stuff as if you can get to a friend
---
I must have gone in shortly after you bc they were empty for me. Or bad luck. One of the two.
---
I got a second one doing the arktos pharma crop spraying event.
---
Sometimes the game runs great without any problems. Some people have bad luck or good luck, depending on perhaps some bug or server stability. It's definitely worth getting at whatever price it's available at. I don't regret paying full release price for it, but I am surprised at some of the discounts it has gotten since.
---
If you wanna be an asshole raider like me, do this:
---
Go to some random scrub who is in their workshop just minding their own business. Act natural and gain their trust. Once they turn their back on you, claim the workshop. This will activate pvp and give you the first hit advantage. Also, destroying their shit doesn‚Äôt add bounty. If you‚Äôre lucky you can get their junk they forgot to store. But the caps you spent on claiming the workshop? You get back from killing said player. More often than not, they‚Äôll come running back looking for revenge, just kill them for more caps. 
---
Disclaimer: You‚Äôll almost always get some salties trying to get you back. So if you get griefed or killed or eaten or whatever don‚Äôt blame me I‚Äôm just giving you info, do what you want with it.
---
Have fun out there raiders! I‚Äôm a monster &gt;:D
---
I was just considering a pressure plate and garage door trap since i dint have powered gates so this is helpful. Where did you get the flamer plan?
---
It would.  Team A with 8 players, containing 2 teams.  Even Fortnite does this on 50v50.  Just has multiple 4 man team on the same side.
---
I mean legit, what if a player is deaf or non verbal? the current emotes are not good enough imo. I understand the immersion of no text but really ... I want to communicate and mic isn't happening so I wish we had more basic emotes. 
---
Randomly got intense rads like that down in the bog a while ago, maybe during the beta maybe after. Even a hazmat suit didn't wholly protect me, something was up. Possibly the same problem.
---
thank you!
---
also as an add on im offering 25k for this outfit or the traveling leather coat.
---
Bruh
---
Right? There needs to be more variety
---
Most shops I see are unclaimed and Im never motivated to do so either. My ideal would be to buff them significantly and make them open pvp areas (shoot on sight, no bounty). 
---
Ill take the 2* 10mm and the raider leg with junk reduced! Could you add me please? PSN BirdJP19
---
Too bad you're on PS4, I would've totally leveled your house by now.  
---
Yep.. just got this one. 
---
I love you.
---
People are reaching the point where they have all the loot they need except 1 or two select pieces. Farming the queen and things like that are irrelevant (even though you can get serum recipes) if you‚Äôre looking for a 3 star unyielding sentinel +1 strength heavy bos combat armor left leg that you can just trade for.
---
&lt;3 &lt;3
---
I've DEFINITELY heard Rose say that voice line to my character. I've always had problems with her voice lines on my main character. She is constantly talking over herself, in person or on the radio station. After a quest I went back to her and she said the line up there.
---
There's a cliff area with a few nice size ponds around the monorail lift, a little south of it maybe. When I pass through going to the relay tower I sometimes see someone built up there.
---
exactly why I refuse to put prox mic on. 
---
you on xbox by chance
---
I built mine on a river, so my crops have water. 
---
Perhaps add a See No Evil, Hear No Evil, and Speak No Evil emotes
---
Same for me, I was mad
---
i will take that 3* right arm when i come online.
---
psn: Jullz_Wolf
---
add me plz
---
ty
---
Yep they‚Äôre starting to fall apart as a company. It‚Äôs going to get to the point where they only care about money if there not already there. Just to reinforce this they‚Äôre getting so lazy they‚Äôre using the same outdated engine as they used for Morrowind. Agreed shame on you Bethesda.
---
The flame thrower &amp; Tesla traps are quest rewards, can‚Äôt remember which, and powered gates are from Grahm :) 
---
I must admit I don't read all but I do most I found some stories on how the monsters in Appalachia came to be quite interesting 
---
I've got people denying this so I may as well film myself being a bandit
---
*Finally, an emote request that makes sense* /s
---
I have Fallout 76 on PC
---
Oddly enough, betraying someone I've already acted friendly with comes pretty hard for me lol.
---
As for the disclaimer, any good raider knows what they're signing up for. If you're going to be the bad guy, be completely prepared to be dealt with like one!
---
From what I've seen, you can request the refund and you get the 800 back and also keep the stuff you unlocked. At least, it used to be that way.
---
Nah you're the stupid one who thinks just because some people have more time or money ($5?) than you that the game should be "fair" for everyone. If you don't have time to spend playing the game that is your problem. Always with the sob stories. So just make them game suck for everyone because you don't have as much time to play it as somebody else. Always with the whiny sob stories. Always the same. People who are not willing to support the game think they can dictate how it should be for everyone else because they "don't have much time to play it as someone else". As i f it even takes much time to get your daily and weekly atoms.
---
I have a lvl 104 that is roughly this build, and agree.  One shots all day with a non-legendary hunting rifle, and the endgame gauss is even better.  The build is also great for pvp or hunting bounties if you‚Äôre into that.  +1 about weak in nuked areas, largely due to the also mentioned stealth bugs.  Very effective against SBs outside nuked areas.  Biggest downside imo is constant struggle with encumbrance 
---
Done.  Animation shared with the ‚Äúthumbs up emote.‚Äù  600 atoms please.
---
Damn i was hoping i could help. Sorry man. Had anyone recently set a nuke off in that silo?
---
Ok I'll friend you but cant play today.
---
Look for the bear in the bottom part of the map. A literal gold mine of good house spots.
---
I cannot tell you how many times I‚Äôve wanted to express this to randoms but I lacked the ability to do so
---
You sell duped equipment and you're shit talking the game now?
---
Worst part of the game is people like you.
---
Go fuck off somewhere else.
---
Are you on PS4? I have the mod. Willing to sell; I think I‚Äôm going with one of the other mods instead. 
---
Pvp can be a bit toxic.
---
BEFORE YOU BUY : this game is online and has Player vs Player in it. Meaning that some other player (human being ,not NPC) can and will shoot you and your belongings. Hope you read my message and save us from future " OMG cheter lvel 100++ kille my in 1 shot OMFG"
---
I've had generally interesting encounters with people. There is something humanizing about an actual voice. People treat always text chat more like a bulletin board and spam it with all sorts of shit.
---
They weren't useless, they provided oil. 
---
There were two nuked areas on the map when I logged in, but I don't know which silo they came from.
---
Another suggestion I'd have is Workshop Bonus events.
---
Every once in a while, 3x ammo production at the Munitions factory for an amount of time.
---
Or x2 the rate of Fusion Core production at a power plant. 
---
There's at least one other. I can't remember which.
---
Give me shiva or give me death
---
Buying stuff or selling stuff isn't cheating. Not sure  if the people were banned for duping or for something else, and it seems like a leap the OP is making.
---
Increasing cost by distance penalizes people who just wanna get across the map quick, usually to do a bartering run. A flat rate would make it easier on those people and still encourage exploration by making it less worth it to fast travel to places in walking distance, and make your fast travel decisions based on what you think is worth it instead of what you can afford.
---
He also spawns at Lady janet\`s soft serve north of vault 76  ,he will spawn just above the turkey  on the map ,good luck
---
Believe me, I feel you. I finally had a decent shotgun drop for me and I started a new character for it and was just about to hit the half way point before being able to equip it and boom, by the time I am it won‚Äôt be nearly as good.  
---
I wouldn‚Äôt give up yet though. I think they are going to adjust DR and HP on enemies, but that‚Äôs speculation. Also they are getting ready for more content releases so there is that.
---
That could have been a huge issue then. Some have cool down periods. And so does an individual if they try to set to many off too quickly.
---
A white flag
---
It's not so bad. Wait and see how it goes. It will probably still be ok with all the perks.
---
guess I'm the opposite. As someone with a life and a fraction of the time available to grind like some do, I don't really care about real money being used to keep up, though I'd rather it go to Bethesda. I do hate exploits and economy ruining BS though.
---
Try a lobby with no zones
---
I don't like the idea of the no mic symbol because sometimes I don't feel like talking and don't want others to know I can.
---
You get 20 caps for clearing a workshop.  And then usually around 50 caps worth of sellable junk and aid (plus a plan) for claiming it.  You're making a small amount of caps by claiming a workshop.
---
This is like a shitpost summing the entire subreddit. 
---
"Please guve us [Specific thing Beth doesn't care about], please."
---
Agreed. I‚Äôm not one for PVP but I see it as a chance to use my skills and the FO76 environment to get myself out of scrapes with other players. A few days ago I was at the Artisan‚Äôs corner trying to manage my 600 lb stash, as we do, when this asshole comes up and attacks with a powerfist. He was at least 50 levels higher than me. I wasn‚Äôt about to lose the junk I still had on me and didn‚Äôt have much time before having to log off for the night, so I gave a thumbs down and ran off hoping he‚Äôd get the hint. He did not. So, I ran outside hoping to sprint off to safety but as soon as we loaded in outdoors he was there and he attacked. I tried to run but was crippled so I just jumped around spamming watered down stim packs, then the dude must have hit a sentrybot and the fury of the Whitespring robot army descended upon his ass. I heard him say ‚Äúfuck‚Äù and was gone. I love those helpful hunks of metal. 
---
Im inviting more
---
Feels bad man. I actually like the tommy, good capacity, decent fire rate.
---
I use the grass one so I lose fewer bags in cranberry bog
---
Finally someone said it, it's been really hard communicating this to other players.
---
I dunno, my opinion is it would encourage lazy game playing, just fast travelling everywhere,initially ppl wouldnt fast travel short distances because they remember it used to be cheaper, but eventually its all the same, so just fast travel everywhere. But to each their own.
---
No, make the game EQUAL/FAIR/BALANCED is what i want, you want it to suck with all youe MTX because you feel like you're better than everyone else and deserve to have this extra shit that other's can't or won't buy. Shit like this is why exactly why BF2 sucked so much ass. Have a long, lonely life fucktard.
---
Same, so glad I saw it in those two or three days it was available
---
Sucks for everyone else &lt;.&lt;
---
Seems quite limited right now, on xbox at least
---
Rad Storms sometimes do that even if it‚Äôs on your screen but not hitting you 
---
We quit and logged in again when it got the bugged the first time. It put us on a different server the second time, and there weren't any nuke zones on the second server.
---
So I don't think that is the issue. I think the issue is Fallout 76 is buggy as hell. Thanks for the info though.
---
I‚ÄôM FAMOUS!
---
Probably not wrong xb1 servers have been fucked cause of dupers. Sorry again
---
&gt;And I had a metric shit ton of 10mm
---
How'd you do that? I don't have any issues with shotgun shells and .45, but I can barely keep my incendiary 10mm SMG fed.
---
Bethesda has said they do not currently support mods in Fallout 76.
---
Lots of people claim they're banning mod users.
---
I've used QoL mods extensively since launch and have not been banned.
---
1) PS4
---
2) PSN: u4yk10
---
4) Every so often my character who is running will just stop for about a split-second, and then my running will resume -- and often I will vacillate between stop and start.  At first, I thought it was because I was overencumbered, but this occurs when my AP bar is more than 50% full, and it even happens when I'm not overencumbered.  This is making me a rage since the game will just stop me in the middle of a river to take on radiation or stop to take damage from the overpowered horde that I was trying to flee from.  This has been happening regularly since the latest patch.  The game is literally unplayable, and not in the meme sense, either.  Seriously, I'm not only fighting against the creatures inside your sandbox, but also your glitches outside of it, too.  
---
I like this suggestion.  This could also eliminate the bit where claiming a shop turns the owner hostile for a certain time frame, regardless of where you two are on the map. 
---
What do you want in return? I would love even a normal one 
---
The last patch changed it
---
Since it's probably a remnant of duplication... probably not. Realistically these things should be rare enough that they cost a LOT of caps to convince a person to part with one unless they got it cheap from a duper or they are a duper.
---
It's your opinion and the experience of the past many others. Your one opinion did not cause this.
---
So let me get this straight, you were wanted. You then fought a guy and lost. And now are extremely upset with pvp despite them giving you things worth way more than any junk?
---
It is still going to be strong as fuck after the nerf.
---
The bitching and moaning about the nerf is way over blown.
---
My reaction is to how Bethesda are handling this game.  If they actually cared about the fan base then half the stuff would be a non issue.
---
As for disconnects.  I get 0 when playing rainbow six, overwatch, Fortnite.  Yet I get disconnects all the time on Fallout 76.  It's not my isp it's Bethesda mate.  I do queen runs all the time and when in a party of 8 at least someone gets disconnected every time or there game crashes.
---
That's another thing , when the game crashes I suppose that's my internet too?  The buzz crash I only ever get playing fallout games so that is tied to them.  Let's face it.  Bethesda straight up lied to customers, falsely advertised, released an unfinished game.  The game is beta at best.  That isn't on me that's on them.  
---
I was willing to give all these a pass in the hopes of improvement.  But the 150 fixes means shit when more bugs appear.  How on Earth did the slider to left bug make it in?  Only way is that they don't test the game properly.  Double loading screens, freezing on login, spawning inside your base, power armor unequipping on ft, can't see team mate.  .I could go on and on...
---
Now with 0 end game content and pieces of fallout 4 being resold to us via the atom shop...it's just laziness to the highest degree.  Bethesda should be ashamed of the state of this game.   Even for their standards.  What makes it worse is that at times it is seriously fun to play and has the potential to be one of the greatest games made.  This is negated by rampant disconnects, crashes and greedy practices.  
---
All this game is a testing bed for future multiplayer.  You bet your ass Starfield and ES6 will use this multiplayer.  I've tried to support this game but right now it's Bethesda that are at fault for the community, not fans.  
---
9 times out of 10 I do those stupid horde missions and a random mob takes out the leader meaning I burned caps for nothing
---
Early game i went to the nuka factory in the forest.
---
There's lots lying around
---
If you‚Äôre on pc there‚Äôs a mod on the nexus that labels known plans on the merchants. 
---
AxtonTheAce, I bet you are one of those people that think there should be no money, all should be the same. Everyone should work for the greater good, and the state will provide everything for you. 
---
Guess what, that was attempted and failed. Tens of millions of people died due to famine, and oh a ruthless government that didn't give a shit about its people. 
---
Not new. Happens to me sometimes.
---
Yes please :)
---
Last event I failed was a Fly Swatter (super easy) but not so easy for a melee character with weak ranged weapons and 20 seconds left on the timer.
---
Lol wait  what does the electric chair actually do and where can I get one!?
---
Wait, no. I didn't have a tse loadout. Everyone else seemed to. I had an E loadout. Sad face. 
---
Try grinding Rust for two days only to have your base raided offline and all your loot gone, with signs saying "Ez Raid", leaving you naked on the beach. This game is soft, don't let the little things bother you dude, it's just a few mats.
---
Does 29 dmg all at once? I find that hard to believe 
---
New people always look at me strangely when I drop 3 canned dog food and 6 water.  
---
Why not upgrade to a 45 for a little more protection?
---
Honestly in my opinion, most of the tse's aren't even that op to begin with.
---
No. I accidently shot a turret and became wanted. Like I randomly did it and you already downvoted the post. I'm saying pvp can be a bit toxic. I deleted my other post out of pity since it backfired on me. I just got pissed he took my loot and then I messaged him and he rubbing in my fucking face. I really don't care if I get downvoted anymore.
---
Same here, level 90 in game is &gt; icedtee84 &lt; and not interested in PvP had been griefed way too many times by a combo of much higher level players along with lower level ones only to be one shotted/ one hit.  Frustrated by not being able to defend myself i went and bought a bundle of TSE's. I am just about to quit playing the game but my GF still plays it, so im also thinking of downloading text chat from the nexus as we are on PC.
---
Better have that Luck skill up 
---
Fallout as eff. Love it.
---
No. You just now noticed it. It's been in your inventory, taking up 0 weight, since then...
---
But now that you've placed and claimed it, it weighs 10lbs like normal.
---
They fixed giving out free food to the server but not the part where the event eats up power armor.  ü§∑
---
Unfortunately the chair does nothing, which, in my opinion, is a major oversight. I don't remember where I found the plans to build it. 
---
There is no specific thanks emote
---
I didnt even know there was a market in this game
---
Yeah. I'm not angry anymore. I'm a bit lucky or maybe the dude could of caught me offguard with all my black titanium on me. It ain't no big deal. I got 2 two shot weapons (Handmade and a lever action) And I launched a nuke today. For the first time without crashing on my first attempt. I shouldn't let it get to me.
---
I'd be down for just larger / more deadly / tankier versions of existing enemies.  Boss sentry bot, raise the health, damage, and size, etc, etc.
---
Make other zones worth nuking!
---
Someone dropped a nuke on Monongah and there is nobody in there.  Only 1 spawn point is covered by the nuke.  Essentially a waste of a nuke.
---
Yea its mostly the shotgun but still a good damage boost
---
The rewards list doesn‚Äôt exactly state it‚Äôs a full set of ultracite. I was worried because I was too low of a level to actually wear it but it auto recalled after the 60 seconds. 
---
You kinda just get used to it.
---
It‚Äôs buggy in its current state, but not enough to freak out over. 95 percent of it is not game breaking. Expect crashes every once in a while.
---
Getting good gear and materials without working for it.
---
 Assuming that the universes are the same and that Bethesda has engineered it that way changes nothing. That would be even lazier design. It would be heavily winking to the player and pointing to some retconned connection that tells no story and goes nowhere. It hold about as much weight as Bethesda's grasp of how the mechanics of the Fallout universe work.
---
and servers more than 24
---
It‚Äôs already there. They have a full menu in your ‚Äúalternate‚Äù menu. You just have to select the correct one. For this one you use alt and F4 at the same time. That will bring you to the correct emote menus for the complicated ones. Hope this helps!
---
I think it would be cool to RP the Free States and use a gold standard.  1 Gold scrap = 1 cap if you're selling to a vendor anyways
---
True. It's always nice.
---
Might have to add you on tonight my in game is - icedtee84 
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and as far as I know duping was never an issue there.  At least I‚Äôve not seen any evidence of it.  Then again I have no idea how they‚Äôre doing it but I fail to see why I would want thousands of item x. Just seems like a shitty way of ruining the game for myself and others.  That‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt get with duping...why be overencumbered all the time because I want 1200 yum yum deviled eggs?
---
In a gym it means getting bigger trough the use of steroids, so by the use of money in this game?
---
We should be able to LOCK items so they can't be scrapped, sold, dropped or traded.
---
That would help ease my anxiety a LOT when managing my inventory.
---
Usually happens when there is a low level around. 
---
They were going to give free Christmas stuff but they cut it last minute.  Explains the logic of the holiday bundle and releasing Xmas stuff a day or so before becoming irrelevant.
---
Prime has tons of violet flux if you hit all the spawn points around it.
---
Plus you get a queen spawn.
---
No need to nuke areas where you get very few legendaries and no other rewards.
---
Icedtee84 on PC
---
crossbow has one. but I've yet to see one for Fat Man/Autogrenade/Missile Launcher/M79.  
---
Blackpowder guns also don't get Prime'd from what I've seen.
---
There is a helmet coming soon and Silver shroud outfit.  Copy pasted from fallout 4 and resold to us in the atom shop.  Pathetic.
---
They're not totally lost, they're still in your system capture gallery. Just no way to get them back into the game gallery. 
---
Better to keep hardened mass for stable flux combines imo.  
---
And i feel the remote nuke option whould be a time saver for some youtubers doing experiments with the nukes so they dont have to go through the silo and stuff and also i see that creative private servers could attract people with a creative personality leading them to possibly buy the game giving bethesda some money and everyone knows bethesda loves money making.
---
I assume it was the robot management that told they they had to leave :p
---
Human's lived for thousands of years without currency, and we were a hunter/gatherer society where everyone worked together for the greater good. We didn't evolve to magically have money and not want to help our fellow human out. You're just proving exacly how stupid you are.
---
Any update yet? I also got stuck at the "Select Motors Upgraded at the Scorched Detection Terminal" step.
---
Probably because it kept getting nuked. 
---
Same here. All my friends thought I was exaggerating the number of blue screens I got before this last patch, and now the tables have turned. 
---
When do i Stop cultivating mass and start harvesting ?
---
I get aids from fo76 sometimes....
---
Better to keep as hardened mass for stable flux combines imo
---
They all turned to Scorched, it's a virus that you find a cure for as the story progresses 
---
I like the yellow, I pretend I'm driving the loader from Aliens!
---
maybe\*SPOILER\* I thought enclave was defending scorchbeast agains every other fraction until modus get broken and wiped whole bunker.
---
What platform are you on?  I'm on ps4
---
Oh I only run 10+ Luck characters. ‚ÄúBetter to be lucky than skilled,‚Äù my dad always says. 
---
Dude idc about buffs or even helpfulness in combat. I jsut want a dog to follow me around the lonely wastesüòî
---
Full perked it will do less damage than what is shown unperked
---
Wallace just for the chit chat.  Camden Park has some surprisingly good stuff (Excavator mods, lever action plans)
---
Oh my god, how you can you still not getting it? There is 70years without fkin BoS history. Bethesda is game developer, they state what bos were doing. 
---
buff pistols.
---
Yeah, my expectation is to get more details about what they're doing at some point in Feb.
---
Fuck I‚Äôm on Xbox, thanks anyway
---
That's what I thought but when I listened to it again, the wording was vague.  And even if the booked guests were forced out by the robots, surely the staff would have been permitted to remain on site.  But then, as I said, the robots don't kick out visitors and even seem quite accommodating.
---
I'm sorry for your loss.
---
It's not the same, but I had to unexpectedly bury my father just a few months ago and have struggled with several hard moments in the game.
---
Anytime I drop their health a decent amount they fly the fuck away!!!!
---
On a serious note, I'm assuming there were people living there and something happened to them. IIRC, in an alley next to the Service Entrance, there's a ton of human bones lying around. It could've been previous inhabitants the robots eventually disposed off.
---
Sometimes when I‚Äôm chilling in rad zones I just contract stage 4 cancer
---
Yeah i only wear outfits because armor just looks stupid. If i can't paint it, why would i wanna just look at rust and shit.
---
But that would be discriminatory towards console players who don't have a keyboard... /Sarcasm
---
(1) fair enough.   
---
   
---
(2) its braindead easy buuuut the spike in difficulty would b pretty unfun imo, you go from slapping down things in 1 hit to...random hellzone where you need tons of radaway, rad x and disease cures, etc (lots of weight). I like the idea of very hard areas, but i think that should be saved for an upgraded version of a nuke, a special condition like multiple nukes on 1 spot or a dungeon. Not something you're sent to do at level 50ish.   
---
(3) congrats
---
Can you elaborate a bit more on the situation?
---
Trash dead game
---
Yeah, same. 
---
The timing on "when" that happened is pretty odd.  The last survivors we know of, like Abbie, didn't just suddenly turn into Scorched.  And places like Flatwood are littered with raider corpses, implying that there was a big firefight between the Responders and the Raiders fairly recently before the vault opened, as the level of decay isn't that high.  It's not like everybody turned into Scorched all at once.
---
  The amazing thing is that none of the buildings get damaged after repeated nukes.  
---
Low levels should at least just clear all the enemies around players who are actually doing damage to the queen.
---
So you want them to add a middle finger emote? Yeah, I'm cool with that.
---
Were you in a group with someone else at the time?
---
Right 
---
Boxing Matches could be a thing 
---
The robots did kick them out, as they were programmed to close the hotel for maintenance on a certain date for the Modern Heritage renovations. One man did eventually return and override the lockdown on the robots years later, but by that point everyone had moved on.
---
I think quests and plans should be more closely tied.  Like we could find a memo at graham mining that says something like a firefighters line for excavated where we go on a quest that leads us down a mine and find plans for the fire breathers variant excavator armor. 
---
The robots had orders to forcibly eject guests and staff on the refurbishment date. You‚Äôre not a guest or staff so you‚Äôre free to roam. 
---
If you want to know what happened to the guests and staff who resisted ejection go check out the dumpsters in the service areas. That is the programming the survivors tried to change but couldn‚Äôt. 
---
Fusion core workshops, claim them, power them, you'll have fusion cores in an hour or two that make you rethink your carry limits.  You're not supposed to find them in the wild, you're supposed to claim workshops.
---
There isn't a way to cheat a murder. There are several ways to get over powered damaged modifies with perk cards and aides... also depends on what exactly happened that killed you. What lead up to your death? 1 shot kill or prolonged damage?
---
I don't know about that.
---
Thinking may be time to update the subreddit rules to include screenshots/videos/proof of any said "news", exploits and etc. 
---
He thinks a level 52 should not have been able to kill him since he‚Äôs a higher level when in reality past 50 it‚Äôs all fair game everything is equal besides perhaps experience or grinding for weapons 
---
You will have zero issues with this request I promise you.  Go to fo76bazaar, or  market76 with this same post and I can all but guarantee you will find a friendly face willing to help.  Also for future reference anyways specify what platform you're on, you will get better responses.
---
Doesn't pacifist mode say right on the screen that people can still murder you
---
Huh, well these comments were unexpected
---
You can find recent players in social menu
---
No, haha.
---
Dude cancer is a real threat, be respectful üò°üò°üò°
---
  Decent!
---
Plant mutfruit, tato, and corn. Make vegetable starch then scrap. 
---
Huh?
---
I like the way it's portrayed in the poster for the quest. Or even a Fire Breather paint job would be cool 
---
I suspect they'll get there in the end with the balancing sure, but to be honest I don't think I'll be waiting around. Its been such a struggle enduring the server issues and bugs that I'm not willing to wait another month or two to sort it after this change kills it for me. 
---
I might be proven wrong, but I think by the time they have sorted it I'll be well over it and so will my friends that play.
---
It should never have launched with the balancing so far off that they need a 75% nerf. A lot of these weapon balance issues existed in FO4, they clearly performed next to no playtesting and just copy pasted everything over. 
---
What platform?  I have a 4 barreled TS. 
---
Oh PS4 
---
 You can tag resources so they show a magnifying glass on any lootable items that contain them.  
---
^This.
---
 If he one shot you and you weren't already near death, something's definitely suspicious. A prolonged assault is totally able to kill you though. 
---
I‚Äôll edit it
---
My girlfriend has collected all the Teddy Bears waiting for them to be displayed someday.
---
You can grow at it your camp. Mutfruit, Corn and Tato mixed with some purified water will give you vegetable starch, which can be broken down into 2 adhesives.
---
Which is named "known plans"
---
I‚Äôll be on in the morning around 8:00. I don‚Äôt use it much.  Has the 4 barrel and targeting computer mods.  Make an offer if you‚Äôre interested. 
---
Cheating like that is a big issue with this game. It's too risky to have third party programs when the chance of loosing all your progression would be high. Bugs on the other hand.. 
---
Thanks to you!
---
Kinda sucks that there are only like 5 places worth nuking. I've tried nuking other fissure sites and only got like 2-3 scorched beasts and that's it. 
---
Also if ANY part of excavator power armor is broke you‚Äôll lose the 100lb carry weight bonus. 
---
2k if it‚Äôs 1* 3k if it‚Äôs more then 1
---
it's easy to test.
---
Slap damage is capped at 5 damage. It can be less if your armor is higher than their damage output (punching with your bare fists against someone in power armor does 1 damage...) but regardless of perks/legendary effects/weapon, every shot I do against someone else does exactly 5 damage. Interestingly Grenades/Mines did \*zero\* (plasma grenade, frag mine)
---
The whole social menu is bugged for me
---
IKR. I don't have my camp near a water source, so I will go to one grab 200 dirty water then head back to my camp and spam click on the boiled water to make a bunch up to cook up soups and drinks, then store the rest for later. Same with doing lead runs. I will do multiple runs through the Charleston fire station, that no-tell motel north of flatwood, and VTU for lead. When I get to 1000, I will spam click on whichever ammo type I am building. In the last week or so, I keep getting booted to the home screen (xbox) when doing this. I do not dupe, don't know how to, and do not want to. Yet because I do things once every few days so I don't have to do it again for a while, it seems the system thinks that is what I am doing. 
---
1*. Works for me. 
---
What device you on?
---
This sounds a lot like Ahn'Qiraj from WoW and honestly it made the grind super fun. Gathering all the materials to get the gate to open and competing with other servers was awesome. Only problem I see is that in WoW you got to pick your server and stay with it for the entire duration of your character. We don't get that in FO76, but if we could get that..Holy shit I am down.
---
OP should be removed from game!
---
I saw someone test with stacked Bobbleheads and they still did slap damage.
---
Sorry but I am all about that river front living. 
---
I'm a solipsist, so I don't really see the point of this.
---
Nerf OP
---
&gt;If you're not into it, leave (the server).
---
Nope. Ever since the last patch if I need to server hop for whatever reason, I run the risk that my CAMP won't load on the next log in, which means I'll server hop again at which point I run a 70/30 risk of a disconnect or, sometimes a frozen screen, forcing me to do a hard shut down of the XB.
---
Why should I have to run the very real risk of doing a hard shutdown and restart of the entire console because someone doesn't have anything better to do, in the entire game, than attack my CAMP? 
---
This game still isn't stable enough to tell players who paid $60 for this game to log out if they don't like something, when server hopping is so fraught with stability issues.
---
Not sure why they down voted you. You're completely right. 
---
I still want it any way, lore friendly or not, but I completely agree with you why it likely currently isn't available
---
anti armor lever action, lvl 35, want?
---
Massive amounts of duping have been done on all platforms. 99.9% (made up figure, but probably close to accurate) of the tse that people are selling for a measly few thousand caps are definitely duped.
---
I would say watch how many you buy or just buy none at all. We had several people on my discord come forward this morning saying they were banned. They claimed they never duped but at least one of the guys definitely had multiple duped weapons that he traded for. So its possible they are going after people who just own them? I dont know. He had no reason to lie, he had already quit playing the game anyways, he just dropped by to let us know.
---
Wait now that you mention it, I do remember reading that was debunked...
---
Weird, so I guess OP really did just get careless/went AFK.
---
...and now I have to move my camp lol. It will never spawn again if people are poking around my cabin :p 
---
Also, the ring regenerates pretty quickly and there's almost always dog food and bobby pins in the kitchen. 
---
Not sure how to make that more clear. You had an opinion. You are not the only one with your opinion. Other people with your opinion are typically not as nice. Some with my opinion are not as nice, which is why you assumed my statement to be probably much harsher than it was.
---
The proper way to read my first comment is more with monotoned resignation and a partly defeated, "whatever" attitude with actual intended advice. Didn't mean to come across as snarky or anything.
---
Beth please add a Socratic self emote by which to respond to the erroneous youth of Aristotle emote givers.
---
Ok
---
Who find ebay? The dupers already have. I was curious one night from a post that people were paying like $50 for tse weapons. I didn't see that price listed, but quite a few listed on the $2 to $10 range. 
---
I gave up on FO76, the searching for Legendary Mobs is so annoying, Events have a idk 90 min. Timer, 
---
Sorry but all that Server hopping to find mobs to kill is just annoying. I mean, what else is there to do, shuttle new players, no thanks, picking flowers in nuke zones, have enough at the moment. Improve Gear, yes but lack of legendary mobs..
---
I have about 3 players on my friends list who are notorious dupers.  They have a few million in weight.
---
Have they been banned in the update? Nope.   It's always a friend of a friend who has been banned.  I'm yet to see actual evidence of banned players.    
---
You‚Äôre getting downvoted because you died when wanted. Doesn‚Äôt matter how you get wanted as soon as you get it, you should be ready to lose any junk not in your stash.
---
Maybe it would maybe it wouldn't. I'd like to actually be fully alert while playing the game. You know... sitting on the edge of my seat, focused on staying alive, having numerous close calls... that only comes with increased difficulty. If I'm slouched in a chair barely paying attention in the hardest zones in the game then personally I think that's a bad design choice... 
---
And point of #3 isn't to gloat, i think, it's to say "hey, this game gets ridiculously easy, even if you just run around in your underwear you can easily solo the supposedly apex-predators of this world." To me that seems wrong and kinda stupid.
---
I am not into super difficulty where it's like death after death after death so much that you shut the thing off and never come back. But some kind of threat or stressor would be nice. A bit of fear. A bit of panic. It's sorely lacking
---
Can't they just use a mic, or are we putting Descartes before the hoarse?
---
Full perk reset but it costs 1000 caps because i think now the perk system is bad because if i want one new perk i need to get two levels that i can make some space and then put it on... 
---
A no mic symbol would likely have to be enabled in game settings like pacifist mode. 
---
Sorry to come to old thread. I‚Äôm new to reddit and really need the core assembly and calibrated shocks. Already have the armor level 50  how much for you to modify my armor or build legs and torso with those mods
---
This would be awesome.  Many times I've paid to fast travel and the event would be over by the time I load in.  Very frustrating.
---
in the launcher under account settings. 
---
There is a spot in the Savage Divide that overlooks a Highway and flag. It is above the highway and against the cliff with a large pond. I can't remember the exact location I just recall what a good base it would have made.

---
I heard you can fix the glitch by selling something to a vendor. Not sure though
---
Not again
---
Could be that OP had taken a workshop. If the other player contested it then OP would be in pvp regardless of pacifist mode.
---
Perk respect option would be nice. No perk limit not so much. It would be nice to see more viable build options than sneak vats crit builds though. Same goes for melee, your either low health build or 2 handed power armor. Options dry up quick. 
---
Totally... who comes up with this shit? I mean it seems like one of the most obvious things the game needed to include and it's not there.
---
Yeah and make it cost the same amount of cash as a microphone 
---
I got my first explosive weapon as well, just last night. A nocturnal explosive black powder rifle. The damage is exquisite, but the accuracy is shit. Oh well, better than nothing.
---
He wasn't cheating, you just suck! :D
---
I am getting that a lot more now than before the update on ps4 also.  Its super frustrating for it just to work for only 15 seconds and then just hang there.
---
That too.
---
Thats currently my biggest concern. But Im sure those other peeps get along fine, shouldnt be too too rough.
---
If realistic ballistics were in the game:
---
Anyone who shot a fatman would die from the blast. It simply doesn‚Äôt lob them far enough
---
The hardened 308 sniper rifle would be woefully outclassed by its 50 cal version. 
---
Very little would be able to withstand the hit of a 50 bullet and the M2 would be essentially unable to be wielded without PA because of the recoil.
---
Line of sight shots would miss at longer ranges as the bullet drops, and damage would decrease. 
---
The damage from 40mm would be an almost instant death for any humanoid creatures within its AoE.  Same for most grenades. 
---
I believe the Enclave had control of the whitespring.
---
I have been wearing a wedding ring I got from a corpse in the mountains for ages, I finally went and got one off a different corpse for my husband üòÇüòÇüòÇ

I‚Äôll give it a try thanks üëç
---
I still have no idea what you just said...
---
Can you wear any hat/helmet with this mask? I have it and it fits my camo themed build perfectly but it seems to mean I am unable to wear my combat helmet. 
---
I do them every day, its 10minutes - 1hour of time daily. If i play every day for hour i can do even weekly challenges and get around 700 atoms per week. I am sitting on 2k atoms and waiting for something ultra dope, and when i get over for something that is interesting, i just buy it. Should count it together, i belive i had over 8k atoms by playing from beta to now (350hours)
---
My butt hurt.
---
Lol and here I am living out of a box car
---
Look at your tiny little hands, aaaaawwwww üòç
---
You can also just invest in growing mutfruit if budget is tight, and swing by The General's Steak House (North in the Bog) now and again.  Out back there are 9 each (I think) tato, corn, and carrot (all you need for veg soup).  With Green Thumb and 9 mutfruits at your CAMP, that's 18 adhesive per trip.
---
With the legendary ghouls I have noticed that it sometimes takes a few seconds for the legendary loot to load in.  Leave its inventory and wait a bit,  Longest I have seen is a delay of 5 \~ 10 seconds.
---
I loot fast; milliseconds after killing, so it is super frustrating to lose the streak-zone by waiting for a legendary item to spawn.
---
I have also learnt not to bother running after the retreating Super Mutants.  Life\`s too short.
---
Well technicaly u get around 700atoms per week, if you play and do some challenges, so there is "free item". I dont want some free shit, then everyone have it and it is not special for me. I hate skins for buing game. Why would i want costume everybody have? Cmon i am better than others lol. (only gypsies and judes want free items #noracism)
---
Check the terminal in the managers office. The survivors did stay there at first, but the boots got a software upgrade before the war that the survivors couldn't undo. So new years day after the bombs fell, the bots would classify the survivors as vagrants and "remove" them.
---
You on rn?

I believe I was on the same server. Did he come up to you and goad you into fighting at all with a Tesla rifle? If so he had a couple of buddies perched up around him sniping, they tried to get me this way. It was also at the resort.
---
Strong points. I have no meaningful arguments about the stability issues.
---
But we're not talking about those. Don't log out. Refer to bullet point five above. Watch it burn. It feels good.
---
You shouldn't log out. You should live in a world where your work can be taken away from you all of a sudden.
---
Bullet point one is basically a way of telling people to go play hello kitty island adventure. I thought everyone was clear on that.

Level 101 here, shotgun-rifle main and secondary melee-rifle build. Playing exclusively in pacifist mode, all my friends lost interest in the game so I'm mainly playing alone now.

PS: I'm just about as unlucky as one can get with RNG, didn't have a single good legendary drop. Still using my Executioner's combat shotgun level 40 that I've picked up from a vendor :(. Would love to spend some caps on a good legendary.
---
I'll take it for 1000 caps
---
God I hope they add these back in. Would be very fun
---
Funny you bring that up. I found the bear rug plan yesterday. I have no idea where I found it. I think it was fairly random.
---
Tons of black titanium and gears though. 
---
Holy shit this is amazing! I can't believe how long it is. Props to you fellow wastelander 
---
Or throw on armor that let's you carry infinite weapons/chems/junk/food/ammo....
---
The Fallen Elder! I love this.  From one nerd to another, I dig it!
---
They should take some notes from r/outside

BlazeComedy
---
I would settle for a "Please do not shit on the floor" emote.
---
I picked up a frame with blue T-60 parts there just now and it made my excavator set blue when I put it on the power armor workbench there.
---
Itll be added after they have patched all the dupe exploits, adding it before they do that only makes it easier for the dupers to do their thing, they wouldn't need anyone else if they could just rejoin their own server that easy.
---
Sure its not much of a limitation but right now its one they can easily track, seeing someone in the logs rejoin the same server over and over for hours on end with the same person in their group makes for some really easy to pinpoint data.
---
The skull one makes my character look like she's wearing a hijab. Nothing wrong with that but in my camo themed fatigues, combat armour and scout armour it just looks wrong.
---
In power armour with no helmet, especially Ultracite, you look like a Chaplain. 
---
Beth will see this one and listen to you all, but none of the people asking legitimately for this kind of thing. Then we‚Äôll all have a laugh and assume the Thinker pose for the rest of time
---
I am at the watoga station 
---
What‚Äôs nuka grape?!
---
You don't understand what this data is.
---
I'm not sure who their target audience was for this Atom Store promotion, but I think they completely missed the mark with this one.  I haven't seen anyone sporting the power armor paints or other related items.
---
When I first saw this, I thought this was a tie-in with the [Child's Play Charity](https://www.childsplaycharity.org) which would've been awesome if Bethesda were to donate a portion of those proceeds to charity.  The theme would make much more sense in that case, and you could wear the paint to show you donated to a worthy cause.  But as far as I can tell this is not the case.
---
Did Bethesda sent you a job invitation yet?
---
Yeah it's actually a lot funner when it's like this. There were several mods for Fallout 4 where it like you could take only a few bullets, HP scaling was removed, HP from endurance nerfed... max HP for humans was 80-100... Damage perks were severely nerfed. Damage from mods removed. Damage was based on caliber and not on class. Headshots almost always instakill. Combined with some other mods like adding thousands of feral ghouls  and deadly rad storms it actually made the game quite fun. I liked it a lot more than the bullet sponge god mode ending that the vanilla game provided.
---
That must have been changed then because I‚Äôve been inside AVR when Charleston was hit and the Scorched inside were max level. No rads taken and no special items dropped, but they were high level as opposed to their normal 1-10.  
---
Also a "I'm not really a girl, so please stop sending me heart emotes, kid" emote would be great!
---
I like my special place where they are on a table.  It's where I can farm, screw farm, and cry.
---
I honestly forget that the franchise has been solely single player sometimes too. It‚Äôs been so great interacting with other players. I truly love it. 
---
I have some socks under my bed. I'll trade you bulk amounts.
---
Level is meaningless after a certain point.
---
***Grab my strong hand.***
---
There's one workshop where the first defense mission is against 1 scorchbeast. I noped out of there quick. You can have it.
---
No
---
Absolutely agree. 95, to me, is more symbolic of just being hardcore or challenging. 
---
ah the good ol Spray n Pray
---
Which time zone you in? I wanna check your camp out but i‚Äôm usually offline when you guys are online. :D

you got that chernobyl strain?

This actually helps bounty hunters hunt you and survivors to know what to expect, so thank you.

(This is also why I never attack anyone with a bounty or chase bounties)

Now tell me ur super great idea for vault 76

I'm sure the scammers are doing everything they can to get people to stop looking.
---
Oh yeah all unarmed weps should be on both hands, OOOOOh my i want two mole-miner fists.
---
If you have a high luck, the drill has a high max cond, which means it does more damage.
---
Once you overheal it, it becomes a good weapon.
---
Keep an eye on the trashcan next to the stash box in the Flatwoods Red Rocket. A lot of people dump loot in there for free.
---
Only what's up top...
---
I just placed my CAMP on the outskirts of Harpers Ferry. After hearing this... I think I'm gonna retreat back to the Forest, where it's safe.
---
But!! This is good advice, and once I progress more, I will use HF to my advantage.
---
One thing I miss from NV was that whoever made the guns actually understood a little bit about them and tried to work that in, hence the wide variety of ammunition types and their varying effects. Want a rifle with armor piercing capability?  You need AP ammo. Want increased damage against soft targets?  JHPs. 
---
Having different types of grenade launcher ammo was nice too. Pulse against bots, HE against everything else. 
---
I typically just give the finger guns for this feeling.
---
Solution: an emote that changes the character mesh to the VTU statue and plays Floral Shoppe by Macintosh Plus for a few seconds

RIP your ammo. It deserved so much more than this. 
---
I'm not a huge fan of online games, but am a huge fan of Fallout.  I just play it solo and have enjoyed the story and sidequests.  I've only run into 2 jerks trying to kill me or my modest camp.  It doesn't have the depth of story like 3,NV,4, but it's still a story any Fallout fan will appreciate.  I'm level 62 and only have the final story quest to do, I doubt I'll keep playing once I complete it until more content is released.  
---
If you already have the game and love Fallout, it's worth playing through the story at the very least.  Look up a guide with a list of all the side/event stuff and check them off as you go.  
---
You can swap out parts on her to make her full assaultron again.
---
I live on the ash heap. Never had an issue with spawning on someone elses camp location.
---
Join the dark side?  
---
I haven't yet, but then again I build open bases and generally play solo.
---
Nope. They‚Äôre all equally buggy and tedious. 
---
I had the same problem but eventually it gave me an option.
---
Yesterday i was scraping shit i got from Scorchbeast queens(after you kill them server is laggy nightmare), and when i was scraping, items moved and i scraped mine shielded raider underamor. Of course i fucking bought it, cause i dont know where to get plan and it happened second time! 
---
I was like you, "Noobs learn hard way", but this one is actualy issue. We shouldn't be able to scrap atleast item we are wearing right now.
---
Yeah that is sorely lacking. Was in Far Cry 5, too. Pulse grenade launcher? Sounds amazing. 
---
Oh of course. I do my share of bounty hunting myself when I'm not on the other end so if this helps against Raiders too, all the better.
---
Yeah exactly, what are they gonna do just keep nerfing all the equipment until everything sucks? I don't know... Like there is this whole hating on the elitists part of the community in this game. Which confuses me because you don't have to deal with the elitists if you don't want too, just turn on pacifist, never take a workshop. Easy. If you are doing that and complaining you are just complaining about how other people are playing the game which you have no right to do.
---
If there is anything to take away from this experience it would be to use the perks super duper and chemist to make the aid cream for use in the silos
---
Sorry, but laughed at that so hard my cat gave me a look... 
---
Nah there was an actual video in the topic.
---
And I am sorry for yours. 
---
Losing someone isn't easy. No matter who it is. Doesn't make yours better or worse. Or mine. I sincerely hope you are able to find closure soon, as no one should suffer that pain.
---
Bethesda is a lot of things. But they are masterful at tugging our heartstrings...
---
the loot in fo76 is astrocious. maybe the worst ever since diii vanilla.
---
I think (this is a lot of speculation) that OR is Major Ragnarsdottir. The lockdown was ended by sending the Liberators in to force the facility to think it was under attack. It was part of the plan by the existing Enclave.
---
Those hunter/gather societies that you speak of had people that would just kill anyone that had something they wanted without repercussions, unless a friend or family member/tribe decided to seek revenge. Your point has no merit in today's world. 
---
Youre the only ash heaper I've met.  Your neighborhood yard sale page must suck
---
Weebs belong in camps. 
---
I agree with this
---
There's also one in the main raider quest in Huntersville. If your Perception is high enough, the game tells you the raider's dead body is rigged to explode, which gives you more time before it goes off.
---
weird flex, but okay
---
You can have up to 8ppl on PS4 party. And events all for whole server so....  Only problem is pvp, becouse nobody will ever mark 2different parties. 
---
Right. Zero threat. Hell even zero target focus. Can mindlessly mash attack and win no problem against the entire golf club in a hazmat.
---
&gt; told
---
That's a funny way to say, "opened fire on anyone who got too close" :P
---
I guess for Helloween outfit one should do some quest given in that pumpkin place on the way to Mire?
---
Great to make space on server while fighting scorchbeast queen, to let your friends on full server.
---
That‚Äôs just it, it wasn‚Äôt a pulse grenade launcher. It was a regular one that used pulse grenades. Not up against bots anymore?  Simply press the up button to change ammo type (and reload the gun).  It had .223/5.56 and .38/.357 with their slight differences in effectiveness and effect on condition. 
---
I think the reason they didn‚Äôt do it in FO4 or this title was to reduce complexity. There‚Äôs an absolutely enormous amount of ammo types in the real world and for people who‚Äôs only gun knowledge comes from games/tv/movies trying to navigate that could be a turn off. Simply having an AP magazine mod is easier for most to understand.   
---
I believe I got that plan multiple times from claiming/defending the Gorge Junkyard workshop.  There are so many plans you can easily get just by claiming workshops and defending.
---
We don‚Äôt PvP so it rarely comes up.  But if they are engaged in PvP they ain‚Äôt Pacifist so getting hit will suffice.
---
You can hunt for cryptids, find and kill a behemoth, you can search for dead vault dwellers (I found one impaled on a spear and piled into a hole in the ground as well as stuffed into a locker), there's lots of cool lore bits around that you won't find unless you go off the beaten path, I know theres more I could suggest but I can't think of anything atm because it's so late. 
---
It's not impossible. It's just really hard.
---
If it's due to the ammo bug, put all but a couple ammo in your cache.  Then equip and load the weapon and fire it and it should fix it.  Has fixed it permanently for me.  
---
200 base value as I remember. Then it depends on CHA/perks.

What percentage of TSEs were either duped or bought from someone who duped them?
---
I‚Äôd definitely want to know the answer about bonus damage from prime receivers to better judge whether it‚Äôs worth the extra effort. 
---
Damn autocorrect. :)
---
I like the idea, I just think it's bad design to throw in a random punishing area in the middle of a very easy adventure that does nothing to prep you for such
---
Another day I was trading with a Player and noticed six Halloween outfits in the inventory. Now I know why is that.
---
I gave up and just went onto a different server

OP, you are my personal hero!

I really needed to turn off that Dof 
---
1. PlayStation 4 Pro
---
2. Stoneyzatiger
---
3. Plenty of videos and screenshots sent.    ...DAILY
---
4. err..   I don't know where to start.  The transfer counter slider going round in circles? the freezes during blast zone battles, lag in PVP, the broken quests, invincible enemies,(Event quests don't even register anymore). Where did those unruly golfers quest go?  The quest has disappeared from my list, and NOW those golfer ghouls are everywhere! Its fun in teams doing the Scorchbeast Queen and other high level battles, but I have been disconnected more times than I have seen the loot. I load in quite a lot and die immediately from some mob that's been hacking at me during loading.(Having to repair power armor every time is expensive). 
---
5. Why the hell has the game price not come down by much?  I really want another copy for my cousin to do more co-op stuff...  STILL over $60
---
How much longer do we have to wait till we get the actual finished game? I know this rant isn't helpful and I am sorry, but I love the game ...\[sigh\] Its all just too tiring. 
---
Ooooh that‚Äôs ... not nice... for what 10 caps? Hardly worth the ammo, is it?
---
No, the main difference is Charlie has ghouls outside. I run Charlie just for the extra xp at first. 
---
If it's not ten-fold, then how can it easily destroy the wasteland? I use normal heavy guns with all their perks and don't come close to destroying the wasteland.
---
It's absolutely a bug. There is no way this system worked as intended at launch, we'll have to wait 4 more months or until the fanbase has another panic attack to see what the finished product was supposed to look like.
---
Ok thanks for the tip. I would like to suggest a buff to the laser weapons. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm one of a thousand to ask for that but it can‚Äôt hurt to lend support to the cause. 
---
Oh hell yes. Please.
---
I needed the lead, and I have no issues taking blocks usually...at least in a house I can pretend they all got to a vault, but this? This was too much. Even though I needed the scrap, I left everything 
---
Isn't griefing, at the very least, attacking someone on a personal level? You just threw a very passive aggressive attack at this person by implying he or she has never read a book before, based off of a cursory understanding of his or her perspective, gathered by a line written in an obscure subreddit.
---
Perhaps you should read either more, or the correct books, sir or madam.

Interesting, i had Mr. messenger run to nuke zone (for some reason radiation damage is killing him), on his way he died every few sec, then regen hp and then died again. It was anoying but i finished this event. Didn't know he can completly die.
---
If I could unload my 10mm ammo on you through Reddit, I would. I'm swimming in the stuff and I'm too much of a packrat to just ditch it. v.v
---
I don't think it's about the caps, it's about the potential for grief 
---
can I trade of one of the plans if you have any spare ones?
---
Miss my free noms, tbh.
---
Id like to disassemble ammo like in New Vegas, the best fallout game.
---
Hear me out...okay...
---
So a vault...and it's filled with emotes...
---
Really what we need is a ‚Äúthat‚Äôs Kafkaesque‚Äù emote. 
---
Most, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you should punish the people who have them.  When I bought my first TSE I was unaware of just how prolific the duping was, and that in all likelihood was buying a duped gun.  Later I made a deal on a handmade. Guy was too lazy to have his mule hold them for him. Over 50k in his inventory. 
---
That said, I‚Äôve compared TSEs to nukes before and I think it‚Äôs an apt comparison. Most aren‚Äôt going to relinquish them as long as they exist in the game. Powerful weapons like TSEs need to exist if SBQ isn‚Äôt going to be nerfed.  After they come for the TSEs, then they‚Äôll come for the bloodied guns run by the glass cannons.  It‚Äôll never end. 
---
Yep
---
Uh what? They retconned the lore so every game previous to 76 doesn't make sense. If that's not shitting on the lore, then I don't know what is.

Had one where I was up north with no locations around, after him falling off a cliff, getting stuck on said cliff wall, we encountered a scorchbeast at the recreation battle with the north and south, he finally gets to where he's going and the scorchbeast murders him over and over while he tries to get to the door. Didn't hear what he was saying and then another scorchbeast pops up. Needless to say a ten minute endeavor turned into a twenty minute firefight.

&gt; Because players come into Events at various stages in time, another thing we‚Äôre talking about is how to provide you with a greater sense of the Event‚Äôs current status. We know it can be disheartening to spend your hard-earned Caps travelling to a location ‚Äì only to discover upon arrival that the Event has already concluded. We‚Äôre still working through this to come up with a resolution.

And they dupe emotes.

I want a ‚ÄúGet off my lawn!‚Äù emote.

Well today I spent a few hours walking around collecting materials for a new X-01. I just made a new base and Excavator PA. So I pretty much need everything haha.

I enjoyed my time. Did some events along the way. Made a buddy and we did a few of his missions.
---
Got the Torso, Left Arm and Helmet made.

Next I plan to craft a bunch of Submachine guns so I can break them down to unlock all the mods. 
---
I may be able to help you out, psn?
---
Im sorry you feel that way 
---
I'm sorry I did get that it was pulse grenades as an ammo type. I should have gone back and edited my post... thought about it...
---
And yeah the complexity would be weird albeit in Far Cry all you had to do was hover the weapon in the wheel and press Triangle to cycle the different ammo types.
---
Canned Meat Stew*

&gt;every game previous to 76 doesn't make sense.

That is not true, as i told already, there is not writen single second for about 70years, when BoS is in their bunker (i dont know name sorry). Now we get information, that they were operating thru radio (their bunker had huge satelite). Here in appalachia they were trying to destroy scorched, bcos you know BoS hate mutants, but they failed and get wiped. Which game is next? I dont know exact years but, we have 100?? year until another game comes in.    I know i am not exactly correct, but there is logical lore, bethesda done it well. But there will always be fuckers, that will blame before even finding what true is.
---
Glad to help!
---
Do they stack? 
---
I wear sleek armor and use the sneak card. I can usually get 4 melee sneak attacks off on a grounded Scorchbeast before I go from Caution to Danger. Sometimes they die before that. 
---
What is that paint on the left in the last pic, and where can I get it?
---
And the reward for getting through it is a .5% chance to get a "dupe this for me!" emote
---
Well. Power Armor prepares you for an existential threat that never truly manifests itself so there's that. Instead it just gives you a quasi-god mode that trivializes all aspects of the game. 
---
And it's not really a random punishing area in the middle. It's the final thing of the main questline. Arguably the end of the game in its current state.
---
Thanks for downvotes, we have playstation4 chat, Pc have discord, xbox have the best player interference? I am not serious tho, if they waste time doing some text chat, i am ok with that.

Have you tried scrapping them?

For sure, crafting ultracite ammo is no joke takes a ton of stuff. I'm considering switching to prime after the TSE nerf because ranged may be too weak to kill the queen effectively after.
---

---
Waved at you üòÄ i will be installing text chat tomorrow. Maybe then i would have better means of communicating with others in game.
---
I believe once someone picks the supply it becomes their loot. I've had drops taken from me. Must be some sort of shared loot table because I've had people leave pre war cash. 
---
I've had 2 spawn at philippi battle cemetery, try there
---
Have you tested this or just read about it?
---
Flamer ammo usage makes it impossible to use in general
---
Omg yes. I would absolutely be down with that. One of the many Best parts of fallout 2 was getting a boxing name and becoming the champ only to find that your opponent used lead lined.boxing gloves. God that game is top notch. 
---
I gotta agree a lot of these suggestions/requests of folks are a bit inane but especially the emotes.  They could solve all their emote wants by picking up a mic or headset.  The game has built-in voice that works pretty great in my experience.
---
And a chrome minigun!! Now we're talking WAR MACHINE!!
---
If I'm not mistaken, It's Hotrod paint, you can buy it in atomic shop only.
---
We are doing 3nukes on same server everytime. One time this week happened, that we had 2scorchbeast queen corpses close to each other. So they sometimes stay for 20minutes. Sometimes they disapear in 1min.
---
I hope you were here for the "Eat a fat man you level 1xx griefing dick" post that got 5000+ points and a bunch of gold/silver etc
---
They are aid items, not scrappable. We figured it out over the few day: the players in the event get Corpse Seeds (worthless) and sometimes it gives the rest of the players on the serve 3-8 Corpse Flower Stamen (used for crafting Super Stim Packs). I was on a team but didn't join the event (or left the team) and I get Corpse Flower Stamen about 50% of the time.

Cool story bro

wow I've never noticed that, is it really mispelled like that?
---
Those are actually the two I'm trying to do the most but I can never get the cryptid one to trigger even when I go to the shack, and the Camden one just seems to trigger randomly.
---
Mysteries IS a cool quest line if you listen to all the tales and terminals 
---
Bethesda should remove all weapons from the game. Even cut off your fists, because you are doing too much damage against someone who didn't built for melee unarmed.  
---
Then get rid of everything else, since there will always be something that is stronger and better at something.   
---
And we clearly can't have that.
---
Isnt metal best option for balistic damage which is like 80% of game?
---
I don‚Äôt mind most, but using up violet is annoying since my two heaviest use guns require it (5.56 and .50). 
---
Usually wolves or ferals, the wolves are good eating. Turrets with spotlights handle most of them. Here's a [video](https://youtu.be/i2u2NsWEuEk) of my CAMP, discussing the pros &amp; cons of Solomon's Pond as a site, if you're curious. (From the number of times the server can't place my CAMP when logging on, I gather it's becoming more &amp; more popular.)
---
it because its unequipping your armor and underarmor with +str

You could also be lucky like me and never have the event spawn at all so you can't even try it.

I‚Äôm on the PS4 and would like to buy the mod for X01. But no one seems to sell it. One guy said he‚Äôll take 2500.
---
What‚Äôs this about a nerf?
---
I still say they just parody the game and make enemy water purifiers that fire two shot explosive guns at you while running through the air calling you maam and talking about their soothing voice while duping themselves so they keep multiplying. this should be the final endgame boss.
---
On PC I‚Äôm sure that would be neat. On consoles it sounds like a hassle to try to type stuff into it. 
---
How are they nerfing it?
---
The dont heal enemies and havnt for a month now. I think dec 11 patch fixed it. And tse ruin the game. Everything shouldnt die in one hit. So I understand that nerf.  Energy weps are still broke tho. Havnt even touched them yet myself. 
---
Are you the Lorax now? Speaking for the trees?
---
Not my experience unfortunately. The only friendly player I‚Äôve met was a young child screaming incoherently into the mic. 
---
Other than that I‚Äôve been shot at by at least 3 players, and ignored by everyone else. 
---
Last night a lvl60 in a creepy clown costume chased me around the woods with an axe, doing considerable slap damage (5-10% per hit). 
---
Happened to me but with ghouls -&gt; scorched. Now my friends think i am dumbass and whitespring is only worth.
---
Same. I finally got my first two shot in the form of a fat man. Time to find the experimental mirv mod now and kill everyone‚Äôs frames
---
ashdeezy, I've just made, and I'm uploading, a video of a triple artillery strike on the Whitespring Laundry ‚Äî not in a blast zone at the time, so with only regular ghouls, not the glowies, but still entertaining if you like things going boom. When the YouTube upload is done, it should be viewable at [this link](https://youtu.be/qDohBSO79qs).
---
Love this post, as a competitive player myself wish more people were into PvP
---
My buddy was hidden inside a hostile mob last night.
---
Agreed. If you favorite üñ§ something it should lock it from being scrapped or sold. 
---
u can have usefull guard in this game but buggy as hell. i just tame a lvl 50 deahtcalw few weeks ago, sent to camp arrived as one star legendary lvl21 deathcaw, after few days chacged to two star legendary deathcaw. acutaly way more effective that turrets. btw ist pretty good to troll peoples. just place base to frequent place. they will shoot it and turned to wanted asap. if ur no pvp mode the lapdog will not get damage and u friend can kill them.

I have a feeling not everything here is on the level.
---
There are many worried players hoping that "It is impossible for the game developer to know what is in your inventory, but the game somehow can show that you have 5 million Broken doll legs." hypothesis is true. 
---
They can know. They have all the data. They can scan it at their leisure.
---
According to [Rifle](https://youtu.be/z_rI3YyqtA4) nuking  Monongah is pretty good. I want to try that place some time.
---
Do you not have phones? Cause I've got like 12, idk what's up with you people and your stupid "yeah I have a singular phone, wtf's wrong with you needing more than one"
---
It's odd to find history of the brotherhood, enclave etc. I feel there would be more if them around now. I feel I've only scraped the surface of all the lore too.
---
Work shitty you mean.
---
Sounds like he was a much lower lever and the broken PvP fucked you. 
---
They are randomly locked whether you requested them or not, but the ones you didn't request that will give you a wanted level have a "steal from" prompt in front of the lock level info. So you can tell easily if it's yours or not.
---
Also the world has random encounters with dropped crates surrounded by robot guards. Those are locked also, but are free for anyone to grab. No "steal from" prompt on them.
---
Maybe they don‚Äôt want to use their mic?
---
1. Makes me walk really slow too.
---
Honestly, I bought it off of someone. I have no idea where they are, nor have I ever seen them at a vendor. If you find out, let me know.
---
i get so much adhesive just from free roaming..i end up selling it
---
Wait a little longer. Soon Bethesda will be paying you for playing the game.
---
Only if the locked prompt says "steal from" before the lock level info. Otherwise it's either your crate or it's a random encounter crate. Any crate comes with a lock chance.
---
I made[ a post on this topic this morning](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ai1lhv/suggestion_since_bethesda_doesnt_seem_interested/) that didn't get a lot of traction, but I stand by what I said there: 
---
In my experience, the excavator armor seems to be the most popular armor in the game, for obvious reasons. About 60% of the people I see wearing power armor wear it, and I know that I wear it pretty much exclusively. It's the signature armor of this game, both for its novelty and utility.
---
And yet! We've seen one paint job after another in the Atomic Shop which applies to virtually every armor aside from the excavator (and the ultracite armor, but let's take it as read that everything I say about one applies to both, going forward). For whatever reason, Bethesda does not seem to want the money they could be earning from most of their players who use power armor and who would like to spruce up their excavator.
---
But what about this: Let's say I buy the Vault-Tec Paints skins from the Atomic Shop. It provides alternate skins for four different types of armors, right? Let's say, then, that I own this and an excavator armor, and I go to my power armor workbench, and go to the paints tab, and I see "T-41 Vault-Tec," "T-51 Vaul-Tec," etc. And when I apply one of these, my excavator cosmetically changes into that appearance. No stat changes; it still functions like an excavator in every sense, but it LOOKS different. We as players get more toys to play with, Bethesda gets players with more incentive to buy those paint jobs... everyone wins.
---
And it seems to me that the same principle could apply more broadly. Look at those paint jobs that apply only to metal or leather armour. They look nice, but metal and leather armour are early-game sets that you'll quickly discard once you get to level 30 or so, right? What if we could change our trapper or marine armours to LOOK like those re-painted sets? Again, suddenly those skins become more valuable to players and thus, financially, to Bethesda as well.
---
I really can't see a downside here. If I see a level 200 player trucking around in what looks like a T-51 armor, it's not going to change my behaviour towards him relative to what I would do if I saw him in an excavator armor, so I can't even see it impacting PvP or "game balance."
---
It's also in newest patch
---
I tried but i have this weird bug that greys out the 45 option even though i have the materials.
---
Also, wearing Underarmour and equpping PA will lower the DR of the PA, try it.
---
I love this idea. You might pair the bonus production with more frequent / dangerous attacks. 
---
Roleplay as scp-049?
---
Green eyes = scorched (strongest one)?
---
Red eyes = agresive
---
Purple eyes = friendly
---
OR they could add holotapes with programs that can upgrade your terminal with more features.
---
We'd get our asses kicked tho.
---
I am 109, they were a 35 and a 77. I didn't know levels played a huge part in that. Though it makes sense because when I was shooting the health bar was like 100%-10% oops back up to 80%, then 20%, then back up to 70%...
---
Fallout 2 begs to differ.

I have mic, but it didn't work for so long during beta that I rarely use it now.
---
I like to do the daily &amp; weekly challenges while waiting for SBQ events. 
---
I die a lot to exploding cars &amp; robots.
---
Ayyy PvP is fun, see?
---
I don't see what's wrong with returning fire with what you've got when someone *shoots a goddamn missile at your house* but apparently this sub sees PvP as abhorrent.
---
and: the tamed creatures wandering around about 8-10m range of ur camp tool. so u need move the camp tool far from ur base or it will glich into ur base how u see on the linked picture. btw never stuck because if stucked they teleport into a free space around ur base.
---
\+ for a deathclaw u need have 2-3 small turret because they cant hit small enemies like busg a rats.
---
Thanks! I've been playing with some layouts. I was going for a hilltop retro modern motel but I don't think we have the correct pieces for how envisioned it! 
---
If you do the thumbs up while walking, it indeed does a sorta wave movement with the hand that could correspond.
---
Bwahaha!  That‚Äôs exactly right.  The amount of times I‚Äôve searched around the brush for a piece, a head, anything... to get... a plastic fork.  It stings a bit less of they‚Äôre dead and pillaged before they hit the ground.  That fork, becomes a trophy. 
---
Wait... are you saying that I can learn mods that I don't know/have by scrapping weapons that I created that do not have those mods?
---
It's odd isn't it? Take your losses, gather your resources, sort it out, then go kill the guy that killed you.
---
It's obvious, isn't it?
---
Ohhhh Catherine Zeta Jones. You are wile. 
---
I've also noticed that I've started to walk and even sprint extremely slow at times. I have to get out of my power armor to fix it, it's always fun when it's right in the middle of a scorchbeast fight.
---
There‚Äôs a nice pond just south-west of the cranberry forest near fissure prime.

They suddenly start spending extra hours at work, dress more carefully, start going to the gym, wearing perfume, never leave their cell unattended.
---
I'll see what I can do!
---
I had one in the mire that spawned what I thought was three high level fog crawlers (but was really five) and ended at a house that was a level 68 super mutant nest with a hermit crab at their doorstep. I was level 65 at the time, so I was really hoping for a better payout than I got, but it was a fierce, or rather series of fierce battles. 
---
That was a bold statement...
---
Lol. I have also had no problems with people attacking my shitty camp either.
---
If you ever see someone in the forest or elsewhere with a gas mask it is because I have forgotten to take it off after being outside at my camp.
---
I would do a second character to get them but then how do I transfer them to my primary? I don't have any friends that play to transfer the plans through. All my friends are on PS4 and I'm on PC.
---
KILL IT WITH FIRE.
---
This is one of the most stylish, clever builds I've seen so far. I'd be delighted to happen upon it out and about on my adventures. It cries out for a group of ten players hanging out and making use of the stools and tables. 
---
Oh this happens when I'm not in PA. Altho it has when I am. Exiting worked, but I'm usually not in it when it happens. RIP
---
No i am human!... beep boop
---
Are you using any mods?
---
May make a good boss clearing weapon if you save up for special occasions.
---
Have you tried moving your camp in the same area?  It's worth a shot if you haven't.
---
Who's Lemmie ?
---
I really wish the Pip-Boy offered more of a carry weight analysis.  Even if high level.  Would really help me keep better tabs on where I‚Äôm bloating from day to day.  Weapons, Apparel, Aid, Junk, etc...
---
Reminds me, can we also get ammo inventory to show in the Tinkers station ammo crafting screens?
---
Thankfully it hasn't happened to me when I'm out if PA, I hope the issue is resolved soon.
---
yes some type of in game chat would be awesome so people could set up trading posts or relay messages on the radio 
---
The altitude might be a thing. I was able to reach HUntersville from atop the cliffs to the west. That's a pretty far shot compared to others.
---
When trying to fire at Whitesprings, I get the message "not available" instead of "not in range". Weird.
---
I agree mostly due to the rules of it and the lack of balance, most ppl who wanna fight will wreck you and the other 22 players on the map wo t fight you.. I'm ready for the new pvp mode bit I play fair and usually stay salt free lol
---
Its not
---
Well they wont spawn after like level 25 or so
---
Well it's a good thing it doesn't work that way at all. For real, do some basic research before posting stuff like this. 
---
It gets set to  if you have less than 11.
---
Underrated comment. 
---
just clean PA hud, showhealth, and uhd map
---
yeah, nope as the floors are still missing
---
excavator armor is the tutorial armor they have you craft before they allow you to craft power armor stations. not really designed to be a long term option, when you can put calibrated shocks on other things for the +100 carry weight and have better defense
---
That just looks like a FOV bug. I can replicate it by changing the FOV to a really high value in the custom ini file. Before they added FOV in settings i had to go into photomod to reset the fov to my custom one. Since your bug is in reverse maybe your ingame fov is too high and glitched.
---
Anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise and aligning with aristotle.
---
Quite legitimate.   I got a shadow because it was cheaper than building a new gaming rig.   The mobile option was a definite plus.
---
Well I guess I'll have t just wait it out and hope the event eventually spawns for me, or wait till they fix the plan so it spawns at vendors for any level player. I also saw that it's in the loot list for the whole toxic region for events and containers but the math on that says I'm more likely to get struck by lightning before I find the plans that way.
---
Why do you have to be between those levels? Is it a bug?
---
just get calibrated shocks on the other ones..........
---
Dozens of creative, intuitive and immersive ways they could achieve this too. If they want to give the sense of building up the land, they need to work this in to the narrative. 
---
Well it sounds like you're using a 14.4k modem from the 90's, so that's half your problem. 
---
Is this Appalachia or Alabama?
---
Thanks. Not very often that I notice something like that that‚Äôs of practical use to people lol
---
Clowns, clowns never change.
---
So i gave them idea to resolute
---
Prepare to be disappointed.
---
The game updates causes mods to conflict with it, resulting in atom shop items sometimes not showing up. There are a few ini edits required, google them up. That should fix your floor problems, as far as I understand.
---
While everyone building a nice looking house, I'm stiil living in the cube
---
It's a mess to move, haha.
---
I've made several separate blueprints to build it back up in stages.
---
With some added QoL and functions, this has amazing potential.
---
Thank you for the kind words.
---
its popular because its the beginner armor that you get before youre allowed to craft other sets, and the game hasnt been out that long, after awhile nobody will be using it, once they put shocks on other armors since excavator defense is trash
---
I wish I had had you experiences. usually when hearing a female voice they are not interactions I want to continue.
---
Yeah and yeah.
---
They can't start the artillery though!
---
got that trophy and never had more than  2k
---
That makes sense. What the fuck is wrong with gamer dudes?
---
people say this a lot, but many missions end when the player completes it, not when the timer runs down, and the ones that do end on a timer can often be failed early.  so theres no guarantee on an end time for most events.
---
I see what you mean. I honestly haven't thought any further than just revamping the vendor sale system. The only idea I've got is to boost the item amounts up. Say they sell only one bulk item now, how bout boosting the amout to 10. Make a surplus.
---
&gt;update 
---
Currently I have still my doubts. Why it gets better it is like a really slow pace in my opinion and a lot of features need to be revamped.
---
Ridiculous. The moment passed a couple of weeks ago, and fallout is hardly the place for cheap pop culture references.
---
If you want an honest opinion, I didn't enjoy it because of the way you came off while describing that. I can't speak for the rest of the sub but I know I was cringing slightly reading that.
---
Or you get excavator shocks and have +200 carry weight
---
Wrong sub
---
Wanna have some armor?
---
Are you sure you were not on a discord channel?
---
 shrug. i did meet my husband gaming though and I have friends that game that are men so...

This is my first post so bare with me &gt;.&lt; I wrote it all out in notes all neat, I do not know why it did this whole scrunching thing it did with the format

There's a nice black lake on the edge of the Ash Heap and Forest near Charleston Fire station I've been planning to build on. Never seen anyone there.

On a side note, I recognize your name and have enjoyed several of your other posts in the past so take it with a grain of salt.

I love the game, but could we get a "I'm mad I bought a $60 game because Bethesda made me and instead of selling the game and explaining issues other than lore or bugs, I'm just going to post it and hope I get upvotes and then get off to others complaining and trash those who disagree" emote? I mean, c'mon Beth... /s

this game was coded by a team of abused orangutans

&gt;[specific thing noboby would ever fucking care about]

ftfy
---
Oh no I believe you I was just asking if you know a way to transfer them to my primary character that doesn't require a third party. I'm new to this kind of game so I'm just double checking that I'm not missing some way that I can do that by myself. My main character is level 70 so no way they're going to spawn on a vendor for that one.
---
Basically the mod has a flat 25% increase to damage, and also adds a perk while equipped that adds a further 25% damage to scorched and scorchbeasts and queen:
---
\[0004820D\] +25% dmg to scorched, scorchbeasts &amp; scorchqueen
---
There is no way without a friend sadly. And I feel your pain I had to make a second just to get the plans. 
---
You see no players around and timer will show 00:40 till end when you spawn on uranium fever .. caps lost time wasted and your mood ruined ( thats me 3x on this scenario )
---
As much as people just want to blame the shareholders (private firms can have shareholders before you chime in rando guy reading this) the devs and design really dropped the ball as well. The balance in this game is just not thought out at all.
---
Thats proper pvp. On the other hand, me and my mate (lvl 82 and 65) where legit griefed at Watogo Station. My buddy was 1 shot while trading at the vendor, I took 2 shots while scrapping at the tinker bench by a level 32 and level 165.  We respawned, tried to leave the area one shotted again, respawned and tried a power attack with my instigating grognak's axe, nothing, one shot again. Blocked both usernames, respawned, they spotted me crouched with chameleon, one shotted. Tried running away again, were chased down, one shotted. Left server.  These guys both had TSE shotguns plus probably dupped bobbleheads to one shot thru slap damage.  I've faught people over workshops and pvp after accidentally shooting a part of a campand getting wanted.  It can be fun, challenging,  FPS stuff. But when people use exploits to one-shot you 5 times in 2 minutes loosing 85 caps each time? That's griefing. 
---
Basically the original game files were around 45ish GB and they over wrote most of that original set with thier first major update. (The game was 45ish gigs before and after the first update, so it didnt get bigger) The other 5 gbs are the other patches and updates they have released that actually added more size to the game files.
---
\#notallmen lol  
---
Maybe you can get a voice changer box? hahaha
---
They look good with the brick walls. 
---
Mirelurk Emperor, Kaiju style.
---
gross! 
---
No, they dupe raid bosses.
---
The raid bosses drop the emotes, but there are around 16,000 of them in the instance at this point, so good luck.
---
But spawn rates depend entirely on players there
---
Such little hands. I didn‚Äôt know they put Trump in the game.  So cool.
---
It's not a game issue. It's a mod issue. When the game is updated, the mod isn't, hence the problem.
---
Yes, that is correct for the food and water. If you have dozens of crops planted at your base, of various kinds, one crop will produce every five minutes, but which crop produces is randomly chosen from the available crops that are not already waiting to be collected from. If I have a dozen mutfruit, tatos, and corn, and I collect every 30 minutes or so, I am effectively emptying out their inventories. If the first 30 minutes produces (randomly) almost all mutfruit, and I collect them, then the next 30 minutes could just re-produce mostly mutfruit again, meaning that by collecting often, I am actually screwing up the materials I need to make vegetable starch, since I won‚Äôt have nearly enough tatos or corn to match all the mutfruit I have gathered before they spoil. For this reason, I simply wait until my whole farm has produced, so the material balance will be correct. The inventories remain between server hops and whatnot, so at worst I lose a slight bit of production, if I am still checking within a reasonable time frame.
---
I have not studied the other resource nodes. For the most part, the devs placed the same workshop value as they did the number of respective nodes. It‚Äôs something that is easily testable, though. Grafton Steel lists a value of 4 Steel, only has 2 Steel Nodes, but seems to fill the nodes faster than nodes at other workshops. So it is highly likely that you are correct. If you happen to do the testing, let me know, and I will do a brief verification and update the original post.
---
Oh... Well that's disappointing
---
Only 1250 atoms

The only way to tell how bad the damage will be is after the patch

video of you playing

Very sure. These were randos I didn't know.  I don't even use a mic.
---
Amazing! 
---
100h+ i think it's enough for me 
---
A mod editing basic textures should have nothing to do with objects physically spawning in. This is a ground floor level flaw 
---
I‚Äôll take that if OP doesn‚Äôt:) PC?
---
another trick, is you can repair peoples walls after you destroy them, so if you are sitting in a camp you just wrecked and bounty hunters are tryin gto shoot you, you can unexpectedly repair a wall between you and the shooter to trick them into a bounty
---
Cool thanks man
---
It worked longer than modern civilization has existed.
---
What's that mean? 
---
Nothing wrong with reaching outside of your base, it‚Äôs how you grow.
---
The problem means those features need to be ‚Äúand more‚Äù not ‚Äúinstead of‚Äù and with the game rushed as it was any PvP is by default instead of.
---
the legendary drops used to be decent (almost always 3\* on a 3\* enemy) until they nerfed them because people were getting too many from whitesprings
---
now the chance of getting a good 3\* outside of WS is sooo low lol
---
It is affected, but only enemies get changed. So since there's no enemies inside the resort it makes no difference
---
Terrain glitch, what your seeing is sections of the terrain further away are being set alot higher than they should be, resulting in the "ominous wall"
---
everything i post gets downvoted right away. pretty sure someone has a bot that downvotes every thread
---
That's so nice. I like to share plans with new people too. I hope your camp build is shaping up nicely.
---
Somebody crafted and sold it to vendors. Common tactic to make caps
---
Can confirm.  Not working got me either.  Armed the lvl3 Cannibal just before taking on a mole miner camp with little to no aid.  Figured I‚Äôd eat my way back to health.  But was never afforded the option.  
---
Sorry if I missed you mate.  Honestly don‚Äôt recall seeing you.  This post has caused my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù ranks to swell and I‚Äôm unaware of familiar faces yet.   I will say that I was easily with 5 of you in the same instance.  I do think that this will provide that friendly default base I was hoping for.  Looking forward to seeing you and perhaps teaming up!  
---
Fair enough.  Let me try to put that together.  I'm at work, but I've got a phone and a tablet.  I'll see if I can get the tablet to record me playing on the phone.  Bookmark me or whatever; If I can't swing it today, I'll do it when I'm de-officed for the week, which would be Wednesday night.
---
Proof won't be instant but I will make it come.
---
If you don't listen to the haters the games a lot of fun. I held off buying the game because of the bad press but broke down to play with friends, and I'm glad I did. Its not perfect, but what game is? 
---
I r8 u
---
Question is, is it real or one of the plastic animatronic one from nuka world.
---
Toasters are pretty much hollow tbh
---
it looks awful. Bethesda better add the helmet soon. it's already in the game ffs
---
Seems that it's pretty low at white springs too.  I don't know if the nerfed it (again) in the most recent patch or what, but we recently nuked white springs and the sheer number of legendary drops (even the shitty ones)  just seemed way lower. 
---
I'm not talking about  killing 12 ghouls and calling it  a night. I'm talking a out killing them all, having a team member hop out then back in, and causing them to respawn over a period of hours to where I'm sure we killed several hundred ghouls. 
---
Keep in mind that I am NOT SAYING there were fewer great drops. I'm saying it seemed like not a lot of legendary gear dropped- period. 
---
In the past, it was a shit ton of terrible legendary gear with the occasional gem.
---
But this time, it was very little crap gear and almost no good gear.
---
Think they mean Limmy
---
Jimmy?
---
It gets better as in it gets less buggy i guess. Although for me the loading screens have gotten longer. 
---
This game has a lot of flawed design decisions and we‚Äôll see in probably no less than 6 months if they can turn it into a good game.
---
I can‚Äôt get over the feeling of how fun would it have been to play through the main storyline as it was happening, specially the brotherhood part.
---
Wow that's awesome
---
But when I try to build something portable but fun like that I get the objects floating bug.
---
Thanks Bethesda.
---
Was he in power armor, if not could of been some kind of assassin armor build
---
Mysterious Stranger perk but instead of the aforementioned it‚Äôs your teammates that attack whatever your aimed at in VATS. More people with said card means more accuracy or something.
---
The President would be proud.
---
I was there for ages too, great spot. If you position just right, you can get the water in the camp radius too.
---
I feel like Spooderman now lol
---
Well that came out about 4 days ago so‚Ä¶ no. 
---
I don't think you understood what I meant. I'm suggesting the cost of fast traveling from Vault 76 be automatically applied, not that it would tell you that there's a cheaper option.
---
And this is about 1 line of code change so saying "such a waste of coding time" is a bit of an exaggeration.
---
LOL my friend is of this mindset.  His camp is on the far West side by Hillfolk Hotdogs and I asked him why he would still want a camp there when it's on the complete opposite side of the map from everything he's doing.  No valid answer but refuses to move it lol
---
It also makes great bread.
---
do the excavator power armor quest, it also rewards you with a power armor station plan.
---
Nothing will make everyone happy. That would be impossible. Hopefully they fix things enough so most players are happy and have thing to do. They will need to come back through and buff some other legendary effects though, otherwise everyone who isn't already running a melee build will be soon and build diversity won't be any better than it was before.
---
And the dupers make the servers intentionally laggy to make it an authentic experience.
---
Lmao why?
---
I‚Äôve just got 8 small purifiers that don‚Äôt need water it‚Äôs wired because I only built 3 and every time I stored them and moved my cam they multiplied. Purifiers find a way!

Limmy

If we're such a circlejerk then why do we give both content/ QOL suggestions and criticisms that Bethesda listens to, a foil to r/fallout
---
Could maybe add a temporary buff like well tuned when playing a pipboy game?  
---
Well entertained? Adds +1 luck or something.   
---
we need helmets and make with ARMOR... instead more cosmetic items.
---
no Ron. go find becky
---
Agreed. I used the light wood laminate with my brick mansion and they look great.
---
Timmy? 
---
Rock'em sock'em robots? Oh wait, can't equip 'unarmed' in PA. Boo.
---
I am running rifles and melee. Nothing is really unkillable, and pure melee sucks with scorchbeasts flying around. I have been farming TSE rifles pretty hard with no luck, but now bloodied will probably be the only way to go for maximizing damage.
---
Instigating is also a pretty good perk. Double damage on mobs with full health. TSE will go from like 300% damage down to around 150%, where as Instigating will be 200% on the first shot. My instigating power fist kills pretty much every enemy I farm in white springs, and I think a suppressed instigating hunting rifle or lever action would be good for a sniper build.
---
The cons of a set time would be that some players would  have access to double the available vendors caps if their regular time is around the reset.
---
Meaning some players would have possibly 2800 caps from vendors each time they play and others only 1400.
---
A faction timer in an holoptape like someone suggested is a good idea.
---
True. I unlocked the BoS paint yesterday for the combat helmet and it fits my combat armor set pretty well. I didn¬¥t try it out, but this blue should also go well with the marine armor set.

Its both a spin off and cannon. More cannon thsn Tactics. Thats concerning!

I can think about a million things I would want before this.

While I agree, my utopia is that they balance all weapons and armor
---
This is a mostly a bug. Don't spam craft if your server is not stable. If the crafts are lagging behind, go slower.

Well that was a awful film. Awfulness and greatness don't mix well.

Bonus points if it actually protects against airborne diseases.

I sort by weight most of the time.

I have both, light for most area. Dark for kitchen, workshops. Looks good.

Got a mutants explosive lever action on ps4

The last one is my new header on Twitter. 
---
Terrifying. 
---
there are some less-traveled areas by the river on the far east of the map that are rarely used by others, and also several locations with small ponds swampland that aren't marked on the map.  just go out and explore and you can find some prime locations that people who don't go out and explore or don't remember the locations would never find.  the 2 camp locations I have for my 2 characters both allow 6 large purifiers and are only taken one out of every 12 or so log-ins.
---
I would rather have the black bird power armor skin be available again than something related to bird box.
---
Happens a lot to me. Harmless.
---
Metal offers best ballistic, but most enemies end game use energy like robots at nuke silos, combat armor gives well rounded energy and physical
---
Probably.  Someone looked at the game data files on PC and found that, for just the vendors that deal with the handmade plan (Watoga / Harpers) the plan list is replaced at each level, rather than adding to the list already there.  Seems unintentional. 
---
There are lots of spots like that near Harper's Ferry.

I just about gave up on launching nukes. My game either crashes during the fight. Or the loot doesn‚Äôt load.

Your mod is screwing with the very textures on the objects. That's why you can't "see" it.
---
Actually it would be perfectly fine. 
---
Fashion designers don't wait till a garment is made to select a fabric or sketch a design. You don't need detailed technical specifications of the engine to design a paint job for a car.
---
There are posters of the excavator armor in public view so it's perfectly reasonable to suppose a responder with modest artistic skills could not have taken that poster and designed one or several paint jobs for it in sketches. 
---
Where my camp is, just south of the vault, and has been, since I got the game back in November, I fall to my death every time I spawn in at my camp. If I fast travel, I spawn in under my camp, because I'm on a cliff. I'm debating on moving. But I'm not creative, and actually like how my camp is set up currently. Just hate that I fall to my death when I spawn in. 
---
Bethesda is pretty full up on employing idea people. Can you code the whole thing?

I need one for "I have a mic, but I can't be arsed to plug it in for the likes of you."

I've noticed the Grafton Steel extractors (the prebuilt ones) fill to 40 rather than the usual 20 (also I think it fills as scrap rather than ore still, I'll try to remember to check that), so it being listed as 4 still kind of makes sense. I tried just putting 1 extractor down on junk at Charleston but only have anecdotal evidence that it seemed to produce the same as I wasn't actually timing it. If I get a chance to check for sure I'll update. Thanks again for the info!
---
Funny, were 14years in too
---
More hats! I have dope masks but I like my characters face showing. No good hats right now for my sweet nuka cola clothes.
---
To be clear, I am over lvl 150 and I still wear my excavator all the time, because with calibrated shocks the extra 200 carry weight is worth more to me than a few hundred resists. 
---
Since I'm typically running around with \~400 weight and a full stash. That's not going to change unless they make good with increasing the stash again and its something substantial (like 1k). Otherwise I ain't leaving my excavator behind, not even for my jetpack +2xshocks X-01.
---
That would be bugged for sure and would make certain players disappear.
---
Its a feature, they said.
---
What you experienced wasn‚Äôt griefing.  That sounds like just the game mechanic as it was meant to be played, so I‚Äôm glad you had fun.
---
However, not everyone wants that PvP experience, whether it was so called griefing or not.  You‚Äôre making suggestions on how we might learn to enjoy it, but frankly, no.
---
If it were just a handful of people complaining, perhaps we might just have to get over it, but before the game even launched the community was practically fifty-fifty split on the issue.  A lot of us want the MMO PvE experience and the solution is easy, obvious, and completely unoriginal: separate servers.  
---
It‚Äôs great that Bethesda was willing to try something a little different and potentially more exciting, but collectively a lot of us have decided we still don‚Äôt want it.  It‚Äôs just not panning out as they (and we) would like.
---
Lastly, arguing that PvP can be fun is irrelevant.  There‚Äôs no argument that says it can‚Äôt be and occasionally even I‚Äôm interested in it.  But that doesn‚Äôt mean I want to be forced into that mechanic when so many other games have long since figured out the obvious compromise of separate servers.  
---
It‚Äôs not currently in the game, though some duper‚Äôs have access the dev rooms to find some.
---
Update:  Success and uploading now.  I will have a link for you when it gives me one.
---
Did they take it out??
---
Yeah I have this same problem.. I just don't go to him anymore, I'm sure he had loads of plans not long ago!
---
Got it to work! A nice fella talked me through it on discord!
---
Yes, everyone is aware that we want a ‚Äúrejoin last server‚Äù option. 
---
Start tearing up the terrain. It‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing. Launch a nuke almost daily after work. Multiple per day when off. 
---
Before long I‚Äôll get bored of that and start tearing up players or building up my alt (given how things have went, probably both as my alt seems to do alright in PvP so far despite being an 11).

Ohhh gotcha
---
No fuckhead it didn't spawn in I was literally falling through it
---
Any updates on this? Was it patched?
---
for me it‚Äôs been walking canes since i got the game on launch, i‚Äôve never seen anything else there
---
same here, walking cane is the only plan he's selling.
---
You can easily do that with a flamer trap. Yesterday I were building when a level 80 noob showed up, spamming trade invite, requesting my weapons and generally obstructing the view.
---
I placed a generator, placed some flame traps, connected all this and resumed building. Whenever the guy would obstruct piece where I wanted to build, I just "shooo" him with a flamer trap.
---
Don't act like you have any grasp of programming or game engines because right there you either proved you can't read or you don't know how game environment systems work on a basic level. Which is it sir?
---
I created a second character to play with my friend and that's mostly what I do. When logging in with my main char, I slowly build my ultracite armor, even if I hate PA's. Make little changes to my CAMP. Do a event or two. Maybe run thru Whitespring once. Log out and come here to talk about the game.
---
But I like the casuality of my game style, because I have a OK build, so I don't have to look for anything. Just wander around without a pressure and enjoy the scenery. 
---
I think it's posssibly some sort of storytime bias?
---
We only ever hear the stories about the "gross mouth-breather" that wouldn't leave the girl gamer alone, or the mysoginistic frat boi who is "t0talLy L33t" and acts like a dickhead 99.8% of his game time.
---
So naturally we have this assumption that all blokes on a game are somewhere in that spectrum of stupidity above, whilst the rest of the decent people (men and women alike) just go about their gaming sessions, unreported and unharassed.
---
Honestly anything giant is a win and fits with the 50‚Äôs style nuclear atom-punk, radiation makes things bigger, and when it becomes a problem, try nuking it, when that makes it a bigger problem, come together to fight it. 
---
I've found ONE. So it's not that it's never happening at all, but that they've become really vanishingly rare. I think that Bethesda really really wants us to be powering up Poseidon/Monogah/Thunder Mountain and setting up fusion core generators there. 
---
or you do them and the legendary enemy is 10-20 levels lower then the group its with making the legendary item USELESS!!
---
I recently updated my hardware.  Definitely want to experiment with these, as I haven't seen them before. Thanks for sharing
---
I wish, I am starting to get into code though so in the distant future? idk
---
Stroked yourself enough? Good.
---
So this is a different bug then. The one I said also happens. Big deal. May still be mod related though.
---
That does seem to be the most reliable way to get them these days. 
---
Yeah, I was looking at that today. I had a sort of hens night with my team mate whos a girl, went to the spa at Whitesprings, went shopping, got out hair done... That isnt Fallout though, is it? No, I am aware others have done this now, but I swear I had the idea of getting married when I first went to the Mothman Museum. So beutiful.

I only see the walking cane notes at the vendor. I think he also sold a bowler hat and eyeglasses, so I assumed they were trying to be funny.
---
It might be that his plans are level-locked like the [Harper's Ferry](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ad1n16/handmade_rifle_plans_level_locked_at_harpers/) vendor. Once you reach a certain level they're inaccessible.
---
Have you tried putting all your junk in the stash box? 
---
It just reeks of poor management to me. There are plenty of typos in quest descriptions and plans. The infamous techncial data is a perfect example. There are others that seem like typos in the code, like that one update that drastically nerfed the fusion core production rate at power plants (I think down to like .8 or something?) before it got shifted up, seemingly up to 8. Prime combat rifle uses ultracite .44 instead of .45. Many things also just seem incredibly rushed or unfinished. I don't mean stuff like locked rooms in the whitesprings, those appear to be intentionally sealed off for future content. I mean things like all the quests or stories with great buildup and little to no reward. The conveyor belt on the giant mining machine in the ash heap not moving when it's turned on. The fact that the new weapons have few to no attachments, and messy attachment menus (auto grenade launcher/.50 cal have only a few, mg42 has a bunch of slots but no attachments for most of them).
---
What's my point with all this? It really seems like there's just piss poor management up top. Either they aren't dedicating enough resources to tasks, or they give unreasonable deadlines for the task and team size provided, or they fail to take action against incompetent/lazy work. It seems like they either ran out of time or did not bother going over all the balance issues.
---
Here's what makes me think that: much was kept from fo4, as we know now from seeing the same bugs and so much returning content. But assassin's gear was intentionally lowered from -15% to -8%. This is likely due to them believing that 75% would be too much protection in pvp with a full set of armor, and there's nothing wrong with their decision. But they left sentinel's at 15% per piece, despite the fact that its effects also affect pvp. Seems like an oversight more than an intentional decision. Another thing is the lack of a cap for damage resistance. From what I understand from recent posts, people are capable of becoming invincible in pvp by stacking a combination of sentinel's/assassin's gear and lone wanderer. Meaning that reaching a nominal -100% actually gives you 100% resistance to all damage from a player while standing still and alone. But this does not apply for the new carry weight gear. If you have a 90% reduction perk like bear arms, putting on gear that reduces the weight of your weapons will not affect you if you only have heavy weapons. It seems like it can not go above 90%. I don't have 5 different pieces all giving the same reduction to see if you can reach 100% that way, but I'd assume if one method fails another will too. Past games also had a cap on damage resistance. The fact that people can reach 100% is terribly unbalanced, but it feels like that's just an oversight that would have been patched out if more time/resources was dedicated to looking over it
---
Man. Wish I was there with you my red coat brother. That's rough. But sounds like a fun conversation when it's happening.

Not actual fun though. But fun.

You don't need duped bobbleheads to one shot anyone. They just had your number.

"stroked yourself" uh this is about your reading comprehension Mr. Sanchez. You can invent a portal gun but you can't read basic or make inferences. Why would I care this much to post to reddit if my floors were just invisible? You got condescending and now you look like an assbag. Cy@

I got this from an Enclave event tonight and bought the clean steelworker's outfit from the Camden Park vendor. I also changed my appearance to be bald and to have a lot of damage to my neck, face, and head. I also crafted a machete and now I slow-walk around menacingly a la Jason Vorhees. I've startled many people including some who made the mistake of attacking me (they died swiftly with one or two very satisfying metal-meats-the-flesh whacks.
---
I snuck up on a wanted player in their camp and took them out quickly. Their 5-6 turrets quickly trained on me and started firing. Also, the person came back with two other players. I proceeded to just stand there, soaking up the turret's bullets, and took them all out with a few whacks. Good times.

I guess my utopia is that enough people continue playing this game for Bethesda to continue making more Fallout games in the future. Maybe a 4 person coop next time, but hey one can only hope. Maybe when they add private servers and mods later down the road it may be able to fit the roles we all want it to.
---
Yes the amount of free atoms you can get from this game is so large that you have to prefix that you shouldn't spend any of them.
---
I'm practically swimming in one free power armor skin.

SO MUCH FREE CONTENT

Nope :-/
---
This is really great! I especially like the events and nuked boss ideas.
---
Maybe just about the only people selling TSE weapons are fucking dupers who all deserve to be fucking banned because they're literally damaging other peoples gameplay experience for fucking money?

And if you don't want "input" don't "Post on a public fucking forum"?

 its either my luck or 90% of the TSE are duped.

But according to the logs, the whole point of creating BoS was to utilize US Army for the greater good and prevent the history from repeating itself once some general resurfaces.

Im talking bout you, Vault Dweller
---
Yeah, lost a piece of armor to it yesterday. It's weird because you can open the machine, look and see that there's only food items on the list, and then go to click one only to find out that your armor piece appeared on the list just as you were clicking. Why the delay? Why is the machine hungry for armor bits?
---
Perfect opportunity to reintroduce the forged /equivalent and allow us to make shiny things.
---
With the three perks anti armour effect and perforating mag it's around 81%
---
Upvoting.
---
Can I ask you an honest question? Why do you play this game? Why don't you play any other single player fallout game with much better reviews, much better support, many different mods? 
---
There should just be a dual-wielding mechanic. Just have the second one-handed weapon take the bash slot. Could make pistols more usable as well if you could dual-wield them (with an accuracy penalty). I kinda want to dual-wield combat knives.

Great work
---
I figured some other folks might want to do this, given the ability to.  I just wanted folks to know that that possibility is there.
---
I wish there was two types of unarmed, medium speed and very fast speed.
---
Medium speed would include the bigger unarmed wepons (power fist, mole miner, death claw) and you only equipped one. 
---
Very fast speed would be your boxing gloves, knuckles, normal fist. These would be dual weild and allow for special power moves like in FO:NV, but would be weaker to compensate for it.
---
So i do indeed lose the rosources that are left behind? Thats a shame. You would think that they are re-added to your inventory/stash upon logout. 
---
By best setups, i mean best ways to defend the workshops. Is it just create some high platforms and blow the budget on turrets?
---
Thanks!
---
Could try toggling the alternate pip boy, might work since it's a stand alone menu rather than your character bringing the pip boy close to the screen.

Lmao I see what you did there

Thank you :)

I got light one with barn building set and in my opinion looks nice. The Brick building set would be nice, but interiors are dirty and looks ugly.

Put calibrated shocks on excavator and you have +200 carry weight

It's really neat, I want to try it now.

If you decide to give shadow a test rental, DM me, I got a discount code.  Full disclosure;  The discount is just one month, and I do benefit from your use of it as well.  It's a refer-a-friend kind of thing.  But, ten bucks off isn't bad.
---
agreed. I am at 300h and the only decent weapon I got was after buying it from another player. Since then I can partage in Queen events or go in to rad zones. 
---
I was quite lucky when I got the mod in about 20 server hops. But dude 146 times damn!
---
Funny thing was that I actually saw it in the vendor last week and thought should I buy it and then I thought what‚Äôs the point lol
---
Speak for yourself. I definitely want a stock market type system for junk items , and it would be even better if you could tie it to a mobile app to arrange bigger trades without needing to server hop to the same server as your buyer/seller. 
---
What platform so you play on?
---
You can literally kill a scorched beast with a level 1 normal pipe rifle in under 20 seconds if you want to. Heavy guns are way out of balance atm. The only thing that makes them good is explosive or two shot. They suffer from the inability to use vat crit build and they lack ammo efficiency. Aside from the Gatling, Gatling can be setup to one shot ghouls without 2 shot or explosive. 
---
Agreed. I think it might break the game finally for me. I dont give d. about PvP. So the TSE was the only kind of weapon actually making a difference against the queen or when going toe to toe with scorched beasts. Now its ridiculous. 
---
They're identical as far as I can tell. That is why I posted the suggestion that there be unique silos with different quest objectives. 
---
Ok, that'd be pretty damned cool.  Dupers and scammers might make use of it; But simultaneously, it'd be easy to query that sort of transaction and spot that kind of behavior.
---
I love this comment so much that I‚Äôm going to commemorate it with a meta tattoo on my character that says ‚ÄúI complain, therefor I preorder‚Äù.

I've been getting a huge amount of crashes on pc since last patch

The problem is, it would turn into a bunch of people arguing with the devs over every single mechanic that got discussed.

Not exactly an original idea. I remember runescape having it when I played as a kid, and that game was browser based. Should be easy for Bethesda to implement, once the duper plague has been eradicated. 
---
Some are pretty bold too. Saw one selling crap on eBay. Openly posted up his inventory of tens of thousands of whatever he was selling. 
---
50 GB bugs

Riight.  It's not actually a mobile app.  Shadow is like a high-end gaming rig that you basically remote in to.  I'm playing Fallout 76 on full settings.  I can play it on my home computer, a tablet, a phone... it's a computer desktop on my phone, and I'm using my new gamepad thing to operate it.  It's a wee bit laggy in the video because I'm using a crowded office wifi connection, but it's definitely playable.  I've basically eschewed dropping two grand on a new rig and just use a shadow instead.  It's fun playing something at max everything, and *not* hearing your fan spin up.  You can play on a freaking potato with Shadow.  I'm a fan so far.
---
Yeah and they should make enemies level cap bigger, like level 200 scorchbeasts and level 150 ghouls etc

That combined with the fact that our characters become fire breathers justifies the paint job existing in my eyes at least. A rough drawing and a can of paint, why the hell not?

The only problem is that has been every server I have been on since the patch. The instability has gotten worse for me. I gave up trying to report what I am experiencing to bathesda since all they do is tell me the problem is either with my internet/network or my console. I have tested my network thoroughly and it isn't a problem, and I can play other open world multiplayer games without a problem so I know it isn't my console. I was just trying to let them know when I was having the issue, and what I was doing so it might help them in resolving the problem.

T-51b has the BEST ballistic &amp; Energy resistance of all power-armors and the lowest Rad resist... not exactly the best comparison for your point.
---
I actually think all the PA variants are reasonably well balanced.
---
Arguably Raider is the beginner PA as you can actually get a full wearable set of raider armor at level 15, while Excavator and T-45 start at lvl 25 .Compared to the Excavator, the raider is +100 B/E but -25 R and no +100 carry capacity so a much better comparison (trading Defense for Inventory). The selling point for raider is decent defense on the cheap (super easy on repairs).
---
T-45 and T-60 are highly similar all-rounders with the T-60 being a slight upgrade from the T-45, as you would expect from the lore. and given the T-45 caps out at lvl 45 and the T-60 at lvl 50.
---
T-51b fills a niche spot of best combat armor but weakest Rad resistance and moderate repair costs.
---
X-01 and Ultracite are both ultra-advanced, with the best all round resists (with slightly different focuses) but more advanced material costs for the tech advantage.
---
Since all PA can be either lvl45 or lvl50, they all have virtually the same mods which function the same way and the resist difference are within a few hundred resists of each other when appropriately leveled they are all viable. The Excavator is basically comparable to mid tier PA with weaker shell (damage mitigation) , average seals (radiation resistance) and stronger pneumatics (Carry Capacity) . 
---

---
The patch with that nerf hasn't gone live yet, so it's absolutely not that. Though yes, the use of the term is indeed correct. 
---
I agree that the dupers are scum but I think it would be possible to have an update include a ruleset that limits overencumbered weight to say 1000 lbs. This would not stop the black market but would seriously hurt it. The YouTube videos on this topic show players with 100k total weight. Sure they walk slow and suffer the negative effects buy it doesn't scale. If it did they couldn't move. I still love the game and outside of having to rush to sqb events or getting hosed on the uranium collector event is not impacted my game play that much.

It does mean you have to put down your controller and switch devices though. Being able to chat in-game using the Xbox chat pad would be nice (and convince me to buy a chat pad).

Yep. Exactly. Bungie did the same error for Destiny. Balancing PvE with PvE is not working. It will break the game completly.

Let me kindly direct you to Fallout 4, sir. It's a great game. Or three, or New Vegas.

Honestly, I think the Giddy-Up PA with movement speed bonus is more likely (especially since we have Excavator PA for Carry Weight).
---
I take both power plants on a slow server and wall in the generator area. Then I find I never the less than 10 in inventory and keep lvl 1 battery weight perk to control weight. They did return the production to pre patch levels. If on Xbox I'll sell them for 200 said all day long.
---
Can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not. ;)
---
I'm up almost 4k on my main account but I've not spent any as the PA skins look awfully tacky or boring. 
---
Now that chromed minigun... I'm sad enough to want that....
---
Give this a try. I just updated main post. 
---
Just updated main post. 
---
it's moments like these that will make you forget about bugs, nerfs, exploits, etc. 
---
Just explore the environment 
---
Not even sure what paint jobs are in game as only found the bos acolyte and nuka cola one so far. 
---
Ditto
---
Just uninstall this shit game
---
I ran events for 2 weeks and only had one drop.
---
Simple. Since the loot system is completly broken you have to buy it from other players.  I have a level 113 and a second level 51 char. In hundreds of hours I never found a TSE in or outside of rad zones. 
---
But i have "good news" for you. Since Bethesda decided to nerv the TSE in patch 5 to only 25% of the actual damage its not even worth aquiring anymore. The rest isnt worth the time. Unless you are a melee only build. 
---
I have a bette suggestion - just show a small no audio icon beside the player's name. Easy solution to a very common problem.
---
Have a ts on ps4 could be interested in trade or caps
---
What i did was spawn in a server and added mostly on that server and i cant believe that somwonw joined even from the post that got join and mostly while recruiting more i manage to get 14+ random people and made a group afterwards some created a voice party that few had join while we did that we were at the overseer camp and met some level 39 that was destroying my camp but tell you what his not very lucky up to against 14 people and as i am level 112 but i dont really care much people destroyibg my camp since i have lot of supplies but my friends insisted to kill him well mostly my "hired friends" were at lvl 21-89 while there was some level 102? I think and a 138 after that we made couple laughs and made a took a photo and stayed at camp for a long time and decided to go Flatwoods because there was player name "Queenphoenix" and we wanted to say hi and ask the "dae wae" sadly the game crashed (BTW it was recorded but when it crashed it didnt save, i was really mad)
---
We must all meet the same vendor
---
Yeah! That way it isn‚Äôt a constant overlay that removes you from the immersion. They could add little ‚Äúplayer name‚Äù signal has come in range to show who is on/off the server. 
---
FO4 had such a more immersive environment. Meeting NPCs, some NPCs could become companions, the stories behind each NPC...  
---
There was the moral choice in FO4 - save the institute,the Brotherhood, or the Railroad.  
---
There were NPCs that were despised (Preston Garvey and his band of do-nothings), but that added to game.
---
In FO76 there are robots, mutants, bugs, and scorched. There is nothing that really brings the player into the game.  Fallout76 is fun, but right now each quest, each day, is just repetitive.  
---
And that's really a shame...
---
OMG that will be amazing. Probably it won‚Äôt be free but I‚Äôd spend atoms for that mask 
---
how about "I'm only wanted because I had no idea picking that lock would flag me, kill me if you must"
---
And i'll be making post about it and more information
---
Id rather have a way to break down crappy legendary items, and then craft new ones with the desired traits from the unique materials.     
---
    
---
That way I wont feel like I'm wasting my time hunting for legends that drop worthless items 99% of the time. 
---
I have come across one guy in my 100 hours of playtime, it was during the characted creator, and I heard vague mexican and monkeys screaming.
---
How long do you think modern civilization has existed exactly?
---
I hope this turns out well and adds more fun to the game, great work!
---
I was wanted for the first time last night. Killing sqb and hit a players camo with a missle by mistake. It sucked. Finally went to lfg and posted a please kill me, 100 cap reward and it still took 30 minutes. More power to those who play the heel role, huge pain to me.
---
this is also a good idea bc you won't have to see the chat if you don't want to participate in it. I see a lot of people ask for text chat and am wary since spamming "guns for sale" would definitely be an issue, but if the chat was used through terminals/pipboys you could just ignore it 
---
Oh damn, didn't realize that. Good one!
---
Ahhh thats interesting was surprised to see one with a lvl 15 black powder pistol this weekend but it had taken shelter in the building by the spawn at Harpers Ferry... mystery solved. :)
---
Have you tried getting a deeper voice
---
Get gear with reduced damage taken while standing still. Combine barbarian/evasive/dodgy and you're nigh unkillable. Add Dense mod on chest and Fireproof and you cannot damage yourself with an explosive shotgun shooting at the floor.
---
Im currently amassing a large bounty to get attacked and test it further. I just did the scorchbeast queen and was literally immune to non rad damage. Face tank her with an explosive shotgun.
---
That would be so cool
---
Barrens chat?
---
That's all I can see.
---
Lol I stopped playing fo76 to play atlas and all this sub ever is ‚Äúadd this into the game‚Äù lol most of them are just blatant reposts weekly it‚Äôs kinda sad
---
had the oppsite happen heard a player talking but couldn't find them listened for a couple minutes and realized they were playing dota and somehow fallout didnt fully close for them and they were still able to talk in game
---
I think he wants Fallout 76 declared non-canon. While I agree that Bethesda fucked the lore with this release, your suggestion actually works lore-wise. The Chinese had at least 5 years, prior to the bombs falling, to learn of Liberty Prime's construction. 
---
Somehow the Chinese managed to build a base below Mama Dolce's, so I don't think a giant Liberator would be that implausible. I don't think nuking Morgantown should set it off though. Doesn't really make sense to have a giant robot activate when a nuclear warhead was detonated above it.
---
I‚Äôve had this exact problem with the reactor. Assuming it‚Äôs a glitch. If you have lock picking 3 and backing 3 you can completely bypass that part and override the security lock down. I do it all the time it‚Äôs faster and I don‚Äôt have to deal with the glitch. Also if you have hacker 3 you can hack the terminals in each sections and have the turrets shoot the robots! How I solo my first ever attempt at a silo. 
---
Thanks for the read 
---
Even though you are technically correct, the fact that this player has these items means they plan to use or distribute them back into the game. If they had truly stopped and looted a duper they should of discarded and deleted the items. 
---
Keeping these items makes this person just as bad as the original duper as they did not get rid of the items. 
---
blank holotapes are in the game already, those could be used to make our own 
---
Crimson can be found by nuking the farms in upper left corner on the map. Someone did it the other day and I was like why in the world did you nuke there. Not many beasts but the kettle is full of blood something plants that turn crimson. Sent the guy who dropped the nuke a ty because I could finally build my rad shower.
---
&gt; Why the hell has the game price not come down by much? I really want another copy for my cousin to do more co-op stuff... STILL over $60
---
Wow $60 Dollar is bad. I can buy the PS4 version for ‚Ç¨23 incl. taxes (~$26) in Germany. 
---
I just bought the pc version for under ‚Ç¨10. 
---
The US market seems weird :/
---
I wouldn't mind parting away with people who only play the game because of their TSE
---
Not sure if you found it, I just ran into it at the Camden Park vendor, still RNG, but it does exist.
---
&gt; Anti Material Rifle
---
Upvoted
---
PvP whiner alert. 
---
Well, hes not wrong, i got a full set of unyielding armor and agend under armor with +3 STR im at 33 STR outside of PA and at 18 STR inside of PA. 
---
not yet.
---
Im not dead yet 
---
Yup - this is what I do too.  No need to faff nuking other places, WS for mats and SBQ for raw violet flux.  
---
I can pay 2,000 for the jetpack torso. My PSN name is the same as here, so add me if you‚Äôre down to sell.
---
ICP used dick-anus in Hokus Pokus üòÇ
---
Enjoy the last fun days of the game man. It will change drastically.
---
Oh yeah, absolutely.  I've always used OC Decorator etc. in Fallout 4.  But I guess I thought they may have figured out that it's something we want.
---
In both games.  I mean it's baffling.
---
But they made a paint can mixer just for that one off mission! The attention to detail part of me say "Right on!" Then that side remembers that these are the same paint cans which the designers thought would be best used as a source of... oil and steel. Seriously? Have they seen 50's era stuff? This is the age of powder coating! The paint job was a key component in most devices.  
---
They are seriously missing out on an opportunity with the CAMP system. 
---
If they increase our budget and build radius, and start pumping out items for it, they would definitely start seeing money.
---
muh npcs!
---
yay now its so fun not being able to kill even a scorched beast. Great stuff!
---
Well at that price of consider selling mine, platform?
---
Thanks I missed that when playing with mine - was shooting just close things. Dumped it in my stash somewhere about a month ago - time to retry.
---
They need to overhaul the whole way events are triggered.  95% of the events I see on the map have nobody playing them - they've just been triggered and ignored.  It's immersion breaking and dumb to have them trigger and harass you like a spoilt child just because you walked past.  
---
Yer darn toot'n!
---
I have made longer slideshows ;)
---
The Whitespring vendor has only ever sold the walking cane in notes since the game came out (at least for me). He is the last guy you would want to but plans from.
---
That Radroach was packing some serious ~~heat~~ cold.
---
Go into first person mode and you should see him holding it with two hands.
---
I actually really like the clean versions, and would like to see more clean versions of existing items. 
---
Appabama.
---
Nope, still haven‚Äôt found it, thanks for letting me know :)
---
No. Bethesda just nerfed the TSE but the bobblehead stacking exploit is still happening. You know the one enabling to one shot the queen?
---
So in an other words Bethesda removed the reason to farm for end game gear but still leaves the players glitching the game to do however they please. Great job.
---
&gt; I have a really nice clown outfit with a cloth sack and heart emote I think it would really add to the experience.
---
Settle down, Gacy.
---
I am counting on it. Bethesda is doing their best to nerf the fun out of the game. I expect this to be happening in the next month.
---
I found a dozen or so cosmetic items in the Sutton station in the trashcan by the bathroom one time. One of my top fo76 experiences so I now do the same to pay it forward 
---
Cheap to make and sell for a good amount of caps. &lt;3
---
I own a Shadow PC as well (use it to play Fallout 76) and I have multiple questions :
---
\- How do you make FO76 appear under "Games" in the shadow beyond interface, it does not appear in mine ?
---
\- Do ou think it would work with a USB-C to USB converter + Xbox one controller ?  
---
\- How's the latency ? Do you use the mobile network or wifi ?
---
Nice base, stops intruders and looks elegant 
---
how did you know it was a duped weapon?
---
Gas Mask doesn't give scrap, like several other Hats/Outfits.
---
I would wait until level 50 anyway so you can get the all rising at level 50
---
We could just have bicycles.
---
They have the frames in game, now just need the animation.
---
Do you mind selling one to me ps4
---
Even when looking away, I'll sometimes get drawn back to the crafting table.  Maybe, I wasn't fast enough.  
---
What platform you on ?
---
dont it will be worthless with the upcoming patch. 
---
Ps4
---
I don't use the shadow beyond interface at all, so I couldn't tell you.  I install and run it from the desktop.
---
USB-C would probably work perfectly fine, if not better. 
---
In crowded wifi, slightly laggy sometimes, depending on the lag.  From home computer that's straight ethernet over MOCA, it works pretty much perfectly fine.
---
Sure thing. will be online in about 4-5 hours (at work atm)
---
oh ok, yea below average although probably still better than laser guns.
---
because of whining pvp kids.
---
I have my Charisma maxed to 15 because Im a medic build and thats where all that stuff is. I do get some pretty good supply rewards.
---
ok I can't help, I am on Xb1. It take me at least 15 hops before I saw it, so just keep hopping.
---
but you have to send out like 10 friend invites in order to join them, that's a pain in the ass
---
He wants us to put on some spontaneous dance offs with top hats an canes.
---
I'm running full Assassin's, Lone Wanderer, Dodgy, Barbarian, Blocker, Fireproof and Padded chest 
---
It's weird, most TSE weapons actually don't do a lot to me but shotguns still rip through somehow. Don't know what to make of it, maybe I need to upgrade to Dense.
---
Just held out at Riverside Cabins for about 3 hours with a bounty of 580.  Managed to repel everyone until someone with an explody shotty came and took it.
---
Got a few people on my side during the process for some shenanigans tho so it was pretty amusing.
---
It's fun when people aren't taking it all too seriously. 
---
From my testing, they seem to be on a 24+ hr timer now so farming them you have to really travel as once you've got one at a location you won't get more. Same with the PA suits but those at least spawn once per type and level now so the less visited location I use I just server hop to get one from a T-45, 2 from a T-51 (30th and 50th) and one from a T-60. Of course there are a couple of other close locations but server hopping just to get cores is REALLY tedious. 
---
Thanks Bethseda that really enhanced my game play experience.....
---
I have a level 45 instigating lever action with a silencer.  Fantastic sniper weapon.  Amazingly, I bought it from Watoga Station after a Scorched Earth event - someone had sold it!
---
i really want a bare gas mask without any visor, something like ulysses's gas mask from FO:NV
---
I think he means in general for multiplayer games which is something I've noticed too. People have a multiplayer but either don't have a mic or don't use it. 
---
My definition of griefing is strongly based on the intent of the action. Someone killing someone to get their loot is not griefing while someone killing someone to make them sad or "griefed" is griefing.
---
It's from the dev room. I'd be very careful with the helmet, and the plan. Heard Bethesda's investigating and sof kicking accounts... 
---
I throughly enjoyed playing the market in WOW. Something like that in 76 would add some hours for me
---
Thanks, not sure I've done that one - where does it spawn?
---
I personally think its an experiment. Bethesda is nerfing the fun out of this game. First legendary 3 stars now only dropping crap, then whitesprings xp nerf and finally killing the end game gear. 
---
Try to only fast travel in it. If you break a leg out there, youre 150 pounds overweight
---
One time friend and I spent hours into building a base not that far from flatwoods then i shot this level 25 guy that was just passing by my base because I just got this really nice shotgun my friend had modded for me, and i really wanted to test it out then after a while we both put on power armour because we were about to go white springs to farm some ghouls there. The level 25 thought we were trying to attack because we shot him and both got in power armour then he immediately switched to a level 102 account and blew up my base with a mirv rocket launcher....after that I decided to mave to the edge of the map in the middle of nowhere 
---
This would be a really good suggestion for Bethesda, I think.  AFK trades, via mobile app.
---
Lol ya true unless islts a starwars one.
---
Exactly what rapidwiz said. Wait till level 50 to complete it. Sometimes you have to listen to the holo tapes a second time for them to count and yes they are long and boring
---
Great idea.  Lv 80 here, Wooster70, playing in the late evening, European time. Can use a mic.  Critical rifleman build, pacifist, absolutely no dupes. Now mainly hopping from event to event, occasional Whitesprings in search of those legendaries (my best weapon is a 1-star Medic's Gauss.  I have mainly left spare plans and ammo in railway station containers, but will share them with like-minded individuals :) I use only 2mm and .45. Can build you railway and radium rifles. 
---
What weapons will you use?  PA or non-PA? Solo or group?
---
As a skeleton build with this in mind I would start with something like [this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=434a36b&amp;d=l71a72sg2ee2ir2c72lt2la2lu2cm2cu2pe2a12&amp;w=&amp;n=lowHP).  You won't really want Born Survivor, as if you plan to be low enough for Nerd Rage to take effect, it will automatically consume a stimpak every 20 seconds, even if you're only missing 1 HP, both in and out of combat.
---
Also, for any Low HP build, Dodgy/Action Boy is a must.  Coupled with Serendipity (NOTE:  Serendipity does NOT work inside PA), it's an enormous survivability boost and I excluded Dead Man Sprinting so that you're not consuming excess AP.  Although you COULD still include it...I personally wouldn't.  
---
I also added Starched Genes and Class Freak, as being a Low HP build means you should definitely be using the Adrenal Reaction mutation, but since the negative effect of that mutation is -50 max HP, you'll probably want to have Class Freak to reduce that to only -12.5 max HP.
---
I also wouldn't level endurance solely for the HP as it's only 5 per point, and if you go no PA/Serendipity you're going to want to use many of the remaining points for skills like Evasive and Iron Clad, possibly Barbarian and Refractor as well.  If you had to drop anything I suggest, it would be Glow Sight.  It's nice, but not a must-have.
---
I know, I just can't find ways to throw junk. I like all kinds of weapons, like, I keep Spears and Drills and Baseball bats just so I can dress tribal/mechanic/baseball pro and have laughs with others, but they weight too much. Otherwise I wouldn't use PA. But for the junk runs, this suit is like no other!
---
You dont become wanted for hitting a player you simply cant unless you kill a player who doesnt initiate combat back, either way if the other person was in his team he can initiate pvp regardless
---
I mean, you could've literally just turned around and thrown the grenade in the opposite direction lol.
---
And consider yourself lucky. Players coming together for shenanigans like that is the game approaching it's potential. 
---
More often than not, if you see something like that going down, just head over. If there were that many people in it, I doubt it was a private event. You'd be surprised how friendly a lot of people in the game are.
---
Thanks :) when you play on your smartphone, do you use wi-fi or have you tried 4G ?
---
Power fists of course
---
At this point I'd be happy with any emote that is not just a reskin of an already existing one. (Like they keep trying to sell me in the cash shop..)
---
Someone port this mod to ps4 thx.
---
Luck only affects the durability of found loot, not the quality. The item found is always a random drop based on enemy and level or the event in question. Charisma affects the xp reward for group quest rewards, like helping a leader finish their current job, but I'm not sure about solo. It does have a good range of all-purpose helpful skills though, while Luck perks are more specialized.
---
I agree with this...I can't seem to get past her armor with my shotty but my handmade and lever action do almost every hit..and I have all shot gun perks maxed..and only m one point into the three rifle perk cards
---
Dont think so, they are both primary traits
---
You don't seriously believe the average netizen puts that much effort into checking details before downvoting in outrage, do you? :)
---
That too. Making the area a place where waves containing legendaries can spawn in like the Uranium Fever Event would make them even more enticing.
---
Oh wow! Thanks for the info. I didn't try the closer areas and went directly for the western golf course, so that's why. I'll try again!
---
please read the topic: NON-MELEE-BUILDS
---
It does, along with all sorts of other cool additions. 
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
I won‚Äôt have a positive outlook until the game gets a new update I‚Äôve gotten too bored tbh after 80 levels
---
I can't unlearn the plan, so if you're right and the item is from dev room, it's not me who stole it from there...
---
Thanks will check it out
---
My bad. I‚Äôm just moving back to my furious explosive submachine gun. Found and modded all by myself so its comforting to use
---
Those are low prices, I see people sell stimpacks for 200 a piece (which I think is too much) and 2 caps per bullet.
---
You should up your prices. But not too much. Just enough where you get your caps worth.
---
Should have 2-5 slots in our stash that are only for character sharing.
---
All rise and a good combat shotgun are more than enough. For the queen youll need a team effort anyway.
---
What's TSE?
---
Yeah would be very cool!!
---
It'd work as long as the text only went as far as voice chat did.
---
For me, FO4 being immersive? Not so much. Especially from a setting standpoint. 
---
While it was set in New England, and famous landmarks were around, it just didn't over whelmingly feel NE. The NPCs just didn't come off as New Englanders.
---
Not to mention the fact that it's largely a giant walking cliche. Including the entire son kidnapped by some bad guy....but wait! He's just a pawn! There's a larger power at work here! Why make compelling companions? We'll just make them all cliches of some kind. 
---
The story was boring, predictable, and just wasn't compelling. 
---
It was the least immersive and engaging of all the SP Fallout games for me. 
---
That said, I would love to see Fallout slowly start seeing NPCs re-enter WV. 
---
Maybe a small Brotherhood presence here, a returning responder setting up a settlement there...
---
Thank you kind sir, I am hoping my other friends will be as accepting as you 
---
Yeah it works well. 
---
Mix that with 15 strength all 2h cards, adrenaline,  nerd rage, Adrenal Reaction, i have seen 1260 damage on a super sledge common enough :)
---
Thanks for the suggestions, I'm glad you caught the born survivor, I didn't even consider that.  I'll probably go without power armor so I'll readjust the perks here in a second.  But seriously thanks.  I think this will be a fun build rather than most of the OP ones out there.
---
What platform you playing on id definitely be interested in buying 
---
I have a PS4 controller accessory that lets me mount my phone for things like text chat or companion apps. I‚Äôm sure they make it for Xbox as well. 
---
It's way more than that but that's all you give attention to I guess, so that's all you think there is. Not bad posts tho, we want our game to grow. And we might help it grow with suggestions instead of bitching around.
---
It's kinda sad how you come back to the sub of a game you stopped playing, just so you can bitch about it.
---
Ideally you would have local proximity-based chat. This is what the PC mod/hack does. There are global channels but you can turn them off.
---
I used wifi, haven't tried 4g.  But I'll tell you what, when I de-office in a few hours, I'll give it a whirl and let you know.
---
Data-wise, I figure it would be about as data-intensive as just streaming video off of youtube.  Because that's what shadow basically is; You're streaming the video of the "desktop" and your controls are just passed on to it.   Someone's twitch streaming a TV hooked up to a nintendo, and you have a remote game pad to control it, and you're watching the stream.  That's effectively how it works.
---
For real man. I'm like "Wow, I'm parched. Better down 12 bottles of bourbon. Totally legit"
---
I never had it work for me before the patch either, I have it at rank 2 and have just unequipped it for now. Not sure if rank 1 or 3 works properly though.
---
This is going to require more testing, boys!
---
I dont know, but I want to try that now
---
You should also tell that to Blizzard and the Diablo franchise to do the same thing.  Its been nearly 25 years and Diablo 2 still has duped items for sale on ebay.
---
The Commonwealth felt nothing like New England. It had the landmarks and such. The Fenway reference. But it's residents and over all vibe just didn't drive home that local identity.
---
Meh I have 4 points in it and I do well.
---
Everything part of your C.A.M.P. is part of the  budget, including anything you got on stored tab.
---
How exactly do you use a pip boy with a boxing glove/power fist on...? ü§îü§îü§î
---
Many thanks !
---
How much for the lever-action plans?
---
This game is an exact copy of fo4, with some new stuff mixed in. All they really did was change the map, erase the npc's and unclass the player so that quests can be completed by everyone. We all know the quasmoke cell existed, it was just a matter of when and who would find it. 
---
I've got it at rank 3, unequiping &amp; equipping have made no difference. Guess I should probably raise a case ....
---
Will they be nerfed that badly? I sorta wanna see how they go before rolling in ashes.
---
I had good luck with a +30% against animals for a while. 
---
Shit! I‚Äôll take your 10mm ammo! I have a semi auto 10mm that causes 3s continuous fire damage with each shot. Love to watch my enemies burn. But I run through the ammo like bejesus. 
---
I've been meaning to try it but I'm short on caps and steel
---
Jup here! I made my speed build yesterday an tested many things. Grim Reapers Sprint doesn't work, also gun runner has no effect. That is pretty shit cause speed build is that no way at the moment... 
---
Wait till level 50 to do it.
---
Search on youtube, there's a video explaining how to complete that part. I saw it and did the quest without any issues.
---
I'll swap you for a handful of Ultracite Explosive Vent plans. They're really, really rare. Really.
---
I don't understand this. Even after the nerfs, what other legendary prefixes will add more damage to a weapon than two shot and explosive? They're still going to be top tier legendary effects. They're just being tuned down from stupid great to great.
---
Other than that, furious weapons and anti armor can probably begin to compete.
---
That's my thing, people seem to expect waaaayyyy too much for stuff, especially considering that technically you can get all this stuff yourself for free, but you pay for it because of convenience and what not, so im trying to make it so you dont have to think "every time I shoot this gun I'm shooting a cap" and the more used/needed chems I might up a little bit.... got any suggestions on what you think I should charge?
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ not mine tho! Not that mine is better... 
---
990
---
1 skin for 1 gun for how many atoms?
---
Currently only on Xbox, but i do plan on getting it for PC at some point, however if i do it will be some time before i can get the store up and running on PC since ill need to build up my stock and all
---
Hey, is there a bug with the weapons workbench currently or am I missing a perk? I can build lvl1-20 hunting rifles but for whatever reason I cannot build lvl30-50 hunting rifles, my character is lvl 88, lvl 5 gunsmith.
---
2000 caps
---
hahahahahahahahaha
---
I live in the Mire. I have also never had camp spawning issues... but I've also never seen another camp or a neighbor.  Other than the mirelurk queen and her gulper friends, that is. 
---
Yeah, Blu makes some great USB mikes. The Yeti is popular. They even sell them at GameStop now.
---
Not the cheapest, but they‚Äôre great for recording. Haven‚Äôt tried for game chat though. 
---
the emote should be of someone who is mute... dunno how you could possibly visualize that. maybe a cut off tongue? or you could just go with not-mute and do a classic ziplock across the mouth, because why not?
---
Already had an offer... will contact you in a few hours if the deal fails.
---
have you tried turning it off and on again
---
Some say if you nuke the mire late at night, this creature might appear to feast on the bones of the young.
---
Targetting hud causes crashes ?
---
2500 caps for the jet pack.

there's also the chaos theory, where people just downvote for no reason at all. i've done my part for today.

I'll probably be on around 10pm GMT. GT: Peb2910
---
Shotgun is crippling just fine
---
Worthless how? It‚Äôs increased damage still vs any mob friend. Just because it won‚Äôt one hit anything doesn‚Äôt meant it won‚Äôt be decent still. 
---
It is my favourite weapon and it‚Äôs what I am after ^^ 
---
I appreciate your point but this is still the path I wish to travel
---
You should at least double the prices of everything. You'll still be much cheaper than ingame vendors. 
---
I have noticed that players always sell things for way too much caps. I'm glad that you dont.
---
NP, if you're not focused on min-maxing you can for sure keep things like Dead Man Sprinting even if you do go with Dodgy.  It may have small windows of vulnerability, but you can use it tactically, use AP regen aid items etc. and get the best of both worlds.  You could also easily drop Tenderizer and Glow Sight to add more utility.  They're not mandatory by any means, but are nice damage boosts if that's your thing and you could also consider dropping Suppressor, since it only effects targets you're actively hitting and if your TTK is high, it would really only help you on SBQ.
---
TwoShot Explosive. So basically you can get a shotgun that will shoot 2x the disgusting fireworks at some poor soul.
---
They have a habit of totally fucking the framerate when you get 2 or more people shooting them
---
Yeah. I took off my helmet for a bit and I was fine. Put it back on and fast travelled one time boom. I've had back to back crashes with the HUD. It's bad lol
---
dunno, if you can create your own channels/clan chats or whatever this wouldn't be a problem. those who like public chats can have their dehumanized stuff (i am actually in this camp sry) and those who don't can still communicate with their party etc. like what if you're deaf? now you have to use a third-party tool just to communicate... alt-tabbing etc for every message. feels kind of pointless imo.
---
No, I don't remember the names. The auto stim armor only works every 30 seconds, or minute, one of those. This would be a constant stream of stimpacs for an extended time instantly healing.
---
It just looked glitchy and I'll just kill my bounties from very far away from now on. 
---
I love you. So much. Thank you. 
---
I could try it. Do you know all the workshops that have vertibots?
---
If this happens again, check your list of completed missions. Sometimes a mission you already did pops out in tour main screen even if you already completed it. 
---
If this is the case and mission appears as completed, just ignore the message.
---
I have my Camp near Camp McClintock and although I finished all quests in the game sometimes I get the pop up to complete Recruitment Blues. :/
---
Well that is the extra you will get if you put something that produces water down in the area.
---
So it just fills your water producer up quicker. Can be a help if you need some quick. Same with food you can plant.
---
OPs got a point. Any higher and the 'convenience' of buying from him disappears.
---
A Stimpack or 200 is ludicrous considering most Vendors overprice them and still don't sell them for over a 100 iirc.
---
You can cancel a grenade throw by entering the pipboy and releasing R1 inside the pipboy. 
---
turret take allot of space  10 or 15 % each  i think the rest  almost nothing   
---
Turrets, pre built world objects, extractors, blueprints
---
thing is there are legitimate sexists and other rude people, and then there are people who are simply rude because they are insecure and ultimately not that sociable. people often mix these two together, but i've found out that most people who make bad jokes, or even sexual jokes, are just super bad at being social; very few are actually sexist or creeps.
---
same thing in real life. socially awkward people are constantly viewed as creeps, even though most likely they are super chill people that wouldn't harm a fly (because most people are). the actual creeps don't get nearly enough flak for their creepiness.
---
I guess enough so levels 200 dont kill the queen in 2 minutes.
---
I've heard that in WOW (correct me if I'm wrong, cause I certainly might since I only player it for 4 hours) enemies are scaled up/down for each player independently. Even if what I heard isn't true, I think it is an interesting concept. As a lvl 10 player you could roam with your lvl 100 friends, since all the enemies would appear as e.g. lvl 15 to you, whereas they would appear as let's say lvl 110 to your friends.
---
This is incorrect, Food=how many harvestable plants are in the area. Water=how many water spawns (I.e. dirty water, purified water, boiled water) are in the area
---
Well damn that's what it does? Good to know.

4. I claim the workshop at Poseidon power plant and then fully complete the powering up Poseidon event. Then I get disconnected from the sever. This has happened twice to me on the same day. I am also playing solo. I thought I would mention it is really laggy in the reactor room as well.

power armor cant be legendary though, i have personal experience with a jetpacked X-01 chestplate that confirms they're easy to accidentally scrap

‚ÄúTake this gift!‚Äù

We do have vehicles in the game.

All it takes is injecting Speed Demon and Marsupial into your thighs.
---
There you have it, a ride a Rocket 69 would envy.

Same for PC and it's one of the best reasons to use Power Armor.

Have you ever used proper old school tongs for metalworking?  They're solid metal essentially unlike a toaster which is composites etc.

Thats what we need... guys trying to bang guys posing as girls... lol
---
from their upcoming patch notes: 
---
"(UPDATED) Changes to the Two-Shot and Explosive Legendary Mods: The Two-Shot and Explosive Legendary Mods will be undergoing a few balance changes in this next patch. We know that there has been some frustration over how powerful these mods are, particularly when combined and used in player vs. player combat. With Patch 5**, the damage bonus for Two Shot Legendary modded weapons has been reduced from +100% to +25% damage** and the Two Shot legendary mod can no longer be looted in the world. **The Explosive Legendary mod has a reduced damage bonus, now adding +20% of the base weapon damage with explosive radius damage instead of +100%**. Note: This was a misunderstanding in what was being addressed with these mods. They will still be available in the world but are just undergoing some balance changes. Thank you for your feedback, and we look forward to hearing your thoughts on the changes."
---
So in short every TSE end game weapon will nearly worthless afterwards.
---
Sometimes she's technically alive but you can't interact with her, sometimes she's dead and you can loot her.
---
I need a wait one minute while i go find a mic in my desk because imnot used to talking to me in this game andthe headphones get too hot.
---
I never stated i didnt have a desire to play the game or anything like that, relax buddy. Just sad that there are literally the same weekly posts about what "should" be added and the constant reminder that they aren't being added.
---
Let us roleplay as Balrog
---
An in-game message board/chat, with a Grahm sightings tab? Please and thank you.
---
While I do find reliance upon third party / fans online content to provide basic MP functions very lazy, I think this is unworkable because BGS is accountable for any ingame content (moreso on consoles than PC).
---
They would have to proofread/validate every text, moderate discussions... and they are already strugling with the ressources affected on the game.
---
Haven't been there so I can't say or relate. 
---
But if there are going to be NPCs in future, it should definitely contain the brotherhood since the vertibirds are being piloted by someone and also considering that if it was the scorch plague that whipped out humanity....The brother in FO4 did live in a big ass balloon sooo...
---
Wade Airport, the Munitions Factory, Poseidon Power Plant Yard,  Grafton Steel yard. Those are the four I've found from reddit posts and the ones listed on the vertibot signal grenade page on the wiki. I'll check Monongah PPY in my spare time to see if it has one as well. Those four are confirmed, though. 
---
Ok will do thanks guys :-)  
---
Now I have to somehow make it all the way back home, "so overloaded". Is the mine still the best way to get back to the left side of the map? My camp is about centre of the whole map near Sutton. This will be a long walk ;-D
---
When attacking a scorched beast with my TSE gauss it still takes me like 6 or 7 shots to kill it. After this patch I will have to multiply by 4. Which means it will take me around 24 to 28 shots with the highest endgame weapon and like 6 reloads in between. So only 1 scorched beast wastes ammo and resources way too much for me to really fight it. Let alone 3 or 4 at the same time. Add the riciculous small amount of xp - why should we bother fight these beasts end game at all?
---
I put a purified water thing in the area, but it still makes 2 purified water like normal. You are saying it makes it faster?
---
Could always have some kind of broadcast terminal you have to travel too
---
Yes it make crash.... an other bug
---
:'(
---
what is a water spawn example because I see no standing water in Gorge Junkyard to put a bigger purifier in. Or you are saying there is guaranteed 3 purified water cans in area?
---
yes i had the same problem..had to scrap my helmet because you cant remove the mod..no more crashes after i crafted a new helmet with no mod.
---
 "I'm pink, therefore I'm cram" 
---
I really like these ideas. This post should be upvoted more imo
---
I will copy my answer from another post:
---
I got the hat plans, and wondered why I couldn't make it. I've found the suit plans 3 times on 3 characters. The locations were not the ones you listed, so I'll try to grab a screenshot for you. Outside the house near the first radio tower (twice), on the road near the SW corner of the starting area (South of the Mothman town) (also twice, once with the hat plan). I've also found the body with no plans, on a character that had already found and learned the suit plans. I don't know why this is.
---
Or just jump servers and leave the camp alone
---
Okay. Didnt know that wade airport had one as well. 
---
I dont know that Monongah power Plant doesnt have one. Over a month ago I took over that place disappointed.
---
Oh I agree they look totally overpriced.... but not much that looks worthwhile in the store - I'd buy the quiet purifiers/generators but the paint looks awful, I'd buy the snipers clothes but I use power armour too much and not sure if it visually overrides normal armour (if not it seems pointless).... which just leaves weapon skins and everyone notices the minigun when it opens up. ;)
---
I appreciate the thought sir, but this is what I want. I‚Äôm not looking to min max here I‚Äôm just trying to get my hands on my favourite weapon with some stats I want. 
---
Agree 100% I think it‚Äôs almost as worse than duping as your going out of your way to fuck over other players
---
those orbital strike grenades really come in handy in this exact situation, feels good seeing them blow up. the owner doesnt even get any xp from the ghouls and looting them for legendaries seems to be too much effort for the base owner so it‚Äôs alwys just a waste of time and xp for all of us when someone places their camp there
---
What platform 
---
I never stated you didn't have a desire to play the game. I repeated what you said, that you stopped playing. Forgive me tho, it's kinda common for people to come back boasting how they "stopped playing" and the game "is still bad as I left it", and that's sad.
---
But anyway, besides the drama. Is it hurting anybody that people want to see the game grow? It's definitely not sad tho that you see some reposts of things people really want to see. And only time will tell what's gonna be added. It's only been two months. If it was a year later and the game was still full of Atom Shop garbage and no new content I'd complain too.
---
&lt;3
---
I fully agree the perk cards system is half assed. There are many threads debating it already.
---
Removing perk swapping also mean removing rng perk gains every 5 levels imo.
---
Walk into Grafton Station to look for Combat Armor plans.
---
"Its Grafton Day.....Again!!"
---
*Sigh*
---
That's not the point though. My point is that TSE weapons will still be top tier weaponry compared to others.
---
Scorchedbeast rebalancing is an entirely different issue, and one I feel does need to be addressed.
---
makes the most sense for wade airport to have one, lol. So monongah's crossed out. Anyway, if this works that means you could have a fleet of 4 vertibirds. Alternatively, you could have a team of 4, each with their own vertibot, and that'd make defending the vertibot workshops easier while still being able to use 4 vertibots.
---
I have been using betterinventory since week 2 after launch and have not been banned yet. So I guess QoL mods are okay.
---
I've noticed the low levels seem to be getting a lot more daring recently I've had a group of three in their teens start with me and I'm 130 and they just didn't stop I killed them all about 4 times and changed server myself to get rid of them they were like mosquitoes just buzzing around me and not leaving me alone, doing similar damage as a mosquito too.
---
Yeah I know. I would sell them at most double what the value is. Which for stims would be around 80 if doubled I think. But when I sell plans and such, I usually go by value the game states it is. Unless it's a rare item or plan.
---
How is this a problem ? the more the merier
---
Why should many have to cater to one person? I leave for HIM, and then what? The next person comes along and he has to server hop too?
---
Using jet packs and sprinting at least in fallout 4 drains fusion cores
---
Heres an idea...dont destroy their shit.
---
Crazy! I know.
---
If we can build in whitesprings, we can build in white springs.
---
Some people like it because its the only spot with green grash that isnt overgrown, some like it because its right next to the vendors, enclave, and a train station for more vendors.
---
Some like it because its useful for farming and if they need a place with all the stations to repair weapons when farming there, they have their camp.
---
Hell there was someone who had a full camp with a decontamination and all the workshops just for farming during nukes so nobody had to use radaways, or walk to the otherside of whitesprings or even further for a certain station and were able to stash our new found loot away and trade there too.
---
Most bases at white springs i found are for farming yes, but they normally dont care who uses them.
---
Also as long as you hit a enemy, you get the xp when they drop dead.
---
So ultimately you destroy someones base because some shitty reason.
---
They‚Äôre fixed, 200% durability works now
---
Another commenter suggested that, which is why I added it to the description.
---
Only camps I appreciate people destroying 
---
üëä Wouldn't these wear out pretty quickly and potentially mess with lore and all that. The Fallout universe is rich enough without having to import fads. Already we have Fallout parallels to the classics, old film, literature, music... but with a Fallout spin. Like the Dunwich stories, the Fire Ants, the music vault etc. They already do this kind of thing but keep it tasteful, and refrain from band-wagoning anything popular. Just be rather observant and you'll find plenty of nods to cool stuff. 
---
They do increase durability, my weapons and armor are repaired to 200% of their base durability. Maybe you though they'll prolong the durability bar (the basic one), but that's not how it works.
---
Not really, they should just do things like in the other games, where you filter out bad words an that's about it. 
---
I never thought of that lol good thinking
---
Anything you stash or blueprint counts sadly 
---
so get it for free from the atom shop then?
---
üòè you know it
---
Could also replace the mod. I'm trying to find any other mod ATM lol
---
all mods are single use, that‚Äôs why i have two X-01 chest pieces and three power armor helmets taking up space in my stash, i only use specific mods and the others are too rare to be scrapped. the pieces are all taking up dozens of space in my stash only because i cant store them as mods which sucks with the limited storage space
---
How does it mount? This sounds interesting but also still super award.
---
100%, they're going against Sec 8 in ToS as it effects the gameplay of others... Seems extreme but it's still an issue and I wouldn't complain.
---
Sprinting uses both acton points and core energy right now, but the sprint distance is short. There is a perk to use less energy when sprinting, but it doesn't seem to affect sprint distance.
---
Thanks! But I craft right now same leather armor part with Armorer(3) and without and they have exactly same durability, not improved with perk.
---
I found a pretty good anti armor assault rifle that shreds SBs
---
That would be badass and perfect for people in the BoS faction. The problem with vertibots is that players shoot them down thinking they're the ones protecting the cargobot with the nuke keycard. Or they're just being an idiot and doing it on purpose. 
---
Happened to me when I had the Poseidon power plant.
---
Yes ADA from the automatron dlc. You could also customize her.
---
IRL Money bruh 
---
At least you won't be posting how it is a surprise then :)
---
I think having balanced legendarily effects is a good thing for the game, but, I am in the minority here.
---
Shotgun?
---
Absolutely not... So I kite 20-25 ghouls one way and some morons base (placed deliberately) starts popping off and pulls my Wendigo, my 3\*s and my legendaries in the completely wrong direction... and you want people to be fine about it?
---
It's placed there with full knowledge or the intent to cause an issue for others... Destroying it is 100% justified.
---
LOL
---
I was trying desperately to start pvp. And eventually I got more or less one shot by an explosive lever action rifle. I literally face tanked the queen without power armor, while firing every single shot at my own feet for max dps, yet I'm still essentially 1 shot by someone. Weird stuff. Good to experiment with. Lost 2k caps
---
15 charisma benefits:
---
-Better buy/sell prices at vendors.
---
-The ability to share rank 5 cards and below. You can share any card.
---
-Better group quest rewards.
---
I have a support character at level 83. I don't regret having 15 charisma, but it feels a bit like a novelty at times. 
---
Vendors max at 1400 caps per day. That's means you'll be reaching your cap limit with less items sold. Whether that's a good thing is up for debate. You can lower the prices of high cost items by a noticeable amount. One example is dropping the price of serums from 4800 to 3500 caps. There also seems to be a cap on how low you can lower the prices or perhaps a sharp diminishing return. 
---
Being able to share rank 5 cards is handy, but not essential. Unless you're the foreman of a crafting team you won't be sharing rank 5 gunsmith very often. More often then not you'll be sharing rank 4 bodyguard or rank 3 of rad sponge. If you need special points somewhere else you should be fine with 12 charisma. 
---
 The game states you get better group quest rewards, but from my experience this is hard to quantify. It's also kind of vague. Does this mean events or quest or both? Do they mean more caps or more items? My friends say they notice a difference but who knows. 
---
Charisma has great support cards. Even a dip of 3 points can give you some handy cards to share with your team. With 15 you'll be able to create load outs that will tend to every need your team could have. Healing teammates, curing rads, removing disease, restoring hunger and thirst, and raising defenses are all your wheelhouse. 
---
TL;DR - Get 15 if you want to be uber support, but 12 is all you really need to share anything you'd need to. Mo money less space. 
---
Unless you have kids in the background...
---
I was wondering that myself. I‚Äôve seen it a couple times but no where near as much as previously.
---
You really should consider fireproof with all that demomition expert.
---
True. Though that was also partly bevause there was onlx one server to begin with.
---
This is pretty amazing so far and I've only gotten about half way through! 
---
I‚Äôve done it like four times today lol. It‚Äôs still here.
---
it would be solved by resolving the fact that we have no custom emoting capability, an option that games with typing solve with simple differently colored typed message. we should have the ability to type very small pip grams using one letter at a time typing (or perhaps the length limit is good enough and on PC we can use the keyboard),, this is one of the UI / interaction suggestions in my official response to inside the vault's call for feedback
---
Crazy idea...maybe it was there before! So it wasnt place deliberately to fuck with you.
---
Instead you sound like your a whining bitch.
---
Fucken grown up world doesnt evolve around you. Learn to use that base to your advantage.
---
Fucken tardo. Really is it that hard to kill a few ghouls but OH NO A TURRET SHOOTS AT THEN ITS THE END OF THE WORLD! I LOST EVERYTHING! go join a different server then.
---
It doesnt take what....3 minutes?
---
You improve crafted item durability by raising you INT stat - the higher INT you have, the longer durability bar i'll get.
---
Yeah I gotta say, building a base there is one thing, but placing an array of turrets on one side facing the golf club.... that‚Äôs pretty obvious. I‚Äôll only do over a base there if it has impacted on my game. In which case.... it‚Äôs fair game!
---
i‚Äôve seen it on every now and then but stopped doing it a while ago so i havent been paying attention
---
Honestly it feels like they looked at Epic Games and saw them selling 20$ skins and thought hey they give free v-bucks and thats why people dump money into the game. All while forgetting the reason people dump money into the game is because the amount of free content one receives is larger than the percieved value of not buying a 20$ skin.
---
Now you got fallout that is not f2p and does not add free content and wants fortnite monetization strategy. 
---
Thanks, now i'm sure repairing durability work. But on my example above, creating durability doesn't work for me. White lines on wellow line are the same.
---
I saw it today too. I‚Äôve been server hopping all day and usually I see it more. Maybe bad timing, who knows.
---
are u absolutely CERTAIN that it's plugged in?
---
Sounds like a good idea, I didnt even think to compare my prices to the ingame traders lol, thanks for the input, ill update the sheet now
---
If you can keep up the supply the demand is definitely there for those items at those prices 
---
But  [Armorer](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Armorer) (lvl 3) says "3 - Your crafted armor has improved durability. " But its not when equipped
---
If you're planning on lowering your HP with radiations, goulish and radicool are very nice.
---
Does this game‚Äôs perks work at all?
---
Hold up, you seem a little salty so I'll as this... Is your CAMP in Whitesprings and did someone just level it around 15 minutes ago?
---
If so, you should move it, be more considerate and you owe me 5.56.
---
if this were to be driven fully by player decisions - IE a group of players selects where to go and what will be made there, effectively creating a hub construction interface and method of progressing something besides just our individual character levels, it will be an amazing experience.
---
Nope. Twin lakes. Not even playing 76 currently. Playing let it die instead because my xbox needed to update.
---
Yeah defs bad timing. I‚Äôve been lucky recently. But haven‚Äôt gotten anything valuable yet from
---
It unfortunately.
---
Have you considered the call-centre type headset, instead of gamer headsets?
---
They're lighter, don't warm your ears as much, and are designed to be worn for hours.
---
And they're usually less than $10...
---
I just love single-ear lightweight headsets for gaming...
---
At level 110 I am strongly considering taking a break from the game until this feature has been put in. It is no fun running a nike silo, getting to the zone for the game to lock up 10 minutes in and have no way to get back to the server.
---
I've got E macrod to spam the key at certain intervals while I hold the key. I usually craft 10 things at a time to make sure to not get the server disconnect message. 
---
Awesome
---
you are using the wrong perk card, find the one that actually saying repairing 200% on it. also higher int also effects +durability if you dont use the 200% card, i repair stuff to 150% with like 10 int

What argument? You are factually correct, which is why i edited my post. You pointed this out in the internet equivalent of screaming right into my face, spittle drooling, though. The only thing missing out were multiple exclamation mark.

Stop behaving like your username, and people might listen to you. It is not an "attack" if i just point out your behaviour.

I am on Whitesprings South of the golf club. No turrets here just good eats. Making a bistro. A Scorchbistro if you will.

# Mission Accomplished
---
Thank you! That was the kind of explanation I was looking for. (Commenting to bookmark this haha) The only major 5rank perk worth sharing during battle I can come up with is the one that increases explosive damage, and then only if your team will use explosive weapons (legendary or otherwise, even post next patch)
---
Obviously not. But are we sure its a bug? I dimly remember a loading screen tip telling me that you can either double the duration or the effect with repeated bobblehead uses...
---
Which wouldnt be a problem if people hadnt duped explosive bobbleheads.
---
Golf course is shit anymore. Most the enemies are under 50 and so's the loot they drop. Only really great time to go there is during the nuke. Would you agree ?
---
It's what the internet looks like, more to the point.
---
Here's  my previous build, you can see the light and dark floors in there.

---
Just stand in front of mine and server hop until you find server with free spot for event and you trigger it.
---
I think that the quest objectives wouldn't be identical, such as the reactor malfunction. Even just making these different for each Silo would be great. Even better if the objectives change from time to time so there is some variety and challenge.

Crafting has nothing to do with repair. It boosts the initial durability of the item when you make it. It has no effect on repair. You need ‚ÄúFix it Good‚Äù for that.

Thus started the arms race of the Second Great War in Appalachia. Raiders, Brothers, and Responders battling for control of who can blow up each other more.
---
You are very welcome. 
---
I agree, you can get by without sharing any of the rank 5 cards. Explosives expert is a stand out but my team requests Bodyguard most of the time. 
---
If you have any other questions let me know. 
---
This is why I love the nerf, I never used a TSE, didn't see a point tbh. Once everything is one shot there's no challenge, no more fun.
---
Really?? Thats how it works? So if theres only a couple events on the go, i can fly to a spot and it'll trigger?
---
I came across one guy with a blunt of 700 caps (got change to 350 when I got there) because he destroyed a players camp, once I took him down a few other players spawned in the area most likely seeking the bounty so I agree with your advice, stay in a area where you use the surroundings to your advantage.
---
yeah interesting, a small board for the people logged in to that world to say -
---
who wants to go do the X ? \_
---
I have serums for sale \_
---
Getting rid of extra ammo and junk I can't sell but don't want to hold till next days sell resets \_
---
WIth a button next to each one to join the team of that player so they can fast travel to the camp or player
---
I didnt talk about repairing in that post. I talk about creating durability for new item with Armorer perk
---
Nice thanks for the info. Going to start grinding events and checking vendors for the heavy combat armor plans.
---
not convinced
---
There is always one server to begin with... QTF had lots of servers. They worked well, you got to know players that frequent. I can't wait until private servers. Give the sense of community back to the players.
---
I might be weird but I will often play in total silence while my wife and I talk or while she reads a book in my general vicinity. Love to team up for bonus xp and stats but if I have to be rude (not talk to) some random internet person or my wife... sorry lol
---
 But it does make me feel like a dick a bit when people leave after I haven‚Äôt spoken to the for a while
---
I saw a duper camped there once.  Felt nice seeing his place wiped out when the bomb fell. 
---
That is becouse stacked boobleheads, not TSE.
---
Nope. You are wrong.
---
So you admit you are wrong. Nice. I win. You lose.
---
People who pay money for this game are gonna play as they want. And they actually have the right to do so also. You or i may not agree all the time but fact is people have the right to
---
Doesn‚Äôt work when they set up in a nuke zone. 
---
You can only get the max your hopper can store, but it will fill up quicker. Workshops that have a Food or Water resource and a number is how much MORE they can produce per hour beyond the regular proc rate.
---
Or a load system would work too for perk cards. Where your able to change every perk card you have equipped. From melee to big guns for example. Or farming. Or adventure(lockpick and hacking with scavanger skills and such) and so on that you can customize and change all your perks on the fly.
---
Or just give us perk loadouts...
---
I have better luck in Watago with the robots. Lot of low levels running around there getting attacked because they haven't done Mayor for a Day so the grind is almost helpful. 
---
Where else ya got ? 
---
This is also incorrect. Food is how many plants are provided by the workshop, inside the inventory. Whereas, water is the number of purifiers you can freely build using the workshop's own materials.
---
I understand that. But why you all talk about repairing if we close that question. Now i'm interested about Crafting (not repairing) perk durability -  [Power Smith](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Power_Smith) (3lvl) and [Armorer](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Armorer) (3 lvl). It must improve durability for new item but its not
---
Lol didn't know it was my job to convince you about a bug that's been reported elsewhere 
---
Ahh, I misunderstood your title and thought you meant events relating to American history and such, like 3 and 4 did in a lot of their quests. Personally I think it would be a lot of fun to stage some civil war reenactments or something as part of a quest that can encourage competition and teamwork.
---
I like the meeting event idea! I'm not sure how many people would be in to it but I think it would be pretty neat
---
And how about permanent slots for when using a work bench or crafting, and when at your camp. 
---
What a scam ... i farmed 3 so far with my level 15 alt and it dosnt take long to get one. Only morons pay more than 1000 caps for it.
---
Nice, thanks for your confirmation!
---
Or just buy a mic, it's 2019. These things have existence for like 50 years now.
---
It's hard to give up all of that carry weight
---
I wear the targeting hud on my xo1 helmet and I always crash mostly in nuke zones when there are a lot of enemies I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs connected tho as I crashed a lot before I got the hud
---
\+600hrs, I've been killed dozens of times, camps been nuked, orb striked, and razed... At no point have I ever felt griefed. The game esures the "victim" has plenty of time stash their stuff, decide what their going to do, and act on it. Players will do what they do, why must some of us cry so hard over our sand castle being toppled?
---
 I like how simple and obvious griefing is defined with its intent. Unfortunately the community is used to being omnipotent quicksave gods so any inconvenience or player attack quickly makes them sad/confused thus they interpret it as being griefed.
---
The intent of most pvp is not to make someone sad it's just looking for a scrap.
---
i use the left in-ear bud from my cellphone, only sound that goes through it is voice and my speakers do the rest.
---
When good games are made things like this happen among the players, quite inevitably! 
---
The way this game is really good is a little secret.
---
Didn't realize this! I have 3 points free in luck now. Are there other perks not working?
---
As far as we know their locking the accounts of players that went there first. But in my Brotherhood clan they're deleted everything that could have been obtained / duped from there. Paladin paint job, hunter headpiece, marine helmet...

Can't unlearn a recipe, true, but I wouldn't be advertising anything coming from the room if I were in your shoes atm ;)

4) Issue 1: Since the last update the loading between areas and the login takes longer (between areas about double, also showing 2 pictures, and login in took me about 4 minutes yesterday, sometimes its shorter but never less then 3 pictures)
---
Issue 2: The second quest from Rose (Flavors of Mayhem) keeps disappearing from my quest list. Every time i startup i recieve ‚Äúroses syringer‚Äù and if i use it the quest checkpoints and appears again till the time i logout. When i restart the quest is missing and i recieve the syringer again. The syringer is not double in my inventory. When making the explosive bait the (the next step) the quest doesnt pick up again. Tonight i‚Äôs try syringing something else hoping the quest wil pickup again. I had the same issue with the last part of ‚Äúinto the fire‚Äù where i spoke to the robot at belching betty in one session and in a later session (got drawn to an event) neither the quest or robot appeared. Strangely the day after it came back but unfortunately this doesnt work for Flavors of Mayhem.
---
Issue 3: This might not be a real issue more an annoyence but the whitespring resort is often stacked with high level players thus high level enemies. For me, a level 20- 25 player, being confronted with hordes of level 65-70 ferals or wolves is a real problem when trying to obtain quest items located in that region. I‚Äôm not sure why the high level players keep coming to the whitespring but in the last week i havent seen a day go by they were not there. 
---
I also have some suggestions
---
Suggestion 1: ammo breakdown ‚Äì since you cant sell ammo anymore i have stockpiles of bullets for low-level weapons that are useless. Being able to re-use that would be nice
---
Suggestion 2: being able to sell plans ‚Äì pretty much the same as above, plans become useless when you already have them so being able to sell them would be great
---
Suggestion 3: quests with several solutions ‚Äì i‚Äôm not sure if this is just my perspective but is miss the quests that can be solved in different ways. Like going down a pacifist route in FO NV it would be nice to have other options than shooting the hell out of things. Looking back i think a lot of those options are dialog triggered, but with override codes for robots, items like the ghoul mask or bait to lure creatures away could be done i think. It would make the gameplay a bit less linear. 
---
Have you ever tamed an animal ?
---
Yeah thas how it works from my experience, Events are only around where players are. When i had camp near Blackwater mine, i had uranium fever triggered lots of time when i loged in game. But sometimes it dont work, when i needed to do that lighthouse event, i was not able to trigger it. So maybe there can be only exact number of events at one time, or they have cooldown, or something, but maily u need someone to be there to trigger it.
---
Very cool.
---
This would be solved by the ability to place found items into camps! It is one of the main suggestions I placed into my official feedback response to the call they put out on Inside the vault! 
---
Fair enough.
---
Wouldn't know, not a console player anymore. 
---
Sorry.
---
üòÇüòÇhad a lvl 10 try to start something with me too at my camp in the mire. I asked him as he's punching me what are you doing in this area lol it's not a place for your lvl
---
Yep, I've a feeling the reason for the oneshotting are VATs Crits. There's currently no way to avoid or mitigate the crit multiplier so those are always a threat if they're stored up. Best advice I can give is to not underestimate anyone. Get the drop on them by any means.
---
Unless they're in Power Armor and provided you're able to deal out good rads damage, it's a good way to deter or win battles of attrition. They'll burn through their Radaway and what not, the rads damage making them easier to kill if they don't heal.
---
One thing I do recommend are cryo grenades and mines.  Even without investment, the slow down effect is useful for blitzing them if you can proc it on them.
---
They could focus on pve quests and event than pvp
---
Sorry, I keep reading this and don‚Äôt know what you mean. My bad, can you please explain?
---
I cannot concur. From my experience not only that adds up instead of multiplication, but adds up in a strange way.
---
It might be that even order in which you apply gear and perks might affect end result.
---
Same here. Never seen anything other than the walking cane. 
---
This. Some people seem to think the only alternative is some freaking helmet.
---
Wait the HUD causes problemsü§îwell shit kinda chalked it up the servers cause it's been crashing alot more since I had it
---
Dibbydodo228
---
My issue is when sometimes loading in or fast traveling my character just freezes up. Can't move or use my pipboy but can only look at the map. I know other people are experiencing this issue too. I have seen some threads with similar problems.
---
They won't add that. That makes the game playable. Same as fixing the Scorchbeasts attacks that freeze some people's games up. All these bugs are left in I think to add extra "difficulty" to make the game seem longer than it is.
---
And I say this as someone who enjoyed my playtime immensely, I can just see the ship is sinking.
---
Lol, I‚Äôll swap you a duped shovel 
---
Battlefield usually is
---
Final Fantasy
---
Metal Gear Solid
---
Just to name a few...
---
Plus some mods that spawn new dynamic surprises, or add interesting npcs, its a world that keeps on giving. Without having to wait for the content.
---
Choosing between FO4 (2,000 hours) and 76 (200 hours), FO4 keeps wining my time as I "care" more about that world.
---
Because I can.
---
I've always wanted to nuke Harpers, I bet it'd be great since the narrower streets would be a bottleneck for all the concentrated spawns.
---
There‚Äôs also a trash can put back full of....  trash. Most of which is plastic. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôd hate to see how much they would reduce perception because of the beak sticking off the front of it. 
---
It seemed like it was alright if I put the helmet on after a little bit, but first time I fast travelled I crashed. I'm guessing it's something to do with loading. I already replaced it. 
---
I like the floors. 
---
 I mean, I get it's a multiplayer game. 
---
  \-- Are you certain?!
---
Kill people
---
If we‚Äôre going to do permanent cards, then allow weight reducing effects for those cards to apply to the stash as well. 
---
Doh.
---
They try to ruin other people playing, I ruin theirs, it is the circle of life.
---
Try being a dev
---
There's a post somewhere on here detailing the bug. It seemed like a recent patch caused the bug. Idk I've replaced the mod game is fine now
---
That's what I'm told.
---
Harpers would be cool. Want to see someone hit Solomons lower Lake with the Behemoth or the other one that spawns near Bogtown. 
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs kinda crazy how it auto-scraps mods. How in the hell did they even think anyone wanted that to happen? Especially given the scarcity of some mods. 
---
There's no way it's additive unless there's a cap on damage reduction.
---
If it were additive, I'd have a 135% damage reduction against Melee and Explosives meaning I wouldn't take damage at all. Which certainly isn't the case. 
---
It'd make way more sense if it were multiplicative and without a cap because I've built my resistances gradually and each addition I've seen has shown improvements, yet I'm still able to take damage.
---
there was a patch note saying they were gonna spawn less
---
Find a suitable location and make a home. 
---
Ha try a 247% damage hit. That's what you will lose with the TSE nerf. These weapons are going to not be worth keeping and no one's going to buy them after this nerf. They are making them 110% useless. And breaking gun builds in the process. 
---
Being an alcoholic IRL won't get rid of the pain you suffer in-game.
---
because it's hard to recover loot if I am running around fighting (like if it despawns, gets blown away, or i just lose track and there is no tech / card yet to let Get your loot markers be spawned at corpses like they do when our death bag is working correctly)  I already kind of try to fight in a way that gives me a moment to loot everything fast and continue the battle

Now we‚Äôre duping shovels?  This is getting out of hand.  Before long people will be duping asbestos. 
---
I did use the mod a lot but it looked massive in 1st person which bothered me, great selection of mods on it though. But yeah we definitely need new weapons seeing as majority of them were in 4 anyway. 
---
So....the mod doesn't get you banned?
---
*Proceeds to dupe rolling pins*
---
Now all the comments make sense lol thanks.
---
that;s just what that vendor sells
---
"If we can build in whitespring we can build in whitespring"....if i can camp you and destroy your base I'm going to camp you and destroy your base.
---
You can put your base anywhere else on the course , still enjoy the nice flat grassy areas WITHOUT interfering with the club house and or spawns.
---
The place gets laggy enough without having to suffer your crappy build eating up resources to render and load, then your turrets trying to tag everything and cause even more lag.
---
One thing I've never quite understood is why people (like you it seems) get hurt in the butt when there digital pixel made base gets "destroyed" its off no consequence really, you have to server hop to have it rebuilt no big deal really. 
---
Hope that's not your base i just totalled over on the course though as you might need a little more lube ;)
---
The Hecate was nice to be fair, loved going Quarry Junction once I'd hit level 50 and one shotting deathclaws away in slow motion with explosive rounds
---
I don't advertise, I don't selling (crafting) it for other players, just saying it exist...
---
I build just outside the Whitesprings area, overlooking the driving range. I'm just out of the way enough to not attract any ghoul attention.I do occasionally have a squirrel or rabbit in my house, But never any real mobs. Recently built an artillery cannon I use it to fuck over camps built out behind the golf club and anything that spawns on the driving range, but now the squirrels die after entering my camp boundaries.
---
For me at least the whole point of building in the Whitsprings is to have a robot army and not need to put up turrets.
---
how about bigger butts for ourselves and different body shapes, also how about I can be a super mutant ?
---
Literally saw it today lol
---
PS4? 
---
K then. My bad! 
---
Mind = Blown
---
I cant believe I never thought of having multiple armor pieces for mods before! I have an X01 jetpack but sometimes I want to use the reflection or stealthboy mod but the jetpack is such a pain to find that I didnt want to scrap it so I always just left it.
---
You good sir are my hero for the day, now I need to go and do some Enclave bunker server hoping to find some mods!
---
My bad, XB1
---
And the fact you can rechamber in for 50 CAL lmao
---
Wow, cant believe its there and not in game settings,,,
---
Ive been stuck in Japanese since launch. Thanks mate.
---
It sucks now i have one good melee weapon thats it and i dont want that to disappear next. And im level 113.
---
good lady* thank you very much, also consider getting multiple frames because one whole frame weights half of an X-01 chest piece, even less than half in total with other pieces stored on it :) i keep them separate because of we cant rename the damn frames but i‚Äôm gonna have to get some sooner or later
---
I remember demolishing this line of turrets some guy placed right outside the golf club.
---
I built up a nice little bounty in the process and killed the guy when he came and attacked. 
---
A few others came over and saw it and I thought to myself I'd probably get ganged up on.
---
Nope. They thumbs up'd and went back inside to farm.
---
Moral of the Story: You're not a douche for destroying these kinds of camps, you're apparently doing a public service.
---
Not to my understanding, and the Community Managers have been very candid about what they tend to flag as suspicious, mods that access active memory such as the Pick Lock Cheat UI mod, are ones to avoid.  The closest that we've seen so far to an active memory-access mod that might have been questionable, was the Known Plans Mod, and I understand that they are aware of that one, and find it acceptable.  But for our purposes, the Text Chat mod has not had any problems that I know of with any flagging for bans.  It still won't get any official BGS support, but it's not a banning-flag.
---
Depends how you're trying to define good. If value wise probably worth ~250 harpoon ~500 shotgun. Otherwise it's not a bad perk. You'll be hitting things multiple times with either so just gets more powerful as u go.
---
The new meta for the queen will be the Prime weapons, the way it should be. Bonus points for a Zealot's Prime whatever.

I sure hope they see it and I hope we get it with this exact title in the description

Let's make trading using caps steamlined so if we want to add caps we type it and otherwise we just select Approve and proceed with trade without having to interact with so many prompts. Fallout 1 barter is the prime model for how it should be, this is part of my UI/interaction section of my response to the inside the vault call for feedback
---
‚ÄúDurability and ‚ÄúCondition‚Äù are two different things:
---
* ‚ÄúDurability‚Äù is like maximum hit points.  It is the outside outline.  It is determined only once, when the item appears the first time.
---
  * For crafted items: INT determines initial Durability.  ‚ÄúArmorer 3‚Äù and ‚ÄúPower Smith 3‚Äù and ‚ÄúScience Master 2‚Äù help
---
  * For found items: LCK determines Durability
---
  * Durability never changes.
---
* ‚ÄúCondition‚Äù is like current hit points.  It is the filling inside Durability.  It can fill above 100%, so it fills up Durability even more with a brighter bar.
---
  * For crafted items: INT determines initial Condition
---
  * For found items: LCK determines initial Condition
---
  * When repairing, ‚ÄúFix it Good‚Äù and ‚ÄúWeapon Artisan‚Äù and Durability determine new Condition
---
Nah, mole miners are a fairly common spawn there, along with scorched or super mutants. Not had any mobs other than those spawn in the place though. 
---
There are several people on that lake üòñüòñüòñ
---
Good to know. Have a group of RPers too...altho not Unstoppables related. Thanks for the insight tho. Good luck with recruitment!
---
this would be solved somewhat by a social groups tool for the next level up beyond friend list, granted teams right now are made for perk sharing and are limited to 4 for that reason (if there are any other reasons for the limit I can't think of them), I regularly run with groups that have 9-12 people logged on and we have to make teams and then turn voice mode to area so we all can voice. 
---
THis is part of my official feedback response to the call put out on inside the vault.
---
I always keep my eyes peeled for that one and if you don‚Äôt get there early enough you don‚Äôt get all 3 legendaries
---
You get this plan for the first time you kill the queen. The generator plans are earned from powering up the power plants. You get one plan you don't have have when you complete the event. 
---
on pc you jsut have to set audio mode to Area, unless you all already using a discord or similar to be on a voice together. i think we need a social tool for joining  world together and traveling to each other that is a little more tool rich than the one to one friending
---
NO SPIDERS !!! 
---
I have arachnophobia in real life and spiders can and do stop me from playing videogames, if a giant rad spider climbs down from a celling or pops out in the bog somewhere, I will stop playing this game.

Atom store space suit helmet is also a no per loss gas mask.

That's perfect thank you.

I knew they were decent because Furious usually is but was just wondering prices.

Ended up with quite a few 1 star bits last night think I might have the odd 2 star but I wanna put a list together when im back from work and sell some stuff.

Why are we always told to jump servers when someone is destroying our camp or following us around griefing, grow up and accept the fact the game does not revolve around you.  Boohoo i dont get to get a piece of every mob oh no, maybe get some skill and kill them inside the golf club like i do no turrets in there
---
Lol ye they getting brave, had 4 lvl 20-50, couple with tse,  start trying to grief me. Im 275 and walked away with ALL their caps. Dont fuck with muh hammer loool it makes Thor jealous üòÇüòÇ
---
Honey Radger don't care.  
---
This is great.
---
1. PC (high tier gaming)
---
2. tixed
---
3. Can provide if needed, can't easily predict when it happens though to help reproduce it. Definitely happens more indoors.
---
4. Getting stuck and can't move, especially in power armor and indoors. Can spin on place, can jump, but can't move from that point as if my WASD isn't working at all. Sometimes become unstuck if there are corpses/containers nearby and I can get the loot floating menu up - maybe it's connected to disabling some controls while floating menu is active. Never had this one before the january patch.
---
I am new player. 20lvl no idea about builds and stuff. Haven¬¥t even tried pvp yet but I am interested in company. 
---
name: Inchiladas
---
yeah this is gonna be extremely awesome once there is a system for groups to level up a brand/faction and associated base! will make sense to have an app that gives some functionality and maybe even inventory (allowing us to extend as a quartermaster beyond just the situation of logging in to one character to do that for players in our group)
---
Good luck! Drop them in a station otherwise if the markets soft. Someone would be happy to find em
---
I'm in on this.
---
Hell I'd be happy with the original style 
---
Haha they must have thought "he's 275 we are 4 50's that's 200 so we must stand a chance" and then all their hopes and dreams came crashing down.
---
you mean the stuff where you have to farm for ultracite anytime you want to fire the gun? no, thanks. removed the mod as soon as I had it installed.
---
I didn't even travel yesterday, just charged me the caps and kept me where I was, check the map and event is over
---
Area is a Console option as well but comes with its issues especially when fast traveling.  I use discord for pc games but the common denominator between my various rl friends and family is PS4 so that‚Äôs where I play 76.
---
Was pretty funny. They all had mics XD
---
"After the event finishes it becomes a permanent addition to the game."
---
This need to be implemented. The concept of rebuild america needs this in the game. We are not making any difference in the game so far.
---
Even better
---
that was exactly my plan! i never mind giving things away because i know how good it feels to be gifted something. I just wanted to try get caps to buy what I want instead of farming the hell out of the game.
---
I know we have the PvP emotes, but can we get a "Kill me" emote for when you just want rid of a wanted level?
---
We have "Trading" but specific ones for Ammo, Chems, Armour, Guns...
---
also can we get:
---
"There is a Deathclaw behind you"
---
"Legendary enemy HERE"
---
"Free Stuff HERE"
---
Do you mean the amusingly named ‚Äònosegay‚Äô? 
---
My house has 3 fusion core sources withing about 2 minutes walk of each other. 
---
Really? I've always seen it free! 
---
my wish list is one thing, small pip grams so can emote things about as short as any of those utility sentences you just put down for examples.
---
custom emoting needs to exist in games that have social interaction
---
i dont care if we never have text chatting, we need very short emote grams that we can display to players we have come across
---
I‚Äôm getting the triple load screens too, and worst disconnects since beta
---
Walking distance east of the top of the world are several good rivers in the savage divide, some very quiet, the only enemies I encounter are rats coming after my corn, but I also see passive chickens, brahmin and frogs. pretty central on the map so I find it the perfect place
---
Gun fu works like a charm thankfully.
---
Me and my fried have a ghoul farming camp right there but we are both over level 80.
---
I think they should slowly start adding NPCs in different areas. Like make a small camp for each faction and have them start giving quests to expand their hold on WV. 
---
'Do u no de way, de way to grammar'
---
I think its when someone else has or is clearing our the camp it selects for you. I parked this quest to work on a side quest or two then went to go back to it and the previously shown marker had gone.
---
Quick server hop sorted it out though :)
---
Cool, I would like to see base leveling as a more indepth permanent kind of camp tool for groups of players (or maybe a really ambitious trader type player with multiple of their own characters) and i think the workshop interface and locations already presents a really compelling setting in which those groups could stake their claim! nice thinking!
---
Lone are they not able to just give us text chat like the mod that one author made by himself?. The thing is amazing and useful as hell if you don't want to talk to others via mics outside of your clan. Or if your partially deaf like myself as well...
---
Well shit guess after work got to look for something to replace it lol
---
It's crazy how they haven't added more. The ones they have don't communicate anything new.
---
There's a great mod that lets you hot key perk loadouts, LET US USE MODS
---
I'm sincerely asking here, not trying to attack you ‚Äî why did you buy a forced online game that doesn't allow you to not run into other people if you want a quiet moment to yourself in a game?
---
The windmills have a nice look about them. For real power you'll want the nuclear reactor. 
---
If you need plans, you'll get them from power up events at power plants. You might have to server hop a few times until you get a feel for the plant. You should get generator plans as a reward for completing the event. 
---
Same for me. Not so much for the disconnects.. But the double/triple load screens are odd. Only noticed them since the last update.
---
Pretty sure the load screen about bobbles specifically says the effects *don't* stack, and using one again just refreshes the duration.
---
I think it broke, because i saw it repeatedly trying to spawn in unsual places instead of the appropriate mine... and then the lack of it. like it was on the map near the firestation once and another time somewhere in the mire
---
i think it's just supposed to be blackwater mine, right?
---
They need to get rid of the nerf on TS leave it be and cut explosive by 40% with a smaller splash area. Would make fireproof make explosive damage minimal at best in PvP and would leave gun builds playable. People don't realize how bad this hits all gun builds. Instead of a 350% damage boost you will now have a 63% damage boost. Sure explosive needed a nerf yes but not this much and TS did not as it is the only thing that makes guns viable. The other option is make player to player damage only 10-20% of normal damage possibly even have an entire second set of damage numbers for PvP combat. Also removing stackable bobbles and mags as that makes no sense in the first place and is the real root of the problem. The nerf they are putting into effect claims to be done for PvP reasons when all it actually does is pass the 1 shot down to the next build as there are many other builds capable of the same thing. Not to mention its going to completely kill pve in the process. Better get those queen kills in now guy or you won't get them in. Unless you get 19 of your closest friends on the same server and make sure they all are running a high end build with high end gear fully optimized.

Description of the issue (what happened, where did it occur, what did it affect, quest name etc.)
---
Every time I get inside any of my power armor it just unequip some of its parts and I have to equip them again manually each time. 
---
ok understood. Thanks.
---
Why would he not care about all the bugs and server issues? Everyone I know who bought this game has since stopped playing because you literally cant play the game for extended sessions without experiencing a disconnect quest rollback, or some other bullshit bug. 
---
It's a game if roulette even logging in after booting up for the first time!
---
Except that it's notoriously raider territory. 
---
how do you use vertibot grenade? every time i've ever tried calling the vertibot when situations grow sticky it just says no vertibots are available to respond
---
Duel wielding in general is missing just give us the Skyrim version of it atleast.
---
They should remove the ability to build in Whitesprings. I know that would be annoying as flat ground is so hard to find in this game, but the turret farms aren‚Äôt going to stop. Lore wise it makes no sense that we can build there either, as the robots don‚Äôt allow new guests on hotel land. 
---
For theorizing, consider if you want to get a set of Unyielding armor (with five pieces, +15 to all special stats besides endurance, but only when at very low health).  Search keywords ‚Äúrad rage‚Äù.
---
I assume for charisma that would not affect what perks you can share, but would affect buy/sell prices.  Would it affect these mysterious group rewards?
---
Just check ebay... there are hundreds of $ offers.
---
      
---
Bethesda should actively sue those people because it's getting ridiculous. Banning is not enought imo.
---
Honest question? Is this your first online game, cause welcome to the grind! Most Online games have an "endgame" that is only for the top 10% of players, and will be to hard for everyone else. This games just been broken in that a "TSE" just killed everything and everything. Your not supposed to be one or two-hitting everything but the final boss. 
---
They gave a us a special class of weapons just for Scorched enemies, and intend for us to user them.
---
I like building with 1-3 for the builds that don't use the stimpack team healing function, 6 or 9 if i am gonna be doing the healing, you can still get good things like rad sponge, quack surgeon, healing hands, or suppressor or tenderizer, very handy. 
---
also i found i can share higher cards when my charisma ramps up with unyielding armor, so my high rad high mutated character does some extra support from time to time
---
Would love to join. Ign is themiskats. I have a lvl 130something rifle - crafter main build and a lvl 10something secondary character (still undecided on the build). Always on pacifist, love to trade and to share items. I have a lot of plans i am looking to give away to deserving people. I dont min-max, i like hybrid builds. My goal: to someday own all the plans so i can craft items for friends and nice people in general. See ya in game folks!
---
I'm still not convinced it'll ruin TSE. It may make them less like a Mk19 40mm than the... Well.... Mk19 40mm in the game but useless? We shall see. It is still doing 20% over base and have an area effect. It may no longer be THE  weapon for the SBQ but for mobs? I think it'll still bring the pain.
---
I love my TSE  Gattling but being able to clear out the golf club club house myself, with like 350 rounds left over in my mag was always a little OP.
---
Heck I could ruin the mobs, even legendary scorched variants in the SBQ battles single handedly and let everyone else do damage to the SBQ. I'm sure that wasn't right. 
---
Got nothing except those I mention before, nothing in stored tab either 
---
Thanks :) 
---
Then why do I have 56% , doesn't make any sense 
---
when i built workstation in my friend's camp, we were on a team, it never seemed to carry over when he moved it, like i spent resources to make the stuff and then never saw them again the next times we played, the stuff he built is the only stuff that stayed
---
The text chat mod is truly amazing and i reccomend it to everyone on pc. 
---
Don't have anything there 
---
Nope :O
---
I'd be happy if it didn't target friendlies too.
---
And Xbox while you are at it lol
---
I don't find it difficult to farm ghouls when there is a camp there... If anything I like when people have the camps there for the scrap bench. Usually I pull the ghouls out the front door so the camp doesn't effect me, but if I do go out back then the turrets usually just draw some of the aggro off of me and it makes it easier. I don't get why people are complaining, I think they are just bitter because it allows players to level up easily. 
---
Also, nobody cares if you blow up their camp because it just makes you wanted and an easy one shot kill. It's Not like it's difficult to rebuild the camp. 
---
Both of these suggestions are a must!.
---
Help others man i just spent 5 hours helping others. That was my entire day if 76 and it was really fun.
---
I don't mic either.  Most of the time I just overhear inane annoying chatter when moving past groups.  I say cut off ALL mics in the public arena.  Only allow it when specifically turned on.  Like for teams or PVP.
---
Problem is that the atom store would take a hit so they wouldn't allow you to paint armor parts without buying them.  
---
Once again the just cosmetic argument comes in.  Cosmetics do affect gameplay.  You have more fun with a character that has been customized.  But on the other side of the coin, Bethesda needs to make money as this is a live service.  Cosmetics is the best way to fund future updates and dlc.
---
Only issue is, the game is playing catch up due to being released in an unfinished state.   There are so many bugs and problems with the engine that I'm not very optimistic that is will ever be in a good place.  Most fixes already are bare minimum of effort and do not address problems at a whole.
---
I see the paint can suggestion a lot.  It would be nice to have a base paint. i.e Red, blue, yellow, green, black etc.  Then have atom store modifiers like smooth, decals, stripes etc.
---
They have to make money.  They aren't a charity.  The devs seem to be trying and I feel for them.  The marketing team seems to be the ones out of touch.  
---
The wording on the title screen of theme releases are cringy and do not make much sense.  It's as if English isn't their mother tongue.  Whoever is in charge of the release dates, communication and also pricing needs to do some market research...and a bit of competitive analysis.  Prices are too high and they will make more money lowering them. 
---
Thanks! But I really still dont understand why my crafting armors parts has same durability with and without Armorer3. Is it still bugged?
---
However I see here that   Fix it Good and Weapon Artisan works fine now. 
---
No.you cannot have both. both two shot is better to me.
---
Dude first rule of fight club!
---
crashing a lot when i fast travel to camp or try to respawn, sometimes when fast traveling to my workshops or just points i like to travel to like in watogo and near whitespring.
---
but the worst crash was xbox update crashing at 1.39 gb and now its in an unusual looking way of updating that has something called Disc with like 550 MB of 550 MB and the Network: with like 240 MB of 50.1 GB
---
Near your level and also found exactly one. It sat in my chest forever until I found a better legendary black powder which now sits in my chest. 
---
A half-mask respirator that just covers nose and mouth would be cool. Like the kind worn by Division agents. 
---
"Come human, I have a trap for you" in a sweet-brute voice, is what I consider the pinnacle of Super Mutant ability to develop an intrigue, was something I laughed for few minutes then thought about for few hours. Replacing the word "surprise" from the cliche sentence with a "trap" was just genius piece of enemy design. 10/10
---
Really? Where do i turn to? The beth site?don't need the link but a direction would be nice.
---
exactly. And the stacked bobbleheads will still not be patched.
---
I'm there and going to be moving soon. I've found many times my camp can't load because someone is there.. found one of the camps yesterday. But it happens OFTEN. üòïüòïüòï
---
What?  That's exactly what would work in that situation.  It would be an emote, not an automatic setting
---
If your on pc come join us on text chat mod man.  Its truly amazing and its a game changer. Its made by a single author and its truly amazing. Global chat, trade chat , local , clans ( Yes it lets you create your own clans).
---
Agree, but via building mode
---
100% agreee
---
I've seen a Cargobot guarded by like 3 Vertibots, so it's not like the game can't handle that many at once.
---
Curious myself now, but I can't test it.
---
Ok. What a stupid idea. Just do you can save a few caps. 
---
The loading times in general are infuriating..
---
no body got time fo that!
---
it would also be nice to be able to return someone else's loot. It would be easier if he had a stolen tag.
---
The canned stew from the event has a 5% xp boost on the cans but the cans expire when you leave world. It was great because any time that event popped, everyone got a little xp buff.
---
Saw it twice yesterday but missed one to server crash
---
So someone nuked prime. Go there it has the cloud but when you go inside it's not a nuke zone. No SBQ. No nuked flora. Everything is just normal. Fine. Do some vendor runs. Fast travel to Harpers Ferry. Screen is completely black. I try to be positive about this game but FFS.
---
&gt;Who find ebay? The dupers already have. 
---
Hmmm yeah....
---
People who have duped, sold for money, then got their accounts banned, might actually not need to convince random people to sell their highly desired gear for real money. Plus random people might try to get the these new accounts banned too. People who already sell for money, are far more reliable.
---
i finally moved a bit further north in the forest myself.  traded in my copper vein for water access, and sutton train station is just over the hill
---
Omg no. I don‚Äôt want a second box every time i scrap a weapon or armor.
---
Just. Don‚Äôt scrap/lock option is needed.
---
Same for me, I build on the nothwest green so I dont have to use as many turrets. 
---
Ive also noticed it spawns more on the NA times.
---
&gt; They had plans stashed in various containers 
---
Was their CAMP built around an area with existing containers or how did they do this?  Something I've been wanting since I built my first one was having separate containers from your stash!
---
nope. I played since the days of anarchy online, wow and some others. Have you tried farming ultracite for your cal 50 gun which needs thousands of bullets against the queen? its completly stupid. Have you already had an ultracite mod?
---
Honestly? However the tweaks -The game should be fun. And the fun stops when it just becomes tedious. Its a fine balance but it will be completly messed up after the patch. At least for me and as far as I can see it for a lot of other players as well.
---
Omg that‚Äôs hilarious only 20 geez , I wonder if it‚Äôs the low (3)charisma screwing my chances to find stuff . I‚Äôve never found a two or three star explosive anything until some guy at white springs during a nuke run took pity on me with my sad lever action and sold me his 2 star explosive for 200 caps then  another guy at the bunker sold me a 3 star explosive prime receiver lever for 1500 caps . And of course I see the jet packs on Ebay for cash,  but I‚Äôm not contributing to the duping problem. What can I say I have terrible rng luck!! 
---
There would just be more ghouls
---
Ye i like dis. But if youre on ps4 add me and you can dump at my place b4 queen fight. Im set up right on the edge of the area that gets nuked for fussure site prime for this exact reason. Gotta stop thise scummy barn and gully dwellers from getting the loot we drop in unfortunate accidents during event, ive even got multiple beds and instruments so everyone can get the bonuses without queuing 4e üëç. Psn mjesticbattlecat
---
Nah, it's fine as it is. 
---
Nah, next time dont die and you wont have to worry about someone stealing your loot. Someone dies and drops all their loot on the ground, it becomes just like all the other junk in the game, ripe for the taking.
---
Not convinced? Oh well, next time stay alive.
---
I'm on PS4 too, it feels like we have the smallest number of people compared to PC (duh) and Xbox.  My name is the same as on here if you want to add me! I usually only get to play on weekends so I'm only mid 60s in level despite buying the game at launch haha. 
---
Yup that‚Äôs the one 
---
I think the musical instruments and ‚Äúwell tuned‚Äù in FO76 are inspired by the occasional friendly party of STALKERs you meet around Pripyat swinging a guitar and playing a settling riff. 
---
Yep. Fully agreed. As I wrote in another comment. Bethesda follows the same errors that killed Destiny 1. Balancing PvP content by nerfing PvE. Never. Works. Ever. 
---
Simple solution is to separate both. In that case the approach reducing the damage done to players only would easily fix the "problem".
---
Bonus perk slots would be great. Even a simple change, like being able to reorder Perk Cards would be fine to me.
---
There‚Äôs a place in the Mire, a house called exelsior model house or something. Kill the Anglers there, they drop a LOT!
---
Fantastic
---
Or I have a mic, but it‚Äôs not plugged in lol. 
---
I heard that uninstalling and re installing can fix a lot of issues......i havent had the minerals to do this yet cos Bethesda lol but a few people have told me they are having less issues after doing this 
---
If your on pc grab the perk manager mod. A modder gave us the ability to have perk decks and swap on the fly ages ago.
---
Super handy to swap perk decks on the fly for everything.
---
* Work on your C.A.M.P.  Choose a theme and go from there.  Aquire all the rare plans for it and get creative.  Plans like the powered doors (gates), traps, advanced power connectors, terminal.  
---
* Work on your collection of power armor.  Have a different set for different situations.  I have excavator with Cali shocks.  Hit 500 carry weight sometimes!  My x-01 has a jetpack and is used for nuke runs.  Also use a t51b with extra strength to tank it for events.  
---
* Work on a set or two of normal armor.  I have a sentinel/vanguard set for PVP.  Also a set of unyielding for getting my special stats to crazy levels.
---
* Min max your perk cards.  Experimenting with perks and armor modifiers can produce some fascinating results.  Also it's great for switching a build by having the choice of multiple cards at different levels.
---
* Farm the queen and events.  Get all of those plans and recipies.
---
* Collect treasure maps and wait until have at least 20.  Do the location and scrap all the weapons to learn some useful mods.
---
* Do the weekly and daily challenges to earn atoms.  
---
Most important of all.  Find a team.  All of my best moments from this game have come from team play.  I'm usually a lone wanderer but sometimes it can get very boring.  Also being on a team you will learn a lot more about the game.  The best knowledge is always talked about in a party.  Hope this helps.
---
Exactly. 
---
Nope.  Death has to have some kind of consequences.
---
Congrats. You found a phosphorous weapon. You know, one of those ones forbidden by the Geneva convention. 
---
I used to have such fond feelings for the name Webster from my childhood. Now he‚Äôs the giant spider chasing me in my nightmares... great. Cool critter, though.
---
And Bethesda has the right to balance that.
---
Emmet mountain disposal site. You go in the shelter keep going down, take a right and it should pop up from beneath the ground.
---
Lol good on you. Im melee and rifleman but i can fully get behind behind what youre saying lol psn mjesticbattlecat add me and if i get a nice sniperish drop ill hit you up
---
It might be the targeting HUD has some bugs. But there's other issues that causes crash to. Best thing in my experience is just wait 20 second or so before moving when you spawn after fast traveling. A lot less issues then. But disconnect is mostly on the server side I guess. I had a smooth run for almost 3 hours last night with targeting HUD. In a almost empty server.
---
Wasteland whisperer is to pacify scorched.. Has nothing to do with taming animals.
---
I think a much better solution is if you steal someone's drop-on-death loot, it should enable pvp against them for you.
---
Got it for a bargain as the reviews were not that enticing. Got to level 5 before getting killed at the airport and without followers it is depressing. 
---
I can understand the survival ethos and it most likely works with teams of players though I only saw 2 other players online and neither were teamed up so for me it was back to FO4 with all the mods etc - so much better in my opinion.
---
Its a useless perk.
---
Often for me it's not that I don't have a mic, it's that I can't use it (don't want to wake the wife.) Often I will have coms open so I can hear, I just can't respond. Some means of conveying that would be amazing, and some way of letting players know they can be heard. Maybe some kind of mute and / or deaf icon?
---
Never said animal, it tames *creatures*. I‚Äôm level 260 I know what I‚Äôm talking about.
---
Okay, but after playing hundreds of hours is it not reasonable to have gear that is much more effective? Whats the point of grinding otherwise?
---
And I really doubt Bethesda will change it back. 
---
Or instead of all of this they take the mod known as text chat that one modder created. Then give that option in game for those that don't want to or cant use mics.
---
Been partiality deaf this mod has been amazing. The community is unreal and been able to make your own clans is truly cool for roleplaying and grouping.
---
\*slow clap\*
---
Already made a PVP alt character.  PvP atm is about having a tse, sentinel set, and endurance/agility perks.  Sad to say but that's the truth.  
---
the point of a good legendary is to be way more powerful than a normal one. 
---
And no. I won't be surprised. Me and my group that are currently enjoying the game even in its broken state will look at the effects of the next patch and probably leaving. 
---
Exactly this! Bought the most simple headphone only for this game to talk and make trade easier. Didn't meet anyone until now to chat with tough, 
---
Scorched Earth still sounds rad to me lol 
---
Leave Whitesprings and Fissure Prime just as they are, so that the low levels might have something to do (besides cosmetics, if cosmetics were possible, Blacksprings is a must). Spice up the rest of the map - oh god yes. Nukes should be so terrifying that if you are not a complete badass, you must be a sneaky bastard if you want to get in there and take something out alive, the fact that low levels players would be overwhelmed is very good. I hope high level players will be overwhelmed too.
---
That's groovy.
---
Pioneer scout camp has tons in the woodshop and some handmade glue laying around the camp. Just be careful as you might get sucked into the "Swarm of suitors" event
---
There needs to be a world shout in text too. Like "Where the hell is GRAHM!" It would also help for team ups against the Scorch Queen, or nukes in Whitesprings. DC Universe Online had a world shout in text, with a person to person text too, along with the voice chat that we already have. The Devs need to have a look at that game, there was so much that worked, very few problems in the first 2 years I played that game, and I was on nearly every day. When I left they created league HQs, and from the beginning the watchtower was a shared space that everyone was safe in. Duels could happen, but only with consent from each player. There were 2 HQs, one for villains and one for heroes, each could attack one another. That could translate easily to Fallout. Call one raiders, they can attach each other and one explorers, they can't. One for PvP and the other for PvE. Some of us don't want to PvP. We are purist Fallout players. Give us the option. Right now I have no option, I'm a pacifist, but if someone attacks me, I do no damage back, but they can kill me, that's not balanced!
---
Well all those cards you've used to increase defence, could have just been replaced with a set of PA. I get the appeal of not wearing any, but it's like all those cards are wasted imo.
---
agree, i have my camp near there because i always farm there , but i would build on the property!
---
There's not much to do. Build a camp?
---
try that against the glowing ghouls in whitespring - good luck.
---
1*?
---
Please tell me you trolling me.
---
Hijacking this post to say I'm only level 30 and I feel exactly the same way.
---
Cool. I'm on PC. I'll bug you in a week. 
---
Loot all tapes, glues and scrap adhesive. I'm level 40 something and have so much bulked I give it away to lower levels or sell it. Duct tape and wonderglue are super common in all areas of the map.
---
The dual Sony camera bar has a mic built in and the sound still goes through speakers.
---
Saw it a few hours ago.
---
I don‚Äôt care about your levels. Your camps annoy me and interferes with the experience for other players. 
---
The Brotherhood of Funk
---
The Rad Man Group
---
wauw respect for everything you have worked out man!
---
they should use everything you made, though they should also compensate you for your work!
---
I like having to slowly switch -- (this also rewards the normal human muscle memory experience where i get used to pressing the combo of buttons to do a switch that i might regularly need to do) 
---
but i want the UI to be upgraded so we can put a card in the trash, making it disappear from the swap field so we have to go retrieve it if we decide we want to actually use it sometimes, re order them, and most importantly keep the smaller version of the card after we decided to get an upgraded rank (we just use that hide feature if we don't currently have a need to equip the lower level card in the build)
---
this suggestion is part of my response letter to the inside the vault call for feedback that was put out to the players
---
there are animated cards that just come from the perk packs so it woudl also be good to be allowed to apply those to the card we have in the upgrade state, these are ways the existing system i really really like could be made more UI robust and enhanced to its strengths with remaining true to its main design
---
actually i can see a very good reason for the downvotes
---
Maybe it's 24 hours after you finish the quest earlier ?
---
Nah, ofc, not your job, i just didn't consistently see anything that made crashed more or less happening, it was just random so far. It's possible TH causes crashes, i use it and don't crash more or less than before....
---
How do daily quests work? Long and short answer is ' poorly and at random'.
---
Bone Skulls 'N Harmony
---
That's flawed logic a it's best.
---
Depends on the overall change, your going to need perks and special moved around and picked. 10 special will take 10 levels then you still need the perk cards. Faster than making a new character but a pain all the same.
---
Please explain in great detail I want to read this
---
What we really, really need is another one of these damn threads lol
---
Yet still no response about it, i don't mind seeing until there is one.
---
Nope :/
---
Sad.
---
If that happens I want to run with w mole miner gauntlets and deathclaw gauntlets 
---
Same
---
A dead man don't need no loot.
---
Or they can add it IN GAME, instead of the atomic shop.
---
Grahm's Crackers.
---
Dear god, grow up. This is honestly just sad.
---
Why not both?
---
one word
---
*completionist*
---
I'd love to save a bunch of appearances for certain occasions as I like to spice up my look every now and then. My raider queen has black hair and a clean face most of the time but I like to give her green hair and/or facepaint occasionally.
---
It'd be more comfortable to save and load certain appearances (especially if you adjust them to certain outfits)
---
And yes, I'm a "I chose the pink sword because it looks cute on my character" kind of guy. 
---
&gt; -Better group quest rewards.
---
got a source on that?
---
Just start a new character, doesn't take long to get them up to 50 and you can think of them as different builds.
---
You'll still have your sneaky sniper for when you absolutely must make somethings head explode from afar and if you need to smash something in the face with your super sledge its as easy as a quick switch!
---
You've also got all the experience you gained personally from the first time you ran through it so you'll know what to bother hoarding and what to just ignore. You get another 600 stash and a clear and free inventory as well!
---
You'll probably also find new areas etc that you missed the first time or wasn't able to get to etc.
---
That's awesome. I didn't realize that was a thing!
---
People can build anywhere they want and the game allows. Also, feel free to kill them and destroy their camp or hop.
---
Is this just today? I had a lot of disconnects over the weekend on PS4
---
My team-mate and I did this last night. we were in a Nuked Whitespring and as soon as we got near the golf club the constant whoosh of missile turrets.
---
We were fair about it. We went into game chat and gave him a warning. Letting him know if the camp wasn't gone in 2 minutes we would raze it to the ground.
---
It didn't go, we utterly destroyed it. Not just the turrets, the entire camp, we wanted to make sure this was going to be as expensive as possible for them to repair.
---
It goes like this: If you are going to go out of your way to negatively affect my gameplay at Whitespring by pulling all the enemies to the back of the Golf Club with your turret camp, I will utterly destroy your camp as payment.
---
Well EA changed their TTK/TTD times back when they didn't work out.
---
And I agree the point is being super godlike and killing with ease but EVERYTHING?
---
TS and E should have never existed together the way they do. In FO4, as far as I can recall, had a boost to base like this new patch not a 100% improvement
---
But we still don't know how it'll play out. 
---
Radio Active.
---
I'm on PS4, it could be PS4 specific. Do you happen to be on PS4?
---
Your ghouls?
---
I think we've found the entitled little bitch. 
---
How do you sign up? Like siging for becoming a middleman?
---
Where are you at? This bounty would be a God send lol
---
Bright headlamp mod should turn them on.
---
If we could get Workshops to be more useful and if it was more obvious what the perk was then we could get more people to do the Powering Up events.
---
Yes!
---
I‚Äôm about to start a second character to use for when my friends finally join me in the wasteland...it would be really great if I didn‚Äôt have to spend as much time replicating my likeness as I did the first time around!
---
It has bad performance and bad textures.  The graphics can be beautiful at times, but don't act like the games assets and framerate at up to standards.
---
Love these ideas, but if I were to see a webster, I would actually die.
---
I drop in the ice cooler outside the ws golf course during nuke zone. Lol had a lvl 17 guy loading up last night from it.
---
No give me your other hand
---
This is what I do. I have a "TSE ASSHOLE" (passive always on, i tag and bring to low health then step back for others yet still get hate messages lol), support (15cha, pyrolyser and a medic's handmade.) and a stealth sniper so far. Lots more to experiment with
---
rad X
---
This will never happen for one reason: "Hitler Did Nothing Wrong" etc tied to Bethesda.
---
Some sort of bot?
---
Nah for real lol. I speak both, but the translations and voice acting arent up to par.
---
He's getting in at a great time, the game is almost ready for a retail launch at this point.  Should continue to get better.
---
A global notification that an event has started would be nice. Maybe a radio station that has them like traffic announcements between the songs.
---
Why do you consider it useless?
---
Now I have a melee/packrat build and I don't buy much from vendors. I carry 4 sledges and whatever aids I pass by. Travel (when my fusion core is low or I'm feeling lazy) is pretty much the only time I do spend caps. I still slowly build them up as apposed to living paycaps to paycaps. 
---
What are you spending all your caps on that travel is important to be cheap? I buy dumb stuff from grant just because but otherwise I've not seen much outside of bulk necessities on occasion.
---
Though honestly I do think railways should have a set fee, or be a smidge cheaper, just out of the principal of what they are. Which yeah I'm usually going there to sell guns but it's more about how it's a railway station so 20 cap flat rate or something silly. Each his own though. We all play rather differently

Nope. Dump your junk before you go it is that simple. And if you are collecting junk from ground mobs as you are killing them then that is on you. I wait until the event is over before I start looting anything. I just keep a eye on where I am moving around and if I miss some loot oh well I am sure one less jang√≤ toy in my bag wont kill me. 
---
Cool. I removed the targeting HUD and I haven't crashed since. It seems to work fine for you on PC. Woot
---
Bot?
---
i can dust off the old collar and marry you guys in the church of atom as a nuke falls on us if your on ps4
---
lol, I also have like a dozen copies of several different keys.  I can‚Äôt figure out why I just can‚Äôt drop them!  I mean do I really need the keys to Principle‚Äôs Office at Morgantown High School now at end level?   Let me just let it go already!  
---
Would've loved to have this a few hours ago when I accidentally wasted a nuclear key card by inputting the launch code incorrectly. Fortunately, another player saw me in the silo and showed up with his own card.
---
Wow, I don't normally comment on these build posts, bit this is NICE!  Great job!
---
I‚Äôm sure this is a great story but you need some indentations somewhere. This is a wall of text that nobody is going to reward. Maybe put a ‚ÄúTL;DR‚Äù summary at the end. 
---
Yes please!  Let us know if we already own the plans!   
---
If other people's camps and game play annoy and interfere with you so much maybe you should stick to fall out 4. 
---
I do everything that doesn't require a group, mostly because every time I team up with a stranger they keep asking me for shit.
---
Pretty sure if nobody else is around and I'm the one kiting, engaging and killing them, kinda makes them mine... So I kind of have every right to raise the issue. Now if someone else was there before me nothing would have changed, I wouldn't have touched the mobs but I'd have destroyed the base all the same because it's causing a nuisance.
---
Unless you're on of those who just goes around stealing other peoples farms, if that is the case, who is the entitled one?
---
Or they just have a tag that says they stole your loot
---
They're Amazon's new delivery system.  Looks like someone's not getting their package.
---
Oh my god, amazing.
---
Rad Scabs for a punkish twist
---
Not really a problem imo. It sucks when your just starting out but during later high level play its really just 5 minutes of farming. The only thing I don't like to lose is nuclear material. 
---
 I had that kind of mind set since on ps4 most people are pretty nice till I hit level 64 and was questing out to Watoga died in aide a building, had tons of junk only to come back to some level 40 Jack ass sneaking around the mobs and just coming down the path where my corpse/bag was... Yep it was gone.
---
Changed my niceness that day. Now I loot every paper bag I see. You really don't need to board junk later on. 
---
I do think it's a huge dick move to grab someone else bag. I do not think it should PvP flag anyone. Though I would like to see it have an achievement aptly named selfish.
---
I had thought about something like that as well! Using things like packrat on the stash box to increase weight capacity and perks like bandoiler to reduce the weight of ammo in the stash box
---
Same - dailies are usually easy, while weekly require too much effort = if they can be obtain "by-the-way", than it's ok, but if they require to much strange activities I pass. Sitting already at \~1900 atoms, I've bought from shop almost all I wanted, now I'm waiting for re-introduction of X-01 black paintjob or other, similarly cool paintojob.
---
Wonder if that might have been a new account for a banned duper?
---
Paragraphs, dude!
---
I want to read this, but I‚Äôm not going to whilst it‚Äôs in its current format.
---
I see this event constantly on Xbox.
---
man, reading this gave me a headache. Grammar can go a long way.
---
That‚Äôs where my house is set up ... love it there although once a wolf spawned in my generator room and destroyed 2 medium generators ... great place AND there‚Äôs an acid node in the water as well.
---
We're gonna have a good day

And ain't nobody gotta cry today

'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today

You save that drama for another day

Heyyy we're gonna have a good day

After reading a little more it seems to be a problem on PC too, however you might just have a much better PC than a lot of players. Do you have some sort of ungodly good system? Serious question 
---
Same as gonkraider states ; ‚Äú...everything that doesn‚Äôt require a group...‚Äù
---
I didn't read all that, but I get it. Last few times I was on was pretty awesome,  made real progress,  and got great new stuff. Found a great place for my camp, it's beautiful. Also recently got stem recipe, and a couple new online pals. 
---
Must be nice, everyone I talk to opens with "man I haven't heard anything good about that game," and then I have to spend five minutes explaining why I still play it.  It's been hard to convince people to play a game with a weak story that you can't win, even if these people play Pokemon Go religiously.
---
Nah
---
OP, thanks for posting this. Wonder if you have recommendations on how to eliminate or reduce light bloom? My eyeballs are getting a workout; at this point I just turn my head away from the screen. Bit more detail:
---
1. Dark indoor areas with mixed lighting - Allegheny Asylum being a prime contender. Approach any large, light colored object (such as a wall) and my screen blooms from the object reflecting the overhead light source, turning near-white.
---
2. Dark indoor areas with explosive weps. Detonation causes a light bloom, where the explosion expands in a red/orange circular shape, then fades out. 
---
Mah poor eyes : -0
---
This is an attack on a minority. I'm offended.
---
The entire white springs itself is basically a plastic factory.  Golf tees, balls, clubs... plastic!   If you walk the grounds and buildings you‚Äôll find all the plastic you could ever need.  
---
The iron is for flavor
---
At least you didn‚Äôt buy the four-post bed in the atomic shop.  That thing should actually be called a kids bed.  It‚Äôs tiny.  When sleeping character‚Äôs nearly feet stick off the end with his head against the headboard.  It‚Äôs kinda ridiculously small since it‚Äôs an atomic shop item.  
---
But why balance a pve server? I understand pvp, but why the pve? It is self balancing....if i want to take 20 shots to kill a mutant, i will pick ANY other gun and not tse, because they all suck. If i want to blow shit up, i pick tse....whos gameplay am i affecting in a negative way?
---
I‚Äôll have to check and let ya know, never use it
---
If you're PS4/Xbox report to sony/Microsoft too. Pretty sure they can get whole console accounts banned. 
---
Their is still plenty to do,  you just gotta go find ya fun. 
---
I used to do the daily Ecological Balance and pick pumpkins for Jack. Usually though I get a couple of dailies when I log in, but when I get disconnected from the server they disappear so I don't bother anymore. I get the accidental ones like "do an event" or "scrap leather armor". 
---
We Three, but have one guy in camouflage 
---
Ah ! Well idk :/
---
Happens a lot during my weekends. I get dc'd probably once if not more an hour. Almost always with an error notice.
---
Sadly, PC, where the tools to deal with this are less robust. 
---
luckily Bethesda announced that they are fixing that mod scrapping in a patch... Of course, after I've already broken down countless mods. Either way, I'm happy
---
Text chat is cool - if you're on PC. Which a lot of us are not, so a no mic emote (and perhaps a couple more) would be useful.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox so that‚Äôs great
---
I'm PS4 too and i can assure you that they are spawning, but with a really low spawn chance, Bethesda doesn't seem to know how to balance things well, nerfs are 80% less damage... Spawn chance from 90% to 10%, a incorrect crit chance value is fixed changing to crit damage, sigh...
---
Ps: random numbers above, not talkin about anything especifically.
---
Well first thing i would suggest is dumping whatever it is that's taking up 600 stash space!
---
If your not using it, loose it!
---
You don't need quests for Fallout games, just pick a location and clear it out. Kill everything loot everything (getting rid of what you can't use straight away NOT hording), check out all the holo's and terminals find out what happened to the place your in then move on to the next POI and do the same again. 
---
Along the way you will probably get distracted by other players, weird encounters and events in the area etc.
---
Spend some time in high population areas, make some wasteland friends to waste some time with and shoot the shit with.
---
Level up a new character so you can try completely different build.
---
I mean if your really really bored you can farm for legendary's, but that's not fallout imo.
---
Whenever I go into the mine it usually triggers automatically, kinda like Line in the Sand. 
---
Had to type faster without actually reading again because every time i post it give an error which i cant copy and i dont know why
---
my anti armour exploding double barrel should still pack a wallop after nerf
---
And nope few joined mostly on my server
---
Id be ok with a small bump, but yes Bullet Sponges are not a fun way to make something difficult. Want to make it difficult? make it smarter.
---
Definitely interested in some plans and weapons and some junk mate
---
Black screen with his still visible is a new bug ... Yaaaaay ....... 
---
You have to close fallout and reopen it. 
---
If I were you I would send it to Bethesda somehow, they are listening, as they say, maybe they would get some inspiration from your work!
---
Your presentation is really great, thanks for sharing it!
---
Ya loading into fallout 76 is like waiting for dial up to download porn.
---
To get the whole story you need to listen the tapes but also read the various terminals around Whitesprings.  That is where you learn the whole story and it makes sense.  I thought the same thing at first until I started reading. 
---
You can take 5-10 levels in a nuke zone around level so easily! Even with the lower paying xp after the latest patch.
---
Every quest is just that, click one item somewhere head to another location and do the same....its the same in every single game out there. Just because there's a fancy animation screen or some npc waffling  (which lets be honest most people skip! who hates games with no skip button on long as cut scenes?) on for 10 minutes before it essentially says go here get or kill this. 
---
You could play this game all the way to level 500 without bothering to do a single quest, there's that many locations on the map to explore and clear.
---
Just view an enemy through the scope and it will mark it for you
---
There is about 1200 caps to made daily buy selling whatever to the different faction venders. 
---
Not an option for me personally were up too 175 gigabytes of required download... Hmm that's about a week or a full 7 days of constant downloading on my meager 500kbs dl/ 1mb up.
---
You first need to defy standard. One that isn't a singleplayer railtrack shooter. One that has one single big map with no loading screens and is also multiplayer. I have an average of 75 fps in this game that can drop to 40 in super crowded places. In Guild Wars 2 i have an average of 50 fps that drops to 35 fps with NPC limit set to low. I'm tired of people saying it's 2018/2019 like Bethesda was suppose to break a new standard with this game. All games run shitty because the hardware still sucks. I have an RTX 2080 and thought i will be running all games at max possible FPS. Turns out games will always be bottlenecked by your i7/ddr4. All a new GPU does is let you play at the same fps but at highter resolution. So don't blame  Fallout for our shitty fps. Blame nvidea and hardware manufacturers because i doubt you have good fps in other games that offer as much interractive objects per square feet as Fo76. I have 120 fps in PUBG but the world is 99% more empty of objects you can interract with.
---
Saw a dude nuke it today. Results? There were none. He missed the town. Somehow.
---
The industrial farm West of Flatwoods.
---
You do not need wasteland whisperer. That is my point. I tame creatures and do not have it. The video is incorrect. 
---
How long have people complained about the Scorchbeasts lagging people out? I hope the game gets fixed but it doesn't look likely. 
---
Plus the whole nuka rum and canvas bag fiascoes, and the overpriced cosmetics make it seem like a rushed cash grab.
---
Food and Water Resources:¬†If a location lists food or water as a resource, the number indicates the maximum amount produced per cycle. For example, a Water value of 4 means that up to four Water Purifiers will produce each cycle. If you have more than four Water Purifiers, the Workshop will randomly select and produce at four of the available purifiers. Water Purifiers that aren‚Äôt powered or at full¬†inventory¬†are ignored, so if you had six purifiers but three were full, the other three purifiers would produce.¬†¬†
---
That's copy/pasted from official guidebook. 
---
Mmm sounds like some gta shit is coming over here 
---
Gee, I did It several times yesterday with a short Recon scope on a pipe pistola and nothing happened. I Wonder what am I doing wrong.
---
They don't :/
---
Although as Todd would say "It just works"
---
I'll get me coat!
---
I've been following Enola Walker's holotapes, the first one is at Mac's farm.
---
It‚Äôs the- you got banned code. Believe me. Iv looked at it the past couple days. 
---
I just did a partial run with 2 other people who were already there. They were kinda being selfish dickbags about it though as I only got one kill the whole time...
---
Because if everyone can one or two shot everything, it'll kill the long-term life of the game. Bethesda said they wanted to keep the game around for a long time, but if everyone is in God-mode, then what's the point? Balancing keeps a growing player base, and incoming money for them. If future DLC can be beaten on day 1 by everyone, we will see even more "I'm bored, what now?" posts than we already do.. the player base will shrink.
---
For some reason, people don't see the big picture, and are completely oblivious to the repercussions of an unbalanced game. 
---
When I started playing Hta online, people were always trying to kill me, when I started this game, a random high level player gave me a large supply of stimpaks. Now, whenever I can, I give my extra resources to new players, to continue the wheel
---
I feel you. I'm sure I've surprised plenty of dudes when I start talking. Probably shocked the hell out of a new buddy the other day when I got on the mic for the first time, but he turned out to be one of the decent ones. We ended up making a good team and having a blast. The world needs more guys like that. Any chance you're on PS4?
---
ON PC it is kinda weird..... After I craft it, I have to select a different piece of armor and then come back to it and the "second bar" will show up.
---
It is like the UI has to reload or something. Been noticing it for awhile.
---
Although the guidebook isn't exactly clear, it suggests that isn't how it works. 
---
lol this guy
---
wish you could trade through mobile. i miss lot of good trades just because im out for work.
---
Uhh, enjoy the witch hunting ban?
---
Don‚Äôt think it works how I hoped; but if you maxed special stat charisma, then added full set unyielding armor, and swapped starburst for mentats, and drank a little more, what effects would be noticed by that level of charisma? If nothing, or diminished returns, then I‚Äôll definitely go an alternative build. But if there was a reason for more than 15 for Charisma, I haven‚Äôt found it yet ( only stat I can‚Äôt reconcile for myself, granted I‚Äôm considering a finite min cost/ max profit at vendors atm ( which may be the diminishing gains department, were only noticed at high cost/value items))
---
Hey, sorry to hear that you suffered abusive behaviour like that.  It shouldn't happen ever.
---
I also wanted to ask if there might be a problem naming them; against the Discord rules.  I don't want to see the victim fall foul.
---
Rule #9
---
It would nice if there was cursor memory in general. Its super annoying going through a full list. Cats especially does need it since there's no slow down like in fo4, nv, fo3...
---
erm if we don't convince you other wise are you going to change it?
---
More seriously, your junk isn't actually yours till its in your stash safe and sound, its the wasteland and if idiots kill themselves with there TSE's people are going to "steals" there loot.
---
lol hate those friken trenches near the queen as well btw :P
---
Not necessarily a straight up farm but I started picking up all the adjustable wrenches I see. They have one gear. In just a few days I've gotten so many I had to drop bulked gears. Pick up the wrenches! No one really seems to, they are overlooked as a gear source.
---
Please don't turn this into WOW
---
No, a GTX970, quad core i5, 16GB RAM, SSD.
---
Just avoid placing camp near the Whitesprings where most nukes lands...
---
whats the point of doing this ?
---
brilliant give me more reason to try and build a no-pa chem freak-party boy! 
---
I gotta say the cheap-ass mic that comes with the PS4 is actually really good. Just a single earbud with a mic on the cord. I would recommend something along those lines. I have really sensitive ear cartilage (it's a weird thing, I know) and there are very few headphones or earbuds I can wear comfortably for more than a few minutes, but this little thing is perfect for me.
---
That would explain all the skeletons in the dumpsters near the service entrance. :)
---
Was gutted last night as need more, finished repowering Poseidon and then the game froze :(
---
You say 'in my basement'
---
So are you in a prebuilt world structure?
---
also, sugar grove and anywhere else that has a lot of desk fans
---
Thats all it sells.
---
I think you CAN find variants, but only out in the world, you can't craft em or mod em, so... good luck.
---
If they use even a quarter of this stuff, it would make some great dlc! And a lot of the skins already exist from new Vegas. 
---
Sign me up for the fallen bos battle. Adding different variety of events for different nuke zones would be sweet. 
---
I think Workshops need love badly and like your idea.  I think once claimed that we should retain that workshop just like our CAMP.  When we log in it gets placed back in the world if empty.  
---
If not empty you get a notification that it can‚Äôt be built right now.  Then a player can go over and retake it, if they want, from whoever currently owns it, just as it is now!  
---
However, if you log in again later and it‚Äôs empty it can be automatically rebuild/owned.  I like your idea. 
---
This concept would place so many more workshops in the occupied status!   Then we would actually compete over retaining the workshops.  
---
Those are just cosmetic, no stats on them.
---
I scrapped about 50 hoping to learn the bos paint, I think it's one of those only from event things
---
Rock-It Launcher, Laser Musket, and Mesmetron dont canonically make sense so no.
---
I agree it does but so does stealing. There isn't too much pvp in this game and this could help add in a bit 
---
I wonder if it has to do with the distance you are standing from the enemy. Short scope may mean that you have to be closer, long scope, you can be further away. Hold the site on the enemy for a few seconds, and the diamond should appear
---
The combat helmet has material mods. The do nothing but make the color match the armor. I think you get them all for free when you get the helmet, except Brotherhood of Steel, which unlocks by scrapping armor pieces, not helmets.
---
I want to know this too
---
Oh , no , autocorrect lol xD just placed a new camp to create the essentials for adesive farm , so it's like 15 items (some mutfruit , corn and Toto ) generator , stash 
---
No terrain doesn‚Äôt effect it. If your camp is in a blast zone it‚Äôs gone. 
---
If you are very far away, outside of the range of the weapon it won‚Äôt mark them.  Also it you change weapons, the mark will go away 
---
The cycle ends here, we must be better than this
---
Pretty much the only thing I do anymore tbh
---
Waow, just waow!
---
I'm over on the south facing hill, can't even remember why I set up there to be honest (was probably about to die with a lot of junk on me).
---
Ill try It with a long Recon scope today. Tks
---
Every CAMP within the red circle is destroyed.
---
yes
---
As someone who snuck into Whitesprings at lvl 25 to get Grants sword, the turret farm base that was there saved me from death as I kited ghouls 20+ lvls above me to it.
---
Why well I guess it's because I assumed that it was as mod to help kill scorch but after some testing what ever gun I put it on it would to less then what the gun is doing in the first place.
---
For example
---
Lv15 pump shotgun dose 92 damage with shotgunner rank 2
---
Lv15 pump shotgun with scorch mode dose 60 with + 50% to scorch. Unless my math is wrong that means it dose 90 to scorch and much less to everything else.
---
If I am wrong can someone please tell me how to use it properly as I must of missed something.
---
I do every daily and weekly challenge. It's at least something to do as end-game content. And the Atoms really do add up.
---
I do the daily Challenges mostly if they are straightforward.  Some just pop as I loot and scrap, wandering the lonesome road.
---
The weekly Challenges, hardly ever.  My group doesn't play anymore, they got sick of, well you know lots of little things.  So team stuff is out.  If its a large scrapping or building I'll likely do it, but not the multi location photos or multi  quests wearing some stupid outfit.  Just not worthwhile.  I have most CAMP stuff from the store so theres no big incentive.  Like most if the rewards they're sort of lame.
---
Had this yesterday when helping a friend get to grips with the game.  After the lode baring quest he stopped playing.
---
The game will die soon so if they don't fix basic fucking game mechanics.
---
Yeah definitely extremely broken. I haven‚Äôt been able to do the ‚Äútrick or treat‚Äù daily quest ever again after the first time I did it.
---
I agree but it's just odd in a fallout game theres no real consequences for stealing another players loot. If this was 1 2 3 4 or nv and you stole a simple kitchen fork, the whole town would attack you. 
---
Either Burnin' Embers or Sick Fuckin' Puppies... 
---
Also getting strange triple load screens and for the first time since BETA I now get attacked by invisible enemies on almost every log in!!
---
I normally do but I can't when I'm at the stash limit and I only have junk bulk items in it 
---
Death Claws
---
 Pretty flippin awesome. I'd have to utterly avoid anywhere touched by the spiders and wasps cause they'd terrify me to no end, though, haha.
---
Rose and the Raiders
---
Left actually, I think
---
Two days ago I had to delete and reinstall the game because I started getting a weird connection error code after getting kicked for being idle. Fixed absolutely nothing regarding crashes and load times for me , sadly.
---
Can't sell plans to vendors.
---
It‚Äôs hard to tell since the effect almost never ‚Äúhappen‚Äù.
---
Just like magazine stands and display cases.  Does nothing.  
---
Why do you all bitch in generalities, "this kind of crap"...."i still play it even today". If it's crap why do you still play?
---
He's getting download because people realize that the atomic shop pays for updates, new content and servers. Accounting still has to pay for shit even if it's not good now and you want it to get better. 
---
run your business. im running a serum shop. its good to hop on and do some trades with people. made so many friends like that.
---
Ladies and Gentlemen...... WE HAVE A WINNER!!!!!
---
Then you have too much junk? There is no reason to have max stash weight on bulk junk.
---
Use the headphones / mic that came free with your phone!
---
It must have been built with a container already there in the world
---
Aside from making fusion cores, what are those good for?
---
Rad Rat Ramblers
---
Maybe you belong in the strait jacket, lol, some lunatic runni g up and staring at people who think they can read his mind
---
But it can hurt somebodys mind :D you need respekt social justice ISO standards :D
---
It's working as intended.. you have to go to other vendors
---
Your power armour is recalled to your inventory once you quit the server
---
"Deathclaw behind you" could be done a bit more general: "Danger there" and your character will point at the danger.  
---
"Legendary here"... everyone knows where to find them by now (thanks youtube).  
---
"Free stuff HERE" like for the other should be possible by simply point out a direction.
---
Wait... You can nuke places other than whitspring and prime??
---
Hey Bethesda i need my power armor back.. The game froze at battle bots. I drop ALL MY INVENTORY til i am no longer over encumbered to be able to run from keypads 1 &amp;2.
---
I SUCCEEDED. Now go get back in excavator power armor.
---
Oops. It froze just before i was about to enter power armor and would not unfreeze. So i had no choice but to leave world.
---
So i have been leaving and coming over and over and over nearly 10x now and still do not see my power armor where i had it.
---
Let me rejoin the world i lost it at. Pls.
---
Stab them with the pointy end of a sword, works for me
---
Holy crap *this* is why I‚Äôve suddenly started getting random friend invites! Now I feel dumb for not realizing that (and sorry to all those people I just ignored!)
---
yeah I've been doing that this whole time but after picking up a few legendary weapons and armour, I wanted to see if I could sell them to players rather than vendors so I can get extra caps. Mainly after upsetting myself selling a stalkers Gauss rifle for 24 caps to a vendor because I couldn't scrap it for a mod for my own.
---
I have had the Luck Of The Draw animation flash when my weapons are above 100%, but I don't know if it actually affects condition at that point. I'll try testing this later.
---
I still press B to back out of the menu sometimes and open my pip-boy lol
---
Oh i dropped it. And tried to re enter afterwards.  But it froze.
---
yeah that would be cool. I was more thinking of a arma3 mod with ranged walkie talkies. That way you have some immersive gameplay when asking for help.
---
Since there are so many relay towers in this game it could be a way to send out radio distress signals or stuff to the server.
---
You're saying I should try the pointy end? That's embarrassing...
---
The heal bug is back.  Not as obvious as first time around, but it's back.
---
I hope they at least mention him if they take inspiration from him he put a lot of effort into this
---
Inst that just the plague walker mutation?
---
But instead of getting back in right away, i did the quest. I wish i hadn't.
---
The "press any button" one is the only one I haven't seen before so thankyou!
---
Area chat. Toggle to view. There's plenty of workarounds, or they can continue being useless lazy devs that can't even be bothered to implement the most basic of online multiplayer functions. I guess they only really care about the numpty casual console players that are using controllers, so I won't hold my breath.
---
&gt;was wondering if we were lambs being brought to the slaughter
---
So OP, I need help moving this couch in to my van...
---
Or an 'unreal' one üòã
---
Would give another use to the terminal at your camp too
---
Hey, I still want the concrete peanut
---
I have it maxed but I've indeed never seen it proc. 
---
what he's saying is that at the location mentioned in the comment he's responding to, he found a power armor frame with T-60 parts on it that were blue. As he picked up the blue T-60, something occurred that when he proceeded to place his excavator power armor down on the same workbench, it turned blue.
---
It's not just you. I had to read it like 5 times before it started making sense.
---
Oh man now I get it. Fuck I‚Äôm sorry hopefully you can find it. If I was Xbox would help you out
---
I used to build at Whitesprings for convenience - not to kill ghouls. The frequent nuke drops made me relocate lol
---
I keep getting some dailies randomly trigger when fast travelling... ü§î
---
I have gun runner maxed and it's working for me (if I switch from pistol to an SMG, I can feel the difference)
---
You on PC, OP? I can craft you a new one if you want.
---
Let's not mix everything up, that's two different issues. The canvas bag and rhum fiasco have Nothing to do with the state of the game **itself**. It was not handled properly but these could/would have happened even if the game was in polished and finished state.
---
76 was rushed yes it could be a cash grab, very probable indeed but at least (and not to defend them) they are at least "trying" now to fix it. A bit too slowly imo given the hit their image took, i mean they Don't seem all that much in a hurry to try to gain trust back if you get my meaning.
---
That said stuff not being fixed yet does not necessarily mean they will never be. Scorchbeasts as annoying as some people think they may be, are still a low priority when it comes to bug fixing. They Don't break your game or stop you from playing, and it's a minor inconvenience at best if you have power patcher/white/fix it good etc... I have those cards ( and everyone should tbh at least when fighting them)  so this is a non issue to me.
---
 The game is still less relatively new after all. If in 6months some of the most requested changes and fixes are still not in the game, then yes your argument will start gaining some weight rapidly and i will join you on it. But until then. Let's see.
---
Maybe it's intentional?
---
I though post patch your turrets alone no longer earn you xp- you have to manually shoot enemies also. 
---
No?
---
I second ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a mic‚Äù and ‚ÄúTake this gift‚Äù
---
What a sad existence.
---
There needs to be something implemented. The only problem is, the timer doesn't necessarily indicate the progress of the quest. You could have 20 minutes on the feed the people event but have 4 people there that have nearly completed it. The event icon on the map would have to display both the current event objectives and the time left.
---
I had a lvl 40 targeting helmet and traded it for a plain lvl 50 helmet, and yet I still have enemies highlighted in red! Definitely some weird stuff going on with that mod. 
---
Lmao
---
I found several pieces of BoS combat armor on the dead paladin ("Taggerty" I think her name is) who's body you find at the end of the Glassed Caverns near the scorchbeast at the conclusion of the Brotherhood series of quests. Not a BoS helmet though, just a normal green one. Maybe it sometimes drops with the BoS mod?
---
For real? Which pistol you have? I play with black powder pistol, there it doesn't work. 
---
Have you found any genuine reusable value in your support build?
---
I wonder if someone has been salting the forest with them in hopes of the scorched picking them up.
---
Hmm...this sounds like a fun plan. ;)
---
that sounds like a you problem to me.
---
Unlock every map location
---
50GigaBugs ;)
---
I do the ones that aren't much effort.
---
It should be calming down now because of the patch
---
Also because if you accidentally shot one accidentally while trying to kill a baddie they all go nuts and zerg you.
---
That would be very nice. Thank you.
---
But what better then taking a flamethrower or a legandary explosive weapon and just going to town on it
---
Pipe revolver, also works with .44 sub nosed
---
This thread saved my shotgun build.
---
You def. don't get the other variants for free. I have none of them, and have found and can craft the base helmet. So you say just randomly scrapping enough combat armor pieces will unlock the helmet color variations? Show me a screenshot, pretty plzzzz....
---
the sniper outfit is a clothing item and will override your armor.
---
I had a Scorched wielding a Minigun like a one-handed melee weapon during a Poseidon Power event.
---
We need more paint jobs for everything honestly 
---
We‚Äôre living in a society here people!
---
good thing tse is getting a Nerf anyways :) 
---
If even the hardest legendary enemy in the game only drops unrewarding stuff...Killed the queen 2 days ago and received a 1 Star legendary...
---
Did AWOL armaments an hour before and was rewarded with a rolling ping from a 3 Star level 50+ robot...
---
Imho the carrot at the end of the stick is missing or moldy...I do not want to chase it anymore.
---
RNG is ok for me but double, tripple or even more gated rng is not.
---
Finding a legendary enemy --&gt; does he have sufficient stars ? --&gt; does he drop any legendary loot? --&gt; Is the loot on the correct level ? --&gt; Does the loot have sufficient stars? --&gt; Is it a usefull base item? 
---
Seriously?
---
I have a L100 gimped rifle char.  I currently have 20 unused levels to move him to a heavy weapon build.  It takes some time.
---
Yeah it won't "simulate" the blast. It's more just like
---
For each entity where distance from center &lt; radius
---
    Destroy entity
---
Will test it in a few hours with 10mm Pistol 
---
Lol. if you want a balanced pvp, remove svav, legendary effects, even x2 sneaking damage and let's see if fallout players can compete in pvp lol x)
---
Honestly I'd just make a new character. I'm level 26 and I want to change to a pistol build. I calculated that I'd have to grind out roughly 32 levels to get where I want to be with perk cards and special point changes. That's going to be far more if a grind than just starting over.
---
Oh, I know. But why not match? (I also hope they eventually fix the helmet so you can use the light like the miner's helmet and power armor helmets. That would add a bit of actual functionality.)
---
I play since beta (only 350hours tho) by the time i got over 180 lvls and i didnt still find my true best build. Everything i tryed was somehow weak to scorchbeasts, for example with sniper i strugle to kill even super mutants becouse they have high rezistances. I can oneshot them with stealth melee, but then i get radiation fighting scorchbeast queen, and melee is overall not good in shooting game. Only thing that killed everything in one shot was Two-shot explosive shotgun, you need only 5intel and will kill everything. But they are going to nerf it yesterday probably, so um i will continue tryiing to get something really working.
---
Yep a new bug from the update.  Annoying af and game breaking when you can't fix your weapons.  
---
Lucky I get my info from Reddit but feel for those casually playing who don't lurk here.
---
I have a bloodied build for general farming. don't think it's gonna change much for me.
---
The funnier part is, from the look of the UI, they 'fixed' the gaping blank space that used to be there but didn't realize that was like so because the blank space was all the other resources the workshop had, not because it was just a pointless blank space.
---
I need one for I have a mic but want to use emotes to communicate to you becuase.
---
Ps... just add chat.  Server wide and local say.
---
Probably easier to make an alt. Not being able to log back into the same server brings up issues with alts though, if you want to switch toons to do a nuke or particular event.
---
Saved presets would be awesome. Sharing could be fun, but not nearly as useful.
---
I thought about changing my character into a secret agent style woman for the mistress of mystery questline, but ended up not doing it because I spent way too much time tuning my current male character's face to just discard it.
---
I really want the ability to write notes and drop them. 
---
Military fatigues with leather armor and an army helmet 
---
Best places for plastic are Vailt-tec university, and Camden Park. Lot of plastic pumpkins in VTU and Nuka-cola Cup and Straw and Nuka cola Cup packs in Camden Park. There's also a place by the river, can't remember the name, but there's a ton of life preservers there and a mistster jangles hitting a bucket FULL of golfballs.
---
 "I now get attacked by invisible enemies on almost every log in!!"
---
I'm getting this a lot now on PS4.  I've also started getting infinite loading screens randomly this past week when fast traveling.  I can let it sit there for minutes without anything happening.  I eventually have to close the game and restart.
---
Anaconda Deathwish.
---
Yeah, it would go perfectly with Plague Walker
---
90% reduced weight or +1 STR are usually the go to.
---
i hope this gives bethesda some inspiration, great work
---
Wait, there's lead in those ? Thanks, didn't knew that
---
I was doing this yesterday and a guy was one-shorting everything with his lame TSE. I warned him if he did it again my two friends and I were going to turn on him. He ended up getting murdered. I hope it was just for some stupid wood leg or baton or something.
---
Yeah, thanks a lot OP.  You jerk.  ;)
---
Don't blink.
---
but, the legionaries are meant to be balanced against perks and their weaknesses.
---
2 shot had no weakness, and was strictly better than 5 point perks. Explosive was as well.
---
They swamped what character build you had. So of course they were removed.

+1 on this ... one thing I do to make sure I get a tag in is to open with a modded up Tesla rifle ... it tags multiple enemies if they are close together each time you fire and you don‚Äôt have to aim very carefully ... just point it in the general direction of a mob and it generally tags them all ... but I agree that if you are one shotting legendaries you should let others get a tag in.
---
Yeah but when you‚Äôre in PA you‚Äôre not wearing the regular armour
---
Can‚Äôt have it both ways
---
Stick with the regular armour then
---
likely considered a hate crime
---
Hahaha
---
My favorite passive aggressive thing to do to them is close the back door. 
---
Also a pain for repairing.  I spent an hour trying to get the springs to repair a leg for my PA, only to forget to equip the fully upgraded fix it good perk first.  That made me a sad panda.
---
Yaaas

---
I mean that 5-piece set of sentinel/Assassin armor will work like:
---
0,25 damage left after sentinel x 0,6 reduction from asssassin x 0,8 from, say, Lone Wanderer
---
Totaling at 0,12 of base damage.
---
It correlates with tests I‚Äôve conducted with high-end weapons with thousands of damage. 
---
If modifiers are internally multiplied end result will be around 23% and it is definetly not this way.
---
The only reason why I am not sure completely how it works is very strange relation between DR and damage reduction.
---
I suspect the DR works differently from F4.
---
But it is still definetly impacts high damage shots more than low-damage.
---
 I conducted tests with gauss, dragon and minigun.
---
Lol. The amount of people who "hurr durr nuke Whitespring" and literally center on the resort and miss half the golf club... Like you get all the way to launch and *miss*
---
The only way for you to get rid of your fear is to challenge yourself. Starting small and working your way up is the way to go and by facing them in a game could be a good way.
---
Don't let your fear limit yourself.

Hahaha i spawn at the bottom of my cliff all the time ad well. Annoying

Simple, once you drop it, it's not yours, so it's not stealing.  In FO3/4/NV you didn't get in trouble for picking up random loot, just stuff that was owned.

Blame Nvidia? Are you smoking crack? 
---
I'm playing on the Xbox one.  Which is AMD, shall we blame them too?.  But yeah, by standards I mean a game that doesn't crash at least once in a 2 hour session.  As for gpus, I know them well and poor optimisation from a developer will cause bad fps, not the card itself.  Nvidia has a team that help optimise games.  Even DayZ runs better than 76, and has a bigger map and items that appear in the world and not in a paper bag when dropped.  
---
Granted it's more CPU intensive but that's the thing with different engines.  Fortnite can handle 100 players and so can PlanetSide 2.  The creation engine is dated and poor optimized.  It is on the developers, not the chip manufacturers.  
---
Are you, though? There‚Äôs a lot of knew material mining and smelting happening
---
Quad Tesla with automatic barrel here. I do the same at The Whitespring's clubhouse and sometimes if nobody is around I will kill a few. It looks like they're leaping into the air when they die and makes me laugh. I'm a simple man.
---
Does blocker always block all incoming melee, or does it only block when you're literally blocking? Just cause it was in strength I got suspicious they may have worded it badly.
---
Good morning! Vault-Tec calling!
---
You can't begin to know how happy I am to finally speak with you. I've been trying for days. It's a matter of utmost urgency, I assure you. 
---
I'm here today to tell you that because of your service to our country, you have been pre-selected for entrance into the local Vault. Vault 111. 
---
Now, I know you're a busy fellow, so I won't take up much of your time. Time being a, um, precious commodity...
---
Won't take but a moment! We do need to verify some information. To make sure you're cleared for entrance, in the unforeseen event of *ahem*...TOTAL ATOMIC ANNIHILATION.
---
Sounds great? Oh, it has all the amenities of the modern home, I assure you. Not to mention total protection from nuclear radiation and hostile mutants. 
---
A better future, underground. 
---
It's not only our mission - it's our passion.

They updated the post to say both 2 shot and Explosive are being nerfed. Explosive will now only add 20% instead of 100%
---
Haven't a clue but I have the problem of it having loot but not loading in and the body despawns.
---
Confirmed - same issue, have Grim Reaper's sprint lvl 3 on one of my Characters and its not proccing at all. Needs to be fixed!
---
Yeah, I had the same experience levelling up. Top of the World scales, so the high level enemies is a result of high level players in the area.
---
Even at level 20-25, I don't think you need to be too afraid of level 50 enemies, whether it's supermutants, single deathclaws, single mirelurk queens or even single scorchbeast. They'll give decent XP (or used to before they nerfed the XP rewards) but to fight them, you have to be smart and abuse their AI. 
---
Don't get overwhelmed by multiple enemies, abuse unreachable terrain, fight long distances, stay crouched and stealthy to pick them off without them knowing your position.
---
Did you have any buffs to str?  Food buffs etc
---
I expect Bloodied will be nerfed next. I run it as well, and it is crazy strong.
---
You maybe ate something that increased damage and the effects expired my the time you made it to camp? 
---
Pay 2 win.
---
Indeed it will, but allow me to clarify;
---
If weapon is repaired above 100%, the Perk will continue to repair it up to 200%, but...
---
If weapon condition falls below 100%, then it will only repair back to 100%
---
This is one of my favorite Perks, as I seldom need to repair a weapon while using it.
---
Let me guess, you like conspiracy-theories in general right?
---
most games with a quest system are far more interesting than this. literally compare it to any other fallout or elder scrolls game, they're not all fetch quests within fetch quests and are far more entertaining than "listen to this holotape, okay, now listen to this holotape halfway across the map." if you think "it's the same in every single game out there" then you must only play fallout 76. 
---
thank you. Are you limited at you C.A.M.P. to number of stuff like that.
---
Bloodied melee build is super op right now
---
I also had that issue before but it seems to have just gotten worse.
---
Okay. Thanks for the answer :)
---
Strength affects melee damage.
---
It can be anything from chems wearing off, you removing equipment/exiting Power Armor, or having received any of the mutations that lower strength as a drawback.
---
I know, i forgot to mention that.
---
Depends on how you wanna play. You can do some research on builds and get on fallout market and buy the required weapons and gear, after grinding some caps of course. Or you just play, make due with what you have and adjust your build to whatever god role drops you get. But in the end, melee is king. Melee builds are cheap to maintain and you don't end up spending most of your time ammo grinding. Plus the damage. Jesus. On my bloodied mole miner gauntlet, I can catch 1,200+ on damage with no Chem buffs. 
---
More like that
---
I usually just do a wave or thumbs up emote. To me, that kinda says "I'm saying hello without actually saying hello." 
---
The Excavator Power Armor provides a boost to mining operations.  You can always hop into it, gather your items, then hop out.
---
Fort Defiance top floor has a ton of plastic.
---
Can I use this quote for my tombstone? 
---
I believe weapon damage is shown to you based on your current modifiers. I know perks will do this, and I believe it also factors in special point bonuses, and possibly other buffs from drinks/foods, etc.   
---
Have you changed perks or moved perk points? Did you look in power armor then out of power armor? 
---
I think all weapons should show unaltered base damage for proper comparison as a separate stat.
---
I just got this card and I am experiencing the same issue. It pops up but none of my weapons repair. It has to be bugged because it's popping up so often. 
---
It's honestly the one thing I don't like about shotgun.
---
Hey man, still selling handmade plans? Online today?
---
I usually don't go when there's a few people already there because everyone usually uses their strongest weapons making it difficult for everyone to get a tag. The few times I've been alone and one or two players come by, they've always sent up the "help" emote when they spot the supervisors and make sure everyone gets a tag in. When there's too many people, everyone gets trigger happy. 
---
Great effort. Really cool.
---
I would like simple ladders and trap doors added to camp

Oh, but I've made the real thing ü§£  https://imgur.com/NVYmlyi.jpg
---
It takes a second or two to mark them, and if you swing your sites over another enemy, it will usually drop the first one.
---
The best part is that once marked, it will stay marked even when killed, until something else is marked, which makes it much easier to find that Legendary you just shot in the bushes.
---
I wouldn't mind them focusing some of those decals they make for tattoos on Power Armor. This would give people a little more identity on their Power Armor. 
---
I'm camped there :-) good spot
---
Um, can you post a pic of the river location (on the map) please?

If you fall in a fissure theres no loot to grab you just lose it all in the fissure, done this myself a couple times

‚ÄúHmmm? Oh that? That‚Äôs a murder party. Quite civilized  actually. They get nekkitt and slap each other.‚Äù

to add to this, corpses are ALWAYS free game. roll into any city and blast somebody apart, even though everyone will go hostile for the murder it won't be considered stealing if you loot the corpse, ever 
---
Lone wanderer emote
---
ive been taking work benches recently, im lvl 22. all of a sudden out of blue the the first wave will spawn all lvl 50s+ this has happened at Sunrise meadows and billings homestead. a wave of lvl 52 Gutsys.
---
Yep very familiar with both. Especially the bags not showing / bags completly dissaperaing or glitching through the ground. To prevent that from happening to valuable items drop a single bullet and see if the bags dissapears or not. If not, drop the intended items then.
---
Now I am just a simple brahmin shit sales man, but....
---
Honestly, I dont find the legendary weapons all that wonderful. Its all about your SPECIAL and perk cards mostly. I run with 15 strength (3x for all of the sluggers, incisor, and martial artist) 
---
Under endurance I use solar powered (+3 strength during day and radicool) 
---
Tenderizer under charisma
---
Nerd rage for intelligence.. i also toss on weapon artisan when I repair.
---
agility i have adrenalin.
---
Bloodied mess under luck.
---
The final two pieces are mutations and unyielding armour. I have 5 shit pieces.. 
---
I have sledge hammer that can do around 700 damage. But i mostly use a mole minor gauntlet that goes around 1K without iron fist.  Then I have a mister buzzy blade.. that is my SBQ killer. 
---
&gt;and melee is overall not good in shooting game. 
---
why are you giving out bad advice? melee is probably the best starter build in the game. you literally cannot mess it up.
---
get out the vault. craft some boards. secure a PA frame. dump points into strength. pick slugger, martial artist and incisor once they become available. done.
---
it's that easy. what do you do with the other points? doesn't matter, you got PA and a stick. that's all that matters. seriously though, invest a bit into intelligence for PA perks, agility for AP, luck if you use vats and charisma for lone wanderer or whatever group perks are relevant to you. perception and endurance are mostly useless but Life Giver is nice, I guess.
---
keep in mind this is just a very general build that doesn't really excel at anything but is good for everything. even the final boss, you could invest into heavy weapons and switch on the fly.
---
Yeah, people rallied there and had a pretty nice community what with the clear lines of sight and robot guards. As others in this thread shared, the robots were hardwired to renovate the resort and kick out any 'tresspassers' while construction takes place.
---
I have a pistol and explosive weapons (Auto grenade launcher and grenades) character at lvl 77 that I'm not happy with. Exploding weapons can only be used at medium range and revolvers has horrible TTK.
---
I've decided to move three points from agility to perception and replacing the auto-pistol perks with auto-rifle perks and will need to get and max the Tank killer perk also. That's nine level-ups. After I'm done with that I will reassess if the change was for the better or not. 
---
As someone that just ran around smacking mole rats with a pitchfork, 1200+ damage sounds insane lmao.
---
There is no chat because (dumb) console compatibility.
---
Yes, take your time exploring. Get comfortable with the game's mechanics and controls. Don't just jump in and power level like most people. There's so many little details which I bet the majority of players haven't seen. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/4BX74no
---
You can see the blue on the helmet, feet, and in a couple other places.
---
Sometimes armor / clothing when you load into an area just doesn't load properly.  I'll see one teammate in his undies, but another teammate sees him normally.
---
I've also seen people running around in invisible power armor.  Their character frames stretched and distorted to fit in the frame, but the frame not visible.  Makes them look like tall skinny aliens.
---
Lots of visual bugs happen often.  Usually one or two more loads later it corrects itself.  Or the server eventually crashes, and everyone gets kicked off and you start fresh with fewer bugs (until that server overloads and crashes a couple hours later).
---
It was too expensive so they went with the yellow. Yellow is such a cheap colour, so weak. I was expecting a blue paint job, that's one of the reasons why I opted for the Excavator Armor. False advertising!
---
Have fun, and jumping into game this "late", may cause problems to you, because the enemy scaling is pretty weird in FO76. If the enemies seem much higher level than you, it may be becauce someone with high level char has just been there. Areas scale compared to the person who enters there "first". Log out, log in, may help in these cases.
---
My modus vendor seems stuck. Offers the same three plans and no mods. Been like that for a while now.

---
Nah played thousands of games over the years, only a hand full of them have had amazing immersive story's I actually cared about though. Game play is more important to me, if i wanted an amazing story I would watch a film or read a book. 
---
Very few gaming companies have the ability to tell amazing stories and in this day and age where micro transactions and monthly subscriptions mean more to the company than the quality of there product the "stories" are becoming more and more generic.
---
Fallout for me personally has never been about amazing story lines that Bethesda come up with (because lets be honest none of them ever have been), its the post apocalyptic setting and freedom to explore and do what you want, which is what we get in FO76 and what i think most of the fans expected, especially after we found out 76 was going to be the first vault open in WV.

The Scorched Plague = the Pestilence
---
A plague that happend and each players has to go  and help each other to cure they're disease 
---
I would only agree if it showed the adjusted (after all modifiers) damage as well. Like special stats do. That would definitely lead to some confusion anyway, as chess and food wear off, but you could at least compare basic stats with swing speed and quickly dismiss the lesser item if stars are equal.
---
Thanks. Will keep that in mind
---
thanks we indeed did that after losing about 1500 bullets lol. The bags never showed up though. 
---
Im level 130ish and still swapping around perk points/cards, I would just grind your current character because you'll probably end up changing it anyway as new things get introduced/weapons get nerfs and buffs.
---
So, I'm torn on this issue. I, personally, have never built at Whitesprings. I prefer setting up my camp on resource nodes to make use of resource extractors. My buddy, however, is one of these players building elevated, turret heavy camps at the golf course. I went over to his house the other night to see his build since we aren't on the same platform, and while I don't think I would enjoy this playstyle I cannot argue with his results. He got half as many legendaries in five minutes as I have in my 100+ hours. The payoff certainly makes it tempting, but it seems like such a mindless grind.
---
If the game allows people to build here then why shouldn't they build there? However, I also agree that if the game allows roving gangs of assholes to level my base in the middle of nowhere for no other reason than they think it's funny then you should be free to do the same to turret grinders. They're both annoying, but equally valid styles of play.
---
Agreed. Base damage is much more informative. The difference was indeed in and out of armour and I might have had increased strength to get home with the extra weight.
---
Yup I meant buttressed.   Total brain fart on this one.   Thanks for pointing it out I am not sure I would've caught this myself.
---
Ive seen melee kill her in under a min so this argument is not valid
---
If you aren't stripping high tech from tribals, you're doing it wrong.
---
Well done! Awesome work I'd happily have this as DLC
---
It's definitely back.  I'm level 200 and know how to spot it from the first time around.  It's slightly different though, less obvious but it's there.
---
Yeah, probably increased strength to get home with the extra loot. never thought that would change the weapon damage though. So now I know. Difficult to ascertain what the basic damage is then. 
---
Thanks all.
---
my guy keeps developing a drinking problem...
---
I'm sure they'll add them little by little. 
---
 RIP. Dropped a quad ammo capacity level 15 pump shotgun for one of my low level friends on my floating camp... Never to be seen again. Tried moving a floor out of the way so it probably completly disappears .-.
---
Wow you play on a console and complain about performance and bad graphics. Just friking wow. You should limit yourself to games with cartoony graphics like Fortnite that run well on consoles. I really don't see DayZ and Planetside 2 being even close to the detailed enviroment that Fallout 76 has to offer, it's laughable to even compare them, they look like having poligon textures. Maybe you still haven't disabled motion blur and depth of field in fo76 because i just can't explain it.
---
Sounds about right. One thing I noticed though is that my buddy started in his undies and slowly but surely he got more and more clothes on by the time well.....the game crashed. 
---
After a while he not only had undies but I saw his knee protectors. A bit later I saw his armor plate and his pipboy. Then his hat but I think his hat was heavy because after that we crashed. 
---
It's sad because I want to roam around with the feeling we are in a post apocalyptic World and we scavenge together for survival. 
---
But unfortunately that feeling is overruled by the constant fear of crashing. 
---
Took you long enough, slacker! ü§£
---
It's not the mole miners themselves that surprised me. Just that I looked away for 2 seconds after clearing out the area to see a mob of high levels ones chasing me down. 
---
Thanks. I followed the steps and it was like that dmv quest. The result is that every purchase on ps4 is final,so if you make a mistake ,they don't care at all.
---
Whatever it will remind me to be more carefull in those menus.
---
Yeah, I'm melee and accidentally sold All Rise.  I'm still really pissed off about it.
---
I actually spent some time looking at the the legendary ability spreadsheet to try and understand the 1, 2, and 3 star drops a bit more.
---
It's interesting finding out what's exclusive.  There really is a super small mixture of valuable modifiers and getting a 3 star with 3 great attributes is a true feat.  So many weak buffs.
---
 I have a Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB Cardioid Dynamic mic that works well with speakers. With push to talk you other player don't have to hear me sing along either. I'm a terrible singer.
---
I‚Äôve often heard people suggest Whitespring vendor for plans - you must mean somewhere other than the railway station vendor? He only ever has walking cane plans... 
---
"I'm not salty, but you're a salty bitch" 
---
you seem pretty salty 
---
OMG
---
You did the Fallout themed party too, right?
---
You are amazeballs.
---
Damn i love the weapons since i think weapons from Fallout 3 and NV looked nicer and the fallen brotherhood is something i was thinking about along with something called a brotherbot which is a robotic power armor that roams the wasteland.
---
And its true lore wise the wanamingo or the alien looking things are still alive  
---
So you just need animal friend for this (maxed?)
---
Also, if you had the perk card (I don't remember it's name off-hand), that gives you a +% damage bonus after a kill, will reflect in the damage numbers, then fall off after 30 seconds
---
Lol yes I was in a building when I dropped the bag and did the same. Went downstairs to check if it felt true the floor. But nothing. 
---
But when I came up my buddy was making hearts in his underwear while his character moved at it was behind a terminal, typing stuff. So atleast we laughed....and cried because it crashed almost imidiatly.
---
Yep. Looks like it is fixed. Was able to scrap the stored one. Did find a BUNCH of crops stored... again. &lt;SMH&gt; Ah well, as mentioned below. Soup and juice for everyone!
---
Read half and just scrolled. 
---
If your on your phone. Hit ‚Äòreturn‚Äô twice once in awhile while typing. 
---
Leaves spaces. 
---
Not really, the ones I have heard of I find entertaining, not factual.
---
Only if they also add an umbrella melee weapon
---
blobbleheads. and I believe it's unclear whether Bethesda is fixing it come the next past.
---
regardless, there are many other ways to grief.
---
Much the same as above, take your time, they may have not worked so much on some aspects of the game (bugs and what not) but the environments are some of best I‚Äôve seen in the fallout series. 
---
Could always put a couple of the pieces on a chassis to reduce the weight in your stash box
---
As a lifelong bostonian some of the npcs were def massholes like the guy who sells the credit card then calls you a retaad (yes two as no r on purpose) i think that if as the vaults open npcs were introduced it would make sence from a lore and gameplay standpoint
---
Mine is popping up as often as it should with my character having 11 luck and the card at 2*. It just never repairs my weapon.
---
Same. This is my home!
---
Same on Xbox
---
Every point of str adds i think 5% melee damage
---
Ok. Deofficed.  I tried 4g for a few minutes.   I didnt are a problem.   That may vary of course based on reception and local traffic I would imagine.
---
Yes Bigfoot!!
---
has anyone gotten anything other than level 40 loot? I've ran it a few times by myself (106), and only got level 30-40 gear
---
Wait till you get the dragon. 4 barrel black powder rifle. Does terrible things to health bars lol. 
---
Have you looked in your inventory? That's where it usually goes,  when I leave it out and quick travel or leave the world.
---
I got Bo's helmet mod unlocked from scrapping a Bos chest piece
---
No we need a "FIX THIS SHIT" button 8am to 8:25 est two disconnects this is getting old
---
Ohio River Adventures is the name of the plac. North West of the Nuka Cola Plant.
---
Yeah. Its dependant on the type of purifier. 
---
Example,
---
Small purifier creates 12/hr (don't know exact off top of my head but 12 makes for easy math). That's 2 every 10 mins for one purifier. If you have 2 purifiers, it's still 2 every 10 mins total. So after 10 mins there would be 1 in each. But after 20 mins, there would be 2 in each. So you don't get any extra water by having more purifiers..  it just means it hits the storage cap (2per purifier) less often. 
---
So you can leave your camp for 20 mins. With one purifier you get 2, with 2 purifiers you get 4, but if you had 3 purifiers there'd still only be 4.
---
Just to be clear: pacifist mode prevents you to damage other player, but it doesn't give you any additiinal protection
---
I heard he‚Äôs a great chiropractor!
---
I'm in a little lake just to the east of the top of the world. There are brahmin openly roaming around in it, they're pretty much the only thing that bother me.
---
I build there for the flat lush green grass
---
If you're going to throw this much work into something you might as well apply to work at the company.
---
That's fair. The rum and bags weren't handled by the game devs.
---
 The point with the Scorchbeasts is the attacks can cause some people's games to freeze and crash. I don't hold hope as the devs said they'd be more vocal on here yet they're nowhere to be seen.
---
I really hope I'm wrong though, I really enjoyed the time I spent on the game, and I'm hoping they can crush the dupe exploits once and for all. 
---
I camped along the river headed to flatwoods. Lots of new comers stay and visit.
---
Ugh I just scrapped my entire power armor chassis trying to get rid of extra clothes, this would be great
---
I do UF(works fine for me), and other events at the east side of the map.
---
We need more one stop shops! Like mine? Granted my shop doesn‚Äôt look exactly that way anymore, it‚Äôs evolved. But here‚Äôs my shop.
---

This looks like a porn video I watched once. 
---
I wish I had encountered you, instead of the two asshats with full xo1 and tse shotguns leveling my base and mowing people down like it was straight out of DOOM... I ended up just building a proper house. RIP fight club.
---
that‚Äôs gonna be my next option but i‚Äôve been trying to avoid getting more frames since managing the three or four i have now is bad enough with the same name, the only difference is the atom shop icon on one of the frames and the rest are exactly the same
---
Also, if you join an event like Uranium Fever, try and have a Tesla rifle or at least some Molitovs to make it easier to tag.
---
watch out, the random invites could also be people looking for a camp to grief
---
Have you tried it?
---
Just sayin.
---
Not if you Drop it from your inventory.  I dropped EVERYTHING to a brown paper bag but dropped armor.   Game froze when i tried to put it back on.
---
I found another power armor and then had enough ingredients to craft all excavator armor except for right leg. 
---
I have spring 45/49
---
so it's still a thing? last few times I tried it I only got 3 legendaries, only 1 of which was level 3. I figured it was patched or something.
---
Thanks, this is pretty much what I was looking for.  Does Power Armor limit speed or anything?
---
&gt;  I'm hoping they can crush the dupe exploits once and for all. 
---
This we can both agree on.
---
[No one can defeat the Quad Laser.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNYMxgNKIEU)
---
Legendary gear is never higer then level of mob it dropped from, same as normal gear and as mole miners are level 40...
---
Sounds like you owned the workshop. He probably started to contest it for half a second to get in PVP mode with you, then oneshot you, then went back to finish the takeover. 
---
Workshops are PvP zones.
---
That doesn‚Äôt stop assholes with background noise in other games that require far less...oh forget it. 
---
I never thought I'd try a bloodied build till I started playing with a group of guys that had some bloodied builds. Its a glass cannon. Cause you will die a lot  more but all you gotta do is touch most things and they're dead. Lol. 
---
Huh, cool, thanks!
---
Diseases are so frequent that you can notice difference on big numbers.
---
My cure consumption drops almost twice from initial levels, BUT it is still pain. 
---
To the level that I try to avoid melee whatsoever.
---
If you want to check which missiles are available go to your holo tapes and use the "Missile Silo Tape" or something similar to that. It shows the state of all three missile silos so you can see if there are any available. The bug you mentioned is an annoying one and I've run into it many times. I've had a few times where repairing rapidly will give just enough time for the delayed progress bar to finish in time and others where multiple attempts failed. If I experience a delay now and know it won't complete I either go to another silo or another server.
---
If you were on a team as you mention and one of you was still on the server while another rejoined then you likely kept going back to the same server and same bugged silo every time. I agree that it's frustrating with all the problems we encounter but launching is far from impossible.
---
pc ;)
---
Yep, that was my assumption.  The text says they should refresh the timer not stack, so really Bethesda should just make them work as intended.  
---
Nonsense. You get them drunk. They pass out. Then pass from your body harmlessly.
---
(This also works on the voices in my head)
---
as somebody who can immerse themselves quite easily in a game, I have to say I disagree. I've played tons of games this year alone with amazing and interesting quests/stories/plots etc. although I do agree that fallout 76 is more about the gameplay than it is about the story, I have to conclude that progression wise (with quests and side quests) it's incredibly repetitive and boring. they're alright at first, but get dry pretty quickly 
---
Anyone seen any lauuuunch codes around here?
---
I'm aware but at best this just gives you a very small amount of raw materials and then the node has to refresh. When you place an extractor at a workshop you get a steady stream of materials.
---
Indeed, just emphasising that I wasn't engaged in PVP where a oneshot could be expected, the idea is that I should only take slap damage unless I engage in PVP and being oneshot should not be possible.  
---
And few people (at least I am) do this not only for legendaries, though also for extractors, so if you see somebody to try and run event as it was meant, you can at least help repair those things.
---
You know I honestly never thought of it that way and you guys are right. My mind has definitely been changed  
---
a bit. but it hardly matters considering the trade off, especially early in the game.
---
the frame alone gives you 60 DR. that's a godsend for a brawler fresh out the vault.
---
Yeup. My heart couldn't handle that
---
Coming from the one that took my original comment as my opinion on the game.
---
There is a mod for PA legs :
---
Optimized servos - Reduces action point cost for sprinting
---
I made a "Sprinter" excavator set PA with them for when i feel like running.
---
On another note I think the Fusion core drain is related to action point consumption. I need to test it while using perk card that reduces fusion core drain. 
---
https://nukacrypt.com/solved
---
Excellent job! 
---
Thanx man 
---
Yea.  Either stack rad-x or use a hazmat suit. 
---
PA frame aint enough.  
---
I'm pretty sure that Bethesda will provide more colors in the future IF you're willing to pay for it with real money.
---
Killed a 2 star glowing legendary radrat, it healed itself and everything. Dropped me a normal flare gun... 
---
Your just dumb man what you need is a full suit of  power armor just a frame gives you no rad resistes
---
Sentinel with unyielding is good for PVE, especially if you use Dodgy or shoot with VATS.
---
I found it useful to have 1-2 Life-saving pieces on me (I personally equip 1 arm with sentinel/life-saving and perk mysterious savior - help to cut corpse running times in the instances like Silos.)
---
Also unyielding is a way to maximize Int for crafting and luck for better drops.
---
Whitesprings to west tek to harples ferry. 
---
Thats my 3* farm
---
Ah. Guess the stories were for PC or Xbox then. Sucks. 
---
Is your power armor fully equipped ? not only the frame but arms, legs, chest and helmet.
---
Use Rad-X (or RadShield)  
---
Use radiation reduction perks.  
---
I used to have the same problem the first few times I went to a nuke zone.
---
Buy one on r/market76
---
They‚Äôre worth like 500-1000 caps maybe.
---
Saves a ton of time.
---
Oh yeah, that's gone mate.
---
Exactly the same happened to me, only it was at Monogah (or however you spell it). I though my goose was cooked, but they only waved it around.
---
Just drop an orbital strike on it lol
---
Smash the camp up, people are dicks in the wasteland, fight back. 
---
Is he in with the assaultrons?
---
Thanks man. Im new to the fallout series and the in game help section wasnt clear. 
---
I learned the shadowed mods by scrapping. Doesn't do anything..... but it looks cool.
---
Why do people keep leaving them in their stash instead of using them?!
---
Stupid question but what does "bloodied" even mean? lol, like I said, I really only have like 2 hours in the game.
---
I accidentally built on top of their spawn point first, logged in the day after, 3 stuck in/under my dock, that sound will haunt me forever
---
Hazmat suit if you can't equip the armour pieces.
---
Ok sorry about calling you dumb if you want to grind my psn is darkdestory23 
---
^this is why I want to level his house. 
---
.....‚Ä¶ ^(thats why i've found so many paralyzed ghouls)
---
yes, then you acquire a bounty and some giga whale in diamond-encrusted armor comes and oneshots you.
---
How aboyt a Mic drop emote. It would add so much with such a simple gesture.
---
Personally I like the idea of a buzzblade with furious and swing speed 
---
Yeah. In the first paragraph op says ‚Äúmy ghouls‚Äù and in the next says ‚Äúthey aren‚Äôt yours to claim‚Äù which is glaring hypocrisy. I agree with the overall sentiment of the post but the language used is really entitled and obnoxious.
---
&gt; fiReleasingrst person 
---
ah yes, my favorite POV
---
Aww man. At least it was just power armor and not my entire inventory at bag pickup.
---
Thank goodness that didn't freeze or i would've been at 30/250 instead of 1400/250.
---
I wanted to try to sell things to other players instead of scrapping
---
It's supposed to be the hardest enemy in the game. You shouldn't be avlt to kill it in 6 or 7 shots. Using 30 bullets in the hardest enemy in the game is not wasting ammo.
---
I orbital strike them every single time and grief the owner till he leaves 
---
There should be specific remedies for all in game diseases besides a "disease cure" 
---
This is Really good.  Alot of these ideas are excellent additions to the game too.    no reason at all they can't implement any of this.
---
Yeah, they never have acknowledged the left hand for anything except holding a rifle. I always wondered why you have to play Skyrim to have two weapons at the ready. Wouldn't it be great to be able to wield two pistols or knives?
---
They dont
---
Same, was quite unstable over weekend. Had a freeze at end of powering up mission which was frustrated and a few times when quitting it didn‚Äôt properly save progress
---
Level 15, 11 server hops and so far only been offered Ski Sword and Cultist blade at Harper‚Äôs Ferry Vendor Bot Wallace, hoping that‚Äôs just bad luck, or could there be something i‚Äôm missing?
---
When you get the bounty chamleon with a sniper.. Can earn allot more than your bounty is worth lol 
---
Horde screws and springs.  But especially screws.
---
Go home Rad Worms, you're drunk.
---
You should probably try doong some LOW level events that reward armor, instesd of dropping them from mobs. I got multiple level 50 legendary stuff from Fertile Soil yesterday. All of them were 1 star only though...
---
To me it seems like if an event has weapons / armor in the actual reward table, theres a fair to good chance it'll be a legendary for your level.
---
I‚Äôm thinking Anti-Armor and Explosive or Furious and Explosive will be the new go-to for end game. Obviously the Bloodied Melee Build will always be a thing. 
---
Hate to say it but it's part of the game, my camp is up on the mountains around white springs so I store my junk then head down to farm the clubhouse, if there's a camp I smash the generator up.  
---
Then I wait to be murdered. 
---
This is amazing. Does that scorchbeast ever come to bother you? You are near a fissure site right?
---
For buying/selling, I think you reach maximums not long after 15 (cha 15 is almost at the limit, and cha 15 hard bargain 3 is already overkill).  Someone‚Äôs empirical testing showed buying best case being 70% of worst case, and selling best case is 25% of nominal value while selling worst case is 10% of nominal value.
---
For these mysterous group rewards, no idea.
---
Yes, your character save file is stored on Bethesda's servers. You should, however, migrate your My Games/Fallout76 folder to preserve your config files if you've done any custom tweaking to them as well as any photos and character pictures.
---
One mod i had was an Increase Ap thing for power armor.  When applied, it's called Assembled Power Torso or something like that.
---
Forgot where i found it.
---
Idk ... I‚Äôve only encountered this once and  the camp was behind the club house so we just kited the mobs to the wall to the left of the club house ... having a rad shower and a place to scrap was sort of handy ... but is do see the OPs point here. 
---
If you've claimed a Workshop I'm pretty sure you're liable for PvP while you're within the build area.
---
It's not a bad thing that different situations may not call for different guns. Honestly that's a good thing.
---
Im one of those crafters lol üòã
---
that sounds awfully counterproductive, just saying.
---
If your sprint then attack it‚Äôs an uppercut
---
I love kneecapping enemy‚Äôs!!!
---
Fallen Brotherhood is such a good idea/missed opportunity.  Corrupted Power Armor scorched would have been/could be sick.
---
How do you go about getting a job as an idea person?
---
The lowest level power armor youll be able to find thatll keep you remotely safe from rads is a T45 at lvl 25, but a hazmat suit will keep you 99% rad clean, cant equip armor with that though, if you can avoid getting smacked around thats your best bet however.
---
Once you level up consider getting level 1 of the charisma perk "rad sponge" then set it as a shared card, now any time youre in a team and near your teammates, the moment they pick up any rads youll start instantaneously healing your own rads every few seconds, zero maintenance or management required, its super helpful.
---
I want to dual wield 10mm smg and then get a pic of the fps block move with them crisscrossing the chest. I don't care if the left handed weapon is used. Also, why is there no love for those wierd people that are left handed. Nuttin but luv for ya'll, my wife, mother, and mother in law are all south paws. 
---
It's an online game. So yes. You can login to another computer with your account and have the same character.
---
They could add a tiny mic icon next to their name/health bar if they have one.
---
Also, we need an emote for laughter as that is something us humans do quite often...
---
I find it bizarre that this was missing from the game since the B.E.T.A.?
---
Happened to find the plan this weekend.  Learned it though.  On now if you want to pop on.  Just send me a PM.
---
Big badda *BOOM*
---
Eh, F76 is a game that has forced me to play with a system, this is part of that system. 
---
I also have a large loop searching for lead that takes about an hour before being able to do any "fun" gameplay so it's part and parcel for me.
---
It's a legendary weapon effect where the lower your health, the more damage you do.
---
Ah, I don't really use melee weapons and i have a couple of legendaries just sitting in my storage if you'd like some.
---
Nope, you owned a workshop.  You are in pvp mode.  Why would they have to contest it first to kill you?  Owning a workshop turns off your slap damage reduction plain and simple.  Contesting the workshop just means they intend to take it from you.  They can kill you and not take your workshop.  They can kill you then contest it.  They can just kill you.  There is even a warning that you are in pvp mode when you claim one.  The warning doesn‚Äôt include these extra provisions that everyone keeps assuming.
---
That movie was terrible, and full of plot holes.. 
---
What I learned at &gt;250 hours of gameplay and 4 characters past lvl 50..... You don't need a fine tuned build because the game isn't that hard.
---
Build a character that interests you. 
---
so I've been thinking about this (but haven't done research/created lore/etc. so I apologize in advance if this sounds critical) the challenge in a multiplayer game, either other people are going to see you fighting against nothing, or everyone has to be on a Wild Wasteland server to have the same experience. so big changes to enemies. locations and behavior are difficult.
---
BUT - the up-side here is, they can make one player see/hear one thing, and another player see/hear something else (e.g. we see containers we already looted as being open while other players see them closed). so changing out the form of enemies and weapons can be apparent to only the player who (has the Wild Wasteland perk enabled? who drank too much 'tainted moonshine?' who got infected by something?) 
---
lots of this is do-able and it's something I miss from FO:NV definitely. great work!
---
Also have it on ps4 if youd like me to make you one, however 1am here, will be on tomorrow sometime.
---
Same here! :) orbital strike them away, looks always awesome 
---
Stick to the Forest initially, it's the safest area and there's lots to do and explore. When you hit Level 15 you can wear Raider Power Armour. You can usually find a partial set at an old Raider camp in the north called The Crosshair.
---
Also pick up and scrap as many weapons as you can to learn mods.
---
Take over unclaimed Public Workbenches and defend them at least once. You'll get HP, plans and other rewards, like Stimpacks.
---
Use melee weapons to take down smaller, fast moving enemies (like the little Liberator robots, insects, ticks etc). Gun VATS is poor at close range, but good with melee
---
Damn. 275? I feel like it‚Äôs taken me forever to reach 20
---
I want a paint set that glows in the dark.  Actually more than one.
---
Or if vats could target based what you're looking at.
---
Let me tell you how fun it is to do a full 180 degree turn because I've entered vats and there was a vertibot within 50 miles.
---
You aren't fooling anyone, Todd! 
---
Pay for your market feedback like everyone else!
---
The more people tag a legendary enemy the better the chance someone will get a good drop. It just means that there's more out there to buy/sell and a better chance for you to get what you're looking for either by trading or from the drop itself. It should be common etiquette at this point in the game. Too strong to be able to not one shot? Punch the enemy with your fists. I did this when I was playing with some other players. Let them all get a shot in and then I killed it with my Deathclaw Gauntlet. I didn't get anything worth while but I hope they did.
---
The caps I would give for a faster swing speed anti armor drill üòÇ
---
Use a hazmat suit you can find 1 posidein energy plant I think
---
if you want to build a camp anywhere u want without affecting other players experience, you should stick to fallout 4.  
---
Read the whole thing! Great story!
---
Imagine when you have a mic, a small headset is automatically added to your characters in game model to reflect the fact you have an in game mic (with the option to turn it off and on)
---
I always run down stairs and close the door and pull the mobs out towards rhe tennis court.  
---
Works like a charm.  And we can always destroy the base to.  Lol
---
It would make my toilet time much more productive!
---
Same here ... when they fly up in the air I giggle ... don‚Äôt feel so silly about it now!
---
The one that said steal was probably not a Government drop. It was probably a shot down cargo bot you use to get Nuclear Keycards to launch a nuke. 
---
Another clueless player that blames the game. Fine, go play other games on your list then.
---
Does that give you a bounty
---
Claiming a workshop means other players can kill you.  It gives a warning but people keep on thinking they are safe until some other magical conditions in their head are met.
---
I would hold off till level 50... Get good p,a ect first i can help with that... Also have you done the quest line to register your handprint ext with the enclave ? 
---
Sad really. So much potential. It should offer a perk like the musical instrument chairs. Sitting in it temporarily boosts a resistance to energy weapons, or something.
---
It's an NPC, there are NPC's there just aren't any Human NPC's (yet).
---
How quickly you take rads is a combination of radiation resistance (shows up with a radiation icon on your STAT pip boy screen) and that power armor and hazmat suits also have some kind of unwritten additonal multiplier protecting from radiation that chems alone can‚Äôt provide.
---
The radiation resistance of just the frame is 60 if I remember right, while the best level 50 power armor pieces add up to a total around 500, and the hazmat suit is 1000.
---
I have no problems with it whatsoever. Granted, i also noticed the missing effects when it procs, however i still notice my AP bar filling up while on a VATS spree.
---
Recently started using a war drum, did not know it makes a nice sound when you give a good smack! Now I don't want to use anything else in melee.
---
Usually about 450 coz i drop a few lol 
---
harpers ferry is currently my favorite place to nuke for legendaries.  however it is much better for me (vats rifle marsupial) than my friend (melee non marsupial) cuz he cant just jump rooftop to rooftop and over walls lighting up enemies.  
---
I will not allow my 3\* Rolling Pin to be duped!
---
But... I have received 4 Hunter's Tire Irons in one day, thus making it look like a Duper was dumping them in Trashcans all over the Wasteland.
---
have you done the Enclave main quests? before you finish those you cant go in the silo, and the enemies are scaled for a level 50+. it‚Äôs an end game thing so at level 30 on your own it‚Äôs probably a bit too early
---
I have BOS combat helmet (Did this when first time scrapping a Bos Helmet) so basically when you scrap a modded item it gives you the plan to craft you have scrap (e.g ‚Ä¢Deep pocketed right armor) when you scrap it theres might be a chance you ll get that) but scrapping a new armor will just give you ordinary plans 
---
Either kill those who come to collect or let a friend take it 
---
Recordings run by computers that are still running 
---
You put a lot of work into this. I hope they contact you to see if they can use at least some of it.
---
Nice. I got a Zealot's Black Powder pistol with explosive damage as my first. Too bad I'm a Melee/Rifle build. My pistol toting friend will adore it though.
---
My friend groups staple poster is: "Lets go reLOOT America!" (And we have a "We're FOOD in this together" one)
---
Melee is an easy starter build. All it requires is 15 points in strength. My melee character uses swords, and no power armor because I needed to handicap myself to make the game interesting (1 handed melee weapons do less damage).
---
Sneak snipers do absurd damage. I had to stop using sneak attacks and switch from a guass to a railway rifle because again the game was to easy. (I also only run 1 level of each damage perk).
---
Vats crit, gun fu builds also do crazy damage. My cats crit char runs pistols because again rifles made it too easy.
---
Government supply drops that are called in via the holotapes are set to owned for the player that requested them.  Anyone else, it's marked as steal and you will receive a wanted status.  They just added this in the last update.
---
Stop listening to "stories" online and try something for yourself and see how it goes.
---
lvl 1 pipe rifles for all!
---
Yes,he is.When you claim a workshop it clearly warns you about that.OP wouldn't know that because he abused glitches until lvl 124 and now that's been fixed he tries to play normally 
---
feel your pain!
---
If your on xbox and need help dropping a nuke i can help.
---
But to be able to drop 1 u have to complete the enclave quests have you done that?
---
I think its Server based. I made the pumpkin one yesterday, then changed server to buy some items from another player and the quest triggered Again. Same happened to me many times in watoga hospital (cop a squatter quest or Something like that), even if i complete the quest, Server hop and go back to the hospital it will trigger Again (not always). So, to put it simple, at least to me, daily quests are Server based.
---
Computers, Recordings, Robots, Automated systems, etc.
---
NPCs exist in this game.  They are all just non-human.  We interact with an existing automated world filled with AI left behind by the dead people.
---
He can build a station,  read shower and stash without the turrets. 
---
Are you done with the Enclave storyline?  If not, do that first as you cannot get into a silo to launch a nuke.  If so, take the dungeon slow, clean but what you can, but enemies respawn pretty fast, so don't try to kill them all
---
Would you be targetting the Queen, or some other spot?  For the Queen, make sure there are some decently leveled players on the server, otherwise fighting her is going to be a pain.  Honestly at level 30, you're not going to be helping much.  The best thing you can do is tag the queen a few times, and then help clear the mobs she summons.
---
I don't think it's available in 76. 
---
Not done that all yet I am just roaming and doing quests as I see fit at a slow pace.
---
"Get good pa ect" ? Is that power armor what you mean? Because as a sneak sniper I don't use PA at all and I am not intending to to be honest since a sneak sniper and a PA just don't work I think. I want to be the deadly silent ninja. 
---
But thanks :) I'll start by waiting till I am level 50 atleast then. 
---
I've noticed the same thing. It was really annoying at first, spending all the ammo to clear places like Dyer Chemical only to find absolutely no cores. I've noticed I find them in ammo boxes that I search about as often as I find them spawned in the generators now. 
---
But, to be honest, it's gotten me out of the power armor and made me pay more attention to my load out and normal armor. It's actually been fun being a bit more stealthy and working out how to handle things without just running in full tilt wearing power armor. 
---
Most definitely i will happy supply orbital strikes free to anyone for the sole purpose of wrecking those bases üòé
---
Screen their name and sent it to Bethesda
---
Was just going to say that...and Bethesda really did a great job recreating it. 
---
This guy knows what's up. All these OP builds one shotting everything get boring real fast. Throw some QoL perks into the mix (travelling pharmacist, thru hiker, pharma farma, etc.) and the headache of weight management or lack of supplies just fades away.
---
Sneak and sniper wont work in the silos though 
---
personally id like all legendary effects removed from the game, i dont see how pvp will ever be balanced and enjoyable with legendary weapons and armor.  nerfing TSE alone is a bandaid on a severed limb
---
None of my friends play this game lol
---
I've never used the orbital strike yet I have 3 of them haha
---
Yes, don't come here moaning about how the game is unfair and people are cheaters and all that stuff. 
---
  Remember : this is an ONLINE game with a player vs player mode. Players can and WILL attack you or your stuff. Just understand this aspect and don't cry about it. Good luck !
---
Totally agree with this.  I also made a suggestion for a possible text to speech option: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ahyxh0/my_in_game_text_to_speech_suggestion/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
Thank you! My wife and i stumbled upon one the other day. Got sketched out and left it alone because it said steal and there had been a lvl 100 something Person there a bit before. Couldn't understand why it said steal
---
Power armor and a good mele or powerful non tse weapon is best due to tight confinement 
---
No doubt IAM level 109.  The last death claw legendary I killed was level 65.  I got a level 35 weapon!
---
Oh wow! You remember me. That's so cool. Thank you!

We know there are bugs we don't need another post after you play it 
---
Well I have died a couple of times and I don't want to lose Al my stuff again and again when dying and going back and crashing and losing everything. Also I have never ever witnessed a nuke because after a nuke gets anounced the game crashes, every single time.  So it is very hard for me to just see how it goes. 
---
Sometimes time isn't the limiting factor. Time remaining, progress bar (or both), where applicable should pop up when you hover over an event on map.
---
Watoga Med Center/Civic Center and AWOL Armaments.  
---
Ok, thanks. The game really needs to tell us this shit instead of making us ask on Reddit.
---
If it gave them a wanted level it was definitely a government supply drop.
---
A change listed in the patch notes from the last update was that supply drops are now locked for anyone but the person who called them and picking the lock gives you a wanted level.
---
This is a recent change that not everyone is aware of, you used to be able to grab loot from any cargo drop.
---
For cargobot that you shoot down, you still have to pick the lock but will not become wanted as it didn't belong to a specific player.
---
Especially call out his position if you run into strangers and you have a mic. I only go to that event anymore to try and get stuff for an alternate character I‚Äôm level 215 and I rarely run into anyone as high-level as me in there but I do encounter some level 30 to 50 guys packing two shot explosives and I try to at least use the area chat to tell them we don‚Äôt need to one shot it We can all get a hit in, last night was wholesome as shit lol two players right at level 40 were with me and I always give away the legendary stuff I get if it‚Äôs not something I want for my other character, and it‚Äôs usually not, anyway the two last night had regular guns so I had to carry them through the event mostly and I gave them what I picked up. That‚Äôs the most redeeming quality of the game in my opinion, or what I have the most fun with. They didn‚Äôt talk back to me but they could hear me and responded wth emotes after I‚Äôd call out the position of the legendary. 
---
you mean: C.A.M.P ?

I've been playing Slay the Spire- highly recommended.

Youre good. I was dumb and needed learned. Lol

Hmm, they sound like a human rather than an automated message, that is rather confusing.
---
Lol well leave your power armor at a train station or something and let a random collect the bounty üòÇ ... I have a fair few lol use them very often 
---
I‚Äôm not sure but mine was attached to my X-01 torso and somehow I managed to scrap the torso with mod attached. Absolutely gutted by I will get another, one day!
---
What are these TSE weapons and where can I get one?!
---
Did the guy become wanted after? 
---
So you don‚Äôt understand the pvp mechanics and then come on here to cry about them . Don‚Äôt want pvp ? Don‚Äôt claim workshops

Have an upvote just for your title.

i want to be a ghoul
---
It's actually an effective tactic to kneecap tougher enemies so they can't chase you down. 
---
They are not worthy and responsible to handle any tech. Though it seems nobody is using energy weapons these days, so most of our time can be spent exterminating mutants.
---
I later picked up a bunch of toys trying to go back in but the blast zone had ended and they got scraped. 
---
I'm currently starting the missions with rose and i think i need to take a step back and level grind some more
---
Berry Mentat for +5 Intelligence has this as a sife effect. Not sure if there are other items that do but it will fade over time.
---
Maybe I'll post pictures of my CAMP if I can ever figure Reddit out on that end. Really the reason I came off a blowhard, it's because the CAMP is an achievement in itself and really is a part of the immersion for my war machine build. Location, structure, and available resource. I'll probably never move CAMP on that character.
---
But yeah, shooting a missile at my baby will definitely bring the hammer down on your CAMP if I can see it from my artillery deck. He didn't know any better and it sucks, probably thought he'd clear a wall off my house and giggle off the server, but it's PvP.
---
You can grow your own adhesive. Get the white knight perk. Craft healing salve. Interact with other players. Do not rush the game. The first 50 levels are the most fun
---
Exactly. I‚Äôve played a lot of battlefield between Xbox 360 and PC, and I‚Äôd say probably 60 percent of the time I get in a squad with no mics. I get that some people have their own discord or whatever, just always seemed odd to me. 
---
I‚Äôve spoken to many people that have said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt afford it,‚Äù but they are sitting there playing a $30-$60 game. I‚Äôm just like ok you can but whatever. 
---
Thanks :). 
---
I need to do the enclave first I see will do.
---
Also thanks for the offering of  help but I choose to be alone. I only bought this game because Bethesda stated that you can play alone without problems it only might be a bit more difficult. If they said you would need a group I wouldn't have bought it to be honest. 
---
Dump them in the golf glue bags outside the whitesprings golf course for some fun
---
I picked up a Clean Space Suit Helmet in the game.
---
Yup didn't do it yet thanks for the info :)
---
You can have my falschnacht or whatever it's called.
---
Yeah, it's definitely not fun to find out the hard way.
---
Wearing underarmor reduces ur specs in PA. 
---
Vault jump works fine though.  
---
Every paint job you buy in the atom store should apply across all categories of power armor.
---
Can we leave wanamingos on the west coast? They scare me. 
---
Never realised this. Guess I should start reading warnings...
---
If you're going to build a camp in White springs do it over by the little pond that's labeled with snake on the map
---
Sounds like reasons to not do a thing tbh.
---
yes the servers are crappy atm and nukes are 50 / 50 if you get kicked of the server.
---
There's nothing to be scared off though, just put your junk in your stash before going into the nuke zone. Its not your junk till its in your stash anyways as someone could come along kill you and take it from you.
---
You do need to be up to the enclave part of the story though and work towards access. did my first nuke solo at lvl 38ish on my first character on a melee build. Was almost level 50 by the tie i came out of the first nuke zone (before the xp fix to the glowies in there).
---
So I have a game were I can choose to be what I want but only one thing works? Damn I need to restart and make a melee power House ?
---
If only you could loot them while they're still alive.
---
Ha ha  ha
---
See, my point. You are making assumptions that players don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúone shot‚Äù things. What keeps people playing the game is not ‚Äúgod‚Äù mode but rather getting to make the best of the game THEY want to play and not playing the way someone else thinks they should play. 
---
Works the same way in real life....
---
Some are traders, some role play, and others just explore and shoot stuff. They play how they want....same mistakes bungie made.
---
There is always 2 sides to the debate. They will lose players either way.
---
platform?
---
Yeah, it sucks. But meh. Guess you just have to work through the troubles. I wish welcome mats worked like they do on workshops. But nooooOOOOO. 
---
It had nothing to do with griefing, or exploiting. If you own a workshop, you are in full PvP mode while within the workshop's territory.
---
So going alone is not an option? 
---
They're doing a good job, We had a slow period through the holidays but each patch brings a TON of bug fixes and improvements along with minor changes. Once we start seeing most of the issues go away we will start to see new things more often.
---
No need to restart
---
Yus plz
---
The Fireman's Hat/Helmet that you get from the Firebreathers is the best I've seen.
---
If you're more concerned with looks, I could sell you one of my Beer Hats.
---
*shudders* thank you, but I will pass lol
---
I'd prefer otherwise. I don't like the -2 perception from all the protective masks. There are several I want to wear for appearance but I don't want the penalty. 
---
Do you sell your work online?  You should.
---
Probably duping closed the server. Or if you have bad internet.
---
Use Nukacrypt for the launch codes
---
You can launch a nuke on your own, sure.  You can't kill the Queen on your own unless you are abusing bobble heads.
---
They are quality AI / Messaging systems.  Some are playing recordings from long dead humans.
---
I think I had it in my inventory rather than my stash, but yes it was removed from my inventory after applying it.
---
It's Canon, not Cannon. Just a friendly note!
---
Sounds like you enjoy bitching. The game is on the upswing the with recent bug fixes and all the content that is on the way. 
---
Don't have bad internet. Wasn't a dupe. A dupe causes a server crash, not massive lag. Don't comment if you don't know what you are talking about.
---
I see it as defending your personal property. If someone shoots a mission at your house, they deserve whatever they get.
---
Running FO76 on a rotten potato
---
They fixed Swarm of Suitors two updates ago.
---
Bro. Are you mad about something? 
---
I'm fine with load screens if it means I'm not taking damage while I stand there waiting for my character to, yknow, load, but the past 2 or 3 days have definitely seen a spike in disconnects.
---
Cannibalism perk is mandatory for all wasteland funerals. 
---
Go bounty hunting, thats what i do. Level 164 just hopping servers and killing any wanted players
---
You need the complete set of matching armor and have it all at least in some sort of Condition that isn't broken otherwise you lose your weight bonus. 
---
I took the helmet off to wear the veil of mysteries and immediately became overencumbered even though it was in my inventory. There's no way around it as far as I can tell. Sorry, man
---
What? The extractors extract stuff and I can get said stuff? Or you just like extractors in general ?
---
It's a weapon perk "more damage the lower your health) I keep my health at about 50%. But really needs to be lower to hit those big numbers. 
---
erm by not using a mic surely they know you don't have one attached?
---
usually even if someone Isn't actually talking you can see the mic symbol as well from background interference etc so that shows they do have one...the lack of this symbol usually means they don't have one, are muted or not using voice comms at present.
---
I very much doubt people think your rude for not using voice comm's
---
The good side is by level 100 you can have 2 or 3 varied builds just in perk cards... Maybe a few points will need shifted but to be honest that's also easily done with leveling... After level 50 you can choose another new perk or swap a special point around... For now stay with the build you like definitely just gotta change up a little for the silo that's all really definitely not worth changing a full build just a case of swapping a perk or 2 putting on power armor and using a close quarter weapon to make it as smooth as possible... The silo is super tedious 
---
Had the same issue yesterday, killed the queen,no loot and no exp. Only event reward 
---
Seems like it was overdone. I have seen at least 4-5 running generators and none of them have had a fusion core. 
---
Butcher Pete and the Two Left Handers 
---
Harpers is an area with rotating enemies. Scorched super mutant and ghoul. If you nuke it while in its ghoul phase there are plenty of bloated glowing ones. Also I've harvested hardened masses from turrets and liberators. Add in the chem bench behind the vendor and you can craft stable flux in the nuke zone as you gather. Or sell to the vendor. The best part is the low number of players. Whitesprings and sbq get too crowded. Nuke anywhere else and you got the place pretty much to yourself after the initial surge.
---
You can sneak sniper part of the silos, but its hard.  Spec into Enforcer (agility) and carry a shot gun.  Aim for the bot's legs and disable them and then run by.  I am a sneak sniper as well and it works pretty well for me.
---
You dont even know what you're talking about. Dont have to be a dick about suggestions.
---
Who doesn't have a mic in 2018
---
Playstation is a rotten potato 
---
Although it should be Anti-Materiel 
---
Inside the hotel itself, there's a whole hallway of little themed gift shops. About 500 vendors in a row. Okay, more like a dozen. They share the same cap pool with each other (and the station vendor) for selling, but they all have their own inventories for buying.
---
But you DON'T have to be in a group to fight her with every one else there. 
---
As long as you do damage to her and are in the area when she dies you will (you should lol bethesda) get credit for the kill and loot.
---
I suggest we address this right away! (Sorry, couldn‚Äôt help it)
---
Come one be realistic, that will never work!
---
*Drinks 30 vodkas in 5 seconds*
---
They said they'll fix this issue in the next update.
---
LVL 50, never seen a nuke up close. Assume it‚Äôs cool?
---
cant wait for assassin sentinal armor to be nerfed just like the TSE.  buying duped items for ur pvp build should not be the endgame, and really where is the fun in just standing still waiting to one shot players who get close enough?
---
Ah thanks. I'll think I just keep roaming and reading and doing missions till I am level 50. 
---
And maybe they changed some things up to make it a bit easier for solo players by then. Or changed some things up so that you indeed can be what you want to be instead of a meleebuild or a have a tse.
---
Or maybe by then I have found a tse myself :)
---
It blends right in. If I encountered this in the wild, it would be hard to tell its a camp. 
---
Incoming long rant, apologies. I tend to avoid Uranium Fever when there are a lot of lowbies nearby, more often than once I get verbally harassed by them not being able to tag a legendary. I have a TSE and I usually signal to them follow me if there's a legendary but usually with some they want to tag everything, every mob and this leads to the extractors being broken and me repairing them. 
---
There was this one event where I let 2 lowbies run around since they wanted to tag everything. A level 28 and 30, I think. Both friends, both gave me the thumbs down whenever they can just because I was one hitting mobs who were ganging up on the extractors. We failed the event and I used probably 120 steel. They then said on mic that i was a noob high leveled player. I wanted to kill them but I didn't.
---
So note to the lowbies as well, join any event but please be competent to do your part instead of just tagging. This is also a problem with Scorched Earth who just tag and run.
---
The creatures from far harbor being in there really irked me, as did the lack of sentient ghouls and surprisingly level of idiocy amongst the enclave.
---
Everything else though, was really well worked into the lore.
---
The lost hills bunker most certainly was big enough to have a sat array, the enclave were born from sects of the US govt so the whitesprings bunker makes sense.
---
Check completed sales. 
---
It's even more fun when you do it to a death claw.
---
Till they'll fix it next patch, I always drop mods to the paperbag and then craft/build anything. I risk loosing them, but leaving them in the stash I'll lost them 100%...
---
this is so cool but you got me thinking - the challenge in a multiplayer game, how do you handle what you see/hear/do versus what other players see you doing?
---
I guess up-side is, for minor differences they can make one player see/hear one thing, and another player see/hear something else (e.g. we see containers we already looted as being open while other players see them closed). so changing out the form of enemies and weapons can be apparent to only the player who (has the Wild Wasteland perk enabled? who drank too much 'tainted moonshine?' who got infected by something?) but bigger changes to bosses/locations would only be available to certain players (this could also work for areas like mines and buildings where technically each player could go to their own unique location). or we have fast-travel options other people don't have, to places that only exist in WW mode.
---
Are you on xbox ? 
---
Hey guys, major bug here. Whenever I choose a new perk the point is allocated to strength instead of the perk I chose from a different SPECIAL like Charisma. Now I have 7 strength and 1 of each other and only 2 strength perk cards because I haven‚Äôt been choosing them. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Please help. 
---
This sounds a comforting. I almost thought that Bethesda lies and shoved a game down my throat I can't play alone.  But this really sounds great. Thanks KS for clearing this up.
---
The difference is Russians can eliminate everything with drinking, mostly themselves (30% of all deaths), and they are probably born with rad worms. 
---
Yikes! Those enemies seem really high for that area of the map, even if there is a higher level player around. I don‚Äôt do workshops because I try to avoid PVP. Could the levels be so high because it is a defend the workshop event or something like that?
---
I ultimately decided to head to the Ash Heap to do some side quests and gain experience before trying to finish Top of the World. This has been working well, particularly because I increased my sneak and found a better sniper rifle.  But, those mole miners are terrifying!
---
But are they fixing the losses ? This bows. 
---
...a 5-8 year old playing FO76? Online 13+ game? ...Am I the only one who cannot get passed that?

The scanners have a keypad that you are supposed to press whilst your hand is scanning, it'd likely be more awkward the other way round.

&gt; don't forget the schools. 
---
That's what I came here to say. Morgantown High School and Watoga High School both have ludicrous numbers of plastic odds and ends all over the place. Plaastic plates, cutlery, halloween decorations, etc. 
---
Yes please. Also pick an enemy that is close to me and in my cone of vision. Makes me dizzy with all the spinning around to target an enemy that isn't even engaged yet.
---
If you take out a leg on a Radscorpion they can't burrow.

Swing Speed doesn't effect regular attacks of very fast weapons.

IRC, they were also plagued by the workforce being replaced by bots. I think the staff during the renovation was going to be bots.
---
Probably bobble head stacking. It happens. Just change servers. I pvp all of the time and run into this on occasion. 
---
Gtfo this game is trash and willI always br idiots like you defend it until the end
---
Probably the stacking of explosive bobble heads and a TSE weapon.
---
Which Bobblehead for being untouchable though?
---
Just because you've never experienced the bug, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Also, if you read my other comments further down you can see I don't "enjoy bitching".
---
And their defence?
---
I already cant kill them with my heavy weapons character, using the gatling. I'd honestly have no reason to go there if it were harder than ever.
---
Alrighty. I can't comment about Fallout 4. I never saw the bug while playing the game. 76 is based on 4, so I would think that it was the same. Seeing it in 76 reminded me of doing exactly the same sort of stuff in Second Life to make dragon avatars, quadruped avatars and such.
---
I still would like a full blown one but I'll look into it
---
I will try that. Now at level 30 I upgraded all my guns and sniper on Max and I almost use my sniper for everything. Even up close it works great. 
---
I do have a shotgun also maxed out but it hardly does any damage compared to the sniper. I already removed the silencer but a Supermutant costs me atleast 4 shotgun bullets up close while my sniper from up lose without aiming still one shots them in the head or two shots them in the body. 
---
The best other weapon I have is my silenced pipe pistol but it still is not as great as my sniper even from up close which honestly I don't understand. 
---
i happen to me when i have high fov, but when is low it dont

Guess this is why in 250+ hours I've only had to really repair my PA's maybe 3-4 times. That condition bar never really goes down for me.
---
You have endurance, agi, and str. Op when stacked. Stacking explosive with an explosive weapon at a high enough damage will allow you to 1 hit non pvp players. 
---
Should be some kind of a head with a zipper at the mouth!
---
Me and my group do.

I‚Äôm down for it. Skin mod for golf club

I always use the "follow me" emote if I find it first. Makes it easy for the other players to quickly see the emote bubble pop up and follow it.

No clue but its not just the explosive bobble heads, i think the same thing works with all Bobble heads and Magazines.

Cool. Screenied their name. Will email Bethesda later. üëç

Check your " stored" tab, delete anything you dont remember putting in there personally.

Also, check " blueprints" for duplicates.

Always delete wires before deleting the object that was wired.

Generally agree, however, Power Poseidon is much more worth it now that the fusion core generator pumps out 100% cores like a boss. Here's the strat, it takes no more than 10 minutes to clear this event, I've done it in as little as 7. Capture the workshop, go to the outside tower first and repair all the pipes and the two control panels at the top. All of the pipes except one are accessible from the scaffolding on the middle level. At this point you will likely have "defend the workshop" event, finish that, then go into the other tower and get five or so more pipes to finish basic repairs. Go into the building from there, kill the four scorched and then jump into the pipe, follow it to the generator room and click on pipes and control panels there, this takes very little time as the pipes and panels are dense, once you repair that, take the ramp out to the upper level catwalk and go to the reactor chamber door, Hacker L1 required, pop the door and then hit the first pipe, go straight and then follow that ramp around to the top, you'll get several pipes and panels along the way, at the top, jump over the rail to get the pipe above the ramp you just walked up, then fall down and go down one more level, take the left into the dark hall, repair the pipe on the left and then go down to the bottom there you'll pop control panels and a couple more pipes until the generator is complete. Follow that around to the ramp on the other side that takes you back to the first catwalk back out to the control room down just one level outside the reactor room. Kill the two turrets and 4-8 enemies there, then restart the reactor. Fast travel back to the workshop. I usually put the welcome mat down so that I spawn directly in front of the fusion core generator. Drop a stash box, put a couple rocket launchers on top of the generator and lock the generator. Took me about as long to type all that as it takes to actually do it!
---
I have another one that says "Loot Virginia"
---
Np üëçüèª. Get their asses
---
It‚Äôs not stealing if you drop a paper baggy. Ever.
---
I always wait for tags. Nothing gets away 
---
From my tse dragon. Sometimes i panic shoot bc i want the lootm but that mostly with a Bpr or sniper. 
---
Get the code from nukacrypt site (they're resetting today) and the rest is easy - I've lunched nuke in the weekend, alone (I'm 107) it took me 20 minutes max (it was my first time ever to nuke, watched one tutorial to know, more or less, what to do). Shame, that server disconnected me minute after the queen spawned :( Luckily, within the hour, I joined other's Prime Fissure nuke and killed the queen with them in few minutes.
---
Under strength there is a perk that makes fusion cores not drain from sprinting, idk if this is what is helping me but I‚Äôm a melee PA and I do not go through cores nearly at the rate you are saying 
---
I do the same! But I giggle and mock them over the mic. "Did I hurt your leg. Are you trying to chase me? Mwuhahaha." I guess I'm weird like that. 
---
Not sure if it's in game or not but alot of people would probably enjoy getting a Never Ending full auto weapon tbh
---
Bethesda, just add the chat system please.
---
Yeah it makes me super sad for the world lol -- and yes, NPC's would have, or should have!!  It's funny though, listening to YouTube how-to's (because I'm a noob to Fallout in general) and hearing people pronounce the areas around here is cute.  They would not understand how we pronounce them until they heard it haha
---
Sad thing is the ghouls in that area are supposed be low enough level for you to take out easily. Thanks a lot xp farmers
---
I built there because, storywise at least (I'm one of those people who tries to play as if I am the character) it's the safest place to build. I'm near one of the golf holes (not sure which one, and couldn't point it out on a map) so that the only enemies near me are constantly attacked by the Assaultrons that patrol the area.
---
Meanwhile, my house has a stream for fresh water, lots of green grass and good land for planting crops, and I don't have to build a single turret.
---
This too. One shot to each arm, then I turn and walk away so they explode behind me. Yes!
---
Sadly I've never seen a legendary at end game level from the event so I stopped frequenting it. But yeah that instant murder of the supervisors is really annoying.
---
Up !  Fallout Market has just been shared by Bethesda France on Twitter and Facebook :)
---
 Now available on Android  -&gt; [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appli.fogen](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appli.fogen) (card soon translated) 
---
Yeah me neither.  But hey, I don't mind - their loss ;)
---
And it gives you more Damage resistance, and energy resistance, which is the real winners here.
---
Owwww! My leg! Haha.
---
That sucks. :\\
---
Bone Hammers tend to show up at R&amp;G Station and Sunnytop Station.  They don't seem to be particularly amazing, unless there's just something I'm missing.
---
if I walk up say hi if they don't respond I say if you can hear me do the thumbs up icon if nothing I assume they can't hear me and walk off
---
We need a "check the bag on the floor, the paper bag on the floor. Check the f*#king paper bag on the floor. Where are you going?! I dropped stuff for you, in the paper bag on the floor. Goddamn noobs" emote
---
I read these posts all the time and think, there is no limit of servers.. soooo?
---
If I see a person doing this, I say good luck and move on. 
---
Gee that was easy.
---
It‚Äôs not an issue until you make it one.
---
Lol I dislike when people compare themselves/their ideas to developer who worked hard for years to get to where they are. I see posts like this recommending ideas/changes to 76 all the time. Unless this were a coded demo, serious concept art created for 76, and/or had some serious background in game development/game design, this really means next to nothing to a developer. So unless you put years into studying how games work and are designed, fan ideas don't mean much. 
---
Pace yourself. 
---
if you team people you get loot even if you don't hit the enemy (or should) it fixes the issue 
---
My pirate character agrees with this! I've been using sunglasses...but it's not the same.
---
I have a plasma flamer I use that has the vampire trait.  It is useful but the regen seems weak.
---
&gt; Don't just jump in and power level like most people
---
This. Not all, but most people bitching about there being nothing to do made it their goal to exploit the xp glitch and level as fast as possible and then whine that the game has no content for them. 
---
Legendary robots are the real loot game.  Get your stuff before they go boom.
---
to be fair, the pvp mechanics are not very well spelled out or documented.  that being said i really only pvp via workshops, fighting over a workshops have been the best pvp experiences ive had in 76.  it feels more natural and immersive than the broken wanted/revenge system, where the wanted persons teammate just keeps collecting the caps as they continue to destroy player camps.
---
Since the little cloth ones protect without a penalty, I think they should all protect without penalty.
---
Agree on your first point. I use pacifist for the second point.
---
I don't use melee that much it just the only othe decent one ive got
---
Afaik, INT doesn't affect the maximum cond possible, but the length of the "secondary line". And the only difference in defense appears if there's a "secondary line" or not. Int basically doesn't matter at all.
---
No.... No mutated spiders .... I'm out!  ( For real though, amazing work!)
---
I understand it could be cut content I get your point there. Just not very reassuring if this is what they had in mind for future content from the beginning
---
Yeah some sort of easy communication other than voice would be nice. I started a new character this weekend so Im very low level. And I want to play solo with this one. I kept getting repeated team requests from this one guy and didn't know how to nicely tell him that I wasn't interested in teaming up. He was so persistent that I changed servers.  I was also paranoid that due to my low level, they may have thought I was a mule character and wanted to find and kill me.
---
Same. I, ashamedly, use vats more often than I should. Doesn‚Äôt seem to affect my cores, well not noticeably that is. I have the same perk active. 
---
no way to get them back, sadly. At the moment, if you have the junk bulked that you intended to use to build with, un-bulk it. It will look at mods first before breaking down bulked material. Also, there is another issue from the latest patch where when crafting, you have to have the materials on you vs. being in your stash. As a side note, until it is fixed, craft a slow pace and read the confirmation screen of materials, it will tell you where it's getting the mats from.
---
Please give me a "it's broken" emote 
---
Everytime I do certain events and I already know they are broken but other players keep throwing up question marks. So if we have that emote we can inform eachother beforehand if a quest is broken. Thanks 
---
Yes, it's working as intended.  VATS drains AP outside of PAs, and inside PAs, VATS drains your core.  Pretty much anything that consumes AP will drain your core.
---
It's the VATS, it really is. I don't really run much in PA anyway. But as a VATS sniper/rifle build I spend most of my combat either in VATS or firing on enemies while waiting for Action Points to regain. Gun-Fu takes that to a new level and I spend longer amounts of time in VATS so whenever it drops out of VATS the fusion core is making visible drops each time.
---
I did and it's beyond me who some have sales, even saw items with several dozen sales.      
---
And a $20 TSE Handmade which a poor soul bought - one of the most duped weapons, barely worth 1-2k caps.
---
Oh hell yeah it does. 
---
We have done a LOT of experimentation on it. It makes a huge difference, and if you can get to the 40s, the RNG can't give you anything less than Max.
---
For picking up items Luck determines max Cond.
---
So that's why they always expire so quickly! Perhaps they should fix the game before they give us penalties for logging out. Is this also the case for dog meat? Because I've lost stacks of the stuff when I've logged off to have lunch irl and come back an hour later to cook it.
---
Well honestly I play on the Xbox 1.0 so I assumed I‚Äôd experience any legitimate hardware/framerate issues before most people. Shockingly I‚Äôve done really well. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôve had less than 5 CTD problems since beta.  I see a lot of posts about beasts being ‚Äúbroken‚Äù but it‚Äôs always concerning their targeting and how they can lose line of sight and still track you etc, never heard a complaint about them causing hardware issues until today (aside from events like fort defiance with so much going on you can easily lose some FPS)
---
Watch out if you do this! I don‚Äôt think the container is instanced to another server if you were to leave and join/disconnect!
---
Is that like the bug where you randomly lose ammo when you pick flowers or mine ore and stuff?
---
Laser weapons generally are under powered.  Plasma weapons had a terrible bug at launch that seldom occurs now.  Plasma gatlings break fairly quickly, weapon durability perks help so they an be useful, but they still break more quickly than most other things.  Plasma weapons do decent damage with the proper perks, but upkeep and ammo crafting can be a chore for some.
---
I do events all the time. I don‚Äôt have that issue. That would allow players to just fast travel regardless of weight and that would break the game. Many events are near train stations. You could intentionally farm until you are overweight and fast travel near a train station. You might as well remove the fast travel restriction at that point.
---
The horde ones are just eh, tracking wise. Sometimes if there‚Äôs nothing there, it‚Äôll take 5+ minutesof walking around before the game says that it‚Äôs not the source. Other times, it‚Äôll just say it the second I step foot into the radius. 
---
Plus, I think they need to up the spawn rate of Patrol Duty. I‚Äôve seen it once since I started playing the game. Even server hopping to find it doesn‚Äôt really work well.
---
I have a loop looking for weapons to sell. I visit Whitesprings first, however now it takes me twice as long as some selfish player parks their camp with the sole purpose of mopping up all the junk at the expense of XP. I used to go up nearly 1 level there, now it takes a server hop, and even then I may end up on the same server as the selfish player again. It's quite obviously why the player does it, as all there are is platforms with turrets pointing into the back of the hotel. I spawn in and they get all the spawn that was supposed to be for me. Yet they get no XP for it, and neither do I thanks to them!
---
Timezone?
---
They are two different things. 1st is bobble heads, a glitch where they are added together vs. refreshing the timer. 
---
The second one is Sentinel armor. If they stack that, you can't damage them when they are standing still unless they run out of AP points (everytime you hit them they lose a little AP. If you can stagger them from a power attack on a melee or something heavy duty, you will also be able to damage them.
---
Like previous comments I think he initiated PVP by taking the Workstation, it's worth tactic but would explain being one-shotted.
---
I'm lvl 99 and came across a griefer last night harassing a lvl 25 and 36, hitting them to initiate PVP then using their TSE shotgun, I watched and he tried the same on me but I didn't flinch so he just started unloading into me, did nothing. He was lvl 78, he was getting quite irate.
---
Nah, entirely a cosmetic thing.  You don't need amazing to thump level 5 ghouls farming forest events!
---
hate to kill the party but i've always had this thought in the back of my mind too, it's a great concept though
---
Well when you‚Äôre getting SHOT by a TSE it‚Äôs really clear cause you hear two fucking bullets so why would we quit calling TSE...TSE? If people are discussing other explosives they typical refer to them as things like...mini nuke, orbital beacon, a grenade...
---
Sounds like you lost 20% dmg buff along the ways.
---
Melee bobblehead expired? 
---
Really, then why are we so fancy about this event?
---
That‚Äôs life in the Zone. 
---
I did it with a random person and we were using the thumbs up emote after we each tagged it.
---
Eastern standard 
---
As part of that, they really should have removed the "Get the Cargo Drop" Misc. quest for anyone except the player who called it.  Generally, objectives don't tell you to do things that give you a Wanted level.
---
Hey Todd Howard, we know this is your writing 
---
I never find a legendary in the emergency services, where is it usually?
---
Pharma Finder, Chemist, Super Duper, Ammosmith - use these perks and the stims/ammo you lost will seem like chump change 
---
Best you can get I think will be a Quad sized mag.
---
I wish I could find a lightweight mic like this without the speaker, that would be absolutely perfect.  Something presenters at a conference would use or something.
---
Thank you for the idea I‚Äôll do some searching ;)
---
I am at work. You can add me TheMeiserVader
---
I've played this game for almost 200 hrs, dropped countless nukes, killed several scorchbests, lvl 50+ and still haven't found any form of TSE weapons. It's not a reward for the players who grind out more game. It's a broken mechanic that relies mostly on RNG/luck and it needs to be changed. It's got high level players congesting low level areas of the map (like whitespring) to abuse the high spawn rates.
---
‚ÄúHey guys did you get the new Birdbox¬Æ emotes and C.A.M.P.  items?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, it only cost me 7300 atoms!‚Äù
---
What kind of dressing do you prefer? Ranch or French? 
---
I just want paint for one thing and I am happy. I am level 30 and yest I have not one single weapon I can paint. I am starting to think I am doing something wrong.
---
Discount the fast travel price to events, *unless* you're over encumbered. 
---
Otherwise, too easy to abuse
---
I have been playing Bethesda game for a decade. I know how to shut up.
---
&gt; only Two Shot is being nerfed
---
[That is incorrect. They change their notes to reflect that both will e nerfed.](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/1pB3jkcq5unlYTB3TTURrZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-17-2019)
---
Try r/fo76filthycasuals it is a better sub
---
Just keep trying. It'll unlock eventually.
---
Good to know. Thanks.
---
Austin_F5
---
I do that too. ‚ÄúDoes it hurt?üò•. Does it hurt?üò•‚Äù.  That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt play with a mic 
---
If you got the strategy guide you can see a legendary effect in it called never ending, however it was replaced with quad. 
---
Its my point of view, looking on scorchbeasts wishing they were programed to land sometimes was not the way i want to go. Yeah blodied is strong, but you will die fast even with best gear. Also you must run to each mob. It is anoying overtime. I didnt notice we are talking about leveling. I did first 20lvls with 5hunting rifle.
---
And i think nobody have exact answer for question which build is meta? That is in title, nor do I. Wanna try some vats-crit sniper now, but there are no more dupers and trading good weapon becoming imposible lol. 
---
I've only seen people refer to two shot explosive weapons as TSE, other weapons with explosive always have their prefix, like instigating explosive or quad explosive. 
---
I use vats though for melee and it doesn‚Äôt drain my fusion cores, is why I‚Äôm saying the sprint perk under strength might be something combating that?  Max luk melee str for that mysterious stranger/bloodied mess/lucky break 
---
OP is cancerous, whitesprings farming cancerous; I laugh very loudly at people who spend so much time there, camping and/or farming. Actually I prefer you all stay there, please do.
---
CrazyCammy93 welcome to join us and come see me i can stock you up 
---
Nah man I ain't complaining. I been buttfucked in about every genre of multi-player games.
---
Thanks people really appreciated 
---
Can you do this all the time? I thought you needed a perk for that.
---
Do you guys have mics ??
---
Quests overall make no sense :‚ÄúFind person XY/ Meet Person XY‚Äú when you know before even starting the game: There are no NPCs to this world so ofc you‚Äôll find a dead body or only a note. 
---
Beth, if you‚Äôre not planning to implant NPCs change at least some of the quests. 
---
I still think the best thing for the Atom Store to do is sell us a shit-ton of reskin options, like colour changes and clean versions, of outfits that already exist in the game.
---
If the recipe would need the dirty/ standard version it would feel less like cheating, but that might be just me.
---
eg you can find a dirty grey suit on game, but if you bought the suit bundle for 50 Atom Caps you can turn it into a clean grey suit, or a clean black suit, or a camo suit etc.
---
I liked those T-shirts that were free in the Fallout 4 Creation Club. Let us turn the boring white T-shirts into whichever of those we like.
---
this is my second toon, i botched my build at lvl 86 so i started over
---
i hate pvp as well, if some one takes my bench i let them have it lol
---
doing it for the plans, xp and resources :P

\[I lost my "All Rise" at login.\]
---
Today when I logged into the game and set my character for out in the wastes for some combat and exploring.
---
At my first encounter I drew then Black Diamond but then I decided to switch to the all in. I usually press a number to switch weapon, but nothing happend. Then I scrolled with the wheel and saw that where the "All Rise" used to be there was another symbol. A "Left arm piece for Excavator armor".
---
I finished the small fight and turned my focus to my inventory - Only to discover my endgame "All rise" hammer was gone! And a quick glance could also tell there was no extra spare piece of an excavator armor.
---
I fast traveled back to my camp and looked in stash box. No "All Rise". I was so disheartened I logged off.
---
A little while later I decided to log on again. I hoped it was a temporary bug - So I scrolled the mouse wheel. But no. No hammer. Not even the "Left arm from the excavator armor" showed.
---
From what I've heard, Bethesda can't give items to accounts. So now I have no options of ever obtaining my hammer again :'(
---
It shows you nothing of materials when building camp. Nothing was bulked and had plenty of everything.. this is absolute bullshit and I fucking hate it 
---
Serious answer, everyone around you. If you're one shotting everything before people can even get a single hit in, they get no EXP or loot.
---
Again, I understand this is more the game designs fault than anything else, but it's not hard to just not be a dick either
---
Mesmetron existed before the war iirc; where the hell do you think they got that and the bomb collars?
---
Did you think they made them?
---
3rd floor near the stair case to the roof.  Will sometimes spawn as a crown though.
---
Can you post screen shots? I have yet to see this in game. 
---
There are a number of videos on how to set up such a build.  With teh proper weapon (Bloodied prefix in the name) you trade you HP for a damage buff.  There are perk cards that make sustaining low HP easier (and some mutations too).  A lot of folks use it around 50% health, some few use it 20% health (glass canons). Not really recommended until you get the needed perks.  I don't run it myself.
---
This happened to me yesterday loading in from fast travel. Respawned and the mystery rad source was gone.
---
How do you find the trade interface confusing? This is a genuine question, not an insult.
---
Yeah the change confused me too, and you are absolutely right about the quest. I was under the impression that anyone who went to the cargo drop got loot, so you weren't really stealing.
---
The other thing that annoys me about this is that it pushes people towards PvP which is still pretty broken. You would think they would hold off on that kind of behavior until it is in a better state
---
The only thing I can think of that would explain this is there was some kind of exploit or abuse I that was using this and the change was made to block that. I wouldn't know, I have only ever called one cargo drop and have a stack of unused requests.
---
I believe still using explosives expert perk though is still going to make it OP
---
Chance for LvL 40 loot? Maybe they have another character they are getting weapons for.
---
One glove? Like an angry Michael Jackson.
---
What I mean is will the new game mode force you to start from scratch? Therefore any characters made before this mode are not allowed to be used, ie your PVP alt character
---
Vats/Sneak seems to be the build of choice for pvp.
---
You ever use a plasma gatling? They completely break after 2-3 reloads.
---
Astro helmet in atom store has air protect but no penalty. FYSA
---
I think people make the mistake of believing SLAP is still in effect.
---
I'm curious what is the difference in resists between say an intelligence of 12 and that of 35 with unyielding? 
---
I‚Äôve seen that! It blocked my wife from entering Ingram mansion.
---
I‚Äôd sure like spiky topped walls for my camp, now that I think about it.
---
I know what you mean about Fortnite. 
---
Huh, I did not know that. The level scaling seems to be a bit wonky in some zones I guess.
---
Oh they are and i do use those perks, thats not the point. Shit fusion cells are trash or my build. This post has three objectives:
---
Venting when this happened.
---
Warning folks about assaultron head
---
Short cutting belly of the beast
---
Thanks for trying to help though. Farming the supplies is the fun part of the game, these missions (most, not all)are not.
---
I was set up in the cliffs by Monongah. But since people have been bringing nuking there to attention more, I had to move my C.A.M.P. out of the way since it was in the radius. Glad I moved now that i know.
---
But my new location is a bit closer to top of the world, which I've occasionally seen people trying out. But it looks like that might not br avgteat place either now. 
---
I have Tesla Coil on my Excavator, most of the time I just run around and tag everything, then run to a distance or on top of something. if someone is in trouble I get out my shotgun, and cripple the legs, then they're there lying on the ground, ripe for the picking!
---
Good idea. Let's add post boxes for our camps, and the ability to drop off or post gifts/ trades to each other too.
---
another post wanting an easy game to be even easier smh
---
I would at least like a few paints that you stumble upon in a plan.  It's so annoying to go to build on your workbenches and keep seeing the empty paint add-on. Are there paints out there? Am I just missing them?  Also, when someone accidentally removes the prototype armor paint, please make it able to return. I didn't know it doesn't come back so I lost "prototype" paint on half my PA set. 
---
Eh, you're a bad developer if you don't take ideas into consideration - no matter where they come from. I edit videos and I have my friends give me feedback. They don't anything about editing but they know what a good video looks like.
---
Sure would be great if Bethesda would fix the VATS strobing bug. Not sure if people are experiencing it on other platforms (I'm on Xbox One)  but I've tweeted footage a couple of times.
---
Also interested, not sure if it‚Äôs a boost to only the explosive dmg OR if it‚Äôs a boost to the entire weapon bc it‚Äôs explosive? 
---
This game makes me hate gaming. 
---
idgaf about caps. I always TSE the base at whitesprings. come at me bro
---
Ho, man. I paralised so many enemies. I should feel bad but i can't stop laughing at the poor robot crawling and burning and he still tries to kill me.
---
If your L100 or so like I am I usually have 20 - 30 perk points spare to spend at a time so if your a high level I would get the perk cards other wise I'd wait till after the nerf to see how badly it affects them.
---
No matter how many people you sign up, they will never let you into the vault.
---
Thank you very much. However I really want to play most of this game alone. Please don't take this the wrong way I really appreciate it but I want to be the lone wanderer :).
---
Not to mention that a lot of this stuff is in other Fallout games already, not stuff the author came up with themselves. I do like some of the event ideas though.
---
A Carryable small Cooking station, Sleeping mat and a Campfire. to many times has my Meat and Vegies gone bad (even with the Good with Salt Perk granted not maxed but still) before I've either gone back to my Camp or found a random Cooking Station in the world.
---
Being Able to Fast travel to Train Stations for free. They are basically hubs for players........kinda
---
Gramm to be more easily findable. At Least have him follow some kinda route. Maybe spend nights at Train Stations.
---
this!
---
Oh man - only Two Shot as a prefix mod, not the other prefix mods.
---
We all play solo most of the time my build is all solo lol 
---
 but sbq and nuke zones are best with a team to get the most from it 
---
Cause there are people that assume any explosive weapon non grenade type is from a TSE.
---
You generally move faster without it, but you can sprint in PA at an increased AP drain, but there are perks for that.  With Pain Train perk you can damage/stagger a lot of mobs just by sprinting into them in PA.  Add reactive plates and rusty knuckles mods for an 'unarmed' brawler build.
---
Sadly this is still happening after the January 14, 2019 patch on PC
---
Let me also add that the feral golfer ghouls only seem to spawn at low levels. With so many high-end players building camps and farming legendaries in the area it means these ghouls become incredibly difficult to find. I'm sure I'm not the only player who ended up abandoning this quest as a result.  
---
Personally I think Bethesda need to rethink Whitesprings as it's not being used by players they way they originally designed it to be.
---
I got a Furious Utracite Laser Pistol from the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
The 2 sides are heavily unbalanced though. It's 1 ignorant base vs 10+ players who wish to just get on with it.
---
Certain areas can be very busy though. I currently do much of my farming as im building up to level 30 around the railroad station next to Posideon nuclear power plant, the grafton monster spawns there super often
---
Any point to visiting them before the Enclave nuke quests?
---
I need to compile the rest of the list of PA at max level. I did the T-series, Ultracite, and X-01 armors. I need to add in Excavator and Raider for completion purposes so that I can show my friends who play the numbers and let them decide what works best.
---
Personally I'm living that T-51 jetpack and calibrated shock life. RadShield, Rad-X, RadAway and the decontamination shower are all handy in covering for or dealing with the lack of rad resist.
---
Calm down. Don't get your leather armor in a bunch.  I'm sure it was just ment to be a funny comment.
---
Ahh crap my b 
---
It is not in the game. I think they replaced it with the "Quad" weapon legendary effect (4x clip capacity). Bottomless clips would be pretty OP in PVP situations.   
---
I have quad revolver right now and it's hilarious to reload 6 bullets and be able to fire 24 lol.
---
Start buying Nuka-Grapes from duplicators and selling them for a profit, creating a business so big you need a storefront, and eventually a trading empire that you are the center of. Kingpin this whole operation from a smurf account; no paper trail. Scam a kid. Scam two. Get max caps and then do it again all between the hours of 12-7 am EST. Bend 76‚Äôs economy *around* your soda cartel. Assume the role of... Pablo Grapescobar.
---
Sorry for your loss. I had a similar experience twice as described here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aeybza/gear_vanished_upon_disconnect/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
I think it's going to be hard to get attention on this because there's so many bugs, and people accidentally scrap or sell gear all the time and say it disappeared. 
---
The amount of detail you put in is outstanding and everything is laid out perfectly, well done!
---
Raise another character. Get all rise. Transfer via a friend to your main. Yay, all rise.
---
[I'm having the same issue on Xbox One.](https://twitter.com/p0cketcandies/status/1087149851379421185) It makes gameplay impossible until it decides to sort itself out. It's completely random and doesn't matter what weapon I'm using. 
---
www.enclavedb.net
---
Can someone send this to Bethesda please? 
---
3\* instigating, 100% vats for 50%, 10%+ dmg when ADS tesla rifle can do absurd sneak chain damage. 
---
I would agree that they are poorly documented.
---
Taking a Workshop warns that you're entering PvP, but it doesn't really explain in what capacity.  I had always assumed that if someone ran over and tried to take my Workshop, they'd still do slap damage to me, but if I wanted to defend my Workshop, then I'd logically have to disable Pacifist and fight them.  The onus would be on me to instigate contesting the Workshop, or let it go.
---
Same it‚Äôs a new bug for me...haven‚Äôt been able to fix other than reloading
---
yes currently the endgame pvp meta is buying duped assassins sentinel armor with leaded chest and dodgy fireproof  and AP perks among others.  makes the player invincible when standing still until u make them run out of AP.  they just stand still and one shot players with TSE shotguns when they get in range.  personally id like all legendaries effects removed from the game, otherwise the pvp is too exploitable and not really much fun
---
If I recall correctly, the cores you get for the event are 50%.  Basically 6 pounds for 1 effective charge.  Nuke plants are a much faster option.
---
Since before the game was released,  I thought that legendary items had no place in an online multiplayer.  But Bethesda foolishly chose  a different course and we are where we are. 
---
I'm hoping that legendary effects will be disabled in the new upcoming PVP mode but I have doubts. 
---
and what if it was a perfect legendary?
---
I'm sorry? Did they belong to the player in Watoga? or to a player who ain't even on the server yet? Are you saying I couldn't have them because that base was there, even though the owner was nowhere to be seen?
---
I triggered their spawn, I engaged their aggro and I began to kite them... On my own, with nobody else around... So, yeah... Did anyone else have more right than me at that point?
---
Really looking forward to this answer, I really am lol
---
sharing is caring.
---
Vats crit builds have some of the lowest gear requirements so trading for your necessary gear shouldn't be an issue. Craft yourself any max level gun, mod it out and you will one shot pretty much anything with a crit headshot.
---
Yeah but it's easy YouTube money to say it's the worst game ever
---
Because sometimes a level 35-40 w/ 3 stars is better than a level 45-50 w/out. I recently replaced my regular level 50 western revolver w/ a 2 star level 40 that, thanks to +VATS accuracy and the 10% from my mutations deals more damage overall.
---
I have a Two Hot Explosive Combat rifle, fully modded, and to be honest, sometime I have to use it in events and in Whitesprings, if I can, I try to avoid it, but like you say, sometimes it becomes necessary. In Whitesprings I run in with my Excavator Tesla Coil and tag everything, then run out and shotgun everything in the legs, which puts everything on the ground. But not everyone has the same attitude. It's a game, and it's everyone to himself in the end. All types play this. I'm a pacifist, bit your always gonna get some dick who just wants to be a selfish idiot and kill you along with everything as quick as they can.
---
I use a level 10 Somerset special for my vats crit, gun fu build.
---
Don't forget to turn on pacifist mode, especially for the tesla rifle! ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Same problem, the pip boy doesn't even show up, it just plays the animation and then freezes. Didn't have this problem before the last patch. 
---
They arent being killed through slap damage.  It‚Äôs mostly that they are confused about how workshops or teams work.
---
You spawn world spawn once a day, if you enter a new world the only items you can pick up are ones someone else has spawned until you reset yourself.
---
I've got a quad revolver as well, but it loads all 24 rounds, one at a time. It takes a while
---
depends if you're minmaxing.
---
I FO4 the weapons are much more effective. Especially the heavy guns like fat man or the missile launcher. And you don't need to farm for screws and such to build your missiles etc.  
---
If you dont use the bobblehead stacking glitch you can't kill the queen with ease. You need still multiple guys focusing their fire on  her. But a player having over a hundred levels should be able to kill some glowing ghouls with ease and also those pesky scorched beasts.
---
True. But as they didnt write: "Hey we nerf the TSE but on the other hand we also nerf endgame bosses". And the math is out there 25% means the TSE tier will 4 times less effective and you need 4 times the bullets to kill a mob etc.
---
Shoot arms off of ghouls and then laugh when they come up to you with their little t-Rex baby arms Hahahaha.
---
I do this event several times a session and only once (thankfully) have I seen somebody instant kill the legendaries. I had to take off my headphones to spare myself the shouting and swearing of the other half-dozen players in the room.
---
I wonder if it differs on platforms, e.g. are they more selfish/troll players on xbox vs. PC?
---
The gaming gods are fickle.
---
I didn't have it before the last patch so hopefully it gets fixed
---
Because for fast and simple event (which also shows up almost all the time) you get 3 legendary mobs, which equals 3 legendary items with up to 3 star effects. If you get lucky and get TSE weapon, it doesn't matter that much that it's not max level... well not until nerf that is.
---
&gt; Nukacrypt 
---
OK thanks everyone, I didn't realize it was that straightforward. 
---
Anyone dropped a nuke on Vault 76 yet?
---
He didn't start the process of contesting it before he oneshot me.  If me being in the build area turns off my protection then my bad, but from what the game says I thought he would have to start to contest it.  
---
If you are up against 3 SB's at any time most people should just relog, or if you re close to an interior cell shelter run from them.  At some point you will be able to deal with 3 or more, but the resources used could likely be better used elsewhere.
---
Each line item is still like 10-20 generally...my complaint isn't that they aren't generous, I am fine with the payouts as is...its just that there it is still a disconnect from "I scrapped 20 leather 5 days ago for 10 atoms" and the reward "I just bought a 700 atom fireplace".
---
I killed a level 3 because of this. Best part, when I hit execute, my cannibal perk kicked in and ate him alive
---
Oh my... This is SO annoying and sad at the same time. Although it's not "good" It's comforting to know that it happens to others and it is being voiced.
---
Thanks for sharing your story. Even though my single upvote is not much - I hope it will be heard.
---
Enjoy it today. That gun is getting nerfed in the next patch. 
---
It's a mix of both I think. If someone else grabs it then it's gone, if you grab it and then switch servers the game client will register that you already grabbed it and will despawn it. I'm not 100% sure about that tho but from personal experience that is what it seems like is happening.
---
Headshot on playstation is hard even with vats. I want something like anti armor hunting rifle, or something like that.
---
That's interesting and if that's the case, my bad.  I thought he would have to initiate contesting the workshop before I took more than slap damage.  
---
I have no idea. Most be a bug right. 
---
I used to do the same but once I got an explosive shotgun I learned not to aim down at the ground the hard way... over and over.
---
I've gotten a pretty good mental map of each of the power plants because I need them to feed my fusion core addiction. It's taken a few tries but it's much easier once you learn the layout. 
---
I like Uranium Fever but hate that the event caps at level 40 loot.
---
Line in the Sand is great for Fusion Cores as it always gives out 2 for a successful completion. It also does have a chance for rare stuff, it gave me the plans for Super Stimpaks.
---
Ha ha I thought I would get the 12-year-olds turning up to hurl abuse and accuse me of "abusing glitches".  Slow-hand-clap and well done, you were the first.  
---
I thought it was the main questline in the game :'D
---
you mean Bethesda can't code for shit.
---
I find it odd that, in a game where end game consist solely of getting better gear, there's a % chance that your stuff will disappear.
---
I find it funny as fuck to one shot it with my explosive double barrel, I love denying others the loot they worked hard for haha
---
Yeah I came across this last night. I couldn't do anything but pull up the map and fast travel which still didnt help
---
I feel like I saw a post about a fight club happening on one of the trading subreddits 
---
Yeah it seems like now you can't store something and put it back down if you don't have the plan for it.  You can move it though as long as you don't store it.
---
I honestly enjoyed fire breathers a lot and rose
---
That is actually a good idea... But it will take sooo much time for me to do create another lvl 50 character that it makes me sweat just thinking about it.
---
Thanks though :)
---
Perhaps I don't - I had assumed they had to initiate PVP at the workshop bench before it became a PVP zone.  I shall go and test this.  
---
And if the enemies died in 5-7 shots then that would be about 100 kills worth of shots. That's what my point was about. The low damage and bad armor scaling compounds the problem. 
---
Clearly you are creative so I challenge you to create a home that isn't impossibly floating in the air. It takes away from the immersion to see bases like this. You are good at design though.I've actually been to your base, I'm just North of you. 
---
I don't think OP is talking about 5 perk points just to buy the cards. That's 5 INT you're using in your build that you COULD be using on other things in the build. I think that's what OP is wanting to talk about.
---
Doing that repeatedly will fairly fast trigger all biped mobs to suicide around you, including all legendary mobs that might've spawned. If you run through Watoga and hear explosions in the distance, that's a legendary bot suiciding and triggering it's legendary explosion.
---
This game wasnt exactly intended to be played entirely solo. While the option is there that's not how Bethesda wanted the game played
---
Thanks - I had assumed there needed to be a trigger, rather than me just being in the build area.  
---
That‚Äôs still what happens to me every time I try both these events as well. 
---
What happened to the "bethesda please" list? Are the mods no longer deleting repeat suggestions?
---
This. Popped over there a while ago and it was low level diseased robots and a one star radroach that dropped some shitty baton.
---
Yes, extractors extract stuff, yes you get that stuff and if you keep them in working condition for whole duration of event you get more as reward.
---
You guys sound like two people aboard the Titanic, arguing about what angle the ship must have struck the iceberg at. 
---
Instead of jumping off of a sinking ship, you guys would rather sling poop at each other.  Although I guess in this case since it's the Titanic, it would be autographed pictures of DiCaprio and fine china. Not poo poo. . Either way, this isn't very civil.  Poop sticks, and it smells awful.
---
You both fucked up by giving Bethesda a penny of your money.  Now you're stuck with a goddamn nightmare. Something tells me you guys would be friends in real life.  I'm 100% sure of it. Anyone still supporting Bethesda, probably needs their head checked out. 
---
You guys should play a good game..
---
Like Star Trek: Fleet commander.  The finest game ever designed by hUmanz.
---
Personally I've never played, I just know it has to be an awesome game. I mean, kind of like Fo76, it featured a great song in the commercial. That means gud.
---
On a different note, how about that government shutdown? Seems like a threat to national security. More so than the fear of brown people invading our sweet land.  By sweet land I mean the United States. And by brown people I mean Mexicans.
---
Did I mention Star Trek: Fleet commander? 
---
Somebody toss me a bud light. I've got a fleet to command. 
---
sure. But the ar doesnt do for these or to kill the queen. So is currently no other gun type imho. This is exactly the topic: There is apparently no realy replacement to use in the end game. So rendering these guns so ineffective without having a good replacement to strive for is really really bad.  Whats your level? 
---
It's a gravitational lensing effect. 
---
You can give stuff to a alternate character your building? How?
---
I'm doing a second character now that the game is a bit more stable and would love to share stuff between characters 
---
Thanks - that's what I had assumed.  If the game mechanics are that slap damage is turned off when you're in the build area then it should say that - it doesn't.  I would have been quite happy with the situation if he'd triggered the contest workshop thing at the bench first.  
---
Lmao 
---
Yeah it's already demoralising running out of bullets against SBQ and switching to less effective guns. I'd rather things require more careful strategies than just being really hard to hurt. 
---
Ah that didn't cross my mind I forgot about it taking up 5 INT points
---
Well, you can always switch server when you see your CAMP is in the blast zone - it's not convenient, especially when you're in the middle of quest/event, but it's always better than have your camp ruined.
---
No he didn't, which makes me think that some of the others, above, are right that a person doesn't have to trigger the contest workshop thing at the workbench.  You're just vulnerable if you're in the build area.  
---
Thanks. :)
---
It's more fun when the enemies just do more damage. 
---
Not every weapon with Explosive bullets is two-shot. For example: there are Bloodied Explosives.
---
There are also two-shot weapons that do not have exploding bullets.
---
So calling all of them TSEs is, technically, incorrect.
---
will be interesting to see how efficient it still is after doing 1/4 of the explosive damage it did before. 
---
If your Camp is already in the hills above Whitesprings, you could consider a move to the place I'm currently at. It's pretty high on the hills but within sight of the Whitesprings perimeter wall and right on top of a lead extraction point :) There's no water and the view is only so-so but it's handy location wise!
---
Again, my complaint isn't really that they are not being generous...although I see how you could interpret my comment that way. It's more to do with the fact that do 3-5 small, random things per day to save up for "someday" is not a super compelling reward structure in a visceral sense.
---
The challenges themselves aren't like...achievements that feel really satisfying. Some are novel and funny and I like those. Others are just kinda whatever. And again, the reward is very separate from the chore.
---
In ESO you have a calendar of rewards, you get it just by checking in (which takes about as much effort as "kill 5 robots") and you can see and be excited for what is coming down the line. It is viscerally more motivating to me at least...much more of a connected experience between "I did the chore of logging in" and "I got this cute bear companion reward"...if that makes sense haha.
---
Not advocating for literal log in rewards just...a loot schedule for x# challenges completed this month nets you exclusive y item? Something to up the engagement-ante so to speak. ;)
---
I made beacons exclusively for this purpose. Worth it.
---
Difficult childhood?  Therapy is affordable and can be quite effective - try it!
---
Mire is definitely the creepiest.  I remember exploring the bog, and suddenly I see a huge silhouette in the gloom - a mirelurk queen. Bu aesthetically  i don't want my base there. My vote is for Savage Divide
---
Been playing since beta, and helped a lot of people with quests, do the same, helping i mean unless u have time machine (in which case can you go back and write todd howard to tell him to pull his finger out about 6 months before release pls pls?) and youll get there homie üëç
---
... and in Virginia bind them.
---
I'm not 100% sure, but there is one YTuber, Rifle, who tests alternative nuke sites on his channel, I think he tried V76, but there wasn't anything special, wasted nuke.
---
I am too if you find him first can u inv me @ eboiiii (4 i‚Äôs)
---
No there are people admitting to doing it. It is a legitimate problem some people are having. I've seen someone admit to camping around grafton and just murdering low level players that dont wanna role play as being raider victims. Its ridiculously stupid
---
They‚Äôre really just getting waxed by guys high on bobbleheads. Watched someone one shot the SBQ yesterday and knew right away that they up to. 
---
bobbleheads work great for strength increase also
---
Thanks, after getting to level 124 I didn't know that.  I thought PVP had to be started from the workbench.  
---
I could turn it into a debate about TSE's being able to oneshot a level 124 in full armour, but Bethesda are already nerfing them...
---
Yeah same here! Rose &amp; Firebreathers gave you cool stuff to do and also introduced interestung characters. Mysteries instead just pissed me off the further I got, especially the end. Waiting for faction war to eredicate anyone associating with the OoM :)
---
Just the explosive damage 
---
Well you're going to be ecstatic when I tell you about these flare guns!
---
Also, there are working power armor displays and mannequins in the game. https://imgur.com/a/ZZfJ2m8
---
I kind of like that I can't sell them. Gives me an incentive to gift them to low level players. 
---
Now what I need is the "already known" tag.
---
you can easily play it as a solo fallout experiance 
---
yeah. I know. This build can easily hit up to 10K damage with one hit. So all people are forced to throw a ways their guns and switch to melee or what is the conclusion?
---
Very.. it's mostly that way in whitespring because it's got an insanely high spawn rate on ghouls. I've seen them appear out of thin air before I even had time to loot the first set of corpses. Players will hang out exclusively in whitespring until they're well over lvl 50 or they find a TSE gun
---
I craft and sell those whenever I need to hit my max vendor caps for the day.
---
With all the talk of the targeting hud, I wonder if it is trying to highlight characters at distance = ‚àû, or some other ungodly large number. 
---
It depends on what you wanna do, I personally have nothing else that I need to use those points on so I'll probably keep it for that extra 20% damage, where as other people may need those points and dont see it being worth it. An extra 20% damage isnt much but it depends on the weapon, sure it wont be as ridiculous of a bonus as it is now, but sometimes it might be the difference you need
---
Not sure if troll or edgy cucklord
---
Why is that? (I really just can‚Äôt think of why)
---
I've never tried this, but I'm curious: if you take all 5 waters, it is possible to transfer some of them back to the purifier? 
---
If you're on PC you can have mine
---
So many UP votes!!
---
Probably both
---
I don't want to waste your time because I only recently started posting or watching youtube (except like dr kat and mighty boosh), i've watched some now and definitely understand some gamers need optimism.
---
However, I think you should have delivered these questions in a youtube video
---
my fallout 76 experience has been positive. I've glitched, but it's generally probably the best fallout game in my opinion (because I shouldn't be able to beat preston garvy at basketball! a joke about how any AI human in a simulation will break emersion ..). 
---
And that would totally negate the advantages of being a stealth sneak build.
---
I have never made Antibiotics or Disease Cure - too irritating to use mid-fight - and I still have plenty. I‚Äôd rather be able to ditch them altogether - but even w/ vaccinated they are just too frequent. 
---
For anyone still looking about this. I found the easy way is to go to a nuked Fissure Prime. Look around for patches of 2-4 trees, chances are ~80% that you'll find 1-4 Flash Fern plants(mutated versions of Mutated Fern). So you get around 2-8 Raw Violet Flux per patch of trees, if you have the double harvest perk.
---
Was so disappointed I couldn‚Äôt use the paint bucket full of ‚Äúred‚Äù paint from the Pickman Gallery to paint The Wall.
---
Even if they are wanted the first hit engages pvp, the second deals full damage. Noticed this in a few mercy killings and some bounty hunts. Usually always takes two hits, first does like 10% then the second hit takes out all their hp. 
---
Sometimes the first hit does full damage, which i belive is the correct way the mechanics should be working, but who knows?
---
Ot the Rad Worms get buffed by the alcohol, and you're double screwed.
---
this happened to me too. seemed the problem was having my junk split between myself and my stash. once i consolidated everything it worked just fine. 
---
And stuff like this is exactly why I have never put a lock on my camp. It‚Äôs so amazing to come across one when you need it most. 
---
If you see a wanted player with no pa and they are not moving they are using Sentinal gear that reduces damage while standing still. They also likely have tons of Assassins gear that reduces damage from other players as well. 
---
This is the new pvp meta. You form a team with other people, put on a ton of that armor and get wanted. Others come up to claim the bounty, engage in pvp, and then your teammates can snipe you. Pretty cheesy but easy to avoid.
---
The mob you got the drop off of must not have been max lvl. The mobs level sets what lvl gear is dropped.
---
I have had a lvl 15 anti-armor SkiSword drop off a lvl 20 rad roach on my 134.
---
And I have a lvl 50 AA/E combat shotgun that dropped at Awol off a 65 gutsy on my lvl 26 toon.
---
If you're on PC, get the Known Plans mod. 
---
The same way you use it while sitting down.
---
 **How would you feel about bonuses for completing a daily or weekly event?** 
---
I see this as an attempt to justify lootboxes. They get people to say yes we want your vague af rewards, then Bethesda announces the vague af rewards are not what we want.
---
I want a method to pick our rewards, not some random lootbox that will eventually find its way into the store.
---
Good point.  I never take it off :)
---
PS4:
---
Sorting by weight does not take perk cards into account.
---
Objects in my stash box claim X weight based on my perk cards, but require their original weight of room to actually stash them. If they take up their original weight, please show it as such.
---
Slider for cost now doesn't stop at 0 and wraps to 25000... yet does not wrap around the other direction. Trading with friends got 100x more tedious and difficult
---
It's supposed to full damage on the first hit i think. and it usually is when i attack wanted people. i know that can bug out sometimes. but thats not what i mean. even after the battle is well engaged. i've hit them point blank with massive damage only to see a tiny bit of damage being done.
---
Already known tag would be a vast improvement. I try to gift them to people, but I think lower guys run away too often. I try waving, but sometimes it doesn't work. If we had text chat, it would be a lot simpler.
---
This is something many of us have talked about and suggested over the months for content. Player contribution to town/city hub that we build up, permanent building, and server changing events.  I am all for more content like that.  Community oriented and wide reaching permanent results.  
---
I see a lot of repeated complaints about how it doesn't work on small servers/maps like this, how difficult it is to coordinate on every map, low population of map, and so on.  But the thing about this kind of event is that it could be a large scale month-long community event that Bethesda runs. Maybe they keep track of internal contribution numbers of certain stats across ALL servers and if we reach certain milestone goals as an entire community (not just goals on individual servers) then the location we built or rebuilt - as is the theme of this game of reclamation and rebuilding - will then become a permanent fixture on the game map after the event, just as much as Whitesprings or Watoga or Charleston is permanent.  
---
Since mods are not yet supported and currently violate the terms of service to use, I won't do that. 
---
However  I do have a pretty good expectation that this will be part of a future patch. 
---
For sure worth that price. It‚Äôs a decent solo experience and you may find a friend or two in the game to help with material gathering and high level boss fights. 
---
my x-01 calibrated shocks were auto scrapped... for steel! i had a bunch of bundled steel and it scrapped the mods that i have since spent over three hours trying to server hop farm and not been able to replace instead of vendor trash. Can't understand why it scrapped those mods and not the 10 other mods i had in my stash either...
---
All Rise is a set legendary. It will always be the exact same thing
---
I killed a normal skinny boi legendary ghoul and it dropped a three star powerfist. It‚Äôs been, far, the best drop I‚Äôve gotten in this game. But every time I go to whitesprings I just get rads and lose out on stimpacks for a 1* legendary life saver metal leg. 
---
I've done the patrol duty event 23 times and still haven't gotten the plan. I wouldn't call that "pretty reliably".
---
Haha, I came across a glowing one with no legs yesterday. No one was anywhere near by, lol. 
---
Really? People still havent figured that out. The game literally warns you about it......
---
They first added that in FO4. Ever since then, players around the wasteland engaging in melee combat have been saying ‚ÄúSHITSHITSHITNOSHI-!‚Äù
---
i've only seen one so far, i keep checking though. 
---
Sounds like you need to add a heavy gunner to your team comp. MGs seemed pretty effective against the queen last time I fought her. 
---
It has always asked for my username and password before, every single time I login.
---
REALLY freakin stupid, as in, "What moron thought this would be acceptable? What brain dead, never played a game or used a computer before buffoon coded this in? How did this make it past playtesting?" stupid.
---
But it's from the Capitol wasteland and as far as we know only one was made as it was a prototype 
---
Restart the launcher, that fixed it for me
---
Yeap - Right across from the Kanawha Cemetery 
---
They cant sue them. They aren't reselling any of Bethesda's products. They could only sue if they were also selling in game gear. I think maybe you are being a little over dramatic as well, not sure if you are an adult with bills and a family to take care of but you are suggesting that peoples lives be completely ruined and possibly families shattered over something going on in a video. Lets be rational about all this, Parma Ban is definitely the only way to go.
---
Maybe the computer system and the assembly line were shaken by the explosion and went up and running again. Idk that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking y‚Äôall. I‚Äôd have no problem with it not being canon, and your explanation is awesome, thx.
---
I'd love to see this myself. Can you post a pic of the map marker of this location?
---
Upvote for fifth Element reference... Also for being a straight up monster
---
I dont get that though - so if someone is playing in a world where they haven't picked up the items that I want, then I spawn into it - does it remove those items? Doesn't seem fair, but I suppose its possible
---
I think it's a good thing that you cant fast travel while overencumbered. It adds that sense of panic and choice that you have to make. It makes it a more in depth and personal experience
---
I fixed it by fast traveling to a hostile area and then getting killed by the enemies. It fixes the invisible Pip-Boy
---
Yeah true, server hop farming would make the game easier... I need my ammo dang it haha
---
Also, ten beers should not make me a alcoholic. 
---
Good lord the game has problems with all the bugs and disconnects and crashes to desk top, but you can definitely get 8 bucks out of enjoyment out of it.
---
Oh, i thought you ment when initiating. They are baiting you. They probably have stacked assasins/sentinal armour with dense and fireproof. Any damage you do would literally be only 10% due to all the damage reduction they have stacked.
---
All camp containers are linked to your stash.
---
lol I think it would not be good to balance duel weilding right now, maybe later. but I have always hated getting a boxing glove just for stupid stuf and not seeing the left. I do think it could be funny to add the second gloves animation but if they wanted to add duel wielding later that might mess with that up.
---
They probably have phones. That's really all they need
---
But I'm talking a big "WARNING! YOU ARE ABOUT TO SCRAP A FAVORITED ITEM! CONTINUE?"
---
Another idea is setting a favorite is like putting a lock on it so it can't be dropped or scrapped. I'm typically pretty careful,and haven't had a problem, but I can see how it can happen.
---
Only way to do it currently is to trust someone to hold onto items while you switch characters, or put a &gt;lot&lt; of faith in server stability and put items in a world container with someone you know in the world so you can rejoin the same world on the new character.  
---
ESO has a limited shared stash space between characters, I don't know why they'd drop the ball on such a simple but massively useful feature on this.  I understand it's different studios developing the games, but they're all a part of BGS so a little bit of communication would go a long way . . . 
---
Same if you're in xbox
---
If you launch it from the launcher it auto logs you in but if you start it from the actual .exe it asks for your log in 
---
&gt;They have multiple display cases you can build that are completely useless. 
---
They are recycled assets from Fo4. If they removed them, they would have to make something else to fill the gap as not to appear lacking in building options. Unless they make a display case prefilled, i don't think we will be able to fill them. They removed the drag function since tracking that on a mp server with 23 other people would be very taxing on it. Same why we have to drop stuff in a bag, it's easier on the server to track that then 24 different items on the ground. 
---
It's okay i guess.
---
Yeah it seems pretty basic to just make a power attack activated by holding the trigger. This hasn‚Äôt been a big issue for me but I‚Äôve killed myself at least once with a grenade due to this control function. 
---
As of right now it's a decorative piece, that is also part of the stash box. They don't have separate space to store because of server stability issues, hence why we have a limit on stash holding. 
---
Isn't It quicker just to leave the game and join again ?
---
Could have been poorly copied, explaining its nerfs.
---
One hundred percent after it is getting better but damn if it doesn't feel like it some days.
---
Same whitesprings never gives me anything good. 
---
If you are using a TSE weapon and they have FireProof 3 then you are gonna be doing next to nothing to them. I do it all the time.
---
As a programmer, programming is not that simple. It doesn't matter how important it is to the game, bugs happen. And being a game developer is not a simple good or bad categorization. Games and programs are made by teams of people, and even with the best intentions bugs and errors slip through. It's impossible to code for every scenario beforehand, some things just have to go wrong for you as a programmer to be able to acknowledge and account for them. 
---
Are you on the ski-slope cliffs near Top of the World? I ask because I know there is a deathclaw spawn location for a quest near there, might explain why you have a lvl 68 deathclaw hanging about.
---
Can you still pvp in passive mode if someone shoots you first?
---
So someone's new.
---
I have 3 All Rises because I always buy them whenever it's in the Watoga Vendor. If your on PC I can give you a LVL 50 All Rise.
---
Ah right, haven't got many trust worthy people on here yet.
---
This would be a awsome suggestions to make.
---
Even if it had a limit of like 50 I think it would make it a little easier.
---
My level 45 character is a mess of a build since most of the time the game was unstable and would always disconnect.
---
Im doing a good build right now and my main character has some spare plans that I would like to share lol
---
'tis but a flesh wound!
---
Heavy gunner have each roles they either clear ground mobs or be the tank for you're team
---
Alright yeah that makes a lot of sense actually. there's been instances where they've been moving but with assassins and such it still could add up.
---
Twice during the weekend I lost connection to the server *during the nuke countdown* while being on the other side of the world. If that's a regular thing happening the potential event participants might've been disconnected.
---
Top of the world, 3rd floor has plastic plates and a pumpkin.
---
AVR Medical Center cafeteria area (enter through the back door) has cafeteria trays everywhere.
---
Fort Defiance fourth floor has lots of plastic plates and a pool table although I frequently find it empty and have to server hop.
---
The Garrahan/Hornwright estates for pool tables and plastic plates.
---
It does this on occasion if you wait too long to bring up the main menu.
---
Frustrating for me because I use a random password and there is no exit button on that login screen.
---
But what if you want it clean?
---
Our Melee member runs some heavy weapons  but I don't know his specific build and suspect he is not perked out for Heavy Weapons and just wants to use them until the mobs get into melee range.
---
You can get lucky finding the plans usually. I keep running into the wetsuits, but have found a few helmets. 
---
2 places I know that spawn them are the display cases when you enter Harper's Ferry &amp; the orange train car west of Watoga Station (western edge of town). They have become regularly farmed spots, but maybe try server hopping. The one in the car is on top of 2 stacked wood boxes right by the door...sometimes it clips through the top box and you can barely see a corner.
---
Yes i have almost 200+ of everything. Even screws and springs. I dont build things often but when i do i want to be prepared. Been collecting since level 1 lol
---
Alright, thanks. it makes more sense now.
---
Yeah, it is. But I did this when Death from Above started, so I chose not to server hop
---
Yes. 
---
8 bar yeah it's worth it lmao that's cheaper then some smaller games 
---
There are cases where "bugs just happen", and cases where a dev team chews on way more than it can realistically handle.
---
I started it from the launcher, like always, made sure the launcher showed me as logged in even tried restarting the launcher and it was the same.
---
Strange how things change over night as I spent a good portion of Sunday exploring the wasteland.
---
Guess I‚Äôll have to wait for Bethesda to send me password reset link, since I can‚Äôt recall my pw.
---
I wish there was a polite way to decline trades, while we‚Äôre at it.
---
pretty common with how heavy melee damage is. Heavy Gunner builds can come with a ton of stagger though, which is good for getting the Queen to land as I understand it. 
---
I want raider stuff. I want to put heads on spikes around my house. I want blood filled cages in my basement. I want cloths stained in the blood of my enemies. 
---
Did you click on the low level version it shows inititally to bring up the menu that gives you the higher level options?
---
Same for me 
---
also the loading times basically tripled and I still load in once I‚Äôm in game. 
---
I had to Alt-Tab to the desktop to get out of the log in screen, yes rather annoying.
---
Yes, I know this is how the game works. My point is that it makes no sense at all. 
---
It a stupid we have to wait for them to patch it in it's common sense to let you know what plans  you've already learned 
---
I had a hunting rifle that also lost a lot of damage when I "upgraded" it with a Scorch Killer Receiver. I don't know wether the damage loss against everything else is additional, or already included in the shown numbers; but the even with the extra 50% against Scorched it was worse than with any other receiver, let alone anything that gives a damage bonus (like "Hardened"). I suppose it should be a great mod against Scorched, but I agree that in its current state, as far as I can tell, it's useless. 
---
600 cells in one second i always fire it just to see if its going to work knowing that it wont
---
Artificial conflict. It‚Äôs s cheap attempt to create something interesting in this dead game. 
---
Yeah and maybe make it so that people who play on PC who use an Xbox controller can also use their keyboard at the same time.. Text chat will be useless for me unless they do that. Good thing I bought a good headphone-mic set with a hard mute button on it, because the press-to-talk update was useless for me
---
you should also find another poster to trash it after the next patch...
---
And even after four years of that they were still like, "it works fine, put it in the new game, whatever, feck em."
---
Wait... melee power attack is R1?
---
*mind blown*
---
Are all your mats in one place? Either all in stash or all on character?
---
Encountered him for the first time last night at lv 31. I suspect I will see him soon again
---
Very much this, also, should be the same with certain pistols and one handed weapons like knives.
---
\&gt;  Players rarely dig into their own junk. 
---
Workshops slowly generate more resources.  So the longer you hold it the more you can build without dipping into your own.  I built up Wade Airport into a pretty decent sized camp without using my resources.  After holding it for a good 5 hours a guy 100 levels higher then me took it over and shot me....
---
Yes. I agree. I do not do that but i understand how that is a dick move.
---
Still available?
---
It‚Äôs right by the nuka cola plant 3 bobble heads spawn in the Lewis and sons farm a magazine as well there‚Äôs a couple Power Armor sets in the area two fusion reactors a fusion core behind a locked gate a magazine at the boat place (don‚Äôt remember the name two issues of scouts life at the scout camp and all enemies are low level so you can punch them also may be other magazines I think I‚Äôve found extra 
---
Will do
---
No.  
---
  
---
You have to toggle it off by going to the menu, even if you are being slapped or fire at a wanted player.  
---
No, you have to take it off to fight back
---
It doesn't take that long once you're not worried about the main quest and focus on leveling. And it can be fun in of itself to make a new character and try playing in a different way.
---
Alternatively, vendor hop to try and get one that way or try to trade for one.
---
Wow. Didn't know that change
---
Lucky you. I had to dedicate an evening and crafted around 100. In a week i am down to 42.
---
Mainly my own amusement, I tend to team with randos in nuke zones. Everyone loves a healer and flamers are satisfying AF
---
yeah i am there now :)
---
Sick puppies is a band tho
---
You could be like [Art Jimmerson](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y8wcbZOkfFV-tqw3GOPc_0OTVjA=/39x0:560x347/920x613/filters:focal(39x0:560x347):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/imported_assets/523329/royce.jpg)......
---
You can even cripple behemoths.
---
Oh my! I'm overwhelmed by your generosity - u/ShawnPaul86 u/b00m0ny0u and u/Meme2444
---
Thanks a lot &lt;3 This certainly brightens my day. You are good people.
---
I think I'll take the offer from u/Meme244 \- 'Cause you have 3 of them. You can add my beth.name: Ferns\_76
---
I have a weak gun I carry that takes 3-4 hits to kill a level 1-5 monster. Do it to allow newbies to get one or two hits in so they also get loot dropped. 
---
Wait, whose legs are you crippling here? 
---
It just works
---
and change the light color
---
I just spent 15 pts trying heavy and used auto rifles before. I was extremely disappointed. Unless I'm missing something heavy weapons are terrible.
---
I pray this will never happen as everyone would be in godroll gear in days unless they cut legendary spawned enemies multiple fold even if it rook hundreds of weapons to make one
---
Plus a ton of black titanium, gears, rubber and other junk from the suit/breather scrap
---
Yeah finding someone you trust to hold on to your items while you run and switch characters is the only option. I need to do it myself if you ever wanna help me I‚Äôll help you. I have everything I need already so I don‚Äôt have any reason to steal anything lol and I‚Äôm not that way anyway. 
---
Your argument is stupid and ignorant. Plenty of console games (some even having crossplay with PC) support a fully implemented in game chat.
---
How is headshot hard work vats? Vats aims for you...
---
Does it come as the automatic quest rewards or do you have to manually remove from the extractors?
---
I'm rocking unarmed no power armor and I get by pretty well. Nuke zones are hard w/o power armor but not impossible. 
---
GIVE ME YOUR KNEEEEEES
---
nope, just wood and springs.  The "Clipboard" has screws.
---
I can't speak for anybody else but I leave my industrial water purifier open for just such an occasion. It's output is high enough that I'll never use it all, so if it helps some in need.... bonus. 
---
I go to west tek and scrap the laser rifles the super mutants use.  6 plastic each.  I usually get between 60-100 plastic.
---
Are you at that level?  I think you have to be the level you‚Äôre attempting to craft. I could be wrong. 
---
I remember i launched a nuke at level 35 and it was a god damn marathon for me. The assaultrons were hard as hell and i started with 100 diluted stimpaks and ended with about 20. I felt so proud after i did it though. But of course, i go and fast travel to watch the nuke go off at fissure prime and i fucking lag out lol...so ive been there. And thats part of the reason why i want attempt to run the nuke again, especially with the increase of crashes on PS4
---
Ive seen screenshots of a 5 star legendary 
---
Level isn't super-duper important for some legendary weapons. For example, my current best per-shot weapon is a freaking level 15 explosive black powder rifle e_e
---
Im in 
---
Was this the case in fallout 4 as well? Would have saved me a ton of heartache. 
---
Furious is good on automatic weapons or weapons with high DPS, but they're not as valuable as Two-Shot, Bloodied, or Anti-Armor weapons. I don't know if there is a cap to the damage that you can get off of Furious weapons though.
---
Wasn't it always a 1,2,and 3 star supervisor?
---
Leave them in an overseers cache
---
*uses Pychobuff* 
---
#I WANT FUCKIN JINGLE BELLS ON MY FACE!!! RRRRRRAAAHG 
---
*smashes head through wall* 
---
Especially hate this. 
---
Yes! Exactly! It might be a post apocalyptic wasteland but we don't have to be savages! Rude savages even less so!
---
I do the same shit when being swamped, I just shoot everything at knee level.
---
RobCo endorsed sexting with the Lusty Assaultron Maid in the Whitesprings Presidential Suite. Rates are 27 caps a minute. Additional fees may apply.
---
Awsome, what you play on?
---
Yeah I'm not that way too, always happy to help.
---
You don't actually lose ammo or anything. It shows you what was used from the last time you reloaded or used grenades or whatever, but doesn't take anything away. Still a bug though.
---
Sounds like you had a pretty special and intimate relationship with this hammer and that losing it was almost comparable to losing a loved one. 
---
Both for sure
---
Haha, the NPC. I shoot at the legs. With a perk card applied, I can cripple them. They just lie there on the ground groaning.
---
You kill the same mobs types from lvl 1 up, the idea is the mobs scale to your lvl and you get loot off them that is suitable for your lvl.
---
The issue is, mobs dont despawn when the low lvl player goes away, they only go away after being killed and respawned.
---
The gear needs to scale with the mob not the player, if it scaled with the player everyone would just be farming the lowest lvl legendaries possible which have little to no risk to a lvl 50+ player.
---
Speaking only for xbox, since most people use parties instead of ingame chat, nobody can hear your requests, stats, or cursing, so the SBQ event is a free-for-all. The only way you get a legendary is to kill it yourself. 
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox lol I forgot to consider we may be on different platforms üò£
---
Got him. Sent you an invite
---
Yeah I seen people talking about it on another post. you think it would let you know if there was a cap as everything else tells you. Like the defense buffs on perks show you a max figure.
---
Also you don't need an anti armor rifle. Use armor penetrating magazines. You are better off with an instigating rifle for a vats crit or sneak sniper build.
---
How bout that reload button tho hmmm
---
That looks really cool. :D
---
I would love to see some sort of PvP disabled social hub, like in vault 76 for example, behind one of the inaccessible doors
---
Can we just remove the cap limit?
---
automatically, as event reward at the end.
---
Then you'll regret buying it when they release gold chrome miniguns. :P
---
And how about turn "hello" just into "Wave".  Maybe I'm saying goodbye, this isn't Hawaii... you don't know me!  You're not my real dad Todd!!!
---
Perhaps it refers to the Tri-Fold American Flag, which is a lootable object?
---
It's true for anything with a "condition" bar. There's a perk in luck that will extend that time - good with salt
---
This is my favored tactic at white springs when farming with a group after a nuke drop. It allows the others to get their tags in at a slower pace. Note this is a great method against Asaultrons... 
---
I‚Äôd never used the toolbox/footlocker blueprints until recently. However, I was under the impression that they would be a different, unsecure way for me to store items. 
---
Glad you had fun bro. Next time get in discord with us. I run the Fever Clan F76 channel for Fever Clan and we have 2300+ members and game pretty much everything. We run Queens all the time and like to find good people to run with us. Here's a link to our clan discord server: [https://discord.gg/9VF4wq5](https://discord.gg/9VF4wq5)
---
So, is this something they plan on addressing in the future? 
---
If this sub had moderators who were worth their salt, they'd make a sticky thread for the suggestions and delete any that aren't in it. 
---
I mean, that's what moderators are for. 
---
Its ok though r/fo76filthycasuals is a good escape when this sub is too much, I find myself going there instead of here more and more.
---
Yep I'm on pc lol.
---
Never mind, I always seem to get wantes hlep from xbox and ps4 players 
---
Oddly enough without any perks I dont develop one... I keep a ton of addictol anyway
---
Also, if you get killed during the SBQ event, 100% guaranteed somebody will take your stuff before you get back to it.  Not complaining really, but the sense of cooperation isn't really there due to the lack of ingame comms
---
Gonna leave it in a paper bag next to an empty PA frame - anyone want it take it - free and no worries :)
---
See ya'll in later :)
---
An emote  "lets launch nuke"
---
For real. Can anyone give me a good reason for the cap limit other than gating player progress?
---
Many people cannot control their emotions.  Especially younger people who's minds haven't fully formed yet.
---
This.
---
I do mostly. Some photo challenges I skip (5 factories this week). I have a rifleman, and a slugger build, and I‚Äôm working on a gunslinger build which is low level and easier to get the level up challenges completed. 
---
I believe it also determines the Max level of creatures you can tame and send to your C.A.M.P. I have not tested to confirm.
---
sad but very true.
---
Tuba town
---
Also, if you're gonna use a TSE weapon, please turn on pacifist mode
---
200% weapon condition with Pipe Mender or whatever and the 50% durability and this will almost never break too!
---
I‚Äôd like to see a few more difficult challenges. Maybe 1 ‚ÄúElite‚Äù challenge per day. 
---
Just pop an orbital strike. Saves ammo
---
I think people just forget that another person who also has emotions is on the other side, its not just an NPC.
---
Speaking of cap limits, they should look at the vendors in addition to raising ours. Can‚Äôt even sell a useless serum to a vendor bot since it is 180 higher than their cap limit. 
---
Good luck finding someone! 
---
Dont do it. The next patch will render it to trash.
---
There‚Äôs a plan called : US flag and it builds a flag on base (camp)
---
I can't remember but I wouldn't be surprised. I discovered this a couple days ago. I went to the Top of the World and someone before me spawned a lvl 64 legendary Radscorpion. I'm only 35 but I carry an array of explosives for special occasions. Eventually I crippled its legs and it drastically reduced its speed and it never borrowed again. It may be coincidence but once it was under 20% health I was actually trying to scurry away from me. The crappy part was 3 deaths, 10 grenades, landmines and a few 'clips' later all I got was some meat and eggs. Bet your ass I earned my breakfast that morning. 
---
Kneecapped a glowing Yao Guai in Whitesprings and start taunting it, fucker healed and hit me with an uppercut!
---
Or have it like it was in fallout 4 and make it so a weapon can only have one effect
---
Can confirm. I would 100% shop at u/zombieanna Etsy store. 
---
What I discovered when I found my first explosive is that it‚Äôs pretty much useless if you don‚Äôt build around it. I have a sniper build; I found an explosive machine gun, and it takes fucking forever to kill anything. Great for radroaches, though. 
---
I have 2 copy of the game and going to mule it i guess. Ill just store all my weapons and armor on him. They need to up it to 2k minimum because im just dumping crap anywhere. I threw away like 15 legendary weapons this weekend i wanted to keep. I just need to get the gaming laptop away from my daughter first.
---
This is probably something they might keep the same for stability in servers, but I know they are planning to increase stash space 
---
I don't even play the game due to the number of blue screens I'm getting. One every 5 minutes or so. Screw Bethesda 
---
Since a tip on the loading screen gives players the information that all containers in your camp are linked to your stash, I would assume this is intentional.
---
There‚Äôs only so many buttons 
---
No, they belong to anyone who enters the area. I disagree with building bases in whitespirings, but i also disagree with the "MAH SWAMP" mentality
---
Commando build here... I alternate between auto 10mm and 45 rifles so I can gather up the ammo for the other one.  You burn through 3000 rounds pretty quickly if you're generous with the bullets!
---
Yeah the fact that it can be seen through obstructions is super handy 
---
i've also only ever seen walking cane
---
I agree..it just happened to me...so pissed off!
---
Am i the only one sad by this statement ? It sounds and also by how the things seem to go look like no gun/armor paint will be earnable in game via either quest rewards or other means **not** involving the atom shop...
---
I honestly thought it was the coolest event they had made because of the "bug".
---
You know the spray and pray gun (explosive submachine) from 4? It has a tedency to kneecap corpses and have the rapid explosions keep the body juggling around in the air with the arms flailing around and all. 
---
I've tried to find a good name for the dance and I think I'll call it the "kneecap dance". I love the spray and pray gun.
---
I‚Äôm seeing mostly long load screens, and sometimes a double load screen. 
---
The pip boy freeze when you open pip boy before the world fully loads and u lock up is the worst tho. 
---
But how will you safely use your pip-boy?
---
After 1000+ hours in FO4, I thought I knew everything I needed to know. I guess not. Thanks for sharing. Honestly, I rarely encounter Radscorpians in FO76, I guess I have some exploring to do. 
---
Works for me. I've never had proc notification, but it's been working.
---
Well, my friend launched nuke several times, but, until i told him, didn‚Äôt know he could aim anywhere not necessary at marked locations.
---
You can only level up cards with another card of the same exact type - if the card has levels, you two cards level to create a 2 star card, and you may need more points in that SPECIAL category to equip it. Can be a bit annoying, as sometimes it can take awhile before you draw another identical card.
---
Looks great !! Thanks for the help
---
Also you have a low level luring into abushes
---
Oh my god that is my ideal weapon
---
lmao... i just want to be the dick walking around with the blindfold
---
Those 5 waters refill in no time. 
---
As far as i know there is none earnable in the game itself (talking about guns and regular armor paints ) .
---
Always like to do this, I tag the legendaries and just lead them over to other people (like level 20s and stuff) as I‚Äôm generally a hard melee hitter. Always feels nice
---
So what you're saying is the build is showing the path if I draw cards exactly right from packs?
---
On xbox there's also the problem of party chat. You have a headset but you can't hear or speak to anyone outside your party. I try not to use it. 
---
There‚Äôs a +20% speed cap I‚Äôve heard. I think speed demon maxes it and makes all other speed buffs redundant. Truly unfortunate that pistols as weak as they are have broken/useless perks exclusive to the class. 
---
Fort McClintock.  There are a few tri-folds there.  I believe that's what the challenge is referring to.
---
They wouldn't force to use a new character.  As the limit is 5, many people could have their account shared with a spouse/friend or have 5 characters created.  
---
Heavy weapons can be thrown away after the nerf. Entire builds will be trashed. The only build usable will be the melee build. Sadly 
---
I own a double shot Gatling which is barely usable against mid level enemies. After patch I can trash it. 
---
Commenting as I‚Äôm interested to knowing this question was ever answered correctly (confirmed)
---
EFT's leg meta is leaking to other games 
---
TSE? Turbo Shotgun Explosive...?
---
Did you use foam rubber too?  Made one a couple of halloweens ago 
---
lmao I've started using static containers to store my loot then get them out before I get off the amount of times I've lost  bulk junk and weapons is stupid 
---
Why does anyone need 25k caps, let alone MORE?
---
I disagree. If you aren't quick enough/accurate enough to land a shot, you don't deserve someone holding your hand, guiding you to the legendary, especially if you're too dense to check the only THREE possible spawn points for them. You know when they are coming out, just check the spawns quickly, it takes two seconds.
---
If you're scrolling through then to see if the text is greyed out, you can just add easily click on them to see if they get used. Seeing if a plan in your inventory is already learned was never the problem. It's seeing if they are already learned in shop interfaces, before you storms money to buy them.
---
I like my vampire death-tambo, except for the sound.
---
Meh. Reddit. Internet points don‚Äôt matter to me. Just trying to help. 
---
True true. I hope that they might introduce additional features like that. Seems like a good quality of life change.
---
Another thing carried over from Fallout 4. If they fix it in 76 I'm gonna be fucking pissed.
---
I stopped playing roughly two weeks after the game came out I‚Äôm surprised people still play it
---
Can we tag a community manager on this? I don't know who they are, but I think this is probably a small QoL change that a large percentage of the playerbase would support. Maybe I'm wrong, I don't melee, but I do have to bash from time to time, Molotov right at my own face is not fun. 
---
Nope that is indeed the case. But there are clips and text straight from tod Howard s mouth of him saying that solo players will have no problems playing solo it will only be slightly more difficult in certain areas. 
---
This was a huge debate before f76 came out and many people wanted to know this because fallout always had been a solo expierience. It kind of is the whole charm of the game, being the lone wanderer or the sole survivor. So this debate was of a Marge that Bethesda couldn't deny it.
---
I followed that debate and as a fallout fan I was thrilled to hear Todd say these words. So as a paying customer I expect to do so and have that possibility. 
---
Afcourse you are right this game is intended to play with friends. And I do sometimes but I rather be the lone sniper and discover all the stories. When playing together and doing missions everything feels rushed all the time. Nobody takes the time to actually read the terminals and be part of the story. Most just want to do missions and rank up. 
---
Hey, it's FO76's soulmate No Man's Sky.
---
I have read that Suppressor does not work on players. YMMV
---
..... Hi, my name is Don King and I am here to represent you....
---
But without perks? I am going to kneecap the shot out of them tonight lol.
---
Thanks for the help
---
Your drill sergeant would tell you that if you don't have the keyboard/controller dexterity to throw a grenade only when you mean to, then you shouldn't be trusted with grenades.
---
(But yeah, it's happened to everyone, and it happens more in melee. So whatever the drill sergeant says, we feel ya.)
---
Yes, eventually you will be able to make your build by waiting for cards. In the meantime just pick cards that are generally useful.
---
My tse lever action is lv 35 and it hits harder than ANY lv 45 without explosive
---
Pretty cool. Love those trees for photos 
---
That should be the benefit of say... Master level unarmed perk
---
Let's solve duping entirely, then delete all duped items, especially colas. Then I'm game for upping or removing cap cap.
---
very little because my PS4 controller is fucked and the slightest grazing of the right directional button will wave me use a Stimpack. I could exhale and it would go off
---
I saw a scorchbeast near the top of the world and I fucking booked it
---
I am around level 90, and thought this same thing.  I've had pacifist on since day 1, and I have never engaged in PvP (although two idiots chased me across the map while I was encumbered, screaming at me to fight them).  I've only ever taken one workshop, just for the free C.A.M.P. plans.  I saw the warning, but figured someone had to come along and contest my contestation to start PvP.  Nobody did, and I just did the defense quest and then left the area.
---
Weird Wasteland perk confirmed
---
So single shot explosive weapons won‚Äôt be nerfed?
---
Relogging would have reset Belly of the Beast...
---
I could easily take the damage... I can definitely dish some damage out... and if I wasn't bumbling around the outskirts of Watauga trying to find where they wanted me to go that's something I could have focused on.
---
The real complaint here is how awful it is to be spam attack by 3 lvl 80 Scorch beasts. Its not the damage... its blinding... watch the clip.
---
Mark Watney: Space Pirate
---
Same, xbox. It never used to load in quickly before but i could at least exit the pip boy. My weapon wouldnt load either. So id just run in circles a bit til it loaded. Now its constant freezing if im a second too early bringing it up and i have to restart everything. 
---
thank you! i'll pm you my ign, we can swap base tours!
---
I've been farming Morgantown highschool and the crazy cat lady's house. Have I been doing it wrong?
---
Are you using rank 2 of the card? Because rank 2 doesn't work. Hasn't since beta. 
---
Ah thanks. I followed Nally know I am searching for nothing lol. I have the tricentennial paint but it only can be put on a few guns. 
---
I'm a solo player and find myself regularly smacked by mobs my level or higher. Instigating fireaxe is the only thing helping me out right now at level 35 haha
---
The funny thing is, the only thing I use my 10mm for is to set scorch beasts on fire to make sure hits are registering.
---
TIL there is a power attack....playing melee and lvl 30...kek
---
And in the Miner Miracles mine, next to the respective workbenches
---
Bethesda, please add text chat to game!!!
---
I had 4 legendary hunting rifles drop in whitesprings... 2 nuked, 2 non nuked (I'll take a loop around the spawns if it's not nuked and no one is there).  they were all garbage drops though.
---
the Queen... well... we did 20 something runs on her this weekend, I gave away 15 ultracite helms and explosive vents...
---
This is why I stopped playing.
---
Doesn't feel like they balanced anything in the game for it to be online like an mmo so everyone is just power tripping with two shot explosive automatic rifles.
---
Not fun at all, ruins all elements of diversity in characters and just caters to those braindead power tripping idiots that just want to blitz an enemy down by holding down the trigger.
---
&gt;Bullet point one is basically a way of telling people to go play hello kitty island adventure. I thought everyone was clear on that.
---
I would suggest from the number of threads here and on Beth's site that some people don't like having their camps attacked, sometimes obliterated, by fellow players, while still enjoying the rest of the Fallout experience. Their opinion is just as valid as your opinion.
---
Ooopppssss forgot to mention I am on PC. Sorry  folks :/
---
Thanks 
---
I bought it for full price and Im still enjoying it. ¬£8 is a steal.
---
Yeah, it's been there since day one. 
---
Agree, but problems like this point to a failure in design around difficulty scaling with event participant level and count.  Even by myself at level 150, the mobs normal drop with two bullets without a legendary weapon.
---
You would have to fully damage the limb if you dont have cripple perks.
---
You'll get the cards you want eventually but it may take some time. In the meantime, you can always take a card that you plan to swap out for something else eventually. Just don't put points in categories of SPECIAL if it's not what you want your build to look like at later levels (e.g. if you're planning to build a sniper build, don't put crap loads of points in say, strength, just because a shiny card comes up for that category; you need to think ahead).
---
For a game that focused so heavily on the variety of stuffed teddy bears I was disappointed to see there was no way to display all of them. Same thing with magazines and everything else... we want to collect these things!
---
agreed. It would be very easy to implement. Remove stacking bobbleheads. It wont affect regular players anyway since it‚Äôs rare to even find two of the same type anyway.
---
The only ones getting bummed are the dupers. And this is what should be achieved.
---
NCR Veteran Ranger Armor
---
Just an FYI: I leave my extractors unlocked so other players can access them. I lock them when I really need the materials, then unlock again afterwards.
---
Other than that.. good job on the run!
---
Lost a 3 star railway rifle to this bug. Didn't even got to try it. It just vanished into thin air. Not a TSE, but it was my first ever 3 star item.
---
Well done!!! 
---
It was next to the church in Flatwoods but I've since dismantled it.
---
I will keep it if I find it thanks for the tip :).
---
So far I one shot most enemies with my sniper and 2.5 sneak bonus. But it's the only weapons I have that seems to do damage.
---
So pre-Jan. Patch I was running 3 accounts on one PC, with nearly Zero CTD's per week...  
---
Post Jan patch even with one client open I was seeing frequent CTD's..  
---
I made 3 batch files, each assigned to a different range of 8 cores, and surprisingly I got only one CTD in about 90 minutes with the 3 clients open...  Makes me think the last patch had some resource assignment changes.  
---
I lost an anti armor death tambo 
---
LA LLORONA!
---
I want cripple perks but don't know how to find them. Are they in the agility catagory? 
---
West tek, watoga medical, watoga high, robco, generals steakhouse, harpers ferry. Those are locations I go to for legendary hunting. 
---
Events- horde events in mire, savage divide, and the bog. Awol armaments. Guided meditation. Uranium fever (keep in mind gear will drop 40 and below since mole men cap at level 40). 
---
As far as the prime plans, scorchbeasts level 65 and above and the queen. I don't think it drops duplicates for those because I haven't gotten one in a while and the group i play with does queen runs like a religion. So just keep at it and you'll eventually get it. 
---
Good luck!!
---
I have a shotgun does 128 damage but cant one shot a level 6 scorched idk I often find myself frustrated I love playing the game but it isnt easy being a loner I also hear armor piercing is good for doing damage
---
Responders police uniform?
---
The emote should be the "zip your lips and throw away the key" gesture.
---
Yup this, it's harder without any perks or even a kneecapper weapon but doable.
---
ps4.
---
Because they duped 100 million nuka colas and want to get rid of them before bethesda starts banning people for excessive items in inventory.
---
Great advice I just did that yesterday as well. Plenty of golf balls everywhere
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer has to see this
---
This is an amazing resource.  Do you have a way someone can contribute?  
---
I see you can add markers but are they just for you and your friends?
---
Crippled deathclaws look just pathetic. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure you‚Äôve tested this much. But basically 25 intelligence is all that is needed to craft a item at 200% durability.
---
This does not mean that your item has a higher resistances potential or maximum condition than someone that crafted their armor at 15 intelligence, it simply means your armor started out at a higher condition (200% vs 130%).
---
As someone else stated, this makes intelligence basically useless.
---
Server dcs suck
---
Without the ability to rejoin the last server we are stuck joining a group/team.
---
If you are on a team you will automatically rejoin your team after a CrashToDesktop or menu for consoles, or after a disconnect. Aslong as the server stills exists being in a team will get you back to your nuke.
---
Im generally a solo player and will invite randoms on the map til someone accepts and I have an anchor. If you get a random invite and they are at a bunker, accept the invite and help another solo player out.
---
I know there are a few jerks abusing the team invite, but almost all of my times accepting a random invite turned out for the better and if you meet some new fellow players all the better right?
---
I see them everywhere in Toxic Valley
---
You can. If you keep aiming at a limb, even outside of VATS, you might deal enough damage to cripple the limb. I do this all the time to ghouls, because they're fast as fuck.
---
I can barely hold on to more than 1.5k caps, but I don't think the cap limit should be raised until they can stomp out dupers. There's not really anything to spend your caps on after you get everything you'd ever want blueprint-wise anyways, outside of player trading. But player trade economy is busted enough as it is.
---
Your probably talking about sanjay from the responders 
---
You can only get paints from the Atom store.  
---
I just picked up the camo paint for the sniper rifle. Much happiness
---
Its between bad and ok. If you liked Just the exploration part of Fallout 4 its a okay game.
---
I did this over the weekend for the first time except I made two crucial mistakes:
---
1.  I stuck around.   I'm a rifle build, PvE, and not insanely high level or equipped.   
---
2.   I forgot to stash my junk.   
---
Needless to say, the guy came back, killed me immediately, and took a lot of good junk.   I never destroy camps or engage in pvp, so I learned a lesson and I'm not too salty about it.   Still tho, it was a dick move to build those turrets in the first place, guy.   
---
I'm currently saving up for it! Can't wait!
---
Two-Shot Explosive
---
Are you shitting me?! Well, I'm an idiot.
---
Oh yes - those mysterious maidens send you on quite the treasure hunt, especially for a low level. I remember those hulking green beasties well!
---
I have the exact same. My shotgun should be badass bit I already removed the suppressor from it because apparently that was bad for damage. However I still need 4/5 shots on a Supermutant with it while no scoping them from one feet with my sniper kills them instantly.
---
I only carry different guns around for variation because only my sniper is useful. 
---
And maybe my silenced pipe pistol but that does about the same as my sniper so no need to actually swap them for close range or long range. 
---
I pictured the Fallen Brotherhood [like these guys](https://imgur.com/rfw686s.png).  Excellent DLC proposal.
---
I like the theme song idea. I might have to take a more explosive build to accommodate my theme song. I would RP as Howling Mad Murdock. 
---
[A team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJF-o__Ny4I) full 10 hours of awesomeness. 
---
Too bad I can't flip a van every time I roll up. 
---
Thanks :)
---
Hey, that's a great idea!
---
None, the armor will merely only start at a higher condition, and thus resistances would be higher than an armor starting at a lower condition. But both armors would have the exact same resistances if at the same condition, which they would be once both are repaired.
---
in his case 'tis but a loose wire'
---
If you're online now I can give it to you, I'm on break atm
---
I don't eeven touch heavy guns because the ammo takes to much space. I will never know what its like to tote around a missle launcher or a fat boy. I just scrap them when i pick them up
---
I think I will buy that one tonight. 800 it was I believe. 
---
Hmm most interesting ...
---
Hi I've wanted to create an item brokerage guild for a while now. for this exact purpose. RR family insurance co. would be a funny clan name for that sort of thing I don't care if anybody steals that, my name is uberzooks I obviosly don't need a name as much as others (I literally made that up just now as an example and am holding out on giving away my favored name).
---
I actually avoided doing this (i did it once with crossed fingers) as I didn't know if it is even allowed. having one player (even if they can't move) on a server with 20k carrywight can break a server I never wanted that much lol). Is it allowed because I'll make one of them wierd emmersive posts.
---
but yeah if you had a clan for this it would be easy. obvi all parties record, and brokers would never ever be able to fuck up. you screw one person over you are out of the guild. and yes I would charge, lets hope somebody else does do this because I only trade with gold and silver (I am kidding). gl nhf  all i am asking is if this is even allowed
---
That explains it, I powered through the quests there and don't really return, my least favorite region. They're really no reason to return to lower leveled areas except to farm materials or visit vendors. I hope we get some quality DLC, I love this game to much to be bored with it. 
---
Make sure you have enough unbulked steel to make everything. When allocating steel resources, it seems to prioritize scrap&gt;junk&gt;mods&gt;bulk.
---
I lost several mods making stupid pipe pistols for new players, and played around with it until I found out where they were disappearing to.
---
Just did my first one at 45 with no powerarmor wearing a rad suit just crushed everything was pretty easy
---
Yup
---
ur timezone?and gt?
---
Another question seems like they go up to 5***** where‚Äôs the rest never seen nothing over 3***
---
You can also trigger it if you sprint and attack too.
---
party boy and happy go lucky are great perks. you could also run a flamer build with friendly fire, but charisma perks are mainly team based. you could run the shared healing perk (stimpaks you use also heal your teammates) along with the shared antibiotics perk (same as shared healing, but with disease cures) 
---
This is simply incorrect. The condition of an item has no effect on energy resistances. And a armor created with higher intelligence does not have a higher damage resistance potential than a armor crafted at a lower intelligence, it just starts out at a higher condition.
---
Only pink mist like that i'm aware of is related to the flatwoods monster
---
Doubt it will go free to play
---
Glad we didn't join Uranium Fever last night, we're only level 26. I'd heard it has good rewards, so I considered it. 
---
It would be nice if the game gave you a recommended character level before starting an Event.
---
The trade subreddit is r/fo76bazaar
---
Totally agree 
---
I regularly kneecap super mutants. It‚Äôs faster to shotgun them in the face, but it‚Äôs nice to leg them and then slowly line up a perfect face shot when they‚Äôre crouched helpless on the ground.
---
I may have once kneecapped one, and while he crouched, I booty danced backwards into his face, pooped out a grenade next to him, then stepped out of the blast radius without turning so I could watch his corpse fly through the air over my head to land in front of me. I missed looting him as he flew by, so maybe I‚Äôll try this trick again soon.
---
A trade 'bazaar' would be pretty sweet for those that are more into crafting.
---
Made a post a few days about baggies , drop nothing valuable at first , spot baggie , add stuff to baggie.
---
Also let your partner know not to pick anything until you‚Äôre done , or it will disappear 
---
go back to fortnite
---
Kneecap a Gulper while you can.

https://twitter.com/FuzorFishbug/status/1087039876007186432?s=19
---
Just to disagree with you... I'm a rifle build and often the highest damage output in a group of 12 of us that go after the queen regularly.  With just a lever action.  
---
To offer some help... you need specific perks.  Tormentor for crippling the SBQ wings, I just just 2 points.  Tank Killer, ignores armor and causes stagger, pay attention to the fight, learn her queues for when she wants to land.  Don't shoot when she's trying to land as stagger can cause her to skip it.  Concentrated Fire, helps with crippling the wings.  Four Leaf Clover, this thing is insane with a 2 shot weapon (doesnt even need to be explosive).  It appears it triggers per shot... so 2X the chance with a two shot.  And it can trigger on a vats crit.  I do more vats crits than regular vats shots.
---
which brings me to my next point... Mutations.  You need them.  Eagle Eyes gives you bonus vats crit damage and per.  Adrenal Reaction, more damage the lower your health, A LOT more.  Also, bird bones and marsupial are just fun!
---
How can you be quick enough if someone else sees them first and one shots them.  You have no hope then.  
---
For crying out loud, if you want to use your frigging TSE, use it on the NON legendary mobs.  I'm only level 59 and I don't have a TSE but my melee weapon could one shot them, but I use a weapon that lets me do some damage and then let others get a chance to damage the legendaries.  I DO try to one shot the regular mobs though.
---
I'd really like the ability to hide my PA helmet. That way I can still get the 100 lbs bonus and wear my dope skull mask.
---
Games like D3 have this.
---
I thought you got the loot by just being in the proximity of the legendary?
---
If you're doing a charisma build there's no such thing as "too much charisma".
---
As for the perks:
---
**[Inspirational]** When you are on a team get 5/10/15% more XP
---
**[Magnetic personality]** Gain 1/2 charisma for each teammate exuding yourself (good for others to share higher level perks)
---
**[Squad maneuvers]**  Run 10/20% faster when part of a team
---
**[Suppressor]** Reduce your target's damage output by 10/20/30% for two seconds after you attack
---
**[Tenderizer]** Make your target receive 5/6/7% for 5/7/10 seconds after you attack
---
**[Rad sponge]** When affected by rads, you periodically heal 80/140/200 rads on nearby teammates
---
You know how it makes that optional to complete repairs to 100% on each section; is there any benefit to that?
---
Niceüòé
---
I hear ya there, I think I‚Äôve given away at least three ultracite plan sets to fresh starts in the last few weeks. Just been trying to find these damned things!!
---
What is this, a pip-boy for ants? 
---
Gotta be fast some players might show up and be faster
---
Enforcer. 
---
And yes in agility.
---
I cripple scorched beasts and they can‚Äôt fly. Eventually they can‚Äôt even swing at me and I stand point blank in front of their face and blast away.
---
That was snarky of me. Sometimes I can't resist a good line. Sorry about that. 
---
But their opinions aren't as valid as mine, because they're arguing gravity doesn't exist. I'm telling you it does.
---
The Fallout experience is that war never changes, set in a wonky alternate post WWII timeline. If no one could attack your base, attack you, be general d bags altogether, then war has indeed changed.
---
Haha that would be awesome. The theme song helps. Sometimes I'll go invisible on a cliff overlooking someones base and play very creepy music or sound effects. Other times I'll play fallout music from other games, like "I don't want to set the world on fire". In those instances I get allot of "Hello?" and "Is someone there?".
---
No.
---
Someone new entered the "area", probably someone at the trainstation. But it goes by levels with super mutants being the top end. Scorched (low) &gt; Miners (mid) &gt; Mutants (high) is what I have seen. 
---
You shouldn't be running Uranium Fever yet then. Just play the game normally. Wait until you're atleast level 50 to start farming legendaries.
---
If you need lead, run through lucky hole mines. In excavator armor you can pull a ton of lead ore and smelt it down. Use super duper perk and its even better. 
---
I used to use scrap and weights but not anymore. 
---
In case you didn't know, there are a whole slew of vendor bots inside the resort on the bottom floor that each have different inventories, but all share the same cap pool.   
---
Some of them have plans, but (wait for it) they're always the same plans!  
---
That's just the Whitesprings, not a bug.   
---
The weird thing was it started with level 5's. Then 10...then 16...A legendary 22... The onslaught just wouldn't stop.
---
dude. unarmed is insanely op. (besides the fact that you can‚Äôt use power armor) because it gets damage increases from both gladiator and iron fist, giving it up to a 120% dmg increase just from those perks, both the twisted muscles and talons mutations increase your unarmed weapon damage, which is another +50% damage increase, and then you can use bloody mess ofc to get it up to +185% damage increase before chems. so yeah, unarmed is viable.
---
That one still has the perception penalty though, doesnt it ? 
---
Once you got enough fuel thats less of a problem. But the flamer breaks after reloading it 2-3 times :(!! Got a 3* flamer and bought 10k fuel in total from 6 different people, just to see how fast it breaks.. 
---
Thanks. Been running events for a while now. Need to get a good legendary farming route. I‚Äôll give yours a shot tonight. Just getting annoyed with RNG in this game. I‚Äôm lvl 184(ish) and have had to trade for all my good weapons. 
---
I was seriously irritated last night when I was doing the event with 2 high level people.  Originally it was just me and the 126... But he was one shotting the legendaries with his frigging TSE. I don't know if the 226 did it too...  Luckily I was right where at least the 3 star legendary spawned.  Missed the other two though...
---
I found a  level 1 dog that is not argro just white writing. I don't think it would attack others in your base.
---
I'm a VATS Luck+Crit Rifle build...  so I think I understand your feelings.
---
Here's what I did to make myself competitive for Queen fights.
---
* Adjust your gear to be mission-specific.  Get a Zealots Legendary rifle, even just a 1* Zealots, combined with a Prime Receiver, will make dents.
---
* Consider picking up a Pipe Bolt Action for your main gun.  The Rifleman and Gunslinger Perks work with Pipe Guns, even when fitted with stocks.  Crack Shot and Long Shot, likewise will also stack.  Pipe rifles are LIGHTWEIGHT and hence are very effective to use with VATS.
---
* Concentrated Fire 3, focus the head at all times.  If you're a VATS build, I am assuming you have AP regen and Criticals to spare?  Consider Cola Nut 2 as you can keep drinking even normal Nuka Colas and your AP will never run out.
---
People often overlook the humble pipe gun, but properly Perked and with the right Legendary Traits, it is a VERY effective tool for the Rifleman's toolbox.
---
I am running all of the perks you stated.
---
Mutations, well that's something I have not yet done. Guess that's my next area to work on.  Just seems very tough/expensive.
---
Also still in search of the elusive 2 shot weapon.
---
What this guy said. Literally came back here to say that, but alas, I have been ninja'd &gt;&lt;
---
With slightly different animations, usually stabbing/slicing/bonking/punching the the target as appropriate.
---
I have 15 strength and hydraulic bracers on my excavator armor, in addition to bloody mess, so I've been punching every enemy below 20 to death instead of wasting my weaponry. Sprinting up to a scorched and punching through their chest cavity so all their limbs fly off and torso explodes never gets old.
---
Im fine with the vampires effect, but I'm using a swing speed combat knife... can "tank" the queen with it without using any stimpacks.
---
Haven't tried vampire shooting weapons though 
---
Piss Off Ghost!
---
All container appearances are purely ornamental.   They all access the same storage space and can't be used to store away specific items apart from the rest.   
---
There is absolutely no indication of this. There is a post several times a week in this subreddit saying almost the same thing. 
---
Beyond all of the reasons why f2p would be a bad idea for 76, Bethesda has not give any indication at all that this is the case and no one has been able to find any hint of evidence that this would be true. 
---
I just wish the event was longer than 15 minutes. By the time I see it and get there I only have like 3 minutes left.
---
Two shot explosive.
---
Morgantown airport, too.   
---
Or a loud as fuck washer/dryer unit because your apartment is tiny in california 
---
I have actually never tried a scorchebeast because I thought they would kill me in an instant. I am level 30 so maybe that's a bit early with solo. But I might try it if I know I can cripple them and just snipe them afterwards.
---
Easy partial fix (Nuked zone).  Make the blast destroy every camp.  All of it.  100%  (I know some floors survive a blast)  Make it impossible to set up camp or build in a blast zone.  You can't re-spawn in a blast zone, why are you able to build there?
---
Welcome to the sewer that is reddit 
---
I will be honest, I do pretty much just sell/scrap all pipe guns.  Might have to look into that.
---
All of the songs are named after the different kinds of meat.   
---
I have a rule to never post something online I wouldn‚Äôt say to a person in the room.   It helps.  
---
I would also like to add that most of the comments I read on this subreddit are civil, thank mothman.  
---
You can get to 4 stars by adding a scorched killer receiver onto a 3 star weapon but there are no 5s in game yet. 
---
I went through and powered up the powerplant twice last night. The first time I did I got the windmill plan and the second time I recieved the fusion generator plans. I ended up just trading someone the handmade plans for the decontamination shower plans.
---
Xbox One X - GT: Lexafer
---
* Having an issue where after using the cooking spit I am locked into third person view. I cannot move my character or change to first person view. Only the map button works.
---
* Frequent game crashes to Xbox home and freezing after roughly 10 minutes of game play.
---
* Exiting Power Armor will sometimes result in the character looking warped or exiting from the left side.
---
That is a very common one.  But Rose, Various firebreathers, the McFlintlock system, Abbie, Freddy‚Äôs nanny, the Vendors, etc.
---
All are long dead humans or automated systems still active.  
---
Craftable Legendary effects I don't like the Idea of grinding hours just to get dicked over by "its the Effects you want...but not the Weapon/Armor" and vice versa. 
---
I checked the map and couldn't find anyone even remotely close to my location.
---
I think it means you can‚Äôt do it again in 24 hr ?
---
Yup, it breaks after reloading 2-3 times. So sad about this
---
Oh yeah, Toxic Valley is hands down the worst. But also where you go if you want deer meat easily. 
---
Plus, it's a sniper's dream location as it has mostly unobstructed sitelines pretty much everywhere 
---
And there is absolutely nothing wrong with playing that way. I think it would be more fun for you with more NPC's though
---
People roll around in BIS gear in MMOs all the time and those games seem to be fine. Same with games where there is no gear system - everyone comes with the best gear as standard. 
---
Your **actual** problem is a lack of meaningful and challenging content that requires more than just the best gun, and can still maintain a playerbase.      
---
Using the RNG model to keep people "entertained" (also known as gambling) isnt actually that entertaining. Especially if you never ever win. 
---
The next problem is that the legendary mods themselves are poorly implemented. They should be there to add flavour.. it would better if everything was Good-In-Slot, rather than a very very limited combination being Best-In-Slot. 
---
Lol!   Nice. üòÇ
---
This is more of a "Bad game design, Bethesda, fix this!" and not "Players need to learn to be more considerate". Both are true, but it's easier to try abd get Bethesda devs to fix the game, than to teach all of the game's players the reality of the game's poor design and how to work within it. 
---
What I mean is, in other MMOs, during events, people tend to use best weapons they have. In FO76, the design encourages everyone to use the WORST weapon they have, to make sure everyone gets a tap. That, by itself, is such a glaring design flaw that nothing else needs to be said. If, for optimal results, you NEED to severely hamper your own performance in the interests of everyone else. We should all be striving to get stronger and better, not weaker and less effective. It is literally ass-backwards.
---
So while I totally agree with you, and god knows it's super-annoying when you have a low-health sniper just sitting on the walkway 1-shotting spawns (including legendaries) before melees can even get a 10th of the way towards them, it's something that the devs need to fix, because they fucked up the mechanics to begin with. Getting 100-400 developers to rework flawed design is easier than getting millions of players to play counter-intuitively. 
---
But couldn't low INT players just get fix it good to 200% their armor / PA and get the same 2x condition as 40 INT crafter? 
---
Ive seen at least a good 30% that were just insulting the OP
---
It doesnt have to be.
---
I used to have so many fusion cores, I was just dropping them, or not taking them anymore.  Now I am getting to the point I am running low!
---
I didn't think Zealots had any effect on Scorched Beasts, only against the bipedal scorched
---
What's the point of the bases these anyway? There is already a full complement of workbenches inside and turret kills aren't lootable even by the owner. 
---
I'll cruise through there again next time I'm online. All the other areas are prettier, so I avoid it. Although I guess it is more traditionally like the Fallout universe. 
---
Hm, well I guess I just suck. Congrats to you though. (And no this isnt sarcastic)
---
Condition between 1-100% (yellow bar) always has the same damage resistance.
---
Condition from 101-200% get extra **physical** damage resistance only. Energy resistance stays the same.
---
Additionally, you can just pick up the perk that allows you to repair to 200% instead of doing all this stuff.
---
Is that you, PewDiePie?
---
Be the change you want to see, break away from the meta. 
---
playtesting? :D Ain't nobody got time for that! It just works!
---
....but yeah...stupid decision to keep it like that
---
If they are kneeling, they won't appear on your map.
---
Not sure, just picked it up last night, from a locker in WS Golf Club
---
Yeah ditto ... I always leave my extractors unlocked for other players as well ... pretty sure it‚Äôs fine if the extractor is unlocked 
---
‚òπÔ∏è.  F them then, asshats.   üòúüòâ
---
Trust me, while it can be bad here, I've seen how it can be much worse. Ever seen cringeanarchy?
---
Ah j have had not found a lead point on those hills! Might be real estate shopping tomorrow. Thanks for the heads up.
---
I doubt you suck, this build is just kinda crazy easy
---
Right now, your ideal Pipe Bolt Action for queen-killing will be a 3* Anti-Armor, Zealot, VATS (+Crit Damage or reduced AP cost).  It's possible to find them, and get a friend to Prime the Receiver and make you 200-300 Ultracite ammo for it.  Failing that, a TSE Pipe Bolt Action is very powerful and remain very competitive even post-nerf patch.
---
There is no proof that the game goes free to play. Stop worrying about the things that hasn't happened yet(and probably won't even happen).
---
Oh I know, I have dealt with 3 at a time more than once.  You take what cover you can and pop stimpaks while taking what shots you can sometimes using vats, and concentrating on down them one at a time.  Initially you spend a lot of time blind, but if you can heal through that you can take them down.  And it seems like they want to land less often when they are in a group.
---
No, I known it couls be worse but its still obnoxious
---
Hah! For some reason, I read it as you fist shooting their kneecaps, walking away, coming back with a little DRILL to finish them off. But sometimes I read what I want to read.
---
Well thanks for thinking I dont suck, i love when people on reddit are actually nice
---
And the players who four years earlier were yelling "SHITSHITSHITNOSHI-!" yell "Shut up and take my money!" So why in holy hell would they change their approach?
---
I often wonder how many people out there are trying to hack into our accounts? 
---
it's my survival tactic. just start spamming shots at their legs until they just kind of cripple over and drag their leg. 
---
What sucks is not noticing it's a legendary one, and then when it's heals itself the leg repairs and it jumps at you again. 
---
&gt;In theory, getting a 3* TSE Handmade has a chance of 1:2,000,000 or so.
---
https://i.imgur.com/c4jt321.png
---
I agree with all of your points here but I'd like to add that when you mouse over an event, I'd love to see the timer so I don't map from one side of the map to the other only to have 23 seconds left to start and complete the whole event. 
---
I really like the camera positioning above the head, but it forces me to stand directly on top of a container to search contents. Can this be adjusted?
---
Be warned a Two-Shot weapon in VATS is...   finicky.  You will miss a LOT when you should be hitting, unless you burn through Crits.  It might be better to look for AA and other single-projectile Legendary traits.
---
You're getting so worked up over something that hasn't happened and wont happen.
---
But out of curiosity I'd like to know of the "literally all directions" that are pointing towards this game going F2P.
---
What's all this talk about the game going F2P? It's not going F2P.
---
I love this game but I think the future has only two options: 
---
They will do a complete overhaul, like they did with cod ww2 after comdrey left, and make some serious changes, and the game will thrive and be great. 
---
Or they keep giving us these small updates and eventually even the most hardcore fan will give up.
---
Can you quantify " Literally all directions are pointing to this game going F2P "?  Nothing real indicates it will end up f2p.  
---
All rise isnt an endgame weapon, it doesnt do any more damage than a normal modded sledge. The only nice thing about it is reduced weight to use it as a back up, but that's a common effect on other sledges, so it's not hard to replace
---
I understand. Ill be ok if they gave us like $60 worth of atoms 
---
Happy for the dude he wasted so much time nukeing places that aren't worth it 
---
I get more fusion cores than I could need by constantly hitting up a few power armor spawn locations (Belching Betty, Clarksburg in the tall building closest to the shooting range, and a little shed almost right across from Mama Dolce's). There's also a power armor station at the last one in case you haven't gotten the plans for one yet. 
---
Problem is, where would they put it? I don't think there's an easy solution
---
Thanks man I may not be on though
---
Lol I've always gotten downvoted for telling the truth so I feel ya
---
Yeah, that's why you don't pay attention to the quartering; his "evidence" is a store in Australia.
---
This was a stupid comment, I was just wondering because I saw it being cleared out. You are probably one of those toxic players
---
Lately I've got a few great perks on legendaries... level 40 legendaries :/
---
Zealots is +30% damage against any and all creatures with the Scorched type.  That includes SB's and Queens.  Add a Prime Receiver for even more damage.
---
Nope.  I just get sick of endlessly farming plastic.
---
Melee is more fun.
---
2 different beasts 
---
I would sit on FO4 and loose track of time 
---
Where 76 is more like a Burst play time , sometimes it goes , sometimes the server , some other time it‚Äôs the player base.
---
No his ghost is not seen walking down the street.
---
Only as long as they implement one of the standard style terminals as well. Reading text on that small, circular screen hurts my brain. 
---
Yes, that must be it then. I've scrapped enough of each armor to unlock all scrappable armor mods, and I've found each plan to unlock all other armor mods but two: Dense Leather Torso and Dense Metal Torso. I can't post a screenshot now but will when I am online tonight after work.
---
I- I actually kind of like the current boxing glove. I use one a lot. I call her Matilda. That being said, I do agree that it's actually kind of silly as is and I have to agree with you.
---
Well, you have to take pacifist off.  But I avoid PVP.
---
Sometimes seen
---
I am kind of already pissed that you can pick up the game for ‚Ç¨30 now.
---
Guess I'll use wooden armor and a cane people will soon realise wood is the best and the cane is a beast 
---
Downvoted because I camp there and claim dibs. (Just Kidding). 
---
add me up :)  ID: john13th
---
Some clickbait bloathard on youtube is pushing this rumor because of a  EB games store in Australia .
---
Let us unstack cards as well.
---
I'm level 316 and have had very few "god roll" drops. It's the diversity in the loot pool. It's like pulling the lever on 1,000 slot machines and hitting jackpot on all of em. I was around level 275 when I got my one and only two shot explosive drop. 
---
Look me up - on PC usually some during the day (working!) and some later nights.  Same handle....
---
I am by no means a min/maxed character but with just some iron fist perks and the armor pen perk I do pretty well with a heated power fist. I've been looking everywhere for a legendary power fist and scrapping to get other mods with no luck. 
---
I personally don't like power armor but you def have to be careful about rads/damage. I have max iron clad as well
---
I play it because overall I like it.  I also specifically mentioned wanting the MMO PvE experience.  What I don't like is the PvP element.  It also almost sounds like you're making a pretty good argument for why you should be playing something else instead, because I didn't mention reviews, support, or lack of mods as being an issue.    
---
And to answer your first comment-question, 'we' and 'us' is the collective group of people that don't want PvP on at all, that essentially are asking for the PvE experience only, and have specifically said as much on this board.   But presumably you should know that.  Or was I supposed to know them all by name?    
---
You also made a case for griefing (which was really just a single PvP experience), with the implication that a lot of people don't like it, going so far as to give suggestions on how they might learn to enjoy it.  Those 'people' and how 'they' might enjoy it include me, so the 'us' and 'we' are 'them' and 'me'.  You can use the search phrase, 'separate servers', on this board if you'd like read about us and our devilish ideas.  
---
Just a quick thought:  Don't you think it the least bit daft to offer suggestions and advice after literally just one so-called griefing experience?
---
What does TSE stand for? I've just started reading posts on this sub and I've seen it a few times
---
All the different stashes are basically for decoration. I have toolboxes, lockers and footlockers in my warehouse. My house has a desk, shelves and coolers. 
---
I have plans for this piece it‚Äôs the one that looks like a beneclava with fly eyes ?
---
Well look at it this way.  At least monster hunter is designed around you working to get new legendary armor and gear sets and jewels to make them great.  And you don't even have to nuke whitesprings. 
---
I was lucky enough to start on release and got the quest to kill the feral golfers around level 20 or so. I saw them spawn once and decided to go do another quest. By the time I went back, people had realized it was the farming area and a bunch of high levels were skewing the spawns. I died repeatedly and figured I'd come back when I was stronger. Now I'm level 87 and I haven't seen the things spawn since. 
---
Those same MMOs use rng boss drops not crafting to get the BIS gear... Not sure what point your trying to make there.
---
Some people like rng some don't, I agree it needs changed but simply put not in this way as it would ruin the game as it stands for most people as hardcore players would be in BIS in no time(which shortens the time they will likely play just ask any mmo junkie like myself) and casuals would be hurt by forcibly lowered legendary spawns
---
Name a few honestly bad legendary mods plz because after about 500 hours I'm yet to see onr
---
Picking pumpkins for Jack gives Atoms?  What? 
---
funny how virtually every other game manages to not mess up the simplest of things though, like not making your equipment disappear at random.
---
or in the event it does happen, have the tools to fix the situation so the month you spent farming wasn't in vain.
---
but no Fo76.
---
funny.
---
nope
---
It feels like they have no clue about what they are doing. Melee thats already OP will be drastically mega OP after the patch. No Gun Build will stand a chance in PvE
---
Yeah, this last patch has made things worse.  The freeze time for trying to open my pip-boy after loading is a little under a minute of just standing there and I've had infinite loading screens after trying to re-spawn after death...  Seriously, took the dog out, went to the bathroom, got something to eat... still loading...
---
Yeah there‚Äôs a bit more of an end goal
---
Because it's from the French, and means military materials and equipment. Hence Anti-Materiel. It's a large calibre sniper rifle to use against other military equipment
---
Silent Knights 
---
They should just make the area inside the den line unbuildable. 
---
Can confirm, also leave extractors unlocked for other players.
---
Stop fucking posting about F2P. That's how you squash it.
---
That‚Äôs a cool fact. Makes sense. 
---
Level 100 plus here played since day 0, same plan never nothing else 
---
It wasn‚Äôt always like that, server hopping used to work better. Someone else would have to be there solo and then you walk up for the spawns to return. If you hop from the same location you‚Äôre the first one there and your world spawns apply. 
---
The real secret to lead weights is green country lodge
---
Sentinel armor nerf incoming.
---
Fun little thing you set up.
---
Ah that was your research. I forgot where I read it!
---
I dump so much stuff in the watago suitcase or lunch pail.
---
What are tokens? 
---
PC would be easier than consoles of course. But maybe at least to draw attention to it, maybe one of their teams can come up with a solution, maybe not, it's worth looking into and even sending an update through the Inside the Vault articles. That would truly be the transparency the players want and Bethesda has promised. Even small QoL stuff like this, I'd appreciate knowing the developers are actively listening and working towards answering players concerns. 
---
People that duped have 25k coins on 25 different characters already, not really effecting them to much.  Coins are worthless, most people won't take them for anything good in the game and you can't buy anything useful with them.
---
lol this is your first Fallout game and you‚Äôre lecturing everyone about how the lore is supposed to be
---
Using a cheat in game to profit on ebay is one thing....using a cheat in game to stalk people in there under pants is just extra :/
---
I don‚Äôt play that way nor fo I care what is someone else‚Äôs inventory.
---
I make my armor and guns. I have no legendaries. I like to do a bit of role playing. I don‚Äôt use power armor unless I have to. I play a sniper. 
---
This game is the antithesis of trying to play at a Meta level. It simply does not matter because of game design. There is very limited competition in PVE or PVP. 
---
&gt; uMainMenuDelayBeforeAllowSkip = 0
---
Thanks, I've been trying to remember this one since the beta
---
It's also stupid that you have to equip your grenades again everytime you log back in.....
---
I camped there from about level 30-100. Now I'm over behind BOS HQ. Got a LED vein to mine
---
But if I have understanded this correctly, it has nothing to do with Beth. It's the retailers who sell it cheaper.
---
And then people want more because Lead Belly and crafting perks...
---
Maybe make it harder to perk swap so you actually have to make a choice before you set out, before people have asked for every non combat perk or weight perk to be passive.
---
It doubles(?) the power output of the Poseidon power boxes around the region. 
---
There should be a standalone terminal you can place on desks, its silly that theres only this 1 kind thats not found anywhere else and is on a crappy table
---
I think there is a flag on a pole and another that is a flag you hang on the wall? 
---
Same here. I even built a lighted, covered bridge. [https://scontent-ort2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/49123134\_2037087346382790\_4756800873026289664\_o.jpg?\_nc\_cat=106&amp;\_nc\_ht=scontent-ort2-1.xx&amp;oh=3edd78559769e5e2a7649dd56efe8d5a&amp;oe=5CFE8A45](https://scontent-ort2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/49123134_2037087346382790_4756800873026289664_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-ort2-1.xx&amp;oh=3edd78559769e5e2a7649dd56efe8d5a&amp;oe=5CFE8A45)
---
So if nothing happens would he actually post a correction video?
---
So tired of these impossibly floating buildings.
---
Upvoted for the sheer amount of work you put into this. I applaud you.
---
Here's hoping Bethesda finally puts a similar amount of work into their game, rather than just re-using assets from fallout 4!
---
Yea, been doing this myself, sort of, in a blast zone. Didn't want to annoy the higher level, so I just shotgunned every glowing one's knees.   
---
It's quite funny to see higher level glowing ones all lay on the floor. He proceeded to head shot them with some plasma rifle thingy and I just melee'd them slowly to death (Ammo is expensive!)  
---
Never realised that a shotgun build does pretty well and it makes for funny moments, as I cripple every single enemy I come across now.   
---
At least Super Mutants seem to be able to heal after a while and get up again. Haven't seen this yet on ghouls.  
---
(I'm at level \~60).
---
Leg crippling is a viable strategy. First leg hit makes them slow, second immobile.
---
Maybe it's the real bad backlash on how bad this game is and isn't worth your hard earned money or the fact they keeping adding items to atomic shop every week or it could be the fact this game is  doing that bad you can pick it up for ¬£25 
---
Yeah swarm of suitors is still broken. Glitched on my last 3 attempts.
---
I do! I have a lvl 50 Executioner‚Äôs Deathclaw Gauntlet. And I know I have some melee as well.
---
But seriously, if you're looking to break away from the meta (which I'm not sure what it is) try different builds, granted for armor there's not much you can do in terms of variety, you don't move faster or slower so it makes sense to just go for highest DR.
---
For weapons, although not as much variety as Fallout 4 due to some weapons being broken (energy weapons) you could still do something fun with the weapons you can use.
---
It really works!
---
haha you wont need to it will be free :P
---
Ha true. "Why is it not reloading, oh I held it too long, bye bye weapon."
---
I still don't know exactly how it works lol. Anytime I need to give someone something I just drop a bullet on the ground then transfer the rest to the bag. Every time I have tried to trade the other person either neither opens the menu or has no idea what to do when they do. It's a bad system.
---
The more ppl that show up the more her resistances go up.
---
As tse has no anti armor on it at certain points only melee does noticeable damage. 
---
Mini nukes and orbital strikes as well.
---
It must be nice having your own crystal ball. Change your name to the great prognosticator. 
---
Hey Amiel_h thanks for coming to the rescue,  didnt see those 2 charred over there and was not in my PA so i died twice lol! Had to log out because im already late. But ill try the text chat mod later see if that'll give us better coms. 
---
Very well done! That's really impressive.
---
Yes, it is just EXTREMELY rare.
---
i deleted FO76 and downloaded the 50 gigs again for nothing, still getting this error.
---
not workign correctly, i should be getting a syringer drill or flaregun 3/10 times.
---
50k seems reasonable 
---
I came up with this idea and posted about it weeks ago. 
---
So shadow is pretty much renting somebody else super powered beef my computer and stream display and inputs on to anything ?
---
Fallout and a bunch of other games use vivox voice communications. This includes games on the Battle.net platform - there's likely something funky going on with unloading of the dll from the game executable. As far as I know, it runs externally from the game engine as its own thing in memory. This explains why it's not disconnecting properly.
---
The question now is why isn't the dll unloading properly - leaving connections to the voice server open to anyone that was connected previously. It's likely an issue within fo76's code, which needs to be fixed.
---
No game would NOT add items to their cash shop.  It would be financially stupid to do so.  Plus those items are the easiest things to produce so that's why you see it every week.
---
I moved away from the Forest for a week, once. Set up a nice, quiet cabin North of Blackwater Mine, with a farm for Adhesive crops. Everything seemed fine at first.
---
After seven days and nights of quiet, the molerats started showing up. Then the mongrels. No big deal, my turrets could mostly take care of them. They never did any significant damage. Maybe I'd have to replace a tato crop or two.
---
Then the super mutants started showing up. And the Scorched. I thought it was a random encounter but they just kept coming. Day after day. They started blowing chunks of my house away! Whole walls would be GONE when I came home from scavenging!
---
Then the goddamn sentrybot started spawning regularly, with its minigun from Hell, just up the hill from my house. It would kill me at least once per encounter.
---
The final straw: on the eight day, all of the above showed up at once. Plus a Deathclaw. By the time the smoke cleared, my armor was broken, my stimpaks depleted, and my house was a smoldering ruin.
---
I'll never leave the Forest again. And anyone who does is a fool!
---
This is a vast difference from all other times I‚Äôve taken on the queen.  Damage goes down at a normal rate then then does not change for the rest of the 20 or so minutes of people fighting it.
---
... dont look at the new patch notes :( 
---
I'm just scared to open my pip boy in the first 2 mins
---
You know becase what your trying to explain to me is obvious. 
---
The whole point your missing is that Its not fun. 3 scorch, not landing, and spamming blinding green balls is not challenging, it is tedious. It's all about endurance not strategy.
---
Yeah! My primary reason for taking workshops is to experiment with building, however blueprints are not big enough to save my Forts, and I dont want to use my resources if the server can crash right after 
---
I always think that it would be great if it just automatically saved what I built and reverted back to it as soon as I take the workshop again
---
Ah that is a possibility. 
---
About 130, on a keyboard.
---
I get your argument for console, but it would literally be a 5minute programming change to have a separate bind on platforms with enough buttons.
---
Ive had a couple of infinite loading screens but more freezing when opening pip boy
---
Why?
---
I have a great 3* cane if you are serious. 
---
Happening to me every damn time i put it down 
---
How about this: just don't build ***turrets*** at The Whitespring. Who cares if I have a decontamination shower and all the workbenches there? 
---
How do you get the serum recipes? 
---
It‚Äôs definitely not.  Anything besides your stash is going to go away eventually.
---
[FEEDBACK] Personal Mr. Handy: Please create a Mr. Handy or other robot we can have at our camps that we can buy/sell items to. It would also be nice if we could utilize this robot for camp protection and also to man a store we could set up to sell to other players. Sorry if this has been mentioned before. But this is something that I would gladly pay atoms for. 
---
Personal Traveling Companion: I realize one of the main goals of the game is team play but there are many solo players. Instead of forcing us into a social situation many do not want allow us to select a traveling companion that can fight by our side; dog, super mutant, robot or maybe something else. Again, I‚Äôd pay atoms for this feature.
---
Nope, gotta get at least one damaging hit on it
---
I accidentally dropped my Two Shot Dragon by pressing the wrong button and when I look down it‚Äôs gone I‚Äôm ready to give up on 76 or if someone tell me how or where to get the Two Shot dragon again I will be grateful 
---
Yeah doesn't help that the game lacked the most basic feature in existence aka push to talk for over a month. By the time they added it most people were just used to not talking to people, like me. Even more sad we have a mod made by one guy for text chat and Bethesda still hasn't even mentioned adding it in.
---
not atm, selling serums but hitting caps limit too frequently.
---
No longer triggers for me on entering the school, as you say announcer now proclaims  "await the upcoming Monster Mash on Monday" or something close.
---
I'm looking for Heavy Leather Armor Plans so I'm sad. Maybe it is now only a weekly event?
---
I know the feeling I just run around boxing most stuff on my melee build character it's just pretty hilarious to see a dainty woman absolutely slaughter everything. That and having all the mutations makes it actually quite viable to do. It's like killing the SB's in 4 hits never gets old either.
---
I thought I was the only one lol. I haven‚Äôt played fallout 3 in about 6 years now. 
---
As an fyi the builder paths aren't possible.
---
Saving level ups doesn't work the way the builder suggests they do.
---
I don't know why they haven't removed it tbh
---
Rn the meta is armor with the effect of -8 less damage from players and the sentinel effect with a tse shotgun I wanna use the assaultron head but until the ammo gets fixed I'll just leave it for now ahaha guess I could get a gamma gun and become part of the atom invests in every perk that makes rads helpfull maybe even start a cult 
---
Ps4? 
---
They are like a piece of wood furniture with a french polish. Abnormal sheen. 
---
Name one paid game that has micro transactions for cosmetics that cost as much is this game. The only reason games like fortnight can sell cosmetics this much is because they‚Äôre free to play. BGS is no longer making money on this game that‚Äôs why the prices have dropped. They won‚Äôt continue to support this game if there is a profit and they‚Äôre not going to profit and less they go F2P. If you can‚Äôt see the signs of this game going F2P then you don‚Äôt know a damn thing about the video game industry. You don‚Äôt need a crystal ball to have fore site you fucking idiot you just need to be observant and watch what the company is actually fucking doing
---
Me too, but I seriously wish they didn't squeak. That squeaking drives me nuts!
---
They would be sadly disappointed if they got into my account, I don‚Äôt have any of the legendary weapons or stuff. Lol
---
&gt; real bad backlash on how bad this game is and isn't worth your hard earned money
---
Yeah the game is pretty broken and missing a lot of features that should have been there day 1, but its ***nowhere near*** as bad as "youtubers" are making it out to be. 
---
&gt; they keeping adding items to atomic shop every week
---
Not sure how adding more content to the game is a bad thing. Now, if you said it's overpriced, then yeah, I'd agree. But it's still content, cosmetic content that you can very easily just not buy if it bothers you so.
---
&gt; doing that bad you can pick it up for ¬£25
---
Most of the people who are playing the game now have bought it day 1, all game sales drop after the first two weeks (or months in this case). And while the price does hurt me personally a little as I've bought the game for 60, things like this happen all the time, it's not just limited to Fallout 76. That's not an excuse, I'm just saying its not an issue specific to 76.
---
As opposed to the reality check when it doesn't go free to play?
---
Same here, it used to trigger on walking up to the entrance, never starts now, maybe bugged, but looks like it has been changed.
---
Thanks a lot kind stranger!
---
[https://imgur.com/a/NJC1lDo](https://imgur.com/a/NJC1lDo)
---
Wasn't that fixed in the last patch?
---
Very strong as it takes far less perk points than a typical melee build does for damage.
---
I‚Äôm familiar with the raid on the armory at Harper‚Äôs Ferry (which was then in VA). I have never heard this tale. 
---
Southerners did compose a song about him called ‚ÄúJohn Brown‚Äôs Body‚Äù celebrating his execution. 
---
Calling me a dimwit and listening youtubers about FO76? 
---
I take my words back, you should worrie about this, worrie until you have a f*cking heart attack, you moron.
---
If this game didn‚Äôt have fallout in the title all these fanboys would be trashing the fuck out of it lol
---
Go online and put together a perk build for your character. Lots of good perks are locked behind having a minimum stat. If you don't have something of a plan it's easy to not be able to get some of the better cards for your playstyle. I personally skipped this step to get a feel for what I wanted to do. Then I build a new character once I hit level 30ish and started over with a plan. 
---
That really sucks. Sorry you had to deal with that crap. I've launched 8 or 9 nukes now and never had that issue before, hopefully I don't run into it. The most issues I've had with my team are disconnects at inopportune times, and becoming invisible to each other when running the silo.
---
Dude no, you are good.
---
The low levels that do nothing add a crazy ammount to the queens health. And if a high level player launches the nuke on her it ratchets her health to freaking ridiculous  heights. Plus all the low lvls add more spawns of mobs on the ground.
---
As it is right now there is no point in fighting  her at random because of this. Low lvls break her. 
---
If you want to fight her just start a lfg and bully all the low lvls out so you can get some actual  heavy hitters in. This is all we have till private servers come 
---
I used to work in software development, and we would keep track of how many people requested a feature. The more people who requested a feature would make that ticket a higher priority for us. I assume Bethesda uses a similar process. 
---
Everyone was getting kicked out.
---
&gt; Rn the meta is armor with the effect of -8 less damage from players and the sentinel effect with a tse shotgun
---
Ah, I don't PVP so that would explain why I haven't heard of the meta.
---
And yeah I'm with you, I'd love to be the beautiful Enclave Prince I was always meant to be with my plasma rifle, but at the moment it does shit damage, breaks easy, and half the time the projectiles don't even hit.
---
I'm currently rocking a power fist build, really fun to just full sprint punch someone's head off.
---
I have a clean locker by the front door; an icebox in the kitchen; a desk, vanity, and dresser in the bedroom; and a metal box, cabinet, and tool box in the workshop. I play with several friends, and I like having multiple accesses to the stash all over my house.   
---
I feel like they wanted you to be able to personalize your house so the "stash box" doesn't always have to look like a stash box.
---
Normal on console
---
Yep I had a Dense mod and 2 ranks of Fireproof, and about 221 DR. It still did damage but very little. The only thing that did hurt was their poison cloud.
---
And good god are scorchbeasts annoying to fight. I normally avoid them, this reminded me why.
---
I know... It is more symbolic than powerful. But for me that symbol was  a lot :)
---
Uum i have stylus in my pants
---
Your presence has been requested. r/fo76FilthyCasuals 
---
Ooomph! One to gut! :(
---
this same thing happened to me. once i dumped everything into my stash i was fine. 
---
any reality check would be good, really. denial is one hell of a drug. any criticism is met with cynicism.
---
pretending everything is fine ain't gonna get you anywhere.
---
Head straight for Cola Nut perks. 
---
Oh man I'm just reading the comments and I'm realizing that I'm not alone! There's a lot of maniacs out there!
---
That is not how it works. Bethesda sets the max and min prices and retailers mostly have no say in it. Actually if they do sell cheap without approval of Bethesda they can be fined. Retailers have no say in this and the prices are set as Bethesda chooses. 
---
Nah. Not at all the same mate.
---
Servers wouldn't be able to handle it ; )
---
That apply's to Bethesda as well, don't have complete confidence in them that they could make that change without breaking 101 other things either anymore :(
---
But you can sell them? 
---
I always sell mine for 20 caps a piece to other players. 
---
If they are really common I drop them off to low level players. 
---
Are t you able to change your bottom settings? 
---
Mob aggro should be multiplied on low level players in the nuke zone. Basically an effort to keep them out. 
---
Doesnt seem that much at all with all Addictions. 
---
You know it's up to Bethesda Austin (who are not the main Bethesda guys) to bring the game to a more positive light.  They do seem to work on the fixes pretty hard but I'm still not convinced of future worthwhile content.
---
Going free to play would put a hold on such content until they fully transitioned over.  And if people are bothered by silly cosmetic items being expensive then just watch what happens if it goes ftp.  Weapons, armor, xp boosters and the like which will inevitably make it a chore to play the game normally.
---
Automatic rifle would be commando perks btw.
---
Heavies are the Gatling gun and chain guns etc.
---
I‚Äôm an Automatic build. 
---
I consider it pretty good. I eat through Ammo more than my Rifle build though.
---
I‚Äôm only using a crafted Submachine gun. No legendary yet.
---
Yeah it is. Get yourself a handmade or even a .45 combat rifle with a powerful automatic receiver and with the commando/tank killer perks it does pretty good damage.
---
I'm level 25 and in ten rolls, I got 5 pieces of armor better than any of the crap I'm currently wearing. \*sigh\*
---
My own fault though. I refuse to go farm for legendaries  at my level.
---
I know for a fact that I've gotten legendaries without getting hits in. Could that be when I've played in a team?
---
That's a great picture and I love the camp you built! No problem :)
---
Also Alt+F1 is screen cap with nVidia, so you snap a picture and then melee or grenade the thing you‚Äôre looking at! 
---
Ah, yep that would do it
---
a bug that happened to me before, was dropping junk fast dropped my explosive shotgun, maybe it dropped it since it was equipped? happened 3 times before the last update, but I also drop stuff more slowly now
---
Wheres the error history? Last night i had 7 in an hour. I couldnt play more than 10 minutes. Twice it crashed the moment i loaded in. Ive reinstalled the game rebuilt my hdd and nothing has helped.
---
I try to do this but over the weekend I found myself sharing the event with someone only armed with a boxing glove, who seemed to spend the time running away from the legendary moles. 
---
You are not forced to do anything. Is Bloodied too strong. Personally I say yes. But the glass cannon you have to become to use it is still way more effort and skill than getting a duplicated TSE gun. And thats the main issue, the thousands of duplicated TSE in the game. If it was left up to RNG then they woulnt be a problem like they are.
---
I saw the plan last night at the vendor in watoga 10500 caps
---
Alright, let's have a look at those numbers. I'm going to calculate the damage for a "normal" Pump Shotgun with the same mods. The Bethesda Community Manager has stated that both two-shot and explosive currently add +100% damage. Therefore 428 / 2 / 2 = 107  
---
Normal, no perks: 107  
---
TSE, no perks: 428  
---
Yep it's only 4x the raw damage, but FO76 uses something called a Damage Coefficient, you can check out the formula here: http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance
---
Pit those weapons against a moderately high level enemy, like a Scorchbeast with 200 damage resistance and you get actual damage:
---
Normal, no perks: 43  
---
TSE, no perks: 283  
---
Wow, it's 6.58x higher. The more perks and other damage multipliers you add the greater this ratio becomes. Add the 3 Shotgunner perks and TSE deals 6.63x the damage. Stack enough perks and buffs...
---
What do the other legendary affixes do? The only other suffix that adds damage is +10% while aiming, that does't compare to explosive at all. The "slayer's" prefixes add +30% against specific enemies, somewhat controllable "Mutant's" adds +10%, Furious is good if you can shoot the same target 20+ times, Bloodied deserves its own evaluation.
---
My guess is they're not adding it because it would take a whole new set of staff to moderate it 24/7.  Ever seen WOW chat?  It often devolves into trolls and racism like everything else on the internet that goes unmoderated.
---
or Tormentor perk for rifles. Its amazing to cripple with 15% chance at full auto speed.
---
Not watoga station
---
I kneecap deathclaws and Yao-gui constantly. It's the best way to deal with them
---
Don‚Äôt apologize for taking his water. It‚Äôs an infinite resource for him. I left all my water purifiers exposed and built waaayyyy more than I needed just so someone wandering by, even groups, would be able to grab enough to completely heal them and quench their thirst and then some. 
---
Might be someone with a shotgun and Enforcer perks. Cripple her wing and she stays down longer.
---
Do something better with your time besides counting errors....if u were actually playing the game instead u could have added 2 or 3 more errors lol all jokes aside huge problem hope it gets fixed nothing more annoying then constant blue screen 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo7K0T2grYg
---
Or even fucking 1 cap. Anything is better than just throwing them on the ground until they despawn. 
---
The video [turned out very well](https://youtu.be/Wdcn5nsLPVk)!
---
I've also seen a video about the fact that it might be going free to play. I'm a bit pissed since I spent about ¬£70 on it and it's going free to play this early but hope fully they give us compensation.
---
You have been awarded 500 atoms üòÇ
---
Change them to this, you won't be sorry.... Discord is default.
---
Alt-~=discord, Alt-f1=steam, Alt-f2=Ubi, Alt-f3=shadowplay....
---
For real though, overlays are getting out if hand
---
Thats clearly a hyperbole.
---
&gt; They do seem to work on the fixes pretty hard but I'm still not convinced of future worthwhile content.
---
The way I look at that is this, if elder scrolls online (which was just as bugged if not more so than 76 on launch) and no mans fucking sky can make a comeback, so can this. 
---
And personally, even with all the bugs and broken aspects of 76, I still think it's in a better state now than those two games were when they launched.
---
This is what I do to Assaultrons - I love to hear them bitch at me. ‚ÄúOkay, we‚Äôll call it a draw!‚Äù
---
Maybe it will or maybe theres just very little demand for the game. Especially in disc form.
---
Oh I'm not pretending anything Bethesda have fucked majorly and the game is a hot buggy mess (still love it) it wont go free 2 play though not for a couple of years at least. Maybe a PS+ game one month towards Xmas (1 year anniversary) but that's about it.
---
There's not enough content to make it worth it, and adding another 500k users is the last thing Bethesda need when there crappy servers can't handle it when 1 person dupes a few thousand items.
---
They also need to keep an eye on there next Sky rim / Elder Scrolls / Fallout title. Rinsing everyone for 60 bucks then going f2p within the first 6-12 months is just going to be a final nail in there coffin.
---
Just because i disagree with the f2p rumors some random you tuber started to get clicks doesn't mean I'm in denial about anything really does it other than i need a little more fact checking than some random you tube persons word.
---
This has been happening to me fairly frequently. Also constantly moving into and out of build mode can now cause me so freeze up on entering a workbench. My console literally has never frozen on any other game ever and I‚Äôve had it for two years. 
---
Its a baseless claim AFAIK that got put out by one of these click-addict YouTubers. I highly doubt they will make it free as there is no real way to earn any profit otherwise. 
---
That means it's gonna update soon, it did this for me when the camo hunting rifle came out
---
There was a lot of fake info before launch.
---
Settings &gt; System &gt; Error History
---
‚ÄúHere lies ElJSalvaje, killed by his own explosive western revolver... again‚Äù
---
Too many
---
42 is hyperbole? 
---
PC. 
---
If it's a bad game design that can be easily compensated for by the players then the responsibility also does fall on the players to not be selfish players about it. You can blame Bethesda for a player's lack of situational awareness for other player's wants and needs but in the end it's the player who pulls the trigger and takes advantage of a flawed system at the expense of others. This type of selfish gameplay is as cheep as duping
---
Ppl do that?
---
Btw two shot and explosives are both being nerfed.
---
Explosive is going down to 20% damage and two shot to 25%, both do 100% right now.
---
I don't think that's the right question. the right question is, "is it possible"? and the answer is yes. lots of online games turn f2p after a disastrous release.
---
but of course this sub is gonna go into full denial mode and scrutinize everything, including the color of the guy's underwear. let's put it this way: you sound just as desperate as the people trying to rationalize why it's going f2p.
---
I have like 100 of the same plan. Every session I join. I drop one, along with other stuff like stim paks inside a suitcase by the vendors.
---
SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSALTY
---
Ah the Rng is horrible. I had nothing usable except a 3* fireaxe up to 140 ( Rifles of all types build).
---
Then over 10 levels got 2 shot 10mm, furious exploding 10mm, medics exploding radium, 2 shot radium, furious exploding radium and The assault rifle on the way to 151. Just in time for nerfs.( although furious exploding isn't terrible with high rof)
---
FML, lost my TSE 10mm Pistol, it broken, went to repair and poof! Nowhere such is suck. #Notaduper
---
Did you install any Nexus mods?
---
If yes: You forgot to add the sources in the custom.ini
---
If no: No idea from my side, sorry :/
---
On the plus side we can change how our character looks for free instead of paying ten dollars just to change their face
---
it's like trying to stomp out tism fires, if you actually watch the video you can hear how ridiculous the claim is lol.
---
&gt; Well said, now its a case of not being able to play a game you purchased because of some self centred millennial.
---
Isn't it the case also, where people who are far too low to contribute, are ruining the game for the 5+ (leveled) other people in the nuke zone when the event fails? They paid the same money as well. Age has nothing to do with it, but if the pejorative version of millenial was to be tossed around, wouldn't it be to those who want free gear and xp by getting a few shots on the boss then hiding in the shed? 
---
Bethesda obviously messed up by making zones too open, level-range wise. With any other MMO, a 20 couldn't walk into a raid for 120's such as in WoW. 
---
You don‚Äôt understand economics. ‚ÄúNo longer making money‚Äù? Do you have a source for that claim? This game cost very little to produce...comparatively. It is a Fallout 4 port, they used a lot of player mods. The major expense was the limited voice acting. 
---
All of the original costs are ‚Äúsunk costs‚Äù. They will not be used in decision making going forward. The decision making will revolve around the financials of ongoing expenses vs revenue. 
---
Anecdotally, I purchase from the Atom store. I purchase a lot. The Pareto Principle would suggest that 80% of their revenue comes from 20% of the player base. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter how many crybabies complain. At the end of the day a minority of players will happily pay their bills.
---
I read that wrong, lol. I saw 34k crashes.
---
I always always always pick up the legendaries I get and put them there for other players to grab. 
---
I know your pain.  I got DC'ed doing that quest twice and restarted from the beginning both times, then, then stumbled upon the glass cavern by accident and picked it up from there.  Yes, some things that are a challenge in this game are tedious and not fun.  I see complaints about the SB trio often, and maybe BGS will make a change there sometime.  Until then we have what we have. Post your thoughts on the Bethesda.net FO76 forum too if you want a better chance for changes.
---
I only hope FO76 gets as much love as ESO gets.
---
I was heading into a nuke zone... Crash...
---
Googled how to check the error log...
---
Counted to 42...took all of 1 minutr
---
Then you have trouble with acid for smelting...there's always gonna be something you're running short of.
---
Ok I see how that would be annoying 
---
It's probably not going f2p, sorry. Overall I think it would be a good thing though
---
I had my first encounter with the stocking mothman up at the red rocket mega station. Was waiting on my friend to come back from being AFK and decided to wonder the near by hills. I didn't hear the chimes but heard a weird noise. Looked around and seen this black "fog" and was like tf was that. Then out of nowhere the mothman appeared. I was like oh sh\*t and was like bro you need to hurry up and get back mothman is here (we were using discord to chat) I shot him a few times with my hardened sniper rifle but only seemed to do minimum damage to him as his sonic attacks seemed to keep my shots from hitting him. By the time my friend returned the mothman was gone and i didnt have the chance of seeing him. That just leaves the Flatwoods monster for me to find and i can say i have seen all the cryptids in fallout 76 minus the scortched beast queen as im too low level to drop nukes or venture into the area to help with the event.
---
As do I.
---
That would be a good cap sink. Spend 5000 caps to respec
---
oh right, I said I didn't know who he was, do didn't know if he was a click bait kinda fella. but either way what I said about amazon is true
---
Coming to the atomic shop soon
---
Makin a funny count whatever u want lol it‚Äôs ur life 
---
&gt; and it's going free to play this early
---
But it's not tho...
---
Yes but never BIS gear tokens in MMOs are generally used as a catch-up system to boost people to current content level but then they need to go farm the raid for months to get BIS gear.
---
Does it matter?
---
TSE combat shotty + their  camp = joy
---
The standard version is available for all platforms on Amazon in the US. That video is based on pure garbage speculation. A rumor about a "store" in Australia isn't selling copies of vanilla fo76 is so silly.
---
its ok, im already getting downvoted for suggesting it
---
Core usage is tied to ap drain.
---
Its intended.
---
100s
---
Yes I do. It was significant because I don't usually spot changes in any part of life unless is significant! LOL. One character of mine doesn't even have Class Freak and food and water seems same
---
ok, but what I said about amazon uk is true, probably just a coincidence I guess.....
---
I am told that the 5mm gatling guns are nice, which is good because I have an anti-armor and an assassins gatling.
---
Haha, love the poster. Still haven't had a single worthwhile legendary since launch, I'm holding out for one soon.
---
I've had 100s of crashes since the game came out and it's gotten progressively worse
---
Posts like this just feed a hivemind, I doubt it goes f2p but if that's what people wanna be angry about today lol
---
Toronto Stock Exchange
---
oh no muh physical copy!
---
But then I wouldn't be able to drop a battle bunker with rocket turrets on SBQ
---
you're nicer than I am.. I usually show them in the face.. I've survived a multitude of places I shouldn't with that little trick...
---
Crazy...
---
no, nothing matters, neither my comment, or your reply, life is just and endless void waiting quietly for death, and one day it will come
---
In the book it was a union song 
---
You didn't do a great job on blocking people's identities in this screenshot.
---
Do you still have yours? I also lost mine a few days ago on ps4
---
So for curiosities sake. What happens if i shoot out the support for your base. 10 cap bounty for total destruction? Or does it just "store" the camp until you repair the base support that was destroyed?
---
Yes, it's 100% bad coding. My guess is it's a memory leak.
---
A TSE 1 shot is a legit kill and the player gets loot. If turrets take something out without a player tagging it, nobody gets loot. 
---
Thanks. 
---
Basically the only requirements are tank killer/three commando perks, right?
---
Thats true. Acid is my most desired item, however plenty of workshops have it, vendors sometimes sell it. Anglers drop 6 at a time. Its not very hard to get. Im still making something like 5k bulkets a week with much more minimal work invested than when i used to go scrapping for items to collect resources. 
---
It got nerfed I think. It doesnt give 50s , not sure if it ever used to. Too easy to farm I guess. 
---
To the left of Flatwoods
---
I have chameleon armor and was always wondering what caused me to stay invisible for good. I'll be using this on demand now
---
A few tubers have said as such but none have produced anything to back it up. Not sure if it helps but 76 is still on sale on UK Amazon.
---
You can't currently.
---
The best you can do is try to find another legendary super sledge with the same or better effects, or trade with someone who has a level 50 version.
---
I prefer aimed rifle fires to spray &amp; pray ‚Äî for pretty much the same reasons the U.S. Army &amp; Marines do ‚Äî but it's mostly a matter of individual preference.
---
I got you. I personally hate melee, just not my play style in any game. Even though it does seem to limit me in FO76. 
---
Do the mission when your lvl 50 or higher. Or buy one from someone else. Cant improve weapons lvl.
---
That's what I've been doing recently. I noticed that the legendary hasn't been showing up in there as much recently though. I feel like they tweaked his spawn rate.
---
I'm next to a missile site too. I built mine on the side of a mountain. Only way to get to it by walking is climbing to the very top and calculating how you jump down. The only thing I ever hear is the wind howling and the only thing I ever see is the bombs in the distance. Peaceful. 
---
&gt; Some clickbait bloathard on youtube is pushing this rumor 
---
So pretty much the same old same old that's been happening since November.
---
I love it but please no spiders Bethesda, those things scarow the shit out of me.
---
whats your secert for nukes zones without PA, a shit load of Rad-X?
---
Did you count how many ppl were around?
---
And yet, in Skyrim you hold the RT button for power attack.
---
Beth, plz 'splain
---
Have you recently taken a rad away or diluted rad away? They increase diesase chance by 50%. As for disease resistance. I like to run rejuvenated in the endurance tree. With this perk maxed out being well fed and well hydrated gives 70% disease resistance and a greater boost to AP regen then action boy. Just use razorgrain soup to keep hunger and thirst full and this has 10% disease resistance for a total of 80% disease resist.
---
"Stalker's Sky Sword ‚òÖ"
---
Unless I'm missing a Legend of Zelda DLC this is probably meant to be "Ski Sword".
---
Make sure you get Ammosmith and Super Duper. You will burn through ammo pretty fast
---
I had a look at the Uk amazon, it seems to be some sort of special edition (with badges) or from the marketplace (not amazon themselves), but not the vanilla version
---
You're only saying that because we toss grenades at our feet when trying to smack a ghoul in the head.
---
Unfortunately not, they are great b/c they can be daisy chained (at power cost per unit), free standing, and are a good source of light. 
---
‚ÄúTis but a scratch‚Äù
---
I just dump the duplicates into blue suitcases.   Sometimes they are nice ones.   Wish I could find more armor plans tho.   Buggers are hard to find for some reason.   On PC.
---
Yes, player can compensate. But player has to go literally against the entire progression philosophy for it. You level up, make a build, find legendary weapons that are much sought-after and then...you're supposed to put it all away for events? Doesn't make sense. In most other games, you have to bring your A-game to group events, not cripple yourself.
---
I blame Bethesda for poor game design. I cannot blame a large player base, vast majority of whom come into the game from single player, or multiplayer that was actually *designed* properly, for not knowing the local ethos of public events of this specific game, *because* it is poorly designed. Had Bethesda made the design intuitive, this wouldn't be an issue. Had Bethesda balanced the weapons properly, this wouldn't be an issue. 
---
My argument is, getting Bethesda (1-400 people) to fix their shit may be easier than getting millions of players in this game to play counter-intuitively. It's a numbers game. You see Bethesda fixing the exploits, instead of trying to get exploiters to stop exploiting? Same principle. It's easier to fix the issue, for all players, than to get all players to dance around the issue. 
---
I'll probably do that at some point. Make a new character with a different build that is.
---
If the game mechanics (re s.p.e.c.i.a.l and perks) were different I would have preferred to just respec my character on the fly though. But a new beginning doesn't sound too bad.
---
15 charisma is great if you like to run a ton of charisma perks. I like it, so my main has 15 cha. However most of the best cards to share with the team are 3-star cards, so you only really need charisma 9. There are very few 4-star or 5-star cards worth sharing. But it is fun to surprise people and whip out adrenaline 5, or gunsmith 5 for people who dont have enough Int to run it at that level. I also took strong back 4 and pretty much most or the weight reduction cards. Its cool to suddenly share a weight reduction with the team after a mission when people cant fast travel. "Now all your power cores weigh nothing".
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Anyway, its pretty cool having a high charisma. When solo, I run Lone Wanderer 3 (4), Field Surgeon 2, Tenderizer 3, Suppressor 3, Happy Camper 2, and Travel Agent. When I am on a team, I run Inspirational 3, Rad Sponge 3, Tenderizer 3, and Suppressor 3, and Team Medic 3. I also have Team Medic 2, so I can run Strange in Numbers 1. From Endurance I also have Ghoulish 3, so I'm in a position to share it or Rad Sponge 3 for nuke zones, if anyone else is in a position to share the other. It makes Nuke Zones a relaxing time, at least in terms of Rads. :)
---
I'm also well over level 120, so I'm collecting all the buff cards to share. Glow Sight. Tormentor. Tank Killer. Bloody Mess. Adrenaline 5. Fireproof. Cannibal 3. Demolitions 5. All the cards that slow weapon and armor degradation. Almost all the charisma cards. I even picked up Ironclad 5 to share with stealth characters in hazmat suits in nuke zones. :)
---
Anyway, its pretty fun. And in terms of offense, I just run 1 point in each of the rifleman perks. I can solo Nuke zones carefully if I need to, and I just have a crappy 1-star bloodied handmade and a crappy 1-star executioners lever action. Of course it also helps that I have sneak 3 and escape artist.
---
So I'm not a mega powerhouse, but I'm solid solo and useful on teams.
---
No, it's marine tactical helmet
---
Now that's funny.  You pissed him off so much that he has to heal himself so he could bitch slap you.
---
So the cripple perk gives a percent chance to cripple a limb with that shot fired. Each shot has a chance to cripple a limb. However, all limbs have a health bar that you can take down to cause it to become crippled. You can see this health bar if you use vats with concentrated fire. But you can still damage limbs if you shoot them outside of vats, it can just be harder to be accurate. 
---
A hat and glasses spawn in the room hes in, on your left when you enter on the desk and table behind it. Whoever was there first probably looted the room and sold it all off. 
---
Don't hold the button down.... Unless you want the boom.
---
"Oh, yeah, I did want to loot this body in the full screen menu in the middle of this Queen fight. Thanks game!"
---
GRAHM?
---
Damn, okay thanks 
---
Just do what they did for power attacks in Skyrim on console, hold down the R2/RT (ps4/xbo respectively) and leave the grenades on R1/RB.
---
They also spawns in drop site c2 and g3.
---
I made the mistake of doing it on lvl 30 i cant do the mission again
---
But then I have seen people on my friends list with game time of 4 to 5 hours... I can't imagine getting that long without a crash.
---
If you own any TSE and didn't find them I will gladly take them off your hands and sell them to a bot vendor so the duped weapons can be stopped!
---
Max hard bargain and grape mentats bring it down to 9800. Still ridiculous
---
Estimate probably 12-15. A few 50-80 lvls few 100+ and one 200+ player
---
Yea not the greatest but spend an extra $10 so a total of $20 and get a decent pair of headphones with a Mic and no one will know the difference between yours and a $300 headset.
---
Re-read what he wrote....
---
I drop them in the suitcases at train stations
---
Sooo pretty
---
Well crap... that's where I live 
---
You‚Äôre right hiring a whole new studio in Dallas that specializes in multiplayer who did most of the work on this game prolly cost them very little money lmfao. Also, you‚Äôre getting fucked in the ass spending $15 on fucking in game skins when 3 years ago $15 would get you a full on single player DLC with its own location, story, characters and missions. You cannot name one paid game that has a micro transaction shop as bad as this one. The only reason games like fortnite can sell cosmetics for $10+ is because that game is F2P and there‚Äôs a reason Fortnite is having massive success and 76 is considered the biggest disappointment BGS has ever released. No company lowers the price of their AAA game within two months unless they‚Äôre having trouble profiting off of it. If this game wasn‚Äôt an installment in an iconic franchise it would be one of the worst games ever released and the only people who are still playing and actually will buy micro transactions are fallout fanboys like you. 
---
I want a turbo shotgun
---
There are only two versions, basic and tricentennial. Looks like both are on the Amazon UK page and the Prime page. Honestly i wouldnt worry about it going F2P. 
---
Thanks for the heads up. I just remembered i have hard bargain almost maxed. 
---
Look in misc there's a few things under that tab that weigh 1lb each, nuke keycards. Fuzzy tokens. High school candy etc.
---
Like in Skryim?
---
We aren't sleeping and living there though. If we started crashing on the lobby couches, it seems that robot staff would be programmed to deal with that. 
---
I talk that way too my best friends in real life.
---
Stop beeing a crybaby and accept that the internet and multiplayer games are a great place to be a toxic cunt.
---
Don't forget hornright estates the pool tables 25-55 plastic and the 20 or so packs and cartons 
---
Power attack is a different button kinda. Just dont long press power attack. Press on off. Power attack. Hooollllddddd. Grenade. I'm not sure what's the issue. 
---
You should have just stopped typing after the first sentence.
---
My camps been near flatwoods, then on the beach near the mistress of mysteries house forever. Finally moved under the bridge near thunder mountain. That got attacked all the time.  Finally settled for right above the cranberry bog. Never attacked , which is nice 
---
They should really turn hostile to any unauthorised construction in the area (camps)
---
that's not true. At least on pc.
---
&gt;The game is fun. But I just feel it‚Äôs too short
---
At the moment it is. Seeing as it's now a GaaS, they can't release all the content at once. That coupled with the beta version of the game they released, they are spending all their time fixing bugs before they can release new content. It will just take some time. 
---
If you open your pipboy and hit the POV button (pad on PS4) it gives you the PA pipboy display 
---
I'll try anything at this point. Before the last patch the game was very stable for me. Now the frame rate constantly bogs down to the point where i either stop moving all together or i just clip around uncontrollably.
---
Wonder how many I got. Her loot never shows up for me. Just sits there loading until her body vanishes or I DC.
---
Don't forget the +10 INT from mutations
---
Ok, I need to know how you guys keep killing yourselves because I find it super easy to distinguish between a press and a 1-2 second hold especially when the grenade ticks before being thrown.
---
on pc, it doesn't matter -- you throw a grenade anyway
---
I love how heal they are to craft. 
---
Two people came , I'm about to let him go as it's "hunting" season
---
What's that?
---
Do they show up on different fingers?
---
Your not the only one. Friend of mine that I run fallout with does the same but he will kneecap them ill tag them and walk away soon after we both get the exp.
---
11 from nov 17 to dec 2

Game is getting better
---
I live on a lake on the edge of the world down south
---
The exact same thing happened to me 4 days ago. I bought a new one off someone from the bazaar for 1.2k caps. If it happens again I‚Äôll be uninstalling the game I love. 
---
Oh yes that too. Good grief. I love the games but these key configs are kinda dumb.
---
I tried with rejuvenated as well yeah, and love the soups. 
---
Lol, I drop gears by the hundred, they‚Äôre common, not used all that much, and heavy.
---
&gt;Risk = reward.
---
No it doesn't. Not in this game. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry but what display cases in harpers ferry? I‚Äôve been looking for the wetsuit plans for a while. 
---
Fanboys like you a what create a hive mind. If this game didn‚Äôt have Fallout in the title it would‚Äôve sold less than 100,000 copies and no one would be playing it right now. Literally any success this game has is because it‚Äôs an installment in an iconic franchise. It would be regarded as one of the worst AAA releases of all time if wasnt titled Fallout. It‚Äôs already the biggest disappointment BGS has ever released and it‚Äôs only been out for like three months
---
Ahh that's what it is on console. 
---
Im starting a new toon just to level to 50first before i do any missions.  
---
Thank you. I was waiting for someone to prove my point. Talking to your friends that way is completely different and you know it. Anyway, a toxic person is a toxic person whether they choose to do it here or somewhere else. No good place to be toxic... Toxic is inherently bad.
---
There is a terminal in white springs that confirms this. 
---
It also mentions that they had to stop letting assaultrons give back massages.

I can confirm, it drops exactly where she died. Her body is enormous, so I couldn't tell you if it's where her head was, or her ass, but it's always there. I haven't missed out on a body since I learned that. I actually stop and get my bearings as soon as she dies now just to make the process easier. Me and my friends end up running back to find it for one person or another about 50% of the time.
---
If you want to be able to help find it, leave the heart and bones and stuff so it has a distinct loot list. Or leave your ultracite explosive vent.
---
Pet peeve right here.
---
By all means wipe the floor with them, I literally bring my 10mm sub just to get quick tags, but be considerate.
---
you're not on pc i guess
---
Hopefully Bethesda listen, this is amazing! If they just keep working on points from the community then this game will be what everyone hoped it would be!
---
Caps are easy to get if you know how. I can‚Äôt spend them fast enough and always have over 20k
---
Check gunpowder under misc
---
Sgtbaker20 and eastern standard time. Your on xbox right?
---
ya single star weapon/armor would be much easier to balance than the way it is now. the combination of legendary effects stacking makes players able to 'god mode' if they aquire the right super rare items from the dupers.  i doubt anyone has naturally looted a full set of assassin sentinal or unyielding sentinal armor yet, but i really dont like to speculate.  perhaps someone really has grinded that much.  im 112 and ive never seen a 'god roll' drop, not that i want to play the game that way.
---
It happens a lot, go in a rad suit, hit the ghouls once and wait for another high level to kill them, get the loot etc and go
---
I need over 25k and i never duped.
---
What console?
---
I think I still have mine and I don‚Äôt use it anymore. If I still have it, I‚Äôll just give it to you.
---
Still have if I want him
---
What is it
---
I think if you add a set of unyielding armor At low health it‚Äôs materially lower (plus charisma)
---
You seem kinda stuck on your personal playstyle and approach to this game. What doesn't make sense to you is being aware of your situation and the people around you, their needs and wants as characters? Good for you for DPSing the hell of the game and only knowing how to bring your A-game, and I hope one day you discover that there's more to Appalachia than putting your own needs before others. You can keep blaming Bethesda for your lack of adaptability, but you're still the one who can't put down your Kill Everything Button long enough to let other people play the game around you (it's good to learn to play in a healthy and social manner with others). I've put in over 180 levels into pacifists builds because I'm a good enough player not to have to kill everything and dominate the loot at high levels, and while it certainly is a numbers game after a while you may find that there are more numbers to play with than damage!
---
Could try and buy someone else's as well i guess.
---
I've seen level 50 all rises in the suitcases at train stations people have left for others for free etc
---
No no mods
---
Oh shit, Ps4
---
Assassin/Sentinel gear. PVP is in pre-alpha state, don't bother.
---
I love not having to equip throwables as my primary weapon, like in FO3, but I do miss the VATS cinematic of my character throwing a grenade. I don‚Äôt like the key having 2 different functions, though.
---
It confirms O.R. is Ragnarsdottir? Nice.
---
I have found a lot of plans for weapons, armor, PA... the problem is they don‚Äôt help if I can‚Äôt find the main plans. I have to find these items and then I can mod them, but not finding the items themselves is annoying. Also, I have yet to find any TSE weapons which is very annoying. I have heard level caps for being able to buy things but that is total BS to me. You should be rewarded for leveling, not punished!
---
everything under Misc tab shows 0.00 weight.
---
I have no Gun Power in my character inventory.

It was doubly-so before the last patch.

Basically 2x the ballistic damage + 2x the explosive aoe. This was absolutely terrifying with shotguns were the explosive aoe was applied to EACH pellet.

Stop fucking posting about F2P unless you have an official link to a Bethesda announcement.

Just crafted 6 for you.

It did that to me as well.  Just reloaded it and it worked fine.

Total game play hours?

Do you turn off or use rest mode?

I got my lvl 50 All Rise this way. Note that not all missions will give you lvl 50 gear (None of the Mistress of Mystery quests gave me lvl 50 items).
---
That me let him go
---
I kneecap everything, but you may just be taking this a little far. I mean some of those creatures look pretty damn pathetic afterwards. Don't be a monster, put them out of their misery proper. On the other hand it is kind of you to share those easy kills and XP.
---
Neat.
---
Like the Scorched BoS idea a lot and it makes a lot of sense in the narrative. Also perhaps add ‚Äúruined‚Äù versions of the armour as drops so it creates a new type of PA. So a ‚Äúruined T45 torso‚Äù has those green crystals fused in it and there are holes from battle damage and generally degraded like the other Scorched. Perhaps the crystals power the suit as they‚Äôre radioactive so no need for a core but the trade off is speed/damage resistance?
---
Could even have a Glowing Scorched BoS Boss that‚Äôs fused with the suit, larger than normal but swollen around the frame and pieces. 
---
The results he got from Monongah was a site to see, easily as good as Whitespring.
---
No Man's Sky sold a whole heap of shit, wasn't an iconic franchise, and is now regarded as a relatively good game. At least 76 is getting regular updates in that three months. Seems like people are angry they're not cutting losses and instead choosing to support the game. Come back when there's more content and see if your opinion changes
---
Had to repair my buddy's rifle just now. 
---
Seems his workbench is bugged. After repairing on mine, he deleted and made a new one. That fixed it. He's had the same one since beta. Probably the new update with the difference in repair requirements üôÑ

That's alot.

I killed her last night and there was about 8 ppl, 3 being sub level 30.
---
We finished it with 30 seconds left. I had tse and others were using explosive 50 cals and a bunch of nukes to burst her at the end.
---
it was pretty underwhelming to be honest, was more for flux than xp/legendaries from my only experience there.  hopefully its better for other people, but id rather keep nuking harpers ferry
---
Didn't they fix this when they implemented the "teams" it puts you in for events?
---
I seem to get loot from all event mobs even if I don't tag them
---
Happened to me this weeknd.  Scorch just landed and didnt move for 5mins without any damage taken.  
---
Then seems like the server caught up and she took off again flying and started to get take damage again.  
---
You kill lvl 1 scorched = 0 risk, little reward
---
You kill lvl 40 mole minor = more risk, decent junk
---
You kill lvl 65 glowing gutsy= bigger risk, possible legendary?
---
Are you saying the lvl 1 scorched and lvl 65 gutsy should/do drop the same lvl of rewards?
---
"Don't you think it the least bit daft to offer suggestions and advice after literally just one so-called griefing experience?"

---
Other games that have this feature end up with fan-made websites hosting the presets/etc, and the games I've played with this feature usually have beauty contests/ugly contests/celeb contests which are always fun.
---
Great idea imo.
---
It doesn't even make sense for a TSE player to be farming legendary gear at this event. If you have the most powerful legendary weapon in the game, it's mean to be used on the game's most powerful enemies (which are not at that event). 
---
People what you describe aren't even there to  farmi legendaries, IMO, they are just being dicks. 
---
This is a known bug. Let me find a source real quick.

My comment was in regards to a rumour, and this is the first time I posted about free to play.

If it goes free then hopefully more people will try it

There is no rumor, idiots like you posting this shit is whats starting the rumor.
---
Whats it matter what Amazon's stock levels for a product are? 
---
Just checked amazon uk whilst typing this and theres plenty of "vanilla" copys (not sure why you used the word vanilla - theres been no DLC).

So not only are you spreading false rumors, your lying about there being no copies on amazon :/

Most ppl talk trash like that on games and not in person because they know someone would knock there teeth out.üëçüèΩüòé

Definitely try the file integrity check. Other than that I think we're SOL until they release anther patch.
---
I've played dozens of MMOs, most didn't have something as obnoxious as ultracite ammo.

I‚Äôve been holding the the trigger for 70plus hours of gameplay wondering why my ‚Äúpower attacks‚Äù had no power.... wtf is wrong with me.

If you're on PC, you can install the Better Inventory mod and it will show you how much weight you have in each category. Helped me find my "phantom" weight in notes and misc tabs. Burnt books and magazines proved to be partial culprits.

I reach the 25k caps and now in buying everyday 2 or 3 plasma guns for scrap to get the challenge for those sweet Atoms
---
Thanks. Have those already for my regular rifle build, so I'm good to go there!
---
Looks like Trump finally got his border wall....
---
I'm sure that's a possibility, I've just run into a lot of guys who have bought 500 nukas for 200 caps and things like that.  Not saying you did that either.  I don't try to farm caps or trade or anything and I'm sitting at 10k caps just selling chems to the vendors.  So there is a real possibility of hitting the cap limit with completely legit gameplay.   But do you really NEED more than that?  The most expensive thing in the game is 12k caps for the neon letters plan.
---
Granted I think the cap limit is a bit silly, and I'm not sure why they set it so low.  It's an incrementing number, not an actual item that they seem to have database management issues with.
---
Its only for the hunting rifle
---
I have a hatchet that does +50% limb damage that is quite fun. But my preferred way is to snipe their legs with the bonus sneak damage added to it.
---
A fair warning. I did have a high level scorched hoard today...
---
I've noticed something similar since the last patch. The first time I log in after starting the client, my carry weight is what I expect, ~200/370. On subsequent logins (without restarting the client), my carry weight jumps to 400+/370 and isn't affected by removing/equipping weight reduction gear. 
---
The only thing that fixes it is restarting the client, which sucks when my CAMP doesn't load because I have to restart. This also happens when I switch chars without restarting the client.
---
It's a cool legend, but I can't imagine Bethesda touching anything that politically charged with a ten foot Mr. Handy buzz blade.
---
My game was pretty stable prior to the last patch (except server disconnects, etc) as well.  Now I frequently crash to desktop with no errors and no warning.  It seems to happen most frequently after connecting to a new server or around Watoga but it certainly happens in all areas.
---
I will try that one, I already dumped the points but haven't moved my special so might as well. I have Max str and per, to use melee and rifles. I feel now it was a bit of a mistake. It's nice to switch range and melee but it would be better to focus one and use the rest of the points for defense and crit boosts. 
---
Initially I had melee to offset ammo usage of auto. But after I got a instigating +40% pwr atk super sledge it's hard to get rid of it. It does stupid damage.
---
When you FT there, there is the building on the lower ground level with a hole in the wall. If you navigate into that building there will be several display cases, one of them (if someone hasn't already taken it) will be on the first and there is a another spawn on the second floor. You will have to use the train cars on the side to get up to the second floor, but it will also be in the display cases. 
---
I personally used to punch them with my hands, then get them to chase me so everyone just shoots it once.
---
God speed. Took me 3 days to find the inventory I wanted.
---
Wood is the best for stealth builds.  
---
No one has shown proof. Showing messages from friends isn't proof. 
---
IMO in persistantly online gamea there are always going to be crowded mobs, OSRS and WOW come to mind as good examples of certain mobs being killed too quickly in multi-combat areas. Great game design would address that though, so they're certainly slacking a little with the current tap system/balancing. I don't think it's entirely on them beyond a point, grinders gon grind. 
---
Scared the shit out me when a legendary deathclaw healed itself up and i thought i was being clever üòÇ

I have 4 kids, and I dont play violent games while they are awake.  When they are asleep, I can't get on the headset and be loud, or they will wake up.
---
So I am pretty limited in time that I can be online AND using a headset.  The emotes just dont cut it, and I would really enjoy having a hub within the game to chat and organize groups.
---
Come on Bethesda! Help an old gamer (that has bought almost every one of your games for a decade + ) get his game on!

Ditto. If people want to use Zero's bar at the Top of the World train station, they can take what they need from the farm and purifiers, use the instruments, take a nap, and take advantage of the basement workshop.

I do know the stuff on the Atom shop unlocks for all accounts. I unlocked some of the foundations when I was playing an alt, and later my main could use them.
---
I'm less sure about daily quests and if you get atoms from gameplay on them separately or not. I've never paid close attention.
---
Yes it is. I play on PC and I've accidentally threw a grenade maybe twice in over a hundred hours of gameplay, and I use a lot of power attacks. You just tap the button for a power attack, hold it for a grenade. You're not tapping fast enough.

It sounds like you're suggesting something that is already in game. Care to clarify?
---
\[PC\] Load in glitched
---
My camp is located on the edge of the water for my purifiers to create water. However when I log into game or sometime when I fast travel to my camp I will load onto the hill and the world will not be loaded in completely. This causes me to glitch into the ground and there is water under the map apparently because I will become irradiated to about half health before I can get myself out of the glitch. Can we make it that where we put our actual camp is where our fast travel/load in quadrants are actually located.
---
Morgantown High School has a shitload of golf balls as well. 
---
Same here. I'm old school single player at heart and kinda hate fallout went online multi, but it's growing on me. The terrible twenties we're the pits in this game, but get past that grind and it gets better.
---
That's what I thought. But it seems to be finicky at times. 
---
If you're starting fresh, as in, you start the game up from your desktop or home screen (depending on if you play on PC or console). Then you have to re equip the grenades. But from time to time, if you're server hopping or swapping characters after the game has accuracy been running. Then it will keep the grenades equipped. Though it'll un equip then from time to time. 
---
That's been my experience. 
---
Only for hunting rifle but it also works for the marksman rifle variant, they dont specify or show it so I was confused but it works for both.
---
Reeeeeally high. I'd say 250+.
---
And mostly rest mode. I do restart every once in awhile. Never turn it off.
---
I usually say "Ah! You cant walk? Well i can! Bye!" Then proceed to blast the in the face with a guass rifle. Or a generade...
---
I dont bother with them at all just get atoms as I play.

For what it is worth.  I sometimes agree with him, sometimes not.

True. I just hope it doesnt happen if I'm gathering plans from defending 3 or more workshops.

YESSS TO THIS POST!
---
What did he have this time around?
---
I started a second character, and didn't have a problem. Really frustrating since that's my main and I have a couple explosives that I legitimately earned.
---
If only you could wear hoods with the masks. Forest Scout armour with a green hood &amp; urban mask would be boss.
---
ah. Now we are getting to the real problem: The duplication glitches. Especially the bobbleheads.  They need to fix that. Since they are apparently not able to remove the dubbing. They should just disable stacking effects of the same magazines and bobbleheads.
---
But the TSEs are the reward for playing hundreds of hours. Rendering them useless breaks a lot of builds. Especially the heavy gun builds since even a two shot gatling was barely usable before. Now you can throw it away and the entire build that revolves around it.
---
I was kind of mixed on that stuff in FO4. Part of me likes it because it adds character, but part of me feel like it's an immersion breaker. xD
---
Glad you like the meeting idea, it was one of the stranger ones I had haha. It would probably just turn into a thing for people who want to socialize a bit.
---
What if Bethesda sell those items? :D
---
This was debunked a while ago I believe, in the same post where they debunked the trade stealing items thing
---
Yep. It‚Äôs really the only explanation for finding him repeatedly between worlds 
---
Completely unconfirmed, but it honestly makes sense. The game is not selling anywhere near what they want it to be. If it's not selling, they don't make money. Quickest fix? Free to play with more atom shop transactions.
---
Shouldn't they finish the current game first? 
---
this might be a good spot for this...

looking to buy explosive non-TS combat rifle with weight reduction.. XBox

Hit c or z if you‚Äôre on pc when selecting the perk and you flip through different stat perks.

Ohhhhh I know what you‚Äôre talking about! How reliably have you been able to get the plans for the helmet and the wetsuit doing this?

My group found this exactly. 
---
Lots of flux (140+ yellowcake), not bad hardened/glowing mass, but Zero legendary mobs spawned for us. Not a total waste, but not what we were hoping for.

You could on a new character. I think that was their point?

I honestly would love just a god damn text box in the bottom left corner Counter Strike style, disable it with a menu click if you wish
---
Carry a grognak axe. Cripple em. And execute.
---
I just scrapped and rebuilt haven‚Äôt had an issue yet but still absolutely ridiculous 
---
A feature like that may have the marked flooded with TSE or BE weapons. Would be good if you made it something like 15-20 of each flux and some other materials depending on what the item is, more expensive the more stars aswell.
---
I would say it would only be good after the dupers are removed so it doesn't have too many OP weapons.
---
Yes I know how to do that. How does that help?
---
It IS! Just got the challenge. Thank you.
---
Are you opening strength then scanning over to the cards you want? Because that's how you allocate points to a different stat then the stat card you pick.
---
Really similar here, it was on the ground for nearly the entire event but the server never caught up both times 
---
You still show on the map and compass and your name shows up when you stand.    
---
If you are going to make things up at least follow the game rules.
---
a quick search of Amazon's Australian distributors will tell you that regionally, supply levels differ.
---
the idea that a retailer that large is "out of stock" is strange, hence the speculation.  
---
Why you so mad about speculation bruh?
---
crappy. And it involves farming countless hours for ultracite. I removed the mod very very quickly. Useless
---
Almost nobody knows I have a couple TSE because I never use it unless in trouble or fighting the SBQ. Carry some other guns around that don't kill fast and you'll never run into this problem.
---
The Assaultron Helmet is pretty spiffy, it would look really cool with the Halloween skull mask under it
---
I am opening charisma then choosing a charisma perk, and the point is still allocated to strength. 
---
Why does this bother you so much?  does it effect your enjoyment of the game?
---
It‚Äôs not a bug.  It is a feature.  You select you SPECIAL point distribution then you select you Perk card.  You can select a Perk card outside the selected SPECIAL allocation of you desired. 
---
Any time I load in, I wait 15 seconds after everything is rendered to let the game catch up.  I started a new toon and left the vault so quick one time that the main quest line never registered, and the perk card pack disappeared.
---
It took me forever to get mine up, it looks connected but is piece work. https://imgur.com/N3Wwro5
---
The vendors in this game are like Gamestop when you try to sell them your old XBOX 360.
---
It was 500 or 800. I can't remember, but it was only available for 2 days. I hope it's still there for you.
---
LMAO @ anti-slavery being too "politically charged"
---
There is a group on FB that sets these up. You can gamble, buy, sell and trade while you're there. IIRC they have a fight club twice a week or something like that. 
---
It does scale to some extent. At your level most of the mobs would have probably been level 22 mole men, with the supervisors at level 30-40. 
---
That said, if someone at 40+ gets there before you it'll be nothing but level 40 mobs, so proceed with caution.
---
That's some pretty heafty sales tax.
---
HA yeah, I didn't even think of that. I was so frustrated last night when I saw the mission pop back up.  But it's a mission I HAVE to complete if I want to move on. Can't just skip it.  World Events you can do that, which I have done. But missions have to be completed before you can move on.
---
Pulling Scorch Beasts to their camp will level it without a bounty as well.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve never run into a situation like this and I forgot to mention that the queen stays on the ground nearly the entire time. No issues with other enemies either including other scortchbeasts 
---
Dude condition caps at 200%, use maxed fix it good on armor that needs repairing, and you are getting the same as someone with high intelligence
---
Again I'm not the one with the burdon of proof. 
---
Do bethesda plan on refunding the base game price ? It's not even 4 month old
---
Pay close attention at level up. You're clicking past something you shouldn't. It lets you pick a card that's different from the special point you chose.
---
By the time you're picking cards, you've already chosen which special point you're getting, and if you just clicked through without changing the selection, it's strength.
---
Unsure if this is the right fit, but 100% YES TO GHOSTS
---
image-mode photo blur or "orb" or some shit is perfect
---
I am choosing a charisma and choosing a charisma perk. I dont know why its going to strength? I cant use my charisma perk cards because I have 7 strength and the default 1 of all the others.

I‚Äôm picking charisma though, and then picking a charisma perk. But it still goes to strength. 
---
You selected Strength on the first screen then scrolled to Charisma perks and chose one of those cards.  
---
hopefully not true... but here is another - 
---
I did not do that. I‚Äôll try again next level up, but I‚Äôm fairly sure I have never picked strength at the start. 
---
Well, for one, it's against the sub rules?
---
I followed Nally, too, and that jerk led me right to a hoard of liberators.

I think they mean CAMP blueprints, but if you don't have the plans to build it (walls, tables, etc) it let's you know what you need

You understand that the rumors of F2p are all started and perpetuated by this sub, right?
---
Especially today.
---
I don't see why everyone loves the ammunition factory so much. It doesn't produce ammo quick enough to be worth the trouble in my experience. I held the ammo factory for an hour and got less ammo than I would have killing a mob of scorched in the Forrest. When I need ammo, I just hit a location that has lots of lead. Then I make my own. If they increased the output of the ammo factory so that it produced thousands of rounds an hour, then it would be worth taking. Right now it is worthless.
---
Also, when you log out, the things you built at a workshop are not destroyed. I know this because I got disconnected after building up a workshop, but was able to rejoin the same server through a friend, and when I got back, everything I had built was still there. I had to reclaim the workshop, but everything was sill there.
---
Handmade plans you get from random world containers or from vendors, speculation says you want to start looking after level 15 but before level 27.  
---
TSE is a random legendary roll, keep grinding legendaries, hope for a lucky drop.  
---
PA Plans are also random rewards/random vendor chance.  Ultracite plans you get from the queen, you can learn to craft the Excavator set from a questline.
---
MG 60 I do not know about.

You have to either buy alot of them or unlock them through quests and events i have been told

The drill is my go to

As it was just mentioned. They is how it works. You pick your stat then your card. 2 different things. 
---
Everything also maxes out at 15 but you stop gaining special points at lvl 50. Then you either choose a card or choose to move 1 point from 1 special stat to another. 
---
There are two steps to leveling up.
---
The first screen shows all seven S.P.E.C.I.A.L. categories. Selecting one of these categories assigns a point to that S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
---
Once a point is assigned, the next screen allows you to pick any perk card available to your level from any category.
---
When you pick a card the level up is finalized.
---
Once you hit 50, the level up screen takes you right to the cards since you can't assign points after 50.
---
Maybe that's my problem. I never restart. 
---
Actually I‚Äôm debating on an exposed tower, I don‚Äôt plan to fix anyone else‚Äôs gear or anything like that. Its meant more for me because I wanna see a few turrets wipe enemies off the map, I have a high character but melle gets boring when used all the time.
---
My goal is to set up a simple tower that I can repair or rebuild with minimal parts with one or two crafting stations and a stash that would benefit also by doing missile damage. The damage is key here. If I had an easily created turret tower without walls or crafting, that‚Äôs fine too. I want to see shit explode.
---
Hell no. Have the beak be dirty and have it *increase* chance and duration of disease. For direct mutation synergy.
---
Official Plaguewalker helmet. Yes.
---
Lol welcome to the internet, where the only place to hear things, is on the internet, from the internet 
---
Yes, you get variable amounts of nuclear waste as part of the reward. The more you can keep the extractors running, the higher that bar will climb, and you'll get more nuclear waste as part of the rewards. If you can go the entire event without letting them break you get more stims, caps, etc as well.
---
Yeah, I hate to burst your bubble, but logic and reason are not creditable sources. They're assumptions. 
---
All I was claiming was that there was an NPC human in Fallout 76 that is getting very little community interest compared to the other parts of the Dev areas found. Do you want me to post the varying youtube stubs and messages from Bethesda about it, or? I mean, just let me know, I'll gladly post it all here for you with links if you can't handle doing a youtube search of 'Dev room' and seeing the majority of them highlighting the loot boxes and not the NPC.
---
I am excited, I think it's a big deal to find anything new, but also a shame that players had to cheat their way in to find out said information. Just creates a vortex of confusion and assumptions.
---
It's definitely NOT for literally everything! Very misleading! In fact, it's for one thing, the hunting rifle (and variations, incl. sniper)  
---
I bought it HOPING for a PA camo, but im still happy that my sniper build now has a camo rifle.  
---
I think that going f2p would be a worse controversy than both the canvas bag and nuka dark rum combined.
---
You came to the right place to advertise your therapy: people are feaking out about these "free to play" rumors.
---
Same with trading and jumping.  Gets me at least once every time in Queen fights especially with marsupial.  I jump a lot.
---
How do you get the large letters used in the name of your house? I've only seen the tiny ones.
---
Yea, can‚Äôt wait for private servers and models to undo stupid pointless changes that just make the game less fun and less PvE community focused.  Both this and mama dolce‚Äôs were neat little pluses and neither was such a huge deal it was unbalanced.  The supply drop is literally anti-group friendly now which makes it even dumber than the Dolce‚Äôs change.  Why would friends and I ever go supply dropping now when we can only get our own and the rewards are meh as it is.
---
I'm not saying that you are the one who should come up with a proof. What I'm saying is, if you so want to make sure of something, the best way is to experience it yourself. And duping is what you should do. 
---
Yeah, I couldn't find anything definitive. This doesn't surprise me at all. 
---
Shhhhhh
---
I like the idea of no mic emote but I do not like the idea of a symbol to tell if you have a mic or not.
---
Sometimes I don't want to talk or can't due to the room around me being loud or my talking to someone on my end, I don't want to be betrayed by an icon when I'd rather stay quiet/muted.
---
PC, there‚Äôs a guy who‚Äôll make them for free if you provide the materials. He‚Äôs a crafting master. Let me see if I can find his list.
---
Missed the boat on that as I‚Äôm level 78... been farming Whitesprings but never get any TSE.
---
I'm a southpaw dammit. Left handed rights! Racial minorities get representation. The visually impaired get eyeglass representation. Hell the deformed get representation. 
---
But here we are, living in a right hand DOMINATED world.
---
Could developers BE more out of touch with the pulse of modern society?
---
Why do they need to give you a refund because of a rumor that is more than likely false?
---
I had 38 started the game and crashed after running 15 feet. So at 39 now. 
---
Mod's will handle that.   No need for such fury.  "Idiots" is a pretty harsh term for people looking for information from an information hub.
---
This is pretty funny, I thought everyone knew that was just an experiment
---
Ivory Grips galore! ^(/s)
---
I jump to Flatwoods whenever I get a bounty, let a fresh dweller kill me, it's a handful of free caps for em :) A lot of the time they think I'm trying to trick them lol
---
Don't people automatically join the same team temporarily while doing an event? This mechanic should also be used for tagging, IMHO
---
I mean if it actually go f2p
---
Lol welcome to the internet, where the only place to hear things, is on the internet, from the internet
---
EDIT: All reports are coming from Australia, where violent games tend to get heavy restrictions. Could possibly just be getting banned in Australia.??? Has anyone considered?
---
100k is nothing. I've traded with players with way more than that
---
I've never been hit by the bug before, but it is rather disturbing to hear that the exact same happens to others. Let's hope it will be a one-time-experience - I would hate it to be a recurring/reoccuring event.
---
Yeah trying to figure out which ones specifically. 
---
They also need to balance some of these weapons, lesser known ones like drill, chainsaw etc, cause they‚Äôre worthless as serious weapons, which makes having legendary versions pointless
---
Tried a few variations of that, can't find a valid account.  
---
Doubt it will go free to play, as long as they're making money in the atom store then it will roll as it has been.
---
Dunno how it could go f2p really, since when ESO went f2p it was a subscription based model and they simply added incentives to keep the subscription AND still charged $40-60.
---
Dumb fix with more atom shop transactions, since a skin would cost the same as an in-game cup of Slocum Joe
---
MAX condition, when the item is created...
---
Ok, look, I'll post screen shots.
---
Commented the following on a post the other day, and it‚Äôs still the case as of this morning. 
---
So if you look at my post history I had the same problem. I put in a ticket and spoke to support and Bethesda is blaming Sony. After speaking to Sony support, they pretty much laughed at the fact that Bethesda said it‚Äôs Sony and not their game.
---
So Bethesda passing the blame just tells me that they‚Äôre no where close to wanting to fix it.
---
But, are you wearing a power armor with targeting HUD by any chance?  I was and my buddy was and we were both experiencing the blue screens. For the last two days I put on my excavator armor (without a targeting HUD) and I have had zero blue screens.
---
I put on the X01 this morning with a targeting HUD - blue screened in 10 minutes; T60 with no targeting HUD - played just fine.
---
They do this in Elder Scrolls online as well.
---
feel free to add me GT: primerush
---
I'm  a filthy casual and usually solo player but i'm just coming up to the point where i'm about to give launching a nuke a shot so i wouldn't mind having some cohorts for that. 
---
I think your looking for the Brahmin pen. It is often rewarded for taking and defending workshops in the ash heap. 
---
If you are looking to make fertilizer for planting crops you can also collect 10 spoiled meats/Vegetables/Fruit and simply make fertilizer at the chemistry station. 
---
Sometimes a level 35-40 3* is better than the level 50 1* trash, so I still run it. The other day I got a level 35 War Axe with Instigating, +40% power attack damage, and +40% swing speed, which is perfect for my 2H melee character.
---
It one shots anything in the 60s or lower as long as I get to them while they're at full health, and will knock about 75% of the health bar off of a level 91 glowing deathclaw.

If this is your first Fallout game, be patient, there is a lot to learn.

---
If the pvp event of the fort had some sort of special reward, people would do it, nobody does it nowadays.
---
Maby a good ideavis assign unique weapons/plans/apparel to each event so people have a reason to farm those
---
Its a plan called "SIGNS AND LETTERS" or something. Every so often it appears at Watoga and costs an arm, a leg and your firstborn
---
"Its just....you know, I try.  I try and I try and I try.  I bring her everything I think she needs, try and protect her from the worst the world doles out.   I hide her from the worst of it, but theres just so much going on out there.  I come home after grinding through another day and all she says to me is "You know the budget's still MAXED!".  I just want us to have nice things, but she just won't grow with me.  I think I need to leave my CAMP doc...."

You can go to Harpers Ferry and buy it at the vendor. The name is "Brahmin Pen".

That is like asking if I should pay you money if I hit you with a car.  
---
could it happen? yes. is it likely to? not at all.  
---
It is a meaningless question at this point in time.  
---
They won't, there's a lot of rumors spread dunno if there's some troll discord or 4chin post or what but this is the third or fourth post about this today lol. There's definitely a push for this
---
Speed read the title, thought you were calling players sub-humans... Thought "Meh, harsh but probably fair"
---
Especially springs...screws vs. springs fight!
---
Also learn where to get mutfruit, corn, tatos and farm that vegetable starch to break down into adhesive ‚Äî more of an early game issue.  Pay attention to where military places/people are cause there are military ammo bag spawns around there which gets important ~lvl 20-25.
---
I have a theory that the server rejects your client's request to view the loot if you're too far away from the center of the body when it enters the range of your crosshairs.
---
So I try to look away until I reach the queen, so I'm right on top of her when it tries to display the loot. I've gotten loot the last few times, and I often used to get nothing. I don't know if that approach fixed it or if I've just been lucky a few times.
---
Weird, I don't think I've heard of this bug yet. Since I started a newish character I'll look out for it.
---
It‚Äôs actually just lazy design - the core drain is intended for power sprinting and jet packs.  The VATS is just a consequence of lazy coding.
---
Relax, it ain't going F2P and the rumor is based on EB games taking the STANDARD version (while keeping tricentennial, power armor on shelf) for a product recall.
---
Stop believing everything you read on the internet people
---
I believe I just installed that mod on my t60 which I threw on before heading to the nuke zone... Other than that, I'm usually non-PA so that might account for today
---
This is reddit trolling gone viral.

they're supposed to be super rare.

the duping market has raised drop expectations.
---
I'm 130 hours in and have seen 1 Explosive drop, no two shot.
---
Yes when it is crafted, it will give you more condition such as 200% vs 150%, but this 200% you crafted is no different than a piece of armor i repaired to get to 200% condition
---
You named the most hated dlc BGS has ever released lmfao that pretty much proves my argument. Whales ain‚Äôt paying this time tho I‚Äôm sure all the single player fans(80-90% of BGS core fans) enjoyed Red Dead 2 or Assassins Creed Odyssey over this hunk of outdated garbage. Todd Howard won‚Äôt even post a tweet any more that‚Äôs not a retweet from someone because of how much hate he gets in the replies. Everyone on here hating on me like I‚Äôm some BS hater but I pre-ordered 76 and played the whole Beta and wanted this game to succeed so bad. But I‚Äôm not going to defend a rushed cash grab piece of shit. Fallout 4 dumbed down the story and rpg elements but it was still a good game. Fallout 76 belongs in the garbage. It‚Äôs outdated they literally should cut their losses and focus on Starfield and ES6. No matter how much they patch this game the in game textures, animations, and performance is about a decade behind other big names developers. 
---
I had the same problem. Too many high levels were killing the legends before I could tag it. Come to find out they only drop lvl 40 legendary items. Once I hit 50-60 area I just quit doing it altogether. Wasnt worth it with all the higher players there. I did find a few other spots that spawn legends so I just hop around the map now.
---
Thats awesome.   I always check the artisan corner vendor for weapon.  He mostly has nothing, occasionally he has good stuff.   I lost my blade of bastet, was really enjoying it.
---
what is your build that made it so easy??
---
I think you're changing the perk filter to charisma after you've picked strength.
---
I'll just move her to Whitespring so she can get a taste of the real wasteland.
---
Cool. Try it out.
---
&gt;It doesn't even make sense for a TSE player to be farming legendary gear at this event.
---
People could be looking for better armor pieces to compliment their build, or farming lower level legendaries for alt characters. 
---
That said, they should put away the god damned boom sticks and use something that won't one shot the mobs. I like running that event with my suppressors buzz blade so I don't waste everything in one shot. 
---
No shit I named the worst dlc that just proves my point. Bethesda is a money hungry company who will release shit just to make money. The game isn't go f2p
---
Okay, I nearly starved my character to death doing it, but I got the conduit in. I put a long conduit on the floor with one end on the edge of the tile away from the wall I want to pass through. I make it as straight as possible on the floor, because any angle will propagate through the entire room. Then I put a junction on the end of the long conduit on the tile against the wall. Then I grab the through-wall conduit and snap it onto the junction. The ceramic post should be sticking through the wall on the other side.
---
I'd include a picture, but I'm still working with wooden walls and floors, and everything comes out brown. Speaking of wooden walls, you will probably have to adjust things with thicker walls.
---
Once I had the through-wall conduit in, I started connection junctions and conduit to the upper part, breaking the line with a junction and radiator every 1.5 tiles or so around the edges. I took out the conduit on the floor since it had served it's purpose.
---
Getting power to the second floor still involved wires, and replacing a floor tile with a half and quarter tile to make a hole. Not very pretty, but once I had a junction connected, it's all conduit up there too.
---
Yes, and I've found that the Sprint and attack uses less power core when in PA than a straight up PA.  You can Sprint from close distance and get the attack to with a little practice.
---
I was like you having "ZERO understanding" until I met a real duper. They are extremely organized and make $1000 per person min. This person I met plays many different games and sells for real life cash in many platforms. After meeting him I realized BGS stood no chance at fixing the in-game economy once attacked by the professional dupers. This doesn't excuse BGS putting out the game without proper testing, but it is now a reality we as the consumer have to live with.
---
Sometimes it's surprising what you can do though.  Especially with a little help.
---
They wouldn't give a refund; they'd give Atoms in compensation. 
---
I wish this would have been it but bro I've been sitting inside her an I've been 50 yards away. I've tired to be looking opposite directions. Ive tried wearing no armor almost everything.Nothing has worked. I've tried reinstalling/ repairing / different in game tactics I'm just lost. Wasting so much ammo etc on her for 300 exp an wood armor from the quest. Ty for trying to help!
---
That, um, doesn't look like a counseling office...
---
You can click on a card you already own to tier up that card
---
Are you on PC? Do you need the warehouse set? Maybe we can help each other. I also have a mole miner‚Äôs gauntlet if that interests you.
---
Bear with me here on this but you will make caps I guarantee it. 
---
Go to the fallout 76 marketplace make a post saying that you were selling all of your plans for 100 caps each.  Literally list every plan you have. I guarantee you pull in at least 1,000 to 2,000 caps if you have a large amount of plans.  I just had a guy by like seven or eight plans for me for his Alt just a few hours ago. 
---
I love wearing the fasnacht mask nearly all the time... Paired with the dirty clown costume is my preference.
---
I've posted linked images SHOWING that the max condition is different.
---
And hear the lamentation of the women.
---
I mean since they patched the carry weight exploit its inpossible since I can only carry one weapon and they die in one hit
---
I‚Äôm not sure I really understand why players are allowed to do any damage to CAMPs when the other player is not even there. Do wandering monsters also eat my generators when I‚Äôm on the other side of the map? And speaking of that‚Äîwouldn‚Äôt it save file space if my CAMP fell off the map when I‚Äôm not using it? 
---
Maybe a fair retributive punishment: if you destroy a CAMP while not in direct PvP, Bethesda deletes your own CAMP and all your stored items. 
---
It looks like one on the inside
---
No mans sky was extremely controversial and had very much negative backlash upon release. Regarded as a decent game now but it‚Äôs terrible launch killed any real success it could‚Äôve had. Not saying it was completely unsuccessful bc as you said it‚Äôs gotten much better but for the hype that it gained it came far from living up too expectations 
---
Only on ps4 sorry 
---
I usually request team with anyone that comes in, then you don't have to worry about it. It's pretty rare that an already made team shows up when I'm in, and it always surprises me when people turn down the team invite.
---
I just got my first nuke keycard and I'm getting stocked up for it myself. 
---
Not all TSE users are pains this way, but a lot are, I will give you that.  I do use a TSE in this event, but it is a TSE 10mm pistol, takes 2-3 shots to kill the normal mole miners in there.  It works great for tagging the legendary 1-2 times, then letting everyone else get in hits to finish it off.   It also lets me get a tag on it if I can't get a clear shot and can just hit the wall near it.
---
Now pulling out a TSE shotgun and stopping anyone else from getting any loot off of it is an entirely different story. 
---
FWIW, there's multiple stages with different timers. When it first appears there's a 15 minute countdown where someone needs to talk to the robot outside the mine. Stage 2 give you (I think) 7 minutes to get into the room and start the extractors. Stage 3 is 8 minutes of defending the extractors, with the legendary enemies showing up at roughly 6 minutes, 4 minutes, and 2 minutes remaining.
---
If you get to the robot and it says 3 minutes remaining you should still talk to him because it'll reset the timer for the next stage. 
---
&gt;[Don't be a monster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVke__4OZ-0)
---
Yep, it was the same doe me. It would happen when I opened the perk screen a lot, but it seemed to happen in nuke zones and randomly as well. Try the file check and let us know if it improves. 
---
The doctor is in...5 cents, please. 
---
Same it's always been for me:  
---
Legendary Gatling gun, anything with faster firing speed. Upgrade to speedy receiver, and take martial artist rank 3, with near maxed out heavy weapon perks.  
---
I don't need anything else.
---
Also if anyone does Guided Meditation in a group please don't just throw out grenades as soon as a wave spawns. Let people tag everyone first...
---
It‚Äôs started by just showing up outside Poseidon I believe.  Nothing special, just if you show up and the Event is ready it will happen. 
---
Just go near the power plant. If it doesn't pop up, that means it has been triggered somewhat recently, because they all have reset timers.
---
you go near that area it is in. usually before you even reach the workshop if you are running at it from charleston trainstation. if it can trigger it will. I think one of the first patches put a limit on how often events can be triggered on a server.
---
Were there enough components to craft the stable flux?
---
Yeah it killed potential success but as you say since Fallout is such an iconic franchise if they make the same level of updates as NMS then I think FO76 would be fine
---
I had one that constantly spawned high level deathclaws, nothing else haha
---
OMG I've never tried that
---
It's from a movie
---
You're right but how different does it work for consoles?
---
I mean...maybe a new character.
---
Having the limit prevents people from becoming whales. That lets normal players who work have a change it getting good gear without grinding for a endless amount of time. 
---
You can hit max caps in a little over two weeks and get just about anything you want. This is perfect. 
---
I like this game but i do not want to spend my entire life getting some stupid amount of caps just to get something cool. 
---
posted images to show that there is a MAX condition difference between different Int building.
---
Pfft.
---
&gt; I bought it HOPING for a PA camo
---
Um....there is a camo paint job identical to that for power armor in the store, has been since launch.
---
Which? The Two Shot Explosive combat rife? I was very lucky to get it. Fully modded with perk cards fully ranked up for rifleman, plus Tank Killer rank 3 and Demolition Expert rank 2, it does 400 damage. The max I want is rank 3 as I have rank 5 Gunsmith, I don't want to mend my rifles every visit to Whitesprings! I use it about 80% of the time in the outside, but inside, I'd kill myself all the time! I also have an instigating pipe rifle that does 160, so the first hit is 300 damage. I use that the rest of the time. If I'm sneaked, it does 800 damage, as opposed to my rifle at 1000, so not far off.
---
Edit: Said that completely wrong.
---
I'm in pc.
---
Yep, egg head and strange in numbers for the win, 
---
You can move your camp via your pipboy, costs caps though.
---
Workshops, while dangerous since they‚Äôre open PvP, can be a great way to get XP.  Same goes for events.  Also great for plans and misc meds (stimpaks etc).  I leveled to 50 heavily off just exploring doing stuff as I ran into it and a lot of workshop and event stuff.
---
I‚Äôd recommend tracking your plans/recipes because Bethesda STILL hasn‚Äôt added a function to show us if we own plans or not.
---
Until next patch be careful with mods, they will auto-scrap if you need the resources crafting.
---
I agree with what someone said about staying in the Forest a good long while.  It‚Äôs much safer and there‚Äôs a lot to do, I don‚Äôt think I left the Forest until early to mid 20s.
---
I‚Äôd honestly recommend not doing any major quest turn ins until 50 if you want to optimize earned legendary unique gear or look up what it is to see if you want the level 50 version.  If you know what weapon build you‚Äôre planning we could help with suggestions on what not to finish until 50.  
---
Example:  early-ish quest ending at the airport rewards a unique 45 revolver (think that‚Äôs what the somerset is if memory serves) so if you wanted to focus on pistol that‚Äôd be one to avoid.
---
Watoga mayor quest rewards a great two hand rocket sledge that most of us, even non melee focused, keep as a melee weapon.
---
Very few of these named legendaries can be leveled via in-game methods, and somehow Bethesda still hasn‚Äôt learned they should make these uniques auto-level
---
&gt; I booty danced backwards into his face, pooped out a grenade 
---
Is there a video of this?
---
With you as our leader, panickedsoul, we will ride through all the subreddits and we will eliminate every bad word! We will create censorships for any word that any human being may find offensive or harsh, and we will kill those who ever used a bad word! From this point on, no one shall ever again be allowed to use the letter F in any way since it represents the almighty leader of bad words. 
---
Haha, yeah.  I realized I was being snarky after I wrote it but it just comes across as silly so I thought it'd be fine.  I'm glad I didn't ruffle feathers.
---
Fuck I just spent like 2 hours running around this place 
---
Yeah, legendaries can go from helpless to outraged in an instant.

Ok I‚Äôll try

Pretty much this

Atom points are account locked. All your purchases can be crafted/used by alt characters. Challenges can be earned between characters (say you have 100 lockpicks challenge; you can earn it by picking 50 on your main and 50 on an alt), but once you've earned the atom points, the challenge cannot be done a second time, with the exception of Level challenges that earn Perk Cards instead of atoms.
---
Be cool if they did two, one for "good" players and another for those role-playing as raiders. The two could fight over control of Appalachia from bases on opposite corners of the map
---
Yep. Only had that problem a handful of times
---
Unfortunately I ran an experiment against just regular Scorchbeasts, missile turrets are \*not\* viable for this. You can't build enough to do much more than poke damage.  
---
Heavy Lasers are better, with spotlights, for this task, but even then they're not terribly great.
---
I only heard "Woosh" ... as the reference flew over my head.
---
You can do any of the power stations, though you can get wind turbine, large generator or fusion generator plan... so you may have to do it more than once... good luck..! üëç

That worked thanks
---
Pro tip: You can click on a card you already own to tier up that card.
---
Yeah, I have experience with game development, used to work in the testing segment and my logic and reason are pretty sound. Sure, they are still assumptions, but much more informed than your assumptions that it actually means something and is worth talking about. An NPC with any skin in a dev room means nothing aside from the fact the devs needed an NPC for testing. The skin itself is meaningless and was likely a joke among themselves. 
---
The mechanics for NPCs are already in the game as we see with Rose and Grahm, the skin they wear is really quite irrelevant. It tells nothing of the story that would be wrapped around adding human NPCs which would  be the real meat here if it existed. As I said, if there were a NPC with functionalities such as dialog trees that weren't in the game otherwise, it might have significance but in this case it really doesn't. When people saw that Wooby is identified as a test vendor in its reference name, they realized that there is little significance to the skin and so focused on the other things in the dev room that could be more revealing.
---
I'm not sure what you think there is in the videos that means anything. Bethesda has not made any specific statements about any of the items in the game room and most people are focusing on the items because they are far more indicative of content to come.
---
I think we are going to agree to disagree here, but it seems the vast majority of people are of the same opinion as me, otherwise they would be talking about Wooby, and they aren't.
---
I look forward to the new content and NPCs whether they be human or otherwise, but Wooby in and of himself is meaningless.
---
It's true, currently everything you built will still be there - on the server you built it on. But if you end up on a different server, all of that stuff is permanently gone. 
---
It is not an MMO.
---
Yes all explosive weapons are being nerfed due to crybabies. Melee nerfs will come next
---
Well nobody else was doing it, he was just the one to take initiative, and good on him for being the one to do it.
---
My camp was destroyed yesterday by someone with an absurdly powerful gun. I can‚Äôt say how many hours lost, kinda thinking about abandoning the game, which otherwise is really great.
---
I don‚Äôt see why this is allowed or possible or whatever.
---
Do you notice that it isn't a middle line difference on the images? but the entire box is different?
---
That is a difference in MAX condition, not just overheal.
---
The brick walls give me more issues than any other surface.
---
Yeah, I haven't been that lucky/unlucky.
---
Tormentor is as important as tank killer.  With an auto it will proc frequently, like enforcer does with shotgun.  Unload on a rushing enemy and watch them slow down as their limbs are crippled.
---
Np man hope it helps. 
---
done so!
---
For sure. I carry mine around for this reason alone. I'll occasionally pick up an extra copy of Grognak and the Ruby ruins for nice players I run into as well. 
---
Oh, I see you've described the person who designs all the UI for FO76 and FO4 to a t.
---
Even when I‚Äôm running solo when I see another player I‚Äôll never kill legendary one shot. Sharing is caring
---
You *can* upgrade those, though, to a higher level.
---
This.... And I flatten their camp....
---
We need a steal perk/option.
---
&gt;Do wandering monsters also eat my generators when I‚Äôm on the other side of the map?
---
Yes.  If a player goes near your camp and triggers a monster spawn in the area they can attack you CAMP.  You can return to your CAMP to find fences, generators, gardens, etc destroyed.  
---
Personally I'd prefer an in-game checklist, but I feel like that much less likely than a tag, which has a decent chance of being implemented.
---
See this is the problem here you have no proof of anything and are going to cry to big daddy bethesda? 
---
This is what wrong with this game. People cannot handle someone having a better setup than them. 
---
I have full sentinels armor and it took me 600 hours and 300 levels to find it all. Combined with fireproof. Dense mod, and dodgy I take zero damage from pvp
---
When looting the quest items, make sure you only loot the one with the "diamond" symbol next to it. THAT'S your quest item, not the 50+ other, identically named, items. Read each one. That should update the quest.  
---
And yes, if you're melee, make sure to wait until level 50 to get All Rise at max level.  
---
If your camp is on the west side of the map, can you scrap and put enough in your stash to fast travel from Watoga Station? Maybe craft some ammo at the Tinker's bench, use up some of your lead and steel, to make a bit of stash room?  
---
Crap, I see this was 8 hours ago, so my advice may be a bit late.
---
It'd be nice if camps auto-repaired over time (non-defenses at least), or could be repaired with caps, or repair required only common materials.
---
I've wanted a decontamination shower, but not if I need additional flux just to repair it. It took days just to find enough flux to upgrade my underarmor, and building a shower takes like 5x that.
---
Yeah...Bethesda better have their shit together by the time that game comes out or I'm never looking back.
---
^^I'll ^^probably ^^look ^^back
---
I think the game kinda deserves it. It was such poor effort on the developer's end. 
---
I hope it drives them to never do something like this again in the future. 
---
I was just thinking about this yesterday. I think if they changed the "Defend the ...." workshop events to always include at least one legendary enemy in the final wave it would encourage people to claim them more often. It would also give people who haven't claimed it a reason to go help the owner clear the event.
---
Exactly collect lots of plants and meat then let it spoil
---
Can't make it a trigger hold. It's also your gun bash, so automatics will be a bit funny if instead of spreading hot lead everywhere, you flailed your gun around, lol
---
not mad bruh, just telling the OP hes an idiot is all and that he was lying about UK amazon not having stock when they clearly do.
---
Why, wasup bruh?
---
Everything about the controls on the PC version is clunky.  From navigating menus to adding friends in the main menu.  The inventory interface is also horribly dated.  I said this at launch and it's still true.  It's like they never played the game on PC, only consoles.  
---
Or they‚Äôll do option 2, but we‚Äôll get private servers and mods and they‚Äôll let modders fix these kinds of issues, which is what I see happening.
---
I've posted images showing that isn't true.
---
Higher int gives you a higher max condition.
---
They can be repaired with caps - just move your camp and it's rebuilt fully.
---
I'm not going to say that its not frustrating to have this happen, but its a part of the game. I moved my camp way down into nowhere on a steel deposit to prevent this. Overall, if its not convienient, move into nowhere or just deal with it
---
The bounty should increase in proportion to the damage done, yes.  But, once someone hunts down and claims the bounty, all the repair materials should be delivered as a supply drop when you get back to your camp.  Also, make the bounty come out of the attackers own cap stash.
---
Move your camp and it's fully repaired.
---
lol snowflakes may not like it, but when you listen to rumour's and then spread those false rumour's and lye to make them seem more genuine idiot is generally the correct term :P
---
I just experienced this myself I‚Äôm there and two melee then comes in this lvl 98 twat who has explosive shotgun who then proceeds to 1 shot them before we can even try to hit
---
&gt; I lost my blade of bastet, was really enjoying it.
---
If you're on xbox you can have mine.
---
If your on PC, check out Nexus mods. Theirs one there. 
---
You can if you find a player like me who would buy them from you :) just go to where low level guys are and sell em!
---
Wait a sec. Do you mean if you have that card already equipped you can tier it up with another identical card? Because that's what I meant. Or are you saying you can somehow bypass picking any card and just rank up one you already have? I implied the former, but if you mean the latter, please explain how.
---
That sucks. I think I‚Äôve probably just been lucky or it‚Äôs my CAMP placement (usually on cliffsides). 
---
No idea, im 31 and still constantly switching weapons because of bullit shortage,  lead belly and cannibal did fix my food and drink issues so now i can finally focus on playing. Wich is very nice
---
Wetsuit has been far more common. I have found the helmet once or twice, but the suit about 4 times now. 
---
Just reading a lotta hate towards people asking about clarification on this.  Wondered why everyone was all up in arms.
---
and I mean, calling him an idiot seemed harsh.
---
but good luck fighting internet rumours.
---
I dont get what you mean by the entire box looks different, the two boxes on there look the same to me
---
But consoles have the ability to do "outside-game" chat.  If only Bethesda would do what Steam/Blizzard/other launcher-app-devs have done, and give access to your friends/recent players via the launcher.  That would appease me.
---
Yup I actually don't use any weapons during that event since the mole miners would die in one hit. I just tag them all with pain train and use the follow me emote when I see a legendary. I haven't actually had a problem at uranium fever yet, people are usually nice about it. I think most people realize if they one shot everything, everyone else will pull out their duped copy of the same weapon and one shot everything too. Then no one wins
---
Ps4 but thanks
---
With a full unyielding set, grape mentats, and rank 3 hard bargain, I paid 8750.
---
&gt; It‚Äôs actually just lazy design - the core drain is intended for power sprinting and jet packs. The VATS is just a consequence of lazy coding.
---
Or you know it could be working as intended. Not every feature that you dislike is just lazy coding.
---
But it was made for console and ported over. A lot of games are now designed for a console from the ground up rather than a PC. 
---
Enemies normally respawn in an area whenever a new player arrives.  So normally you team up with someone else who is there to farm whitespring, kill the ghouls in the golf club, then one of you disconnects and rejoins the team.  The server sees that as a new player joining and respawns the ghouls. 
---
Maaaaaaaan , I'd kill for that on console.
---
X01 you get from the Enclave and Excavator is also a quest
---
There's a cap limit?!  
---
I've managed to make it to level 90 and am still beyond broke.  I may have crested 3K caps at my richest.
---
Happened to me last night. Some level 138 was always at uranium fever with some ridiculously powerful gun that would kill the legendaries in a split second. I got one legendary and thats only because i stood on stuff and ignored anything that wasnt glowing which also made that event even less fun. If you are in the event with someone do some damage and let it be. You can always search all the bodies when it is over.
---
BGS giveth and BGS taketh away.
---
Chuck Pahlaniuk is a great writer.  
---
And false rumour is a misnomer.  It's either false or speculation that was proven to be false, making it a rumour.  Neither of these things has happened.  
---
And speculation doesn't make someone an idiot.  
---
Ok, you're a troll. All I said was remember the human 
---
That's one of the main problems with it being online. Can't let the community mod it in like they always have with Bethesda games. Well you can, but you risk a ban.
---
yes camp blueprints
---
As a note: Avoid joining groups for people you don't know or aren't around them, aka random invites. A thing lately is for them to fast travel to your base and destroy (regardless if you are there or not). Some people were using it as a means of a free fast travel if you were in an area they wanted, now since people are getting bored waiting for new content, they have resorted to raiders &amp; destroy.
---
&gt;In the video its explained that you must go to Monongah first, and make sure the enemies in that area are either ghouls or scorched, otherwise you won't the large mobs of BGO's like in white springs.
---
Even if you do this, isn't there the possibility that someone could kill them while you're clearing the silo, and they could respawn as something else, or do the spawns stay the same for a period of time on a particular server?
---
flick between them, put them in two tabs, and siwtch back and forth, and see the box size....
---
gamers rise up
---
I think world items, including safes and other locked containers, never respawned when server hopping. Only mobs do, and sometimes triggered events too.
---
I saw the Murlock Rouge and was hoping for a tie in to Moulin Rouge :)
---
Great work!  
---
Cheater.  Bethesda meant for you to spend real money on Atoms by this point.  
---
/s
---
I think if you enter the pip boy menu and release the button it doesn't release the grenade. 
---
I think...
---
My camp is right next to this house.  Every time I log into the game, I go take that ring.  Sells for some pretty decent caps.  
---
I am not a monster, though.  I always keep one and wear it.  There'll eventually be the day where my wife notices that my character wears a wedding ring.
---
And then you will start introducing pay to win weapons :/ 
---
Do you mean the 'scan and repair' option in the game options of the Beth Net launcher? :)
---
Except for Mistress of Mystery items; Voice of Set, Blade of Bastet, etc.
---
Just call it as I see it - given the number of bugs and stupid stuff like broken explosive weapons I‚Äôd put money down that this was not intended.
---
You totally could have gone. I've done it solo at that level (mind you, I ran the fuck out of there when I got overrun, but I still got a lot of loot so it was worth it!)
---
Just run in and shoot what you can, making sure pacifist mode is on so you don't accidentally shoot the other players. Loot what you can, run when you have to, and have fun :)
---
Yes, that's it. It seems to have helped. 
---
I go inside the club house, there's usually a fair amount of golf balls in the display cases right in front.
---
Did you check the enemies there first? You got to make sure it's ghouls or scorched, otherwise you don't get mobs.
---
I just lost my x-01 jetpack mod because the game decided to use it as available crafting material. i'm fucking pissed jfc.
---
I bet your buddy didnt even drop the nuke. So that makes him the asshole. Someone else went through the silo and are having alll their kills stolen by a leech. This is why the community has a problem with it, because 9 times out of 10 the base owners are not even the ones who dropped the nuke. Zero effort. Lazy people, i destroy all bases behind club.
---
Definitely not fix, has been glitched the past three times I've gone to it, that was yesterday.  Enemies do spawn but they do not go towards the island, they just sit at their spawn point, and wcwn if you circle the whole lake clearing them, than sitting on the island until time expires it still counts as failed....
---
lol 
---
these sort of posts should be banned, no one cares your base was destroyed, they really don't.
---
Still the Chuck Norris under the Animals XD
---
I'm pretty sure I've had crops that were still broken when I moved. Scrapping them refunded the full cost though so I could replant cost-free.
---
Right?!
---
Or fix the bug that causes sound to get super choppy once a mic is turned on, so I can actually use it.
---
the ma perk is for melee weapons only. 
---
Yes, yes we do.
---
Just move your camp everything will be rebuild cost material free 
---
I thought Fallout is not good for married couples, because it is only disconnecting people.
---
Actual lol, dying over here
---
Yeah.
---
Well, now that they "fixed" the fusion core generators and bumped them back up to 8/hr, taking a power plant is the most reliable way to get them. Plus they're guaranteed to be 100% full.
---
That's the thing. This isn't *only* my playstyle. If it were, we wouldn't need PSA threads such as this one. It's *everybody's* playstyle. Because that's how things normally progress in vast majority of games. This specific game's design is counterintutive, which is why the problems occur. Legendary mobs don't feel legendary to fight, 1-shot builds are ubiquitous, and the "tap" mechanic without soft-grouping to back it up is outdated. And again, if Bethesda did *literally their job* my alleged lack of adaptability wouldn't be an issue. I wouldn't need to adapt to anything, because the game would be well enough designed to function with more than one playstyle. 
---
Sometimes I Don't even hold Alt and it throws a grenade.
---
This is amazing! I wish my camp looked like this!
---
Highlight it in the list while equipping perks and press...square, I think, on PS4. (The correct button is displayed along the bottom of the screen.)
---
My favorite thing about that is I can solo Monongah pretty easily, 100% that shit and you can run every resource machine at the ammo plant off of the box alone. Super handy.
---
Grab the ammo plant, plop down one large generator and  connect that and the box to the  ammo generator, go power up Monongah, store/scrap the generator and build the rest with some extra Ammo in your pocket. Job done
---
Sorry to hear that. I read that the exact bug will be fixed in the next update.
---
Fort Defiance
---
Rad suite mostly, there is also a no rad glitch.
---
Just to be sure: if I have pacifist mode on even my grenades/molotovs won't hurt other players, right? Because I want to throw those in the middle of these giant molemobs but didn't for fear it would damage someone else on accident.
---
They do!
---
If there is someone else there, always show up to any event. Low level characters might need to be more strategic in various events, and be less of damage dealers, but most players are happy to help you out.
---
I'd rather console players have the *option* to utilize text chat, even if text input with a controller is slow, than no chat option at all.
---
For PC users and console users adept enough to plug a keyboard in to their consoles it would be a very useful function.
---
Yes. And while we're at it can we say how workshop mode and the extend 3rd person view is the same problem??
---
FOV and DOF settings can be changed in game, why mess with the .ini for that?
---
Save game does nothing, leftovers from previous titles
---
Dude I‚Äôm looking for automatron, wastelad, zeta invaders,red menace if u can help or if I can buy off anyone‚Äôs I‚Äôll pay 1k caps per holotape I want 
---
rad suite cancels unyielding, so it's not really an option in my understanding
---
You get drills and flare guns?!  Lucky! I'll I ever get is the finger.
---
Vats related question not about PA : why do i keep missing the first shot with 95% accuracy promised? I do wait long enough otherwise it just says 0%.
---
I used to work tech support as well. We didn‚Äôt get to close our tickets as resolved when the user problem is still active. One exception was a global issue filed in a master ticket.
---
speaking of which, I'm trying to acquire 10 radscorpion stingers for the syringer mod.
---
2 Handed or One?
---
And there is even more dumbness if you don't use a QWERTY keyboard. 
---
Z and C are used for VATS previous/next target and workshop previous/next category while A and D are used for lockpicking clockwise/counter-clockwise. Guess what, those are hardcoded values! It's always A Z D instead of &lt;move left&gt; &lt;move forward&gt; &lt;move right&gt;.  
---
If you use an AZERTY keyboard, you cannot move while in VATS or in workshop menu and you can only lockpick one way...
---
Idk for sure, but i believe its dependant on the server. Unless the youtuber just got lucky. Not super confident in how the servers operate, kinda waiting for someone to tell me they checked first and still got molemen.
---
Two-Shot modifier doesn't drop anymore according to the last update. 
---
THIS!!! I don't wanna join a team of rand-o's.
---
Step 1 Get Vault suits
---
Step 2: Share presets with 3 friends
---
Step 3: All 4 team members equip same preset and Vault Suits
---
Step 4: Creep out the entire server by yelling 'Gary!' at everyone
---
That is the world we've become.... One without consequences for being disrespectful while hiding behind a digital mask ... Sadly
---
It would have to be a halloween costume then, for it to be lore friendly
---
i think i've got about 150 hours into it, around level 58 and have played entirely solo, and i have enjoyed the hell out of it. I am just about to do the last quest then i will probably spend some time farming mats to upgrade my gear then spend time exploring. I have only been to around 50% of the map locations and only done a handful of events. 
---
I have definitely gotten my money's worth out of this game. 
---
I am doing the scan and repair right now :) Will hop back on later after food etc and give the low down on if it helped - fingers crossed amigo :) and thanks for the info as  well - appreciated! :)
---
Pretty sure all generator stations have a chance to have this event.
---
it's all about your grade of patience.
---
The game is ok, fun and playable, when everything works fine, but too many times something "bad" happens and it breaks the fun/immersion.
---
Server disconnections, events inconsistencies, all kinds of bugs, T-posers everywhere‚Ä¶
---
They admitted they are fixing +150 bugs/week‚Ä¶ so imagine...
---
Also, I think you can tab out of a grenade throw?  Good story tho!  Glad stuff like this is out there.
---
Wow that's messed up. I'd rather them fix that bigger issue than fix the issue of having multiple different things mapped to the same key... That's pretty ridiculous.
---
I hope it works! Looking forward to your update. 
---
As a bloodied build I only see two options. PA or rad suit. Unfortunately they both take away unyielding, and I haven‚Äôt seen anyone without one of those in nuke zone 
---
Hi there guys...my tamed creature was stacked at my C.A.M.P. budget after my asshole friend blow up her head üòÅüòÅüòÅ...can I erase it of the inventory???
---
I cant find the way...
---
Nope just what they do with that speculation and whether they believe it over the facts, the facts are as it stands today the game isn't going free 2 play.
---
The only place this "rumour" or "speculation" came from is that guys you tube channel....the one that had most of his hits whilst slating and bashing Bethesda and Fallout, before that I'd never heard of him or seen any of his content on you tube before. 
---
He clearly isn't as stupid as he looks as hes worked out he can ride the hate wave to more clicks and views hasn't he, i mean this whole thing started because apparently 2 people from Australia seen something about it in some EB store in OZ.
---
He never offered any proof and / or checked any facts (I'm sure he'd still be waiting on Beth getting back to him), he just made a video and slapped it up on you tube for the clicks / views.
---
His videos are shyte as well hes one titchy looking mofo, always seems nervous in front of his cam from what i can tell by watching a couple of his vids.
---
Heated Coil Super Sledge, in terms of raw damage it cant be beat. (by other melee weapons)
---
Shiggles... I like it! ü§£ Can't believe I've never heard that before.
---
You are right, but this is a FO76 sub and it would be a boring place if it only had "Beth Fix Your Game" posts in it. And there already is plenty of those. 
---
Let's talk about everything and keep those "Beth Fix Your Game" posts still in this sub.
---
Ah,  it's pretty good and possibly even better than a Rifleman build if you don't plan on sniping a lot.  Bonus for being able to down charging enemies quickly. Just learn to single tap and burst fire to save ammo when possible. 
---
I don't mind low level characters tagging and running. It helps them level up so they too can enjoy the endgame. We were all level 25 and terrified of mole miners (or the scorchbeast queen) once.
---
Not how it's supposed to be, but how it IS.
---
The one in the production area? I think that's the way it's supposed to be, because I only ever see the same 3 plans from him as well.
---
I'd still say "All Rise" as two handed weapons in general do more damage and benefit from the martial artist and incisor perks making them extremely effective against just about anything. With high strength, the two aformentioned perks, PA, drugs, and slugger perks, everything just becomes easy. All Rise has (i think?) the best "guranteed" stats in the game and is just a workhorse
---
I understand that it‚Äôs not an end all tower, if Bethesda wanted towers to kill everything, I‚Äôm sure they would have made it that way. This is kind of an extension to my own character doing heavy weapon damage. Think of it like torbjorn in
---
why?
---
Heavy guns break fast, they need repair often.
---
Heavy Guns need ammo, a crafting station could help.
---
Heavy Guns weigh a lot, a stash could help.
---
It would be cool to have a pet turret tower.
---
Oh wow, I just topped 20K, I didn't even know there was a cap... guess I need to spend more
---
I don‚Äôt get it, why is it that special? Serious question. I‚Äôm sitting on my launch nuke quest waiting for a buddy, got one in a random server as a small group had already nuked prime. 
---
Ok I see it does sweet damage, pretty cool it weighs as much as a sack of feathers, but are you stacking cards or something? PA or not I‚Äôve fallen in love with the furious combat knife due to its very fast attack and momentum gained with every hit. 
---
How are you making All Rise all that so to speak? 
---
I‚Äôd ultimately rather use my vampiric mole miners gauntlet but can‚Äôt in PA (wtf Bethesda, I can hack a computer, pick a lock but can‚Äôt use a power fist in PA when I mean honestly, a power fist really seems like something PA should just come with) for some reason. 
---
In all honesty I really haven‚Äôt looked at my cards and thought of a potential build but I‚Äôm curious. 
---
And right on to the dudes that helped you out. 
---
God bless him? Lol. It‚Äôs literally his job. 
---
No doubt the devs are feeling snowed under, but everyone who‚Äôs making a suggestion paid money for half a game. That more than entitles them to a say in what‚Äôs wrong and what they‚Äôd like to see improve. The reason so many of these suggestions are piling up is because patches are being released so slowly; one a fortnight? For a game in this state? It‚Äôs ridiculous. 
---
Now I know moderators do a tough job for little credit, but the ones on this sub do need to step it up. As has been said, all this stuff needs to be gathered into one or two big sticky threads, but it‚Äôs like they‚Äôve seen the never ending deluge and given up. 
---
i recently had to throw away over 100 black titanium scraps, you get a lot of them from the event Breach and Clear i think... bonus materials if you have the hornwright keycard
---
Actually jetpaks use AP.
---
Sprinting uses AP.
---
Jumping uses AP.
---
Its cut and dry.
---
Power attacks will drain your core fast too
---
Move your C.A.M.P device around within your settlement to change your spawn point. There doesn't appear to be a real rhyme or reason why it effects your spawn location, but it does. 
---
That‚Äôs amazing, yea, I always used the overseers rifle in FO4, and a TSE version would be amazing since I have so many rifleman perks
---
Yea, the server completely crashed.  No option to get back at all.  Sigh
---
Harpers Ferry is one of, if not the, most Haunted town in the USA.
---
Ive seen a few when I was there.
---
&gt; Just call it as I see it
---
Didn't mean to say you can't be right either. I just think I remember seeing a loading screen hint about PA and VATS regarding core drainage. I just can't remember if it was in fo4, 76 or just in my imagination.
---
My guess is that in fo4 it was meant to not make PA more broken than it already was because back then VATS would slow down time. In that case I agree that its unneeded in 76 but I can see what they were thinking when coding it like that again.
---
Think of them as raiders. It will enrich your rp experience.
---
Adding commando to rifleman helped my SBQ game a lot; they complement each other well.  I moved points from Luck to Perception and use Tormentor more than crits.  With auto rifles it procs all the time and helps ground the queen and keep her there, and works great on the trash mobs. You can switch to the Dragon with crits when in the clear.  
---
And it's each \*bullet\*? So auto fire weapons plus Enforcer perk are the way to do this?   
---
I was playing fine by myself from lvl 1 through about 26, and the past 2 levels (28), I've had a HELL of a time with really fast, tough melee bosses like the Wendingo cave. 
---
I like the idea of this. Bethesda will never add this because it would make the game less grinding.
---
Inferring the 2 shot handmade is the best rifle is a long shot. There really isn‚Äôt a single best weapon in the game. While the handmade is very strong overall, it can‚Äôt one shot a lot of different tanks ontop of requiring a rather rare ammo type. 
---
I think the weapon type used should be based on the enemy you are fighting, so for most normal troops I‚Äôd say something with high attack speed like the sacrificial blade would be super solid, but for high health targets the supersledge is hard to beat.
---
Not all of them no. I would guess maybe 60-70% though.
---
So ya, not terrible. But the lack of legendries was a disappointment for sure. 
---
&gt; You seem kinda stuck on your personal playstyle and approach to this game.
---
I think what s/he's saying is that we can't expect every player to realize that it's selfish in the first place. Not everyone playing the game is on reddit or browsing forums or using a mic to even know that it's bad. They may even get yelled at and be like "Wtf did I do why is this guy an asshole?"
---
That's why you can't rely on players. Not only because some are gonna be assholes regardless, but because a lot are not even going to realize what they're doing is hurting those around them. 
---
Now with loading screens!
---
I believe through the story you learn to craft Rad Shield which stacks with diluted Rad-X and won‚Äôt suppress mutations (not a mutation user so I can‚Äôt say for sure).
---
Especially when you try and play VR. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I dropped a molotov on myself before I quit.
---
I agree. I personally carry a TSE Gauss but whenever I'm in an event or even helping a lower level player I quickly switch over to my Quad Handmade out of common courtesy. Unfortunately this game is peppered with douchebags.
---
You are correct
---
Something like this happened to me with my favorite anti-armor / crit dmg single action revolver.  (Gunslinger build). 
---
It turns out when I looted something I actually dropped it.  I ran around to everywhere I was and found it in the ground near a dead robot.
---
We need something like the mod from FO4 where you can lock weapons and armor from being scrapped or dropped.
---
I known...that right, now Im waiting Mr. Todd to come home to spank me. Ive been a bad boy
---
Obviously the point of this post went way over your head.
---
There is not. It‚Äôs not that exciting, really. I just teabagged backwards into his face and threw the grenade straight down. Tbh I try not to record video evidence of my sexually harassing super mutants.
---
11 across 2 psn accounts totalling 4 characters
---
This is true, but it's no feeble task to determine how much is too much before you begin a project. And I know firsthand how easy it is for things to either slip by unnoticed or just get decided to be let through due to time constraints.

But I'd rather be part of a team that always bites more than they can chew and chases after interesting and new ideas, rather than one that remains complacent. F76 is an interesting and really ambitious game, specially from BGS usual RPG fare. It's also not a core game in the series, so it might not have gotten all the attention that it demanded.
---
These are things to consider, and overall I'd rank F76 as a success. They proved that it can be done, and it's a fun and enjoyable experience. It has bugs that hold it back from being truly great and it lacks some end game content, but the road there was hours of fun. 
---
And he is dead...sorry.
---
I agree. Can only raid an area once for loot, but can farm the enemies an unlimited times. 
---
Could not agree more , crybabies üòÅ like in every online game these crybabies get the their will üòû
---
I still find many reasons to play.  The lady and I play with a various group of online individuals.  It's still fun to pal around and find new things, explorer new areas, drop nukes, etc.  Patches coming out continue to level the game and add to the experience.  Hope you come back soon.  Always need more players.  üòä
---
That's exactly what I needed to know. Thanks  üëç
---
Oh. Mine is inside my camp, and has been. And every time, I still spawn in falling out of the sky. 
---
It does work, but it depends on your intent.
---
Ultimately, the only thing that matters if your wallet-vote. You can bitch and moan as much as you like about any game, but if you pay, that's the *only* thing that matters. Developers and publishers don't care if you're happy or not. They care if you pay or not. Happy people tend to pay more, so most developers will try to make their player base happy, but the ultimate metric is still money. 
---
So, when a game is poorly made, but you still pay for it because you don't want to deny yourself playing it for one feature (it's never just ONE feature, but regardless), that's the only thing they see. It's a "Yes" vote from your wallet. Ergo, what they are doing is correct, and you support it. You can verbally say you don't, but your wallet-vote says "Yes", and nothing you say matters. So future games will continue to perpetrate the same nonsense, over and over, because you keep saying "Yes, yes, yes, oh god yes!"
---
Now, what I am suggesting is, if you wish to effect positive change and force innovation, you have to, from time to time, not be selfish and think of purely your own self-gratification, and sometimes vote "No". That "No" may be against for personal interests, but if it will force overall improvement in the product, for everybody, then it's worth it. And I'm not saying "Never buy it, ever." By all means, do get it, but maybe 6-12 months down the line. 
---
You do have to be careful with this stuff, because you can go too far, I admit that. For example, what happened with Star Wars fans. Things got too toxic. You can't please everyone. So it's a numbers game - if enough people feel strongly enough to vote "No", it tells the developers something. 
---
Bottom line, it depends on what you want. Do you want self-gratification, and nothing else is a concern? Then do what makes you happy. But if you want to see improvement and innovation, you can't throw money around on inferior products out of brand loyalty or habit, you have to be selective. And none of this means absolute self-denial, just delayed gratification. 
---
&gt; It's like they never played the game
---
FTFY
---
You should still be able to one shot ghouls w/o unyielding. Queen you just nuke on the edge and bait her out of the blast zone.
---
Well enforcer is just for shotguns and there is another one for rifles. Not sure if full auto guns have a cripple perk. 
---
Walking or Fast Travel?
---
The amount of times I throw a grenade at a scorch beast queen when I am trying to get some good swings in is crazy. I wish it was an option...
---
Same way you currently use your pip-boy while wearing a deathclaw gauntlet.
---
Loot, exit the server, do something for two or three minutes and try again. I do 30-ish minute runs collecting stuff, go back to camp and scrap it then leave server, go for a smoke or a coffee and jump back in, then repeat.
---
&gt;cKerensky
---
Incorrect, sir. Martial Artist increases the winding speed of the Gatling Gun.   
---
Whether it's a bug or not is secondary to this fact: Martial Artist speeds up the firing speed of the Gatling Gun.
---
I see a claimed workbench by vault 76. I see the player (workshop owner) is way over in the great divide. 
---
I tag his workbench. Instead of staying, to claim the workbench, i fast travel to the mire where the play was a moment ago (His dot drops from my map once i tag his workshop)
---
Now im running through the mire, i see him, I one shot him. 
---
Player "I WaS OnE ShOtTed WiTh SlAp DaMaGe"
---
I never took his bench but i sure got all his junk!
---
Oh damn, your right. üôÑ I forgot because I never gun bash. 
---
Well I mean, all the claims of unavailability in Australia are true as far as I can tell.
---
Not on EB websites, 2 copies currently available on Amazon.   
---
I don't know why that is, but I know you can't get the game.   
---
I wont even provide examples that might be claimed fake, just go look for yourself.   
---
I don't care about the youtuber at all, I didnt watch his video, I did my own back checks.
---
But shitting on people asking about this amounts to gatekeeping in my books.   
---
They should change how we get loot in events like that one or make those mobs harder to kill.
---
Okay, thanks. I'll swap it out and try another wall.
---
Agreed, but if you homies ain't paying attention, well that's on you, I'm not gonna stand there and get hit or do three laps around the place while you're in the corner.
---
Dang, an hour huh? What a pain.
---
Exactly, but some might make the argument that in order to be realistic they're meant to be weak, leaving them as just the fun alternative
---
Bloodied with few pieces of Unyielding armors.
---
The punishment (if you can call it that as there shouldn't be one) for attacking your base is that you have the option to go and kill the person and take there junk.
---
Yeah ok games buggy so if there exploiting you cant do that, if Bethesda ever fix that (which they should do before doing anything else) then the "punishment" if you like is already in place.
---
I didnt even think to try that yesterday, just ate the cost of repairs after a server hop.   
---
Got it. Is the rifle cripple perk also in Agility? Most shotgun perks were in STR I thought... 
---
Welcome to Fallout 4, my friend.
---
They‚Äôd make more money if it did go F2P. No one gonna but with the shit reputation it has. They‚Äôre gonna go F2P to sell as many micro transactions as they can
---
The gauntlet would be more than enough 
---
I'm on PS4 and would sell mine for 1k if you are interested
---
Since the latest patch the game has been way more unstable. Crashes and loading screens are the flavors I savor right now. :(
---
Some loot does respawn when server hopping but it is sporadic and probably more of a glitch than anything else. Just like when server hopping vendors will sometimes have more caps again. 
---
Both of those are supposed to be on a timer tied to your specific character and not the server you are on, so when loot or vendor caps do reload prematurely it is a nice surprise but shouldn't be an expectation. 
---
Source: Still trying to get those darned excavator calibrated shocks.
---
Love the new creature ideas. 
---
Hey I'm not saying the gun isn't fun... But the game is a complete failure from a technical point of view. It's a disaster.
---
calling someone an idiot for believing mindless speculation and spreading it further is shitting on them...ok 
---
&gt; In theory, getting a 3* TSE Handmade has a chance of 1:2,000,000 or so.
---
Love this little tidbit. Odds of any specific weapon dropping are this. If you specifically want a certain weapon + affix combo that isn't top tier it probably hasn't even dropped and even if it has the person who looted it probably just vendored it.
---
I accidentally sold mine.  It was one of those "inventory jumps around while selling" things, and I didn't notice until I'd logged out.  Saw the thing I wanted to sell still in my inventory and realized.
---
So pissed off about it.
---
Go to /r/fo76bazaar and post the following thread:
---
[PS4] W: Level 50 All Rise H: caps, ammo (insert whatever you have to offer here)
---
You'll find one in a matter of minutes.
---
thats been and will always be the case in any videogame with trading and it being an mmo. If you are surprised then you havent really been gaming or playing any games in this genre because its been happening in games for the last 15 years at least if not 20 whether it is for items, carries, full team runs, farming, or just power leveling a character. Money has always been able to buy and outdo handwork, delusional people have just never been aware. Hell even casual games like destiny and fortnite(stw) had and to and extent still have this. 
---
It‚Äôs too late their textures, AI intelligence and character animations are already a decade behind other big names developers lmfao no amount of updates can fix this trash
---
No I'm more concerned with utility
---
I have horrible luck crippling scorched, is it because I‚Äôm not using VATS? I have no trouble hip firing everything else. 
---
you're not really acknowledging that the game is unbuyable in Australia, and why that might be.
---
It's reasonable speculation.  You don't have to like it, but calling him an idiot for asking about it, is indeed, shitting on that person.
---
Agreed OP, they should pay the owner for the materials before they can attack or the cost of it been attacked depending on what they destroyed for shits and giggles, hopefully the patch at the end of the month will address it or soon after that.
---
Always store your shower, NPC's can destroy it as well, it's unfortunate but it's reality. 
---
i'm your level and I'm on PC if you ever want to play together :)  Anyhoo... I call out legendarie's positions always. HOWEVER the moment someone starts blasting them to  kingdom come with a TSE I'm going to block their shots and kill the damn thing myself. 
---
You mean double loading screens right?
---
Okay. Thanks for the honesty. It may sound silly but immersion is important to me, since I like to escape into media like games and movies. So when there‚Äôs immersion breaking bugs or when movies break their own logic, I roll my eyes 
---
There are many side to this issue, I have done Uranium Fever a lot, Teamed, Alone, &amp; with other random players, best scenario is 3 players using Mics to communicate, and each keeping an extractor protected/repaired, and calling out Legendary location to share the kill.
---
That said, I have experienced high level players crashing the event, and One Hit Killing everything they can, who won't communicate at all, and low level players that just camp out on the catwalk to tag everything they can but don't help protect or repair extractors, the later being worse than going it alone as more enemies spawn for the extra players making it harder to keep extractors going.
---
Bottom line is, it's hard to play cooperatively without communicating, and most players will share with others who are trying to coop, but when they aren't, I will pull out my Explosive Combat Shotgun, and drop the Mobs instantly.
---
Moving your camp isn't realistic unless you build on a 1x1, camp's are still broken and likely won't place properly for many.
---
For sure, tradermandan or something. Don't think he runs them anymore. 
---
I'm honestly not arguing with you, mostly because I'd love for this to be true, but I copied this from Bethesda's own support page:
---
&gt;**How do I rank up my existing Perk Card?**  
---
&gt;The only way to rank up a Perk Card is to combine duplicates of the same card. The duplicate cards are combined to create the new ‚Äúranked up‚Äù version of the card. Please note that combining the duplicate cards will consume both of them to create the new ranked up version of the card.
---
[https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/44308/\~/how-do-perk-cards-and-perk-card-ranks-work%3F](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44308/~/how-do-perk-cards-and-perk-card-ranks-work%3F)
---
I'm on PC and I have never seen away to bypass picking a new perk card to use that point to level up one that you already have. Until I see it in action (and again, it would make me happy), I stand by my advice: Want rank two Lone Wander? Have one already, and choose **another**, **new** Lone Wander card when it becomes available to you.
---
"It just works"
---
LOL been looking all over farms for the plans for this, thought the pen was for an actual Brahmin. Doh!
---
That sucks man. I assume on pc?
---
The unfortunate problem is there's ppl like me that crash and dc as much as you do in a day, in over a week.
---
2019 has been kind to me so far. I play alot and I'm sitting at 4 crashes
---
Okay! That‚Äôs reassuring. 150 hours solo and counting definitely seems like this could be a good game for me. I enjoy the exploration so it sounds like there‚Äôs plenty of it to do
---
Good lord, I feel you...the noob player base who bought TSEs is so bad. 
---
 Did this event with a level 40ish player last night with the ubiquitous shotgun.  They didn't protect or repair the extractors, so I just key the event fail because I was only there for the steel farming.
---
Once I saw that he was one-shotting everything, I put on glowsight and killed everything I could before he has a chance, including the bosses.
---
I'm tired of playing these bullshit games in nuke zones too.  I'd much rather just tag things and share the loot and xp.
---
You weren‚Äôt the only one. 
---
Welcome to the internet, my friend, where anonymity exponentially increases deuchebaggery, particularly in the voices of the weak. I try and interact with everyone everywhere as though I were face to face with them. All people deserve a baseline of respect until proven otherwise. It's a shame that this never carried over into the internet but lack of physical consequences for your shitty actions leads to shittier actions. Tis the way it's been and will likely always be.
---
That said I don't find this sub or the community of fo76 as a whole particularly toxic; in fact I'd say it's pretty good. 
---
I spent *MONTHS* getting my characters face just right to look like me. 
---
1-70ish I had my starting face. Didn't take too long to make it, close enough to what I usually try for, might as well just play the game. Onllyyyyy once I removed my beard I realized I had LIKE NO FACE. my cheek bones were YUGE. Large golf balls glued onto a jawless skull.
---
Tried again, but I ended up making myself look like some sort of evil uglier rounder faced brother. Worked for a minute, but yeah. Really only looked ok with the body if I was at maximum bulk. And uhhh, yeah, hate to not break the stereotype, but I'm more along the left border of that triangle adjustment between way too skinny and decently lean, depending on how I feel looking in the mirror in the morning. Knew it needed to be fixed.
---
Last and final time I had a lady buddy gal pal over playing Sims 4 next to me on my spare zombie part computer while I played 76. She laughed at my character, jokingly asking who I was trying to even make. Made my case for having no real idea what I objectively look like and to please help if it's *SoooOOoooOoo* wrong. 
---
Yeahhhhh, 20 minutes later my character is the *spitting fucking image* of me. I could never get the forehead-nose-chin ratio right, and I apparently have a thinner face than a large plate. I have spent my ENTIRE gaming career trying to make myself in character creation. Over the years they've gotten better, then gotten worse, then better again. There have been a few that got close, kinda, made people go "oh its kinda like you!" when they see me playing. 
---
This one though. It's not an "oh that's you!". It's a, "what the FUCK that's you!". Not ONCE in my gaming career have I actually seen myself in the game and not whatever my brain picture of myself is. I've shown friends CAMPs or screenshots and the face is the first thing they comment on. Hell, even a lot of the facial expressions for the photomode look *eerily* like my half fake smiles and shit. 
---
Its led to me feeling a LOT more connected to my character. It made me suddenly value my player CAMP that much more, because shit, now *I'm* living there, not some alternate universe sibling relation that somehow rose above the rest of our shitty bloodline to deserve to be in a Vault. 
---
Instead of just playing the game to see what neat things are offered, I'm suddenly mentally role playing even the smallest of things. I engage with other players more over voice because I feel weirdly honest about what I'm projecting.
---
Anyway, long winded way of saying I finally made an ACE character in a game and I'd give ANYTHING to get a face code to save this shit. While the option to customize on the fly is AMAZING and a super smart inclusion to have, to really take advantage of that opportunity I'd really need to save a face. I'd love to gender bend for the sake of a sick outfit motif for a hot minute, or have an alternate personality role play if I have a cool idea that might not warrant leveling something new to 50.
---
This is misinformation. I‚Äôm a crafter and the stats only get raised up to 200% durability. I have boosted my INT to 54 and there is no difference. 
---
Rolled 1000 times, got 8 3 stars, all garbage. zero two shots and zero explosives. Just like the real thing. I sad now.
---
So events like this are the new legendary thing? Because it's always lvl 40s when I go to it.
---
All Rise is still like another 40-50 damage over that, but I prefer to use my heated coil super sledge with 40% faster swing speed and the perk card to have an additional 30% faster swing in strength. 
---
And just to make this post longer, while we're at it with being able to save customized faces, lets go one step further and make fully blueprint-able CAMPs as well. Think we already have it? Hear me out. So when you move your CAMP, it auto blueprints everything you'd had laid out and 80% of the time it will NOT set down in a new place or even the same exact old one. This makes it so in depth terrain conscious builds have 0 hope of mild relocation, nor replication should you come back to that location. It's understandable though. That's why I think we should create another level of Blueprints. Think of the entire building system organization as a tree. On the bottom level you have individual items, in the middle you have locked together and organized module pieces that can be blueprinted, then above that you have the entirety of the build within your green bubble. Why stop blueprinting at the middle level? Why not simply add another level of blueprinting where the game saves the total data of the CAMP (as it does with EVERY log out and log in) and locks it to the location of the CAMP device module itself? While in the game mode to "place" your CAMP with it floating in front either lit up green or red for valid placement, let us alternate to a different placement option that invalidates ALL placement UNLESS locked into a previously fully blueprinted location. Now CAMP placement is restricted to a large handful of EXACT x/y coordinates, creating a 100% similar bubble for building as was previously there. 
---
Actual placement of the CAMP would show one of those hazy yellow CAMP outlines you see in build mode when something broken used to be there and needs to be repaired. You'd simply see that and lock the CAMP module into place. Should you not have enough items in your CAMP stash to recreate the entire structure, you'd be given the option for it to build out as much as possible, with the rest showing in build mode with that hazy yellow CAMP outline when stuff is broken.
---
No more fear of never being able to recreate your work just because you want a change of scenery. You'd have the emotional wherewithal  to commit to a cool build for a long period as well as pick up and leave a build you've loved.
---
I have so many blueprints saved and I can't say I use them much, ever. They're mostly relics of builds gone by...
---
Ugh 
---
I do this too, I'll switch off my big hitter, tag, "Follow me", and drag it to the center for people to tag
---
I'm definitely not saying it will eventually go f2p, just that I would understand their reasoning if they did. They still need to get the game working properly first.
---
Welcome to the club.. Wasn't until after 110 have I finally started accumulating caps.. Currently sitting on 10k after selling a few farmed legendaries
---
Nice build! How did you manage to snap normal floor boards to the foundation? Stairs up and down or is there another way? I tried to build at that spot once, but failed to create something I like, so I gave up on this. 
---
Isn't All Rise a super sledge though?
---
And why cant I melee with my gun in VATS?
---
I've only kneecapped enemies on accident since I never seem to be able to do it when I REALLY need to do it. Like at Whitesprings when I get mobbed :/
---
I'm not using VATS though so maybe that's why?
---
One thing that might be a big difference is i started an alt before xmas.
---
Whitespring hopping and nukes is where most of my early crashes happened.
---
I do run sqb on my alt when i can
---
The game simply doesn't work in the way you are describing which was the point of my entire post. 
---
Bloodied/swing speed is considered best, can get up to 1800 damage or so
---
No its not, you can buy the game in OZ you just cant get it at EB atm is all, I'm in the UK and a quick google search just showed me that but ok whatever.
---
Also in a group chat with a friend from DCUO on ps4 right now and he can buy it from the PSN just fine if he wanted to.
---
Reasonable speculation....Bethesda haven't mentioned anything about free 2 play, so no in my opinion its not, its just some you tuber fishing for clicks and views. Maybe if he had said his mothers aunties uncles just uploaded a video saying its going free2play id believe that more ....oh no wait
---
Sell run to 7 vendors at 200 caps each nets 1400 caps not to mention any nearby cap stashes and nuka cola machines you hit up on the way. 18 nights can result in max caps. No duping involved.
---
At the same time 25k seems fine. While I wouldn't mind a larger cap, at the very least it just limits the amount of caps a duper can sell an duped item for. I do wish I could share my caps, plans/blueprints, and stash items between my alts even if it meant I lost that overall capacity.
---
Your lvl 9, just go kill shit.
---
The sin bin.
---
If you see a nuke zone, find the higher levels and take even one shot at the enemies, full exp, and legendary items that you can sell on reddit for capsor use yourself at later lvls.
---
I love those vids watched all of them
---
I love that you can do this.  Other games mess with leashing and exp time outs.
---
It's not all that simple. Different teams have different strengths, and BGS has proven it's strength lies in its emerging stories from gameplay, diverging paths and the complexity of its systems. Perhaps bugs that usually plague their games are an area of opportunity for them that they have not been able to fill, and I'm not trying to say that they do not detract from the experience.
---
But that does not make them worse developers in of itself. They have proven that at least in this entry they are committed to fixing the issues that got left behind, through their patches and continued support. Perhaps their communication is lacking, but they have showed commitment to improving in this regard, too. 
---
This is an ongoing effort for BGS. We have to accept that fixes are not instant, and they are going to take time. There's no way around that, if they just pushed fixes as fast as they could, they are liable to make the situation worse.
---
I like the idea of having this be inside the game rather than just a regular text chat. Maybe something you can access from the terminal you build in your camp. Have a bulletin board people can post on to say, looking to team up on this event or quest, or looking to sell or buy, or even just an advertisement like come by my new camp near some location.  
---
Thanks dude. :)
---
We nuked this place twice. First time, there were scorched there. Scorched remained after nuke, just bumped their levels up. Cleared em out, had a guy rejoin, just respawned scorched.
---
Second time, ghouls were there before nuke. We nuked and mole miners took their place. I'm not sure what's going on with it, but we had no luck.
---
Correct. Pacifist mode will do no damage to players 
---
Play the main quest line, you will level up naturally, it doesn't take that long.  You can try hit higher level areas like Camden park, I have a camp nearby and loads of scorch to level up or find an area with enemies and just kill them repeatedly. Just explore go find new places, every new place discovered will give you some xp, kill all enemies in each area.
---
Don't rush it, just enjoy the game if this is your first time playing.
---
Alt tab...  pow!
---
Been thinking the same thing. This sounds like is modable though, but I might be wrong
---
Bruh, the navigation wheel sucks on console.
---
Do you have quick swaps tied to the numbers as well?
---
Explore the map. Mostly the forrest region. 
---
At level 9 youre no where near ready to go legendary farming and anything u may get will be locked to a higher level than you can use. 
---
I suggest filling in map points. Explore every area you can. Scrap lots of stuff. Sell to vendors. Do some daily quests in the area. Kill lots of things for experience to level up. It gets easier to start exploring further around level 20. 
---
exploration was always my favorite part of the FO games and there is TONS of it in FO76. It's a huge map with lots of interesting things to see/experience. i also read every note, terminal and listen to every holotape i come across. There is a lot and so many stories. It really is a good game. 
---
Now, don't get me wrong, there are bugs still, and glitches and you will get frame drops at the worst time or disconnections occasionally, but despite all of that it's still a lot of fun. 
---
So, if I love the story and setting and 95% of the gameplay, I should not buy it because they will somehow know that particular 5% is a negative aspect?  That does not seem like it would work.
---
So is action button and exit pa.  So very derp.
---
&gt; However most of the best cards to share with the team are 3-star cards, so you only really need charisma 9
---
You don't even necessarily need that, since you could always use magnetic personality to get your Charisma up to 9 when in a group.
---
I've also been a Bethesda fan since Oblivion. This is a Fallout game. It feels like other Fallout games at various times. I paid full price for it on preorder and have about 190 hours play time. On the whole, it's worth playing. You'll have good experiences and expand your knowledge of the Fallout universe. I do not think it's worth $60, but it's easy to find for less than that. The only real big negatives for me are the feeling that my player has no lasting impact on the world, and the buggy quirks of various parts of the game.
---
Just play and ENJOY the game. Sooner than you know, you will be at leve 100+ grinding the same places again and again. 
---
What does the W and H mean?
---
I need this.
---
I can relate.  Had some tough sledding last night with a Queen run and disconnects, freeze/stutter, and a crash so hard it turned off my console.   
---
So very messy :(  I have sunk a stupid number of hours into this game and been pretty patient, but it's wearing very thin now :(
---
&gt;"Swarm of Suitors"
---
Bugs out every time. Not worth even trying.
---
&gt;"Powering Up Posideon"
---
Amen! Not only that, but there's a bug where if you're in a team you get a permanent loading screen. So an event where you really want a team to make sure you finish in time, and instead you CANT actually be on a team lest you get stuck with a black screen eating up all your time. 
---
Another bug I've been running in to a lot lately is the mobs just plain not spawning when I'm trying to take a workshop. The junkyard is notorious for this, but it happens at other places too. I'll walk right up to the quest diamond and it's indicating something is underground. Even using a grenade doesn't make the monster pop out. Yet you can't take the workshop until all enemies are cleared!
---
Remember to increase your luck for the best load out ive been getting 2s and 3s lately! 
---
Bloodied with swing speed or power damage. Super sledge for 2 hand, powerfist w/ puncturing mod for unarmed, assaultron blade or machete for 1 hand
---
i wasnt the one who launched the nuke, so i didnt check in advance, but it was scorched there when we arrived.  id like to try again with ghouls there first.  also i came from the east not the north, as he recommends in the video, maybe all the legendaries were down before i got to the city, but i was pretty fast getting there.
---
I'm probably around 90 hours in, pretty good for a single playthrough of any Bethesda game. It plays a lot like the others, minus dialogue choices, karma, and humans. There's a lot of robots, lot of recordings, lot of voices on the radio, and a few AI mainframes.
---
The only part you can't solo is the scorchbeast queen, but the moment she appears half the server shows up to fight her.
---
Did around 20 rolls and the only noteworthy thing were some Furious Knuckles. Do knuckles count as melee or unarmed in this?
---
Your skull looks... interesting.
---
When you end up with twice as much raw flux as you have the components to combine do you end up dumping the extra?
---
I build by one of the ponds, it's a nice area with green grass, far enough away from anything not to be a nuisance to anyone, but close enough that I can call in a barrage in an emergency, plus it's pretty flat, so I have no issues building most things, and has a mirelurk spawn point, so I've got a steady supply of food
---
For leveling up, just do whatever quests and events you stumble across. Not much powerleveling that early on. Once you hit the 30's you can try running through nuke zones and tagging enemies to get the xp.
---
As to legendaries in the early game, there's an event called Leader of the Pack at the top left of the map by the fairgrounds. It spawns 3 legendary wolves that are fairly easy to take down. 
---
Yes, on xbox as well 
---
Isn't there a setting for key binding? Or are these two actions tied as if they can only be one key?
---
For console, because we have some analogous inputs, these might be OK as a tied button.
---
Cool, I‚Äôm waiting if it falls through 
---
xbox is only about 4 servers, so you're rotating on those same servers all day (I'm joking of course, but I don't know by how much really)
---
A fallout 76 in-game item registry would be pretty funny
---
Death Claw, Power fist, Miner Claw. Speed to damage is best with unarmed builds.
---
He came strolling up behind me yesterday while i was in the middle (literally) of clearing Big Bend Tunnel. 
---
It's been so long since I've seen AWOL Armaments... is it a weekly now or something? Forgot about that one.
---
I kind of don't want that only because the way they are right now they obscure so much of my screen.
---
If they lowered them a bit or something I'd be down for it though.
---
It‚Äôs called tormentor and it‚Äôs in Luck. It may actually work on full auto rifles. It doesn‚Äôt specify. Explore all the cards. Not all are where you would expect. 
---
I never understood why I couldn't do this, or why I couldn't have two power fists. 
---
You dont have to have unyielding armor. I have a bloodied powerfist and adrenal reaction and can one shot the ghouls. It's just a matter of spacing and timing and not getting swarmed. I use the hazmat suit sometimes or others I'll just stack diluted rad-x
---
Madness where he appears at times
---
Weapon/mutations?
---
If they didn't change it, then that would mean the Commies win
---
Haha two days ago I made a post saying I enjoyed pvp and I think people should give it a shot. Same tone I‚Äôm using now and everything. Got called  ‚Äúthe scum of the earth‚Äù and I have ‚Äúa massive sense of entitlement ‚Äú. I thought they were replying to the wrong post as first lmao 
---
I'm level 80 and still have yet to see a tse weapon drop. All I get is instigator or vampire crappy harpoon or battling guns. I'm mostly melee but I would like a really good tse rifle or shotgun. 
---
If you want legendarys look around for an event called ¬´leader of the pack¬ª, it will give you three propably one star legandarys when you kill all the wolves, and after you complete the event another one will start which will be a hoard event
---
Reeeeeee. I just figured out what was doing this last night.
---
Explore the forest region. Gradually work your way out ward. There is a lot to see and kill without heading  to high level nuke zones. It depends your playing style.
---
Very cool idea. I like anything that allows us to impact the world around us.
---
Did you see a Max condition difference there?
---
Pvp currency. Pvp ARMOR vendor. 
---
Player kills grant 1 unit. Taking a Claimed workbench grants 3 units. 
---
1 star legendary armor = 100 units
---
3 star legendary armor = 300 units
---
Right now there is no currency for end game armor like sentinal/cavalier/assasin/unyielding besides:
---
USD or other legendaries from the same fucking set. 
---
Weapons can be rng forever. 
---
upvote for shiggles
---
As a beginner, following the main quest is likely the best option. It will generally land you some decent weapons &amp; armor to get by, plus you also get caps, xp &amp; it unlocks new options &amp; introduces new locations as you progress.
---
Finding and holding workshop locations is the quickest and easiest way to get CAMP plans, plus xp, caps, chems and other rewards, as well as a load of resources depending on which workshop(s) you've got.
---
Exloring and joining events will also get you a decent amount of stuff, though the difficulty of completing events can vary a lot depending on your equipment and if anyone else is taking part. Ones like the 'Powering up...' or 'Tea Time' events can work best with other people.
---
Working as intended.  Get the perk.
---
Oh I wouldn‚Äôt be playing solo for role playing or anything, just only one buddy got it! I‚Äôm fine interacting with other players in the world. Thanks for the feedback!
---
It already does take the wanted persons caps. Killing a player gives you caps from their amount, wanted or otherwise. I think having the material returned should only happen if THEY claim the bounty tho
---
I actually really like this idea, while they‚Äôre at it can they give us the decent looking terminal that isn‚Äôt inexplicably steampunk style?
---
I do like the idea of creating our own journal entries and camp information for others to read, id actually use it, would take up less budget than trying to spell things out with those tiny letters.
---
On top of that the terminal use could be expanded to unlock/lock doors.
---
Saves on the food cost a good bit thats how I keep my prices low.
---
If you need a barbed wire mod..I may have a few lying around somewhere
---
Idk it works like that for me quite often.
---
I mean I play a little game called Runescape too where you can literally kill 10s of thousands of high lvl/ high risk mobs before you get "good" loot, and still get trash drops a lvl 3 could get off a lvl 3 no risk monster.
---
It's perfectly fine to build a base, just don't build defenses.
---
You can go further then that with chems tho
---
Yes someone got the reference.
---
Is it bad that on XBOX I report the Dbags that one shot the legendary and then give you the thumbs up emote? I usually report for in game language and see if they‚Äôll send me any messages with said language ha. 
---
It's not the greatest of all time or anything. And ofcourse better items can be found. 
---
I use it from time to time because... IT'S A ROCKET POWERED HEAVY HAMMER :D 
---
And as I wrote in a former comment, it's also symbolic. It took so many hours af game play to obtain it.
---
And yes, I build my character upon melee perks and PA so naturally it fits in perfectly.
---
As to the gauntlet? Oooh you are so right! I would also love to attach the vampiric miner gauntlet to a PA.
---
If you're not playing solo maybe clear silo and have a buddy there to insure the mobs are correct before launching?
---
"It depends".
---
There actually isn't a way to reach PA/Hazmat levels of rad resist even though the numbers displayed says you exceed those armor ratings. I've walked around with 2,000+ RR and you still end up taking 8-14 rads. In comparison, the Hazmat suit is 1,000 RR and you take no rads. There's definitely a hidden flag and/or multiplier with Hazmat/PA. Many people have experimented with this.
---
Rad-X doesn't suppress mutations, so if you're looking for a way to keep your Adrenal Reaction for the bloodied build then you can use this while chugging radaway. The last time I tried RadShield I think it did, but I also remember this not suppressing mutations. I'm not sure if that was changed or if I have a bad memory.
---
You can have a teammate run Rad Sponge but you need to make sure you _are not_ using Ghoulish or you'll pop yourself out of Nerd Rage/Adrenal Reaction/Bloodied/Unyielding bonuses pretty easily. Alternatively, if you replace your stimpaks with Ionized Meat you'll be fine since you'll be stacking rads and healing yourself simultaneously (works great with Carnivore).
---
Unyielding is only really useful for melee since you get the STR boosts. Heavy Gunner does great with a bloodied build and you're better off opting for Power Armor since one of perks (Stabilized) requires it. Additionally, Power Armor has an Emergency Protocols mod that reduces incoming damage.
---
For regular armor, you're better off with Sentinel gear than Unyielding unless you really want the STR bonus. Lone Wanderer + Sentinel or Empath + Sentinel with Emergency Protocols pretty much makes you invincible.
---
And, finally, if you're into glitching you can fast travel into the zone to not take any rads at all and play the build like you would anywhere else.
---
I prefer my bloodied heated super sledge 
---
Yes, their opinion is just as valid as yours. Your argument reminds me of all the other threads I see where people argue that if you don't play the main quest first you're playing it wrong; if you don't read every note and terminal you're playing it wrong; if you prioritize grinding at White Springs you're playing it wrong; if you don't take the time to build a camp you're playing it wrong; etc. There is enough in this game that there is no right or wrong way to play the game, however, people are still free to complain about the actions of others that they don't like. 
---
Just because you enjoyed a PvP encounter that involved your camp being attacked doesn't mean others are wrong for disliking that. You enjoyed it and that's great, but others aren't playing it wrong if they don't like that and want Bethesda to change it eventually. 
---
That's not a very good reason to stop playing. Camps are extremely cheap to repair vs how much it cost to actually build them. You'll be fine
---
Yeah I wasn't planning on posting videos of it, til I came across this thread. Just took a couple small videos to send to a friend in a text. Had to keep the file size small.
---
As someone who also experiences dc's and bugs, I would rather they run the scammers and exploiters out of town first. These poison pushers need to stop corrupting our youth!
---
Boosting your charisma through these means will not allow you to share more ranks of a card. 
---
Only the points shown on your special page will count toward sharing more ranks. Anything raised outside of this will just boost passive benefits of charisma. Same goes for all specials. 
---
Always buy something like that, even calibrated shocks. You never know what might happen or if you can resell it to someone for a decent profit. 
---
The fact that nobody has answered to this made feel bad, so I decided to upvote you. 
---
Ha I just saw the small print. props.
---
I'm on xbox too. That's awesome, we could use more people.
---
OMG I just remembered I have an instigating The Dragon on one of my characters that someone gave me because THEY DIDN'T WANT IT. I'm so excited to try that thing out.
---
My own personal head cannon is when a particularly brawly enemy dies the other ones will pick up and use their weapon as a way to honor the dead. That's how legendaries are born
---
I've only done this event once and I used all my steel to complete it.  Whats the best solution, I mean do I need to be repairing all the extractors or can I guard one?  I recall people saying this a great event, so do I need to finish successfully or are the legendary monster drops good enough?
---
I am on PC, just use a controller.
---
It's not 100% patched because I still have to equip my grenades, from time to time. And no, I didn't run out because I have 15+ on me at all times.
---
I lost my x01 jet pack smh
---
r/FO76BROTHERHOOD 
---
I've read all the comments and I think I see what you are talking about.  I'll use an example: when you add a mod to a weapon it lowers the Max Condition (the bar actually gets shorter).  You can still repair the item to 200% but the max Condition still is lower than before you added the mod.
---
Example 2: 
---
You find a set of PA with Max condition 100.  You repair it you 200%.  Your new max condition is 200.
---
With the conditions mentioned in OP post you craft PA and it has a base condition of 120.  You repair it and it has a new max condition of 240.
---
That would be SO awesome! I haven't used MODs in FO76, but I could be tempted to do so if things like this would show up.
---
It is amusing after a explosive fight to walk around, looking for crippled stragglers to plant my Grognak into the back of.
---
Ouch!
---
Unless they stash all their junk.
---
20 rolls of garbage so seems about right. Only 3 times 2\* two of which melee nocturnal or stalker trash and 1 2\* with wood armor
---
Is this real Fallout?
---
Nice job with the fun site too!
---
I can't tell you what to do with your money, but people accepting mediocrity and dishing out money is how we got to this point.
---
Ok no idea what upvote means but thnx?
---
Good call! Rewards should be instanced per participating player. Sick of doing all the leg work and using my steel repairing the extractors only for the TSE guy to turn up and grab all the legendaries /rant
---
Someone built the place up and left the server, their materials remain.  You should be able to dismantle them using the workshop.
---
Is nice to have a base close but they put up platforms to shoot into the windows.  Just makes a mess.
---
Gotcha thanks!
---
First time I saw a nuke drop I was minding my own business exploring at level 6 or 7 near a watch tower and the screen shake huge explosion.  Had on headphone so it was super loud and damn near shat my pants.  Never knew nukes were a thing cause I bought the game blind because I'm a Fallout junkie.  Checked pants took photo 10/10 still recommend.  
---
Always looking for people to play with on here.  I'm on XBone. 95% of people I see are in groups and uber friendly the other 5% are just griefers that I ignore or taunt depending on my mood.
---
Ah, I thought I was the only one with a habit of going for the legs if I encounter anything that can run faster than I can walk in any game that allows it
---
&gt; Boosting your charisma through these means will not allow you to share more ranks of a card.
---
I'm not so sure about that. I haven't grouped in a bit, but I remember sharing a 3-point card a while back using this, and I only have 8 charisma.
---
Most I Ever had at once was 13k, and then I bought the Neon letters. Apart from that plan there's no real point in hording caps other than for player trading, and even then whats the point?
---
Steal from diablo three....  you can scrap legendary for crafting makes to try and reroll.  10 or 20 legendaries allow a rerroll.
---
As below, follow the main quest, do side quests that sound fun.  
---
Try building a CAMP.  Enjoy!
---
just go there and start doing the quest repairs even if the quest doesnt trigger, that way when it does trigger ur nearly done already
---
You'll likely use up a fair amount of stimpaks but killing a Scorchbeast at level 30 is definitely possible.
---
Obligatory: welcome to reddit. 
---
Camp blueprints
---
Ya, I usually sell them in the Enclave bunker.
---
They're worth a fair bit even without much Charisma. Any that go inert before I get to a vender I keep to drink. Not that I'm short on water, but why waste them I guess.
---
I have a level 78 unarmed. So far I have no complaints. You're more limited in the weapons you can choose from, but the ones we have are pretty good. 
---
Some tips:
---
-You can't use power armor and unarmed weapons. Look into berserk, dodgy, and ironclad to help sure up you defenses.
---
-Weapon condition will increase/decrease your weapons damage.
---
-Party boy boy maxed will allow whiskey and Nuka dark to give you +6 upon consumption. 
---
If I think of anything else I'll edit. 
---
Stuff like Water purifiers, Weapon workbenches, Generators Completly gone when moving the Camp
---
Found this: 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg_fo76/
---
You learn the variants for combat Armor Helmets by scrapping Combat Armor, not Combat Armor Helmets.  I have them all unlocked for crafting, including the BOS helmet variant, though I doubt I got that one from scrapping (probably tied to a plan.)
---
Great tip, thanx!
---
Yep! It's been around since even BETA. I think it's a pseudo exploit as I outline here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a42s2g/bug_home_plate_exploit/
---
... but everyone seems to think you should be able to teleport into someone else's Munitions Depot as a feature. I dunno.
---
Fun fact: In BETA, when you could place home plates in CAMPs, you could put your CAMP near a landmark and force players to spawn into kill rooms. It was a pretty awful thing to do...
---
Hi!
---
I'm currently...I dunno, hundred something hours in as well, lvl 117. I've played mostly solo and LOVED the exploration of the other fo games. I have yet to touch about 30% of the map....I bought pre launch and have more than gotten my $$ worth
---
How do I get inside that building? I mean there was clearly stuff inside but I couldnt find a way to get in. Only building I could enter was the top of the stands
---
Out of curiosity... When was the last time you did a nuke run?  And I'm assuming on PC?
---
I'm running on Xbox one x, and ever since the most recent patch (the one we got after PC), this game has been running a hell of a lot smoother in nuke zones (particularly the SBQ).  We had one SBQ where we all dropped to 1 from every 2 secs... it was horrendous.  Next day after the patch... well we've been running it all week (7 of us) and only one person on a launch day Xbox caught some frame rate loss.
---
Ahh man..that‚Äôs what the little voice in my head says that‚Äôs kept me from buying it in the first place 
---
Found Grohm and his Brahmin dead in a Nuke zone, yesterday.
---
I have 120 hours in the game on a PS4 Pro and in that time the game has crashed or booted me from the server at least twice a day. This is the least interesting of all the Fallout games I have played so far since Fallout 3. With that said, it can be fun at times. It‚Äôs very tedious to grind and build up your camp and arsenal but that process is satisfying on some level for me. The quest design is fairly pedestrian except for the two major faction quests. The game is probably worth $30 in terms of gameplay hours. The micro transaction system is better than most I have seen because you can earn a lot of currency through normal gameplay. 
---
I have a perk load out manager.
---
there is a rad glitch, it is random though.  You can try and force it by moving in and out at the edge. But otherwise if you fast travel you have 50/50 odds of suffering zero rads if you say you go to the scorched event or if you load on a friend at monongah or whitesprings. 
---
thank you but i know this. it is still what i am looking for
---
Hello lol
---
If you have friends on the server you can always send one to Monongah while you wait in the bunker to launch the Nuke. You can clear the bunker and wait for a good while before deciding to launch it. 
---
If it's molemen, I hear Harper's Ferry is worth checking out as well. 
---
RNGesus is a harsh master, true enough.
---
I've done it maybe a dozen times and gotten it about half of them. IF I hadn't uninstalled it from the sheer lack of things to do in the post-game, I'd offer to go try my hand again.
---
Getting Mesa Prime in Warframe, Vaal Hazak fangs in Monster Hunter, or literally enough light level progress in Destiny to do any kind of endgame content. Now those are my personal RNG foils.
---
OK so Saturday night when we nuked white springs, with just 1 nuke run until the blast zone ran out I got 4 legendary weapons somewhat close to a TSE:
---
\*2 shot missile launcher
---
\*2 shot medic combat shotgun
---
\*exploding laser pistol
---
\*exploding gatling
---
I didnt get an actual TSE drop, but that was just because the rolls didn't drop the combined tags in my favor, but the server definitely was dishing out what was necessary to get a TSE weapon and this definitely seems to align with what the OP has observed.  I can only recall 3 times at the moment where a server was giving me more than 1 two-shot weapon drop, and this time it dropped exploding and overall felt like it was handing out two-shot &amp; exploding guns like candy.  
---
To me it seems like there absolutely is some merit behind this idea.  **The only thing we did before nuking white springs was we nuked between Huntersville &amp; WestTek (also covering Ripper Alley)** as at the time the group I was with wanted to see if anything useful woudl spawn there legendaries wise.  It was pretty pitiful with like maybe 2. 
---
When I have time I'm going to nuke the same place first and then nuke white springs to see if that has anything to do with it for some weird reason but I doubt it.
---
Uranium Fever, AWOL, Eastside of the map.
---
Usually fast travel.  Got a max of 440 with excavator. 
---
I'm certain. I've been running support for a long time. But if you could prove me wrong I would be happy as that would be a game changer. 
---
it would last?
---
They turned the Railroad into "Machines have feelings too."
---
I honestly don't think they'd give a damn about this.
---
Flatwoods monster having a party.
---
Okay. Thank you for the opinion on the micro transactions. I didn‚Äôt think to ask about that!
---
No doubt... Tab? Space?
---
Sweet, I'll add ya when I get on 
---
I never said i was interested in it. was just curious what was going on so i could try counter it.
---
Want and Have. 
---
Fuuuu
---
Yep yep yep. Best buddy from college was in film and makes has made his living recording/editing all sorts of stuff over the years.
---
I'm a biology grad who hasn't edited a video since high school a decade ago. He still sends me stuff as he's already cleared me of having an objectively good opinion via friendship, so he knows he's getting honest critiques from a fresh set of eyes that has that sub-conscious wishy-washy "I can tell this is quality" trait.
---
I've helped him with stuff as small as adding another half second before a transition to adding/refining to his ideas as a whole. Feels fun knowing someone trusts your opinion enough to have you proofread the stuff that puts food on their table. I always give that extra little bit of effort when he approaches me with something work related. Makes me feel like my normal drawn out bullshitting has a focus and point!
---
Realistically though, other than a one off situation here or there like you said, for fun, no one will ever touch them maybe it wasted dev time to give them legendaries then or really even have them in the game.
---
If you've taken the Dirt Track workshop then enter Workshop mode and remove part of a wall.
---
Sorry that happened to you, I haven‚Äôt launched a nuke in weeks for this reason, better to server hop til you find one.  Also wish there were a longer delay, or you could choose a longer one when you launch it, so you can repair, farm some ammo and stimpacks (ie if lower level), take a break...  as is seems people swarm your spawns before you can even get to your own nuke 
---
The trick is you must go from the north no matter what if you enter from any other direction it can spawn the shit mobs. Good to see youtubers not informing when they had to piggyback off others learning the nuke areas. 
---
Take workshops in slightly tougher areas. The defend events will be easier if you spam turrets, just make sure to tag the enemies. You‚Äôll also get lots of new plans and gear for doing the defend events. 
---
Claim sunshine meadows and Poseidon and you‚Äôll be set. 
---
Also, keep repeating Powering up Poseidon to get the fusion generator plans
---
Guess you should deal with it.
---
Yeah.  I'm starting to sour on this game a bit.
---
my ps4 handle is the same as my reddit handle add me if ya like
---
I‚Äôm very sad I can‚Äôt upvote it more
---
 If you overlap two letters, then a third letter will snap perfectly to the right of the first one.
---
For example, say you are placing the word "CAMP".  Place the "C". Then place an "X" right on top of it. The "A" should snap to the "C" just fine. Then move the "X" to overlap the "A". Place the "M" onto the "A".  So on and so forth...
---
This is how I was able to place all of the letters on the wall of my camp when I experienced the same issue that you described.  Once you get the hang of it, it doesn't take that much time.  
---
Note: Mine are placed on brick walls.
---
The workshop bench is outside near the bottom of the stands. I think what you're showing is around back. Go to the bench, claim the workshop, go to where this disco fort is and scrap it.
---
the conditional difference is nice, but it really doesn't change the core gameplay by a significant amount unless you invest an enormous amount of resources min/maxing it, and/or play for literally thousands of hours with the exact same gear. At it's core power armor has great longevity on it's own, and a 50% increase in durability isn't necessary to make it good, it just is. Case in point I picked up a beat up 65% durability remaining arm for my pa and haven't had to fix it yet, and it's not like I am at great risk of dying because of a tiny amount of resistance I could get by repairing it to 200%.
---
The effect on weapons suffers the opposite problem, weapons break so fast that an extra 10% doesn't stop the weapon from being a liability, it's much more significant than with PA, but just isn't spectacular. Same goes for regular armor that feels like it's made of paper and cheese as far as durability goes. Getting solid gouda and crafting paper instead of Havarti and fine printer paper is still not great.
---
How  do mods violate TOS?
---
It‚Äôs not quite double but it‚Äôs well over a 100 wats. 
---
All events should show up on the map, fed up of travelling to a place to try and get an event to trigger only to find it doesn't because it's not time yet or recently ended.
---
All events should instance rewards based on participating players, sick of using my steel to fix the extractors and using up a load of ammo in Uranium Fever only for some TSE player to turn up, kill the bosses and grab all the legendaries.
---
Heart of the Swamp is a shitter that I always avoid because the damage output of the Mirelurk Queen acid is insane and can't be mitigated much, coupled with how much ammo and healing I use as well as damage to my gear it's just not worth doing it for a piss poor reward.
---
They are going to be in the un-opened Vaults for sure
---
Can I scrap stuff without having vision on it?
---
There must be a max cap because there is no difference between the gear I craft.
---
Regardless, I have found a high INT build is not worth it because you can easily get 200% durability with perks, you do not craft endgame armor because you will be using legendaries, and you are missing out on special points that could be used in other attributes.
---
As someone who always does an INT build, I feel betrayed because its next to useless in this game. I miss the good old days when INT/PER was good for energy weapons. The least they could have done is allowed it to boost xp gain like it used to.
---
Someone on here posted a test they ran of dropping items in various ways. Ive dropped like 40 plans in those caches multiple times and when i go back an hour or two later they are still there. So i think so. 
---
I just destroyed a base that was basic and wooden. It gave me a 350 cap bounty. I dont know if you use a 2x2 but it's a pretty fair system. 
---
that is exactly it.
---
Unless they're all dead. 
---
I like how we upvote posts that are essentially "I actually had fun with no crashes".
---
Wait until your quests on the right hand side load in, and you should be golden to use the map and pip-boy, and to start moving. Now that I do this, I haven‚Äôt had any problems with my game freezing or glitching
---
ok thanks
---
Nice, I'll give that a shot, thanks!
---
No way man. Not every single Vault.
---
Yeah, if there's at least 2 people doing it, I always try to go.
---
I wait around till most off the players leave and then look for the flies. That was my work around. Still works great.
---
Which they will be 100%
---
All I get is regular loot I could get at another event other than her being hard to kill it's not a very end game experience so far
---
The vaults are all empty of human life as shown through they various YouTube videos
---
I am in complete disagreement. 
---
We need more REWARDS for destroying player CAMPS. If i wreck your walls, i should get wood. If i wreck your shower, i should get the materials required to build it. 
---
Then you could kill me and get your shit back. It would be more balanced. 
---
Right now, i grind 800 caps every session just so i can lose them pvping. 
---
Pvping needs no more punishment. Its bad enough. Ive lost 2k+ caps in less than an hour of raiding. 
---
 Go raid for a while and let me know if you think its worth the caps sink. 
---
1.  We do all that upfront which is why it takes 45 min usually lol
---
2.  Im never surprised that a nuke draws all the attention.  Not only do I have to work to get all the pieces in place for it to happen, and it's where anyone can go to usually get some quick xp or loot, but everyone knows it's usually one or two waves and done so better get there first.
---
With as long as the zone lasts it's pretty dumb that the zones don't respawn at accelerated rates, at highly increased rates, and with diversity.  This is likely due to performance capacity capability.  I usually spend more time gathering for serums than killing.  
---
Eh, this sounds a lot like WoW. I am not against being able to have a second currency, I want caps to be worth something, was the whole point of the topic heh.
---
Based on what the terminals said from the people that glitched into the vaults, its very much looking like they are :/
---
i've got about 150 hours in of solo play. that's a lot of bang for your 8 funny dollars. 
---
If the tesla coils have black titanium it's a torso excavator mod
---
I hope so
---
I nuked Monongah about an hour ago and verified first that scorched were there. After nuking they were just high level scorched. Waste of a nuke and time.
---
Could very well be, depending on the experiments Vault Tec decided to run in them. 
---
150+ rolls not a single 3* item :(
---
is amazon uk and au separate?  I was checking on all the .AU sites.   
---
I'm not trying to keep the troll alive or anything, just keeping the door to speculation open.
---
Yes it's quite impairing for German and French players. I don't know if there are other keyboard layouts. The solution is to install a virtual QWERTY keyboard but that's just ridiculously overkill to just... play a game. Also it's annoying when you have to switch from one layout to the other because you want to type on Discord while trading. 
---
There is also a more recent addition to the list. Now "Q" shows items you may buy at your CAMP / hides those you haven't found a plan of yet. So if you use A (Q equivalent in AZERTY) as your action key to open doors, loot corpses, etc. well you can't place items in camps anymore! You need to rebind. So fun!
---
In any case, those big issues would be solved simply with a bigger freedom to rebind keys. Why do they keep insisting on hardcoded values?
---
3 scorch beasts died over the queen I waited an hour for them all to despawn and still couldn‚Äôt find it, but always another queen üòÇ
---
It seems like something that probably won't catch on. Cool that it was found and gives hope that there could be another good place to nuke out there. Hopefully without having to game the servers to get a decent mob to spawn.
---
I really hope we hear something addressing this in the near future. Maybe DLC will open up more areas to at least spawn a boss something like SBQ. Otherwise what's the point of being able to nuke the whole map. Makes me wonder if all the fissure sites have been nuked yet, or if that will yield something in a future update. White springs could just be a fluke, like you weren't supposed to ever get mobs like that. I Become Death wants you to nuke a fissure site, or optionally fissure site prime. 
---
PC - If all of your steel is bulked, attempting to craft ammo will try to break down any mods you currently have in your stash before using the bulked steel. This is especially annoying. You have to drop the mods on the ground to get the ammo bench to use your bulked steel instead or you lose the mods.
---
&gt; Regardless, I have found a high INT build is not worth it because you can easily get 200% durability with perks, you do not craft endgame armor because you will be using legendaries, and you are missing out on special points that could be used in other attributes.
---
200% of its max durability (using overheal) - BUT, you can build something which has a higher max durability. 
---
Yeah, Int gets a shaft, because you won't be using armour you made outside of PA, nor use weapons you made... because of legendary effects being so much stronger than good base equipment.
---
If Int based heroes could rebuild Legendaries, it would be a different story, but it isn't....
---
Yes but you can't build a super sledge up to the same damage as it.  I've tried and the mods that you can use to get a super sledge to look like it still have like 50 less damage. 
---
I've omitted factors that you can really control ingame, such as what level legendary enemies you hunt or what default mods a weapon receives.
---
Those people are the worst. Let everyone have a chance to tag legendary enemies. 
---
that, and if something is killed inside a collectible plant (example soot flower), there is a good chance that it is either unlootable, or you have to spend 5 mins screwing around to loot it (or a meat pile)
---
See You Space Cowboy... 
---
Makes sense!  I can‚Äôt do anything with the flux and haven‚Äôt bothered to bazaar it.  I have a melee alt now that would probably have a much easier time with the whole process, but (1) despite level 65 I‚Äôm still on rose‚Äôs dumb quests and (2) not sure how to get a keycard as melee... :(
---
I saw that someone else posted a link to the brotherhood, which is fine if that's what you're into.
---
I'm part of the Enclave and we have a group of active PS4 users. If our faction interests you please come join us on Discord! https://discord.gg/EMWnPWj

I see that now! hahaha
---
VATS is nothing. Get a jet pack and you will truly see what core drain is. 
---
Damn, unlucky me got All Rise at level 30ish, sold it when the damage dropped off... and now I'm gonna go cry.
---
Instigating bloodied swing speed 2 handed pole hook has the best dmg and scaling I believe
---
Noob q? Can someone tell me what tse stands for? 
---
Good to know. I rarely go after folk with bounties, but couldn't resist on one last night. 580 in Harper's Ferry, FT and just stayed there, crouched, with chameleon armor. Poor guy, he was sneaking away from the super mutants, and had no clue I was right there. Bam, headshot with lever action and made off with my caps. (I never bother looting bags). 
---
Stealth sniper is great for being the hunter but not so much when caught off guard. Some douche ran up to a workshop I owned, went to claim, shot me up with an auto tse handmade, then ran off. Never did fully claim it, just wanted to kill me. Ah well. 
---
Lol I don't know why my autocorrect has started making up entire different words for stuff I want to say. I mean it just changes one word into 2 seperate words. I have never expierienced this but it start happening often now. I think I need a different keyboard than Google.
---
Wtf is up with that? I have a 2 shot combat sniper rifle that might hit 1/10 in VATS. Love it for aimed shots but useless in VATS.
---
It is considered hacking the game for an unfair advantage. You may or may not get in trouble for it. Depends on if they are looking at what mods you use or just banning people for using any mods.
---
It's 23 euros incl. taxes (19%) that's roughly 26 dollar.
---
What are the little icons next to people‚Äôs names
---
Yeah. I‚Äôve been getting Serum Recipes off of SBQs. Just two. But still. I attribute it to my 8 Luck. 
---
I‚Äôm 117 and still never seen TSE. Plus I‚Äôve played since beta.
---
There are things that you can purchase from vendors that are 5,000 caps a piece. 
---
20% of your absolute max caps for a single item seems like ratios outta whack. And there's a bunch of that item, so you'll probably want to buy several, plus it's semi-consumable, too. It's entirely possible that you'll have to buy the same item several times. 
---
Want my x01 mods!
---
It's not forever. I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed.
---
No, that promotes bad player behavior.  Why so greedy?
---
Yes but that would mean that people who know of kids have a fixed game and people who don't know how it works won't. Also pc will have a way better game than console since the mods on PC are better. 
---
Unarmed
---
How do you trigger this event?
---
Ah thanks. I think I'll just keep running till I am about level 50 lol.
---
For real, I have a high level friend who lets people in the area shoot the enemy one time each cause we can't do piss for damage anyway... Then he'll one shot it at half its health. So we all get the xp.
---
If you spam vats you can watch your fusion core charge drop so I'm sure core charge is tied to ap cost, but im not sure if the perk for slower draining will have an affect on that though. 
---
assassins legendaries and home wrecker perk were built into this game for a reason and have been around since beta.  we really need separate servers for people who want or dont want these pvp features in their game. we have completely different interests, we need completely different servers.
---
At least you are saying you will come back. I haven‚Äôt experienced 95% of the issues people have complained about here. I am on Xbox1 Original even the people with S or X have had a lot worse issues. 
---
I've been fortunate to come across 10 of the 19 mutation recipes and of the 19, 10 of the better ones.  If I can get enough of the recipe I can easy produce 10 or 20 serums...space is the problem.  Flux and serums are heavy considering.
---
At lvl 134 I've learned to invest in perk cards for when I NEED guns, such as shooting things up high, but I tend to stick to melee.
---
Why do you need more than 25k at one time?
---
Per the updated inside the vault, that they corrected like 2 hours after release:
---
"With Patch 5, the damage bonus for Two Shot Legendary modded weapons has been reduced from +100% to +25% damage and the Two Shot legendary mod can no longer be looted in the world. The Explosive Legendary mod has a reduced damage bonus, now adding +20% of the base weapon damage with explosive radius damage instead of +100%. Note: This was a misunderstanding in what was being addressed with these mods. They will still be available in the world but are just undergoing some balance changes."
---
Also, this is for the next patch, not the last one
---
Hey, you might know.  Are 2H weapons still considered 2H for Perk when using them in PA, which uses only one hand?
---
Bye
---
Don't mind whoever downvoted you, I agree with you in principle. Now one thing that might be arguable is how intensely you use that wallet-vote.
---
I definitely apply it and don't buy some games, but the little things that irritate me have common sense solutions and if they have missed that they will miss the meaning of the vote too. It's not clear that not buying a Fallout title will make them allow more freely rebinding for example. 
---
Yep.. lots of 1 and 2.  3 are meant to be very rare.
---
I accidentally scrapped a focused heavy charged gatling laser In a pile of hunting rifles. So much sad right here.
---
That's the best way. Can't wait for them to nerf TSE
---
I had a shotgun with 127 range I made before I chose to  go rifle/melee it is possible 
---
The marine dense mod plan is mislabeled as marine. I‚Äôve had luck at grafton 
---
Can we PLEASE talk about WHAT THE FUCK CAME OUT OF THE GROUND?!?!?! at  :12/:13 secs.    
---
Bottom left of the vid, something wicked this way comes out of that blocked doorway!
---
Right? I'm not giving away free access to my workshops and base to just anyone...
---
... and get banned ...
---
I‚Äôll just be sure to toss my grenades away from myself :)
---
I focused on damage perks not defence.. I don‚Äôt see any perk I would be willing to swap for fireproof. Maaybe the limb damage luck perk, but I like having 6 in each special to play with.
---
My camp is here too! My silo alpha and the bee on the map
---
 So no chance you are just gonna play the game then? 
---
 I do get a kick out of this nonsense: "I must be OP!"
---
 I have one and I kinda regret it. Its just a one shot level 20 Combat Shotgun exploder and I only use it when stuff gets tough, but I wish I'd never picked it up sometime.
---
Look at the whole economic picture.  Vendors have cap limits and players have cap limits.  It discourages negative player behavior like hoarding and large-scale farming, and other greed-driven behavior.
---
You don‚Äôt need caps for much.  The game is also designed so you shouldn‚Äôt be cap grinding.  It‚Äôs discouraged and of no benefit by design.
---
r/unexpectedsoundsmith
---
one of my friends i play with is hoping for a 'fissure site nuke order event' where if u nuke the fissure sights in the right order ending with the prime fissure sight it spawns a schorchedbeast king or something like that.  could be a cool idea
---
They corrected that to say the 2 shot is stillportable, mobile reddit didnt take kindly to the strike throughs, but they updated it like 2 hours after releasing the latest inside the vault. Also, this is for the next patch, not the latest.
---
In watoga I found it but it unlocked marine, not sure if to continue looking there or somewhere else
---
I just hopped on now and tried to share my hard bargain 3-pointer at level 8 charisma, and it said I don't have enough CH. I then put on a piece of armor with +1 Charisma on it (so in my pipboy it says I have 9 charisma, but in my cards section it still only shows 8), and it allowed me to share that perk. 
---
I wasn't in a group so haven't tried magnetic personality yet, but I assume a +charisma from that should function similarly to a piece of armor boosting charisma by 1.
---
You found it at grafton? 
---
They're pretty random. And usually repetitive.
---
Awesome, TY! 
---
All the other ‚Äòpeople‚Äô in this game ARE humans lmao. 
---
There are no human NPCs. Except that dude I saw on a video of the developers room. Wooby? 
---
What you think he‚Äôs in there for? All alone and sad. 
---
You think they tested the weapons on him in there? 
---
Poor guy. 
---
The low vendor caps was not some typo or accident.  It‚Äôs an economic throttle.  You are t supposed to be working vendors for caps.
---
Id like an alternate avenue to end game gear. 
---
If saving up caps and buying gear with caps is the avenue, OK. I am in. 
---
Id prefer a non-dupable currency. Id also prefer pvp and pve gear grinds seperate. 
---
Right now, gear is complete rng. If i want an assasins/cavaliers set for instance i hope for a random drop from 3 star enemies that goes through the loot tables of every weapon and armor????? Forget about it. Ill take the 20 dollar duped set from gameflip before i go wasting 100s of hours grinding something that isnt even fun, with no guaranteed drop. No thanks. 
---
Maybe if sets were in specific locations id deal with a grind. Like assasins was at whitesprings. Unyielding in glass caverns, sentinals at the high school. 
---
Im not sitting through 7 seperate rng rolls of loot tables. Chances are against us ever getting what we want and theres NO HONEST MARKET. 
---
id rather dump 20 bucks on gameflip and buy a set. 
---
A L50 (or 95) enemy can still drop lower-level items.
---
It really ruins it when your Assassin + Sentinel armor piece is L40.
---
T-60 armor plans have a high chance from distant thunder. T-51 is savage divide and mire treasure maps. T-45 is toxic valley and rarer from forest. Raider is mainly forest and sometime toxic. Ash heap is the odd one I have seen excavator mod plans tier 1-3 only and are the most common but can have raider/45/51b.  Tier 4-5 are from vendors Hit up the BoS vendor in watoga for T-60/T-51b calibrated jetpacks helm mods etc... Hit up camden park for T-45 and rarely T51b from the vendor.   
---
Bog treasure maps is only T-60.   
---
Handmade plans harpers ferry on a low level still or you need luck with safes or containers. . TSE are random there is no one spot. I got a TSE lvl 5 pump from a 2 star radstag lvl 4 at whitesprings. I have gotten TS's just roaming the world and my others came from doing horde events and that has been since the latest patch.   
---
As for mass treasure maps your best bet is buy off other players I say a post a bit back offering them up for 10 caps each. I can almost guarantee they are dupes but that is up to you.   
---
As for MG60 if you mean the M2 50 cal it is on the BoS vendor for plans if you mean the grenade or MG32 LMG it is found on responder vendors. Welch and Grafton have the best odds.   
---
I hope this helps.   
---
I saw a list on here before with some specific plans having a higher chance at certain ones, I had luck with that and it seemed to be true, but its only for a few, seems the majority of plans will be pure rng
---
The two vendors at Grafton have a small chance of selling combat armor plans. Server hop &amp; farm them. 
---
this looks to be a bug but I see your point. Nice.
---
Two Shot Explosive.
---
Serums are 200-500 caps a pop from players.
---
Ive seen 50 caps if you supply the materials.
---
Signs and letters is the only thing that costs alot at 10k
---
Valid points.  Thanks for the insight.
---
I personally, just buy stuff I see at the vendors that are in high demand; Calibrated shocks, plans, etc.  But I pretty much just give them away.  So, I'm sure I'd be close to a cap limit if I didn't give so much away or spend a few hours doing goofy pvp losing 2k caps =P
---
I recently got a Tesla as a reward from Monster Mash, so I equipped it and started messing around to test.  I think I want to build a Tesla rifle char now and it looks like its going to be the same basic build as a Gauss Rifle sniper.
---
Leeloo Dallas multipass, multipass.
---
I only bother selling the legendary stuff if I'm close to a vendor. Otherwise it gets the paper bag treatment.
---
dense combat armor has a chance to be either marine or combat armor it can be bought at both places grafton station seems to have it more often though. 
---
Yeah, it's the repetitiveness I was looking to change up. I feel I haven't gotten a new plan from a defend in the last 20 or so defends. Was thinking about changing up the workshops I use but maybe I've gotten all the plans out of them I'll get.
---
Allready have a level 90 and 80 legit just want to make a fun explosives build with rocket launcher and crap
---
Demon coming for ya
---
If you get the perk that reduces the weight of energy ammo it will also reduce the weight of fusion cores with level 3 of the perk i believe fusion cores only weigh 0.8 of a pound it makes it easier to have a high quantity on hand which works well with the excavator power armor and farming because of the extra weight it allows you to carry. Power armor isn't only useful for battle but also farming materials
---
Two shot explosive
---
What do you want for it
---
r/fo76bazaar or r/market76
---
Hmmm. That is something. The other player coming out of stealth? Strange headgear though. Would explain this whole thing though. Would have thought the OP would have mentioned it if the workshop was already taken though. Might just be a build-able area that some one created a really strange CAMP in?
---
Dunno. If it were I, I'd just relog, and let disco fort be.
---
He watches over us. 
---
Well, I DO value some of this legendary stuff less than a golf outfit anyway...
---
Whats your psn?
---
Thanks for the tip, didn't know that.
---
I guess my point is that if the game is designed so that a much more powerful character, no doubt boosted up on a bunch of duped bobbleheads or something, can repeatedly kill me and wreck my shit - why would I play this game when I can play something else where that doesn't happen or the combat is at least fair?
---
After the nerf ppl are going to learn mechanics or fail.
---
The tears are going to flow
---
 Oh I'm keeping it. If I do get rid of it I'll sell it to Wallace for, I dunno 25 caps or so.
---
Leeloo Dallas Multi Pass! 
---
 As far as I'm aware it does, i leveled a camp that was too close to mine and racked up neatly 500 caps in bounty. The only thing i can think of is dude had help. Two people level a base, one cleans the others wanted level, then vise versa. 
---
I think thats a Player?! I can't remember seeing anyone around on the map when I got there. I think that could be a hacker. That would explain why there was stuff inside a building with no entrance.
---
Had one of those the other night he was the worst...he sat there killing my team since one had hit him and didn't know about pacifist it was a sad day and he kept taking everything. I felt bad as I was just trying to help some lowbies.  
---
too be fair I've seen far more crappy legendaries than I have gold outfits.
---
I think the "group rewards" are the pittance you get when a nearby team-mate completes a quest.
---
I know people will hate me for saying this, but You shouldn't bis stuff in the Atom Shop at all. They shouldn't get Money from US to Show how much we want a working Game. Rumors Point in the direction, that the Game will Go F2P and thats horrible for someone Like me Who saves for 3 months Just to get the Tricentennial edition and now it's W√∂rth 40% of the f√ºll prize.. I want this Game to be good in any aspect nur they have to Work hard now to get this Game going

tied to same action/key.  you can separate them with a mod though.

If your having issues with Amazon try one of the 101 other OZ based stores 
---
[https://www.ozgameshop.com/search/fallout+76](https://www.ozgameshop.com/search/fallout+76)
---
Check company address and reg on contact pages then check stock levels, I'm sure you'll work out the amazon thing if you care enough :)
---
The door to speculation is always open.....that's all it is though and shouldnt be reported by idiot you tubers as fact and then banded around by that you tubers "fans" should it?
---
Bit like the guy who started the rumours / speculation / lies about the ability to steal stuff from other players inventory's (not been reproduced - its just a shitty trade system) oh wait....which you tuber was that i wonder?
---
If you want an easy time and want to do easy mode go melee go strength at level 5 I think you can get a power armor frame you can't have the armor equip but you can utilize a frame which increases your defenses and power armors just cool level 15 you can start farming Raider power armor sometimes that spawns at level 15 at level 25 you can do a quest line that rewards you with the excavator armor and that will take you to 100 plus you can use that power armor to do whatever you want to do
---
I‚Äôll give you 3k
---
So you found combat dense at grafton and it was called combat dense?
---
Unless it has changed recently a few weeks ago I was sharing a level 2 perk while I had 1 natural charisma boosted to 7 cause of him sharing magnetic personality. 
---
R I can give you a max level TSE shotgun 
---
 Well get a Rocket Launcher then. I do enjoy the M79 myself.
---
I think you'll like it. I haven't had many issues myself. I've played about 300 hours and am level 130ish. I certainly got my money's worth. I play mostly solo, but have made a few friends through my travels that I will team up with if they are playing. 
---
For advice, just take your time. Don't be in a rush to complete the main story. Go out and explore. There are hidden bits everywhere. The teddy bears. The gnomes. Pay attention to the world around you and you will be richly rewarded. Define your own goals. Don't be limited by the quests and events provided. Some of the best moments for me would happen when I was just out hunting for springs.
---
If legendaries would be worth their actual value, we couldn‚Äôt sell those due to the 200 cap per vendor limit 
---
Yes, but there‚Äôs a chance you may buy the exact named thing but it‚Äôll be for marine 
---
Both?
---
 Not me. As I said it ruins the game.
---
At the right height, the turrets fire directly into the broken windows.  :( 
---
I only use QoL mods and refuse to use any mods that give me a PvP advantage. 
---
ok ty
---
Well said.
---
 I got one but it‚Äôs for level 50 and need to get to level 50
---
Can you elaborate on sources in the custom ini please
---
Username checks -- ahh, can't go there anymore.
---
Erry day 
---
West tek Is good. You're guaranteed a multiple star enemie inside, but sometimes you get very lucky. High level super mutants give good exp too. 
---
So I can buy good stuff after the nerf? So I can stay stocked on superstims, radshield, radaway because I use the gimp regular armor instead of OP PA?
---
What do you want me to do, keep posting 'fix the game'?
---
That's boring.
---
You can set your flair for different subreddits.
---
A note to the gourmands, human meat is not accepted tender
---
It's fine. I had that one coming!
---
I respect your opinion. Cheers, sir.
---
I sell assault rifles. With high luck they're always over repaired.
---
I get 40-60 caps a pop
---
Two Shot Explosive.  It‚Äôs a type of Legendary gun that‚Äôs overpowered. 
---
Hm. Ok, my turn to test this when I get home. I'm certain I've tried this before and it didn't work. I'll test when I get home. Awesome if it does work like than it opens a lot of opportunities with other special stats. 
---
I will report on my findings later. 
---
Sounds like we got a commie over here! 
---
Jokes aside, why do we have to do damage to get xp/loot when we are in a event/team together? Should automatically benefit all parties.
---
I just learned it but can not do it on mobile
---
What mechanics? Bugged scorched scream? "Increased" landing, i love game, but comeon, this is fucked up. It is fun first time, it is ok next 10times but then it become fucking anoying experience you want avoid.
---
Yeah we need something like berry mentats  to find corpses I lose a lot of stuff 
---
I bash rad roaches instead of wasting ammo on them. Or finish off something with a sliver of hp left rather than spend a round.
---
You know now that you mention it I feel like you right me correct now. I'll check when I get home. 
---
 I seldom run over a k myself but I can generate that much quite quickly. 
---
 My low level plan guy has done very well and money is easy.
---
Lol, [this should have been the game's tagline.](https://imgur.com/a/ocXwE7a)
---
Just to be clear, 'raiding' isn't a thing in the game. You guys that are bored have taken to ruin other peoples experience and have just given it that name. 
---
PC Master race = hey honey do you want to try playing this Fallout game? it's pretty good... oh occasionally I'll need you to do some transfers for me.  Muwahahaha!  She is addicted now tho. /
---
Serums cost over 20K but that's pretty damn rare
---
Can‚Äôt interest you in anything you said you don‚Äôt even want it
---
I mean the scrapping of 20 leather takes 20 seconds(just pull out 2 bulked leather and scrap them), and most don't take more than a few minutes. So the daily rewards are 15 minutes to complete. the bigger problem I have is that I don't want anything in the Atom store so I'm sitting on over 6k of atoms I've earned(I've only spent 3k of the atoms I've earned). 
---
 I'm PC anyway, but I can make both an M79 and a Missile Launcher for many levels.
---
I need to do this as when I spawn, I ALWAYS fall off of a huge cliff 
---
Not until Bethesda does something about all of the duped weapons and materials out there, or you'll just tank the economy worse than it already is.
---
I have Discord overlay set to Pause/Break; seems to work well, though my favorites seem to come up when I leave the overlay (fwiw I have favorites bound to Q)
---
I guess... But is the atom bomb hair style or fruit salad hat lore friendly? I'm not saying I disagree, because I love the Fallout lore, but sh- be crazy in 76.
---
Maybe that hair style is lore friendly... I hope not though. üòÖ

I put my Steam overlay on Numpad Minus cuz nothing seems to use it.

Any or all of these could go in the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm irradiated‚Äù slot cause I‚Äôve never seen anyone use that one tbh
---
Swarm of Suitors is a wired one, although you have to get to the island, the event actually takes places on the nearby shore, you need to kill an elite mirelurker twice and his Entourage and then kill the queen which is fucking difficult not least because the disease they give you means you 25% less ranged damage. 
---
By the way Grafton day and the Protest in Grafton are two separate events but basically they suffer from the same problem which is the super mutants. 
---
Just go to the nearest station. Every stain has a bench, a stash box, and a vendor. Scrap everything at the bench, stash what you want to keep, sell what you don't, fast travel home.

 You know they are gonna nerf exploders to 25% of what they were? 
---
When I'm not using my explosive single action, I use a cultists blade with swing speed as well as damage reduction while power attacking. 
---
That is a good point and nobody can blame you for wanting to quit but something not many people realize is that those kinds of players make up less than 5% of the entire playerbase. You are FAR more likely to meet a high level that wants to give you free stuff than a high level that wants to bully you. Best thing you can do is block them in the game and join another server. Bethesda is working on methods to distract those kinds of players so they dont prey on others. Things can get frustrating but this game still has a lot of potential and development to do and you dont wanna fall behind because you gave up. Stick with it and you'll be glad you did
---
do you repair the landing pad after you claim the workshop?
---
Don‚Äôt worry, you are not alone in being disappointed and I am glad you are cool and level headed about it and not full on ranting ‚ÄúYOU SHIT ON FRANCHISE KTHXBYE BETHESDA‚Äù 
---
If you're on PC I have a few spare Decontamination Showers that replicated when I moved bases. Still working on my current base design so haven't had to deal with the storage space.
---
Of course.  
---
Whenever you install a mod that uses its own archive you have to add it into the Archive tab in the Fallout76Custom.ini as well as the vanilla archives (the atomic shop items and images for example).
---
I do bother with workshops again, but only because I have Contractor 2 now so I'm no longer putting any of my own resources in. Clearing the enemies first gets you 20 caps, so then I've only lost 5 if it crashes. Usually I sit there poking at the controller every 10 minutes or so while I work or whatever (I work from home). Also, I never EVER have more than one. Then it will definitely crash in no time.
---
Yep they are, tested it while using a Grognaxe in my excavator armour and it was still the Slugger perks that increased the damage
---
Lol you obviously don't know them do you.
---
I'll let you vent instead of explaining.
---
Most sqbs i do she stays grounded for extended periods of time.
---
Losing out on that 1* walking cane  is a bitch.
---
Man I stumbled into that quest last night and I was NOT prepared for it. I was picking up a thing for a Rosie quest last night and I got the key or thing or whatever it was and thought eh, yeah my guns are almost broken and I'm almost out of ammo but hey while I'm here this place has like lvl 14 mole miners so I'll just see how deep it goes, grab some stuff and leave.
---
But then these klaxons went off and a couple of level 150 guys came in and the Uranium Fever mission started and I thought oh well how bad can this be? And oh my god frickin high level glowing legendary mole miners everywhere. And oh my god I almost died so many times  but those guys had my back and I made it through and I picked up a number of admittedly shitty legendary armor pieces and guns.
---
So yeah if you're a level ~150 dude and you ran into a lvl 34 dude wearing excavator armor in the Uranium mines trying his best to take out 3-diamond legendary mole miners with a sniper rifle in closed quarters because that's the only gun he had that wasn't broken, thank you very much. Also I'm sorry if I shot you in the back. Twice.
---
I disagree that the TSE nerf was handled properly or even with care. 
---
I experienced what you‚Äôre talking about (the join in or miss out) experience because there was a guy the other night just standing in front of the clubhouse door killing everything that came out of it in one swing. The worst part is that you can‚Äôt shoot around them either and they almost never miss. If they have a good weapon then they are most likely done with a horde of ghouls in 5-10 seconds. 
---
The TSE and Two shots all behave differently and they absolutely don‚Äôt melt with some guns. For example, my two shot single action, TS gauss rifle, and TSE The Dragon all do different tiers of damage but they all have setbacks. A TSE automatic sub or combat shotgun has the ability to melt because of its capacity to output damage in just a couple of shots or even just one shot. 
---
Look at the hilariously shitty big old machine guns that do 33 damage per bullet and compare the TTK to the one shot sledge. It‚Äôs not thoughtful in the slightest. 
---
I hate this game more every day. The fact that this is needing to be managed by the players is pathetic. 
---
Let me know when you do. I wouldn't put it past the game devs to have it be a little wonky where some stat increases work for it (like armor), but then a perk doesn't. There have been much stranger perk issues in the game already :p.
---
It's too bad I don't play with full groups very often. At rank 2 magnetic personality, a full group would give a whole extra 6 charisma, enough to share a 5-point card if you start with 9 Charisma. That would be very nice.
---
Logged on yesterday and a LVL 151 sold me a TSE lever action rifle for 100 caps. I'm still 7 levels from using it but he/she was nice.
---
PVE games with PVP 10 to do this they balance to PVP cuz everybody's crying about it and it makes PVE not fun this is why you never ever ever ever ever put PVP inside a PVE game unless you can keep the game mechanics Armour weapons abilities all separated which Essence your creating two separate games
---
You are not alone with this, sadly. It's almost always related to a tamed mega sloth.
---
There are a bunch of bug reports like yours, one is my own. Bethesda staff is informed about this bug, all we can do for now is hoping they'll fix it soon.

and a lot more over the last days. 
---
You can, press the three dots in the top right when you are on the subreddit page, not in a post.
---
You can still buy them for relatively cheap as I lost mine when I was looking at a ghoul body inventory and got hit by another ghoul when the body disappeared and the first weapon in my inventory dissapeared with it (all-rise).  I picked one up for I think 1000c at the time before all the duping started full steam, probably cheaper now.
---
Clearly it‚Äôs not punishing enough. 
---
Yup. Tested with my buzz blade and war axe after wondering the same thing a few weeks ago.
---
I drop them outside of vault 76.
---
I live up by the island, quiet place, lil far from town, and not too many squatters, but still open for anyone to help farm 
---
Is there a bunch of low lvls swarming the area? I'm asking because the more people around the more health she gets and the reason I said low lvls is because they seem to hit her once then stand in the shed until the high lvl players kill her. 
---
I'm lvl 168 and don't bother with the queen anymore what's the point if I can't do anything because low lvls are just boosting her health and hiding in sheds 
---
Meant the light machine gun for MG60 (what it looks like anyways). Thanks, just haven‚Äôt had the luck with finding things my friends have and it‚Äôs irritating me!
---
More ppl need to do this.  I've also heard the cash registers, in case there isn't a suitcase, and the "Trader Joe" dead guy outside Vault 76.  I drop ammo and known plans there, since trading them doesn't seem to be a big thing
---
I found mine at the Watoga train station, so make sure you check there as well.
---
Like the bridge by Point Pleasant?? Could be a cool way to open up the westerlands whenever they decide to make that area playable
---
Power Armor Arnold. Thank you for that. 
---
Consider editing your post to include the platform you play on. I'm on PC, NA East and my username is trash-queen
---
Nope you're just an asshole.  Let me explain:
---
You a level 250 player (hypothetical) destroy a level 20 something players CAMP and you think it's balanced because they can just kill you and get their shit back?  
---
I‚Äôd prioritize DR and ER. Rad-x is easily obtainable.
---
I ran into him outside the whitesprings station twice. 
---
And TS by 75% I know still the best combo in my opinion 
---
I would never want lower-level players in my party because they would bring the mob level down
---
I did exactly as op enjoys to a bloated, gangrenous glowing one.  It laid there full plank.  Then it rose to its feet and transformed into a legendary ghoul.  Rinse, repeat of the capin‚Äô
---
Headset.  If you talk to someone in a call center, you can hear them, even if you can hear the other people.
---
From vendors?
---
Ive seen those go for 4-5k on the market
---
How many people show up when you nuke the server? You want armor piercing to mitigate her damage reduction. Also she has explosive resistance but explosive weapons still deal the most. She'll take more damage on the ground. Aim for her lower belly/vagina
---
People stayed there for a year til they got kicked out by the bots, as everyone has said.
---
HOWEVER, a super cool detail I noticed is that the terminal suggests that the Whitesprings manager is the one who started the whole using caps as currency thing. It was her idea to use them as there was an abundance of them after a nuka cola promotion, and she needed a way to ration out the supplies. They were only there for a year and everyone split up after they got kicked out, and it caught on!
---
I don't think so.  Keep a supply of radaway and rad-x and you will be fine.  You can also mod a few pieces of armor with lead lining to help.  I always carry a Hazmat suit or PA for the times I need to briefly enter very high rad areas.
---
I think they‚Äôre going to do it like they did with Fallout 4 and have mods go through approval so they can allow them to run with the fame since it‚Äôs multiplayer.  That also means they can be made available to console players too.  
---
Radiation resistance is the last thing I look at when choosing armor. Well, except weight, but I've got all my points in strength.
---
Do you know if cola nut stacks with party boy to give 6 times the benefit while drinking nuka dark? Or does nuka dark only count as alcohol and not a nuka cola?
---
Not everyone will get it, but the right people will get it. 
---
Does the 4th star do anything other than just adding another star?
---
 its very handy sometimes. My skills involve my low levels taking on entire towns of high level Muties. I do enjoy a good fight and the little toy just ruins that.
---
 Still I like it. Its fun to ride shotgun on Harper's Ferry and keep the trash off Wallace and his customers. That kind of thing is fun.
---
The Morgantown High School gym alone is full of plastic pumpkins, golf balls, bowling pins and a big stack of plastic plates. That one room alone has about 70 pieces of plastic, and if you expore the whole building you typically can leave with 100+ each time
---
Do you clear all mobs or is there a specific place you go to to find the legendary?
---
I'd be more than happy to help transfer items as well in exchange for some help on my characters when needed :) ign: orange\_juice02
---
Or teaming up to launch a nuke or whatever. I hate doing it solo, because I swear I get disconnected half the time after launching it and then never get to even reap the zone after.
---
&gt;dropped his junk and it was 200 lbs of BULKed junk! With that, my excavator armor ended up being free and I walked overencumbered back to my camp.
---
That's cold. If he was in the bog at that low of a level, sure take the loot, but seeing as how he wasn't expecting super strong enemies spawned by a higher level player in a zone made for his...
---
Sound like Uranium Fever has done and got you down...
---
&gt;How important is radiation resistance outside of Nuke zones?
---
It isn't. I never worried about it. Not even once. For the few really irradiated areas you need to traverse for the story, which I think happens only once in the main story progression, just grab a Hazmat Suit.
---
But what of you had friends or family you wanted to play the game with. Doesnt have to be random strangers.
---
Same here, looking for a good trade for these plans!
---
 TIL there is a fountain in the gazebo.  I guess I have never gone in it.
---
Honestly, Scorchbeasts aren't even scary at any point. They don't really do enough damage unless you let them land on you, or you just stand and take their echo blasts. If you try and fight them at a low level, you're just going to waste a lot of resources for no actual benefit.
---
Good point about the caps gain from taking out the enemies, I guess my blind rage at the disconnect/s prevented me from realising that lol. Still, it sucks that in order to use them successfully, you actually have to stand idle in the game for however long just to avoid a crash. I just want to take one and one only, and continue questing and exploring. But yeah, i did the same thing, poked at the controller for about half an hour the third time, before crashing when I tried fast travelling back to my camp.
---
If you are on PC, I can kill you to alleviate that. I won't take the junk and will give back the caps. 
---
I think what this person is saying by "mechanics" is landing the nuke zone just on the edge of prime site luring the queen out the nuke zone so she flys low asf to the ground and lands a lot more
---
This just happened to me with a different weapon.  Maybe I sold or dropped it by accident but I seriously doubt that unless something buggy happened like the menus selecting the wrong item like they sometimes do.  The only way I could think I did it besides a bug would be dropping it by accident while changing perks as R and T are right next to each other.
---
So my 'main' character is level 246 and following the patch last week was bluescreening 4+ times an hour, not just in high traffic areas, wandering the wastes old, opening my stash, mid combat you name it. Tried rebuilding the database and reinstalling - no benefit. 
---
However I did create a new character on the same account, that one is now level 40 and has bluescreened twice (in a week). I'm fully planning to get back to my 'main' account and am waiting patiently for a patch/fix to correct the issue.  Cannot be certain but possibly there is something that was established with the character/gear pre-patch that is now unstable with the main account, the new one was levelled post patch and is not impacted. Just a theory - anyone else tried this?
---
Please expand.  Developers designed the game to have player camp raids as a [feature](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wrecking_Ball)
---
Id like to it balanced. Everything one player losses should be gained by the other. The game is already "taxing" 50% of all caps lost by wanted players.... My game shows 300 cap bounty only 150 caps go to whoever kills me. 
---
Noob question - can you combine starred items? Like could you get two 1* items and combine them to make a 2*? Or is that not a thing?
---
I dont trust other people to let me get a hit, its every man for themselves
---
I just noticed that too. So now grenades stay equipped, but my PA now doesn't equip left leg or right arm AND now empty guns.
---
What kind of loot? 
---
As far as I know, it was fixed awhile ago that loot will not respawn to prevent farming. If you are talking about plans or things in safes, those re-spawn every 20ish hours. 
---
If you see a plan and don't want it, do NOT pick it up, as that spawn location will not spawn another object for 20 hours. If you leave it there and server hop it may spawn another plan... or not, that is up to the RNG gods.
---
That's actually exactly how I talk to my best friends. *shrug*.
---
I feel you two shot explosive was my thing but I just don't like tediousness I don't I don't see the challenge in making the game more tedious for me.
---
will have to see what the Nerf does
---
If you want a high skill build I would suggest a gun slinger there slow firing and requires good aim trying to get all headshots 
---
I got dense robot combat yesterday from Phoenix in watoga 
---
Also I think when she's out the nuke zone she takes more damage or has less health because holy shit she is very weak outside the nuke zone idk if it's a bug but she takes so much damage from your weapons
---
Watoga Emergency Services over and over again
---
First off, where is your base? Is it by the charleston train station by chance? People will destroy that house and the ones by the golf club for reasons.
---
Do caps refresh if you server change?
---
I really think the whole explosive weapon thing is a big mistake. Two shot was bad enough but people are one shot killing groups inside nuke zones before anyone else gets to tag anything.
---
Monster mash in watoga! 3 rounds per event and you get legendary armor after every round. Also get your occasional 3 star legendary ghoul.
---
Yeah it'll help a lot if we know what platform you are on 
---
I came back to the game a few days ago and noticed it is kinda slower now. Maybe I'm wrong, but I've noticed it too.
---
The in-game DoF setting doesn't work at all and the FOV setting only changes the camera FOV, not the model FOV. I posted pictures to show what the FOV settings in the ini actually changes.
---
Sounds like you need to min/max your build more or have a decent team to help dish out dps. After the tse nerf it will only be glass cannon melee build able to take her out with ease.
---
I wish we could have private servers. Other people ruin the experience 99% of the time. I just want to play with my friends, not random douche bags with lame ass names like "hyper420buzz" or "420sixtynine" who run around open mic squealing like dumb fucks.
---
At first when I saw "disease cure (the mire)" I thought maybe you needed different ones for different environments, but now I just go to the forest to craft them because I don't want to take a perk
---
Unfortunately this is working as intended. 
---
I abandoned my VATS build for a few reasons and this was a big one. 
---
I don't run with PA other than in nuke zones but my AP would be gone too fast since sprinting drains more AP in PA. that on top of using VATS and jumping my cores were going too fast. 
---
I could get that core usage perk but I just don't have the room for it.
---
There's that too.
---
Cripple/staggers are the big mechanics that can make her much easier.
---
If she's staggered while on the ground she stays grounded.
---
Cryolator helps alot too.
---
Chain staggers + freeze is where I've seen her land once, regen at 1/2 then not fly till at half again
---
Probably the best build I have seen. Well done, well done indeed. Though I do hope you don't get some ass-hats who are just hatters. 
---
Also, isn't there some robots that spawn at the miner monument?
---
Or you could just tell us since this is the forum for sharing information.
---
Sounds like communism
---
I don't have any data on the level distribution, i.e., what is the chance that a L50+ enemy drops a L35/L40 item.
---
Its different when its your friend.
---
If you look in one of the cabins you will find a dead OoM woman so very plausible. 
---
For patrol duty you have to walk up to the perimeter fence for it to spawn, still only 1 event in 10 server hops or so, so I still agree with you about increasing the frequency.
---
I think it's a 3rd person issue, you'll have to go to 1st person to loot most things.
---
But what about my steak knives!
---
Wow - I'll admit I'd be surprised but not surprised as well if its intended as such.
---
Consoles are how it made it: Unlike PC's, Consoles have extremely limited controls.
---
They needed a button to throw a grenade, and they couldn't just use holding down the trigger(because automatics exist).
---
While using mobile?
---
I'm also looking, favorite gun in 4, want one in 76
---
I always hated melee.  Hated it in Skyrim, hated it in any game.  But in Fallout 76, it really is my favorite way to play.
---
I had that happen recently also. I was away from camp and over encumbered so I couldn't get home fast, so I shot them a message (Xbox) asking what I did to receive such treatment. They reply saying I was in their spot and also was bored. So, I come back with, 'At least you could buy me dinner after you f*** me.' hoping they would leave mats for me to repair my stuff. I get back, 'best response ever!' and we start a conversation. Sadly, I didn't receive recompense because I had to pick up my kids from school. Maybe next time. 
---
Adding the scorched receiver ups your damaged to scorched enemies. Thats it. 
---
I never stealthed and am always a lone wanderer.. shotgun build though
---
Store all your junk in your stash.  Then try again. 
---
I play a pure vats pistol build and I cannot get behind a change like this.  I target different limbs depending on the mob...like legs for robots.  Also depending on range, headshots are not always the best bet.  Up close, I always headshot but at middle or long range legs and arms will be much higher percentage to take out and will drop mobs just as easy.
---
For example- If I just took out a charging close range mutant with a high percentage or crit headshot, I would not want my gunfu to switch to the ranged mobs head.  That would take me out of my normal sequence.  Starting in the torso takes you one mouse scroll to either head, then arms, or torso then legs.  
---
Yeah been looking for this one as well. I've only found it 2 times.
---
I find born survivor (and auto stim armor) to be pretty bad with a bloodied build. You wind up using a stim basically every time you take a single point if damage, and as a result, burn through them way too fast.
---
Will do. What's the point of the suggestion flair if they're all supposed to go under one post. Not trying to sound like a sick, I'm genuinely curious
---
I thought Fallout was more like an RPG, but you just made it into pure, undiluted horror.
---
Yes, I just did it.
---
And strangely enough, you can use Optimized Servos to help your jetpack or VATS.  Tying all these to AP directly is the simplest way to code this into the game.
---
I have done now and its worked wonder why thats a thing?
---
What platform are you on? I am on X-Box One.
---
 I have 3 chars with the one i have in play at level 38 now. I do know how this game works. How could my level 28 trader Jenny Jones take down entire towns of Muties with level 68 Overlords as the bosses if we did not know how rifles work.
---
 "I come from Stalker and all games are easy for me." ;)
---
With how fast it works with my lever action that has faster reload I would say it stacks and works just fine. It also makes it insanely quick if you have the heavy gun reload. On it's own it is barely noticable. 
---
Could not disagree more
---
They removed a ton of roleplaying elements and asked players to replace them.
---
People are playing as raiders. The game even has you join the raiders
---
I would say they should go the other way, when someone destroys your wall, they should get a small amount of wood, destroy your decon shower and they get flux etc. That way they can rp as raiders and if you kill them, you can use the material to repair
---
Yeah... for sure.   
---
Someone suggested that overlapping nukes should made that zone exponentially harder... With 3 nukes on the same spot bringing about the game's apex challenge. I've been musing about it. On the one hand, it's a lot more work. On the other, if the challenge was truly "legendary" then I'd say it was worth doing
---
Bags despawn faster than in game containers in my experience. And not everyone travels to 76. I use the cache in flatwoods because i always see people at that vendor. 
---
If you‚Äôre within the same level range then sure, your weapons might be equal and you can call it pvp. But what does a player gain from being level 168, one shotting me (a lowly level 10) and then tracking me down on the map when I respawn to kill me over and over? Just take the junk I drop when I died, destroy my camp, and leave me alone. At that point you‚Äôre not gaining anything from me and I cannot fight back with my level 5-10 weapons. I don‚Äôt see the fun in trying to engage people who you know stand no chance. I had no option but to leave the server, I literally could not play the game.
---
I found a Two-Shot black powder with increased ADS damage on my gunslinger. Was only level 20 but that thing was a palm nuke. 
---
You cant stop duping and exploits unfortunately. Ever changing the game like nerfing tse and constantly making the player build change is the only way in my opinion. I just like buying off of other players and to be honest if you strive for the best stuff...25k gets you nowhere. I dont want a mule account for caps. I just would like to see the limit raised a bit. I grind in flipping legendary loot and doing the 1400 cap daily run. 25k is hit in a cpl days without any exploits 
---
Consoles have been doing text chat since at the very least dreamcast, I used to have a keyboard for my dreamcast playing PSO. It is really nothing new.
---
Comparing .50 to .308 for ammo crafting costs:
---
5 powder, 8 lead, 12 steel for 
---
(12 \* 1.8) + ((12 \* 1.8) \* .3) = 
---
22 + 7 (rounding up) = 29 rounds
---
15 powder, 24 lead, 36 steel for 87   .308 rounds
---
vs
---
12 powder, 10 lead, 40 steel for
---
(100 \* 1.8) + ((100 \* 1.8) \* .3) =
---
180 + 54 = 234   .50 rounds
---
234 / 87 = \~2.69
---
40 powder, 64.5 lead, 96.8 steel for approximately the same amount of rounds. 
---
This is excluding the fact that each of these .50 rounds are worth several .308 in DMG.
---
It's cool that you think you are a whiz at FO76 farming, but this is indeed prohibitively expensive for the ammo consumption rate of the LMG.
---
Nah theyre still gonna be the best weapons in the game even after the nerf
---
I guess that is part of my point though....? The tasks are *so* meaningless and unfulfilling AND additionally they are disconnected from their reward...I log in and do them, but I'm not max level yet...kinda think they will feel *even more* like a chore when I get there.
---
Other games have achievements that give unique rewards like player titles or access to exclusive faction-based items, etc. for endgame grinding. ESO in my given example has a compelling reward you are actively working toward and you can see that you're progressing towards it every day you log in regardless of level.
---
The lack of compelling Atom shop items is def a part of the problem, but I think atoms exclusively as in-game daily rewards is also an issue as it provides very little variety or flavor....most memorable daily I've done is take a picture wearing only a hat. :(
---
I also think it is a big miss that they don't have the ability (so far as I can tell???) to gift stuff! I would have loved to bought my bf an atom shop item as an extra little birthday thing sent from my account.
---
With how lack luster pvp is people get bored
---
It seems to have been bugged slightly with the last update. All events in my opinion have.   
---
Day after update I was after fusion gen as well, it seemed like 1/3 or 1/4 times I got to Monongah it would start. I did eventually get the plans. 
---
Last night I went to fast travel to a Super Mutant horde as I've never tried it, by the time I got there the event had ended (or potentially long before and map never updated). 
---
Happened to me multiple times on Saturday.  I essentially had to restart the game, let it load in, then let it sit there for an extra 5 minutes or so to make sure everything loaded in before moving/looking at pip boy/breathing too hard/etc.
---
Add me if you don‚Äôt mind a chick playing with you, PSN: liversss. Level 65 shotgun build, looking to launch a nuke tonight or very soon 
---
Oki dokis.
---
I guess.
---
I bet you don't like the idea that pushing a vehicles rpm to go fast uses more fuel too.
---
I thought it was for suggestions to the game.  Things like "Could we lock items so we don't scrap or sell them" or "How about a buy back tab at the vendors".
---
Morgantown also spawns glowing ones when nuked, not as many as whitespring or monongah when they spawn there. But always good to have a change of scenery.
---
I'd honestly take separate perk cards for increasing stash limit. Obviously there would be the potential to end up overweight doing this but I think as long as you can't remove the card if you're over the weight it would be at without it you should be fine. 
---
Reported. Im tired of argueing with the white knights on this sub. 
---
Pvp is part of the game. Low levels are buffed like crazy.  Im level 100 ish and was killed by a level 7 player the other day. I had a bounty and the dude killed me before i could see where he was shooting from. Only took a few shots to get me.
---
Again. Im reporting you for incivility. All the pve players think they own this game. So entitled. Cant even have civil conversation with people who want a more pvp centric experience. You guys are in denial of the mechanics of this game. Its a shame you guys act this way. You cant opt out of a game feature and expect others to opt out also. 
---
Thanks again for being rude. 
---
I always try to leave at the very least a stash, tinker's workbench, cooking station and purifier out in the open for this reason. I get why people lock up doors on the first level (so that enemies don't waltz right in) but everything else its like pfft whatever, pick my plants, grab the water, and anything in the extractor. (as an afterthought I might replace the tinker's for a chemistry station, I prefer the tinker's workbench for bulking but chem station might make more sense to be next to the extractor)
---
For me the game is running okay, but whenever I enter Charleston the game freezes for a few minutes or outright crashes, this started after the last patch...
---
I figured as much, when i experienced the bug myself, i was overweight :S
---
Same here. I played so much I had my settlement with a huge barn to show off everything I had collected. Every weapon, every armour, every piece of clothing and every Power Armour.
---
Just so we‚Äôre clear, Power Armor is only superior to regular armor if you‚Äôve got bad armor or need the rad resist.
---
I mean, I‚Äôve got twice as much damage and waaaay more defense in regular armor. The only use for power armor is nuke zones
---
I so remember this! Yeah I'll sign up and post as soon as my husband finishes playing. I stay home with the kids and he's off today, so he gets first dibs on the Xbox.
---
Ok so the stars basically just reflect how many legendary mods are on the gun.
---
Bethesda has only provided a very ambiguous statement on the use of QoL mods. I understand not wanting to take the risk, but it would be more correct to say it *might* be considered hacking the game than to state it as a hard fact. 
---
A bug with the way it tries to consume components when split between Stash and Inventory it seems.
---
Clear all mobs.   West tek has 1-2 3*.  Ive gotten up to 4 3* on a alt-f4 respawn at west tek.  
---
Harpers pretty much the same.  1-2 3*.  Ive gotten up to 4 show up.   Sometimes they are low levels.  
---
96 since 20th November..
---
Why should I? Why should I carry another 20lb non legendry rifle just so I can help some useless low levels, who I'll probably never see again after I leave the world.
---
XBox?
---
Or hell. Zero. Things you sell to vendors can be accessed by other players, so at least they'd be in an available location that's likely to be checked. 
---
Oooo no!  I can't have an opinion or I'm uncivil.  Whatever shall I do?
---
To be fair, that could just be because they're not populated yet and would be when DLC comes. But based on what lore I've seen from one of the other Vaults, which exploded basically and caused The Mire to be The Mire, they will probably be dead. 
---
Ive had this. I feel so guttered when it happens.
---
Nice! My little hand cannon one shots pretty much everything short of a scorchbeast.
---
LMAO 
---
What level are you? If you're lower/higher I can run you/you can run me through and level us up to 15 and fast travel to watoga or harpers ferry and get us some plans?
---
Mistress of mysteries veil protects while not giving the penalty. That and the atom store one are the only ones i know that dont
---
Eh, sometimes when crafting or cooking it might forget you have the required resources. At least early on in the game it would tell me I didn't have any wood to make boiled water; I would run over to check my stash, see that I had enough wood, then retry and it usually worked.
---
aye that's exactly what I suggested. Construction mode is same as build mode. If we can place them as statics (think: succulents) and have an obvious limit so as to not hurt other people's performance, this will work perfectly!
---
Hopefully that is safe. If they started banning everyone using mods they will get a lot more bad press. So hopefully they look at the mods you use.
---
Yeah, it's insanely frustrating, especially when it's stuff you really need.
---
Yea definitely seems like it
---
Level up fast man, they want to nerf those by the next update. 
---
Level 78
---
Figured I would mention there is a mod for global text chat available on PC. Have been using it for a while and could always use more people on it chatting. Sad a modder can add this feature in in their spare time and Bethesda still hasn't but what can yah do?
---
Go for a fun build, over an endgame build.  Just hit 75 with my 15 luck vats pistol build. Just about any playstyle is completely viable for 99% of the game.
---
Unpopular opinion. But I'm for PvP and competition. I run unarmed and run over and smack first on the glowing.
---
I feel there's no etiquette in the game in general. Whitespring is a TSE fest as is, why would this be different.
---
It is not intentional, but if I don't kill it, or hit, the others players aren't going to wait for me to get a hit on it.
---
This event won't change. No one in this game is going to hold hands across the wasteland. 
---
Basically, there's no participation trophies. 
---
Win or lose.
---
Ask yourself. Who would you rather be, the person with the gun pointed at them, or the person holding the gun.
---
Scrapped for steel.
---
Pistol perks will work fine as long as you don't mod it into a rifle. Unfortunately energy weapons still break faster than the Flash runs a mile so level 5 gunsmith is mandatory at all times.
---
I've managed to get one god roll drop and a bunch of average stuff at level 106
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a cabin sitting atop a hill kind of alone and not connected to any other cabins or cottages and it‚Äôs pretty dark inside 
---
Its more like your audio system consuming more fuel as you turn the volume up in the case of VATS.
---
You want disease cures I‚Äôve got 50 if you are on Xbox I‚Äôll give you 35. 
---
I want to say someone made a PSA post about always checking the train station containers.
---
I ended up handing mine off to some random low level once i hit 50, i didnt wanna keep using it as a crutch, because while the damage was good, it was only that good when both shots connected.

I haven't gone so far as uninstall, but I hear what you're saying 100%.

Myself, I log in each day and check the atom shop to see if there's anything I 'need' to have. Which thus far there hasn't been unfortunately. 
---
Yeah! Honestly the ‚ÄúHey new guys come help yourself to free purified water and crops‚Äù would really be useful. I know a lot of higher levels like helping out the new vault dwellers. 
---
Gunslinger perks will work for the pistol. 
---
If you change the stock and make it a rifle then you'll need rifleman perks. 
---
Unfortunately the energy weapon degradation is still really bad, so that 2 shot might be decent damage-wise, but is going to break roughly twice as fast. 
---
I have a furious ultracaite laser pistol I am holding onto in hopes of a buff. 
---
I'd just mod it to the lightest weight possible and hold onto it if you want to keep it. 
---
So your logic is that they are not "His" gouhls but they are "yours". I hate this bull shit logic. I can build wherever I want. You can also destroy it however you want. 
---
Don't tell players how to play this game because you don't like it. AND STOP WHINING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE. 
---
Thank you! I have lvl 5 gunsmith I just wasn't sure if any of the perks worked for energy weapons aswell, it says ballistics on them so it makes it seem as though they only work for non energy weapons
---
Rolled 100 times, below are the drops i would keep
---
Roll #25 - 3\* Mutant Combat Armor (Increase AP, 20% reduced junk weight)
---
Roll #39 - 2\* TSE Submachine Gun
---
Roll #96 - 3\* Ghoul Slayer's Black Powder Pistol (+10% damage while aiming, -90% weight)
---
PS4?
---
Nope. Depends on your build.
---
I run a Shotgunner who uses no vats or no stealth. There is zero benefit for me to use NA or PA. I've tried every set, PA feels tankier and can do end game with no hassles like chugging radaway/nukagrapes/radshields.
---
I dont use my tse for that event but i let anyone that comes in with one know that i will equip it  and will stand of front of them while they shoot so they self explode if its gotta be that way. 
---
I just want chat bubbles visible in the local area.

Server-wide chat would inevitably be taken up by spam.

---
This is exactly what I do if I get burned out or stressed over a game, especially those that have issues every damn update...
---
Sadly, too many people need to shit in the bed and throw a tantrum over stuff like that, so it's refreshing to see something like this.

The ability of servers to perform efficient and fast intra-communication is part of their MO, man.  If in one specific location there was 100 physical servers, each with 100 virtual machines/worlds, each with 24 players, that's still only 240,000 players, and each server would only have to perform, at worst, a search through a 2,400 item lookup, assuming it just stored current players.  So, even if a crap ton of players were, at all times, logging in and out, it probably wouldn't affect server performance.  
---
And I wasn't saying that holding the position of a d/c'd player causes stress/strain.  It's other servers receiving more player traffic as the result of any one server temporarily misreporting the number of players it likely thinks it will retain.  
---
As an easy example, two servers, each with the capacity to house 15 players, but each currently holds 10.  On server 1, two players are either d/c'd or logged off.  That server holds open those two slots for five minutes, but those players don't rejoin.  Within that same five minutes, the servers collectively get a request for 2 more players in a group.  At current, both servers read as having 10 players, so it doesn't technically matter where the group goes, but it randomly goes to server 2.  Once server 1's five minute wait is up, the server load is actually eight vs twelve.  Server 2 has 50% more player traffic because of a timer.  
---
The  potential for instability is in how many concurrent timers across all worlds and servers there are, misrepresenting expected populations and inadvertently sending an excess amount of traffic, through cumulative error, to one or more servers over time.  
---
That's not an issue currently, because player traffic among servers is accurately reported without any clauses that affect count accuracy.  All I was saying is that, dependent upon a number of those variables, it may or may not even be a problem.  I was just throwing out an example of an issue they might expect to encounter, as to why they haven't said anything about it, yet.  
---
I also just want to state that Bethesda doesn't have a warehouse somewhere with their own servers, they probably use Amazon services of some kind, which means they're limited in how they can setup a dedicated traffic managing server as you described.  Not that I think it's even necessary.  
---
As far as  server instability, it doesn't have to affect the entire server to be an instability.  For instance, I get d/c'd frequently and experience crashes/freezing a lot when travelling to Charleston on the map.  That's not likely causing anyone problems when it happens, but the server is experiencing an instability and booting me.  Same in Hemlock Holes.  I experience freezing and d'c in SBQ fights too, and notice whole groups of other players undergoing similar troubles.  That's just Bethesda's system presenting bugs that haven't been addressed yet.  Dupers def cause crashes, but I'd bet those are separate issues.  
---
Anyway, I still think we can both agree that, regardless of how it gets done, Bethesda needs to make it happen.
---
Regarding slide 30, having to fight a litteral swarm of scorched has been my big wish for this game. Show me this is a real plague! Fighting 6 scorched at a time doesn't emphasis that the scorch is a terrible disease affecting the whole region. 
---
No, it wouldn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a passive animal so it won‚Äôt if you tame it. 
---
I‚Äôll do what I want you beautiful cupcake deserving piece of human loving happiness spreader. Eat my upvotes do gooder!
---
This would be cool too
---
No, was not happy I bought it expecting to do different weapons
---
Where at exactly 
---
I realize this was more a rant than an argument. What I‚Äôm trying to say is there is a difference between pvp and griefing.
---
Explain the existance of the wrecking ball perk. 
---
Explain the 6,000+ caps/week worth of bulk junk ive made raiding camps. 
---
"The 'raider element' will be other human palyers" - Todd Howard
---
Seems like its a lucrative and intentional part of the game to me. Im going to keep raiding. Thanks for your incorrect opinion, but i think i just proved you wrong.
---
Exactly
---
Drain has been tied to AP drain since fo4. It's just a balance thing.
---
Checking for vats targets should not matter at all since your aren't using AP.
---
If I‚Äôm grinding out Whitesprings this is exactly what I do.  Run in, kneecap all the ghouls and let the other players making the rounds finish them off so they can get a tag in also.   Plus, it just looks awesome seeing 15+ ghouls all scattered about pathetically on the ground.  
---
My favorite thing to do is to kneecap the Glowing Deathclaw that usually spawns in the center of Whitesprings.  It looks so sad laying there, unable to move. 
---
My guess is since it's a video link instead of just text describing it it goes against the text only post rule
---
I am not your content to be raided and only because you can do something, does not make it better. Go play ARK  or other full loot games. 
---
if enabling pacifist would mean to never be able to claim a workshop but would make my camp safe, i would gladly take that trade off.
---
When your flair is 'Scorched', I don't know if you're low-key making an argument in favor of hive mind.
---
I just stopped playing a few days ago. Don‚Äôt plan on returning until there‚Äôs new content and it least more bugs are fixed. I want to do PVP on fallout, but it‚Äôs a god damn mess with TSE level 300 running around 1 shotting me.
---
Just a bit higher than me, I've got the flu so I'm home, if you're level 15-45 you can find it randomly at watoga and harpers ferry(like metal walls and stuff) if you wanna run me through(ie, let me get a shot in and get the XP til I'm 15 and fast travel around/server jump.  I've got tons of diluted stims, if I can give you some from my main, trade to me when I hop on, and run through some easy areas really quick.
---
I use Dvorak. Don't play much on PCs these days, but when I did, I would usually have to switch back to QWERTY for games, or spend half an hour re-mapping every key and hope I remembered where they were.

You can try this but I'm not too sure if it will fix your problem.

Yeah it‚Äôs pretty touchy to do that I always had my TSE on me but I knew all my weapons would 1 shot him so I just kept bashing him until everyone hit him 
---
Never swear in text especially on XBOX, you will get banned quickly .. also assume Xbox support will read it so reply appropriately right or wrong, they could of not you banned for 1 week, fyi
---
Dickbags will be dickbags, nothing you can do .. get some chameleon armour so when you not actively doing stuff in your camp, couch and you will go off the map. Also keep an eye on the map for people heading your direction ..
---
Same thing happened to me, they did quite a lot of damage, of course make sure you remember their name, block, report and share their GT, I will be more than willing to give 2 more bad reports, let's get these guys reputation down.
---
There's some incredibly selfish or ignorant people farming this event.

You're right, I'm actually far more respectful to complete strangers.

I had that issue making a handmade rifle. All ingredients, couldnt make it, turns out later i look at it slowly and it tells me i needed Gunsmith perk lvl 3. Just covering all the bases, you know.
---
Didn't see it mentioned, but using a hunting rifle with the perception perk focused fire gives you a really good method to cripple enemies
---
If Powering Up events had guaranteed legendaries (depending on area and enemy levels) this would be exactly the kind of Public Event I was expecting from 76.  Those multiple stages and (tedious) tasks accommodate multiple players just nicely and completely repairing all the optional parts could cause ranked legendaries to spawn giving more incentives to do so.
---
Not sure. I'll test when I get home. 
---
While they are at it, make right click backout of VATS. I'm tired of accidentally opening the pip boy in the heat of battle.
---
I rlly believe that it was cut for the simple fact that they didnt have enough time with the huge patch being worked on and the ones before.
---
What about Alt-f4?
---
If you‚Äôre on the PS4. I am down to play with friendly people who just want to hang out and do random stuff.
---
I agree. A simple terms of service adjustment would solve that problem. ‚ÄúNo soliciting of sexual encounters, use of foul language, etc‚Äù
---
I was thinking about this earlier. Not just perk loadouts, but armor as well. To be able to swap from a melee build  to lockpicking/hacking build and then to a sniper build from your favorites wheel would be game changing. 
---
There‚Äôs also a clean gas mask someone mentioned the last time this came up. No penalty supposedly. I‚Äôve not seen it though.
---
Yeah this bug became VERY apparent after the last patch.
---
I could use a few Chuck Norris jokes...
---
I have Strength and Intelligence at 15. +40% to heavy weapons and melee weapons with the Heavy Gunner &amp; Slugger cards stacked. I also have Gunsmith and Makeshift Warrior maxed. What's a Glass Cannon?
---
Update. The Glassed Cavern has 5 lootable Scorched Fog Crawler. They each drop about 4 fiber optics each. And there are a few dead turrets. So you can get about 20 fiber optics each run. 
---
Can confirm, have also had this happen. 
---
The public statements they have made say they won't support mod creation or use for about a year. The TOS regarding mod creation and use requires creation of said mods only through their liscenced editing tool.  They have not yet made these available. 
---
The concern they have with current mod use is,  because you are not playing alone, any users mods can contain intentional or accidental code that impacts other users on the server. They stated when they do allow them, it will be on private servers. 
---
Spamming explosives near people to make their games crash? Really not cool. Hope everyone who does this gets caught and perma-banned.
---
I haven't had any disconnects until the last update. Now every time I play, I disconnect every twenty minutes at least. What the fuck. I supported this game and rode through the waves and now I can't even play.
---
For me, taking off my targeting HUD on the X01 fixed it for me. Went from 60+ blue screens in 3 days, to zero in the last 4. That fixed it for my friend, too. 
---
Well if someone wants to pay 40-60 bucks to spam and get banned, let them! More money for our devs to crank out content. Lol
---
Dude what are you talking about? It's already rng.  Quit hating to hate. And what you said makes no sense.
---
You could disassemble the stored camp into parts and rebuild from the blueprints. Most camps can be placed without an issue as long as the area is flat enough for it.
---
Haven't seen a core in fusion Gen since last patch.  At this point I just hit Line on the Sand for a couple, it seems to consistently start.

And Ultracite, and Raider.

Tesla arc and flamer you get from free states quest and radiation emitter you get from Graham.
---
Yea I usually am standing behind her and aiming at her ass when she's on the ground. Where do I get armor piercing ammo? Never seen that around. Usually when I launch on her I get a handful of level 40-80 players showing up, and I feel like most of the time I'm the only one shooting at her.
---
Damn. Rolled 30 times. Didnt see a 2 or a 3 star legendary item.
---
Are they really THIS rare?! God damn.
---
(Out of those 30 rolls.. I did only get two 3 star enemies and about six 2 star enemies)
---
It just works 
---
what an arbitrary reason to quit...
---
Seriously, am I supposed to do anything with them? I usually drop them. I think the only legendary worth using that I‚Äôve ever had is from a quest. 
---
Am I missing something?
---
So...I agree with you. 100%. The problem? You and I got into it before. I apologize to you for what I said, though it wasn‚Äôt to you directly. However, I can‚Äôt really accept this post fully because I‚Äôm concerned if you yourself fully understand what you‚Äôre saying.
---
All I‚Äôm asking is that you listen to your own advice and understand all of us could start being better. It isn‚Äôt just those you‚Äôve spoken to personally.
---
There‚Äôs a distinct difference, on a deeply philosophical level, between the experience of engaging in this way with AI /programming, and engaging in this way with sentient human players. I may become frustrated with AI ghouls and Raiders in FO4 but I‚Äôm unlikely to take it personally. With another consciousness in play I can‚Äôt help but take it personally, especially when I am deliberately avoiding such action myself‚Äîit ceases to be a game and becomes something like virtual fighting or mischief by proxy when a passive player is forced to engage or to suffer the consequences of unilateral malice. 
---
It would be pretty easy to suspend terminal/broadcast privileges.  
---
Am I the only one seeing a flaming broken skull shape in the blast?
---
But, yeah Artillery for the Win!
---
Yea this is exactly what happens. I'm out there shooting at her non-stop until she comes to the ground, and then everybody runs out of the shed to hit her, rinse and repeat. I have no way of choosing who goes into this with me, so whoever shows up shows up. I'm aware of the damage scaling, but what am I supposed to do?
---
Show is the rest of the dirt track, they is the back side of the building which is the default building, what is actually on the dirt track itself, once you take it over, you can scrap what has been built but obviously not the building you showing us .. 
---
Level 40 something and haven't gotten close to that yet, guess I need to start farming or something lol
---
It's not a type of ammo but can come from either a perk, weapon mod, or legendary roll
---
Improving the max condition (which high INT does do, although it seems to still have an RNG element to it) means that although you won't get an even-higher resistance than before, you'll keep your extra condition (and its associated bonus resistance) longer.
---
Just got it at the Grafton vendor, good luck.
---
That's basically what I avoid Whitesprings all together during nuke zones. I'm over the big dick tse challenge. I just use MY TSE to blow the bodies away so they can't loot lmao 
---
Many thanks friend of friends
---
Interesting. Why not re-map every key? You remember the keys by "feeling" where they should be in keeping them consistent between games. Or you stopped re-mapping because of games that (wrongly) display the corresponding QWERTY key? 
---
Guessing you don't actually play? If you kill someone without them "accepting" pvp, or if you damage someone's camp or try to steal from a locked container at another player's workshop you get wanted status. You get a red icon with your bounty amount on the Map and then every other player is invisible to you on the map. 
---
Enclave good :(
---
No it‚Äôs where if you deposit items too quickly the server gets confused and list things that aren‚Äôt meant to be deposited. If you then go a deposit those items they will get lost for good. 
---
Sort by weight (press q until it shows WT).
---
My husband was getting onto me about this saying I wasnt giving others a chance, so I tried for a low weapon to share and got killed and then someone looted my bag and left me with only a yarn. I had a lot of ballistic fiber I really needed that someone else is now blessed with. 
---
Okay so the Incisor perk card goes up to ignore 75% of targets armor. Does the SBQ wear armor? Or does this just apply to her damage resistance?
---
Pretty sure I didn't sell it.  Gimme your SN and I'll look for you when I get on.  Mines the same as here
---
Ah, nuked areas really have a lovely color scheme. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/pX4vi4r.png) is one I took, it's a pretty funny event. 
---
You realize that you are *telling* me that i need to opt out of a game feature. Be mad at the devs for making the game this way. Im just playing within the rules of the game bro. Gatekeep much? 
---
How bout we just play the game as it is. If you dont like it, you can go play ARK.
---
Camp raids are part of the game. My favorite part. All i do is pvp, fund pvp, grind for pvp gear. I love it. 
---
Todd literally said other players are the content. You are my content.  My favorite content.  Yum yum yum in my tum tum tum  i love this content. 
---
What about straight jackets. 44 caps a pop when trading with a vendor. What's that all about ?
---
The game wasn't liked because it launched in a pre-alpha state. Lets not do conspiracy theories, the simplest answer is usually the correct one.
---
Enclave no good. Enclave bad.
---
You followed the story, right? Enclave is the reason everyone is dead.
---
I agree. Every single ‚ÄúFallout NEEDS this!‚Äù post. No. No it doesn‚Äôt. 
---
Right it applies to her damage resistance
---
I find with melee you need to be at 800dmg plus to be taking noticeable chunks out of her health. You get to 1500dmg and your doing sizeable hits. Heavy guns are a bit under powered without tse. Commando vats builds are much more effective. Another tip is to hit her with a armor penetration syringer.
---
Eh. Maybe I'll give it a whirl sometime. Thanks for the advice. 
---
It couldnt get a loan?
---
;)
---
See ya in about four hours or so when you realized you've overreacted!
---
Jokes aside, it took you three months to accumulate 25k. Do you really need more right now? Is there something for 50k you're saving up for? Why not spend some on some rare plans, buy something from r/market76 or r/fo76bazaar, or whatever until they work it out?
---
I personally like the limit (at least until they 100% end duping. I'm not interested in dealing with millions of caps from colas ruining the economy) currently. This is neither a single player game nor a traditional Fallout item and money collection simulator. It's a hybrid which heavily involves survival.
---
Send a video to Bethesda of you surviving in the wilderness alone while carrying around 30 thousand bottle caps *and* the items required to survive, and I'm sure they'll update the limit. Also post the link here; I'm curious.
---
Why do you need over 25000 caps?
---
I agree. But this post will get hate just because
---
I do not agree.
---
Sure it is not nice that your Camp got destroyed.
---
But thats just the way the cookie crumbles. Get over it.
---
It‚Äôs maddening that people here are not understanding what you‚Äôre saying.
---
Look at it this way, people.
---
There are two identical cars parked in front if you. Let‚Äôs say they‚Äôre Chevy Cameros. They‚Äôre both the same year, model, and color. They‚Äôre in perfect condition.
---
Except they‚Äôre not. One was built by a player with high intelligence, and all the body paneling is metal. The other one was built by someone with lower intelligence, and the body paneling is fiberglass. They‚Äôre both in ‚Äúmax condition‚Äù, but will take damage differently because the fundamentally health is different. 
---
Even at ‚Äú200%‚Äù, the health is fundamentally different. Double-thick metal and double thick fiberglass are still not the same. Higher intelligence crafted items are different than lower, regardless of perks. Intelligence is NOT useless, and people don‚Äôt get that.
---
Those came out three years to a decade ago and I've already played them for hundreds of hours. Just create a damn PvE server. 
---
If you are on PS4, can I have those caps? Will sell you ammo for them. Also if you want to give me the gear and stuff you won't be using I'll hand it out to newer players I run into.
---
Sorry this bug ruined the game for you, but your departure can at least make other players happier.
---
RemindME! 2 weeks
---
Not really. All i wish for is a feature to tune people like you out. I would gladly leave you a server full of raiders raiding each other. Or simply stop playing Fallout if that is the only way to avoid people like you.

Once i was able to have enough ammo to feel comfortable, i stashed all my junk, refused to use a single stimpack and then started running to map markers in the mire and ash heap. If i died i died, id just respawn but i filled in a large bit of the map that way and leveled up some too. But it cost me nothing to do it that way. 
---
That won't work as you have to repair it before you store it .. anyway not an ideal option either way.
---
for some reason that makes me think of Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind
---
Griefing? Is this a building server in Minecraft or FO76? Just as FO4 had super mutants and raiders attacking your settlements FO76 has players doing the same. Everyone's tring to survive in the wasteland and people attacking camps and screwing each other over is perfectly normal.
---
Good bot
---
I can't say I have thrown many grenades on accident, but more often I have the opposite problem: when I *do* want to throw a grenade, I long-press the button and it doesn't properly register (and yes I do have grenades equipped when this happens, because it will work immediately after if I try again). Different symptom of the same problem though.
---
There's another reason I don't like that mapping: The required long-press doesn't let you change how hard you throw at all. In other games you can tap the button if you want to just drop the throwable item at your feet, or hold to throw max distance. In fo76 you only have angle to modulate and I'm often throwing way over if it's open terrain.

ENCLAVE GOOD

Enforcer turns deathclaw encounters into... Ezmode. 
---
&gt;They should understand this is a simple decline to their offer and not an instigation to battle... 
---
You've just done it yourself. Unless that was on purpose as a joke anyway.
---
The same reason you want to be a millionaire.
---
You may not need the money, but it is very satisfying to have it nonetheless.
---
Basically steal everything from RoS's loot system. It turned the worst loot system into one of the best.
---
I agree that this would be great, also great would be an icon to show you already know it.  By the way, there is a mod that does mark known plans/recipes.
---
No, but it‚Äôs exactly what I hear myself saying to them. 
---
What system are you on? I have heard PS4s and maybe even Xbones have to uninstall, clear their *cache*, then reinstall. 
---
Also, do you use PA with Targeting HUD? That seems to be an issue as well. 
---
 I try and get all my friends into one server or post in a community until I get enough high lvls to basically fill a server

---
What? I remember spamming a legendary one with a two shot gatling gun for ages and it kept on burrowing away. I was using the perk that gave a 12% cripple chance per shot, between it being a gatling gun and two shot there's no way a leg wouldn't have crippled by then. Idk, the only other explanation I can find is that I forgot to put the perk on
---
Should‚Äôve used your Fartblaster. 
---
Seriously tho, I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. 
---
Do you mod? I'm not asking or accusing you of cheating, I'm just asking if you use mods in the game. I'm seeing a lot of people (myself included) with a high amount of disconnects and it appears that they all use at least one mod.
---
It drives me nuts that this game has an observatory, crashed space station, alien blaster and blaster rounds in 4 different locations and a flatwoods monster and not a single quest or story tying it all together. Its all right there! I could have written a quest storyline in half an hour that could have made a great adventure. Just wasted potential. 
---
And who are you to say it was in that state I've played since beta and its was in a playable state at release 
---
Is it bad that am trying to do a speed test right now on my browser keeps timing out when trying to.connect, all other devices in the house seems to be connecting just fine.
---
Oh yeah am at 12.8% now, thinking i might bee to far from the modem.
---
Amen brother or sister 
---
I'm guilty as well, but that doesnt make the message any less valueble. 
---
I am going to be a devil's advocate here. Several of you are complaining that someones game play decision is impacting me so they shouldn't do it.  You are effectively asking them to impact their game play choices to meet your needs.  
---
And do not give me that bs argument that it impacts more than just you. That is just a convenience you are using to help justify your position.  You do not care about others. If you did, you would see their side of it as well. 
---
As others have pointed out, there is a system in the game that allows you to deal with the problem.  Destroy the base and take the consequences. Or here is another thought, find somewhere else to farm
---
I don't need any caps really. I have more than enough of everything to play the game at the highest levels but there is just no incentive to play anymore. Honestly the vast majority of caps I have spent were wasted on plans I already had and a bug that would sell my primary legendary weapon instead of the stack of grenades I had selected.
---
Doh! I thought (since FO3) that for a power attack you had to hold the key down to build up the strength of the attack and TIL it just takes a quick tap.  As they say in the Wayfare commericals, "Gamechanger!"
---
Just let me know when I can use energy guns without them breaking within minutes.
---
They really aren't a chore because they are usually are so quick. The only one that is a chore is the level up one. That one is the worse because you need to play for a while at higher levels. The rest are so quick at higher levels that you do feel pretty good when you're able to do the other 4 in 30 seconds.  They might add the player titles and faction based items when they add clans. Though that's a long ways off probably. I really don't remember ESO daily rewards though I stopped playing a couple years ago. The atoms are also involved in the weekly challenges, which I think provides more variety, as they typically take several times longer to complete. i think that the lack of gifting ability is to prevent people from selling earned atoms for cash, but that's just a guess. 
---
you don't seem to understand. I can't recall a single game that randomly deletes items from your inventory. that's so broken one would assume it's intended, that's how bad it is.
---
no matter what you say you can't possibly justify this bug.
---
I don't know why but I always creeps me out when it's an assaultron doing it. I had one follow me across half watoga once.  Worst part was it was invisible but I can hear it.
---
lol
---
Mine is glitched, so I have a 475 carry max, until I exit the suit. 
---
I wish it was. 
---
On a related note, I recently destroyed a guy's "Scrap n' Go," which featured stairs up to a plainly visible crafting area, but immediately at the top of the stairs the floor was open, leading to a player-killing trap below. I racked up a solid bounty and a good few deaths before the guy hurled some insults at me and then rage quit. Worth it.
---
The old zip lips signal would work for that.
---
Game has stupid physics where if it‚Äôs a gun with a long animation to get the gun out it‚Äôll fire too early and always miss the first shot unless you wait a little
---
Cya 
---
I mean, you have a mic, you can say that same sentence. People who take the time to actually talk back always get a better social response. Doesn't need to be a full convo.
---
Don't be afraid to use it. Just give a mumble into the mic. You can hear it in someones voice when they're in "I'm sitting at my desk doing things alone right now" mode. It's not cold, it's just like, oh, doing his thing, cool.
---
I'm well aware why we aren't able to drop and move around objects from our inventory. My point is why allow us to build display cases at all if there isn't any way to display things? And furthermore I'm fairly certain the white display cases in 76 weren't present in FO4 and are in fact new items.
---
There are two good alternatives to this problem. One, you already said. That being to have pre-filled shelves. However, another option would be to go the OCDecorator method and just give us static versions of inventory items to place in our camps. In that way they're not having to track physics and players are still limited by the camp budget. 
---
You belong on a private server and they cant come fast enough. 
---
All public servers will always have a pvp element. You cant just make up rules in an online game and expect others to listen to them. You are just another player.
---
Raiders and camp raids are an intended, amazing part of fallout 76. Its fun being raided. Its fun raiding. Im just sorry for you guys. You're missing out on all this fun. 
---
Cause in post apocalyptic worlds, everyone is soooo nice to eachother right? Stop ruining my immersion. 
---
Did you seriously get on reddit to insult someone over a video game??? Lol
---
\&gt;  Inside was the greatest collection of treasure maps I have ever seen! 
---
Early on I didn't know that treasures were repeatable and I threw away all my dupes; it's possible he's making the same mistake.
---
Really?  With all the other problems that the game had (and continues to have) a cap cap of 25k is the one that breaks you?  I'm guessing you have bought everything that can be bought as far as resources, plans, etc. or were you just hording them?  You know you can't Scrooge McDuck caps, right?
---
And it's such an easy fix.  I'm confident the limit is more arbitrary than the stash limit.  If Bethesda learned of the issue, they could probably fix it fairly easily. 
---
And as for the lack of content, I hate to think you've wasted 96 levels worth of time without looking at the world you've been scrounging though.  There's content everywhere.  The stories in Flatwood, the teddy-bear house under the powerline tower in the forest, the story of the guy who scammed the monks in the Palace.  There's every bit as much 'content' in 76 as in 4 when it released, but the delivery is a bit different.
---
But, if that's the way you feel, 'Bye'.  We'll still be here.
---
Mutation serum recipes are 13k+
---
Neon lights are 11k.
---
The stupid blue cooler plan is almost 700 caps. 
---
I get having a limit. They want us to grind, buy things. Grind more,  buy more. But it absolutely is frustrating. 
---
I just hit level 100 and the trophy didint pop for it. Was that a thing before or after update. 1-19-19

Hey, I got a quad tesla rifle from a legendary mirelurk queen on that webpage. I think I actually got my quad tesla rifle from a mirelurk king
---
Yeah agree, not enough money sinks in this game. Fry up carebears sometimes. The end game grind can drive you a bit crazy. I had one guy come and blow my camp up, tried to kill him but he was godroll while standing and wouldn't budge. Managed to log before he got the shower xD
---

---
Thing that's broke is you get first shots on wanted or when a player inits pvp. Not hard to make that first shot count. What's fun too is stalking a godroll, they always move when they think no one is around. Long as you predict the path they'll run right into you while hidden
---
Okay so if I max out Incisor, I should be able to do some damage to her with All Rise while she is on the ground? Now I just need to find a way to ignore armor/damage resistance with a gun while she's in the air....
---
Dude I'm the same way. I prefer 2h melee and if I see a bunch of higher level enemies with guns, I'm out of there! 
---
Thanks for the advice. I've been just wandering around the entire map and doing random quests. Guess I'll head north tonight. 
---
To need a cap limit that high, you must be a really good CAPitalist.
---
Nah.  I've got two level 60-ish ( I have friends who can't agree on a F-ing platform) and I rarely have over 1K.  Just enough to buy stuff I don't have time to farm).
---
Piercing magazine mod
---
Too many edge lords around.
---
Out of curiosity, where was your camp? Certain players will destroy camps  if they are at certain spots due to rare spawn or at the clubhouse. 
---
I thought Nuka cola paint is something you can earn?
---
Amazing, my game never looks this good even at 4k on PC :(
---
This is what we call Todd Drama.  Are we having fun yet?
---
Or you. And I find it funny that you tell me what i should think having fun is. I am sorry for you as well, that the only fun you can find is at the expense of others. I am not missing out.
---
You should do this in the tuxedo, sunglasses and dress hat.  Since you look like a made man seems kind of appropriate
---
Yea, the same suggestions get repeated *ad naseaum* over and over.
---
I miss old bulletin boards where you would be scolded for not searching first before posting.
---
If no one is playing they definitely aren‚Äôt gonna keep supporting this game
---
Would be nice sure, but I wish they would just fix the root issue. If they would properly tag plans we've already learned, there would be no need to even pick them up.
---
There's also an economy issue. With the massive markdown for sold items (10% of vendor price?) lots would go for 10-20, but there's still a few plans like for heavy guns that would sell at over 100 caps. I certainly wouldn't complain, but I'm pretty positive Bethesda doesn't want items in the game that can be sold for that much to vendors. It's probably easier for them to just not do it, than to code in a bunch of exceptions for their pricing scheme.
---
Are you on a search for the One Piece? 
---
No. 
---
Just look at the Dupes. More will emerge.
---
It is on purpose.
---
Bethesda knows exactly how broken their Game is. The Limit is there for a reason, like the Cap Limit on Vendors.
---
That headgear looks like the "Beerhat" to me.
---
I like how everyone's still trying to deflect all thr blame pnto the players even after the other guy pointed out how stupid the damage requirement for loot drops is. How exactly is this better than at least having a srmi-generous proxy loot drop system in place? "Oh no people get more heavily skewed garbage loot from corpses that would give nothing otherwise!"
---
The better one is "I am SUPER-Mutant" quickly followed by "run away, run away" cause the legendaries AI is still broke.
---
The long goodbye
---
Double negative.
---
And that explains what ??
---
It was a nice change, but after an hour I did not see a single legendary there.
---
I mean, if it weren‚Äôt online I feel it would have a lot less hate &amp; attention on the hate.         
---
If it weren‚Äôt online I wouldn‚Äôt have made a Reddit for the market. 
---
Where is the TOS and/or EULA for Fallout 76? The EULA's I found were limited to specific things (and specified within the EULA) that were not Fallout 76. I found a TOS specifically for Zenimax services, again, specifically not FO76.
---
I'm sure there is a EULA for FO76, but I can't figure out where it's hidden. Given how everybody here seems so confident of the legal specifics of Fallout 76, I figured somebody could tell me where it is.
---
I run that event with a basic lil 10mm pistol for tagging. When a Legend shows up pop em then throw up the ‚Äúcone here‚Äù emote. 
---
I went back to my base and someone left me 3 high level weapons!
---
I thought that gladiator and iron stacking was proven false post beta?
---
The internet could be a better place if ppl put effort and empathy and considering others into the equation. It doesn't need to be such a dehumanizing and negative space.
---
I think the point is for players coming out of vault 76 to find them, not just people travel-hopping. But I agree the overseer cache is probably better.
---
Up north are super mutants, anglers, grafton monsters, etc. Theyre not terrible hard and most can be meleed. The water park has a side quest but id probably wait to complete those are your reward will be level locked when u complete it. Theres a ton of scorched there so easy xp. 
---
I think All Rise does like 300 damage for me. +40% with the Slugger perks would make it \~420 damage. Then, if I get Incisor maxed out, that makes All Rise ignore 75% of her armor. Do you think that would do the trick? 
---
What about the air? I am mostly Heavy Gun/Melee build, but do have a bunch of regular guns that I could use if you have suggestions. I have never used a Syringer... any suggestions on where to get an armor penetrating syringe?
---
I like to whip out a ski sword to mutate it as well, still not sure if it helps but it gives people plenty of time 
---
I'll reply to the only point you made, the bugs. first, NV was hugely panned on release because of the crashes. it definitely affected its score and some journos went as far as refusing to play it.
---
second, not even NV in its release state would crash as often as 76. sometimes you literally cannot go 10 minutes without disconnecting- multiple times. in a row. and I don't remember the final boss in NV requiring an event that's notorious for crashing the game, nukes. seriously, the final boss is prone to crashing. what the fuck.
---
It does not wprk like that. I frequently get no drops from SBQ mobs that I didn't tag. Sometimes even SBQ herself gives no loot despite hitting her many times.
---
This very much reminds me of the "This is fine" comic
---
Honestly I can't not imagine why it's unable to don't. 
---
I usually go for as most DR and ER and whenever i need radiation resist i hop into my power armor which i always carry with me
---
Damn that is way too much work to win a video game. FML. I only have one friend who plays FO76, now I gotta make new friends to win a video game? WTF this shit.
---
When you compare it to the TOS it is considered a hack. It is up to Bethesda if they want to ruin their reputation by acting on it. Anything that modifies the game is a hack no matter how small it is. Super annoying. It's like playing Russian roulette where Bethesda *might* put a bullet in it. They aren't the first game company to pull this trick. No mods! But we may not act on it if you use them.
---
Okay. Any particular gun you would use that on?
---
I'll be honest, I think of myself as a very patient and forgiving person who loves Bethesda games. However:
---
The bugs present in this title three months in *far* outweigh any other of their games, they don't seem to be paying attention to the community or multitudes of bug reports on minor, simple fixes (which is a huge red flag about their dev team), hacking *is* their issue, as any AAA online game should have countermeasures (seriously, what other  major online game can be hacked with a simple hex editor?), the crashes (for me) happen significantly more than any other game I've played period, the game feels *very* bland, short, empty, and unsatisfying after completing the *very* short main quest line, and many other issues.
---
I'm still playing and have hope that they'll put some love into the game, but I'm afraid, realistically, that they'll cut their losses very very soon.
---
Stalkers Baton on first roll good God hahaha. It's accurate alright.
---
Someone else beat you to them is all.
---
I read somewhere that open world respawns are 6 hours.    I have zero idea if this is true so please take it with a grain of salt until someone else can comment.     I have been using a ton of rubber building marine armor to scrap to learn the various mods and that gym is empty most of the time I check.     I thought asbestos was going to be the difficult component but it seems rubber, at least for me, is the bottleneck.
---
I think people are taking them now. Cores dont refill when you load in and seem to drain faster. 
---
Yep, I have experienced the same. The fusion generators are "running" as if there is a fusion core present, but the model is not and it does not give you the option to retrieve it. Same at each one I have come across.
---
Thanks for the silver stranger! :)
---
They seem to be farmed more often and regen at a slower rate it seems. Try hopping for power armor frames. They're everywhere and regularly have a fusion core. And invest in the full charge perk card. Running in power armor uses no extra energy at second level 
---
At .25 lbs per plan it's just not worth it for me to haul them around. If I do end up with a few extra from quests or whatever, I'll try and unload them where they might get picked up.
---
Oh, do you hear that? It‚Äôs the world‚Äôs smallest violin. And it‚Äôs playing just for you. Toodaloo!
---
That would be very abused; events that run on a timer alone like the Census one especially.  There's a 5 minute timer for it, just keep doing what you were until 30sec left then fast travel to the event for the free rewards.
---
Who cares? Let people do what they want
---
This is as it should be. 
---
No you should seriously suggest this.  Pity we wont have little kids running around to adopt like on Skyrim. But we are supposed to be "re-building America"
---

Youtubers in general are now like the regular media (CNN, FOX, MSNBC etc) in that negativity sells, or gets clicks. They all pile on to get a piece of that pie and will beat a dead horse until a new horse comes along.

The days of Youtube being an objective alternative to IGN, Polygon etc are gone. 
---
Sure 76 had issues at release and still does but the extreme hate is fucking ridiculous. 
---
Next patch notes:
---
* Fixed an issue that made artillery cannon useful.
---
I get that but at level 1 you dont have any supplies to build anything yet, you have no idea how things even work. And you risk them despawning in a bag. Everyone has to go thru flatwoods at least once so its a safer place.

Eh... playing Fallout 3 with the shishkebab, it was possible to remove the arms, legs, and head from a corpse, then pick it up using ‚Äòz‚Äô (on PC) and jiggle the stumps around by moving the mouse back and forth.

It located south of the Top of the World tower. The only thing 'interesting' about the spot is that there are three braman that spawn there. Nothing else remarkable about it.

The games devoid of anything, so people are suggesting like mad that some shred of hope their $60 is going to amount to something entertaining at the end. Loads of suggestions in a game subreddit like this; typically - means theres fuck all to do in game for them.

Circumference here
---
yeah i've inadvertently bought tons of armor mod plans only to discover I can't craft the base item, and of course those plans are near impossible to find. Can't even get them from scrapping spare pieces.

Nice, about to launch a nuke on her now if you wanna join me 
---
Reading is fundamental.  I said the ‚ÄúWanted Murderer‚Äù tag, not just a ‚ÄúWanted‚Äù status.  I was under the impression they were two different things.  Because as far as I‚Äôve seen you can murder someone and still take their junk.  Which doesn‚Äôt jive with what Todd said at E3.  That‚Äôs a clear benefit to grieving that he said wouldn‚Äôt happen...but it does. 
---
Go run the Line in the Sand or similar events. You are guaranteed at least two fusion cores.
---
People just server hop like crazy. Its the same thing with the weights and lead farming. I usually find stuff every 4-5 times. 
---
This makes me laugh
---
I think you mean Event: Protest March. Event: Grafton Day is the one with a single Grafton Monster spawn, which almost always spawns on the street before you reach the event.
---
Protest March requires you to go to the zone before the protesters spawn in, and they spawn from inside the buildings (so sometimes they get stuck in the walls or floors). There is the rare chance they spawn in that alleyway and walk in a protest circle, but most of the time, they are running to you from some other location rather than spawning where the quest marker is.
---
Ever since they changed the timer on events for them to not show up for hour+ after completion, events like this one are harder to find for sure.  If you're the only one there it can start and end in less than 5 minutes, which means it wont show up for another hour+ on that server.

I'd love to be able to save presets. Would make experimenting with new looks a lot easier, since I don't have to worry if I get attached to my current look.
---
I dunno about being able to share those presets, though. I guess I'm just worried everyone will pick a Triss Merigold preset they found online instead of trying to be original, but I suppose that doesn't matter when the alternative is going for one of the in-game presets because they didn't care anyway. 
---
Gasp. This!
---
I've never been sure if world items were gone when someone else picked them up. At least this confirms that for me.  Another decent spot for rubber is the fairground (forget what it's called) in The Forest.  There's a few basketballs there.

This explains why I only ever find one at a time at the motel in Flatwoods.

It's probably going to be later content / expansions / dlc.

Not buying it anymore. There's a massive difference between being bored and deciding to be a jerk. If you're bored with the game, put the game down and play something else until new content comes out.

---
HOW
---
Have you had 2 people side by side do a timed reload?  
---
Only asking because sometimes it hard to notice the speed increase on the "smaller" animations (shell into breach) vs the "larger" (drum from the side up and in) animations.
---
imo it's the dev's job to address these kinds of issues. if players can "accidentally" screw others over simply by playing the game as intended, that's flawed game design.
---
are you insane? circlejerking in the only thing this sub is good for. anything remotely negative is what gets downvoted.
---
Very handy during nuke events.
---
&gt;Couldn't you just tap for power attacks and then hold for grenades?
---
Sounds great in theory, but the difference between the two is hair-line, hence the content of the OP. It would be nice to have seperate functions. Every other FPS (and let's not argue this is what Fallout has become) has a seperate grenade button.
---
This happens every time to me when the killing blow happens on stairs. Every. Damn. Time. On. Stairs.
---
Rolled 5 times and 3 were Furious weapons, which is like my favorite legendary. 
---
At level 75 I currently have 0 furious weapons. 
---
This is one of the reasons I stopped playing. Too frustrating to try and tag mobs with so many people running around with explosive weapons. 
---
Enjoy the game
---
I'm saying you only need 1 card. And if you already have that card and want to tier it up you just click it again.
---
For example: I own a tier one Master Rifleman card. To make it a tier 2, all I need to do is click the card I own and purchase the next tier.
---
For horde events TAG THE RIGHT LOCATION. Unless I'm an idiot I do not understand why the thing does nothing when I'm in the zone then moves across the map. I'm only level 31, I don't have a shit ton of caps to chase this shit around lol

Banned players using an exploit with artillery that would allow for farther range with wires than allowed. You may appeal your ban in writing with how you achieved this exploit. 
---
Same with the plague walker mutation .
---
They reduced the number of cores in the world in the last patch. 
---
I take workshops daily and as many as possible in the server I‚Äôm in. Never solo tho. That way whoever gets disconnected can rejoin one of us still in the server. 
---
Great work! I'll say a prayer a dev sees this and Bethesda is open to creating new content!

Anyone have trouble with the level 100 trophy. I hit lvl 100 on 1-19-19 but didint get the trophy. I'm now lol 102 still not popped.
---
I‚Äôm not coming at you personally right now, but it doesn‚Äôt matter how many times people ask for it or bitch and moan about it. Either they put it in or they don‚Äôt, because it‚Äôs impossible they haven‚Äôt picked up on it by now. 
---
It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if they didn‚Äôt as it would require them to rewrite their netcode, and their servers are already unstable as hell. 
---
If your pro active you make mad caps. Just as much as having some storefront. 
---
Completely stupid IMO 
---
I love that haha
---
Just joined.  Xbox player...

It wouldn't be the first time Bethesda's oversight affected other players in an adverse way. For instance, all the duplication glitches, including the camp duplication glitch, the disarming glitch, etc etc, there are many errors that Bethesda have made in making this game, who's to say that Bethesda made a mistake in letting players make a camp so near a known location? Normally there is a wide perimeter around a known location or anothers camp so that you can't go too close, but in this one instance you can, and so close that your literally touching it. All I'm asking for is the same rules as every other location. Make the perimeter the same width.
---
Yeah, but this paint description implied that it was for "literally everything".
---
Here is an idea on a rebuild of my character, what do you think?

---
Because the developers are incredibly lazy. They designed the controls for console and then made it so you cant bind keys for seperate things on PC because its a lazy port
---
Nice! Same here, on my One X. 
---
I did some testing and was able to cram a generator and Jukebox through the wall, but I couldn‚Äôt activate it. I‚Äôm a little uneasy about shoving a fast travel mat in there for fear of repercussions. 
---
Idk I have a feeling it was adjusted. I tested it, and went to Morgantown HS for plastic. I took all the plastic pumpkins and plates, but I left one specific pumpkin and one specific plate on the gym. I joined three different worlds of people on my friend‚Äôs list, and each time all the pumpkins and plates were gone except for the ones I specifically left unlooted. 
---
In 24 hours I went back and it was all replenished. 
---
Thanks for that tip Franks.   I will add it to my list.   I supplement my rubber gathering with breaking down weapons for the small bits of rubber they often have, laser rifles in particular off the top of my head.
---
Lead isn't terrible if your willing to grab pretty much every can you ever see.   Add in rat poison, paint, and even a few baby items (this world loved their lead) and you will be swimming in the stuff.   In my case that lead combined with all the steel from scrapping weapons and you'll be all set. 
---
I have also noticed this isn't nearly as quick as it used to be.
---
Not sure if it's bugged or if they lowered the speed increase on purpose. My movement speed does not seem to be affected.
---
I think it would be cool if it loaded random pictures that others take during load screens.
---
I may have to try that instead of dumping them at vendors.
---
Suck it all up! The queen, other scorchbeasts and everything anyone got a single hit on has loot for them. Still not sure why the queen is varying 20-50 ultracite armor recipes, but drag away all you can cary.
---
It is automatically stored when you move camp...
---
Pvp isnt about the expense of others. Its the most challenging part of the game.
---
You get a challenge from one shotting ghouls? I launched a nuke yesterday. Site alpha is sooo boring and easy. Everything is easy and boring. The game is easy and boring. 
---
Except PvP. PvP is where its at. People are smart. They hide. They fight back in interesting ways. They will start spamming missile turrets. Build walls around you etc. The content is endless. I love it . my favorite part is coaxing ppl into fighting at My CAMP. Sure i lkse some stupid junk. But i got tricks and traps and alotta fun. 
---
Im melee too. I am at a huge disadvantage. I dont have any ranged weapons. Always trying to figure out how to flank players.  
---
Its odd that the pve community calls pvpers "greifers" when its clearly part of the game and intended by devs. Im just having fun doing what i like. 
---
Dont hate
---
Unless they were stealth patched, bolt action pipe rifles WITH A SCOPE ATTACHED are a sleeper monster gun. It‚Äôs the only one in the game that all rifle and pistol perks stack on top of.
---
Yep, I regularly do runs in search of assault/combat rifles and combat shotguns. Pick up enough that I‚Äôm right at my weight limit, pop on Big Bargain, knock back a beer for the +1 Charsma, and clean out the nearest vendor. 
---
Chems have a good weight to value ratio too. 
---
Not spoopy enough. Jk, is good
---
Melee and heavy weapons user 
---
Melee is for when ammo is low and heavy weapons for heavy boi enemy‚Äôs I also keep the 10mm smg perfect storm on me
---
I shot one in the leg and he said ‚Äúowww Leg!‚Äù Lol I kind of felt bad. 
---
If you do you will be posting this just like me. üòÑ

Lol eating dinner rn but ill be on shortly
---
I‚Äôve been saying this sub is trash for a while now. They couldn‚Äôt take the heat and made their own sub. 
---
Hasn't it always been this way?
---
It's something positive about Fallout 76 of course it'll get downvoted, people from r/Fallout come here every now and then
---
I'm not having issues, I just verified the claims made by this person in regards to amazon availability.
---
I think any speculation should be floated past ones peers, in hopes of informative discourse, not belittling.
---
Anyone raging about a youtube video opinion is in for a rough go, as is expecting others to just have the knowledge you have.
---
Also, OP and the youtuber are different people.   So calling OP an idiot for asking if a questionable video had any factual basis, seems wrong, thats all.
---
No shade, just wondered why all these people shat on a dude for asking a question.
---
I think I have my answer, because he's an idiot in those people's opinions.  
---
But that seems to be a lot of speculation based on one small question, as opposed to a factual based argument.
---
The other image in the album is better for the creepy.
---
Checking for targets does use AP in '76 unfortunately. I tested that spamming vats and the AP soon goes down and with each tap the fusion core power drops slightly too.
---
You can actually get a poster advertising explosive bullets.
---
Armor pen helps alot yes. You probably still wont be soloing her but I think you'd do better with that load out. It's tough to hybrid build kill the queen, not enough stats to max everything out. Maybe a commando vats build with some points into strength then just pop a crap ton of chems when she lands could work. 
---
It's just a regular Syringer with a barrel mod. Forget the name of the mod but I think it's fairly common.
---
Blaze it
---
Pretty much. Works kind of like Citrix, don't know if it uses the framework. I use it myself and highly recommend it. Things to keep in mind though: 1) Make sure you have good up and downstream, or it won't make it. 2) Unless you have at least 15mbps upstream, mic inputs won't work at all, and even then may not be detected. Otherwise, love the system! 
---
I get that, it‚Äôs just frustrating having serums that you cannot sell to them. 
---
I agree w you that no one should tell you not to like the game.
---
However I like the game. I've now played over 350 hours. The BOTTOM LINE is Bethseda put out an Unfinished, bugged out, not ready game.
---
I AM ALLOWED to voice my displeasure at the current state of the game. It should not have been released in the state it's in.
---
Pretty simple to me. I bought it. Probably played it more then most people on here. I obviously like it since I've played so many hours. I also am extremely frustrated and disappointed that triple A gaming companies keep screwing us over w these half games they sell us for full price. I've said it before but if I put out a product or service at my job that was in the state 76 is I would be fired immediately. 
---
Also I think people single mindedly praising Bethseda or any company for giving us these half finished games is just going to allow more of it to happen.
---
The game IS fun. When it works. When it doesn't freeze on me. When it doesn't randomly disconnect me. When items in my storage or on me don't randomly dissappear. When my weight isn't randomly going up and down. Etc etc etc etc. 
---
Movement speed.. you will not notice your movement speed personaly but ask other people they will see the difference. As for reload this does nkt seem to work for me at all
---
Amen. 
---
Really like this. What GameSir pad is this, if I may ask? I use Shadow myself and would like to try this.
---
How many hours have you played? 
---
I think the perks are accounted for in the damage value you see in your inventory already.
---
Just give them to new ppl. 
---
That sounds awesome!! 
---
I'm deaf. Add text chat or else I'm offended and discriminated against.
---
It's useless on gear. Just take an extra rad-x diluted. 
---
That‚Äôs ok, we all have days where we don‚Äôt click :)
---
The National Isolated Radio Array. It‚Äôs the big-ass radio observatory dish north of the West Tec research center. Open the map and look for a picture of a big radio dish  :)
---
I miss the ‚ÄòKneecapper‚Äô from 4.   Was one of my fav guns of all time.  You could kneecap and taunt an entire group of anything before killing them.  Hope there‚Äôs one in 76!
---
When combat is as accurate, flawless and as smooth as Fallout 4 and I'm not disconnected every 25 minutes (usually in the middle of completing a quest, so that I have to start over), then I'll agree with you.
---
Ok, nothing I know of spawns there... Is it wide out in the open? I keep my camp hidden way out of view, it would take a good 3 min walk through a dense forest to get to mine from the nearest fast travel point. I also keep crouched while I am there, so I don't pop up on the map. They (raiders) will watch for stationary people or those who only move around a bit &amp; determine that would be their camp. 
---
If you are out in the open, I would move it somewhere more obscure.
---
Sell them for 200 on here
---
You don't have to believe me. Just try it. Click on a card you already own and see what happens.
---
You need class freak to reduce penalties on mutations.  You also don't need to keep white knight equipped.  Since it only cost 1 resource to repair, why bother?  Just equip it when you need to repair.
---
I recommend higher intelligence, power user rank 1 helps keep cores.  Also, I don't find grim reapers sprint that useful... not for tough fights anyway, a horde of ghouls sure, but 4 leaf clover procs a lot more than grim reapers does.  If you get a TSE weapon, the explosive portion benefits from the explosive dmg increase perk in INT.
---
Also, the junk perk in strength is really only useful when doing scavenger runs... not really needed if headed down for a SBQ.  I use the reduced chem weights primarily because that's more source of income, selling chems to vendors and you get more weight reduction for your buck with that one.
---
Endurance of 1... might be risky... I run end 4, and I don't have a whole lot of health.
---
Isn't that the mutation that can make the whole enclave compound aggro your ass?
---
I'll wait for you to do it dude, took barely any of her health off her haha
---
go pick up a toaster they're hollow and light vs big solid metal tongs so heavy makes me feel like a weak baby

XBox 1X:
---
I'm suddenly having problems getting away from crafting benches. I'm level 37. When I exit and try to leave after making something, my character returns to the bench and the crafting initiates again. I then have to wait until the crafting menus come up before I can exit again. It's really annoying and slow. It seems to happen if I don't continue pushing the left stick and move away quickly to put enough distance between my character and the bench. It's happening at most of the benches now since the patch but never before that on this console.  
---
I'm also noticing a lag today on the Aussie server, of about one full second. I shoot someone and it takes a second for the bullet to hit them. I'm also getting shot by people who have already moved away so those characters are no longer there for me to return fire to. Server lag?? 
---
Such a dumb thing to fix without fixing server disconnects.  
---
Haven't heard about that but I wouldn't put it past this game tbh.
---
The whole point is that I *don't* want to use the mic, hence the desire for an emote. I don't care for the harassment I sometimes get as a female player, and when you factor in my social anxiety it can be very uncomfortable. I don't play so I can feel anxious - I play to have fun and unwind, and I talk to people when I feel ok doing so. Plenty of folks have reasons for not wanting to talk to random people online - personal issues, language barriers, etc - and enough people (especially on consoles) just don't have a mic. So an emote would be useful on so many levels.
---
Fortunately, before Bethesda 'fixed' them, I had collected about 20 of them, but since then, I'm down to about 6 and falling fast.  Because combat is such a joke and mobs are such bullet sponges (when you can even HIT them), I've found PA to be a must, but there's the sad realization with dwindling cores, I'll have to park my PA and maybe the game itself.
---
No it's be nice if we had robots to repair it over time. Or robot Butler's in general. Like shown in the hype trailers before release...
---
I played yesterday for 5 hours and never crashed once.
---
There are perks for that.
---
Heavy gunner faster reload and anti armor in power armor 
---
Got a drill as my SBQ loot last night. Thanks Todd!
---
you can generate some by powering up a power station 
---
Im still going to dislike his videos and use adblock. Hes a known duper.
---
A quick fix I've discovered is that I can still pull up the map and fast travel. Once that loads I can use the pip boy again and nothing is frozen anymore
---
Yes doing that now, sitting around is boring lol
---
Hey im not saying I would do it but I can see why people do. Not everyone cares to be a friendly wastelander. 
---
No, they don't have that ability.  
---
Yes they do it anyways.  
---
F.
---
What about us in the Capital Wasteland
---
It's not broken, Pack Rat 3 reduces weight of junk while it's in your INVENTORY by 75% as it's meant to. Unless they change the perk to be passive (don't have to have the card equipped), think of how it would be game breaking if you took off the perk and your stash went above the weight limit? 
---
PC. So many disconnects yesterday that I just gave up. Once I literally disconnected before the screen had finished loading up after the last disconnect. It hadn‚Äôt been too bad for me before the last few days, but now it‚Äôs at the old cliche ‚Äòliterally unplayable‚Äô stage for me. 
---
Was wondering as the drain now is very fast!
---
They can't track you, but if you're anywhere around the Cranberry Bog or near a fissure site you WILL run into enough of them.
---
This game has gotten boring, so if I see a camp I will start destroying it until I get a few hundred cap bounty on my head.  Then people will start showing up and fun will happen. 
---
Gonna start putting this to the test when I get home. Thanks
---
üëåüèª
---
Nah, maybe Bethesda should bring this game to current gen standards and put in area tagging?
---
Theres no greifing in the game, just an entire subreddit in denial of PvP mechanics.

What platform are you on?
---
Would love to collaborate with you for a pop up in Richmond.!
---
So according to u. We have to hate the game? We are on reddit to talk about the game. Whenever i defend the game i get hate.  Just like u being negative for no reason
---
When ever I've fast travelled and waited 5 mins I'm still frozen
---
After 500 rolls I got 5 one star two shots. 500 fking rolls. It opened my eyes - this is not even a grind anymore, it's just horrendoulsy bad game design. Either give us these effects as weapon mods, so everybody has the same chance to get one, or remove them completely. RNG-based mechanics are just utter bullshit.
---
I agree too. I changed this up above to "Bump their resistances to counter being one shot. Give them more damage to counter player power armor."
---
No they shouldn‚Äôt 
---
It's funny, I've seen workbench plans in the wild and for sale, but I don't ever remember having to buy or find them. Are they awarded for some quest? (maybe the responders C.A.M.P tutorial?)
---
I changed this above to "Bump their resistances to counter being one shot. Give them more damage to counter player power armor."
---
you have yourself a deal good buddy
---
Only a Commie would think the Enclave is bad.
---
Something is up with how long they follow. Ive encountered several and tried to run for way longer than an enemy should be aggroed on you and they do follow. I dont know the actual distance but its much farther than any of the other enemies in the game. 
---
I'm certain it works with my handmade. The speed affects the sound of the reload as you might expect and it's very noticeable.
---
Yeah idk, PC player here I7770k GTX 1070 8 gigs of DDR4., people act like they never played online/ MMORPG games before. I have NEVER played any MMO that wasn't full of bugs and disconnects at some point, especially early on. Over time most get balanced out. Maybe it's just that people didn't start playing beta/launch as much as with Fo76. Thing is, it can be years before many of the bugs get worked out in MMO games. I mean yeah, I get some disconnects, 1-2 a session, Legendaries die and fall through the map sometimes, Sometimes it takes a while for loot to load in on a mob, sometimes a mob doesn't take damage when I hit it, I just hit it again. I mean I get some of the bugs people get, but it's not like its a constant thing. The game has run better and better with each patch for me, I was even able to crank up my video driver options to max settings and the game still runs great. IDK, maybe the fact I have spent the past 10-15 years playing primarily online games, MMORPGs, etc I understand it just works (This way). For me I would say 90% of the time, the game just works for me. No issues, no disconnects, not fps problems, enemies take damage etc. 
---
Of course, when I run any game on PC I pretty much shut every nonessential program, game client ect down and try to just run what I need, No open firefox, no Chrome in the background, not streaming youtube on my second screen. 
---
Its also easy to tell when Its my issue and Bethesdas issue when playing with friends, like when I D/C and they dont, or we both DC at the same time its garanteed server side as I am east coast and he is west cost.
---
I will say when playing on a team the glitches I see the most about 90% of the time are the Invisible teammate, the Power armor diaper, and the distorted body in power armor but not displaying the power armor, to a lesser extent, they may spawn in naked, or the wrong sex. 
---
Over all though I just dont experience bugs to the extent other poeple do and have not since the day the game launched.  
---
The craftible fusion generator creates fusion cores?? Or just capturing the plants?
---
I always let others tag the legendary and also the normal enemies.
---
An exception are those *very nice* people with their TSE shotguns. Since those people often tend to play in an egoistic way, i will do the same and steal as many enemies as possible from them. :)
---
Depends on how many people are there.
---
I let people in my group get a shot in. Or like if I'm alone and there's like one other dude doing it with me, I'll let him tag it.
---
But if like half the server is other there, fuck it. Every man for themselves. 
---
how is this any different then writing/drawing/playing games?
---
just an hobby
---
And so many of the suggestions are just bad or self serving 
---
I really used to bitch about no human NPCs, but at this point I'd rather have some decent combat (you know, like fallout 4) and servers that didn't throw me to the curb every 30 minutes.
---
You don't know that the weapon was duped.
---
I get helping people but when everything is known nothing is sacred, I don‚Äôt want to fight for all the little resource locations I found 
---
Must be some kind of soft cap, because emergency protocols alone is 25%, and I can‚Äôt get 25% out of speed demon 20% plus a 5% shrouded wood piece. 
---
Happens at my camp too when I finish cooking, I do have some tree branches clipping through into my camp..
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs how I got the grenade 
---
It's an interesting idea, but I think a single stash is much more practical. For example, I hardly store any aid, but I have 11 power armor chassis. I'd run out of dedicated PA space reeeeeaaal fast that way.
---
Mmm see this is my point. I appreciate the apology but it‚Äôs inportant to understand what effects our words have.
---
&gt; done nothing to provoke you,
---
You said I had a weak personality, accused me of trolling, and that I was pathetic. Whether or not you believe you are correct or not, these are exactly the kinds of things we need to not have and need to be aware of. I bring them back up to you only to help you understand what to be conscious of. In return I‚Äôll be a bit clearer and not simplify things to potentially insulting terms like ‚Äúweak.‚Äù
---
We need a reason or reward for wrecking camps as its jus a griefers tool right now.. if I could crack those stashes open and take my plunder I'd be in your camp right now lol. But no I cant so I jus stay away 
---
I'd sell them if they were 1 cap. If we could bulk ammo, I'd sell every 100 bullets for 1 cap too. Fusion cores, missiles, mini nukes, 1 cap. My OCD would be so happy.
---
Yeah I tell my friends it's a fun game but it's not a good game. 
---
Enemies in this game have no aggro distance. What I mean is they will keep chasing you until something else aggros them. Hide in buildings maybe
---
I was once told that the inability to don't was a feature. To this day, I can't be sure that It Isn't untrue.
---
The game scraps shocks for steel without telling you even if you have tons of bulk steel. Did you ever do the uranium fever event and repair the extractors?  That‚Äôs how I lost a bunch of my expensive mods. 
---
This is the buggiest game I‚Äôve ever played. It crashes the most and I encounter an issue so often, it‚Äôs ridiculous. People on this sub just downvote away whenever someone brings this up. Like my comment will likely be -100000. This game is far far far from finished. I enjoy it, sure. But at its current state. It‚Äôs a slap in the face. 
---
You misunderstand, I'm not saying it's ok to have this bug. Or that he the game is fine with it. I'm not trying to justify it's existence. But a bug is an unintended or unexpected behavior. 
---
This is also not an unheard of or incredibly uncommon bug in games, specially ones that sync an inventory between a client and a server. That you have trouble recalling a game with a similar bug is irrelevant, all it takes is a google search to find similar examples on other games.
---
It doesn't excuse BGS from fixing it, but a bug isn't on purpose. And sometimes these things slip through, no matter how much testing you do. There's just no substitute for testing on a scale of millions of concurrent users, that's so many use cases, nothing even compares. All you can do as a developer is be ready to fix them when they inevitably come in.
---
This should definitely be a priority item for BGS given the nature of the game. But just because something is high priority doesn't mean it can or will be fixed quickly, either. If the developer cannot replicate the issue or cannot determine it's root cause, there's nothing he can do besides try and get more information. It's just how it is. We often blame developers for things, but we're not gods. They didn't put the bug in on purpose, they can only do the best they can to fix it in a prompt and quick manner. Sometimes, that's just not how it works out.
---
Thus the trashcans full of bodies behind the  Whitesprings
---
Thanks! Right now I have a few spare thanks to PharmaFarmer perk, but it is great to know someone with a surplus willing to share :-)
---
Are you going to be on anytime soon? What‚Äôs your IGN? I‚Äôm Daishiki and I have an All Rise with your name on it. 
---
I really enjoy how you used the angled half walls to create visual supports for the upper level and its base.
---
No, he had done nothing to provoke you... The OP

I like the "mounted heads" idea.
---
All I really want from the Atom Store is a big burly mountain man beard.  I would buy (and have bought) other things that strike my fancy if I'm in the mood, but the beard is what my heart truly desires.
---
My God, I can't say with any amount of uncertainty that you aren't incorrect. 
---
Yes please. And they fall randomly from the Sky. 
---
Are you saying after he's frozen his game or before he attempts to pull up his pip-boy?
---
I've encountered this too. Nine times out of ten I find if you wait a minute the PipBoy flashes to life and you unfreeze. Seems to be an issue with the game not loading entirely before it gives you control. Same reason the Whitespring service entrance bugs out while server hopping.
---
All I want to say is thank you for taking the time to write all of this out. I agree with enough of it to not write it out myself. it seems the general consensus is people do events that have the following traits:
---
\-Good rewards for completion
---
\-Guaranteed legendary enemies
---
\-Clear and easy instructions to complete
---
\-Good ratio of investment to reward
---
I think what people would like to see more of is events that benefit other players as well.
---
Cue endless pics of their naked character teabagging dead raiders. 
---
A friend and I were planning on starting one, last week. I was gonna collect a bunch of soap for consolation prizes, too. Might still do it.
---
I prefer the idea to keep them based on your max stat. I'm ok with an 8 agility and a 12 agility build having different levels of locks they can open. As people sit on here, many of them are completely skipping locks as is, so only skipping level 3 ones doesn't seem like such a punishment.
---
Flechette mod 
---
Sorry, I explained that poorly...
---
I meant that although my reload speed isn't noticably faster, my movement IS. I have to walk crouched to not get way ahead of my group while we're travelling. 
---
Yeah, pretty much!   There are a couple companies doing remote gaming systems, but i like this because there isnt some stupid frontend to pick games.   You get the whI'llle windows 10 desktop.   
---
Just hope they fix it in the next patch it's happened to me so many times as I just forget about it.
---
Sorry about that, kinda new to this, and was still in a moment when typing on phone. 
---
By the way what do you mean by "TL;DR" ???
---
With the increase in posts and complaints I‚Äôve made it a goal to roam and kill every camp I find. Then check on here hoping to see your cry post üò¢ why should we be punished for doing what the game allows? And even offers me a perk card to do more damage to the camp I attack. Pew pew
---
Congratulations.
---
The fact you think it "probably wouldn't affect server performance" shows you aren't experienced with this are you &gt;_&gt;. Network traffic alone between the servers would be greatly affected. Having 100 servers communicating to 100 servers while having 240k players also communicating to those servers would have a huge impact on latency and packet loss. Not having a dedicated server means all traffic between servers is multiplicative instead of additive. 100x100x2 is a hell of a lot more then 100x1x2 lol. Every game with a decent amount of servers has a Master Server dedicated to collecting all the server information, players, pings, server status, etc. for this reason. I don't know about the processing side for the server would be like, I'm a network management specialist so I can only speak of the wires side here. But it would definitely impact the game. Especially when they roll out private servers.

I saw some post yesterday about having to clear your cache on PS4 by powering down and unplugging your PS4 for a minute. Someone else went as far as to reinstall their game and apparently it helped for them. Do a search and this may help you.
---
Thanks for clearing this up. Am I misunderstanding the game mechanic then - on regular battles, the loot is first come first serve, is it not? I know if I don't tag a hit on something, there's no loot for me, but are you saying that in any battle if I see loot it's mine for the taking?
---
TSE Shotgun
---
Anything that says "glowing" in its name.
---
On sailors folly is a privateers boon!
---
I still have god rays after adding the command line :(
---
I literally saw a suggestion for a no mic emote. Just make due everyone, we do need a quality thread for suggestions to browse when we actually are interested in. 
---
I find I have to put the game down about a week at a time.  Usually about the time I run out of all ammo because the mobs have such shitty hit detection and I just can no longer subject myself to the frustration of having to pump 6 shotgun blasts into a lvl 1 ghoul.
---
Sorry,  kinda new to this, but i hope i have fixed it for you, 
---
Sounds like borderlands 2 pearlescent weapons.  Grinding the same boss day in and day out
---
I mean you‚Äôre not wrong , but I also don‚Äôt know that it isn‚Äôt, which is kinda the point of my post.  
---
Something that gamebreaking should not be in the hands of every other guy I stumble across.
---
Why are there so many? 
---
and u get downvoted for ur honest response lol i also have only crashed twice since tuesdays patch and im on vanilla ps4 thats 5 years old.  
---
Manufacturer rreference number is 100MT-0001-A per my order from amazon.   I didn't see a model name or number.
---
I doubt this format would be used often if there wasn't a notification system as well as easy access.
---
Sorry, fixed it i hope
---
Probably even higher than that if it doesn‚Äôt take into account legendary mobs not dropping anything at all or very very often dropping things with less stars than they have 
---
They're slowly incorporating it in more games, I think it's more an issue with getting permission from devs rather than Discord not doing it on their end.
---
He doesn't know if it's super but let's be honest a large % of TSE weapons are duped 
---
Thank you! I hadnt even considered the AP thing for unyielding.
---
out o curiosity, are you on ps4 pro? ive only DCd twice on ps4 in the last week since patch on ps4 vanilla thats 5 years old
---
Hmmm true. But then if you could display them instead of storing them. They just need a level 4 lock on them so no one can take them. I miss my PA garage from fallout 4. It was glorious!
---
By perimeter fence, what exactly do you mean by that? Do you mean the door or the wall or the breach or something else?
---
I think he means lack of buttons. But it would be solved with a Pip-boy menu.
---
Am I the only one who sees the sophomoric humor of farming rubbers...er...base materials in a high school gym? Did you check beneath the bleachers?
---
Nah, play it with the Power Glove.
---
That solves it for 1 of 3 platforms.
---
I do that just because it's easier to find the quest objectives if you've completely cleared a sub-objective.
---
The turkey...
---
I've hit a distance with a few different enemies. Just last night I dipped out on a Scorchbeast as I'm not exactly fond of spending tons of ammo on them currently, and this one was being a turd stain spamming Sonic super hard (worst I've seen yet). Eventually got far enough away she just left me alone. 
---
I agree with all of this. I basically just said all of this in that one paragraph so you wouldn't hace to, yet you did.
---
You think that's bad? Try a CTD in the middle of a SBQ fight. Happens to me half the times I fight her. Still, I feel your pain.
---
Is there a setting to change mouse sensitivity in the lockpicking minigame? I need it to be about 20% of what it is by default.
---
Btw I didn't see it mentioned in the video, but if there are GHOULS in town they don't spawn as Glowing bloated Ones but as Molemen..  Talk about disappointing!
---
Losing your camp in fo76 is not that bad really.. this is a padded pvp system that holds your hand the entire time and rebuilding your camp is cheap and takes 0 time. Atleast they cant wreck your camp and take your mats so you cant rebuild, or take all your weapons and armor and make you start over for real.
---
The Duped Police needs to be formed 
---
Looks good to me.
---
My build is much the same although I didn't go full 3\* on the Strength shotgun perks. I just did 1\* in each for the 30% boost. Six more perks to double that to 60% was more than I could justify. 
---
I'm after a much greater treasure...the kind that haunts every pirates dreams...BIG WHOOP!
---
I'd show you my camp, but it looks like just a plain brick, single story building with no windows, and only a keypad access door to get in. Nobody knows the code but me, so don't even ask. And let me stop you right there, no you're not allowed inside.
---
If you read the description, it says hunting rifle. 
---
Ah, the good old days... ;)
---
Lmao same
---
Probably because there are way too feckin' many replies/posts/comments.
---
Too much enemies at some areas, and move the sword from order of mysteries to another location  please. 
---
It's not the weapon that's one shotting you. It's the stacked bobbleheads.
---
If the text range is like 50 meters plus team mates, there's rarely going to be more than 2 or 3 players around to see all that. They can already do all that over microphone.
---
Sorry, I get ya now.
---

---
You might need to farm a bit more now, but this is a quick route.
---
Except glowing ones in nuked whitesprings
---
They're griefing, for lack of a better term. All turrets face into the golf club so they shoot the Ghouls you're trying to kite. There's no reason as they don't get xp or drops etc, it's just to be a nuisance and ruin enjoyment.
---
That‚Äôs a nice looking build! You are right about the camp being the true endgame, especially for solo players. Building a nice camp in the perfect location takes a lot of cap grind and experimentation. I‚Äôve probably spent 80 of my 120 hours just jumping between workshops and vendors gathering junk and breaking it down to sell off for caps to buy plans. It‚Äôs weird that the most boring and tedious part of the game has been the most engaging for me. I would rather do that then launch another nuke just to go repeatedly kill glowing golfers for a weapon or two. 
---
The fence around the front of the penitentiary. Walk up to that to start the event.
---
Some people duped till they had over 1 million carry weight but also supers have been selling a TSE handmade for example on eBay for a fiver so they have duped a ton to sell which to be honest has made a few dupers a couple of thousand or more that's 1 of many reasons why there's so many.
---
A Monkey Island 2 reference? 
---
This might be a first for me. 
---
Scorchbeasts are a pain. 
---
PvP is NOT melee for best weapon.
---
Im well ahead of my mates gear wise. I have a 3 star sledge and a few 2 - 3 star armor pieces.  
---
Using range is a HUGE advantage. I need to run up to PvP enemies. They get a free shot or 3 at me if they see me running up. So i have to be clever enough to flank them. Which is very hard considering how close the respawn points are when seeking revenge. 
---
My buddies have an easier time getting kills with their explosive weapons. 
---
But i do 1-shot EVERYONE.  Ill give you that. 
---
^PLEASE ^DONT ^NERF ^MELEE
---
Again, I literally already said all of this in a single paragraph so you wouldn't have to. 
---
And yet you said it. 
---
I personally hope they can be sold when player vendors are added 
---
how much is a massive amount? I have traded and legit received around 14 TSE Hope I'm not next lol.
---
Its all about the buttresses!!!
---
If you have a workshop then there us jo pvp slap damage. I could one shot you with a regular black powder
---
Any weapon could be a dupe. Not just two shot explosives. And if it was a shotgun, you wouldn't even know it was two shot. Quit whineing and making excuses that they had to be cheaters to beat you guys.
---
Very cool!   
---
But Don't think they are taking into account the "player seed" RNG..  
---
Some people seem to have abnormally high / low RNGs and dependent on the server that will result in anything from tons of 2 shots / TSE's dropping for them or a similar odd pattern..
---
Weird. 350+ hours here and no real griefers. What's your user? Happen to team up now and again. I play in the evenings, UK time.
---
Idk if anyone frequents this post anymore, hopefully. But I‚Äôve followed OP‚Äôs steps, and I‚Äôve come out with three different unscrambled words: DEALINGS, LEADINGS, and SIGNALED. Is it common for the codes to unscramble in multiple ways? Cuz that seems like a real gamble, considering if you mess up the code entry, you have to start from scratch, all the way back to getting a new nuclear keycard from a cargobot, which is a nightmare. Any tips?
---
They'd all be using dupes to dupe the dupers
---
Are you sure you weren‚Äôt looking at your stash box? Every train station has one. It‚Äôs your private storage. If you are sure that‚Äôs not what you were looking at, it may have been some friendly player dumping stuff he/she didn‚Äôt need/want that the vendor didn‚Äôt have enough caps to buy
---
good luck with this one dog
---
Jesus, trying to give new people a heart attack lol.  I think I‚Äôd even triple take walking in there
---
Ah yeah. Being a girl on mic really is a whole different experience unfortunately. Was thinking maybe you were a dude who's maybe self concious about his voice or sounded young or something, in which case I'd just be like, hey man be confident with it! Buttt.... unfortunately the amount of gamers that need a more constant female peer presence in their life so they dont act so god damn weird is way too high. I forget what an issue it is as I tend to play stuff like WoW where the social demographic has quite a few more women than average and tends to be a bit older these days. Havent had any kiddos let me know how good my mom is in bed for years now, lol.
---
Guess just getting a mic doesn't solve every problem with communication.
---
I've used strung together emotes to get my point across to decent effect. For trying to say you're a solo player, I'd do the wave emote, confused emote (spinning compass icon replacement, ATOM shop), thumbs down emote, wave emote, then maybe a thumbs up to acknowledge.
---
Talked with a guy not responding to voice who had a 5 cap bounty with the same system to see if he wanted me to kill him so he could see the map without me poking in his bag or whatever. Just sat and watched me, then dis the no emote then wave emote. Multi sentence convo via mime.
---
Not a solution to the problem of course, not everyone is going to interpret it right. Just something I've had success with  in the handfuls of time I've had limited communication. I 100 percent want more emotes. Big games like this usually have tons. I'd like to see more physical display emotes, varied icons, and incorporating some photo mode poses into it. 
---
Or for, you know, utilising reddit for something that people might actually enjoy.
---
Sounds like complaining to me. 
---
When repairing your camp.
---
Walk up to each individual broken item and repair it manually.
---
In my game if I repair all from the camp menu (The thing you place down to make camp.)
---
It cost me three times the amount of materials.
---
I.E. In grafton steel yard the vertibird cost 8 aluminum to repair, IF I go up to it.
---
But If I "Repair All" It says 30 aluminum required..... and it takes all 30 out.
---
Happens in my camp to.
---
Been insanely unstable since the update and one of the first things I did was kill and rebuild the INI files and do a scan and repair.  
---
No change :(
---
Definitely. I find some decent ones, and Beth replies to only a handful of decent ones. 
---
However thats only like 5 percent of all suggestion posts, lol
---
(PC) - Yes! I just lost a X-01 Jetpack, Calibrated Shocks x3, Targeting Hud, Reactive plates, Headlamp Bright, and Optimized bracers x3 plus a few T-60 and Excavator mods including Calibrated Shocks as well. If You cant scrap a Legendary Item, You shouldn't be able to scrap a mod!
---
Nice is debatable. It was almost guaranteed to be a duped item, he or a friend of his probably had a hundred
---
especially when you are trying to place walls against staircases! you need to move it around a bit then put it back or something it‚Äôs really annoying
---
Kill humanoids.
---
Ghouls, Schored, Super-Mutants.
---
They‚Äôve found me again. I‚Äôm hiding in the basement of this house while two Scorch Beasts bombard it with acid. 
---
&gt;I received more than 50 different two shot weapons, sometimes with more than 25 of each weapon. It didn't stop there. I was gifted over 4000 stimpaks, bobbleheads, water, food and much much more.
---
Ban is legitimate. And OP should have known way better.
---
They were just offloading their junk they couldn't sell.  One man's junk is another man's treasure, as they say.
---
It is unrealistic to expect the items to be there because vendor caps take 20-24 hours to reset, and the items in an open world storage container would remain with the server.  You would have to stay in that same server for a full day to get to use the vendor again.  Which would be a feat considering the server would likely crash after a few hours and be gone.
---
This exactly! I had to remove all of the walls just to remove the staircase because I accidental moved a wall, and you can‚Äôt place them back against the staircase. 
---
 There are actually a lot of us players who do that. You can only sell so much and are stuck with lots so I always leave stuff for others
---
Well, at the time of ban I had roughly 70,000 pounds of items in my inventory. I had hundreds of two shots in total quantity and enough aid to supply hundreds of players and still some. Especially my ammo, which was close to 50,000 rounds of each type. I know in comparison to some, my inventory numbers were smaller. Yet, to me, it sure seemed like a massive amount.
---
Doing that but I can‚Äôt leave now. 
---
Eerily accurate in its random terribleness. Except that I got an Urban Scout Armor legendary, and I‚Äôm not even sure those exist in the game (outside of defined quest rewards).
---
Yeah not my stash box. There's usually a suitcase on the bench, near the vendor. Went to two stations and saw a ton of stuff in them.
---
Yeah I said "just shake your head in game. Or you can get a moc for yo broke ass" or something along those lines. Got down voted but eh, 1 guy agreed with me, lol. 
---
I‚Äôm sure they are being very careful what they comment on. 
---
Gamers are so prone to taking things the wrong way or ad a promise or whatever. 
---
Gotta start farming.
---
In terms of lore (a joke post Fallout 4, I know, but stick with me here) you're not using the PipBoy for VATS in power armor. Ever notice the different overlay that comes up for the PipBoy menu in power armor? It's a HUD projected onto your visor. That's the armor taking over, since you can't physically access the PipBoy inside the armor. So yeah, you're draining the suite's power supply for VATS. Now, why you don't need a power supply for the PipBoy, that's an entirely different problem...
---
level 92 now, run this event dozens of times cleared town and it never triggered, gave up on many events as they don't work or at least are not reliable.
---
What are you planning on doing with it?  I have two harpoon guns, a two shot that I put barbed harpoons on and a scope so I could use it as a sniper.  I also have a quad that I put the flechette mod on to use as a shotgun.
---
Thank you for your feedback.
---
So someone gave you 70.000 lbs of duped items and you opened a store to sell them.
---
Sounds like a good ban to me.
---
Doing that but I can‚Äôt leave now.
---
Ranch for sure. I eat it with a ton of different things. 
---
Though french is a good marinade for chicken.
---
No wait Im thinking of italian...
---
&gt; PVP? you guessed it! Its fkn **Melee**. 
---
Oh please do so. I'll just out run you. Since I play mobile characters. High endurance and agility.
---
I only have a few trophies left to achieve the platinum but I stopped playing last year due to the problems I‚Äôm still seeing people post about.
---
Hoping that one day I can return and get that achievement and also enjoy a game that I really liked playing.
---
Lol dude. You're fun, I bet. 
---
All of the heavy weapon machine guns go through ammo quickly except for the gatling. I hit my spots every day and bank up materials for high usage times. 
---
Truthfully, my guns always break before I run out of ammo.

Haven't gotten a single wooden auto stim or a rolling pin.  I'm calling b.s.   I have gotten 2 2shot shotguns in a row.  And nothing I use so that is accurate at least
---
I don't know what the fuck you are describing mate. You are all over the place. Maybe you should edit this and save it on your hard drive and share it with your cat and your dog instead of other human beings? 
---
Nms is gettin more content updates this year too jus fyi!!
---
im a vats/rifle/crit build on ps4, gamertag piwrecks, i can walk u through my build and the reasoning behind it if you like,  5points in gunsmith so i may be able to mod ur weapons better than u currently can.  also, dont forget to use the build calculator website to help with perks and special distribution
---
Lunygunz I‚Äôm playing all the time
---
I believe marathoner does work with power armor, it at least feels different when I forget to add the cards back, action boy is the one that‚Äôs debatable. 
---
The optimized servos mod does make a significant difference, but calibrated servos for carry weight wins out 
---
The card that makes sprinting cost less/no fusion core is worth it after the last patch, before I was dumping power cores all the time, now the drain seems to be about right and I actually have to think about where power is coming from   
---
Cache clearing work for me. Got through SBQ  with minimal freezes. Still have the long loot load times but I didn‚Äôt disconnect.
---
I had this issue as well. Guess I‚Äôll have to try stashing my junk when I get on to play again.  
---
Trash a GameStop?
---
Radscorpions are completely glitched in the game, I shoot one 150 yards out while hidden with my Stealthy Sniper Build, and it instantly teleports right in my face, had it happen so many times, that I now only shoot them with explosive weapons, and only if they're Legendary, otherwise I just sneak on by, and let someone else deal with those glitch things.
---
Read this title as ‚ÄúCan we stop forgetting that the other people on this game are sub-human, too?‚Äù

...And was gonna respond, ‚Äúnot as long as they keep reminding me every single day.‚Äù

Yo mate if you play on Europe hit me up on private chat. Where I'm from I'm likely to get better connection on UK/Ireland servers.

"...the amount of gamers that need a more constant female peer presence in their life so they dont act so god damn weird is way too high."
---
I lol'd hard at this bit, thanks :D
---
What they didn't expect was millions of repeat or terrible ideas. Too bad they may not jave seen some decent ones. Hopefully they did.
---
Yea, both those solutions can definitely help, but its always a 50/50 chance that it will or won't do a damn thing. Typically just shutting down the ps4 fully and powering back up a minute later does help for a little while, but reinstalling takes quite a while and isn't remotely guaranteed to fix it.
---
Still good advice, just don't really expect it to work all the time.
---
I shutdown the ps4 and booted up like 20 minutes ago and I didn't crash again for 20 or so minutes. This update is just fucked.

I can see why plenty of people are having problems with this, but for me 4 years of Fallout 4 has reinforced my trigger discipline to the point where it's maybe happened 3 or 4 ties at most
---
It works with the queen. I have stumbled across bodies I had nothing to do with at Whitesprings I was able to loot. 
---
This is pretty cool and obviously well-thought out. Nice work. The Medusa is interesting, as there does seem to be a complete lack of sea creatures. On the other hand, visibility in water is already so bad that one of the most truly terrifying moments I've had was falling into the flooded areas of Blackwater Mine. Not sure if you can even fight underwater so that could be a non-starter anyway, but it might be over the top to have to battle when you can barely see what's going on.
---
Minus a point for burrowing on the Radger. We don't need more mole rats :)
---
Loot is per player. What you get is different from someone else.
---
Ok, I know for a fact that others have suggested this but, PLEASE make it soo we cannot spawn in nuke zones when we enter a server. I was at the lodges pretty much right outside top of the world and when I loaded in, I was already dead from the radiation.
---
As I tried to respawned nearby, I crashed and when I loaded into another server, ALL my junk was gone and I was still HEAVILY irradiated. 
---
I mean I had no way of knowing someone would nuke there, nor do I know why they nuked there but as a result of no fault of my own, I lit a lot of resources.
---
Regular ps4, and it's around 4 years old. No such issues running other games.
---
Yeah man lost way too many good mods this way. Go straight from the vendor to putting them on your armor
---
Screwing each other for what? What do you get when you "raid" a camp? Tell me, how does it aid your survival to destroy your neighbor's property? It may not be griefing, I'll agree with you there, but seriously, what's the point of ripping apart someone's camp?
---
You don‚Äôt need money for the excavator PA. 
---
You need materials and to go and craft it. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt cost money. 
---
I‚Äôd like a legit reply to this question. People here kind went off on tangents without answering whether or not the use of keyword ciphers was explained in the game.
---
Not entirely accurate; there will be a difference in max condition, meaning that you'll get a larger bonus when you over repair the armor. That said, I don't tend to go in for that level of min-maxing, and will only make a noticeable difference in pvp against someone who does. But it does make a difference. 
---
Yes, some items appear to be impossible to get as loot drop, but I don't really know which ones are such. The Wikis I've read don't seem to be detailed enough yet to include this information.
---
Ahhh.  I had heard that pipe weapons got both bonuses but didn't see a difference and thought it was patched, but I was trying with a revolver - gonna have to investigate the bolt action
---
I hate reddit mobile, I see that someone else commented but I can't read their comment because apparently it doesn't exist on reddit mobile
---
Give me the leather overcoat and hat too, thanks.
---
I used to be just like you, then I took an arrow to the knee.
---
Nope that's just a perk. 
---
And to the ones that like using Fatman when farming Whitesprings.....üñï
---
I'm astonished that people who play on pc have no mic (or claim to).  I thought that was standard.   I've had a mic on every headset since the original cs back in like 2001.
---
So you‚Äôre saying anything dropped period is just ‚Äúdestroyed‚Äù. I can agree with this, half the reason I drop shit anyway.
---
This is awesome just please no giant spiders or new spices of mirelurks.
---
i agree.
---
i ran this the otherday with at least 6 people 'randoms', we had a blast everyone would use tse and kill normal mole miners which is fine there is plenty for everyone to get some xp.
---
when the boss comes out everyone butts the boss with their gun or a low lvl melee weapon and would thumbs up emote once they got a hit.
---
Once everyone was giving thumbs up one of the group would tse the boss and end him and we would all get the loot.
---
Great  Community FO76 is i love it :) thanks guys.
---
 Nope, this happens anywhere in the map not just my camp
---
A long time ago, I was giving one away. Posted on multiple trading venues and not one claimed it, so I ended up just dropping it in the wild. 
---
I would love to know the rationale behind making this plan so ridiculously expensive. I want the neon letters, but I'm not spending all of my caps for one plan.
---
Sure, but the DR bonus from overrepair is just based on percentage, not ‚Äúmax numerical value‚Äù. At least, as best as I can tell it is. If it‚Äôs at 200% overrepair it gets X bonus DR. It doesn‚Äôt care if the max condition is 100 or 150, it cares what percent the overrepair is.
---
It's because I'm an asshole and my comments are generally negative and thus Reddit doesn't prioritize even showing them anymore. I'm probably shadow-banned.
---
No automatic guns in skyrim. 
---
so about a week ago, i put my ps4 into safe mode then hit 'rebuild database', at the recomendation of someone more techy than myself, they did that and also reinstalled the game
---
Not sure why you are specifically looking for Excavator PA, but you have plenty of PA laying around
---
oh shit thats a lot lol
---
Before you move / pull up the pip-boy / do anything!

---
Several direct hits on a Mirelurk Queen, zero effect.
---
PM me man, I got one I don‚Äôt play on ps4 anymore I moved to pc so I don‚Äôt mind giving it away. Also I‚Äôm not sure what level it is but If I have the materials I‚Äôll make a 25 set for you
---
Also one at the brotherhood camp just SE of the city.
---
I put them in the cash register if it's available. At whitesprings I put them in the burlap bag next to the door and tinkerer's workbench
---
I personally think Power Attacks and Gun Bashing are useless. I agree with the idea of a Sprinting Power Attack, but not a stationary one. And Gun Bashing is basically useless because it's damage is so poor (even with Perks and proper Mods). It's decent as an "interrupt" I suppose, but I'd rather just reload and pop a cap in a motherfucker.
---
Exactly! That's why I drop stuff too, the only reason things are dropped I'd either to get rid of it, dupe it, or give it away. We can still use the trade menu to give stuff away, and we can still drop it to get rid of it, But we can't dupe anymore! :) 
---
Same. Last night I had 2/5 scorched detection systems upgraded, and another free states bunker quest, to get 3 chemicals from dyer chemical..   logged in thismorning and they are gone/completed .. 
---
the game is playing itself while im gone?
---
I haven't returned to Abbie's bunker to see if the quest restarts.. just .. wtf man. 
---
I tried nuking monongah the day after that video came out. I traveled over there, found ghouls, figured it was worth a shot.
---
I had about 6 others i invited to go down there as well, quite a few glowing enemies spawned, couple legendaries, then it just died off. I tried re-logging, but only found a couple more enemies after that. I was so hoping for better results, but it was kind of a let down. I had about the same results when i nuked Morgantown, 40-50 glowing enemies and then nothing.
---
I KNOW RIGHT!!! I only did it once to my .45 ammo but still how annoying I had like 700 rounds and was using 2-3 weapons that needed them at the time. 
---
I regularly drop small gifts for new players. Some water, food, stims and radaway. I have too much to sell and they will need it.
---
god doing this just made me depressed...
---
Feels like you re able to have so much more stuff than i m able to use !
---
Anyway, looks dope
---
I think there‚Äôs a fundamental misunderstanding here. Sure, the max condition is higher, but as far as I can tell ALL that means is you have to repair it less often. The overrepair bonus DR is only, as best as I can tell,  related to the PERCENTAGE overrepair. So you won‚Äôt get more DR with an 150 max condition item over repaired to 300, than you would a 100 max condition item overrepaired to 200. At best you will lose the bonus DR slower and have to repair less often because it takes longer for the percentage to drop. 
---
Many people prefer to keep their Excavator due to the +100 carry weight. It‚Äôll take a while, but build it. You also get a Power Amor Station from the quest, so you could save upwards of 4K caps.
---
At Level Up you can select a SPECIAL skill but then a perk card from a different SPECIAL. I wish I would have known this before level 40.
---
Just started playing this weekend. Wasn't aware my camp could be destroyed. 
---
And here I was putting it in a spot that would allow other noobs easy access to my crafting stations. Guess I'll have to stash it away somewhere. 
---
Never had it affect a bot like that.
---
It will, however, aggro your Brahmin by the camp feeders and the brahmin for the Charleston vendor bot, which will make him and the eyebots aggro and refuse to trade with you. :(
---
I've got no problem with it. It's one example of game mechanics working properly. I just Didn't put the two together until I had them both. I saw the difference.
---
Mcnegrata 
---
Not exactly, and this is why I attempted to be as clear as possible. I began with an impressive amount of items and weapons. There's no way I could possibly recall the total weight at the beginning when I received the items. I opened my shop on my own doing, without request from any duplicator. I never received any more items from said duplicator. I used the items I originally received to trade, and from there my inventory really grew, I traded everything under the sun; aid, mods, recipes, and even lots of junk so that players would walk away with new weapons and other items that were highly desired for very low costs. Especially compared to in game venders. Still, I understand your frustration and need to lash out. Thank you for your response.
---
I play using a DDR pad.
---
Crafting bulk scrap can cause the server to lag. I have tested this many times with different people and they have all lagged out. My guess is that if to many people spam craft bulk items it can possibly crash the server.
---
I‚Äôd love to find a two shot hunting rifle with faster reload. :(
---
I can easily agree with that. Typically lonevaultwanderer comments on suggestions he likes or has shared with the dev team. But it would be unrealistic to think he puts his footprint on *every* post he reads. Maybe he even takes bits and pieces from suggestions and shares with the devs. 
---
Circling back to hurting the player's feelings and taking what lonevaultwanderer says the wrong way, maybe if he took only a part of somebody's suggestion and decides to reply about only taking some bits from it, could then hurt the players feelings that his whole suggestion wasn't good enough.
---
Sorry that was a mess. I wish i could put that in fewer words but my brain doesn't want to. XP
---
Right, they do not exist. Also Wood armor legendaries can only drop as 1‚òÖ.
---
Get Gud!.   you cant even wear excavator until 35.
---
good luck.
---
Only if you have marsupial. Without it, you can walk on the rail till you get to the first support tower, but then you can't hop over the top to continue on the rail on the other side.
---
Willing to sell the two shot?
---
&gt;+100 carry weight 
---
200 if you have the calibrated shocks which are absurd lmao. I get almost 500 capacity on my excavator. 
---
You're lucky. It sucks as a nuke zone, generally.
---
yes, i‚Äôm on xbox. I usually run out of lead and ammo cuz i mostly craft .50 and .45 ammo, and by the time i‚Äôm done, i‚Äôm out
---
I mean they're making a PvP server, so they clearly aren't concerned with splitting the base. I say just get rid of the slap mechanic for consentual PvP that neither side likes and have a PvE and PvP server.
---
Umm I can't make it to a train station. My game won't load me in. I'm at my camp.
---
When you drop the nuke, do it so forward station delta is just outside the nuke zone, and then fight the queen from there, I think it‚Äôs a little harder of a fight, but it doesn‚Äôt really give anywhere for people to hide.   I honestly think this is the most ‚Äúfun‚Äù place to drop it, the battle rages, you get multiple phases of attacks and defenses, but the battle takes much longer, it‚Äôs taken till seconds before the end of the event for me before.  
---
Or drop it so drop site V9 is just outside the zone, I think it‚Äôs a much easier fight there, but it does give a lot of places for people to hide.  With the nuke here, if the server has good people in it, the battle will only take a few minutes. 
---
I'm also for the option, short of logging out, of just relinquishing control of a Workshop.  I'm not that fussed about them.  I mean, how can I be?  Between the game's stability and the server's stability, you're going to lose it at some point anyway.
---
Thank you for this.
---
*ching!*
---
The Fireproof perk helps some with that, till an invisible assaultron steps right in front of you.
---
At least now I'm only crippling myself most of the time, instead of instant Death.
---
I'm happy to supply you some of that on PC. I sell radaway, stims and water to traders because I farm so much of it.
---
No, from Asylum.. 
---
No. You can find this in certain spots out in the wild.
---
Sounds similar to Morgan town, maybe more central. Great that you guys are nuking other areas to see from the same old places.
---
I currently have a rifle build that will be broken since its based on rifles and explosive dmg at 114 which felt balanced until now.
---
And another melee build - the melee one is only 51 and already one shotting nearly everything but the queen. So tell me about broken...
---
Now the melee build will be even more OP since no other build can match up. Does this make sense to you? Seriously.
---
These [cases](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Display_case_(Fallout_4)) ? I couldn't find a good fallout 76 picture for them.
---
Just grind it and build it.  not hard,  kill Mole miners at Welsh and pick up broken clipboards.
---
Cool, thanks!
---
Glad to see the ban hammer swinging.
---
The 1:2 million takes that into account. To start, you have a 1:100 for a 3\*, then you have a 1:200 for a handmade, then you have 1:100 for TSE with any 3rd \* effect =  2.000.000
---
Yeah I have no reason to really nuke Whitesprings. I get that there's the loot and it's a great spawn area, but I have a lot more fun nuking random weird areas. Wish Deathclaw Island could be nuked...
---
Are you using the PS4 pro? My son has crashed four times today, he is on a pro. I am not, and have had zero crashes playing at the same time and on the same server.
---
The Enclave's good, we bring order and stability. Thomas Eckhart, on the other hand, was obsessed with personal power (risked his soldiers just so he could call himself "president") had no concerns of consequences (never considered a way of controlling the ScorchBeasts before releasing them) and most importantly, was a traitor to the Enclave (he killed more than half of the Enclave members in the bunker in his take-over)
---
So remember, it's Thomas Eckhart, not the Enclave, who is to blame for West Virginia's current, sad state, and it's the good men and women of the Enclave who will be it's salvation.
---
I'm sorry but a low level character can hold what... maybe 175 pounds worth of stuff and you get 70,000 pounds worth of shit? 
---
You go from punching fucking robots with a ammo less pipe gun to a 24 shot explosive vampire shotgun of the whale?
---
You leave the Vault and have what 20 stimpacks, play 2 or 3 nights and use them all so you are back to farming Fertile Soil for those measly 3 stimpacks as a rewars, but randomly a dude gives you 4000! 
---
Even then it doesn't cross your MIND AT ALL that it's in the wrong? Come on man... 
---
Average Fo76 user: FUCK DUPERS
---
The same User after reading this thread: THANK GAWD FOR DuPeRs
---
I cant use the NukesDragons planner on my mobile device, and this is a non-mutation build which is based on my own playstyle, but I would personally do:
---
STR 12: Shotgunner 3, Expert Shotgunner 3, Master Shotgunner 3, Scattershot 3.
---
PER 12: Rifleman 3, Expert Rifleman 3, Master Rifleman 2, Concentrated Fire 1, Tank Killer 3. I'd also post level 56 pick up Glow Sight 3 to drop in place of Tank Killer for certain events. You might also want to pick up another Master Rifleman 3 for general use when you dont need to target limbs. I guess you could pick up Skeet Shooter 3, but I wouldnt think youd need it since you can swap between rifles and shotguns as needed.
---
END 3: Lead Belly 3. I like ignoring rads when eating or drinking. Also pick up Ghoulish 3 post-56 for rad zones on teams when someone has Rad Sponge.
---
CHA 4: Lone Wanderer 3 (costs 4). Post-56 I'd get Rad sponge 3 for teamy nuke zones.
---
INT 5: Gunsmith 5. Or also grab an extra Gunsmith 3 and Power User 2 if you plan to spend much time in power armor.
---
AGI 14: Action Boy/Girl 3, Enforcer 3, Adrenaline 5, Marathoner 3. Use this config when you want to run-and-gun. When you want to stealth around, run Action Boy/Girl 3, Enforcer 3, Adrenaline 1, Escape Artist 1, Sneak 3, Covert Operative 3.
---
LUC 6: Bloody Mess 3, Tormentor 3.
---
Anyway, your mileage may vary. If you feel like you have to do the mutations thing, pillage 5 points from AGI and put them on LUC for Class Freak 3 and Starched Genes 2. I've become a bit burned out on mutations myself, and I only use them on my main character.
---
Cheers!
---
Or just make it so when you click on a plan it installs and disappears from your inventory like normal. No harm, no foul.
---
I know you are but what am I?
---
Simple fix.
---
If you‚Äôve got a bounty you shouldn‚Äôt be able to trade with any vendors except the raider one(s?).
---
Also, for every 100 caps on your bounty a bounty hunter assaultron should come after you, scaling with level.
---
Amass a 500 cap bounty at level 50?  Enjoy the 5 level 50 assaultrons that commonly spawn nearby.
---
On the other side, they then need to increase (or at least add) rewards for doing the evil stuff in the first place.
---
Contrary to popular belief most do bad stuff out of need, convenience or greed...not just because...the game is lacking that aspect and people clearly want to role play it.
---
To enhance the above there should probably be ‚Äúsettlements‚Äù where there are ‚Äúlots‚Äù you can place your camp at.  The settlements have built in defences surrounding them so it‚Äôs harder for ‚Äúraiders‚Äù who already have a bounty.  When you log into the server, if your lot is taken the game shifts your camp to another lot.
---
None of this will happen, especially the settlement aspect, but it‚Äôs an idea for future releases.
---
300 rolls, 1 3 star, a Furious Fat Man ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ, Damage increased after each consecutive hit on the same target, VATS critical shots do +50% damage, +50 damage resistance while aiming
---
Zoltan 
---
Yeah, the level two ammo crafting almost doubles your output, and then level three super duper puts it well over two depending on how many times it hits. 
---
I also recommend  weapon artisan to repair weapons to 200%. 
---
I‚Äôll be on tomorrow. You can have whatever .45 ammo I have. 
---
after the nerf you will have to pay people to take it my friend.
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs the console and you need to clear your cache. 
---
That is a pretty tricky one. I think your best option may be to shoot down 2 more cargo bots and go into the silo with 3 key cards to try each of the 3 potential codes until one of them works.(Or find 2 other people with key cards)
---
It's kinda tedious, but I can't think of any other solution than going in with 3 key cards, then just guessing.
---
I was having the same problem so I just try and avoid being indoors as much as possible.
---
You're spending your time on a "boring" game, and it makes you happy to make others unhappy. Got it.
---
Show me where on this dictionary the bad man touched you.
---
Yes, I hate lootboxes, and Bethesda going back on their promise to not include lootboxes would hurt this game even further. How is saying that 'hating to hate'. Pro tip: Stop sniffing glue.
---
This is the backlash I expected. Thank you for your feedback.
---
LOL you have 70,000 pounds of items and didn't stop to think for a moment... Is this smart?
---
But then what would they sell us in the Atom shop! :(
---
Reddit gonna Reddit. 
---
Gone, sorry
---
Mostly solo player from level 1 to level 65 (occasionally tagged for a event or two with other players and talked to a few as well) and I enjoyed the game from the beta until now.
---
If you're on the fence about the game, I say you should give it a go and make up your mind later, but since I have a bias on cause I like the game, you may want to check oxhorn's lore videos or matn initial playthroughs and see how you like them.
---
I was really hyped about fallout 76 ever since e3 presentation, bur on the fence about all the stuff I hear when the first beta days came up, bur then took a peek a oxhorn's live playing and matn videos and pre ordered. And I dont regret it one bit. So i think you should give it a go of you can get a cheap key from a retailer or something. It's very fun to play, despite bugs and media (very warranted) hysteria over the state of the game.
---
No, there are a set of grayish and white plastic/metal cases in 76. They are clean and undamaged and use a different model from those. I don't even think we have access to ones in the picture in 76, oddly enough despite them being present in-game.
---
I farm Monster Mash for the legendary ghouls, but I have yet to be awarded a legendary item for completion of a round. I only get heavy combat armor and auto grenade as my items for completing rounds.
---
The robot vendors are kinksters 
---
For this to work you would also have to disable putting things into world containers...
---
Very nice. Definitely illustrates how harmful duping has been to the game considering how rare these weapons should be 
---
Interesting point. Never tried that one before. Thanks for the info.
---
Thanks. I‚Äôll consider that. It‚Äôs just such a CHORE to shoot down cargobots. Not to mention a time/weapon/ammo sink. I think I broke at least 4 different guns shooting at that stupid drone.
---
Huh, given that it was ages ago I crafted base items I'd completely forgotten that they would be created with different length bars, and thus presumably different absolute durability numbers at 100%.
---
Although from what I recall durability bonuses from INT drops off incredibly sharply after 10 or 15 total int.
---
Lol imagine writing all of this. 
---
They might have fixed it. There were some poor bastards before Christmas who would wander into the bunker and all hell would descend on them. Player's narrowed it down to that mutation while diseased without class freak. People had a rude awakening :)
---
This also only applies to a very, very, small part of the game, only when players interact. SBQ, some events, and nuke zone. Any other time, it is just me and my wife exploring and having fun killing shit. I have always been about 20-30 levels above her so when she started, i was dragging her to the ‚Äúbig boy‚Äù places. We died a million times and it almost made her stop playing and go back to destiny...
---
And then that one day......i put a tse pump in her hands. :)
---
She is now level 90 and loves the game more. She named the freaking shotgun. I dare ask her to use anything else because I really don‚Äôt want to use anything else myself. 
---
And....we are not hurting a soul. When we go to any nuke zone, we have 1 weapon, a 3* anti-armor SS. We respect the rules and play nice. Do we see people using tse,yes, but it does not bother us one bit as we just move on to another place. We are also in our late 40s and understand, this is just a game and hopefully those other players are having fun, or letting off stress from work, etc....After all, that is what games are for and why we play. Anything more is just plain childish.
---
Unfortunately, all of the other weapons suck ( prove me wrong ) and just do not compare in any way. If they did, maybe i would see the light!
---
Our biggest accomplishment every time we play is to see who can not blow themselves up with their own gun! She always wins. :(
---
There is hope, though. We, the former residents of Vault 76, are still alive. And depending on what their experiments were, there's up to three unopened Vaults' worth of people who could join us. We just need to nuke the Scorch Beasts into oblivion, and we can start rebuilding. 
---
Because the wasteland has no rules. Story wise we‚Äôre supposed to work together but that doesn‚Äôt mean everyone has to obey that
---
Wow, when I‚Äôll come back to US I hope there will be those restaurants. Good luck! 
---
Even for new players like me, unacknowledged and learning about Fallout 76's huge problems with exploiters, and me never being one of them. Thank you for your feedback.
---
Did this happen on ps4 by any chance?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs such s double standard. People are allowed to always post about their crashes. But if you don‚Äôt experience a lot of crashes people get mad.
---
Ah well.
---
Funny I made a similar thread. Answer is, all builds are trashed by this nerf but the melee build. At least for now. But I‚Äòm sure Bethesda will have a new ‚Äûfix‚Äú for us soon...
---
There would be too many obscene paintings and force a rating of "m" imo. 
---
There are just too many combinations of items, let alone space consumed by useless items (pool cues, golf clubs, etc).  The Notes and Mods offerings at these vendors could be twice as long and still be unsatisfying... but I'd take it over "Radium Rifle."
---
This is not correct. It's +/-15.
---
I have pulled many MANY 3* max-level items from Uranium Fever.
---
Lol every time I get attacked by feral ghouls my mutations unstable isotope and electrically charged seemed to paralyze them alot
---
Wouldn‚Äôt people just fast travel there, and go off somewhere else?  
---
Like let‚Äôs say uranium fever. I‚Äôm at death claw island. I fast travel to the event. For free. Free of weight restrictions. Then I walk over to the vendor like 20 feet from the event and sell all my crap. Or go to white springs. This could be exploited.
---
200?? I sell them for 6 lol
---
Someone may have said it, but safe plans can be found at the Watoga Train Station!
---
Also at the shopping center (I think?).
---
I'll try.
---
true
---
To be completely honest: General Santiago and her men should be remembered for their sacrifice. They attempted to prevent Eckhert's plan from happening but regrettably failed due to that piece of A.I. MODUS. Still I'd Santiago didn't order her men to destroy MODUS's memory banks then Appalachia would at least would've gotten a better chance with the combined forces of the Brotherhood of Steel, Responders and Enclave. Things would've turned out much differently.
---
Damn! How low is your health for that?   Do you keep a lot of ‚Äúrads‚Äù on you at all times to keep your health low? 
---
Doesn‚Äôt the SB screech just kill you all the time? 
---
Xbox 1 s
---
Disconnects still happening...alot it's really bad
---
We should have some kind of book ingame that tells us the materials we need to craft an "x" item,
---
For example an t45 power armor. 
---
YES the stacking of magazines and Bobs should never have happened. They probably left it because its rare enough to get multiples they probably never even considered it. 
---
As for TSE they are no longer rewards for playing a long time. They are one of the most common guns in the game. Not the fault of the players, but thanks to Dupers/Exploiters they desperately need to be nerfed. I've been hunting one for my entire 300 hours and never got one to drop (RNG gods Hate me lol). I was hoping to have one as my end game god tier weapon. Now you can buy them on any social site and pay real money for them on ebay and others. Its just sad.
---
yeah, only problem is: Melee only is boring. The diversity was what made the game fun. But after the TSE nerf there won‚Äôt be another viable option.
---
I've gotten a lvl 45 handmade and that's the only thing higher than 40 that I've gotten.
---
Xbox my dude. 
---
Capture all 3. Or at least Poseidon. Since the enemies are easy as hell. Place a lock in the core generator. Then go off and launch a nuke. Or something time consuming. Come back. Boom. You got a bunch of cores. I do this everyday maybe 2-3 times. I got like 100 cores lol.
---
Could be but with all the exploits available as is... It's not a very big one... And it would increase the number of people at events... Like I said it's just a thought
---
Damn 
---
Doesn't help me in RL.
---
That's all I'm sayin.
---
huh... i've had that mutation since well befor x-mas, but never without class freak. Bad neighborhood to have the 'kick me' aggro sign taped to your back.
---
I'll join you. I run a rifle/shotty build. I mostly solo, but like to team up to log back into the same world and defend workshops. Tag: RummyBehr
---
In a land with no governing.. and a bunch of random people left to their own devices. People don't change.. they were always the same. 
---
Not being governed by laws and rules allows people do as they please with no consequences.
---
Yeah dude given the best weapons in the game 70,000 pounds worth of stuff sorry but you had to know something was going to happen sooner or later that's just kind of ridiculous. It's like running around with bags of cash that some bank robber hands you and then acting like you're surprised when the cops start pointing guns LOL.. I'd say You have about one in a thousand chance of having your Banning be reversed.
---
I don't personally use this build but you could probably find a guide on it. I only know it because a friend was showing off her unarmed damage. She uses Unyielding with Sentinel's armor to take basically no damage when standing still
---
Maybe the radiation affected everyone's brains and made us want to attack each other.
---
I erased my original post because as I reread it, I didn't want to come off as mean but people that dupe are ruining a game I genuinely want to see succeed. So with that, I think you knew this was wrong and if you do come back I hope you delete that character and start from scratch. 
---
Honestly 10/10 idea 
---
Doh!  Just checked - either I did sell it or it disappeared.  Sorry :(
---
&gt; Would be nice sure, but I wish they would just fix the root issue. If they would properly tag plans we've already learned, there would be no need to even pick them up.
---
Whoa now...we can't be logical here.
---
for sure
---
And Scorchbeasts?  I thought not.
---
Besides, by the time I run over to the enemy to stab it, chances are some Level 100+ TSE user has already blown it up.
---
Do events.
---
I don't know man 25 years in an small space terrified about my past life gone and everyone else in it might be gone. Also being around people that I might like and hate acting civil just to endure 25 years till freedom... yeah I may not be the most sane person after that life altering event. Then stepping into a world full of disorder chaos and the need to survive. I don't think you thought that one out man.
---
I‚Äôve managed to find a compromise, doing work on laptop and keeping an eye on screen for the cores to appear, every 5 mins touching controller lol
---
Lad?
---
I hear ya and the downvote thing is utterly ridiculous.
---
While I can‚Äôt say how widespread the disconnect issue is I‚Äôve got about 8 folk, including myself, who run with regularly.  To the point where we fill PS party and have to kick some players as we run 2 full teams.  We average 3-4 sessions a week and can go as long as 4 hours is a session.  I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs roughly 3 disconnects per session.  Which ain‚Äôt good, but ain‚Äôt too bad either.  
---
This is of corse not counting the 3 Scorch Beast attacks which damn near ensures a full teams worth will crash, freeze or disconnect.
---
that's the only one obtainable in game as it is, actually. steer clear from the others.
---
I tried selling my extras to new players for 1 cap each for about a week.  However, the trading system is so NOT user friendly that noone knew what was happening so they just canceled out and walked away.
---
I'm not frustrated at all, nor I need to lash out. I simply expressed my opinion; that I think the ban is deserved. You traded items that you knew came from an exploit. 
---
no. There is an easy workaround: Just complain long enough and Bethesda will nerf it. For sure.
---
Op is weak trash. 
---
 Not really.  There‚Äôs not much to pve-wise.  Pvp can be fun.  Bounties generally attract pvpers, and you get bounties from attacking bases.  Considering that you can click a button on your camp device and repair your entire base for minimal resources, I don‚Äôt think getting their base attached is ruining anyone‚Äôs day.  And in a game with pvp content, if getting your base attached is going to ruin your day then you need to spend some of your budget on defenses, place camp in a more remote place, or guard it yourself.  
---
I start the bid at 100 caps.
---
My Vault-tec power armor looks like normal x-1 power armor or I did not manage to see differences.
---
You use electromagnetic fields to propel the projectile. Grounded dampens electricity around you. Weaker electromagnetic field, weaker propulsion, less damage.
---
Someone nuked it in my server, I was the only one to show up. The dude who nuked it didn't even bother, even solo it was very uneventful, but hey a shit ton of flux. 
---
No, we weren't civil. We were so competitive someone lost a tooth over the "Best dental hygiene" award. It's actually cool how they weaved the multiplayer tension into the vault 76 lore
---
Yes, ever since they "fixed" infinite loading...
---
If you can learn how to use it, the 40% more powerful power attack is crazy strong, l have an  executioners grognack axe with that and if I hit a 68 super mutant with the power attack it almost always brings them down below 50% so the executioners part can finish them off.  
---
Also found at the train yard just above WhiteSpring
---
... hold on. We don't show up on the map if we're in stealth mode?? How did I not know this?
---
people in real live have lost people and live alone in small spaces. but that could affect different people differently.
---
Because what they said in no way implied or could even hint at loot boxes. You literally pulled it out of left field because you were looking for it. It simply implies a reward. That's it. 
---
&gt;But what I can't STAND is when people try to tell us that we are completely wrong in liking the game.
---
I am sorry, but you are the perfect `customer identifies with product` type.  
---
Criticism, no matter how valid, is an attack on you. It's not feedback to Bethesda, it's people telling you that you are wrong for liking the game.
---
&gt;bugs are somehow only a problem now.
---
Bugs in multiplayer games are a potential problem for everyone on the server. Server stability is key for a good experience. If the server/game crashes during a quest or the SBQ fight a lot of progress is lost. So yes, they are a bigger problem, not to mention the new limits on mods to fix them.
---
&gt;even though they have been in every bethesda game, are somehow only a problem now
---
They were always a problem and brought down review scores of Fallout/Bethesda games.
---
&gt;Nobody complains when New Vegas constantly crashes 
---
That's denying reality. Obsidian missed the 85% mark on [metacritics](https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas) and can still read that being buggy was a major factor. If you ask on r/Fallout if you should buy NV on steam, everyone will scream that you should get it patched from GOG.
---
&gt;And players LITERALLY HACKING INTO THE GAME TO GET ITEMS?
---
Well, it is against TOS and COC. But leaving the dev room on the production server, that's... I hope there is a intern to blame for that.
---
I'd like a gold outfit too 
---
I am a classically trained pirate!
---
All good man appreciate the offer either way 
---
I play on PC and I use a controller. Fallout 76 was clearly intended as a casual game. Was that not clear?
---
You are correct, I carry a few guns on me... if there are other players around I tend to use a gun that will take a few more hits but will allow others to target and hit the enemy atleast once. If I am alone I will use my TSE gun or other high powered gun to drop them fast.
---
I have had countless characters in the past on numerous Fallout games be overcumbered with massive amounts of items in my home, in containers and more. I'm surprised people aren't thinking that someone coming from Fallout 4 and earlier to Fallout 76 wouldn't be concerned about building a huge inventory, especially when "mules" are so common on a huge number of very popular games. The majority of the feedback I'm receiving certainly sounds like jealous players who are glad others are being punished for wanting to play a game to their own play style. 
---
The point remains I have never exploited and never had any intent. Thank you for your feedback.
---
I love walking away and a few minutes later the XP starts rolling in. 
---
Thanks, adjusted the loot table and ruled out multi-star wooden armors.
---
very true.
---
r/theydidthemath
---
damn you, why couldnt this be 2 hours later and im off work. Fuck!
---
Been hunting for days lol
---
What is the HP cap?
---
Don‚Äôt put your camp in Whitesprings then. 
---
I do them every day.
---
Also the lightning bugs are sooo bad
---
You're good my dude
---
You don't spawn at the C.A.M.P, but it does effect your spawn location. Just move it around and fast travel back to your camp. All you can do is try it repeatedly until you're satisfied with the results. 
---
Kill those low level players outta existence 
---
I find I tend to get rewards more from Scorched Earth being completed than from the Queen.  9 times out of 10, the Queen is either in a perpetual load/no loot, or it has something completely useless like three missiles.
---
Lucky! Would you be willing to trade for a single-action revolver ivory grip plan??
---
On that note of "never seen robots do that." It may have been my vampiric, 40%faster swing, poisoning machete that made me nigh invincible in a nuke bunker that led to a recent...adjustment. Sorry about that. They made a magic wand. I just used it...a lot!
---
I tought it was wind chimes :D
---
Disconnects are really bad. Happening often. Not sure where to post this. Since last patch freezing, disconnects then spawning in nuked zone, loosing progress so not saving, reloading, reloading, reloading  ... did I say reloading yet? It is super frustrating to get through something then get disconnected and have to start over.
---
On a slightly related note, why do the enemies only spawn there at level 40 for me? I know I've seen em spawn higher but I have no idea why. My characters are well about the point at which the should be able to deal with them (I have a 65 explosive build and an 85 rifle build)
---
*spams the power attack key trying to eek out one more as fast as possible* Game engine interprets as a grenade throw. (Mind = blown)
---
Thank you for proving my point. Doesnt bother me to have someone reinforce what I'm saying.
---
I done the rebuild database for a few other games. It's really a mixed bag of results, and hasn't done much for me.
---
As you should :-) Why farm legendary? Just enjoy the game and its quests before switching to a boring farming area. 
---
I think we should be saying, what a reason to play. He finds nothing good with the game except for stashing caps.
---
Half of the things you mention steady are things. I‚Äôm confused. 
---
Thanks for making this post. The ‚Äûfix‚Äú will break all endgame builds that are not melee. And since melee was way too powerful (i have myself a melee as a second) it will be even more ridiculous after this patch. With no alternative. So all melees will laugh their a..s off
---
You try being civilized to 100% of people for 25 years. 
---
If I had to be civil to half the people I encounter in my day to day life, I would become a raider in no time. 
---
Accepted a team invite and he went his own way. 
---
Makes perfect sense.
---
If it weren‚Äôt for laws I‚Äôd kill everyone I grew up with.
---
I‚Äôd kill you too OP, because I hate your face
---
In my experience around the camp normally, my turrets took care of animals. But believe whatever you like.
---
Inside the vault, everything was provided: a room, a bed, food, water... Now they're all competing for resources. Mostly they can spread out and ignore each other, but when they cross paths, things happen.
---
yeah, like that is going to happen.
---
You need an introvert symbol because you are obviously too nervous to just ask.
---
True, server stability (or lack of) means that workshops are a hobby.  But if I'd known, I'd have stayed cloaked, broke out my best weapon and headshot him when he claimed the workshop :).  This could all be solved by Bethesda changing the wording of the dialogue box to tell you factually what happens.  
---
Only way to play!
---
Mods get scrapped from your inventory and stash, use them before you lose them, don't repair anything or pay attention to what is used to repair. This will be fixed in the next update. mods will no longer be scrapped.
---
They need to make a mechanic where he shoots a flare every half hour or so.
---
Can level 4 and under attack it?
---
wait a couple of days and people will pay you to take it after the nerf m8
---
If you had read closely you would have learned that I did not trade exploited items purposefully, that after many trades I learned from others about what the Fallout community was under going. Only because of the strong amount  of positive feedback I received did I continue. I do believe, someone whom is not frustrated nor needs to lash out could consider this situation. Thank you.
---
I still get a chuckle whenever Super Mutants drop Loose Screws.
---
I usually drop them in a world container at the nearest train station... unless I'm farming a whitesprings nuke, then it's just in bags out front.
---
Xbox one S the rad resistance perk on legendary armor isn‚Äôt working please fix
---
‚ÄúDelete your CAMP and stored items‚Äù. Are you fucking kidding me?! Just stop. You deserved downvotes. Don‚Äôt try to beg for them. 
---
I said the same thing when the game came out
---
Previous FO games != FO76 game.  
---
Sorry nobody hear to blame but yourself. G'luck though with Beth.
---
And I've got him again of anyone reads this. 
---
Thank you for second guessing your wording. I do understand the fault tied to the ban. If said ban is lifted, you better believe I am running far away from anything that makes others believe I am anything more than an honest, and die-hard fallout fan without the need for exploits.
---
I want these symbols in real life.
---
Thank you kindly for your opinion.
---
I wonder if they persist after you log out. 
---
Well that's not surprising, he even sounds like he's that scummy. I remember when he used to make Borderlands vids
---
I wasn't aware that bounties came out of the wanted person's cap stash or that the bounty was based on damage done to a camp.  Just seems like most people's bounties are really low, so figured it was just free money to encourage pvp.
---
I am quite against the TSE nerf because there currently is no alternative solution. BUT if they would rebalance all weapons / builds. Yes that would be okay. 
---
I like the idea
---
That's true but also nobody is around to enforce punishment for your actions unless the person your committing crimes against turns to defend themself. And yeah people handle things differently but that need to survive can really make you do things you might not have been capable of or even wanted to do before. Desperate times and all that.
---
You‚Äôre very welcome. 
---
I don‚Äôt hate you, I hate pvp in this game, And I am not playing it for pvp. I loved WAR and played it solely for pvp and rvr.
---
This is about destroying someone‚Äôs camp to force them into pvp. And, in most cases trying to steal their junk . And that is griefing. If you really think pvp in this game is challenging I have bad news for you. It‚Äôs not. 
---
So., you can play the game the way you want as long as it doesn‚Äôt interfere with howI want to spend my time ingame. And the only way it seems to do that is to separate those experiences. 
---
Of course, if you rather have all that don‚Äôt share your vision leave, the game is dead. 
---
Agreed.  I can be guilty of this if I don't know the other person is there (stealth build which can 1-shot from chameleon).  So if you are going into an event then change your settings to broadcast or if you don't have a mic, make sure everyone knows you are there.  
---
Try delete and re download, probably your network connection or connect to the M$ servers. Check the live status or your network screen to make sure you have no service issues in your area. On the network tab in your settings, it will tell if there are currently network interruptions.
---
If you on wifi maybe try temporary hook it up to a hard wire.
---
Because war... war never changes.
---
Sooooo good, but the creatures must make sense in the enviroment
---
A bitch. 
---
yep. 75-80% dmg reduction. so no other endgame build than melee is possible
---
Ah. I see.
---
It says it's for the hunting rifle...
---
Or have your camp next to the train station like me!
---
It‚Äôs perfectly situated for cheap fast travel to watoga whereas vault 76 provides cheap fast travel to the jail and Grafton 
---
The only other person I blamed besides myself, were the people taking advantage of new, unknowledged players. Thanks for the luck.
---
Never heard of, "Hope for the best, expect the worst?" That's a fact of life.
---
Come on! It's at least 15k
---
Yeah, this is such a "first world problem" kind of complaint.  I've rarely had more than 1,000 Caps on me.  I don't know what people are doing to get 25,000.  The vendors alone allow you to get maybe, what, 1,200 Caps a day if you ran them out?
---
I don't think its the effect of the seed on a proper pRNG, but changing the loot table entry chances can increase the likelihood of drops. Also it is possible there is another per-player chance (like 1-5%) for some, that when met, there is a different loot table with only high-utility items.
---
One would need to meticulously record each drop from a larger player base to infer the item chances and/or correlations.
---
I'll give two of them!
---
Yes yes yes.
---
Not sure yet. So far the only person to shoot it was a level 7. 
---
It ended unwell. 
---
You'd still benefit from extra maximum condition, since the extra DR will last longer.
---
I always drop ammo and chems at suitcases at Charleston and white springs. since BGS hasn't given me any other way to help people besides ... ugh ... talking to them. 
---
look forward to empty servers. The next patch will kill all endgame builds but melee ones
---
at the top of lookout towers you can "survey area" (look around) and it will add unvisited icons of locations near to the tower 
---
I‚Äôd die laughing 
---
Never trust wastealanders, you should of asked for caps as a temporary reassurance in case .. humans are scum
---
If it‚Äôs in Whitesprings, it deserves to be demolished. 
---
I honestly don‚Äôt think anyone thought at all when taking this decision. 
---
SOLD! lol
---
But you could be banned for using any mods so keep that in mind.
---
Honestly, not knowing whether someone would fight you or try to give you presents is the best part of running into someone new though.
---
You can use a compositor to overlay your external chat program's output over Fallout's window.
---
Yeah.. one that you play with friends and internet strangers, which is why a text chat is pretty standard these days because .. you know.. communication is nice when you play with others..
---
Hehe. Nah, I just like information. My friends would probably die if they heard someone called me an introvert. I am more of an attention seeker. Kinda.  
---
;-) 
---
There should really be some kind of way to regulate actual item-for-item trades, instead of just setting them to 0 caps and going on the honor system.
---
forget it. It will be worthless next week after the patch
---
My girlfriend and I have started fast traveling back when we see people in the area so that we can keep them safe. Not many people seem to realize it's tamed. 
---
Also live there. Black titanium deposit :)
---
Np, if you didn't already also make sure to remove the Explosive attribute as possible drops from explosive weapons (M79, Auto GL, Broadsider, Missile Launcher, Fat Man)
---
And then Black Powder weapons are the only weapons in the game that can't have the Double/Quad attribute.
---
I usually kite them around the room and drag them in front of other players so they see the mob, cause I hate when other people just two shot them and I can‚Äôt get loot 
---
Dupers think if they post a really long BS story, people will believe they got 70k lbs of Legendaries by accident. Just shut up and take your ban!
---
If I'm doing an even trade with someone, we'll agree on an exorbitant amount of caps the first person pays as a security deposit. The other then pays that back for whatever it is.
---
You on PS4?
---
Ya a level 7 noob ain‚Äôt gonna think about it.  Just scream and shoot
---
Camouflage, patterned, hot rod... same stuff they are now?
---
Well, I totally feel your pain. Usually the game treats me the same... But, today was a miracle:
---
I played for 6 hours, multiple nuke zones, 2 times whitesprings, and 2 SB queens (in the same server!!) because the game didn't disconnect or crash even once. Even the stuttering that's been plaguing me badly was pretty much nonexistent!
---
Now, I'm low on radaway, stimpaks, ammo and materials to make ammo and repair my weapons, but goddamn I had a blast today!
---
+ the queen gave me a 3 star 2 shot explosive gauss rifle! Yay!
---
Right? Almost everything i've seen people complain about regarding lore has an explanation, people just arent willing to read the termunals and notes i guess.
---
Report him to all the trade discords, they usually have a section for that
---
Oh, I have considered it. And I have arrived to the conclussion that, unless someone is purposefully playing ignorant, they should realize that is not normal to have thousands of pounds in weapons and materials, when your personal carrying capacity is 300-400 at most and your stash box capacity is 600lbs.
---
So don't play ignorant. You knew perfectly that wasn't normal - you even said it yourself that you had suspicions, but you proceeded anyway.
---
Again, I'm glad Bethesda is banning exploiters and their collaborators.
---
Oh just saw you are. I can make you a suit of X01 for a reasonable price if you want. I'm usually broke as well, I totally get it.
---
No, you‚Äôre just complaining. Want a more immersive experience? Deal with the Raiders.
---
OP casually forgetting that West Virginia is not a city 
---
loosing a tooth over a competition isn't being uncivil it's  being competitive 
---
No. I‚Äôve only had to repair it once. It just has a lot of durability. 
---
It would still be a cancer ridden spamfest, even moreso because people would need to run up on you to spam their adverts.
---
The glitching into the ceiling is pretty weird, I wonder if there is anything useful you can do?  Best I ever did was fall over the side? And back downstairs to the reactor, it took me a while to get re-oriented 
---
Nah it‚Äôs just really good lol. I went a while without repairing it as well.
---
Did you have high INT when you made it?
---
This has been suggested so many times. Bethesda is award we want this,
---
I drop stuff in for randoms because of stash space. I have a select set of weapons and I leave other ammo around train stations for other peeps.
---
Agreed, someone should also be able to not not give an answer in either direction, leaving either a blank gap where the symbol would be, or maybe a  neutral or undecided symbol as a middleground.
---
Some of the legendary Rad Resist pieces literally do not have rad resistance
---
The robots had been hacked to extend the ‚Äúguests‚Äù stay indefinitely (so they wouldn‚Äôt throw the people out) 
---
BUT
---
The people couldn‚Äôt override the programming that meant the robots would close the resort for remodelling.
---
Come the date the robots would, forcibly if required, eject all the guests and staff for the renovations to take place.
---
So it was either leave peacefully or stay and fight sentry bots and assaultrons for the people.
---
So almost certain death versus certain death.
---
A bunch of the people took over the golf club as it was less defended by robots and that‚Äôs where the ghouls come from.
---
Others hung around the grounds and that‚Äôs the other ghouls.
---
The rest left and died in various ways and you can find notes and holotapes throughout the game about this
---
Nah, I was just stuck for about 10 seconds and then fell out
---
I was thinking of starting a new character to do exactly this and try out some new stuff.  What do you recommend as a level-up-quick regimen (just to 40ish or 50ish)?
---
It's pretty uncivil to pop someone in the mouth because they won the award over you, ha
---
I personally think we're on the cusp of a bit of a social movement when it comes to how we compose ourselves online. Nastiness online made more sense when it was mostly anonymous. It was a separate entity to your daily life, even if you spent all day on it. You could always step away from it and detach for your own well being.
---
Now, literally everyone has a LARGE portion of their social and emotional attachments filtered through social media tech and interaction. From your technophobe mom to your cousin that changed his grades in the school system and got suspended. It's not a niche community anymore, it's a full social space with people from all over the spectrum. 
---
Only problem is, when everyone and their damn dog got online and settled in, they adopted the normal vernacular and approach the internet had cultivated in anonymity for years. The way people flame in forums started happening on facebook pages with names and pictures attached. What I find super dangerous about this is the fact that these people don't grasp *why* the internet interacted the way it did, and why the way they're doing it is different and not acceptable. 
---
Being socially responsible in a tech space has become a super magnified issue with how the world is all socially topsy-turvy. We naturally place greater importance these days on how we're treated online as we now all have experience with real life interacting directly with that social media. Someone talking shit about your mom online 10 years ago does NOT hold the same weight as someone doing it today. It sounds overly-sensitive, but is it? The world is only going to get more and more digital. I can't see a cultural regression from tech happening without serious world issues. 
---
People are grumbling more, and in a different way, about online etiquette and how we treat other people online. Social standards need to catch up a bit to tech. It doesn't need extra moderation or anything. Nor does it need people to silence their voice or opinion in an effort to be kind. It would take focused effort by the community to start talking about it more and getting things to move in the right direction. Gamers are some of the most quick to mobilize sub-groups out there. I can see it happening. Especially with gamers who grew up fully inundated by tech are hitting ages where they're having kids of their own. The sphere of people that have first hand experience with understanding the odd online social demographic is getting bigger and bigger. I think sooner than later people are going to start to get the message a bit more.
---
lmao this is what I love about this game, not only are there people like me and other who want to be traders, but there are people willing to be the supply company for those traders!
---
I have a suit of x-01. I was buying a suit that had a jetpack and calibrated shocks
---
Thanks though
---
Aha! Thanks - have mostly avoided whitesprings since it was almost always nuked, but since the recent patch it hasn‚Äôt been quite so popular so might actually be able to explore a little.
---
At a lower level it is fine, only a few things do a lot of damage to do like the bears will shred it .. take on a few bears and see how it holds up .. most other things it stands up really well
---
The emotes work well enough and public text chat has always been a cancer ridden spamfest in every MMO ever made so I don't miss it at all.
---
[Randomness is random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP-Ipsat90c). Streaks are possible and in the game I've gotten get the same prefixes from consecutive legendaries in Watoga.
---
Oh ok, nm then! I still have no mods for mine :(
---
No I'm not, you're right.  In an earlier post I mentioned I was a comp physics and data scientist, so as a programmer I'm def out of my element on this topic.  But, my point still stands.  Assuming a single server handles the direction of player traffic across many servers, it's potential to overpopulate a specific server through accumulative error remains the same.    
---
And I use the word error here lightly, the issue is more so that what a player is going to do after a d/c or logout is unknown.  All the server can do is give them a wait timer and assume the population will recover, and assign traffic elsewhere in the mean time based on that assumption.  That is the source of potential error.  Variables that affect potential for accumulation are, total current population, number of servers, number of virtual machines/worlds, wait timer, average time between faulty disconnects, average time between player login/logout, and distribution of average playing times among all players, probably something else I didn't think of, etc.
---
Could be the total population irregularities are insignificant.  No idea lol.  I do at least know that uneven distribution of work generally causes more problems.  And holy crap, the last thing Bethesda needs are more problems.  
---
How'd you come to be network management specialist?  Do you work for a large business and work on just their machines or are you part of a business that addresses several companies?  I'm just curious, so you know.
---
That‚Äôs the best part! I rack up a bounty, stash all my junk, and then just fast travel around as random people come try to claim it. It‚Äôs rad too when people will spend over 200 caps just fast traveling to me to only claim a 50/100 bounty.
---
No, that's not the case. It's this type of backlash that inspired me to explain my story. I did not have any desire of explaining myself to the public before I had read so many cruel and spiteful remarks directed to so many. I considered that many were most likely guilty of exploiting, however that was not my situation. I have taken my ban, but I doubt I'll shut up because someone thinks they can speak the truth better than me when they were not involved. Thank you.
---
LOL true very true. that being said I wouldn't want to kill them. I wouldn't wish my worst enemy dead, but that is just me. Now If they forced me to that is another story. I'll defend myself, but I'm not going to be the cause of it.
---
Do u have a link to the trade discords
---
totally agreed. But is nerfing them the solution?
---
What they should do is take a hard look on all weapon types and builds and rebalance them all. But they won‚Äôt and that nerf is going to break all builds apart of melees. Probably they will nerf melee as well soon.
---
The ideal solution would be: 1) patch the duping, remove stacking bh, magazines
---
2) introduce a new tier of endgame weapons (non-dupable)
---
Thanks everyone. I'm out of lead and really want to keep my junk. Stash Box is full and needs culling for sure. :-)  
---
I should be on one of those reality shows being shamed as a hoarder lol
---
I was all by myself in there last night. Lot of hopping running and shooting and flailing with the blades, but I lived!
---
It's a graphical bug that's been  in since beta. It doesn't actually remove your ammo thankfully!
---
Okay, some quick do's and dont's and an explanation at the end on how to get SB/SBQ to land quickly + reliably.
---
Don'ts-
---
Do not use a weapon with stagger perks while she is in the air ( the stagger overwrites the landing sequence, meaning she wont land if you keep staggering)
---
Do not hide in the shack, even if your a low lvl and cannot hurt the queen much, take out ads affecting the heavy gunners, any time that heavy damage has to pull off the queen to deal with ads increases the chance of failure.
---
Do not rely on melee completely, unless you do some serious mopping of adds while she is in the air, its better to bring a back up weapon and take the fight to her in the air.
---
Do's-
---
Put pacifisit mode on, it will save you tons of issues and lost junk.
---
Cryolater + stagger on the ground are amazing, I have been in a couple SBQ fights with somone with a cryolater, where the queen lands once and never leaves the ground.
---
Explosive shotgun + enforcer, hip shots to the shoulders cripple the wings and shots to the neck can disable the screech. Explosive helps max out range.
---
Be aware if your surroundings, take care not to run infront of people, if they have explosive weapons you will likely kill them. Also falling into the fissure means you lost all your loot so be careful.
---
**I did not do the testing, I would credit the original reddit author if I knew who they were, they found the sequence, and I have tested and found it working many times**
---
One of the biggest things I have found to get Scorched Beasts to land reliably is to find and keep yourself in a large open area when fighting a SB. I like to find an area almost twice the size of the SB with little to no tree's, trenches, rocky outcroppings, buildings or ground clutter.
---
They have a sequence when they are crippled where they look for a place to land, but they will not fall out of the air or automatically land. The sequence goes -&gt; you cripple, it looks for a place to land (&lt;1/2second) -&gt; if no place to land is available it goes into a 2-3 burst sonic attack -&gt; than it checks again for a place to land (&lt;1/2 second) and if no place again, it goes  right back into a sonic screem and will continue this pattern of checking/attacking until it either finds a place to land or the limb is no longer crippled ie unending sonic scream.
---
PA helps immensly to fight SB's, the dense/padded mods are supposed to help aswell. I generally use an AA/E (anti-armor/exposive) shotgun because the explosive affix greatly increases its range, paired up with a max lvl enforcer perk. It takes me 4-12 shots to land a SB and I finish the buggers off when they land with my black diamond pair with incissor.
---
Trying to find cover can actually decrease the chances of getting the SB to land or they land a long ways away from you. Side stepping and the marsupial mutation make it easier to avoid the sonic spam. With marsupial, think of the attack as a right angle triangle and you want to jump above the toe of the triangle.
---
Hope this helps, and feel free to ask me to clarify if needed.
---
Is that a decent build? I want to do melee/rifleman but I was afraid that putting so many points into perception and the rifleman perks would make me less "specced" for melee. 
---
Also what melee weapon do you use, if you don't mind me asking?
---
Reduce the number of enemies and improve the AI for God sake, like the game but man come on... 
---
I don't even care about splitting it, just make it so certain boxes only display certain categories.
---
Ultracite explosive vent deals more damage for each UEV plan you have in inventory. That's why they always drop from scorchbeast queen
---
If they are lucky the heart attack will get them before the Deathclaw
---
I have crashed more since the most recent patch than all the months preceeding it.
---
It seems especially likely to happen during events, and almost a 50/50 chance during nuke events.

So safe to say someone glitched inside there and just had fun. Interesting 
---
haha i've never see it do that
---
True, Fighting over resources I can see, but killing someone for no other reason than just cause they want to is something different.
---
When modding the set, it has a Paint category, I bet there are skins but they are going to trickle them out to us like some kind of reward or something.  I wish that kind of content was just available right now, I hate this kind of fake slow-release.
---
It only occurs at Blackwater mine, so you keep an eye on the map.  It's pretty frequent.  Just check that site whenever you're traveling for any reason and if it's on, take 10 mins to go do it.

not a network connection prob I‚Äôm playing 76 all day every day on the pc and Xbox is wired to the same connection right here

You knew none of that stuff was legit. That didn't stop you from taking 70k lbs of it and reselling it though, did it? I don't even believe that some one else gave you those items. I will bet my left nut you duped them yourself. So I say again, just shut up and yake your ban. You deserved it.

Fact

Good Answer.

While we are on the topic, what are we dressing our Park Rangers in that is nearly as expensive as a spacesuit?  No wonder we can't keep the National Parks open.

Pharma Farma 3 is a good way to make money.

They're given during the first few main quests, and otherwise during events where they seem to have an priority.
---
It would also be great if the in game option to send a message, sent it to our pipboys and not our consoles. A simple "wanna group" message or "looking to trade?" via pipboy would fit the immersion so well. 
---
It's more sarcasm sorry forgot the /s
---
People try to drop what they can't sell in places where other players can find it.
---
None of it's safe storage, since the game frequently resets containers and deletes paper bags, but some chance is better than none.
---
I got 2 3star legendary weapons at level 40, one is a ghoul Slayer pitchfork that one hit kills charred ghouls.  I'm pretty happy with it.

I suspected launchers can't get it so I coded that way. I didn't know about BP though, I'll update it too. I also assume The Dragon can't be double/quad either. Interestingly, I got a Double Double-barrel shotgun in game 1.5 months ago so that's a thing, even though makes no sense.
---
I see your post is a week old, but dang it don't I agree with you. There's all this talk about increasing the stash limit, but running out of stash space is a symptom of the problem which is that there is no outlet for resources. With low vendor cap limits, there is no way to sell your extra resources for caps, only to hit an eventual 25,000 cap limit, and there is no place to invest your resources. 
---
A month ago I posted an idea about re-working workshops to make them worth capturing via an investment type of system.
---
[Here is the link to my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a3f1tm/i_think_im_done_with_workshops_until_they_get_a/)
---
Simply put, workshops start off with zero resources and players invest their salvaged materials into them while also being able to save their builds. It would be very similar to the workshop system in Fallout 4 where you had an outlet for your materials. 
---
Since writing the above post, I have not really done anything with workshops, no matter how much I actually want to build something and use the resources I've collected. There was one instance this weekend where I claimed a workshop, built all the random crap that the weekly challenge wanted me to build (literally 10 water pumps in a row and 20 scattered light bulbs, wtf). Not 5 minutes after finishing everything up I get disconnected from the server as is typical. 
---
Anyway, thought you might be interested in a read. It's such a shame and waste of potential with the current underdeveloped system. 
---
Dumb thought, but does the radiation heal her perhaps? Or atleast buff her someone.
---
I almost wanna try using that perception vats perk to check her DR/ER inside and outside of the nuke zone.
---
Yeah, I remember the posts. "No matter what server I go to...game is broke!" Followed by "take a disease cure or drop that mutation." That was before I even decided to play with mutations.
---
Can a camp spawn inside of a blast zone and avoid damage?? Need to know for my turret tower pet build.
---
If they decide to do it, then when it‚Äôs ready.
---
Go trade with other players and spend those caps! 
---
I think it's legitimately impossible to get up there now, there's a few elevators and they all do that.
---
Imo yes is best build lol. I can one shot turds with tse and take as much as they can throw at me. I use an executioners 3* heavy sledge and a prime auto futious handmade and for reg shoot shoot pew pew a ts 10mm sub. These are mains but i also carry a few other bits for specific things too
---
No probs, been server hoping and just got another!
---
Considering there are only 24 players a server having 3 worthwhile events running at any given time fixes the issue.
---
Maybe it does because I've had multiple queen fights in and out the nuke zone and sometimes she doesn't heal at all 
---
I only have 4 pts in perception btw thats all you need imo for all rifleman at lvl 1 and tank killer
---
It's "removing" previously expended ammo.
---
Everything but world spawn is per player 
---
Whether it's a 3* mutant slayer rolling pin a instigating pipe wrench or a leather left leg
---
Theyd need to seriously fix the invisible team mate glitch first. In almost every play session one of my team mates turns invisible and the only way we can swap ammo is via bags. Once thats fixed then im fine with this. 
---
Sigh. You'd be looking at 20x the upvotes and the support of the board without the "LMAO" idiocy.
---
Downvote away, I'll stand by this.
---
To all those people who leave their decontamination showers open...thank you
---
Of course not. They didn't think the scorpion had a.. leg to stand on.
---
Also I mistakenly reverse-coded the letters my first time, and used an online unscrambler to find out that the 8 letters then would only unscramble to make a 6-letter word at best, which is why I redid it the other way around, getting me 3 potential codes at the end.
---
I know all the letters and numbers were lined up and matched correctly that time. Not missing anything, am I? Am I the only person to get 3 potential codes? Just asking all the big/small/dumb questions now to avoid as much repetition as possible later on.
---
I end up Googling for all this type of information. There is at least one really good web-site. 
---
I'll dissent. A moderate amount of RR saves a lot of annoyance. You don't have to run through your inventory every time you wander too close to a barrel or collect a pile of dirty water. You don't die when you disconnect at Whitesprings. Ghouls are a lot less dangerous.
---
Ideally you get the RR as second-star legendary effects. Otherwise Trapper or Marine is normally a better choice than Robot because energy weapons are rare and weak.
---
I‚Äôm stealth rifle as well, but keep a combat shotgun with two Enforcer cards in AGI. Keeps me out of all trouble. 
---
nothing worse than traveling to an event for 2 seconds then have time run out
---
This is why I expressed my story and situation; because so many believe they know what every player should expect when introduced to Fallout 76. I am glad as well. Just not glad the innocents that are claimed as exploiters are punished. In your eyes, a ban is a direct link to a guilty verdict of exploiting and being a collaborator. I am proof that is not the case. You are ignoring the bulk of my message and am continuing to focus on the same frustration you had when you killed the mule and his collaborator you had explained previously. The fact you keep reminding me that new players can only hold so much does not change my opinion that mules are very common on a huge number of games, much like Fallout 76. Thank you.
---
I've actually found this one to be the best. Redoing that 'patrol' quest on each hop, to get into the crate in the back... Anywhere from 2-42 stimpacks in one go typically about 15 each time.
---
You can but i specified regular armor, in which case there is none.
---
Hacking the reactor room terminals and having them empty out the room, and then disability them before I go in was the thing that helped me the most, be aware though, it does take a while to clear out the room completely I went and got a snack and came back for the last shot 
---
Power armor is basically like cruising around in a tank. This is offset by high maintenance costs (can be reduced with Power Patcher, which also slows CND loss by up to x%)
---
Wait ,wait i guess you cannot do this. I'm on a magazine hunt myself and have a gazillion in my inventory. But the pipboy games cannot be traded because as soon as you pick them up,the holotape pop up in your inventory and you get a special bonus,but you don't get a physical copy like the others.
---
I found wastelad a couple of times these days and i don't have it.
---
Also have nuka tapper since forever and found a new copy recently but i discovered that it's not checked for the challenge.
---
I really should have read the last statement about this trick locking your CAMP. I put two stair wells ontop of eachother in a way that the stairs run into eachother and now I can't delete either of them. :facepalm:
---
A few weeks ago after a patch I went 8 hours without disconnecting. Before that patch the disconnecting was insufferable. People after that patch were still getting tons of disconnects. This patch I'm crashing at a absurd rate. People after this patch aren't crashing as much as I am. It's a mixed bag, but either way, I'm crashing way to damn much.
---
Same here so it doesn‚Äôt just hate you... üëçüèª
---
Hm, thanks for the tip. I'll make sure to do that next time
---
I like my pole hook for that, for sure
---
Kind of like how cycle vats targets is the same as the stimpack button.  If it is any consolation I am sure I have wasted a stim as many times as you dropped a grenade.
---
Level 115/PC/US CST always looking for positive teammates. Username: alpha.ronin
---
I hate when those level 200 roll up and just destroy the thing in 2 hits without letting others get some action or xp smh
---
I had that protest one work once, one scorched protestor with a sign showed up and was killed by super mutants in the area and it was marked as completed without firing a single shot. subsequent times it hasn't worked
---
A man in a mask bumped into me as he was running out of a bank. We became good friends and he gifted me large sacks of money with dollar signs on the side of it. I spent this money living a lavish lifestyle but I would occasionally give a $20 in a homeless person so I'm generally a good person. 
---
I had so much money it became hard to hide from the government. I learned that some people make overseas accounts and launder money to get around this, I did the same. Everyone would get mad and tell me this money was stolen, but I would respond no I earned this money. 
---
One day the FBI showed up on my doorstep and took all this money from me. It is not really fair because I didn't know where the large dollar bill sacks came from. I deserve to have it all back.
---
Me too bro. They are part of my CAMP now.
---
I thought I was the only one that farmed those things. Listed as 200 caps a pop as value, taking up 0.1 pounds in inventory. I don't know of there is a better value/weight ratio in the game.
---
Somebody built [this behind the clubhouse](https://i.imgur.com/Xbyc82n.png)

If you think that writing is high brow, I've got news for you and the the average level of intelligence: you're below average.

this made me laugh more than it should have lol
---
Download the game and the update separately.... that's what I've had to do before. When it says "this game needs an update" just click cancel and let it download the game. Then go to start it up and it will say it again, then accept the update. 
---
The Messenger. I hope to know what the payoff is one day, but I just don't want to spend 30 mins watching a handy get locked up to time out and not get a reward.
---
Hahaha that's what I was already trying to farm solo, but it was always empty
---
Nah. Give the guy a break - I figure as long as you grass on the actual duper your account should be reinstated.
---
However, as part of Wasteland justice all of your characters are branded across the forehead and have their left hand cut off - imposing a permanent reduction to carry weight and inability to use any two-handed weapons (eg TSE shotguns).
---
death blossoms is definitely the worst of them all, it‚Äôs literally 7-8 mins of running around killing dozens of mole rats and wolves that dont give a shit about you and will kill the flowers in random order with like half a minute of nothing inbetween waves. and the area is so big that you‚Äôll end up finishing with maybe one flower alive and all you get is some corpse flower seeds or something unless you give up halfway through like i do
---
I can already see the reddit haters piling on, but fuck it man, i don't think you were in the wrong. Like Let's talk this through. You never exploited. You didnt dupe. If you did, its a fair ban, but i believe you when you say you didnt. 
---
So you were offered a ridiculously good trade by someone that (obviously) did exploit. This is a bit of a moral grey area. Not a ban worthy offense. I mean are you responsible for how others play the game, or just your behavior? At what point is a deal too good that it becomes a ban worthy offense to take it? 
---
Like Let's be honest, we can all recognize the super popular dupes on our respective platforms. If i buy one for 1k and and resell it for 2k, should i be banned? What about if i buy 2 for 500 each? Or 10 for 100 each? When did i go from trader to villain?
---
You're banned for a bullshit reason in my opinion. Bethesda had a shitty system that they couldn't protect, and they can't track who exploited it so they're just banning heavy accounts. That sucks. 
---
Ive never duped a damn thing, but i wanted to trade weapons too. On xbox, That means dupes. Flat out. Ive bought and sold like 20 of those TSE pumps. Nobody is gonna buy a non god roll at all when a 3* TSE handmade sells for 1k. 
---
I think they should have just deleted your inventory, and left your account otherwise untouched. The only reason they didn't is because they can't tell if you were the duper or not. And that's on them. Yeah, they need to fix the market by stamping out the massive stockpiles of illegitimate guns, but not kill non exploiting accounts as collateral damage. 
---
And to all these guys throwing shade, do you have a TSE in your inventory? There's a 99.99% chance its a dupe. In my 150 level playing, ive never hit one. Neither have my best 2 friends that play. If you're serious about being tough on duping, drop that gun. 
---
this is a terrible idea.
---
Don't cut yourself with all that edge.
---
Can we lower it to 15k?  A higher cap will inflate the market for new players when we get our own vendor bots.  You dont need more than 15k to buy anything in game.
---
Um, hey if you still have one hit me up my name is MadGr
---
Oh damn, thanks. Will be on the lookout
---
Hey! [PS4/NA] add me Grandoldpartyer :) I also run a Fallout 7^ community on Discord that you can join! 
---
https://discord.gg/ZKsX73
---
Amen to that.
---
Don't forget about the robots that drop them. There are a few easily accessible Sentry Bots that can be stealth killed for a quick fusion core. Even the ones at the Whitesprings can be dealt with without permanent consequence (as long as you've got an exit strategy).
---
You can after level 50z
---
Dang figures
---
After 50, you get a choice of picking a new perk or moving one point between special attributes.   
---
If you have a lot of change to special that you want to do, it might be better to start with a fresh character.
---
It's a trap. There's no way to activate the lure.
---
Hey, it's fine. Justice has been served, everyone is happy.
---
I'm on PC as well, and am the hold mule for a few others who are building up second characters. I'm not there yet, but after a life long solo gaming career, it's nice to have a few others to have available for when I decide it's time for a number two build. 
---
Feel free to use me for swapping stuff as well. Same game in name as here.
---
The whole plan thing is way to random and grindy.   I have yet to find the Lever plan and have only ever had one Lever action drop and it is a legendary.  I would like to buid it up but no way to.  
---
All you have done is proved to me that I have every right to speak my situation, and that you have also lost your left testicle. Attempting to silence players that have been caught between these two extremes will not work on me. I have never duped, I had never learned the process for duping items and will continue to not resort to exploits. I also did not just "resell" as you state, I traded using, what I also believed to be completely legit at the time, the in-game trading system. I titled myself, "The Wasteland Trader" not "The Wasteland Seller," and received great feedback from a huge number of players.
---
Indeed, the entire social menu could easily be a pipboy menu.
---
I'm so careful that I hide event in my pip-boy and move on.
---
I've had this since day one. I just stand still for a while until it loads in properly. It's annoying, especially if you get attacked. I'm used to it now though 
---
sure, you're allowed to voice your displeasure, but what i am mad about is people trying to get me to believe what i like is objectively wrong
---
After you hit lv 50 your able to either move 1 special point around or select another perk card for each additional level. 
---
Or just sell them at whatever % other items are sold to vendors for...
---
You act like there isn't already a % to sell items at. üòÇ
---
I got one at grafton after like 30 server hops haha. Ty
---
So, same as in FO4 then.
---
Ok. Thank you I knew I missed something.
---
No worries, if im not on when you are just dm me on here and Ill try to hop on if its in the evening.
---
No idea, ive moved on from this crap game
---
I lost 1300 Cells because of that stupid thing =.=
---
I‚Äôve had to repair this thing a lot. 
---
ffs invite as many as you can to team up. 
---
I don't ever remember being there when there were more than 4 of us. 
---
That way everyone can loot each other's kills whether they get a hit on it or not. 
---
If they don't accept the invite then that's on them. 
---
A known duper can still give us valuable information. 
---
If you are going to build a melee you need to max out the gladiator perks or the slugger perks depending on your weapon of choice. Sturdy frame isnt recommended. Once you max out gladiator or slugger perks along with incisor and martial artist that will use all 15 points. Also iron fist only affects melee weapons like mole miner gauntlet or death claw gauntlet. One handed weapons like swords and knives are only affected by the gladiator perks..
---
I just write them down as I get them until something comes out.
---
Fuck. I'm using that mod. Thanks for informing me.
---
They're all pretty terrible, uneventful and unrewarding with maybe the exception of Patrol Duty, but if I had to name just one it would be Death Blossoms.
---
Thank you so much. This is the exact reason I expressed my situation to the public. So that I could read what logical players think about the situation as a whole. I greatly appreciate you taking the time to understand and voice your opinion on the subject. I only wish others were more open to considering what you have said.
---
I hate wearing a headset and prefer the sound from my speaker set up when playing solo. Once I start the game, I'm stuck with whatever sound device I started with, so no easy way for me to switch to head set. If I'm going to trade or pull mule duty for someone, I'll restart the game with my headset on, but a casual in game encounter, I'm going to be mic-less.
---
lol that's awesome. I already do my own renditions of Nuka Cola/Nuka Cola Quantums, and several other items from the game like Mutt Chops, and even the good old infamous and highly sought after "Canned Dog Food".. my son loves it.
---
oh you poor thing
---
Have had my X01 since lvl 50, now lvl 98 and never repairs it and have caught the SBQ several times, attacked by hundreds of SB's and traversed nuked sites many many times, it's just not yielding üòÅ
---
Imagine if you could sell every ghoul slayer's pool cue and instigating 10mm smg for 50 caps. That would fuck the economy up harder than all the duping
---
Hey I like Bumblebee except last TV version...............I do wish I could paint the Excavator Armor though
---
Wait, are you in the dev room? What‚Äôs your gamer tag?
---
Why are people so obsessed with Handmades... It makes no sense.
---
I just saw callibrated shocks. Wish I had known they were rare. 
---
Outer World's?
---
I'm probably going to get killed for saying this - but consoles did this.  There's only so many buttons on a controller.  KBM old school has its advantages.
---
Have you learned the plans from the terminal after the enclave quest? And learned the ultracite plans from the queen?
---
Hmm maybe it's certain games that way the nm cause I've traded like 3 copies of Grognak to friends now cause I'm always grab it when I'm in the area 
---
This happens to me every so often on XB1. It seems to reset itself next time I log on (usually ~24hrs later)
---
Hahahaha. I love doing this as well. To the assaultrons as well. 
---
Marine Armor plans are pretty easy to find, I‚Äôm 3 deep in all but the torso. That said, I‚Äôm of the opinion Sturdy/Heavy Combat Armor plans do not exist.
---
Gives flat health, not %.
---
You asked I answered. That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs affected me, and you can find tons of threads of other people with the same complaints 
---
Everyone is missing the painfully obvious. 
---
Group up.  Everyone on a team can loot each other's kills. 
---
Maybe they are using pre-war pricing models and they just have zero clue how valuable a legendary is.
---
If they had any clue what a legendary was, they would destroy any "Troubleshooter" legendary the instant you sold it to them.
---
Don't you take away my Anti-Armor buzzblade.
---
Coal is in this game right?   
---
Lost opportunity for the Santa outfit I'm vaguely remembering in the store. 
---
Heh
---
Last time I checked the only official word is that they won‚Äôt be helping you out if you break your game with third party mods. Just about everything is server based so mods interfering with others really isn‚Äôt much of a risk. Hell breaking your own game isn‚Äôt really a risk since your character is on their servers. 
---
Most mods seem to be on the user‚Äôs end with quality of life improvements. I consider myself a very cautious person but I‚Äôd hate to play this game without perk loadout, known mods, and chat mod. Chat mod especially adds new depth to the game that I didn‚Äôt know I missed. 
---
&gt; loosing
---
The word is LOSING, not LOOSING.  That's it.  I'm done with you as soon as these vault doors open.  Wait until I catch you hunting for a cap stash.  Super Sledge to the nuts!
---
Thank you. I'm still open to the idea that I am at a sort of fault. I just truly don't believe I deserve to be filed into a category of exploiters and cheaters. I'd very much like to have been given the opportunity to fix my wrong doing, it was my decision to continue to trade my items, this I'm aware, however, I would have easily had abandoned my inventory if I had known I'd be considered part of the problem.
---
This hurts. I've never had more than 3.5k, and I'm level 71. 
---
Yeah the spawns can change. Happened to me last night. Had scorched there and after clearing the silo, had my mate check the enemies before launch and he saw ghouls. We thought this would be ok but it turned out there where two ghouls and a bunch of mole miners. The ghouls didn't even change post nuke. Complete waste of time in the end.
---
With 25+ years of gaming, surely you had to be a little suspicious?  
---
I don't agree with you trying to completely exonerate yourself, you DID participate and continued to even when you had learned exactly what you were trading in. That said, I hope they are lenient and you'll learn something from this experience. Denying culpability isn't going to get you that lesson though. It would be better if you apologized for your negligence rather than the length of your post.
---
I had that as well. Showed I have enough materials but it's still grayed out. Seemed to be due to having some mix and match steel. I think it was some part of  bulking/scrapping/consolidating that fixed it.
---
Well I do and so do many, many other players including deaf /hard of hearing folks. Just because you don't 'miss' it doesn't mean it shouldn't be there with the ability to toggle on/off like any other decent online multiplayer game. This is a basic feature, poor effort.
---
Feed the People. It no longer feeds the people and still has a bug where you can und up throwing your weapon, ammo, etc. in the processor and lose it all.
---
I agree with the problem: virtually all legendaries aren‚Äôt worth even holding in your inventory for 20m, which erodes a core end-game loop.  Other games have solved this well.
---
However I don‚Äôt believe vendor sell price is a solution.  Anyone farming legendaries can already max out the vendors through other means.
---
We need legendaries to be worth something unique or compelling: turn-ins  to repeatable faction quests for XP, rep (they should make faction rep be a thing, and that matters for end-game), or other unique rewards or components.  A simple system for this kind of thing is enchanting, where enchantments require a ton of disenchanted legendaries.  Faction tokens (ie one token per star of the destroyed legendary) that can buy things - the team could start with faction-specific cosmetic items while they gauge how players will use it.  Max 10 items submitted per day per faction or something.  And eventually mods, buff items etc purchased with faction tokens.
---
There are 7 different faction vendors in the game that each share a 200 cap pool that resets 20 hours after you wipe them out.  
---
1. Responders (train stations, Vendor Bot Greg, rare vendor bot). 
---
2. Raiders (train stations, ski lodge). 
---
3. Watoga train station. 
---
4. Watoga BoS (shared with Grahm). 
---
5. Free States in Harper's Ferry. 
---
6. Enclave bunker. 
---
7. Whitespring mall. 
---
Just sell them a bunch of weapons or bulked junk every day. Takes maybe 15 or 20 minutes. You can even sell them purified water if you have a few purifiers set up in CAMP, or set up an adhesive farm with tatos, corn, and mutfruit. You can make vegetable starch and scrap it for adhesive.
---
Some chassis are bugged find another and put on power patcher perk and try again if still not i can help you out
---
I actually leave things in train station containers. Some times plans,Armor,Weapons and  other items. Then I will go AFK at my camp and stuff and hope people find them.
---
I was against this for the idea of people farming mods to sell but I could see it working out if players could access them through vendors. 
---
I agree with people's backlash, but in reality you didn't intend on getting this stuff it just happened upon you. I know people who are friends with dupers and they think they're high and mighty and showing off all they're tse handmades and whatever, you simply stumbled across a guy and went "Wow this is amazing!" And sold it off. If I'd have seen you as a vendor I'd have been so happy and it sucks that you got banned. I think they should've warned you to drop it or they'd delete it, or maybe a temp ban while they figured out how to delete it all. But a perma ban is a bit much for that. Just me tho
---
Sweet I'll add ya when I get on.
---
Really? I've this one probably 4 or 5 times with no issues.
---
Yoooo for the past week I've been having *far* more weight issues.
---
I need to check this.
---
I like how you thing(a bit more work, but works)
---
I also run a gaming community on Discord. Not really considered "old school" but anyone is welcome to join if you're looking for more peeps to team up with in 76, eso, etc. 
---
Okay, I‚Äôll keep that in mind, but I‚Äôll worry about it later. Thanks!
---
It's OK but the game should tell you what you need without making you loose caps for travelling or replacing your camp (example:excavator power armor mission at ash heap). Using Google for that is kind of akward.
---
Unfortunately regardless of your story it appears identical to what dupers do.
---
If ppl that actively dupe said the same thing as a bold face lie should they have their ban lifted too?
---
Time it before and after taking Rad-x
---
How did I not know
---
I hear what you're saying. I think if they made 2 adjustments it could help.
---
1) Bear with me here. Incentivize destruction and defense of CAMPS. This at least adds a reason to attack a players camp,  but also gives a defender a reason to care other than to stop breaking someone breaking your shit. 
---
2) implement other ways to pay for the repair of your camp. Junk or caps or a combo of both or something. Having to hunt down extremely rare junk just to repair something you already had to hunt down rare junk for is a bit much, especially when it's to repair just because someone was an ass hole. Double especially if you stop them half way through and got minimal reward for doing so. 
---
OR
---
Make it like a workshop situation but kind of a wager. 
---
If a player starts to engage in destruction of your base it gives you a little prompt "Attacking this base will cost x amount of caps and engage PVP with the owner"
---
The player would also get a "Defend your camp event"  and if they kill the offender they receive the caps the player paid to attack your base on top of the bounty.
---
I never wanted my items back, only the ability to play now knowing the seriousness of having anything duped in an inventory. Thanks for your entertaining visual.
---
I am not the guy you asked, but here is how I do it.
---
 - I almost only use events as fast travel. Pay to join event, doing the event takes mostly 5 minutes, get more money back than I used getting there and just walk to my original destination.
---
 - Sell every day to all vendors available. I have made a small route from my home at top of the world. Hit the vendors there, pay 6 caps to go to whitespring station, sell useless junk/drugs to vendor, move into WS bunker and sell there. While I'm there, I always pick up some technical documents. 
---
Then I fast travel back home for free, and use 5 minutes to walk east towards the BoS base where I can turn in the technical documents for 25-40 caps. Then I spend 4 caps to fast travel to Harpers Ferry and sell to the vendor there. 
---
From there, I use random events to get around the map to the rest of the vendors. Along the way, I collect weapons from enemies to turn into steel/ammo, hitting to flies with one hand.
---
 - Some events pay better than others. If you are low level, I don't recommend doing this, but completing a missile silo run pays 100 caps, and taking down the queen gives 200. I try to do both once a day.
---
 - Some events are over quicker than others, thus pay better if you think about the time spent. I prefer Distant Thunder - A real blast - Dropped Connection - Census Violence - Grafton Day (I'm sure i'm forgetting something), because they can be done relatively quickly. 
---
 - Find someone to play with. Every friend and teammates base is a free fast travel point, which have by now saved me thousands of caps. 
---
 - Use vault 76 as a free fast travel point religiously. 
---
 - Look for free resources in the blue suitcase at train stations! I know of many people who have started dumping their excess resources into the blue almost clean looking suitcase there is in almost every train station. This includes plans we don't need as well. Other people put these kind of things in the cash register, but I only put unwanted legendary items in that. 
---
 - Some daily missions are not worth doing, if you use fast travel a lot. Many of the Daily missions take you to different places all over the map to collect data or just fetch something, which will run you into the red if you fast travel to every place. I personally avoid Ecological balance, but like the one with the cookouts and where I have to hunt animals. 
---
 - Get the perk card "travel agent" from the charisma category. -30% price on fast travel adds up fast. 
---
Even if I believed that some one gave you over 70k lbs of leggies and bobbleheads (which I absolutely do not), you knew those were all misgotten items. Yet you decided to keep and use them anyway. And then you would further have me believe that you traded for a loss with all these items, because you are just some kind of Wasteland Robinhood, who really enjoys the ingame trading menu/mechanic. Its BS! You entire story is BS! I don't care how much you whine and cry and lie, you deserve your ban. Man up and face the consequences of your actions.
---
Has happened to me on PC, exactly as you describe, goes away after a kill or something. Super weird/annoying. 
---
Couple of things... lose sturdy frame and iron fist (gladiator OR iron fist, diff weapons) and grab blocker.   In charisma, grab another point from int (Only need weapon artisan when repairing) and check out Suppressor...   also, if you're going to have a lot of food, I'd recommend Thru-hiker....   if you really want to irradiate yourself with food, grab cannibal without lead belly...
---
And now I need to go farm some coal hahaha
---
...bro. That is great. Gonna start doing it. 
---
Seriously‚Ä¶ I wholeheartedly agree. These have reached a point where now I‚Äôm full on Raider and hope to see my name or a story that sounds oddly close to what just happened. 
---
If you don't have a quiet environment, don't use a mic.
---
If you're in a quiet environment, why wear massive ear muffs?
---
In hindsight ..Next time if there is a next time, trade parts, so give him 1 gun, you gives you two legs. Go for the legs first and then arms, the most valuable parts, then you give a gun then gives you more parts.
---
This reminds me of Stranger Things. 
---
Yes, she knows it's a multipass!
---
DigitalVirusX2, I can hop on whenever, although, if you want caps, best I can do is 1000, I only got 1500 on me.
---
Everyone knows the ice box is the cool place to put things at white springs bro. 
---
Hey, it's a lukewarm hot take.
---
The Mountain verses Oberyn. üòÜüòêüíÄ
---
No it makes total sense. 
---
The vault was fairly safe. Things were provided. 
---
The wasteland is not. It's survival. People will turn on each other in a heart beat.
---
If that take is ‚Äòedgy‚Äô, I can‚Äôt imagine your daily life. 
---
Right? A taco truck that crashes every 30 minutes?
---
Store all your junk first and try again
---
Even a "No Thanks" type wave would be better. Thumbs down kinda works but I think it can give the wrong impression sometimes.
---
I‚Äôve had that happen before too, quite a few times actually and often at really inconvenient times . Usually if you spam cancel, it will let you out sooner, but it‚Äôs hard to do. Like you said it‚Äôs rapid in and out so you have to get lucky and time it while it‚Äôs still in vats
---
If everything is easy and boring then start a new character.
---
What did you wind up putting those extra points in if I may ask? I debated that but decided to do more for min/max
---
That's smart, if only I thought of that
---
Bugs I Still Encounter.  
---
1. Random damage while running.
---
2. Cap increase while placing C.A.M.P. when in motion.
---
3. Infinite Loading Screen.
---
If there are more, I haven't encountered them enough to make it bothersome.
---
Just a quick update.
---
Dismantled my CAMP piece by piece down to the foundations starting with the wires and storing as I went, and lo and behold additional items suddenly popped up in my storage. Most notable were two additional rocket turrets and some power switches. Once these were deleted my available budget increased dramatically.
---
There is still obviously a glitch somewhere (possibly if an item gets destroyed when attacked?) but this worked for me and I am one very happy camper now.
---
Enjoy
---
I've had Protest March work a couple of times, but yeah, normally it breaks.
---
Didn't have much trouble with Back on the Beat. I thought getting attacked only distracted the robot rather than ending the event. 
---
Swarm of Suitors is maybe 50/50. Often sticks on "one player must reach the island".
---
I don't think PA actually bends enough for you to sit in it.
---
Could use a second character to store your excess. Easy with the help of a friend or a second account.
---
I am more frustrated with the 200 vendor limit but it isn't that bad to visit multiple factions.
---
I wish I could combine 20 Ultracite Vent plans into a random chance to get 1 Calibrated Shocks plan.
---
There are many factors.  Perk Cards, SPECIAL stats, temporary boosts, item Condition, etc.  Hard to say without holding these factors constant.
---
Like Typewriters, Clipboards and Broken Lamps etc. World base items like if somebody in your picked it up then you can't for a certain amount of time, 
---
I recently found an explosive sniper for my sniper build- but of course I didnt put perks into explosives, so its only marginally better than a base one! (I found a two shot, i prefer to use that despite the explosives quad ammo capacity lol)  
---
Explosive isnt worth it if you dont sink in the points!
---
It happens to me all the time. The fix is either the death of the targeted creature or  60 or so seconds... whichever comes first. 
---
&gt;However, I have been having an absolute blast playing it, especially due to in-game trading which was my main play style
---
Unfortunately Fallout 76 isn't a black 
---
market simulator so Bethesda doesn't care if you had fun hauling around 70k pounds of duplicated items to sell to other players.
---
What did you think when you got 4000 stimpaks, putting you 20x over your weight limit?  Did you think that was a regular part of the gameplay? 
---
Blew yourself up huh. 
---
LMAO ask me how I know
---
I agree. Why have the drop function anyway? Just use the trade function. The game does not even support pimping your camp with any dropped items so just remove the function already.
---
The economy is still fucked though until they remove the guys with 100 k+ of all end game gear and good consumables. And even if they remove the most active dupe traders with huge stashes the amount of duped stuff already spread out among ‚Äùnormal players‚Äù is huge.
---
I am pro what you discuss though and from reddit i gather that so are a lot of others too.
---
This has what you want. I use it myself.  
---

ok now its installing from Disc for a 43.37 GB fast, 5 gb completed so far, now we will see what update looks like for first time installers at present
---
Cyberpunk 2077
---
For what it's worth, I got barn walls + two more plans from a scorchbeast defend at Dolly sods.
---
I hope they're lenient with your account. I'm holding some stuff that I'm sure was duped (no, i havnt personally rolled a TSE handmade, pump and lever) and everyday i wonder if the ban hammer is coming for me too. If you're on xbox and start a new GT, shoot me a message and I'll help you get going again.
---
I disagree, I'm sure I am one of many that was directly introduced to exploits without knowing they were that. I have not refused blame, only that I do not exploit or cheat. I would correct this mishap if given the opportunity. However, jumping to conclusions seems to be the most taken path. Especially when it revolves around Fallout 76.
---
Maybe but moving camps for some people isn‚Äôt possible without completely rebuilding. 
---
You can use your anecdotal evidence to make poor arguments all day.
---
Can you show me where PA offers even 2/3 the defense of sentinel? Can you show me how to get 73% explosive resistance in power armor?
---
You can‚Äôt figure out what argument you want to make because you armor power armor is superior then your argue that it‚Äôs easier to get. The first is mathematically untrue while the second is certainly true.
---
He could still screw you on the first trade, so demand some caps for collateral ... don't buy the bs no caps etc ...  I know we trusting as humans,  you don't think people will be dicks but they are
---
Yeah, you can get get Double/Quad on anything including Crossbows, Double Barrel Shotguns, Revolvers, Broadsider, etc. Just can't get it on BP weapons including The Dragon.
---
It's not even about caps, its about tediousness. 
---
You may want to delete the whole game then reinstall. It will hopefully reduce the needed storage space.
---
Not again. This has been discussed so many times.
---
You miss 5 days food and then tell me what you'd do to survive.
---
No, it‚Äôs not feedback to Bethesda when I see people who have NEVER PLAYED THE GAME hate on it for minor issues that Bethesda is trying to fix. And before you go hit on my tail saying how Bethesda isn‚Äôt actually trying to fix the issues, they have shown they are willing to work on these things, I mean, have you SEEN some of these updates? Hi me of the main problems is that people are not patient, they are not trying to give an EXPERIMENT a chance.
---
Leave
---
It's not even about caps, its about tediousness 
---
When I first put on my set  a few days ago I had a similar issue. I kept playing with armor (taking it on and off) and got it to work for the most part. I still occasionally have it not work but usually just for a few moments
---
I‚Äôve found them in suitcases at train stations. I take the ones I need and add the ones I already have to this so it passes on the wealth. 
---
&gt;Make fast travel to events free
---
Yeah I guess that's okay.
---
&gt;Ignore the encumbered restriction
---
Nnnnno.
---
Thank you. Just to clarify I had no intent really to "sell it off" I wanted to become known as The Wasteland Trader, where legit players who loved playing the game could go to replenish essentials or trade high end weapons for low costs instead of relying on in game venders. That was my intent.
---
With other armor, you will have a higher defense according to stats. After 5 chars above lol 50, I'm still not sure which suit is best in practice. I do know that when I did go all ultracite, that thing needed repairs often. My t60 is cheap to fix and I have plenty of stimpack and radaway to deal with any slight variations.
---
Ignorance is not an excuse. Stop playing dumb. You're part of the problem and deserved the ban.
---
They‚Äôre already working on huge dlcs, possibly with npcs !
---
Suprisingly enough the post got downvoted. I'm going to repost at a more active time to gather more traction. Around 6pm
---
Keeps me from buying the same plans. I also. Note when scrapping armor and weapons for mod names.
---
this is complete crap
---
This worked for me
---
I‚Äôll come find you. You can have it for 1 cap. I bought it from a vendor and figured someone might need it down the road if they were in your situation. 
---
That‚Äôs cool. But, I was thinking, if Bethesda would give better responder gear in game, like responder uniform with intel and stim buffs to help folks who actually call help, while in game.
---
Like an ingame EMT w/stim packs for unplanned SB / ghouls mutie attacks on lowbies.
---
It‚Äôs on both 
---
Oof that was a two for one burn. 
---
Console as well, there is no discrimination.
---
Console too.
---
Yep I think I‚Äôve got 2 sessions left in me max.  This was supposed to be the game my wife and I played for the next two years.  She quit two weeks after BETA and my alt has just about run its course.  
---
Bethesda has some serious soul-searching to do about their mission and role in the market in the next 10 years.  Remaking the same game on the same platform again-again-again won‚Äôt cut it, and I‚Äôm not sure they are capable of anything else. 
---
Both
---
Console as well. Afaik the only thing that was PC only was the dev room stuff.
---
please explain
---
Remove the floor/roof then place it. I think it has something to do with the size of the object being placed.
---
Yeah, I hope I can just get some good guns again. I just am so defeated inside right now
---
I remember I came upon a kneecapping sub machine gun in FO4 was a low damage but I just maxed out the clip size on it. Any time I came across an enemy that I didn‚Äôt want to deal with I would merely pull this out, empty one clip and they would be crippled 80% of the time, 100% of the time when I had to use  two clips, then pull out a more powerful weapon to finish them off. I used to brag and show my roommate when I would get a deathclaw crippled and it was just struggling on the ground. He finally came across his own kneecapping weapon, but it was a pipe wrench, so it wasn‚Äôt quite as useful.
---
Rip deathclaw mod, I still haven‚Äôt found another one 
---
So do you take all their junk, putting the salt in first so the bag doesn't just disappear or do you just add salt to the bag and leave the rest? Curious as to how this affects the objective to retrieve your loot. 
---
Servers will probably be shut down in 6 months
---
I tested marathoner with power armor a few times running back and forth from my base along a wall, and couldn't see any difference.
---
Had one where I had to kill a mirelurk queen..  it took zero damage from anything.. missiles.. grenades.. mines.. melee.. nothing
---
It has worked for me 2 out of 20 times. I don't bother going their anymore not worth caps; especially being a lower level event. I won't bother until they note it in a patch note.
---
must be the messenger events. just walk around aimlessly, and sometimes the dumb bot gets stuck.
---
You've just said they belong to whomever is there, I was there alone... And then I've gotta content with someones base taking aggro, so? Completely missed the point this entire discussion is about.
---
Check the pieces u can have Rad resist gear bug and have 0, i run with Rad resist gear  my self and it does stack i have 4 pieces working and i have over 100 (they are Combat armor btw, by default has 0)
---
I'm on now.
---
But what's the angle here? You cant be this nice... there's no way... you're after me lucky charms ain't ya?
---
Interestingly enough, I have level 2 Bandolier and the weight of many of my bullets are 0 lbs making it weightless. I just store all the ammo on my person now.
---
Misterfruit88 
---
Oh of course I know you weren't trying to sell it off as in like ripping people off, I just meant sell in general lol. If this hadn't have happened I'd loved to have run across you, I'm always looking for high level stuff/rare stuff
---
I had no problems with crashes on the PS4 until the last update. Now it's happening over and over
---
Yeah I noticed that some of the pieces have zero rad resist I traded good shot for them tooüòî
---
Serious question, why did plague doctors become so popular this past year?
---
That's it! I had 2 buildings in my blueprints, one I was scrapping the other I was placing. Placing a blueprinted structure was the problem. I scrapped both and rebuilt and haven't had a crash yet.
---
Thank you! You're more help than Bethesda!
---
I lose 2k 5.56 to that bastard never again
---
You assume that it should be a basic feature of online games because it has typically been a basic feature.
---
Are you deaf? Or are you just rhetorically using them to further your goals?
---
The West Virginia part at the bottom is kind of yea....
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt find your comment interesting enough to upvote or downvote. You‚Äôre trying really hard to be the victim here. Claiming this sub is on the side of grifers is obviously just your way of coping with the fact that people don‚Äôt like your terrible ideas. Like deleting someone‚Äôs camp if they mess with yours. That is in every possible way an utterly terrible idea. I hate having my camp destroyed and would never just mess up someone‚Äôs camp and I still think that‚Äôs just such a bad idea lmao. 
---
Gotta spend that budget before the end of the fiscal year somehow!
---
I'm making factual arguments after using my full sentinels sets and full PA sets for 100+ hours each. I'm strictly discussing PVE, I do not participate in the pre-alpha slapped on PVP.
---
I've tested this at westtek. I stand in front of the same amount of mobs, my PA always loses less HP.  When I use NA I lose more HP. Always. This could be due to the fact that melee and some ranged mobs can stagger you and cancel the effect. 
---
Also this even bigger against Ghouls (that also cancel sentinel) and end game nuke zones. Ghouls chunk my normal armor HP but do nothing against my PA. As for TSE goes, with Fireproof and 3/3 Dodgy I take no damage for myself in PA.
---
Then factor in stuff like far more carry weight, instant stimpacks, and emergency protocols and it isn't even close.
---
PA is objectively superior for my build.
---
Unfortunately, as true as this is, its not true justice. I have not lied, I never wanted to be known as an exploiter or someone that was taking advantage of rare items and costs so that I could sell it off for a profit. This is how I was introduced to an online Fallout experience, I truly wanted others to to know I was there to help. I even still receive messages daily from people asking to trade. Many players find plans for me, which was my main desire for trades. I usually traded many items well over their respected value for plans, and would always throw in ammo or aid for each trade. People came to me interested and typically left happy. It's a shame i feel like such a bad person now.
---
I check in on it from time to time when I'm passing by for the Grafton Day event 
---
This is interesting! I'm planning something similar for an alt but currently just pistols and lots of VATS. Probably not an end game build but should be fun. Anyway, some comments: 
---
- Not sure you need that much int, since you can swap in perks if you're building with science or ballistic. So i guess max 6 if you want to have all the science perks at a time. 
---
- Have read elsewhere that crit savvy is better than four leaf clover as you can reliably get twice as many crits whereas the rest are a chance. 
---
- If you're going VATS you probably want 3 ranks in awareness too so you can pick body parts to shoot. 
---
A lot of those VATS abilities are geared towards killing multiple enemies (to trigger bonus damage) but usually I end up with problems taking out one big enemy that I'm focusing on. I picked up suppressor in CHA that would let me focus on one enemy while knocking out 30% of their damage. 
---
A good solution you might want to think about is making a base by a Junk pile. There are many screws in those. Additionally, you can take a trip to an office, run through it collecting all the fans and then change worlds.
---
Ok, so its not just me. I thought maybe my controller was glitching because I had not seen any reports of this bug and couldn't find anything searching for it.
---
It's the Finale... and it's really not that hard. Codes being online make it super simple.
---
Yeah it is the end game, so if you want to finish the game. There is a glitch that allows you to get in the silos quicker and easier, so you may want to try that, but just try grab some people and try it the normal way first.
---
I am filled with relief on reading your comment.  I thought I was just a SUPER HORRIBLE player when I couldn't, for the life of me, kill low level mobs with a shotgun to the face.  
---
I blocked him and his friends and hopped. They weren't cheating bit getting folks to engage the one so they could all pop them once you attacked back.
---
I experience this on PC also. The sound reminds me of the sound you hear when you try to use VATS to target something, buy your action points are too low. However, as you mentioned, you hear that sound 20+ times per second for a while until it decides to stop. Its a pretty obnoxious bug, second only (on PC) to the hot-menu wheel popping up for no reason even though my fingers and thumb are nowhere near the mouse wheel.
---
The very last quest is to launch a nuke, other than that, you never have to launch a nuke if you don‚Äôt want to.
---
I fucking hate that forest :D... lol tbh it's great when it's not bugging out, but it bugs out for me 3/4 of the time I go there and I can't see shit.
---
Can help if I‚Äôm xbx1
---
Yup have this happen at every SBQ fight I go too. Usually killing the target or pressing the map button stops it. 
---
I like to blow the arms and the legs then i blow the head
---
Quick Fix:  Hold the Start Button in to bring up the social menu, then close it.  Works every time, in just a split second.  Happens to me a lot.
---
I add salt and take the rest.
---
Not sure how it affects things
---
Flick it's legs to make it look like it's dancing.
---
I'm on PC and you're just clumsy, it takes almost a whole second of button pressing before you hear the grenade pin/molotov whooshing sound. If you hear that, that means you held long enough to throw a grenade
---
What platform? PC/Xb1/PS4?
---
It‚Äôs really not bad as part of a group.  Not bad solo if you have the right gear.  I‚Äôll gladly help if you are on Xbox.
---
Theres no continuing. thats the end of the main quest. although future updates may rely on you launching it already. find some people to help you in the silo, its  really not that bad.
---
There's little chance that you didn't see this coming, but you kept at it. If you traded any large quantities, some of your buyers probably got suspended too.
---
If you're lucky with your appeal they might restore your account but delete your character (it's too much work to sort through inventory and decide what's legitimate). But I think your wording's too defensive and unapologetic. That's not what moderators like to hear.
---
Thief!
---
You are a collaborator who has distributed glitched items and is using the ignorance excuse to justify it.
---
Things like that are why I stopped playing this game. I love the overall concept of FO76, but it's a buggy, unfinished, borderline stupidly designed mess.
---
My end game build is not complete? Then ill use that to get into the end game circles of the pvp crowd. Maybe a good guild once the game flushes out to include clan tags or different pvp modes. 
---
I bought the game for PvP in my beloved Bethesda engine.  Ive got thousands of hours on it (Skyrim, New Vegas, FO4). PvP on this engine has been my dream for 10 years.
---
What sold you on the game?
---
As others have said, if you want to do the final quest, you need to launch.  If you want to get that achievement, you need to launch.  Otherwise you can pretty much just join in existing blast zones.
---
They‚Äôre magically delicious. No, there are nice folks in the game. Let me repair it first, then I‚Äôll add you. 
---
Before long, running the silos won't be necessary. Just build a really tall camp structure and jump off of it.
---
Only aluminum and lead reduce weight when bulked. It's useful to bulk if you plan on selling to a vendors because junk you cant sell as individual scrap sells as bulk. 
---
I doubt they can detect mods and if they can then I'm pretty sure they would've started banning people by now. Also, since none of the mods give you any kind of special abilities (ie: exploits or cheats that affects more than just your game) they have no real incentive to go after those of us who do use them as most of them are QOL and visual mods.
---
Diseases too
---
Hell yes they're mine... Who do they belong too? I was the only one there... I triggered their spawns. Are you saying I can't touch them? do they belong to someone else? Who do they belong too?
---
The only room it saves is from the plastic, otherwise the weight stays the same (at least last time I checked). Bulking is really just to sell chunks to vendors I think, at least that's what I've been using it as
---
Who took advantage of you? You happily and willingly took an obnoxious amount of items items and proceeded to distribute them.
---
The internet seems to agree with you, I‚Äôll have to test it, it would be nice to clear 3 points, but it would be even better to sprint more! 
---
I agree. Rerolling legendaries is a must. However.... it really only works when different guns are better with different legendary perks. At this point reload speed, fire speed, explosive shot, and two shot are rly the best legendary stats. (Vampire too pardon me.)
---
Oh I also like Serendipity quite a bit for survivability. 
---
Still love my Tesla coils along with electrically charged. Don't care about the damage. üòä
---
I touch type so it's all muscle memory. I couldn't actually look at a qwerty keyboard and tell you what each key translates to off the top of my head. And if it's hard coded is not even worth trying to use Dvorak. Stuff like WASD just doesn't make sense. 
---
This is my rifle
---
This is my gun
---
This is for fighting
---
This is for fun
---
Gunny would be ashamed
---
Have you tried One Violent Night? Not sure if it was just me, but I've seen several level 62 legendary ghouls over there. That's a guaranteed max level, right?
---
Wicked covered it. You can sell non bulked junk on reddit and save all your plastic. Need those for shells. 
---
I amazed how many people resort to swearing instead of speaking with logic. In return to your response, I have no problem stating I too don't care for how deserved of the ban you think I am. That my story is not in any way close to BS. I had only played a couple of days before meeting someone who gave me all these items. I'm pretty sure if it had happened to me in any other game I had just started, I would have made the same decision, to take the items for my own account so I could be as ahead as possible. Not with intent to cheat, just to be the best player I could be. I am facing the consequences, however they are aimed at many that are not exploiters or cheaters but just players. Perhaps you should take your own advice and man up, attempt to see things through others perspectives. Thank you.
---
Same experience. I have  350+ level between 4 characters. The only armors I don't have are T-45 and XO
---
&gt; Power Poseidon is much more worth it now that the fusion core generator pumps out 100% cores like a boss. 
---
If you know where power armor spawns and fusion core spawns are you can farm them much faster than the generator can spawn them. Besides you don't need a shitload of cores, they weigh too much and last a long time. In the time you fix the power plant I can farm 8 cores at ~75% power.
---
I use the ice maker by the front door
---
I wish you could sell them to vendors so venders could sell them back to other people like legendaries. Be way quicker to find missing plans
---
Distributed glitched items, encouraging more duplication and fucking up the game's economy. Is not part of the problem, according to himself. 
---
Pick one because it can't be both.
---
It's almost pointless to launch. Its the finale and the quest rewards are junk. You have access to the enclave vendor. You don't need to go further
---
I don't know if there's a way around this or not, but it's the way I've done it and it's stupid:
---
Despite being on PC and not using the quick select wheel, you still have to use the quick select wheel to bind whatever it is to whichever number you want to. As in, bring up select wheel, navigate to appropriate slot, hit C or whatever it is to change the item being bound, then bind the right item.
---
In saying your kinda a dong. There his too and everyone else on the server. 
---
I don't know if trading the holotape counts for the challenge.
---
Most people don‚Äôt do that sort of thing. I‚Äôve had my base on crossroads, outside stations. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been griefed by a player in over 100 hours
---
That was my actual endgame goal and Im mad its not working
---
I really want this to be a thing. 
---
No, when I received 4000 stimpaks I was amazed and thought how nice it will be in the future to know its something I don't have to purposefully look for. This is when I learned about mules, and how they work. I thought I was pretty clear in my explanation which I have yet to deter from.
---
If real life, you also need a DTF symbol.
---
watts* and FO76 doesn't use watts, that'd be silly. A microwave is typically 800-1500 watts, let alone industrial shit that takes substantially more power.
---
'No thanks' would be a great alternative, and definitely more versatile. The thumbs down always looks rude to me personally.
---
This I did not know thank u!
---
Don't be foul, cancer is a vile disease that ruins lives of all ages, it's disgusting to refer to someone as such. I've no idea why people think it's ok and perfectly normal to refer to something as "cancer".
---
Disgusting.
---
I'm not assuming anything, it's considered a basic feature. No I'm not deaf, but I have deaf family and I have seen deaf members of the community requesting a text chat. If by further my goals you mean make the game better, then yes.
---
I am not going to flame you but after reading your full post I think it is a fair ban. I simply can not get past that you have played fallout games for 12 years (i guess you are an experienced) gamer. That and the part of your fair intentions and late surorise that a the online Bill Gates you met might be an exploiter. I mean if you have also read all the crappy reviews etc.
---
I want to give you the benefit of the doubt because you write a polite text but my cynik gamer mind and my line of work just cant do it sorry. 
---
You seem like a nice dude but what do I know, text is only text. I might be an asshole here but I got happy reading this as I get from reading all (so far) ban reports regarding dupers and glitchers.
---
I would have been on your side (i think) if you had threw it away or done somethin different like that before being banned.
---
Anyways, i understand it sucks but from how I read your text you had it coming, sorry.
---
My 2 caps.
---
Yes I'm on PS4. How much do you want to sell it for.
---
What plans?
---
I mean what would the need really be for that many caps? Unless you were out buying your weapons from other people instead of getting them yourself?
---
Come back in 6 months when it‚Äôs officially dead 
---
Humans on a sub - eh, close enough.
---
Wow, thank you. How kind! I knew people were out there that are understanding and use logic before hasty conclusions. I'm still shocked from your response, compared to all the backlash people have taken the time to write. Thank you.
---
I would recommend instead of having crossed out icons to just remove the icon if no mic, no pvp, not looking for group. Saves UI space. I'd also recommend having a toggle to have it show constantly, or whenever you highlight the player directly so it helps with immersion and reduce clutter.
---
&gt;"For the time when you want literally everything in camouflage patterns"
---
Did they remove this line from the description?
---
Pipe gets both pistol and rifle perks so can probably outclass hunting
---
Perception gives you better VATS accuracy mostly. 1 point doesn't make much difference if yours is high enough.
---
Hm...I will try that
---
My situation is very similar. Never duped but had one drop a large pile of guns in front of me and I put it on a mule as well. I figured it wasn‚Äôt that bad considering everyone is running around with duped TSE guns at this point. Got the ban as well and trying to fight it. I‚Äôm hoping the screenshots of psn messages showing what happened will prove I never duped. 
---
What stinks is these things have been happening but when you explain it the entire community goes into attack mode and tells you that you shouldn‚Äôt be able to play the game. 
---
I've got like almost 70 bulk. I know it's good to save but I just don't seem to be using it for anything... 
---
On Consoles, text chat is not a good option, so I would like to have a "Turn on your Mic" emote, and for those that don't have one, I would suggest a trip to Best Buy, Game Stop, Walmart, with about $8 to get one, they are cheap for a basic headset, and all my Xbox Consoles came with one.
---
Multiplayer games all have Chat for a reason, if you simply don't wish to use it, then kindly understand that others may not wish to deal with you if they can't communicate with you.
---
Trading is the worst when people want to trade, but are only interested in purchasing my Primary weapons, which I am not interested in selling.
---
And that's why the Dart Gun no longer exists.
---
try windowskey+L if you crash, it should bring up the lock menu. it's more powerful!
---
Dude, the RP thing would be great. Ideally I'd love to see RP servers but I know those don't usually work cause people like to go on them and troll.
---
Some of the best times I've had in this game were light RP with others players I met. Basically just discussing the game world, things we find, figuring out environmental storytelling, etc.
---
One guy I travelled with on foot for a while, and we found a gas station and inside there was a box with two Gwinnet Stout or whatever its called. We took it as a sign and shared a beer together in game, had a little toast, and poured one in RL as well. Was really fun
---
Have a ton of camp plans some weapons and recipes if your interested more then happy to let you look thru them when I get home.
---
I still don't see how me being incredibly new to Fallout online am being ignorant of receiving something that just about any player would find to be amazing if they had not known previously the issues Fallout 76 was under going. But I do appreciate your feedback.
---
If you're having a bad time...
---
\*soft rock Megalovania in the background\*
---
i cant bulk mine, how do you do that?
---
You beautiful bastard you &lt;3 thank you!
---
I'd say you could have their name greyed out for "mystery mode"
---
Enforcer isn‚Äôt very reliable for me üò™ I‚Äôll cripple something and it‚Äôll it pop right back up, glitchy glitchy
---
The first time, if solo, will take you a while. The more you do it, the faster you will be at it. With an experienced party, you can do it in roughly 10-15 minutes. As a solo player, I've got it down to about 25 minutes. Would be less if I wouldn't loot stuff.
---
You're not wrong about her damage resistance a scaling, but there is also a weirdo bug where she stops taking damage sometimes.
---
It's happened to me twice. I use a Furious Faster Firing Gatling Gun, I can watch her health bar move as I fire. Sometimes, it doesn't move. I've had this happen with 20 people firing at her and 5 people firing at her. Both times, after 2-3 minutes, she'd land, reset, heal, then be fine taking damage again.
---
That doesn't sound like much fun. How did he track you? He shouldn't be able to see you on the map if he has a bounty.
---
Women would always have this off, even if they were DTF. Spam mail too strong.
---
You put a second switch next to that switch. Provide that switch with bindependent power. Wire said switch to the MIDDLE of the door. There's your door override switch.
---
Place it close enough to the door opening so you can close it from inside or outside your camp door
---
Raise it to 125K and make it account-wide so I don't have to shuffle caps between characters.
---
Yes! Xbox 1 S.       The update killed it for me. I get so frustrated I have also decided to stop playing for a while. Hopefully they will fix what ever has caused all of the problems lately.  
---
Sry to hear that u got ripped off =S
---
Well someone has completely missed the point, ironically calling ME the dong...
---
Again, if I was the only person there that I'm the one who actually triggered them (meaning not even the owner of the base was NOT there, there was NOBODY but ME) then who has a right to them... Me or his CAMP placed to deliberately interfere with people farming a Whitesprings hot spot?
---
Think about it this time...
---
It compiles, ship it!
---
That's typically what I heard from people. My shop was themed and looked professional. I gave excellent deals on just about every item I had. I loved the feedback and really loved how often people continued to message me to trade. I would have loved to have traded with you. It really was so much fun.
---
I saw your post and remembered this...I wasn't even in cali at the time, but somehow heard about it.
---
[Carne asada is not a crime](http://saveourtacotrucks.org/)
---
But it sounds like an awesome idea. 
---
My man.
---
Learn to use blueprints too, sometimes blueprints work when stored structures can‚Äôt be placed. 
---
Xbox, same.  Tons and tons of crashes and disconnects, usually within 30 seconds of zoning or loading in.
---
I've bought both Voice of Set and Black Ice from vendors before I ever got them as quest rewards. Felt like a waste of caps when I got them for free, but oh well.
---
There was literally nothing in their statement that should've lead you to your conclusion. It's like me getting mad because they nerfed scorchbeasts, based one that statement. There's nothing even implying it.
---
Yes, because then you can vendor it.
---
Do you notice the build I am talking about is how melee builds get broken as all hell.
---
Yeah, only bolt action, and they have to have a scope.
---
Get a mic. Meet people. Have fun. It's just a game.
---
Never ever ever bulk steel
---
Crafting prioritises your **mods** with steel in them over bulked steel. So messed up....
---
I was thinking of starting a shop, but I have nothing good to sell. If you made a full shop and everything that would've been awesome to see 
---
Definitely saves on space if you tight, also gives you some small xp for your efforts. I like it because it keeps it nice and neat, not everything can bulk unfortunately but I do it every now and then. A stash of say 600, may go down to about 550 after bulking. You are using plastic, so it goes down just from that alone.
---
It‚Äôs part of the quest Miner Miracles: [Wiki](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Miner_Miracles) 
---
I always dump ammo I don't use and spare plans at vendors. Just hoping someone can make use of them.
---
My camp is built specifically in a little nook. I couldn't move it if I wanted to. Even if it did work I wouldn't be able to just move it back. I'd have to rebuild the whole thing piece by piece and frankly I'd rather just deal with the repairs.
---
The only issue I have with this, is the only way for me to transfer anything to an alt is to put it in a world container and log on the same server via finding a random person via recent who was on the same server.  (I have no Xbox friends)  Nothing game breaking, but one character found the marine wetsuit plans and I vastly prefer that look to the vault suit....  Give me shared account storage and/or all plans are learned by the account and I'm all for it!  
---
Still, I apologize, but no I didn't see it coming. That's why I ended my explanation stating I wish I had been smarter, because I am not an exploiter and would never want to be claimed as one. I remained unapologetic because I was a victim of it all, and even when I came into possession of so much I didn't brag or hold it above others. Instead I did something fun that reflected my play style and received lots of great feedback. I still do not think I should apologize for being introduced to Fallout 76 in this way.
---
Wow, thank you. I forgot all about that keybind. I always use Ctrl L for address bar and new page in a CLI, but managed to forget about that. i will try it *when* it happens again. 
---
Eh, I‚Äôve got a lot of time on my hands. What can I say? 
---
This is wrong. Thank you.
---
Been broken since last patch 
---
If only up and down votes were actually representative of interesting and uninteresting, or positive and hateful‚Äîinstead its based on whether or not one likes or dislikes what is said, and that tends to be a mere reflection of whether or not the comment echoes your own thoughts. 
---
If my off the cuff idea is awful, then that‚Äôs probably a good reason to downvote and respond with something better, or at least with why it‚Äôs bad. I have terrible ideas all the time‚Äîlearning what I‚Äôm missing in an argument is important to refining the argument and coming up with an idea that‚Äôs actually good, or at least better. 
---
I don‚Äôt at all think that this thread is on the side of griefers; the opposite, in fact. My aside about auto-downvotes is borne of experience‚Äîthat said, if the tone of this sub were in the opposite direction, I‚Äôd fully expect comments to receive the same treatment. 
---
Or use t60 so cheap to repair
---
I don't remember that issue with FO4, and I've played it through many times, taking different paths.
---
They are a bit glitch sometimes, but not like I'm experiencing with FO76.
---
70,000 pounds worth of free items, some god rolled, in a survival game with 250-350 carry weight and RNG loot is not amazing. It is obviously of illicit origin. Not only did you take those items without having a second thought, you proceeded to distribute them and now claim you are a victim? This is just laughably ignorant.
---
Well I will have a look for it if i remember and try to comment as objective as I can. Downvotes never bother me. Rude and toxic posts are boring though. I do think it is a fair and simple solution to a big problem. Especially if duping starts again or i still going on, via dropping glitches, both scenarios are highly probable.
---
The duplicator who knew the extent of the crime. I was new and any amount of items whether it be a thousand pounds or 100,000 pounds was sure to impress me.
---
I kind of get the feeling that the main playerbase is a more single player rpg oriented.  
---
So not being accustomed to games that have any degree of pvp, there seems to be a tendency to label ANY aspect of the PvP system as "griefing".  
---
Personally I don't agree there is such a thing as griefing outside of perhaps using the voice chat to hurl slurs though even that wouldn't bother me personally.  But I can agree that people should be able to play video games without having other players spewing hateful/racist/homophobic etc nonsense.  
---
But levelling my camp?  killing me in PvP? These are in game systems that are intentionally setup to be used.  None of those things are "Griefing" and especially when you can block players, server hop, and rebuild your entire camp for the simple cost of caps to move it.
---
But the timescale in the game is 20:1, so that real-world hour that it takes you to run 15 miles is actually 20 in-game hours, dropping your run speed to 0.75 mph.
---
Incidentally, the real-world area covered by the map should be more like 100 miles across rather than 5, so the 20:1 timescale nicely corrects for the compressed distances on the map.
---
Same on PS4 - also I get double loading screens now.  
---
I have also fallen through the earth and been critically injured in doing so.  It was very annoying.  
---
I also see "walls" of terrain but can walk through the walls to see bits and pieces of what is actually supposed to be there.
---
Fun times.
---
It was awesome. And a lot of fun. Thank you.
---
Most accurate statement I've ever read
---
Fine by me
---
I hope they let you back into your account somehow :)
---
Lol üòÇ
---
Not according to facts presented by you. You received illicit items, then proceeded to distribute them. Only thing wrong with this is you somehow believing you are the victim of a wrongful ban.
---
It doesn‚Äôt really save space because the only thing that‚Äôs being reduced is the amount of plastic you have.
---
The only the that bulking is really useful for is organization and being able to sell your raw materials that you otherwise can‚Äôt sell on their own.
---
Camden Park
---
Drop lifegiver at 15 hp. Pick up rejuvenated rank 2 for a 13 hp increase as well as more ap regen and diesase resistance. Put that extra point into thru hiker in agility
---
&lt;3 Go forth and bash in heads with it, you hunk. 
---
Who has trouble with food come find me lol i juat cooked about 70 pieces of meat from one looting run lol
---
Found marine armour plans in Camden park. As you say I don't think sturdy or heavy combat armour plans exist 
---
Yep, have this on PS4.
---
I didn't say anything about griefing. This post was in reference to this sub.
---
Most of this is untrue. I never encouraged duplicated items, and if anything, from the feedback I got form numerous players who had been playing since release, I was giving back to the community and making the game "fair" again. I heard that so often.
---
&gt;I spent about an hour in a nuked Whitespring last night. I used 9 of my 11 fusion cores before I realised what was happening. 
---
Sweet zombie jesus, I can't even get through one in an hour, but I don't do a lot of VATS targeting and only have rank 2 power user. I am also at the point where I try not to worry too much about cores...since I keep picking them up despite saying I won't. For the record, I have 88 now. 
---
üëç gt KnowledgeHound I‚Äôll be free after work tomorrow 
---
I‚Äôve gotten a couple plans from treasure maps. Mods I think I‚Äôve found (rarely) at Watoga or harpers ferry vendors. Not 100% sure that‚Äôs where but I think so. The mods for the excavator suit don‚Äôt say excavator though do they are easy to miss. They just say things like ‚Äúcalibrated shocks‚Äù or ‚Äúrusty knuckles‚Äù 
---
camden park vender look for mods made with black Ti.
---
I've done the same. I'll come back when there is more end game tailored towards my needs. 
---
I'm currently playing Monster Hunter World and having a damn good time. 
---
Big badaboom
---
This happens to me, too. It is one of the single most infuriating bug I experience in this game. What the hell causes it?!
---
It's not very difficult, if you're not great at combat just get the keycard and find a group. Anyone in a team can do the actual launching and you'll complete your quest.
---
Known bug now for a bit
---
It impressed you, yet you still accepted it without questioning. Once again, ignorance, which is not an excuse from consequences.
---
I have i need power armor, armor and weapon plans. What you got ? 
---
I lost my bloodied gatling gun to a similar bug. Thanks for the help recovering that Bethesda /s.
---
It just seems strange to me that "Power Armor" power can't be used for sprinting long distances, particularly since that would be an advantage in battle and therefore a design consideration.
---
What weapon and armor plans? I have some marine. I also have a few ultracite plans
---
MODUS was doing the only thing he could; follow his programing. Unfortunately, his programing was to follow the orders of the senior Enclave member on site, who happened to be the megalomaniac, traitorous idiot Eckhart. Then his programming got corrupted, and all hell broke loose (or was sealed in and suffocated, as the case may be.)
---
As we repair MODUS, I'm petitioning that his new programing include subroutines to reject orders that would harm the Enclave as a whole (such as killing more than half of the Enclave personnel on site.) And I concur, General Santiago did this fine country a service in stopping Eckhart's foolhardy plans.
---
The best is when you are trying to hide/escape from one so you climb up to the top of a building which has a dirt pile on the roof and then the radscorpion pops out of the dirt pile and kills you with DOTs.
---
I have a secret spot that often spawns two along with a ranger outfit, so c600 value for 0.3 weight. 
---
Please assume the position. 
---
Harper's ferry and Phoenix 
---
I need a couple ultracite mods.. What you got in marine ? 
---
Also the water park is great for plastic. The multistack cups, cups with straws, most of the toys, and life preservers/rings.
---
Yup, this is what I see most high-levels doing. Always worth it to check while you're running by 
---
Some different limbs
---
But...but...what about the Rad-X, Toy Car, and 308 ammo (5)?
---
From the Jan 9th Inside the vault.
---
This patch will continue to add fixes for issues being voiced by the community, including the number of plans Vendors have available...
---
I read about someone just storing their decon arch until they need it, to avoid from it getting destroyed and having to rebuild
---
Calibrated shocks ?
---
Harper's Ferry, Camden and Welch definitely have excavator mods. Possibly others too.
---
Hey, thanks for adding more spot to farm for people! Your last encounter is weird, you should have found a plan on the body regardless of whether or not you already learned of the outfit. 
---
What? Is that for real?
---
Using your logic, I could state the same. Seems like a nice guy but not sure if he really understands what's going on. I do not use Reddit. This was my first post of ever and it was to explain my situation. Many have lashed, are cruel and unforgiving, which I knew would be the case. However, I am an experienced gamer, and was a huge reason why I took the items to begin with, because I imagined they took hours upon hours of gameplay to acquire, I learned so much about both Fallout 76 and its community soon after.
---
Yes does not apply to those
---
I believe so
---
Join a different server 
---
On pc? I have an assassin/50% limb damage/something else 3 star railway rifle you can have lol. Weight reduction I think is the 3rd star.
---
Sorry this doesn‚Äôt answer your question but I‚Äôm curious since you‚Äôre using it: Does it bug a lot for you? I was using one a while ago but stopped because 50% of the time it would do no damage because the projectile got stuck on an invisible barrier in front of the enemy 
---
Ha I was gonna say the same thing.  Glad many others saw that too lol
---
This. This is why your game failed, bethesda, because you never let your devs finish making it. 
---
Yes, if you go under the social menu you can block him, it will make it so you wont join his word and it makes you invisible on his map for your current session.
---
... Unless you have a ton and want to sell it to a vendor.  Then bulk half of your steel.
---
Gamers are terrible.  To paraphrase Wargames, "the only way to win is not to play."
---
Playing with friends.
---
I hope you have waiters that occasionally snatch plates from tables, replacing them a couple of minutes later, to simulate a random disconnect. 
---
We should at least have 16 basic colours available without shelling out $$$ for item-specific skins.
---
Happens to me.  Turning away from the target usually stops it for me.
---
That‚Äôs a great idea; and they both seem like they work well together. I think if I understood that the defense of my CAMP was more important, that would help‚Äîa lot of the CAMP build, especially for solo players, feels cosmetic rather than practical. Also, I think I‚Äôd need to be assured that defending my CAMP wouldn‚Äôt affect my Pacifist Mode status. 
---
If your words are true, I wish you luck. Just doesn't seem fair we are lumped with the rest of them.
---
Sweet anything else good ? 
---
hmm, idk. The vertibot grenade doesn't have a max range, I don't think. It could, though. Are you really far away from the workshop?
---
Is he following you server to server? You can mute and block him on current server as well.
---
A similar thing happened to me last week, I was running around with my 2 shot lever action, when I decided to log off for a bit and when I came in it was gone from my inventory and stash and it had been replaced in my quick select wheel by my prototype xo-1 right arm. 
---
It made me extremely annoyed because surely by now Bethesda should have discovered the source of these glitches and fixed them.
---
And I was also extremely sad because it was the first TSE weapon I‚Äôd ever gotten. And I love lever actions there one of my most favourite weapons.
---
Pvp is part of the game so join a different server and block the player on xbox. 
---
Thanks!!!
---
I don‚Äôt think so, unless you‚Äôre interested in raider and wood armorüòÇ
---
I want no symbols. They don't jive with pvp. 
---
Ever PvP against someone with an open mic? *Wheres he hiding? Oh hes over there under the yellow mic symbol*
---
It's always a good opportunity for me to bust out my Vampire's Auto Tesla Rifle and tag me some mole men.
---
i bulk everything if it dont save space it sure is better organized and i sell a lot of it..
---
I have the skeleton outfit and I leveled hard bargain to 3 with 3 chr and now they sell for 53.... It's annoying because I then have to switch hard bargain out and sell another for 30ish. 
---
At hard bargain 2 they sold for exactly 50.. I wanna get back to that just for qol since I got the recipe on a level 9 mule so I can test all the level locked vendor loot 
---
What makes the enclave varient different. Does it do more damage?
---
Being in denial is laughable. I wrote an honest, detailed explanation and people still claim I have taken my free time to explain a bunch of lies. Many will try to change my opinion and that of others, but players that stay logical will understand my perspective. Thank you.
---
This might be considered an exploit :P doubt it's intentional at least xD but yeah, it works.
---
I found them dead with a dead travelling merchant, so....
---
The flare gun showing up on a legendary enemy seems like a new thing and sucks balls.
---
ü§£ü§£ well i need so ill take cal shocks n maybe whatever gun plans you got ? 
---
Yeah Bethesda will look at that excuse and laugh that you didn't question something that removes a major piece of gameplay.  If you don't want to worry about collecting supplies then this is the absolute wrong game for you.  Collecting things, scavenging, getting excited finding a bunch of screws kinda a massive chunk of this game.
---
"How nice that I don't have to worry about my health because I can infinitely heal myself and I don't have to explore to find stimpaks!" Come on, you knew that was cheating and not a normal part of the gameplay.  
---
Once I wandered with a mr.handy throught the rocks in a forest without see enemies. What a waste of time. And the messages are too stupid lol 
---
I found the knuckles plan at a red rocket in the ash heap
---
I got a full set from a quest and didn‚Äôt realize it till several hours latter.
---
You both took and distributed them, thus proving there is demand for them, which is an encouragement for duplication. Whether you choose it to be true or not, your actions have contributed to both duping and destabilizing the economy of the game. But judging by your other responses, the ignorance multiplied by the victim complex is too much in this case for actual logic to affect anything. Well-deserved ban because being ignorant to this point is even worse than just being an admitted duper.
---
Was it the brother hood of steal quest ?
---
Same here, probably the same for OP
---
... What? Is your comment worded wierdly or very contradictory?
---
Thanks, Kydoemus. :)
---
I did some tests before posting this. Grenades triggers immidiately
---
Oh, no I questioned. I was told all sorts of lies and misleading stories. Farming, collecting, trading between higher levels, friends that knew things. All which make sense to a new player. I was only told about possible duplication after I had opened my shop and began to trade with a large part of the Fallout population. 
---
What legendaries do you have
---
Point not missed. I don't agree. The internet people dont understand that people can disagree. 
---
Camp placed, someone walks by and the turrets ment to protect camp shoot at bad guys.....is that guy an ass?
---
Aren't the ghouls in nuked zones the only things that share loot....  and those limited to hardened masses, high radiation fluids and such?  or am I mistaken?
---
DTF? Like ‚Äúdown to fromticate‚Äù? 
---
Thank you. I just want to play, I couldn't care less about the items.
---
Ok, of course the same logic applies regarding my persona. My review of your text and situation still stands. Even as it stands now without knowing whats true in your post, it is still a clean ban in my book. You should have known better from the start or at least earlier along the way. 
---
‚ÄùI didnt knoooooow the gun was loaded aaaand I am so sorry my friend. I didnt knooooow.....‚Äù üòè
---
Most of the posts I see here are civil.  I don't really see where this is coming from. 
---
I was in the middle of launching the nuke, I was in the targeting computer when my entire game crashed, causing me to lose all that hard work, all my ammo and stimpacks.
---
Damn. DAMN. Lol my condolences. I lost an x-01 calibrated shock mod to a server disconnect. I've more recently lost a bloodied gatling gun to a bug very similar to OP's. Thankfully I got a mutants gatling gun to replace it so I at least have something, but still I lost my favorite heavy gun with my favorite legendary effect (when paired with adrenal reaction).
---
From what I understand it looks different and seems more accurate. Not sure on damage as I have never seen stats on a fully kitted out one.
---
You really don't *need* to put 9 points into damage boosts unless your main concern is the number displayed under damage on your stats sheet...
---
Umm... could you confirm that the outfits you're selling list a base value of 200 in the pip-boy? Because I tested this extensively with a bunch of different items, and even at 23 charisma with hard bargain 3 and the grape mentats effect there was no way to go above 25% sell value.
---
Nah it's cool bro thanks. Railway rifles was not on my list of must have. Really aprettiate the offer though üòã
---
This is the ignorant backlash I and others receive. That many people think they know what I didn't. My story continues to hold. Thank you.
---
If it comes to it you could always make a new account? 
---
I‚Äôm doing what you‚Äôre doing. My time is worth something 
---
So mote it be...
---
But, both apparently.
---
I agree that being in denial is laughable. Makes your post and responses even more ironic. You continuously deny being part of the problem and contributing to it, yet that's all you've done.
---
Upgrade your cpu :) /s
---
Thanks, where do.u get them btw? And can you get legendary variation of it?
---
I'd be willing to chalk that up to SBQ being a laggy mess more than anything else. 
---
For the Halloween outfits, which the are best for selling, just spawn at Freddys house up in the north east of the mire... Run down the hill and you'll see a crashed red semi truck on the road... Right in front of that truck there's an event spawn that can have a trick or treater corpse, and they have a chance to drop the outfit plan... Just keep server hopping there 'til you get it, it's the fastest way.... Be warned it can take a while though... Or you can get lucky... 
---
Took me about a half hour on my mule but it's rng. 
---
Maybe not a good idea at all; certainly has an old world feel to it. In a kind of medieval or post-apoc sense, it‚Äôs retributive. An eye for an eye; you burn down my house, salt my fields, and kill all my livestock, should you get to relax by your fire with a nice Lagavulin and some Cram?
---
That would immediately be exploited by the trading ecosystem, and everyone‚Äôll be sporting ‚ÄúH: TSE: W: UnyieldingSentinel‚Äù text.

The only time I've had to repair my Excavator in 60 levels is when I blow myself up a few too many times it breaks my legs.
---
Happens to me if I open it before my game fully loads in. Typically when I load in, my water/food/ap will all be wrong (usually at 0), I just wait for that to refresh to avoid the pipboy issue
---
"I'm a Lone Wanderer and don't want to group. Sorry!"
---
The power plants will give the generator plans.
---
There's a fo76 mod for this
---
Actually I did the math and....wait...I'm done taking a poop, I'll finish this next poop.
---
I feel like an idiot thanksüòÇ
---
Point completely missed... All turrets are placed on an elevated platform and faced in the same direction with intent to fire directly into the windows in order to aggro the Ghouls that other players are attempting to kite.
---
What on earth are you struggling to understand about this?
---
Because of you, I am now required to rewatch The Fifth Element 3 times before bed
---
That's where I leave mine. I just hope they stay in there long enough to get taken by someone else. I'd feel so much better about it if I knew they stayed there until a player took them.
---
Same here lol I build and was never able to recreate , so I just eat the damages ( contractor perk level 2 helps )
---
Now you're using jibberish to attempt to prove an illogical point. Being a victim is a very really thing whether people believe it to be so or not. Erase my items, do not ban a player caught up between people like you and the exploiters. Thank you.
---
Free travel yes please. heck even structure it that you'll be refunded the travel cost if you complete the event.
---
Travel while encumbered no. 
---
Same here, am also looking for friendlies. Am in EU timezone, on PC. I'm a lvl 34 female stealth sniper in cultist bindings, name is BlagoBuster. Please add me, see ya!
---
I love one violent night.
---
That's the one where you play the musical instruments right?
---
I think a 3 star wendigo spawns at the end most of the time. Basically turn on the jukebox and stand back.
---
&gt; a power fist really seems like something PA should just come with)
---
You can mod PA to essentially have the power fist as an accessory. Hydraulic arm mod or something like that.
---
Also the furious legendary effect caps at 30% damage and it takes a while to get there. I'd rather have like 10 or 15% damage on a weapon that does more damage to begin with. You'll get more dps out that way and your damage buff doesn't go away when you start attacking the next mob.
---
With regards to the atom shop: I believe we already have the next few atom shop items in the game files. I could be wrong but we've seen it posted here already. Besides, they (devs) aren't all working on the same thing. Some people are bug fixing and others are doing new content. It's not a choice between fixing something or adding something.
---
What a great idea. Give people already dealing with social anxiety a bit sign that says I have social anxiety to put above their head. 
---
Someone hand me the medal box. 
---
But what about CAMP owners who don't want to PvP at all? Insentivising destruction of camps forced them to participate or not build at all.
---
These ideas are great, but would make more sense on a dedicated PvP server.
---
Yet here you are.. 
---
I was an Assaultron like you until I took a shot to the knee. 
---
I play as an Australian Aboriginal and enjoy getting into character.  Not that there are likely to be many of us blackfullas in Appalachia but hey - there‚Äôs weirder things than that out in the wasteland.  
---
I just wish there were some better skins than Wildman Rags.  
---
Keep an eye out for me - I‚Äôll be trying to bludge beer and smokes off you and don‚Äôt mind getting charged off a few chems either.
---
Fort Defiance is full of them. Also great for farming ammo bags and m.g. duct tape. 
---
As long as it‚Äôs balanced to power usage I agree, I‚Äôm in PA 99% of the time and sprinting and now the marsupial mutation makes the game so much fun 
---
Are they going to get rid of legendary drop probability distributions by then?
---
Same, RIP bloodied gatling gun.
---
Also Ammo. You'll burn through a mountain of lead, your guns will break, and then when you get it to 10% hp the server will disconnect you. (I'm still bitter).
---
Alternatively, if you do manage to kill it you just get some meat and a crappy trapper leg or something.
---
Yes I'm getting sick of opening a trade post to find the exact same TSE guns on offer. I think if they didn't exist people might actually try to sell other kinds of weapons.
---
Have you tried removing or changing the mods on the armor? Just shooting in the dark here but maybe one of them doesn't play nicely with chameleon mutation. 
---
So, your restating what I ended my post with? I stated that I wish I had been smarter about it all. Then I would have steered away form all of this, especially the hate. Thank you for restating my ignorance, but I summed my own stupidity by stating I should have been smarter.
---
K 
---
That's why when I use the Anti-material the enemies surrender! It's a french weapon!
---
K
---
Just up all the limits now. I'm sitting at 585 stash and it's all junk. Thought by selling or passing on my saved guns and armour it'd give me lots more room. It did not
---
Well hey if they smooth out them server slip me a message and I‚Äôll give it another go
---
That said, powerplants give 8 full cores an hour.   Super useful.  My new character got 20+ cores while questing on the first day and also using the workshops as free fast travel :)
---
Ah I'm in the UK, literally the other side of the planet :/
---
You can get the gun from the Enclave. (Asking about plans now)
---
Not sure on legendary drops
---
Sure! That would be awesome!
---
It is a real thing. You, however, are a collaborator, not a victim. The ban and many opinions of others here who you didn't bribe with cheap duped items so you can now say "well, people I gave this crap to liked me" seem to agree.
---
Try server hopping
---
Lol. I am a f76 fanboy but LOL dude üòÇ
---
OG Xbox believe it or not
---
They are gone if:
---
2. Someone else already picked them up in that world.
---
2. You already picked them up and you are the one who causes the cell to load.
---
Same here.  MHW turned out to be a great distraction.  On PC you can even overwrite the shitty decoration RNG distribution, unlike some games...
---
That's fair and I agree w you about that. 
---
Ive had this happen at Monongah Power, ghouls were underground and I couldn't finish the defend quest...
---
Wow, you really are a fucking idiot huh? Do you not see the developers responding to our requests and complaints? Yes they released the game with problems, but without people buying and playing it then they won't know what problems to fix without devoting most of their time to playtesting instead of fixing.
---
Yeah, aren't you down to fromticate? JK, it actually means "door to frontgate," it's a symbolic way to express they're leaving your life for good.
---
Only since the last patch.  Never had before.
---
It's just not worth the hassle to me. This is how I was introduced to the online Fallout experience. I'd rather just not get involved with anymore of Bethesda's mishaps, especially when the majority of the community has been so cruel. I love Fallout with a passion and will play a game however I want, without resorting to exploits or cheats, but I'd rather not be categorized as a bad person for something I learned about being a new player. Thanks for your response.
---
Its the comments, not the posts.
---
So its ok for them to blow up ppl homes, but we're not allow to let there paint get scratch?
---
\&gt;make the game better
---
That's where I disagree and have given concrete examples of why text chat would be bad. MMO culture is toxic.
---
Try Notes! A lot of them force you to read them when you pick them up, so they get a full face screen.
---
My favorite is the I.O.U. Beer note in one of the Mire bunkers. I'll drop one in a bag when I take something. Usually a really low quantity so they don't miss it but they don't know what's gone. 
---
Other notes work well too, they always sort to the top of the bag, and you can organize them by title so you can get little messages ready to go if you're intentional.
---
It's stupid and a lot of work, but hey, making death a lil less lame right?
---
&gt;We are all probably encumbered
---
Not in my experience..
---
Even my former hoarder friends have made some changes to their habits at this point.
---
I think I have the knuckles plan, actually. 
---
Add Higupon. Ill take em
---
Ranger outfits are also good value, thought they are harder to farm.
---
Oh I know. The reality that we're playing a game and we can do looting runs I think is probably not where OP is coming from. I'm not sure why OP thinks people wouldn't fight each other when put into a life and death scenario!
---
Besides... who is fighting? I've only been attacked about 3 times in 350+ hours.
---
Huh. I thought it was bulk. Maybe it's not. 
---
&gt; After the nerf ppl are going to learn mechanics or fail.
---
Yes it's going to be so awful when this fight takes five minutes instead of one.
---
Many people keep using metaphors and hypothetical situations to sum up my situation. That doesn't work, this situation is very unique and was aimed towards any new player not knowing what Fallout 76 had to offer. I have accepted my ban. Only hoping I may play again, with consideration that I am no enemy and had no illicit intent. Thank you.
---
thanks mate! its all about not having turrets.
---
Have you *seen* the crazies out in the wastes?  ;)
---
You got it!
---
That's correct. I just dump my left over steel in vendor cash registers now, haha
---
Don't wreck my endgame üòã
---
Have you read the stuff on the computer?
---
My experience has been that it's generally 24 hours after I have done it before I can again. 
---
That's what I thought - that outside of the Queen fight, you see the same Barbed Walking Cane Mod and 3 caps that I do, and whoever's first to grab it gets them.
---
You can get a good bit from the burning mine, it's also a nice dungeon for some loot/exp for low-mid levels
---
Its a daily, so im not sure if it only spawns on specific days or can happen on anyday on any server.
---
I did it awhile back and maybe 1 trip in 10 to harpers ferry procs it for me.
---
Sorry I cant help more.
---
Fair enough, Bethesda did us dirty with this game and even dirtier with how they're handling things. I wish the fallout community had stayed stronger during this :/ 
---
There is zero reason to stack RR on gear at the moment. Just take chems. But even then, it won't be enough for nuclear bomb areas.
---
Very nice
---
No, I'm saying it's ignorant of you to cry victim after the fact.
---
I (thankfully) haven't ever met anyone on any of my toons who is destructive. I've helped several people and had many visitors stop by and give me props on my house, some even dropped stuff as thanks for use of the benches. One of them dropped me an I.O.U. Beer. lol Best gift so far.
---
I bought Radium Rifle Plans from Watoga at level 29 last night.
---
Cost me like 600 caps, and I can't craft it yet, but it doesn't seem to be level locked like he Handmade Plans.
---
Good to hear. I just got it the other night and defeated my first SB.  Went to repair it and nothing, I was surprised,  This was after going through Big Bend tunnel and Watoga as well. 
---
I'm ALWAYS overencumbered and stash is ALWAYS full because I know if I drop it I WILL need it later
---
It's a daily challenge isn't it oh I forgot that I though it was just an event that you can easily do again
---
Ihave all the useless mutations (and the good ones) and have had them for a while, none of them are that useless though. Bu i guess i need to fix serums for a select few instead soon. Just that farming caps is so boring...
---
The game is a turd sandwich.
---
If you are playing it now, you made a mistake.
---
I played it from release, as a single player game.  That's what you can do with this product in the state it's in.  Finish the story, launch a nuke, and move on.  If you try to do anything outside of that very narrow use-case, you will be angry and disappointed.
---
No point coming back in 6 months.  Wait for the next Fallout.
---
One of the robots should‚Äôve been the merchant.
---
Well I got to admit that there was no stuttering or crashes to desktop since I did what the OP suggested. I've played for approx 2 hrs and just come to report that the fix seems to of worked for me :)
---
Maybe preset chats then like overwatch and rocketleague
---
Gun bash is how I find that I'm out of grenades.
---
They haven't fixed this yet?
---
Rumor started as far as I can tell by someone saying retail copies are quietly being pulled from shelves. Which leads to the assumption of free to play coming soon. Of course nothing has been verified in any way shape or form.
---
Im reading this while pooping.
---
Will read next poop
---
/r/nocontext
---
I've used a few hundred treasure maps and never gotten a legendary. I read in another post here that it is not possible.
---
The rabbit hole goes much, much deeper. 
---
Here you go: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/acb6uw/proposed_yardstick_damage_build_not_weapon/?st=JR6W49WU&amp;sh=a4633076
---
You can *ansolutely* run a dual-stack STR and PER build with both meaningfully maxed. 
---
Also, explosive is just something people who don‚Äôt know how to aim, or pick weapons that don‚Äôt hit over 90% of what they shoot, use to compensate. And it‚Äôs not proximity safe, even if you fave your life away to the grind, and put together a solid pile of sentinel legendary effect armor. 
---
The real deal is Bloodied. 
---
Was it near the Charleston Train station? If so, it likely belonged to the rare vendor who spawns there. 
---
Yea so nothing has changed. During my time period I didny eat anything. Just drank purified water. Didn't changed any perk cards. 
---
Many, many thanks - from both my eyes : )
---
This happens with legendaries.  if it's happening with everything for you...ouch.
---
Lol well I didn't figure you'd want it, but hey on the off chance you did...
---
I have 2 chests. One with jetpack and one with reactive plates. Is it worth getting this one as well for fun? To swap with I mean.
---
If your on xbox ill give you some free üòÇ
---
Oh. What do you get from them depending on the location?
---
FOTM?
---
Yeah I liked him for a few hot minutes until I came to the realization of just how click-baity is thumbnails and titles are. 
---
Actually there is if it actually stacked I mod to lead lined and take radshield it‚Äôs more rad resistance than power armor can run nuke zones just fine with it. Thanks for your input but maybe run some numbers first
---
Pretty sure. Always how i dealt with the deathskull radscorpions. VATS their legs. Make them slow or just completely immobilized.
---
Too late itll be nerfed next cause everyone will complain about it.
---
Here is that same cruel backlash I have been witnessing before I myself even attempted to post. Attempting to say mean things and lowering people to some standard that you define, is not facts. Furthermore, many people I met never even traded with me but still respected me for what I was doing and how I was going about it. I respect all opinions, but when people back those opinions with cruel intent and misunderstanding  it's difficult for me to continue to explain any sort of the situation or care. Sometimes it really can only be summed as, we agree to disagree. Thanks for your feedback.
---
It was near Flatwoods.
---
Except anyone using sentinel assassin armor
---
I think if this is a part of the game, some people don‚Äôt understand this (I don‚Äôt, or I didn‚Äôt), so it‚Äôs distressing and unwelcome. 
---
to add to that, holding breathe for scoped aim steadying also same button
---
What a story, Mark.
---
Playing Fallout 76 with the shishkebab it's possible to look really cool while doing very little damage.
---
Vanguard is pretty good for Snipers (more res the higher your health), Sentinel (+15% less damage while standing and not moving) and -20% weapon weight reduced, they all stack additively, but there's some sort of a hard cap at \~85%. [All Legendary Affix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L5c8ZKCCf4OaNglGc516dl9AFxYWnMUDuhQbHjrlQkQ/edit#gid=178527913).
---
appreciate the tips, but you don‚Äôt have to give me ammo, i just got some luck traits anyway that will help me with getting ammo
---
I finished Back on the Beat earlier today.
---
I got a piece of leather armor, 40 caps, a diluted stim, and a rad-x.
---
Never again.
---
By the numbers?
---
I've had this happen too, server hopping fixed it for me. I was also missing everything on the text layer until I exited and reentered my power armor.
---
The entire game is fkin stupid 
---
is this a drake meme?
---
Haha I know  :D  seriously though hit me up if it happens and I'm happy to help supply some stuff.
---
Even worse, it's the same button as*hold breath*. 
---
On my sniper character, it's just instinctive to scope in and grab the Alt key for stability. 
---
On any other character, of when're I'm using a non-scoped weapon, doing that results in *click* ... **SHITSHITSHIT**
---
This guy gets it.
---
(PS4) Ive been getting a crap load of Ce-34878-0 after this last patch while in Whitesprings. Im not sure if its connected, however after turning down my DOV slider to about half or less, I was experiencing them less.
---
Worth a try I guess if nothing else has worked to this point. 
---
Good Luck. 
---
Let us know if it's a perfectly composed piece of art or a mess!:)
---
I might have just been respawning too close and I didn‚Äôt have many places to fast travel to at the time. I‚Äôm in agreement with you that pvp is totally a part of this game, this is the only really bad experience I had with what I would call griefing.
---
I'm having the same problem
---
Take batteries out controller put them back in.
---
Happens to me too 
---
no! they‚Äôre looking for things to nerf! don‚Äôt respond!
---
I didnt get any of the Mire dailies (Queen of the Hunt, the one with Boomer and the Nanny Robot in Berkley) since a while now... might be some issue with it this patch?!?
---
Fantastic! Love it!  
---
Just out of curiosity, what's exactly is the lower body part? (the one replacing the legs)
---
Awwwwwww yeeeeeh
---
I have 3 people and it sounds pretty good rn.
---
This is not crying. I have explained my situation as clearly and patiently as possible knowing many would say mean things in return. Even if the ban sticks, I will respect Bethesda and their reasoning for attempting to find exploiters and people working with them. i just will no longer support them because I first handily discovered that you can be blamed for enjoying what a game offers you. Thank you.
---
I‚Äôd love this toner the case‚ÄîI‚Äôve never engaged in PvP and don‚Äôt want to at all. At this point, I think I‚Äôd pay more money to move to a no-PvP server. 
---
On my 76th roll, I got a Two Shot Dragon. I guess that's fitting.
---
You should work for bethesda. Send this to them....
---
So do I. Thank you for your feedback.
---
VATS is pretty unreliable.  I usually just sorta aim at the groinal area.
---
It‚Äôs happening with everything unfortunately yeah, I have a video of a bunch of gulpers freaking out and then fixing themselves and chase me normally, I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre eventually are meant to get up after being crippled and left alone, but it‚Äôs just instant with me. It doesn‚Äôt really happen with robots however, I cripple an assaultron and it‚Äôll just crawl around on the ground üòÇ 
---
Oh Yeah, A small note about the Medusa, they do not swim but instead float!
---
I pretty much only sell clothing and chems to vendors. Most stuff is too heavy for the caps you get for selling.
---
It could be your internet but yeah this is a pretty big problem.
---
&gt;MMO culture is toxic.
---
That's where I disagree, I love online games and even met my partner this way (probably wouldn't of happened without text chat since girls often get harassed down the mic). Again, just because you wont miss it doesn't mean it isn't important. Honestly it's a basic, easy to add thing. If you don't like it, mute it and have global/area/team channels. 
---
Six-eight server drops a day are getting fucking old, yeah. 
---
It's not that explosive vents mod doesn't work, it's that *there is no landing damage in power armor whatsoever.*
---
So... It does increase the damage you do. But whatever % you increase from 0 is still 0.
---
Best wishes :)
---
I would be okay with this, the balance would be that you can only fast travel while overencumbered to your camp.
---
Cool write up! One thing, Strangler variants of Feral Ghouls do exist, I see them when I do the Heart of the Swamp event. They don't attack like you describe (they're just a ghoul variant) but just wanted to let you know they sort of exist. 
---
*Love* your camp ideas!
---
I ran into my first ones this week end  as well 2 guys, 1 lvl 239 and one at 176 tried to take my lvl 36's workshop kept toying with me, so I went to my stash and got the fat man I been saving and used the 11 mini nukes along with the bunker buster. And a Lot of missiles. After 20 min I finally got tired of it and switch servers
---
I would love to see scrapping a weapon or armor for the first time give you the base plan for said weapon or armor. 
---
I don't even care if they make it cost more to make them, just unlock the damn things. 
---
Bethesda, fix this.
---
Was it just me that read that as being the 'final thing'? We have power armour skin for it as well as combat armour.
---
Maybe it's just me but I didn't think I was getting every weapon skin in that deal.
---
There's a mod that fixes that, adds an icon in front of vendor's plans to show what you already have. Do a search on Nexus mods, I saw it there...
---
500 if I provide the mats? Awesome. 
---
What do I need for calibrated shocks? 
---
Have you considered starting a Discord? We‚Äôd be able to chat, coordinate, and trade a little easier. 
---
My camp is built site specific. When I'm ready to move I'll end up scrapping and building a new layout that is also site specific to the new location. Not everyone can move freely.
---
Just bulk everything with super duper and get chance of double
---
Flavor Of The Month.
---
How much rad/sec do you take in nuke zones? I can get like 2000 resist and still take 10/sec which is unfeasible.
---
*tries to put ultracite explosive vents plan up for sale; receives numerous demands to PAY to take them*
---
That's how useless they are.
---
Yeeeeeah, normally these problems are found in things called "alpha testing" and "beta testing", often followed by a little something called "open beta". So, no, they do NOT release then game and THEN look for problems, no. Not unless they are congenitally insane, or irretrievably stupid.
---
I hit a ghoul with an axe today and it basically did the same thing:  just stood there and *vibrated*.  I couldn't even loot it.
---
Still better than the ones that went below the floor though.
---
What was said by me to prove that you are being ignorant when claiming to be a victim here that you perceived as mean?
---
You took 70,000 pounds worth of free items without doing proper due dilligence on source of said items? Fact. And please don't say "I asked the duper". When someone hands you a bloodied knife, maybe ask a 3rd party for opinion, not the guy holding a severed human foot that's handing it to you saying it's just ketchup.
---
Many of those were multiple copies of rare, hard to obtain guns? Fact.
---
You proceeded to distribute those items? Fact.
---
All things above are facts stated by you, not me.
---
Sounds normal. What's your issue?
---
Thought this was a FO2 reference.
---
Now I understand OP is a Troll.
---
Only simbols I want on players name are faction/clan related if and when those systems become a thing. Otherwise what you suggested is cute, but takes off the wondering about someone else in game of the table.
---
‚ÄúFixed‚Äù may be strong but they definitely changed the instructions you get to be more clear,and it seems like the AI is slightly better. It‚Äôs definitely made for more than one person to be doing it.
---
Then your game is broken even around like 500 I‚Äôm at like 2-3 a sec
---
I'm not even sure how to best describe my build but I do dabble in a little of everything and don't mind teaming up. Tag: Xavier5249
---
It can be done solo. 
---
You probably either need better armor and/or weapons 
---
Doubt it.
---
1. What system? Several people on PC have tried it, and can't get under 9-10/sec even with 3000 RR. Perhaps PC is bugged?
---
2. Do you have a screenshot of this?
---
&gt;i leveled a camp that was too close to mine and racked up neatly 500 caps in bounty.
---
I'm sure the player whose home you wrecked would say your camping spot was too close to theirs. 
---
I'll change my ways then
---
Any way you know to get the lvl 50 Black Diamond? I did that quest at level 25 and am filled with regret.
---
Hm, 77 is one more than 76...
---
It is fun when you are off doing something and you randomly get some exp "hmm, I must have missed one."
---
Awesome! Thanks for the update! 
---
I can‚Äôt believe people are downvoting this extremely reasonable comment. The anti-PvP faction on this sub are completely insane
---
If you have to ask why then you'll most likely not comprehend the answer to your question. They are in fact selling bethesda's products regardless if it's physical or in this case virtual which they illegally gained through duping. As the old saying goes, "If you can't do the time, then don't do the crime." so they'll be getting their just desserts if they get sued into oblivion.
---
fuck
---
Not me. Game has been surprisingly steady on the ctd/freeze/server down front for me since the last update. Can't even remember of a single one of those.
---
Had found new issues that where not there before with mouse movements, but not with what you said.
---
You will have better luck at r/fo76bazaar 
---
Xbox maybe in a bit my character is currently very weighed down
---
I‚Äôve also done over 100 and no legendaries. 
---
You typically get some combination of a weapon, armor, ammo, a plan and junk (usually some trinket with silver or gold in it like a gold player watch or silver spoon). The weapons can be fairly rare (Gatling laser, plasma, Tesla rifles, etc) but I just scrap everything. You can occasionally get a power armor plan that is decent (I‚Äôve gotten a couple plans to craft various pieces of armor) or somewhat rare workshop plans but most of the time, you basically get a bunch of stuff you don‚Äôt want and just scrap it for materials. 
---
I‚Äôve had this happen, to fix it I press START and pull up the map, when I exit the map the bug is fixed.
---
This is a extremely f76 positive subbreddit I agree. But do you actually prefer the total opposite in the Fallout reddit? I love the game but have written loads about what I think is bad. I think it matters a lot how you critique. I do not even care about downvotes but mindless inults pro or against is just so boring. 
---
Typing you are shit instead of typing I think that if you did this instead you could perform better... what would you prefer.
---
An yes I know there are assholes with both views of the game but I have to say that I rather read about what is bad with the game on F76 where there is (atleast often) a dialogue and not just a toxic flamefest about badwagons, fanboys, haters and their mothers.
---
Peace!
---
Roger, thanks!
---
Same.  I usually re enter world then wait a few.
---
Yeah, went from one event to another event, I die, someone's grabbed my shit before I've even respawned. This game  (and, clearly by reading the other posts on this, this subreddit) is full of toxic sacks of shit.   
---
Things like this are EXACTLY why i want private servers...I want to be able to play this game without "hurdur, if you die, your shit is free game" toxic raider mentality bullshit. 
---
No worries. :) 
---
Hey did you uncap your FPS? I think I fixed it by setting iPresentInterval back to 1 and it doesn‚Äôt cap my FPS, works fine now I think. Haven‚Äôt experienced it since!
---
ITT: apparently very few Dark Souls players
---
I expect that nerf to be painful.
---
Yes, crashing and double loading screens. Gave up this evening 
---
I hate the tea time event, where you protect the teapot, because every single time some ant will sneak up and slowly demolish the structures while I try and look for it in the tall grass.
---
Hardly.  My understanding was when someone outright murdered someone else in the game with no return fire, there would be consequences.  I‚Äôm not seeing any hence the reference to the Wanted Murderer status Todd mentioned.  
---
I really don‚Äôt care about this voting system of Reddit‚Äôs.  I‚Äôm sure those downvoting me are people who instigate such activity, much like those who wreck other people‚Äôs structures.
---
It‚Äôs a genuine question.  Murder is murder and should be dealt with harshly.
---
Everything is a joke when selling.  $400 mod you just bought?  That'll be $6 if you try to sell another one back.  Lame.
---
I leave my extra unused ammo in train stations all the time... Lunch pails, suitcases, trash cans. I always hope someone who needs it will find it. :)
---
You have been excellent at taking words and points and pointing them in a direction you seem fit. I barely even know what a bloodied knife is, haha. Only that I received all sorts of rare items that I guessed were highly desired by anyone playing Fallout 76 and wanted to use this new inventory to become The Wasteland Trader. Something I completely believed Fallout 76 welcomed. You are stating your own words with your own definition of their intent to be defined as facts, not mine. Thank you for your strong opinion.
---
K thank you I dident now whick one
---
Can definitely be soloed. Sure helps if you're the sneaky type.
---
Damn robots can walk right up to me and touch me and still not see me there. Master sneaker. 
---
Its fallout, not baby's 1st videogame.
---
Is it bad that I wanna make a new char now n name em Corbin Dallas?
---
What platform are you playing on?
---
I have a rifle sniper. I don't cripple legs, I don't do headshots. I shoot everything in the dick. Maybe the kills got too easy? I didn't know this was in me.
---
alright cool
---
Sadly, in this day and age, you have to hit them in the wallet to get any changes. Remember how they said at release that the game didn't have FoV slider because none of the previous games had FoV slider? That's very indicative of their mindset. Since people voted yes with their wallets before, without FoV slider, then there's no reason to ever put in the work and improve. It took a major stink on social and gaming media to get them to budge. We had to actively go and convince them that releasing a game locked to 75 degree view, in the ass end of 2018, is not a good thing. 
---
And to be fair, some developers don't need this kind of prodding. Ubisoft, for example, has been doing quite well with Assassin's Creed series, with almost every installment being a fairly significant step forward. The Origins from '17 was a strong but solid improvement. And Odyssey in '18 was yet another improvement on all fronts. Iteration. They find what works, and they improve it. When they run out of obvious room to improve, they add other things, and improve those. Bethesda, on the other hand, has been getting away with releasing broken crap and passing the puck to the modders to spend years fixing it, at no cost to the devs. It's just this time around they wanted a piece of that Fortnite/PUBG pie, and bit off a bit more than they could chew.
---
I've done it solo - what level are you? I believe I was around level 47 when I did it. Make sure to bring plenty of ammo - I definitely went through 200 rounds of my hunting rifle at the time - as well as a good melee weapon, and around 20 stimpacks and 20 radaway. If you can get Hacking level 3, that helps, because others have noted that you use the terminals to hijack the turrets. 
---
Well put. If think the tone in arguments or discussions is for reddit what the scorchbeast is for the lowbies in F76, a total shitstorm.
---
Reddit needs to nerf the flaming and buff the reasoning.
---
How can you tell the clothing that's worth something from the 1-cap duds?
---
My camp is easily spotted, in a high traffic area, where newbies can use all the workbenches; sleep in the bed for the well rested bonus; use one of the many musical instruments for the well tuned bonus; help themselves to purified water; and pick the crops to make adhesive. 
---
My camp has never been targeted for attack by a griefer. It's been damaged by players while I've been away (I've gotten the notice at least twice now), but I suspect they accidentally shot my camp while battling bots or ghouls that spawn nearby. The camp has never taken much damage.
---
In my experience they'll follow basically forever unless you sneak.
---
Probably will get blown up anyway.
---
The final quest is launching a nuke, but the silo mission isn‚Äôt hard, you just need a lot of stimpacks, ammo, and power armor, preferably X-01 or Ultracite.
---
T60 is a real workhorse. Sadly since getting the nuka cola skin i'm using my 51 much more lol
---
I haven't faced accidental neutral enemy aggro, but Electrically Charged, Unstable isotope, Plague walker and Bird Bones are pretty good. With Marsupial, Bird Bones go well, because you won't end up staggering after as many high jumps. Twisted Muscles' -13% gun accuracy is worth it, if you play melee most of the time. I'm not sure but I think Healing Factor also affects Stimpaks. At least Radaway they do. Not only buff chems. Carnivore is great as well, since you'll heal more from eating meat, and in end game a lot of enemies drop meat. Binding Glowing Meat Steak is not bad idea, because you can use that like Stimpak and it's fairly common.
---
Konebred069 just hit level 40 so still a bit to go.
---
I'm not using duped gear. I'm simply 700 hours deep on 1 character. I have almost full sets of everything. I had to buy a cheap license for 76 to make another account for storage mostly. Can't wait to test reduced damage while sprinting gear
---
Or scrap them for unique mods or ingredients.
---
Thanks for responding. I did set mine to 0 a while back. I‚Äôll switch it and see how it goes. Thanks for responding!
---
I guess they might not be so necessary 
---
Is your char similar in name or appearance to to Cosby? Hey hey HEYYY
---
IMO the must have mutations are Marsupial &amp; Healing factor no matter what. For melee Twisted Muscle is great. Scally Skin, Grounded, Bird Bones. Certainly not bad to have but those are like bonus ones for sure.
---
Tldr; healing and twisted (imo) 
---
Happy murder!
---
If you mean perk cards, check out the Perk Loadout Manager at Nexus.

I won't call it modern, but organized civilization has been dated back about 10,000 years in China. Modern civilization as we know it today roughly 600 years, and then Western civilization that includes then Riman and Greek empires started around 500 BC. I remember from high school 20+ years ago that Athens was first inhabited around 4000-5000 BC, but that was well before modern civilization started. I consider the start of a modern civilization that was interrupted was the formation of the Greek City states, specifically Athens around 500 BC when it started with a Democracy, and then Rome with its formation of the Republic. 
---
I'm going with number one because so far I haven't been able to find where the meet is gonna take place no matter how much I explore the marked area. As for the steelheart event? I find that for as long as I follow the bot and don't take detours to scavenge until the end of the event I'm good. The doors will still be unlocked after the event so it's cool
---
how very marathon
---
Exactly! I would want the whole 27 minute movement as well!
---
YES!! Do it that should work! Lol it worked for me seemingly. Best of luck!!
---
Go right ahead, nobody will ever know.
---
If you have Marsupial, you can just jump, aim down and shoot when you're at the highest-ish point in the jump. Works pretty well for me.
---
I've read that its best to prefer melee, as them robots are spongy as all hell. Found this to be absolutely true.
---
Maybe worth it to keep a Troubleshooters legendary weapon of some kind, the extra DMG % certainly won't hurt etc. Maybe some weapons that cause energy damage in general versus ballistic. Plasma nades etc. 
---
There are a few mags/bobbles that would help but given they seem to spawn randomly (never have found the same one in the same spot) but I've held onto a few in my Stash for next Silo run. 
---
I was also relieved to find out dying in the silo didn't mean a forced restart of the whole damned thing. 
---
Hm. Now I'm torn between the name for my new char... Corbin dallas.or buffalo bill...
---
 Prob try buffalo bill since you can wear whatever you want. Find some sort of sexy dress n just mutilate ghouls. Lmao
---
Yeah. If I got a one cent every disconnect, that would have paid for my game already.
---
I've completed this one since the patch on PS4, so it is still active. I got it and didn't attempt it in the past, so to re-try it, I did have to access the computer for it to pop up again on my list. 
---
Perception increases vats acuracy by about .6% per point, so I would stick with a weightless chest piece.
---
I like the idea of a fast travel refund... Maybe increased cap reward for finishing... 
---
My honestly favorite strategy is bum rushing someone and throwing a mine at both our feet. I die too, but killing yourself has almost no consequences. If I'm using Sentinel legendary gear I can't even tank nuke mines. 
---
I'm actively gathering stealth boys. Explosive vats head shots aren't a thing if you can't use vats. 
---
Lets link up this weekend.  I am stuck in Vegas visiting a trade show for work. 
---
I thought you meant the old Copland movie with fat Sylvester Stallone
---
He one thing i want is for bethesda to not listen to the outspoken pve community. 
---
I just disconnected from server as soon as I was about to pick my loot from where I died
---
For real. What a strange hill to choose to die on.
---
This would be amazing. As someone who enjoys killing a greifer or destroying a greifers base in some exaggerated way this would make me a very happy vault dweller. 
---
I chased down 3 lower level players today to give them plans. The first just ran away and ignored me. The second was standing still and obviously AFK. The third was in a house. When I entered the house I fell through the terrain into glitchville and the game crashed out. Maybe I'll just throw them in a box somewhere. 
---
Xbox One, after the new update none of my friends or I can move, we can only look around, we can't open the pip boy, nothing. Server hopping sometimes fixes it, but that does not last long. RIP this game 
---
So you played Black ops 2 and liked menendez, so you adopted his M.O?
---
Well if thats it he should quit. Meybe come back later. Im lvl 250 and i have never had 25 k caps but never ran out either. I do not spend time farming caps unless i need it but thats just me. And as you,can viess i do not have all the plans etc yet. I mainly play events, nukes or random stuff with others. Bored sometimes but then i log outnand usually when i return I have something fun to do again. I enjoy playing with others and making friends online. Would probably not play the game without a mic for example. But hey, thats just me.
---
I hope he comes back üòä
---
So Class Freak 3 will affect Twisted Muscles? I was under the impression it was a 50% gun accuracy hit regardless but if it‚Äôs only 13% I can deal with that. Hmm that‚Äôs interesting that Healing Factor affects stimpaks, makes sense but may not be worth it. Would Class freak 3 would also affect the chem effectiveness debuff as well? If it‚Äôs only a ~15% debuff it wouldn‚Äôt be that bad. 
---
Yes, until about Midnight MST. Then I'm fine.
---
Well, at least I know I'm not the only one who misses being able plant items
---
you could maintain with buffing the damn drop rates
---
Update: I just lost all my junk now 
---
I've been disconnecting pretty reliably since I started the game, even tried VPN and no dice. I'm finding it's much worse since last server maintenance.
---
No disconnects in other online games though.
---
Spot fucking on. 
---
oo I'm going to drag my hubby over there tonight! \^\_\^
---
What in the flying fuck is up with people taking simple questions as troll attempts.
---
OP, the answer is no. There is just one state, Wanted.
---
Yep. Every few minutes. 
---
Violet flux can be gotten from nuked mutated ferns, you find loads of those in watoga whenever someone nukes fissure site prime, so whenever you need those just check if your server has fissure side prime nuked then harvest them from under the three branches. It's really easy to get loads of if, especially if you have been thumb equipped
---
It went exactly as I said. It's called realism, look it up.
---
Absolutely. Sounds like a plan. 
---
There's plenty of people nuking random spots. Stop promoting this cheater. 
---
Fluorescent pink with glitter flames and a rainbow across the chest.
---
Make the chest lights into little spotlights that wave around.
---
Make it so it leaves a trail of sparkles whenever you sprint.
---
My Crystal Ball has the day off for MLK. Sorry.
---
I think it would be a good fit for this game.   It would be a way to save it.
---
Crashout 76.
---
But why don‚Äôt you have a mic at this point? It‚Äôs a multiplayer game. Get one. How else are we going to save the wasteland together?
---
I dont use rad x
---
&gt;Legendary gear is never higer then level of mob it dropped from, **same as normal gear** and as mole miners are level 40...
---
If it's the same as normal gear, it definitely can be above the level of the mob. I go in with nothing, and pick up literally everything in there, then scrap it all at the bench leaving the event area. Shotguns, assault rifles and miner gauntlets for days, and*every single one* of them is 45-50. I'm almost positive that I've walked out of there with a 50 anti armor grognak's axe, but I can't be 100%, as I don't have it anymore. So maaaaybe legendaries are level capped to the creatures level, but I know 100% for a fact that normal loot isn't, and just like you said, I assumed it would work the same as normal, so...
---
Guess I'll have to run the event some more. For science.
---
quartz
---
I think the proposed rule is no good as it will make people NOT want low levels in the group.
---
Shotgun build really makes me embrace my inner sadist.
---
I'll explore the area again. Thanks. 
---
What do you down voters do ingame, the same events over and over?   Hours server hopping looking for mods for reasons?
---
Doubt it was only 20 I destroyed a couple bases yesterday each time 500+ cap bounty
---
They could do some *sick* raider armors.
---
&gt;Your own words
---
None of the facts above are my own words, bub. They are yours. But there's that  denial of yours again... It is mind-bogging at this point to be so ignorant to claim those facts  are my words, not yours. You said yourself you received an abundance of items for free, even giving a number here https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aie83v/z/een2etj
---
You also said yourself that your proceeded to trade said items and consequently got banned for it while believing you are not at fault throughout your comments and the original post. 
---
Everything I listed in my above comment is a fact established by you, not something I came up with.
---
üòÇ
---
[My first time in a blast zone was also my first time finding Grahm. I happened to get a pic of both, but it wasn't very good as Grahm kept moving.](https://imgur.com/wfSkbA3)
---
This nuke was set off in Charleston btw.
---
True I have some friends that have been ban for duping and yet I can confirm they have not done the glitch, just because they have dupe items like tse handmade and other stuff the sad part is that bethesda support is: a. Ignoring them  or  b. Not doing their job cause 5 days to find a agent to help them is just absurd and they still waiting.
---
Can count about 14 friends that have been ban and i dont have that many people that play fallout 76
---
in the morning now she calls me
---
how much ?
---
Xbox One 
---
So far I've yet to crash for and hour or so once I stopped using my Targeting Excavator helmet.
---
Word!
---
I don't get how the reference relates to the situation OP said
---
The first blast zone I experienced was joining a lobby and immediately taking rads before I could even move. Within 2-3 seconds I was dead.
---
Level 250 and i do not see the need unless you are really into farming caps or spending hard on vendors or trade. Later it is easy to get max daily caps from vendors if you like but for me it feels like work.... hehe
---
Sounds like my experience on Xbox but I‚Äôve only logged 120 hours since Dec 31st
---
I already did, above. It follows the base chemistry of the majority of fallout games. It's hard to explain to someone that doesn't open their eyes and see.
---
I'm with you there.
---
On ps4 you can check error history (crashes) and at 244 hours I've had 21 total, 11 of which happened through November.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and the only major issues I have are the occasional game crash and dropped items instantly disappearing. Other issues are minor and I know they‚Äôll most likely be fixed at some point. I love this game.
---
This was so frustrating the other day. I was trying to join Scorched Earth and couldn't because of this. I restarted the game and even tried a different server and it didn't work. The only temporary fix I found was to open a container and view my inventory then it would be fixed until I logged out again. 
---
Luckily I waited a few hours, tried again and it was fixed. 
---
I used to be a ghoul like you until I took a shotgun to the knee. 
---
If I'm not wrong nuke dark takes the alcohol 'slot'but is affected by the cola perk too
---
Hahahaha
---
I hope this comment gets more visibility, you bring up a very important point. 
---
If higher level players especially 100+ are flagging you down it may be that they want to give you Legendary weapons. I hate selling great level 30 gear to the vendors. I would‚Äôve loved that at low levels. 
---
You should try a camp raid with friends!!
---
The reason those things don't happen to you is because you're not a "game journalist".
---
Try completing back on the beat during a nuke zone. Green dudes 1 shot him. Furthest I got was the last bank and he got wacked. 
---
Census Violence and The Messenger. Fuck these right off. The ones you listed are mostly bugged, these 2 just suck. 
---
...  
---
yeah, you're having some fucking alternative universe shit. I've had multiple douchebags try to murder me today and three disconnects...then I quit playing completely after sitting over a scorch beast queen for twenty fucking minutes hoping to get my fucking loot.   
---
This game is fun when it works, but there isn't a day that goes by that it isn't, in some form or other, unplayable fucking garbage.   
---
I guess collecting a bunch then wanting to vendor them and realizing some sell for a lot. 
---
Civil war suit (craftable)
---
Space suit 
---
Straight Jacket
---
These 3 come to mind for selling a good amount.
---
I personally use gold amd cloth to make the civil war suits and sell them for, from memory, 41 caps per. It ever i come across the other 2 i keep them until i see a vendor.
---
&gt; Hey hey HEYYY
---
Lol no. But wait, isn‚Äôt this a reference to something else? I don‚Äôt remember Cosby saying that. 
---
Excellent efforts, 
---
"we will watch your career with great interest"
---
Also, Wanamingo Queen... 
---
"She will also drop 4 3* armor."
---
Bethesda will reduce that to, "she will drop 2 low level wood armor"
---
What happened to your head?
---
Planetside 2 on ps4 was both bumpers...at the same time.  Took me forever to figure out that one on my own
---
Is there not a local file you can edit to remap the keys?
---
Well, if you would play devils advocate and read your own text, you still do not see any issues with it or reason in my first reply? I mean really? 
---
I can not see your post anymore, just the comments btw.
---
Chants remember the exact specs but believe it was instead of +100% for the explosive damage nerfing it down to 25% . Believe it's the same or close to for the two shot
---
If you kill the scorchbeast before it lands this quest bugs out. Or sometimes it's already dead yet the event stays up. 
---
How do you join raiders?
---
**Bethesda** *Buffs drop rate on Plan: Ultracite Explosive Vent*
---
Often times a long post will be summarized at the bottom for everyone‚Äôs convenience. The summary is customarily indicated by beginning with ‚ÄúTL;DR. 
---
Quicker then hitting a nuke zone for the flux
---
I would pay for the ability to use the rear end of my power armor as a flamethrower.
---
The perfect and proper use of "literally" could be applied here. Literally no one will ever know. 
---
It would some how end up being a buggy mess
---
Plus it's funny as hell to watch all the scavengers trying to squeeze their way into the container after a SBQ fight =P.
---
Can't say I haven't done the same thing when I first started lol.
---
What I don‚Äôt get is in inventory view the value is one thing, but if you go to vendor it it‚Äôs considerably less. Is the inventory view the hypothetical price if you have the vendor perks? And if so, why show that price?
---
I honestly would be shocked if this game isn't shuffled into the can within the next year. Bethesda has, consistently, nerfed content without providing any real additional reasons to stick around, they've committed multiple criminal acts surrounding this game, which is..going to have some interesting results for the company as a whole as time goes on.   
---
I'd LOVE it if they turned this sinking ship around, made it more enjoyable instead of, every update, less. I don't see that change coming. 
---
I'm sure
---
is your weapon drawn?
---
Huh, interesting, thanks :)
---
Chems are where I make my money... I've never tried to sell the guns... you could probably get a lot doing uranium fever... I just do that to scrap all the junk for crafting/repair materials.
---
Aw man...that stinks :(
---
Sry to hear. The game ate ur gun. Thats probably one of the worst bugs in the game
---
had this on queen last night :(  lasted for a really long time.   fubar man.
---
OP is probably just generalizing and will likely set up in Charleston, a possibly risky move as the city is tiny.
---
I've actually heard it's better solo...I've only done it in a small team, but its not that bad...provided you're leveled for it, have plenty of ammo, decent armor, and decent stock of stimpacks.   
---
If you're a level 35 who's rushing through the game...no, you're fucked. If you're level 50+ with decent gear? You'll be fine. 
---
&gt;I have accepted my ban.
---
No, you haven't. If you had, you'd learn the lesson and not post this nonsense or try appealing it with Bethesda. What you're doing is the absolute opposite of accepting it.
---
It is but if the are gonna need it, stick with the explosives not the 2 shot. OR idk how hard it would be to code but only nerf weapons that have both, TSE
---
I've lost too many things to disappearing bags, when giving other people stuff or trading with team members it seems it's a risk when dropping anything. One of the most infuriating bugs in this game.
---
and frozen at 52 MB
---
YES. I did this exact thing in New Vegas. It was funniest to do to those Raiders whose leader wore an angler helm. They all were in a small house so you could really get a good gallery of horrors going.
---
I‚Äôd really like it. There isn‚Äôt enough support for a trapper style of gameplay, right now.
---
Again, depends on what your intent is. Do you want the same 5% negative in the next game? And the next? And the next? If yes, continue doing what you're doing. If no, then change is needed. Elementary.
---
Having said that, this really isn't needed with many developers. They will improve the game, gradually, on their own. Other developers do require prodding. 
---
Bottom line, it's all up to you. It's all very personal. Some people believe that if they spend hundreds of dollars extra on cosmetics, for example, that this money goes straight into game development, and they get better content. I passionately disagree with that as well, all it does is shift focus from less profitable development of the game proper, to pushing cosmetics which are far more profitable given how long it takes to make them. All this purchasing behaviour did is make sure we now have an in-game cash store in most games, even many single player ones. So, thanks for that, guys. 
---
PvP servers will maintain a steady population. But first 90% of the population must go. I'm talking about you singleplayer fanboys who thought this game is for you just because you are in greather numbers. You finished your "main story", what are you still doing here.
---
Does nobody else change their control presets on the menu? 
---
I feel this pain
---
Yesterday my wife went to drop me 300+ shotgun shells just as I'm near 0 myself, but as she rifles through her inventory I notice she's standing with one foot on the base of a tree. I've been here before, I know what's going to happen. But before I can stop her, she drops the bag of ammo...straight into the abyss. Tree goes nom nom, no ammo for me.
---
I found this also. What I done to workaround was got a workbench, scrap all junk then place it in my stash. Having all the materials together seems to let the game know you have the required materials. 
---
I don't know what you expect. If you're actually taking the time read only the new posts that are made then you get what you get, people are allowed to post whatever they feel like within reason, and if many people want to make suggestions then it's not really your place to argue with that. It's just part of the sub and part of being in a community of people.
---
However, I tend to read hot posts and looking right now I can see that out of the top 30 posts, only like 3-4 are suggestions.... so yea... either way you're either wrong or SOL.
---
Comparing online gaming to sports is quite the stretch
---
And some honey there as well ;) 
---
It has to be crazy expensive just to maintain the game on a day to day basis. My most optimistic conspiracy theory hope is it was all to get zenimax to fund a new game engine. One can hope right?
---
it's one buttong for both actions anyway, even if you change it.
---
But I won't give out my camp location :)
---
Sorry I didn't think about platform. Im on xbox and have sentinel with -8% from other players
---
PFF
---
I've had the occasional server disconnect. Had a couple of bluescreens around a month ago. Never been griefed or harassed. 
---
It's a pretty popular area
---
Ummm...
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
I think the get ones don't respawn in a server connect. I took the power plants the other day. Not to hard to grab 9 fusion cores each session. Currently have 40. I check every generator and power armor set I come across 
---
Having to build a fusion generator every time sucks but it is what it is. Beats crafting fusion cores 
---
I‚Äôm not a game journalist and all of that and more (especially recently) has happened to me several times.
---
I'm willing to play that long....
---
I can‚Äôt tell if the first part of this post is satire or not
---
My potato! 
---
Thank you!  I don‚Äôt understand how what I asked was considered trolling.  Perhaps these individuals are feeling defensive with some degree of guilt for one reason or another?  
---
Full disclosure: I‚Äôve been wanted two or three times.  Once for defending another player‚Äôs camp from ghouls and accidentally shot up a wall in the background.  My reward?  Their team murdered me and taunted me after that.  My second was for lockpicking a door (didn‚Äôt realize that made you wanted).  And my third time was for collecting a bounty at what I thought was the player‚Äôs camp (turned out to be another player‚Äôs camp - more background damage).
---
Regardless, there are essentially zero consequences for murder and I think that‚Äôs just sad.  Even Nuka World gave you the option to wipe out all the raiders if you weren‚Äôt down with their lifestyle/objectives.
---
There should be an option to allow for the rest of the server to join together and squash this type of behavior into the ground.  We are supposed to be rebuilding America, aren‚Äôt we?  Seems we are tearing it further apart...
---
I think I might pop down to an eb and see if this is even true. 
---
Nice try, Bethesda.
---
Yep, I was getting major, major No Man's Sky vibes running around in The Mire at night.
---
I swear I've had them track me while sneaking in the caution stance. It's that loose kind of tracking where you can tell they aren't supposed to know where you are but deep down their AI totally knows.
---
I can let you know when I have 3k 
---
I mashed my mouse onto my enter key, left, came back 15 minutes later and chrome had crashed with 40,000 runs and still no TSE handmades.  Pretty much sums up my looting experience.
---
Thank you that totally fixed it. Somehow a huge section of fencing got blueprinted and placed in the stored area. 
---
Same, the only thing I care about is that it has ruined the game economy. I dont pvp so it doesn't effect me or my fun that I bought the game for so whatever. I knew I'd get down voted for saying "who cares" but I've got more important things in life to worry about
---
Damn... To be frank, consider doing non-risky things or play different game until they fix these issues.

No "criminal acts" have been committed or at least none that will yield any ramifications for the company beyond annoyed people. Many "gamers" in the past have thrown the phrase "class action lawsuit" around like chips hurling faeces without any knowledge of why they are doing so beyond simple annoyance.
---
Yes the game has had a rocky start, yes it could have been better, yes they should have maybe spent another year working on it but nothing they have done comes close to  a "criminal act" not close. And if your talking about the stuff with the West Tek bag, they have resolved that, an incident that should not have occurred but it is resolved non-the-less.
---
Bethesda is a huge company and FO76 is but a small pebble in a large pond, the success or fall of this game will have no bearing on the company save for the department that made the game which will be axed.
---
Same here, thank you for sharing. 
---
I thought about this.. cause I feel like it generates pretty quick? Is that 3 every 5 minutes or 1. Still not bad 
---
The witch halloween custome as well, also craftable btw
---
Image was in 1440p but got compressed by imgur I guess so it's hard to see details.  That's a sack hood.
---
Actually this show how harmfull and unfriendly is the game.
---
My most fervent hope is that before they knock the servers off line for good, they fucking _finally_ release the server code with minor tweeks so people who want to continue playing/modding the game can do so. 
---
There is absolutely no way they're making money off this, and given the absolutely laughable state of the atom shop, micro transactions aren't making them much...even if people WANTED to dump the insultingly high per-item cost on it...they'd need an ASSLOAD of sales to make enough to pay for server costs, let alone any further development. 
---
Add to that, any servers hosted by the company are the responsibility of the company, and the actions of the accounts on their servers are thus in need of moderation that, frankly, they're doing a piss poor at best job at tackling now. Mods cost money too. 
---
It looks like a meat wad.
---
Well.... They wont because Bethseda isn't sueing anybody. No need to personally insult me as that devalues your argument. People sell raid carries and acvount recoveries on all MMOs and are legally fine. "If you can't do the time than dont do the crime" Well thats silly becuase the just punishment for exploiting a gane isnt having your oife destroyed. Its obviouse to me that you arent an adult or if you are then you dont have bills or a family to care for otherwise you would see how ludicrous you sound.
---
Better than throwing it in the ground. That‚Äôs what I do with all .45 and .38 once it starts taking up too much weight in my stash.
---
I've got 2 x01 chests- jetpack and stealth boy. Weight is too much to play with much more than that for me.
---
This is why I don't have a real base all of my stuff is sitting right on the ground next to a river for better water.  Nothing fancy since no one else will ever really see it.  Now when private servers become a thing my base is gonna be rockin.
---
Same boat more or less. Never been griefed, I've had some CTD/Disconnects but at much reduced rate versus what I read about, some graphical glitches that really don't mean much in the scheme of things (light rays through mountains, floating rocks, etc). 
---
I do have one quest bugged I can't finish (Cold Case iirc) and that's a bit of a nuisance but I'm guessing they'll correct it eventually. 
---
I have started running into the wall of "what the hell do I do now?" After I've cleared the vendors of caps and ran a few worthy spots it does get a bit trying. Turn it off and come back after a little while, renewed interest. 
---
Actually that's a point how on earth do you find the fuel or acid to craft it?
---
Yeah, cause it suppresses mutations. Time yourself now, then pop a rad-x, then time it again. 
---
If you don't like it, go play your other MMOs and stop trying to change my Fallout into your game.
---
I‚Äôd just be strung out on chems chilling with Mama Murphy. 
---
Probably just had a flare gun anyway :/
---
Broken? How do you think they lived long enough to become legendary?
---
Healing factor does affect stimpacks, but with rank 3 class freak it works out just fine. 
---
I believe I have a medic shotgun and a medic gatling gun. I'll have to double check after work, but ill message you and let you know.
---
Could that be why? I have 9 points in it and I hardly have to repair it.
---
What platform are you on? If you‚Äôre on the PS4. I have one I can give you (for free). I rather it to go someone than just take up space in my stash. I should have some ammo for it too. Although I‚Äôll have to double check this.
---
that cause a panic some people would thing it‚Äôs bomb
---
I think this event is hands down the best in terms of awards (non including the guaranteed 3 legendary items from Uranium Fever), if your high level it constantly spawns level 62 crowned ghouls that drop tons of good loot, most notably treasure maps, I did one that dropped at least ten of them. This event also gave dropped one of my best weapons (Lvl 25 AA explosive handmade) so maybe I‚Äôm a little biased.
---
I found a lvl45 version at a vendor, just keep looking and you may get lucky!
---
First they slash the price in half.. now this.
---
That is exactly what I thought. Felt a bit dumb when I continued to read the post.
---
That's not so bad. The other night I loaded up where my camp should have been. After standing there for a minute, my camp appears, and I'm stuck underneath it. I had to go into build mode and take out a wall to get out.
---
Same no issues really . 
---
Take it
---
It exista and is very rare
---
Im on xbox
---
Only if you want candy
---
Interesting.
---
I like to build up low levels camps. Adds some fun when you're level 100+. Usually build up new peoples camps I've just met or share plans I have with new people I've gamed with a few times. I have a ps4. If a random level 100+ invites you to their team it might just be worth it. :)
---
You can sort by weight. Not sure if that would be helpful.
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs one of the only places I‚Äôll use mines becuase they funnel so predictably from two places.
---
I really wish we could do a full retcon, it's annoying to have to wait until 50, and even more so to  only have move one point OR choose one perk.
---
Boston=capital wasteland
---
3rd bullshit rumor post today and 2nd time they link to a site claims amazon only has 28 copies left which isnt true.
---
So that is why I lost all my cores so fast.
---
They don‚Äôt stack, you‚Äôre better off having one piece for weapons, one piece for food, drink, chems, and so on
---
luckiest man alive
---
nope sorry, u wrong capital wasteland is DC 
---
Thanks! I wasnt sure that one would be for sale.
---
Gawd dam untermensch i tells ya
---
Ok thanks 
---
So you're RPing Dorty Harry, yes?!
---
Wasteland has some really strict building codes...
---
Only 54% of player have reached level 10
---
No, this is part of the problem people in my shoes are going through. You have been very sly and cunning with your word play, I have yet to fall for it but others do and that's a terrible problem. I had no intent to take away from developers or the community, and on top of already feeling ashamed by a situation I knew very little of, I read these spiteful remarks aimed to make people feel even worse. I get it. Don't cheat. Oh, you cheated? You get punished. This is the extent of it all in the simplest of terms. I didn't cheat. I didn't go out of my way once to do anything the terms of conditions or rules of conduct frowned upon. I was a low, level noob with big dreams; not having any clue what Fallout 76 offered. I thought I had found a calling on Fallout 76, being someone legitimate players could come to for excellent deals on all essentials and amazing weapons. I literally thought how cool that would be if that were to be in the game when I was fresh out of the vault. Here I was having so much fun giving back to people that loved what I was doing and then got banned when, if, I had received any other strict warning I would have halted and discarded without hesitation. If anyone can tell from my post and all my responses it is that I am humble, and logical. I rarely resort to any definition of violence and if you really knew me, perhaps kind hearted. This whole situation on Fallout 76 has now left me feeling the opposite. I put blame on myself, which I've stated throughout, but it's difficult for me knowing my path that blame shouldn't fall on someone else. Thank you for your feedback.
---
Better inventory mod
---
I haven't got stuck in my camp myself but when people fast travel to me sometimes they spawn in the foundations of my house and i have to remove the floor to release them.
---
I know right?
---
This sounds like a hilarious bug tbh. 
---
Wow that's an amazing generous offer. I'm on PC however. But thanks.
---
Im trying to play thegame right now but instead im on reddit because the loading takes forever since the latest patch. I like the fallout series and play this game a fair amount but it has a ton of problems. Im stuck in another loading screen right now. Feel lucky if you don't experience issue's in this game. Im giving up and turning off the ps4, again lol, because this is the third time in 2 hours it has gotten stuck in a loading screen. Like the game but there's no question it needs some work
---
So much passion! 
---
Nice.
---
If anyone has even just two pieces of 20% weapon reduction armor we can tell what math they use.  Can someone confirm with just two pieces what the original weight, weight with one, and weight with two is?
---
For instance if it's 10, with one piece it'll be 8.  With two it will either be 6 (meaning you can get to zero) or 6.4 (meaning it's 20% off at each stage after doing the math for the last reduction).
---
Subscriber too. Both are awesome games.
---
what platform are you on? i‚Äôm on pc and i have a medic‚Äôs harpoon gun with +50% vats critical damage, someone had thrown it away so i picked it up a long time ago and tried to sell it but no one wanted it so i kept it anyway since it‚Äôs a pretty nice vats combo. would be happy to get rid of it tho since i dont use vats
---
Take that you little big fuckers
---
Sadly, I am on PC. Is there no way to trade between systems?
---
I have done it solo . Died a few times and had ammo issues but now I know what to expect .
---
Singleplayers don't just do the main story. We actually play the whole thing and enjoy the bells and whistles and get our money's worth.
---
This mod is a lifechanger...it's not a "switch between loadouts as you switch between guns" cheat, either...you still have to go in and change in the same menu...but it makes it a LOT easier to put in fast travel/crafting loadouts and then revert to a combat loadout when you're in a safe spot. 
---
You might have had an influx due to the daily challenge today being "join a team" and a lot of other challenges requireing you be be in a team to complete them
---
if that fails try having all the materials you need in your inventory, not your stash. I ran into the same issue making ammo, stash had my 20 bulk lead and couldn't craft anything at the tinkers bench.
---
It's pretty fucking cool that the ghouls you kneecap don't just despawn when you wander off and other people can find them and kill them.
---
The only medic I've held onto is a medic gatling gun with explosive rounds. Starting to get bored with it, something about the sound that gun makes with the rounds being explosive is very satisfying. But I'm tired of killing myself. I'm on PC.
---
Hey at least we weren't alone! Cheers!
---
I have a piece that ‚Äúreduces weigh of chems ‚Äú but doesn‚Äôt matter what I do the ‚Äú20% weigh reduction ‚Äú is fugazi it never kicks in
---
16 times the detail ...
---
[seems familiar somehow...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Boston_Mooninite_panic)
---
Turn away from whatever you were attempting to target or look at the ground. That‚Äôs how I get it to go away, it‚Äôs super annoying.
---
Alright. We can trade possibly at like 9. If not, then at about tomorrow from 9:30 to 3. That‚Äôs when I‚Äôll be on. 
---
what happened to the other people on the channel.  
---
284 rolls till i got a 2-shot-explosive, it was a .50 cal 2 star only dropped from a legendary deathclaw
---
There is that, the price of balancing i guess. A solution would be opt in no lvl cap servers. 
---
Honestly tho, from my own experience playing with friends ranging from new lvl 5 to lvl 50+, you miss a lot of stuff while questing with your big lvl teammates. That's why I love soloing as much as I love teaming up. I get as many plans, if not more, soloing cause no one else is snatching them up.
---
It appears it was just broken for me.
---
No, that would require increasing its range.... 
---
There are external keyboards for consoles and controllers with mini-keyboards, and worst-case you can always thumb-stick a msg out.
---
5000 rolls later, I got one TSE Handmade 2*:

I'm on XB1 and about 40 levels back I had a high level player visit me in my camp. They hung out a few minutes then gave me a team invite. I accepted and while I used my crafting benches the other player built a beautiful piano (and placed it in the perfect spot) and a television (again, placed in the perfect spot). 
---
I was beyond thrilled. It has been the experience that has, to this day, given me the greatest joy in this game. Thank you for helping lowbies and their camps on PS4. I'm sure you are making them very happy.
---
cukoo clock is from the charleston vonder that spawns randomly.
---
elegant couches sounds like something from whitesprings.
---
Marsupial and healing are the best ones. Bird bones are great for players who don't game in power suits. Only one I dont like is egg head as it affects other things negatively. 
---
I would hope it would work like the first example and I wanted to try to acquire some weight reduction armors but they are quite pricey. But a guy just said they don‚Äôt stack so I wouldn‚Äôt want to do it and find out it‚Äôs not worth it
---
I'm hoping that Bethesda will add a quest marker to the bags soon
---
For the most part, sort of. I believe it is zone based- list for the forest, ash heap, savage divide, bog, mire, toxic valley. Separate one for power plant-&gt; generator plans.
---
Don‚Äôt quote me on that though, I can‚Äôt provide sources, it‚Äôs just my belief 
---
Even better, re-launch the pip-boy companion app for mobile devices and include chat functionality. Basically in-game texting.
---
Do you already have traveling pharmacy perk on?
---
Games aren't designed for external 3rd party components. Nothing ever is.
---
I found a legendary crossbow once. Wasn‚Äôt too great.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure *most* guns have legendary variations. There are some exceptions like the pipe revolver (and until recently the hunting rifle), but they‚Äôre rare.
---
The way they could keep the game up or be more cost efficient is to create contend that they could also use for Fallout 5.
---
Tf even is that I have like 5
---
I mean I would be up for that however most would hit a camp and logout...done...no chance of revenge and very little risk.  So there needs to be a counter to that.  As of now you could raid the stash steal everything and then log out and 10 min later be safe from all reprisals
---
Same here, on Xbox One S if it matters at all.

# Plan: Electrified Mr. Handy Buzz Blade
---
Last time I died there was a yellow diamond over my bag.
---
A single patch every two weeks is making this inevitable. 
---
Plan: Electrified Mr. Handy Buzz Blade
---
Same here, ps4. Just the occasional crashes, nothing major. No griefers at all so far. Friendly and quiet atmosphere every server. Loving every minute, as I have with every other Fallout since the first.
---
That sounds about right I've probably got about a thousand pieces of Loot and out of that maybe half a dozen two shots
---
I want this!!
---
But after your done you still have to do a nuke run 
---
Wow that‚Äôs not worth it at all.
---
Unless you're one of my friends or in my party then no. You don't get loot. Go away.
---
I kinda think posting the same thing multiple times detracts from the overall point &amp; divides up this discussion. Just saying. 
---
You have to turn quest markers on in the quest menu once you've died. Always been there 
---
Yeah, bit skeptical about 94.  If that really is a GECK in there, I don‚Äôt think we should let it out.
---
Just think if the dupers didn't do two shot explosive so everyone has them they would be the awesome killer weapon that everybody wants and is one in a million
---
I had the skull and cross-bones marker on my compass. I spent minutes dancing over the spot! The only reason I kept returning to those gd mirelucks was to get that bag!  NO BAG! 
---
I always put my already known plans in the trashcans of stations, when I was in my lower levels I found a bunch I did't know so it was a big help, I've been doing the same ever since.
---
im kidding, its just a random legendary, not worth it either. Go for the 2k
---
Really?! I died today and couldn't find my stuff
---
No, you misunderstand. I accept the reasoning behind the ban. I get why they took such action. However, to lock out such a huge population without warning or understanding takes many away that had no clue nor understood themselves what the hell Fallout 76's true problems were. To say every single person is a bad exploiter and duplicator is just a down right lie, and everyone that supports it needs to attempt to see it through all sorts of perspectives before being so harsh. We have a voice, everything is not what you thunk it is. Isn't that the point of Fallout online, unique paths built on fun, creative play styles. I swear, I've met kinder players in every community I've played in than Fallout 76.
---
I decided to repost it at a time that more people were online. Should I take this down?
---
There's a thread in this sub where someone basically collected all the Grahm sightings and figured out most of his travel route. The hard part is still figuring out exactly where he's at, but if you are determined it narrows it down a lot.
---
I'm not online right now, but I think it is. 
---
Taking stuff removes the retrieve your loot marker
---
It's a video game. Don't let *anybody* force you into doing something that reduces your enjoyment. 
---
Clear your cache. It helps a bit.
---
I‚Äôm good don‚Äôt need it anymore 
---
Done it past 5000 a few times, once got a two shot laser rifle, next was just armour, third time was also fairly pants... 
---
Will do, thank for the help. 
---
5 minutes is no big deal but if you as advertise something and I tell you I'll come buy it then you make me wait an hour, I'll probably drop it and buy from someone else.
---
It takes 2 minutes to travel to your camp, trade, and travel back. 
---
If you stopped playing that long ago with that mindset, why are you still here in the sub? Just honestly curious
---
Are you playing with a knee-capper effect I haven‚Äôt found yet? 
---
What platform are you? If you‚Äôre on XB, I have a spare calibrated shock for Excavator that I‚Äôm looking to give away. 
---
Bethesda really wants this game to be heavy on the pvp.  Sadly I feel many of the long term players dont feel that way..  CAMP destruction is sadly a tool that let's players feel awsome about themselves by destroying somebody else's hard work.  I know you can move camp for rebuild, works for small basic little tiny camps but not so for a real permanent camp. 
---
Best thing is dont waste money on the atom store camp upgrades and build the basic wooden shack and store all of your crafting benches.  
---
PVP is soo bad i nbn this game the engine just cannot support a smooth seamless pvp experience.  The current game structure doesnt work either.  
---
New games are releasing so I'm going to let the pvp types have their fun.  Least till the return to their little camp in the corner on their favorite cod map.
---
Geez don‚Äôt tell me that , this is one of those unstackables?
---
Makes no sense since I have perk to reduce weigh of certain weapons I have a piece that has 20% reduction weight on weapons , I‚Äôm almost positive this one does stack the perk cards 
---
This is a fucking brilliant idea
---
Do u have the starched genes perk on? It's in luck
---
All item weight reduction stats cap at 90%, but yes you can get your weapons down to 1 or 2 pounds with enough weapon weight reduction items. 
---
I am honestly not sure AT ALL I am asking because I would like to get a good understand of their mechanics 
---
I mean, I'm married so it would be off. But I've got adventurous (female) friends, like I was when I was single. You're right about the spam, but don't necessarily assume.
---
II have lost track of everyone's post. I knew this would energize people but I had no clue I'd be attempting to defend my situation, not myself, to this extent. I have no problem playing devil's advocate! Makes sense to me, don't cheat! I never cheated nor knew I was cheating till I heard it from others, and by then I had such a strong amount of  legit players that were supporters
---
Also, you said that you can't see my post anymore. I don't really know what that means, haha. I haven't changed any settings, I don't really know how to. This is my first post of ever on Reddit and I rarely use it to begin with, just mainly to read things that interest me from time to time.
---
Thanks, I hope I can play again too, and you're fine, everyone is entitled to their opinion, but why so much hate on anyone and everyone that was even remotely affiliated.
---
It's random and not guaranteed, seyrums is best way....
---
No, I thought it kept me from losing it not helped me get it? Or am I wrong?
---
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
---
Yeah the big wigs rushed this one I don't blame you it isn't a good game it's plagued with issues and for them to have a game like this that I paid 60 dollars for is so sad. Don't get me wrong I play it but it's a bad game but it's fun. I don't think I'm buying another Bethesda product after this shit show
---
Maybe they *are* a scum trash useless sack of stupidmeat that should set themselves on fire and jump off a bridge into more fire.
---
Can‚Äôt assume everyone is a decent human being, especially on the Internet where any number of the entities present might be a self-aware AI being that coalesced in the vast web
---
I don't personally see the point...but I run a shotgun build, so all my plastic, and my steel, goes to shells. I don't really have an issue grinding up random crap, mostly chems and grenades to sell on most days...   
---
Personally, I just dump shit I don't need. I drop a lot of common mats, wood, cloth, acid, etc, down to 100 frequently. Anything that gets over 200 gets culled and dropped. It's just not worth messing with, to my mind.   
---
The only scrap I have a hard time keeping enough of is lead. Everything else...if i Need steel, you can get hundreds in a few minutes hunting lower level zones and scrapping guns. 
---
I have my camp currently set up just outside charleston fire station.
---
Normally harvest all the lead there, make a load of ammo and head on my way for some exploring. Come back to camp when I'm done and drop any plans any times I don't want into the cache and do it over again.
---
Clear cache. It helps.
---
I think you're confused. Power armor is really only useful in nuke zones? Other than that, it's more common for high level people to be in full suits of legendary armor rather than power armor
---
Simple solution, schedule an appointment slot for the trade that both of you agree on. If you run late, it's on you and you know it. Making someone wait 15 minutes on a scheduled meeting (applies to both buyer and seller) is just as rude as showing up 15 minutes late to an appointment irl.
---
If you cannot commit to an agreed meeting time, then don't commit and deal with the backlash as you are now.  Understandably, you're not running a business, but some amount of decorum is expected on trades, respecting others time and then respecting yours is part of that. 
---
In my opinion, an agreed upon time of trade supersedes my own game play time out of respect for the other player.
---
&gt;baby items (this world loved their lead)
---
lol yes I've noticed the....odd....things like the baby toys and food cans that contain lead.  I haven't tried to see what things contain asbestos, but I bet there are some that are definite no-gos in the real world.
---
Tou che'
---
Wow i didn't know that, thanks
---
Without nerfing weapons into the ground or wiping everyone the economy is already fucked forever for hardcore PvP servers. The servers will be dominated by all the assholes who have already farmed and duped the best stuff to give to their friends or sell. Couple that with their ability to buy every mutation they want and the game is already royally fucked. Bethesda is too far behind on this game for it to ever be taken seriously. 
---
Do you know where i have to look to the flechette mod?
---
So you'd be perfectly fine with creating a game and then having someone use exploits/cheat to gain a large quantity of an item that they couldn't have gotten normally and then turn around and make money off of your property? I can just about guarantee you that those people who are duping and selling their ill gotten gains aren't doing it because they have bills or family to care for. They most often do it out of greed and a quick buck. Btw, I am an adult and I do have bills and a family to take care but I also expect a severe punishment if I went around selling things for real money that not only doesn't belong to me but was gained through illegal (cheats, exploits, etc.) means.  
---
It prevents you from losing mutations AS WELL as getting new ones. So take it off till you get one, then put it on to keep it
---
Right. That is completely understandable. This more so refers to a post that has been up for a few hours and I haven't had a hit on it. But, it comes in waves. I know there are certain functions like the "--close" but people still comment on posts like that and it seems like it works half the time. I always tell people what is going on and about how long of a wait time it will be. I just wish there was an easier way to communicate. 
---
A lot of people don't even know that you can direct chat or direct message on PSN.
---
So I noticed that ‚ÄúWeightless‚Äù armor and weapons still can weight 10pounds? Is that factored into anything at all?
---
I too figured it out recently but it puts a nice little quest marker. Makes it super easy to find your bag even if you die fighting a queen 
---
you're in the correct place to strike a deal!
---
Thate'd backfire, though...if 5 is mostly recycled assets instead of new assets? Like, look at 3. It's all different assets than 4 and 76. If five doesn't have a similar jump, they're going to have some pretty huge issues, of the torch and pitchfork variety. 
---
Get a really high sneak and stealth boy then set up photo before you open menu then snap as fast as you can.
---
I have a couple from doing that......
---
Squirrels still elude me.
---
[184 rolls](https://i.imgur.com/DXzWkj8.png)
---
yep. surprised me when I saw it because I see people complain about not finding bags all the time and I tend to build and go to vendors and get caps/plans so I dont die often.
---
Same here, disconnects and CTD's quite often after the last patch.
---
Just in my personal experience I feel like whenever I kill a 3 star legendary in game it almost always drops at least a 2 star legendary. But with this tool majority of the time the 3 stars are giving 1 star drops. If my personal experience is accurate it would obviously mean the results on the site are not as accurate as they could be.
---
I guess I could Google it but where do I access serums? I'm level 53 but havent really played but a handful of quests. Do I need to do a quest or something because I havent came across them yet
---
Yes, it does work that way. When I wear my normal armor, my strength is 17. When I wear my power armor, my strength is 14. Nobody goes around without any armor at all, so switching to PA means that you are getting weaker. 
---
hey, there's potential here or else I'd walk away completely, but a lot of this is...bullshit. 
---
So if i put a flechette mod i can use it as a. Shotgun?
---
I doubt they would need to go to that length. And I don't think they would be held liable for things users say, as that's not content they are directly responsible for or can even control.
---
Weightless only affects the base weight of the weapon or armor, not any mods it has. Weightless is separate from the weight reduction bonus
---
Yes i did the same with Fallout 4. I enjoyed the story and exploration for the most part but unninstalled it the milisecond i finished the main story because there was nothing else to do after that. I said to myself wish this was a multiplayer. Enter Fallout 76 and it was exactly what i hoped. Except it brought a lot of singleplayer fans who outnumbered us multiplayer fans. Because of that the voice of milions of carebears completly destroyed any form of pvp this game might have had from the start by complaining about how they don't want "griefers" to ruin their singleplayer experience. Now that you desyroyed our game i'm  just waiting for you to leave and our pvp servers to finally come up.
---
This is what I do. I go by that core value as a trader. Thanks for the tip.
---
I found a two shot crossbow once, left it in a golf bag for another player to find.
---
That's how I'm playing it currently 
---
I still get paranoid when I hear it and start looking for super mutants....... 
---
To be fair that‚Äôs how scorched use heavy weapons. Had so many swing their mini guns at me I‚Äôm starting to think 1/4 of their hive mind is getting high behind the dumpsters with the weapon balance team...

Then I think your next bet would be just buy a mutation serum
---
You can make it for free 
---
, get the plans for free from Mining head quarters , took me less than 4 hours to farm enough on 2 character to make each their sets
---
Any storage things count as stash, even chests, trash cans, and things like footlockers and milk machines
---
Its obvious you are not a reasonable person and this discussion is a pointless one. I'm done, have a good one.
---
This.. is just not true. I have almost never encountered another player above level 25 not in power armor. I think this is a valid concern and a reasonable solution. 
---
Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids.
---
It does it once for me then no longer. I‚Äôm talking dying multiple times. 
---
\*sigh\* Don't I just feel silly now....
---
That's different then. I too run a "shop" and get hits on posts that are even days old. I usually just tell them hey I'm at work and let them know the soonest I'll be online. Some have bought elsewhere instead of waiting but I've never had someone legitimately upset. 
---
I wish you could just make multiple stash boxes and exceed the 600lb limit
---
Handle it like every other public facing service. People report abuse. Bad users get banned.
---
I cant think of anything you build in came that if you can store in it doesnt count as stash.
---
Nah the game never really explains it. I figured it out by accident one day 
---
To bad the game is bad.
---
So the stable is Junkable and doesn't spoil?  That's good to know, thanks!
---
Ask me to throw a hallabaloo in your name anf tranq you then slather you in vasoline and slip you into drainage pipe while I tickle your feet. I can do that.
---
I would love to, but regular armor doesn't have the damage resistance or rad resistance that power armor has. My original point is that the game shouldn't lower your base strength to 11 so that you are weaker in power armor than regular armor.
---
Same. A lot of what I have been hearing is "I could have bought elsewhere, but I waited until you were online so can I get a discount?"
---
Dying multiple times is different. It will only display your most recent bag. You should focus on picking your first bag up before dying again, or at least remembering generally where it is 
---
Sorry I can‚Äôt . That thing cost me too much time farming for it.
---
It looks posh as heck with the steel building parts. 
---
Sure mate.
---
I picked up Cannibal and Lead Belly for my own amusement. I get a kick out of eating corpses. Plus now I don't need to carry food. Especially now that I have the Carnivore mutation so I've get twice the benefit.
---
Correct. Star stays unless used. No inerting!
---
I‚Äôll try this. If I die the first time it adds the quest marker automatically and there‚Äôs a diamond. If I die multiple times because I get myself into idiotic situations then I don‚Äôt get the marker anymore. 
---
More importantly, if no one is buying from the Atomic Shop...
---
Heh I havent seen that one. For me, I already have the cheapest the prices. That's their discount :)
---
I'm on XB1 and been playing since its general release in November. 
---
* Never been one-shotted.
---
* Never come back to a camp that's been destroyed by another player (and I'm in a high traffic area).
---
* I've had two players follow me around, harassing me and trying to chip away my health. Once I was level seven and had to server hop and the second I was in my high 40s and could laugh it off until the other person gave up.
---
* After one patch the game was literally unplayable (had a lot of trouble loading in and averaged one disconnect every six or seven minutes) until I purchased a better gaming router. 
---
* I still get a fair amount of disconnects and endless loading screens that force me into doing a hard reset of the console. 
---
Enclave bunker science wing sells them for 4k a pop or ask around on reddit for cheaper. Apply lvl 2 starched genes after you have it though
---
This is tangential, but when you are shown putting on your power armor, you are still wearing your regular armor. I understand the regular armor comes off, but the game doesn't show it that way.
---
There is nothing you can build now for storage that isn‚Äôt linked to Stash.
---
I think wanted player's camps should show up on the map after a certain threshold,
---
Here are my thoughts.
---
&lt;100 caps same as now, you get marked with a bounty on the map
---
100-300 caps and you get a misc quest marker on your head to everyone else, who also get a stimpack or other trash tier useless garbage that quests give.
---
300+ and your camp shows up on the map, you get the quest marker.
---
1000+ caps and a world event spawns, hunt the baddy, and everyone who damages them gets a reward when they kill you.
---
I know there are issues with friends claiming their own bounties, but that is already a thing.
---
Word play? Where? I used your own words to demonstrate how your ban is justified, contrary to what you chose to believe. Nothing else. Your ignorance is starting to border delusion at this point.
---
&gt;fresh out of the vault
---
I could ask once again how your first instinct after receiving 70,000lbs worth of rare, expensive items that far outlevel you and you admit to knowing were rare and hard to come by, for free, your first thought was to distribute them instead of looking into their legitimacy. However, you've ignored all of my other questions above, instead choosing to continue crying victim, now of "mean, spiteful remarks" so I won't spend any more time on the wall of ignorance you've built for yourself to find an excuse.
---
Personally I prefer using the Propaganda Letter you get from killing some Liberators. It's also a good laugh to just dump them at random camps for no reason at all.
---
Easy for you to say when the baddies are hanging around awaiting my return! 
---
Im trying to say I know where it is and it‚Äôs just not visible. Can‚Äôt find it. Can‚Äôt see it. Can‚Äôt grab it! 
---
For the third time in two days, the SBQ's corpse have vanished before anyone of us could get any loot. To make matters worse, the game CTD'ed all 3 times, within a couple of seconds after the corpse disappeared, so there was no going back and searching either. (I verified the game files yesterday, so that ain't it).
---
PLEASE don't despawn the queen so fast. Let us loot the end game boss which took several thousand rounds of ammo to take down. I really can't be asking for too much here, right? 
---
There's no reason not to have legendaries for all weapon type.
---
I did it myself last night and honestly, it did kind of suck.  Immediately after the rush of doing it was over I thought about how much I didn't want to go through that process again. It really wasn't all that hard, just tedious. It took me forty two minutes which seems like forever when you factor in the shit servers and the possibility of getting disconnected at any time stuck in the back of your mind.
---
Cool story
---
I am a reasonable person, but I just don't see the point of letting someone cheat and profit from it. You too man.
---
Your suggestion is too long winded, if you want them to implement it you should keep it short and sweet.
---
Do u get plans to craft them like anything else?
---
You sound very naive.  If I followed your comment, I would never buy any games and therefore never give any feedback to the developers about the game.  No game is perfect.
---
I think servers are lasting longer and so things are staying in containers long enough for people to find them now 
---
That I don't know then. Maybe some times it disappears just like when dropping items from your inventory. Bug or feature, who knows 
---
If you are on xbx1 I learned it and can mod it. If not, just the vendors on the cap run. 
---
Damn that's pricey
---
You sorry Grognak wrong
---
The radio reminds me of my home, far away.
---
Oh sorry
---
As above, any container you can build in camp is just cosmetic versions of your one and only stash.
---
Building multiple doesn't change the size and as with normal stashes nobody else can steal anything from it.
---
Wah Toe Gah
---
Rolled and got a 2 star anti armor combat knife, ignores 50% armor and does 40% more power attic dmg... not bad
---
Rule 6 us ridiculous, I sometimes get the feeling that some of the mods havn't actually played this game if they don't understand the topic...
---
As rate drops from the queen I think, I never seen one
---
It‚Äôs become a bit dog eat dog regarding fusion cores. And I swear they power down faster than they did before the ‚Äòfix‚Äô. My pa is for special occasions only now.
---
Bugged since the last update
---
Not if it's active, no. And the main door does seem unusually... *verdant*, doesn't it?
---
They‚Äôre not working. Saw someone post it the other day too and happened across there myself today. Can confirm it‚Äôs the same on PS4.
---
Lol omg I knew exactly what this was and watched it 5 times. I have a funny sick sense of humor
---
In the end I managed to escape by devouring sugar and running into the trees.
---
"Class action lawsuit"? No. 
---
Promising one product and failing to deliver said product and shipping a different product instead is, legally, fraud. Fraud is a crime. The fact that they fixed it after doesn't actually fully remove the possibility of legal ramifications. The illegal act occurred, and if a governing agency chooses to get their mitts in, to set an example, bethesda could still get HAMMERED over that. 
---
When they chose to auto-opt people in for zenimax adds on other websites, they violated GDPR, article seven. Not American law, but still, law, in a region in which they are making sales, which again, could be a major issue for them down the road. 
---
Just as a couple of examples. 
---
I think you‚Äôre confused. This is just totally not true. 
---
Oh no, it's been /r/dtg'd. RIP
---
Yes it is, but you still can‚Äôt have it. Put some effort fucker
---
Drops rare plans, supposedly including shielded raider lining.
---
Taking anything or taking everything? 
---
Huge population? Based on what? Not everyone blindly takes 70,000lbs worth of duped items and proceeds to distribute them...
---
OK, thanks.
---
Same thing happened to me and mine appeared in my stash a few irl days later
---
Oh god, I hope not. The pay-to-win lunch boxes would be inevitable at that point. 
---
Trade players.
---
They go for 250-300 caps each
---
My culture is cancer? I don't really know what you're associating me with, but it's obvious that you're the problem here. 
---
You're hostile and insulting, I'm not surprised that you don't get along well with others. They should offer an offline mode so you can crawl back under your rock.
---
'My Fallout'.. funny.. 'cause this is supposed to be a fresh idea for the franchise and if they wanted another single player experience, they could of easily made it. 
---
No 
---
Run faster, jump higher, and somehow talons poke through it.
---
But this is suspension of disbelief video game physics time.
---
The actual end game is out of power armor. The only redeeming aspect of power armor is the hidden rad resist multiplier/flag/whatever. Most of the power armor mods have better versions elsewhere, including just using chems, and the legendary gear effects are incredible in comparison to, let's say, a jetpack.
---
Sentinel for a flat damage reduction when standing still or a jetpack? It's pretty obvious which one is endgame worthy. ;)
---
I figured that out last night too. I'd been wondering why I'd be looting power armor frames and 5 minutes later I'd see the blinking light go off in my suit when I should've had at least 3 cores on me. A full bar of AP with 15 agility uses up like half a fusion core in the span of 3 seconds. And I have perks that reset my AP bar so I'd burn through multiple cores faster than a single gun magazine.
---
I use blackbird or bos paint and t60 is truly a workhorse suit all the def you need and virtually nothing to repair
---
Lol I sell clothing to the vendors for caps cause its the best cost to weight ratio
---
This scenario would have played out the same in any MMO, though 76 retains much of the single-player feel of the previous games. It's like someone handed you a stack of aces at a poker tournament and you've been slipping them to other players, albeit with no real money at stake.
---
Put them on frames to reduce weight? But you might have done that already. I can live with the weight. Only have PA and heavy guns with bear arms plus 2 melees, thats it. I do not hoard though and i have to clean my stash often....üòí calibrated shocks help a bit i guess.
---
I've been collecting live attack photos. Much more exciting that way.
---
Bag should be vault tec blue and yellow. With a bow on it. Don‚Äôt @ me üòã
---
Yes indeed weird but I haven‚Äôt tried swapping that one perk 
---
&gt; and sometimes herbavore
---
So you can mutate, you're just unlucky.
---
Actually found 2 TSE weapons this way.
---
I haven‚Äôt touched mine because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen ultracite so I don‚Äôt know how to repair it. Some kind soul help a brother out?
---
Wait, you only lose Junk when you die, so unless you went ‚Äúshopping‚Äù before you headed back to get your bag, there wouldn‚Äôt be a second bag if you get taken out again.
---
Yeaaa, I once died in tall grass with a huge amount of stuff, then got ganked by a scorchbeast on the way back. Couldn't find that bag.
---
Ps4.
---
 i look often at the watoga station, phoenix and harpers ferry but never found this mod
---
Not as of last week anyway, not sure there is a way to the way they coded it
---
Im only talking about a single colour. If i find a red paint can i should be able to paint my stuff red. If i find red and blue paint i should be able to mix then and make purple.
---
Oh I didn't know there's a vendor at Charleston, will have to try to find that. :O
---
Whitespring does sell 3-4 'Elegant' items, but I've never seen the couches there. Early confirmation said Watoga Phoenix sold them, and it does sell the Elegant Chairs, but that's the place I hit up like 40-50 times and never saw the plans. :(
---
God forbid the budget isn't completely spent or they will get a 5% reduction in the next fiscal year. 
---
Dailies are definitely screwy. It does not matter how many times I enter the Mire and from any direction I have only ever been able to do QotH, Boomer and the Nanny Robot ONCE since launch.
---
I like disabling protector on arms in Watoga, then I do the same as you.
---
Seriously a Jack Donaghy move.
---
This has been my favorite analogy yet. Well said.
---
Clickbaiting fake news. 
---
One retailer in Australia is "recalling copies", so that means free to play is coming? Or maybe they've found a spelling mistake on the box, or there's a dispute over the age rating, or countless other theories.
---
"the game might survive, if the companies core audience fucks off and leaves the few griefers like me alone"? I'd ask if you were a fucking idiot, but...
---
Nah combat armor with lead lined but the legendary rad resist perks don‚Äôt work my power armor gives like 475 resist and thats fine
---
I can't see the video but the post says "workshop" and "they attacked first", so.....
---
Did they boop the workshop bench? If so, that has nothing to do with wanted. That's PVP.
---
Ok thats weird with the post üòÇ. Oh well, i am just a cynical man as stated. Nothing personal. Good luck anyways
---
I started collecting the ious from that bunker and started leaving them in peoples camps
---
You should be able to light the bag on fire and leave it on a doorstep 
---
Really don't know, i found it early but i didn't try because i log out, but it has a great lvl of damage
---
Unfortunately might take more than 6 months to get this game good. Npcs and a meaning to play hopefully will come sooner than later
---
There are a few ‚Äúrock arches‚Äù that would make a very nice place to stand under, I can‚Äôt remember where, I think one was north of the bbq place, and another was up in the edge of a cliff for a very nice view 
---
MMO people gang up and browbeat developers into changing games to suit their tastes.
---
Golf Skirts and Golf Outfits are usually pretty decent 
---
Why does wearing normal armor increase your strength?
---
Is it al copies? I still see a few in my two closest stores.
---
Are you sure they arent just sending the extras back to headquarters to make room for the new stuff coming out soon. Or are they getting rid of them all?
---
I had one of those, but then I forgot to stash it and ran Monster Mash again. :'(
---
There is a perk for anti armor?
---
As I said, it's a rumor so take it with a hefty grain of salt. Could definitely turn out to be nothing.
---
No. Imagine the following:  
---
you have a stack of 30 of item A and a stack of 60 of item B.  
---
Item A = 0.05 per item  
---
Item B = 0.03 per item  
---
30\*0.05 = 1.5  
---
60\*0.03 = 1.8  
---
So for purposes of sorting by item weight A is heavier than B. But the stack of B is heavier than the stack of A
---
I love photomode too but all my pics are ruined by a graphic but I have where my character appears to be silver an like a mini sun
---
There's a time for risk-taking, but it's not in a huge undertaking like this. Yes, it's interesting and ambitious...as a fallout franchise. There's nothing really though that's all that novel for multiplayer gaming, and it should have been tested and delivered in a much better state. 
---
What they did was just plain sloppy, and more than likely they just pushed a known bad product out early so they could milk holiday sales. Ironic that it was selling at over half off original price by Black Friday. Wonder how much revenue they've actually missed out on from this blunder, not to mention how much damage to the brand they've done.
---
Ctrl + F 
---
Npcs...  
---
Todd that you? Didn't learn huh
---
My PSN: Dr-Killjoy___20
---
(btw: 3 underscores before 20)
---
Maybe if you watched the Video, you would see what happened, instead of making up your own objective reality.
---
I think the only thing you can't find in legendary is pipe revolvers now.
---
I have a legendary crossbow.
---
Sorry for late reply
---
Good. Thank you for all your responses. You fit right into what I imagined the community fueled with backlash would do and say, however your acting has been your own. Tried, yet failed. 
---
It‚Äôs in intelligence only while in power armor 
---
You're welcome. I'm hoping I can find the other plans. It's a shame the hat one is broken.
---
I had double of everything on mine two head pieces etc. I ended up scrapping the parts with the least durability, making sure to keep one of each now I‚Äôm missing the helm a leg and an arm. 
---
I've been reading all sorts of posts from gaming news sites, forums, reddits, facebook as well as my own personal friend base. I have attempted to learn all I can about it before speaking my mind. I even read all of the terms and conditions and the rules of conduct they provide in the email. One more reason I felt completely entitled in explaining my own situation.
---
Unless they can pump out a DLC-sized content update? Yeah, enjoy it while you can.
---
And as the rules say: Do not post rumors without actual evidence.
---
Just counted mine and starting on 12/24, day i bought and downloaded game, i have had 37 error crashes. That doesn't count the the ingame dc's that send ya back to main menu. As i look at the dates, its been pretty much everyday with multiple on some days. Makes me question why i still log on. Never had a problem like this with any other game and the proof is right here in the history. Good tip tho, had forgot about the error history menu. Can't argue its not a problem when it's all right here. 
---
Thank you. I'll take all the luck I can get.
---
Uh, I see you're salty, but no one made up any reality. It was even prefixed by "I can't watch the video".
---
Good job.
---
Hmm. Thanks.
---
garbage rumors much like segmentnext
---
Maybe i will re post this some time. Youre probably right.
---
Bethesda doesn't officialy support mods yet. But thanks :)  
---
Besides, we shouldn't need mod to such an important aspect of the game
---
Seems sensible unless the game crashes or disconnects a lot. Is good with salt worth getting?
---
ANYTHING but a brown paper bag. It‚Äôs really cruel! Big present with a big bow!  Hey dumbass, here‚Äôs the shit you dropped...again...
---
They should just block PvP till level 50 and make it so if you get flagged too many times eventually you just get set as a raider and stop losing caps, instead just let people kill you with out getting flagged.
---
Huge bugs like this really need to be fixed in the core, not with a mod. And as always, it means jack-all for console players either way.
---
*nodding*
---
"If you can't access it, then don't leave a comment assuming what it's about."
---
&gt; "Did they boop the workshop bench? If so, that has nothing to do with wanted. That's PVP."
---
&gt; We know that power armor does the work for your muscles, so it doesn't make any sense that mutations mean you can run faster or jump higher while in it.
---
Lore explanation:  
---
Power armor supplements your physical abilities. It makes you stronger (PA grants +2 Str).
---
&gt; Not wearing power armor in the end game is not really an option even though numerous armor perk cards suggest that a non-power armor build should be viable.
---
Game mechanics explanation:  
---
Actually once you get a respectable selection of legendary armor it out-classes power armor in all ways except radiation resistance.
---
A suit of PA gives around 500 damage resist while a set of normal non-power armor gives around 300 damage resist. The difference isn't as much as you'd think, about +/- 20% damage taken.
---
With legendary armor however you can mix legendary modifiers to your preference including stacking damage reductions which can tip the balance greatly in favour of non-powered armor.
---
Okay, will delete and rephrase.
---
In the Mayor for a Day quest the saboteur mentions in his holo-tape tape his body is succumbing to paralysis.
---
Ugh I feel for ya. 
---
No, I get it. You're incredibly angry over something and want to blame someone else.
---
I'm here for you, little one. Shout at me.
---
Compulsive hoarder?
---
Mine runs really good my typical game session is 4 to 5 hours couple days a week with a long day every couple weeks of 8 hours I got lucky and just bought me a msi gaming laptop for playing and recording right before this was released, think I have server disconnect error 2 times since beta and other than a slight stutter every now and then no real big issues with game
---
True 
---
Anything you're buying from players is going to be skewed right now, because of all the duping.  
---
Use the fixed vendor prices as a gauge for intent. 
---
Not really destroyed, just the walls and things destroyed turn invisible, if you go to your camp, you can just say repair all but is going to need materials. With the contractor perk it lowers the cost, easy to repair but you going to lose materials, nothing you can really do about it.
---
You can also repair individual walls manually by walking up to it and say repair, plus anyone can repair your stuff, I repair peoples turrets now and then.
---
That is good to know. I see it a lot but I've never managed to be certain if the ammo was really going away.
---
I‚Äôm so lost, please someone ELI5 how you can pick and choose between mutations? 
---
If you want to start being taken seriously, provide 1 link to proof that a "huge population" of this game was wrongfully banned, not anecdotal evidence.
---
I used to trade for powerful weapons... the other day i've dropped all the weapons that i bought on the market in the river... i don't care of powerful weapons i don't need them. I just wanna play the game.
---
This is the 2nd time I've heard of a level 3 player being killed in PVP. I thought we were supposed to be safe until level 5.
---
Where is this at. I love the view. I'm not stealing it from you I'm on Xbox. Lol
---
I believe there is a setting that allows a marker to hover over the quest objective. Once you‚Äôve made the ‚Äúrecover your loot bag‚Äù quest active, this setting should make it easy as pie to find the bag. 
---
A large supply of stimpacks and a Medic Pump equipped power armor chest piece make it a breeze. Just be sure to kill the Assaultrons as soon as they spawn, then focus on the Mr. Gutsys. I swear they have 90% armor reduction on those guns.  
---
Glass caverns and scorchbeasts
---
Christ man i clicked topic to learn more about the wanted system not see people be pricks
---
I think its bugged, I can't loot the treasure either. Tried restarting game, reconnecting etc. Tried to look at it from all different angles, couldn't get it, Gotta be bugged.
---
I see people tend to attack camps in order to gain bounty on order to advertise themselves as 'pvp plz'. The bounty system being a deterrent could work for first 100 levels. After that, after reaching the caps pool, it does not perform its function. On the contrary, its being used to flag map for PvP.
---
I really believe what would solve this issue is a way to put a PvP marker on the map without damaging any camps... I also believe that introducing PvP related content would relieve the pressure on PvE players.
---
Or r/market76
---
For one it takes longer then 2 mins to kill the queen. Even with the current TSE. If it‚Äôs 2 mins it‚Äôs a duper stacking bobbleheads and such.
---
And my melee build is just using a one star legendary to one shot nearly everything apart of the queen.
---
So no bloodied even needed. 
---
if people ever talk in this game all it takes after the event is a brief "hey u guys wanna trade ur loot " and like above most people will trade or just drop what they dont want
---
I've never lost an item that I know, but for sure several times I've found something in my favorites wheel (like an armor piece from a quest reward, or a bowl of soup) that I certainly did not put there.
---
Also you can just walk up to your camp and select repair all, use the contractor perk to lower the cost. Should take hours, junk is literally everywhere, but it is an inconvenience and annoyance non the less.
---
Yeah, if you can find someone to mod it that would be the fastest. Just post and offer 100c or something. 
---
Well she's got the trapper legs equipped, but she's standing in a pool of that orangish sludge found in the northern part of the map
---
I used to trade for powerful weapons... the other day i've dropped all in the river... i don't care of powerful weapons i don't need them. I just wanna play the game.
---
Right? So what happens?
---
Not my fault Dropbox doesn't want to give me a preview window to watch it.
---
Or how about you use search and comment in one of the dozens existing topics discussing it instead of adding repetitive clutter?
---
Yep it is a responder vendor bot that spawns randomly. I havent tried to force it to spawn but people claim if you run the tracks between charleston trainyard and charsleston trainstation he will eventually spawn.
---
It will most likely be free to play within the next couple months, so you can invite friends to download for free too.
---
EB games is still around?
---
This had a comment, you took it down and reposted....why?
---
Heavy weapons +% damage affect it?
---
Max is 90% weight reduction so if you have the perk maxed it cant go down any further. Gives good options to free up some perk ranks
---
But you die and have to choose a respawn point, right?
---
Vault 76?
---
Well said
---
again with this bullshit? the site claims amazon only has 28 to sell which is false on its face.
---
I sincerely hope you are right. I weep for the junk I‚Äôve lost...
---
&gt; Nobody has ~~Medic~~ anything but TSE weapons available for trading. Why? Because they've already thrown theirs away, because everyone just assumes that it is garbage.
---
FTFY, it's nigh impossible to find anything that isn't top-tier meta thanks to the combination of dupe exploits and the other legendary affixes actually being trash (in comparison).
---
What is the effect of this mod?
---
I've scrapped several and have never learned a damn thing. I've had to buy all my mods from Watoga. Speaking of, why does the BoS vender sell Enclave gear that MODUS doesn't? 
---
I was informed that my phrasing broke the rules of the subreddit. I re-posted to avoid confusion by posting the actual news (that EB is pulling copies, which is confirmed) rather than the speculation (that it might be going F2P) so it didn't break the rules about unsubstantiated rumors. The new thread adheres to the rules.
---
Yes it‚Äôs a heavy weapon 
---
Super mutant voices are piece of art, wait until you see(hear) super mutants attempt of luring you out with a 'surprise'. They must be aware of your presence but not position to say that line.
---
Why are you trying to act innocent in this?
---
You continue to prove your own ignorance. Ignoring questions, selective reading and responding, wrongful accusations, outright lies directed at those who say anything that goes against your victim complex you developed for yourself and now this weak attempt at bailing. From being indifferent I am now actually happy to see there's 1 less person like you playing and ruining the game for those that don't partake in distribution of illicit items.
---
You might just be.
---
That‚Äôs why then. Seems to work fine if you‚Äôre only into dying once. 
---
Good. I'm an heavy weapon player .. so it fits for me
---
Dope. I can do those things. Thanks. 
---
Completely agree.

First person shooters have used a grenade hotkey for literally decades. And here is Bethesda, trying to be all cool and reinventing the wheel...all the while wondering why everyone's pissed that its square...
---
What.... What? üòÇ
---
Why are you trying to act insane? 
---
Alright, the reaction here has been very negative so I'll go ahead and delete the thread. I thought the news of copies being pulled was interesting but if it's not good for this subreddit I have no qualms about removing the thread. 
---
I've noticed this too, that everyone that lashes in return demands they see even more than all these people have stated or already provided. I've read countless posts and seen images after images of poeple stating the same on numerous social media sites. Even after providing anything the accuser asks for, they still are cruel, when they were not involved at all. I doubt I will fold on any demands any random Reddit user will attempt to get from me. My words are true, and for me, and the people in my shoes, that's what I know and will continue to stand by and will suffice to be more than enough. People will continue to be closed minded, I spoke to be part of the players caught up in-between it all. If it happened to me, there has to be others too. I'm too bold to stay in silence.
---
Yet you still kept "speculation" right in the title lol...
---
At least in FO4 this could be overcome with the "keybindings done proper" mod (requires F4SE) - and after Beth broke some of that you needed to also add AutoHotKey because trying to map the favourites button after a certain version crashes the game. So you need AutoHotKey to spoof it. 
---
(I wouldn't want to spoof all the keys with AutoHotKey though. It can get a bit laggy) 
---
To add icing to the cake. Bethesda regularly break F4SE with their shite creation club updates.
---
I didnt think the game would keep your first bag if you die again. having to hunt down multiple bags must be a pain.
---
193 spins before I got a 3 star! 
---
I haven‚Äôt really checked this but perhaps the challenges are written in binary:
---
1001 = 1+8 = 9 events
---
1111 = 1+2+4+8 = 15 events
---
I really haven‚Äôt noticed when one of these triggered though ...
---
Attitudes like those of the parent comment frustrate me as someone who tries to listen to the issues of others. Why? I'll put it like this:
---
If a friend comes up to you and says "I got sprayed by a skunk", is it polite or appropriate to just respond with "Well I didn't get sprayed by a skunk" after?
---
No, because (in this hypothetical scenario) you are simultaneously pulling focus away from someone with an issue while focusing on the fact that you aren't having an issue. It comes across as self centered and doesn't serve to advance the conversation, as your friend knows you haven't been sprayed because you are carrying on as normal. Another example: oCould you imagine if you asked about the frequency of computer crashes on stack overflow and the only responses were "I've never had a computer crash" and nothing else?
---
That's why people get mad about comments like parent one, as they do not offer solutions and don't really contribute to any discussion. Also, they make it harder for people experiencing issues to find solutions because they have to filter them out.
---
(In addition, some bad actors on the sub have a bad habit of downvoting bug posts or posts asking about issues. Thankfully this trend seems to be dying down, but I wouldn't want it to return)
---
I like the thought. Great idea hope they implement it.
---
I checked it out.  With just 1 rank in pistol, EP, and MP - its damage is around 40pts higher then the eq. HR.  Now to figure out what other AG perk I can sacrifice to bump the pistols up more
---
It was interesting the first 5 times it was posted.
---
You literally come on trying to act smug about, "That has nothing to do with Wanted. That's PVP."
---
You can't watch the video, then Why leave a comment assuming?
---
Yea 
---
Have a camp sort of near center map. Have decent range due to altitude, but if you want to use them for real you have to have that in mind when placing your camp. Test the range from high up and place your camp someplace where you might actually need/want back up fire from artillery. 
---
My base isn't very portable so I stuck with being able hit an area I plan to be in often, and mostly use it to get away if my weapons break or I need food/ammo/etc. 
---
?
---
Of course, that is the nature of the article, and I did not want to misrepresent the situation (that games are being pulled) or the article (that is speculating it could be a sign of the game going F2P). I don't understand why this is so offensive. It's obviously a rumor that should be taken with a grain of salt at best, and I said that in the OP.
---
Except guys like this pretend raiders only like soft targets and not someone that can actually challenge him, no different than the toxic players on GTA, I call them soft target pussies because that's what they are, go after people who don't actually want to play their style and are soft targets, basically shooting fish in a barrel, takes real skill no doubt. It's funny how he is trying to claim you telling him to opt out while he is saying the exact same thing, asking you to opt in to his style when you couldn't care less, it's hilarious.
---
Did i try to kill you at white springs the other day? You were wanted but for some reason we couldn't do any damage to each other. It was a guy in a ritual mask going to town on me with a knife, i had a gragnak axe. That was a good time, we ended up just doing the confused emote at each other and i walked away.
---
The story drives the franchise.  They need to get back to storytelling.
---
That doesn't include wanted status i believe
---
I suggested an addition to the atom shop and someone called me cancer and said I had no self respect. After looking at their post history, basically, they're an asshole who thinks they are super knowledgeable about all things, so I just let it go. If there were a chance a civil conversation, I would have argued my side.
---
I'm still carrying mine.  If thats a problem, they can delete it from my inv.
---
Anyway i don't know if your friends used to know that they were trading with dupers but i'm sorry for them
---
You're being a hypocrite to your own statements throughout your comments now. I have read all you have written and focus on what I want to. Same could be said for you, and that you have overlooked so many of words just to keep focusing on your cruel and diminishing points. I don't fall for it. Even though you continue, you are constantly fading away now, proving you will write what makes you happy instead of attempting to see any sort of the bigger picture. You said you'd leave my wall of ignorance, yet you stay. How could I ever explain my own words to someone who can't stand by their own?
---
I did watch the video, and can't make out what is happening.
---
You are in the racetrack workshop waiting to harvest silver. I don't see any change to your health gauge when you jump over the harvester. He is not wanted, You kill him with a rocket sledge and get wanted.
---
Are you sure it was him that shot you and not another player? 
---
One round turns to 7 rounds. 
---
taking one item
---
My PS4 Slim says "Supersampling mode enabled" every time I start FO76 :/  confusing!
---
Challenging, lol, it's so unbalanced and hardly a challenge, you joking right ?
---
Did I?
---
And if I could watch the video I would.... but I can't.
---
I mean, really, at this point I would love to watch the video just to see what happens, but I can't.
---
You also left out the question you were asked and refused to answer so that you could shout at the first random you encountered. Did they try to claim the workbench? All they have to do is tough it and you're fair game.
---
There's the "The Path to Enlightenment" event at the Landview Lighthouse.
---
Glad I'm not the only one taking groinal shots
---
Oh god, that *is* a rabbit hole. But very good information. Thank you.
---
I have a quad crossbow, shooting it makes me giggle not having to reload a bolt every time is silly
---
I love seeing them crawl around on the ground lol
---
What are you gonna do, bleed on me??? Muahahaha!!!
---
I didn't realize we actually had mods here. Thought it was just bots like in the game. 
---
For guns all thats left is the pipe revolver. Legendary drills and chainsaws dont exist either. I dont care whether they get legendary effects, but if they dont I hope bethesda removes them from the ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù drop pool. 
---
I'm not really on the hate train but that's a great song. You know you've fucked up when someone sings a song about it.
---
It was to be in another thread (above) but I messed it up. Also, English is not my first language, nor my second. 
---
I bet he gets all pissy when someone "raids" his camp .. or steals his water. I bet you he also locks everything. I lmao when I see these houses and everything is locked.
---
They do stack. My handmade weighs 13 lbs.
---
I have no problem with this as long as you can opt out of it completely. It‚Äôs fine if you want to share all of that but some people don‚Äôt. Which is ok too. 
---
I think crossed barbed wire walking canes would be a better symbol for PvP.
---
Just sayin'.
---
I do feel better knowing someone else thought the same thing.
---
I have also said that I will not stay silent to your false accusations and lies directed at me. The bigger picture is exactly what I'm looking at when I say you contributed to the problem that is duping and have been rightly banned for doing so.
---
Oh, is that why you sometimes get a random normal drill from a legendary?
---
I never realized that.
---
It's a bit south east of Black Water mine and directly south of the cabin north east of the mine fast travel spot.  There is a trail up there that starts near the Whitespring train station.  Look for lead on the way up.  Your in the right area when there is a billboard directly below you. 
---
Agreed, we shouldn‚Äôt have to and that‚Äôs why they need to add the functionality of a mod like Better Inventory into the game ASAP.  No reason we have modders who can make that, a perk loadout manager, and a check on if we own a plan and yet they‚Äôre still not part of the base game.
---
Let‚Äôs go with bug. It‚Äôs easier to accept üò¢
---
Yeah. Helps explain some of the no drop legendary enemies. 
---
I love too partner
---
I've been gaming with keyboard mouse for decades now. Since the very first doom pretty much and I largely use the same bindings every time. Like you said. Muscle memory. Therefore the basics are always in the same place. 
---
Sure, you may forget where a specific detail was mapped on one game if you give it a break to play another for a while...but basic navigation/aim/fire/crouch are always in the same places.
---
Then, twice now, you'e stated that you are a hypocrite. Please continue.
---
Some did and some think that they where hack
---
Lol so tse's cost 20k and serums are 4k?
---
Gimme a break
---
Console doesn't have this problem lol. Press power attack don't hold it and you won't use a grenade. Hold breath is hold down stick
---
20 Seconds, under Attack. You can confirm it is him by both his player name overhead and lined by the text of being attacked. For all intensive purposes, it should have just been a normal PvP instance. 
---
That's a lot of people that paid for the game, and have put it back down.
---
It happened again
---
