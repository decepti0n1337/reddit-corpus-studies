Another wall of text i didn't bother to read , bubye
---
---
---
I'm not talking about magic weapons. I'm talking about the hacked weapons. So a PC issue only I guess.
---

---
But Earle being dead before my Gatling Plasma spun up was not hyperbole. It literally happened yesterday.
---
Sure, but all the same I find it really bizarre... I'd been on the server a couple of hours, they hadn't flagged me down in game and they weren't on my list of recent players, so I hadn't encountered them??
---
You‚Äôre only level 64, save it for when you get to level 100.
---
So you're saying I should just explore till 50?
---
Yeah I have noticed the acid damage isn‚Äôt all that great but I wanted it for the look I use the solar armor as well I was very close to beating the vault mission before they closed it down doing it solo I love the impossible mission
---
I am not telling you at all what you should do. üòù
---
I have told some people that if they feel they‚Äôre not progressing like they want, they could fill in their map more.
---
If you want to see one more predictably you can force a spawn with the Queen of the Hunt daily.  The quest's random cryptid spawn can include the flatwoods monster, and you just have to server hope and repeat the steps until it happens to spawn.
---
As someone who just got this game a few days ago, I really appreciate senior players like yourself! I hope to be able to return the favors to new players once I get established!
---
Yeah, challenges are great. Good luck on the Dominators. There's a quest line where you face at least two of them and my main weapon, a shotgun that can chew things up and stun them, broke. That was hard.
---
Is his name Edward Cullen?
---
Wow!!
---
Its a game mechanic for the game to constantly crash? Todd Howard is that you?
---
Aw, wholesome
---
Oh yeah, that was a bug that neutered unarmed, it‚Äôs going to be fixed to a reasonable number.
---
Its almost like the game shouldnt crash just because you didnt drink or eat.
---
I felt like this a while back as well, so I did two things. Played something else for a couple weeks/month, then when you come back play for the people and not the game. What I mean is, I redid my base across the road from The Wayword and I sell goods to new players. I go and gather clothing, chems, bullets, exc and sell them for super cheap. I see it as playing from a different point of view, while helping new players and maybe friends.
---
This is kind of one of the pitfalls for mmo's. The grind can be a real bummer once you've cleared through all of the content.  There are a few options to combat this, Listed in no particular order:
---
Find a group of people to play with.  A sense of community or comradeship can liven up the experience.
---
Take a break for a while and wait for new content to hit. It's ok to not play every day for months on end. Play when there's something there for you, take time off when it stops being fun.
---
Find a different game that gives you what you are looking for. There's a lot out there to play, 76 might not be the best thing for you, and that's ok.
---
My heart goes out to you friend. I have experienced mmo burnout a few times myself and it certainly can be a drain on your mental wellbeing.
---
other things for the new people; ALMOST no one is going to buy your 500 cap common plans, selling ammo (excluding ultracite varieties and both forms of cores) above like 3 caps each is also a waste, cores and ultra obviously sell for what you think its worth but it obviously caters to specific playstyles like I have 20 cores that I never use so to me they‚Äôre useless and just extra weight- but to builds that specialize in heavy energy and power armor they might be willing to pay more, and finally please stop joining A Colossal Problem if you‚Äôre under 100; there‚Äôs limited slots in the event, the boss is 110, and theres only 20ish minutes to really complete the event, and while on some servers theres a savior who can carry the event, the vast majority of the runs I see are 6 lv 150-400 players and like 1-2 level 16-20 players that just hide the whole time essentially barring someone else from the server.
---
I would much rather be exploring. I get that the wastlanders xpac was meant to fix bugs but I have never agreed with them adding all these npcs. I didn't play before then but I gathered the world was meant to be explored.
---
Vlad Dracula.
---
Great job! Looks amazing
---
I love seeing a swarm of those green gangly assholes about to swarm someone and I unload killing them fast keeping them free to fight earl
---
Yep same thing happened to a friend, he forgot backpack bonuses disappear when in PA.
---
Keeping my fellow player free to fight earl
---
Well you said the guy even played in the event before nuking shit.
---
Either he did the silo super fast or you guys kills waaaaay too slow. If it's the latter, you don't even need god rolls or hacked guns to beat that time lmao.
---
And you‚Äôll stake your reputation on this?
---
Any clue the specifics of what their realy doing with the update yet?
---
I'm sorry, but I've got to tell a little story. It was last year, pre wastelanders. 
---
I come across one of those white springs train vendors camps that is bustling with activity, and decide I'll stick around and watch. Something hilarious normally always happens when there is a large group of players in one area. See a guy in a vault suit wandering around so I starting making my generic noob care package. 50. Cal hunting rifle with some ammo, treated vault suit, some healing, water and food. Manage to lure the guy away and drop it for him. He sends me a message asking if I can mod his 10mm. I agree. Then he sedns party invite and I stupidly join thanking it'll be a quick thank you and save some typing. Now I'm in a party of several low level children who ALL want the hand outs. Oh well, I can make some more vault suits I guess. To my surprise and great annoyance the first thing they ask it if I can solo the vault raid for them. I say no, wastelanders is coming out in a week anyways so it would be a waste of time.  They immediately ask again, I try to politely decline again by saying it would take way to much ammo and consumables for it to be worth me doing and it was a no go. They ask how long it's going to take me to get that ready like I didnt just say no twice. Now I'm  thinking of ways to politely bug out of the party while they steadily hound me to walking them through things. No man, I cant help you get a regular back pack in 30 minutes. I'm not going to try and trade me legacies to get you a B2525 handmade. No, I'm not soloing the vault raids for you.  Like, come on? At what point are you going to play this game for yourself. 
---
I eventually left, and I still occasionally help lower levels, but I no longer actively carry on conversations. If somebody gives you something, please don't wait around expecting more. And PLEASE do not try and extend that generosity to the other people around you. Most people are great, but a few people are ruining it for the rest of you.
---
Never forget the first time I spawned encyptid, done the quest line leading up to it not really knowing what was gonna happen. My mate was playing along and right at the end told me it was a really hard boss fight right as I activated it. Luckily a few level 200+ turned up and carried me through it. Despite this I was still mashed into a fine red most a few times but it was good fun. Got my first 3 star there too. A fucking pipe pistol. A really shit pipe pistol
---
Omg, I‚Äôm so right there with you. I hate all of these NPCs! They‚Äôre annoying. They‚Äôre noisy. And they‚Äôre taking over the Appalachia I put blood, sweat, and tears in for the last YEAR for!
---
I don‚Äôt know if you k ow but if I change the skin in the strangler heart armor do the vines disappear?
---
I sold legendaries n this adds up easily. I am 724 caps short to hot max cap as of today
---
Nope. 
---
Just impale 10,000 of my enemy.
---
I'm sorry if I came off that way. I truly do enjoy everyone in the game, new people or not.
---
Indeed. Putting more effort finding outfits than legendary guns is not a good signal
---
I don‚Äôt know I might have to try that out
---
Just wanted to know because I think some of the skins would look cool with the vines and stuff
---
Do the event Uranium Fever, just don't try to kill the mole miners just tag them with a lowly pipe pistol and let the higher level players finish them off.  Whitespring stations is close by and you can sell the weapons to the robot vendor.  Don't try to collect anything while the event is on going.  Collect the loot when it is over because you will be overloaded.
---
Dude, I'm old school. Original mmos were like "your names Bob, you live in bobville, your job is to kill wild life...and other bobs...now get to it!" I wish I could have played before the update.
---
Downvote because ultimately this post is off-putting for new players. If you don't like new players you can more easily ignore then then berate them on Reddit.
---
I'd say it will still work with players
---
Or just get a trusted friend on a private server and nuke him once he shows up
---
Started playing fo76 yesterday, my first attempt I done fuse first and got the error, logged out tried again same method, still error.
---
Seen it suggested on here that it will work, although they said it took them 5 tries logging in and out.
---
I'll give it another go tomorrow.
---
Are players going to care that a lowbie is with them?
---
It would have been nice if they gave Fallout 1st folks the ability to run their private server pre-Wastelanders, but I recognize it‚Äôs an MMO, that‚Äôs... not happening.
---
R u on ps4, xbox or PC cause I'm on ps4 looking for a fixer plan
---
Exactly. Except for the script fodder that plagues my inventory toward the end of the day- like you ‚Äúcould‚Äù buy them but you wouldn‚Äôt want to for the price that im essentially equating to script that I would get tomorrow. (40script being like 1000 caps or so)
---
Jealous. I had one successful, good run of the event. Then the second time I tried it I got solo spawned in without the load out to handle it so I just quit. And then today I went to it, it was just me &amp; two lower levels (30 &amp; a 66 or something), which fine, whatever, I had a ton of stims on me &amp; was down to do some carrying as long as they were helping do some damage. They wouldn‚Äôt jump down the shaft. Both of them just stood around presumably hoping I‚Äôd go down and do all the work for them. So I jumped down and got myself some screws and left. Really hoping I get to do another successful run eventually.
---
Actually theres ruffle 500k people playing at one time, badcompanyasarg did a video on working out the average so seems pretty alive to me
---
I spent most of my time in the private server. Mainly because if im close to someone that's really high level their leveled mobs destroy me.
---
Search random tool boxes
---
Find a new game. Come back in a few months or a year and there might be some new content.
---
I‚Äôve had my camp on the spot at the edge of crater since I was a lev 30 and am 190 now...needless to say I have a lot of ore! Great post! üëç
---
As it should be, cause you‚Äôre in places you ain‚Äôt supposed to be.
---
Next patch is going to ‚Äúfix‚Äù that. But alas, we carry on.
---
I've been remodeling my camps. Removing double walls, changing the roof pitch, and deleting some wallpaper. Now comes redecorating. Later I'll restock the vending machines. No quests but sometimes I'll go shopping at camps and stations. Food always comes to the camp. A whole different game.
---
The scam angle is sad. 30k (or whatever big numbers they're priced at) can be a lot, particularly if you're low/mid-level
---
They can be difficult to find but toolboxes are the best...too bad you‚Äôre on ps and no Xb I have a few extra
---
Lol you shoulda kept them bethesa stopped caring a few months ago. They cant beat the dupers and they gave up. Duping has always been and always will be a part of this game.
---
have you not already picked it up? check your tinkers bench
---
I was under the impression that only the visual day\night cycle was changed but the actual cycle, where nocturnal takes effect, remained unchanged?
---
I'll give you 1300 caps for it
---
/s
---
Chow Dow?
---
A man's gotta have a code.
---
You gotta find it randomly, if you‚Äôre trying to start the quest look at tourist traps, if you just need a broken pro snap , sometimes there‚Äôs one at the opossum camp near the top of the map, sometimes one of the bots sells one in whitesprings
---
i'm lv 300 and i can't even kill the grafton monster near poseidon power plant with my lv27 character lmao! i can't wait to lv up to 50 so i can use some legendary shits that i don't use in my main and mutations xd
---
I'm 20 hours in, and and avid builder.
---
Thank fuck I trawled Reddit at 0120 hrs before bed
---
Objectively this game has 101 problems and it seems everytime bethesda try to fix something they break something else. But despite all of its flaws, and Jesus there's a lot, it's still a very fun game. When everything works (or at least mostly works) it really comes together. Hope you enjoy man :]
---
I adore this.
---
I also try and load up overseers caches, most newbies will undoubtedly come across them if they're following the overseer questlines.
---
That‚Äôs awesome
---
I used to just drop stuff at the door to vault 76, but from reading the comments on this thread I might just switch to the suitcases at train stations.
---
I‚Äôve had a lot of bad runs too like killing myself on accident because I‚Äôd blow myself up with my gauss shotgun and then spawning outside the mine or joining an event and I‚Äôm all alone I havn‚Äôt seen him fall threw the floor or anything like that yet but those last runs were awesome the teamwork was key to making it a breeze
---
I‚Äôm not sure that works. Players can access occupied terminals still, as it brings it up in their Pipboy.
---
100% agree on the vegetable starch thing, keep a little garden with corn, mutfruit and tato as well as a few water purifiers and you'll never be needing to scavenge for adhesive again
---
Suitcases / cash registers at train stations / vendors.
---
Cash register at the purveyor.
---
Mailbox at Foundation.
---
Those are the ones that I use.
---
me and my friend just speak spanish in a building team i bet people mute us bc no one complain or leave while we are just talking about our day lol 
---
i hope we can have some private teams to enjoy the benefits with in a closed group so we don't annoy people
---
Thanks! I've moved camps around that area a bunch. I had one on the main lake there nearest to the Elevator, then moved to the cliff above it in a few different places, and now I've got another spot behind Huntersville. It's like my holy grail spot, aluminum, lead, iron, and water all within a quick walk!
---
I‚Äôm going to be on in about an hour. Mack012166. I‚Äôll give you 10k caps. It will help me out a lot. I have some sales to make and I‚Äôve got no cap room.
---
What‚Äôs that got to do with fallout76
---
I‚Äôve done acp multiple times with it, nothing bad happened
---
What difference does reddit karma make in fallout?
---
That sounds like the perfect spot!
---
Bubye
---
First off, games that are a job, are not good. It's been over a year since I deleted Destiny 2 despite loving every pvp map and hard lining that game.
---
No regrets.
---
Secondly this is a game to be enjoyed at your leisure. It's not about min maxing, like borderlands or something like that, just do what you want to do and hang out at Appalahia for a while.
---
Over time you will get the best armour in the game, people complain about scrip limits all the time, but you can dip in and out everyday and have fun. Hell you can get the legendary run done with only an hour each day.
---
This game is hugely rewarding, and offers so much. Please don't give up.
---
When you think about it, I think Bethesda went a bit crazy with the difficulty of this event considering the rewards and the fact not many people turn up to it.
---
I mean the dude one shots you and then camps at the nearest pylon where you spawn to one shot you again and you get less the 10 minutes to kill him and nobody activates the pylons. 
---
Seriously Bethesda? At least give the owner of the keycard a chance and allow him to determine when to start it.
---
Not sure about that, but it does make some of them try and lowball others.
---
I never did care if a low level joined a event and my main character is 287.  Most of the people playing this game are helpful.
---
You can‚Äôt drop em I‚Äôm pretty sure
---
Wait, meat week is coming back?
---
the buzzy thing is Mothman im guessing. hes more cute than scary tbh, especially the Wise Mothman from the lighthouse event
---
No I don‚Äôt have the camera option
---
Only 45.5 million leather away according to the site right now. 129.5 million donations, That's actually quite impressive and way closer than I expected we'd get.
---
I never did care if a low level joined a event and my main character is 287. Most of the people playing this game are helpful.
---
The problem begins when various players use teslas. It usually causes a severe framerate
---
as long as we donate enough to the BOS event
---
Jesus they really could‚Äôve made these quests less tedious
---
I'm thinking with only a 16 player game would make it possible to have both modes.  
---
  
---
The real problem there though is that EXP is gained based on time survived. It should be solely on downs, kills, revives, nukes launched, even creatures killed, etc.
---
all this drama over a comment that nobody actually care's about
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
"bubye"
---
Its really cool that you can enjoy fallout with your dad! Right on!
---
Considering how many gauss mini's I've made only to get nothing but shit I switched to making the SS armor. First right leg i made was bloodied, weapon weight reduction and rad resist. Like it couldn't have been that generous 50 modules ago on my gauss mini ffs.
---
Dude that's sick wish I had that talent
---
If you want fast paced tank action you NEED that bloodied / junkies , swing speed unarmed build . My guy has as much damage resistance as a power armour build plus the effects of dodgy and serendipity and all the buffs. Hit like a truck feel like a tank . Stand hopeless as you watch the scorched beasts never landing. 
---
BUT!! wait until next patch in a week to see if the build gets destroyed or not . I dont play on the pts but I heard spooky things we could be hit the hardest as we stack so much multipliers.
---
The community kept the game alive. The company wise is killing the game with plenty of bugs n glitches and limits.
---
I like NW a lot. I would be happy with just about anything new at this point. Nw has been sorely neglected for the past year.
---
That‚Äôs crazy right before I got my only sentinel piece I crafted two nocturnal ones I almost didn‚Äôt try the last time but so happy I did and got the one I wanted but it‚Äôs been slow every since
---
Are there worthwhile items in the treasures?  
---
I only ever get mid to low tier loot.
---
Nope just emotes and Mic.
---
Well said friend. Have my first ever ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to thank‚Äù award
---
Its funny his default bubye when he has nothing relevant
---
I'd prefer not being constrained to only half of the map for decent xp and level appropriate legendaries.
---
Reminds me of the people who would beg for gold outside of common trading areas in an MMO.
---
I agree. I tried to launch a nuke solo 2x and got devastated. I jumped on good old fo76 subreddit and asked "going for my first nuke launch and getting me ass handed to me. Does anyone feel like joining me to help out?". Within 2 minutes I had 3 people jump on with a "hell yeah, let's go!" 
---
THAT is what I love about this community.
---
you may have to find one the hard way then. find where the body can spawn and server hop.
---
My opinion: scrip
---
It's pretty good. Not as good as if you were right next to the Monorail, but it's pretty good. It's taking me a bit to get the route down to find the nodes that are there. I'm having to rely on some weird landmarks to find them. I like learning what the resources are around where I'm camping, then when I move, I can always go back to those spots and get things fast.
---
I don't understand why everyone wants the masks. Most of them look so ugly and unappealing. I understand that they are rare, but really? Rare doesn't mean cool.
---
Camp Mcclintock has a crap ton of battered clipboards. That's probably one of the best places.
---
[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic)
---
Have you found either of the 2 x dead NPCs who start the quest? They will have a broken porsnap in their inventory as well as trigger the quest. Phillipi Cemetry is a good place to try, even if you server hop for it. The corpse spawns near the road in front of the graves so its easy to spot (there will be lowish lvl mongrel dogs)
---
Lol. Pretty sure I teamed up with you before. Congrats.
---
Until missile launchers get some kind of buff, there are all automatic scrip in my book.
---
Im too lazy to make it myself and I dont need caps for anything else
---
[removed]
---
Maybe when they fix the robots respawning every time a player joins.  
---
Nothing like bending over to pick up a radkelp only to have the Sentry bot blast a thousand rounds up your ass.
---
Just try to enjoy the game and worry about building later
---
Sugar Grove I believe has multiple clipboards that you can scrap for springs.
---
You *can* somewhat control the direction in which you're running.
---
Allegedly the 15th
---
Definitely scrip.  90% weight good.  50% VATS on a heavy, wasted.  Assassin's, worthless.
---
It's butt-hurt Bethesda haters.
---
I dont think FO1st stuff like the Bogwalker Outfit typically come back around but the normal atom shop stuff usually does eventually, some more frequently than others. Theres no real pattern to any of it though.
---
Im waiting for the Mr Pebbles Backpack still.
---
from what I've seen with the savage divide maps so far, raider-t51b power armor piece plans. weapon, armor, and mod plans that you'd normally have to get from npc vendors. a disappointing amount of ammo (relative to a single map), but if you don't mind moving your camp, or if it's one of the maps with scrapping workbenches nearby, a pretty okay amount of scrap and all the weapon/armor mod plans from scrapping them.
---
Standout drops are stuff like the HMG plan, cryolator plan, marine wetsuit plan. Hell I've seen a road leathers plan.
---
For plans, they're great if you haven't bought everything from npc vendors. For anything else they're whatever. That said, I've only touched savage divide so far.
---
She's a raider. They're all fucked in the head.
---
It‚Äôs mostly about your perks tbh. I can one shot level 50 deathclaws with a non legendary pipe bolt action rifle
---
On my main i cant get into power armour without shooting up to 700+ carry weight so basically cant use it , and on my secondary I have about 10 pounds to spare . I honestly don't know how these PA people do it,  I just love having a big bag of tricks and its just not as easy with it on.
---
Yeah, mum is correct   sugar Grove, a lot of clipboards.
---
It's a vats issue more than the weapon methinks.
---
Lol
---
Bloodied
---
During meat week I put on a Chally outfit and would visit random low level players, make a gift emote, and drop them a loot bag with a bunch of extra stims, plans, and a few leftover christmas gifts. I‚Äôd say ‚ÄúMOOOO! You have been visited by the MEAT WEEK SANTA COW. Happy Meat Week!‚Äù 
---
I literally had to stop after a few days because I was getting players who were started following me around, constantly messaging me for more gifts, asking me to give their friends gifts, asking me for more aid and free ammo....
---
I got so annoyed after a few days I just stopped all the gift giving and went back to playing the game, lol.
---
I really love seeing the creativity in this game. Very well done, thanks for sharing.
---
So you're looking for help with the event?  
---
What platform?
---
Yeah that seems to be the consesus. Just some weapons are worse than others with it.
---
Lever action cos they look cool AF
---
also you can do some sick damage with the right perks
---
Only time a low level player has approached me (my camp is very remote) he simply asked where he could find fiber optics, so I pointed him to the AVR medical centre (I remember finding a few microscopes there). After that he just thanked me and walked off.
---
I‚Äôm currently in the process of upgrading my current legendary sniper. The damage it‚Äôll do will be 109 but VATS do 50% more damage
---
I'm guessing Fortnite.
---
Huh?
---
Currently I have my non auto gun perks maxed out but that‚Äôs about it, is there anything else I need to be looking at for a sniper and a fixer?
---
my friend said it was shit. he didn't even get to flatwoods. He did try it again a few months ago and got to like 25 and loved it. 
---
There was a 1\* review on amazon from someone who had watched their friend play it. 
---
One review quite clearly didn't get past level 7 with the things they were saying.
---
MODUS definitely isn't at his prime, though I don't know if I'd say his condition is getting worse. If I'm to be honest, I wish we could get rid of him. I'm Enclave for life but there's a way to be Enclave and not be a moustache-twirling villain. Garza's faction during the schism proved that - she may not have been "born" Enclave but plenty of folks from inside the bunker did side with her all the same.
---
Unless you're on a Radeon RX5700.
---
Its my go to spot. Look on the floor because thats where a lot are and they can be hard to spot amongst the other debris.
---
Best part is that reddit allows comment editing. So, much like, Bethesda, you can change the date as many times as you want. üòä
---
Legends, I hope to see you out there.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Why so little? Do you have rifleman, master, expert?
---
Also need to max your sneak damage perks. 
---
Bloody mess as well.
---
Same here. Fireproof cannibalz, fried or die.
---
You don't make caps at such low level, save every penny you got.
---
No
---
Yes! This!
---
Ah well, I glanced over the message part. That's a horrible thing to have on consoles. Glad I just have to deal with mouth breathers and noise blasters.
---
Yeah I'll wait for someone to launch a nuke then if a bunch of people show up to the queen/colossus then I will use a key card
---
What do you mean so little? Also I‚Äôve maxed out them perks besides sneak damage
---
Yeah after all this time I finally made a bloodied pistol build.   
---
Wish I had done it sooner. Faster Fire on the 10mm is fugging sweet.
---
Dragon can‚Äôt drop as legendary at all.
---
combat shotguns are automatically in the loot pool for drops though. There's only 5-6 weapons you need to know the plans of to get drops. Fixer, tenderizer, sheepsquatch staff/club, bear arm.. i'm missing something. I think.
---
Lot of low levels begging for shit are the alts of those with level 5000 who are just being cunts.  Don't get bewitched.
---
I'm running a highly mobile sprinting unarmed build, flavored as an animalistic brawler, and it's a lot of fun. They're also a cannibal running with a full array of mutations to complete that "no longer human" feel.
---
It's so satisfying to slam into an enemy with a sprinting power attack and just destroy them, then keep move on to the next one.
---
Hey mate it most likely gonna be fixed when the next patch comes out which is 15th sep I think
---
I wish they would take out junk drop on death completely. It can obviously be done since you don't drop during events. They should make it that we lose a few caps instead or something. 
---
I make sure I store all my junk now when I'm about to do something a little dangerous. Mostly because I hate spawning a g'zillion miles away &amp; have to trek all the way back to collect 2 steel and 1 wood because I can't remember if I had something valuable, like my precious teddy bears ü§™
---
Id possibly use the syringer more if I could actually manage to unlock the mods that already exist in game. I unlocked 2 x early on in this character and havent unlocked another since despite scrapping heaps. Even crafted some to scrap but decided it was a waste of resources
---
Some fresh out of the vault noob, whose achievements I checked to ensure they were a noob, wanted some of my 3* armor. If it was anything below Combat I wouldve given it but it was Marine, so I said nope. Just because someone is high level doesn't entail that they're wealthy enough to pass out legendaries.
---
When I was still a wee lad on my first character a black powder rifle was a life saver. Stupid low DPS but most standard trash, sneak hit to the head, it's going down. I still have one or two legacy legendary on a mule. As mentioned they don't drop as legendary any more for some silly reason, but it is possible to get a 1* from a vending machine at Watoga High School I've read.
---
i use a boomstick tbh 
---
but sneaking perks for sneaky sneaks
---
Huh....even I am not creative enough to make something like that.
---
Honestly, it is one of the few immersive elements the game has. Annoying, sure, but I do appreciate that fog + sun = hard time hitting opponents. Too bad it doesn‚Äôt work both ways, but sneak/stealth is unrealistically OP in the game as it is.
---
When the game first came out, I was frequently wowed by so many of the visuals and the lighting in particular. I‚Äôm on XBOX and I felt like I was looking at a game on PC. When more players started joining and a couple optimization updates to deal with lag went through, it felt to me like a bit of that was sacrificed, but the atmosphere is still nicely done. I still only dip into the Ash Heap on brief excursions because the environment there feels more oppressive than the zones you may run into much higher level enemies. The first time stepping into the burning mine... whew.
---
When Survival Mode first started, I actually was really loving a lot of the environments. Sneaking my way through the Mire, taking advantage of the darkness to avoid other players rather than risking the exposure of much of the Savage Divide or Toxic Valley... makes you focus on the surroundings in a different way than when you can just blast your way through everything without worry.
---
All masks do.
---
I assume this was inspired by Hallgr√≠mskirkja, the famous church in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland?
---
Outstanding, be proud!!!
---
Yup, this glitch has happened so many times with me. I think the bug is linked to certain locations. When I built a camp next to Philippie battlefield cemetery, this bug could occur non-stop everytime a merchant came over.
---
Man I wish camp interiors that were completely sealed off where naturally alot darker.
---
Thanks, it just hurts my eyes to look at it
---
Theyre still in game as an uncommon/rarish drop from enemies but they arent in the legendary loot table anymore
---
Ok thanks
---
Where did you get fortnite from?
---
Yea it does this all the time when log in the first time for the day.
---
The game is fucking insane.
---
Never seen that tbh
---
Yh ik I own the bunker too was my main base for a while untill I placed more items in and realised it was floating
---
I would love a radaway syringer to run around shooting people with (it could also do damage to ghouls)
---
Well, those three hundred mini-nukes might be in your inventory...
---
Did you check to see if your character weighs 3 tons?
---
PSA is code for bitching when you make a post this long
---
I heard that, but can promise you after months of hunting rares, I had zero combat shotguns.  Since getting the plan I am getting 3 a day or so.
---
I ended up buying shotguns from other players from level 45 to 180ish.  Since getting the plan I am now selling them.  Either worst luck ever, or it could be true.
---
Seriously, it was a buzz kill as I NEVER got combat shotguns outside occasional scripts.  Now I am flush in a week of getting plan.
---
Same for nukes.  Don't let griefers get in the way of letting you choose where to drop the nuke because you weren't fast enough to switch from one terminal to another
---
The Crane's treasure quest gives an anti armor 50 vat crit hunting rifle. I can get mine to land 1k shots on most bosses for 30% or so of the time. This character is speced for nuclear winter as opposed to adventure so IMO it should hit harder for you. That 1k isn't paper damage but numbers on crits.
---
OP is entitled as fuck
---
Abandoned Bogtown, PD is full of handcuffs and Drop into the hole in the roof of the tall building by the workshops to get lots of typewriters and clipboards.
---
Mountainside Bed and Breakfast, has several Yao Guai with 7 springs each.  Dolly Sods has 2.
---
Sugar Grove, many fans/clipboards/etc.  Lots of screws and springs.
---
Ohio River Adventures has 15+ life preservers
---
Several life preservers can be found at the Hotel on the north side of Flatwoods in a crate near the pool.
---
The Charleston Herald Office has a lot of typewriters.
---
The Charleston DMV also has some typewriters.
---
Obviously, I was able to run around fine I immediately went to check my inventory to see if I had them. Not a single one was there as the 40k turned to dust
---
Any Mothman not Wise is a False Idol, who are evil and corruptible to where even the heretics start fighting them. Good on you for ridding Appalachia of that affront to the Wise One.
---
I even restarted my game after a minute to see if they would suddenly load in but nope
---
That might be the sniper I‚Äôm using atm tbh, I‚Äôve had it ages and never upgraded it as I thought I couldn‚Äôt
---
This is very useful at lower levels, absolutely. I swear by it for all my characters.
---
Assassins still works for pvp.
---
If its ever removed vanguard becomes the new meta.
---
This google doc is something else, man. Wow. Good stuff here.
---
The lighting isn‚Äôt 12 hours but the effect is. So you‚Äôre commonly getting the Nocturnal effect without actually knowing it. So, unless you have a timer or something to actually check
---
I thought it was part of the wendingo stuff (that was a huge draw for me)
---
I'll craft and fully mod guns and armour for friends.
---
I'll drop excess junk for friends
---
Food is pretty much the only thing I'll drop for randoms
---
I managed to get where I am having only recieved 4 guns (only 1 was level 50)and a level 35 excavator power armour set (from friends who I paid back with legendaries, junk, food ect)
---
New Vegas style! 
---
But Bethesda will find a way to monetize it üòÖ
---
I‚Äôm changing it to .50 ammo because it gives me 109 damage
---
Oof, the thing that makes it more clear is with large objects
---
In the beginning a tse dragon was a 1 shot killing machine. Id kill that behemoth everyday with it. Now not so much. They nerfed the explosive and dragons cant be legendary anymore. So a legendary dragon is legacy. The bp items are still useful for some situations but the trade off isnt worth it.
---
It‚Äôs high level gatekeeping. It‚Äôs not hard to just play the game and ignore toxic/annoying players. The tools are there to help players avoid them.
---
Yes
---
I only ever found two. Sold one and kept one for collection purposes. 
---
during meat week i was having to restock every hour as my camp is near one of the cuts events. It was chaos. I had to restock vendors while vendor hopping to spend caps while also doing the events.
---
Thank you!
---
Gatekeeping
---
3, 14, 9, 1, 4, 15, 10  
---
This allows for three of the best builds.  [Automatic rifles](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3e914fa&amp;nw=p1p7p3pca8aal4), [Gauss Shotgun](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3e914fa&amp;nw=s4p2p9i2a8aal4), and [Nuke run](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3e914fa&amp;nw=p7pce5i0a8aal4).
---
Not at level 25, I wouldn‚Äôt think. It‚Äôs also a good source of legendaries if you can tag the ‚Äúmanagement personnel‚Äù before they die.
---
Thank you for this post. 
---
The legendary run grind has definitely killed my role-play groove. I'm too worried about hitting all my dalies, and forget to stop and smell the flowers (or swim in pools, as it were)....
---
Pictures of the pool?
---
I always find it funny that people price stuff for 30k, it's so unlikely someone will have 30k coming to your camp because of fast trafel expenses. Unless they are on your team, don't travel anywhere else, and just happen to come to your camp with 30k exactly, it will never happen.
---
Chinese stealth armour
---
Makes me proud that I have a 2 Shot Dragon from way back when it was part of the loot. I even remember who dropped it, The Queen dropped The Dragon for me and that was the best drop I've ever gotten, aside from a lvl 40 Bloody Explosive shotgun that I sold for 12k
---
&gt; **Pipe is life! But seriously what is the pipe?** 
---
You said it yourself, life.
---
Life
---
You can still use it and activate the event. The terminal just pulls up through your pipboy
---
I remember a few patches back they increased the day light but honestly I have no idea if that effected nocturnal or if it was more a visual tweak. Even so I‚Äôm fairly sure it‚Äôs only at max damage for a short amount of time.
---
Also I edited my doesn‚Äôt in my original comment to does.
---
Some people collect weird and shitty cosmetic items over there solely because they're limited-time items. At least, that's my assumption, as someone who has purchased cosmetics in other games solely for that reason.
---
You‚Äôre probably right I‚Äôve never tried...I accidentally scrapped mine once and have just keep a few extra since
---
Nah, I tried to do that yesterday, pretty sure that only works on NW
---
Grab a card and head back in. One the silo is prepped it should stay that way long enough for you to launch. Your path should be fairly clear if you killed the bots and turrets.
---
I was a stealth sniper for my first hundred levels.  A buddy told me to try commando, so i did...been commando ever since, truly amazing...lvl 221 right now.  I maxed out archery perk cards as well( if i get a good weapon eithe rifle or bow. Ill switch to check it).  My current is a Vats Stealth Bloodied Commando and i slay everything but sbq and earl.  I know you dont want to change, but commando will save your life.
---
400 levels means literally nothing
---
Give it a shot. Both Fallout 4 and 76 are exceptional exploration games and 76 may be even better than 4 in this regard. It's a little tough at first because you literally don't have a weapon, but take your time and enjoy.
---
Pipe is the feeling you get when imagining Fallout76 as a bug free game with all the cosmetics that you could ever dream of all bottled into delicious cherry flavored mist.
---
Sounds just like the brotherhood I remember
---
Added you
---
Yeah, its definitely a good idea to have a build in mind when leveling up your character. Saves you the hassle of having to "fix" your character at later levels.
---
Both of my friends went in without having a real idea of what weapon or playstyle they wanted and had to spend a good amount of level ups moving points and taking the appropriate cards, which kinda sucked for them.
---
You can't post this. It is considered "witch hunting". We have no way of knowing if you're being truthful or just looking to hurt someone.
---
Awesome!  You on PC?
---
Mg42 needs a sight, so does the 50 cal, and tbch any new weapon needs more mods.
---
Suppressor for the revolvers, sights for the smg, suppressors for the DB, more bow mods, they all need mods
---
Winter is supposed to bring instanced camps which will have instanced interiors, that should be at least double to quadruple the camp budget we have now.
---
Troubleshooter's armor and weapons are great for the silo.  I used to use a Troubleshooters Combat Knife with the stealth blade when I was around your level, and I could pretty much sneak up on anything there and down it easily.  If you don't have any decent troubleshooter's weapons, Vampire's also holds its own.  A simple set of 1\* troubleshooter's mixed and matched is still fine.  Works well at Encryptid too.  You might consider shadowing your armor if you wan't better stealth inside the silo.  Disable the turrets when you first enter the silo at the terminal on the left of the first doorway.  You'll need to hack it.
---
Power armor isn't stealthy, so I didn't mention it since you said you wanted to stay stealthy.
---
Not sure what your build is, so I can only recommend that you eat hp boosting food/chems such as scorchbeast steaks/psychobuff/etc.  Keep your stims on speed dial until you get the hang of the silo.  If you have any Stealth Boys, they can also be helpful.
---
Later, as you progress you can slide back into your normal armor and gear since you won't be struggling nearly so much as you gain experience.
---
I use the .50 mod on mine as well for sure. I also use adrenal reactions mutation and below 20% health, 4 leaf clover and better crits and eagle eyes mutation. Those aren't necessary to make it useful but they help max the damage IMO.
---
I dont even k kw what mods it currently has.
---
A debuff would help, rage mode where the enemy agros you only would help for tanks, frenzy mode if its. Ot already in game. Etc.
---
On PS4 but at Max caps. Until I find something worth buying I'm gonna held em thanks.
---
Max caps. Max scrip. Massive bullion. These ceilings are bullshit.
---
The missile launcher sucks
---
I've stopped taking trade invites from random players for this reason. They are always so greedy. The moment I accept I see a "requested" next to all of my legacies and god rolls. No, I'm not selling them for some caps I can get easily myself, go annoy someone else. One time some dude turned on his mic and harassed me for not selling any of my weapons to him.
---
Every time I‚Äôve been a low level a kind stranger has dropped a legendary or so for me and so on days when I‚Äôve been on all day and I‚Äôve got tonnes of legendaries I‚Äôll keep the train going and drop them and even some useful junk if they need it
---
That being said I‚Äôve always refused to help people with their quests because the whole fun of it for me was doing it all myself like in the past games, I‚Äôll play with my friends when they get the game but it‚Äôs a much better experience when you know the person well rather than being carried by some stranger you begged rather than waiting a while to get better kit and skill
---
Good idea actually. Gives you a gauge of the level of gear and talent around.
---
You post in the free karma sub... lol
---
They post in the free karma sub. They just want karma.
---
Wait, so you were rolling for SS gear. You should have bought modules and then created them. Then they will all be 3 star.
---
Man... Your dad is cool.
---
I'll allow it.
---
You actually buy stims?
---
I‚Äôve never used mutations before, it‚Äôs something I should learn about
---
I buy fuel, 2mm, and cryo cells if they're cheap, because they can be pretty expensive to craft in bulk.  36 fuel takes like 10 acid or something like that.
---
But whose going to want to check out other peoples camps if they know they‚Äôll have to sit in a loading screen. I always like the smoothness of just wandering upon someone‚Äôs camp in the woods and seeing all the cool stuff they had and then run and jump off roof to continue on my journey across the wasteland. It‚Äôll just feel like a hassle. Lol
---
Stealth is key. If they can‚Äôt see you, they can‚Äôt kill you. Not sure what you have in agility but you should be near 15. Covert ops with a sniper is devastating with head shots. The lever action should be fine. What are the rolls on it?
---
Didnt know about any of that ü§Æ
---
I peed.
---
Was this on PS4 by chance?
---
Oh, ok.
---
&gt;the wastelanders would be looking to trade for the essentials, food, water, ammo. not beryllium agitators, reflex compacitors and haptic drives.
---
Isn't that on the wastelanders then? This almost supports the whole idea of not handing this stuff out willy-nilly
---
I don't know if it was fixed, but there was a bug where players who die cannot respawn inside the event. 
---
Last night I was on with some level 400s who disappeared during the fight, and I doubt they got scared off, but they may have been downed and couldn't get back. I assumed they got booted unintentionally.
---
How else do I keep from dying?
---
Yeah normally I agree however ever time I‚Äôve joined I‚Äôve been stuck with a bunch of level 20s, or people who don‚Äôt focus on earl and just kill mobs the whole time
---
"This is One Dog... hoooowwwll, fighting the good fight in the Capital Wasteland."
---
&gt; Rare doesn't mean cool.
---
Status. Imagined, yes, but that‚Äôs basically it. Like ugly 500 dollar sneakers.
---
put vendors inside and problem solved?
---
Yup, some people are just blowhards.
---
Bro YES!  THIS!!!   I remember once I had a public events team and this dude joins and spend the next 10 mins with a hot mic hollering at Michelle (wife?¬ø) and yelling at his kids.  I wasn‚Äôt on mic so I took the liberty to kick him.   30 mins later he pops right back into my group STILL yelling at his family.  Like bro you are a grown ass man and there is no excuse not to know how to use your mic.  Same goes for the 12 year old that joined and screamed in mic for us to stop what we were doing and come help him.
---
I need to take some but my username is watsonxo on PC if you‚Äôd prefer to take a leisurely dip
---
It's going to be available tomorrow if you have fallout 1st.
---
Yes! Under watsonxo
---
Oh hell. I didn't know about that. It's not like Bethesda games to have bugs. üòÉ
---
Doubt it'll be fixed with the next patch.
---
Monghole
---
Ugh. That sucks. Although I would love someone to keep those damn wendigos away from me while I focus on the big guy...just not alone. He is a bullet sponge.
---
2* and 3* legendary dragons are legacy. You can still get a 1* dragon from the monster mash vending machine.
---
I like to share bodyguards, free 15 or so damage and energy resist for everyone on the team is just nice, especially for my bloodied buddies who need every bit they can get!
---
Exactly! Not only that the level 20s got mad saying I‚Äôm not doing enough damage to him. Mind you they have been hiding behind me the entire time
---
Boomer
---
2* and 3* legendary dragons no longer drop, but you can still get a 1* dragon from the monster mash vending machine.
---
I have multiple people proof with people on here and everywhere
---
Something to vent gas from mines? Don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs just life.
---
I‚Äôve not seen one for ages.
---
Mothman praise you!
---
Craft healing salves. Super easy to find components and keep you alive.
---
Swell purified water.
---
At level 25 turn your stims in to diluted stims.
---
Eat food and drink water for healing.
---
The only way to get the actual complete drop list would be to datamine it. Might do to check if that has been done too.
---
Well that still isn‚Äôt very  appealing is it?
---
I agree, they should have more mods.  IDC much about a bipod, but I'd like to see the heavies get some receiver options like the rifles have.  Perforating/Quick/Piercing/scorched/blah blah. And like you mentioned, sights.  The gunner sight is crap.
---
Same thing for mags, give some low capacity quick reload ones, some slower loading but larger capacity ones etc. 
---
The Gauss Mini has several barrels.  Maybe some different barrels for other heavy guns would be nice.
---
I'm not even a heavy build, but I do think these are lacking.
---
It is inside right now but if they did this, doesn‚Äôt that mean we will need more generators as well? And how do you instance a building if the outside of it can easily be moved around? Like are the whole camps going to be instanced then? Meaning we if the building is instanced then you‚Äôll need generators inside and out, as well as wherever your store is. Feel like the easiest fix would be just to increase both
---
I sold a bloodied dragon in my vendor for 500 caps, a week later I found out it was legacy
---
I was thinking the same thing when wastelanders came out. There's so much love for mothman, and a ton of Cultist themed cosmetics, so it's a little odd they're automatically hostile.
---
Doing the faction dailies (crater, foundation, and Davenport) will net you 9x (3x each), and then doing public events will get you more, based on its difficulty. Radiation Rumble can get you 4x more, and Uranium Fever is 2x I think?
---
This. Sneak on through. Picklock the reactor room door on the left side as you enter, then hack the next terminal to move on. Keep sneaking, fight only what's necessary.
---
Newbies usually put it up at default value or higher though. I'm not paying 8 per 2mm lol.
---
No actually regular mothmen are classed as allied with the cultists so the will fight side by side
---
There is also a chance a mothman with spawn in a cultist camp however they‚Äôre either bugged or purposefully invulnerable and seem to have no AI when they do spawn there
---
You can loot tonnes of prewar food and stims for free, I've rarely ever had to buy either
---
IIRC sniffing it gives you some sort of hp buff for a short period, thus pipe is "Life"... and usually temporary blindness.
---
Where?
---
I‚Äôll give you something worth more than the quad fixer for the quad fixer if you‚Äôre on xbox
---
Seems simply explanatory to me. Is it truely against the rules to post names about garbage people with trash ethics?.
---
This. Troubleshooters weapons and armor.
---
No, xbox
---
I second this, ran bloodied sniper then commando which is way more fun,  now after a beautiful bloodied gauss mini drop from earl I‚Äôm running heavy and can melt practically everything
---
Sorry but I'm on PS4.
---
Looks like we still need 50m and tomorrow is the last day.
---
Didn't think such a superiority complex regarding a videogame existed
---
I think I saw someone mention about placing a rug down first helped them.
---
It would bring already struggling servers to their knees if they just upped the budget willy nilly.  Anyone who has been on a pub server during fashnacht knows that the servers are literally about to crash at any moment with the extra load.  
---
They want to instance camp interiors so that the budget can be increased without the ill side effects.  I'm OK with waiting a bit longer if that fixes the problem.  I want a bigger budget as much as anyone, but not at the expense of even the slightest additional server instability.  I've failed enough events right at the end just because the server decided to take a dump.  I hope Bethesda is really trying to clean up this mess and make things smoother and more reliable.
---
*Bethesda: oh lets cut down treasury note availability so it matches bullion caps.
---
God dam someone pin this message PLEASE
---
I‚Äôll stop by tomorrow!
---
Don't be a stealth sniper build.
---
If you're not going to switch your build itself, at the very least switch the weapon. DPS is king, so go with a suitable combat rifle, fixer or handmade rifle over something so slow and with such low ammo capacity as the lever action.
---
AFAIK the Forest still had a level cap. Some will
---
be capped at 50, less or more, depending on the type of enemies and the area.
---
All of the watch towers at the top you can interact with the railing or something in one corner at the top to "survey the area" which reveals locations nearby. Once per tower.
---
I just found out about this and im double your level.
---
If you're over level 32 get starched genes, it lets you keep them when managing rads. If you get the genes and mutations don't ever take off starched genes, it can make for expensive mistakes. Adrenal reactions takes off of max health but increases damage done at low health. Eagle eyes ups crit damage and perception. Speed demon and marsupial are also indispensable IMO.
---
Watch some video by PTS players. I promise you‚Äôll be fine.
---
Ive heard it's really buggy on public servers, i want to do the event but I've been playing 76 since the days of the immortal scorchbeast queen and I remember dumping thousands of rounds into a boss and getting zipshit. I'm hoping this next patch fixes it before I go diving in
---
Lower the limit of people per server?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsXcxBb2IXc&amp;t=3s
---
With the scrounger, pharma farma and can do perks in luck you'll be able to get food from bins, extra medical supplies from any medkit and extra ammo from ammo boxes
---
Oh damn no wonder i stims where not registering when fighting the Queen with a PlasGat. Thanks for the info!
---
Yeah. That's fair. I know for a fact whenI someone brings a tesla rifle, the FPS drops like a rock.
---
Wait so you‚Äôre telling me my tp ain‚Äôt worth 6900 caps??
---
1. Aside from new weapons like the fixer where it's necessary to know the plan to get the legendary, the rest is confirmation bias. It doesn't drop more because you know the plan. It's either in the loot pool or it's not.
---
2. SS isn't rare. It's just time consuming to obtain. Very different things.
---
I dunno, my camp is at the extreme south edge of the map and my vendor does pretty well. Maybe once I buy the last serum recipe I'll finally go adopt that dog and see how business in the boonies is.
---
Most people sell ammo for a cap too...
---
Yeah, you should be able to easily craft a bunch of ammo, try taking over some work benches on some lead and acid collector sites maybe.
---
I've been preaching this idea forever. Lowering player count to 20 would allow a 20 percent bump to budget, problem kinda solved.
---
Yes there should be a way to join attleast
---
Don't you get that from the main story missions?
---
I can one up you mate, 1400!
---
Did you lose yours?  All you have to do is get to the point where Davenport gives you the "Photo Opportunity" quest and there will be a map marker where the camera corpse is.  If you lost it somehow, you'll have to server hop and go to Wavy Willards, Philipi Cemetary, The Giant Teapot, The Landview Lighthouse, The miner's and Kelly's monument and Bolton Greens to look for one of the special corpses that has the holotape and camera.  I think it is called Ansel's Holotape.  Server hopping and grinding those locations will take a while.  I did it before "Photo Opportunity" existed and it took more than an hour to find one.
---
I freaking HATE the scrip limit of 150. I think it needs to be 3-500 at least. Especially since we can now craft armor/weapons, which turn out to be 90% junk. Both my toons hit max scrip in the first hour of playing them. On a holiday weekend this especially sucks.
---
1301
---
Ok, to clarify.  I assumed making SS was like making regular armor, did not know it would roll as rare.  Loot pool or not, I literally NEVER got a rare.combat shotgun outside scrips until I learned the plan.  Now getting it all the time.
---
Is that the number it shows or for a stealth headshot?
---
Idk if faction rep has anything to do with it either...? Like if you side with the raiders and get high rep it assumes that settlers are the enemy?? Like I said idk in the slightest lol.
---
I have a quad handmade and it‚Äôs good
---
Tesla rifle kills frame rate and if you turn earle into ash or goo he clips under the ground and can't get to him or as mentioned if you die you get booted from the event
---
could be that dumb power fist crit sneak thing someone just posted
---
I've run it a few times where we get him to regenerate in the first 5 minutes. Then all of a sudden I have 4 or 5 guys trying to farm screws with Tesla rifles and there goes the easy winü§¨
---
And interact with the collectron...
---
Eh dont got many large carpets and plus my budgets almost to the max
---
I've got nothing but hate for anyone that punches down on folks that are special needs and/or disabled. Pure, unashamed hate. However..
---
- I didn't make the rules.
---
- If you take the word of one, sans proof, you must take the word of all. The place would be flooded with people bitching about any and all perceived slights.
---
The only thing that anyone can do is submit a ticket with Bethesda and move on.
---
Hahaha now I want to try that!
---
Same, luckily I‚Äôve only wasted the gold on one of my characters. üòÖ
---
I wouldn't either
---
Chinese stealth armor is great for silos.
---
It's just letting people know so they dont get involved in it
---
Actually that could be pretty good
---
I have heard of this group. They are the comes coming to Appalachia this winter right?
---
Not in power armor
---
Well, if they have any Nuka Cola Quantums or Stealth Boys I‚Äôll always nick those. I‚Äôll give them a lovingly hand crafted and modded handmade for their level and 1000 rounds. I get so many I can‚Äôt sell them any faster lol
---
Grind Morgantown airport, take everything, waddle to the train station, cash out, and repeat on another server.
---
Oh man. That is crappy.
---
People do it as a safeguard against the vending stash glitch. In certain situations, if you clear a vending machine empty the vending machine will populate with stash items at low prices. This lets someone get at all your really good items you dont want to sell.
---
To protect against this people place an item in each machine at 30k in the hope that you don't have 30k on hand to make the machine fully empty. Unfortunately the same people that pull off this glitch also have thousands of christmas gifts and thus access to as many caps as they want. So the item for 30k doesnt actually protect them.
---
Anti air and telescopic sights for the mg42 would make sense, reducing the mag to 50 then _maybe_ having a 100 round extended mag could be ok
---
wait, that‚Äôs not normal?
---
i literally only have found glitched ones....
---
Check the second floor of the Overseer's house in Sutton. It's tricky but it's possible to get the pieces out of the case.

---
I will pay 15-25 caps per script, depending on how many caps I have, so I would.
---
They may never say it but the heavy gunners really appreciate it
---
Thank you.
---
Just get rid of the hacking interface while you're at it.  How dare they try to make an immersive experience with a consistent technology!
---
Clipboards, life preservers, giddyup buttercup parts....
---
This is all amazing advice OP. I really, really appreciated it as someone who has been on the receiving end of a lot of this bad behavior.
---
A big part of me playing less and less has been a group of low level friends who have worn me out. Trying to help them turned into so many hours of disappointment. I tried to prevent spoiling any story so I wouldn't tell them exactly what to do or where to go unless they got stuck--this really quickly turned short quests into hours long affairs as they'd get stuck and need help with every single step, just slower.
---
Then we'd take a break, take a workshop, I'd build something cool for them. Apparently "gifting" workshops to your teammates after you log doesn't work the same way anymore? Whatever the excuse was I ended up somehow the bad guy in this situation, as they wanted to dismantle the entire workshop for scrap. That one felt like a gut punch.
---
Then it's needing a million questions answered, *ignoring my answers* and asking again or flat out doing the opposite because I may not remember everything exactly right, since as you said OP it's been a long time since I've done most content.
---
It's to the point where I'm not even logging in unless I see I can play solo... In a multiplayer game.

Bloodied &gt; Junkies = AA = Furious &gt; TS
---
Junkies vs AA vs furious really comes down to your preference.
---
Get out of your power armor then. Who in the blazes uses them for anything else than wall warp anyway?
---
Ah, it's disappointing that hasn't been patched yet. I may need to do similar with my vendors in that case.
---
Thanks for the info :)
---
People are whining that less than 5 minutes a day for legendary run is a grind.
---
My god, 1 hour a day?  THAT'S INSANE!
---
I feel like anyone trying to make an in-person trade usually wont, but if you want one of these 5 3* assaultron lasers for 950caps please take them, Im down to 1000 caps because it feels like the game‚Äôs tempo just randomly cut out toward the end of this season
---
Yes the brotherhood in game are coming in this winter but there is a group people made up that have members in it that are very rude and lie thats who I'm talking about sorry
---
Does this work for any gun, or just the ones you get from gold bullion plans?
---
You can fish, is it literally just need a rod or is there a certain mission you need to do first.
---
pipe is life.
---
You're a real class act bringing in outside drama into an area that neither warrants it or cares for it.
---
I have no dog in the fight either way but maybe best to deal with this through their Reddit page and with Reddit Support themselves. If what you say is true, they're probably violating a bunch of Reddit rules.
---
This would help theoretically, but the problem with quantifying the amount of improvement is that there is no way of knowing how complex each camp loaded into each world will be.  Some people have very complex camps that circumvent the budget restrictions and others just have "Legit" camps that are very resource intensive.  If you happen to have a full server with even 20 of those, it would likely still struggle.  The good news is that the developers have been really talking about this lately and looking for solutions.  The "Shelters" idea is getting implemented soon and they think it will help.  At least they are finally going to do something tangible in the pursuit of increasing our camp budgets.  All that we can do is cross our fingers.
---
Oh, nice.  I found out quickly headshots to piss all for damage and the body shots did more.  I kept poking around a corner with my silenced sniper rifle getting body shots and hoping it didn‚Äôt notice as I ducked in while chambering the next round.
---
My favorite is... do it again, but this time take video... and we're going to delete your ticket if you haven't done it in 3 days.

Sweet, ill come check it out.  I have a pool as well...
---
What about common items? I usually just list them for what the game reccomends but have always wondered what the values of a lot of the items are.
---
But that new army recruit needed those clipboards for all the new initiates signing up to be apart of the army :(
---
I dont know where to go with this cause I and others have been harassed and this is where I ended up so I'm sorry but I dont know what to do

I wish I could buy them from people.  I almost never turn in 20 a day..

Last week I was leveling up two characters and ran into two separate bugs on the same toon.  Bug A) was not entering a cave to progress the raider line of Wastelanders and Bug B) was not able to enter a cabin to complete an optional objective for a main quest line.   In both initial bug reports I received THE EXACT same email response from a support rep.  I don't mean the "we got you bug" message.  I mean, "did you restart your computer, did you log off and on? Etc."
---
For bug B) in the initial bug report I said I had restarted my computer, relogged, and even tried a different toon on the same account but was unable to enter the cabin.  I still got the same email!
---
You just contradicted yourself... you claim you need the plan to get them as legendary drops but then said you got some that are only scrip worthy. Or you meant you got some from spending scrip. But drops and spending scrip are same thing.
---
Its confirmed a long time ago you don't need the plan to get things as drops. Only stuff added later has that requirement.
---
Fixers, bear arms, tenderizer, and bullion stuff like SS armor.
---
Your whole post is just a big "WUT!?!?!"
---
Lmao yeah, my 5.56 sales have cut down a lot recently. My caps have stopped coming in as fast.
---
Uhhh... a lot of people. Actually, considering how almost everybody at the past 3 or 4 ACPs was in it, I‚Äôd say the majority of players
---
I wouldn‚Äôt remember. You mentioned your dad and that‚Äôs why I came to the conclusion
---
Like I already said, if what you say is true, take it to Reddit support to have either that person disciplined or have their sub shutdown altogether.
---
As you can see from the mods removing your post, this kind of shit is not welcome here.
---
B25Agi is by far the superior gun. RNGesus blessed you with that drop. That gun is definitively in the trade only category and worth more than 60k caps. Congrats on your god drop.
---
I'm glad my ancient PC can run it at all, but I still get crashes and garbage performance seemingly regardless of what combination of settings (including resolution, down to 720p) I use.

---
Bethesda needs to stop throwing darts at a wall of programming syntax/symbols or Todd needs to loosen the purse strings a little to hire people who know what they're doing.
---
This.  With the right perks a good crossbow can rival the performance of many semi-auto rifles.  I have a BE crossbow and I quite enjoy using it when I want to stealth around the map and pick things off.  In VATS it is quite good.  If it isn't your thing, thats understandable, but don't sell it short.. to the right person that is a nice piece worth some good caps.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure your urine is the most sterile thing in the wasteland water system üòÇ
---
THIS!!! Idk how many times I constantly verbally say this while doing events before and now ever more so due to Earle. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense at all and the delay is quite long. It def needs to be instant. 
---
Thank you for this post!
---
I just tried fast traveling after I loaded into a game and it insta crashed, I think it‚Äôs a sign even though I love playing this game with friends
---
I heard that this bug exists since launch , with me it always happens on private server but didnt happen to me on public ones
---
And it doesnt help that they updated the game to base fast travel cost on your level as opposed to how my caps you have. All this fast travelling from top to bottom of the map is killing my already low cap count. Maybe with the new content and one wasteland update things will fix themselves.
---
Ooh I‚Äôd love to see your pool sometime :)
---
That's how it should be, it's still a Fallout game.
---
Back in my day, every used push to talk out of courtesy , held doors open for each other, and walked up hills both ways through the snow to get to school. Kids today, I swear.
---
The only desirable mix for a missile launcher is bin + missile launcher.
---
If they've been datamined, that info's either been buried or lost at this point. I don't expect that I'll see everything that's available, but I do hope to make an extensive list that will better help people understand what to expect, and if maps are even worth using.
---
I'm seeing people on trading forums trying to sell them at 100 caps each. I've heard PS4 players call them 200 caps each. They're clearly not worth that.
---
This happened to me today. I play on PS4 and I was on around the reset time. Reset happens and same thing with the 6/9 greyed out and no points. I'm rank 40 right now after getting the game two weeks ago and have been trying to do as many daily and weekly challenges as I can. I wasn't able to play yesterday so I missed all those challenges and then today's bug happens. Pretty shitty. I wasn't expecting to hit rank 100 or anything, but still. Gonna have to start doing the challenges a lot earlier than waiting until the literal last minute like I've been doing.
---
Thanks it was honestly harder farming encrypted to get the fixer plan then it was to find the right legendary effects for the fixer itself.
---
You can only add jet pack to torso
---
&gt;Have you ever considered the limits you've put on the game??  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;You have 2 places to trade Treasury Notes for Gold Bullion.  
---
&gt;You have 1 place to buy legendary modules.
---
How are these limits exactly? It's not that common to have to queue up for either of these. Maybe during a sale but those are few and far between.
---
The rest I get but those two aren't limits in the slightest.
---
I guess I really do take it for granted sometimes.
---
This.  I've done the same thing.  Fast traveled to my tent, grabbed a card and went back in.  Breezed right back to the control room and got the launch.   Since then I always try to remember to open the shortcut doorway (in the room where you have to repair the mainframe cores to open the last locked door, it is the terminal on the wall) in case I need to go out and come back.
---
That‚Äôs luck for you. That gun is so rare you could grind for hundreds of lvls and never get one to drop.
---
Yeah but there was a way to add jetpack to your arms if you bought the camo skin
---
It is, I am getting shopping lists at least 3 times a week or more , normally from low levels joining my public team, curse you heard mentality!
---
If it helps, I found a Colossus trapped in the Sun dew grove near the SBQ event. I have a magic gauss Minigun and with no chems, food or anything special it took about 30 seconds to wear him down. I'll a full health build though so that in bloodied with chems up to my eyeballs and yeah, maybe 10-15s might be about right.
---
Is it the chapel of mothman
---
I bought 10 legendary modules today and crafted 10 SS torsos. Rolled one 3* unyeilding, which is what I was trying for, which I kept even though the other stats were lockpicking and another useless one. Anyway, the point is I dropped/destroyed the other 9 since they can't be traded and I don't need them for scrip because I have plenty of other crap to scrip and I'm up againt the 150 limit and a full scrapbox. What a waste.
---
Oh then I don‚Äôt know about that then sorry that  I‚Äôm not much help
---
Do you have a moderately good laptop? I play with a controller and hdmi going to my TV and it's pretty much like playing modded on console.
---
I don‚Äôt talk much in game but these last two crews I played with pulled there weight so much they made me up my game I was attracting all the spawns and didn‚Äôt realize I put myself in a corner and I couldn‚Äôt kill them fast enough plus I didn‚Äôt think anyone was paying attention but all of a sudden a hail of exploding bullets totally blasting them into hamburger saved my ass a heavy gunner literally catching the spawns in mid air it‚Äôs the reason I love playing this game it‚Äôs moments like that
---
Also your pain sista üò©
---
LOL I spit out my coke.
---
I did it last night incase they fix it
---
Headshots on Assaultron serve for stopping a Laser and etc , you get more damage on the limbs
---
In my experience , sentry bots in fallout 4/76 are way easier to deal than assaultrons due to overheating , and in NV they used to Spam rockets at fist range so...it was a mess
---
But as you said , it as a LVL 55 so , probly no way you would be able to deal with it
---
The excavator power armor helps alot , in my opnion is the best overall , but if you like to use vats alot , i would not advise on using Power armors at all in the early mid game, vats burn fusion core like nothing
---
Very nice, love the Art Deco feel. Great you had enough budget for living space, too.
---
People bought my ammo all the time before I stopped selling and started converting. I had a lot to sell, too.
---
Now they just buy my chems lol
---
Had a couple go like that, think nobody‚Äôs paying attention and you getting swarmed and all the sudden green lasers are firing from everywhere...Good stuff
---
I didn't realize you could kill it
---
Do you think it will work tommorow?
---
I like mothman but the only good cultist is a dead one. Now the wise mothman and whoever it is that's talking during the event featuring him? That's the guy I want to befriend.
---
A lot of people, I sell all kinds of ammo for 1 cap at my vendor and I am constantly sold out and cap maxed
---
Only if he isn't talking all day like allies and collectrons.
---
I'm not sure what a mini nuke weighs.. but IIRC maybe 3 pounds.  I wonder if you failed to receive them because it would have put your character over the max weight limit.  Not defending Bethesda, just wondering if that might be the root of this bug.
---
And Bethesda support does suck.  So much.
---
It took me a minute but it appears hes substituting ‚Äúrare‚Äù for Legendary
---
I've found the best way to help noobs is to give them mini-quests or companion quests of your own, like the time I dragged a noob halfway across the Forest to show him how to use an airdrop holotape and gave him some bobby pins to open it.
---
I want the pipe as a chem not for the buff but just the visual effect.
---
It might I would do it soon just incase
---
I help newbies with some weapons when they come out of the vault.
---
can your dad adopt me? asking for a friend
---
I want to get it but is just that I need 200 more gold then I will finally hit 2000 gold
---
As a 413, the best I can give a noob is some hand crafted leather armour, and a shitty gun.  Ain‚Äôt got time to keep scores of god tier rolls on low level stuff, I‚Äôd have to work for that, specifically, on a lower character, and I‚Äôm to busy doing me.
---
Also, don‚Äôt beg, it‚Äôs unbecoming... take that peasant level bull shit elsewhere *wriggles upper lip and adjust monocle*
---
I love the post, but in kindness, I think learning to say "no" a little more often would save you some frustration
---
I am going to ignore #1 since the fact is is incorrect has already been addressed elsewhere.   #3 is known by anyone who investigates what is craftable at the cooling station. 
---
What I would like to address is #2.  What is your point?  It is totally unclear what people are suppose to thank you for later because you failed to explain what you mean.
---
I give up, was trying to be helpful.  I had same experience with combat armor, but maybe it was just me.  I will just keep recommending folks buy the plan out of an abundance of caution.
---
I would still try tomorrow
---
Cute and annoying af when its floating around and released a pack of raiders on you that it's not hurting or getting hurt by and one of the raiders is legendary. You kill the legendary but then the moth man one shots u because you didnt stimpack fast enough lol didnt get my 3star
---
You're gonna keep confusing people if you use "rare" and "legendary" interchangeably. 
---
They're different things.
---
Silo state holo tape,tells you if there‚Äôs any time left to wait.
---
Yes you can push/pull, Lift/Lower on ps4. if you hold "X" Then you push L1 to lift and R1 to lower. Pushing and pulling same concept you hold "X" then use your left stick to push away from you or pull closer to you.
---
Yes legendary battles
---
They have to run a cheat software to do that.  I wouldn't go within a mile of that person because it is likely they have full access to your inventory.  Bethesda is bad, but some of these hacks are awful.
---
Can you let me know if it works?
---
Bonus tip: don‚Äôt drink toilet water and gain 50% life span
---
Some effects remain multiplicative. Tenderizer perk, AA, TS all remain unchanged by this.
---
Maybe they are Trazyn the Infinite made manifest in FO76 and he is just trying to collect stuff for his galleria on Solemnace
---
And? You can literally get it for free at the Overseer‚Äôs Home.
---
Which is why I didn‚Äôt scrip it. As a non-bloodied build, this would have been awesome for me as a rifle. I figure it may be the same for a stealth crossbow user.
---
Huh? I didn't understand a word of that
---
Where do you find a power armor plan???
---
If you played Warhammer 40K and were a necron player, you would get the reference 
---
Trazyn, also known as Trazyn the Infinite, is a Necron Overlord and the self-proclaimed Archaeovist of the Solemnace Galleries on the Necron Tomb World of Solemnace.
---
But not everybody expects a 40K reference in other games
---
Common items you need to get a feel based on how others are selling. I would google "rare FO76 items" and go from there. For example, an asylum nurse outfit that is white or weathered won't sell. But if you find one of the colorful ones, you could sell those for 1000 caps apiece or higher. Depending on the color
---
This is the elusive one. Keyword: ‚Äúfireman‚Äôs‚Äù
---
Oof that's a bummer. Every game has its griefers, I guess. I'm just a broke noob looking for crystals and aluminum though lol
---
It doesn‚Äôt happen all the time but yes sometimes if you die you cannot comeback. It‚Äôs the respawn bug where you are alive but still have ‚Äúpress a to respawn‚Äù at the bottom and cannot do anything.  That said I always pay attention to the level of the other player doing earl with me. If it isn‚Äôt going to go well I turn it into a screw run. 4-5 gun repairs and 6k .45 rounds isn‚Äôt worth it.
---
No, this is the rare one that has a 0.1% chance to drop.
---
Berserker melee is viable but I‚Äôm not sure any very fast weapons are viable anymore
---
Since it‚Äôs your cake day I‚Äôll ask him &lt;3
---
Gorgeous camp. But you mothmen followers are odd fellers.
---
Noice!  Love a good themed build
---
I get you were trying to be helpful don't stop.
---
I will say buying the plan is useful because most items you have to scrap the item to unlock mods.
---
So if shotguns are your jam never hurts to buy the plan. Equip super duper and make a bunch and scrap them.
---
You can double check the mod database to see if you are missing mods and if they do indeed come from scrapping.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/g3dqwa/plan_and_mod_database_wastelanders_update_is_now/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Thanks. I'll check around other camps.
---
After playing the game for 2 years I came to this conclusion. 
---
You have to keep things moving. Those heavy 1 and 2 star items need to be dropped or transferred to a mule for a rainy scrip day. I like to drop them for low level players. When scripping scrip the heaviest first.
---
Use the station vendors to sell of all of the aid and junk you don't need so you can maintain your optimum weight and always try to get back to that weight. When it comes to chems, food and drinks I hold no more than 8 to10 of what I always use (excluding stims) and transfer the rest to a mule, sell or drop for low levels. 
---
When filling your vending machine try to sell things that will be useful to other players but low in weight.
---
Point Pleasant is full of low level Blood Eagles who drop loads of stims.  The church there usually has some too.   That place alone should satisfy your stimpak needs.   Use Water/Food/Rest/Healing Salves when you don't need a full stim, and dilute some stims for that same purpose.
---
Anywhere that has blood eagles will net you plenty of stims, but Point Pleasant is probably the easiest.  There is another nest of them on the east shore of the Summersville Lake.
---
That's a bummer. Its super rare and it doesn't even look that good
---
Ahh. So you‚Äôre one of the fabled ‚ÄúI‚Äôm better because I‚Äôve played for 3000hrs‚Äù players. F*** you. You‚Äôre not ‚Äúhelping‚Äù you‚Äôre discouraging new players from interacting.
---
Unknown for right now I am sure it will be on PTS next month though.
---
My post got shut down? We're does it say that?
---
I had a BFFR FR crossbow and it was functional but that was the best I could say about it. It was fun, but even with the reload time, it was just too slow.  
---
Those stats on almost any other ranged weapon would be excellent.
---
Thanks
---
Definitely. You can drop them and any extra holotapes. Many people report seeing a performance improvement after freeing up that space, so that's a bonus.
---
This is underrated advice.
---
That's so awesome. What's next for you guys to hunt down together?
---
&gt; If I fully spec out my character for a berserkers build, do you think it would be viable to use a berserkers buzz blade?
---
No.
---
They are limits on your time. If you're at a train station, and you are unloading your legendaries, then you get a message that you're at your scrip limit, you either go past that limit, or you stop what you're doing and FT over to the Rusty Pick. You can't buy legendary modules at any other place. 
---
You have to go to Foundation or Crater to sell your Treasury notes, you're lmited in where you can sell those Treasury notes to TWO PLACES, instead of having those machines in more places. Think about it, "We're bringing a currency back to the wasteland! IN THESE TWO LOCATIONS WHERE YOU CAN TRADE THESE TREASURY NOTES"...doesn't make a lot of sense.
---
You are right.  Good call to keep it.  Hope you find the right guy and get some decent money for it.
---
Probably some sort of vent from a mine or landfill and you just sniffed some sort of gas that's beneficial now but will fuck your shit up maybe years down the line like it did to the dead guy you find next to it. Good luck!
---
Yeah. I get bailing if it's turning into a shit storm. Earle still hasn't given me anything good anyway. I think I may just stick with the SBQ. 
---
Happy cake day.
---
did it an hour ago and it still works
---
Stims shouldn't be tied to anything.  Using a stim should take precedence over any other action.
---
i have been into another player's mothman cult theme camp. doesnt looks like yours. yours are quite modern. the one i met was more of shack kinda setup. it was so much real that even his/her ally was wearing ritual binding and mask. took a photo with the ally at the altar who sat holding a jar of scorched parts in it, looking at me. best part of it, I was also wearing a ritual binding and a sack with air vent for my headgear and that ally was looking and looks like smiling at me. awesome moment for a once mothman follower.
---
ps: i bumped into a mothman cult site yesterday and during that time, ironically, the Mothman Cultists were shooting at a Mothman who was adamant in killing these batch of cultist. What a twist of faith for them. hahha! Maybe their prayer's offering were not accepted by the Mothman.
---
110 not 190
---
thats awsome!
---
Would make sense but not even some sort of compensation? Like ouch cmon Bethesda just pay for it like 100 atoms just like the canvas bags
---
No, also damage cap is 110, 190 must be a visual bug
---
All the melee weapons with no mods at all really bother me. Some of that stuff would be good to use if they just got a buff.
---
Cons:  We need to do Bethesda's job for them at this point.
---
You don't need them at all.  I only save the funny ones like "You have been Insulted" "Your the dumbass" and "I'm watching you". 
---
Throw them all away.
---
Shotgun: vats gauss shotgun for farming, silenced combat shotgun for bossing. (Low difficulty, cheap on bullets)
---
Heavy gun: any heavy gun. (Low difficulty, cheap - expensive depends on weapon)
---
Automatic rifle: Handmade/10mm sm, energy rifles (Mid difficulty, moderate expense)
---
Automatic pistol: any pistol (high difficulty, high expense)
---
If you ever need someone to roleplay with just hmu
---
From asking around, I think it‚Äôs only from the bullion plans.
---
The damage cap is 110, my dude.
---
Not a level 20. Just there character was. You should have known.
---
Well thanks for letting me know I think It might work for tommorow
---
thanks, do you know if anything allows to go over the damage cap?
---
Happened to me. Got the card. Made it through and bam no card.
---
As in outfits? Anything black with a longcoat!
---
Imo ditch the terminal all together and just have it open the menu when you spin the machine.
---
Pipe is life but not the kind celebrates with pie because pie is a lie.
---
Hunters long coat and the insurgent outfit are my favorites to combo with it
---
Be even shorter getting stagger raped by a yao gui
---
How many caps does it cost you to travel from crater to foundation? It costs me something like 60-ish.
---
Ah, similar thing I'm guessing happened to a guy on PS4 today.
---
5 or 6 of us, all high level, were doing One Violent Night when the Encryptid notice popped up. Had way more legendaries than normal, so we all finished the event. I fast travelled to Encryptid to find 3 people or so doing it.  One a higher level, one around 50, and one really low. Only 1:30 left on the clock. It failed. Felt bad for the guy who spent the card.
---
... and thus is the whole purpose of gambling away your scrip. If you had better odds, then there wouldn't be a grind. And if there wasn't a grind, people wouldn't need to play so much. And if people didn't play so much, then the world would be empty.
---
late response but if you haven't found out yet from what I've read in another post, it fills your food and water, cures any disease you have, and fully heals you
---
I was always hoping one day there would be an achieve for having them all.
---
Just an FYI, dropping items for yourself on a private server has been bugged since the last update.  Many times logging off and back on will now put you in a totally new world regardless of how quickly you do it.  I'm beginning to suspect this is intentional in response to the many recent dupes and how people mule things.  Maybe (probably) I'm just paranoid.  But when it concerns your best items, one can't help but be paranoid.
---
Always use the blue suitcase at the whitesprings station.  Any unlimited world container should work, but I don't trust the others since I've had them fail.  I've never lost anything in the blue suitcase there except lately when these server shenanigans started and that isn't the fault of the container.
---
The only way to do it reliably right now is with a trusted friend (you can rejoin the same server by joining them if they stay on it) or maintaining a seperate account and  logging both into your private world to do the deed.   I wouldn't trust any other method until they fix whatever is going on with private worlds right now.
---
I‚Äôm still kind of amazed there isn‚Äôt a bullion machine in the vault
---
What are you supposed to do with 'em?
---
Bethesda's logic: Ignore the issue while you "deal with it"
---
Its like 40 I think, hard to tell bc my camp is next to ATLAS. sometimes i make a pit stop to cut cost.
---
Wow, i dont think im like that at all (i hope im not like that) i hope you could maybe try and reread this in the constructive criticism of new player behavior vein, and not such an analytic dissection of my personal character. if you can, please.
---
Increase the scrip cost per roll. The grind would still be there.
---
i know explosive effect went over the damage cap a few months back; but does it still and how about TS?
---
you think TS allows to go over dmg cap?
---
I use the first two methods that you mentioned in tandem.  Has worked for me so far, even with the recent server weirdness.
---
thanks XD
---
I like the idea but then I don‚Äôt because when I got the three best rolls from here right after each other one night a month ago it was the best feeling in the world. I got my very first bloodied fixer that night. If it was like how your idea is it wouldn‚Äôt mean as much when you pull a roll from Todd Howard himself. I mean it sucks also being since then every night I will roll all the scrip I have usually I try to have 300 and it‚Äôs always junk. Every single night since I got three bloodied weapons in a row and pulled my bloodied fixer ( 250 damage resistance while reloading and 50 more critical damage) I do wish the limit of scrip was raised or at least give us vouchers so I don‚Äôt walk around with useless legendaries.

FeralCryptid251
---
Oh, I'm with you on that.  They are FOS saying that they can't restore items or compensate for losses.  They've done it for select people in the past.
---
That's exactly why I never wear a mic during games...it's a lose/lose situation for us!
---
Hmm... I‚Äôve sent friend requests to people who‚Äôve helped me and I often hop on their servers to team up sometimes, but I‚Äôm no beggar, I just like to be a friend to the friendly. And I pay back when/however I can, like I gave all my repeat meat week plans to folks who‚Äôve hooked me up in the past.
---
I fired the final shot into earle the other day, just as I was re-entering the arena. I dropped down the shaft, fired one last shot to kill... and the shaft instant-collapses... and I ended up re-spawning on the other side of the map, no longer in the event.
---
\-\_-    ... all that time and ammo. Sigh.
---
No.  It doesn't matter what weapon you use.  Hacked 50 cal still does 110 in PVP.
---
Like outfit?  I think it looks good with the insurgent outfit I wear sometimes.
---
Same.
---
No really, youre right, and i do. However, ive been witness to, and personally blocked players who really couldt take no for an answer. Id really just like any new players (i wont call them newbs anymore, ive taken a ton of flak for that in this post) to learn from my own mistakes and things ive learned to better acclimate to an environment they are entering where they are at a serious disadvantage as far as having something to offer.
---
We co-host a weekly gaming radio show in the Virginia, Maryland, DC area even :/ we do a lot of great things, but it‚Äôs all local. The catch being we do great things in THEIR local area. We‚Äôd still love to talk if someone from Bethesda wanted to. We have even invited them to do softball interviews and to (for free) talk about any jobs or job fairs they are doing in the area. 
---
I don‚Äôt understand but I fully support the idea and would love to help them and the community out.
---
Great Post, but now I feel a little embarrassed because I'm level 126 and haven't launch a nuke nor finished wastelanders (just finished officer on deck, so my next is I am become death)  hahaha, like 3 days ago one level 40 ask me for help and I had absolutely no idea how to launch a nuke (still doesn't because haven't started the mission), I only know that I need 8 codes from the same silo and nuclear keycards. XD
---
I've contacted customer support a dozen times, and this kind of shit response is the only thing I've ever received.
---
Exactly how i feel when people use the stage i built in my roof
---
Two times I‚Äôve failed this event out of 30 times and each time I‚Äôve failed we literally get to regen mode with in minutes and then we get no where and the event fails with a quarter of health left. I truly believe they where also farming screws
---
That could be pretty nice
---
üò≠ So no legendary fixer or sniper for me...
---
I read this as stagger wrapped and I can't get the image of Yogi dropping sick bars on me till I die out of my head.
---
I regret nothing.
---
Seems highly unlikely they release a patch on a holiday, you should be good
---
This is super well done, good job!
---
Suitcases at trainstations is where I put unwanted plans, ammo, miscellaneous junk.
---
I solo tank the imposter sheepsquatch and let everyone else grab pylons and kill him while I take every hit from him 
---
I really need a vamp .50cal tbh
---
Mountain scout and blue ridge caravan go good with it
---
Had that happen to me Friday.  I was in there with only two low levels, 60-70.  I'm 394.  We were actually well on our way to killing Earle when he started glitching into the ceiling then dripping down into the floor. This kept up for seven or eight minutes before he started acting normally.  Thought we could still win but, I got killed by something and by the time I respawned and got back down the shaft only about 15 seconds left. He was down to no more than1 or 2 % of health when the timer ran out
---
Maybe I missed something, I‚Äôm sorry. If you know the plans, they have a chance to drop in the lego loot pool.
---
Big F
---
I dunno, he does look a little green.  Probably realizes he bit off more than he could chew.
---
Dont be embarrassed,  I was the same way around that level. It was only because of higher levels that I learned and this post was in genuine interest of helping other new players learn from those same mistakes and develop relationships with high levels that pay dividends later when I became a "veteran" and had the perspective to teach. Carry on wastelander, you will be on that level soon.
---
Annoying players exist regardless the level. I had a level ~200 guy bitch and moan over his mic today because I got to a vendor before he did. Seriously dude, I have just as much a right to be here as you do. Wait your turn.
---
Agree.
---
This has me thinking. Is the 110 damage cap per shot, or per bullet. Because if it‚Äôs per bullet then in a sense TS could go over the cap.
---
CSS the whole silo, keeps the rads off and helps with sneak.  Lock pick the first door on the left in the reactor room and hack the terminal in the next room.  Will bypass most the enemies.   Stay stealth the whole way.  I clear all the turrets and robots in the launch room before the prep. Once the prep starts I crouch on the 3 metal box stack right in front of the launch terminal and snipe all the enemies when the spawn.   Can usually breeze through with this strat.
---
I'm only up to 330 hours so far, never once tried to trade with anyone.
---
You have been playing that long and those are your best drops.  Rngesus hates you
---
Solid
---
I relate to this, since ppl started found this the game mode just broke
---
And that right there is what it's all about. I'm not chiding the "beggars" I'm just trying to point out, theres a better way to go about it, and it doesn't sound like it applies to you.
---
Pfft, these bums offering caps. I know what you need. 5 whole hot dogs with grill marks!
---
Heheh bushwookie go boom
---
That would make me want to throw things. I won't lie.
---
Do you have 2 Cobalt flux?
---
yep, and you can also get the raider punk as your settlement ally, and his daily quest will sometimes include sending you to kill a flatwoods monster. I've only ever seen one in the wild, and when I got the raider punk the second mission he sent me on was to kill one.
---
I just want the astroturf floors
---
I wish, a fishing mission would be bad ass
---
Can you run down through the exit tunnel to get back in that way?  It opens when the tunnel collapses so maybe that's an option..
---
Wow. Dream roll.
---
&gt;I'm hoping this next patch fixes it 
---
ROFL
---
Hiiighhhhh hopes
---
I just did it solo.  Had some hiccups like my stealth kept breaking and I kept taking environmental damage.  But 11 minutes later I had him.  And that crappy little 1* shovel will hang in my CAMP as a reminder.
---
But other than that it's all OK right xD
---
Well if I were you I wouldn‚Äôt take less than 25k caps for that.
---
Super ok, best event of 2020, right after treasure hunt in the ash heap for loot mole miners
---
I found that the Enclave underarmor with full brotherhood combat armor goes good with it.
---
I've learned this fighting Earl. Kept wondering why I was still dying while hammering my stimpack button. For some odd reason I always seem to hold aggro on Earl and I've been learning to pause after a bit to get my heals in cause his spit seems to do a load of damage to me.
---
I kinda don't mind tanking.. but I'm not built for it. Nor do I know what that spit damage type is and how to lower it.
---
I think the buy/sell three items for score has done wonders for the business. I do have a camp idea that fits the area, but I‚Äôm quite happy in my current set up.
---
Legendary Snores perk card can wake a Scorchbeast.
---
This is absolutely true. I get rid of anything extra in my notes, misc and holotapes and there is a definite decrease in lag.
---
I've had this happen, I logged out, closed the game, restarted the game and logged back in and poof it was back.
---
Is this a thing more common on PC? Nobody is on mic on console, I‚Äôve had minor help and I‚Äôve seen others provide minor help, but it‚Äôs mostly a loner experience aside from your friends. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen anyone throw up the trade emote, trading is super pointless in this game, anyone who‚Äôs given me stuff as a low level just drops stuff and does the ‚Äúfollow me‚Äù emote, which is what I see most often. 
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong this is what the community should be, mostly solo, a few niceties during events and that‚Äôs pretty much it, and I‚Äôm glad for it, but apparently this other stuff goes on enough for people to make large posts with tons of likes, and I‚Äôve put in quite a few hours now and I‚Äôve pretty much never seen any of this.
---
Good question üòÇ
---
No. That would ruin my build. Your saying I can't equip a nuka grenade and kamikaze enemy groups. My entire perk is built around grenades.
---
And I double teamed it with my friend running her stealth junkie commando and me running bloodied unarmed stealth in 6 minutes.  Coulda been faster but I didn‚Äôt wanna pop my Vintage Nuka-Shine too early and get ported out.
---
That‚Äôs not true. 
---
We need each other in order to keep it special - otherwise it would be Empty Appalachia
---
Good u suck at games
---
Thank you so much for your comment,  in this post, I've been made to feel like such a douche for suggesting this. I'm totally with you and I too am just trying to encourage not discourage the new player base but it gets horribly frustrating and I needed an outlet to maybe try and find a way to turn the new guys on the right path for all of us. Dont give up, the high you get from that 1 good interaction is well worth the 15 bad ones. At least that's what I tell myself lol.
---
How many stars?
---
More time spent travelling = more time playing the game = less time spent playing other games. It sucks but all live service games deliberately do it to monopolise your time
---
I have to make sure I‚Äôm in a team with someone bc it will resplendent me outside the mine or at my location I fast traveled in from to start with.
---
It is per projectile but remember that TS splits your damage output between projectiles and then half of those usually miss.  Not many TS weapons have the brute power to overcome this and accuracy is terrible at mid to high range.
---
Sorry you feel that way buddy. I'm really not like that. I'm just trying to help, really. I'm maybe not the best at explaining.. but thanks for reading
---
you can always show up at the queen, you ain't taking anyone's spot, so the more the merrier. you might not get the event rewards if you don't do enough damage and don't expect to be revived all the time. I've seen lvl 4s at the queen and it's always fun.
---
Nearly every train station has a **blue-ish/aqua suitcase**. The most traveled-to stations used to be Whitespring (for nuking the golf course) and Watoga (SBQ). I guess Sunnytop is getting some foot traffic now from Earle, but it doesn't seem that significant. 
---
I would like to humbly suggest **PLEASANT VALLEY STATION** and it's blue suitcase as the Gentlemen's Dead Drop. It's centrally located, reasonably close to various points of interest, and features both a workbench AND a cooking station.
---
What say you?
---
u/scountbot
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 üòÜ
---
It‚Äôs happened to us all.  Some jerk with a hacked weapon.   Just keep trying.  I‚Äôve done this event tons of times now and only once did someone do this.   Everyone in the event thumbs down to him so maybe he got the point that‚Äôs not cool.  But 1 out of maybe 30 or 40 times so far isn‚Äôt too bad.
---
u/srd42 has said '/s' 5 times.
---
Tag me in a reply to anyone or mention me as "u/scountbot u/{targetperson}" anywhere if you want me to count how many times they've said '/s' !
---
I keep getting asked for my legacy weapons.  Yeah like I‚Äôm gonna part with my hard earned weapons that took me dozens of hours of tedious grinding when the game was broken to get for a measly 3k caps.
---
It‚Äôs even more of a true fallout game when you think of it. 
---
You have players who are BOS hardcore. 
---
Hardcore Enclave. 
---
Weird dollhouse in the wasteland players. 
---
Murderous players
---
I am Abraham Lincoln players 
---
People who just want to raise their chickens and cows
---
We are living out what Van Buren envisioned - not the same story or world or whatever was expected of that but a real multiplayer fallout. 
---
The only thing we don‚Äôt have is real Trader caravans and Caravan but I‚Äôm sure those discord‚Äôs will come up with it soon.
---
Know where to find some handmade rifles? I have no upgrades unlocked at all
---
Mechanist Outfit is solid if you have bought the bundle that came with it
---
Also I used no chems. Just the fixer and my mutations. I have all unyielding secret service armor but I use one chameleon marine armor left leg
---
I‚Äôve been playing a stealth sniper since I started in June, I can kill all regular enemies easily but I feel like I‚Äôm useless in boss fights. I‚Äôve been watching videos of commando builds so now I‚Äôm buying the commando perk cards to switch over. Not looking forward to the ammo use though...
---
I‚Äôm still mad someone stole my TSE Dragon from my stash when people could jack your items glitching the vending machine.  It hurts so bad.
---
Maybe the engineer outfit.
---
If a guy with low intelligence can build a radiation archway or create a mini nuke, I am quite certain we can build a coaster. But seriously though, imagine if the park was fully repaired as part of a community event, providing access to riding all the rides there. Could rebuild the gift-shop into a proper one with all these cool new items and trinkets. Maybe even get working skeeball machines with underhand grenade throws using skeeballs as a retextured nonexploding grenade. Even could do it for the basketballs to make that game work. The entire area would become a social area for players of all levels to congregate at.
---
I‚Äôll give you a winter fashnacht mask for it :P
---
This happened to me once too.  Fell though the floor.  We all just kinda stood around for a few mins...the. Looted the spawns till it failed.  ‚ÄúIt just works‚Äù. Lol.
---
Sounds like u should just not get hit. Ez.
---
Stairs are the endgame boss. I'm lvl 576 and still haven't beat them
---
If you have excavator power armor I would recommend Lucky Hole mine.  There are multiple lead and crystal nodes for you to collect.  Throw on the Super Duper  and you'll be able to smelt a massive amount.
---
AVR Medical (Charleston) has lots of microscopes and surgical trays, you can also hit up Morgantown High School.  That should get you a fair amount of Aluminum.  Always keep your ears open for windchimes, they give aluminum and are fairly common.
---
If you're dead set on taking a workshop, I'd recommend setting aside time during the "off" hours for gameplay.  With people staying home and not working as much it's harder to nail that down, but I shoot for sunday night and monday night.  You want to be on around two or three AM-ish.  That's when I used to take the power plants for fusion cores.
---
Again, can't speak for the current situation though...I'd wager you'll run into people thirsty for pvp at any time of day right now.
---
I beg to differ. The deathclaw one is awesome. The raven one is pretty cool too. The other ones are just display to brag I have them all ;). I display the other two as well if I‚Äôm not wearing them.
---
I usually play without vats, but I‚Äôm aiming for a heavy weapons build once I hit the 50-60 range.    I almost have a full set of T-60 armor I‚Äôve found and a hoard of fusion cores.
---
Among other things. Still can feel skin peeling off.
---
Sold it for 30k and rad barrel plan I think it was more then worth it.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what a trash bag using demo expert and grenadier would say ü§°
---
Nice roll!
---
Dont let it discourage you buddy. You are what makes the game better, I love that Santa cow bit. Things like that, random creative fucks out there just shining thier shine are the things that I love stumbling across in the wasteland. Stay gold.
---
Pets have been confirmed already and were even leaked by accident the emote to trigger tricks. Only bad news this will be a pet who won't follow you as companion NPCs can't be done in Fallout 76 due to various technical hurdles so expect it the same way as current companions work but you can pick alternate breeds via purchased skins.
---
I don't play NW, i play pvp in adventure
---
Given they changed Assassins to include humans, I could see this.
---
Oh wait its not just for players anymore?? Is that live?
---
if you have someone shooting you with a legacy just run to there face real fast they will take of themselves..........
---
I mean, then why comment? I pvp adventure too and you can shoot me with 4 gat plasmas and I‚Äôll tank it all because adventure pvp is broken in a fun way. But it‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm talking about. There shouldn‚Äôt be GL with perks and no defense for it at all in a battle Royale. Also if you wanna adventure mode pvp HMU anytime psn: rattle_libre
---
This whole post is very confusing, are you talking about pipe pistols?
---
Not everyone is a bloodied build, bloodied is obviously for solo play but some people don‚Äôt want to play that.
---
Thanks!
---
Thank you in return you awesome mofo. I hope I can maybe come up with something else to brighten your feed. Like I said I've taken so much from this sub it feels great to give back, and even so much moreso if it helps new players get and keep longtime friends that I have had the awesome experience of getting.
---
Nuka dark!
---
Pc master race and i commented because u sound like a whiney 14 yr old who just got killed in a video game and i find it fun 2 take the piss out of that. And if u have an issue with the game mode, take it up with Bethesda instead of crying for attention on reddit
---
5, 14, 3, 9, 1, 15, 9 imo
---
Nuke builds are overrated. I get targeted dead center often and pretty much never get hit. 9 in charisma because tenderizer and field surgeon are a-tier perks. Suppressor is really good too.  I put the 5 in strength for a melee build when winning gets boring.
---
I have the scribe outfit so yeah. Thx tho
---
Why swap servers, as long as you still have maps for that location you can re-dig it as soon as the animation is complete
---
Every character I play looks like they are made of playdough, everything is smudged out 90% of the time and plants are made entirely of flat, jagged shapes
---
I like to think I would have given him a warning shot straight to the chest.  
---
I don‚Äôt have a mic to use but I feel that‚Äôs a clear message it‚Äôs time to be on his way.
---
The language barrier is a real problem, I have Arabic guys I play "Rise of kingdoms " with and they seem like awesome guys, but I can use google translation for that, sadly fallout dont have any option for non-English lingo folks.
---
Ok so you obviously not getting it. It don‚Äôt matter what build you‚Äôre. I was mainly saying what I was. You can go solo it as long as you have a decent weapon. Shit sh games did it with a non legendary gat laser. I‚Äôm saying if you can‚Äôt finish it with a group do it solo. I wanted to but never did until tonight when everyone had left. I did it within 6 minutes if you start the event solo and have 20 minutes no matter what build you should be able to do it
---
Neat
---
Well I'm on a GTX 1660 so I got everything pretty well maxed out.
---
I used troubleshooter the first time through. In subsequent runs, I did a bloodied build, built for sneaking, and then a run in power armor.  Those worked for me, but those aren't the only ways. CSS works good for sneaking, but have something in case you get discovered.
---
Perks I'd max: rifleman, expert rifleman, master rifleman, tank killer, sneak, covert operative, bloody mess, tormentor.
---
Is everyone really offended on reddit? Like I simply post to let ppl know they can do it solo and everyone acts like I wrote it to offend ppl. I‚Äôm saying do it solo and try it out I bet it will be easier then if you do it in a group
---
It wasnt my intentions at all. I'm sorry if you feel that way. I'm not trying to berate anyone, I'll try to maybe figure out how to gauge my tone differently but I can only insist my intention was as I said it was and nothing more. Thanks for reading this post anyways!
---
I haven‚Äôt tried it solo but I feel they just made him with too much health like it‚Äôs not even hard just too beefy
---
As one who grinded Forest events looking for the outfit for over a year, congrats.
---
I see it every so often but how do you get the jet pack? 70 levels in and I‚Äôve never heard anything about it
---
Update: Furious taps out at 41 per basic hit. Bloodied was getting about 37.
---
1000% this. Why am I gonna trade you my jumpsuit or mask I‚Äôm wearing. You think I‚Äôm carrying an explosive plasma just in case I find the right buyer? I use these things, I wouldn‚Äôt sell them for caps, or really trade them for anything. When people run up to me and invite to trade, most times I just give a way and go about my business, or fast travel somewhere else.
---
Console, fallout 76 is one of the worst looking multiplayer games I've played

If the graphics were consistent I'd reconsider, but they aren't

Nakedvaultdweller is great. Pretty small channel as well.

He's got a great southern accent that sounds like a food YouTuber I like named wolfpit.

Also like others have said angry turtle but I'm really enjoying mitzee's videos.

Thank you, and I get it. I totally get it. That's why I posted this. Dont let it discourage you. Theres more vault newbs that need help and wont be so dense. You are awesome for what you did, take my updoot

It just works

Also ‚Äúmaster race‚Äù lmao ok u fuckin weirdo
---
Lol I know right!!!!!! ü§£
---
I thought so too until I did it this time when everyone left. I used less ammo and only had to fix gun once. I mean the event really isn‚Äôt worth it being all rewards for event that where new I have and the weapons I get from him and the event have been crap. I think queen fights are better just for the simple fact of repair kits
---
I did it in a group of 3, but I was the only one doing damage. The other guy had an explosive shotgun maybe but my bloodied explosive .50 is what killed him. Used about 6,500 rounds.
---
I hate that they think caps mean anything to us endgame players. Like no, the 2k caps you're offering for one of my rare af items doesn't mean shit.
---
Can confirm
---
You have to finish the wastelanders quest line and then you use the rewards to unlock it (it‚Äôs a grind)
---
Its rng my guy. If you're on pc ill sell you one. I've gotten like 6 but its one of my favourite events and I like to run it .
---
You could get very unlucky and never get it statistically improbable but who knows.
---
I think ima try it solo with you being able to
---
It‚Äôs random there is no estimate
---
Take a noob under your wing and teach thats what i do
---
Oh is it one of the blueprints from the secret service guys?
---
There are 2 different things here, 1, as veterans we tend to forget that new guys have 0 recognition of the fact thier desk plans aren't worth fuckall. They'll learn when they dont sell.. 
---
2, I funnel the wedigos right over to them and thumbs down them when they die as I take wendigo swipes like mosquito bites.. best lesson I can give given the circumstances
---
I always wondered that two.  Tbh  I thought they would have done something like that when they launched wastelanders. But i also understand the importance of having a main antagonist , that way there's always someone to fight.
---
Wait what, there‚Äôs people who quit the event because they got scared off?
---
In this game of glitches and exploits, anything is possible. None of my weapons do. Pvp is all about damage per second. Ffr is king...
---
Yeah you have to buy the chest plan and the jet pack plan
---
I try to remain helpful as much as I can and I am.
---
However I‚Äôve had several situations like you describe.
---
One person donations turn into whole family affairs.
---
People spamming beg emotes based on my level and demanding I buy crap off them for insane cap amounts and then kicking me out of random public groups if I don‚Äôt.
---
Really I hope these toxic people get bored quick, I don‚Äôt want them fucking up my chill.
---
You still on?
---
https://youtu.be/eLauAg0Fq_U
---
I recommend watching this because he explains it much better than me üòÇ
---
Ahhh okay, tbh their items just never really peaked my interest so I always hoarded my bullion so I may have enough to get it or atleast have a good starting point
---
Im hitting lvl 100 now, but when you champs would show up randomly and drop gifts on me or besst mode an event for me I always tried to give any bobbleheads or magazines I lucked into.
---
I went by a camp today and this level 30 had leather armor mod plans for 500 caps each, and at first I laughed then I realized I wasted 30 caps to fast travel to his camp bc it said 20 plans and there wasnt anything worth buying.
---
Fuckin right, and that "good enough for me " feels is worth more than caps, thank you for getting the m.o. behind my post. Updoot for you
---
Ppl will downvote you for this but I appreciate ur comment. I never play but I‚Äôm always amazed by how many players I‚Äôve seen playing from the beginning still abusing the grenade launcher/frog legs
---
Sucks
---
I feel your pain. I'm a mother and I'm 22 but sound and look like I'm 16. I've had rape threats screamed at me, etc. So yeah. Being a woman in the wasteland with a mic is an adventure of it's own. That's why I mostly stick with my boyfriend and his clan because everyone is chill there.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying just give it a go you will be surprised. And why is my post saying removed rule 6? Did I put something wrong
---
This is good to know... Sometimes my stash is laggy as fuck....
---
My friend with FO1st was wearing the mining helmet with the NCR Ranger outfit.
---
But yeah, anything with a nice coat, dark colors, or if it's bulky.
---
I had someone msg me(xbox) after we ran ACP back to back in a group, asking me if I wanted him to build me a colossal rug because he had been to my camp and seen that I only have the plushie and heads. I msg him back saying thanks and much appreciated but it wouldn‚Äôt feel right if I didn‚Äôt grind and earn it like I did the others. I‚Äôm a lvl 246 so as much as I love the kindness, it‚Äôs something I should do. I‚Äôve seen plans for it 10k and 12k caps in vendors but it‚Äôs not worth it. I‚Äôll get the drop eventually.
---
till you get your head bashed on something and yes i speak from experience lots of it lol
---
I guess I‚Äôm accusing you lmao I‚Äôm not sure I didn‚Äôt mean to do anything if it‚Äôs bc of me lmao
---
Agreed! I don't have the game but I'm definitely thinking of giving it a try. No longer know how the player base is on PC but since it's on game pass (pc) going to definitely try it out.
---
Why
---
I totally agree,  I started out as a Fallout 4 player and all I really wanted was someone to see my builds... I love immersion, multiplayer kinda ruined it but, this post is in the faith that it can be remedied. Hopefully 1 or 2 learn from it.
---
K
---
Sorry dude, I can send you a video clip if you‚Äôd like
---
You're *not* a douche. It's absolutely right to try and teach people how to fish. I totally get your frustration too, it sounds practically like you're playing with the same people...
---
I don't know if the few good interactions are enough for me anymore. I've had high levels taking all my free vendored noob goods, give people rare stuff they want and have them audibly snicker about how they didn't need it but wanted it to sell, list goes on and on. That's okay though, it's just like life. Valuable lesson to learn I guess.
---
Have a feeling I've met you in game already when I gave away most of the plans at whitesprings. ign - Lil\_Tyrone.
---
I have no clue why. Lol so it‚Äôs fine I guess I‚Äôll go read rule 6
---
That feeling will always be better than caps so as long as I get it I‚Äôll give almost anything for free/big discount
---
&gt; To add to all that, NPC vendors are more prone to exploits.
---
This is probably the primary reason the system is the way it is currently, to stop an exploit they found in testing.
---
I think they die quicker and used more than they thought, then just quit about 90 seconds in.
---
You're right it is funny. Kinda a study in human behavior. Keep grinding buddy, it gets weirder.
---
I wholeheartedly agree- started a new character to go through the quest lines again in the new era.  Like to bounce to different camps. Saw an excellent one set up like a church next to the river and was admiring the work when the owner showed up (PS4). Gave them a thumbs-up and next thing you know, I‚Äôve got a Fixer and a ton of ammo, plans for said fixer, and a nice spiffy nurse outfit. I dropped a set of plans for the Meat Tenderizer (best I could cobble up). My biggest regret was not getting my benefactor‚Äôs name, but then I‚Äôm old and forgetful about such things. So, another thumbs up to my unknown but not forgotten benefactor.
---
Yup and I really don't care of ppl downvoting cuz it's only my opinion
---
Another thing, stop trying to impress female toons by running them through everything. I play to experience a game. Not be handed godly stuff and walked to the gates of heaven.
---
No it works on adventure as well. Me and my friend were doing some quest and he got to the terminal before me and I was fucking around with the prompt and it pulls up the pip boy. You just gotta get like the perfect angle on it it's kinda annoying tbh
---
Updoot for both of you, thanks for your observations
---
Epic!!!
---
It‚Äôs not even really an opinion though. Outside of the ppl thinking they‚Äôre good for just hopping around like an idiot shooting a GL at their feet, it‚Äôs a fact
---
It really is
---
I could have went on and on about mic etiquette.. very divisive schools of thought on this one.
---
Don't you knock my yeezys I ate ramen for a year to afford. I'm true upper class. /s
---
Yeah but what does this have to do with them being scared? You‚Äôre saying they are quitting because they have to wait for too long
---
What platform are you on? I'm happy to donate as well.
---
Not just going in your stash tho. All lag is decreased.
---
Super nice
---
Hahahaha makes you think what the hell kind of kids we are raising these days right? Updoot and thanks for sharing
---
Nm.... just saw the xbox tag at the bottom of your post.
---
How long does it take to win the lottery?
---
I never understand these people who complain. If it is that big of an issue why don't you just sit on the terminal??? Nobody else can activate it if you're occupying it.
---
Sounds like a reasonable response to me lol melt away my man
---
Whenever I see a high level I cheese it out of there. GTA Online has conditioned me.
---
I hate that. Thus the post. Stay vigilant.
---
I have been on the pts several times there really is not much difference to how things are now.  Im level 326 on it and i nuked white springs and ran the whole thing with an explosive ten mill auto pistol and no perk cards equipped and had really no problems just jumped more lol
---
True then here‚Äôs what might‚Äôve been going on/might help cuz yesterday a bunch of people were trying to activate the encrypted terminal while this guy was taking way too long and the event was in jeopardy of failing. He finally started the thing with only a few minutes left but there were folks crawling over him trynna activate it the whole time. Wear power armor and ur hotbox will be too big for people to get the right angle on the terminal in that little shack
---
I was guna offer you one
---
Theres a lot of new players that have replyed to this post. Maybe reevaluate your judgment?
---
Characters and lighting? On PS4 this game has one nice thing: landscapes. The view from the vault, some great high points like Seneca Rocks or Top of the World, all very pretty, especially when you can see distant weather like storms and radstorms.
---
Everything else is pretty hideous. Textures that were fine stop loading in, shadows are wildly bouncing around, ugly and pixelated... You can make an attractive looking character, but you better believe they'll look gross AF as soon as they enter a dark environment. I've never managed to have one look good in both bright and dark environments. Been around since beta.
---
The only solution I have is to wear PA or headgear--at the minimum sunglasses and a hat to cover my face so I don't have to acknowledge the uncanny valley every time I look at myself.
---
I legit just got one for 3.5k caps like an hour ago. How many caps were you looking for? Just wondering
---
I grab all 3 pylons and tank him.  It's an entertaining experience.
---
50+ stimpacks
---
A mule account with empath / sharing lock and load (I am fortunate enough to have a second account from when bethesda was letting you link steam to the launcher.)
---
Blocker 3
---
Fireproof 3
---
suppressor 3
---
A set of T65 with emergency protocols
---
Vampire gatling plasma with FFR
---
Vampire explosive MG42 for when things get spicy.
---
Wife runs a heavy PA and uses her trouble shooters minigun.
---
It's a wild ride.
---
There is a tr@ding sub you might be acquainted with that is the best solution for your troubles.
---
The players get to choose when and how they grief when they do. Why shouldn't other players decide when said grief needs to be punishable?
---
Well, for what it's worth, you read mine and replyed, so I did the same. Bit of advice, drop the old /s for comments containing sarcasm.. its helped me
---
No I was just wondering how long it would take doing riding shotgun
---
When did they change suppressor and tenderizer, I thought they each did 10%.
---
As others have said, RNG my guy. It‚Äôs either a b*tch or a godsend.
---
I'm terrified, because I'm worried it will make overworld enemies a complete joke, just like One Tamriel did in ESO. Post OT, questing in ESO became the most boring thing ever from a combat perspective, because everything became a three hit kill. Imagine a continent of lvl 1 invader robots and you get the idea. 
---
Idk if One Wasteland will have that problem, but the fact that they're hearkening back to OT and ESO scares the sh*t out of me, and I say that as someone with thousands upon thousands of hours of ESO playtime over the past five years.
---
Oh ya buddy that's gonna happen. I  feel you.
---
Maybe your pc/console can't handle the game
---
Three VATS shots from my Fancy Shogun and I would go back to sleep.
---
Oh ok. I'll try it out a bit and see what I get. I have fo1st so if I hop servers can I keep doing the event?
---
300x3=900 pounds,  max Wright is 2000 pounds
---
Unless op was over 1100 beforehand, this can't be it
---
Lvl 390 here  i rarely die in event but i have 3 times in last few days and the game wont load back in i have to quit game then rejoin team if im on one if im not then i cant continue in fight
---
They should hire ppl that made really good mods in ps4 and help out fallout 76 tbh
---
Yes, if you switch between private then public back and forth IIRC.
---
So much this. Beth listen to OP‚Äôs wisdom.
---
K gotchu thanks
---
When Bethesda auto-complete the challenge for the purveyor sale I'm going to sacrifice thousands of scrip to Mumbles and the only thing I'll get is overencumbered with bullshit...
---
220 221....whatever it takes.
---
yeah when i seen the post i thought it was you.  when ever i get them ill hold onto them till i catch you.  I really wanna see how this turns out.  if you need anything else to help you along the let me know ill do what i can
---
This is how I wear mine. Really like the look of it.
---
The large post is me trying to be accurate and concise, the large amount of likes is due to the fact that a lot of vets have this problem. You not experiencing it I can only guess is due to lack of your involvement with other players? Idk, it's a thing for me and apparently a lot of other players too, and I'm on ps4
---
GS is better since ghouls don't really have armor
---
Pretty sure they've been the same since release. Here's an old perk card list that was never updated [link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bzzzju/nuclear_winter_perk_cards_list/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjb95GqktbrAhWHWM0KHVv4C-kQjjgwAXoECAkQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw2qmqFAHZzmUaF0gNFmq2V0)
---
Campfire tales, I like hearing the story while getting penetrated by bloodbugs
---
+1 it was a hack.
---
I‚Äôve only completed it ~5 times now but I swear it is tougher than the SBQ.
---
Good thing is I‚Äôm swimming in screws.
---
I'm at the stage where I have everything I could have ever wanted except for the items that I need to use modules for.
---
I always kind of sided with the point of not raising the limits but now I understand it. I'm over level 500, i max out my scrip literally the second it resets or I log on and so I find myself selling items I could use as scrip to vendors for caps I don't need anymore. 
---
I think at the very least scrip should be like caps where if you buy something, the scrip pool refills just a little bit more. Like you say though it's most likely never going to change so meh.
---
Never done that event gotta do it sometime
---
Fuck bud, I'm so glad that never happened to me. That must've been killer,
---
Thats true from my two characters ill be hoping for 3-4 usable items but we'll see, who knows maybe we will both be rolling bloodied fixers,bear arms and tendorisers.
---
It‚Äôs great, have the possibility to reward possum badges in case you didn‚Äôt/don‚Äôt want to grind challenges for them
---
I was once getting harassed by a low level. I had a powerfist build that was quite powerful but it wasn‚Äôt bloodied but I still used adrenaline reaction and many defence perks. I got annoyed so I hit him and it turned out that it was a trick. The idiot was in a team with a level 40 and 50. I was only a level 60 at the time. You think the low health guy with adrenaline reaction but no bloodied weapons would lose the 3 vs 1 but surprisingly theirs weapons were absolute rubbish Orit might have been thrust perks because I was jumping around and punching the pickle juice out of their skulls. In the end I learnt that it is ok to fight anybody if they started it because they probably have the amount of brain cells combined to make a grain of sand. 
---
Thank you for listening to my Ted Talk
---
Radiation Rumble for the constant action.
---
Lode Barring for exploring closed areas.
---
And most importantly, m√ñth want l√Ñmp
---
Oh man. Brutal. Sorry to hear that.
---
We gotta understand as vets that they just dont get it. We gotta help them understand lol
---
Yea i think if anything would change in that system it would be soemthing small like the return of scrib when buying stuff. I wouldn't mind that tbh.
---
I would go with anti armor I can never tell a difference with those guns trouble shooters also
---
Pics please! Console pleb here.
---
the original cartoon trailer implied we would be able to build a bot for our camp but it seems like that was cut, even though Bot Stop would absolutely function for exactly that
---
Seriously!! Omg I need to do that
---
Like the other guy was saying...they hide behind higher players and then grab some screws and leave.
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs a low chance, you‚Äôll not get every time
---
Still better than grinding challenges imo
---
wowza, had only seen maybe one or two of his videos....20 minutes of googling later methinks it's gonna stay that way....Plz let there be no Angry Turtle skeletons in the closet.
---
I think that's a joke, bro.
---
You should start messing with stairs and upper floors. You ain't seen nothin
---
Dont let the ones who fuck up your chill ruin it for the ones who actually deserve your help. Theres a life lesson there somewhere.
---
Yeah will it give tadpole badges too?
---
Yeah, I've seen it too. Maybe twice in the last week or so.
---
Flamer
---
There are definitely a few (maybe more than a few) hacked weapons on PS4. Usually in the hands of griefers. You can find some of them showing off on YouTube. Although Beth has made improvements that limit how much griefing can be done compared to the early days.
---
The Halloween one mischief night I think
---
Also in this vein, public text chat is a BAD IDEA!
---
Why? Toxicity. It turns the server into a crappy SA forum, and creates a nightmare for moderators. One reason the community in fo76 (as in Dark Souls III and even Destiny 1 &amp;2) is so much less toxic than that of ESO is the absence of text chat. 
---
It's like this: imagine if on the freeway people had the ability to broadcast their road rage to everyone else on the road in real time. That's what server-wide public text chat is like.
---
I don‚Äôt know, I only know it rewards possum badges
---
AA is more of a general purpose. TRO does work, but it's barely noticeable because robots usually have some good armor. Running a full TRO build is fun in encryptid tho
---
Longshoreman outfit looks pretty good imo
---
K thanks
---
Then they should have made the game/console better.
---
On the 15th with patch 22, unless something happens and Bethesda has to hold it back, in other words don't get your hopes up...
---
I didn‚Äôt know that I started to work on getting my backpack but got sidetracked and now I‚Äôm lost lol working on it slowly
---
\*todd rays
---
No problem explosive fart
---
Ok
---
The vendor at white spring resort was where I found mine
---
Bah.. you can handle a 30cap sink. Throw on the traveler card and go on your shopping spree... this kinda thing is more common than coming across anything good. Gotta sort thru a shit ton of sand to find them gold nuggets. If you're lucky.
---
The other day I was taking a stroll through Whitespring, and a lower level ran up to me practically demanding trade. He was a squeaker, but I felt like doing something nice. He had Nuka Cola Vaccinated, which completed my collection, but then he attempted and begged for ALL of my .45 ammo. When I declined he followed and begged and I just ended up leaving the server. Please don‚Äôt be that guy
---
Auto-Stim for life...literally
---
Exactly. I only buy them when I see them for 5-10 caps. To be honest, I'm happy with the ones that I gather in real time. Every couple of months I go on a big treasure hunt. Kinda stupid as you get overweight after about 10 troves, but it keeps me amused.
---
If i use my card I dont leave the terminal until I want to start. Since slap damage doesnt exist anymore and I run passive and the way PvP is setup now I can give two fucks less how much you shoot me. All you doing is wasting your ammo.
---
You got the right idea
---
The last time I ran Encryptid I used a card and did the whole event without realizing my game had glitched and not given me credit for participating. RIP event rewards and imposter squatch drops. At least the sheer number of robots got me two levels and not ONE but TWO nocturnal one stars. 
---
Beware of logging in at the tail end of a server reset.
---
Ive found a couple haha, and honestly I havent removed the travel card since I unlocked it, I cant imagine how much crater to foundation is without it
---
I was guna be nice and do 1k but thats not a terrible price you got it for
---
All events; Treasury Notes. 
---
Recently raided Vault 79 so I need a lot of bullion for my Secret Service armor.
---
Nice never thought of that now he‚Äôs a tough boss
---
Oh man, thank you! That's all very helpful. I'll look to those locations instead. My gears stash can't handle building up these mineral excavators and turrets anymore haha
---
The event isn‚Äôt really a reliable method of getting the badges if the event is your only source of getting them, it‚Äôs just a nice bonus to the event that it rewards possum badges sometimes. 
---
I didn‚Äôt bother with my possum challenges at all due to how boring they are, I just wanted the high capacity backpack so I bought the mod off someone. I‚Äôm not in a hurry to get the other backpack mods so whenever I have enough badges from the event I‚Äôll buy them
---
If you want to work on your backpack mods then doing both the event and possum challenges is the best way, but buying the mod is the fastest way lol
---
You can cuddle with him when having a full set ":D
---
Yup, it's all a lesson in human behavior. Live and learn and maybe take some 76 lessons on real life sometimes.. stay vigilant
---
It would be an easier implementation into the already terminal style machine.
---
Face it Bethesda, who ever decided it was a good idea to reuse/repurpouse the SMART machine in watoga high school to become the ammo converter that person needs to get demoted to doing just Janitorial work.
---
I've not had this issue while playing NW. I'm on ps4 and definitely have this issue during SBQ but not in Nw. I don't think I could play if I did.
---
Thanks I‚Äôll do both I have so many skins and can‚Äôt use them
---
Honestly, 5-10 caps is a steal. Ultimately I'd say they're probably worth 50 caps, but that's only because if you have 3 friends or \*cough\* 3 alts \*cough\* you can pretty much team up, and if the friends stand around while you're opening they get something like 8-15 caps plus either junk, a stim, a droog, and I haven't confirmed the rest of what it drops for party members nearby.
---
Yeah it isn't. I would have done both ahaha
---
Yeah this sucks. Same with Gatling plasma.
---
I use the Pleasant Valley blue one all the time.
---
Morgantown or Charleston stations are places newer/lower level players are more likely to benefit though.
---
Sounds like your a little too nice .. I‚Äôve helped three people out in a a year because I stubbled on them trying and falling short so I was able to make there day .. that‚Äôs the only unexpecting experience I want in fallout 76.. i‚Äôve been where you are and they seem to never appreciate because they haven‚Äôt done the grind.
---
I started in some Troubleshooter's gear but found myself switching to the CSS pretty early on.  I use Bloodied pipe revolver, not sure if this does more damage than the lever action but it works great for me (uses Rifleman and Gunslinger perks).  Try to have max rank in Hacker and Picklock, these will help you avoid some stuff in there.  Take it slow and kill everything, especially turrets before you try to do anything in the launch room.  Try to hide in out of the way areas or at least keep as much distance as possible between you and the enemies.  I don't equip the Sneak perks with the way I play but I do use Covert Operative max rank and as many damage increasing perks as possible.
---
All this being said, they are screwing Rifleman builds hard in the next update so may as well start the switch to Commando. :(
---
I liked the first few days of Fasnatch, it was like a community building event.
---
Tip to combat the telporting-hacks of stairs:
---
1. Place item you wanna place under the stair on a rug or doormat
---
2. Yeet that mat under the stair
---
3. ???
---
4. It just works
---
Wish I was around for that
---
It happens less frequently in NW but it still happens enough times to discourage me from playing, I prefer dying to my own mistakes or the opposite player being better than me and not because the game prevented me from moving or shooting
---
Now that‚Äôs an image
---
Other than acp newbies are always welcome, just don‚Äôt expect to be stimmed during encrypted
---
Many people have specified blue suitcases because the blue suitcases at stations hold a lot. I'm not actually sure there is a limit.
---
I dont know what to tell you about men and thier propensities to mansplain and heroicize, vestigial chivalry maybe? Guys are dumb, we think with our dicks.
---
I take it you didn't have any other pet at your camp when he reappeared? I wonder what caused it to happen.
---
Try the Firebreathers or Responder Fireman outfit.
---
Gotta love the name. You're one of the few people who point it out. Oh where my 8 year old mind thought was funny in that point in time.
---
Teach them, so that they may learn.
---
You seriously encounter people on mics frequently on console? I‚Äôve only been playing since the start of this year but I‚Äôve maybe encountered an entire handful of players who‚Äôre actively using mics unmuted throughout the world. Even during large events like Fauschnaught.
---
Definitely understandable
---
One Violent Night.  I like the story, I like waves of ghouls and it's super fun with a big group when you can jam out on the mouth harp.  The event is an homage to Beowulf hence the 'extra' challenge to kill the wendigo bare handed.  All that, and the Son's of Dane crew would have been great to party with. 
---
It's not close, but next I'd put Project Paradise, was a lot of fun when it first came out and people actually bothered to learn how to do it.  Mischief Night was great too, but way too much for the servers to handle.
---
I did... with my power fist. I would like to say that they shot at me first every time I killed them
---
Usually every few months or so, tho a few have never returned.
---
Nothing goes over the cap. Period. But keep in mind its 110 per projectile.
---
Some weapons can seem to go over the cap, killing players in 1 or 2 hits. But this is due to mostly legacies that can deal huge damage per projectile with multiple projectiles thanks to beam splitter.
---
Yeah one violent night is fun
---
lol yeah, some players are quite funny. 
---
I sometime get players staring to walk in my camps, right after having rushed to me vending machines. They look into their pip boy, walk around, look back into their pip boy. It always makes me laught but i love it. It makes me want to make my camps look even more real. üòÖ
---
I gotta start doing some events then
---
He's pretty common for me in The Mire, I see him most days when I'm running up and down the roads doing my dailies there
---
Aliens are not in the game but the Flatwoods monster is a very rare random encounter.
---
Quick question where do you get the mining mask? It's a loot drop right? Thanks in advance!
---
The challenge says that I need 3 aliens AND 3 Flatwoods monsters
---
Haha it‚Äôs a stupidly funny name so I had to point it out, but it‚Äôs nice to see that you‚Äôve been sticking with the same name you had since you were 8. 
---
I‚Äôve been sticking with mine since I was 10 (it‚Äôs not this username though)
---
https://imgur.com/a/aFTPpU8
---
Sadly it‚Äôs impossible to complete atm
---
You make the in-game friend first, then they pull you into party chat. In game chat is unreliable due to blue screen, other issues. I have more mic friends than I really want, I've actually lied and told people my mic was broke or i was on the phone or some other excuse just to play in peace.
---
 It it still works the same
---
That event is too Wild Wild West. There‚Äôs no coordination. They should assign positions or something.
---
Yeah I dont know how anyone on this app takes me seriously man
---
It‚Äôs not real
---
Yo do you know if a full troubleshooter armor set will protect against Mr. Gutsys and their magicical 100% armor penetrating bullets lol
---
Bless this post. My friends and I have tried to help a lot of new players since the game started and we‚Äôve made some great friends and built some get crews as time as gone on but we‚Äôve also gotten a lot of players who we help one day and then suddenly they bring along everyone they know. So I feel that one deeply. It‚Äôs frustrating but we‚Äôre trying not to let it get to us too badly. We kindly explained we‚Äôll do what we can but also try and show them how to do it themselves as well, we‚Äôd rather help them learn and enjoy that part of it. Some of them took it really well and some got damn cocky and demanding but we just blocked them and carried on. 
---
Luckily people seem to want to learn and hopefully we can all continue to teach and in turn they also teach.
---
I believe it is a loot drop. I haven't seen one yet though. I kerp getting cursed shovels and 3* junkie shock batons.
---
No only possum badges and only after you finish the tadpole questline
---
Probably didn‚Äôt notice your name or don‚Äôt care enough to bother, but personally I wouldn‚Äôt take anyone less seriously because their name as long as they‚Äôre not assholes
---
You count as your own teammate so even if you are the only one on the team technically your ‚Äúteammates‚Äù are still ‚Äúclose‚Äù
---
It will always auto compete
---
Maybe you're right. I may be a little too nice. That help-a-newb buzz is a bit addictive.
---
Great movie.
---
That one was really great. I didn't see it on the map for this season, has anyone seen anything?
---
Yeah it's just funny I dont pay much attention to your name cos it looks regular but ExplosiveFart in all caps stands out
---
Did you switch over to steam from the bethesda launcher and maybe possibly do those quests before switching? It won't retroactively award achievements. I have 60/60 achievements unlocked on steam, so unless they broke something recently, it should be possible to get those achievements just by doing what they say.
---
It‚Äôs a team thing your looking for
---
They look really good on Xbox from what I've seen, it's just ps4 that looks ugly as fuck for whatever reason
---
So then why is it even in the game lol
---
Today  ? In 2 years ? Welcome to the wonderful world of rng ....i played over 2000 hours and still not seen a single "holy shit what a drop". 
---
Very annoying sometimes , but as i choose to play cant really bitch about it either
---
Hey drop my a message or something, Gt Nova Drone
---
No. Started on Steam the day they launched it on there.
---
Yeah man idk I might get lucky or not idk. As long as ur having fun that's all that matters tbh
---
This right here, the difference is 40, 100-60=40  
---
OP forgot he has a backpack on which is disabled when in power armor.
---
Project Paradise, Fasnacht, Mischief night
---
I'm on Xbox, 90% of the time it's awful
---
Yup. I getcha. That's why I posted it. The cold sad truth is, some people just dont know common courtesy. When too much is too much. I love me some newbs, helping them is as a part of the game as anything, it's great and feels great. But sometimes it's not so great and nobody likes being taken advantage of.
---
Love it, however a Mr White and Mr Black helmets would be cool
---
I have always liked distinguished guests. I don't know why but I think it's fun to get the tables set.
---
I always go to campfire tales, I like that there are many parts to it, but definitely doable alone if no one else shows up.
---
This post has fair points, I don't get the negative feedback people are giving it. There is a lot of players giving handouts to low levels, and while its normal in most rpg mmos, it gets a shit load of attention on this sub. I think it creates a negative impact on the new player experience, when their friends here about "oh a lvl 100 gave me x,x, and x" or they read it on the subs. It makes it seem like some players have hordes of wealth to give away, to the under leveled. 
---
I don't see this overall post as anything geared against new players, just the behavior they sometimes exhibit.
---
no because at that point the event is over, and the countdown timer starts, if you die after that, you spawn outside.
---
.... AND it just happened again to me... earle got me... died when stupid scope zoom wouldn't un-zoom so I could run...  then I got the respawn stuck issue. Chose my camp.... ended up dumping me outside the mine instead with no hazmat gear on... sigh... and I can't rejoin event at this point. Yay.
---
Probably because you could be in a solo public team and get the benefit
---
Yeah I'm thinking about doing campfire tales. What is the order of mysteries?
---
Yesterday I was in the middle killing one side. Another high level was killing the other whikst 6 or 7 50-100 stood around tagging.  The level 300 mined at 3 minutes left and full health on the 4 being protected. At 2 minutes I went and mined as well assuming the 6 or 7 in the middle would easily handle the incoming. Within one side being cleared of ore half the health had gone in the middle. I ran back and the low levels were just standing there not even bothering to shoot. Fuck this event. I shall now only use it as target practice from the middle and come farming
---
You think that‚Äôs hard, wait till you do the actual photo taking quest
---
Wow when everything goes wrong at once :(
---
I usually end up trading with them hoping they're just trying to buy ammo/stims/water, If they take longer than like 1 min though im out
---
I don‚Äôt rightly know, my guess was we were meant to have some kind of alien take over event but got scrapped. It‚Äôs worth noting that on the pts the alien blaster got a damage overhaul. Still worthless but they are working on it.
---
Don‚Äôt question Bethesda‚Äôs reasoning, it will drive you insane
---
An amazing fun quest line that starts by finding a body in a black and green dress. You must be new to the game?
---
No I'm level 80. Just never found out about it. I'll try it out tomorrow
---
No I got an awesome crew, solid hitters who blaze thru SBQ, Colossus,  anything.. I'm blessed. (Shout out to Viking3, ImperialShark, Ryboogy, I could go on for days) but the baby's, the newbs, they're a dynamic that is above and philosophically beyond that.  It brings home the whole "nuclear armageddon" feel. Helping out the less fortunate in the wasteland,  much immersion,  so very feels.
---
Hmm, always looks good on my friends Xbox, could be your internet connection idk
---
Would never work. Even in games with class systems like ESO with more equitable loot and xp gains from dungeons, a lot of times in random pubs you get players queuing for classes they clearly are not. In the end, just like most mmos, if u want the harder event/dungeon rewards ur gonna need to group with players doing the same. Cant rely on randos to do what u want them to do, if they dont want/need the completion rewards they have no obligation to mine just bc they showed up.
---
Internet connection? No it's not
---
Thanks buddy I'm glad you get it.
---
One is utility and the other is for damage. Out of the two I think cryolator is more useful, especially for stopping the SBQ and difficult bosses. But I like flamethrowers so flamers.
---
Oh wow, yes it's one of my favorites in this game. There are a few different spawn points to find the body. I know possible place is the railing overlooking the Charleston rail yard. Google can help you find others if the body isn't there.
---
Nah You sound like you‚Äôre jerking yourself off
---
It's pretty trippy ain't it
---
Man of reason
---
No my dude. There's a random encounter where you find a pipe venting some gas and a corpse with a note that said "PIPE IS LIFE". It's fun to sniff.
---
Dude ive never had a problem with ammo, i have a fixer and a handmade that i use.  I just built up 10k worth of 556 and 45 and refill the spent ammo with ammo of enemies ive killed.  West tek is your friend
---
Good job!
---
I thought the cake was a lie.
---
What annoys me with all this is, you can't attack player camps anymore so straight up what is the point of these limitations other than to prevent people making things that look good?  
---
There is flat out nothing beneficial in having placement limits and collisions outside of nuclear winter.
---
Be aware that one of the BIGGEST potential benefits of the Flamer is the perk "friendly fire" however UNLIKE the card shows it only heals when bashing making it no so useful, that being said my Junkies/ffr flamer with no perk card increasing damage still melts enemies(and ammo) for dayz, but apparently patch 22 will give fire resistance to many enemies.
---
I've encountered this guy at the isolated radar place a few times. turning the green guys purple, maybe he just wants to phone home  don't forget your tinfoil hat
---
Was this on Xbox yesterday? Because if it was I was the level 300
---
It was. Fucking annoying right. Easily could have held the middle if they tried
---
Good for ya! I bet you felt a ton of relief after finally getting the outfit/helmet to complete it, I know I did.
---
Yes it's worth it. My friend found it on Amazon for around 10 dollars. At that price yes. Lots of PS4 players.
---
This is exactly how I do encryptid anymore. If I get a chance to shoot at the imposter fine, but I run from pylon to pylon activating and spamming stimpacks. As long as at least someone does that and at least someone can deal decent damage to it we are good.
---
in that case good luck on your second character!
---
Are you on right now?
---
Yes it was. I have only once finished this event with max rewards. Shit pissed me off. We held the sides they could‚Äôve gone for ore. But no just sitting there doing nothing. I almost lost a uranium fever event tonight being no one wanted to fix the extractors. I literally had to run everywhere to fix them and barely finished. I feel as everyone don‚Äôt wanna do events anymore for rewards. Most events I‚Äôll just do on private server now being it‚Äôs being to get old seeing everyone not doing anything. But that event you need ppl but nope everyone is fine with just xp
---
Thankfully they fixed it so that PvP is personal, to stop teams from getting dragged in to one members fight
---
But she didn't get the reclamation day achievement either...
---
Still works, I'm on a private server all the time. Just make a public team.
---
I‚Äôve all but given up on the Purveyor. You‚Äôve restored my hope!
---
No unfortunately :( I will be tomorrow!
---
The event only ever gave me two badges out of thousands of times doing it. I ended up doing the challenges myself and got the 8 badges for the high caps backpack
---
3rd times a charm!
---
I wear the mountain scout uniform with it, looks decent enough for me
---
Eh.. Yea.. Arks was a pain as well with all that "you can't place that there" in situations that just make no sense.. That's a large part of why I stopped playing ark. I went through the trouble of building a massive structure with giant doors and a fancy windowed front, and everything, but gave up when I couldn't even put a proper roof on it because of the restrictions (I'd made enough compromises already up to that point)..
---
You will still take some damage but it wont be much
---
Low levels that join your team and then follow you around. I am cool with them getting free fast travel and see the map, but when they won't leave you alone I just jump on a building while something high level is attacking. "They look up and shout 'help us!' I look down and whisper 'no." I feel like rorschach from the watchmen
---
No probs
---
I used to put mine in trash cans at train stations, but don‚Äôt know if anyone really checks those. Now I just drop my loot bag right in front of the vendors at train stations. They seem to stay there for a good long while and they‚Äôre hard to miss.
---
matriarchs date back to fallout 1 you know
---
Awesome.  Good trade
---
&gt; It actually is kinda big deal for a sheer majority of players (I'd say about 98% of the playerbase), most of which play quite casually and will never get higher than level 100-200 (well, maybe some of them eventually will if Beth will decide to continue server maintenance for years to come). I believe they won't consider such grind reasonable at all.
---
The real problem here isn't the grind. The real problem is the mentality that you should be able to achieve everything the people who put a significant amount of time into achieving while remaining a casual player.
---
And that just chaps your cheeks to no end?
---
Bamyouredeadlol
---
I saw a group with multiple empty power armor chassis blocking both sides and it seemed to work pretty well. There were three people defending but none one was mining ore. I assume the point was to farm xp but it made the event doable for small groups. You would still need two capable people defending and the usual two+ people mining.
---
Hmmm... I‚Äôm scared to try it, but maybe I‚Äôll try on a new character.
---
Since you are too low level for farming mutants at West Tek, farm mutants at the Prison and sell their weapons at nearby Grafton rail station.  Also the Mole Men in White Springs Mine - tons of armor, weapons and glowing meat.  You can easily collect 1,400 caps a day from vendors doing that run a couple times.
---
Damn they are as persistent as mole rats and die just as eazy... tough love... gotta be able to give it sometimes
---
Thanks for the answer though
---
some people say the rare drops have a better chance of happening if the pack brahmin are at full heath(use friendly fire near the end to get them there) but it is known &amp; confirmed that picking up the lost crates have no effect on loot drops, but making sure both brahmin does. That being said there are a few "rare" items that drop from the event but if you do it enough you'll easily get them all/
---
So your saying flammer is better right
---
Nice! What were the crafting materials?
---
I commented on this earlier in a different post, [here‚Äôs how](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/innic4/how_rare_is_project_paradise_backpack/g48l1at/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
No problem.
---
Sounds cool man, I'll send you a friend request when I get home from work later..I've noticed a huge slump in the game now recently, most are coming to the end of the RUN and are breathing out I think..many people not joining teams , less sharing perk cards..nuke strikes  have declined also.. almost every server I hop to only has around 50-70% max of players ..so yeah let's smell those flowers, I need inspiration to rebuild my camp..still in the same one from about 300 levels back (noob wood box haha)..the push for XP/score/gold &amp; leveling up for getting the legendary perks has kinda blindfolded  me/community somewhat I think
---
Cheese with that w(h)ine sir?
---
üßÄ
---
Like there isn‚Äôt enough in the game that people exploit, they have to ‚Äúfix‚Äù that? üôÑ I mean, their priorities seem to be on the same level as EA Sports...
---
THAT would be really nice...
---
The plan drops from Project Paradise. It‚Äôs one of those rewards that requires all of the animals to be alive at the end, and even then it‚Äôs a random drop. It‚Äôs not as rare as a bear arm plan or stim pack diffuser, but it‚Äôs still uncommon.
---
Yeah it does happen sometimes. I run a bloodied build and not an "optimized" one. I can do a healthy amount of damage to him but not like that. Still takes me at least 3 to 5 minutes, sometimes as much as 10 depending on the group. But today, I was in inventory doing chems and a lunchbox when the cave opened... finished up and went to drop down and it said finished... mine was collapsing. WTF? just wasted those chems lol, that's the first time it happened to me and I've done ACP at least 15 or 20 times now
---
I am always the one running to mine the ore because my weapons kinda suck but my power armor is good (thanks to a high level buddy!)
---
I‚Äôm always the one playing the music and making noise at the other event, also *shrug*
---
Is it worth having this gun primed? The ammo is a pain
---
Remember - it will happily fix all of your Van Lowe based needs.
---
You just gotta kill it quick enough and it won‚Äôt/can‚Äôt run off.
---
Lvl 10 Mole rat, meet lvl 68 deathskull scorpion
---
for general killing stuff yes. the cryolator has it's niche purposes which it is very good at.
---
I'd carry one if it had a syringe that made scorchbeasts land. I heard explosive bait worked but tried and they ignored it.
---
Thanks but how do you know?Did you try it and got it?Just wanna be sure.
---
Yes, I read that the best thing is to make sure you are on a team with someone in your event.
---
8-9 months still no giddy up buttercup ride Nuka PA skin 5 times in the same span.   
---
It is hit and miss. But I can almost guarantee the bogwalker won't be back unless it is a reskin. Probably more Jason-esq for halloween. Mothman has been in a few times already.
---
are pets being added?!?!
---
Guy pops me with a semi auto handmade, minium go brrrrrr
---
get a couple "good" 3* weapons you aren't going to use either bc of build or preference and sell them.
---
I've thought about switching to ultracite but I have so much .45 that I haven't bothered
---
Add me. Mack012166. I sell all my mutation serums for 175 caps.
---
Naw. It was in his past. He addressed the trolls who went after him. As a lesbian his apology was good enough for me. I still watch him.
---
What‚Äôs the deal with the screws?
---
What ? Work is fun though
---
Yes, it‚Äôs been found out that this is the method a long time ago. Nothing to do with how many animals you keep alive.
---
So outrageous that they were there first
---
Thanks man! Will definitely contact you once i play. The game‚Äôs still downloading cant wait to finally play it!
---
Pipe is life.
---
Any of the messengers. You get to fight lots of enemies and what not and it takes a while to do. It is impossible to one shot something and finish it in 3 seconds.
---
Thank you very much!
---
I was just saying the same thing the other day to my friends.  Being able to use the social menu on loading screens is a feature that I miss.
---
I‚Äôll take some!!
---
Yeah, I‚Äôd definitely be shitting myself. 
---
Also, I lol‚Äôd at Ted Talk
---
I‚Äôve killed 3 so far, disappointed with the drops.
---
got into a fight with a Mothman as a low level but he got away, been looking for one ever since.
---
The sense of entitlement is astounding.
---
Calm down there buddy. Wanna help players cool good for you for caring to help others. Want to ignore them and play your own game also completely fine. Making a long ass 15 paragraph post complaining about it definitely not fine. Jesus bro get on with your life. Its fallout 76 who gives a fuck
---
For real, some camps are genuinely great and highly creative that I'll actually explore it lol
---
Dunno about that. But every time I get in we can never bring him down. He is way too hard imo
---
Well don‚Äôt get your hopes too high but I‚Äôd love to show you around :)
---
happy cake day!
---
Do people know server hopping is a thing?
---
Did you join a friends server? Ask them to server hop too.
---
Lol I'm sure it looks absolutely baller xD I record all my builds and upload them, I like seeing my progression lol 
---
If you're on PS4 then yeah I'd love a tour :D
---
I think , but very unsure that it can drop when completing with 2??? friendly animals alive . I have it but dont remember getting it lol
---
One guess: You live in an extremely high volume/traffic area or a quest spot?
---
I've had that message, oh, never? Plenty of space in Appalachia that isn't immediately outside the usual joints.
---
Well for the record, I'm on PC with some beefy specs. It's unfortunate the PS4 isn't as optimised.
---
Let's find the culprit and get them banned , the audacity of taking this person's camp spot, i can't believe the community is filled with these camp spot stealing toxic assholes.
---
Really? Those that are nearby get loot when you dig up treasure?
---
From my only time fighting a regular colossus, I‚Äôm fairly certain Earle has a larger damage reduction than the standard ones.
---
Still, kudos to you for being able to kill one solo. That‚Äôs no small feat!
---
Yup. There's no incentive to mine ore. It just means less XP and loot for you and probably the loss of some rad-x/radaway.
---
Ah I‚Äôm not but maybe I can record!! Idk how to on PC
---
Ah damn it I'm on PS4.. and you could use screen capture, have a Google, you'll be surprised
---
Honestly, if they just removing the penalty during the day, it would fix 90% of the issues with the effect.
---
Exactly, there's tons of spots that are equally good that literally no one uses.
---
From all I read here, I don‚Äôt think the Xbox is really up to the task of a hard ACP run.
---
The Earle's anger and remorse was too great. He would rather bring down the world upon everyone rather than allow himself to be defeated.....
---
Do not despair, the only ones cursed are those who refuse to get up after they have been knocked down.
---
It will be shortly. Still only 10%, though.
---
I frankly think that humans and players should have a separate effect, but this works too, considering humans are extremely squishy.
---
I saw some grey camps on the map for the first time yesterday. Not sure what it means but you can‚Äôt fast travel to them.
---
This whole part of this thread is fucking disturbing and I had no idea because I was born with a penis and grew a deep voice. I am so sorry to hear that you guys have been treated this way. Honestly,  in my crew, females get preferential treatment cuz we're a bunch of old pervs who enjoy the pretty voices in our ears. (We like to pretend you're all super hot and think we're cool for old guys) I hope it doesn't keep you from playing and please ignore the incel trolls who have no idea how to act around women.
---
If I report this thread as spam I wonder if the mods will actually remove it.
---
That's what the blood eagles and scorched are for tho 
---
Just seems like a missed opportunity to me, like at the very least the cultists could have some kind of unique abilities or something
---
As someone who trades a lot I keep low level items in my shop lvled for players of a serten lvl 
---
I make these when I have the resorses or have a challenge to do so 
---
Last thing I expect is getting Hearst becuse there isn‚Äôt a explosive compound bow at lvl 5 I make regulars for that 
---
But thing is these wepons sometimes take a lot of resorses to make and I don‚Äôt have the time to go grind those .
---
I use to have a idea how much resorses a item cost or ask the preson what they needed but it‚Äôs standard pratice to go cap in hand to high lvl players .
---
Ps anyone of PS4 want the winter fasnack I have a speare and would entire Tain real offers
---
for fucks sake bethesda. the flamer, while you have the perk friendly fire only heals when bashing? it‚Äôs really hard not to bash bethesda for shit like this. it‚Äôs so absurd it becomes funny.
---
Gonna be easier now with one wasteland
---
5 caps take it or leave it.
---
151 DMG is way more than mine even with all the commando perks etc.  Can you share your build?
---
I went to that site bravo location after finding it on a video, it was really disappointing to see the tent there. I managed to make it work by turning it into a garage of sorts where all my crafting benches were, but I don't understand why they would do that. And of course I now had to move because the area gets nuked for the colossal event.
---
Fisto bot to serve customers
---
3.
---
It can drop almost anything but what matters the most is the rare plans I guess :P
---
Holy shit bro that sounds epic
---
It happens a lot these days sadly. It's due to hacked weapons or bugged/magic weapons.
---
Damn, I see you have Hard Bargain equiped. üßê
---
Better yet bottle it so we can drop it into drink dispensers.
---
I'll give you this Platinum Chip I found in a dumpster for it
---
No, this is Patrick
---
Perhaps they have broken something, I started a new character on the steam version when it released and I unlocked my last achievement a few months back. Its entirely possible one of the updates released since then broke the achievements
---
Lots of good tips here, welcome onboard and have fun!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i4xzzx/need_some_help_as_a_beginner/
---
Good to know
---
Stay to the left on the map, do all the events that come up, join a public team, scrap weapons to learn mods to build better weapons. Don't try to go too fast. Explore everything there are fun things hiding everywhere.
---
You can still launch your own nuke, you‚Äôre not locked out from doing it yourself.
---
Never give up hope!
---
i like to build out on the golf course nice and flat plus people pass though it all the time looking for stuff or fighting ghouls
---
I'll sign that. Only lvl 115 but I help new players by selling double plans and Stims very cheap. When I hear a screechy microphone user I switch locations. Since day 1 in FO76 when I created my character and was trapped with one for 10 minutes in the vault. Urgh, annoying.
---
Not as much as someone who can't dodge explosives.
---
Love this idea and loom forward to finding your camp in the wasteland sometime!! 
---
I too take great pride in camp building, and albeit only some of it is for visitor pleasure i definitely build for role playing haha, please stop by some time, free crops, water, bed and music in a separate house by the vendor! 
---
Psn:afakasi1202

Good times.
---
Oh hell no, I'm glad I missed that experience
---
I have over 600 treasury notes lmao I can't get rid of them at 20 a day xD
---
Only had 5k leather. Can't help no more.
---
Nothing, unfortunately the ‚ÄúI am become death‚Äù mission is bugged out, i had the same thing happen on xbox one. It automatically completed the quest and i got the achievement for it even though i have never even touched a nuke.
---
Its very common for the mission to count as completed even though you weren‚Äôt the one who launched a nuke. This usually happens if someone in your group or even public team launches one.
---
Fortunately though this doesn‚Äôt impact anything else in the game, you can still launch nukes as normal you just miss out on the satisfaction of completing a mission.
---
Neither am I
---
I already donated 3k leather... I can't donate anymore üòî
---
Do a hard restart
---
Sure! Here it is! It‚Äôs not a perfect science for what I use but I‚Äôm running a bloodied build as well since that was my build right before I got the Fixer about an hour ago.

I‚Äôve been playing the game for a little over 3 (4?) months now. I don‚Äôt mind helping people out but come on, if I can figure it out in a few, you can, too. 
---
If you see another player drop something on the ground, don‚Äôt immediately rush over to pick it up. Especially don‚Äôt pick up my swap and then ask for plasma cores. 
---
Don‚Äôt go to his base and take every plant and then have the audacity to ask for Food buffs. You just took all of my plants, you idiot. 
---
Don‚Äôt come to my base and take all of my 0 cost ammo and then whine about me charging 1 cap for others. Grind it your fucking self. 
---
If you grunt and gasp into an open mic, I ain‚Äôt hearing you when you need help later. 
---
Overall, tho, most players are fun.
---
Thanks! I almost couldn‚Äôt believe it at first!
---
Could start a new character if you want to do it yourself. But its a bit overkill.
---
Oh god, I can relate to everything in this post.
---
What I really don't understand is where all those people are coming from.
---
I mean, no offense, but ever since this game landed on Gamepass it feels as if there is a massive influx in people who want YOU to play the game for them. Where are they coming from? What games did they play where it's perfectly normal to rock up to high levels and pester them for their help and free shit?
---
I literally had people who, the moment they got online, use the come here emote and expect me to stay with them until they logged off again. Yeah, no. I may do this when I have nothing better to do and you actually do your best to get shit done but expecting me to do everything for you? Hard pass.
---
Same for those annoying low levels who initiate trade with me. I'm level 600. What could you, a level 10-20, possibly have that I care about? Or, from their pov, what could I have that they can use? 
---
Stims, drugs, ammo, that's about it. It could, of course, be a mule account but I've had this happen like twice since the game came out. Besides, why would I want to trade with someone I don't know?
---
I had people come to my camp and demand free shit. Flux, UC ammo, fusion cores, PA upgrade, you name it. You can ask, nicely, no issue with that. But demand? Absolutely not.
---
The worst people, however, are those who join your public group, immediately ft to you, try to  initiate trade, get ignored and follow you around the map spamming the thumbs down emote the whole time. 
---
Don't get me wrong. I like helping low levels but the way it is right now makes me long for the days when low levels actually appreciated your help, not expected it. I don't need to be worshipped or respected for being a high level. I just started playing way before them. However, I also don't need to be treated like a subordinate that waits for their master to log on and order them around.
---
In short, if you are a greedy cunt I will treat you as such.
---
with the new communist fence it's actually a bit harder to get at the fusion core machine and work bench if you don't have a jetpack or time to go though the entire plant and lockdown override code
---
They will just autocomplete it again.  Don‚Äôt act like they won‚Äôt.
---
Damn if you were on Xbox I‚Äôd give you a starter package to get you going. In the beginning you‚Äôll want a decent melee weapon because ammo and crafting materials are a bit scarce. I‚Äôd kind of stick to the forest region until you level up a bit. But also don‚Äôt be scared to do higher level events, as long as there‚Äôs a few high level players there you can tag all the enemies and get full xp for the kills, it‚Äôs a good way to power level. This community is so great I‚Äôm sure someone will craft you some decent armor, weapons, and aid to start you out
---
The amount of times I hear people yelling at their kids while in mic. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Go melee/unarmed to conserve ammo. I assume you're high strength.
---
Im rocking the ranger 1st outfit
---
Tuesday
---
If they automcompleted even one of these, why did they lower the amount at some? That doesn't make really much sense.
---
Except that they weigh 6 pounds.
---
I was just thinking that I need something to stand on every single body I try to loot.
---
unless someone lockpicked my box and put something in there my BOS collectron has gotten stims and at least one pipe weapon
---
CANNOT REMOVE ITEM, IT NEEDS SUPPORT
---
Pre built structures are so nerve wracking to work with,  spend hours or days decorating it and if your half asleep while scrapping or moving stuff it can go poof in an instant. 
---
Worse is when your on terrain that clips through items on the ground, if you you try to adjust the items placement by nudging it just a tad all of the items placed on it will fall through the structure.
---
They have both.
---
I can't reach my leather
---
It's both the foundation piece and the upper floor piece from the same plans. I've used it to build a rooftop farm.
---
Go donate ur leather! Thanks for the reminder I gotta go drop some off
---
I'm totally okay with taking along low level players who are going to be a "deadweight" as long as I know about it in advance. When I do, I equip the perk quack surgeon which allows you to revive other players using alcohol and just grab a bunch of alcohol from my stash. I don't drink much otherwise so it's no problem.   
---
It can be more challenging when I haven't planned in advance. I don't use many weight reduction perks at this point so I don't usually carry a ton of extra stimpaks. So I've had times where I've run out of stimpaks entirely due to reviving other players &amp; then been unable to help them in the literal sense.   
---
So I'd say to just join a public team with some higher level players and then politely ask on the mic if anyone would be willing to take you along if there's a queen fight and say honestly that you might die a lot. Some people on public teams are more solo players who just join teams to get a boost in their stats or XP... they often don't use mics and may not answer. But other people actively  enjoy teaming up for events and helping out new players. So it might take multiple tries before someone answers who is willing to help, but eventually someone will say yes.
---
Hmm interesting... I should try this
---
Lowering the amount is the autocomplete.  We failed the ones they ‚Äúlowered‚Äù.
---
10mm SMG would like to have a word as well.
---
I just want a robot workbench I don't care if I have to pay for it :(((
---
Try this my dude. I was playing from the start and always had like frame dips and stutters, no matter the settings, including INI changes. While i had good fps on paper, game just doesn't felt smooth at all. Was browsing fo4 optimisation on YouTube like a week ago and found some advice. *Full screen windowed*! I always was playing on full screen, but right after i switched to fullscreen windowed it became so fucking smooth, also better fps in Watoga, try this, maybe it will help
---
When I see a low level player I throw them some bullets and a couple stimpaks and the I just do my thing, haven't encountered an annoying new player yet.
---
As an F player, I find the reverse to be an incredibly annoying issue. I don't want to be followed, friend requested, given everything, mansplained to, and handheld through the game. I want to play. Alone. And earn my own stuff. Alone.
---
Lmfaooooooo sorry bro that‚Äôs pretty unluck‚Äî I think there‚Äôs something about batches and certain effects are more probable at certain times or craft numbers or something but I forgot
---
Ah ok now I understand it, thanks but then it's not an autocomplete.
---
I had to server hop but finally found them

I've seen people say if you're on a bad luck streak like that to hop servers. Don't really know if it works, but next time couldn't hurt.
---
I would, but that damned **budget**
---
Yeah there‚Äôs no point going that far just for the satisfaction of completing a mission, that automatically completes itself even if a friend does it in the same server.
---
Since then i‚Äôve launched multiple nukes anyways so its not like it matters anyways, as i said lucky it doesn‚Äôt seem to have any impact on the game.
---
Put shadow distance on low bro, lowest setting in fo76 is 5 times bigger than ultra in fo4 (according to INI). Also, lighting are very demanding, it looks kinda same on medium
---
YES!  100%!
---
This guy who was obviously on his alt (because he had so much atom shop shit and knew names for all the things he "needed" found my husband and asked him for armor.  He made him armor, then he wanted a full set of secret service power armor.  Then it was ammo, then stims, then food, then guns, then caps.  10 minutes after my husband exhausted himself making a ton of stuff and then saying he couldn't anymore the game guy, same gamertag, level 350 decided to keep PVPing my husband's workshop because he wouldn't give the guy 25000 caps.  ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èDon't abuse people's kindness because you might fuck over someone deserving of that kindness who is just starting out.  
---
On the flip I was on my daughter's alt on my account, she's at like level 12, and someone who was a level 500+ dropped a bag of plans, sooooo many plans.  I messaged the person and said "hey I feel bad taking these I'm on my daughter's alt to stash extra plans, I can't take all these." They were so happy to help anyway and gave me so many plans, even valuable ones, they dropped 2 fixer plans (I was shocked) and they just said pay it forward.
---
Compared to other things released at the time, Bethesda's always been behind in the character looks department. 76 is no exception to this rule. Sure it's an improvement over FO4, but that's not exactly hard to do.
---
My wife and I would love to find a good group to do this event.
---
This has been a fun journey down the winding road of semantics.  I guess you don‚Äôt understand how community challenges are supposed to work.  We either pass or fail...as a community.  When the devs step in and lower the threshold to exactly where we were anyway, then they in essence completed it for us.  Thus the use of the term autocomplete.
---
It doesn't bother me at all when people on my team are having a conversation. If I am in the mood to talk, I may join in... if not, it only takes a few clicks to join or start another team. Sometimes it's nice to hear some friendly voices in the background when your city is semi-quarantined and you live alone...
---
Server hop for now
---
What id like is Bethesda to actually think through things. Structure things better. This would be fine and a good cap sink if the person that bought the recall card could determine the start. Or even if it had a long natural timer. How long has this event been live for???? Its not good enough.
---
just confirmed it's 3-15 caps not 8-15.
---
You can tame deathclaws?  I did not know that!  How?
---
I want a bladed shovel, crescent moon spade.
---
This is so true! It happens with the SBQ and Earle too.  People are wild.
---
I have lots of leather but I can't be bothered. What's the "reward" this time round?
---
True but I always found online games tend to drop graphics down a bit in order to handle performance with all the other character/players on the server. For a multiplayer game, it's pretty good (minus what others noted about the PS4 version)
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I have an extra you can have on the house.
---
YES, I have died so many times because I couldn't stim or swap weapons cause the Gauss minigun takes fucking days to wind down
---
Flat woods monster erased their brains.
---
Not wisdom, just common sense
---
The Purveyor Sale I believe
---
I've found there are quite a few interior areas like that.
---
I'm a guy too so unless their gay they already fucked up.
---
Finally found a Blue Ridge gas mask for sale for under 500 caps. Snagged it.
---
it's almost like Fallout 3 and 4 are just a shitty retelling of Fallout 1 with nothing new in it
---
Ok thank you! Do you think the bundle is worth it or no?
---
I‚Äôm level 21 still after playing for about 3 weeks. I‚Äôm still low level cause I‚Äôm roleplaying a coward but charismatic character who mostly explores/trades and when I see players higher level to me I drop all my collected bobble heads and magazines and they take which ever ones they want or haven‚Äôt collected yet. So far only one person has taken the whole drop of magazines and bobble heads but he probably just needed the lot :)
---
I think they need to add new rewards so that more people join. I‚Äôve done it many times to get the fixer and lost a few times because nobody had joined. I still don‚Äôt have the fixer even though the only thing I spend caps on is on the recall circuit board
---
However 76 also isn't exactly good at handling things when they get chaotic. Even on a high end PC frame drops are a thing you just get used to often. Heaven forbid the particle effects start ramping up in a fight. Compared to 76 a lot of current MP games do quite better performance wise and with much more chaos on the screen. Just look at how Panic Button managed to get Warframe (open world zones and all) working decently on the switch of all things even in the middle of all the action.
---
I've tried to buy railroad spikes a bunch. Sometimes I get far less than it said I would. Sometimes I get none. Once I got over 500 flares instead. The thing is a piece of junk.
---
That might make some sense at least, not sure about the history of lead in paints. Nothing to do with pencils though.

I had to ask a friend to help me with the lvl 52 Colonel Gutsys hanging around the lvl 25 quest for excavator power armor... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The master's hivemind is linked though both is hyper mutated Psychic powers mixing with the Vault systems connected to the west tech network in theory if the Master IS the Ghost in the Machine/The eyes that watch/whatever the Nightkin can scene watching them there is a good chance he can reach WV, after all The Master Lives

so does a two shot lever function similar to a beam splitter gun?
---
Left Arm haha. I went Legs, torso, helmet, then arms. Now time to get the ammo machine, and the Gauss pistol and shotgun.
---
Underrated comment.
---
Underrated comment x2!
---
My bad I was thinking fusion cores
---
Uranium Fever.   3 legendaries and a ton of loot and decent value weapons that i walk my over cucumbered ass to white spring station and can nearly cash in my daily 1400 caps
---
Obviously a stupid oversight on their behalf kinda like painted power armour being deleted if you try to drop it to show the individual parts to a friend
---
I know, but this was their first, they had to see what kind of junk we can gather as a Comunity, they had no idea what we can do so they did just random numbers.
---
The meat pile lag is soooooooo brutal, but hey, they're bethesda they fixed shit no one wanted fixed (walls) and did fuck all for any real problems.
---
The puns are strong with this one.
---
My favorite part is when the little girl screams
---
The raiders and settlers bundle comes with a large gardening beds that fits neatly on a single floor or foundation block. The settlers one is larger cause its on a train bed and the raiders one takes up 2/3 of a foundation block on the back of a truck bed. The settlers one has a larger farming area compared to the raiders but the raiders has more room for decor if you want to decorate around it and keep it on a single floor piece.
---
The foundation farm plot plans bought with gold has 2 variations I think. One has a split in the middle so you can go 50/50 and comes in upper floor piece and foundation piece. The other variant is one whole plot in a foundation or upper floor piece but without the splitter.
---
Lol they forced me to turn off my mike
---
I‚Äôm not sure where you get the idea that they just picked random numbers.  Do you work for Bethesda?  Please don‚Äôt defend their bad practices with straw man arguments and fallacy.
---
Sad
---
Most people don't want to wait a full 10 minutes. If 3 triple-digits show up for my card, I'm starting it right away.
---
A couple of badass looking Fire Breathers there,Gentlemen. Take the fight to those Scorched.
---
OH rofl well i hope to find it lol
---
I really like the goblin one. Looks great on my outfit üòé
---
What‚Äôre you talking about?
---
This happened to me 2 times today.  Once I died and glitched through the ground (thanks last laugh.) I couldn't get back in and eventually my game went into infinite load.  Second time we were at 3\4 through his second phase and I died.  I got to the drop down zone in the mine and jumped which somehow froze my game to the point where my xbox made this noise I've only heard twice before and turned fully off.  Like I had to unplug my xbox for it to work again. 
---
 I have left the event one time though when none of my guns would fire and they kept making the firing noise on my headset, but no matter which gun I used nothing happened.  I tried to die to fix it but I had to server hop.  ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The frustration with ACP is so high for me.  I've had more fails than wins, usually due to errors.
---
It would also open it up for new camp item like a pond or fish tank.
---
This game is similar to fallout 4 survival mode except the guns are set to normal difficulty in terms of damage and you can fast travel
---
Oh sheet, didn't know about that, thought I was super amazing fast all this time, but really am only very fast??
---
That‚Äôs adorable
---
So before I do ore runs I use the radiation emote that makes you barf then I run down, and hold all 40 until the last 30 seconds, unless we are super close to losing all of the workers.
---
Typically I have a mic but am not actually talking unless someone else comes on the mic and asks a question or asks me to join an event or etc. I'm female and unfortunately there are a few bad apples out there, so I typically don't just fire the mic up and start babbling away with narration about whatever I'm doing in-game ;)   
---
I'm most likely to talk to people when they stop by my camp while I am "home", cuz when I am at my camp I'm typically not distracted by being in the middle of a battle / quest / etc.
---
I cringe when she starts screaming, I prefer when she‚Äôs singing the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hunting bugs‚Äù song
---
I donated everything I could.
---
You can craft healing salve, from gathered stuff just around Flatwoods, plan rewarded from first quests. Also, take herb gathering perk, you will use it anyway for nuke zones later. Gather every herb you come across, there is some farm, not so far from Flatwoods, where you can gather 200+ razzorgrain and 200+ corn , that straight fast 400+ caps for low lvl (rhododendron doesn't sell to vendors tho, dont gather it). Gather every junk you find, and sell to vendor UNSCRAPED items which breaks to basic stuff , like glass, steel, cloth or wood (books, glass bottles and other common stuff). Also, hunt any animal (hello PETA lol), cooked meat is one of the top methods, to make daily caps and you also gain exp for cooking. Thats for low lvl. But my main advice will be: get closer to 50 lvl. You will have somewhat of a build at this point, and should be able to kill enemies no prob, guns from supermutants or schorchet sells good (Harper's ferry is great for that, because there is vendor in city). Cooked meat is a killer, especially glowing meat steaks (uranium fever event). Chems also sells good, you will have abundance of chems at higher lvl, thats why we give it to lowbies üòπ (super stims sell for 15c and boss events reward with them). Crafting some outfits, like marine helmets also good, but thats more advanced shit. Phew, thats sone fuking essay right here üòÅ feel free to ask any questions
---
I had this happen on Xbox when I was on a team with someone who dropped the nuke.
---
The only time we've had more than 2 show up is right after SBQ and then Encrypted, usually everyone goes to whatever event pops next.  Line in the sand never has anyone unless it pops right after a SBQ, at least in my experience
---
The mission has a tutorial that will walk you through it. But I had three characters where if you combined their levels it would've been 450+ before I launched my first nuke... there's really no hurry, it will always be there waiting for you ;)
---
To put*
---
Just imagine being able to chamber an mg42 in .50 cal or even .38 and just burn through all that excess ammo
---
It'd be pretty funny if the BoS shoot anyone with mutations on sight. I feel like that nuke line might imply they can randomly come invade our silos before we launch a nuke...
---
I agree with your general point about trying to have good etiquette, but I disagree with several of the specifics.   
---
1. I ABSOLUTELY want new players to send me a trade request. If they don't have a mic, how else could I possibly guess what their build is and what might be useful to gift them? For example, I'm not going to craft new armor for a level 15 who already has 3 star legendaries of every armor piece.  
---
7. I love it when people are listening to music. I love hearing the wide variety of music that people like and if I don't share their taste it only takes a few clicks to mute them.
---
Pipe is life!
---
Get the camo paint
---
The camo skin that is currently for sale.
---
And much more efficient than the ammo converter LOL.
---
 I met some dude last night who was the fucking best. He built me a explosive bullet rifle, showed me all these hidden events, aside from the fact that he was a genuinely good dude he also helped me in such a big way. But not to toot my own horn I didn‚Äôt ask for a single thing. I was more than happy that he was just letting me tag along to the events he ran every night. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll game again sometime soon. The point is If you go in expecting something from someone you‚Äôll never really meet anyone new or make new friends and you‚Äôll miss out on a ton of potential fun times. Don‚Äôt be an entitled dick and you might just truly enjoy the experience of meeting new people, making friends, and exploring the awesome FO76 with like minded people. This goes for life in general.
---
Awesome, thanks.
---
Something. It could be absolutely nothing I just thought it was weird and hadn‚Äôt heard that line before
---
They lowered it to encourage people to donate more. The only reason for events like this (in any game) is to take out materials out of the game to help economy. To prevent bloating.
---
Not one event like this has ever failed in the history of online mmo types of games. Not one. They are not gonna spend weeks and months designing these events and related rewards and then say "sorry we are gonna scrap these rewards, you didn't donate enough".
---
Thats wild didn‚Äôt know people can do that, i was wondering how id block terminal by being on it and would start randomly i said to myself weird.
---
You can get the plan from the Miner Miracle quest.
---
The mask gets put in your pocket after the event is over and you're out of the mine. Same as the plans and the cursed items.
---
I'll be nuking them as soon as they arrive unless the observatory becomes a protected zone.  For science of course.
---
Been saving up all of my Halloween candy for October,  where I'll be hiding piles of candy for people in my Silent Hill themed camp.
---
Man reminds me. So get this, my car was destroyed by some dingbat a couple years back and with the lockdowns and all I haven't left my house since last December.  (Beyond yard work)
---
Been scraping by, by ordering groceries online, been trying to snag some of the unique seasonal candies but every time I recieve my food the candy was out of stock or rather the delivery person was just clueless as to where it was located and couldn't find it.   &gt;  .&lt;
---
I've been wanting to go haunted house hopping for years but something always comes up to prevent it. 
---
(Ask my about my Bennett's Curse birthday debacle some time)
---
Can't get decent candy, can't go to haunted houses, neighborhood doesn't seem to trust each other enough for trick or treating, cant get the right groceries delivered half the time.  
---
Gonna be a lonely birthday and a sad Halloween.  
---
Really hoping Bethesda enables me to help others enjoy the season a bit, even if only digitally.

I honestly think that both of those would be poor choices on the part of the BOS, at least in my case.

If your post is not about making a trade, please [message the subreddit moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) and they'll take a look at your post for you.

Bethesda is scheduled to donate 51m tomorrow.

I've seen three colossal wendigos in Sundew Grove recently, and killed three sloths after seeing none for months. Either I've just gotten luckier the past two weeks or something has changed. 
---
Are the buzzy things honeybeasts perhaps?
---
I use magic weapons on him and it takes forever, 18min solo.
---
I agree. But let's also talk about stash space if you play mulitple hours a day..
---
Whenever there's a low-level trying to trade with my lvl 143 character I'll just take out my burning pitchfork and poke them in their buttocks. Do I look like I'm a donation organization? Heck no, but they won't listen.
---
The other ones are the ones that always invite you to their team all the time. I got the lone wanderer perk for a reason, and that reason is I rarely play in teams. 
---
Had 2 low-levels trying to trade me while I was afk, and they blocked me in a corner and when I hit them to make em move, those geniuses shot me. They were around level 15.
---
And when I shredded em with my ex LMG, they just kept on pressing revenge. They tried at least 5 times and 5 times they died a horrible death.
---
They did not understand. They didn't learn a thing. They kept on pressing revenge. They didn't have the ability to think of surrendering or running away. They did not stand a chance and then they wrote me hate mail saying I was the a-hole, while they just could have left or run away. I even gave them the chance to run but no, they just tried to throw nades at me. 
---
TL;DR : Don't  trade with high level players if you're a low-level, you'll honestly just annoy them.
---
Also don't keep on insisting on pvp when you've already died 2 or 3 times, you'll just waste your time and caps.
---
Ohhh, is THAT why? It really confused me the first time it happened because I do occasionally take workshops but it's quite rare... and nobody on my team had a workshop
---
Attach a short girder to a foundation that's as high as it can go, then the second foundation attached there will then snap exactly half way down,  then ull just need to finagle stairs to place your floors. Hopefully the plants dont get blocked due to the lower height. If some do and not all, keep the short plants on the lower level, might need a space to walk by them, as I believe you cant duck under half way up obstacles.
---
Look into blueprintimg plants to get them to sit closer together, especially for irritable plants like corn.
---
Never seen this done before for plants tho so will be interesting to see if it can be pulled off.
---
Purchase mini nuks, you funny or what? Only thing Mini nuke  and missiles are good for is feeding the ammo converter;)
---
How? unless One Wasteland changes the drop chance of 0.03% I don't see it getting easier.
---
Sometimes when that happens you just need to add more foundations to where at least one is squarely on solid ground,  seems of one should end up floating or too low under the floor it can sometimes cause that irritating effect.
---
It's very much not an exact science. Alot of herding cats or in this case glitches.
---
Sadly, someone on this sub did it and lost 40K of ammo credits.  Fortunately that someone was not me.  Haha.
---
5% rewarded when the event complets. Not dropped from the boss.
---
It's definitely frustrating. I've found it helpful to put my camp in an area that's consistently high traffic (currently it's next to Foundation) and sell the runover. Lots of people will buy 3 star "crappy" legendaries just to go scrip them if you price them low enough... and at least that way you are getting something for your time and effort.   
---
I also like dropping them off for lower level players who aren't yet strong enough to do fights like Colossus. Gifts are not uncommon but players who show up and drop a bag of 3\* legendaries are less common. It frequently gets a very enthusiastic reaction since some people who are newer to the game haven't learned where they can reliably farm legendaries yet.
---
90% of the time there are no tendered textures on Xbox, it looks like a roblox game lol
---
Not really. Everyone complains about explosive weapons but they‚Äôre deadly in the right hands. You just don‚Äôt know how to use them
---
Not to be mean but saying that you give women ‚Äúpreferential treatment‚Äù because you enjoy the ‚Äúpretty voices‚Äù is literally the problem.  Don‚Äôt pretend we are all super hot. That‚Äôs very creepy to me. I just want to be treated like everyone else honestly.
---
Could be hacked Tesla's or probably hacked cryolators with 10,000 base damage, especially if they are heavy gun or rifle build everything just stacks up way higher with those guns it's ridiculous. New thing I have seen Alot recently is hacked guns bun they are invisible to other players you just see the person holding a gun but can't see what kind it is and they make no sound so that is also out there. 
---
Be safe out if wild west of PC wasteland.
---
I like encrypted and project paradise, I actually find they have a higher fail rate than acp or the Queen, and people rare run them. Shame, because I like how unique they are.
---
It's me xD... How's it hangalangin
---
Great post!  I had no idea this existed and now I have something new to do!
---
Oddly enough, I just recently discovered Freddy Fears has a basement.
---
I'd be fine with something that converted regular ammo to ultracite using flux from my stash.  Even the ammo generator should have this option IMO.
---
You can use campfires to place crops on, so no.  Just use them and save your bullion for something else.
---
ü§£
---
There needs to be an alternative to moving legendaries once the caps have been reached, at least let me scrap them with a 1/5 chance of creating a module or something.
---
On days where I‚Äôm doing multiple events I‚Äôll end up often with 10 more weapons that I can use
---
...then delete the post
---
Personally, no, just buy the farm plots with bullion.
---
That‚Äôs really cool man especially since those are sets people‚Äôd kill for
---
I never asked anything, since beta too. I experienced, discovered and tested pretty much everything on my own. Near this period, we were all relatively new, it's not like we could easily find help.
---
I went thought the whole main storyline on my own. 
---
I took the decision to grind workshops and events by myself, as i was too weak to go thought Wagota. 
---
I started to play a lil more with these workshops for ressources and fusion cores to eventualy be able to launch my first nuke, on my own, with my normal laser gatling. 
---
I started to grind lvls for perk cards that would make my life less painful. I mean learned how to survive the Appalachia and become self-sufficient...and rich...yes...rich !
---
I even eventualy reached point where i could work on multiple build for the same character. Ask me if i'm excited for Perk loadouts !? 
---
So i'm not gonna lie, yes i really like to help, but when someone comes to me and ask me if i can craft this or that or explain multiple things, i feel a lil insulted. 
---
I feels like all they want is go thought the game as fast as possible and leave the game for something less..."difficult" if I can say. I'm sure this dude really play this game...
---
I help alot...i fast travel a lot and also inspect newbies camps to see if he/she is really new (atomic shop items ).
---
But when i'm asked for help...üòëüòêüòíüòê...it's like...where are we going son !?
---
Do you think it's worth it for anything else in the bundle or no?
---
Ok. I assume you don't think the bundle is worth it with anything else either?
---
What are your thoughts on the raiders/settlers bundle?
---
The landscape and ambient lighting, to me, are superb. Sure, there are iffy moments of rendering, but from pea soup radiation fogs to the glowing creepy things in the Mire distance to glittering mornings breaking through the Forest, the lighting is tremendous.
---
I don't know, I haven't gotten them.  I don't think camp building is worth spending atoms on.
---
Don't think so, think its a plan from the whiteprings vendor? Can't remember though
---
Thank you
---
The 10th.
---
Hey what time zone are you, I can help craft weapons armour and ammo for you if you need it
---
No, never heard of this church but will google it for a look. Thanks
---
No I've been looking for a new pet but no luck and I guess for the best, I'm way happier with my first and original pet, was really odd how it just kinda happened today.
---
You need a $800 PC to get no issues.
---
I mean insofar as it‚Äôs making the Forest more worthwhile to spend time in while doing it
---
Thank you and lol
---
Line in the sand , I like how they All drop from the Sky in a nice bundle üòù
---
For now...
---
Thanks for sharing. Damn I need to get a ritual set for my ally now why didn't I think of that. Thanks man
---
Oh I know. I'm still to see any Max rewards from PP &amp; RR. They don't care though. Either they got it or don't want.
---
It's the problem with how events are rewarded. Succeed or fail, they still get rewarded. The guy running around the mine collecting ores only gets rewarded if event is successful.
---
See the difference?
---
I got everything maxed, but turn off blur cuz I hate it in games. If I pan around fast, my own eyes already need to focus, I don't need the game to screw things up further with some imaginary blur effect telling me things should be blurry.
---
Anywho, I have an AMD Ryzen 3 3.6Ghz, 8GB RAM, GTX 1660 Ventus XS OC 6GB, WD 480GB SSD and a 1TB HD and a bunch of other fancy gizmo stuff...... Can't say I ever noticed any FPS drops at any specific point.
---
I only got 8GB when I built / ordered the system, since I had another 24GB of RAM sticks lying around I was planning on sticking in, but turns out that the GPU is so honking big vs the Motherboard I selected that it blocks the extra slots for RAM. Technically it's not the MB I ordered, it's a substitute, as the one I wanted was out of stock. Oh well. 
---
There's a stutter here and there as I load into certain zones on the map, but otherwise no issues while playing.
---
...or place it somewhere else and move it to where you originally wanted to place it.
---
What's the trick to using them? They have 1 perk card that effects them. Pretty sure the only way to use them is to shoot them as well. Maybe a sneak attack. For 1 shot.
---
ox covered it ages ago during his shorter video's period. Some of the lore links are spread out quite a bit so it was good to see the links in one video.
---
This, Formula P is the best! ü§ô
---
That‚Äôs some level shaming douchebags. Sad fact is that they don‚Äôt even know how to play the game or how it works. People are just fuckin stupid in most cases. I‚Äôve seen and heard it all in 255 levels of playing 76
---
How old did they sound like?
---
Sweet roll!  The purveyor was good to me this week as well.  I scored an Instigating Explosive Handmade and a pretty nice Anti-Armour Combat Rifle.  I was amazed!  Hoping to get a nice Fixer next.  I do have an Exterminators Fixer with 25% FF, which is fun, but not an ideal prefix.
---
It was just a joke...
---
Level envy, pure and simple. Newer players attracted by the wastelanders update expected it to be like FO4, in so much as you could pick up the Overseers guardian pretty early on and basically take on everything. The levelling system on FO76 for me is a big improvement. Not everyone thinks so and it comes as a bit of a shock to them.
---
Is it just for a day? If not when does it end?
---
That's why duping is so popular in this game
---
Hold up, is that fence actually good at keeping things out? Can a marsupial player get over them?
---
Legend!
---
I see what you are saying, I'd rather just grab ore and up my chances for the real reward instead of XP.  I can get XP farming Westek or the DMV any time, max leveled legendaries too.
---
Agree. I understand the rush to increase the uptake of the game, but wastelanders added loads of new players. Myself included, but take it steady with the changes please.
---
Correct.... but not many people know this. 
---
I sit on the terminal at Cryptid before it starts and so far no one has ever started the event early.
---
This method has worked extremely well for me.

I got the gauss pistol and some mods for it first. I was unimpressed, even with a pistol build. Then i tried the shotgun and was blown away. That thing is beast mode without being an ammo glutton like the minigun. Invest in dense torso mods and fireproof though. I've blown myself up quite often with it :)
---
Future-Tec CAMP module skin is said to  be causing that.
---
Even with this route, your still gonna get shit on by Todd. This way you get a item you can probably use instead of blowing 1000 scrip for 3‚òÜ Medic Pipe pistols.
---
They called you ugly?  Dang.. thats harsh.  You doing alright?

Man, F those kids.

You can mod it and change your paint back so its all the same type, if you are not planning on wearing full camo that is

They are bitter because mama made them take out the trash after their "Accident" with the sheets last night.
---
I blame game pass. Its brought in a lot of new players, and sadly some of them will be dicks
---
me and my dad have many weird matching outfits! ita really cool we can still experience playing with our dads :)
---
Jesus that‚Äôs really weird to say something like that at that age I imagined a kid who plays fortnite 90% of the time
---
Then stop playing
---
I'm guessing 12ish.
---
Yeah pretty childish behavior. Like I get "trolling" or whatever but like this is just being an ass. I wish players understood level like 150 isn't that high these days, it's mid level
---
I was imagining that too
---
I swear to god all these challenges are bugged. I looked through them individually for the first time a couple of nights ago and it tells me there‚Äôs a bunch of stuff I‚Äôve never done. Kill a moth, scorchbeast queen and grafton monster are a couple of examples. I know full well I‚Äôve killed all 3 before and even killed mothman AND grafton monster last night but it hasn‚Äôt counted towards the atom challenges. Pissed because these are the last ones I needed to get to complete like 8 challenges
---
Bethesdas apparently been working on them stopping playing already haha
---
Haha.. I was thinking the same thing.  Possibly the most no brainer weapon in the game.  Point it over there, pull trigger.  Anywhere near and job done.
---
Is it Bethesda or your comp? I never get kicked out unless my wifi flickers for a moment.
---
I can't stand the Purveyor--however she recently gave out an Instigating/+10%Dmg/+15% Reload which is my main long rifle now. I love manual aiming in stealth so this fits my build perfectly. 
---
Within the same week her machine coughed out a Perfectly Preserved Pie too. I ate it as I killed shat.
---
This post is bitchy. That is all.
---
Oh its xbox and its just not me
---
Haha I'm feeling you on this. Went to Posidien to help two low levels power it up and a level 419 comes along and steals the workshop from them. 
---
Then I start getting all the hatemail and bs that it was me and that I killed them several times.
---
Oh, these people get their XP there too. They just happen to pick up any legendaries that spawn during the event while you're busy actually completing the event.
---
Same reason why people will focus down the SS during Free Range rather than keep the brahmin alive. One way gurarantees a legendary, the other doesn't.
---
I like the game its just the stupid stuff that pisses me off
---
.38 is far too small. And it already outclasses the .50 cal. If you let me chamber it in .50 cal, then that makes the actual .50 cal irrelevant.
---
In addition to this, switching to the PA view of your pip boy makes it come up faster and doesn't negate anything you do, so you can still reload guns/keep your minigun spin while in the pip boy
---
I think I came across you there today. Glad to see you got thru it all good.

You realise it's purposely terrible right?

Anyone else find it funny it's tagged as a "bug"?

Honestly i dont want to help people if first of all they don't give me any vibes of ever playing the game again or straight up being a complete d-bag and just outright making fun of a game that others can be passionate about. (To be fair this game isn't their best) some people enjoy it including me. So the sooner those type of players leave the better

I had one guy in a PA hovering around me and being frigging annoying while I was in one of my own vendors..... Which I just moved my camp and was in the middle of tossing all my crap back into them. I thought about exiting to let him browse but figured if he waited 5 more damn minutes, he'd have everything to look at and perhaps something he was looking for that I was still loading.
---
Sometimes there are reasons, but yes, sometimes people sit there for too damn long either AFK or taking way too long deciding what the heck they want to buy.
---
Just keep pestering them till they take a swing at u.. then vaporize them. Or you could do what i do.. give them fake glitches. Tell them to store 10 levels then delete and remake the exact same character and that character will have 100 stored levels.
---
This. When the game first came out it was just people who bought the game because they wanted to play. This means more happy nice people on average.
---
When you start getting people who just got the game because of game pass, it becomes more of mixed bag I am afraid.
---
Why would someone need that many mini nukes at one time?
---
Wait, you're on *PC* and you think these are impressive graphics? I'm assuming it's the only game you've picked up in the last decade?

To be honest, maybe a dozen new players are on this sub and I doubt they'll see it, let alone get offended.
---
It's a karma generator.
---
Humans are the best source. I‚Äôve gotten a lot from cultists in the Mire/Bog and also murder any non-hostile raiders and settlers you come across. You can also learn the weapon plan, farm mats and craft low levels to scrap.
---
I've been playing in xbox for 1.3k hours now and have only ever had a handful of disconnects. I feel like it's an outside problem, not a problem with the game itself.
---
This^ I have an item in each of my vendors for 30k as a small insurance policy in case that issue ever comes back
---
This issue is a death sentence for a bloodied build. I don't use spin up weapons anymore when the fight is intense or unpredictable. It sucks.
---
Uhhh... for shooting shit with mini nukes?
---
Smartassery aside, I am guessing either a mis-click or a planning failure.
---
No, they got it. It's just not a priority for them.
---
You'd like this kind of shit would be for most companies but Bethesda isn't most companies.
---
It might be time for this whole subreddit to realize that not all generosity is wanted, or that everybody universally appreciates it.  It's an entertaining gesture to want to help new players, but not everybody wants it, that's a possibility to consider.
---
That's how all MMOs go, buddy. Go get clowned by Chaos Dwarves
---
Playing quite a while this has never happend, occasionally find a naked lowbie so il just kit them up with level appropriate armour and weapons, because maybe they might just do the same
---
Right... Im calling shinanigans, sounds like something nefarious. Something is afoot at the circle K
---
To be fair, those two corpses in the toilet stalls were once bachelors who tried to woo the Purveyor and failed. Sadly, they both died of broken hearts.
---
So I am not sure if you should really consider them as a factor when determining combat strength...
---
Ask Bethesda.. IDK.
---
As a fellow Mothman enthusiast, this looks pretty damn great! I especially like how you used the stair columns to decorate the walls.
---
Personally, I prefer Mothman-themed architecture to more tribal/pagan-looking and less clean&amp;Christian-like (probably will post some pics of my own later), but your take is very impressive nonetheless.
---
So for less than a skin you want enough gold to buy an entire end game armor set? Yeah, really bad idea.

One has their mouth full of scrip, and the other is locked in a cage. There‚Äôs also no indication of what she‚Äôs using that scrip for.
---
Making more legendaries for her miner army?
---
Repairing mining equipment?
---
Repairing Vault 63 so we can enter it and face the source of the mole miners?
---
This is correct. ‚ÄúNight‚Äù is still 6pm to 6am with Nocturnal capping out at midnight. The amount of daylight has nothing to do with the effect. Only the in-game time.
---
no.
---
iirc when they nerfed 2 shot it's now 2 rounds at 62.5% damage a piece.  So each round is less able to pierce dr and you take a large accuracy penalty.  Unless you are getting a vats hit/crit (and vats is broken in pvp for most guns including lever action) you can't be assured that both rounds will connect.
---
Explosive on non legacies is easily countered in pvp as well so to answer your burning question: a tse lever is probably trash against a game opponent with good gear.  You might get a kill here and there but an equal skill opponent should enjoy a favorable kill/death ratio vs you and your tse lever.  or any ts lever, really.  rapid fire &gt; semi auto in the current meta.
---
The trick is having a 2 shot fatman.
---
Nah, mate, 's all good
---
*whistling noise intensifies*
---
A fat man with the MIRV can actually prove fairly useful at a colossal problem, but it‚Äôs definitely a small niche and requires planning
---
Lol its still a garbage weapon with extremely low dps. That's also not a trick. That's just a legendary effect
---
Why not allow it to follow us around. They can sell different skins and allow us to outfit them with dog armor and have them scale to our level. Use the same AI as dog meat from fallout4

Just initiate the event on a character that can solo it and it doesn't matter.
---
same here, just hit level 80 yesterday, been playing casually since day 1. I've only ever asked for something once in all this time and it was a glowing mass and glowing fluid I desperately wanted to finally make  my vault suit shielded. I have bumped into amazing people who drop things for me because they want to and I always thank them and try to drop useful stuff I dont need when I can. I also try to help on events because I very been helped a lot, again, with our asking. This community is awesome. I wish these new players realized they don't even need to be annoying to find kindness in this game.
---
Is it that impossible to think folks are not on Reddit and would not know about the tesla problems?
---
Actually I have almost 300 games on Steam, thanks. Single Player games usually have superior graphics, but most multiplayer games tend to shirk on the graphics where you can see the poly edges along the faces and such, and usually due to the amount of other players on the map.
---
I've got a few games that have single player campaigns and look great, but when you jump online, the quality is reduced a bit and certain effects or features are gone for stability or fps reasons.
---
But whatever, to each their own.
---
How do you get that?
---
Remember, it hasn't updated from the previous day yet. We probably have already finished the challenge.

You‚Äôd fit right in. My ally used to wear her swimsuit all day but now she‚Äôs just been wearing a bathrobe. We need someone to actually wear a swimsuit in the pool!

i run with an assassin‚Äôs explosive lever paired with weightless armor ( forchameleon mutation) and i get at least 2 shots in before they see me again so i do pretty well but i noticed that explosive effect does in fact go over the 110 dmg cap. what‚Äôs a good PVP automatic gun for stealth/ranged build?
---
Starts on the 15th.

Heh, that's around the time I start checking to see if they're on pacifist.

Secret Service armor is available to buy using Gold Bullion at Vault 79. You have to finish the Wastelander main campaign to get access.
---
Don't be ignorant. The graphics maxed out on pc look truly amazing, now the animations however... well they seem to be stuck in 1995. Like have you ever jumped in 3rd person with the marsupial mutation? It looks hideous, Jumping Flash on the Ps1 had better animations ffs.
---
It wouldn't necessarily have to force waiting. For example, on Radiation Rumble, it could give you 10 minutes to activate the quest. If you were already ready to go, you'd just start the event right away... otherwise, you'd have more time to gather more people to help.
---
No, it is not. Far from it. And I get why you mention it. 
---
I was just pointing out that ‚Äúsome people aren‚Äôt on reddit‚Äù is not a valid reason to not post on reddit. If that makes any sense. Nothing personal, no hard feelings.

I've got about 600 hours in the game and I just now learned you can actually see the missiles leaving the silo.

I moved my camp to a cliff over looking Alpha and stepped out my front door one day to see a missile launching. Was quite shocking.

I'm used to seeing them impact, thanks to the warning we get, but suddenly seeing one launch with no warning was interesting. Even has stages that fall away!

Have you done the Wastelanders quest? If no then you have to, upon finishing the plans will become available for purchase in Vault 79. You use bullion to buy them and bullion can be acquired through trading in treasury notes and buying a lump every week from Smiley who resides upstairs in the Wayward. Treasury notes are rewarded for completing public events and Raider/Settler Dailies.

First encounter with Earl was great, had my vamp 50k, which kept me alive while people with better builds and weapons, did the heavy lifting. Miraculously my weapon VANISHES after the event..why, how, or exactly when, I have no idea, but my pride and joy was gone, spirited away into the weapon netherworld.
---
  Next day I create a public team, I figure this will be a good way to take on Earl.  I have no idea who they are, or where any of them are, because they sure aren't with me. Undaunted, I make my way to the mine. Naturally, I get lost trying to find mine entrance, finally find it...see a group waiting to go in.. I feel comforted to see other people there... Then it's go time!... And what do you think happens. There I am, all by myself. I think I stood there for a full minute in disbelief.
---
And unlike the YouTubers who demonstrate their swashbuckling skills, capable of taking down the scorchbeast Queen and Earl with the swing of a melee weapon, or a few shots from some incredible weapon matched with a power house build... I'm standing there, alone and underpowered  like  the inept gaming loser,üò∂ I am. 
---
I did have plenty of ammo but it really didn't make any difference üòÇ
---
I know this was a long-winded comment... Sorry about that.
---
True, I while back I dropped my Level 78 character and started new. As I came out as level 2, a few players showed up to drop stuff for me, but I just thumbed down and walked away.
---
I wasn't going to crap on anybody for being nice though, and I don't use my mic..... But I usually prefer to go it alone.
---
If I find stuff someone dropped I'll grab it, I may even steal from other people's bases, but I don't ask for handouts. üòã
---
Oh crap... We're the muties!?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm trying out different builds and maybe pistols will get a tad better when patch 22 comes out and tank killer works with them. RN I‚Äôm a heavy/rifleman build.
---
it doesn't go "over" the cap.  it's just additional damage.  So if the bullet hits for 110 and the explosive hits for 20, nothing in that sentence was more than 110.
---
handmade/fixer are the standard issue commando pvp weapons, if possible legacy laser rifle, and people are using railways a lot as they are one of the few weapons that work in vats atm.

If I remember correctly they need crystals for the cryo ammo so unless you have a good junk run you may find you use less acid making fuel as it costs more to smelt the crystal ore
---
Honestly, I don't think it's a faction that you should be able to max out without seriously grinding the other factions.  You're literally talking about human sacrifice as a matter of rote.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'll torch my allegiances with both of the other factions if they look the other way after the sacrifice is done.  A Gauss Cultist Dagger is a little awkward, though.
---
I have not experienced any of this. I wonder if it is a region or system specific thing? Not sure if regions are grouped?
---
I have no idea why, but apparently every time I'm on a public server, my camp becomes a boardinghouse for AFK players!
---
I've gone ahead and added a nicely decorated guest room... But so far none of my "guests" have figured out that the accommodations are meant for them. Maybe I should put a sign: "AFK room".
---
i have been murdered before. With loads of junks taken. with that reason, i join the First to get that survival camp and scrap box. Now, i only have 1 bottle of cooking oil in my junk. come murder me and all you get is that and some scrappy caps, i think.
---
Yh dont sornd them its gonna be patch out soon
---
We are pipe.
---
I mean sure, what's a few of each component, stimpaks even... as per the original post there is an etiquette there, work it into a conversation, tell the person you're asking what you need those things for, but even then I'm thinking hang on, this is your game, own it.
---
I will donate some happy thoughts and well-wishes!
---
Yea I had this last time I ran the event. From full team down to 2 of us just as he regenerated. I ran out of ammo then because it went on for so long, we failed anyway.
---
This is great.
---
This isn't the market sub friend
---
You might get a sturdy one but its highly unlikely unless its a collector that is asking for one.
---
Go with the plots from the foundation. They are more practical, where as the settler/raider ones are more decorative.
---
You get a truck bed plot and mine cart plot which are ok if you only put down one or two at most to avoid repartition, however the foundation plots are neater and will fit in perfectly with the greenhouse set coming in the legendary run if you're up for the grind
---
No.    
---
I did complete a magazine list and got 40 Atoms twice. One for that title and another 40 for completing 5 titles.
---
I would add a better points to ammo ratio. 20,000 points for 50 rounds of 5.56, this isn‚Äôt the correct ratio, is a little over the top. It‚Äôs so much faster for me to drop the ammo I don‚Äôt need and craft what I do need at this point.
---
As a side note I think ammo converter is a great idea it was just not well thought out!
---
Thanks for telling mr
---
You must complete Wastelanders. Inside a place is a vendor which sells the plans and mods for them. They can only be purchased with gold from that vendor.
---
It's highly likey they are alts.
---
Mine is the same on xbox, ive got the lvl 100 achievement but have not got the level 50 one, also the bobble head and magazine achievement wont pop for me. And dying from a nuke one.
---
When you put card inside you are already prepare for event. Why wait? Join group before you activate event. 
---
I have exact opposite problem people show up and end event before i can do dmg to get reward from npcs. So activating it as soon as possible to not get some magic weapon random guy.
---
I mean more nukashine to put in my punch bowls and Nuka cola machine. Drug the low levels
---
Yeah, not just that most those folks with broken guns also stack hundreds of duped magazines ect. On top of the gun being broken. I hate pointing out the exploits, but it's like every upvoted featured video under Xbox FO76 is legit some dude damn near 1 shotting a SBQ. Most seem to have FO1st, soooo frick. I already get bored with end game idk what fun you can have playing like that and rob yourself of any fun to be had.
---
How about a nice warm bowl of Brain Fungus soup and Soot Flower Tea?
---
Damn, I‚Äôve never even seen one of those let alone two of them. Great job!

great now  I want a mc.rib...

Im still wondering why they won't just throw this trashy engine away and use unreal instead. Imagine if Fallout 5 gets released and it still uses an "upgraded" version of creation engine.

I don't see why you're getting downvoted lol

This game has some pretty bad animations and sometimes it outright has no animations to express emotions (looking at you fo4).
---
Auto-Stim effect? Power armor? Vampire legendary effect? ...... Game already put a lot of counter mechanics. Also its obvious "minigun build" has high HP and resists you dont need stimps that much.

I think the 151 damage is showing as he got a bloodied build and weapon equipped at the time, if he equips that weapon the damage will go down as it not bloodied, this what happens with my junkie build anyway.(correct me if wrong still fairly new).

I have a feeling even if you kept ur grenade launcher I‚Äôd shit on you
---
I mean, they don't look amazing. They're passable as "realistic" and not cartoonish, but they're not amazing. Off the top of my head, both RDR and Destiny 2 far surpass fo76 in terms of graphics, and they're both online games. D2 is maybe a bit more stylized, but that seems like a smart decision. If you can't make your graphics look like your actual hand is inside the screen, make some creative choices to make the graphics as beautiful as possible. Otherwise you go for realistic and end up looking like you just couldn't quite pull it off. On the other hand, RDR hits all the marks of stunningly realistic online character models, and environment, and lighting, and really everything graphics related. Meanwhile fo76 is basically comparable to ESO. And that's not to say it's bad, but it's not *amazing*.

That's funny because last night I got for the first time to Moth-House (forget what that place is called but close to Fort Venture) and there it was a vengeful Mothman striding around the center effigy with a bunch of cultists kneeling and chanting, took some pics and when the battle started they all fought together normally, it was amazing hearing them call out to Mothman when dying and this thing teleporting around trying to eat me.
---
Most players I run across are still very kind -- but don't be afraid to block / mute the bad apples if you come across them. If everyone collectively ignores them, they won't have any motivation to continue...

Even if you're just doing it for the plan?
---
Oh he has an ssd that's probably why that never happens to him

Whoa. Are u out on pc? I think I gave you that fixer lol

I say wait until the patch where we get free travel to Crater /Foundation, then drop everything there.
---
&gt;but most multiplayer games tend to shirk on the graphics where you can see the poly edges along the faces and such, and usually due to the amount of other players on the map
---
&gt;the quality is reduced a bit and certain effects or features are gone for stability or fps reasons.
---
Right, because fo76 handles its 24 player servers so fantastically. Really went all in on ensuring its stability.
---
That situation has only bad endings. Imagine you dont report it and they find you have 3,6 millions atmos. You get banned. When you report it as you did they wiped your atoms. So no good ending whatever you do. SHIT ENDING.
---
Be sure to plan your perks out in advance.  The respec system is very bad, and with legendary perks coming it can be argued that it punishes poorly thought out choices.
---
Don't delete the outfits from the responders questline, you cannot re-aquire them.  If you don't want them, put them in your vendor...lots of people lose or destroy them by accident and will happily pay decent amounts of caps to buy them.
---
Don't go too crazy setting up your camp early on, you'll want to explore and find a place that feels good for you.  I recommend a simple 2x2 shack with a raised bed, stash and workbenches.  When you find that perfect location... that's when you expand and embellish.
---
Scrip legendaries you aren't interested in.  There's a machine for it at every rail station.  Don't spend your scrip until you're level 50.  Basic gear and random legendaries will get you through and you'll be wanting max level legendaries when you hit 50.
---
You're not bad if you use utility perks like thru-hiker, just learn when to swap perks for combat/utility.
---
Invest in damage dealing perks early, better to kill quickly and efficiently than to try and tank at low level.
---
Do not underestimate the value of pipe weapons.  They're cheap to maintain and deal decent enough damage to function.
---
Avoid workshops like the plague.  Capturing one flags you for pvp so long as you're in the build area.  You WILL be killed and it will not be a fair fight.  The experience reward and plans are nice though, so if you must...start capping and stand just inside the border of the build area. As soon as it's done you can leave by stepping outside the green border.  There is no penalty for abandoning a workshop beyond simply not being there to collect loot.(you are safe in a workshop area you don't control so long as you don't contest it, for the record)
---
Finally...have fun.  If something just isn't clicking and you're getting frustrated...do something else.  Use a different weapon, do a different quest, scavenge/explore a new area, etc.  No need to bang your head against a wall, Bethesda's bugs are antagonist enough on their own.
---
Giving everyone free stuff even if they don't meet the goals=bad practice

I don't know why they don't just use tab for back and escape for leave or something, but it sure is annoying if you forget.  üòù
---
Jokes on you I drank six nuka colas and one quantum
---
not true
---
under what option?
---
Would love for you to share a picture if your able! I'm glad people had fun at your camp!
---
That's awful. sorry about that. I hope you find a solution soon.
---
Post it on imgur and post the link here
---
Sad huh
---
This reminds me of when I was playing on my bloodied alt and I had a guy lv 150-ish following me around and dropping dozens of radaways.
---
I have no mic so I kept spamming thumbs down and heart emotes, I wonder what he thought.
---
If you're here bro, sorry, I have adrenal reaction, I appreciate it though.
---
I'll add you so i can stop by and say hi :) KingpinZero is my IGT.
---
I feel your pain. Only taken part in ACP twice.
---
First time we beat it. Only for me to die on the way out and the game to crash. Couldn't get back to the server so I lost whatever rewards I might have gotten.
---
Second time we started off with about six of us. Then half the group disappeared. Then a third player went afk after a respawn. Then between the two of us left we saw the writing on the wall. He bailed then me a moment after. No point wasting more ammo.
---
Hopefully I'll be able to actually finish this event one day.
---
The last one.
---
What's the actual sale? 50% off? Or is it going be 40-60 script unlucky dip?
---
Single action revolver pls
---
Flamers can do crazy dps in the right hands (furious+for is powerful); however, it eats ammo at a VERY high rate and the fuel is fairly expensive to craft.
---
Cryolator isn't a particularly good choice for damage dealing.  But if you bring it to a boss fight and use it intelligently you'll make lots of friends fast.  This is especially true when fighting the scorchbeast queen.  You'll be able to lock down targets by freezing them, allowing the damage dealers to have a much easier time doing there job.
---
Character detail and models is mostly okay, and that's only because Fallout 76 recycles a lot of things from Fallout 4, and back in 2015, that all looked fine too.
---
Lightning though, I completely disagree.  It's a mixed bag, and there are times when it really just makes things so hazy you can't really make out the detail of anything, and sometimes it's so bright it washes out everything.  And Fallout 76's ambient occlusion isn't very good either.
---
How good lightning is will depend a lot on the location, and the time of day, but overall I'd argue the lightning is mostly bad, but good in some places at certain times only.
---
You should message everyone on the server that your hosting a pool party.
---
Fallout Pet Sematary.
---
Lol, why did you get downvoted?  I have friend that loves her Ts and has done the exact thing thing you mentioned.
---
What.... That ivory grip upgrade isn't good enough.
---
No scope, but sights maybe and certainly a few barrel choices and receiver changes?
---
I've only had major lag due to too many explosions at once, this one guys infinate Tesla rifle (he litterally soloed most of the enemies in range and killef Earl in under a minute), and using the favorite wheel mid combat. My first runs were via hosting a privet server and had noticeably minimal lag.
---
Damn I just dropped 600 scrip at Mama‚Äôs place. I would‚Äôve saved it! üòÜ
---
I really do like teh lighting, but the lighting on camo structures gets iffy sometimes. The stone wallpaper looks wet when it rains despite it being inside.
---
At least don't debuff ne during day and it will be ok
---
I wear my Pipers outfit with it.
---
I was a rifleman from levels 5ish - 80 before becoming increasingly annoyed with how little damage I was doing, and how long fights take me. Got a very nice legendary assault rifle and made the switch to commando straight away. So much better despite the ammo necessity.
---
The deposit resources is a scam to trick players to buy Fallout 1st for the scrapbox.
---
Under appreciated potential right there. This and the MG-42 are the ones I need more mods for like now. For the 10mm it‚Äôs like an SMG with absolutely no suppression or sneak capabilities? Come on.
---
He's on ps4 so not a hacked weapon
---
Don't know what this guy was using since you can't have hacked weapons on ps4 and not even magic weapons can one shot earle.
---
And here I was confused who would have 300 to turn in at once.
---
Hacked weapons are on all platforms unfortunately but on console it's not nearly as common as PC.
---
Took me till my second play through to notice the mister handy named Wadsworth easter egg.
---
Unless someone pulled off a miracle it can't be on ps4. Ps4 doesn't allow third party software to inject hacked weapons into the game.
---
I've seen low level players bait and lead enemies to AFK players with the sole purpose of killing them and steal their junk. It happened to me twice, good thing i always travel as light as possible, so they left empty handed.
---
Cyberdogs too.
---
Well so does the PC version, and the Xbox version they all don't allow anyone to just edit guns freely to then input them back into the game of course that's not intended, but obviously there are ways people do it since people run into this problem.
---
At the moment, Ghoul Slayer's [can be about 10% better than Anti-armor](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html?left=R_W-50CalMachineGun_L-45_ModReceiver-Standard_ModBarrel-Standard_Prefix-Antiarmor_PHP-100_EHP-99_Enemy-FeralGhoul_Hits-0_Addicts-0_Kills-6_Other-0_Mult&amp;right=R_W-50CalMachineGun_L-45_ModReceiver-Standard_ModBarrel-Standard_Prefix-Ghoulslayers_PHP-100_EHP-99_Enemy-FeralGhoul_Hits-0_Addicts-0_Kills-6_Other-0_Mult). 
---
Also it looks like Ghoul Slayer's boosts explosive damage too, thus GhsE is even better than AAE in my experience.
---
Ah yes the characters with the janky face animations and the lighting where god rays show through the flooring and walls.
---
Also worth noting there are a few workbenches at the trainyard to break down scrap and avoid being over encumbered for the run to the station.
---
Do you know why or how the shape of the door influences the glitch?
---
*Reposting from another chat
---
Imagine how much money Bethesda will make from mongrel, Wolf, &amp; cyberdog skins for a dog pet/companion Not to mention if they give us glowing, scorched, and the host of non-basic skins for all the other possible animals.
---
Reguarding my pitch for companions/followers make them tanky but not high damaging who you recruit to follow you around the map. If they go down you need to stimpack them, if they die fully they respawn at your camp, and they return to your camp if you start up a non-workshop event.
---
The reasons behind these ideas are we don't want them going down all the time against our high level enemies but we should not expect them to solo them either, instead being melee tanks or ranged support. Maybe they should get buffs from Charisma/Animal Friendship/Wasteland Whispered/New Perks. The suggestions reguarding the need to stimpack, 'death', and no events is further balancing adding a bit of maintenance into doing content with the companion but also setting up a no event participation for the sake of potential lag, kill sharing, and such.
---
This is the first time I've heard of anyone one shotting a boss on console and I've never heard of hacked weapons on consoles. I'm active in trading both on reddit and discord and have seen zero reports of hacked weapons outside pc.
---
I started playing when it came to game pass and i‚Äôm already level 170
---
yep. just makes them not show on the map.
---
Sounds like that level 419 had enough of their bs
---
Who tf would contact customer service, without checking their inventory first??
---
Lots of 20+ year olds play fortnite non-stop
---
Yea but probably not as toxic as kids who play it I haven‚Äôt played that game in a long time
---
Because that makes total sense.
---
Obviously a Bethesda employee only the highest of IQ allowed there
---
Doubt. High level players don‚Äôt act like that + they wouldn‚Äôt trash their own game.
---
Like I said it's in all platforms I play both as well and it's few and far between on console I have only seen people with hacked guns maybe 4 or 5 times in 1000 hours of playing, where as PC I see it every day or every time a play if not multiple times per server it's madness. I'm literally thinking about jumping ship to console for all my FO76 content and for youtube the hackers are getting out of hand. 
---
Oh go check out my YouTube channel surviving crafter if interested in content.
---
Level 52 Gutsies have a lot of HP, so even though you do +10% with respect to AA against them, they still take a lot of shots. Explosive legendary has also minimal bonus damage on them.
---
Where have you seen someone with hacked weapons on console?
---
Honest answer...
---
Armor. 
---
What level are you? I'm going to guess you're around 20-30.
---
The first 30 levels are rough with regards to survival as your armor and perks just aren't up to the task yet. 
---
Past level 50, you'll be dropping stims for stash weight. 
---
Work on modding your armor to be as good as possible and make sure you're not wearing outdated stuff like level 10 gear at level 30. 
---
BOS combat armor will go a long way towards helping you remain standing. Once you've got a decent set of armor you can start to dial in on specific mods and armor types etc. 
---
Perks like Barbarian and Blocker will really help. Blocker works without actually blocking (took me 2 alts to learn this) 
---
Take the 10k from Mack and then spend some time hopping around player camps and checking their vending for Stimpak recipes. Might take some time but once you can craft them yourself...
---
There are nw weapons with higher base damage that have made it over on console
---
Exactly. 
---
I recently redid my camp because my vendors used to be on an open platform and when i hit max or got close i hand to leave and then find a new world and try and buy things before people found my camp (i get a lot of repeat customers who know i have the good shit). Now they're inside a greenhouse with a door i can lock. And i even made a sign that says MAX CAPS BRB i can put in front of it.
---
No just 1 week
---
Vault 63. Give us a new raid Bethesda. We want puzzle raids
---
Queen fights for all but one occasion on PS4 they instantly mow down the queen with those 50 cals that shoot a wave of 500 bullets per second, it's not a BE gatlin plasma since their spread is very small in comparison and they don't do nearly enough damage to down a queen even with a max build since I have tried it myself ( takes a few minutes ). The other occasion was I saw some dude shooting orbital strikes in white springs all over the place like some board as hell mad man then he just disappeared into the ether.
---
I just  figured it was supposed to be a challenge for the quest reward so I stubbornly and very slowly dropped that gutsy üòÇ
---
You gotta be misremembering which platform then because you can't inject hacked weapons onto the console version since the consoles don't allow the 3rd party software
---
That's what I've had to do now. I've locked the shack I've put my vendors in
---
Idk I'm just telling you what I have seen you don't have to believe it. Just some thought with hacking anything is possible.
---
On pc maybe but sony especially is very stringent about 3rd party software
---
Honestly that line strikes as very ominous every time, also every time he says something about mutants my extremely mutated character breaks into a sweat
---
Really? I got the backpack from only 1 animal Alive?
---
I had the same exact experience on day one of the event on PC with two of my RL friends. We were super hyped up and then we dropped in to a chump insta melting it before anyone could get a single round off. Making matters worse he was talking and making jokes about it in area chat as he walked off with all the loot; luckily enough that is the only time this has ever happened.
---
In general anti armor is a 30% damage bonus, and in general a slayer's type effect is a \~40% total increase against the enemy it is specific to.
---
The reason those numbers may seam off is because the way the armor system works gaining a damage bonus also reduces the effect of armor by a similar margin, doubling your damage has the same effect on armor as 50% armor piercing, meaning you will end up dealing 260% more damage overall. So a 30% damage increase has an additional armor piercing effect of 25%
---
The difference changes as your damage reaches to armor threshold and once you reach critical mass armor no longer factors in at all meaning it becomes 0% vs 30%.
---
I'm an arms dealer that sells drugs on the side.
---
By that I mean, I have a dedicated farming route I use to collect chems and weapons. 30 minutes and I have enough to hit the 1400 daily limit. 
---
A few weeks of that and I'm having to drop caps before placing rare things in my vendor. ;p
---
OMG! I wish this was my post! I've wanted to say exactly what you've said FOREVER! I'm level 720 and I'm a solo player. That means I play alone. I don't mind helping out and I do a lot but I don't want someone following me around all the time. I go AFK a lot because of things I need to do so I can't hold someone's hand and play with them for hours on end.I also have pretty much every weapon I want and don't carry anything I want to trade so please stop asking me to trade! Everything I want to get rid of is in my vendor so please go visit my camp. I agree with everything you said and I love helping lower levels out but if I want to play alone please let me. 
---
That being said, if you need help and I'm able I'm happy to help. I give weapons and armor away quite often (which is why it took me 720 levels to get my B2525 fixer lol) so don't be afraid to say hi. Just don't be greedy.
---
Awesome post! Thanks for putting it out there. Have a great day!
---
Playing on my alt at level 30 I keep getting people offering me stuff even though I'm fine but I'll still get level 5s clearly wanting me to bodyguard them so they can do stuff they're not ready for!
---
What a steal
---
Holy fuck an actual human response I wonder what it says!! 
---
‚ÄúI apologize for the inconvenience. I understand you lost a lot of mini nukes and thus far the troubleshooting has not resolved your issue. Due to the limitations of our tools we are unable to restore lost items. If you have any other issues please let us know.‚Äù
---
Huh.. ‚Äúlimitations of our tools‚Äù then why do you guys even have a support team?
---
I have a picture of two (!) legendary scorched together. Took it during last meat week when I traveled south to Watoga from Bog primal cuts.
---
I killed those before I noticed there were two of them. Then it took some time and 40mm grenades to get them close enough to get a pic on my ProSnap.
---
Before that I only saw them twice since Beta not counting Christmas event.
---
Yep, that‚Äôs why a lot of the higher level players will have their vendors behind a window so they can replace the window for a wall when they are about to hot max caps
---
I honestly miss my Snally; definitely my favorite pet in the game and the moment they fix them for good I will go out of my way to specifically farm one. I lose my pets so often though since I have to world hop often and that is what usually triggers the bug where they just disappear.
---
hens teeth
---
Been this way for almost two years, yet all the devs have done to acknowledge it is some vague talk at Quakecon about ‚Äòrelaxing restrictions in the future.‚Äô Well, not entirely true. They did fix crops so they actually planted in the ground, several months after it was reported. Considering camp building is the backbone of this game for a lot of people, the level of neglect it‚Äôs received is pretty staggering.
---
Thanks and no I‚Äôm not sure who Davenport is tbh. I‚Äôve beaten the main quest just trynna grind those damn badges. This is by far the most helpful comment I‚Äôll look up how to start photo opportunity. Thanks a bunch friend
---
You really had to go bloody with rifleman to get the damage needed for single shot kills.
---
100% same &amp; agree.total bullshit.timegated events also bullshit.

I almost always drop anything I don‚Äôt want into the blue suitcase at Morgantown Train Station. Someone is bound to come across it at some point.

Yep, new game my friend. Not good for your mental health to stick with something you have no love for.
---
I love building around in-game content like monorail cars, cabins, etc... but it is definitely a serious exercise in patience. If you'd rather not spend many hours googling bizarre workarounds / watching youtube videos and researching error messages, I would sadly have to recommend using the existing less interesting structures ;(
---
They said 2 earlier on. Changed their mind most recently
---
Have you got damage numbers on? Also are you in sneak? If they're agrod to anyone else you won't do normal sneak damage

I used to get a lot of texture popping, but after getting a SSD, it barely ever happens now.

My suggestion would be adrenaline if you don't have it. Also you can definitely do better dude, once you've got the set up that works best for you you'll be golden. I've managed to kill him in 2 minutes but that's the quickest I can currently do it
---
Brilliant! You look mint. I managed to achieve this with my son yesterday. All I need is the fire axe to complete it 100%
---
Nobody stops mumble
---
Definitely! It's worth farming some cobalt every now and then. You won't need a lot of ammo for this thing since it does so much damage
---
*me when i go up to a cultists spawn with the cultist robes and mothman backpack only to be shot on sight*
---
I made a new char and I am having trouble with this quest too. To put the fuse first is OK, but my sample is already in the machine and I don‚Äôt have the prompt to get another one, just fuse and analyse. I will go kill another and see if I can harvest a new sample even if it don‚Äôt say so, perhaps that works
---
Well damn I'm a new player of 2 days who just paid full price on steam and I really hope OP's encounter was super rare...
---
Yep damage numbers on queen is aroud 300 per shot, and yeah im in sneak ( Or well, caution lol)
---
The thing is, for example, let say the Queen and a normal SB is on the ground next to each other.
---
 Normal SB: When i go into vats, with 95% hit chance, i would hit the normal SB, damage numbers will show up, and the health would drop. Perfectly normal.
---
SBQ: When i go into vats, with 95% hit chance, i would hit the Queen, damage numbers will show up ( less damage than the normal SB of course ) but the health wont drop at all. I would dump an entire mag into her and her health bar would stay exactly the same. 
---
The same happens with Earle. I also run a Gauss shotty build, and in VATS, it would do tons of damage to both Earle and Queen. Ive tried it with both the fixer and handmade,  but the same result.
---
Anyone who does this is a major asshole. Use a worse gun so everyone can get hits in.
---
:) great pic.
---
It is. In 1.3k hours I have had 2 encounters with a hole trap camps (and 2 clever ones that I enjoyed). And never had any problems with greifers like that
---
Pistol vats here, i hope tank killer will buff dmg but pistols still need some more basic dmg. While normal encounters are fine, sbq and acp are PITA. Still its not a big deal compare to vats pvp...
---
Are you with other people or by yourself?
---
If you want to stay rifleman, I recommend using a lever gun for long range shooting and a fixer or handmade with a hardened or primed receiver for events/interiors/etc.  The DPS is much better.  
---
Lever guns and hunting rifles are a blast for popping off heads at maximum draw distance, but they‚Äôre just too slow for the pace of the game and usually anemic unless you‚Äôre going bloody or instigating.  Even then, instigating is very limited.  There‚Äôs too many ways for enemies to take damage from other players, other enemies and the environment.
---
Dude chill out do it on a private server or stop complaining
---
I am curious, where do you get so many 5.56 rounds?
---
sure purveyor is the only one with 5\* weapons.
---
Can't  wait for that bloodied 2 shot quad FFR weight reduction Double Barrel shotgun.
---
Worst part is I think everyone else was in on it. They all gave the heart emote afterwards...
---
But yeah I‚Äôll Keep trying for sure. Ain‚Äôt letting a hacker ruin my fun. 
---
It was just such a big bummer for my first time. 
---
I literally delivered back the watch with no honor at all.
---
Feel free to add me - PSN xa0t1ca - middle o is a zero - and send me a message reminding me &amp; I will drop off a few things that might be useful ;)
---
I havent tried it solo yet, because i thought that if it works perfectly fine on my shotgun build, then it cant be server lag or something. I will try it solo tonight and see what happens.
---
OP has a valid point, they put a lot of effort in for some cheater to instakill the SBQ. Not everyone can afford a monthly subscription service and OP has his right to complain when they‚Äôre badly done to.
---
Exactly my thoughts as well. 
---
I really don‚Äôt see the fun in playing like this. 
---
Not even from their own perspective. 
---
It seriously must be some kind of dominance endorphins kicking in or something....
---
That was seriously what I was expecting after all the posts. 
---
But nah not this time I guess. 
---
I hope this was a 1/1000
---
Same!
---
D'aw, that's quite endearing!
---
My ex girlfriend sided with the Raiders and I broke up with her after I found out that
---
Blueprint it
---
What I do is I put my vendors in a room with no windows, and only a garage door. So i link my vendor and garage doors to the same  switch, which can only be accessed from my hidden room behind a locked door. So whenever i hit max caps, all i do is flip the switch causing the vendors to turn off, and the garage door to shut. Works pretty well.
---
I donated 10K leather on my main alone. I don't really have any more.
---
Nah there isn't. Just build a new camp

Thanks for the links. I‚Äôll go check them out to get maybe understand this a bit more.
---
Try refreshing or keep spamming on the game
---
If this is not limited to dudes, I do want someone to run project paradise with the next time it comes up. I've only done it a few times and friendly fire + shishkebab doesn't seem to reliably be working for healing the friendly creatures. PSN xa0t1ca (middle o is a zero)
---
I felt like she didn‚Äôt respect me at all and I was very sad.
---
Probbaly will get delayed
---
I really don't think you got the point of my post.
---
1) This a communal event
---
2) It gets the whole server together
---
3) You can't do that on a private server
---
4) As a communal event it's there for all the server to get together, have a good time and hopefully get some epic loot.
---
5) If someone kills the SBQ superfast then only they get the loot and the rest get diddle squat.
---
6) This leaves the other 10 people who turned up with nothing and is super unfair on them. They get no plans and they don't get a chance on a second legendary item.
---
Tried both. Even tried redownloading the entire thing. Wont work. Its weird i have the game since launch and never had this problem lol
---
Prob healing salves and disease cures, and toilet paper
---
ya ya,... and you know all error codes from all platforms only by read them in a post ?  
---
... btw - thats the reason i wrote "if u on pc" under my comment !   
---
so mr superbrain don't annoy me with your Google skills....
---
I was so chocked dude. 
---
I could not comprehend what just happened of these exact reasons. 
---
I made sure to report the guy because clearly something sketchy was going on here. 
---
Such a bummer for the first time. 
---
I delivered back the watch with absolutely no honor from doing the event.
---
Sided with the Settlers... less of a grind to max rep &amp; gauss shotgun
---
F them there noobs and your a god compared to them
---
Are you shooting other players often?  Are you using a missile launcher in vats?  Can you be bothered to carry around loads of heavy ammo?  
---
For me, the answer is no to all.  I‚Äôd much rather have 40 scrip.
---
At some point I would have sprayed him with bullets.
---
Damn feel your pain..
---
I really do hope this was a 1/1000 thing to happen. 
---
I even was a little skeptical at first because I thought it would be nice to be the one launching the nuke the first time doing the event. 
---
But thought ‚Äúnah might as well try and see what this is all about‚Äù so I stacked myself with ammo and stimpaks and was hyped as hell. 
---
Luckily I was not the one launching the nuke I thought afterwards. That would have been even worse.
---
What if it was .38lr +P
---
So depending on how ballsy you're feeling, it's quite easy to kite the Assaultron around one of the Pylons. If someone has started the event early or if you just feel like being a hero, I simply pull my PA out, use my plasma flamer and run backwards in circles around a Pylon. Assaultron will try beam me hard, slap me around but when I'm dancing round those metal sticks sounding like zoidberg from futurama it rarely hits me. 
---
When it does I just pop a few stims. 
---
Upside to this method is by flaming it whilst doing this whilst it is in cloak mode I always get the loot even if some sweat decides to use the limb glitch or a dragon on it.
---
And it gives other players time to get the heck there to assist with it providing there's not enough willing to activate the pylons at the time.
---
I tend to avoid other players but whenever I'm online I never missed crafting disease cure. Sometimes I crafted 60 in one go and gifts them to random low and high levels. I love sharing just don't go demand stuff from me. I normally teach low levels how and where to get materials for crafting and mostly they appreciate it.
---
Y'know, I would've told you to simmer down Satan, but this is great. A good way to get rid of them &amp; have the last laugh. I agree with this.
---
Do the raiders rep glitch takes like 2 hours to max it out , but idk of it still works
---
Step 1- Do what she tells you
---
Step 2- Go to her and press the second option
---
Step 3- Press the second option then back out fast 
---
Step 4- keep repeating
---
This is exactly why I don‚Äôt understand what happened. 
---
The mutation sound didn‚Äôt even register or nothing. 
---
He had the health of a bloatfly to this guy
---
Its just becuase theyre assholes and no other reason... alot of us can instaPWN the queen but we choose not too becuase its a dick move... Dosnt One Wasteland solve it?.. i dont play on the PTS so I genuinely dont know
---
Would love to have a look :D
---
Normally I take my time exploring other players camp. There's this player have their camp look like a strip club and there's a camp just like a dollhouse.
---
It was awesome :D
---
Flamers also lose condition if you look at them sideways.  One of the most brittle weapons in the game.
---
They‚Äôre amazing if you have one tough enemy to fight and you start with 200% durability, but even then you only have a reload or two before it breaks.
---
I did used to craft shadowed leather armor and BOS sniper rifles for people under level 10 but not anymore as its wasted on them "in general", I mean running after them to get them to stop or go to their camp to give presents and they attack you or just run away can be annoying, mainly because they are so new and skittish and are still learning the basics, that I now only do it for players around level 20 with modded Fixers and plans, as they've settled a bit by then and don't piss their pants when you jetpack up to them  hahaha..But bless um we've all been there! ‚úåÔ∏è
---
My only guess is hacked weapons from pc, only vaguely seen it talked about in a Facebook group.
---
Not really. Even with camps with real small footprints can be hard to lay down because of how janky the system is.
---
If you want to move a camp around a lot, you're best off containing it in one or more Atomic Shop prefab buildings and place those buildings down individually to get the best results.
---
Thats dumb but go ahead
---
Do you mean the random encounters? Sometimes nothing is there for me but I just assumed someone has just been there. There‚Äôs 5 other places for the vendor bot, are you trying all of them as they‚Äôve been working for me. Also are you looking for the scavenger trader at her spots?
---
Aww that sounds cool, what platform?
---
"No" doesn't work with some people sadly.
---
theres no really advantage of siding with a certain faction, 
---
besides the plans you can buy with bullion once you reach allied with a faction.
---
siding with either the raiders or the settlers makes it sognificantly easier to reach the "allied" reputation with them and therefore you should probably decide, by choosing wich weapons youre more interested in
---
if you want to get hands on the gauss minigun you should go for the raiders and if you want to use the gauss shotgun or the industrial hand you should pick the settlers.
---
obviously theres a bit more to it, like backpack plans and building plans.
---
But from a story or gameplay perspective theres no real downside to your choice imo
---
neither are you locked out of any reward as you can get max reputation with both factions eventually.
---
The only rewards i can think of that you cant get if you just rush through the story for one faction are a prototype power armor helmet, and a decent plasma rifle for the raiders, or a unique 10mm smg you get during the settler questline.
---
that beeing said, your safest option is to follow both questlines as far as possible before you go into the vault raid.
---
in that case you should get every reward if you side with the raiders, and every reward except for the plasmarifle if you choose the settlers. 
---
(the plasma rifle "slugbuster" isnt truly unique except for its name though. it has the same stats as a standart plasmarifle and the legendary effects can be obtained through RNG)
---
This is a cool idea. Thanks for adding content to the game! 
---
My only criticism, and it's a minor one, is the document needs a bit of a spell check. I can help out if you'd like!
---
A colossal problem tbh. You always get 3 star items and theres a small chance to get another 3 star. But besides that I'd probably say radiation rumble because of the legendary enemies
---
I‚Äôve had that happen once or twice since Fo1st was introduced.  It happened once when my buddy and I were both loading into my private world at the same time.  (I had already been in it and rejoined when we decided to do V94 in my world)
---
I think it‚Äôs related to logging in at exactly the same time as someone else, and the game fails to select one or the other to take precedent.  It‚Äôs very rare.
---
I can‚Äôt see any other explanation as well. 
---
I just really thought we were clear of those items on consoles. 
---
But I guess someone always finds a way huh?
---
One word: WOW üòÆ
---
or if you are level 2!!
---
were went into an instance last night. me. level 290 all ready, a level 120, and what we thought must just be another high level just not showing properly.
---
we were wrong, was an actual level 2 with pipe pistol. 
---
was a colossal failure.
---
Unfortunately we can't gate keep the dame game from people like this  i blqme game pass for bringing in this toxicity
---
If you set a goal it for someone it has to be random if it's not fact based.
---
I can play in a few hours if youre on. ID: kainzi_Z
---
Perhaos you're not managing to hit the same location consistently to maintain the magic effect. It can only take a few minutes solo with consistent magic application.
---
hi. Please check and use BLUE suitcase at WATOGA station.
---
It's what i and, judging by the odds i find in there, others,use.
---
And i hear rumors of the game becoming cross platform  now i dont believe in this rumor but that would kill the game for me if just playing and bame getting harrassed fot playing a game i like
---
Trap camps? Oh god I've still got so much to learn. But I love that, seeing as I'm coming up on 12 years of playing Fallout games when I went and got #3 on a whim and had my gaming world changed forever.
---
My father always wanted to use an axe on my pc because i didn't love fishing.
---
I completed your questline.. what item do I build to have you as a CAMP ally?.. also be prepared to only be wearing underware
---
Whats your PSN? I have some spare Stims and Radaways if you still need them
---
Side with the Raiders and the motherload gets to live. You get the bonus of killing lev and telling meg you're keeping the gold. Just make sure to do the settlers quest to the point when you get the stealth suit or it'll cost you a shit ton of gold later on.
---
Bloodied nerf can't come soon enough!
---
Watch out boys this big cajones cowboy is trying to lay down the law. Well partner you best be getting to going because there aren't any rules in the wasteland.
---
That is me I am the unfortunate soul thank you for making this PSA
---
Satan is chilling with me right now and he wanted to say that he is a huge fan of you. Keep up the good work!
---
Thanks for making the post.  It's still very handy information to know.
---
I can co-sign the idea that a core group of friends will breathe new life into your game.  It breaks up a solo routine and encourages attempts at more tedious or difficult content.  Launching nukes on SBQ and Earle isn‚Äôt something I do normally while solo, but my two buddies help share the DPS and resource drain.
---
I have rank 1 Adrenaline at the moment, but any more and I'll miss out on my sneak damage buffs.
---
A low level kept trying to take poseidon off me. I was gonna let him, I just wanted to grab a few more fusion cores before I let him. He attempted to kill me 20+ times and never succeeded before leaving the lobby. They are so temperamental
---
If you build a modular camp, yes. My camp on one character is made up of four 1x1 structures and a 2x1. I can place almost anywhere.
---
SBQ - flux, lunchboxes, blast zone farming
---
Rad Rumble -  soo many ghouls.
---
Surface to Air - why kill 1 scorchbeast when you can kill 3
---
Heart of the Swamp - maybe just maybe that damn leathercoat will show up.
---
Yeah, there's some really fun clever ones. That either you trigger, or are passive. And I actually enjoy them, it shows how clever the builder was.
---
Then there's stupid ones where the builder waits for you to come to their camp and kills you with punji boards or builds walls around you and kills you with a flamer. Those are lame and annoying.
---
The only thing you lose when you die is the junk you're carrying anyway so it's usually not a big deal
---
I'm free in a few hours and I can die if you need me to do so. I know a place that should work just fine. ID: kainzi_Z
---
I feel you. What a prick. 
---
Just happened yesterday at my first Colossal event as well. 
---
Such a bummer for the first time doing it. 
---
I really do hope they‚Äôre looking into it.
---
Pretty sure you're gonna hear the Scorchbeast say "hey, you're finally awake".
---
Its part of the game so deal with it
---
Yeah, this is what is commonly accepted. Also if a lower lvl catches you on your mule and tries to give YOU presents, the "No" + "Heart" ones work pretty well showing them you wont need their supplies.
---
Awesome! Great pic
---
This is normal.  I'm definitely not fucking around with ore so I can't really blame anyone else for not wanting to.  It's not fun.
---
Congratulazioni da un player italiano.Da SicarioNero.
---
Seriously.. how is there not?
---
I always feel a little guilty that a high LV guy or gal gives me free stuff so I always drop some stimpacks or purified water (both of which I have a lot of)
---
I know they probably have a bounty of them but I like to at least say thanks for the help . 
---
And I drop known plans for anyone. 
---
The only thing is cos I'm lv25 I kinda scrap my legendary weapons for scrip for better weapons 
---
Question though would a say LV 100 feel a little insulted after dropping plans and legendary weapons to only get water in return.? Cos it's practically the only thing I can offer 
---
(And sorry but I hoard magazines so I don't want to give those away)
---
Well done! I got the costume really early but it took me ages to acquire the mask and helmet combo! 
---
I know your pain and elation üòÇ
---
Stop paying, they won't fix a thing until people realize you're giving them monthly money for a shoddy job.
---
I‚Äôm doing this too lol. Looks awesome!
---
Lock them behind closed doors!
---
Nope, but ill sell mine to you for 500 steel lol
---
I put a turret in front of my house/camp, that doen't shoot at non hostile players does it? I just wanted it for the aesthetics...
---
They heart emote him? Are you sure with you 3 sec? Or are you exaggerate here? Because when everyone get a few hits and then he melt him down that's a more pleasent event for many.
---
Not me because I like to farm the wendigos but for the peps that want use less ammo.
---
You problaby needed time to find out how the event work without dying. So in another words when the event was going for 1 minute and you didn't attack the earl in this time it's not his fault. Neither it's yours. This event is stil bugged and it cost much ammo so people are happy when they get rewards with almost no ammo use.
---
No turrets won't attack other players, unless they're hostile
---
Fireproof perk, eliminates all damage received by your explosive weapons.
---
 I'm really annoyed I bothered to learn that piece of shit gun.  Now I get them from the purveyor.  I wish you could unlearn plans.
---
I had to side with the Raiders. Some major benefits include: you don't have to deal with the suckers in Foundation, Weasel gets a room in the Crater Core as well as the Fashionable Raider, my favourite outfit.
---
And the Vault Door scene (the one from the Wastelanders trailer) is so *badass*.
---
No really I ain‚Äôt lying. 
---
The 2 level 14-16‚Äôs at least gave him a heart emote from what I saw. 
---
They must have communicated with this guy just to complete the quest. But idk. 
---
And yes it only lasted 3 seconds after Earle showed up.
---
Not as powerful as you‚Äôd expect but I do love messing about with my TS mirv even if the range is so bad I could piss further into the wind.
---
What makes you think they are ‚Äúnew players‚Äù ? Can‚Äôt they be level 800 on their main and be playing with a low level Pg ?
---
TL;DR not actual facts.
---
New to fallout 76
---
And I ignore all high level players unless they come up to me
---
But I‚Äôve been playing fallout games since the first one.
---
I think the high level players sound like elitists 
---
Calm down it‚Äôs a shitty a game you paid money for
---
I‚Äôm here riding the free wave and playing for fun.
---
Yes!  
---
If I have my gun out sometimes it lags really hard.   But the worst is sometimes it will say server not responding.  Happens at workbenches too.
---
Great thanks so much
---
They've either come from toxic communities and assume that griefing is the norm, or they're griefers from this community on alt accounts hoping to drop you with their glitched laser rifles.
---
I've been dropping steel all over because it weighs too much.
---
how does that work? launch the nuke and then join the event and wait for the nuke to land?
---
Just full of useful information, thank you
---
Wish i found it lol
---
I've only tried the event twice because it was such a lagfest that I ended up getting around 15fps and demolished by level 75 Wendigos I couldn't even VATS properly.  One time the event completed before I even saw Earle, and the other time the event failed with everyone pretty much dead asking for revival.
---
If one was buying that many nukes you think they would have that perk card at the ready and realize how heavy those suckers are.. If it was an accident there is nothing to be done except feed them back into the machine you are standing at.
---
Theres a glitch where people's atoms are doubling endlessly.
---
Good to know, appreciate the replies, dude!
---
I gave all my masks away to BEYONDGODLESS because they helped me so much. That guy is the man!
---
What the Hell?
---
I dressed my ally up like this. Lol. It looks pretty kool. The helmet also looks good with a full metal armor set.
---
Ya I know, I get it. Patriarchy man its stuck in our head (in mine I guess) I hope you can handle my honesty. In some cases, men can never do right, because if we really treated you like we treat each other, you would get picked on a lot more. So theres your three schools of thought. 1.women are weak and need to be dominated 2.women are beautiful and should be cherished 3.women are just like us so they are dumbasses who should be ridiculed. I know not all guys are like this but I think most are and it's a separate topic to the one I've posted about here. I'm working on my misogyny, it's an uphill battle. Have patience with us, we just become aware of this like last year.
---
You sir, are a complete idiot.....
---
The game is obviously a cash grab. Modeling cosmetics is cheaper than competently programming an MMO. How razor thin is bethesda's profit margin or even budget allocation for the game? There are bugs that have apparently existed since the beta. Remember this when the announce new content but not anything important like performance optimization or bug fixing. 
---
That said I still have fun with it and bethesda's incompetence (willful or otherwise) hasn't impacted me personally... yet.
---
So, you are the one where Fo76 hasn't thrown an error yet on PC?
---
No google needed, just the normal experiences with fo76, **IIFF** you pay attention.
---
Hahahaha. Welcome to the shitty world of fallout 76. Where nothing snaps nicely to the uneven terrain. And u get freaking upset with building a camp in the wild.
---
Fact: This is, so far, the dumbest post of the day.
---
It‚Äôs super weird, 3 star enemies also don‚Äôt always drop god tier weapons and armour. Total bs, I deserve the best......
---
I see this in player vending machines from time to time. I'm sure you will come across one eventually if you shop around or you could hop on over to a trading sub and probably find one.
---
And is the only public event with a "very hard" difficulty.
---
Scorched Earth and Encryptid are only "hard".
---
Play more &amp; drink less.
---
Fact - you're an idiot.
---
Both statements are easily proven incorrect.
---
I had 30k yesterday, today 100k.....wtf.
---
Wish I'd known people actually want it. üôà
---
I thought the legendary run gives you the whole suit too?
---
I've played the game for 140+ hours now and never came across 'noobies' like this. Literally not once. My camp is close to vault 76 so I often see my fair share of new players, they just run around and and look at things. The ones that come up to me and emote hi, I usually emote follow me and then craft weapon/ammo for them and then drop it for them. They give usually give love emote and after a while just go away. So from my experience, this feels like an exaggeration. This community is probably one of the most mature group of people that I've ever seen.
---
Build it up from one foundation, don't use wall decoration (this would cause the floating Error), blueprint the whole shebang, and you are read to deploy almost anywhere.
---
I didnt get any. Strange. Haha
---
The pool is glowing now
---
Was at SBQ and saw someone with a weird looking combat rifle (or fixer) that they were holding down by their side. Had some sort of box thing on instead of a suppressor. Melted the SBQ pretty quick. Was only afterwards that I realised it was probably a beam splitter.
---
I play exclusively on PS4.
---
I'm super new and saw my first yesterday. At first I only heard it and thought a UFO was near and then O got closer and saw a level 35 and went NOPE with my level 5 ass and booked it. 
---
I've managed to not die at all since starting 2 days ago and I had no intention of losing my precious materials.
---
How can you say that. ~~Todd~~  God rays are life
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zmLWxjolQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zmLWxjolQ)
---
Fuck right off, you insta kill the SBQ only on a private server, never ever on public. ESPECIALLY when it's not your nuke.
---
Awesome!
---
Vendors are not safe unless you blueprint and stash them. Powered off or locked up in a building with no windows or doors won't keep people out. 
---
I had mine turned off and locked away yesterday when I was at max caps, wasn't on a public team and someone still came across my camp. I watched him PA glitch into my vendor building so I just left the server before he could buy anything. Messaged him like wtf dude stay out when it's obvious someone doesn't want to sell and he said nope, he dgaf.
---
The turrets will shoot NPC nasties for you though, which is good because the game absolutely loves sending stupid shit near your camp
---
The weight limit is your carry weight +1500 for anyone interested
---
I sold mine initially, then bought one from a vendor few months back, and then another that had it for 2k caps.
---
Honestly every time i use it i think ' ' what a terrific weapon '  Now i have 2, A semi and an auto.
---
It all depends on your build, if you‚Äôre a stealth build then Chinese stealth armor is Essential but if you‚Äôre more tanky then go with secret service,you can‚Äôt use shadowed mod in ssa, but if you don‚Äôt want to be invisible forever and don‚Äôt want to grind then go with combat armor and use the shadowed mod to get basically the same effect as csa.
---
They said "maybe", but it's not a priority for them, because it can bring a lot of bugs...
---
agreed. even some of my friends get pretty sexist/unwanted flirting goes on and I'm like...yeah I'm here to play the freakin game..nothing more
---
try GTA, though. that's far worse for a woman. 
---
yeah online games can be fun but I gave up the mic/party invites a long ass time ago. too many horny dudes and loud burps.
---
If you build your camp on a single foundation. All the praise to you for playing and being part of the community for so long. Only early day players understand why some camps are propped on one foundation. 
---
If you live in the forest. Well done for being smart enough to build with nuclear protection so random trolls don't just nuke your camp because (A. You didn't help them, B. You didn't trade your best weapon just because they asked C. You took a workshop and defended it.) Or you know... you like the lush area xD
---
Yeah I want an actual high-tech homo sight for me 'caster
---
You lost me at "buy mini nukes"
---
you dont have to be rude to them because they like how a game looks
---
do your quests
---
I'm getting that fuzzy pixelated thing regularly. Good times :(
---
So finally Todd perfected his Radiant AI. Where else you'd see NPCs attending events and so on? But in FO76 it just works! :)
---
Legendary run ends on the 8th. Plan accordingly to claim all your caps, script, etc
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html
---
Noman za
---
play almost daily. evenings, UK time. 
---
gonna add some other names from thread too. lets get OPS ready :)
---
pro tip: play FO4 first, it gives you most of the basics you need in FO76. regarding to steam o am close to 1000h and had no problem getting into FO76. ;)
---
With Secret service you are looking at a 1 and a half months worth of gold bullion grind then going to need tons of legendary modules to roll secret service parts.
---
As for combat armor you are looking at an extremely pricey option as combat is the most sought after armor type. Not only that but combat comes in 3 types (light, Sturdy, Heavy) All with verrying defense stats with light being pretty much non existent and heavy being the best. Since there is 3 types that can possibly drop the price is incredibly high due to the fact that heavy is the best stats and having a part drop as heavy with the rolls you want is astronomical. 
---
Scout armor is a cheaper alternative as it only drops in one type but being around the same stats as combat armor you are still looking at a heavy price tag.
---
Not trying to tell you how to play or judge your playing style but if you are playing stealth commando you should not really be getting noticed or hit by stuff. If you use the level 3 stealth perk in the agility tree and use a weapon with a silencer on it your chance of being detected should be incredibly low to the point where you can walk up to enemy's and kiss them. (granted no current stealth bug is happening in the live patch.) 
---
I would recommend sticking with the stealth suit and just adjust your play style and introducing the above mentioned if you are not already doing do. 
---
What weapon are you using? Are you running junkies by chance since you are full hp? As a full hp stealth build I would recommend trying to get a Instigating rifle if you are not interested in junkies as you will be one shotting most things with headshots.
---
No it doesn't. Not sure what kind of explosive gun you using but if you a rifles build an use a BE fixer or handmade you will die very fast.
---
i¬¥d say this was great timing! nice pic :)
---
The best way to deal with Bethesda is to do to them the same they do to you - milk them for what fun you can get out of the game &amp; move on.
---
If they can't put the effort in to produce quality work, I won't put the effort in to support them. 
---
Not just this game but all future games. They made it very clear between Fallout 4 &amp; 76 what kind of company they are.
---
indeed, pumping it with high damage does the trick...
---
*Cannot remove item: Part of the structure would not be accessible.*
---
If your on xbox i can prove it to you, works with all explosive weapons i have, fe  5mm gat, qe combat shotgun, be lever.
---
Yeah, sure you can! English isn't my native language, so I expected this. Many thanks!
---
Same here, ive been shot at, screamed at, no one touched the terminal, never failed the event since i do this.
---
Sorry, i forgot to add this. I'm on PC.
---
Get the camo paint then mod your arms. All I can say
---
This was done with a legitimate bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet or Power Fist and stacking food buffs! Magic weapons don't rack up damage this quickly!
---
Funny :D
---
Thank you üëç
---
Just sit infront of the terminal and head shoot anyone coming in
---
It was actually done with a heavy weapon from a distance. 
---
Gatling plasma I think...
---
No problem! PM me when you're ready.
---
Proof? I've yet to see any evidence of a hacked weapon on PS4. Only people who don't know how buffs stack.
---
I'm on PC and what you are saying is you never die with maxed out fire proof perk and just that? 
---
I've tried everything fire proof maxed out with as armor with dense chest mod, dodgey perk maxed out and serendipity I have tried it full health and 30% health, fireproof and the dense chest mod does help but with guns that do 500 damage plus bullets explode you are looking at 3 maybe 4 shots of being unscathed then you die. But obviously you know a way to where you can never die from your own shots.
---
Just remember people know how to glitch through walls and will still buy your goods behind locked doors. It's been a problem since they released vendors.
---
In that case everyone had to be standing well away from Earle and the Wendigo as the magic effect won't trigger if too many people are shooting or detected due to a glitch in how boss agro is handled.
---
Not a nerf specially targeted towards bloodied, it‚Äôs targeted at making it easier for devs to calculate and do future balance changes to the damage output of weapons. So yes while bloodied will feel these effects greater than most, the nerf still effects junkies, nocturnal, berserker and other builds.
---
Magazines of the same type don't stack.
---
Agreed this is common etiquette for public servers, should go without saying sometimes but some people are complete dickheads
---
That was exactly the case actually. This guy rushed to get to Earle clearly knowing when and where he was coming. 
---
Everyone else was dealing with spawns.
---
Bloodied will still be the best, everything is getting nerfed!
---
He thought " look at this poor guy. He's raded out. Why won't he take his medicine? ".
---
Be patient. This is a live service drip feed game. They already made one along with all the other factions and now we just have to wait until they want to sell it.
---
sometimes dead is better
---
Get a berserker weapon and go naked!
---
You‚Äôre welcome the break down of bloodied is the lower your health the more damage you‚Äôll do which that plus the adrenal mutation, nerd rage, sneak criticals, food, and chems the damage potential can get a bit wild
---
lol didnt know this but now i can feel vindicated in thinking he fucking sucks
---
Sorry, I could probably misunderstood you. Ready for what?
---
I feel you man it's definitely rough around the edges at the least and most user unfriendly system of any base building game mechanic I know of, hey as todd himself says "it just works". 
---
Truth be told though even as hardcore and broken as base building is I find the challenge aspect appealing, while yes I have been there with this perfect base layout that was foolproof yet the game throws up arbitrary statements such as "door needs support" uh yeah that's what the frame is for that's ok though don't mind the 60 metric ton section of my base just floating off the ground only to be supported by a 2mm thin iron staircase... So yeah it's really fucked but it kind of breaks you out of old building habits makes you build "outside of the box" if you will which is a little refreshing to me atleast but it could definitely be improved upon.
---
There is a text chat mod thats pretty good.
---
No other way, any heavy gun can be a magic damage weapon, it was most likely a junkies one, or a bloodied with limb damage. He must have had very precise aim too as you have to hit the same limb for the whole duration for the damage to skyrocket like that, which is difficult with how much Earle flails about!
---
Raiders have better story and characters, no real pros or cons either way, as you can max reputation with both and get bullion item's from both.
---
folk must record crap like this. and spam video everywhere to get them banned.
---
Best ACP is always where it's a challenge. When it starts we wait for 1st instance to fill, then join since we prefer to now go into an instance as 3 communicating online friends.
---
met a ‚Äúescape room‚Äù camp. really fun camp. owner was beyond creative :)
---
So true lol
---
No problems with that weapon on PS4!
---
I didn't die because i got the first hit on him so he was spamming stimpacks and died.And im sorry i don't really understand what you are tryin to say.
---
I live in rusty monorail support not far from Foundation and there is a big stone next to my place, some mothman cultists are always hanging out there, praying or chilling or whatever. So I sometimes visit those guys like "Are you creepy clowns here again? Get out of my neighborhood, you're dropping my rusty prewar property price with your dirty creepy rags asses dying around!". And then we play good old shout-n-shoot game. So, once I noticed they are here again and went to visit and... there was a mothman sitting on that big rock and those guys were down on their knees around! I was really shocked and "What the hell, guys! So that was for real all those times and he really exist and you were right! Please forgive me guys I was such an ass...". And at that point they tried to stab me as always and I realised that our relations can never be fixed again. So, I think there won't be any use in that faction and their quests for me, I'm absolutely not welcome around anymore.
---
Anyone else think that's a bit wierd considering the ISS can just melt you...
---
Cool
---
Viper's got you in the pipe, 5 by 5.
---
i just built the camp in the forest because its the only flat area i found i liked and it looks pretty compared to the other areas that are mostly rocks and dust
---
My two shot Fatman still can't kill lv 10 enemies!
---
The real trick is to have the auto grenade launcher, it's the only non buggy explosives in the game.
---
I blame parents for not raising kids properly. My 2 kids would never ever do that to anybody and if they did they would be punished.
---
They really need to get rid of that abusive feature!
---
They haven‚Äôt fixed magic weapons
---
I get that. But 3 seconds???
---
That shouldn‚Äôt be possible even with all
---
Buffs at once if you ask me...
---
It's weird how the public event says "recommend lv 30".
---
I'm a low level and not had anyone help me but I wouldn't be a dick maybe it was players leveling up another character
---
Cursed plan for each weapon so you can craft it with legendary modules.
---
or atleast they could wait a bit then kill the queen so people can save the ammo
---
Captainoob just posted someone beating it in 17 seconds showing the food/chems/perks/weapon/ and strat they used https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=d95iJfJj5BI
---
Really?
---
absolute gonk
---
Ok you don't have a legacy
---
Wow really? And that‚Äôs without magic weapon?
---
Because if so I see that it‚Äôs totally doable in 3 seconds
---
It helps putting them above a few sets of stares. I hear they take longer to load in.
---
Just a bloodied fixer with faster fire rate I believe maybe also with less vats cost but yeah no magic weapon bloodied is a very glass cannon build but the cannon packs a punch, it really does
---
Don't worry to much bud, it's not particularly great, I sold mine for 40 scrip not long ago
---
Holy shit. 
---
I must say I‚Äôm surprised by that info. 
---
Is this something that the future nerf will have an impact on?
---
This has been the way I have dealt with initial placement issues as well
---
We should be able to use legendary modules for ANY weapon plan we know, it's bullshit we can't. The odds of getting a good roll from the Purveyor (even one that would be tradable) is so incredibly slim, the grind is silly.
---
Hell no, I like the durability of weapons just fine, not that I don't have to repair them after 5 or 6 mags.
---
LOL!  So wrong about not getting caps in the Forest.   A constant battle with the 30K limit.
---
&gt; Well damn I'm a new player of 2 days who just paid full price on steam and I really hope OP's encounter was super rare...
---
Reading this sub (and a pc player myself) - my impression is this is a much more serious issue on consoles (xbox specifically perhaps).
---
For example - common to hear about players on a console complaining about too many low levels in Earl.  And not finishing the event.  
---
Where as on PC - I've never seen more than 1 low level in Earl at a time, and he normally melts in a couple of minutes.
---
It‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt want to put the effort in to level up so they roam around with higher level people just to be dicks. I have had the experience with some lower level people just coming up to me and asking for weapons and plans and then they bounce.
---
I donated 250 of each material so far.  My scrap Box has thousands and thousands more of each material but I am not wasting my materials on an event that will be auto completed by the developers.
---
 If the immediate rewards for turning in the scrap weren't the same rewards as the last 3 seasonal events I probably would have donated a hell of a lot more.
---
 I have every single rare plan those boxes give so again I'm not wasting my scrap on it.
---
Don't worry tomorrow it'll show that we donated more than enough and we will get the reward anyway.
---
Well you must be right bud. 
---
I just learned from another comment that apparently a video was posted of someone killing him in 17 seconds without a magic weapon. So WITH a magic weapon this is totally doable.. how sad. 
---
I hope the nerf will fix some of this at least. Just so the other players have a chance to hit him enough to get loot at least.
---
Two words: power creep. This would change our idea of what a god roll in this game is and force everyone to grind out new weapons. It's a dangerous precedent to set, because there would inevitably be a new, better effect to replace Cursed, invalidating all of your hard work. It's this kind of treadmill that turned me off of MMOs after WoW basically reset all of our progress with each expansion.
---
The nerf just makes it harder for everyone else, magic weapons are still working in the PTS!
---
Ive got some that are broken but I dont see them fixing any of them anything soon.
---
Won‚Äôt beat bloodied but according to some testing people have done, it beats junkies on heavily armored mobs but loses out on less/no armor mobs. The issue is Junkie took the second biggest hit in damage, now it‚Äôs too close to AA or beaten by it despite having addictions to contend with. 
---
Likely needs a buff or a reduction in its negative effects if testing confirms this.
---
I can't take the risk of teaming as things stand currently. 
---
My CAMP is my home, I've painstakingly made it over the last 3 months, refined it to just perfect (for me)
---
So when I learned about the new griefing tactic of joining someones team, going to their camp and placing ammo factories that can't be removed and take up budget... teaming all but stopped for me.
---
I can't take the chance. If something happens to my camp I'd just be done and uninstall the game. 
---
The daily challenges that require teaming now make me anxious. I'll join and then quit server as soon as I get the SCORE points. 
---
If it's a 'complete event while teamed' I get to the last wave of a workshop defend and then join a team, kill the last to complete the event and then drop team. Then I race to my home to make sure it wasn't messed with. If it's 'kill x amount while teamed' I just don't get those points as it's not worth the risk. (my only real friend no longer plays)
---
As an aside, I also never accept any trade requests from strangers after learning about the bug that lets them take your currently equipped weapons etc. You'll pry this 3 star handmade from my cold irradiated corpse!  
---
I fully support your attempt at being an NPC, but suggest that you take a page from the 'BOS Dog Tag collectors' and just use signage instead of the trade request.
---
Can't agree more. I help tons of low level players with weapons, armor, aid, ammo, etc. I had players do this for me when i first started playing, so i always pay it forward. I have leveled up 3 different alt characters and i kept all of the low level legendary items from those grinds. I regularly drop good low level legendarily on guys that are level 5-20. 
---
Lately, i have seen more pushy low levels, mostly in the 20-40 range basically getting on mike and demanding items " give me some fusion cores" or " give me some 5.56" kind of things. I helped a level 25 defend a workshop a while back, and gave him some stuff before i left, he friended me and for the next 3-4 days would follow me and want me to give him, ammo, junk, food, etc. I told him that you have to grind for that stuff, and he said "i dont have time for that" well i don have time to keep supplying you with stuff, so on ignore he went.
---
The Trade thing bugs me too. i really wish that Bethesda would give us skins for the Fixers so they dont show up in the trade screen, i dont know how many times i've finished a Queen fight or meat cook and been asked to trade and they immediately request my B2525 Fixer, like im going to carry one around to sell to you...no. Then they get mad when you dont trade with them
---
There are ton of great people in this game, but there a few douches.
---
This is completely wrong. All terminals in use can be activated on pipboy from another user (or overlay in PA).
---
At 11:35 I die to my gun with fire proof equipped https://youtu.be/jSnrfd9dS5I
---
I don‚Äôt play on the pts so I can‚Äôt say for sure I completely understand the nerf I watch juicehead on YouTube who provides pretty in depth details on future fallout updates 
---
-from my understanding they change how the calculate damage modifiers from multiplication to addition so the more modifiers you have the more affected your end damage result will be after the nerf
---
to be fair even the overseer is upset that we're randomly nuking places.
---
we may actually be the bad guys.
---
I don't think that works either, at least I experienced several times I can't use radaway while having a spinny Gatling Laser.
---
Hop onto a new character and unlock there. Most are account wide. 
---
Otherwise you'll never be able to trigger a new location found or new enemy killed that isn't actually new.
---
Rewarding somebody for failing is always bad practice dood.
---
But wouldn‚Äôt the bloodied effect at least be nerfed to some degree making it last just a little longer?
---
Sorry for dumb questions I‚Äôm not really ‚Äúknowledged‚Äù in this topic. It just seems so unfair for everyone else. 
---
What could be the solution you think?
---
thats probably rare i only encountered good people here when i was a low level high levels often would drop me plans and weapons, now i do that to the low levels yesterday i dropped like 50 plans to two low levels in the event they said you are a good guy on the mic and kept spamming heart emoji till the end of the event
---
What? 1500 hours since BETA and I had no idea.
---
Thanks! Will definitely go and check this out.
---
pretty sure that will just result in everyone not in power armor swapping to magic hazmat suits and going about their buisness. just like crater and foundation.
---
whats mamas place?
---
&gt;No one's glitched through yet?
---
I personally find the landscapes and world a bit better than the characters, mainly because it‚Äôs hard to get exactly what you want out of it. I personally wish we had many more options, but for what it is, it‚Äôs certainly not bad.
---
Yeah I make sure to watch his videos. I think he does a great job. But tbh I‚Äôm a little confused with all the numbers. Really trying to understand this.
---
Dude there are still bugs there from when I played at launch. Either live with it or don't play because the bugs are there to stay.
---
I swear the purveyor is named Mama Murmrgh or something but there could be no Mama üòÜ
---
Pets are something coming down the line which will likely allow more interactions and options vs a regular tamed creature. No official timeframe though.
---
This is very incorrect. You need to shut down the robots in order to get the backpack, does not matter how many animals survive as long as the event completes.
---
The nerf has still left bloodied as the king for best damage
---
While the nerf has hit every build and weapon type in the game. Completely crippling melee, rifles and pistols into being useless paperweights. Leaving only automatic rifles and heavy guns doing any viable damage at all, but way more expensive due to requiring a heck of a lot more ammunition to kill anything!
---
This is going to hurt early game players a lot more than end game ones, because every little boost helps early on, but every weapon mod and perk has been nerfed.
---
You dont know how i understand you. But I hope that comunity will be peaceful for me and we can have fun.
---
I dont know about those exploits when everybody can take everything from you with trading. Mutual trust - the obly thing i hope.
---

---
Some people just don't understand different situations. They were kids that don't understand anything about life yet, brush them off because they are flies in a sea of larva.
---
If you want to power or photomode glitch through to a room, don't you have to have room on the other side to do that?   If every wall space is blocked with something, would that prevent it?  
---
Blueprinting didn't work for me on vending.   I still had to reload every last item.  :(  
---
What's "dgaf"?   What an ass.
---
Theoretically the break even point is 77% damage bonus. If your other non junkies non AA bonus dmg is greater than 77% then AA will be better than junkies. So yes, on a pretty standard build AA will be better than junkies for anything but low armored mobs.
---
I might have to check that out. I could change from my current build if I like it enough. I‚Äôve only ever played as a stealth/sniper so I don‚Äôt know if I would like other builds. Any suggestions on perks?
---
Alot of people don't care about locks; will pick or use a method to glitch through.
---
i thing that one is bugged i cant complete it its stuck on 3 aliens and three monsters
---
That would probably be a paint or player icon.
---
They gimped that, timer is like 6 minutes before the event fails now, before you could go like 30 minutes of waves of ghouls. That event sucks now IMO.
---
Wow he probably dropped the fixer plans by mistake running thru the drop button mash. If not, what a nice guy. Most everyone knows those things are hardcore tradebait.
---
So I‚Äôll explain best I can 
---
With bloodied at less than 5% health you‚Äôre doing 95% more damage 
---
With adrenal reaction while at less than 20% health youd do 50% more damage 
---
So say your base attack was 10 off these two buffs alone it would be calculated as 10*1.95*1.50 which is 29.5 damage 
---
With the patch it goes 10*(1+.95+.5) or 10*2.45 which is 24.5 damage 
---
This gets more ridiculous the more modifiers you have and the higher the damage number before the patch will be a lot lower after the patch 
---
I really really hope I explained this somewhat simply this is how it was explained to me
---
Don't even have to change the skin to camo in the first place, as long as you have it unlocked the camo jackpack will go on any skin.
---
I don't know if there is a space requirement. I haven't done it myself. It's funny because the same day this happened, my friend showed me the glitch and that's the only reason I knew what this kid was doing. Otherwise I would have just been like why is he squirming against my wall? lol 
---
that sucks blueprinting doesn't work for you :( have you tried blueprinting right before stashing them? Maybe it messes it up if your inventory changes? 
---
"dgaf" = dont give a fuck üò¨
---
I have played since Beta, have had a few incidents not too many fot the hours I played. Its the internet, people can be unsavory. Ignore and more on, there is more friendly then unsavory, great community.
---
Either Nukes and Dragons as mentioned or Kevduit is supposed to be good.
---
I left the other day after seeing all low levels. No dawg I'm out.. limit the event like you do those recommend levels at the Capitol building but actually lock them out, they help zero amount, no weapons they have that low will help any amount.
---
Yea I guess not everyone is like me, thanks for your contribution
---
I love checking out people's places. Fun to see the ideas. No locked doors people! I'm tired of sneaking in through a window.
---
Mmm disease cures
---
If you're on ps4, I'll pay you to wrangle me some steel lol
---
All these toon characters. I used one damn character and I'm still not even bored of this game. Crazy.
---
I wouldn't say insulted, more amused, like, aww look there, newb is trying to be cordial.... no it's ok little guy, keep the water too I got plenty (imo)
---
Does it really? No wonder so many low levels show up there... Wtf.
---
I'm glad you were able to recognize it when it started happening. 
---
Yeah, I blueprinted right before stashing.   If I had/have to do that too many times, I will stop vending until I'm back down below 10K caps....which would probably be never.   There are only so many times I'll reload all the serums, let alone everything else.
---
Thanks for dgaf explanation.   Should've seen it.   Sorry you had to experience that clown.
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html hope this helps
---
Go into challenges... it tells you exactly when the reset happens
---
Carried a low level friend through it, they got a lv 20 cursed shovel!
---
[bugged image](https://imgur.com/gallery/JqKo1sd)
---
I don't blame you for not wanting to restock every time. It can be such a pain especially when it gets really laggy and you keep going past the price you want, so then you scroll back and then it jumps too far again. Ugh!
---
The reasoning is power armor and the fact it respawns daily. And I needed raider arms and it's a pain to get raider armor
---
I have kept my Mirelurk King alive at my C.A.M.P for over 2 weeks now and he has become my loyal pet, defending me from ghouls and bots etc... Ofcourse he deserves to wear a name, so I hope Bethesda will give it a future update to make him feel like an actual pet :-)
---
Your info still helped me with thing so I appreciate that
---
Thank you for the well-layed out points. In normal gameplay I don't have any issues except for the odd Assaultron. If they jump me I'm toast but no amount of armour would help against those. Otherwise I'm usually good and die very seldom in open world (even with only Sneak 2).  
---
The problems come in big events that take longer than just a few seconds. SBQ and ACP for example, since I can't "fade back" into stealth all the time.  
---
As a weapon I switch between an AA and Instigating Handmade, depending on situation. My go-to is an AA/FFR Handmade which usually kills everything in 1-3 shots, except legendaries or bosses.
---
Those all come with trade-offs that aren't  present with other heavy guns that don't spin and do similar or more dps.
---
This is an animation issue that I'm sure wasn't put in on purpose.
---
I'm on PS4 and somehow have 1900 steel again.
---
Have you tested this? I've heard this before but haven't tried it yet.
---
Have you tried kevduit.com it helps with builds (normally insane ones)
---
True, but it gets exhausting trying to educate them sometimes. LOL
---
Haha no worries. If you want, I can help check your document.
---
Nah, I like to have the failsafe of armour and HP in case I fuck up. It's one of the reasons I don't play a Bloodied-build too ;)
---
Gotta love these kind of replys, a sanctimonious and bitchy rant about someone being sanctimonious and bitchy *thumbs up emote* thanks for your contribution buddy, thanks for reading
---
its not even out yet and im tierd of waiting
---
Uhhh yes there are haha. We get the ash pile, lag and pixel issue on PS4 for sure. Especially at LITS and ACP. Sometimes at RR as well.
---
I‚Äôd try again. I‚Äôm on steam and have been able to link my accounts. I don‚Äôt think it matters other than people not knowing your ign.
---
This was on PS4? Weird. I know all about magic weapons but even those require some ramp up time. I wonder how it was done.
---
Wow never seen either caused by weapons or meat piles, only lag spikes whilst wandering the wastes or camp building.
---
I just roll with it, men/boys are nicer when the think you're a kid instead of a woman. I dont ever specially mention being a lady and let them assume.
---
Have you don‚Äôt the main quest at all? &gt;!rose gives you a full set from completing her questline!&lt;
---
Remove stars and things that are connected that requires it to be in the ground (not the foundation) before moving and It should make it easier
---
I dont even understand why it has not be done tha way in the first place...
---
It gets really bad at LITS when someone has their tent out front; so many meat and ash piles in one place = ow the lag and pixels. Haha.
---
But its never as bad when its just the meat piles. Its when ash (or goo) are thrown in that it becomes a problem.
---
[deleted]
---
Same for me. I was just doing the quest line, not realising what I was about to encounter. I was level 20 I think, on my own. I failed of course, but gave my much higher level friends a good laugh when I told them about it!
---
I recently started playing after a year break my thoughts went
---
"Cool I'd love to convert ammo"
---
"Oh it uses a terminal menu and not a workbench one"
---
10 seconds later "This fucking sucks"
---
I am on PC. You are more than welcome to team with me and a friend if you like. We are both personal against the ammo exploit ourselves (you want to do you do you). I live in Aus and currently in lockdown so guess where I feel I am living right now:)
---
Man I had one dude spam request for my cryolator in trade.
---
You know, the gun that I was using.
---
Like, no, man.
---
After I exited the trade he kept following me around trying to request trade again.
---
Then he made the mistake of getting annoying and gun bashing me flagging himself for PVP so I just straight up killed him. Never saw him again that session.
---
Yeah I guess
---
I took all my armour off to check but forgot about the backpack!! Senior moment! Thanks all.
---
This wasn't their first.  The first was something about killing mountains of Scorchbeasts.
---
I've had this issue on PC. If we could actually loot ash piles instead of them being supposedly empty, then there would be less lag.
---
I don't help any players lower than lvl 15 tbh because usually new players are here to try the game and will probably quit
---
I feel like it's an odd mix. I play on xbox so I see the game pass players. After first couple days the low levels that show up to Earle are doing very little damage but they are trying and reviving anyone that gets downed.
---
Maybe just my experience and I'm lucky but outside of Earle definitely a lot more jerks at low levels. Must be used to other games where people are jerks as well. I've learned to either ignore them or turn off pacifacst mode for a minute to get them to shut up.
---
Yep. Can confirm this works.
---
It just stares creepily, I tried to kill it but did bugger all to it.
---
I regularly use my gattling plasma on my heavy gunner, never experienced any goo pile lag.
---
I just cut the wire to the garage in build mode.  I originally did what you do but need to save a bit more budget.
---
This is a great site to help plan your build and to share your build with others:
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
Here is my stealth/rifleman build.  You just change out the rifleman perks for commando.
---
I know there was some issue where accounts were being credited atoms they didn‚Äôt purchase earlier this week. It‚Äôs possible they disabled that till it‚Äôs fixed. Who knows with Bethesda, they don‚Äôt seem to tell us much.
---
Sounds like me. (Sadly I'm only 319 so it wasnt me but I do this)
---
I took a hiatus as well, not as long as you however. I would say yes, jump back in! Not with the expectation that you will get every cool item for your CAMP, but they are always coming up with new stuff so you will start collecting soon. Another Meat week is upcoming, so try and join that as often as possible. 
---
Welcome back!
---
It‚Äôs going to turn on you.. kill it
---
This is really something you have to have in mind as you are playing through. If you have a more mobile play style, then you have to really know what you want. Prefabs look and work the best if you don‚Äôt use multiple of them at a time. Some of my favorite camps I built have been Tent style camps you can set anywhere. Another option is the single foundation build-up style, which works amazing for most people but looks like shit in game. It‚Äôs all just working on blueprints you like, look good, and function as intended tbh
---
That works too haha
---
Because you can‚Äôt see how many people are there
---
seems there was a tesla rifle involved
---
I got a cursed harpoon gun on my first time. Modded to use fletchettes and it 1 shots everything in vats
---
I'd love to play and help you do some power leveling. You're also looking for someone to craft you a handmade, yes?
---
Yes. Angry Turtle taught me all that I needed to know. 
---
Here is a video where he takes down the SBQ in 4 hits using melee. 
---
https://youtu.be/0raSbTxHfZ0
---
Yes but the first in donating something.
---
Wait the 10 minutes. Either there will certainly be enough people, or no one showed and you would've been doomed anyway.
---
What are the benefits of meat week? I always see everyone talking about it but haven‚Äôt partaken yet
---
What's the point of even playing the game if you can one shot the final bosses?
---
It will "sometimes " shoot them. Maybe. If they are close enough, or far enough, or shoot first,  if they are not a dog or molerat.  Maybe.  But much of the times they do nothing while your camp gets slowly wrecked.
---
homo sight
---
I suspect that Epic charging 5% of the game revenue as a licensing fee for the Unreal engine might have something to do with it :)
---
Was this yesterday cause I'm on ps4 too, and he died so fast before I was even able to die once (I always die at least 5 times during this event).
---
In a machine gun. Really?
---
Your or your dad want to trade for a nocturnal rolling pin?
---
I can't see your build, only the blank build page :(
---
Well first thing, it‚Äôs a fun and easy event that almost the entire server shows up for, so you get to show off and check out peoples gear. 
---
Additionally the rewards include some unique plans (The Tenderizer two handed melee weapon, Meet Week flag, Tara salad recipe Which gives a buff to you max HP...)
---
The Bethesda employees are downvoting everyone here
---
Ever played a korean online game?
---
There‚Äôs a cursed pitch fork?
---
Yup. Yesterday on PS4!
---
Well there you go, I just assumed it was general buggy Fallout.
---
He just won F76
---
I'm actually more excited of the upcoming changes. This game has felt stale for a while. Even got so burned out that I stopped playing during the legendary run.
---
Don't think so
---
If you cant lunch a nuke by yourself you probably shouldn't be trying to go into the mine. Not trying to be rude, but....
---
Mole miners farts.
---
I just have horrible anxiety. I know I'm equipped for it, full set of ultracite power armor and good weapons, I just don't want to do it alone. I'm lonely.
---
Pyschotats (25% damage) adds a little about 16.5% more damage over Calmex.
---
Exactly. Most of the time that I run into this issue, it turns out to be some kid whose parents use the XBox as a babysitter.
---
I think that lore wise, appalachia nuked itself to death. In games that are set after fallout 76, nothing of what you "do" shows up, like gold bullion and the sorts. Well, except that the scorched plague stayed in appalachia.
---
So yes, we may be the "bad guys" but that's required for lore.
---
Or maybe I just have my head up my ass.
---
Know what is far more disappointing than not getting the best possible drop every time you kill something?
---
Opening up the fo76 reddit and seeing some asshat whining about it in a new post every goddamn day.
---
Well then, perhaps they will find this advice useful:
---
They own the game and unlike everyone else in the world they have access to the ACTUAL DATA.  They know exactly how many players they have, exactly how many hours are played, exactly how many items can potentially spawn and exactly how many items actually spawn, exactly how many are in storage, etc.
---
If they are incapable of performing proper analytics and picking an achievable number, there are plenty of companies offering analytics packages and they should get one.
---
The division does that with every big update, it becomes a ungodly grind, but would make certain legacy weapons, maybe not obsolete, but less powerful overall.
---
The idea has pro's and con's.
---
I need to get my laptop repaired and try this, I have no knowledge of pc gaming what so ever so thanks for the advise.
---
yeah sure. Send me your email to direct chat. I will send you original. Thanks man.
---
People on public teams can not build in your camp.
---
They can only build in your camp if you are on a private team with them.
---
No I'm on ps4, but good looking out for the little guys man!
---
I understand your pain with stims, I'm level 120 and just realized that you can make builds to have more health or do more damage, something that I never did.
---
The easiest way to make a lot of caps is doing events and selling weapons, a good advice is to equip the excavator power armor, and go kill super mutants, blood eagles and the sorts, loot the weapons and sell them.
---
Also sell the armor that they drop.
---
If you really need stims (like me, I have at least 30 on my stash and 10 on me) buy them from player vendors, and if you get lucky, you might be able to buy or get the stimpack recipe. But in my 100+ levels I have seen that recipe just once.
---
Good luck my stim needing friend!
---
Colossal problem is much more difficult than a silo. If you haven't done a silo by yourself, do it : if you're not able to pass it, don't go ACP. It would not be good for you and definitely not good for the 7 others in your session. There are enough unexperiment players in this event yet. I don't try to be rude but it's a fact.
---
Pretty much same but on Xbox. Had a cool crew for a long time as a practically casual team. Building and questing. We all got about to level 60ish together, from leaving the vault together, and then just dropped off. After coming back to it and realizing I‚Äôm the only one who‚Äôs gonna do it, I‚Äôve been looking for a steady group for a while now to feel like that again. I genuinely like the team aspect with this much rpg
---
100% agree with this.
---
Im on gamepass but i feel like im only half a dick. I do sell purified water for a cap or 2
---
Next time, fast travel to a teammate and it will teleport you inside the cave at the entrance. Run back in and continue the fight!
---
I can verify this works personally, because it's happened to me.
---
Well anxiety makes more sense. Maybe follow along a youtube video so you know what to expect and where to expect it, id you cant find help.
---
Over 5400 hrs, and most of the crew I played with barely play anymore. I've been reluctant to play with new ppl, since it was so hard to find a solid group to begin with. Me and the wife finished the first board game in like a week. Double xp helped there with the repeatable score. That left us wondering wtf to do this whole time. Refined some alts builds, and just spent days building stuff. Yesterday was the first day I didn't log in at all..... I'm just running outta things to do, and bored. Not looking forward to the upcomming changes, and need more content. I work from home though so as soon as something becomes "new" I blast it out, and then I'm back were I started,,,,,staring at my 7600hrs, and kill the SBQ challenges wondering if I'll even get there.
---
What's the point of collecting the ore? Do you get anything from it personally for being the collector?
---
I'm only a level 43 from deleting the game at level 17 before wastelanders. But after I reached level 35 a couple of weeks ago, lower levels have shown up at my camp, where theres a vendor, to ask to trade. Like no, I have played this game since the beginning on my own. I don't want to give you any of my guns/ammo/junk/aid. I already go through that stuff like crazy. If I am selling something, check my vendor, all of my stuff it really low priced. I try and help out lower levels when I can with a spare pipe gun I picked up and some .38s that I always keep on me. But they need to grind for themselves I haven't played this game since a few months after release to give you everything I've worked my ass off for. (I know this is a rant but its been pissing me off for a while now)
---
We'll theoretically if you know where the officers are you can probably gather them all without going back to the bunker (given you can randomly encounter them), but the only way of having them marked on the map is to get the mission for one from the bunker, and it won't let you start another mission until you've completed the previous one.
---
That's the problem, you can't feed them back.  You may only destroy items once the weight cap triggers.  You get a notice on your screen, then you are locked out of doing anything but destroying items until you get back under the cap.  If you try to log off, Bethesda just destroys random items using a class system starting with junk and getting progressively worse until your weight is under the limit.
---
If you consider doing the occasional event, daily and meat week event for treasury notes "a grind" then I assume you won't be doing daily ops so just stick with the chinese stealth suit.
---
If you plan to do daily ops, "grind" secret service armor as stealth doesn't work there.
---
Responders
---
If the players didn't want help, they could have politely declined, ignored the loot bag, left the area, left the server, or just ignored the OP rather than talking at all.   
---
I don't feel there is any excuse for those players to respond to a kind gesture by being hostile insulting jerks.
---
It is not hard to say "No, thank you", or even say nothing at all.
---
What for FO3? What like, I'm replaying it now and the mods are mostly dull
---
Haha.. All that I know is that anyone who saves up for and buys 300 nukes deserves the fun he is about to have... err..  I mean umm..  Shame on him.
---
Why Gun Runner? I'm just curious, I know next to nothing about NW builds.
---
Any of the automatic rifle have semi-auto receivers that will pull damage from your rifleman perks. I ran a large part of my early levels with a lever action, and a semi-auto handmade.
---
They berated the OP for having played this game too much, suggesting that they were new or very casual players.
---
Well it would help if I copied and pasted both links =).  I gave you the blank one so that you could play around with it and post your build easier for folks to see.

Its really easy to launch a nuke. But if you're worried about that you should probably stay away from the collosus wendigo
---
We were probably in the same event/session yesterday
---
That's true, and you can gain a lot of levels quick.
---
I don't try to stack buffs to level as quick as possible, but some do. I do remember being on a building team during double xp weekend, going to the queen, and having multiple people open lunchboxes. Gained a lot of levels that weekend without much effort.
---
No problem.  Good luck!

My FPS is capped at 60ish, and it rarely dips below that, but, on occasion it does get down as far as the 20's.... I built this machine specifically to play FO76. My previous machine had no difficulty with ESO and everything else that I threw at it, but, could not get above 20-25 FPS with FO76.
---
Asshole and loser, most likely were abused or ignored during childhood.
---
you are maddeningly ironic lol
---
I have a fire station camp on Xbox and after 1000 hrs in, still don't have it! Nice work!
---
Indeed? Good to know
---
This is why they were working on One Wasteland. To prevent people one shotting a boss and allowing for more enjoyment all around.
---
Many may not like the idea but much like I'm reading here a lot of us hate the fact that people are killing reward monsters too quick to allow the group to tag it before the kill. This goes for anything that will give reward for it such as the SBQ, Wendigo Colossus, Glowing Ones in a nuke section, or even a three star legendary that multiple people are about to attack can get heated before One Wasteland due to time and effort. We shall see how well the fights are balance once it is implemented and see if people can still one shot things. There will always be griefers and asshats who find it fun to ruin others fun but rhis might change with the future patch.
---
Don't you stop off at vault 76:  cuts the ft price by at least half
---
Remember there's always *you* and what you get from the game.
---
The old saying 'harder to have had something then lost it, than to have never had it at all' is true to you OP. I never had a crew. Lone Wanderer perk card may as well have been tattood on my ass cheek as it's been so permanent in my setup. I've learned to accomplish as much as one conceivably can alone. 
---
Despite this, and other issues, I fucking love this game intensely. I think there's always a way to reinvent yourself.
---
You guys always say this shit without understanding what you're even on about.
---
Bethesda use this engine for a reason. You can't just slap unreal or idtech on it and expect the games to be able to do the same things they can do now.
---
My friends and I have decided Mama definitely took out those two in the stalls with the broadsider that has the boxing glove attachment on it.
---
Some will be back next week for the new features. I can't wait to play with my raid team again,that was peak f76.
---
It's really not that big of a deal. I took a 10 month break and got back into the game a month before Wastelanders launched. I missed out on OG Fasnacht, Meat Week, the halloween and Christmas events and I'm sure a bunch of other stuff and didn't really miss it at all.
---
Sure, I don't have stuff from that too but a lot of the stuff I missed have since come back into circulation. The only thing I truly missed was the Vault Raids but Strangler Heart is PA is still obtainable so not really. 
---
It'll be much the same with you too. You just need to keep an eye on the game/sub so that you don't miss the things you want when they come around again.
---
Wait, are you saying it's possible to have a jet pack and also a separate torso mod?
---
I have never shut the robots down and I got the backpack plan the very first time I did the event over a year ago. The only time I‚Äôve ever gotten the rare rewards was keeping all the animals alive. I‚Äôm not just parroting nonsense off the internet. This is personal experience with the game. Maybe they‚Äôve changed the drop parameters over the past year.
---
So what's the reason why they don't switch? Obviously for Fo76 it's because they're using fo4 assets and stuff and it would require more work to port all that on a new engine 
---
But why don't they use an actual working engine for their future games? Or even fallout 4.
---
I actually prefer this, a lot of times I have killed Legendary  scorchbeasts that fall on top of a tree, so I can't loot them. With that bug, it allows me to loot them when they randomly appear in front of me, scaring the shit out of me in the process.
---
If someone else shuts it down everybody in the event gets the reward.
---
Murmrgh can simply fill the mine with a gazillion of one star pipe guns and rolling pins. Earle will be disgusted to death.
---
I want a pioneer scout one along with the tent skin...
---
Responders got a fly as hell tent skin. Not to mention like the only crafting table skin set around (weapon/armor/PA).
---
But heck yes I want a Responder Collectron.
---
It‚Äôs been a while since I did the event. You used to have to keep all the animals alive to get any decent rewards.
---
Did I fucking stutter?
---
Lose Suppressors, Iron Clad, Barbarian and Better Crits and they're all underperforming perk cards.
---
Bump up bloody mess to Rank 3, Crit Savvy is the premium perk card. Get adrenaline if you can manage. Also, I'm assuming you already concentrated fire. If not, get that. If you prefer free hand shooting, getting any crit perk (better or savvy) are both useless.
---
If you're on PS4 I'll give you mine. I usually dump those 6 pound turds on the ground the moment I get them because I don't want to do the chore that is converting them. I obviously don't have hundreds of them but I'd rather give the ones I get to someone who wants then than they're then away.
---
Angry Turtle on you tube is the professor of Fallout 76. Look him up
---
I'll definitely pick it up more once new story content comes along, but currently I'm just dropping in for a couple of hours on the weekend..just to keep the controls/mechanics in my brain.
---
I only made it to level 60 in the run, despite having enough atoms to finish it off. It just wasn't that interesting to me personally. I don't know...maybe I'm just gettin' too old for this stuff lol..
---
If you're only interested in maxing out reputation with one of the factions or if you want only very few specific items that are available for gold bullion, it might make a difference what you choose. In all other cases, the differences boil down to three things:
---
1) You get a different outfit on completing the main story (Fashionable Raider outfit vs. Settler Worker outfit)
---
2) If you were nice to Ra-Ra during her quest for the raiders, you can get a relatively nice but far from spectacular plasma rifle during the vault raid.
---
3) Depending on how you choose to end the vault raid, you might be left with different amounts of reputation for both factions. Which, since you can grind faction rep for both factions after the vault raid, doesn't really matter since you can eventually max them both out.
---
I'm not a raider fan at all, but even I have to concede that the raider quest line was more interesting than the settler quests.
---
On public server?  Fair game
---
Server hop didnt work for me. Relogged 3 times now different server. I get the mutation symbol top left corner, but no mutations. I did just cure one I had if that has something to do with it.
---
That‚Äôs actually funny. 
---
Were you also totally confused on WTF happened? Cause I sure was!
---
I started thinking that Earle wasn‚Äôt even arrived yet. Only to go to the corpse finding him already dead after those few seconds.
---
Doubt all you want.  
---
Fact is people get bored. I can't keep track of every character a user might have.
---
When we ran it, we always went with a group of 6-8 people. When the event first went live none of us knew about shutting the robots down. Again, it‚Äôs very possible that since that time Bethesda changed the parameters of how rewards drop for the event. I don‚Äôt know. All I know is I‚Äôve only done the event once when the robots were shut down. It never seemed like a necessary step since it‚Äôs a fairly easy event as long as you collect enough stuff for the feed troughs. I believe you, I‚Äôm just saying that wasn‚Äôt my experience.
---
Yeah, public server, but still, I wouldn't like to loose my junk.
---
Or leave it around if it's useful.
---
The whole squeakers thing is more than just kids are annoying btw, as a buddy of mine learned after 2 hours of police questioning after helping some 12 year old in another game get some item. Parents wanted to know why the stranger adult man was playing video games with a child and alerted authorities. 
---
Nothing came of it after he talked with police and they ransacked the parts of his life they could get to without a warrant, but yeah, as an older adult, the decision not to play with younger kids is more a personal safety issue than not wanting to be bothered by preteens.
---
Here‚Äôs my bloody commando build:
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=7f345ac&amp;d=sf2sg2s60pg2po2ph2pp2pi2e31eu0cu2ce0ir2i11la2l10lt2lu2l71&amp;w=a72am1a03ar0
---
I think it was an explosive Gatling plasma actually. Something like that. I had a hard time seeing it. I only really heard it was a heavy gun.
---
Do people not realize there is a website for the game? Where it has information such as the dates of events?
---
What?
---
Yeah I've found it happening on console a lot lately. I'm not the highest level but I'm high up for new players to swarm around &amp; my camp etc. 
---
If there really annoying and won't back off, ask them to hit you as you're testing some new armour then melt them.
---
The real question is even if they ever get fixed, will they remain that way?
---
Came here to say it is Game Pass also, but you got here first.  Getting a lot younger players, more needy players, and more public workshop instigators.  Yes, Game Pass brought in more players but it's not the same quality.
---
I throw my salvageable supplies on the ground in front of Vault 76.
---
I also don‚Äôt mind missing some events honestly as well. Sure there are things I would like to have but it doesn‚Äôt ruin my build in the least. I like getting to come back to a lot of content I didn‚Äôt get right away and feeling like there are things to be done, and I don‚Äôt feel that with a lot if any other online games
---
Nope, waaaaay too few bugs.... Plus it's too simple and too intuitive - no way THIS can be implemented...
---
:P
---
I love the 4 rare ones. My camp is mostly Christmas themed, I have a Santa outfit and love to wear the winterman with that one. It goes perfect ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
That‚Äôs very well explained. Thanks a lot!
---
So with the patch the buffs are being multiplied with themselves and not the base damage itself. 
---
Is that correct explained by me?
---
That's why I nuke the queen now.
---
Fuck Earl!
---
I bought one for 20 caps from a level 23
---
The buffs are being added together before being multiplied to the base damage
---
Would be cool to have a guest book for people to leave comments.
---
I expect some of the "schism" in this cult soon - that tends to happen once you REALLY have followers...
---
Yes then I understand completely now. 
---
Thanks bud. Appreciate it!
---
the floating camps are pretty wank
---
The hero we need.
---
Yes I saw someone walk up to my locked bunker door pushed right into it the door and just walked threw how is that possible he did it way faster than I can pick a lock
---
YouTube the Sandmann
---
I would‚Äôve taken em but I‚Äôm on Xbox thanks anyway my dude, I just give em to a friend that I play with he‚Äôs a big guns kinda build using both explosive and normal ones. I run a db shotgun that one shots certain legendary enemies and I can‚Äôt find something to replace it lmao
---
I do free hand shooting, but I struggle with big health enemies like behemoths and deathclaws. I keep crit cards to do extra damage to them. What can I replace them with in situations like that?
---
You did not finish the board game in a week unless you bought it or used god mode.  That game was one month minimum even if you maxed every possible XP boost and even cheated a little bit.   I know because I did it twice with 50+ INT toons crammed to the gills with cranberries and brain bombs and it was a damn grind.  
---
Don't complain about the game being boring if you take shortcuts to eliminate content.  
---
You've got the Legendary Perks to work toward, Daily OPs and Treasure Hunting coming and I doubt you have every single gold plan, so there is still plenty you *could* do.
---
Flannel shirt &amp; jeans doesn't give me +3 INT ??
---
This has been happening since FO4. There‚Äôs a wider issue where the protagonist does not drop the weapon they were using against you, shoots you with a laser rifle drops a wrench. The drops have no correlation with the actor who drops them. As for Legendary, a 1 star Legendary can drop a 2 or 3 star item. 
---
Grind the wolf event, 3 X 1 Star Legendary enemies and you will collect more 2 &amp; 3 star items than if you grind an event with a known 3 Star enemy at the end.
---
"Oh, good... I've found you!"
---
 \*Burns molerat\*
---
Just like you use normal fusion cores to make ultracite ones that would be cool to convert other ammo too.
---
Was not an accident and had the card maxed out, there was just nothing sadly no notification or pop up of any sort. Bought the smallest option and it gave it to me just fine but no 300. I mean honestly I shouldn‚Äôt have trusted Bethesda and just made smaller purchases but I decided to say fuck it this thing should work fine.... right?
---
Hey thanks for the offer, but had another dweller help.
---
That makes sense. JE gat plasmas are magical all by themselves, although any explosive GP can be made magical if you equip an armor piece with damage reduction while blocking. 
---
Earle is tougher to get the magic effect to trigger on due to his fast movement and smaller grouping of many different body parts, but he does sit still when first engaged. 
---
Sucks that people won't let others tag. I've used magic weaponry on the Queen before, but I always wait a few minutes for everyone to tag her, then get her before she can fly off again for another annoying 5 minute flight.
---
If they were transferring loot between characters on a public server in a well traveled location that‚Äôs squarely on them. #raiderlife
---
Has anyone moved their camp be accident and proceeded to self harm?
---
Just the fact that a ‚Äúclosed‚Äù vendor machine can still be shopped from is so weird to me. 
---
A simple close vendor tab somewhere in our settings/menu tab would be very useful.
---
No problem:D
---
My solution, albeit not a perfect one, is that my 3 vendors are in a 1x1 building with a half wall on one side that allows players to buy my trash. When I cap I simply add the other half wall and it's completely blocked off.
---
This doesn't account for if someone could glitch through walls, or walls that haven't loaded in yet when they fast travel, but my spawn points are far enough away from my vendor box that it shouldn't or at least hasn't been an issue.
---
If you go onto the Nexus, search by mod category. The top endorsed under "Quests and Adventures" and "New Lands and Locations" are great places to start.
---
Of special note to me, though, include A World of Pain, Puce Moose's quest mod series, and a little known foreign language gem called Chaotic Sun. That last one adds a monstrous 300-cell long high level dungeon with almost 100 new weapons and loads of new enemies and effects. It's a little rough around the edges but in terms of new content and gear it's unbeatable.
---
How did you make a pool?
---
...because those engines don't have what they use creation engine for? Did you even read my comment
---
It has to be a random encounter spawn
---
So as to my friends who no longer play, but I'm still going strong, enjoying it- my girlfriend plays occasionally but now she's pretty preoccupied with her new project motorbike :)
---
Complete Rose‚Äôs quest. You get a full raider power armor set.
---
Damn so this is why I have to spam the stim button with my heavy build
---
The absolute worst trap camp for me was when I just purchased a bunch of pure flux. About 2k caps worth. And I got hit with the stupid punji boards. Asshat took my caps and my flux that I just purchased and sent me a msg saying good game thanks for the stuff üòò. How tf was that a good game??!
---
Yeah its maddening my son built the huge walls around his vendor wall and ppl still buying its ridiculous they will spawn and run inside before walls spawn and buy you out there need to be a control in place.
---
Fallout 76 is not an mmorpg.
---
There's no magic to it...just luck.
---
I cant really follow what you are saying. Did you go to others camps to buy low to sell high? In relation to the inability to permanently turn off vendors until you say so genius idea would be for Bethesda to give us a holotape that we load into the pip boy to turn on/off the vending machine remotely.  A hard lock. No fussing about.
---
It‚Äôs annoying for everyone else aswell, did that campfire tales and didn‚Äôt even get a chance to shoot the wendingo
---
You could pacify but not tame. The creature has to be at least half your level and must be at a random event spawn.
---
Yeah I stop helping new players when these new jerks abuse my hospitality. I view them as West Coast Homeless where they make these ugly camps and eat up everything that‚Äôs handed to them and have the audacity to ask for more shit. Those kinds of ppl will never stand on their own 2 feet and will need to be carried for everything. You Don‚Äôt help a random homeless person irl, why tf would you do that in a video game? And if do help the homeless irl, tbh good for you but these video game bums aren‚Äôt worthy of your kindness.
---
Its unstoppable thats the issue. They have spawned through locked doors and walls to buy from my son.
---
I am not impressed at all with the character models in this game.  The mobs are fine.  The character models are horrid.
---
Yes exactly. He was standing completely still in his spawn probably making it even easier for this guy to kill him. 
---
But I can respect that. It‚Äôs fine by me actually if you just let everyone in on the fun also. 
---
We could all have gotten the drop from Earle + finish it faster than expected. 
---
I can‚Äôt tell people  what weapons to use and so on. 
---
But if you really wanna use your magic weapons on bosses I see this as the ideal way of doing it.
---
the excavator power armor has a plus 100 carry weight bonus.  Otherwise you can use multiple pieces as a jigsaw and it doesnt matter.
---
I feel you. I loved the fallout franchise and thought 76 was going to be an all time favorite game. It's been months since I've played. I try to get back into it occasionally but it seems mundane and repetitive, like I'm just hoping back on to do the same thing I did before I stopped playing. Sure they added a few things but it's all so grind and time consuming
---
I feel you bro x(
---
This is how I felt, I did the exact same but started playing just before wastelanders &amp; its been the best thing yet- I did miss out on a lot of events, special camp items and collectable things but I've learnt so much more than when I first started playing this game.
---
I read that atom shop things get recycled so you get them again, hopefully :)
---
I know you're joking, but on the off-chance that the developers see this, please don't!
---
Theyll fix it when they can make money off of it. Do you not know what kind of a dumpster fire we‚Äôre in?
---
Also let's you collect 4 times as much ore.  Strangler heart PA also has a set bonus but that's it, doesn't matter for the rest.  The next patch does have a legendary perk that will give you a bonus for a full set though.
---
I got mine from A Real Blast in the Savage Divide.
---
Lead run in Lucky Hole. Made 24k 50 cal rounds from it.
---
I only use it with my friends who are okay with it now, and only on the Queen because we can't stand her constant flying BS. I appreciate your decent attitude about it though.
---
Or kids, which more of the same.
---
So you have the secret sauce that makes the broadsider not a piece of shit ,masinary?
---
Illuminati confirmed
---
Someone bought me out and wouldn't stop when asked I was launching nuke with my son trying to have some fun fighting scorchbeast queen so technically couldn't leave had to leave delist all my stuff just to go back. Bull total bull lol
---
True.  I heard the strangler got nerfed though so I never pursued it.
---
And I totally respect this. 
---
Thanks for playing like this. This is the way imo.
---
If u do a quick search this question has been answered in great detail many times I know I‚Äôve asked it before. Honestly it‚Äôs prob the most confusing this about the game good luck
---
Maybe if they enabled an option to lock our vending machines. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Does it help if you loot the meat piles (as much as possible) as you go along so that they can de-spawn?
---
Same here.  Before the nerf it would freeze my game and other peoples as well, so there was no point in me trying to get it while it was still good.
---
We should start a petition!
---
Pretty sure this has been an issue since day 1 of the event.
---
Here‚Äôs to hoping that Bethesda has it on their docket, because I don‚Äôt think that we can really do anything until then.
---
Repetitive, yes. Inappropriate? Not so much.
---
Probably Xbox game pass kids
---
That would cut out one of the two remaining human enemy types in the game though wouldn‚Äôt it? Starting off the three hostile human factions you can fight would be Raiders, Cultists, and Blood Eagles. You already befriend the raiders in the story which turns them from initially hostile to friendly. (Which wasn‚Äôt that big of the deal since the only place you‚Äôd find Raiders was random spots dotted along the map.) 
---
But if you were to befriend the cultists the same way you did the raiders and they become passive, that would basically null entire dungeons and locations around the map filled with cultist enemies. (That little reclaim the weapon case quest Gramps or other allies sends you on? Goes from fighting through an enemy cultist base for the case, to walking into the passive cultist camp and grabbing it with no trouble.) 
---
Unfortunately for some, I don‚Äôt see the cultists ever becoming a passive faction since that would turn many dungeon areas around the map friendly. This game doesn‚Äôt need even less stuff to fight, Gotta have some human enemies.
---
Even at LVL 50 I gotta admit it has been mostly a good exp with low levels, only idiots were the high lvls coming to my camp and trying to incite PVP, two of which got destroyed right after by other vets coming to get them for griefing...compared to other online games the FO76 community is great and keeps me playing partially...it also has to lead me giving something to every really low-level player I see, esp as I am right next door to Wayward.
---
Or shoot at other bits of your camp. Forever (until you switch servers). Fortunately it doesn't do damage, but it's annoying.
---
Congrats on you and your dad, you got any tips on getting the outfit? I‚Äôve been playing since day one and no luck sadly the only outfit I have is the bomber jacket.
---
50 % off sale equals twice the dissapointment for me.  Twice as many nocturnal pipe pistols and suppresed fat mans.
---
Yeah, I ran solo for so long that once I got a taste of what it was like to have a team, I didn't want to go back to being solo full time. LOL
---
Yeah. I'm all about new content, but I feel like some of the changes will do more harm than good
---
It would be cool to create or own quests for other users. You put them to collect 50 copper for you or get you a certain plan/item and you pay them in items and/or caps.
---
You would know from the start what you get for the task.
---
edit:also quest in which players complete your challenges or kill a player that bullied you.
---
We should! üò¨
---
That‚Äôs if we even get the sale,we should do even if the goal isn‚Äôt reached.
---
We shouldn‚Äôt have to do anything it should automatically not allow any purchases once we‚Äôre at max caps. The same as you can‚Äôt sell more to the vendor bots once you‚Äôve hit the daily amount.
---
My experience is that most sub mods delete and ban quickly and dont seem to care about it much.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I have no clue how this could even remotely touch rule #10
---
But still, you post this on the wrong forum. Try the one Beth maintains. It will have the same effect as a fart in a storm... No one cares.
---
That sucks when you have all the trouble to launch a nuke and can‚Äôt enjoy it as you wish.
---
Unless you haven‚Äôt done anything and expect people who actually launched the nuke to do as you please
---
Yeah - it's so sad seeing an 8 year old with keys to his parent's liquor cabinet......
---
I got the fixer plan my second time doing this and i may never do it again
---
Yeah, it still broken in PTS.  I was messing around with it yesterday.
---
Personally, I think the reason why it's "complicated" is because there's a disconnect in how the server and client see the physical relationship between two entities.  To you, you have a clean shot and 95%.  To the server, Earle is 10 feet to the right, or maybe even has his back turned to you.  You either miss, or the game can't resolve the bizarre disconnect and sends your bullet flying at a 45¬∫ angle.  While it never works well, it's significantly worse on a laggy or deteriorating server, where that whole "VATS three times" trick doesn't work.
---
Ok, I know it sucks, but why the fuck did you buy max mini nukes?
---
Why was the text off this post removed?
---
my camp is near a scorched spawn and ive never been there without hearing the guns fire myself
---
I built an underground camp near a silo. You can it leave from underground too.  It is pretty spectacular.
---
I did not know one exists, thanks!
---
Photomode glitch through the doors, silo done in 10min.
---
Water-cooled bonesaws.
---
I'm sure every single fallout player would sign that petition because it's nonsense that we can't control that aspect of the game and lose all our hard-earned stuff to somebody with no respect or manners. Now I'm scared to sell more then 30k worth of stuff that really peed me off yesterday. Prob never happen again but had to block the guy so he dont come back with his buds and clean me out weekly  for 100k worth of guns for 30k while I'm busy and don't notice.
---
 Hallelujah man! Yeah exactly 
---
" Player has reached max caps" like cmon Bethseda
---
Why not? But to blow shit up of course. Either way I was just thinking shit my homie needs more so might as well set him up for a while but tbh we use them to fuck around more so than killing shit with em I.e. setting off a fat chain explosion of cars and wonder why our peasant consoles sound like jet engines
---
Ya lol
---
&gt;Just let us break down ammo
---
I honestly don't get why this isn't an option. You can break down weapons, armor, animal hides, glass bottles, plastic plates, spoons, damn near anything you can find in the world. 
---
But breaking down a bullet and taking out the gunpowder and lead? Nah. 
---
Not to mention the conversion rates for ammo are horrendous. 3 mini nukes isn't even enough for 12 shotgun shells. I mean come on.
---
I had a lvl 75 bloodied build trying to start shit while I was shopping in someone‚Äôs camp, kept shooting and and hitting me (lvl202 pure pve build). So I calmly went to the stash box and retrieved my quad ffr gamma gun and showed it to the guy, he didn‚Äôt stop so I walked over to the tinkers bench to make some ammo for it all the while he was attacking me and then promptly turned around reloaded and melted the little prick.
---
So your missing out on something, if your intelligence wasn't around 70 . Did your unyeailding armor have plus 1 intelligence? Herbivore, on top of your food buffs? Run at 4 lunch boxes at all times? Did you just play the game like you usally do when double xp was around? Cuz me and the wife killed none stop for 5 days straight. The repeatable XP was were it was at. So it was just kill, and server hop for days. I'm not complaining either, I love this game, that's why I put over 5400hrs into it. Wife loves it too shes over 4500 hrs play time. Every once in awhile someone like you  comes along though. And thinks someone cheated Cuz they think they know everything, Cuz they watched some idiots cheat video on youtube. There are ppl that actually grind the game. Most of what I've seen on xp boost videos are missing out on like 3 buffs.
---
So only the strangler heart and the excavator got a bonus, the rest dont. Thx
---
I've killed SBQ more times than I can count. I still need to kill her for a challenge though.... somehow...
---
Thanks for the heads up. But why would you do this?
---
First of all your original comment just said "creation engine better" without explaining why it's better. It's not my job to look for when you'll edit your comment.
---
And second of all, you have no idea what you're talking about. No, creation engine cannot support thousands dynamic objects at the same time, it's struggling to work with the simplest things. Because Creation engine is working doesn't mean that it's working well, there's a good reason for why everyone's shitting on it.
---
Implementing mod support on your game is way easier on Unreal and it's easier to make mods there. 
---
You have no idea how game engines work, especially the creation and unreal engine. So next time please do your own research before bad mouthing with that attitude.
---
What guns are those? They go with that very well
---
they have no weight so I keep them all
---
Crappy non-descriptive title? Clickbait title? (doing it again btw), Repeatative post? Lots of possible and valid reason.
---
And that is one of the NW problems. You need a specific specials to use one absolutely best build in that unbalanced game mode. I don't want to make another character and level it up to 50 lvl *in pve mode* to use it *in pvp mode*.
---
I could give you some caps for it, or flux. 5k?
---
Oh for sure. It's definitely an issue. No power to vendors should disable them.
---
Just look away, if i see him going for it i look away, wait for the sound, then look back and keep fighting.
---
If those rumors turn out to be true, I wonder if we‚Äôd get the chance to cross platform Nuclear Winter...aside from PC of course for obvious reasons. But PS4 vs xbox would be a great match considering the communities are similar.
---
But researching for myself is so haaaaard.   Just tell me. 
---
;)
---
I don't want to sound like an elitist or a hater. However, I don't play on consoles anymore because good respectful players on console platforms seem to be diamonds in the rough these days. I've enjoyed being on PC much more as a result of this circumstance. Granted this is just my personal observation and opinion; not a fact in any way.
---
I know this is probably obvious but never stock more than you‚Äôre able sell to get to max caps.
---
Lol forgot about that one. No power and they still operate? Like wtf?
---
I hate voice chat.  I would love it if there was a text chat option.
---
I would probably play more...
---
I‚Äôd be down! Sounds fun!
---
I wish there was an option to participate in cross play. Have a toggle to turn off cross play all together. PS and Xbone can duke it out. Lol.
---
It's because of this that I've started "social experiments" on low levels. My most successful so far is dropping from very far up in front of a low level, and if they decide with the kindness of their own heart to revive me, I give them tons of stimpaks, radaway, canned food and plans. 
---
If they don't, however, or do something like teabag me, I start claiming their workshop and, in a simple phrasing, teach them a lesson. Usually they learn pretty quick not to be an asshole when someone's being an asshole to you.
---
Do more harm than good how?
---
If you're referring to the damage changes, it's vital for the long term viability of this game. The short term changes are there but not that big of a deal as demonstrated by a number of youtubers over and over. 
---
Yeah, big numbers get smaller but in terms of actual gameplay effectiveness, it doesn't impact much except for boss encounters. Instead of melting them in seconds, it might actually be a minute or two now.
---
I've said this time and again, if the upcoming damage change is the only thing Bethesda do, I'm right with anyone complaining cause that's not a combat balance pass. It's just the beginning and Bethesda even admits it's the case.
---
You watch, this will be the TSE nerf all over again - so much crying about how much it'll ruin the game and people threatening leaving and it left with a whimper. Didn't have a massive player drop off (at least not for that reason), didn't ruin combat since it's still broken. It'll be exactly the same with this too.
---
LIFE
---
Without game breaking bugs, preferably.
---
They should really hire someone for RPG and mechanics department so far it sems only working department is cosmetics and design altogether with bug fix department working on the game. Just wish they hire someone talented with similar ideas like we have.
---
It‚Äôs US Eastern Time - so should be 2am Sept. 9th down under. I think.
---
Radiation emitters?
---
&gt;just said "creation engine better" 
---
I never once said creation engine was "better". Game engines are not things that are fixed and ranked objectively. Some engines are better for certain things and bad at other things. Creation engine is great for the types of games bethesda makes.
---
&gt; No, creation engine cannot support thousands dynamic objects at the same time
---
But it can? That's why we've had them in nearly every elder scrolls and modern fallout game. Worlds littered with thousands of dynamic objects that can be interacted with. 
---
&gt;You have no idea how game engines work, especially the creation and unreal engine. So next time please do your own research before bad mouthing with that attitude.
---
I'm literally a degree-qualified developer
---
Game pass kiddy's. It's the same thing that happened to red Dead redemption 2 online.
---
Been selling for 5 months now never encountered a player who wouldn't stop buying when asked politely or been in a situation where I couldn't just server hop when almost maxed. I should be able to sell whatever I want without worrying out that I sell medium to high end seasons mostly about 20 - 30 usually at a time i like to have a variety for my customers
---
Thanks üëç
---
granted there wasn't a single usable drop out of all those but it was still really cool to see
---
When i respawned i still had most of of my health return.  Around 50 percent
---
&gt; Yep, the main problem with recycling missiles is that the terminal wants you to give them by packets of 3 instead of 1 
---
The problem for me is that 3 mini nukes won't even get me 12 shotgun shells. That's an absolute joke. Mini nukes are heavy and hard to find (at least in my play through so far). They should bring in plenty of points. 
---
If the point returns weren't so horrendous on the ammo converter, I'd be more than happy to use it, even if it was a pain. But as of right now, it's a pain AND useless. So I've just been sitting on a stash box that's 799/800 capacity and most of it's ammo. I've got to get on a discord chat somewhere and trade this stuff off. I can't bring myself to drop it and let it go to waste or waste it on ammo converter. 
---
I know it's way past Bethesda's capabilities but I wish they had a global ammo trader center. You could build one in your camp and use it to log into some trade network. Ammo would be 1 for 1 (for the basics), and the supplies would solely depend on what players put into it. So if I trade 100 rounds of 10mm for 100 shotgun shells, the global stash would now have +100 10mm rounds and -100 shotgun shells. 
---
If there wasn't any available ammo in the global trader stash, then you could use the ammo converter rates and what you put into that would get sucked into the global trader stash.
---
Oh, I met someone like that. I don't know if they are a girl or a little boy. First they asked me for backpack plan, I showed the way inside the Morgantown airport and then proceed to the tadpole mission to get a better backpack. I think they understand. After doing some primal cuts events?? they do that to share stuff with me. I acepted because maybe they wanted stimpaks or something like that but no, they wanted Chally's costume with mask included. Obviusly I didn't acept because I only have one Chally's mask and I think I can sell it for a better price, idk. The rest of the day I feel uncomfortable, having someone following me in all the map. They added me to friend list and I acepted... yep, is an error, but for some reason we haven't played since the day we met
---
Back when legendary scrip wasn‚Äôt a thing, it was an unspoken rule that if someone had Legendary weapons they didn‚Äôt want, they sold them to Friedrich at Whitesprings. You‚Äôd go there and he‚Äôd have tons of legendary stuff available for sale, especially if there was a nuke on whitesprings. People farming would duck inside to catch their breath and sell legendaries to him to lighten their load, then head back into the zone to farm more.  
---
It would be neat to start doing that again, but being behind a loading screen, I‚Äôd like to suggest the Whitesprings station instead. Since Whitesprings is kinda considered a hub of sorts anyways. We could dump stuff in the suitcases there or sell them to the station bot.
---
...it was Todd Howard saying ‚Äúfuck yo rng, nword.‚Äù And yes. I‚Äôm not black.
---
They never understand. My hobbies aren't your hobbies.
---
Awesome thanks!  I've ended up about 10 ranks short... I just bought a 1100 atoms pack to get caught up but I'm now one rank short and sitting on 100 atoms, lol. I think I've got time to grind that last one out tomorrow night tho.  I'll set an alarm for Eastern Time on my phone.  üòÅ üëçüèº
---
All you can do is pile on things that assist with damage and do away with crit/vats altogether. It'd be stuff like Tank Killer for the armor penetration. Adrenaline is an absolute must for horde encounters. Pick off all the weaklings first to build up your damage and then go ham with the damage buffs on the big guy.
---
You might also want to look into damage buff chems and maybe even perks to boost chems duration.
---
Otherwise you could go the stealth package and pull from their damage bonus stacks but you need something like 7-10 free perk slots from memory (3 sneak, 3 covert ops, 1 escape artist, maybe something else I forgot too).
---
I would definitely like to visit!
---
&gt;Face it Bethesda, who ever decided it was a good idea to reuse/repurpouse the SMART machine in watoga high school to become the ammo converter that person needs to get demoted to doing just Janitorial work.
---
Just think, somebody had the idea, then somebody spent time programming it, then somebody tested it out (that one might be a big assumption), and then somebody approved it. Not saying each step was a different individual, but there was definitely more than 1 set of hands on this.
---
Yeah, that made me have an immediate reaction of dislike for this post.  I already get enough bullshit for being a woman playing games that even more being advised is stupid.
---
Not seen awol like that. If anything I've seen just a 1/2 star only at the end as of late.
---
I did surface to air once and had 5 sb all legendary. Don't remember the number of stars on them though
---
Punji boards, stacked inside a floor. No magic about it, just a bit of exploiting.
---
Okay got it wrong then. Sounds like the two level 15 where cheerleader lol.
---
Then it was definitely a d\*ck move
---
As much as i agree with you (having encountered the same problem). There are unfortunately some garbage humans who play this. Just passing some advice that‚Äôs helped me
---
Have I told you about the time my Xbox shut itself off when I stood on top of the silo itself when the nuke launched? It said it was to prevent overheating but it wasn‚Äôt hot at all, fans were hardly running.
---
He's a pvp guy that uses legacies.
---
Why are you putting more than your max caps worth in your vending machines in the first place? 
---
You can't get pissy when someone buys your stuff if your to stupid to make sure you don't waste caps by putting to much on sale.
---
Good thought! I suppose according to Bethesda 2 years have already passed. So any time discrepancies could just be fixed by Bethesda establishing another time jump as well. I would definitely like to see the Super Mutants have their own arc in some future content. They tend to be treated like mindless mobs and nothing else
---
I mean, have you seen any of the other games from the fallout or elderscrolls series? The fans pretty much make the games for them.
---
Well it‚Äôs a 2 star legendary sniper which is level 10 tbh but I‚Äôm in the process of upgrading it to .50 ammo so the damage goes up to 109, also it gives 50% extra damage on VATS. My Fixer is level 40 also
---
I see now lol yes I feel u there i put 12 guns up for sale now. can't have that happen again. Appreciate the advice.
---
How this weapon performs on One Wasteland? Is it still thst good? Has anyone checked?
---
Very nice.
---
It's the only way to actually complete the event, to get the treasury notes in the least. You just need 25 ore and 1 scav alive to complete the event, 75 Ore will get you a chance at the Rad Barrel and Emmet Mt. Rad Suit.
---
I get that. Seriously never understood why we the owner of the damn machine cant just stop it when we like. There are a variety of reasons to do this.
---
Opposite for me; find myself online more often just to grind out levels as the changes to perk coins on the PTS actually has me interested in grinding out those levels to get a few more legendary perks straight to max.
---
Granted, of the 842 hours I've put into the game, only about 70-100 of that has been with a consistent group of people and that was during the first few months of launch and when Vault 94 was a thing.
---
Whoh hold your horses and back up. What pissy like you? Coming on my thread like an angry bull.
---
Well it‚Äôs your microphone day
---
Wait.... all I have to do is pay for dinner?
---
....gets out wallet......
---
wouldnt i see them? or doesnt he have to remove the floorboard?
---
That‚Äôs the damage it shows on my pip boy
---
Yea haha. That part was actually a little fun lol.
---
 
---
I heard a lot of people on here saying the event wasn‚Äôt for low levels. So when these 2 showed up I actually expected a lot of ‚Äúthumbs down‚Äù emotes. 
---
But they never came and Ofc that‚Äôs because this one guy knew it wouldn‚Äôt matter how many people attended. He would still completely melt him.
---
This is the way
---
His behavior was pretty unacceptable and then he abused the youtube strike system on a bunch of channels, getting one terminated. 
---
Gross dude.
---
Your story stinks. Where did you get four lunch boxes at all times for the entire run? And I used all the buffs that you talked about plus ran intelligence of nearly 60. It took me nearly a month of constantly grinding the repeatable XP at all the best places. And I used the double XP week to the fullest. I simply do not believe your story.  If you finished in a week you bought it or cheated.
---
You and me both my dude
---
This was where I put my first camp. Not much valuable recourses so I had to move. Doggo was cool though.
---
&gt; The camp building is the most frustrating, glitchiest shit I've ever dealt with. 
---
Somebody hasn't played Ark.
---
2 players on a private server. Run the nuke silo, one person stays at the nuke ready to launch. Other player summons impostor. Once he shows up player 1 lanches the nuke and fast travels to the other. You dont always get loot from him but you do get event loot
---
1984? Bitch please...
---
You probably got your post removed by a mod because you're complaining about something that has been complained about to a point that it's considered a retired topic.
---
Yeah, a lot of people thing a 3 star you give you a 3 star but that's just not how this game works.
---
It's good that you understand that Bethesda only responds to only threats to their short term revenue but don't expect any sympathy from the player base whilst doing so, especially if you come of a little entitled, like you're owed a 3\* legend from a 3\* enemy.
---
I came across a camp yesterday not on the map and the vending machines where still vending even though he wasnt 'listed' as selling. I just looked at the goods and moved on. If there was anything for sale I would have come back when it was on.
---
Not really no, I assume you have handed all the overseer tapes back to her for the scrip reward. Other than that there isn't any others that you need to keep.
---
Well remember most people have a self built pc. Consoles are out dated and much slower processing so we have like 5 FPS during Earle. We can‚Äôt help but take forever
---
It's right on the edge of Savage divide so I think that's why you get high level spawns.
---
Also I can currently only unlock rank killer and sneak
---
We‚Äôre forgetting the important question,are you ugly like they said?
---
Bc almost all new players didn‚Äôt buy the game, it was free like the expect everything else to be ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Entitled, yeah well never mind!
---
They might not weigh anything but the still put extra strain on a server and slow everything down do the decent thing and drop them. Plus it will help with lag when looking through your stash
---
Video or it didn't happen Mr YouTube
---
Exactly, since they didn‚Äôt pay for the game, they expect everything to be free
---
Bathe in the light of the atom!
---
Your post was removed because the suggestion you made is a retired topic under [Bethesda Plz](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz), Rule 10.
---
I'm not being pissy I'm just being straight to the point. We all know it's 30k limit so risking losing caps by not paying attention to what your selling is not the buyers issue why should they not buy something because you didn't plan ahead right. Maybe calculate what you'll earn and not go over instead of the usual "bethesda should fix/change this" mentally.
---
because they're all the people who got banned for duping and cheating lol.
---
Riding shotgun 3x 3star. 2x1 star and a 2 star.
---
Hurry man. Tell Bethesda about that!!!
---
This is why smart people only put into their vendors the amount that they have free to earn. No need to rush back. No threat to the loss of caps.
---
Also how was this person toxic? Think about it, you're calling a customer who is buying the items you're selling for the price you set them as toxic.
---
This is very much a you problem, not a them one.
---
who would do that anyway?
---
Excavator set can be gained via the quest someone else mentioned. Ultracite by completing the BOS quests that lead you to the top of Fort Defiance, and X-01 from becoming a General and gaining access to the military wing in the whitesprings bunker. Slight chance by scrapping pieces you find as well. Scorch Beast Queen seems to drop a lot of random plans too
---
I don't.
---
Cats out of the bag now
---
Keep an eye out for Graham, he's how I got my plan. High level blood eagles and occasional scorch carry handmades. But definitely keep an eye out for the plan, watoga/mire vendor not might carry it as well
---
Nah. Maybe in comparison to like...GTA Online. But as an example, Red Dead Online (I think the games were released around the same time) the character details are WAYYYY better. 
---
Bethesda graphics will always lag behind as long as they continue to use that outdated engine
---
I tried this 3x and haven‚Äôt gotten it I‚Äôve kept 1 &amp; 2 animals alive as well
---
Here's my [slugger/commando junkies PA build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=ff53b25&amp;d=pg2ph2pp2sm2s42ss2ee2ic4lt2i12pi2pr2se2a01s12eh0l71sb2c81&amp;w=sn2&amp;m=cf8h&amp;wp=w2&amp;wm=1b2133&amp;ad=0478a&amp;n=Swinging%20Commando). I'm pretty bummed there's no PA mod for reduced chem weight, I can't carry 100 stimpacks without traveling pharmacy, and that means giving up master slugger. For weapons I've got an instigating/swing speed super sledge and a junkies/swing speed/strength bone hammer. Also an anti-armor fixer of some kind. I farm whiskey (huge strength boost with party boy) and stay stocked with psychobuff.
---
Playing Poker has never been easier. Let me get that 30 dollar pot
---
Yeah can do, I'll give you an add.
---
Im talking about the person whom thought " oh lets reuse this complicated interface and put it as a primary utility item". Maybe whom ever approved of this hot mess needs a good demotion to Janitoral duties as well.
---
Have should checked your backpack mods on an armor workbench? It doesn‚Äôt tell you that you earn the backpack, it just unlocks
---
Nah, don't bother with that. Bethesda only responds to threats to their short term revenue. 
---
Just cancel your Fallout 1st sub over this issue and encourage others to do the same and post that this issue is the reason for it.
---
At a bare minimum you'll get a response from Bethesda. They did that with the vendor/display case issue a while back and they did it again more recently with the interior double wall feature that was temporarily removed.
---
I use normal armour (currently rolling my way towards a full set of secret service with the effects I want) but I always carry the chinese stealth suit for nuke zones or radiation rumble. I use a couple of DR/ER perks to boost my survivability which do require compromises with the rest of the build, but with those perks I'm not too squishy when I've got it on. The big downside is the stealthsuit is pretty expensive to repair if you are eating bullets while wearing it, which I why I usually save it for special occasions.
---
In terms of normal armour, you can be very stealthy providing one piece is chameleon gear, although you can't move invisibly like with the chinese stealth suit. With 11 agility, rank 3 Sneak and one piece of chameleon gear I can have enemies stand less than five metres away and not find me so long as I stay still. The nice thing is that because any armour piece can be chameleon, you may not have to wait too long to get a secret service piece with that legendary effect. Just remember that you need a silenced weapon or they'll find you anyway, and even silenced weapons make a little bit of noise up close.
---
Finally, you may know this already, but Blocker and Fireproof are really useful perks. The first one will make a significant difference to how much damage you take from melee attacks, the second will make you practically invulnerable to scorchbeast screams.
---
Man, I can't wait until my son is old enough to play with me.
---
A B/50L lmg can be magic, yes.
---
Heavy guns needs faster firerate if I recall correctly
---
If done right, you wont see the spikes.
---
Try logging out and back in.
---
I think i encountered this once, and when I googled it, it recommended logging out of the launcher and back in.
---
TSE Gauss rifle. Zero damage. Fireproof works.
---
ok.  good to know
---
My dad and I also play together almost nightly! We live in separate places though and he doesn't like wearing a headset so it's mostly like we both play fo76 separately, but on a team.
---
Cool do you need a certain armor piece to make it so?
---
Hey man im sorry low levels suck!! I just bought the game a week ago and high level players are so generous lol üòÜ ive had so many players stop by and drop me weapons and ammo without asking or help me with public events! I hope you run into some friendly newbies soon, we are out there!!
---
Casual clothing with shielded lining does. You need to upgrade it.
---
Game Pass brought me here. I love Fallout but the the bad press at launch kept me away from FO76. I had nothing to lose with Game Pass and I've really enjoyed it. I'm a much older player though and don't have time for that nonsense.
---
I've played MMOs long enough to recognize dicks and when I encountered my first trap house, I didn't realize what it was but I knew something was up. There were two players inside and they suddenly locked the doors. I fast traveled out before anything happened. It felt wrong though. This sub has been very helpful in my learning curve.
---
Outside of that one experience, it's been great. I'm mostly solo but I recently realized you can solo in a team while getting the team bonus. Every day is still a new experience. I've had a couple of players help me out with equipment. I feel bad taking it but don't want to insult their generosity. I pay them back by helping others. I leave plans, armor, weapons, and ammo in low level stations and by the Wayward.
---
I avoid most direct interaction with other players though because I believe in minding my business.
---
All in all, my experience has been very positive and I don't really care that the game is imperfect because it's fun for me.
---
Yes riding shotgun I‚Äôve encountered that a lot and I‚Äôve had good drops not for my build but awesome for scrip or caps from selling
---
That sucks, sorry man. 
---
But umm, you should def use nukacrypt instead of finding codes and decoding them. 
---
https://nukacrypt.com
---
It's OK as long as you were in the peeing section.
---
Cool thanks. Might try this out later. 
---
I hear if you tag the sheepsquatch even while its invuln you can still get loot.. gotta try that too
---
Keep all of Abbie's holotapes. Too cute to throw away.
---
300 mini nukes may not exist as an option to give you  as no one play tested the ammo converter.
---
So would i need to purchase a ffr lmg to be magic?. Sorry for being dumb i should watch sum vids tbh
---
Bethesda has said this isn't going to happen. The politics and financial difficulties of getting XBox and PS4 to play nice with each other is a rare event.
---
To be fair i found 76 made my salty when i tried it. As every single aspect of the game was simply disappointing. Oh you put a point into this stat at this level? No max rank perk for you until max level respec. Not enough storage? Its actually hard on our servers to add more storage, Introuducing junk storage as a paid feature, Get an extra loot perk, wait 50  seconds for the loo to load to get it empty,   
---
Literally every single aspect of this game is flawed, lazy, and needlessly bad. Everything. When it dosn't have to be. If they gave one fuck and made it OK it would be worth playing.. but this is the kind of shit that demands torches and pitchforks.
---
Methinks players who are capable of pulling it off are skipping the event at this point and that's why you encountered this.   I have been skipping the event myself lately, because I have gotten all the rewards and because farming the hell out of it has  drained my stimpaks and ammo.  I spent over a month stockpiling ammo and stimpaks preparing for the event before it launched but running the event over and over has drained my supplies and I have been trying to build them back up again.
---
Tried when i got back in it said my free trial is over and i habe to purchase it again. But it makes no sense since ive been playing on this account since launch
---
76 is more bug than game though... more bugs is practically an expansion.
---
Thanks for the heads up! PA doesn‚Äôt use animation for stims do it might work while in PA
---
WOW thanks I didn‚Äôt know it applies like that thanks my dude now one more question what are the requirements for the bear arm mods I‚Äôve already learned the bear arm plan
---
also, clean water and fire extinguishers
---
Yes I noticed going threw all my notes and plans the lag wasn‚Äôt so bad I‚Äôll get rid of the holowtapes next I forgot about those
---
Do you nap in Nuke Zones often? I'm no nuke-napologist but that doesn't sound healthy.
---
Huh didn‚Äôt know they even had play testers on payroll. Thought those people were as rare as getting a 3 star legendary from a 3 star enemy
---
Tbh I'm not sure haven't studied it at all, Ive just watched 1 video about it to really know about what to trade and it's value.. People do be trying to lowball hustle you on here if you don't know what you're holding ü§î limb damage and crippling armor perks only works for shotguns
---
I use fireproof and do zero damage to myself with all explosive weapons, except my fe 5mm gat, after 50 or so shots it barely tick at my health, also immune to all grenades, fatman etc.
---
Stick with one thing. Increasing stash space is a server thing, there are technical limitations on increasing it.
---
Introducing a weekly limit of a design choice, that doesn't stop the game functioning
---
No problem! Those I do think you need to keep multiple animals alive and then it‚Äôs RNG. Very rare. I‚Äôve ran the event a bunch and never got those mods  to drop ever. I purchased mine from some stranger a few months back
---
They couldn‚Äôt fix score throughout the entirety of a season where you needed score to progress. Do you really think they will fix those again?
---
And the strangler pa has extra damage if you have all the pieces
---
Does not work
---
sorry but this reminds me of this video lol
---
https://youtu.be/5EBn7Dk-4Cc
---
Yep.
---
Not sure about the daily quests, but the challenges are fixed and can be completed now.
---
Ok any idea how much the puncturing should run me?
---
Nice. I tried playing with my son, I gave him all sorts of good stuff, He got bored after level 50 üòÇ
---
This sounds like the exact same thing that I had encountered.
---
Re-logging fixed it for me, but since it didn't work for you I'd suggest contacting Bethesda.
---
FUCK STAIRS
---
You‚Äôre in luck. Vault 94 is coming back with 22. Not as a raid, but as a daily op you can also explore whenever you want.
---
And 51 has a build area near it, and perhaps the door will open for us to explore in adventure.
---
Not for me üòÅ
---
Yeah already send in a Ticket. The trial thing comes up when i open the game over the .exe and log in from the main screen. Gives me the error code 4:8:2009
---
I had about 6 legendary wolves at a primal cuts during meat week. unfortunately all low level crap.
---
Didn't notice this issue myself. :o
---
When they amputate the wrong legs occasionally I have my questions...
---
Those are good weapons. Unless you're bloodied, armor can't really help you with damage any more than by providing a stealth boost, so you'll have trouble improving upon stealth armor. Consider wearing PA for ACP since it can let you more or less ignore the wendigo spawns and spend more time targeting Earl, that's what I do with my pistols/shotgun character. Tankiness a fun feeling. 
---
I was wearing a full set of vanguards heavy combat armor, with excavator armor for mine runs that I'd step into for nuke zones and ACP, then realized there was really no advantage to regular armor other than stealth for my build so I'm going for T-65 power armor and a set of chameleon/improved stealth heavy combat armor. Pricey and grindy though, the PA takes forever and just a the chameleon/stealth chest piece cost me 5k.
---
I'm on PC, ill keep a look out for it in vending machines. I just like to collect all the named things, I have a mule for that.
---
i did 20 and got none and then got 2 in a row.
---
Different faction.
---
There isn't a power armor bench, but Vault Tec has a weapon bench and 2 armor benches. And none of them where exclusives in a bundle. Hell, one of them was (kinda) free
---
I need a crew...
---
High lvl players can be dicks to... Been to a couple caps where they wait for you to open the vendor and out some glitchy stuff that kills you... Then i wonder, why... For gods sake why did you just kill me for no gain? Anyway i was going to nuke his camp and he left as soon as i fast travelled to the nuke silo.
---
I have a bloodied limb damage lmg. It does proc the damage bug but can be unreliable.
---
I had never had sludge lung in over 300 levels and intentionally got it a few weeks ago just to to have it not count for me as well.
---
I did see some posts from over a year ago saying it can sometimes register if you go get it with another disease already active.  Have not bothered to try doing this yet so can't say if it will work.
---
Nope, the armor is just a requirement for the shotties.
---
Sludge Lung is Definitely Bugged, it‚Äôs the last one I‚Äôm missing and I have gotten it from both breathing toxic air and from a diseased Wendigo and it still hasn‚Äôt ticked for me...
---
Self harm? More like self flatline
---
I received a couple of badges recently from the the event.
---
Get another disease first and then get sludge lung. And if that doesn‚Äôt work change servers.
---
The challenge is bugged but I was able to make it work by using this method.
---
So a cursed magic minigun can take out Earle in 2 seconds instead of 3?  Sounds great.
---
Here‚Äôs an example of the exact opposite. Attended a scorch event last night Xbox - 15ish high level players. The queen landed several times and we fended off 5 different waves of mobs. After 15 mins we failed the event. I‚Äôm level 161 - my handmade was doing 6 dmg. Plenty of thumbs down and angry emotes.
---
Yeah, it pays off to kill the wendigo spawns, I love the ammo return for my 2mm gauss shotgun. Sometimes they only drop screws, fiber and teeth though.
---
I know. Don't get me wrong, ops look cool, but the raids, specifically the puzzles and team coordination, were unmatched content. I've been playing Division 2 since finishing legendary run. Their second raid Iron Horse was delayed to incorporate feedback from first raid Dark Hours, and playing through, running objectives, made me nostalgic for 76 raids. There's nothing better than the feeling of completing a puzzle, having everybody working together like a well oiled machine, and knowing you can trust your teammates to do their thing.
---
Campfire Tales event?
---
When you have an acorn dick, you gotta compensate somehow.
---
Brill thanks you
---
Only reliable multi legendary spawn I've found is the woof pack event.
---
This is why PVP was created.
---
Step 1: initiate PVP
---
Step 2: Bonk over the head with super sledge 
---
Step 3: Profit 
---
But for real, if they have chosen the way of pain, let them have it.
---
Fireproof and dense mod do not work with legacies. They work with any non-legacy. If you have a legacy and shoot at the ground or shoot something too close, you are going to lose health crazy fast and die. 
---
You can stack fireproof/dense but honestly, just choose if you would like rather use 3 perk points or use up a chest slot. Either way, these perks do NOT work with legacies.
---
Would be easy to add since Steelheart has all the voice lines at the ready
---
Lunch boxes came from other ppl mostly. Stopped grinding for xp and went to a queen fight. Others opened waaaaay to many. So 4 boxes at all times was never a problem. This was before double score and I lost a 3rd of my dailys to the glitch. The other half I found it was just easier to get 1200 xp outta a super mutant instead of doing the dailys. Mutants max out there for xp. I don't think your far off, and im trying to figure out where you went wrong. I ran for 12-16hours  daily. The satellite array, west tek, harpers, burrows, and golf club. Workshops were 4000k xp from each take and retake. I'd claim and go clear out a place and come back for the retake, it's faster. Claim the next shop, clear out a place and go back for the retake. The wife got all her dailys except 1 day, and we had to fight over who was going where to kill stuff.
---
Console or PC? It seems like your not telling the entire story.
---
Automatic fire gutsies are stupidly op, together with mirelurk kings. I'm sure that these could kill a scorchbeast
---
NW kills count too.  If you grind the challenges it don't take long.
---
So heavy guns needs both faster firerate and bugged effect?
---
It seems like you‚Äôre not reading the whole post lol. 
---
It says PS4 in the description XD
---
Cool as fuck
---
Damnit I really wish you were on my platform
---
No. Black Desert looks so much better. Also this is likely a pc screenshot and not representative of Hope the game looks on consoles.
---
The Universe works in mysterious ways, the RNG in Wastelanders predictably sucks.üòé
---
Got rid of all holos except game ones and my stash box lag is a lot better.  Maybe I should do notes next
---
Quit crying. Take your cursed shovel and flux and come back next nuke.
---
As a sort of PSA, when you walk past the first laser grid, the computer announces if you don't have a keycard.
---
They‚Äôre on the record as saying they won‚Äôt switch because they can make a game quick and cheap with this engine hence why we see bugs from over a decade ago in this game. They‚Äôre gonna be laughed out next gen if they don‚Äôt get with the times.
---
Yes. I am short on sludge lung and woopsies and have been for about 18 months. I keep getting them from time to time but the counter doesn't ever upgrade. I've also collected two copies of every Grognak magazine but the game is stuck at 9/10 or whatever.
---
Ok. Glad we got that out there in the open.
---
We spent 3 days making 2k work of berry mentats, and 85 brain bombs just to prep for the xp weekend. Ran our curator card and split the 50 leader bobbleheads we had hoarded away. It wasn't a "fun" grind. It fucking sucked. We just didn't want to have to grind without the 2 XP. She finished an hour before it ended.
---
Lol you clearly didn‚Äôt get the point of the post.
---
Frankly, I only played the raid once due to its instability. The puzzles were cool, but being on the clock and not being an extreme dps or sneak build was never fun, and it became worse when I had to slowly watch the other two people I was with crash out as we went.
---
Can glitch through doors/gates more easily than walls. But you can also glitch through walls
---
Hells yeah! Make the world a better place üëç
---
Had it hundreds of times since beta, one of several bugged challenges.
---
üò¢
---
Yo screw those ash piles (and others) never disappearing. They screw up PC too. Engine goes haywire.
---
Especially when they have like 5+ legacies and what not
---
Mine makes them catch on fire too. Is that normal? Really great for sniping scorcheds.
---
\*Zips the tent closed and goes back to sleep\*
---
half the time i end up trying to solo it.  people quit or are just useless
---
I think it's spikes.
---
Ay nice.  Love this outfit.  Had a set previously (that I traded away) and just traded to get it back.
---
If they did that, a lot of players would burn through all the challenges on one day, leaving them six days free to not play the game... potentially letting them play another live service game, which consumes more of their time and money, meaning they end up quitting FO76. Gotta keep people hooked on the drip feed to sustain this awful business model that has taken over the games industry ü§Æ
---
There's a Clandestine one (full black) in the files, not released yet. More will be and have been released. A regular "forest camo" has already been in the atomic shop. And I expect more releasing with the next seasons.
---
The deep pocket limb mods are here. They're in the vault
---
Tried that with discover Beckley. Didn't work.
---
Bethesda Janitorial Services does have a nice ring to it
---
I was hoping the SPECIAL ones would be more like brain implants
---
I feel your crew, to be honest. Based on what I've seen on the PTS, One Wastelanders will be my exit point after 1000+ hours in this game. I don't mind the bugs and glitches or any of this stuff, but this is definitely a game I don't want to sweat my ass off to play, at least not at my current level. For me, there's no point on One Wastelanders because the ability to kill strong enemies (not talking about the SBQ, Imposter Sheepsquatch and Earle, these are another thing) and walking through the Bog, Mire and other high-level places without worrying is what makes all the grind worthy, it's what I've grind for and fine tuned my build for during all these 1000 hours.
---
Some people might say a little more challenge can make the things interesting and I agree with then, but this should be an option as it is today, and not something mandatory. I mean an option because today anyone can easily make the game more challenging any time they want by just unequipping perks and swapping legendary guns and armor for non-legendary and lower level ones easily craftable at any time, I do that whenever I want a more challenging experience and I go back to my gear when I just wanna chill, all I wish is that I could keep this option...
---
Well... brawling chemist is apparently doing that from its description.
---
I got the deep pocket mods. Thanks for the reply.
---
Kim saw his haircut for the first time and killed himself.
---
It‚Äôs a ‚Äúfeature‚Äùnot a bug.
---
It is clear that some people emerging from the vault are low level akts, but I'm still gonna drop them a few stimpaks, radaways and water if I happen to be there at the same time.
---
I dump junk in suit cases all the time and plans.  I need fo1st, but I don‚Äôt want to pay them for nerfing the game.
---
I'll remember this, normally I collect ore so I wanna try to get all the xp this time around
---
I  stopped bothering with the event once I got the fixer plans.   Too many things wrong with this event that Bethesda won't bother to fix. The activation issue is one of them, the other is the respawn bug.   I have encountered the respawn bug on this event more than any other event and as a result lost out on rewards many times.
---
Happens to me too.. Even when using handmades or fixer
---
Errr Yea.... I play at 1440p, asus strix 1080ti on ultra and the game still looks like a game released 8 years ago?
---
I‚Äôm mainly referring to how people on this sub expect new players to act a certain way or they won‚Äôt grace them with free items lol like don‚Äôt bother if that‚Äôs how you view it lol
---
Would be nice if the powerswitch would actually work, as it should. Patch 23 maybe??
---
Yea... those interwebs really mess with the gigasmegz dont they in the anti ali-assing...
---
got to scrap fire axes to learn the mod. You have a 20% chance. So you need to get the plan for fire axes. or find loads. Grahm sells the plan or you have a small chance to find it on firebreather or responder firefighter corpse. 
---
or you can ask someone to mod it for you.
---
As annoying as the fast travel bug is this one is actually worse for people who use heavy weapons imo. Reloading constantly and having to do a melee attack to stop it, then spin up your gun again while fighting Earle is a pain in the ass.
---
The problem with the raids were performance and stability. Hands down. But without extreme dps Dead in the Water was doable, washout (novice) was soloable, and meltdown, once you knew where things were, was easy with a good team.
---
Still wish they had PTS before raids and could've focused on pushing perfect version live, but sick is life
---
Usually I drop my plans off in the bag cart by the npc‚Äôs at vault 76
---
got 5 legendaries in a heart of the swamp last week. nothing good though.
---
If they're running away from u and not now what to do when u r approached to them there is a highly chance that they re truly new player :)
---
I just posted a complaint about this event the other day and hardly got any traction. Go figure, that's kind of how reddit works.
---
Anyway, I've long been saying that this event is too expensive to play. Nearly 2k caps plus a flux just to start the damn thing, then I will typically burn through 10-20 stimpacks activating the pylons and taking hits from the ISS and waves of adds.  It's stupid.  Launching a nuke and doing Scorched Earth costs me far less to do (although it does take more time, obviously).
---
I spent alot of time making a base near the scorchbeast queen making it look like a fort putting up the chain link fence with watch towers and bunkers but people never show up unless the queen is active. But I have had somone message me about my base looking nice. And I'm fine with the budget I just wish I had more area to build in
---
Funny, the opposite happened to me, I've only seen flying invisible level 200s who instakill me with a fat man (one of them even teabagged me, what an honour.), and I'm level 10. You see all the veterans on here complaining that new players are dicks, probably because veterans/this community is not as nice as you think.
---
&gt; Also 800 stash needs to double 
---
That's never happening. It was a shitfight to go from 400 to 800. 
---
&gt; Camp budget needs to double 
---
That may likely come (perhaps even more) but not the way you'd want it to. It'd be a separate interior instance.
---
&gt; Maybe with luck if enough people ask it makes it in eventually 
---
Nah. That's not happening. If it did, it would have happened already. It'd take people to stop spending money on Bethesda until these problem are sorted for them to even address it.
---
Even then, they're not going to be able to with the technical limitation ones like the stash and camp budget (not counting instances)
---
Also, one general thing you're overlooking is that dailies spreads out server load. If we only had weeklies, there would be massive server load spikes on peak gamplay days like the weekend.
---
I'd much prefer a system of rolling dailies. So the dailies remain exactly the same but you can bank say 2-3 days worth of them. 
---
So if you scrip daily, it's still only 150 but if you wait 3 days, you can scrip 450. However, if you wait any longer than 3 days, the max is still 450. It eases thing on our end so that you can comfortably skip a day or two without feeling like you lost anything but at the same time still helps a little to deal with server load issues. 
---
Straight up weeklies only I don't think will ever happen with this game.
---
WHO LEFT THE TOILET SEAT UP AGAIN?!
---
You wanna grind out the next board together. We can knock that shit out stupid fast. I'm on ps4. Then you can see how we did it. You gotta bring your own cems though, relish, bobbleheads ect. I got 15 lunch boxes I'll share with you.
---
Good for you OP
---
If only PC and PS4 could play together...
---
Just try not too die!  
---
Tips: i was playing unyielding bloodied, i stopped and i rarely die now if for i try to close combat a mirelurk queen ...  
---
Plus you can store your important junk and there's a lot of guys with survival tents around and you can absolutely use the stashbox.  
---
For Earl grab a piece of asbestos lined modded chest armor, it helps!
---
You know what? Thanks for reminding me. I think I have the fire axe plan if player is on Xbox. Or I can mod it.
---
I try to just run around and dodge shots until the frames stabilize. Sometimes I just get non-stop frame drops and can't do anything. It's been worse than ever the past few weeks for some reason.
---
I think the half your level thing has been debunked, all you need is animal friend to tame stuff, Wasteland Whisperer to tame other stuff.
---
When you start reloading at like 12 rounds, switch to another weapon and then switch back and you should be able to finish the fusion/plasma core
---
That's the thing, it's not powered so why would it still work? Everything else needs constant power to run so why is this different?
---
Yes the scorched one handed upside down shotguns that then morph into pipe pistols on death is the epitome of "working as intended"
---
Which is what bethesda told me when i asked for a refund. No, Because its working as intended. I even offered to sign an NDA if they would just admit they duped everyone. :p
---
&gt;They‚Äôre on the record as saying they won‚Äôt switch because they can make a game quick and cheap with this engine 
---
Yeah no they aren't. They're on record saying that they wont switch because this engine works for what they want to make.
---
God damn this subreddit is filled with morons that don't understand anything about game development. Holy fucking shit.
---
Much less toxic than GTA.
---
Nah, it's not counter intuitive. It just doesn't power creep builds much. It just rounds them out a little more.
---
I am on Xbox actually!
---
40% bashing damage is a magic or broken effect on shotguns. Flechettes turns the harpoon into a shotgun. So there you go.
---
Yes I‚Äôm on Xbox :)
---
They should have done what GW2 did, PVP builds are separate from PVE builds. In PVP, you are automatically brought to level cap and have everything unlocked. So the difference in a fight is down to the player.
---
I can do that in about 5-10. Would that be okay?
---
No I know how to cancel it. The point is that it cuts out your DPS and forces you to commit like 10 seconds to stashing/pulling out your weapon. That's 10 seconds of pure vulnerability. If you're doing PVP you WILL die in that time because everyone and their mother runs bloodied one-shot builds
---
I'd rather not have season 2 armor ace and the devs take time to fix these issues instead.  
---
There are lots of atom bugs.  There was even a bug where it gave you thousands of free atoms a few days back.  They soon fixed that one quickly.
---
Entitlement, it‚Äôs the battlecry of the younger generation
---
You can easily kill someone's spirit with a mean heart. The Purveyor Mmmrgh seems like a nice moleminer lady surely she has someone special in her life.üòâ
---
I meant based solely on what the name of the cards would imply, not their effects. They are written in a way that makes sense, it just seems odd that the cards wouldn‚Äôt be better on a maxed out stat than a low stat.
---
My agility going from 4 to 9 doesn‚Äôt seem very legendary to me compared to boosting my int from 15 to 20, which I won‚Äôt be doing because I would basically be wasting the perk.
---
It's primarily a scope thing. You weapon doesn't wander when you hip fire it and I haven't notice any improvements to stability whilst hip firing.
---
All I've noticed is that it keeps the scope dead straight (if both arms are modded) without the need to hold your breath.
---
It's possible, I now a dude with a hacked gun and it's on ps4.
---
I could see someone with max strength/intelligence going for those to boot them higher for damage/xp.
---
In the case of Encryptid, I really don't like  bother with it, regardless of what players show up.   Having skilled players does help, but it does not guarantee against failure.  I have missed out on loot countless times due to bugs. It has happened more with Encryptid than any other event. Sometimes the body simply vanishes.  Other times I have experienced the respawn bug.
---
That‚Äôs probably going to be the reason they‚Äôre going to implement cross platform
---
I once saw a level 2 emerge from the vault chucking orbital strike grenades. Not sure if it was a hacker or an alt, I'm going to assume alt.
---
Vault 51 could be like Area 51. Secret Flatwood Monster base.
---
Just out of curiosity: why would you want one?
---
It seems so unbalanced imo
---
Yeah lol I guess just send me a friend request and I‚Äôll invite ya!
---
LMAO, classic Bethesda.
---
Same.  I must have had if 50 times.
---
Sure. It‚Äôs something I considered as well, but doing that causes you to lose out on the more useful part of the perk - the ability to equip more perk cards, since it won‚Äôt add anymore slots past 15.
---
Cool. 
---
I‚Äôll send one from the phone right away
---
I honestly expect the devs to open it up so we can explore the ‚Äòlobby‚Äô of 51 in survival mode.
---
Yeah i know but at least u dont have 50 plasma cores at 1% durability and yes, it is anoying
---
Yeah... this is how is lost legendaries.. thought that having the switch off means it is off. Lesson learned I lock the doors now and watch my caps not to get near 30K.
---
Wait so this outfit is rare?
---
Well you are right but you can get a bunch more points in other areas you maybe neglected before.
---
I'm torn on what to take still. Lol
---
‚ÄúFor *Fallout 76* we have changed a lot,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúThe game uses a new renderer, a new lighting system and a new system for the landscape generation. For *Starfield* even more of it changes. And for *The Elder Scrolls 6*, out there on the horizon even more. We like our editor. It allows us to create worlds **really fast** and the modders know it really well. There are some elementary ways we create our games and that will continue because that **lets us be efficient** and we think it works best.‚Äù [https://gamingbolt.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-and-starfield-engines-discussed-by-todd-howard-most-people-dont-understand-the-word-engine](https://gamingbolt.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-and-starfield-engines-discussed-by-todd-howard-most-people-dont-understand-the-word-engine)
---
The results of them using a engine that can create worlds really ~~shitty~~ **fast** and ~~broken~~ **efficient** is why 2 years later we are still dealing with a embarrassing flow of bugs and horrible performance. How you can interpret it as anything other than laziness and being cheap is beyond me. They have literally always been a generation behind in terms of game play capabilities in Elder Scrolls and Fallout.
---
And assuming it does truly work for what they want it to do then they want their games to buggy messes lacking all types of modern functions from widescreen support to cross-saves?
---
"Here's some nice new cards to help boost you. But first let's nurf the old ones. So it doesn't matter."
---
I don't understand. Is this different than the set you get for free from the responder's quest line?
---
Obviously the most important part of the perk is the damage because after the nerf my optimized BSSS unarmed build will do the same damage as a pipe rifle.  /s
---
Same as you friend just curious to see what they do tbh. I have quite a few op legacies but never really use them they are more of a collector's item for me
---
Absolutely!! I've had to swear off PVP until it gets fixed because the time it takes me to stash/pull out my weapon is enough time for any bloodied build to kill you, ya feel
---
They didn‚Äôt nerf any perk specifically. They just changed how damage is calculated to make it easier to work with on their end. Every build was affected.
---
This also isn‚Äôt related to the post.
---
Hitting the pipe is a core part of WV culture. Bethesda understands this.
---
I wish I could upvote more the engine is almost 2 decades old or more just dump it already
---
Oh I see. 
---
I‚Äôm also a heavy collector lol. 
---
Just more on the cosmetic side. 
---
But cool. Thanks for the fair reply
---
Thats cool. I play with my husband and son.  My son and i did the fireman quest together ‚ù§  we also have our camps right next to each other most of the time.  Makes the game more fun when you can play with ppl you know.
---
Destroy their camp.
---
Same. I‚Äôve seen it on handmade and combat auto rifles. Usually happens in intense fighting like ACP.
---
Nice that's my other favorite event to do, I've only gotten three at most before
---
I know. That's what I said. Lol.
---
Do a gun bash instead of swapping weapons, it stops the reload and is much faster.
---
It‚Äôs a feature. Designed to immerse you in an uncertain apocalyptic future.
---
There's a set of cultists with a tiny hilltop shrine next to the fairgrounds.  If you've done Leader of the Pack often enough, you'll find it.
---
Rarely, there will be a high-level Mothman standing in front of the shrine.  Trying to attack it will make it vanish.
---
Its was probably being used to ferry items to a mule.
---
How are you liking the game so far? Been deciding whether to resubscribe to gamepass (pc) again to try it or just purchase it somewhere that had it on sale.
---
It says your offline so I can‚Äôt invite.
---
This game is trash, but yeah the other players is the best part
---
&gt;How you can interpret it as anything other than laziness and being cheap is beyond me. 
---
Probably because I actually have development experience and know how these things work instead of being an armchair developer on reddit that thinks everything should be done from scratch every single time.
---
Bru I started last month... I could make only meat week and SCORE season 1... I think the aim of a game is to have fun, screw not following the meta or missing out events... If u enjoyed the game come back when u have free time, don't have fomo for a game
---
I'm level 333 and have never done this one will ha e to check it out thanks
---
Pure luck but I have heard that the longer you're on the server, the better RNG, though I don't expect it to be true, but you can try it.
---
I have an auto quad handmade that rarely makes it down to 0, normally is "empty" in the 30s
---
Why are they always level 7s? I had one approach me last night at the White spring ts. I‚Äôm wary when anyone approaches me. The joys of being a woman. I FT to the hotel and didn‚Äôt see them again. I would like to point out I met a lovely 112 a couple days ago at the WS and we ran around killing ghouls together.
---
Just finishing a ciggy. I‚Äôll be there in 2
---
Wish you were on pc so I could kidnap ya into mine lol.
---
Nice!
---
Ikr? I started a new character yesterday to make leveling up for score easier and was immediately hunted down by a guy over level 300. I felt bad and awkward that he thought I was new and was trying to help me so I just followed him around for a couple minutes (I didn‚Äôt take any gifts nor was I going to if he offered any because I don‚Äôt really plan on playing the character) but this dude got really huffy waiting on me while I was doing what he told me to do and I was like ????? Then a couple minutes later he accused me of taking advantage of him because I ‚Äúgave it away because I knew how to aim‚Äù then he demanded I tell him if I was an alt or not or he was going to hack me, and I was like why tf don‚Äôt you start out asking people that question? Also you probably shouldn‚Äôt be helping noobs if you‚Äôre that impatient and quick to jump to conclusions if someone can aim lmfao.
---
I just wish I could set up more than one camp at a time.
---
I tend to get 1 stars , but I have gotten 4 before
---
That‚Äôs how me and my buddies are, never really needed to be on a headset except to chat, if you‚Äôre a good player playing with other good players I can‚Äôt think of a moment that requires a ton of coordination, other than trying to get newer players to stand in the right place during boss fights
---
This is also true...I often forget because I use my flamer so infrequently.
---
Also, unrelated question since I‚Äôve never seen anyone on this reddit use the term:
---
What exactly is a creep build?
---
Do you mean a strange build that doesn‚Äôt fit the meta, or something else?
---
No idea, keep failing bug wave when I do it now. Even with loads of people.
---
That's true 95% of the time only the 3 star at the end
---
I have a outfit set and all plans
---
Dang that sucks
---
I can‚Äôt get heat flashes
---
Want me to mod it for you? Free of charge of course. it only uses a few materials.
---
Inorite besides this game is brain dead easy until the game starts sending you into high level areas but that about to be fixed. The most help you can give any one is junk and bullets
---
Take out whatever its sitting on
---
Yea but I also have it happen when fighting regular enemies
---
I have no idea how to do that lol but I would!
---
Only strangler heart and excavator
---
Just like in life, you get some good and some bad, don't let them get to you!
---
I would LOVE this!
---
Yeah, I was basically considering Vanguard armor as well. I only use a set of Excavator power armor for travelling and mining, since I currently use the stealth suit I don't even need it for rad resists.   
---
I just checked, a full set of Vanguard (combat or scout) armor is kinda pricey too, though it feels like grinding the caps is significantly easier than bullions though.
---
Thats what I thought too but both items are sitting on the ground. :(
---
&gt; My agility going from 4 to 9 doesn‚Äôt seem very legendary to me compared to boosting my int from 15 to 20, which I won‚Äôt be doing because I would basically be wasting the perk. 
---
That's one way of looking at it. 
---
Or you could look at it from the point of view of where you had at most 3 specials at 15 to now having 5 specials at 15. Throw in unyielding and that's 5 specials at 30.
---
Either situation seems pretty legendary to me.
---
Strange I can‚Äôt invite you for some reason lol.
---
Yes, only 500 atoms.
---
I mean it‚Äôs not stunning or anything but just a bunch of foundations surrounding a couple squares of no foundations in the water :)
---
Ooof maybe leave world and come back to it? Or have someone attack you and destroy said item
---
I‚Äôm Joining you now ü§ôüèº
---
12 pm New York time
---
Happens to me with all of my handmades and even my quad Tesla. The last one is especially infuriating because it reloads after 15 or 20 rounds and that completely defeats the purpose of me using a *quad* tesla.
---
ACP gave me 3 last night. A piece of wood armor, a shovel that says it has vampire but doesn't work(or it restores too little to notice) and a cursed shovel.
---
Reload session or find a new and see if that fixes it
---
Skin peel is a rare treat if prepared properly, try frying it in a pan with a little bit of butter and garlic, delicious.
---
I seem to have issues with a lot of other challenges. Not sure how to fix any of them.
---
I inboxed them and said I would give them caps for the fixer plans, I also thought it was a mistake, but they said to enjoy.  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Makes you wonder why this is the case...I had to buy the camo to have Stealth and the Jetpack on the armor at the same time.
---
I've gotten one. It seems like a low chance tbh
---
Yes please! My gt is Makok Izichi (I know I know) lol
---
There are ways to get it to register, it's just extra hoops to jump through, and a lot of finger crossing.
---
There are only a few guns in the game that can do that and they are all bloodied
---
We used to have only 400 stash. Also, mule accounts exist for a reason LOL.
---
I know that these limits are a pain in the ass, but, ultimately it means people would log on less frequently if they met a weekly limit in a day or two which defeats Bethesda's need for us to log on every day and grind.
---
i must have been vaccinated for the whoopies as a child.  cant catch it.  üòí
---
I'm gonna stand up for us noobs here and say the established community of this game is nowhere near as nice as everyone tries to make out, just listen to the fucking people in the comments complaining about new players to this (let's be real) waning game, acting like celebrities being followed by the paparazzi, the only high levels I've met either completely ignored me, or just griefed me, I don't even know the key to chat. I don't ask for loot because I don't know what's worth anything nor do I have space to carry much around, maybe I'm just unlucky but I've yet to meet a single soul who would even use the voip, let alone help me. It's not a difficult game, but it feels a bit pointless having more interactions with the settler NPCs than with players.
---
What if befriending the Mothmen made you a cultist and it irreversibly made Raiders and Settlers hostile? Kinda like a real-life life choice? That way you'd need to think about your choices.
---
Or, rather than irreversible, you could go back to non-hostile but never friendly because the Raiders and Settlers wouldn't trust a former cultist.
---
I have received 6 from the event. It seems to be a random reward.
---
vampire is always a tiny bit works best on very fast firing or swinging things, my vampire faster swing speed mole miner claws are fun, but a vampire minigun will let you tank most anything
---
I heard bad things about the gauss pistol... the shotgun is awesome though!
---
Amazing.. what a wonderful come up
---
*they aren't at war yet*
---
OP knows. Otherwise it would say, "To the people who swam in my ool."
---
I hope you're not referring to the FO1st me as being kinda free lol.
---
Ah. I think you zeroed in on the wrong words.
---
It's not power \[creep builds\] it's \[power creep\] builds. In other words builds that just increase in power because of the stat increase i.e. the power of that build creeps even further to being more powerful because of the hypothetical stat increase.
---
I considered using perks to boost ER/DR as well, but ultimately decided against it. Especially with the legendary perks coming up I can't afford to use any additional perks (I'm only level 80 or so), besides the fact that I already have too many perks I want compared to the available perk slots. You are correct about the repair prices for the stealth suit though.  
---
Yeah, I think I used chameleon before we got the stealth suit, I remember having that on one or two pieces. It would be one of my top choices for an armor set, the other one being vanguard. As mentioned, the question is wether to grind for the secret service armor or just try to buy a set of combat/scout armor instead with those attributes. Oh yeah, and I use blocker already, thanks :)
---
Alas, when I'm in PA and using big guns I'm fully optimized for damage and horrifically overencumbered. AP is not exactly in abundance for me lol
---
popping on right meow. GT is rammadeus. My camp is near top of the world. 
---
and that's a great GT.
---
That seems even worse since settlers and raiders don‚Äôt have dungeons around for you to clear out. That would just lock you out of the story and make every random NPC you find hostile.
---
Nah, referring  to power creep:  
---
A certain flaw in game  balance design, where content released later tends to get more powerful  as time goes. This can be seen in multiplayer games that have regular  expansions or balance patches.  
---
Power Creep can also refer to the average increase in relative power for all released content in a game. The changes described by Power Creep happen slowly and might not be noticed by the players for a while, until comparisons are made, hence the "creeping". 
---
Thank you Urban Dictionary for putting into words better than I could...
---
been getting 3k for them. they're common enough from project paradise. If more people did PP it would be worth like 500 caps
---
Oh this is why I die then when I shoot wendigos close at ACP. I have fireproof but not dense armor on. Thought that T-65 was supposed to be strong enough.
---
level 333, busy finishing a deck refinish today but I have level 25 alt, and gear to twink us both look me up same as user name here EDT 4pm to 9pm i'm usually on in there for a few hours
---
Yes man. Its a must on public.   Some little shit always comes and try‚Äôs to activate it when they spawn in.

Oh shit your right still needs a century
---
Okay just send me an inv when you‚Äôre in :)
---
Thanks mate üëç
---
I put them up for 1000 and they always sell quickly but i see them in vendors for up to 4000 so might be worth more.
---
Not necessarily. I have a J25 and a B 50limb lmg that both work on laggy servers. The ultracite gatling laser and the miniguns need a fire rate over 200 to work. I would recommend watching AngryTurtle's video. Just be responsible with magic weapons if you use them at public events. Don't melt the Colossus or the Queen as soon as the show up.
---
You literally have no idea what I do for a living don‚Äôt assume:) 
---
Please tell us then as a dev why this engine is the best one for them to use going forward
---
Same with red dead a fuckload only started playing it because of game pass and did the same shit
---
Challenges not completing are a common bug.
---
Hmm. Thank you (and the other guy) for explaining.
---
Though everyone does know that the strength boost to melee damage and int is being affected by the multiplier changes, right?
---
It wont let me invite you. you could try inviting me
---
Thank you so much man!
---
So I have that to look forward to. Yay!
---
Bethesda would be blowing their lore load too quickly. Where do you go after your two tent pole factions?
---
I'd much prefer a DLC centered around a smaller faction or even a new one. My pick would be rebuilding the Order of Mysteries or the return of Abbie Singh (she's not dead, there is no corpse) and the rebirth of the Free States.
---
Do the Enclave eventually, sure. Just not straight after the Brotherhood one.
---
Running westek constantly nets pretty good caps and legendary chances. Mutants=some caps, legendary mutant+RNG=large amount of caps to the right player
---
you're very welcome bud! have fun!
---
I came back at Wastelanders and got to do my first meat week and fasnacht this summer, I did come back for the Xmas present event too.  If you want to level fast any high int , bloodies build for 35 intelligence from unyielding is your friend.  Just enjoy the game, I enjoy one shotting super mutants with a bloody rolling pin, but that's just me.  However, you enjoy the game do that.  If the game isn't fun there are so many good RPG/survival titles out there to dive into.  I went from level 100ish to 333 today since Wastelanders dropped.
---
collect everything. scrap weapons and armour. sell junk in your vendor. Players love junk. visit other camp vendors and see what people sell things for so you're not rip\[ping yourself or others off.
---
I said kinda. More free than the other ones
---
Cool. I'll check if I have the plan. I think I do. I got it about a week ago. It was in my vending machine. If it's still there you can have it. I can mod your axe too if you want.
---
GT Marble Cat.
---
I have seen this happening today on Xbox... I felt sorry for the player doing all the work for us and missing out the event. It was strange anyways,  I died and did not get any rewards at all.
---
That makes sense. Maybe we could grind Settler or Raider rep by killing cultists.
---
Well, I can't speak for everyone but I do know, yeah.
---
I don't know how Int comes into this but the damage boost thing is known and frankly needed. Combat is so broken atm, they need to start somewhere and Bethesda are doing just that.
---
Though I think melee still needs more balancing as they seem to be one of the harder hit ones but it seems like about the damage changes themselves and more of an issue specific to melee/unarmed weapons. It was the same with energy weapons until Bethesda did an update to fix that issue on the PTS.
---
Use your vending machines. I sell non perishable food and drink, ammo, plans, legendaries, stimpaks &amp; junk.  I usually make 10 to 15k caps a day.
---
I saw one "Jackwagon" put his Formula P recipe for $10K! Nope... not today!!! üôÑ
---
Yeah, but he just won F76.
---
If i can no more sell stuff to train station vendors, i will always drop my Stimpaks, Radaways or Water to any low lvl players, if i can't find a real new players after a couple of fast-travels. Same goes with my legendaries, especially if my stash is full.
---
What i'm looking for tho is if the player is wearing a fasnacht mask or something making him/her look like a troll.
---
I'm sorry but i can't really help these low lvl characters, it really looks like they are working on a workshop pvp alt or a griefer alt.
---
What location was this picture taken in?
---
&gt;You literally have no idea what I do for a living don‚Äôt assume
---
I'm pretty sure you're the guy that constantly tells people he's a developer on guild wars 2 when in reality you just get the coffee.
---
Theres a perk for that, immune to all floor based traps, in agility, forget the name.
---
I believe it happens to basically all fast firing weapons, and is exacerbated by latency.  It happens to my gatling laser/plasma yes.  And it's most irritating on those due to core ammo mechanics.
---
However it also happens on my 50 cal, my lmg, rarely my cryolator, and sometimes my flamer.  You'll find that if you cancel the reload (bash sprint etc)  that gun will start firing again no problems.  The ammo is still there, but the game lost track of how many rounds were left for some reason.
---
No, there isn't, I've seen a 1400 something
---
i can help you my gt is shortpizzagod
---
Thanks bud i will add you now :)
---
it actually has to do with the amount of projectiles hitting the target i‚Äôve found.
---
single weapon projectile needs a fire rate of 200 to trigger the bug.
---
2 projectiles (including the TS legendary effect) need about 100 fire rate and so on.
---
+50% limb damage also works aswell fyi
---
EDIT: you also don‚Äôt need vats to trigger this technically (except for shotguns and the harpoon) so just mag dump away and say goodbye to anything in front of you
---
Ok...you lost me there let‚Äôs stay on subject though. Can you answer my question dev
---
Empty vendors daily by selling weapons and meat to them. Do events/quests when you can - they usually reward more caps than the fast travel cost. Super Mutants are great enemies to loot caps from - even low level ones drop around 3-5 caps each on average.
---
Update: Still a bug - I'm on Xbox
---
I only brought up int since it was also affected.
---
And definitely, the combat changes need to have happened. Retribution and hack/slash are also extremely good examples of what the legendary perks should be, since they add to the gameplay of melee and makes two relatively unused options (vats and blocking) actually useful for them.
---
I‚Äôm hoping for a Responders/Free States/Fire Breathers/Cult of Mothman updates. Honestly they all have cool lore that could bring them forward. Fire breathers could return to take care of an especially fiery kind of threat. Responders could return to help take care of the growing Mothman Cultist threat, with a sick boss Mothman fight. They are sitting on a lot of untapped lore already, so I would think something like this is likely to happen soonish?
---
Thank you so much!
---
I play on Xbox but I gifted a PC copy to a friend when it was on sale on Steam. Crossplay would mean that I actually have somebody to play with üòÖ
---
Yep. On Xbox it's X (sell) B (back). I reckon it probably halves the time it takes to sell.
---
I'd still like a more intuitive and speedy process, and for the convertor to display my current stocks of ammo, but until we get that, this tip is helpful.
---
Don't know if this is sarcasm or real. 
---
I started playing on PC after getting to 120 on Xbox. I've never been a dick to anyone. I give friendly emotes any time I get help. I was given around 30 plans one day and felt bad taking them cuz I had nothing to give back. I hate any level of asshole.
---
Sounds like you're playing on Xbox.
---
Ran into a lvl 3100 something last week
---
These Challenges have been broken for a long, long time... soooo.... probably not going to be fixed anytime during this century!
---
This would be a nice change... But I'm not sure the road there would be pleasant, knowing Bethesda. At first noone would be able to start the event. Then only the buyer would be able, but no IS would spawn. And finally after that gets fixed 3 IS would spawn... 
---
Man, I really hate this line of thinking where I'd rather settle with current faulty behavior than have them fixing it (and failing somewhere along the way)... But too many times we've seen the same scenario over and over again.
---
I‚Äôd love to see it!
---
You're genuinely delusional if you think people are jealous that you're a high level in a videogame
---
I see your point and I like your idea of rebuilding some of the older factions I especially like the free states but you have the enclave there why not use them it‚Äôs almost like a chekhov's gun. Also with the Lore you don‚Äôt need a full blown war but could have skirmishes that could help lead up to this war and still even though the enclave in Washington D.C was destroyed also same with the oil rig doesn‚Äôt mean they have large resources and manpower somewhere near like New York or Chicago which I know isn‚Äôt near Virginia, personally I would like to see the enclave put some effort into Reclaiming the land even if they do loose and i also know that yes In the lore most of the enclave have been Destroyed by the end of fallout 4 but that doesn‚Äôt mean there Entirely gone
---
Wow thank you, I did not know that I will have to play more NW then
---
Are you on PC?
---
I read a thing once that said low skilled players are bigger dicks compared to high skilled players, particularly toward female players. The article was basically saying that players who are confident in their skills dont need to feel threatened or be dicks to anyone.
---
I just got 2 badges from Stings N Things last week.
---
Is it though? I've yet to see any info on it affecting Int.
---
Do you have a source for that?
---
Last time I was in an event that actually completed was me and another player, I collected 37 ore, the other guy was defending the scavs. When I saw we had one scav left, I stopped collecting and went back to the main chamber. I still managed to get xp and walk out of there with a few legendaries.
---
-*shrugs*- Some people suck.
---
Depends on the event.  For example SBQ has the least chance of having it slow down my person because the piles are spread out, whereas ACP, Radiation Rumble, Line in the Sand and Uranium Fever bring the game to a screeching halt.  With Line in the sand if you go near the piles you better not be trying to fix the generator because you will never get there and trying to loot during that event is a bad idea.  ACP is probably the second easiest to loot but chances are I'm on Earle and not the spawns, trying to loot gets you juggled between the spawns and makes it harder (just my experience.) I don't loot during Uranium Fever or RR because I don't want to become overencumbered.  With RR I spend most of the time running to get ore then slow walking through the areas with piles to decontaminate.
---
You can buy them all. 150 atoms per
---
I've lost count of the number of times that I killed scorched enemies that were shooting at me with various types of firearms, only to find brass knuckles or knives on them when I put them down. Like, where did his fucking gun go?
---
Personally i like to place my camp near water so I can run tons of water purifiers. Keep collecting every so often so i build caps fast. Plant razor grain, corn, carrots, and collect dirty water from said water to get boiling water to make soups. Excess gets sold to vendors. I‚Äôve got mine near camden park so I can also hit the daily‚Äôs over there, and there‚Äôs a nice power armor spawn in a farm near by.
---
So far between doing all the savage divide maps, and a little over 500 cranberry bog maps... it's not really "anything".
---
the cash cow for treasure maps are the notes. The notes seem to include mostly npc-vendor plans. So if you don't want to spend a ton of money on all the night vision scopes, recon scopes and (not all but most) vendor-only gun mods then maps seem to be the way to go.
---
Three is no max level, but at a certain point, level ups are ridiculously hard to obtain.
---
Nukashine
---
I find them all useless.
---
I think the game has reached a level where I think the graphics are really good. I remember back when playing Fallout 3 I thought that the graphics are fine, but they could use improvements. Now with 76 and the improvments over 4, I feel that the graphics are really in a good place. I don't need photorealistic graphics...
---
But there's one aspect of the current graphics that I hate. Some surfaces under some lighting reflect too much light, like a wet plastic. And it's not even rare. It happens quite often and it really breaks the immersion.
---
I‚Äôve seen 3000+, however it‚Äôs generally due to the various xp cheats that have been found in game
---
It needs a specific piece of armor or to have a fire rate over 200. Angry Turtle has a video explaining it.
---
Long leather coat
---
Why does a persons weight matter?
---
Like I said, you have nowhere to go after doing the Enclave. It's all lesser from there.
---
Even doing a proto Institute (which would probably piss off a bunch of lore nerds) is order of magnitudes less epic than an Enclave one.
---
Personally, I think even doing the Brotherhood one now is too soon but that cat's already out of the bag.
---
Would that be the same with a b bash dmg minigun
---
Some one else also posted something of the sorts and I personally agree it would be cool to see them get more flushed out but then I wonder why are they bringing in the brotherhood if one of other fractions could take there spot but then why add the settlers and raiders to then not flush them out Entirely as they could of been even better story even though wastelanders was Supposed to add NPCs
---
There was one I came across a week ago that was obvious he wanted me to stand on a bit of floor that would disappear. Jetpack kinda killed these lazy trap camps when I jetpacked straight back up and confused emoted him XD
---
It‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt bother showing up to fight the queen or even Earle (haven‚Äôt even bothered giving it a try yet). When I see those nukes pop I know I‚Äôve got a few minutes to check out the popular legendary farming locations like west tek or whitespring. I feel like I‚Äôve got a better chance at drops by doing this instead of showing up at the queen and hope to spot legendaries before they are killed(or trying to find the body of ones I‚Äôve tagged) or getting a single piece of gear from the queen. Why go for one nocturnal rolling pin when I have the chance to get 5-6 of them.
---
Correct.  There is a set of magic effects and any of them will proc the magic damage when the correct parameters are fulfilled.
---
So long as you have the atoms, you can buy you way from Rank 1 to 100.
---
I (on PC) have a pumpkin rack that I can't interact with and don't feel like moving and rebuilding my camp, so I just build around it now.
---
The cursed weapons are the tools Earle used as a miner. They have a reason to be here.
---
Just out-of interest how does the instakill bit work what are they using? From what I understand the magic bit is firing consecutively on the same part for ever increasing damage how does it kill her in 1 hit?
---
This is not correct.  There is no requirement for shotguns that have the correct effects other than the magic only works in VATS.  I ran around for 50 levels in a CSS and the magic still worked.
---
That‚Äôs actually hilarious to think someone who‚Äôs playing a game will make fun of someone playing that exact game. Kinda like that homophobe bully who turns out to be gay
---
Just get a better weapon (unless you are only level 10 yourself).
---
It is possible to get badges from campfire tales, I got one a few weeks ago.
---
It seems a simple thing to put a damage cap on boss encounters. They are, after all, meant to be group endeavors. 
---
We might even see diversity in player builds if they had damage caps on bosses.
---
Bethesda should keep its hands off the West Coast entirely in my view. It's the one mostly untarnished memory of actual Fallout a lot of us have left.
---
Why would scrapping the engine that has all the functionality they need to use a completely new engine that they'd have to drastically change to get those features back be a better idea than just updating the engine they have?
---
I heard it from someone testing on the pts. I haven‚Äôt seen anyone making a post regarding it.
---
But it makes sense since they changed how multipliers are computed.
---
Ok I agree with you, you put a better story that lead to more lore being added and I agree with the third point about the brotherhood being to soon, for me I would have the new fire breathers or the responders take the spot of the brotherhood but not make them total assholes
---
This. PlayStation absolutely loathes having to share the spotlight with Xbox. That's why there's a lot of cross platform between PC, Android, iPhone, and Xbox, with PS4 sitting in the corner crying about server security.
---
You can boost your base special past 15 with legendary perk cards?
---
There are some videos on YouTube with cap stash runs with the right perks it can get you a lot of caps quickly,  I only ran it a few times but still remember where they are so always check If I‚Äôm passing by,  it‚Äôs worth running the route a few times
---
I always try to hit my caps with Aid items like meats, drugs, food/drinks, etc. And unscrappable weapons like grenades.
---
My last resort is selling weapons since I can scrap those and at least get some mats from them.
---
Hitting up areas with lots of super mutants is always good, places like Grafton Steel and West-Tek primarily.
---
My favorite is probably Uranium Fever. Mole-miners drop lots of weapons and tons of glowing meat which you can cook for XP and then sell the steaks for quite a bit of caps.
---
Yes. But you won‚Äôt gain extra slots past 15.
---
Thanks, thought so!
---
Fortnite has full criss platform, and I gotta say it's always painfully obvious when I run into a PC player. Reaction times are ridiculously different.
---
This. Let me put emergency Protocols on without a care
---
Yep... this sort of 5th ring of Hell a.k.a. severe frame drop happens at the Line in the Sand event too. The common denominator seems to be meat piles and if they start to pile up, then expect the pixilated Hell to ensue. They need to fix this pronto!
---
I just cleared out the disease challenge (successfully) yesterday.  When I got Sludge Lung, it didn't register.  So I server hopped, to reset the "get a disease" timer, and when I logged back in, that triggered the challenge update and Sludge Lung registered; I assume there was a check tied to logging in and checking active effects or something.  So if it's not triggering for you, try getting the disease, popping to main menu, and joining a new server.  I definitely didn't need a second disease to get it to register.
---
Worked for me the first time, at least.  I server hopped originally thinking it had bugged and that I'd need to clear it and catch it again, but it was ticked  off when I got back into a server.  Something to try, anyway.
---
Well, if they moved the BoS content towards scouting party direction, I don't think it'll make the lore nerds rage too much.
---
Then again, the radio transmigration indicate that they may have gone rouge, so who knows how it'll go.
---
BoS will probably start with you becoming an initiate and providing intel/assistance to them or something, kind of like how FO4 was with Danse.
---
Indeed, the ones who does know are mostly not noobs either and start it right away!
---
There's a Very Specific way of catching it. Mirelurk Hatchings in a stream west of Foundation* are the only carriers. Kill the fully grown mirelurk and let the little ones swarm you. 
---
*Look for a dimple shape in the train tracks.
---
I think formula p is underrated as a junkies addiction. People will certainly want it, but probably don't run Arktos enough to make the most of it.  There should be more awareness of this.
---
Nope! Those don't bring money in so they don't care.
---
I would like to see a society of intelligent super mutants as the new good faction to offset the arrival of the evil brotherhood faction.
---
I think those come with age.
---
(You catch it from diseased Honey Beasts.)
---
Well, there was that one bug... or feature. Whatever it was.
---
I bought mine for 50 caps becuaee I was told it could sell, I also bought the Tato Salad Recipe for 150 caps the other day and sold it for 10k
---
she could certainly take on any player as she keeps all the best weapons for herself
---
I don't have a crew. People I occasionally play with, yes. Crew, no. Level 268 or something, and have been playing since launch. Kind of a filthy casual, but fire off nukes all the time. Not on often besides weekends, but add me if you like, ign raskol.
---
And not for red dots or glow sights, just an actual scope right?
---
That would make a lot more sense then bringing a whole new chapter
---
This goes for anyone here. If you want a spot to play I got the private world if anyone wants to be free of any jerks
---
I‚Äôm on x-box
---
I‚Äôm level 47 but the weapon is probably as good as anything I can make at a level 40, yeah it does 25 or something less damage but does +50% VATS damage, I don‚Äôt know how much other legendary snipers cost either or where to get them
---
If it has all the functionality they need then why does so many systems in their games just don‚Äôt work? Fast travel? Broke. PA? Broke. Challenges? Broke. Reloading ammo? Broke. It just works. Meanwhile ID has their doom engine absolutely dancing around this one.
---
Almost like that I can‚Äôt remember the name of in fallout new Vegas or a new master but like a good one
---
I always refer to dicks as "Illidan" players.
---
Do they stay permanently?
---
I know it would take resources and time. Fuck it. Take 5 years and just retrain your devs on the unreal engine.
---
Haha was unaware that was a thing lol
---
How many per each?
---
You'll make back some atoms, too, from the 500 sum you receive at the end of it!
---
Light footed
---
Thanks! I'll run todays challenges, one more kick at the cat, so to speak, then spend some atoms. I should still get 500 atoms for the last piece reward though, yah?
---
Think its 100, you have to collect them all though, I think its 13 in total.
---
I'm sure it's at the top of the list of things they are never gonna fix.
---
Sure it was a pump shotty? Tesla and gauss shotty shoot "lasers" kinda.
---
I think crater and foundation will be free to fast travel to soon
---
Haha perfect timing! I wondered about that so, thanks!!
---
They‚Äôre actively trolling us with these shitty weapons.
---
pretty creepy, I like it
---
That sucks, i would have perma loaned you a couple fixers
---
Laser rifles can also be modded with beam splitters.
---
This is fire bro
---
Yeah you really do not understand anything about game engines if you think idtech is better for open world games than creation...
---
Thanks for proving my point.
---
They probably thought you knew the other player and had set them up. 
---
Me and a handful of friends used to team up and go take out people at workshops. Then we'd have one guy switch to a low level alt, and we would all go into sneak mode except him. Without fail, some 200+ player would come swooping in to take it.
---
I caught sludge lung many a time.
---
Tell me about it.I ran into a level 26 griefing a level 7 in a workshop,when he killed him he spammed the sorry emote and teabaged his corpse..
---
All of these suggestions are good, but I want to add that doing your dailies after also a good source of caps, as well as scrip. The faction dailies also give treasury notes and rep. 
---
For selling from your camp vendor, bulk acid, adhesive, and lead are my best sellers; also whatever ammo I'm not using. You're gonna want a bit of everything to draw interest. So, even if you don't have any meta weapons or armor to sell, put something in there to highlight your camp.
---
Thanks for all the help! I didn't play everyday nor solely focus on the board when I did, and now I feel like I just HAVE to finish it however I can :)
---
Right on, man! Congratulations on making it that far; I started two weeks late and was also surprised by how far I made it before the deadline.
---
Pssssht... with the armor every shotty becomes magic.
---
With how relatively simple they are to farm, I'll agree with this.
---
He knows,thats what he already said.
---
I'm 30 and I play it with my son. We just keep area chat off, boom no toxicity.
---
I managed to fix this, had it happen immediately after finishing the event. Died once cause I couldnt see anything (prob got smoked by one of the mole miners), then respawned back in. Still had the bug, i ended up swapping from first to third person over and over until it fixed itself. Only thing that fixed it for some reason.
---
I didnt know you could thank you . Now I know
---
Well, it doesn't help that the rumor mill on here has some people convinced that you can have your inventory stolen, or that other people can get in your stash box, etc.
---
I know but he was using a pump action shotgun firing lasers.
---
Just do you.
---
Well given those also don't sway, no. Just scopes.
---
never had any problems with them
---
I did not say that. I‚Äôm saying their engine works so much better at everything they want it to do. I could name better open world engines but that‚Äôs not the point. Anyway you‚Äôre boring me now so seeya
---
Yes i am sure he was shoting the shotgun infront of me wish i recorded it tho
---
The one you have to find Scorchbeast DNA and put it into the machine at Vault-tec U nets 100 caps every time. You don't have to kill it as a dead one will work.
---
You‚Äôd hate me then....I am level 548.
---
But really, I just like to help.
---
Um... what? I'm trying to imagine how that happened, and everything about your statement feels inaccurate.
---
I‚Äôm 548
---
I thought it didn‚Äôt? I‚Äôve loaded into a nuke zone before, the game warned me and asked if I wanted to leave, but my camp was fine
---
Just blast them 
---
I‚Äôve played this game way too damn long (since beginning) and as a lvl 360 have encountered a lot of shit
---
For me, it‚Äôs usually the mob mentality of 2-3 lower levels (100+) that try to instigate into PvP and most of the time I‚Äôm able to get over especially when they let their guard down.
---
Yeah I agree about the arsehole thing. The whole thing with Raiders and Foundation being "grey" seemed rather forced. Wasn't a fan of it.
---
So many challenges are broken for me as well. For example kill an alien, kill SBQ, travel around area X or Z...
---
Pain in the arse isn‚Äôt it? I‚Äôm max cap, stash near full, have 5k gold and about 200 treasury notes.  Log on do a quick XP route then the 3 dailies for treasury notes and log off. Use to play for hours but can‚Äôt no more lol
---
Well, we have to figure out what the Interloper is doing.
---
I figured it was a long shot but yeah. I figured give it to someone who could use it.
---
We got regular camo too.
---
Nope I messaged the guy who took it kinda laughing that I was getting the hatemail and they openly admitted to them that he did it. They still held onto the bs instead of a simple sorry. It's fine though he offered them the workshop back. So they got it back :)
---
Then after being blamed I went in and took it for myself and calmly explained that this time it was me. Be kind people!
---
Well, no. Some people were brazen and bragged about it, but a lot of us knew the right people and did it quietly. Never been banned /shrug
---
Thanks! Gotta love good surprises, kudos to you for getting as far as you did too. At least we know now what'll take to finish the next season.
---
Whaaaaat you want more than just standard and prime receivers
---
I'm still wondering why they put them in the game...
---
If these devs manage to pull off an exciting dlc involving the Enclave...
---
üò≤üò®
---
[ But we gotta point out something here. Modus, with the Kovac-Muldoon, has an eye on the Appalachia. There's no way he can miss the Brotherhood of steel return in the area...]
---
Umm... that already exists in game. Just keep mashing the space bar...
---
We all like to help out the newbies the wasteland won‚Äôt build itself the only event I‚Äôd say don‚Äôt partake in is earl as there‚Äôs only a 8 man limit and u will die a hell of a lot but otherwise crack on everyone is out to help each other
---
But he really won F76
---
I don't think modus would care since he has a missile satalite
---
I'm concerned this had to be a PSA. Mas oof-tah.
---
Well good on you, use that power!
---
This behavior is definitely a two way street, though. My husband and I are level 34, we always play together but not consistently/regularly, and last night was the first time we'd logged in in about a month. We spent 20 minutes being followed around by a level 157 berating us over global voice chat, telling us we were rude for not saying hello when he walked up to us. I emoji'd a wave but apparently that wasn't good enough. This person was ordering us to respond by voice which we can't do because we don't play with mics hooked up. We eventually fast traveled back to my C.A.M.P. and logged out because we didn't want to spend our night being harassed by a jerk.
---
Not everyone plays with mics hooked up. Not everyone can figure out the chat functions. Some of us are just trying to play the game solo or with friends and if you act like a jerk, you're doing nothing but driving away the players who are just trying to get on with their quest or gathering.
---
Hey boomer. Your age is showing.
---
Meh after the constant hatemail and cursing for something I didn't do I felt it was only fitting that I commit the crime haha
---
Because maybe its the fact they are playing a game thats been controversial since launch. Idk
---
Gauss shotgun?
---
I say because so many people complain about them
---
"Well, if you're going to accuse me..."
---
Anxiety is a bitch, isn't it?
---
Every time I pass an unclaimed workshop I pinch it, and I've seen hackers 3 times doing it.
---
Right? Haha
---
My biggest pet peeve?  Some low level tool thinking I will just simply trade my AAE handmade or primed B2525 handmade or my Bloodied SS Meat Hook Or Bloodied FFR gamma gun.  And no, forget about my QE Harpoon or AAE Gatling Plasma too.  Those weapons are all top 10 in the game and some of them took me months and tons of caps to acquire.  
---
At this point, my only real challenge is seeking out rare shit.  So stop the nonsense.  There aren‚Äôt enough caps in the world to deal for any of those aforementioned weapons.
---
I've seen something like that. The crazy one is a minigun firing orbital strike rockets. Weirdest was plasma Gatling base with a fireworks launcher that fired exploding presents and destroyed my frame rate. If that sounds insane, yep it was.
---
I would like the laser rifle that fires confetti though
---
It's maybe just a you thing. Never happened to me.
---
Do you guys think mutation serum plans are worth 10k when they go for 18k with perk and grape mentats?
---
This is my build, for my stealth bloodied commando, i use vats mostly and do amazing.  Its mainly whatever works the best for you though.  8 in Strength- 4* strong back, 2* bandolier, 2*pack rat / 12 in Perception- 3* commando, 3* Master Commando, 3* Expert Commando, 3* concentrated fire / 1 in Endurance- 1* aquaboy / 3 in charisma- 3* tenderizer / 10 in intelligence- 5* demolition expert, 3* nerd rage, 1* first aid, 1* scrapper / 11 in Agility- 5* Adrenaline, 3* covert operative, 2* action boy, 1* escape artist / 11 in Luck- 3* bloody mess, 3* serendipity, 3* class freak, 2* starched genes.
---
I managed to run across a low lever player a while back.
---
Made him weapons compatible for his level, dropped plans, stimpacks, ammos. Brought him to events and helped him leap from level 16 to 22 i just one session.
---
Very appreciative and polite- as expected from the japanese.
---
Move your damn camp if it‚Äôs getting nuked that often, common sense lmao
---
The wife  and I love line in the sand.  
---
Except when some puts the tent up to glitch it. Takes all the fun out.
---
I'm a Monongah inhabitant. My little slice of heaven is above site bravo. My camp gets demolished while I'm offline all the time.
---
From one perspective, it's the price you pay. From the other side, if you aren't online when the nuke hits you should not get penalized.
---
What's the glitch?
---
I hate to hear things like that this because I am a game pass user and I was buzzing that I could download and give it a try. It‚Äôs got me hooked and now I am more than 200 hours in. I saw this game in a bargain shop for ¬£8 the other day so at those prices I think your going to get a lot of people not playing nice aswell.
---
I wonder what RifleGaming thinks of these new player's behaviors.
---
No i know how red looks like :/
---
I use a gauss shotgun and the gun he was holding was definealty not a gauss shotgun.The gauss shotgun does not shoot red lasers.I got up close to see the gun and it was a pump action shotgun firing red lasers.
---
A) Fat Man's are weak af in this game. They can't even kill me when fully bloodied.
---
B) The jetpack are very limited, and there's no jet in this game so... unlimited flying isn't a thing either.
---
C) Stealthboys could explain the invisibility, but fat man launchers shoot in an arc. They likely fired it and then you just saw it fall on you.
---
I'm 99% sure it's a visual glitch
---
The gun he was using didn't really cause any lag fortuanetely
---
Tank killer would be useful.
---
Barbarian is for melee - do you use melee weapons at all (or as backup?)
---
we are here to help.
---
That's not the point. The point is that at this period of the time, the Enclave isn't supposed to be aware of the Brotherhood of steel existence...
---
Even funnier yet, most of these guys record and post their clips doing this. Probably just as many of them have FO1st. Let's just hope this $$$ pile they're making actually fixes the game for once in the long run. 
---
 I've had just as many boss fights where only low levels show up. Pump out a fat chunk of ammo only to fail the event. Let's all hope One Wasteland and the coming content makes a better Wasteland for us all.
---
So many jerks killing the bosses before everyone can tag them lately.
---
Its sort of the same feeling you get when you see someone on social media with a ton of followers. It's this abstract notion of power/influence/ prestige. Don't let it get to you. I'm level 500 in the game and I'm just out there lone wandering it. I don't bother anyone and do my thing. I suspect those who've lasted this long and are that level are likely to be doing the same.
---
I‚Äôve seen some people wait patiently for the event only to apparently get trolled when the event never gets launched by the person . Maybe a meet in the middle approach would be nice: only the initiator can launch the event but if time runs out the event still launches. Isn‚Äôt this basically how other events work anyway? A little prep time and then it launches after the timer counts down?
---
Well to be fair they found a way to store junk components as a currency instead of individual items. It's now one line item with a value instead of a stack if a bunch of items (when in the scrap box)
---
It was a poor attempt I know
---
Suppressed fat mans are awesome... or at least this one is.
---
Maybe they'll make it a point to destroy the communicarions satalite before the brotherhood arives
---
I laughed, but part of me thought you might've been serious.
---
Only used mine once. Now it's proudly resting in it's display.
---
As someone who had never played a multiplayer before, I totally understand. I felt that way and still do! I'm a level 208 and for whatever reason, I never seem to have just the right build or just the right weapon... And I am constantly and profoundly embarrassed anytime I attempt to join an event. I don't even bother turning on my mic, just because I'm afraid of having people yelling at me.  Keep in mind though, the majority of players here are patient and good-hearted... So enjoy the game and along the way you might make a friend or two!
---
Destiny 2 is a huge offender for power grind, and that the top levels are a slow pain in the ass.
---
I have the plan. Let me know when you are next on.
---
Do you follow my posts to downvote them üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Honestly though!!
---
Fallout 76 base https://imgur.com/a/yGRfa1b im not home at the moment so I cant get a newer picture but the only thing that changed really was I added some concrete barricades around the artillery piece.
---
The Fancy Pump Action is my favorite weapon atm.
---
This month no?
---
We do get something every month. They just don't show it in a way that it stands out. This month is the clean armor workbench. Last month was the rug and slutty bed.
---
Not an event but a good day in the burrows have yielded tons of Legendaries. Back when burrows opened you could nuke it and get around ten per run. I'm happy now running it not nuked and getting around 5 or so.
---
I‚Äôve only noticed it after dying. But it‚Äôs not consistent.
---
Yeah if anything on the new Xbox console it might bring PC and Xbox crossplay but I‚Äôm highly skeptical Bethesda will get it working.
---
"Other than the atoms and the bottomless scrap box (which Bethesda said wasn't possible before Fallout 1st was a thing) and the tent"
---
Snootiness aside they promise a lot and deliver little, you should know this by now.
---
I got a 1* nocturnal fire axe, fight me
---
Ooh that looks so good!! Are those fences more protective than walls?
---
My instigating and 250dr dragon just sits on the wall as a reminder of different times, times where I relied on it to take down scorchbeasts before Wild Appalachia Update üòÇ 
---
Dragons are still in the game just seem to be a rare drop? My friend recently got one and is using it.
---
As have I. What likely happened was a nuke landed whilst they were still loading in.
---
Can you ELIN-A-P (Explain Like I'm Not-A-Programmer)?
---
If you stay out of workshops, have pacifist enabled and don't lockpick any camp items then you are perfectly safe
---
There‚Äôs was a rug and a love heart themed bed last month, and a re-skin if the armour bench this month, and the big wandered(?) outfit a few months back, the rest I‚Äôm not so sure about
---
That's what "block" is for :)
---
I've never had one break yet and they were easier to work then the walls so I decided to use them instead
---
I'm still waiting for a red rocket collectron
---
Honestly if people kill stealing is so big a issue for people they should just stop playing until Bethesda addresses it or get fallout first and not have to deal with it. I stopped caring if other people got a tag in I just go in a do my thing.
---
If you are not online when the nuke hits then you are not penalised. When you are offline your camp is no longer in the game world and cannot be destroyed
---
But those werent in the fallout 1st category everyone got those items including people that dont have the member ship
---
They said cross platform is possible but it would require a lot of work.
---
That‚Äôs Bethesda speak for ‚Äúnot any time soon.‚Äù
---
Good Lord, has it been two years already?
---
I like being able to get higher stats and more perk cards on the ones I'm not maxed out.    
---
STR, END, and INT are my lowest.
---
Mkay.
---
They know how much junk we have.  Why are you acting like Bethesda doesn‚Äôt have the data on everything inside their game?  They know how many active players they have and can access the information.  Clearly they MISCALCULATED.  There was no guessing here.  You‚Äôre being naive.
---
They should delay the next pass until they can fix this
---
THANK YOU
---
I got the ammomachine and went playing other games. If season 2 has the similiar system to get levels I am not interested to complete it. Waiting for One Appalachia thou.
---
Here is my list
---
MG42,50. cal,machete,gauss shotgun,10mm,double barrel shotgun
---
I couldn't think of anymore weapons.btw i think the double barrel and gauss shotgun should get a suppresor.
---
If you set a tent up in the right spot, all the scorch fall from the sky directly over top the sonic generator area. 
---
Every wave just falls in the same spot and you stand there and just blast them. Takes all the fun out of the event.
---
The outfit is in the fallout 1st category in the atomic shop but the rug and bed were in the normal store so I think everyone had gotten it for free
---
Yea true
---
No matter what, what i'm trying to say is that soon or later the devs will have to so something about the Enclave in the Appalachia. They will have to add some lore so we can understand why the Enclave never went at war with the Brotherhood of steel sooner than expected.
---
I wish they would just make a version of each NW paint for the T-65. Those are some of the best paints in the game if you ask me. I don't want camo, I want to be bright orange with rebar spikes.
---
"Less toxic than GTA" is a low bar
---
If I'm wrong on this please fact check me I just feel that we weren't getting what we were promised is all
---
True
---
Yes.    
---
However, last night a level 2 came to my camp. I had all my plans and mods at 1 or 5 caps. They didn't get a lot and tried to drop some consumables but they took off.
---
Yeah I know unlimited flying isn't a thing. he was walking in midair with the chameleon effect lol
---
Add the dot sight from handmade onto pipe weapons. I would us them more often.
---
/u/Sbiffo it just works right
---
Congrats, you've just witnessed a person who locks himself inside his house, has no job and literally lives in a virtual reality. He probably gets some help from society and family members to have his internet paid  cause else his life would end.
---
A pattern of past behavior doesn't mean that behavior is correct.  Why argue for why Bethesda shouldn't be expected to do their job?
---
You are wrong but I don't have the energy to argue with you.
---
I wish they'd make the BOS paint available. It is combat armor after all.
---
it‚Äôs very dark, I‚Äôll have to take another one when it‚Äôs sunny out! I wish I had time right now :)[Whitespring Inn tour ](https://youtu.be/A04CqU_0esU)
---
Nah, they're mostly fine and harmless. Just because you came across two asshats once doesn't mean they're all bad, or that even a good number of them are. Stupid generalisation.
---
What tier are u at?
---
Youngins
---
That sucks.  I wish people weren‚Äôt like that.  I‚Äôm on PS4 so I don‚Äôt have the Gamepass issue, but I‚Äôm low level (28) but am decidedly not dickish because that was my sole hesitation with the game, that people would inconsiderate, shot me for fun, etc.  my experience on PS4 has so far been very nice.  A level 270 player was right outside of Duchesses place when I was level 2, and they gave me a tour of their base, and then dropped me 1000 caps and 1000 .38 ammo and a wet suit for dealing with water better without any prompting.  Super generous. I waved and and was on my way.  
---
And to pay it forward, I have my base placed out in the ash heap and I leave my purified water open to the public because there‚Äôs nowhere to get water out there and food is scarce too.
---
I came to the game in phases.  I‚Äôve never had PS+ before because I usually don‚Äôt enjoy online multiplayer but Fallout is my favorite franchise.  I got the game for $5 on a GameStop sale.  Then waited for the Sony Days it Play sale and got PS+ for $35.  Figured I‚Äôd give it a shot and I‚Äôm loving it so far.
---
About 90
---
I feel you man when I jumped back in when wastelanders dropped.  I was still in my teens I just tried to stay out of veterans ways.  Then some level like 800 dude showed up at my camp one day saw i was building aksed to join a team. Built me a fusion genny  and the dropped off a crap load of plans a scrip fodder legendary rolls.  I understand it was a mutual favor now cause his stash was probably full.   But yeah stick around your camp most vets are gonna pay it forward since some one more than likely helped up way back as well
---
I scrapped mine because I think they look stupid. Why does everyone want them?
---
If you are level 47 you will be underperforming with a level 10 weapon. It‚Äôs that simple. You are 3 levels away from getting access to max gear.
---
Nope.
---
They just haven't been putting the 1st exclusives on the 1st tab.
---
Haha your trying to hook up with a sexy sounding Spanish lady.... I understand your pain!
---
So I should just make a level 40 sniper instead?
---
I thought that the settlers and raiders would be a lot more interesting like there rivals trying to turn this part of the state into there territory and becoming known amongst others bigger factions
---
 My camp gets nuked offline frequently. When the camp loads in it takes damage from previous nukes.
---
 I don't know why. I just cop damage from nukes that were launched when I wasn't even there.
---
That to
---
Ah I got you- hopefully the rewards become more regular but it‚Äôs hard to tell with this game haha
---
Personally I love seeing low levels at events and trying to make it through the wasteland, like hell yea get those level ups get those legendary weapons, do what you think is fun in this game dont worry about anyone's opinion of you, and if anything I'll just drop you more water stims and radaway than you can carry and a lot of others will too.
---
I will double check.  Could be but I see a jump in damage when I reset them
---
It‚Äôs a bug that they haven‚Äôt fixed yet for some reason
---
It‚Äôs not a bug it‚Äôs a feature
---
Dude I‚Äôm running 4 different characters, one of which is brand new. The rest are 150, 250, and 375. I know my builds are solid, and I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôve perfected how I build my characters (with research and trial and error), but even with the highest level one I sometimes still feel out of my depth because there‚Äôs always gonna be someone a higher level than you. On the other side of that same coin, that person who is a higher level probably thinks the same thing. And another totally different coin, everyone stops leveling at level 50 technically. Two of my characters were completely done obtaining all the necessary perks for their builds between 55 and 70. Someone who is 70 can do all the same things as someone who is 1,000 as long as they chose the right perks during their leveling path.
---
He does use the nuclear winter laser which could be considered a hacked weapon but that wouldn't kill earl very quick.
---
This can all be avoided by just waving and carrying on with your day. I wouldn‚Äôt personally invest so much energy into worrying about whether or not new folks are playing the game to your liking. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get downvoted to hell for this but the post reads as one of the most pretentious things I‚Äôve read in a long time. To be clear, it 100% is a free for all. I could be wrong but that IS the entire point of open world right?
---
rip
---
you can buy 10 tiers for 1500 and get 500 back
---
Now this is what I call a constructive post... you know what this looks like right? You making a post about ‚Äúcrying‚Äù instead of calling out the person themselves?
---
Most of them (including me) just give away free stuff like Stims, armors, weapons, ect for low level. It's a gift for you and a good weight reduction for us.
---
For sure there will be sometimes an as**ole (welcome to the 21 century) but tbh I play since the beta and encountered a month ago the first as**ole. He was around lvl240 and I'm 280. He starts yelling at me via mic with really hard insults sends party invites ect. No clue what was wrong with this kiddo but I just blocked him instand at Psn and switched the server. Trouble solved lol
---
I will check that out.  I didn‚Äôt notice any direct relation to dying but that could be it.
---
You can buy tiers? How? Forgive me I'm a noob
---
Another one who missed the point: 
---
It is not pretentious to try and give advice to new players who may be doing something that is counterproductive to thier interests. If a new player is seeking help/trades etc, just waving at them and walking away isn't helping them at all. Much better to give them some idea as to the mindset of a higher level player and show them a way to hopefully make vets more receptive to them.
---
I might leave you because i have to repair my weapon and have to run to the cave entrance to get to the workbench,but ill be back!
---
you think every bug is the result of the engine lmao
---
you just keep proving that you have no idea what you're talking about
---
IT IS LIFE
---
I prefer the wilderness exploration of this game more than any other Fallout to be honest. The game is incredibly atmospheric (to a fault admittedly, god that morning sun is brutal) and it's a joy to sneak through the forest and scavenge and avoid higher level mobs and players. This game feels like what 4 should have been in that regard.
---
There are a lot of technical issues that aren't so great however...the game is poorly optimized and I don't get a great framerate and have constant loading/stuttering issues as well as input lag from time to time. This is mostly due to my aging system and lack of a solid-state drive however, and maybe being unlucky enough to be joining packed servers.
---
I find the CAMP system easy to use and building a house was easier than I expected. The crafting system is decent, and I like that you can repair with both materials or kits. I would like things to be a little more scarce, however, as I have a stash full of enough curatives and ammo to get me through the next 5 levels even if I stopped looting entirely.
---
I've only played a whopping 15.3 hours so I can't be any more in-depth than that, but I can say I don't feel like my 40 bucks was wasted.
---
Haven't been lucky enough to get one yet
---
You would think they would keep their in game store a little more organized
---
Yeah that would be cool too. I got the Elder paint for the T-60, I would love to be able to use that on T-65.
---
The only douche I see is you. Not everyone uses guns, some people are melee builds and archers. Stop being greedy and let others get a tag, if you just wanna hog everything for yourself then go to a private server. Events are supposed to be a GROUP activity.
---
I‚Äôve never played another game that did this. Not even the other fallouts lol
---
Mostly when against ghouls it happens to me lol
---
...That still doesn't mean it was the result of the engine? are you dense? The engine has nothing to do with something like keeping ammo count. 
---
Unreal engine games of course have 0 bugs.
---
Hey I got it cleared up they just dont put the fallout 1st rewards under the fallout 1st tap I'm the store

Project paradise always pays out 5+ for me. Yesterday I did one solo i had the sentry bot in C room was 3, then in the room behind him was a couple of ghouls both legendary mabye a 3 and a 2, then I was in room A, had a 3 rad stag and there was 2 crickets that where legendary 2s then cherry on top was the sheep. Dont know why more people don't join me in project paradise. But I always run around kill all robots and mobs befor event to always find some legendarys
---
My alt's vendors!! üòÖ Seriously though, taking workshops gets you tons of plans plus some events award special plans. I don't have a comprehensive list on that though.
---
Don‚Äôt worry you get to shoot the whole clip but when you fire auto it‚Äôll count all the way to zero then shoot back up to the number you see. What‚Äôs really fun though is when this glitch happens with the syringer, because you‚Äôll shoot and still have a fully loaded weapon, you really have to convince the game by reloading or shoot ingagain.
---
Ah I see that makes sense!
---
Challenges to discover locations which reward atoms are still broken, i got them all discovered but never got my atoms
---
You sure your not just trying to find another pool party haha.....you lot were all kinds of random last night.
---
Some Level 20 noob started to shoot me when i said that im not gonna help him, extremely annoying
---
There could be a DLC based on the Mothman cultists and another on the interlopers and time travel/ interdimensional shenanigans.
---
Sometimes I really wish I would play on PC lol
---
Wow, its pretty well lit all things considered, amazing build bro
---
You can buy them with atoms- 150 atoms per level, and get 500 back as the reward for hitting rank 100
---
Lol yea I guess but i really hate to see a game that is good in concept get destroyed by them
---
On the game board you should see an option called rank up I think. It cost 150 each time.
---
I've only watched turtles video to know which to look out for as it seems they sell for more just because they're magic atm.. Don't really indulge too much in cheating/glitching in general üòÅ it ruins my fun I feel but if others enjoy it, have at it while it lasts
---
I help low levels all the time (Lv77) and I help them by sniping at enemies attacking them. Just stalking them to see what new ppl do
---
Pipe is life
---
im hoping so, I just need more to do in this game
---
Go into the legendary run screen and theres an option somewhere, it'll tell you which button to press
---
Thanks :) I‚Äôm proud, I know it‚Äôs not this illustrious complicated build but I love the aesthetic of post apocalyptic/fancy Whitespring stuff
---
I don‚Äôt notice any changes if I die during ACP, maybe because it‚Äôs an instance. Outside of that instance though I don‚Äôt die that often, but that‚Äôs when I sometimes notice that my stats have changed. Again, this is really inconsistent and hard to replicate, which I‚Äôve tried so I could nail down this problem to figure out the exact cause. I know some people say it‚Äôs a visual bug with your stats, but that visual bug affects carry weight so I go by that instead of my stats.
---
Edit/P.S.:
---
It could also be something with nuclear winter. People that swap between NW and Adventure mode complain that the weapon wheel is broken and empty, when the fix for it is to just open and close pipboy as soon as you load into a server. And since NW removes all your buffs and mutations, that could carry back over into Adventure mode so it would need to be reset by unequipping class freak and re-equipping. Just a theory/thought. Could be wrongü§î
---
Always forget about that place. Haven‚Äôt done the Enclave quests since launch
---
&gt;Bethesda &gt;‚ÄùWhen are they gonna fix-‚Äú never
---
You know you could tag the enemy with your gun then go kill something else. Melee and bow builds are a valid choice in this game. With a melee build most guns do shit for damage so it's much easier for me to punch the enemy.
---
I do.
---
Yeah, I get my tags on bosses and usually farm adds. Only reason to use magic weapons is when it becomes a time crunch or you get into a solo fight with Earl or the SBQ.
---
Do you prefer heavy slower high damage (generally 2H) Weapons, or faster, Lighter, but lower damage (1H) weapons.  
---
PA or non-PA? (You can‚Äôt use things like deathclaw gauntlet, mole miner gauntlet, or meat hooks when you are in PA.)
---
I like light fast 1H, with a vampire serrated switchblade as a primary and SS ghoul slayers serrated switchblade as a secondary.  SS hunters combat knife for animals.
---
vampire weapons a great for restoring a bit of heath, that you will lose in hand to hand (claw? tooth?) up close and personal combat.
---
15 STR, Maxed Martial artist and incisor are a must. Glowsight3
---
Nerd rage.
---
Mutations: twisted muscles, healing factor, adrenaline, speed demon.
---
At least classfreak2 to offset the negatives.
---
 Put motion assist servos on PA torso for +2 STR
---
SS underarmor, shielded (+4 STR, +4 and +2 on two other specials, +15 DR +15 RR, +15 ER)
---
Faster AP regen on one piece of armor (helps with repeat power attacks)
---
Sometimes, you just need guns.  Tagging at events like UF, Dealing with things that fly (cargobots and SBs), or ground based stuff thats a bit too tough for you at the time you meet it.  Tank killer, one or more of the comando, ground pounder type perks.  Stabilized if you want to go heavy.
---
&gt; Events are supposed to be a GROUP activity
---
Right, and that means we have to wait eons for an archer to shoot, or the boxer to sprint to all the mobs?
---
The shoe is on both feet, we don't one-shot everything, and the others go and get a tagging gun. win:win.
---
Bethesda:* squashes 5 bugs *
---
Fallout 76 : * makes 10 new bugs *
---
Bethesda:  ***;-;***     ahhh yes more work
---
I only level 30 and I'm already being irritated by low levels asking for stuff I haven't even got yet but all the high level players I've come across are all nice and have  helped me alot might have something to do with being kind in return
---
I accidentally kill enemies way too quickly even if I use my worst melee weapon. Honestly the only way I can tag everything without killing it is by punching it with my bare fiste.
---
Exactly
---
I finally got to level 28 and opted to try the Charleston DMV (recommended level 30).  Print my number, loud speaker starts going.  Two Level 70 massive hulking ghouls bum-rush me and I‚Äôm I dead in one hit.  I got one shotgun blast off (89 damage) and his HP bar barely moved.  
---
Ok, guess I‚Äôll go back in 50 levels.
---
There's a random encounter that has a pipe sticking out of the ground. Go find the pipe. It is life.
---
where do you get the flower
---
Brilliant
---
Thank goodness for pay to win, I'm sitting pretty at level 95 and if bethesda fixes it before tomorrow I'll save some atoms. 
---
Thanks for the help guys
---
Im selling one in my vending machine.
---
If you want to walk around with a stick poking enemies do so on YOUR private server. I'm not going to fail an event waiting for you to hit everything. You're correct its a GROUP activity and the purpose for the group is to complete the event. If I can carry a low level weapon so I don't one shot everything, then you should carry a weapon to get your tags.
---
That pool is super elegant looking! And your Ally in the bathrobe is genius! Thanks for sharing the vid :D
---
iTs A fEaTuRe
---
I only get annoyed if it‚Äôs a 3 star. Otherwise I don‚Äôt care.
---
Just pay for a hacked one /s
---
I wish they'd fix this before the new season but that's probably too much to hope for.
---
Got mine on third ticket. I want the revolver for my gunslinger.
---
So what could possibly be the cause if it‚Äôs not the engine lol? The server? Maybe
---
Thank you!! Yeah she‚Äôs just on vacation 24/7, although the Eye of RA is officially a boob charm instead of a necklace or whatever it is üòÇ
---
Weapon effects would be cool, for future seasons maybe, or even lunchbox boosts.
---
Commando and heavy gun cards are not stacking like the use to so yes it is affecting specific perks.
---
 and is related douche noodle.
---
What fast travel glitch?
---
And where is the balance? Bloodied still has top damage while being one of the tankiest builds, my full health pistol build is equally fucked by the new damage calculation while having none of the benefits. This is no balance patch, it's just the groundwork for future balance patches (if they ever come).
---
Yeah, my build is the same lol I've had about 7 builds in the same place lol this is my current (it's been updated slightly since, I got the floor decor with the Colossus heads and the secret fireplace door) 
---
https://youtu.be/wvm1LT162L4
---
And what about killing those aliens? They aren't even in the game
---
I wasn't able to even tag a few queens lately.
---
I loaded in the other day with my camp in a nuke zone and it had no damage.
---
I just love the scorched  they out preform vats by doing a 360 no scope critical shot across a building roof with shot gun while looking at the dore
---
I get what your saying, but with the "Brotherhood of steel " approaching that gives us another faction to befriend. I would chose to be cool with the Brotherhood any day over the mothman cultist.
---
Yeah, thing hangs in an odd space lol. I'll stick to my RadRoach Wedding Ring!
---
Actually that would  / could be a cool plot twist
---
I‚Äôm talking about tagging legendary enemies, I‚Äôm a heavy gunner I can easily one shot everything in events but I don‚Äôt cause it‚Äôs not right to one shot the legendary cause you don‚Äôt feel like waiting for others to get a tag in. I‚Äôll wait as long as possible for everyone in the event to tag the legendary, not everyone should carry a weapon for tagging cause people like you feel entitled to all the XP
---
I mean, it would be interesting for a month or so before the next dupe comes and everybody has cursed bloodied fixers
---
Remember it ends at Noon est! So log in early!
---
I would do that all day üòÜ
---
The only times I actively help new players is when they are looking for it in the LFG tab of the 76 Club on Xbox. That is the only time I will help randoms because it means they might play the game more often and not just delete it and end up wasting my time.
---
I feel like posts like these are fake. I am level 140 and it's very, very rare to find someone using their mic, and add being a dick out of nowhere to that. I don't know, but why? Is the location of the server relevant? Because I am not in the US, but on the south
---
I have some very highly powerful weapons, but I only use them in events where I know that everyone can get a hit in before I can gun the legendary down afterwards. With great power comes great responsibility.
---
Events like Uranium Fever, I always bash the legendary enemy and then wait for the others. I know I have my hit in, I know I will get a drop. Theres no need for me to be an arse and kill it before anyone else gets there.
---
Events like Project paradise/ free range depending on the number of players there I hit the boss one or two times, or until it starts regenerating. I also do this in riding shotgun, where the blood eagle captain is a guaranteed legendary spawn.
---
Events like Radiation rumble, or events that have ridiculously high numbers of ads I take them out, because there is bound to be a few more later in the event.
---
I try to be courteous about legendary enemies during events and think everyone should do the same
---
Death claw Island just go there lol
---
We're here to help. And also from what you describe, you're not one of *those* annoying, needy noobs. Slap damage was removed forever ago so I promise that unless you shoot me and don't have pacifist on, I won't kill ya. Happy to help.
---
I didn't need to call anyone out by name, they provided them themselves in the comments.
---
I think you need plans to unlock it, there only two paint urban and woodland check fallout.wikia.com
---
A true hero in the community - donating time and effort to create content for other players.
---
That is beyond stupid, i rely alot on stealth multiplier.
---
I just maxed Adrenaline now so im prepared.
---
Please no the game it to buggy and laggy  for that type of work
---
This
---
Same that's why when he died the first time I just let it go and said I'd wait for the pet update whenever that comes, but I guess I got lucky for now. I'd be pretty upset to lose a sloth I really wanted that first.
---
Nice haven't gotten that either üòú rngesus don't like me lol
---
A bit more plausible solution is that the player in question probably got in late, got no hits, and maybe just angry they did not get the outcome they were hoping for.
---
tl;dr Show up when the event starts.
---
That is shit like hahahahaha
---
I've seen a level 2200+.
---
I realized that i have no friends that would play the game then i realized i have no friends
---
I love it!! Your camp is so happy and interesting. Love the vault boys at the bar. Cool space :) wish I had the Nuka kegs!
---
Wait till the brotherhood shows up üòÜ
---
Because you didnt buy the bundle.
---
I'm on gmt so for me it ends 5pm, plenty of time
---
I need to find one of those for her üòÇ
---
Because Mr Howard needs more money
---
yeah people who have only played GTA or rust coming here and being surprised are funny. like no shit Sherlock, this game isnt going to be as toxic as the most toxic games out there. but 76's community isnt as abnormal as people on this sub think, and it absolutely has its share of shitheads
---
I want a cultist dlc at some point
---
That would be cool
---
Have you seen the videos of people‚Äôs home built .22 cal machine guns, super high rate of fire and zero recoil. It would be the same sort of deal imagine having a super high rate of fire and zero recoil on the mg42, less damage but you‚Äôd miss the target less. And it would be the opposite for chambering in .50 cal the weapon may deal more damage but the recoil would be even less manageable.
---
It can, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a guarantee - I got an M79 when I fought it last night
---
&gt;So what could possibly be the cause if it‚Äôs not the engine lol?
---
I don't understand, the way you worded this sounded like sarcasm as if you think the engine truly is the cause of all bugs in a game...
---
That's just not true at all. 
---
&gt;The server? Maybe
---
Yes. Probably. Or a simple UI bug where fast firing weapons' ammo counters dont update fast enough
---
No....either a cursed weapon, helmet or a plan, but I think the weapon has a better chance of dropping
---

Like the previous comment workshops are a great way to build up various camp plans. Also be sure to check tool boxes especially if you are able to lock pick them as the locked boxes tend to cough them up now and then.
---
Alright Thanks man
---
Yeah I was confused too, but there‚Äôs another one. You can tell the difference easily because the hat is white. If you scroll down on this link it shows better pictures of the outfit + hat

---
No-I‚Äôm saying if it makes you that upset message them on XB. Generalized ‚Äústop crying‚Äù posts serve little purpose.
---
I was the first one there actually. We‚Äôre not taking the queen here. We all have to wait for the rubble to clear. And we were all ready at the same time. 
---
I‚Äôm really not getting what you‚Äôre trying to say here..?
---
I blame Gun-Fu.
---
Almost every time I have gone there during one of these challenges, there is never one there due to it being killed before getting there
---
If they are sitting too close to say a foundation or a large planted item (I'm looking at you Razorgrain) you may not be able to select them. If that is the case remove the foundation it is next to, pick up items and replace moved foundations. Same goes for plants in the way. Their bounding box/collision mesh is all fucky and really needs a rework.
---
No... thats actually my one biggest issue with the game is how shitty it looks compared to other online games. Its built on a really old engine lol
---
Oh good! Phew, then you got this!
---
I dint say anything about legendary enemies! I always wait on the legendary enemy.  I carry a low level weapon so that I don't one shot everything but I'm not going to fail the event. Everyone regardless of build or level should carry an event weapon. Me carrying one and you refusing to makes YOU the entitled one.
---
Yah
---
\- Deathclaw Island  
---
\- Thunder Mountain substation TM-02 (directly north of Watoga, just outside the city)  
---
\- Hopewell Cave  
---
\- Abandoned Waste Dump
---
If you cant find a Deathclaw on any of those locations, then someone was there shortly before you and killed it, as all 4 locations got a 100% chance of spawning one.
---
Such a dick answer you do realize he doesn‚Äôt own the company right? He has to answer to other people who in turn have to answer to share holders

Had the same thing happen to me with my Minigun.
---
FT to Camden Park, when you land IMMEDIATELY about face and you will see a small house down the road on the left....bathroom. OR FT to New Gad and up the grassy hill toward Summerville is a bench with a fedora on it. Pick up the hat...ring beneath!
---
I can't acquire all diseases I can't find a diseased Mirelurk spawn or whatever the baby queen bugs are is it broken or just rare to catch their disease lol?
---
I needed that today.  TYVM.
---
Yea i only bought first recently before that I couldn't claim the work bench or the shite rug or bed . They are first items. Its pretty obvious because they don't usually give free stuff like work benches to non paying players. 
---
There's also the fact if you don't like it , unsubscribe its not a massive deal really.
---
üòÇüòÇ Believe me there was plenty of messages on XB.
---
sound like a bunch of whiny bitches  welcome to life its not fair just cos u bitch do t mean shit will happen no cares the company sure asf dont care stop being whiny bitches and man thr fuck up and deal with it
---
Thank you!!
---
They should just do away with the activate part.  Make it automatic like the new Colossal event where a timer runs down.  Maybe 3 minutes from the time the event kicks off and tells everyone on screen.
---
Financials isn't a problem. There really wouldn't be much additional work to allow servers to connect to both platforms.
---
The politics, though..  Only a handful of studios have been able to convince Sony to allow crossplay with Xbox. Bethesda really doesn't have the leverage right not to convince Sony to allow it.
---
Always here to make people feel better. Stick around, ill be here all week.

Liberty Prime wants to gouge your wallet a little bit more.

---
You one day will become which what you fear.
---
bethshit is such a joke
---
It happens to me with the Gatling Laser and occasionally with the MG-42. It used to happen a lot with the Fixer and my assault rifle. What I have found is that when it starts to reload when you don‚Äôt want it to, quickly do a melee strike and it will stop it. This is more important for weapons that use cores so you don‚Äôt have leftover cores taking up weight, but until the bug fix comes this is the solution I use
---
Same thing happened to me today, I was logged in when the timer reset. I only had 3 that I could do for the day.
---
10 is way too long. 3 would be ok.
---
Welcome!
---
Wonderful-now leave it at that.
---
Which of the 12 fast travel glitches?
---
Thanks :D I made a Playlist of them all lol from my first ones to now 
---
The outside bar had to happen when I had the patio built and it's the first time I've built a camp as a shape rather than an actual house/workshop lol 
---
The Nuka Kegs was part of the mysterious items thing
---
You do realize that we use Todd Howard as a humourous target when something is either funny, too real, or frustrating?
---
Because now you do. Chill slightly.
---
Thank you so so much! I heard the max fps you can get in game is 60fps? Would I be able to push ot to 100ish?
---
I think that Bethesda should allow people to choose like 5 ranks before this run ends. Just so that people who have logged on only to not be able to do half of the score dailies can get the rewards they want. I think that only 5 items would keep some exclusivity since you have to pick and choose. Just something to apologize messing up players score progression and not letting them get rewards they wanted.
---
Good points
---
also it lasts 2 minutes to 6 minutes and you get a one star legendary and some unique outfits and recipes from it, as opposed to fasnacht where you have to sit around for 20m for the same but different stuff (though chance you get a 3 star from it)
---
Thanks! I had no idea.
---
my guess is people weren‚Äôt checking the 1st tab, so to make things easier they put it all under the free tab so people didn‚Äôt have to hunt for it
---
I haven't ran into this problem really. I usually get someone making a mule character and asking me for some 2-3 star legs I'm carrying and offering to return the favor. I usually see it as spammy and just ignore them. I'd rather really help out someone in need.
---
The post does serve a purpose.  Everyone should carry an event gun. No matter the level or build.
---
Got a bloodied M79 yesterday, 1\*
---
I got the same thing. I also noticed Zorbo is still on space 98 and has yet to move to space 99 even though his meter is full. Not sure if they are related
---
you don‚Äôt have to do any faction grind to get the stuff from the Secret service
---
Yea ur right but have the scrap box and the tent is kinda nice I just didnt know bc they have given free stuff before like some emotes and icons so
---
[Angry Turtle](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSEDsFOPSQp6VP8vfH_Zxcg) is one of the most imformative YouTubers out there. I used his suggestions to go bloodied and never looked back. He covers ALL KINDS OF BUILDS! So....have fun watching!
---
I think the best thing I‚Äôve experienced with a low level player (I chuckled to myself frantically whilst it happened), was one of the workshop yards had the typical defend the workshop event.
---
So I went there to help out (I‚Äôm a bloodied build, so naturally I was running about 30 HP) 
---
So I start fending off these ferocious low level ghouls swarming into this, like level 13‚Äôs workshop with a black powder rifle for the Lolz.
---
Then I start coppin bullets into the back of my head, I‚Äôm thinking ‚ÄúWtf is shooting me‚Äù, turn around to see this little fella standing in the doorway of his small makeshift hutt with 3 turrets, I stare at him for a while as he continues to shoot me. 
---
Then I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúFuck it, yolo it‚Äôs black powder rifle time‚Äù
---
I shoot him back, Pvp starts, his turrets absolutely rail me and my massive 30HP. 
---
Then it happens, the beautiful option ‚ÄúSeek revenge‚Äù
---
Oh boy you better believe it, I click that fucker, I sneak all the way back to see him hovering over my corpse looting my petty 12 screws.
---
‚ÄúHe wants to play this game hey?‚Äù 
---
I equip my Bloodied 25% FFR Plasma rifle with flamethrower attachment, I sprint straight past those turrets, he closed the door as I can only imagine his mind was going ‚ÄúOHHHHH HELLL NOOO‚Äù seeing this level 300+ player powering towards him, then IT HAPPENS.
---
The holy green fire of righteousness begins to spew out of my weapon, his door BAM instantly destroyed as I walk right upto him and melt his face completely off of his skull.
---
Then a little voice inside my head goes ‚ÄúDew it‚Äù
---
My Plasma thrower begins ejaculating everywhere, chuckles heard as he lays there dead whilst I hold push to talk, the entire workshop paid a dear price that day. 
---
He re-spawned around 2 minutes after the incident, staring towards his once proud workshop camp (it actually was an impressive little setup for a lowbie)
---
I fired one more shot from my black powder rifle towards him, then he logged out.
---
I wish I could upvote this more lol
---
You are wrong. It is easy to check by looking at the store of a subscriber vs non-subscriber. Non-subscribers did not see the bed and rug for free last month in the store. Yes, it is dumb that Bethesda does not make it obvious.
---
Luck is a hell of a thing , I collected 60 modules going to look for bloodied swing speed gauntlet and was ready to go all out, got it on number 2 rng blessed me.
---
It's not just gats it's almost all automatic weapons. It is not a visual glitch, it happens to me with my laser rifle which is a huge detriment because then over half of my clip is still there :/
---
I love it. Yeah I totally missed the nuka kegs since I switched to playing on PC only in the last few weeks! This build for me started as more of a motel, we didn‚Äôt even have beds with sheets. It looked more like a southern diner inside, but then I had enough caps to get resort plans so I splurged on the design! I just wish the antique lights gave off a little more light!
---
What if anything is bethesda doing about hacked items?
---
I guess all 12.
---
I've had a few myself where I drop the nuke and get nothing.
---
I wouldnt mind it so much but its my only smoke machine :( Rip spooky swamp haunted house entrance
---
I don't get what you are trying to say can you be a bit more specific?
---
You should be able to connect your accounts up not sure how that works though 
---
That's why I use track lights lol it's not that obvious and it really lights up the place
---
Ha that I don't know, because it's so badly optimized and I have an old system I have to play in 1680x1050 just to get 40fps. But I'd imagine if you get tricky you can do something with the ipresentinterval=0 setting to unlock the framerate in the .ini file.
---
This.  If a Yao Guai is close enough that the end of my shotgun is inside it, and I accidentally got the legendary behind it while I'm fanning the trigger in panic, my b. I'll drop the legendary if you really need it.
---
You don‚Äôt need the plans, but I believe only the Urban Mask color can be changed. The Forest One doesn‚Äôt appear to have the option.
---
24 hours after scriping out
---
Oh god, I think that is it exactly. I accidentally placed it in what I thought was a bush but was an already picked mutfruit plant :( Hopefully they can do something about it in the future!
---
Doesn't look like it.
---
Rarest outfit in the game.
---
Yeah I wouldn't know what they had before,  hoping something good for Halloween next month. And if its not good I won't subscribe because I'm hoarding stuff into my scrapbox rn to be safe.
---
Ah right thanks, spent 200 scrip on 2 ranged weapons and hit the same weaponüòÇ
---
Glad I‚Äôm not the only one there. I was thinking maybe I had to kill her solo or get the final hit which both were scary lol
---
Do you get the one where you press the firing button and nothing fucking happens!? It makes me turn the game off.
---
Do I have your permission to try this but on Xbox? (I‚Äôll have a different quest and different rewards and stuff)
---
The bundle is meant to be something you buy in order to get all those items at a discount. 
---
Some items you can purchase separately on its own. Which is what you did. Instead of buying the bundle, you just bought some of the things you wanted, to save atom points. 
---
The game isn‚Äôt going to remember or care if you already bought 3 out of the 5 things in the bundle. If you want the remaining things, then you need to buy the bundle. No discount. No nothing.
---
I remember following some low players awhile back (I‚Äôm not that high myself, just 67 or somewhere along those lines) just to see what they were doing and help out. They immediately started cursing at me claiming I‚Äôm trying to get there ‚Äúduped mask‚Äù cause apparently they were doing a quest for one? Then started threatening me with their higher leveled profiles and how they would destroy me and such. Good times
---
There is a lot more to this then I thought lol, but as of right now I just have random metal armour and wetsuit, for weapons I have the nailer and a quad capacity lever action guns do I was hoping to build it around those weapons but I‚Äôm willing to change the armour to whatever I need
---
Sweet, thank you
---
I killed it 3 times in a day and all I got was three railroad spikes
---
With an instigating lever action, you‚Äôll one shot mostly everything non-boss. 
---
I based my VATs stealth rifleman build off of https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/ladydeath/
---
I absolutely nuked a camp there yesterday on PS4, apologies if this was you
---
Sorry, I don‚Äôt have console at home.
---
Thank you very much
---
Yea and just letting u know if u unsubscribe all the stuff In the scrap box stays as long as u dont delete the scrap box from ur camp, but u just wont be able to deposit stuff into it
---
Just pulverize them lmao
---
I meant can I use your idea and create a quest for people to do on Xbox?
---
i have seen many there but yet to complete it with 2 animals alive, everyone just wants to guard that one level 3... :(
---
Act idk if that's still the case so might want to fact check that just in case
---
And it would make a hell of a lot more sense than using a harpoon gun for mining. Plus I've never seen a 90% reduced weight mole miner gauntlet in 287 levels. That thing weighs so much.
---
I locked a lvl 3 player in a 1 tile floor room cause the guy kept on hitting me and I couldn‚Äôt PvP him guy was stuck there for 45 mins
---
I could see that being a possibility since the game is essentially a port from Xbox anyway
---
I didn‚Äôt even know about this site, thank you
---
i've gotten 3 there before, but got tired of sleepy ghouls that won't come out and play so dropped it and White Springs from the places I visit daily
---
The absolut maximum is level 50k.
---
I‚Äôm the same way. I will never, EVER carry anything on me that I don‚Äôt use, especially my weapons. I wish that player to player trades included your entire stash, because then people would actually want to trade with me. I‚Äôm not going to carry heavy ass items just for the off chance that someone wants to trade.
---
I'd assume you can't claim it once it's I've r but have no proof of it
---
It's 20 hours, same as the gold and vendor reset
---
I completed the challenge 2 days ago, all I was missing was Whoopsies so I think it might just be Sludge Lung that isn‚Äôt working
---
I would vote for Rust Devils for small faction. This could be a great opportunity to introduce ally robot which we could customize.
---
I think I read that the vault raids are being reworked and coming back later on during One Wasteland For All.
---
Prime Cuts which was in circulation last month is happening again this month.
---
I think Bethesda are going to rerun all past events, welcoming new players for example I only started in July. 
---
The only thing that you can miss is the Legendary Run Board #1, but I'm sure a lot of the items will be reintroduced in the Atom Shop for those who missed the skins.
---
It's recommended you go to their main website and see the upcoming events. For example, I don't think people know that in September 10-14 there will be a Legendary Scrip sale of everything 50% off so I'm capping it to 1000 before then.
---
Yeah. I think the same thing whenever I see the mascot heads and goofy outfits.
---
No direct statement but Beth did say we should remember to Claim the rewards before the season ends.
---
I was able to find pieces for around 1k each, though they were 1 or 2 star without particularly amazing secondary effects. It gets super expensive if you want good 3 star.
---
Considering these bugs have been since the begining, i doubt they will ever care to fix them. Heck, there are even bugs for daily quests and small events and still no fix (Messenger, Breach and Clear, etc). Players have already made it clear they want fixes for all of this, but bethesda just ignores it.
---
This isn‚Äôt the only location.
---
You do realize it‚Äôs not funny anymore right? Maybe try a new joke or just be an adult and not use comments like that but you just keep being a sheep. As far as the just chill FUCK YOUüñïüèª
---
Nukacrypt are amazing and I use them most of them time. Every now and then though I enjoy the challenge of cracking the code on my own, could be that the OP is in a similar position. Good shout though on recommending the site.
---
mhmmmm ig
---
Have you tried pinning the challenge?
---
Many games have started doing this, but you‚Äôre right. We can‚Äôt expect a company that hasn‚Äôt fixed bugs that have been present since launch to know what current trends are or have the mental capacities to code something like this.
---
I'm just happy as it gives some new use to my explosive assassin's handmade.
---
I expect there is a max depending on how they declared the level variable but it is likely 32768 at a minimum and may be in the millions or billions if they were extravagant :)
---
I have not
---
With the introduction of bullion prices for regular armor have come way down. If you're willing to skip Vanguard, you can put together a creature resist set very cheaply. This isn't a solution for ACP, but it covers pretty much every other situation.
---
It's definitely bugged, even after the workaround. (Contract another disease first, then server hop and try to get Sludge Lung, i tried this 10 times before it actually worked and registered for the challenge)
---
There was so much potential there, but I'm guessing they probably don't have the people or possible game engine limitations preventing it.
---
Would have loved to have a faction versus faction this across servers.
---
Something like, outpost control events (more outposts controlled, more vendor stuff available). Two events pop up, one for raiders, one for settlers. Which ever completes first wins, and it affects all servers.
---
Also, the local BoS being an a$$ was due to desperation in the face of the scorched. The incoming crew's leader, that walked across the continent, is basically not in agreement with the west coast BoS. The most likely disagreement would be the pivot from helping survivors to preserving technology. Or could be that Rahmani is an isolationist, while Maxson was open to exterior recruitment. (similar to Taggarty). 
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Roger\_Maxson](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Roger_Maxson)
---
What would be interesting to do, is to make the incoming BoS hostile.
---
I‚Äôll do that but I‚Äôll top it with an ultimate furious pipe revolver I got, I heard that it‚Äôs realllly gooood
---
That might fix it but I‚Äôm not sure though, or maybe you have to spawn the queen with one of your own nukes
---
Let‚Äôs be real about workshop instigating though, it‚Äôs the oldest trick in the book.
---
Back when the game first released it was one of the biggest methods a lot of Australian PVP‚Äôers used. Actually met a lot of good folk who were PVE Grindy as heck through being grieved in the Ammo production warehouse.
---
They mainly look for a reaction most times and if you give them a positive one, chances are they then feel bad for playing up.
---
Which is a shame, I can relate to OP because when the Grognax the barbarian bundle came out, I only had enough atoms to buy the plushie. I really wanted everything else but I didn‚Äôt feel like spending money. Then the bundle came back but I only had enough to buy the skin for the sledgehammer. 
---
Then the bundle came back again, but I didn‚Äôt feel like spending atoms to buy the bundle, to get the chair, icon and the rug when I had already paid for the other stuff on its own.
---
Can the horde start off dancing till someone is detected?
---
You know, cause all zombies have to do the thriller dance.
---
Wait until one wasteland where the drops will scale to players level. Someone missing out on a lower level legendary is one thing, thats just script. But once its a possible viable legendary item, the drama is going to get interesting.
---
Go through all those treasure maps you stashed. If you have multuples of the same place, you can use them all at one time.
---
Like 1 out of 20 people are complete asshats in this game. These are the guys who make trap bases. Thing is, at lv 182 and with RR Ultracite armor, goat legs, fireproof, and a jet pack, none of their traps really work anymore. The last trap base I got caught in, he locked the doors on me, then 5 flamethrowers lit me up, but with all the stuff I mentioned he couldn't kill me....he still vaporized me when I unlocked his door, but the point is some people are dicks. Some people lure you into a vending machine, you'll never get to it, and then drop you 300 feet to your death, so you know what. You get a jet pack and goat legs and you keep on trucking.
---
In arktos, one of the habitats.
---
I have a confession... I have 20+ maps and haven't done one..
---
This is what I was exactly thinking, also when i said the BoS were assholes I meant that in general I mean when you throw an explosive collar on someone they might think your an asshole

Fireproof and the dense mod neutralizes all explosive damage from all non-explosive energy weapons. This includes your Gatling gun, grenades, handmades, fixers. Those weapons are not explosive energy legacies, so fireproof and dense applies to them. 
---
Fireproof and dense mod **do not** neutralize explosive energy damage. The game recognizes explosive energy damage as energy damage when shot. The fireproof and dense mod provide no protection towards energy damage, therefore it will not neutralize the damage.
---
Before they announced what the new content was gonna be I was thinking it would have been neat to bring the Enclave back, they could claim to be the Government and that they were there to deal with the Scorch once and for all and to help and protect the settlers of foundation. But in reality they showed up to take back control of the silos and to collect samples and data of the scorch and fev mutations and also to deal with the Free States traitors. The Free States being out gunned turn to the only possible allies they have left, the Raiders. So it turns into Free States and Raiders  VS  The Enclave and Settlers. It could end with The Enclave gaining dominance of Appalachia and the free states being on the run but manage to send out a desperate plea for help that is intercepted by Roger Maxson and the BOS thus bringing them back for the next big dlc.
---
I would assume not. I‚Äôd just claim them.
---
I think once you get to a certain level it‚Äôs one of the few things that keeps me personally playing on is helping lower levels with the grind, I spend at least one day a week giving all the excess stimpacks I acquire over the week to new/lower level players around the mapüëåüèª
---
That really does suck :(
---
Details and Lightning are great when they decide to render, considering how badly optimized this game is for both consoles and pc, textures and such either take too long to load to consider it pretty or just straight up don't load.
---
It stopped me from dying when i used legacies ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è so, whatever pal.
---
I appreciate the empathy, lol :)
---
And they aren't.  MODUS isn't in contact with the rest of the Enclave as Eckhart didn't want him to be and sabotaged his secure communications link.  The Kovac-Muldoon wasn't able to communicate with them before MODUS lost the link and so itsn't likely to be able to now that he has it back.
---
"Maxson, now in control of the entire Mariposa base, declared himself to be in full desertion from the U.S Army via radio on [October 20, 2077](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline#October). He got no response from the Army chain-of-command, as the rest of the Army was too busy fighting the Chinese threat. Three days later, on October 23, 2077, the nuclear arsenals of both sides were launched, and the [Great War](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Great_War) ended two hours after it started, with most of the Earth reduced to a radioactive wasteland. "
---
Since Maxson declared himself a full three days before the bombs dropped it is entirely possible that the Enclave has records of the event and may have put two and two together (by linking equipment or personnel serial numbers perhaps) and deduced that Maxson's bunch had rebranded themselves as the BOS.
---
Just started game 2 weeks ago. I was always supportive but damn... high lvl players are dicks too.
---
Only if we can have a Michael Jackson zombie dancing with them...
---
They are already working on a fix to this mate xD
---
It's kinda your fault for waiting so long to start it.
---
Something I do is that whenever I see a low level/new player, at vault 76, i go there, request to trade, request their party hat, and id they give it to me i help them basically payment I get what I want, they get helped, win-win
---
3rd base
---
Lots of high level dicks these days too. Great that you got a one shot bloodied / junkie build that can delete the SQB and even WC in two or three shots, not even letting it mutate. But I would like a few hits in to get some loot too, ya know? Selfish pricks.
---
I've come across that too! I was recovering stolen tech for Foundation, and the locator said it was in a cultist camp. I approached to find them in the middle of a battle, and it turned out to be a Vengeful Mothman! I watched him wipe them out before I took him out, and recovered the tech from the dead blood eagle raider tied up in he camp.
---
But wasn't there an unused tab or something on the game board to switch between seasons, or was I mistaken?
---
how many times they say that to push it back months
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
If we meet the goals
---
same but with my 2 shot lmg
---
i fucking wish somebody would‚Äôve helped me when i was a low level part of the reason i stopped playing was cause the player base is trash
---
Are you fucking Serious snowflake I‚Äôm fine, dicks with the same lame attack on Todd just gets old try something new and btw you can eat a sack of dicks
---
One wasteland is set to come out this year?
---
Dude I totally get it. I‚Äôm level 300+ now so don‚Äôt really notice anymore but starting out I never wanted to be ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù in an event that everyone was was cursing out over comms, didn‚Äôt want to mess up a mechanic or get in someone‚Äôs way. Wasn‚Äôt so extreme that I actively avoided interaction, just that I wouldn‚Äôt want to participate in events with higher levels, even when I got to level 50+ myself.
---
Most of us high levels are usually just really bored and want to help low levels with tough missions or just want to help in general such as giving them weapons that fits your level or giving away tons of stims. There‚Äôs no need to be afraid of an high level, some can be douchebags and try to rob you of junk, but most of us are really nice against other players especially low levels
---
Actually it isn't since the only reason I'm not finishing is this bug.  Logic.
---
If we reach the glass donation amount for atlas event I think.
---
I can only dumb my game down so far. Most times, I don‚Äôt even go for the legendaries. At all. But I always go for the event win. Sorry, not sorry.
---
I have a feeling that Bethesda's going to screw it up and these big fights are going to wind up heading the opposite direction. Where instead of having the big boss enemy die almost instantly, it'll be half an hour trying to whittle down a massive bullet sponge and failure. I have 0 faith that Bethesda won't fuck up. They still haven't fixed the auto-complete bug for the "legendary" run.
---
If you had started sooner, the bug wouldn't have mattered.  You could have had cusion.
---
Lots.
---
* Primal Cuts Event; animals spawn and you kill them to pick up their prime meat. Sometimes legendaries spawn at the end and you receive legendary weapons or armor. It's a quick and easy event netting you gear, treasury notes for gold bullion, the new currency, and lots of easy XP
---
* A special Primal Cuts event triggers once every hour; people gather, it's a different kind of event, not just killing, but you help fill up a meter. You can trade in 5 Prime Meats for legendary scrip and get a decent buff, forgot if it was an XP buff. You also get a legendary at the end.
---
* Out of all this, you can get rare unique, drops, cosmetics, recipes, plans, gear.
---
* All the meat that you gather, you can cook it and eat it for even more buffs. 
---
* The Good With Salt luck card is well needed for this event if you want to preserve the meat for infinite buffs and rewards ;)
---
It‚Äôs easier for a parent to just buy their children a console.
---
On that same token, it‚Äôs easier for a tradee (labour worker) to just go out and buy a console so they don‚Äôt have to muck abouts with too much software and whatnot. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure how it is away from my country, but in Aus you‚Äôll essentially meet working class, and children on consoles.
---
PC does have a lot of nice folk,
---
But PC also contains the largest majority of what some would call ‚ÄúBasement dwellers‚Äù
---
Or ‚ÄúKeyboard warriors‚Äù.
---
When it comes to Fallout though, I think it‚Äôs more predominant on PC just due to the fact that most of the franchise has been on PC. 
---
That‚Äôs not to say there isn‚Äôt a lot of console players however.
---
With the old school players sticking to their roots (PC master race) you‚Äôre just bound to find more relaxed folk within the franchise on Pc. 
---
Those seeking immersion rather than drama.
---
not disease cures, maybe blood packs instead? probobly not that often tho
---
This is how i see it. I have a bloddied stealth commando that has 2 strength. With the legendary perks I'll be able to take some points from agility and perception,  and up my strength a bit.
---
I've never seen someone quit an event because im there, lmao.  But thinking that someone probably left or felt belittled because I showed myself makes me giggle happy.
---
I‚Äôve tried all that nothing seems to work. This is one challenge I don‚Äôt think il ever complete üòû
---
Some people's ability to reconcile bullshit is uncanny.  I make a point not to argue with those who are only here to argue.  You know exactly what I meant. I put in the time and effort.
---
No, but I have a lot of points in strenght because of the carry weight, reduced junk weight and chem weight perks. I thought it would be useful as my armor is really bad and I take a lot of damage. If it doesn't make any substantial difference, I'll remove it. For example, assaultrons, deathclaws and a crowded group of 68 level charred ghouls and such melt me in a few seconds.
---
Order of mysteries? oh fuck yeah. Also, I want them to add npcs in whitespring and bunker because the 76 dwellers won't be the only ones who find out. As well as basement of OOM manor
---
offcourse they will not, best they can do i add more bugs. Take it or leave it xD
---
I didn't "come here to argue."  If you had just started a week earlier you would have been fine.
---
I would. Have you done BOS missions yet? That Bos recon rifle is easy to craft
---
Yea pretty sure i get to use my stuff just not store it anymore so it should be all G.
---
it's like gta, but more buggy, way way way shorter load times, and a worse "story" (pre wastelanders)
---
Shouldn't have waited until the very end to finish it.
---
Trying to crack the code yourselves is also valid... Yes, we can bypass that whole part of the game with nukacrypt, but this really should not "the" thing to do by default.
---
Actually if you think logically, using nukacrypt to bypass the nuke code access or using a magic weapon to kill the SQB instantly are quite the same: in both cases, you bypass all the effort, not with the same consequences, but still.
---
awesome cheers i have the recipe but been lazy
---
I got a possum badge 2 days ago from Campfire Tales
---
Did you make new character and see if it worked?
---
Plus it says play music on belly and it says not comlepted or showing other part
---
Same with the photo mode in forest region,
---
Literally just submitted a bunch of tickets for my broken ones üòÇ
---
double true. i've been on since beta lvl three fifty something &amp; i get along just fine solo. don't really team up unless it's to complete a daily. hit up most events, do my part and don't frack w anyone. 
---
OP... as stated above hit up any event with the exception maybe of earl. you won't be "in the way" or a nuisance at all. you're hard pressed to do any real damage to a positive event outcome.
---
fuck yes, COD Zombies vibes
---
The Halloween event involves mischief for whitesprings  so close. I guess you could run through and aggro as many ghouls as possible during the event
---
I did the Mr. Messanger event in the Cranberry Bog one time and every single enemy that spawned was an albino death claw. There had to of been at least 10 legendary ones. I don‚Äôt remember exactly how many were three star but there were at least three of them. I almost shat myself...
---
Greaser jacket painted red, jeans, this can work. And a rare drop for the jacket as well.
---
Only time I've ever seen Mirelurk Spawn is during Scorched Earth.i think the SBQ fires them like projectiles?
---
The reality is that low levels do it to, so suck it up and get there first.  If you don't somebody will kill it.
---
Be careful with wandering around to do dailies, side quests, etc. If you wander around too much, Bethesda might intervene and lock you in your office so that you cannot move anywhere....
---
I got whoopies in the quarry x3 I killed all mirls then when the queen come I hit her a couple times to follow me then ran behind the building for the hatchlings to come but you need the diseased ones let them hit you. It can take several minutes but it will work. Make sure to have radaway and stims with u
---
OH MY GOD.  I THOUGHT WE WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE TO SAY OVERCUCUMBERED.
---
I have a TSE lever action and it is not great. Lever actions don't have a magazine mod for armor mitigation so splitting the damage across multiple projectiles hurts the performance against armor more than it otherwise would. Instigating or junkies would be a much better effect.
---
No I don‚Äôt think so
---
They give you more than enough time to finish it even with the bug.
---
You have to the little mini quest there in the warm up time for event or during event. Give it a Google but if your animals are healing every wave youl get the backpack on completion
---
Nice
---
Aside the point. There shouldn‚Äôt be a whole day I just can not progress. I have shit to do with my life on other days even if it‚Äôs just just playing this game in particular. Luckily I‚Äôve never had the bug but still.
---
In my experience (with my Handmade), I get to run the clip all the way empty, but as the reload starts the ammo count will hop up to 12-14 of my 25 rounds. It's a purely visual bug; I still get to use my whole clip every time.
---
Are you certain this isn't the same thing? It could be the game lets you fire out the full core, but the number hops up before you notice it's hit zero. Then perhaps part of the glitch is recreating that core in your inventory (since I carry thousands of 5.56, I'd have no way to know if I'm keeping 12-14 extra rounds per clip).
---
With the rolls she tends to give us... yeah. Yeah, you‚Äôre probably right.
---
Same I‚Äôm lvl 405 and can‚Äôt get it to register but il give it a try what you said thank u
---
Yup. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs a post-apocalyptic wasteland. We‚Äôre all just trying to survive here and if a high level is kind enough to allow you to get some, and many do, consider yourself lucky, not entitled.
---
why did Bethesda bother making receiver, muzzle, and barrel if you could only change the receiver? were they going to add additional mods for the lmg and just changed their mind or what?
---
lol that‚Äôs epic. Closest I got was two same weapons only the third effects were different.
---
Random result every time you make one
---
You can get some plans and other stuff from them. I've done a bunch of them, I needed the robot leg plans the other day and went on a tear with a bunch of them - didn't get what I was looking for, but I got a ton of other stuff.
---
Once you do them a few times, it's pretty easy to go back and burn through what you've got. First couple of times though, the sites are a bit of a pain to locate.
---
[This site is pretty useful for finding them.](http://dulfy.net/2018/12/02/fallout-76-treasure-maps-guide/)
---
Lead - Luck Hole Mine with Excavator PA. Nets 4-500 lead ore.
---
Steel - Any event with lots of gun toting enemies, scrap the weapons with the Scrapper perk equip. About 1-2000 steel scrap per event.
---
Gun Powder - Not sure on this, I use 2mm EC, so no gun powder needed.
---
Runs home! Shoots the hoop! TOUCH DOOOOOWN!!!
---
I was hoping for a sniper of some sort to replace the one I‚Äôm using now as it‚Äôs only level 10
---
Thank you il give that a go üôè
---
First time I did it, I somehow didn't do enough damage to it, and when i started to loot the wendigo spawns my game crashed leaving over half the corpses unlooted. I lost out on over 100 screws and im still pissed
---
Zombie train
---
weights give lots of lead
---
do uranium fever and line in the sand and use scrapper and guns n bullets #5 for silly amounts of steel
---
Bird bones and marsupial Mutation together causes that running man mid air stuff.
---
TBH, if I see a low-level show up that's not on my team, I trigger the glitch.  All they have to do is throw grenades to tag most of the spawns and rake in the XP.
---
Seriously?
---
To add to this, if you hug the left-hand wall upon entering the cave itself and follow the wall around you'll end up at a decent sniping spot which the deathclaws can't get to, at least in my experience, and I've used this cave quite a few times for SCORE challenges. Could be useful for anybody who might struggle to fight two deathclaws normally. The place I usually shoot from is at 90 degrees to where you come in, with the cave's entrance on the right. There is a pillar blocking part of your view, but there's usually one deathclaw patrolling that you can open fire on.
---
Got a suppressor's explosive fixer yesterday. Makes my 3rd explosive fixer in game, made me decide to try and get one of every major prefix.
---
I would love DLC around Vault 76 dwellers, like add some C.A.M.P outposts, and NPCs we can talk about life in the vault and after. 
---
Maybe some questline where 76 becomes peacekeeper between other factions.
---
im assuming good events for steal are ones with mole miners? and holy fuck 500 lead ore? what about acid? gonna need lots of acid to "smelt" that ore.
---
Lucky Hole Mine &amp; Excavator for Lead.
---
-
---
West-Tek Super Mutants for Steel.
---
Toxic Larry's, Flooded Trainyard &amp; Tanagra Town for Acid.
---
Scrapper, Ammo-Smith &amp; Super Duper Perk Cards.
---
It‚Äôs a preference thing with the codes, but I don‚Äôt think they are the same. 
---
Using nukacrypt just saves the launcher time, and affects no one else on the server. If you use nukacrypt on a launch, it will not affect me at all, and no one will be wagging fingers at you. 
---
Using a magic weapon to kill SBQ in seconds affects the entire server. It takes loot away from everyone, wastes nuke cards if they magic gun didnt launch the nuke, wastes time of the launcher if they aren‚Äôt the magic gun, wastes caps of everyone who showed up early.
---
This must be why they‚Äôre nerfing both weapons by 80%. They don‚Äôt have to fix a bug for weapons they can just make obsolete instead
---
Used to see a lot of Melee folk utilise that weird glitch in SBQ fights
---
I feel this. Whenever I encounter another player I wave and then book it in the opposite direction before they can interact with me because I'm so socially anxious. There are a couple of events I'd really like to do but I'm too scared of fucking it up for more experienced players who know what they're doing.
---
Just claim them if you want them that bad.  Surely you can free up 5lbs.
---
The only time I don‚Äôt wait for others to tag is during Radiation Rumble, every time I waited, some scavengers would die. So during that event I kill ghouls as fast as possible and don‚Äôt care whether they are legendary or not.
---
And VATS. Let me heal while in VATS.
---
Irrelevant.
---
Something similar happened to me recently but with an AR, Also came up saying ‚ÄúMissing Ammo Required‚Äù when i had a full mag. Found the fix and it was because it had Ultracite .45, 5.56 and Ultracite 5.56 all selected while using it and using all 3 ammo at once without me knowing. Double check that isn‚Äôt the issue for you.
---
yeah I've noticed that uranium fever can net ~2000 steel with scrapper
---
Honestly modding in this game is so...bland. There‚Äôs only like 7 good weapons in the whole game and only like one attachment for each slot worth using ever. I know we‚Äôll never get the gunsmith from cod but just imagine...
---
Yup. Did this on all of my alts and it never did work on any of them. Same with Bog Town.
---
When an event is instanced like this on the tap mechanism seems weird imo. All those down there should be able to loot the boss if you ask me.
---
I use a fixer and it happens constantly. Only really when I'm doing scorched earth or a colossal problem tho, which is very convenient. Always happens on 10 rounds as well.
---
You won't be able to access the old legendary board to claim them once the new board comes out.
---
I ..... LOVE all these ideas! lol
---
where could i find G&amp;B #5 if there is a guaranteed spawn
---
I always help out new players and I've never experienced this. Its always the other way around for me. I'm almost level 80 now and anytime I see newbies they are just doing their  thing and I'll help them if they need it, throw them some spare gear and we all have a good time. Most of the high levels I see just delete bosses with ridiculous weapons in 2 seconds so no one else gets the loot, follow you around smacking you and shooting you in groups of 2-4 hoping you'll shoot back so they can steal your junk, hell I had one come into my workshop and act cool and then as soon as I opened my stash box he started capping and kills me, takes my junk, and once he's capped my workshop just leaves the game. Its so toxic lol just yesterday I had a group of 3 level 150+ dudes following me around just shooting me hoping it attack back for at least 15 minutes. Just because they have nothing better to do I guess
---
I was a day one player and stopped more or less from March 2019 to March 2020 (just missed both Fasnachts sadly). It is hard realizing there was limited time content you missed that you might have enjoyed, but I just remind myself I was doing something else enjoyable or important with my life during that time and I don't need everything.
---
Also anecdotally, it feels easier for me to come back to the game after a long absence than a short one. Maybe because it was obvious I was going to have missed a lot. And also because there's so much new stuff in the game that it felt rewarding to return and distracted me from anything I may have missed out on.
---
Never seen one
---
I agree the two shot lever action is not great. My favorite is the instigating or bloodied.
---
Rose's memorial
---
I read on the official site that during gi joe... I mean armored ace... That all the season specific stuff could be gotten with atoms.
---
Yep, happened to me today as well. I wasn't going to finish but it's still the straw that broke the camel's back. This has happened to me more than once through this season and they've yet to fix it. I guess stupid events like mEaT wEeK and farming Atom Shop whales are more important than fixing actual issues in the game.
---
seriously and yet there was a thread a week ago complaining about people who are "impatient" at player vendors
---
Well, there IS no Appalachian Enclave.  Just an empty base and a damaged AI.  Which is more than you can say for the Appalachian BOS, they just have an empty base...
---
Yes, an expedition from Lost Hills is on the way...but who's to say that they will survive the decade?  I mean Lyons' expedition didn't expect to find anyone on the east coast...and apparently didn't.
---
As to MODUS...he has no communications with the rest of the Enclave and that's that.  His prewar colleague (the ZAX AI) at Raven Rock DOES have communications with the Enclave (ZAX passing the time as an adviser to the Enclave President) and Raven Rock is only 250 or so miles away.  Perhaps MODUS would be interested in sending a scouting party to Raven Rock as there are lots of reasons to do so (possible reconnection with the Enclave, possible reconnection with his Colleague ZAX, possible source of advanced computer supplies for his own repairs, etc.).
---
Oh that‚Äôs genius, you‚Äôre evil that‚Äôs for sure
---
Definitely relevant.  I want to start the next season in a week, not whenever they solve the bug.  You could lose like half the season to the bug and be fine.
---
I have, but it took 270 levels for me to find it. Bear arm is the other one to benefit from some weight loss, what with its heavy mod.
---
yes, but... if they were to do that people would just freeload, especially low levels imo there should be a level limit to join the event.
---
The Overseer wanted to rebuild Sutton, a vault 76 town would be great.
---
Dont play nw, i stopped playing it and it stopped happening, its just that easy.
---
This. If needing large amounts of cloth for gunpowder go to the fairs and scrap cups and hotdog wrappers
---
Will there be a tile with 150 atoms? If so that should allow you to complete it.
---
No it's irrelevant, this should not happen at all and has been happening since the fucking thing started and even before that. It shows the lack of care and general incompetence we're dealing with here.
---
I would recommend an AA/E/FR or an Instigating/E/FR Lever action. 
---
Or both if you want, because instigating can one shot most enemies and then use the AA one for bosses/tougher enemies
---
I might need to upgrade my magazine to stinging then finally. Thank you for the explanation. :)
---
Game pass is the only reason I'm able to play and it showed me the game is nowhere near as bad as it used to be, so I'm pretty happy it's on game pass or if have never given it a chance. And even enjoying it like I do now, I doubt I'd be willing to pay Bethesda so I can play it. Shit is fun but it's still a buggy mess that I doubt they'll ever actually make functional. Multiple daily crashes alone is enough to make me stop playing for the day and ragequit to youtube because I'm not about to recapture and rebuild my workshops for the fourth time in a row just to have it crash AGAIN afterwards
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a good point. But high level players could also free load. I‚Äôve seen this dozens of times. 
---
Maybe both of these features at once could make up for it.
---
Nope
---
I saw someone else say this a while back and tried it and it didn't work. I had collected two of the tubes though, maybe it works for 1 or 3?
---
I launched one nuke with decoding. 
---
It was so annoying to spend time collecting for one silo, decoding *and then* going through an hour + first solo run (during beta when I think I blue screened about 5-8 times, so add another 30 minutes of blue screens and restarting and joining the world), and ofc this was when everyone was low leveled, not bloodied so constant deaths with robots. 
---
I didn‚Äôt launch again for at least 6 months and it was with nukacrypt. Had a friend show me how to solo it and force me to do nuke after nuke.
---
Yeah that's another big issue, the store is an absolute mess.
---
Server hop manhunt, 100 caps for 30 seconds work
---
Well obviously it shouldn't happen, but of all bugs in the game, this one isn't so bad because it doesn't change much assuming you start the run with a decent amount of time left.
---
I think the biggest problem is those players give a bad name to all low level players. I'm only 34, I dont ask for free stuff, because whats the point in being so overpower you walk through the beginning of the game. Its a wasteland it meant to be hard to get ammo, food, clean water ect at the beginning. This is also why I only stick to player vendors rather than trade, that way I know I'm getting something I want/need and something they don't need.
---
Most likely not.  Claim them *today*.
---
&gt;bolt action rifles 
---
&gt; M1 Garand 
---
???
---
Sure you can. You can also join me. I'll place discord server link in post.
---
yeah, the level limit would be a minimum of half the recommended level for the event so for sqb it would be at least 25 to join the event
---
When you go to quest items in the workbench, it only requires 1 broken tube to make the new one. Just finished it now and it worked on PS4
---
That‚Äôs not the point...
---
There just assholes
---
They most definitely do not or else my inventory wouldn't be full of Fusion Cores with 8 to 11 charge.
---
As interesting of an idea as that is, I don‚Äôt think the rust devils exist yet for another 200 years.
---
Something like them, however, could work.
---
I got 4 cursed harpoons in a row first day, nothing since.
---
That would be amazing almost like arroyo
---
You didn‚Äôt get that from the colossus itself you got it from the event
---
Upvoted for truth.
---
Yes it is.  If you had started just a week earlier you would have been fine.  It's been a known bug for forever.  Yes Bethesda should fix their game, but until they do, deal with it yourself.
---
What you have to have the perks equipped too for it to unlock things. That's dumb as fuck.
---
LOL
---
Grab a bow and mod it with fire arrows (or grab a tesla rifle but that weapon is kinda buggy and hated nowadays), you don't need to kill to get exp just use those aoe damage weapons to tag the enemy groups and let those high levels do the kills.
---
Yes! I'm 100% with you, I feel the same way around higher level people. And now that I'm level 80 I still kind of feel the same way because I barely have a build or anything and feel woefully under equipped vs them
---
This would be the one I‚Äôd be most excited for. Surely not all of them are brainwashed murderers who can‚Äôt think beyond cleansing the holy land.
---
Didn't the season start June 30th? Why wait to clear 100 ranks in just a month? Also there was literally thousands of posts telling people how to avoid and fix the SCORE bug and daily reminders to do so that you obviously ignored. I understand you're mad and frustrated but you should be directing that at yourself not the people in the comments.
---
Just found that out, after collecting another 250 leather.
---
Yea, Modus actually told us that the appalachia Enclave sabotaged its links. I may have missed something tho. I thought we fixed it when we linked him back to the Kovac-Muldoon. I will have to do a lil more research on it then, thank you.
---
But we now have an other problem. I don't know what type of Brotherhood of Steel presence we are about to get back in the Appalachia but...Maxson isn't supposed to¬† eventualy be informed of the existence of the Enclave over here.
---
Idk what Bethesda is planning to do with all this, but it's sure they will have to do something with the Enclave...or Modus at least ! Same with Rose...
---
We all want a lil more lore attached to them, they'll have to do something !
---
I want one. I'll trade you 17 shovels and 88 Harpoon guns
---
We can now instantly force any lock in the game with 0% chance to fail, what's bad about that?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs definitely way more time consuming to do a decoder run. I feel like my character has ‚Äòdone‚Äô everything in game currently, though. So do it only for some additional challenge now and then. Having said that, an experience similar to that of the OP would destroy the novelty factor of it for me pretty quickly. When I drop nukes now it‚Äôs mainly for others/community, as I‚Äôm happy enough with my own gear by this point. To see some muppet come in and insta kill the queen would infuriate me no end.
---
The manor definitely wouldn‚Äôt only be 76 dwellers, but Sam Blackwell has the only keycard you get in for the co feeds up all bunker.
---
The way I see it major and minor attributes are just nice to have or icing on the cake for armor. Not like weapons where they are a major contributor, at least the major ones.
---
Is it the one where it very painfully completes in the middle of your screen to level 100 from level 1? In which yes and after happening every day for months, it is starting to drive me crazy üòÇ
---
It doesn't work for me either. I'm on Xbox.
---
Its a joke. You have to spend 3 point on hacker an 3 points on pick lock AND one LEGENDARY perk just to gain the ability to unlock things without having to open menus an move shit around. Because nobody should be using 6 points for hacker an pick lock wearing them as part of their build at all times.
---
Agreed. If you can‚Äôt figure out how to decode for the launch, you don‚Äôt deserve to launch a nuke.
---
I was by no means saying all game pass players are bad. Just more players in general will also mean more aholes
---
And in the 1.3k hours I've played I've had less than 10 crashes. I don't see how people have that many lol
---
There could be npc vault dwellers like Sam at foundation i think his name is.
---
I mean modus is supposed to a really smart AI so there‚Äôs a really big possibility that modus does know and might feel threatened when the Expedition comes
---
Nope. Just regular alien blasters
---
Now fusion cores are a different story, I‚Äôm not familiar with how those behave since I have the grounded mutation, but I‚Äôd wager it‚Äôs a similar situation. I would try firing full auto in a controlled situation so I could monitor how your ammo is being effected as I reloaded but I don‚Äôt have a weapon that uses cores on my character.
---
Which starts today
---
Man I thought I'd never have to swap the perks in looks like im going ammo factory and just upgrading my perk points.
---
Is that a good or bad thing?
---
I was thinking more like NCR. But yeah.
---
I myself haven't been in a while and recently I've been playing more and I'm lvl 52 and had alot of good people help me
---
A basic "horde mode" would be a huge improvement. 
---
The event would be "public" &amp; would take place in a random, unowned Workshop. The players would have to survive at least 10 minutes against waves of attackers - which would get progressively larger and more powerful (for basic rewards).
---
If you lasted 15 minutes, you'd get better rewards, and if you survived the full 20 minutes, you would get top tier rewards.
---
Honestly fuck the player base fuck the guy who explosive baited my camp
---
You can change urban to forest but not vice versa or back again so beware. Same goes for the armor.
---
I saw that a few days ago ... In the mutations list I had the full negative effects shown (-4 INT for example) and switched to the specials tab and took Class Freak off then added again. The specials stats were correct as expected, so the mutations summary was a visual glitch.
---
When this happens do you still get to claim rewards?
---
Ya that to
---
Yeah, they are a complete waste of time, literally the worst 3 weapons in the game.
---
Consider yourself lucky, I've played around a month maybe a little less and have gotten far more than ten lmao. The game is fun but it's a mess. Idk if it's poor optimization or what but it's god awful and everyday I play there Is a minimum of 1 crash, usually 2. I try to just shrug it off but sometimes it's enough to make me hop to youtube or just play something else because it's not worth the trouble especially when I'm doing events like ACP and just crash as we are finishing the event. Major waste of time and resources that absolutely triggers the shit out of me üòÇ
---
Cool, thanks!
---
Sixteen times the necromancy
---
all random spawns. 
---
lost home has 2 magazine spawn points https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i6sj3o/here_is_why_lost_home_is_the_bomb_yo/
---
In your inventory
---
I didn't mean the M1 was a bolt action i meant it would be cool to see it in the game
---
Well the enclave is the military and well they have a lot more control
---
I'm down for it personally, but I see why others may not be too keen lol
---
It's a lot of clicking, but a hardened handmade has a lot more dps for bosses than a lever action. A little more than half the damage per shot against a scorch beast queen but 8 times the fire rate.
---
I'd like to see a few more changes to NW. Maybe you'd call them modes... But ramp up the NPC enemies numbers... Make them highly hostile and add lots more health.  That can be combined with the fire ring and last person standing wins.  
---
Another mode I think would be fun is common weapons.  Only weapons found are melee or bows.  Would be fun to play instead in insta Gauss gun deaths.
---
Don't play nw, problem solved.
---
Kinda the pot calling the kettle black here.  But either way, sorry that happened to you.  It will be interesting to see if the next season is fixed.
---
Yes, its been datamined a long time ago.
---
Yeah, it happens to me all the time.
---
Well this is what we kinda have to avoid, they aren't supposed to be aware of their both existence lol. Man...devs will have to be really creative if they wanna keep the lore intact lol.
---
Also nice dog lol
---
We already have bolt action rifles?
---
It's in the aid section with chems and If you open it around other players, they get the positive effects too :)
---
I have an UGL. I carry around 60 to 70 FCs. It fixes it until you get down to 30s. Of course I have power user double fusion cores so around 999 rounds. Also have the batteries included card too to lighten the load a little. I've done well at ACP reload at least 4 times.
---
Was doing all dailies except NW and even went on holidays for 3 weeks and managed to finish 100/100 with only buying last two with atoms.
---
thank you.
---
Not to mention the workshops are some pretty cool places to build, itd be nice if you could do them all. However, dont get rid of the ability to spawn "new" private servers or you're talking about taking away a huge benefit for me to collect my static item spawns.
---
I like to help lower level players, either with support on an event or backup if they get in over their head when exploring, or a few stims etc or scrap. Don't run, there is little to do in the game when all content has been seen many times, so we seek out things to do. Friends are made this way, just say hi and thank you, accept what's dropped ... It's meant in the best possible way.
---
I'm always worried I'll kill something too fast and lower levels won't get the tag. Causes constant anxiety.
---
It happens with the automatic laser rifle
---
[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ioc2f3/suggestion_id_love_nothing_more_than_a_left_4/) started out as a comment reply to this post but it got too big end was more or less it's own suggestion post in the end.
---
&gt;The issue is tesla rifles  
---
I'm pretty sure I know why your Gat Plasma isn't causing any issues.
---
Keep going for the event win, i wont one shot anything as long as the objective is completed. I usually spend radiation rumble in a hazmat and just hop i can tag a legendary in passing. Im more concerned about getting those numbers up as high as i can.
---
ngl I always had that feel, that u will see the same character preset over and over again for npcs and players
---
The correct title is why are all players dicks these days. As someone who started playing recently, high level (100+) are constantly joining level 25 events and one-shotting the legendaries so new players can't get cool weapons. They then proceed to try and sell those weapons back to us.   
---
Low level plays are also dicks, probably because xbox game pass (the reason I'm even playing) means a lot of people who either didn't want to buy the game or couldn't afford the game are suddenly playing. And we all know people from the 2nd catagory are probably pre-teen twatbags that spend all day insulting people over online games, plus the people from the 1st catagory probably are just playing to shit on the game and the people who play it.   
---
I was pleasantly surprised with the wastelanders content and very much so enjoy the game, but it's not one specific group of players that suck, it's the fact that internet anonymity allows anyone to suck and not have consequence.
---
Sounds like you were at Sons of Dane site, that medical box is part of Rose's quest to make SB bait.
---
Wouldn't it be cool if there were more variants?
---
Hacked weapon on ps4?can it be done?
---
Yes! Finally, all that beer drinking will pay off! I will donate the bottles and drink some more in order to provide more 'donations'!
---
Yeah, I've got a vampire minigun works wonders. Got a tesla rifle and assault rifle with it too. The tesla does alright, but the assault rifle feels lacking. I assume the shovel is bugged cause the rest of the things on it are from the cursed shovel. Swing speed and weight reduction. I'm pretty sure it's a cursed shovel with an identity crisis.
---
Nope, I have soloed her on private. Won't complete the challenge.
---
I've seen Formula P recipe for 500 caps and I bought one the other day for 20 so I guess the player didn't know what they had.
---
It's great for multiple shot weapons from gatlings, to 50 cal and shotguns .... Improves accuracy if you take up to 3 of them. I now farm the kaleidapore and ash rose can be found all around the ash heap, bloodleaf from Flatwoods.
---
Love the slutty bed. I wasnt sure if they were just marking something as free for 1st users abd everyone could have it if they paid atoms for it. Still havent tried answering it.
---
That or they're projecting.
---
It's 20
---
They‚Äôre in the aid section but try and open them at events where there‚Äôs other players around, if you open one near people you all get the xp boost
---
I go in with my "magic" shotgun and 1 shot Wendigos.  I always leave with a couple hundred more shells than when I started
---
Yup, was at sons of fame, but I finished rose's a while back.
---
Maybe someone else was doing that quest and I just happened to ran across the medical box ? Still, felt like a thief when I realized.
---
You can claim all workshops in private servers. Just expect a lot of annoying defend events. I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily claim every single workshop, but mostly the ones that are in a great spot and look homey.
---
You make a fairly good point, however, they could implement a system where even when you have claimed the workshop, static items still regenerate every 24 hours.
---
I just want them to remove the intersects existing item message. I WANT my stuff to criss cross.
---
You‚Äôre clearly not well educated on this topic. One level of the legendary perk means you Auto Unlock both terminals and locks that are level 0, and can hack/pick the other 3
---
Yes just claimed everything but the lunchboxes
---
This month was the armor bench skin.
---
No problem!
---
Pm sent with my GT.
---
You clearly didn't read what I said. Also imagine spending a legendary point on this..
---
Yep. Espescally playing on single player or non dedicated. Once you place your item you have 30 seconds to pick it up for free. If not you have to demolish it and recraft it. Thats bullshit.
---
Got magic armor on? Lag is also not a bad thing poor latency but high frame rate causes some magic to happen where high latency and low frame rates is a curse.
---
I nuked a camp there the other day for havinge shite prices in their vendor. Im not sorry if this was you.
---
I learned to accept their help by putting myself in their place. 
---
It's fun to share a thing you love, isn't it? Wouldn't it be fun to help someone have a great experience and get to share the feeling of discovering something you know so well through the eyes of somebody seeing it for the first time?
---
In that way, you're helping them.
---
I've had similar experiences all the time this community is very kind and understanding ive only met one dickhead and i left the server before he could do any damage
---
I'm not complaining about not being able to finish, I mean look at my rank I wasn't gonna finish anyway and accepted that weeks ago. I'm complaining that this even happens at all, has been happening since the beginning and even before that and nothing has been done. If it carries over into Season 2 then that will stunning to me. 
---
I sucked it up the times it hit me before but today was just the last straw for me and I had to say something, there's plenty of others with the same problem all season long and they've done nothing.
---
Meat 6 Days, OP absolute legend
---
OK? Never said anything about instantly unlocking things. This is about having to swap shit around constantly to unlock things.
---
Sept 10-14
---
How do you check if someone is on pacifist?
---
Not reviving you isn‚Äôt being an asshole. A low level might not have stimpacks or so few that it‚Äôs not worth it for him to revive you. If he doesn‚Äôt take your junk or t bag then he really hasn‚Äôt done anything wrong.
---
Again, I have to ask: do people not realize there is a website for this game?
---
I think this might me the creepy dude following a Spanish girl around last night haha. Apologies if not, we have the pictures though haha.
---
What's your armor and what are its stats?
---

---
You'll get it and it will be a surprise. It was bugged for me for a long time, but somehow triggered when I decided to get the other diseases. I think it finally kicked in when I got Whoopsies and Fever Claw at the same time. Made no damn sense.
---
They aren‚Äôt all like that. Gave a level 15 a full set of raider power armor, and some weapons I used scrips on. Threw a heart emote and wanted to team up. I added him good dude
---
Bruh suppressor on revolver would be the dream
---
I'm level 105 and I still play like a level 15 player. Sneak everywhere. Hide when possible. Run away when shit hits the fan. I still avoid the Bog and Mire, unless a quest drags me there.
---
I actually prefer events with lower level players. Its usually less competitive and more relaxed. Also, low levels have never one-shot a legendary on me before.
---
Like I said, I did look and didn't find what I was looking for. No need to be an ass.
---
I saw this morning, had a brand new core went from 500 to 450, and then reloaded itself, so annoying.
---
not as of yet butbthey may not update until tomorrow since they do it by hand and its a holiday in the US
---
After seeing the Primal Cuts for the first time, it made me really really want a true Horde mode. It is clear that Bethesda CAN do it as we saw with Primal Cuts but maybe if they can perfect instances or separate areas for the Horde wave events, they could be very popular XP farms, especially with One Wasteland coming soon.
---
Hmm, idk then
---
Easy to answer!
---
The pipe is (breathes pipe fumes and passes out..)
---
Happens for the minigun too. So the minigun has the spin up bug still and now the road bug... Just awesome!!
---
*reload
---
I think it might be how you were raised. I was taught to be respectful of my elders. I find in games like this much like yourself I treat those with higher levels with much deference. Levels translate to seniority.
---
But ya gotta get over it what you gonna lose? Some scrap. Plenty of that, you are missing out get stuck in.
---
I wasn't trying to sh$t on your idea, it was my thought too. I don't think anyone has a solution. Other than one guy who said he contact Bethesda and they fixed it for him. But who knows if that holds any water.
---
Not everyone is comfortable using a mic, and this is perfectly normal, especially in an international game, where not everybody is fluent in english, or again comfortable speaking. If there was text chat, I am sure many more people would want to comunicate.
---
We will see. Nevertheless...for the good of the lore ( from what we actually know of it right now )...everything that is happening in the Appalachia must stay in the Appalachia because the existence and the impact of the Vault 76 dwellers existence has never been involved in the lore before. The Brotherhood of steel must not inform Roger Maxson of the presence of the Enclave (Modus) in the appalachia and Modus must not be able to inform an other enclave "chapter", if I can say it like that, of the existence of the Brotherhood of steel.
---
I used this guide [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/g4866u/fix_for_sludge_lung_bug_100_working_on_console) and got it to pop first time. It just works!
---
The consistency is rough in this game. Sometimes things work and sometimes they just decide not to.
---
I'm curious, does your game crash on Xbox? I'm on PC and it happens to both me and my friends pretty frequently.
---
I'm glad to hear you've had similar experiences. I've actually been killed once by another player after I got myself wanted after accidentally stealing from an owned workshop. But in contrast, yesterday me and another player happened to get caught in each other's crossfire when we were killing an enemy. He could've easily killed me fair and square then as he was higher level, but he didn't, we just hung out for a while afterwards instead.
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt think you were I‚Äôm just genuinely out of ideas.
---
I use those as well on my commando, still no issues, but I've heard people complaining about both Ash piles and goo piles causing lag and I just don't see it with either!
---
That is true because like you said not in any other games has there been a mention of Appalachia
---
Here's a tip. If you don't want to deal with stop playing the game
---
Nope, and support doesn't care when you miss out on lost score from auto complete either.
---
The magic is from the lag essentially
---
It‚Äôs actually so long
---
Do they run into something and stay there?
---
Every time I log on my guns should be 3% stronger because I possess the capacity to complain.
---
Am I doing it right?
---
&gt; The game isn‚Äôt going to remember or care if you already bought 3 out of the 5 things in the bundle.
---
Steam does this when buying game bundles and you already own some of them. The bundle will cost less. It's entirely dependent on how greedy the seller is and how customer friendly they want to be.
---
Last level gives you 500 atoms, just buy and get instant refund
---
There‚Äôs a house that is literally full of books for cloth. Then you just need acid. Haven‚Äôt figured that out other than snagglys
---
Not legitimate ones. 
---
There are plenty of "injected" ones, ones that were brought in game through a 3rd party editor, but you risk a ban if you're caught with them.
---
On PC I only see it when there's massive numbers of enemies that have died in the same location. Line in the Sand, primarily. It happens with or without the Tesla, but a Tesla definitely makes it worse. The difference between dropping to 60 or 30 frames and dropping to 15.
---
If you don't spend a ton of time at Line in the Sand I can imagine you'd almost never see it, if you ever do.
---
Even hordes of low lvl ghouls would be a challenge if you got rushed by 30+, would be fun!
---
Wait... There‚Äôs such a thing as Magic Armor?? 
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve got anything special, a full set of Unyielding urban scout armor. Chest piece (Unyielding), Left Arm (Unyielding, reduce damage while blocking, +1 PER), Left Leg (Unyielding, +1 Luck), Right Arm (Unyielding, +25 Radiation Resistance), Right Leg (Unyielding).
---
I found them on the floor! That‚Äôs the official story.
---
No, they walk out of the pod and just stands there, I have a room full of my resource things and he normly just walked around witch makes it feel nicer to me for some reason? So no it's just an open space and just stands there in the middle talking.
---
Yeah, I can't get my dad to sit down to play games for more than 5 minutes, getting him into fallout GTA or borderlands would be the coolest thing next to when we do outdoorsy stuff, you're a lucky person!
---
Is it bad that the second I hit level 50, I donned Ritual Biindings and the Ritual Mask with a piece of Chameleon armor and followed someone fresh out of the vault, occasionally scaring them with throwing knives?
---
If you just got the highest level of master infiltrator you wouldn't have to have lock pick and hacker on.
---
I think itd probably pick up healing items alongside random junk. Diluted Stimpaks and Radaways.
---
Noticed last night when I was playing when I was pairing my power armor with my gatling laser. It would reload at 7 and then that core went straight to my armor and was used up within a half minute. I usually use my cores all the way instead of reloading so I have more carry weight but now I see cores that are 0/100 in my inventory and it‚Äôs really a pain.

Benefits of console , voice chat is more common

I play on pc, and I have absolutely no idea how to turn on the mic, so that's the main reason I don't talk.
---
Would love them to bring back or give us new skins for the tents. Been in 1st a few months so I haven‚Äôt seen any.

Cafeteria?

A full set of unyielding urban scout armor, two pieces are 1* and the others have random effects like radiation resistance, PER, Luck, etc.
---
I agree, they need to bite the bullet and make non-combat perks automatically apply when relevant. It would be a huge quality of life improvement. Where it gets messy (I ended up talking about this in a job interview) is that they've established the precedent of having special points limit which perks you can equip. In theory they'd have to do away with that for non-combat perks since there's no way to let you prioritize which perks get applied if you're limited on special. In practice though I can't really think of any situations where you're equipping multiple support perks from the same special category, so it doesn't matter.

He claims to be from another, non-76 vault. My bet is he could be secret service in disguise, since he‚Äôs a bullion vendor.
---
63 and 96, depending on their experiments are also a possibility.
---
so the mentality in this community is "because you didn't buy bundle hurr durr" I shouldn't have to pay for something twice period.
---
Hell no! I‚Äôll pay the extra caps to only have to put up with the fast travel glitch for one run and deal with one less loading screen.
---
So that would mean you got the kill the queen to complete? You must share this magic.
---
Really? That‚Äôs weird... Every time I tried to Solo the SBQ with my laggy internet I failed... Maybe because Earl is stationary and not moving several meters In seconds?
---
As I mentioned in the L4D suggestion thread - Bethesda has the capability to do this as Primal Cuts (sans some errors from time to time) was a nice baseline for a horde mode. Add in "spooky enemies" and a nice halloweenish area and this could be really cool.
---
I don‚Äôt blame you.
---
Hang on. I thought this legendary card gives you +3 Hacking and Lockpicking in addition to being used automatically based on the card's level.
---
I believe I spotted a Mirelurk Queen and Spawn in Wendigo Cave just yesterday. I was down there looking to snap a picture of a Wendigo and avoided the queen and her spawn so cannot say what might happen if you engage them. Didn't notice if the queen was diseased or not, sorry. But it is a place to check out anyway.
---
Mine did same thing for two days I moved him then a day later he walks
---
&gt;Left Arm (Unyielding, reduce damage while blocking, +1 PER)
---
And boom a magic piece right away. Anything sub 140 is unreliable but does work when the stars align.  140-255 is more consistent though sub 100 is impressive the fixer is what a 98 fire rate?  Think that is a new record.
---
Eh.  Magic can be pretty buggy, obviously.  Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't.
---
Yeah. I like Gauss weapons so I at least want one of each. Maybe I‚Äôll see what the new patch will bring. If still bad I‚Äôll just make one no matter the roll.
---
In my experience:
---
* The Normal/Expert/Master damage perk card sets no longer make sense to max out because of the feeble difference in damage relative to the SPECIAL investment.  It's less worth taking all 9 points, instead of 1 of each, than ever before.
---
* Rifleman is devastated by these changes, as they presently stand.  While most enemies will still fall in 2-3 hits, the swarms you will encounter with Earle and in the Daily Ops make it very difficult to keep up with slower-firing weapons.  My toons entered PTS as Riflemen and emerged as Commandos.
---
* Bloody Mess isn't worth it compared to investing more in Critical Hit frequency and damage.
---
* Currently, Unarmed is in an awful position.  My toons could hit Earle for 700-1,200 in live.  They now pull *double-digit damage* against Earle.  There was a bug earlier with Unarmed where it was dealing well-below base damage, but despite this having been "fixed," this is still the end result.
---
Conversely:
---
* Tank Killer now works for Pistols and is a must-have for that setup.
---
* I think AP Refresh on armor will gain tremendous importance because Critical Hits are more vital than ever as a chief means of increasing damage dealt.
---
I‚Äôm also a VATS/ Stealth build and I just switched from Hardened Handmade to Powerful Automatic Handmade and it‚Äôs honestly about the same damage for a way faster fire rate.
---
Get gud

Yay! I can finally clear out some of the, something like 5,000 glass shards, I have accumulated!
---
Oh good one I‚Äôll just report you it‚Äôs fine
---
So you guys spend 15 minutes tumbling your thumbs? Because the queen fight has a 30 minutes timer
---
Watch they launch the next season just as bugged
---
I moved him for a couple of hours but there isn't a place other than there I can put him, other than there he will be standing in the main hall way, with him and Dagurra I won't be able to walk anyway lol.
---
But I won't be able to get kills if they take it away. I can't aim and I rely on shooting the floor in the general area of the enemy.
---
Is either that or sometimes just hacked imposible weapons
---
I am right there with you.  I build my camp to be functional.  I got food to harvest, cooking station near the food, room for craft benches, rolling doors to hide my vendors when I am near max caps and that is really it.
---
Now you don't have to swap shit _or_ play the minigame, the perk removes hacking entirely
---
I just really want them to start putting out Halloween stuff I want to enjoy it long as possible not have it all pop up at the last minute like last year
---
I try to have themes. My current theme is my ally Gramps has a mining company.
---
And I make sure my spawn is near my vending machines.
---
Yeah it's so annoying, my auto handy does the same thing but not as often as my gat laser. I think the handy actually puts a whole clip out and the counter jumps back up but the gat definitely leaves a charge in it.
---
People ran there mouth last night after I said I took him on alone and now ppl run their mouths telling me to get good. Like you guys make any sense
---
PC really needs chat box and chat bubbles.
---
It‚Äôs not about the advice. It‚Äôs about how it was delivered.
---
How was this obtained? The purveyor? Lucky drop?
---
Got a small platform above the ground with some shops and tables.  Some purifiers in the water and crops planted.
---
All I've really done is shove some items here n there as decorations.
---
Lol Earle must have really set you off
---
That‚Äôs where my main damage comes from. When they get close and I shoot them with the G. Minigun and my health goes down I have 3 ranks in Fire proof. The only thing that really damaged me in T-65 is the hazards (the giant drill Fs anyone up I think)
---
Nice post bro I can totally help u out thanks for sharing the details of ur build, the weapon u used, what status affects/aid items u were affected by, ur mutations, perks, and specials! This is a game with pretty complex damage calculation mechanics if you want actual advice instead of hopping on shitposting to complain then get gud and tell us what ur actually up to ;;)
---
Just shoot them. If people want to be shitty then fling it back at them.
---
I head down there every time it happens to farm xp, have to reach lv 300.
---
Never seen any lag during that event, even when people glitch all the scorched into the same spot!
---
Only lag spikes I get are randomly wandering the wastes or camp building!
---
Like a flea market threw up in there.
---
That perfectly sums up my decorating philosophy for my camp and my home in real life. As long as they offer score chores to build floor and wall decorations I will continue placing random garbage everywhere and being too lazy to clean up after.
---
Mod my arms? I get the camo since that‚Äôs the only T-65 only paint job (though imo the helmet is meh to me)
---
It's the opposite for me. All the high level players are dicks, being smug about their high levels and talking down to me because i'm lower level and solo
---
Que?? Sub? New Record? I‚Äôm afraid you lost me friend. :/

[Here‚Äôs a picture of the fixer I use.](https://imgur.com/a/uXfz9Gi)
---
Well shit, apparently you didnt approve.
---
Thank you for the breakdown on these. Sounds like my heavy will be changing quite a bit soon.
---
Only one needs to be repaired - true.  Although it seems you have to have all 3.
---
Yea that's not gonna solve it. Did not play NW a single time, and I experienced the auto complete 5 separate times during season 1. I also never played/was logged in during the change-over time.
---
How about I don‚Äôt need to Tell details when I had same weapon same gear last night. I don‚Äôt need your help I simply asked why it was Easy last night and today not. I don‚Äôt need your expertise ha
---
Turning in an average of 32 million a day and we need 46 million. We may not even unlock it.

You can get addicted to more than 5 but 5 is max damage as a junkie. And i am addicted to chems I use so I can continue using them without getting addicted. Also i used to think using chems your addicted to canceled them out but nope.
---
Junkies caps at 5 chems, I use daddy0, formula P, mentats, alcohol and daytripper
---
One that comes to our camp and we have to defend against the hoard barricading doors
---
You get a good chuck of scrip (15), and access to Graham and his unique plans.
---
Once I repaired in the workbench, the quest updates with ‚ÄúSpeak to Wren‚Äù. The only odd thing was the dialogue about fixing them to get more caps but the quest completed, got my rewards and treasury notes
---
I just had some strange gat laser behavior this week. 50% core showing 750 rounds (without the perk equipped), three reloads below 250 rounds, and spins with no firing. I hadn‚Äôt had any of these issues until recently.
---
Or it‚Äôs you jackasses that run your mouth on everyone‚Äôs post. Like do I go running my mouth on peoples post no I actually go on to help not talk shit but for some reason you all are keyboard gangsters and real punks in real life
---
you can get addicted to more than 5 chems but 5 addictions is all you need to maximize your buff from junkies
---
the best chems to get addicted to vary from build to build
---
you should choose those that wont effect your build as much, as an example as a melee build youd avoid debuffs to strength
---
heres a list of debuffs, there are better lists out there but this was the first one i found.

Developing a relationship with the place u call home is one of the most rewarding experiences in this game! One day you‚Äôll run out of things to do or see someone‚Äôs cool CAMP and get inspired. When that day comes you‚Äôll never look back and you‚Äôll learn to see every place ur in with new, attentive eyes 
---
Hopefully with the introduction of instanced shelters we‚Äôll see more reasons and mechanics to care for CAMPing, i think this game could do well taking some queues from animal crossing alongside the regular stuff it‚Äôs up to
---
Y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt the only ones. I‚Äôve tried pinning the challenge in question multiple times with no luck. And even tried it in Private World with no change. Broken is a understatement.
---
I'm on Europe servers usually and not many talk, If I hear people talking its mainly on American servers when I join mates.
---
This doesn't just happen on those guns. My pipe rifle reloads itself 3 times before actually *reloading*. Such a pile of shite.
---
I have never seen in a video nor had a sub 100 fire rate weapon achieve magic damage. So that is a new record to me.   
---
Your armor with the 15% to block is magic which means it can trigger any, well I guess automatic weapon. I have many magic guns and armor just from playing testing the best I can to try and find what is the main condition to trigger it.
---
Love the Halloween vibes of this game, really hope they ramp that up. 
---
Halloween is gonna suck for alot of people this year,  let us celebrate freely at least digitally.
---
It's a bummer that special is capped at 15, it would be fun to be able to spec into both commando and rifleman simultaneously. I ended up going rifleman/heavy gunner, and commando/slugger.
---
Edit - Interesting comparing the [damage numbers](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html?left=R_W-Handmade_L-45_ModReceiver-PowerfulAutomatic_ModMagazine-Perforating_ModMuzzle-Standard_ModSights-Standard_Prefix-Junkies_Major-FFR_PHP-100_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-5_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_TankAP-36_Other-0_Mult&amp;right=R_W-Handmade_L-45_ModReceiver-Hardened_ModMagazine-Perforating_ModMuzzle-Standard_ModSights-Standard_Prefix-Junkies_Major-ADS_Aim_PHP-100_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-5_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_TankAP-36_Other-0_Mult), you're only about 16% behind in damage with the powerful automatic even if you're spec'd into rifleman. You're going through double the ammo though.
---
So like walmart, where Halloween stuff goes up right after the back to school stuff?
---
I played on Xbox since launch and LOVED the game.  I played the tough all the main quests (before Wastelanders DLC) and made it to about level 150. Once I finished all the main questlines, I got bored and stopped playing. 
---
NOW, with Game Pass I am starting to play on my PC, so needless to say, I had t start over and  I am about a level 8 right now.  Wastelanders has made it a brand new game. Before it was lonely and sad, as&gt;! everyone you were looking for either was long dead or a robot!&lt; 
---
If anyone is in a similar situation and want to play together, DM me for my Gamertag and let's concur Apalatcha together!
---
Usually somebody with a automatic Tesla rifle causing it.
---
Interesting... Wish I played on my shite internet when I was grinding for rewards from Earl... :/
---
Might have saved me a few thousand rounds. Lol
---
Lmao sorry big daddy MaYB ur not cut out for the salty spittoon
---
Looks great
---
I think it‚Äôll be possible when Legendary Cards come out. You‚Äôd only have 2 Left over points but it will definitely be possible
---
Is this a XB1 issue bc i always run Uranium Fever looting nothing until its done then i collect all meat piles. Never had lag.
---
Were you alone both times or did you have people on with you on your private server when you tried it the second time?
---
If you go to bethesda.net, look in the upper left for the games and find FO76. You should see Atlas progress as the top item. Not sure where else you looked, hope that helps.
---
Haha! I hope everyone knows I‚Äôm not trying be a curmudgeon. Do what makes you happy. If our budget was only limited by the space of our hard drive I‚Äôd probably have a second home with all the junk in the store but for my camp I don‚Äôt need a locked room with a tv, couch, shelf and mega sloth throw rug
---
this isn't it??
---
so then... does that mean the raider gold bullion trader could also be secret service?
---
So this post is totally rhetorical or somethin? Maybe the answer is because you didnt do so good today then, eh? Earle was tougher today because you did worse? Also rhetorical questions but feel free to reply üëç
---
Big bada-boom!
---
as long as there's a way to turn them off like the voice chat I'm okay with it
---
I showed up last night on a public server, the group left with 8 minutes left and his full health. I killed him with in 6 minutes, never died once and had to take on both health bars. Today I said I might as well do on my own server which I played alone on and it was a totally different fight even tho I had same armor same weapon same everything I didn‚Äôt use chems last night and didn‚Äôt again today.
---
Ah what does sub mean?
---
Hopefully it takes me forever to finish decorating besides anytime a new bundle comes out it sticks around for a month anyway
---
Oh god rolling pins, tire irons, and pipe pistols all day.
---
Well I was today years old when I learned that you can make your own card to start the event.  I was under the impression that it was only triggered by someone who did the quest, which explained why I rarely see it.  But yes I agree, events like this and radiation rumble are completely blowable if people start them early.
---
Yes, one x
---
I had a weird ammo glitch the other day where my .50 loaded in with a 456 round drum. It was fun to have an ammo glitch that benefited me instead of reloading with 100+ charge still in the GL.
---
Dude I would love this. My flaming chainsaw would have a fuckin field day lol
---
I am a punk, dk and nofx all the way but thats unrelated. And I only do it to the kind of posts that deserve a good response, and I actually like all the responses you got, fairly fitting bud
---
Its manually updated so progress is hard to pin down but I did a little number crunching - 129M at day 4/5 would equate to 161M vs a required 175M = Fail = no Purveyor sale. 
---
Basically 91k players need to have donated twice each on the last day which I think is a real stretch, especially as half the current total was in day 1. 
---
But sadly I reckon it will magically complete to avoid an embarrassing community fail. Beth really need to bite the bullet and let it go down in flames or else these events are meaningless.
---
Well that sucks, pretty much the the reward I wanted the most.
---
No downside atall..
---
When they load in yes.
---
Highly possible. They have plenty of robots down there, and why wouldn‚Äôt they have a handy or two to clean the place?
---
Smiley, of course, is highly suspect of being in the service.
---
Obviously, all of this is speculation.
---
Did you collect all three before repairing one?
---
just think how helpful it would have been for you to give that advice last week, I blame this whole thing on your lateness sir
---
The bombs fell October 23rd so it makes perfect sense why Halloween plays such a big 'role' in the series. Everyone was planning for the holiday and then they got real life horror.
---
I notice this all the time during the Colossal Wendigo fight. Reloading me at 7-10 rounds constantly.
---
That would be an awesome reward. A Legendary chainsaw, maybe a special legendary spiked bat and then the usual purveyor pool.
---
i dont know if this is satire or not and that scares me
---
‚ÄúMission failed‚Äù
---
My birthday is October 15th, to me the 15th to the 31st is all my Halloween birthday.   ^  o^
---
Cant get enough Halloween camp items.
---
Yes! I love the sound of that. As far as I know it isn‚Äôt possible to get a legendary chainsaw or ripper so I would love for them to add that in.
---
Why?  U earn rewards by completing tests.
---
Last I read yes but I don‚Äôt play pts
---
Right?! I love project paradise! I have tried going and waiting for people to show up and they almost never do, so I started waiting to see if anyone shows up (even just one) and then I will go.
---
That‚Äôs my point. I give a quest to someone to bring me sugar bombs. They get rewards for doing so
---
Yea, from my experience, most camps mostly look like lairs. In some cases i respect their creativity but most of the time it looks like they had no idea what they were doing and they just tryed to make it looks like something. Some players really complicate their situation. A bunch of useless 2 or 3 fondations/floors buildings near the cliff and no navigation benchmarks anywhere.
---
I'm like if these dudes are crying for more camp budget...they deserve their situation !
---
Use your mic, a lot of people don‚Äôt speak unless spoken to in my experience
---
But that would make quests pointless
---
This games fucked if you haven‚Äôt noticed bud
---
sub = below so in your case the fire rate is 98 which is below (sub) the typical call of 120 fire rate at bae minimum for the magic damage to work.
---
Having an awesome camp seems to draw peeps into wanting to communicate more.
---
&gt; I‚Äôd wager it‚Äôs a similar situation
---
Nah, Gatling Lasers are just super bugged. Unless I somehow shot 500 rounds within a few second bursts, that fusion core showing 425 rounds while it tries to reload is indeed not empty.
---
It definitely feels like its getting worse as well, only had it happen sporadically to me a month ago.
---
&gt;This is why they were working on One Wasteland
---
Well, it may well *help*, but that's not it's purpose.  If it stops one-shots, it's not because the problem is fixed, it's because the enemies have just been made spongy enough that the magic weapons aren't quite magic enough any more.
---
&gt;melee attack to stop it
---
Don't I feel like a dickhead, I've been opening pipboy to cancel the reload this entire time. Melee attack never even crossed my mind. Facepalm.
---
Oh. Just going by what I research when I first looked into it. I forgot to mention the perks.lol.
---
As a dedicated Bush wookie that reached rank 50 hiding in bushes, and avoided getting kills like no tomorrow, I tried out that gun with all shotgun perks +explosives and bloodied mess and Jesus it destroys people so fast. I killed someone in power armor that looked like I just took out someone in wood armor.
---
We're gonna have perk loadouts soon anyway. They will still require at least two or three menu buttons,so I'm not sure how usefull they'll be.
---
How dare you call me sir? I'm an average looking lady üòÇ
---
Nope, just got the first one and left bc I hate going through the prison lol i just went to the courtyard and repaired it there, and then the quest updated
---
The in-game lore wouldn't support MODUS calling the Enclave for help. He murdered their highest ranked officials, stole one of their satellites and Raven Rock unplugged the modem when he started awakening the ZAX that would become John Henry Eden into sentience.
---
I usually open at SBQ or at Earle.
---
Nice. I had the Prison in mind too haha.
---
90 rw missile launchers are nice to have on hand to quickly take out supply drops (for nuke cards)
---
No big! You‚Äôre just getting a feel for the game at the speed comfortable for you... you want to experience things for yourself as well, like half the players in this game. Learn by the missteps made and not involve others
---
You fail to understand what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm not the one doing the quest. I‚Äôm giving someone a quest
---
Talk shit post CAMP
---
Why are you making a post expecting people to agree yet you just blatantly lie in the last paragraph? If you‚Äôre gonna make a bethesda bad post at least make it true
---
Dunno who's downvoting you.
---
Is it possible that his difficulty level dropped once people started leaving the event making him really easy to kill? I know the bosses tend to grow in strength with more players participating. I wonder if the opposite can happen.
---
Interesting, I‚Äôd like to encourage you to get to the bottom of it, we need answers and it‚Äôs up to us to do the research. Maybe reset your inventory with a few full cores and shoot at the air and watch your ammo counter, recording the footage for analysis is also a good idea. If you‚Äôre on PC with a Nvidia card you can use Geforce to record some demos, I‚Äôd love to know the truth.
---
Wish we could combine the partially used cores at the bench somehow
---
Right.. It's so annoying because you know that the clip isn't empty..
---
No it wouldn‚Äôt, there‚Äôs only a finite amount of quests to complete and after that there‚Äôs nothing left. This would allow players to give us quests meaning there‚Äôs, in theory, an infinite amount to complete
---
Done right the imposter can be soloed as a bloodied build very easily. With about 20 stims. I still haven't tried AOC solo. Not sure I have enough ammo.
---
shouldn't have died then
---
That wendigo is a whole different class though.  I don't have god tier gear or even a stellar build, but even I have almost accidentally one-shot them before.
---
Why? I feel like you‚Äôd do much better with a kit of unyielding gear, the instance doesn‚Äôt even have rads
---
Do you think it's more valuable now to invest into special legendary cards  to hit the max 15 stats for even more equipped cards? Like its feasible now get almost all the special stats to 15+ minus 2 stats like charisma an endurance  to put out max damage and max crits.
---
Had some ultracite ammo that I dont use anymore, but found out it wont even treat  it as normal, makes excess a literal waste. I just dumped it.
---
That‚Äôs what I was figuring I mean I had no problem and only about 3 spawns showed up last night but today being I went in solo on my own world it was like I was with a team of 8. And it‚Äôs fine ppl get in a group and think I came crying for their help. I just had a serious question and I appreciate your answers thank you
---
Yep I already did. Just sucks that I had to.
---
Odd. When I died after taking down Earle, it spawned me up top. Completed the event without an issue. I've not heard of anyone spawning elsewhere.
---
Happens with every mag on my fixer. I use up about 14 of the mag and bam I am reloading. Absoloute joke!!
---
Oh I get it. Sorry my misunderstanding. So we could make a quest like kill 20 scorched and get X as a reward from the player setting the quest and to activate it would cost sugar bombs or whatever. Complicated to do I‚Äôd imagine with all the variables but yeah that would be fun
---
I turned my brightness all the way down and it started doing insane damage.
---
If you are running the event just do it in unyielding, j assume its because you want to collect springs after, in that case just out the stealth suit on your favorite wheel and equip it in the last few seconds.
---
I'm not a low level player but if someone dropped down in front of me I'd be rubbing my hands waiting for you to die to see what goodies you have on you
---
It would seem from my reading that not only do players on console have access to your actual console user name but even up address? This idea is so foreign to me. I couldn't imagine someone randomly chatting with me during an interaction in game. I don't want to be bothered about how upset you are over me stealing your collectrons stuff.
---
So a target that moves as an event in lucky he mine and doesn't give me the quest in my pip?
---
I mean they did send out plastic bags... until they were forced to send canvas
---
I used to swap weapons and even made a thread to share that tip but someone mentioned doing a gun bash instead in it. By far the easiest fix.
---
Commandos and Heavies are the least affected by this change.  There are several theories about why this is.  One is that many Heavy Weapons lack damage-boosting mods in this new algorithm that relies heavily on the *base damage* of a weapon when calculating perks, *not* the base damage *plus mods* you apply to the gun.
---
People talk a lot about a Bloodied nerf, but Bloodied is still king relative to the other options.  The real losers are the slow-firing high-damage builds like Rifleman, Gunslinger, Archer, etc.
---
Yes, you sound *super* manly.
---
I accidentally kept mine on after using it to get into the mine and got destroyed by spawns. If you really want to do stealth I‚Äôve found much more success with Using a piece of chameleon armor.
---
Faster fire doesn‚Äôt work on a lever
---
Weapons use fusion cores? Or do you mean plasma cores? (Genuinely curious as to if a weapon can use fusion cores, not trying to be a dick)
---
Could set it up to offer a specific amount of caps and 1-3 items of tiered value, like a legendary, scrap, or ammo or stims. 
---
Having them kill something wouldn't feel that useful to the quest giver, but bringing items they usually have to grind for daily could be useful,  like snaptale reeds, boiled water, nuka cola, corn, an ammo type, or a component of said.
---
Just gotta find a way to balance the calculation of said value of the requested item verses the turn in.
---
Like mebe x amount of scrap requires x amount of a tier 3 reward,  a built consumable or ammo would require x of tier 2, legendaries to scrip, would require x of tier 3.  It much more of the other 2 tiers.
---
Given how good some players are with building camps thought it would be cool if they designed a way for us to make our own mini dungeons for peeps to run for reward.  
---
Custom quest govers could be the first step towards something like that. Bethesda wouldn't need to make quite as much content if they enabled players to create unique content for people to discover. 
---
Camps are a big part of that already but we're very limited in what we can offer peeps of value for braving our spaces.
---
Yeah I also have problems with my Fixer, always wants to reload at 13 rounds like the mag is empty.
---
I do think they're a little too reliant on low latency connections, as sometimes the game does some ridiculous shit simply because it's taken more than a few ms for the servers to respond. Residential broadband can still be pretty hit and miss even in 2020.
---
Ok, but was more thinking the 9 points i have across heavy gunner and maybe looking at a swap to only 3 based on this. I usually run with a gatling gun, but will still be testing the waters out. 
---
My alt is working towards archer build, so will effect them a bit.
---
See uh, when I said I can't talk to them it's because I just don't like using my mic, at all. I want to communicate with people but I don't want to have to use my voice, and I shouldn't have to. Not having text chat is just ridiculous.
---
It‚Äôs so annoying having fusion cores with 1-5 left on them, I just scrap them at that point
---
Stylin' in the wasteland.  Damn that's a good combo.
---
I hadn't played the game since May and had never heard of the Legendary Run until the day I logged back in.  Sorry, I forgot to tune my ESP for those few months.
---
Cries in Rifleman :(
---
Maybe? American children are a fucking nightmare.
---
As for running sneak. As in the perk. I personally don‚Äôt but am bloodied with full uny armour, no sneak pieces and i stay undetected pretty much everywhere. Can pet mutant hounds and not come out of caution. If u mean running a sneak build then absolutely it‚Äôs necessary for the huge damage increase from covert operative and sandman
---
And I had never encountered the bug until today so I was not aware of any avoidance strategy.
---
One time I kept dying every 20 seconds after beating it 5 times in a row.
---
I was yelling at the screen. Next day I logged on and just had a dress on and no armour. So that was why.
---
Actually more upsides if you think about it. More XP and screws and ammo.
---
Cause I like em thicc
---
Or, ya know, 5 months...
---
Read: how to grief bloody builds.
---
Nope, I had computed exactly how many I needed and there were no atoms in the last ten. I wish I had had one more though lol
---
I use mine on every single ACP. Uny armour for the killing. Then looting the corpses and 10 seconds before the mine collapses switch so I don‚Äôt die in the storm. For me that‚Äôs the only real use for chinese stealth suit. Rad protection in the storm.
---
In my hands.
---
Silos, Green Country Lodge, Charleston Fire Dep, Monorail Elevator, Prison all have weights that give alot of lead. Charleston Fire Dep. has the most.
---
Uranium Fever can give atleast 1000 steel scrapping all the weapons with Scrapper.
---
Gunpowder csn be crafted with Acid and Cloth, both ressources are abundantly available. I have over 1k of it after crafting some ammo.
---
Well I had same armor on. All unyielding secret service armor except left leg was a chameleon marine armor piece. I am starting to think that he scaled down last night when I showed up and everyone left but idk. It was strange that‚Äôs why I asked
---
Having a story on the Interloper would be cool, but can we please keep Time Travel out of Fallout as a franchise please?
---
You won't get all of them to 15.  The Perk Coin cost to max even one card out is fairly high.  But, from the outset if you're high-level, you can easily add +1 to each SPECIAL if that's what you want.
---
The best use is, of course, to buff any lagging stat you wish you had more of, since if you go beyond 15, you don't get to assign more cards or anything.  I plan to take Follow Through and the Ammosmith-type perk, and populate the other four slots with SPECIAL depending on the character.  Maybe Take One for the Team as well.
---
To be fair if we're in a party without you were gonna go ha look at that low level but if your chill were just gonna give you tons of scrap we don't need and either you can stay or be on your way. No need to be scared of us. Im level 230 and I'm no stronger than a level 50 who had a very nice friend who gave him a bloodied handmade.
---
You're amazing
---
I mean, Daily Ops are (intended for) 4 player missions where you have to fight tons of tough enemies and complete objectives.
---
So you just gotta wait a week?
---
Where you in a group with a mutated player?
---
Stats might have been higher the first time allowing for more damage delt.
---
Or maybe being a private server the less lag somehow favored earl more than It had for you previously.
---
Rough day at the mine shaft?
---
&gt;and so modus sends out a signal for a enclave force to come and set up base
---
Incase you didn't get the memo MODUS isn't exactly in the best relationship with the Enclave. Just look at the Science division.
---
Unfortunately it's already in it. Pylon site V9?
---
I was in a group by myself both times. Idk it‚Äôs strange I‚Äôll just try again and see what happens
---
I'm level 563 and i gladly help any low level player when i can and i knows most of the other high level do so.  
---
As long as you are not annoying and you are not forcing, there is no reason things gone wrong, obviously there is some dumbass out there but if you come across one of them, just ignore them and make your way.  
---
Most of the high level player happily help low level when they can so don't be scared of us.
---
Unsure if curing one changes anything at all, but so long as it is a different server, it should work.  It's possible that you are just unlucky because each time you get irradiated, it's actually a low chance of become mutated.  You could essentially irradiate your entire health bar and not get a mutation (make sure you don't have the perk cards on while collecting rads).  
---
You should get them if you keep at, just make sure that if you have the mutation perk cards that they are off while irradiating and on when healing the rads.  
---
I'm sure others would tell you to just get the serums and they're right, it's faster and you remove the randomness of what you get, but it should still be possible to get mutations the way i said.
---
I usually place mine on the roof and he has to teleport away to find junk putting him a good deal out of ear shot for me so I don't have to listen to them the time. But the junk keeps getting to the box.
---
Had to just give up on having one at my camp tho, because I had too many things I wanted to be doing with my space that the collectron was eating up in budget.
---
I still take a lot of damage from my legacies but Fireproof and the Dense mod on my chest piece makes it so I rarely kill myself.
---
acid. i need lots of it, where could i find it?
---
Not to mention they tried to take MODUS offline entirely which left MODUS in the crippled state they're currently in.
---
Strange, you can be in a public group alone too to recieve benefits from herd mentality.
---
Stealth almost never holds around the boss. Even tried an extra stealth bobblehead that would have kept me hidden most of a SBQ fight and it still broke 90% of the time.  So don't count on a stealth multiplier.
---
Looks like I‚Äôm going full ultra
---
yes and what if we could call these player-made adventures 'mods', and have a place to access them all, some sort of 'nexus'
---
I'd better stop before 'they' realize what I'm suggesting
---
Why would a war happen? Neither the Enclave nor the BOS really have the resources to fight a war. The most that I feel would ever happen would be Enclave Agents scouting out areas and spying on the Brotherhood, just like they did in Appalachia with the Free States. At this point in time the majority of the Enclaves armed forces are at an off shore Oil Rig, those currently in Raven Rock are minimal with the Capital Wasteland itself still being a radioactive nightmare. They won't be leaving that particular bunker any time soon.
---
It's frustrating that Bethesda would prefer to have a buggy, broken game with no exploits, rather than a functioning one that can be exploited for irrelevant rewards.
---
They are events, they come back here and there. Harder to come back to a game that's been improved on alot from when you first purchased it? 
---
Seems like you just want to complain just because. It's hardly too late to start, ever.
---
I punish pricks like that by pretending to be a Bloodied melee build (loads of people will try and kill those just because they‚Äôre so easy to kill in PvP) and then switching to my BE laser to level their camp.
---
It sucks that happened but I'm impressed you did that much in a month
---
I mean they're giving us 50 perk coins right off the bat and I'm almost lv 350 with something like 130 cards to pick and they reduced the amount of per coins to make one out so maybe. I just wanna get perception, agility and luck to 15.
---
I know that‚Äôs why make a group but i was alone
---
Yes. It's so frustrating to have 11 shots left, only needing one more to kill the enemy and then it reloads.
---
Yes it absolutely does, i used it when i used legacies, you have no clue what you are talking about.
---
So even though you're obviously on reddit and see countless people including Bethesda themselves  promoting the legendary run and the bugs/glitches and solutions for them, you just didn't know? Thousands upon thousands of posts about the topic at hand and yet you weren't in the loop of massive amounts of info? What other excuse is there?
---
But, please, don't let them leap!
---
For once, I agree with you Enclave guys. Sure, I attempt to pick random fights every now and then, but if they don‚Äôt shoot back after about 20 seconds or so and/or they shoot me a ‚Äúno‚Äù emote or similar, I‚Äôll piss off.
---
67 2mm Ec. NOICE!
---
They are just rare drops. Not guaranteed
---
This.  The good news though is it also brought more players and all the long time players can just nuke low level areas if the low levels are being jerks - or just ignore them rather than help them as they‚Äôll probably be done playing in a day or 2.  Funny thing is I‚Äôve been playing about 6 weeks and I‚Äôm just now getting to end game stuff (level 50 but my build is needing reworked) and I get these level 10s attacking me when I‚Äôm afk and I‚Äôm like dude really, we aren‚Äôt playing CoD please go away gnat.
---
Just something about the wording and seeing ‚Äúfat man‚Äù vs ‚Äú Fat Man‚Äù looked funny to me
---
I would also like to know this man‚Äôs method. Even Nuka Cola Quantums don‚Äôt negate all the damage if I‚Äôm too close.
---
I like the idea of only investing 3 perks to a particular weapon build than 9.
---
If you capture a power plant workshop they typically have a fusion core maker near all the electric box looking stuff. When powered, you can then produce them like any other resource.
---
You get 2 for doing Line in the sand, you can craft them if you take a power station and check all the PA sets you come across..
---
Yes please!!
---
Suuuuure it does. Just for you and no one else. 
---
There are many posts and comments regarding how it doesn‚Äôt work. Go make a post stating that it works and watch how fast people comment on how you‚Äôre trolling.
---
Seriously! It's even more frustrating on my bloodied build.
---
They do, but legacies are so batshit crazy powerful you have to use other damage reduction perks too.
---
It doesn‚Äôt get any better.
---
Mid-40‚Äôs woman with the voice of a 12 year old boy here.
---
Until the patch hits, I'd go with the ffr and use the grenade for faster reload. Even once the patch is there, ffr might just save your bacon.
---
There‚Äôs a fusion core extractor at the Poseidon Energy Plant and it produces 3 fusion cores every 22.5 mins
---
And you can automatically produce fusion cores with 1 of every Flux (make sure you use Super Duper)
---
Imagine spending a legendary point on Master Infiltrator. Come on bro, nobody is gonna waste a point on that.
---
Wow amazing. Because I made a suggestion for the game I should stop playing. Your logic is fantastic. You guys are literally 2 IQ.
---
It'll probably just drive more people to private worlds....which I guess is good for BGS' bottom line.
---
Dont forget the Kill 3 Deathclaws that just happens to show up on the last day. Im old and fuzzy minded but I dont ever recall this challenge for a daily. another Middle finger
---
Go into your game settings and turn pacifist mode on. 
---
Then your attacks will not harm other players.
---
If you shoot someone without this mode on, they can retaliate and kill you. Once your pvp mode is activated they can find your camp and explode it. Spawn camp you, the works.
---
The game does not explain this well, so I tell this to any new players who ask.
---
Wife and I are getting maxed rep before we choose.  Raiders is easier so far.
---
It's going to make Ultracite that much more compelling.
---
I see... I think I understand.
---
I dropped another nuke since my last comment and solo‚Äôd Earl again... So you‚Äôre saying with this (What I thought was) shite armor piece basically turns any fast firing weapon I have into a magic weapon with insane damage as long as I play on my crap internet with 700 ping?
---
Loved that game so much, i dont understand why they never did another
---
I just wanna see them bring stuff from the older fallout games outfits and weapons skins and such
---
You can get max rep with both factions after you choose a side. However, be sure to not choose a side until you have gotten to the part where you have to choose a side with each first. This way you can unlock plans (ones that cost bullion) for both factions. P.S.  It takes a LONG time to reach max rep for both factions
---
Yesterday vs the queen. My gat plas tried to reload around 20, 30 times. This is awful.
---
Lag probably.
---
I had only heard of the bug from some article on Google weeks ago, and reddit certainly never highlighted a post about it here for me, though I don't doubt you're correct about that.
---
Why are you and others so adamantly defending a bugged system?  How does the fact that I started late have any relevance to the issue when it's clear I would have completed the Run if not for this bug happening today, of all days?  I mean, I'm good now, I paid my five bucks, ended up with less atoms than I would have, but got the stuff.  I was just highlighting the fact that it's pretty weak.  No more argument required on my end. :) I'm sorry that you don't agree.
---
I bet there are too many spawns &amp; too tight of an area to make it worthwhile.
---
I have experienced the opposite issue with my gatling plasma. Sometimes I'll fire to empty, try to reload, and instead does the firing action while still at 0. I have to put it away then bring it back out for the new core to actually register.
---
You woke up the Interloper! RUN!
---
I exit the game completely and relog.  It is way faster than if you hit "Find Another World".. because it usually puts you right back into the same one.
---
Yep pretty much.
---
But if you get shit frame rates along with shit internet things go south normally and you deal even less damage.  
---
Edit: if you have a shotgun handy go into vats and shoot any normal creature odds are you will one shot it.
---
üòÇ come on bruh
---
nope
---
Quite a bit.  I'd go insofar as to suggest that for content like Daily Ops and the bosses, Archer is simply not viable.
---
In PTS, there's a pretty wide disconnect between this content and the overworld though.  In the overworld, you seldom come across enemy swarms that overwhelm builds like Rifleman.
---
Preach
---
The claim stated by Matt is that with fireproof alone, explosive energy weapons do not remove health. 
---
I have a full set of unyielding sentinel ss armor, dense chest (have previously tried with fireproof in addition to dense), serendipity and dodgy. I shoot the ground with my explosive flamer or laser or plasma, I die.
---
I heard that once you choose a side you lose rep with the opposite one. And that if you betray the one you choose you also lose rep. Is this true? And yeah I‚Äôm already at the part where I have to choose for both. I just wanted to know if I could max out reputation before choosing.
---
If you are asking if you get a Bloodied Fixer when you reach the end of the run, then no.
---
Of course *you* would have that. üòÇ
---
PS4
---
Can we also fix the gauss pistol bug where it holds a charge and won't let you stim unless you holster/shoot it?
---
My first thoughtü§£
---
Thanks! I nailed down some quick strategies for certain types of challenges to make it easier, so I still had time to do some Wastelander content which I hadn't really gone through yet either.  But I haven't &gt;!raided the gold bullion vault!&lt; yet so I still have some to do.  I have characters ready to raid it for both Raiders and Settlers though!
---
Those that build near cliffs and I appear at the bottom of and have to hike to get to their vendors I dont mess with. If I have to go through that to see what‚Äôs being sold I‚Äôm just fast traveling out
---
Why is raiders easier? Do they have more quests?
---
I'm very curious to see if Energy Weapons are still nerfed into the ground when these release - I've heard bad things - and I have been enjoying my Quad Plasma Rifle quite a bit....but worst case, I go back to my Q2525 Handmades.
---
Yes. But it only buffs the 20% of the weapon damage that's explosive
---
That‚Äôs bullshit, it only negates 45% explosive damage. He‚Äôs talking out of his ass if he‚Äôs saying even a ballistic explosive weapon doesn‚Äôt drain his health with Fireproof alone.
---
waste of flux. Use the core makers at the powerplants or steal them from said workshops
---
What? No. Who the heck told you that
---
Maxxed it out today. See what you mean. Already have the PA buikd/repair cards.
---
That's just not true. You're having a Mandalla Effect moment
---
Yes, it's terrible.  On live, I can hit Earle for 700-1,200 damage.  On PTS?  It's double-digit damage.  Yes.  Double-digit.
---
In game chat is muted 24/7 for every game. Way too many people eat into their mics or having loud shit blasting with ZERO consideration of others having to listen to your bullshit. Really pisses me off when people use speakers an you have to listen to the same game audio twice.
---
When this happens to me, I use the gun bash to stop the animation and prevent leaving empty cores in my inventory. Hope this helps
---
I hope hope hope the Halloween event comes back!
---
I had no idea what I got a hold of... I got the piece off a mutant at west Tek and thought ‚ÄúEh better than the 1* urban scout left arm I had.‚Äù 
---
Kinda takes the wind out of my sails when soloing raid bosses since there‚Äôs a glitch helping me out with damage... But this will be very useful if I‚Äôm strapped for time and just want to grind stuff for drops, like say in a limited time event.
---
Thanks for the information. üëçüèª
---
Im sure we could find a balance. 3 min, 5 min. Just something to make these events more viable.
---
Cheaters cheat
---
Yeah, that happens quite a lot. I mute only if they are REALLY annoying, but I agree with you.
---
Literally nothing on the Legendary Run implies you get a bloodied fixer lmao.
---
They have two not counting any you find in the world. And you can also do the foundations missing equipment and choose to help the raiders. As far as I have seen, foundation has one job.
---
IIRC using chems you're addicted to suppreses the negative effects, but you still get the damage boost. So getting addicted to chems you use regularly is actually a good thing (suppress negative effects when using them, can't accidentally get addicted to something you're already addicted to)
---
Since some addictions have more extreme negative effects than others your best bet is to base your choice on which 5 least impact your build when all negative effects are active.
---
Thanks, that's pretty standard for a fixer build so it must be the Unyielding armor and low health etc. Nice.
---
I run sneak most of the time, but keep in mind that it will not be possible to use it in this particular Daily Op quest that's being added.
---
You can turn it back no problem
---
There is a possibility to lose rep for either faction but I only had that happen twice in my run. You don't lose rep for choosing one side over the other tho. It's usually based on your decisions in certain situations. You get the dailies before choosing a side so I suppose you can max the rep before actually choosing but I don't really see the need to do that but if that is something you want to do then sure.
---
I'd assume (though it will need testing) that the locks would auto-open, but the wanted issue would still be a thing.  Might make for a few extra 'oopsies' with people getting wanted accidentally, but if you're paying attention that shouldn't be an issue.
---
People can already unlock you stuff easily enough, if they want to deal with being wanted.  This wouldn't change anything other than the time it takes to do it.
---
OK. Just trying work out how I got it. Found it in my inventory
---
Oh no! What if someone takes my chickens‚Äô 10 fertilizer
---
This would definitely be a good addition I think. I'm pretty much a solo player most of the time, but occasionally being able to jump into a team and do stuff that's normally too hard for me has been fun. 
---
Honestly, if they wanted the players to be the npcs, they should have put this in game in the first place. Talking by mic or emotes only sucks too.
---
Yup. 
---
I think normal ballistic takes like 1 hp with fireproof for me. Not really noticeable if you have healing factor. I see my heathbar do the most minuscule jiggle. 
---
But still. Fireproof + explosive energy = death. Even with good armor and perks, shooting the ground will kill you in like 2 shots.
---
Nice.
---
I don‚Äôt bother to lock anything. What‚Äôs the point?
---
I'm high 400's and my hybrid build is the most fun to play.  I run 11,9,6,4,5,13,8 for all roles.  Plenty of room for food build cards and level 2 damage perks.  Lots of survivability.
---
Looking forward to Legendary perks so my food build can close the gap with the min/maxers even more.
---
You just found one? Lol
---
ditto, i start with 20 cores (full) and after an event i have 2 full and the rest have a charge of 2-20% use left. i only hit reload 3 times.
---
what. the. hell.
---
100% agreed
---
Dude.. you "Found" a Bloodied Fixer in your inventory?
---
Where'd you get the mechanist outfit? Atomshop?
---
From what I‚Äôve heard you have to get it from a diseased wendigo and not the air in ash heap!
---
Huh I didn‚Äôt know about this, do you know if it‚Äôs on PC?
---
You will be surprised how no one reads patch notes, no one check the website or ITV or no one uses PSA correctly. PSA you can place walls and then put wallpapers yea no shit
---
remember: every level 100+ once started as noobish lv1 ... most are fairly normal people, maybe with a bit to much spare time to push their levels this high ;)
---
Well season 2 should start soon with any luck you'll finish it easy
---
If you have a fancy shotgun or something I‚Äôd be down, but I actually use it and if it‚Äôs a legacy I‚Äôm not super interested in letting it go.
---
It‚Äôs the best when you‚Äôre in the middle of melting Earle...go from 15 cores to nothing in a flash
---
might have gotten it from a quest reward.  assuming you know the plan for it.
---
Alright thanks for all the answers :)
---
Nice.  that's a pretty rare drop and magic too.  Congrats!
---
If you have the Fixer plan learned, then they can drop from some events or you got it from the Purveyor maybe.   
---
This was in Patch 21:  
---
* Legendary Loot: Daily Quests and Events have had their legendary loot rewards updated to include additional items, like The Fixer, Secret Service Armor, and others, so long as you‚Äôve learned the Plans for them.
---
Happens to me on the gauss minigun , it tried reloading on 17 rounds then 3 when I have over 5k of the 2mm Ec
---
Oh, it‚Äôs getting fixed alright... a 70+ % damage nerf.
---
I hated this but it makes sense.  Having to switch over to a regular team to help someone with building something they need and don‚Äôt have plans for is a bit annoying but not the end of the world.  Completely understand where Maestro is coming from as even just puting a CAMP together for a couple hours it‚Äôs frustrating when something gets glitched and you have to reset the entire CAMP to fix it.
---
All that matters here man is just that we must avoid fucking up the lore. It's all i'm trying to say here. The thing is when these two factions encounter eachothers they eventualy went at war. It's all i meant. But the most important fact is they never knew the existence of eachothers before this drastic moment.
---
I heard if you dont wear a facemask youll catch the sludge lung,its been getting around these days
---
Yes, the glitch was on all platforms. Remember the workshop bug that allowed you to put random (and sometimes unobtainable mods) on weapons/armor? These nw weapons originate from the same bug.
---
Yeah that too
---
I love my camp, it‚Äôs my haven from the cold, cruel wasteland.
---
WHAT?!? There‚Äôs *yet another theft glitch?!?* Tell me in as much detail as you can how the fuck that works!
---
i¬¥m sure it would smell great if it had a nose...
---
If you're skeptical of the claims outlined in this post, please feel free to dm me on xbox or Reddit for photo evidence.
---
Is it? I‚Äôve gotten a few of them but never the revolver. I assumed that one was harder to get.
---
I have one of these. It‚Äôs nice.
---
True enough! So how do I find one now? Player vendor/trade? And how do I identify them; by the low level and relative high damage?
---
I net quite a lot of acid from Colossal Problem tagging all the wendigos.
---
Only the crappy players dont.
---
We did restore his link to the Kovac-Muldoon...but that link was destroyed in the military uprising just before MODUS killed everyone.  At that time he was still unable to connect to the Enclave.  This is because Eckhart sabotaged the links (cut the hard lines it says) so that he would be the highest ranking still living person and thus the leader.
---
A lot of bloodied players running to deposit flux before they get murdered by mobs
---
And then add in Super Duper
---
ill just be the lonely under leveled 225 whose a Junkie build with full health helping out in the background not dying every 5 mins üòÖ
---
Oh yeah, I'll certainly have it wiped out quickly. :)
---
Finally got a great ultracite gatling laser yesterday and immediately had to put it away because of this bug. Freaking useless given how slow the reload is normally.
---
Fak em.
---
It's worth noting that you're perfectly safe in a workshop so long as you don't contest it.  And leaving pacifist mode on at all times is just a good idea in general so you don't accidentally initiate pvp with a stray bullet or molotov.
---
For those unsure what contesting means, don't touch the big red workshop bench and don't attempt to enter build mode.  Beyond that, don't mess with locked objects in the build area. 
---
Killing enemies and looting world objects won't trigger pvp.
---
still happens on xbone
---
This. I carry the stealth suit for when the event ends. I put it on and keep picking up loot until the mine collapse.
---
I tried several times with diseased spawn in wendigo cave, and it never worked. I tried just once at queen spawn in North East corner of the mire, and got it first time.
---
how much on average would you say?
---
Oh my god this is the first legendary perk I‚Äôm taking
---
There really isn't anything you can do to screw up an event other than starting it too early before enough people show up.
---
What I‚Äôve been seeing is my clip will get to zero then shoot back up to 14 or 15 which takes away from my ammo inventory and then it will reload up to 25. Essentially using 40 rounds per clip for 25 actual shots. This magic number it bounces back up to is taking away from my ammo count in my inventory. Does it both on handmade and fixer primarily when using vats. I‚Äôm not 100% sure if it‚Äôs doing it when using free aim.
---
Ive had it spawn me right outside the mine after he dies. I just wait two minutes and I still get the rewards.
---
In the past few weeks they seem to have proliferated. I don't believe I have been to an earl or SBQ recently that doesn't have at least 1 players with the beam splitter 50 cal.
---
It is bugged there is no doubt about that but I'm not going to complain about it because I've known what I was in for. Also you could've just done the repeatable challenge (I know for a fact those don't auto complete) and gotten your levels for the day instead of paying. But please enjoy your day and your pitty party :)
---
MODUS is a very smart AI but he is a) very damaged and rebuilding himself somewhat on the fly with whatever he can find and b) was designed to be an assistant to the Enclave leadership rather than act on his own.
---
Of course, the damage may have allowed him some free will as he certainly exercised his initiative when he killed every human in the bunker, including Eckhart who he technically should have been answerable to, when it suited him.
---
So it's unclear what exactly he knows and what he might choose to do about it should he find out.
---
One thing is clear though: a working prewar government AI would draw the BOS like ants to a picnic.  I think MODUS would, probably with good reason, see that as a VERY threatening situation.  Given that he has access to an orbital strike system and at least one friend who can launch nuclear weapons, I don't think much of the BOS' chances...
---
I would hope that the species specific legendaries stay as multiplicative with everything rather than additive.
---
I feel you. I got my gf into playing and we pal around together alot and she hates playing without me bc low levels come to her camp and destroy it when they find out she doesnt have free stuff in a vendor.  She doesnt even use that system. About 3 logins with this happening and she got her own fo1st account. Bgs, they won... no one else.
---
i got 3 out of 42 tickets and 2 out of 20 tickets. Traded one for 500 flux which is WAYYYYY more than it's worth.
---
OK. I do have the plans.
---
So I got it either from Bots on parade or from Guided meditation. I have a habit of not reading the rewards you get from events
---
Me and my Dad used to play Halo together! That was awesome! Bet you‚Äôre having a blast!
---
So both sides must have their external communications crippled beyond repair with no way to replace them (for the Enclave that‚Äôs piss easy - the advanced schematics for the comms were erased from MODUS‚Äôs data banks before Vault 76 opened, but I‚Äôm not sure how we can spin it for the Brotherhood of Steel. Maybe they‚Äôd require parts you can‚Äôt get anywhere else?
---
Capitalism
---
This is not what I‚Äôm seeing that magic number it bounces back up to takes away from your ammo inventory then the reload animation happens taking another 25 rounds from your ammo inventory essentially taking 40ish rounds for 25 shots.
---
There‚Äôs a revolver too?
---
I do wish some of the people that have these things would be more judicious about when to use them.
---
it's a 15% chance so keep scrapping

Wow that really bad.. I gotta look closer next time to see if it's actually happens to me too.. But yeah I use vats only almost and it's mostly happening then.. Didn't think of that before but vats has always been broken..
---
I have been doing the repeatable challenge.  It's a big part of why I got so close.  I asked for no pity.
---
I agree but it is worth mentioning that it's another 150 years until Fallout 3.  That's enough time for the fog of history to get pretty murky even in cultures with decent communication and continuity.  The records of the Scorched Plague, the Appalachian Enclave and the final Zetan invasion my all be buried in some lost BOS bunker in California for all we know :(
---
Until there is a mass drop off of users and they see less and less people buy their 15$ skin packages, only then will they put some serious effort into fixing their game. That's the plain truth
---
Bloodieds do die a lot in that event but without a few bloodieds your success rate drops. Also, bloodied builds saves everyone else ammo. Whats a few stims to keep them shooting?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
my opinion:
---
ppl nowadays want to kill enemy like Colossus, Project Paradise or SBQ within the shortest time possible. NO MATTER if anyone hit the enemy for loot or not.
---
In the beginning most ppl care for eachothers... also they used the time limit until last minutes to farm the spawning horde which comes with the FakeSheep or else.
---
it was a success to kill SBQ as a team. but today ppl can kill SBQ with only two strong players.
---
i often see thumbs down in most events
---
also i see ppl grinding the big tree ;) for incredible amount of flux material because of the glitched ore up there or the event Line in the sand.... THIS is what happend to a big part of the community.
---
selfish, only focused on reaching a higher level... get the most OP equipment etc.
---
buy also a big amount of players are nice and teamplayers... but slowly dying.
---
Leave your stuff unlocked, occasionally you will come back to it empty but more often then not it‚Äôs full, and it‚Äôs nice to have camp visitors have something for their travels, the majority won‚Äôt touch it anyway
---
Yup. I‚Äôve gotten three shotguns and no revolver has dropped yet. 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fancy_single_action_revolver
---
I‚Äôd be more than happy to give people my extra legendary weapons in exchange for them farming steel and lead for me
---
Eh. It could be worse. It could be ark.
---
Unless it was unstable and they have to can it, I don't see why they wouldn't bring it back for this year. I was not playing last year with Mischief Night so I really want to try it out this year. It was not on the roadmap but neither was the Mole Miner Treasure Hunt coming back on the PTS so they can always add in content without announcing until right before it happens.
---
Ran 3 SBQs earlier and had a few people do it on PC.
---
Thanks a lot, I'll be sure to check there next time!
---
Even as a raider I give thumbs up and such. I can still love out there. I'm not a damn blood eagle!
---
That's a heck of a drop from either of those events. Congrats
---
 I keep having this problem but I also keep getting stuck in iron sights but unable to fire and I have to bring up map to cancel it out lol.
---
Aye, it was one of my concerns about the whole "rebuild America" angle.  I mean we know, from 150 years in the future, that nothing really came of it.  The FO3 DLC mentioned "Ronto" (presumably the ruins of Toronto) but certainly didn't mention Appalachia.  Elder Lyons was as surprised as anyone to see the Enclave on the east coast.  Heck, even the Enclave itself was surprised to hear from President Eden's base at Raven Rock.
---
Not just Bethesda either, F team skeleton crew Bethesda.
---
Huh I don't remember that being a rule. Do I get more rewards for using emotes?
---
*slaps you with a shovel*
---
You‚Äôre a Raider! Stop helping people and make their lives hell!
---
Not a veteran player, but soon to be new player lol (on PC). Trust me, I think I'll be missing out in a lot but I'm kind of excited. Been following this subreddit for a while and I think it's time i finally pick the game up.
---
Damn, think about all that Gold Bullion you're missing out on while you grind the rep!
---
Got it thank! 
---
Did you purchase the game via steam or through the Bethesda launcher? Wondering if there's a difference or not other than Bethesda launcher vs steam launcher
---
My camp is simple and fonctionnal, you just can't lose yourself... 
---
My Armory is right in front the entrance...
---
( a 1minute video: https://youtu.be/ug3b0gr-oI4 )
---
But yea, there's alot of players who don't seem to really care about their camp or just suck at camp building. I'm telling you...instanced interiors will not be for the average player...it's clearly an attempt from Bethesda to bring the fallout 4 camp building communities to Fallout 76.
---
Most players do not not seem to really care about their camp.
---
As long as people come back, that's cool.
---
While their living, human forces are not present, MODUS has direct call on a satellite with orbital strike capability and knows at least one guy with access to launch a more or less endless supply of nuclear missiles.  If MODUS took a flight of fancy, he could reduce just about anyone in the region to a burn smear in short order.
---
Further, we know that MODUS is repurposing local bots to expand his forces.  Imagine how far it could go if he managed to get his tendrils into the automated robot fabrication systems in one of the local missile silos.
---
"Food build" is an umbrella term for unoptimized, QOL builds.
---
Truth is, all good PVP players are using food buffs on top of their competent build.
---
They're not mutually exclusive.
---
Good With Salt, White Knight, Science and Perceptibobble are all examples of food build perks. It is anything that isn't designed for combat.
---
How is Green Thumb helping you at ACP, exactly?
---
I mean this one is just a Murmurgh discount.
---
But at the same time I don‚Äôt actually expect them to fail it.
---
yes there are revolvers. 1star but can be each effect afaik.
---
i got a bloodied fancy revolver out of 444 tickets... few surpressor revolver but more shotguns.
---
shotguns are like 2x more available. :)
---
Man, why don't people like me blasting enclave radio(earrape) in my mic? :( smh kids these days
---
You can tame most smaller non "boss" creatures. This ranges from cats, mongrels, wolves, rats, brahmin, and radstags. To some more interesting ones like yao guai, megasloths, deathclaws, snallygaster, and mirelurk kings. Keep in mind that tameable pets will be fairly low level (I think the highest level pet is the mirelurk king at lvl35) and they just sit around your camp. 
---
[Use this map](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/d/d7/Mappalachia_random_encounters.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190626174620]) to find where tameable can spawn, any red dot has a chance of spawning a tameable random encounter which should be a non aggressive animal that you can tame when you walk up to it. The level of the area you are in does seem to affect the pets that can spawn, for example you get lower level ones like brahmin and radrat in the forest but deathclaws and other higher level pets are added to the pool in the mire and cranberry bog. 
---
Personally I use the one above abby's bunker or sunset field since I usually am looking for deathclaws.
---
It's a grind but it makes it so we don't have to start over and get so far. We can wait.
---
Thats really nice i like the structure of the home, especially the second-floor attachment supported by pillars. well done!
---
And further i think it enriches your game experience and gives you more enjoyment. the ambient music playing while you walked in and ur companion humming was a beautiful moment that u had a hand in making. I‚Äôm sure you feel a lot better resting in that cozy home than some of these players living in a box fort next to the wayward at level 300. Good for the mind and soul.
---
I half agree with you here. I think it‚Äôs important to add a bit of personality into your camp, but some people just have no clue what they‚Äôre doing and end up using up all their budget on decorations with no order or pattern to them. When you walk into my front door (which is front and center as soon as you spawn in like it should be) the first things you see are my vendors, one in front, and then one on each side of a wall that I built around my fusion generator. Then to the right is a room with all my crafting tables, and to the left is a room with all my crops. Then around each side of that wall I mentioned I built a staircase, leading up to the bedroom. Inside is my bed, a desk and chair, two couches and coffee tables, a piano, and a Wendigo colossus skin rug.
---
My Tesla reloads with anywhere from 2-7 rounds left.
---
The cursed items are 40script that weights little . That is all their for .
---
Enjoy it ! I have an entire room overflowing with red dresses and cowboy costumes but have never gotten either the shotgun or revolver.
---
And lead pipes, ski swords, wrenches, pool cues, don‚Äôt forget them
---
If you‚Äôre playing with mouse and keyboard, caps lock is your push to talk. If you‚Äôre using a controller there‚Äôs no PTT and you‚Äôll need to switch the microphone mode in your sound settings
---
That only works on the base amount.
---
Thank you man ! ‚úå
---
I tried CSS with Earle but I fell back to my usual 4x Unyielding +1x Chameleon is much better (even just 1x Cham + good randoms is worth it). 
---
There's no radiation, you'll have better damage resistances, better AP management for spotting and killing the spawns, less chance of going overweight.
---
If you're not looking for pity, then why make this post? You could of just kept playing the game and not made this post complaining, like so many others have. You obviously knew how to correct your own problem. You bought the last few spots and was doing the repeatable beforehand. If you wanna continue to justify it, feel free but Im ending my part here.
---
Don't know why you're getting downvoted. The game is objectively trash and Wastelanders kinda cemented the future to be like that too, what with the lazy NPCs and story. It's a fun game, but that doesn't make it necessarily good. It's the Sonic 06 of Fallout where yeah it's terrible, but it's fun when you don't take it seriously.
---
Community hard carries this game and the developers got extremely lucky that they were able to develop a wholesome and tight-knit community with ridiculously low standards.
---
Out of about 150 tickets, I've only gotten one.
---
Ey, if the textures look bad it's cuz they aren't loading in, which could be internet or harddrive problems
---
One note on the blood eagle laser, those did drop at other levels as well and aren't all level 45. I've got a level 5 version from that raider camp near the top of the map in the forest The Crosshair. It has the 300 range of the blood eagle ones, but is no where near the power of the glitched NW ones.
---
Peep I edited the comment
---
This is a problem with the Gaitling Plasma as well when your down to three or two plasma cores. Really annoying but it‚Äôs been in the game for awhile nowü§î
---
it does lol
---
I can confirm stings and things sometimes gives you badges
---
I don't see any reason to be mad about getting free stuff, but you do you lol
---
Thank you! Literally half of this sub is posts complaining about bugs/glitches, and then run to Bethesda‚Äôs defence at the slightest criticism
---
That sounds nice just for not having to carry around disease cures anymore. How often can it be used?
---
I feel you. I‚Äôm not terribly low level anymore - just incredibly shy  - I want to make friends in the game but I‚Äôve also never played an online game prior to this so any time I‚Äôm at an event and someone sends me a team request I suddenly forget every social skill I have.
---
Do not craft them.
---
It's not just energy gatlings, either. My Fixer and Radium do this all the time. It's probably something to do with the automatic weapon type.
---
Also, it looks like a lot of the comments say it happens during big shootouts, so the bug is probably linked to something like frame rate or server load. Could be attempting to register the bullets being fired, but can't keep up with all the mobs so it just says "this bitch empty"?
---
I see, I play with a controller, that's why I couldn't find a key to turn on the mic!
---
You still need to activate. You will still get the red text.
---
This does not automatically unlock containers around you, which is what you seem to be implying.
---
Unlocking containers is not griefing. What the actual fuck
---
All the perk does it let you skip the mini game once every few minutes
---
My friends and I play on PC, but we chat through Discord. I think a couple of them have in-game push-to-talk set up, but the rest of us have in-game chat disabled. Discord works so much better.
---
I was pointing out my distaste to Bethesda.  You're a funny person.
---
Ash heap is low level? I had a camp in the ash heap for ages on a previous character, and once every few logins, there‚Äôs be 1-2 level 50 scorchbeasts flying around, often attacking my camp
---
So what you can do to solve this, just hear me out here. 
---
As a level 300+ player I am here to inform, and assist. 
---
Your local hardware store, you're going to need to go down and purchase some "Pre-Mix" bagged concrete powder. 
---
Bring it home, into the kitchen preferably, once you have your Pre-Mix powder and a kitchen side by side, you'll want a drinking glass, now you're going to want to take EXACTLY one teaspoon of the Pre-Mix, pour it into the glass, fill the rest of the glass with water, stir for approximately 1 minute. 
---
Don't be shy, stir it really well, now once a minute has passed and your mixture is somewhat of a creamy texture you're going to want to drink it all, and harden the F\*\*\* up! 
---
Of course I'm joking. 
---
This is what we here in Australia call humour. 
---
In all seriousness though, just loosen up a little and remember the Fallout community is mainly helpful, forgiving and extremely patient.
---
I once had a Neighbour (Someone who had a CAMP downstream of mine) patiently wait at my CAMP inside my diner, acting as if he were drinking until I got back from being AFK on my bed, he then emoted to follow him and the entire time he just wanted to show me his little stream hut which was built not far from my Dam. 
---
What's the worst that could happen? At worst you might meet a salty snowflake who's just out to harass people, in which case you could just block them. 
---
Most the folk in this game are more than willing to not only help, but patiently work with others. 
---
In the wise words of my Enclave leaders, "God Bless America".
---
I don't agree with op at all but what kind of stupid argument is that
---
No problem! I use a controller, too. I‚Äôve got a steel series headset I use for my microphone that has a button on it to turn the microphone on and off, and it‚Äôs probably my favorite feature since I can‚Äôt map PTT onto my controller.
---
It does
---
Today I crashed 3 times on Xbox One X. Occasionally I get en error code but lately just a black screen and the back at my home screen.
---
The blood eagle laser is a nw laser, just not the scoped. The blood eagle laser has higher damage but a slower fire rate, compared to a regular laser. Did you get the assault rifle, as well?
---
200+
---
Agreed, I had 4 full fusion cores. When it drained the non-full ones and reloaded my gatling laser gun, I only had 15 round remaining. Kept on reloading and it still said 15 rounds remaining.
---
Fix this shit, Bethesda.
---
Little caesars
---
No it was a bonus for purchasing atoms from Bethesda. More limited then the atom shop.
---
It‚Äôd be like a Scorchbeast attack - but worse! With way, way more rads! And pain for melee builds!
---
I say this as a melee build. Bring the pain!
---
I always feel like it happens more at the seasonal stuff....parade and such.  When you have run 200 queens it just going thru the motions.  Off to grind the next digital must haves.
---
ok well then. im probably going to be doing that
---
Bad idea
---
You're all g dude. Just as many high levels mess up events or one shot legendarys. Most people do want to help though. Just be cautious for people who are too nice, or people who may just wanting to scam an item. Do you turn on Pacifist mode? It won't prevent every PVP scenario but then you won't have to worry about some bored high level turning around and steam rolling you just because they saw you accidentally shoot them. At the end of the day though all you lose on death is some Junk. If someone pops up at your camp just give them a wave emoji, or go into a photo mode pose behind them while they're in your vendor. Also, with current exploits going around and greifers I myself have anxiety if I'm not at my base when high levels show up. Much love for your honesty, let's hope One Wasteland brings more Vault Dwellers together.
---
I‚Äôm Double 00 D on Xbox. We can hook up.
---
Edit: put it in my vending machine. 5k. We can connect and I‚Äôll take you to it.
---
The Halloween event is hands down the best event in the game!
---
press F to pay respects, in memory of the ammo market.
---
I salute you! I think I was far too eager, HeHe. Enjoy it out there!!
---
No, they fixed the formula. It once again outperforms 1h and 2h.
---
Ok. Good luck with that.
---
I just meant it's not the real glitched NW Laser that people want to trade huge value for. Those super powerful ones were never available without the glitch I believe (heard stories that one quest did award them at some time, but was never sure if that was just a smokescreen to hide people's exploits).
---
I've got 2 of each for both the max level blood eagle assault rifle and laser, but the only low level one I kept was the level 5 laser. Not sure how low the assault rifles would have even leveled down anyway.
---
I still do it if its with low level players, but if its an event full of L100+ then why make a deal out of something that should be an easy pass anyway (an exception if maybe just me plus 1 or 2). Doing it Every time for Every thing makes it pretty meaningless - much like  players who do the 'help me' emote when in no danger - Cry Wolf much?
---
Just please don't be THAT guy who only kills the wendigos
---
Other than that, enjoy yourself \^\^
---
Think you missed it, rip
---
&gt; And that if you betray the one you choose you also lose rep. Is this true? 
---
I had heard that one as well, but I just finally got around to completing it last night and I did *not* lose any reputation for keeping all 1000 gold.
---
Correct. Value of the items you already own should be subtracted.
---
The assault rifles level down to lvl 30, and can be modded to weigh nothing.
---
I wish there was a "you're did it" emote for people like these.
---
*slaps you with a sledgehammer that has the rocket mod*
---
 Hush. I'm the raider queen but I also don't believe in meaningless sacrifice, brotherhood scum.  ;)
---
I have my camp companion wearing the outfit and the captain cosmos helmet . Very suiting , helps the headaches .
---
Nice nice nice!! Congrats! I've only rolled an exterminators revolver. Beautiful trash.
---
There are still plenty of decent people playing. A lot of us are just tired of all the people that ruin events and Bethesda not doing anything to fix all the magic and hacked weapons.
---
Or at least just a lock button that prevents us from dropping or selling. 
---
But yes good idea OP
---
Keep in mind that a lot of these interactions are made up for reddit karma
---
Many of the lower level people you encounter are higher level players playing alternate characters.
---
Ouch! *drinks a Nuka Cola Quantum and unloads full BE laser mag into you*

Ad Victorium! You shouldn‚Äôt have initiated PvP!

I've gotten 3 at Awol before.
---
The most I've ever gotten was 6-7 at radiation rumble.
---
I think you just meet bad bloodied players
---
I usually end up with 100-150 and that is just clearing them off others or when they aggro me.
---
If you have friends that you always play with, I would recommend having this on separate character.
---
You'll need to be around level ~104~115 to have enough perk cards accumulated to get one legendary perk fully ranked up.
---
I was waiting for the pizza joke.
---
No you're not safe. I've killed people that haven't contested by having a friend (not on my team) tap the workshop while other people are within workshop boundaries.
---
Better have Fireproof on too as you can damage yourself at close range.üòÄ
---
Man, add me, I like to use the mike to fuck around with people (in a good way).  But I'm almost always talking alone, it would be nice to have someone in my server with a mic too. Dm me for user :)
---
Considering the situation and your downvotes others tend to disagree with you. Keep telling yourself that. Nice unoriginal name as well
---
*sneaks back in with a Stealth Boy M3 and a few dozen quantums before I tap your ass with a FFR handmade* Fucking bet. üòà

I have an Assassins FFR handmade if you're interested?

---
Ps4
---
It‚Äôs really stupid there isn‚Äôt any social system in this game that was designed to be player driven. Hell we still don‚Äôt have a text chat.
---
You want more modes that either split the tiny playerbase or is left dead? (pun intended)
---
I'd like if instead it was a huge horde of scorched that were reskinned as zombies and if they chanted, "Brain bombs"
---
Yea I‚Äôm trying to find the lie.
---
*Casually tanks it because of my ass/sent armor, Dodgy, Serendipity, Born Survivor and pops a Berry Mentats, then proceeds to activate my own MkIII SB*

I got it on my first claim ticket üòé and today I got the Western Cowboy Chaps - looks good on commander Deguerra with the sheepsquatch impostor helmet and white sunglasses.
---
Almost every time I do "Feed the People" people do it regardless of level.    
---
Enjoy the game, do it, and if someone gets upset that's their problem.
---
thanks man, i actually got one of those for close range pvp :p
---
I'm kinda wondering if Bethesda isn't planning to give us a lil more precision in a futur Fallout 5, concerning the Vault 76. 
---
I mean i'm pretty sure we gonna have an other Fallout game, it's just not the same experience and it would be an opportunity to bring Fallout in the next gen consoles era.
---
But beside that, i think we gonna have to wait until we know what type of presence we gonna have from he Brotherhood Steel, next week, before jumping to possible conclusions. It still seems that they can send radio signal toward the Appalachia from what we can tell.
---
Again, nevertheless, whatever happens, it seems that we must all die in the Appalachia,, from what i understand. 
---
Anyway, i can't wait to see what the BoS will have to say when they see us playing with nukes...
---
There‚Äôs a revolver? Damn and I dropped 90 pleasant tickets the other day and I still haven‚Äôt gotten the shotgun
---
I suppose you could just continue leveling the character anyway, or start from scratch and speedrun the game as much as possible. To take all that time tho takes you out of it, but if I were you I'd maybe uninstall and reinstall the game too before going at it again
---
I have assassin sentinel AP refresh leather armor, Serendipity, and Born Survivor. üòá
---
Np mate
---
Incorrect. They don't always spawn in the same place.
---
I also can't clear sludge lung on any character that I catch it on.
---
I just loaded up an old mothman cultist character I had but not played since before wastelanders, pretty proud of my big church for it. Upon loading i noticed that just within my camp limits is a small mothman shrine that always spawns worshiping cultists and an occasional, fairly common mothman, RIGHT OUTSIDE MY CHURCH! 
---
Now I dont believe in signs but....praise Mothman!
---
Good anti Tesla build. But if you‚Äôre caught not standing still you‚Äôll get raped by a good legacy with the right build,
---
I‚Äôm also pretty sure stagger stops the sentinel part from working.
---
Is it magic because of the 15% damage armor piece, like my other shotgun?? I know it cripples but did not know about the one shot power...
---
Today I found a fancy shotgun in a vendor for 2k caps. Couldn't resist :) I guess this thing can be pretty viable after the next update.
---
Always gets a chuckle
---
Damn,  I would really appreciate the same help, but only for the revive an ally.  Just started the game a month ago so Im a little behind, lol. OP if once you've gotten it accomplished you wouldn't mind a quick second of assistance it would be super appreciated. GT: Jmill79
---
Yeah, but the community at large doesn't want it unfortunately. They voiced that clearly at launch. Which is a shame.
---
So now you dont even have the one?
---
I've used the suit every time I've done ACP and it's gone fine, but I'm not using melee. Presumably being ranged helped me keep in sneak.
---
I have both consoles.  So far ps4 people have been very good.  Its relative to both consoles.
---
Maybe a decent railway rifle
---
I do it when everyone "shares" the legendaries. Not so much when they get one shot or not "pointed out". I do the follow me when I see one, hit it one time and back up a bit for others in the area not on my team to also get a shot in.
---
Is it good again?
---
I'm saving my script for this as well.
---
yes
---
I could see ZAX doing this as a way to change up the testing (probably when someone points out that merely killing everyone else is not a good way to pick a leader due to other attributes being important).
---
You‚Äôd be placed in an eye of the storm that has shrunk down to the final ring size, protected by a heavily modified version of the fog condensers of Harpers Ferry. The ring would slowly expanded, and creatures of all grades would come rushing into the ring to destroy the machine (and the players). Everyone starts off with basic weapons they‚Äôre set up for (based on selected perks at the get go, possibly the same ones as nuclear winter), and as the ring expands, loot crates and more condensers come online for the player to protect.
---
Depending on where the location is, a different final boss would show up to fight the players.
---
are we the dummies?
---
Don't pay full price, it is DEFINITELY not worth $30. It went on sale for $20 and I got it then and still don't think it was worth it. 
---
The outfits are nice, Raider is superior and the mask is very versatile. The power armors look sick and make for good combo pieces, if you're into that. The plots themselves are about shoulder height but nice for functionable decor. The other items such as the stash box and flag are pretty neat. Nothing spectacular there.
---
I‚Äôve run the event with it when I‚Äôm low on ammo (I swap between a heavy weapon build and a stealth melee build), and I‚Äôm essentially invisible to everything except what I‚Äôm attacking. 
---
Run it about 15 times, prefer to do it heavy weapon as it‚Äôs more helpful to the team but the stealth is fine and arguably as effective against the spawns
---
Added dude ill inv u :)
---
One shotting every has gotten old. Obviously not everyone is. But one tamerial was wicked I personally rather enemies like deathclaw be hard again
---
Can you still grab them all at Robco?
---
Sounds like you lost a good weapon to poor choices. RIP though, that's rough.
---
Me and my buddies will role play in 76 and when this happens to me I usually blast off "my damn gun jammed!"
---
I agree though, fixing it would be nice!
---
You missed it.
---
Thanks for that.
---
I use heavy weapons.Sometimes it is impossible to reload.
---
Today A high level and me on PS4 must have had 80 Wendigo Spawn.
---
We failed by a Whisker.
---
Interesting.
---
So caution doesnt trigger covert ops?
---
Its going to be great for the ultracite ammo for heavy weapons.
---
Oh jeez that's pretty scary ngl
---
You can't switch forest to urban.
---
With ultracite ammo it'll be even better
---
You'd have to transfer so many materials so often, honestly not worth it.
---
You can absolutly switch urban to Forest than back to urban. I do it all the time
---
Yeah that was my first thought tbh.
---
I have a bloodied level 45 Pole Hook,i might give that a go.
---
Heavy weapons are alright when you get enough time to fire them.
---
That's the best part
---
The reward is less iirc, either fewer caps or fewer scrips, I forgot which. It‚Äôs only a minute or two of work to find all three, might as well get them all just in case.
---
Like 95% of the time
---
Yep, it is always higher levels that I see doing the harassing. I've never seen low levels do it and especially not when I offer them supplies or help. I've had level 150+ players group up and follow me around just shooting and hitting me hoping I'll attack back so they can take my junk or just cause they want to kill me for some reason. Toxicity is everywhere though so I'm not surprised
---
yeah, you got Quad?
---
Or other players
---
Legit would nice if they quietly added in a event with it. All while completely feigning that it exists
---
You simply will get it faster unless you rank it up first, which would be quite a terrible choice for first legendary perk card.
---
115 levels on new character is a lot faster to get than 84 levels when you're at level 400
---
I have noticed a lot dont bother with any power armour.
---
And they seem to die less.
---
I am unyielding x 4 + I Chameleon.
---
Can they still drop ?
---
This is ammo in general, my fixer tries to auto reload at like 11 rnds in the mag
---
If I'm level ~ 900 I don't care.  I'll rank up all the cards at the same time.
---
Definitely not game passes fault. I only play because it's on game pass and I'm not willing to pay for a buggy game, but I happily help lower level players with supplies or assistance and enjoy the social aspects. So no, game pass isnt to blame. Toxic people are.
---
The 15th at 8:03 est...." so I just logged on but all of my challenges except nw one are done,  is this a bug anyone else have this"  It is a shitty bug but to take up (made up number) 40 percent of all posts is a.bit much
---
Comparing internet problems to hard drive problems for graphic rendering?... yes, they both transfer information, but are at different levels.
---
Sadly no
---
I actually posted about this not to long ago. It happened with all my weapons. I was mid fight with a mirelurk queen and had to switch to melee.
---
I made my base right on a death claw spawn. Everytime I spawn or fast travel when no ones been around. a high level will spawns
---
im not gonna focus on then, im just gonna horde them up mini nuke them. then attack the colossus
---
Brace yourself for all the "did i miss the first season? Is it too late to finish? Can I still claim my rewards?" posts.
---
Yeah quad +vats
---
Yeah, it's not hard to survive as a bloodied build.
---
It does suck, I bought the contemporary floors and wallpaper  seperate but want the porch so bad, but ya noooot included
---
I'd like to see a datamine on earl just to be safe.
---
While queen has been known not to scale for a long time (I saved the datamine on it)  I duo'ed earl as a non-stealth rifleman and a heavy gunner blasting away with a .50 (neither bloodied) with roughly a +2 minute time compared to a team of 8.
---
That said the above is just personal experience, and I would like to reinforce the point that I would like to see a data mine on either side of where it falls because info is always nice.
---
It‚Äôs gonna be wild on the 15th between that and the damage nerf. And, you know, whatever wild bug patch 22 introduces. I‚Äôm hoping for every ranged weapon always drops with bash damage to really get the sub angry.
---
Why?  You can do all this with regular food water and chems.  Waste of a perk
---
Oh tomorrow will be lit
---
how many caps/flux, also i got colossus head, plushie, and rug plans too
---
No you don't.
---
https://ibb.co/8X6LSvY
---
I think there is some confusion on the terms and what they mean. Not just here, but throughout. 
---
I think once we get the perk loadouts, it will be much less difficult on people to truly optimize in and out of the main battle spaces. I have a lot of QOL cards that i sometimes forget to swap out, but having the loadoit would make it where i have my walking about loadout, the in my camp loadout, and lastly my kill everything that moves loadout.
---
It‚Äôs all RNG based, you have 1/12 chance to instantly travel.
---
It‚Äôs not that high either
---
Can't wait ü§£ü§£
---
It's the exact opposite of this.  Legendary perks will give you more perk points, more to invest in other stuff.
---
I rember the mumbles sales where it only dropped limb damage on melee weapons.  The rage of this place was pretty epic.
---
Everything stays disabled, first one back to the bar wins
---
on the scale of 1 to 10, how much is this post depressed?
---
That is what i was thinking.
---
If i can configure the build to 1 shot kill the Wendig spawnso then i might be in with a chance.
---
I think those that insta-kill Earle in seconds get in quick before the Wendigos start spawning. They are a serious nuisance.
---
Had a horrible time today with a heavy Weapon.Just me and another high level were doing the event,Just dozens of Spawns more than usual.Making the Heavy weapon practically useless.It was this that got me thinking about Melee weapons.
---
Agreed, would be great. I will say that I just now did an Earle fight in a public server. I rushed down first to try to get a mag off in stealth to test this. First mag, HP melted down to about 75%. As I reloaded, guy in PA showed up and started firing. When I started shooting my second mag, the exact same damage was showing on-screen, but this time his health barely moved for me.
---
Mad? Lol, no.
---
&gt; I mean, Daily Ops are (intended for) 4 player missions where you have to fight tons of tough enemies and complete objectives.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; So you just gotta wait a week?
---
No, like a true horde;  where you build some defenses, bunker down - and don't know until the last wave if you'll make it or not.
---
This - is roughly what horde would look like...
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtE3ue3hBhE&amp;ab_channel=TheBandWagon
---
Almost always it spawns there, it's a good bet to camp there for it.
---
Damn...I was unaware of that loophole.
---
Guess I'll have to go back to entirely avoiding workshops again.
---
Also...kind of a dick move forcing people into pvp like that.
---
Damn, hope they update it in next week's update.
---
I'm not sure what your point is. That's forest armor. Says so right in the name.
---
Problem  is strength is such a packed stat perk wise.
---
No, heavies are the best coming out of this.
---
It‚Äôs really not, it spawns in one of 2 or 3 places, and while it‚Äôs there more than other times it‚Äôs nowhere near as high as you said it was
---
I do
---
Because that‚Äôs less time spent gathering food, water, stims, and disease cures/the material to make them and more time spent actually playing
---
Nah mate
---
It's my go to gun for long range
---
The best way is keep the damage on for the fight, then switch to weight reduction after to fast travel home.
---
You're just not very bright, are you. You're claiming you can turn forest into urban, which is not possible.
---
Oh damn - I didn't even think of that..... fuck.
---
 i might sack the stealth bit.Sounds like a bad idea.Too much going on in a small area.
---
I might have a go at stacking Chems and Buffs then killing him before the Nerf tomorrow :-)
---
Prime weapon mods, ammo, serums...other stuff I can't think of.
---
Decontamination Shower üöøüßº
---
I've got all of them except the assaultron. That's why I'm starting to think I'm making it up. Lol
---
Food and water take essentially no time to gather, disease doesn't matter/easily mitigated by the sulfur water
---
Ok, thank you for the add on this. Maybe I have to rethink the archer build. *cries over robin hood dreams*
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs funny how those bugs never mean everything drops with swing speed right?
---
If anything heavies are becoming more viable because of patch 22.
---
why not not just pop a Radshield ?
---
Maybe last man standing is more what I had in mind.
---
Gun runner works with pistols, shotguns, but what is not advertised is that it works for even sub-machine gun and 10mm sub-machine gun.  
---
Alternatively you could use Dodgy. You will be slower but more tanky.
---
Are you loitering around them hoping to leech? This really doesn't make much sense to me. I've literally never received such messages and how would you get them anyway?
---
I don't have a mic ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I also find the chat distracting so I keep it muted.
---
Messes up the mutations
---
Ah, then not like Left 4 Dead.
---
More similar to what you see in Gears of War or what Fortnite originally was.
---
That could be a lot of fun.
---
OP in pvp?
---
Only if it starts with all 25 players on the server, crammed in the space, last one standing....
---
The punching noises at first as the room clears would be hysterical....
---
No. I said you can change urban to Forest to urban
---
You're not very bright are you? 
---
When you change the urban paint to Forest it is still urban in name. It is just Brown. Which you can than turn back to blue with the click of one button. 
---
I mentioned this because you said that it can't be changed back. 
---
But it can.
---
We should have more of them honestly. Bethesda has done nothing with this issue and many others. Way better than the fluff and bootlicking posts that take up space here.
---
Mostly Priming your weapons to use Ultracite ammo. It can also be used to craft some power armor mods (like jetpack) and craft serums for mutations.
---
Xbox has a messaging system.
---
No it really isn't especially considering how long it's been around. Along with many other bugs. Pretending they don't exist is what they wish for so they can just ignore issues as is tradition.
---
Well there was that one bug were everyone got legacies out train vendors at the start of summmer......lol.
---
I‚Äôve gotten them from public teams.
---
That would be brilliant, not sure if you could get everyone crammed in but it would be chaos.
---
Could do like colossal problem though and have a max of 8 in each instance.
---
Watch the ammo counter though, if it‚Äôs anything like what happens to me it‚Äôs because you already ran out of ammo then the game for whatever Bethesda magic reason, gives some back. Like on my handmade and combat rifle, I can read the ammo go down to 0 then bump back up to 10.
---
I‚Äôm with you there. I‚Äôm an older player and the whole online multiplayer thing has passed me by. Gaming for me is a release from work and stress. The thought of turning on a mic and talking to complete strangers is a little unnerving  but perhaps I should give it a go.
---
It‚Äôs the ones where people have had it happen to them before and still are logged on on a Tuesday and lose another week of weeklies that really make my eyes roll.
---
"Never going to use" My harpoon gun build disagrees with you sir.
---
Don‚Äôt be afraid of me man! Stop by the camp and I can craft you something :)
---
100%
---
I'm a shit aim so I have to cheat üòî hahaha
---
This was what i thought would happen.
---
I love getting input from other players.
---
Going to just configure my build and have a go i am running 4 unyielding pieces + Chameleon..
---
I think i will swap covert operative out for Ninja.And lose  a perk in Heavy weapons for incisor.Pop a few food buffs and chems.Use my Zealots 50 cal explosive instead of the bloodied minigun.Meanning i can run with a little bit more health.The Deathclaw should still it hard with my mutations and Chems.
---
How certain are you of this? Re: addiction debuff is suppressed but you maintain the damage boost while suppressed?
---
I'm not forcing people into it. THEY chose to stand in a PvP zone.
---
Sulphuric water means fast traveling and load time, food and water still involve time spent going to my base to grab stuff and inventory space to carry it, stim packs still require farming materials or stims themselves... or I can have all of those things in one item that weighs next to nothing, appears in my inventory magically, and I can spend my time doing things that isn‚Äôt farming.
---
What part of ‚Äúfarming for things sucks, I‚Äôd rather use my time elsewhere‚Äù did you not understand?
---
i don't use ultracite ammo. 
---
that may have to change
---
I usually will put a skin on weapons i dont want to lose, sucks when showing them off as they dont appear in the trade menu for others to see though. 
---
My scrip I usually will rename quickly with a period on the front so I kniw I can scrip it.
---
The sell items I dont really do anything with. 
---
I know it isnt simple or what you want, but just sharing what i do so maybe it would help you.
---
You realize posts here don't get shit fixed right.  Same response from community managers " know its a  problem ill let the boyz in the basement know about it".
---
They stated in the previous game events last month that they are working on it(guilds) for the future, but it is currently in the planning stage right now. So maybe next year we will see an update that adds it in.
---
I mean, I can spam quantums like a motherfucker. ;)
---
The amount of people blaming game pass or xbox in general is pretty wild. A lot of us have had one console (in my case, an xbox) and don't have the money to get pc (or let's be real we would just play on pc) so we have to play on xbox. And game pass gives people the opportunity to play something they might not have otherwise. I played 3, NV, 4, but heard so much bad about 76 I never bought it. But game pass released it so I finally gave it a go, starting a month or so ago. And I found out it's not that bad. It has its bugs and issues, sometimes game breaking sure but I can usually just get past them and ignore them. I love the community and the social aspects of the game, I love helping new players, and it's just douchey to assume game pass or xbox players in general are the issue. We are literally just fallout fans who like fallout and play the game. Same as you. Every platform is going to have toxic people, stop trying to put all the blame on one or the other. Alienating your own community for the platform they play on is toxic within itself.
---
no, i‚Äôm saying your railway is over-powered because it‚Äôs the only weapon that can use VATS in pvp :P
---
I figured it out I think. I didn't heal after I relogged, I only got rid of the rad but the health stayed low. I guess it's only when you take rad damage, and not if you fill your bar with rad. Strange tho, because I did get the mutation symbol but no mutation this way, but after I healed up again, I got mutation every time.
---
I just assumed power armour was the way to go.
---
Have not even tried it in the unyielding,i will now.
---
More meat week? Hell yeah I'm in. Pat's Grahm on the back it's ok buddy we all know you cant count.
---
I thought that was a scientist thought he had figured out time travel by moving a certain speed just as a reference to Back to the Future. At the front of that part of the monorail you see the front window smashed and I am fairly sure a skeleton of a scientist either on the floor outside or in the cabin.
---
Not the case. Prime example of what I'm talking about in the title.
---
Hahaha booooooooo
---
It takes literally 0 time to farm all those things.  Every time I go back to my base for any reason I pick up the water.  0 time spent.  I naturally just collect enough meat to eat.  0 time spent.  With healing factor I never use stims, when I do, I never run out.  I just collect them from dead bodies with other loot.  0 time spent.  I don't have to farm for any of these items.  You're telling me you can't even feed, heal, and hydrate yourself easily?
---
Name checks out Professor ü§™
---
I didn‚Äôt know that
---
I also didn‚Äôt know that
---
No I was not clear enough. I do not have the weapon anymore. It is completely gone.
---
Definitely going to give this a go.
---
Thanks.
---
I have 3 decent pieces of High Level Forest Scout Bolstering in my stash,looks half decent.Is this worth making a set of armour ?
---
Thanks in advance.
---
I didn't until I started using a gat plasma.  The ammo for it is so cheap.  It took me a few hours to farm enough materials to make a few thousand cores, I don't think I'll ever need to make ammo for it again.
---
Honestly i went through the story kinda quickly and didn‚Äôt get that memo
---
I keep having a bug with the region explorer quest. Like discover locations in a specific region. It always goes up to 4/5 locations, but it won't ever complete. I think it's just bethesda being greedy with it's atoms
---
It didn‚Äôt work when I tried to add you!
---
&gt; I think a lot of it is feeling really useless (like ‚Äúoh my god I‚Äôm so sorry you have to waste your time dealing with me, please don‚Äôt worry about it‚Äù) but I also just panic around other people. I don‚Äôt wanna make events harder, don‚Äôt want people to be disappointed when I show up, whatever. 
---
So some context here, as someone who just hit lvl 100 about a week ago.
---
One, I'm nowhere NEAR as strong as some of the other people out there, even at my own level. RNG hasn't blessed me with a bloodied weapon I like, and I've not kicked the habit of weight based perks to focus on damage efficiency ones. Not all high levels are built the same.
---
Two, I've got basically four thing I can do; Wander around hoping to find a legendary I can take down even though I can't scrip any more items today, on the off chance its a good drop (It likely won't be). Grind out a few dailies/side quests I have left (Tedious, not super interesting). Wait for an event worth doing because I need a drop (eg; Be bored until the timer rolls through)
---
But, I do have an EXTRA option. I can run around to new players and take that Anti-Armor lvl 15 pistol I found, jazz it up with a bunch of mods, and give it to someone who is level 17. It's WAY more rewarding than getting 1% closer to my Mr Fuzzy mascot head. Obviously its your leisure time, enjoy it how you will. You're in no obligation to cater to someone looking to take you under their wing, or give you a bunch of stuff. But simply exiting as a new player isn't a drain on anyone else.
---
Stopped playing about 2 months after release.  Boring,  buggy game and nobody wanted to play again.  They still don't and i don't blame them. Came back a month ago,  and it's way better than it used to be.  Came back with 3k caps,  spent 30k, still have 13k. Got alot a neat stuff. 
---
I just don't care about thre stuff i missed and I'm only half way through the season thing.  Still don't mind.  It's actually fun now.
---
Congrats I got one out of 30 some tickets I love it
---
I‚Äôm on now!
---
No, for melee unyielding is by far more powerful than power armour, 
---
At "full bloodied" and 15 points in strength my B/SS MMG one hits everything but big enemies like behemoths and scorched beasts.
---
Thank you that would make sense that he be able to kill the Bos pretty easily
---
Prefer single player anyway. Also have a mic and use it because text sucks compared to voice comms.
---
MODUS isn‚Äôt the Enclave. He‚Äôs the Siri for the Enclave‚Äôs base in WV, and he‚Äôs no longer in contact with the other Enclave assets and locations.
---
Didn't know that.Thanks.
---
Hence why no one really has anything good to say about that approach.
---
Consensus seems to be no power Armour,unyielding,and chameleon.
---
Never even crossed my mind to do this event out of power armour.
---
This is a great idea.
---
My only question is that isn't the main issue now that all bonuses are factoring only a Weapon's Base, unmodded damage, then any additional damage from Weapon mods gets added after that?
---
So if a Gauss Minigun does 90 Damage without mods, and 100 with the Prime Receiver, any damage boosts are only looking at the 90, then once they get added, adding the additional 10 from the Mod?
---
Youre on ps right?
---
I'm a little confused about the glitch you speak of. Are you talking about when using any automatic weapon and it stops firing before clip is empty? It is a waste of time to reload on a getting plasma or laser. Just go in vats and back out fixes it, also staring down sites and releasing fixes too. I have not experienced anything where the gun tries to reload itself though? Only stops firing (jams) before clip is empty.
---
Marcus? He's from FO2 and reappears in NV.
---
üòÇ I wonder if they ever found someone stupid enough to pay that lol
---
Sometimes it just feels weird. You can be fighting Earle &amp; he's dead in just a few minutes...then you do the same thing again, with the same mix of players &amp; he lasts twice as long.
---
I suspect it might have to do with lag...if the server is a bit laggy, you can really stack damage (where +limb damage really shines), but if you hit a server that's snappy, all of a sudden the bosses feel like tanks.
---
Just a hypothesis
---
Raw flux has to converted to stable flux which can be used to make prime weapon mods, ultracite ammo (for the prime weapons), mutation serums, fusion cores, the decontamination shower, etc.  Other components are combined with the stable flux as well of course.
---
Chicago
---
~~The weapon mods are counting to base damage.~~
---
~~With prime receiver the base damage would be 100~~
---
It looks like they don't count towards base damage, see link from BOSS\_Zombie
---
I didnt know this.
---
Learning all the time.
---
thanks.
---
Hopefully this thread will help others tweak their builds, and become more lethal killers of Earl.
---
certain armor (leather/metal/combat/robot)
---
have different armor types,
---
light/sturdy/heavy
---
in a completely unmodded unlegendary state they are named accordingly, if they are legendary or modded you have to look up there stats online to see if they are light/sturdy/heavy
---
overall the "bulkier" the armor the higher its tier.
---
I had the same question - because you'd think the "receiver" would at least count as the new base.
---
Not all 25 maybe 8 player instances like Earle
---
It would be good enough if they've added min (gear) level (like item level in WoW) required and make it so SBQ/Earl/Ecryptid loot drops for everyone that joined said event.   
---
If someone wants to get the loot he can shoot SBQ twice and be useless for the rest of time so basicly loot for everyone participating wouldnt change a thing.  
---
One of the main reasons im suggesting that here is that i'm seeing a lot of under geared low levels joining i.e. Wendigo Collosus event just to sit afk in a corner or try to shoot it with almost zero damage just to resign few moments later so they wont waste resources.
---
Not quite - Enclave have high end officers, the generals and the like.
---
The ranks below that weren‚Äôt influential enough for the Enclave to care about them.
---
Iirc it's 1 coin x swap no matter what.
---
Really? I thought that was a huge issue on the PTS.
---
Ya
---
Cool thanks! That‚Äôs what I thought but wanted to make sure
---
Very clever! Yes, tags would be a great QoL addition, but those are good work arounds until then.
---
If you still need kills I would be happy to help :)
---
Yea, L240, in butressed SS armor (340 DR) , and still go to PA fighting more than a couple of L68 ghouls simultaneously.  The rad damage they deal is what got me (speaking of which, if you have the high capacity backpack, its something like a 50% RR reduction.)
---
  Fortunately, I have a SS ghoul slayer switchblade that melts them though :)
---
It takes time, but you can try to get WR armor at rusty pick.  Took me a lot of levels to get a full set of WR metal armor with WR for ammo, junk, weapons, and aid.  Much faster rolling for it on SS armor.  Got lucky and got them all within about 30 rolls.
---
Vampire weapons will do wonders for your health, especially if they are auto/semi auto.  Vampire 50 vs SSQ...you will win, especially if you can get high ground.
---
Couple days ago, got attacked by a L65 legendary SB and her entourage.  Was not in PA - but equipped a vampire plasma.  Didn‚Äôt bother with PA, and never dropped below about 90% health.
---
Assaultrons (take out their legs) and other robots - try a troubleshooters (anything).  30% bonus damage.
---
IF you are not Really taking advantage of the barbarian perk, try one gun army.
---
Yes it was a scientist, but that wasnt to say that it wouldnt have worked. They never made it through the pylon
---
I've never seen one
---
Pizza Hut's is more powerful.
---
How can I check if it is light, heavy, sturdy?
---
Probably because ammo is handled by the server but the ‚Äúits time to reload‚Äù flag is client side.
---
It‚Äôd be cool if more people could join and fights were on the same scale of the Scorched Earth event
---
Yeh, do you know about nukesanddradons.com (sorry on phone so can't post link)
---
Great tool for sorting your build out. With the right defensive perks and a bit of poison resistance you can take a lot of hits before dying.
---
Maybe if there was actually new content to focus on I‚Äôd care less but as this is literally the only thing new to do it needs to be done right
---
Well I‚Äôm happy for you that your choices in play style make that easy for you. You play the game however you feel is best and I‚Äôll just be over there being ‚Äúwrong‚Äù and play how I want to play. Assuming that‚Äôs okay with you
---
But look, theres no toxic behavior, si? Cant deny it
---
You think challenges won't auto complete when we have Atom Challenges in the interim?
---
Depends if I am using a low rof prime weapon...
---
Stay and collect the ammo/loot. If you have been killing the wendigo spawns you will get tons of ammo that you used.
---
My ninja learned it I think.
---
I loot like hell until I have about a minute or 40 seconds to run so I can still loot the box and ammo cans up top so I‚Äôm a good in between since it doesn‚Äôt matter if I actually make it to the exit or not so I‚Äôm in no rush to run out. If I don‚Äôt get the box or ammo cans I‚Äôll just get them next time
---
For me I want the buffs, so the gathering is fine. The meter us there to remind me to re apply buffs.
---
Pc stuff in general is better. We are talking about us console peasants and Bethesda.
---
there are spreadsheets online where you can check the stats, i had a better one once but i quickly searched and found this one
---
https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/04/29/fallout-76-armor-guide-best-armor-how-outfits-work/#armor
---
its a bit tedious to compare, but sooner or later, youll get to remember the stats and also you will recognize the difference by the looks
---
I stay behind and loot. The chest at the end doesn't justify the mad dash to the end and, just like in real life, I can only run for like 0.7 seconds before running out of energy so it's especially stressful trying to get out.
---
The box can spawn up to 500 caps but you can loot so many screws it‚Äôs basically a wash...like you said staying and looting is way less stressful!
---
Im getting a bug with normal laser rifles and such it says I've got 6 more rounds but reloads early
---
I don't give a crap about screws or ammo so I run to the box and then leave. But then again I haven't seen anyone dropping a nuke to start it in over a week, so haven't run it in a long time.
---
All I know is none of my weapons can even touch Earl. I don‚Äôt move his health bar at all, so when I want to do A Colossal Problem I go when there‚Äôs a group. I hit the big baddy once then spend the rest of the time mopping up the Wendigo horde that comes with the battle.
---
I‚Äôm in the middle of reworking my perk cards so I can do more damage in the late stages of the game, but it‚Äôs a slow process for me since I don‚Äôt get to play super often.
---
Really? I haven't seen anything like that. Do you've a link?
---
I don‚Äôt know if this will help you, but don‚Äôt let the reload animation kick in, just switch to your other weapon then back to the Gatling, (I have this problem with my Gatling plasma) if I reload animate I won‚Äôt get 500 but some random number of ammo but switching weapons when I‚Äôm on 0 and back gives me 500 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Edit: unless i have a half used core already
---
I tend to make up for the screws in volume of events - I do 5 - 6 Earles at a run, so even if I only pick up 70 - 80 screws per event, it adds up.
---
In addition to what everyone else said:
---
Shielded lining for your vault suit and other under armour also uses stable flux of different colors. Pretty good special stat boosts available.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Shielded_lining
---
If you dont stabilize the flux it decays. Need glowing mass, hardened mass, and high radiation fluids, all of which you find on enemies corpses in blast zones. Stabilize at a chemistry set. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Flux
---
Some of the things are in the aid tab, some in the junk tab.
---
Balls, so it looks different because of this, god dammit, its a small visual nuisance
---
I‚Äôm just happy it was so early on. I‚Äôd be so pissed if it was later tier
---
I'd also recommend against asking me to trade my Quad FFR FR Plasma Rifle...because it ain't gonna happen.
---
Could this not be the spark that leads to the war ?
---
Emergency Protocols!! If you‚Äôre a low health build aka bloodied it‚Äôs a must have on your PA and requires 4 stable violet flux. People covered pretty much everything else
---
Oh man.  I'm a level 26, and some love 100+ kept trying to trade, and get me to follow him. I had no idea what he wanted so I just kept running away, continuing my search for wood. Im so terrible at this game. üòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
One day we'll get the hang of it.
---
Happened the same on my alt, I dropped the gun and the game crashed.. yayyy
---
Edit: was a trash weapon so no drama for me, but still it's dangerous
---
Well they used to back before seasons but I don‚Äôt recall this level of whining
---
Can an American tell me how fast the website open for him?
---
I loot like hell. Screws, ammo, stims and if I'm lucky, super stims (not sure what triggers getting those sometimes versus other times where I don't get any?)
---
Full uny in sneak with low health. Easily do the damage alone to kill Earle. The trick is staying alive or having a couple other players there who stop his health resetting when u do die.
---
i spend most of the time taking care of the spawns so i'm usually still looting meat piles when hello darkness my old friendddddd
---
Is there a guide for builds? I keep hearing about them but have no idea how to make one.
---
Why not ad a holloween presents like how they did to Christmas and mole miner pales from treasurnhunter
---
I always stay and loot
---
I‚Äôve just hit level 280. 
---
I actively search for low level characters because I want to give them stuff. 
---
Plans. 
---
Recipes. 
---
Weapons. 
---
Armor.
---
I want to pay forward the kindness that was shown to me when I was low level. 
---
If you‚Äôre on PC, I‚Äôd be happy to craft you literally anything you‚Äôd like at no cost. 
---
I will mod every piece of equipment you have and I want absolutely nothing in return other than you enjoy yourself and try to pay it forward to others. 
---
Seriously though, turn on pacifist. 
---
I did a long time ago. I was always concerned that I‚Äôd hit someone by mistake in a large fight and accidentally enable pvp.
---
I have seen some floating around last I played.
---
I have to agree with you. My food spoils faster than I use it, I get stimpaks from events so frequently that I sell them at vendors, and I just wait for diseases to go away. The only one I find annoying is dysentery because I have to eat more.
---
yeah keep in mind sturdy has higher resistances than light and heavy has the highest resistances, so theres also a stat difference its bot only visual.
---
i quite like it though it makes for some interesting looking combinations üëçüèº
---
I‚Äôve found that I can progress some of my broken ones on different characters . Still no queen tho
---
Can I ask a dumb question? What‚Äôs in the box? Never found it and I‚Äôm usually doing well enough with rewards
---
Flatwoods monster is an alien....
---
It‚Äôs a rare plan and I think a findable mod too
---
Will it matter for the legendary perks? I mean if I have combination of leather sturdy, light etc it will still count as a set?
---
No it was just the main mission, I'm fairly new and was underpowered against all that shit in that cave
---
That's just how some people are, you don't have to like it, it's just the nature of what being online does to people.
---
I think if you craft Gatling lasers you will get one so you can craft a bunch without using any flux.
---
I still feel like .45 needs a bump
---
Oh my gods I want this so bad.
---
Yep. Lag and magic weapons.
---
Yeah, but at least for me it doesn't count for the challenge, I killed plenty of flatwoods monster, at least more than enough to finish the challenge but it still says 0/3 Aliens Killed
---
are you joining a public team and then not helping the people on that team?
---
I think the best thing to do then is just leave the team, maybe start your ow
---
West Coast USA here, under a second to load after the first time loading
---
They should just be staring at a movie screen like in that place in fo3
---
Big F.
---
How does this differ from the standard use damage calculator (don‚Äôt have the link atm, always just use it from rouge trader)
---
(Heavy) MetaL armor is actually pretty good for DR, but lacks in RR and ER.  I ran with a set of heavy metal for a long time.  
---
Recently replaced it with SS.
---
If you have not done the vault raid, try BoS shielded underarmor.   It‚Äôll give +2 STR (IIRC).  Otherwise, get the SS underarmor and shielded mod. 
---
If you like the lever actions, build up PER.  I‚Äôm 15 STR 13 PER, so switch between rifles (fave is a suppressors explosive lever) and melee pending the scenario.
---
The thing with 1H vs 2H - 1H like a switchblade, does less damage, but hits more often, so ultimately, may do more damage than a slower, but harder hitting weapon.  My serrated vampire switchblade will hit 3x in the time it takes a grognak to hit once.  Grognak does 180 per hit, switchblade is rated about 90.  So 270dmg v 180 in the same time frame.  Plus health boost for every hit.  Against glowing enemies, I‚Äôve seen it hit for 500.
---
The SS serrated ghoul slayers switchblade 1hits a L42, and 2-3 hits a L68 charred. (Bonus, it also 3 hits a L42 glowing wendigo).  But the SS makes it 3 hits in about 1 second.   Not bad for a 0.3# weapon :)
---
Haha certainly not but I hate not being able to explain wtf was goin on with just emotes, just a bug bear of mine
---
im not familiar with the legendary perks but from what ive seen it does matter, in fact its exactly what is required in order to work
---
certain armor like marine or wood only have one type
---
but leather/robot/combat/metal armor need to be the same type in order for the legendary perks to work
---
(as i said though i couldnt test it myself so far)
---
I use concentrated fire and vats the wings.
---
You get possum badges by doing 
---
Toxic Clean Up (Quest)
---
Located( in my personal terminal)
---
Possum challenges in the world challenge menu
---
And campfire tales(event) 
---
There is 2 differ mode
---
Tadpole: to beat the event on last part to kill the legendary wendigo
---
Possum: last part of event survibe and don't let the campfire destroyed for 3 waves
---
Instanced interiors??? Is that coming? I absolutely don‚Äôt want the load time for that.
---
I‚Äôd love to have unlimited space but not at the cost of a load screen
---
Not sure what pool party is, apart from an actual party in a pool .... But ..... Sounds like you know them, so just say thanks for me. GladHeAteHer
---
You get much more by staying and looting. If you need caps, put the screws in your vendor. They will sell fast.
---
Sadly, I don‚Äôt think this works. I have a ‚Äúmagic‚Äù weapon that breaks all limbs just from regular use and I‚Äôve yet to see it make a difference.

---
ffr is good on gatling but I think the AA 10 is the clear winner here.
---
It can be learned, its a plan, and its a standalone mod, And it works on legendaries.
---
If you are on PS4, I can do it for you.
---
My two favorite weapons are a serrated vampire switchblade and a serrated SS ghoul slayers switchblade.
---
Awesome! Thanks man!
---
I honestly agree. Bethesda, hire this man!! Everytime I do this event I run out of ammo so I just end up getting off mid event and don't get back on for a while. And it's really not easy to find the popular ammo in vending machines.
---
Consider radiation rumble
---
Ammo factory is the very first legendary card i will try to max, without doubt or hesitation.
---
I had the same exact thing happened to me a few months ago with a two shot fixer. I put in a ticket to Bethesda but they said they don‚Äôt restore lost items.
---
Line in the sand with tent glitch
---
I saw RDR2 on game pass, played RDR but never thought of playing 2 bc it's on game pass alone.
---
Anti-Armor
---
I would love to use that area again. It‚Äôs a great little area and I really hoped there was more to it than the Johnny quest part
---
What you're describing was Survival mode in L4D series. Where the four human players battled against an increasingly more difficult set of hordes until you succumbed to the ultimate sacrifice. Of course if you learnt ways in glitching or exploiting the environment it was possible to outlast the timer.*
---
If you're describing humans able to interact and control NPC's monsters like Scavenge and Versus modes, now that would be the ultimate PVE experience :) Bagsy being Earle :) . Later on Valve also introduced Tank Mode as well.
---
Personally would love a horde mode at the old brotherhood outpost in insane asylum but it takes too much time to make and they already have a Halloween event. Maybe next year but that would mean they would need to cut one of the events as Bethesda only makes 2-3 holiday event per year.
---
Id love to see instead of current lame pvp work shop defense a small chance to spawn a horde event with big waves. Less xp for each kill but wave event xp as they escalate.
---
I would dig this in the PvP sense, and I‚Äôm not really that into PvP in this game. But if there were enemy factions I could build a team up and fight against an actual enemy faction on map, that would be just awesome
---
Haha yes 100% that was me. I went into the cave to do a mission kept getting smashed, so randomly added the highest level player on the map, they tried to help me but turns out the Wendigo at the end of the mission didn't spawn, I was runnin round like a headless chicken trying to work out wtf to do üòÇüòÇ these 2 players I could hear but couldn't speak back to explain. 
---
Anyway you\her probably don't care too much but I hate not being able to explain what I needed .
---
Thank to not of you for the offer of help anyway. Much appreciated
---
Every single flooting camp or box house is from someone who does not care... I say about 10% of the players care
---
Pacificist mode brah
---
...There's a box?
---
Anyway, I've never made it successfully back to the entrance, because I always get one-shotted by *something* - and I'm not sure what - during my mad sprinting. Whether it's all the explosions killing me or what, I have no idea. It doesn't seem to affect any other players. Feels like bs, tbh. So I just don't bother running anymore, and just chill in the main chamber until the timer runs out.
---
You are such an idiot, and the worst part of it is how smart you really think you are.
---
No - same as nukagirl helmet.  They look almost identical too.   ü§£ü§î
---
What everyone else said, and :
---
Inert flux consumable as water.
---
Unless you find the standalone mod, stable violet flux is required to make calibrated shocks for your PA
---
Do you know the plan for the regular X-01 Jetpack? Those are just skins for it.
---
geez  :(
---
The dark matter jetpack is basically a skin for the jetpack, you need the plans for the normal jetpack then you can craft the dark matter one
---
I honestly couldn‚Äôt be bothered. Yup, we cleared the SBQ for the fourth time today, Twentieth time this week. 
---
I don‚Äôt give people a thumbs up for wiping their ass, and all the events are that boring now anyways
---
Is this how they make them app spawn in the center?!
---
Since stalkers means nothing and 15vats means nothing in most big guns past the first shot, the aa+aim will be about 23%, the 25% faster is just ahead. Do put the speedy receiver on.  For low level stuff the above is more on the stalkers side, for bosses take the aa10. Most would take the aa10 based on the prefix anyway, but that's the reasoning.
---
I do think lag explains plenty of things in this game - but not this, in my opinion. This has proved true in every scenario for months regardless of lag.
---
ALL THE TIME
---
I went to the Thunder Mountain substation by Watoga and did "Census Violence". It spawned 5 deathclaws (not all at once).
---
Most likely place is the tunnel behind the computer (management) console but not always.  Can be any of the spawn points.
---
It works on the dragon too. Reload time is cut from 15 minutes to 10. Lol....
---
I may be wrong here, but current damage calculation is multiplicative where after the change it‚Äôs only added on so that might be where they‚Äôre different
---
https://www.kevduit.com
---
Yes by putting a tent on the road
---
My version of this bug goes further where it will discard cores of bugged reloads. So I'll get down to 20 or so rounds left, it will act like it jams where it shows me firing, but no lasers are projected and no damage is being done. I'll manually reload it and all of a sudden my total number of cores drops by two. Didn't realise it was bugged till I spent 15 fully charged cores in one SBQ battle and she was only at half life with several other people.
---
For the 3rd season, this winter. 
---
Here's an interview: go at 11:00 ( https://youtu.be/g8UG_b7JsBk )
---
This is a fun idea.
---
Buuuuuu
---
With horde events, if the icon moves while your looking at the map, you teleport to the boss.  If it‚Äôs stationary, you have to hunt it down in different locations.
---
Not for nothing, it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt matter your level. If the mob gets one shot, everyone misses out regardless of level. I‚Äôm almost 300 and lose out sometimes. Oh well, move on. Of course sometimes my bloodied auto handmade, gets in a couple more bullets than I meant it too, and I am guilty of the quick kill. Shit happens.
---
Huh. I've gotten five fancy revolvers, no fancy shotguns.
---
Think you missed it bud, it's just the same as the scavenger robot but he takes the piss out of you. Closest thing to insult bot we'll ever get
---
anywhere on the road or in a specific place? I was wondering what made it happen more often than not lately, and there's usually a tent outside the road (I have one I can place too if need be)...  awesome!
---
I always stand in the center with my explosive 10mm and just fire away to tag it all, usually get 1300-1600 XP per spawn!
---
IDK, have not been using CF long enough to fully evaluate it vs SBs.
---
That said, used CF on the wings while fighting a L65 legendary yesterday - it seemed to land a lot sooner than ‚Äònormal‚Äô (compared to the many other SBs fought with the same weapon (focused vampire gatling plasma, not magic)
---
You‚Äôre crazy if you haven‚Äôt primed your gauss mini.
---
Oh no, trust me, it's bullshit. I was just pointing out that players fixing Bethesda shortcomings is nothing new. As long as people keep doing it for free though nothing is gonna change most likely. 
---
The reason 76 is in the condition it's in is because they finally made a game that players aren't allowed to fix since it's all online.
---
Looks like no
---
Simple, tormenter perk card mate. Cripple her wing and she will land every time. The problem is everyone shooting her in the sky. This just aggros her so she will just crop dust and not land. It‚Äôs a fact if you pop her a few times to gain her attention and leave her alone she will land EVERY time. Try telling a server full of Power Armor and heavy guns to leave her alone tho üòÉ trust me I‚Äôm level 540 and solo her all the time. It‚Äôs truth.
---
and please make ash piles go below meat piles.... major events there's so much you can't get to because all the ash piles cover it all up :(
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
Googled it for ease of access, apologies for my previous laziness. 
---
This tool allows for the change of how the buffs get calculated (multiplicative vs additive). The dev does state that there are some inconsistencies with damage calculations in the PTS and thus what you see may not be what happens at launch of One Wasteland, but it does at least give an idea and also allows you to compare both side by side
---
Dammit :c I saved all my scripts for it
---
Put your crosshairs on them, and if they come up off white then they are in pacifist. If red then its lead rain storm time...... if you can.
---
Oh didn't know they had something like that. Well the biggest difference would be that my website is more simple. Simple in design and simple in functionality.
---
Where rouge trader is really detailed.
---
I'm guessing not enough people cared to grind that ridiculous amount for a meh reward.
---
I do, but not everyone knows about it.
---
I really like when the game I play the most is not the most popular one out there. Mainly because of this kinda shit.
---
It‚Äôs not a bug, it‚Äôs a feature. Now pay up. /s
---
I also would love to get a bloodied revolver. Quick question are the prefixes always the same on the shotgun. I have a anti armor shotgun pretty much just wondering i it can be different like the revolver
---
Bro, unless they're being a dick to you, just interact with them. Most higher levels I've interacted with are pretty decent folk, just trying to enjoy the same game as everyone else. I'm almost level 150 and I wouldn't consider myself high level whatsoever lol.
---
That's what finding random disease cures are for.
---
I don‚Äôt think the numbers update for the weekend and so most likely won‚Äôt update for the holiday as well. I would check on this again tomorrow.
---
gauss shotgun BAYBEEEEEEEE
---
Fair enough. Have you also encountered differences in what a weapon ‚Äòshould do‚Äô based on your tool and what it‚Äôs actually doing on the PTS?
---
P.s. it was just pure luck that the highest ranked person on that map indeed was a sexy sounding Spanish lady,üòÇüòÇ but , I didn't know that at the time. 
---
Just pass on my thanks anyway üçªüçª
---
It's not wrong, it's just a waste.
---
I'm not positive, I believe I've seen them in the opening in the wall that is to the right. Hopefully someone else can verify that
---
Yes. I have the standard one equipped currently.
---
No you shoot all 20-30 then youre hud says ur bullets are at 7 just watch the bullet cound go to 0 the go to 7 when ur reloading but the gat plasma and lazer are broken
---
At max level you generate 2 every 20 minutes,  you can hold a max of 10
---
I have the normal on crafted and equipped. It says "Unlocked in the atom store" or something of that nature.
---
I used to have a Gatling plasma and I would be throwing out like 20 cores every few days because would shoot my cores until empty but I would have like 3-4 cores per hour that were just 20-15%
---
Wish they'd just revert to how it was on release. Sure youd lose the rest of that fusion core if you changed weapon. But at least you didn't lose cores at compete random.
---
Damn ok! That‚Äôs good to know appreciate it. I see this working for sure, but the problem is that this isn‚Äôt exactly wide spread information. Also needing a specific perk to fight is redundant because specific build have specific requirements. I shouldn‚Äôt need to work around a perk to fight an essential enemy. Which is why I suggest rework.
---
It also only weight 0.1
---
I stayed behind today. Died with 5 secs on the clock. One of the other stay-behind guys ran over to revive me at the last second so I could warp out with them. Amazing community!
---
I usually shoot all the spawns so there's a lot of incentive for me to pick up all the loot.  I've been staying behind after finding out the loot box (which I also just found out about last week LOL) doesn't have much in it.
---
That's odd. If you have the plan and it unlocked. Should let you craft it
---
Guarantee that they update tonight or tomorrow to show that we did. The way it will probably go is that the traffic will change to the glass count but Beth will say we did it and unlock the event for Thursday.
---
I'm on PC, but thanks. Right now, I'm using a vampire's +40% power attack +agility, but that's because I'm still leveling. I'm hoping to get a  bloodied ss switchblade, but I want the serrated mod; otherwise i could go with a stealth blade on a combat knife.
---
Lots of high level players act like that. I've been attacked, followed around and berated by high level players more than anyone else lol just because they've played for a long time doesn't mean they are incapable of being toxic
---
Luckily there's a mod for that, but it took that mod being made and a bazillion downloads of it to even get wildcard to add the 30 second grace period to vanilla.
---
Honestly, even with 50 gigs worth of mods to improve/fix the game shortcomings, as well as spending days on end tweaking the server settings, there's just no winning with that game. It's a cluster from top to bottom. 
---
The best part is they keep making new dlc that keeps tacking on more and more issues without ever fixing the old ones. And you best believe people just keep buying it. 
---
I'd like to think that if someone came along and made a game that was Ark in concept, but only 1/4 the content *but actually worked as intended*, it'd make absolute bank.
---
But who are we kidding. People would still play Ark and complain.
---
Literally nothing
---
You‚Äôre not already swimming in all the aid items you could ever need?  I must throw away 50 stims, Radaway and purified water in a four hour session.
---
why don't you just step away for a while (again). there's a big update next week. New stuff being added. balances being made. things being fixed.
---
Clans or guilds would be an awesome addition, and every month there could be monthly challenges to do like "kill x amount of y creature" for a reward at the end. I have a big group of friends that would be great as a clan
---
Fingers crossed.
---
it isn't guaranteed to appear
---
That's usually where I see them too.
---
Wondering if the tent has a "safe" radius around it that doesn't let stuff spawn maybe? just weird it forces it to center LOL
---
Not all of them are at robco.
---
There is another place (Also in the forest) where you can find a couple of actual models. (Not the chess pieces in the frat house)
---
**Potential spoilers ahead! Please don't read if you don't want to know anything** 
---
Actually you got that wrong: From the dialogue files/Wiki It's made clear that Paladin Rahmani is in favor of helping the people of Appalachia - she's the complete polar opposite of how Paladin Taggerdy was towards civilians. (Unlike Taggerdy who was an Army Ranger, Rahmani is former Army National Guard so she has a valid reason to wanting to help civilians)
---
Truth be told i think the disagreements she had with Elder Roger Maxson could've been how the Brotherhood was turning away from truly helping 'Outsiders' but that's doubtful since he was livid at Paladin Taggerdy for suggesting that the Brotherhood not trust civilians.
---
So the disagreements themselves could likely be in relation to the Council of Elders.
---
From what i could gather: The 'First Expeditionary Force' is made up of 3 members from the California detachment (Paladin Rahmani - Knight Shin and Scribe Valdez) while the rest are Initiates and Hopefuls they've recruited across the US. That would put the unit at around 30/50.
---
They lost long range comms due to an attack by Raiders near the Rockies (Possibly near Colorado?) that damaged their equipment - which explains how they've seemingly 'gone rogue' - with no way to communicate with Lost Hills this means the new Appalachia Brotherhood of Steel will be its own entity similar to how the Midwest Brotherhood would become 94 years later during the events of Fallout: Tactics.
---
Why we don't hear anything about them in future games: That can easily be explained: They weren't thought of at that point at all. I'm sure by Fallout 5 there will be talk about a sizeable 'rogue' chapter in West Virginia that had a schism (Events of Fractured Steel) 150+ years ago and leave it to the fans to figure out until Fallout 6.
---
Oh boy do I have news for you....
---
Uh you know it starts on the 15th right
---
By my calculations should do and do do are different.
---
Despite that it's still a hell of a lot of ammo
---
Been told the same thing 100 times
---
Haha yeah
---
I feel stupid
---
Ohhhh can't wait mass crafting mini-nukes with that!
---
Is that max'd out ammo factory or just 1 rank?
---
That's definitely not what public teams are for.
---
Yes, and I am looking forward to it. With those amounts shown, I'll be priming all my guns.
---
/shrug 
---
This was brought up at launch, how text chat is a basic function of multiplayer games *even on consoles*, and that people with disabilities such as those who are mute or those who are deaf cannot communicate without it. Not to mention no one civilized uses voice chat in public lobbies, Too many squeakers, mouth breathers, couples fighting (sometimes fucking) etc. 
---
The community at large, down voted anyone who brought that up, and said it would "break their immersion" to see text chat of people selling stuff.
---
You have a jet pack on because without knowing the plan. You can still craft one of the free states ones you need to actually know the plan to craft the cosmos one. I know this because I had a jet pack on my t65 without buying the plan I recently bought the plan then being I needed it do the jet pack arms for t65
---
Wow you're right, what the hell are the DEVs are doing?
---
Thanks I'll add a notice
---
I've only been playing for a few months (lvl113 I am babey), but I've always been happy to help people out.
---
Then maybe a week ago I had a girl on my public team randomly come up, ask me for a specific outfit (bc as we all know, asses make choice stash boxes? IDK), ignore me after I said I didn't have it &amp; immediately bounce while I got swarmed by a bunch of ghouls *she* attracted (I'm invisible 99.9% of the time).
---
&amp; I was like "bruh, rude". ‡≤†_‡≤†
---
IDK what's up lately but it's messing with the vibe.
---
lol I'm over 400. You worry too much. Unless you're killing people in your camp to steal from them or purposefully acting like a prick doing whatever as you're on your mic screaming nonsense, you have no worries. Oh. And don't show up at events trying to one shot everything. Other than that you're good. 
---
If you see me at an event just look at me like I'm very wise and I will look at you like I'm very wise. Might even drop you stims that I somehow accumulate and always have too many of. Going forward I forbid you to leave events or log out in a panic. If someone gets mad because you made a mistake, ignore them and keep playing. By the time you log off and hop back on you will be on another server with new people and nobody will remember anything happened that last time. You may be useless but it's always good to have friends in the wasteland! (just don't screw up)  :)
---
You haven‚Äôt missed much - I don‚Äôt use any of the ‚Äògifts‚Äô
---
They dropped concrete to ten percent of goal. Even if we didn‚Äôt hit the number they will change the goal again.
---
It's in a similar vein to how a lot of low levels can pick a locked container (not a resource node, like a locked toolbox) and get slapped with wanted. Don't go into workshops if you don't want to watch your back
---
It's all fun and games until someone pulls a knife...
---
I've read that people playing on the PTS say the Tesla issue is fixed and it should come out with patch 22

Scrap
---
You can‚Äôt use more than 15 points worth of cards in any stat.  The legendary card will boost your stat, but you can‚Äôt select extra cards beyond 15 points.
---
50 cal.. no spin up
---
Hey guy, I'd be willing to help you out with that if you could help me transfer a few items? Will you be on later?
---
I used to have a unofficial ark server and I was able to disable the timer. But on single player and non dedicated host session you cant turn it off. Ark on PS4 would be great if you could install mods and tweak .ini settings but sadly you cant do that.
---
Seems MOST of the times are on the south upper area rear room when I'm doing that event. I just run back there, hit it once with a low powered weapon, then signal everyone to come get their shot in.
---
Other times it's in the hole behind computer.
---
Saw it spawn once today on the side hole below the center stairs, never seen one spawn there before.
---
I rename them sometimes so that I know next time
---
agreed, especially if you run Final Word, the .50 cal you get at the end of beketts ally quest
---
*sobs in "LF bss +A knuckles"*
---
They still look the same..just named different.

First day I played, some lvl300 in power armor kept chasing me. Ngl I almost cried because I was like "LEAVE ME ALOOOONE". I knew people could kill other people in the game so I assumed he was trying to hunt me down.
---
Now I realize he was *probably* just trying to help me out. LOL
---
I see a high level player now &amp; I'm mostly like "oh, thank God maybe I won't die this time". Ha.
---
Server hop until it shows up in their vending pool.
---
also I def thought Death Tambo would be in this post. ig I just never get legendary versions
---
I don't think I'm missing a jetpack plan. I'll have to find someone with them all and check against the list.
---
But I though the perk cards description (from what I remember) is that it boosts the stat AND gives you more card slots
---
I liken Vault Tec gear to extremely vanilla ice cream. Sometimes I'd rather go without....
---
Unless it's hot outside....
---
u/delsquest detailed how this works decently. However, a rework is still very viable especially melee users who don‚Äôt solo. What‚Äôs good is that breaking wings can still be incorporated like oh maybe stay on the ground long or maybe they‚Äôre just grounded indefinitely.
---
It is the limb damage that does it.  No need for any special armor.  One shots in VATS.
---
I mean, objectively speaking, this was one of the less "meh rewards." A 50% Off Purveyor sale is pretty big.
---
It‚Äôs not kill stealing or xp hoarding or me being a douche.  In events I shoot to kill.  Doing the event is more important than anything else.  And by the way I‚Äôm the same guy fixing the extractors or gathering ore.
---
I noticed that you have 0 defensive perks.  You‚Äôll probably want to dump some of those carry weight cards and other stuff like rejuvenated to at least add in Blocker and Dodgy.  If you get spotted by a high level Gutsy or pack of ghouls, you‚Äôll get torn to pieces.
---
Edit: TSE is hot garbage, especially on a sniper rifle.  Horrible accuracy and durability.
---
Just went to check the Wiki, that‚Äôs Kong‚Äôs stupid tbh but I guess it makes sense
---
Getting downvotes since the game isn't complete trash; the only trashy thing about the game is the buggyness and lazyness of content added. At the core of 76 is still the best mechanics, visuals and world layout of any Fallout to date and it has the most potential to grow as well. The fact you even got invested enough to mark yourself as a fire breather is proof enough that you are spewing nonsense.
---
You'll probably never find one in a vendor, there worth way more than 30k caps so would have to be a player trade. Easy to spot them since they have rediculous stats such as the range and damage for a lvl 5 weapon.
---
People like you are the reason I randomly give low levels three star gear. Just cause I can.
---
Take my children too
---
lol. That is awesome.
---
Yea, I like my vampire switchblade :)  Been my goto for almost 200 levels. Nirvana would be a SS variant - alas, have not found one yet.  Although I do have that on ghoul slayer switchblade - melts the mob at WS and Rad Rumble. 
---
Kill the scorched around Morgantown airport and Also do collision course.  some of te scorched drop switchblades, which you can then scrap trying to learn the mod.
---
SS Stealth blade hunters combat... yea, goodbye glowing deathclaw :)
---
BTW, The sacrificial blade mod for a machete is also nice to have.
---
I switch weapons and back real quick.  Works well for me, but if it happens on my Gatling Lazer, I've already used about 950 rounds so I don't really care all that much.
---
This has been happening since beta. Can't believe it hasn't been fixed by now. The other frequent problem with gatling plasmas is I'll be firing and the gun will just jam for no reason. And the core is still half full and I have to start firing again. Ridiculous.
---
Kinda feel the same, if someone drops a nuke multiple times in a row, run to SBQ, then run to Earle, the the next nuke.. rinse and repeat.. .especially if it's the same group of people doing it... nobody thumbs up... like you said... jut going through the motions.
---
Had 3 nukes in a row today, SBQ, ACP 5 min break, SBQ, ACP, 10 min break, then a 3rd one...
---
At least everyone in the 1st nuke group was opening lunchboxes like crazy to last through the next few :D
---
50cal every time. Instant firing, easier to moderate the ammo usage even down to single rounds if you're nimble fingered enough. Lacks mods beyond prime and heavy barrel but I still prefer it.
---
Interesting. Any mods for it I should look out for?
---
uh oh. I haven't been following any of the progress before, so I don't know how much the updates are delated, but it doesn't look very promising that we'll hit the leather goal.
---
There's already a "sulfur" water fountain at the whitesprings gold club gazebo that cures all diseases when you drink from it FYI
---
I believe it only has one mod which is the heavy barrel. Oh yeh also prime mod.
---
Uranium Fever. 
---
Start the event (preferably on a team as you can loot things they‚Äôve killed) walk into the mine and kill everything that moves on the way down to the event. Start the event and kill everything. Once done loot every meat pile you find. Pickup every bit of junk you find. Literally clean out the entire mine. Scarp all junk and bulk it. Walk out and down to the train station. Sell every weapon, glowing blood, glowing meat and bulk/scrap junk and aid item you grabbed.  You can easily hit max caps (or very close ) for the day if you get everything.
---
I can especially understand when they're decked out in Raider gear, but 76 is great for being a forgiving wasteland. Once you've hit 50, there's no reason to feel overly intimidated. Even under 50 most players are looking to give things away so they be used rather than just scrip that level 20 bloodied handmade
---
You can learn the serrated mod by scrapping switchblades. Craft a few at a time and scrap them until you unlock it. The higher your Intelligence, the more chances of unlocking it, so take some INT-bosting buffs just before scrapping. If you haven't learned the plan to craft switchblades, you can buy it from the Brotherhood of Steel vendor bot Phoenix at the Watoga Shopping Plaza, or at the BOS vendor located in the Whitespring mall.
---
There have been 50% sales in the past...
---
I'd personally find 46,000,000 leather units if that slurry gypsy ho would discount legendary modules.
---
&gt; "break their immersion"
---
/eyeroll.gif
---
this is why we can't have nice things
---
It's nice but doesn't seem as efficient as normal eating,specially if you want those well fed bonuses.
---
Got any combat shotguns?
---
Yeah c'mon the brotherhood can't make themselves enough ball gags and assless chaps without all that leather!
---
Ok - I hadn‚Äôt compared the chess pieces with the models.
---
  I think the 2nd place is where I found the Mr Handy model, which is a different color pattern than the Gutsy model.   
---
Hmmm....I wonder if the 2nd place randomized which model?
---
Max rank, lvl 4 factory and lvl 2 ammosmith
---
They're all at my camp vendor! :D I sell them stupid cheap since I don't use them and figured other's want them LOL
---
Nice, didn't know it was possible to stack foundations!
---
It's already over as it changed to glass  at 1100hrs EST iirc. Real world number crunching say its a fail, but would Beth allow that or is there be a 'miracle' in the last 24hrs worth of numbers to get over the line? (after the concrete debacle I have lost faith in the idea of Beth ever allowing the community to ever fail)
---
Ah, thanks
---
We are here today, to say our farewells to a weapon that kept one of our wastelanders safe. May your data float on the cloud forever more.
---
The wrapped cap has had the same
---
Problem since launch. 
---
So I can only hope as well
---
Truth. Same goes for radiation rumble.
---
Sting wing n thing drops more than the others imho but takes longer to do.
---
Yeah you just carry around a reduced weight rifle and pop her then switch.
---
Maybe a stupid question but do you have all the stable flux needed?
---
Yup, both my handmade and combat rifle do this.
---
Agree.also you can only carry 5-10 of these ,and if you need them,you're gonna run dry in no time. With normal aid you don't have this problem and also get all those sweet food buffs. I won't call it a useless perk,but it sure isn't appealing to any experienced player.
---
Well the perk system is really good. I'd if you've played any MMOs(Personally fallout 76 is barley a soft MMO) but they are very generous. Most real MMOs take months on months to level up 1 character skill. They have given us the ability to level skills much faster. You can't expect everything on a silver plate and hand fed to you.. Typically in most MMOs you can't change skills, but they have given us the option with little to no  reprcutions. God forbid you lose one misley point (half a level after scraping cards). If your so but hurt about the perk sytem don't use em. You have 6 slots if level 300 and 200 you get 5(personally easily obtainble especially with all the buffs we have to xp). Let's not forget whe. You hit 50 you get 50 perk points. On top of the useless cards. The grind won't be as long as people say its gonna be. Just like the legendary run. I miss 4 weeks and didn't pay a dime or an atom.
---
Send a ticket to support then
---
depends on if you have a legendary or not and the effect of it.  I'm a bit biased because my mini is a legendary with explosive aoe rounds as well as increased damage with hits on the same target.  It's pretty devastating to bosses.  Whereas I just have a standard .50 cal  though if they both had those legendary effects or were both standard I'd go with the .50 for the reasons others have said as well as for the lower weight which allows more looting before having to scrap and stash
---
A few weeks ago my two shot combat shotgun loaded every round into the gun so I had a magazine with 500 rounds in it. This did not go away between sign offs so I did not reload for three days. It was a bug I was ok with lol
---
I just rename them if I can't scrip them fast enough  "aa SCRAP 1" "aa SCRAP 2" etc. But a tagging system would be a million times easier/faster for sure... would like some way to tag things too.
---
Yes.
---
Paradise and rumble usually get me 3 or 4.
---
Sadly I'm on xbox so no PTS for me. I've used this post as reference: [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i9yv3i/no_it_isnt_a_bloodied_nerf_on_the_pts_its_a_nerf/)
---
Yeah. I have somewhere around 50 of each. Some a little more.
---
So we failed the Leather?
---
Railway Spikes need a huge bump per combine.
---
If you put a heart ‚ù§Ô∏è on them you won‚Äôt scrap or discard them at least that‚Äôs how it is in ps4
---
Thanks again for the link! I've updated the website with the link
---
Slurry gypsy ho üòÇ might use this one from now on lol
---
I usually call her the purveyor of misery
---
I'd rather a brand new faction or two first. The fact that nobody on the Eats coast outside WV knows about the BoS or Enclave makes me think something HUGE happened, maybe even at the very end of Fallout 76s story.
---
Maybe they could even team up against a new version of the Scorched plague, where it's much more intelligent and the only way to stop it is to glass the entire state.
---
Yeah I WISH there was text chat. It'd be so much easier to convey instructions and just chat around, and also RP for those into that.
---
Im gonna try that tommorow but the chances of them helping me are low.
---
That be pretty cool
---
It's why I love it on the PC. It is incredibly rare to hear people talking. No problem when it happens but I'd turn nuts if I heard it everywhere I went. But it does make me wonder what it would be like and the kind of people you run into on these other platforms.
---
from what I've heard the tracker on the site only updates once a day and not at all on weekends and holidays which would make sense because they aren't on the clock so why update when they aren't working.  I could be wrong but we might already have hit it.
---
I don't know how many plump kids saved me with their cake eating builds but thanks I guess..
---
I am a gatplaz user and have to dump partly used cores all the time and I never try to reload it just decides to and leave me with cores at 20-2% filling space that are worse than junk
---
How did they kill you?  You can't hurt someone unless they shoot back
---
Just go into the whitespring bunker and check
---
Understandable, but most of us just want to help, tbh. I love helping lower levels, but when that help goes from appreciation to greed is what I have issue with. 
---
Were all gamers playing 76, no reason to be assholes to each other.
---
It's in an odd spot it seems. By the time you can use it you don't really need it. 
---
It might be helpful if you make a new character, but corn soup is right around the corner really so...
---
Because no one seems to have general manners of CLOSING THE FUCKING DOOR!
---
(This is the general rule of thumb why everyone locks doors, and some privacy from people who wanna PVP, trade, etc)
---
My camp My rules.
---
I lock doors to piss people off and make them think I'm hiding something - will there be a vendor full of duped items? Only one way to find out...feel free to glitch in and make a big deal about how you've made me look stupid despite it being such a well known and oft used method of bypassing locks. It's your game time you are wasting not mine.
---
We need the item vacuum from fo4.
---
That didn‚Äôt happen. Unless you were wanted someone can‚Äôt just blast you in the face and kill you without you attacking back.
---
Responders, Free States, and Firebreathers original members are all dead. If those factions return it would just be new NPCs restarting the faction, which we know wouldn't last long lbecause of no mention of any of them in previous titles. So they probably never came back at all
---
You can steal materials from extractors/ water/ crops
---
I have a nice area outside my home for vendors that are well lit, arrows, etc. Then I have a highly detailed home/garage/yard with everything else. For those that like visiting detailed camps, there's something for you to hang out and look at after checking my vendor. For those that only care about vendor, then it's easy to find and get to as soon as you warp in.
---
If your home looks nice when I arrive, I will explore it for a bit after seeing what you have for sale. If it's one of the ugly square floating boxes, then I'm out as soon as I finish checking... and looting your water. LOL
---
How long ago was this?
---
Several months back, there where patches that make this impossible w/o you being wanted or diddling around at a workshop.
---
Anyone else pitching a tent for that .50 and 5mm amount?
---
No? When it comes to money you've paid they should help as soon as possible
---
I've been slowly losing motivation ever since I heard of one wasteland.  I came back for a bit for the brotherhood event,  but I haven't been back on since I heard about the pts changes.
---
So you and the other guy say exactly the opppsite.
---
Or it can bulk and stash/scrap box it automatically. I get tired of only collecting 14 lead scrap form my collector all the time. I know it adds up, but I‚Äôm losing money here BSG
---
More likely a sneak melee.
---
And we‚Äôll be getting sympt-o-matic thing sometime soon-ish
---
I had an awesome 2nd attempt on Earle where he would glitch flat against the floor so he couldn't move where we would do a ton of damage to him. Then he would spring up bounce againt the ceiling and get stuck so we could only see his feet then he would spend the next 3 minutes bouncing up and down where no one could hit him.
---
But for those guns you dont have a nearly empty clip to use up and the reload time isnt that bad.
---
Lots of endgame is about the modules and vault steel, neither are ever on sale. So I see why people didn't push hard for this one.
---
Call of Duty Warzone does this they have a cross platform toggle switch and you can play with people on PC PS4 or xbox one
---
Why didn't they tell us season 1 was ending!?!?!?!
---
Being nice to nice people is really rewarding, but I have a excellent fix for this. I've been doing this since I started playing. Turn off voice chat! Ive had it off since I started and I'll never regret it.
---
Fine with it as long as it‚Äôs a special NW, event that doesn‚Äôt cost me my ammo or scrap.
---
Maybe an old bug came back.
---
Try again, while you have double the mats on you.
---
just answering to the title: no.
---
I've read the SBQ and Bogtown discovery can be resolved with a Bethesda ticket, but they want a screen cap or something?  By resolved I mean they add the atoms, but it won't update on your challenges.
---
I've had problems with the "Take pictures" challenge.  It absolutely refuses to register the Albino Yao Gui, but at least you can complete it without as there are more creatures listed than pictures required.
---
The other problem I found is the Mistaken Identity daily.  It didn't register it as a completed quest, even though I am doing the Dross Toss, Chow Line etc. so it would HAVE to be complete to do them.
---
Buggy as all hell.
---
Edit:  And Sludge Lung as pointed out by another poster..  Does not register as a disease I have caught (multiple times).
---
My syringer has over 700 rounds in it, i will never have to reload it again, i dont know why but i just pulled it out one day and saw the number,
---
HG user here, I have a Furious Gatling Gun as my main weapon, because it packs a punch and has absurdly good range.
---
I have Final Word (Beckett's weapon, a 50cal with Anti Armor and FFR) as my "turn everything in front of you into mush" weapon when things get too close.
---
Literally don't need anything else.
---
I have the same experience in the other places.
---
I've had 2 people that I can remember. Once last year I left my mic on, so this dude was like "Hey, where did you find this plan? I've been looking everywhere for it!!" So I chatted a bit with him.
---
The other day I joined a group of chatty people and before I could mute them all, they were like HEEY I KNOW THIS GUY!! WE GO WAY BACK!!! (I assure you, I don't know them, and I wasn't who they thought I was LOL)... it was a funny interaction, this guy was chatting up two other strangers about how much he knew me and my entire life story and all. I finally muted them.   .... just here for the Builders extra XP ;)
---
I would love to have some kind of way to communicate though... so many players with some cool camps... OR when I find someone that has that ONE thing I've been searching a month for and I'm a few caps short, it would be awesome to just ask "Would you take this much for it? It's all I got!"
---
or a "DUDE THANKS FOR REVIVING ME AT THE LAST SECOND OF THIS BOSS BATTLE SO I COULD GET THE REWARD!! THANKS SOOOOOO MUCH!" 
---
but for the most part, I leave my mic off, headset off (I like my big speakers) and must people... most of the time they are just shrieking curse words over and over.
---
I lock doors for when I am dropping stuff for my son or people that way some assclown doesn't come in and steal it.
---
Wait, so people who got it from gamepass only got it for gamepass?
---
Because I‚Äôve been wanting this game for a pretty long time but never thought it was worth 60 bucks
---
Now it‚Äôs on gamepass, I have it
---
I only have one account, and dont believe in insulting people because I believe it shows the are unable to use logic and facts to support their ideals. Also 10 for all specials isnt bad, considering you can only have 3 special stats reach 15 in 76, base of course.
---
Check the kanawha county cemetery
---
Gloves?
---
Hey at least plasma bullets work. Took them a whole year to fix those fucking guns. I've mained heavy wepons since day 1.
---
This is mostly because people forget to put some kindle on the fire. The few that do it put wet kindle on it thay attracts more bugs and not dry, most think other will take care of it
---
Weapon bash stoped the reload for me which is why I don't use grenades.
---
Me too especially with loot drops because I have no other choice but to empty stash lol
---
It's all rng, I have two masks and one outfit. I sometimes go to the event when it pops up.
---
He blames you for me. I think that's hilarious. But as for insulting him, yeah I just got tired of seeing him on every post being a jerk so I thought I'd do the same and guess what? Now he's butthurt.
---
Wait till meat week second helping for the nice white looking lockers? The shit lockers are also a rare plan I think I got mine in watoga. Otherwise stop by peoples camps a lot of us buy the rares off grahm and mark them up. When I have the locker plans I tag them at 2500.
---
I am learning new things
---
Some  cosmetic outfits have gloves, some don't but they are not a separate cosmetic or functional slot.
---
I just moved my camp today for the first time in well over a year.  I moved to be within spitting distance of both a pond and clusters of brain fungus.  I also made sure to be well away from any random encounter points, so I don‚Äôt have to be bothered with enemies any more than I have to.
---
I‚Äôm not much of a builder, or at least it‚Äôs a low priority feature for me, so I made a small, open air, outpost-style camp with the essentials all easily accessible and clustered together.  I used to have this overwrought hotel that was nearly max budget, and this time I used less than 30% on the new place, including some decorations.  Walls and roof pieces take up a huge amount of budget.  Turrets are absolute shit, so I didn‚Äôt waste any budget on them.
---
I used to have a mix of all these goofy ‚Äúrare‚Äù items, the same ones every other long term player has, but I stuck with a grimy concrete and rusty metal survivalist theme.  I lost most of the trophies, clean items and cute crap, and it looks so much more cohesive and natural in the environment.  90% of the camp is made with the standard stuff that was in the base game at launch.
---
It‚Äôs 100x more convenient to live in, and by some miraculous accident I placed Sofia‚Äôs computer in a spot that confuses her AI.  She just stands in place near the back door and never says a word now.  That‚Äôs easily the best feature by a mile.
---
My game loads so much faster now and I don‚Äôt have to wait a full minute for my camp to show up when I travel there for the first time.
---
It‚Äôs fantastic.
---
How do you get those titles by your name? Like Enclave and stuff? Also its weird why he is so mean, I wouldn't think fallout fans were toxic.
---
be that guy and just sell it all of whatever possible to a Whitesprings robot vendor and make some peoples day üòÇ
---
No individual gloves for u 2 wear. Only outfits my guy. Unless u like ur gloves doing loads of damage and exploding things. Those this game has plenty off.
---
I just hate the name. It's fucking stupid and I can't believe it stuck. 
---
As a man who eats just about any ancient tin of shit I loot in the wilderness, food's absolutely irrelevant to me other than avoiding starvation and keeping an extra buff going. Even then, I don't care if I don't have well fed up and running. 
---
I'd argue there's just as many Cranberry relish chasing, bloodied-unyielded XP boosters who'd spend more time cooking than my alleged full health 'food' build.
---
You'll need it if the re-balance turns every mob into a bullet sponge.
---
I thought I was the only one due to lag. Happens a lot with gatling plasma, gatling laser and minigun.
---
It would make scrap vending more viable as well
---
Agreed.
---
Same I just have to interrupt the reload
---
Care to extrapolate on this harpoon build of yours? I'm intrigued...
---
Red dead 2 is a prequel so it‚Äôs actually better to play it first then play the first game
---
Building my camp is one of my favorite parts of the game. I've played many days not killing a single enemy while just working on my camp.
---
Did you only buy 1 month? If you did, you‚Äôd have received your atoms straight after the purchase. You won‚Äôt recieve more atoms once it runs out
---
Gatling gun too. Now that you mention it, it is incredibly obvious. It *is* lag.
---
Defending that kind of behavior is big incel energy, though. So don‚Äôt do it anyway.
---
I dont think people think like this, but you do you I guess
---
I usually mothman dance after events but I didn't even know that was a thing people did.  Though in all fairness I preordered the game and played for a few hours on release but got sidetracked by other games and a lack of friends playing 76 and just recently got back into it...Got back into it may be an understatement...started playing again about a month ago and cleared the legendary run last week and hit level 73 today....but I rarely see other people emote aside from the occasional person here or there mothman dancing after me
---
I have heard mention of one in the files but it sounded expensive. Alteratively we have the Symptomatic coming as a reward for Daily Ops in the next patch as well as the old sulfur fountain at the Whitesprings resort.
---
I don‚Äôt have any vending machines so you shouldn‚Äôt be at my camp therefore I lock my door
---
Ah... No. Maybe your comments are very downvote worthy
---
My Xbox just dash boarded because I read that.
---
Yes but instead we will be overwhelmed with the...there is nothing to do in this game, I‚Äôm bored...blah blah blah. 
---
We can never win lol
---
well dang would have been cool though
---
I'd like to remind that in 2 generations the BoS developed religious dogma reguarding the West Tech lab and largely forgot about Mariposa as their prior location. It's very easy to say even if the coming BoS learn about the Enclave and find a way to tell Lost Hills the BoS main group could forget about them or the file gets lost in their collection.
---
Just pretend we are NPCs
---
I hope we get the PA display racks soon.
---
You would get the next second set of atoms when your first subscription runs out.
---
The Mega Red Rocket station on the north end with the worksop is a tricky spot.  I became wanted for grabbing scrap from a desk because the workshop was owned.  No picking of the lock, and if there was a warning I was about to steal something, I didn't notice it.  It registered it as theft!
---
Since then, I don't scavenge that area unless the workshop is unowned.
---
I was using my primed bloodied Minigun at A Colossal Problem last night.   Windigos we‚Äôre giving me back 120-145 ultracite 5mm rounds.  Started with 4400 rounds, ended with 5400 rounds.  That includes the damage I did against Earl...which wasn‚Äôt more 25% of his total health.  
---
I think this will follow through into Daily Ops missions.  Minigun isn‚Äôt always the most efficient weapon, but it‚Äôs always fun. Just something to think about.
---
I know, it's so annoying. My gatlings reloads themselves when still have 750, 820, 150, 350, 420, 94 rounds in the cores.  I have died more than a couple of times due to that.
---
Having just done that quest.... GREAT idea.
---
you get the atoms at the beginning of your month, not the end.
---
&gt; you can't really steal anything
---
Not quite. Crops can be 'stolen', if you want to call it that. And since they're not a container like other resources, they can't be locked away unless you have them all indoors on the farmable floor tiles, and then lock your doors.  
---
Seen plenty of people do this, although I don't do this myself.
---
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt have doors , nobody disappoints me
---
But we all have lag. ü§£ü§£ Bethesda should fix that.
---
The Vault is coming back, the raids are not, at least from what I've seen.
---
I get a problem when I'm fighting Earl, where my handmade just keeps firing after I release the trigger. It'll do this through 2 , 30 round mags usually
---
I would only care if it reduced the price on modules. which it doesn‚Äôt. These sales are pointless to me.
---
Idk I kinda like the whole "voice chat only" thing because it's gotten a lot more people to actually use their mics.  Online gaming has been feeling a bit lonely the past couple years as people seem to talk less and less but I've noticed a lot more verbal communication in this game.  Still not as much as their used to be in online games but it's an upward trend in 76.  I feel like if they added text chat people would be a lot less vocal again
---
We all can do without the teabagging. Sorry about your tiny penis I guess?
---
I mean... if they did I would cool with it! üòÇ
---
Lol could have been the gauss shotgun you can purchase after settler runs
---
What's really weird is when they go down to zero, start to reload themselves, but the number of shots has gone up to 263 or some other random number as soon as the animation starts. If I switch weapons to cancel the reload and switch back, those shots stay, but no cores have been used. I've been able to repeat this several times with increasingly fewer shots each time until it goes to zero and stays at zero, usually requiring a manual reload, at which point it actually uses a core.
---
I've also had this happen with a tesla rifle, .50 cal, amd grenade launcher. I've actually been able to get the grenade launcher to fire two shots per reload because of this.
---
Stop telling me what to do dad! If I want to spend my time begging for b2525 fixers from complete rando‚Äôs hanging outside the vault I will. If I want to take stims and chems from the creepy moth man cultist down the hill I will. If I want to spam every stranger to hold my hand through the wasteland and solve all my problems for me I will. Your passive aggressive note on the cork board here won‚Äôt stop me from finding my post apocalyptic sugar daddy.
---
Ah. That makes sense.
---
You also have to realize you'll be off somewhere seemingly solo doing missions. And you load back into Appalachia from a building in your missions. There will be active events that weren't there before.. This is how I fought my first scorchbeast at level 30 an event not for me but that I was stuck in. Some high levels saved me mid fight. We all never said a word, and left. Take the help if youre over your head, then afterwards leave. There's no need to communicate think of them as npcs spawned to help.
---
Nanotechnology.
---
I've never played NW and this happens to me...
---
Aesthetics.  It's my house, doors should be locked.  I know my bed is next to an open window and you can get in by sitting on it, you can see there's nothing in there but still people do it for I-don't-know-why reasons xD
---
&gt; Me and a handful of friends used to team up and go take out people at workshops.
---
Thank fucking God I got a private server. Nothing worse just trying to play the damn game and 4 assholes just roll up and kill you.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt expect anything less from this username.
---
ITT: Insecure people who probably need to go to therapy.
---
As a level 365, I assure you high level players like seeing lower level people. We like helping you, you‚Äôre not a bother at all. Like not at all. And I don‚Äôt expect a thing out of you when I see you at an event. I like feeling like I helped you get a good weapon or plan after carrying you through the event. I was once the dude at an event just barely doing any damage and hoping a higher level would kill things so I could get xp. Like you said, we just appreciate when a low level doesn‚Äôt beg or ask us to trade...that‚Äôs the only thing that bugs me.
---
Maestro, sry to hear about your bad experience and leeryness about grouping. Have you thought of reaching out to different groups on discord, or in xbox lfg (I put that in there bc I know you can link your xbox account to your pc)? There are ways to get yourself into a group of decent people. 
---
On the other hand, the game can still be enjoyable running solo. It does get tedious though, and you'll be surprised at how fun a group can be. It is still possible to solo most of the game but certain events you definitely need a group.
---
This needs to happen.
---
&gt; But once its a possible viable legendary item, the drama is going to get interesting.
---
That's precisely why area loot should've been enabled at the same time as One Wasteland. Now that every legendary drop is max level, it's going to lead to even more frustration and toxicity when people miss out. It exacerbates an already persistent problem.
---
I don't really want to see the Enclave pushed too hard considering what we know of them in the future. Most I'd be interested in seeing is maybe a future DLC where MODUS pushes us to explore/reconnect with Raven Rock and we see how Eden took control there. Maybe we are even the ones who help him do it.
---
What's your psn?
---
Yep yep
---
Whelp, that sucks. I was also on a trip this weekend, so that kinda blows.
---
My old camp was in the middle of the desert area that shows as a big lake on the map but when you get there it's more of a small river (can't remember the name of the area off the top of my head) and I used to have to find a new map at least once or twice with each log in despite it being literally in the middle of nowhere with the only thing of value nearby being water which is everywhere throughout the map.  My current camp is built on a lead deposit on a cliff with an amazing view...havent had to look for a new world a single time yet....i don't get it but not complaining.  I think they should register player camp locations when matchmaking servers and automatically put you in one that doesn't have your spot in use.  seems like a simple concept that should already be in game but who knows maybe they tried that and it caused more issues than it was worth
---
They think we have no life except fo76 becuse same thing happened to me I offered food water ammo stim packs weapons armor and gave them about 2,000 caps worth of items just to be called a ugly sun of a gun and to go delete the game becuse low levels should be able to play alone.
---
That would be interesting
---
I keep mine utilitarian and in ghoul spawn point in whitespring  to many Martha Stewart‚Äôs in the game already lol
---
I swap between a .50 and a mini in ACP. The .50 cal is for the Wendigos and the Mini is for Earle.
---
For the horde! Love this idea!
---
Just respawn or don't fight, u can't get butthurt about all ur losses
---
I‚Äôve never had an airport completed challenge. I‚Äôve had challenges that didn‚Äôt register for five minutes but none that completed themselves.
---
I dunno. ATLAS updated, but the site hasn‚Äôt.
---
Teabagging makes u a racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, woman hater? Damn fr
---
Still doesn't mean you need to be an ass in game or real life
---
Absolutely fair! It's a bit silly they wouldn't also put those on sale for the amount of work that does go into earning it.
---
That 90 for Fuel is so beautiful.
---
As a level 200, I still get nervous when around 300+
---
Nah u can do it infinitely
---
I'm only toxic on my lvl 6, I've been called about every slur I can think of by high lvls, they fear the non legendary auto pipe rifle
---
Yep, I did Deathclaw Island and the Abandoned Waste Dump today for the challenge. I was on a private server, so fortunately I didn't have to worry about someone killing them before I got there.
---
Don't try to go in my basement or generator room.
---
‚ÄúIncel‚Äù means ‚Äúinvoluntarily celebate‚Äù. And defending that kind of behavior makes you look like a video game try hard. Which is largely associated with being an incel.
---
Ah great idk waht happened why it greyed out but I just reset the app it‚Äôs g now thanks
---
Look up HONK world
---
The metas are all about to change in a week. One Wastelanders is gonna shake up everything.
---
Yea it's based on the new incoming rads if that's what you mean.
---
10/31 *twenty-four seven*
---
If you know you're toxic then why not change
---
That seems annoying. Well thanks for the info
---
I put in all the leather I can and have been banking my scrip for a week.
---
Honestly just a MODUS monitor for a camp vendor is just asking to be made.
---
Yes.  It will reduce the amount of dailies you need to do for them to unlock bullion plans.
---
Yup
---
I think my record is three at AWOL.  I‚Äôve gotten four at Heart of the Swamp, but that particular server was showering me with legendaries the whole time.  It‚Äôs rare when that happens, and I‚Äôll stay on that kind of server for as long as possible.
---
In a year? There's too many updates to count. I'd suggest reading every Inside the Vault update and going back from the latest until you get bored.
---
It could take a whole paragraph just to explain one wasteland coming up! Much less BoS, daily ops, legendary run, purveyor, legendary perks, wastelanders dlc, secret service equipment, gold bullion... i hope you get where I'm going with this :)
---
This bug singlehandedly made my change my build midway through from heavy weapons to shotguns because I hated it so much, it's so aggravating
---
IIRC MODUS killed the Enclave members because they tried to destroy him and the research, which meant they were in violation of their orders and Enclave directives, making them a threat to the Enclave.

Good luck with your report!
---
I used to not care about my camp when i first started but as i played more and spent more time there due to the free fast travel and having all the crafting benches and stash boxes in one area i started spending more time in it and wanted it to look nice and organized.  I definitely get what you mean about having to search for the vendors in player camps though.  I always keep mine in a separate building, usually the shed thing from the atom shop, and it's almost always right out in front with blinking lights and a vault boy cut-out pointing to it
---
Well I did have both legs blown off in the bog
---
Yeah I figured it would be ridiculous to list out all the new content and changes. Thanks for the help though, I guess I'll start reading up!
---
Yep. Annoying. You nailed it.
---
If you see a higher level doing the "give gift" emote, then stans6 there and BE PATIENT.
---
They have lots of good stuff and they are making you a care package. Give them time to go through all that good stuff!
---
Take the munitions factory
---
Have you even read the TOS? Most of it is related to the technical side but can equally be related to gameplay. There's a difference between occasional 'fun' and being an abusive idiot. 
---
Zenimax retain the right to act if any player should "Take any action...that is harmful, tortuous, abusive, hateful...offensive, obscene, threatening, bullying, vulgar,..."
---
Yup but does I happen out of vats as well? I mostly use vats so haven't noticed without vats
---
lol but will it appear in my own feed though?? Wow.. jokes are deemed evil nowadays.. I truly do live in pansy world.
---
They don't even have Bog Town spelled right in the challenge; the challenge spells it Bogtown.
---
Yes! Thank you for being the ore guy! I feel like no one understands the ore side of rad rumble. And while we‚Äôre at it, can people PLEASE stop repairing the turrets during line in the sand?? All that does is rob everyone of xp!
---
just outside pleasant valley station.
---
Because it‚Äôs the only thing the poor fella has going for him
---
I totally thought there would be more to it and was so bummed there wasn‚Äôt!
---
By Bethesda's own admission both the most highly requested feature &amp; not a priority for them, according to an interview with MassivelyOP.
---
True the gatling plasma and laser cores are so annoying.. So many almost empty cores..
---
Their camp, their choice. No justification required.
---
I've been pvping since beta and I've gotten atleast 500 of those "reported" messages, care to explain? I never mentioned using slurs, which I get thrown at me a lot actually by the pve community, I've been called a hard r atleast 50 times.
---
Bethesda if you don‚Äôt implement this idea into the game, I will take a tenderizer to your beloved mr. jangles‚Äô jinglers.
---
You've got a thing for rape, haven't you?
---
Holy shit that Ultracite .308 amount. I might finally be able to use my LMG for more than just Earle and the Queen.
---
Pretty much just a bunch of flechette harpoon guns (a few barbed just because). Most with 90% reduced weight and since cursed already has weight reduction, good fit.  It's not really a serious build, it's just for fun.
---
Don't come to a workshop or stay in pacifist, problem solved
---
Well said :)
---
Team death match? Like nuclear winter? Just messing with you.
---
There's a road east of the bog that has tunnels under it that you can build in, it's pretty cool.
---
Abby's body still hasn't been found. So maybe the free states could come back.
---
Only food builds and everyone who tries to fight me ;)
---
Raids are being turned into daily ops
---
Had this happen to me in NW last night. Had 8 shots left in my assault rifle and the gun tried to reload. If it would have fired those shots I would have lived.
---
This is a major problem that needs to be fixed.
---
Pretty sure it hasn't been $60 for a long while plenty of places to find it at a lower price if so, I managed to snag a copy out of a redbox when they decided they were getting rid of games for $8.
---
There is the "guide to returning" which is linked at the top of the page on the desktop site... [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
I run an instigating/ffr/25%vats cost lever action.
---
Full SS armor, all unyielding minus 1 chameleon piece.
---
Short of bosses or things like a sb or behemoth, everything loses its head in one shot.
---
And with for and vats reduction...I'll drop 5 creatures really fast. Works well.
---
Lol it's funny, and I'm never the first "toxic one" I go around as a lvl 5 and PvP lvl 50+ players for the sole purpose of seeing them be toxic, it's funny to me.
---
No u
---
Bruh you didn't even do the enclave arch that's in 76 why do you need another one
---
Teabagging is mildly hilarious- griefing I can't accept sorry. 
---
I don't believe chasing someone from one side of the map to the other who's probably in pacifist who doesn't *want* to fight you would definitely be in breach. 
---
However what some people call 'griefing' sort of isn't. People in workshops are totally fair game. I don't care what they're doing, if you volunteer to claim that shit you sign a waiver imo. 
---
I've never attacked anyone in a workshop, however in public server I 100% expect to be attacked. 
---
Bounties too. If you break into people's shit someone will want to hunt you for the extra dimension to their game.
---
If this bug is the one causing my 3* Bloodied Double Barrel shotgun to occasionally reload and have a (usable) magazine size of 255 and no cool down timer between shots, don't you ever fucking fix it, Bethesda. That gun shreds everything in its path. "Oh hi Scorchbeast Queen. Say, what's wrong with your healthbar? Oh, ok bye"
---
It has also happened a couple times on my 3* Bloodied Combat Shotgun, which is still cool but less important.
---
Lol if u wanna tell urself that then sure
---
Reasonable
---
The lack of mods is actually a benefit come p22.  Mods that add damage are taking a net loss, and the heavy barrel on the 50 didn‚Äôt add much so it‚Äôs relatively unchanged.  Hardened receivers on sniper rifles and revolvers got hit hard.
---
But the other guy doesn‚Äôt play on the pts
---
Nah, it'll be fine. It'd be too much of a a PR disaster to allow it to fail. Gives fuel to people saying the player base is dying off.
---
Scaring away new money is Bethesda's worst nightmare.
---
If your using so many meds running a silo your gear probably ain't worth having.
---
Safe to say it's worth it to come back since there's so much new stuff to enjoy. There's even human NPCs now! 
---
I skipped a year from March 2019 and came back in March 2020. For me, it felt like there were tons added and much I've missed out on. Since then, they've added (or will imminently add) much, much more.
---
Thx for the info
---
I agree I think I might have said something like this before idk if it was on here I mean there are still the cabins in whitesprings what if some enclave are in there or something also where there‚Äôs the brotherhood there should be enclave
---
My ally always wants to use whichever crafting station I try to use.
---
I never stopped playing because I didn't like the game, I was just busy and played other things, but I have always wanted to come back since the NPC update. I'm excited to play the new stuff but it seems like people have optimized builds so much I'm going to be so lost if I don't do a ton of research
---
Don't forget Mal'Ganis although I haven't played in awhile maybe there's not as many.
---
Maybe so if so that be neat
---
a few weeks ago, stacking was really easy, wish I had got the bug in me to build it then, so I had to use the older stacking method that requires nearby hillside to get the stacks.  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/hF6h5oV.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/hF6h5oV.jpg)  
---
placement order is the number on the brick... essentially get them stacked by rooting one in terrain that is higher than the first tier, use 2x ramp foundations to get the height right(not shown)  
---
If you don't want to have the mountainside attachment foundation blocks, there are tricks with the ramp foundation orphaning them out floating... once orphaned though, they can't be changed unless you reattach them to the mountainside...   
---
Basically now, the stack height limit is the related to the terrain you plant your camp at.
---
These events auto complete even if no one donates.
---
lol.. I was gonna say..
---
every time I need to move a bench or one of their stations they are hard at work with it
---
Well when the only way to have "clans" or "factions" is to use Discord, and Discord has much better voice quality than 76 and most other online games (looking at you Rainbow Six Siege), and people use open-mic all the time with the bad voice quality complete with background screaming, chip munching, and other mouth noises... Some people just want to play in peace and are considerate enough to not subject everyone around them to their banter.
---
But wait for the "big nerf" coming...
---
Don‚Äôt forget the low level newborns clutching their dicks hiding in the corner of events waiting for all the icky fighting to stop then spamming trade to every high level player as if them simply being there entitles them to loot.  ‚ÄúI did nothing to earn this, but it‚Äôs only fair you share!‚Äù
---
not what i was asking
---
Can you explain alittle more.  What do mean ended?  Like you cancalled?
---
I use one of my weaker weapons until she mutates, then I break out my Junkie's LMG and unload until she's at about 20% health and let everyone else finish her off. That seems like it gives the best chance for everyone to do enough damage to earn the rewards.
---
You cannot fail these events. They auto complete.
---
Do you do somthing or is it random cuz I'm not tryna get banned lol
---
Can't agree more.
---
Idk if there is a method or its random
---
I won't lol
---
That is by far the worst way to get ammo....
---
I'm so confused üòÇ
---
Run for the exit once for the experience but otherwise stay &amp; loot.
---
Absolutely, yes - make sure you've also done all the Raider missions up to that point as well
---
Seems to be random, a guy on here the other day was up to 1.6 million atoms.
---
They made the Slocum Joe Vendor...they can make a MODUS vendor.
---
How do you get the raider missions? I only have the daily mission when I go there
---
My god!
---
Go off meta with like a food hybrid build. Food heavy PA works great for me.
---
Add a thriller emote and Im there!
---
98% of the FO76 community are sweethearts or at the very least just concerned about their own game.  It is SOOOOO rare to find someone being a jerk since most of them have been weeded out by Bethesda taking out most of the PVP options since we just didn't want them.  (Even in Nuclear Winter most of us are bush huggers who you won't even see until we are forced out of cover.)
---
You do belong in the game.  The map is there for you to explore, regardless of how good you are.  It took me a long time to get over that paranoia, but once I experienced someone being annoying (shooting at me, and another dropped one of those punji board triangle traps on me while I was trying to take a photo of their obvious trap CAMP), I realized that I didn't have to respond and if I was killed, I just lost some replaceable junk and it was no big deal.  Especially after I blocked them.  lol
---
Please keep in mind that most higher level players love the sense of community we can achieve while playing and absolutely LOVE helping lower level players.  Play the game.  Go to workshops.  Take an unclaimed workshop.  Go to events (stick to lower level ones in the Forest, Toxic Valley, and Ash Heap until you're higher level) and, if someone else is there, just watch how they do the event and help kill things (also read the text on the loading screen so you know what you're supposed to be doing).
---
When I first started, I felt much the same way as you but then I realized I wasn't accomplishing anything in the game so I hunkered down and focused on learning the public events until I became familiar enough with the pattern that I could then focus on the best way to complete the task.  Now I join everything--though I do have my favorites like Distinguished Guests, Jail Break, Tea Time, and Campfire Tales--and at the very least try to get some shots on the boss and take out ads so I'm being useful.
---
Lastly, you can't be an "entitled annoying low level" unless you're hounding us for high level special gear and free ammo all the time.  At the very least, if you do want help making or modding something, be sure to have the materials the person needs to complete the job (I even made my husband give me the materials to make/mod him some weapons, armor, and the decontamination arch.) so you're not completely leeching off them.
---
Hello pal, there was a weirdo following her about being a bit of a creep haha thought it was you when I saw the post. Not sure if it was me that helped but my tag is the same as this without the numbers, add me and have a game with us.
---
Did you talk with Megs? Did you do any of the Vault 79 Raider missions (like get Lou, rescue Ra-Ra &amp; do the Arena thing down in Watoga)?
---
I had this issue with a fallout 1st monthly renew.  I didn't get my stoms when It renewed like 5 days ago.  Emailed bethesda support with the steam transaction ID and within a few hours had my atoms.
---
Put them on the Weapons or Armor they belong to. Or scrap them. That's pretty much it.
---
Well, nobody was supposed to come back to Appalachia at all, but there are people now. Just because the originals of all factions in the game died, doesn‚Äôt mean now they can‚Äôt be reformed or come back for whatever reason
---
I had to help my low level friend and he never had any meds
---
They need to fix it when you pull it out for me it's always in 3 separate pieces same with the pump action shotgun then after a quick second it just reconnects
---
The image is just buffing forever for me, what is the ultracite [50.cal](https://50.cal) amounts please ?
---
not trying to be critical, I really do want to try it. Just a little ocd thing of some spelling errors in the document, but I'm not sure if they are intentional. See you out in the wasteland fellow pc player
---
Yes definitely not you. He was a right odd ball with a mic
---
Well, secret's out... now Bethesda will try and fix it again.
---
I think I‚Äôve done the first 2 but not the arena thing
---
Pint sized slasher has a set of gloves with the outfit
---
I think you can sell them at vendors as well.
---
Wait, that means all but any character below level 5-10 are affected if mods count as one of those damage modifiers?
---
That's the mission with Johnny....I believe that's the last one before the decision point for the Raiders.
---
Do you have to go to grafton steel to get Ra-Ra?
---
Well if u look at them they go to certain weapons or armor pieces. When ur at work bench and go to mod said weapon or armor piece it will show up In the mod section to put on them. 
---
It also Depends on what they are. Look up the ones u have and see if they rare or sought after if u don‚Äôt use them and get rid of rest. You can learn the plans more often than not for the common ones.
---
No - not fixed.
---
Sell them to vendor bots or scrap them for materials.
---
Yes. And be incredibly nice to her.
---
Looks like he got up to 3.6 million, Bethesda wiped his account of all atoms, even the ones he did buy, and lost all wallpapers too, can't link it but if you search atom doubling at the top of this community youll see several posts.
---
Ah that‚Äôs the mission I‚Äôm doing now
---
What the fuck? I took a week off cause I finished my legendary run and miss a camp item I would have liked
---
So I have to keep them in my inventory if I want to use that when I create new guns?
---
I use a JE Gatling plasma and I usually have about 250-300 rounds with a fully charged fusion core, I‚Äôll get the ammo down to about 120 and my character immediately starts to reload. It‚Äôs so annoying that I try not to even use them anymore
---
I used to have that issue and compared to now, I miss that.  At least then they were doing something.  Now the only time I see movement in my camp is when another player comes for the vendors or a traveling merchant shows up....and uses the stations or sleeps in my bed
---
I want one of the Modus programmed Assaultrons from Bots on Parade as a Collectron.
---
So for heavy guns are you recommending 1 in the ones like heavy gunner and 3 in bloody mess?
---
Ask brad Pitt
---
GET OUT OF THE DAMN DOORWAY LYDIA!
---
At no point do I ever expect this game to actually reload when I have actually run out of bullets, when it decides it's time.. it's time
---
Sure. x450 for normal and x900 for Ultracite, big numbers.
---
Its a good idea but likely won't happen. Likely something about game balance and having an excuse to go look for things and it being too easy..
---
Or whatever internal justification they have for it.
---
Yes! The enclave will be victorious!
---
Shut the door,lock it.
---
You can.
---
Yeah, and I play commando! üòÅ
---
Wishful thinking, but it wont be much if a collectron if its an assaultron.
---
The 50 allows you to fire with complete control, starts and stops immediately, and has good accuracy and range.  The downside is that it‚Äôs good at everything, but not great at any single task.  You can tap single shots against distant enemies or mow through a swarm of ghouls, but it‚Äôs not as good as a plasma caster or minigun for either job.  Ammo is easy to conserve (assuming good legendary effects) and reasonable cheap to produce.
---
The minigun is better versus big enemies, bosses and tightly packed swarms.  The downside is that you can‚Äôt heal or swap weapons until the barrels stop spinning completely.  The accuracy is not great beyond 10-20 meters, unless you‚Äôre shooting the side of a barn.  You tend to waste ammo while swinging around to engage loosely gathered, quick or smaller enemies.  Stingwings and wendigo are a PITA with a minigun.  If Earle is all up in your grill, it‚Äôs perfect.  It‚Äôs kind of an ammo hog, but 5mm is cheap and readily available.
---
I personally use a junkie/explosive 50 as my ‚Äúdaily driver‚Äù.  I round out the arsenal with a j/ffr gauss mini for bosses and a j/10 plasma caster for long range.  All are 90% RW.  I use the 50 at least 80% of the time, and could probably lose the caster if needed.  I dislike the spin up on rotary guns, especially after grinding V94, but the DPS on the gauss mini is hard to ignore.
---
Yea think of them as one time use upgrades. U can put them in ur stash if u have space but I‚Äôm telling u a lot are just trash that take up space and u should juts sell them or scrap them. Look at them and see if u have those weapons or armors or if u think you‚Äôll use them in future . Save those get rid of rest
---
But they did fix it!
---
But then they put it back in.
---
And then they fixed it again.
---
And then they fixed it!
---
This shit has been going on for well over a year now.
---
The enclave shall be victorious
---
Lazer rifles form supers and watoga high school
---
I'd like to plant pumpkins:)
---
Watago high school and Morgantown high school
---
Thats a shame. If they could implement it in a non intrusive way(maybe a pip boy tab?) People could communicate in game rather then on a 3rd party site.
---
It'd definitely be a good idea, have tree stumps to grow firecap or glowing resin on. I'd probably also never use them, I make the easier savage divide disease cures and use mappalachia to point me to the places of dense glowing resin. Although if I could plant them all at workshops and spam turbo furt I'd be all over that.
---
Watoga highschool. Everywhere on the tables, server hop to get more.
---
What is symptomatic?
---
Brawl? You've forgotten how the Wayward deal with troublemakers.
---
Dude it's 11:30pm here, I laughed way to loud considering I've got kids asleep in the next room. üòÇü§£üòÇü§£
---
Me and my buddy made a camp arena at my camp where people fist fight for prizes. Lol
---
One of the reasons I like 76 is I play solo but can mingle when I want.......tbf after 1038 hours I still don't have anyone in my friends list so the group finder has been good for me.
---
I just south of george junkyard is a road and i build a raider road base there barricades on both sides of a bridge and a little house tucked under the bridge. Pain to build but turned out okay.
---
On the map its a little "64" road sign
---
Did you just do one side's quests? The overseer practically *begged* you to help both sides for a reason.

the open mic eating and kinect quality mics where you hear everything in the background including their parents yelling at them to take out the garbage are annoying but they've become a part of gaming that I had gotten used to.  especially being a former xbox player.  my friends would always want to stay in party chat and I'd be the one wanting to socialize with randoms because if i stayed in parties all the time and never in game chat i wouldn't have met them in the first place.  I get why it bothers people but ive tuned all the minor annoyances out.  though to be fair i grew up with 4 younger siblings so it takes a lot to annoy me.  I just miss how social gaming used to be.
---
Imho the guy who one shots the queen needs to gtfo the public servers, such dweebs
---
I‚Äôve never used these just sell them at vendors. I‚Äôm sure some are worth using I just don‚Äôt usually care to try.
---
The farmable plant list seems very incomplete. While I could see them locking out stuff like Firecaps that seem to need specialized equipment (see the agricultural center), other plants like Pumpkins, Cranberries and Siltbeans are shown to be cultivated by laymen. There needs to be a serious farming update.
---
WestTec runs and scrap the laser rifles. Plus you get legendary spawns a fair bit
---
It's almost two full boxes for the .50 MG, this is going to be great.
---
Yes please.
---
Yes...
---
Two words. Game Pass
---
That's pretty shirty they wiped him for their mistake but also its Bethesda so
---
900 Ultracite .50 rounds
---
Whitesprings isn't the legendary or flux components farm it used to be, I hardly ever see nukes dropped there anymore. I'm lucky to get more than two legendaries there now.
---
same here on xbox.  i got to the point where he disappears going through the door out to the prison yard.  i quickly follow him... end up outside with all the super mutes but no damn guard bot!  he just up and disappeared.  What a waste of time!
---
Everything you need to know.

---
I vant to suck your blood.....they better add a Vampire pyjamas skin.
---
I understand what you are saying and it would be fun but I don‚Äôt think it will happen because the monster mash event is pretty much exactly what you are describing and has halloween candy as a reward. I would definitely like something spooky themed though. Like throwing in a ghost or something along those lines. People forget there were ghost in fallout 4 so why not a haunted house or something in 76. West Virginia has places that are reported to be some of the most haunted places in the world.
---
It still has "tron" in it's name like the Protectron üòè
---
ty
---
Yeah pretty great way to be rewarded for reporting a massive screwup on their part.
---
Do you know where? I'm interested
---
I‚Äôd say pick a side and head into 79. My main chose a side right off the bat...my alt ground max rep for both sides. If I could do it over, I‚Äôd chose a side right away with my alt also. Kind of sucks grinding out all that rep, running the vault and not being able to purchase the stuff I want right away. Yeah, you can keep the thousand from the vault raid, but after that is spent I have no treasury notes stocked up to exchange for bullion...Personally I think it‚Äôs kind of stupid that you don‚Äôt earn treasury notes until after you‚Äôve run the vault. GL man
---
Nice I've been farming flux for weeks up to 1100 violet gunna try and hold on to them for the future.
---
Hah,you got me there.
---
I'm not sure if it's a challenge but I still don't have the achievement for reaching level 10 and I'm currently level 49. Like how the fuck do you break that. Imagine it's a similar thing to the challenge problem
---
Search on YouTube stealth boy farming, one of the thumbnails says 32 locations, something like that.  One of the locations is in th cranberry bog along route 65.  It's just south of abandoned bog town.
---
Agree totally.
---
Theres so many semi-rare ingredients that are a pain to find. Making stuff like Berry Mentats helps me max crafting durability etc so I tend to like to farm my own aid items.
---
Not to mention, making different foods is kinda fun sometimes and breaks the monotony of dailies etc.
---
Following Season 1 and all my new *play* time, I've switched to completing the Pioneer Scout challenges and the cooking line only makes having these ingredients on hand very relevant.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve done a few for the raiders after but only the ones on the mission to get things sorted for breaking into the vault, I think the last one I did was getting that ghoul to not kill himself and help
---
no, you can‚Äôt. And, if you want to take advantage of the special legendary perks when they come out, the stats you buff shouldn‚Äôt be higher than 10 for this same reason
---
Thx.
---
Naked and afraid.......
---
Last November was the only one that I remember.  I got three great fixers during that sale.  Epic.
---
Oh man that‚Äôs awesome! Are you xb1? I‚Äôd love to check that out
---
Really I dont care about the damage nerf. My characters already op I'm just so goddamn excited for one wasteland and season 2 that I will probably just ignore it.
---
Clans yes, emblems yes, ability to put emblems on clothes no. I don't want guys with bigass swastikas strolling around, reminds me of BO2 where half of the emblems were racist and half were sexual
---
They are "one-and-done" upgrades. Personally, unless they are Scout Armor mods, they should be scrapped.
---
So basically only have say 3 level 3 perks and nothing else?
---
Ah, good deal! Thanks for the info!
---
Yessir!
---
A guy started Encryptid and killed the Imposter Sheepsquatch as soon as the shields dropped. Half of us didn't even get loot from it. Then he launched a nuke within 10 minutes on the queen. Thankfully for that he was using a cryolator to slow her down rather than his magic gun, so maybe he was actually considerate after all the Angry and No emotes he got at Encryptid.
---
Gatling plasma uses plasma cores, gatling laser uses fusion cores
---
I don't know what they were thinking when they chose concrete. Even if you farm all of Appalachia you would barely have enough for 1 ATLAS case. 90 minutes of farming for 2 stimpaks, some radaway and a few bottles of booze.
---
The special legendary perks add card slots for those stats, so you‚Äôll effectively still have 15, but it can‚Äôt boost you over 15 slots
---
I totally get what you mean, I get like that sometimes. but a vast majority of the people I meet are great, they throw me a bunch of plans and recipes and help me greatly, and a lot don't mind carrying a little bit in events. As long as you don't join a collosal problem or something it's fine. Only reason I say that is that ACP only allows 8 people per instance so a low level joining takes the place of a high level that could have contributed more as it's a bloody difficult fight. But generally, high levels are more than happy to help, and they're often way nicer than you think.
---
Thats what I was thinking but he probably bought evrything so that might be the reason
---
Is it too late tho?
---
Scrap PA pieces too! Good source for sure
---
I don't know why people never suggest this but Whitesprings Golf Balls. Go to the little putting green round the corner and up the hill from the back entrance. Hoover up the 40+ balls there. No effort. No enemies. Easy.
---
You can upgrade a card in a maxed out special whilst leveling, by selecting a different special category and when it shows you a card to select tab over to the maxed special. You can't equip more than 15 worth of cards though.
---
Like The Battle That Never Was up at Prickett's Fort?
---
I think it needs to be triggered
---
Yes yes yes
---
My 5.56 is already selling slower thanks to these pricks and their annoying ammo factories. Then the legendary run stopped so it sells even slower. This is it. This will kill my business.
---
I am going to buy all the legendary mods I can carry and finally get some decent armor if everything goes to plan.
---
Then if you had max ammo smith and max ammo factory wouldnt it be better to not use super super as youd get less?
---
don‚Äôt worry tho, you can stock up on a couple of levels to rearrange your ‚Äúnatural‚Äù specials once they come out - it doesn‚Äôt need to affect your build today
---
AngryyTurtle! He has really in-depth videos
---
I feel like I'm one of the only people that use a mic, but usually someone starts using one in the party after I keep talking and asking questions lol
---
Under lvl 50...once a special hits rank 15. You can no more pick cards in that special. But over lvl 50 you can pick back new cards and combine cards in that specific special.
---
I hope bethesda actually do this
---
If you're not bugging for help just try not to worry about it. If they're helping you on their own accord it's because they decided they want to, not because you're imposing.
---
Most people assume at this point that any low level has at least a 75% chance of being a veteran player who started a new character anyway.
---
I like the Silver Shroud coat with the Chinese Stealth Suit Helmet. It looks straight out of Daft Punk.
---
It can be jarring but in my experience it'll lead to some of the funniest and best moments youll have with a game. Also makes communication so much easier, although sometimes it can get a bit hectic with everyone talking over one another
---
People actually thinking this is ok lmao.
---
I've having trouble finding it. Do you have a link
---
Definitely gonna be the first perk legendaries ima max out
---
I didn‚Äôt really understand builds until now and now I do I‚Äôm maxed outüòÇ
---
Not sure. I collected several of each kind. I can remember putting all of the pieces in display cases, and realized they were all the same size. Saved me case space...i sold the extra.
---
Still would make more sense the bos also how do I join the enclave not in game but the thing next to the name
---
Ah, I'd say once both sides say "side with", raid the vault.
---
Yeah there's theories about how to get it and why it does that but I've tried just about every way of getting it, curing it, not curing it, etc and so far no good.
---
Ah so when I get to level 50 I can start buying new ones but I just have to take out one that I already have?
---
Sure
---
Install the text chat mod, you'll be making friends and interacting with other players in no time.
---
Thanks, these videos look pretty good. I'll check them out
---
Exactly !
---
Ok thank you
---
What's the take up rate with that? I'm concerned I'll be talking into the echo chamber of players who don't have it installed?
---
That‚Äôs good then because I‚Äôm level 49üòÇ
---
https://youtu.be/bAkTS8QsW_A

Time: 5:30 keep walking down the tunnel.  You'll know the cool part when you get there.
---
Thx so much
---
1/3 chance of circling around Tanagra Town
---
If you're on pc I can help you find it
---
I get this bug with my gatling gun and my .50cal but they both go to 333 ammo despite having 250 capacity magazines
---
I think you are over thinking this. It is JUST a game. Do the main quest and Wastelanders quest and you will soon be a high level as well.
---
Ive always assumed we'd get 5 star legendaries eventually.
---
No and it won't ever be fixed. Despite being one of the most annoying bugs in the game, it's clearly not a priority to them given that it's been there since the beta.
---
Guess the truth hurts.
---
YES!
---
I'd rather existing weapons get new mods than new weapons get added.
---
I mean a mod can almost make a weapon feel new anyway. Plus it's probably easier to implement and fleshes out the existing content (instead of adding new weapons and making the existing content feel unfinished).
---
What in the goddamn..
---
I saw it. Can you even build down there?
---
Yeah, you can
---
Ok good I thought this was just me. My handmade always reloads at 7 rounds left when I hold the trigger and tap the crit button
---
Ok,
---
Go on the sub
---
3 dots at the top left (if you're on mobile)
---
Tap on that
---
"Change user flair"
---
Tap "Enclave" 
---
long live the Enclave
---
Sounds like you know what you're doing wrong and didn't need to post, which is probably why you deleted it. No need to be toxic ever
---
I think each faction has 3 quests you can complete before the game says you have to choose. You can do all 6 but have to pick. Grinding for max rep with the one you didn't pick is so boring.
---
Trade only
---
Huh. I think I've only found gat plasmas so makes sense I haven't seen something use the fusions. Ty for the reply
---
Western Outfit w/chaps has gloves with it.
---
K thanks. Not sure if I want to build there. Was really hoping for a flat road in a foresty area but thx a lot tho
---
Any proof of this, or is it a "people are saying" theory?
---
Damn and they pulled peoples fallout 1st subscription, took away all access to the atom shop and the legendary run, what total horseshit, they had better make things right when they fix it.
---
Yeah I remember when the game first came out it triggered when you walked up I can't seem to get it to work anymore.
---
Minigun accuracy not great?
---
I can shoot with "real life laser" accuracy at opposite side of the Temple pond while staying on temple gates, whole Mediation event with that is a breeze with Minigun and sitting in one place
---
I‚Äôd prioritize damage and extra stats/cards way more than this, plus I like food/drink buffs way too much to burn one of only six slots on convenience.  Enemies are going to get a lot tougher next week.  
---
I feel bad for those players that are struggling against Gutsies now, but I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôre the same folks that will opt for this card.
---
Scrap and store
---
We should be allowed to play as a super mutant behemoth to come give everyone a dirt nap too
---
Found?
---
Just like the real world, or even worse. We just have to accept the fact, sadly
---
I think the red only shows up if you get into combat / hostile. I can never vats anyone and shooting my gun, though they say they take minimal damage, always ends up showing zero damage until they shoot back.... But by that time you're at a disadvantage, which sucks.
---
I think a call out in the corner of the screen notes if they're on pacifist..... Or is that only when you're on pacifist? They changed so much in the PVP since launch I honestly have no idea anymore.
---
If you‚Äôre on ps4 I‚Äôve been looking to purchase/trade for one for quite some time
---
Yeah. I have all sets of PA and was waiting to display them though that‚Äôs like 60lbs in my stash
---
I had no idea it was a big deal! I just ate the first two straightaway lol
---
Geez, got enough quests active?
---
The level of the weapon.
---
Yeah don't worry you'll have all the freedom you need to play a lil more with your build. Eventualy you will even found the time to purchase perks to make your character more versatile, multipurpose. I mean some Sniper builds can quickly switch to an Autorifle build if they want to...just need the perks.
---
Wear it?
---
Wear it.
---
Are you running the Grounded Mutation?
---
Fair enough.  The top is pretty flat, but also wide
---
Those are fucking impossible to get, man! I've spent hours trying! You're lucky.
---
There really isn‚Äôt much diff between a 50 and a 100. Same with a 150 and 250.  
---
I like low levels in my group.  Fun to see what they use.
---
It's worth a lot - probably trade only.
---
I found this plan last week. 1500 hours in. Thought these were like enclave plasma rifles.
---
Would be great but a horde mode would probably break the engine, heh.
---
sell it to other players. cuz capitalism why not üòä
---
I always see minigun bullets wildly flying off target at events, but I shouldn‚Äôt assume everyone is using good mods to improve accuracy and solid legendary effects.
---
Double bed like the addams family one.
---
I kinda hope they do a special variant to the mr Fuzzy costume and maybe a grahm costume or a werewolf costume that I can put on my camp ally.
---
Who needs the right side of the screen anyway?
---
So in previous fallouts there was occasionally a machine available that looks like those diagnostic tube thing you enter in the Ounce of prevention quest or at nuclear silos when making your key card. This machine would fix broken limbs, cure rads, cure addictions, and remove diseases. Basically fix you up 100%. I am not sure what features we are getting with this version since i haven't learned data miner wizardry yet.
---
Need something?
---
Unless we're running around with a wanted level generally we don't care. There's no good endgame and squishing low levels is way less fun than helping them out. (I don't need your junk loot)
---
The only thing I would NOT suggest is joining Colossal Problem. Any other event we may even try not to kill everything off so you can get exp. I know I'll let mobs wack at me for a few seconds to let the newer guys tag it.
---
That being said feel free to send me your tag if you're on pc and we can go run events!
---
Really? I don't think I've tried this more than 15 times!
---
Yes, yes and yes!! I can't wait for more social features in the game. If Bethesda implement that correctly that would be LEGENDARY!!
---
This. Tired of getting one-shotted by some stealth jerk. Forcing pvp at workshops is worst part of the game for me. (And one-shot kills aren't pvp, they're just grief.)
---
Yes!!!
---
I only have Stabilized to improve accuracy, for mods, I recently switched from 3 barrel to 6 barrel as a test and accuracy haven't really changed much
---
Scrap it for 1 point towards the scrap 76 hats challenge.
---
Yes please üôèüèªüòç
---
Because Bethsoft probably can't make the price change to account for it without breaking literally everything and Godd Howard needs your money so he can port Skyrim to the microwave.
---
That might have been what was causing the one quest to be broken I couldn't see why would be removed otherwise
---
3x3 = 9 not 15
---
Forgot to mention their level was 50 as was mine.
---
Hey, I need you to help me with Project Paradise. (lol)
---
mine do this but im a junkies build with a junkies gauss mini and use all 3 of the minigun perks and have them all 3* and equipped and I usually hit numbers around there plus other drugs that are not part of my addictions and other various factors
---
No, I don't have any mutations. I am going through perks right now so I can keep mutations because that was suggested to me.
---
If I see low levels come into my server I pretty much drop what I'm doing, make an appropriate lvl fixer and try to give it to them, along with some stimpacks and fadeaway. I can't tell you how many lower level people run away from me. You're not alone OP.
---
Like how do you have a mic but no headphones?
---
I do this as well, the only things I sell for more than 1 cap is 2mm and 50cal and that at a whopping 2 caps. I constantly sell my ammo and I leave all the .38 in the overseers cache near Vault 76 for new players. Learned that from here.
---
Yeah I'm hoping for a road but thx a lot tho
---
I get tons of 5.56 from just not using it much. Mostly use .45 which I gather more of than I use too, but I have my ammo machine set to 5.56 because it's the highest yield so I can sell it.
---
Never seen that one if it exists.
---
Yeah I know thatüòÇI thought that I had to leave space for this legendary perk thing coming out
---
Maybe Bethesds should rework some wasteland story mission areas like underground parking in watoga from Beckett or underground arena from raiders and use them for the upcoming daily ops missions.
---
A friend runs a fixer commando build. You know what he says alot about it? "Damnit, out of ammo again"
---
It could pick up clueless people wandering through flatwoods.
---
When I used a minigun I had the tri-barrel.  It was ok, but the gun always felt kinda spazzy to me.  It might have been the FFR effect.
---
Currently I have a recon hunting rifle at level 40 as well as a fixer at level 40
---
Take over the Kill Box? :)
---
There's a two lane forest road on either side of Bleeding Kate's that may work.
---
I was told that Gauss weapons are counted as Explosive, is that not the case?
---
I literally do this but I sell mine in my vendors for 100 or less caps since all the ones i make are low leveled on purpose for them and im camped rite by wayward so any low levels can get there hands on a gun that will be beneficial to them up to a certain point üòä its a win-win for everyone lol
---
I scrap all mine
---
I try to keep [mine](https://imgur.com/a/gSnNKSp) fairly organized, but it always starts basic, but then I need this and that, and a bit more of those... and I end up with something that's part planned out and part clustered mess because I had no where else to put it.
---
I've been in Helvetia since just before fasnacht and have no intention to move since I've gotten pretty used to it and like what it's turned into.
---
I also love camp locations where I have vehicles and mobs to snipe at when the mood strikes.
---
It‚Äôs so pointless, I use apt of food buffs to get extra XP anyway so I always carry them plus in patch 23 they are removing the negatives from dehydration and starvation so it‚Äôll just be a waste in perk points
---
In one more week, the One Wasteland update will scale to your level, so all events will be on the table for you. üëç
---
Minigun, LMG and Gatling Laser are probably the only weapons where FFR feels like a waste of legendary slot, I suspect it causes major accuracy degradation since Final Word have bad accuracy and it's the only weapon I have with FFR
---
Legendary perks are completely seperate and only really obtainable for high level players (like 500+ to use them fully)
---
Ehh at least the community managers see it. Pretty sure the actual support tickets all go to a printer that feeds directly into a shredder.
---
This is a Reddit gaming sub.  If you can count on anything, it‚Äôs an endless river of complaints.
---
no, there considered non explosive guns and don't count toward the explosive perk cards, only the miniguns ones
---
They really should have made the raider one collect those. lol
---
Jesus, you already have a fixer, don't tell me you have the plan...
---
You'd be most lucky new player ever lol
---
Thx I'll take a look
---
Erm I have 18 plans of the fixer
---
U can server hop at Deathclaw island, one will spawn nearly everytime
---
a good way to help you and ease you into all of it is just simply the wayward quest and then explore and do the main quest and gradually make your way into exploring the whole map. However, if your looking for level grinding then start with the ghouls in Morgantown and server hop killing the hordes of them.
---
Or how about something completely new?
---
Yeah I‚Äôll probably never get that then, I‚Äôm level 49
---
Ahhh, ok. Well I happened to have enough levels to pump into those cards (I've been getting tons of XP lately) I was able to see that It gets my damage up to at least 90. I'll have to see if I can get ahold of the guy once I find the video again and ask him how he got his damage so high. It's on like every gun so I don't think it's because of a specific Junkie, Furious, Bloodied.
---
You think thr CM's care at this point?
---
So you‚Äôre not newish then?
---
Weapons have their own level. Your character could be 50 but your weapon can be 30. Check the weapon level. Mods as well will effect the damage. Most if not all heavy weapon perks are under strength.
---
Yes and no, before the upcoming sun setting any weapon can be used anywhere in the game. Sure you have to grind for higher power weapons/armor and infusion, but my austringer from last year I‚Äôve used every season since it came out without feeling the requirement to grind something else due to ‚Äúpower creep‚Äù
---
Man I hate this canned response every time someone asks why people lock their doors. Justification isn't even the topic, they're asking *why* they do it.
---
And so I can actually contribute to the thread, my one and only locked door is because my ally kept opening the false fireplace and it looked dumb being open all the time.
---
Though you're better off not givings 1's or even 5's really. 
---
I've only ever given out 10's to people from like level 7+. They're not waiting too long and they get to use it to its full potential for at least 10 levels, though more isn't unreasonable.
---
I asked if anyone knew how to get plans for it and someone gave me 20 plans for the fixer as well as 20 for the bear arm thing as well
---
I've thrown together a small tool to estimate how much days it will take under specific gameplay styles where you might skip certain amount of NW challenges, participate only some double score and get exp at certain pace for repeatable challenge: https://js.do/code/fo76_scorerun_2
---
Also if you already entered a code for that silo this week you don‚Äôt have to re enter to cod so even if you want to do it old school you could repeat it
---
Oh dear, I did make an appearance at a camp the 2 of you were also at just before I signed off, to show off the Wendigo teeth I FINALLY got üòÇ , the girl thought I needed some more so she went off to look for some in her stash bless her.. I'm quite new to the game and expected to get killed every 5 minutes or so but you 2 were so helpful .
---
I've gotten quite a few from campfire tales. I'm not exactly sure on the drop rate but based on my personal experience I'd wager it being around 10-15%. If I'm just exceptionally unlucky it might be higher.
---
Fuck that. Bring in something new, or at least flesh out what's already here. We already got the brotherhood vs. Enclave game.
---
Yeah I guess I kinda meant new as in I've been playing for maybe like 2 months? I have a friend who has helped me by getting me tons of XP stuff so it's helped me get to a higher level pretty fast. I'll look into the mods, I know I don't have everything unlocked for certain weapons
---
I don't care if people like it or not, I play the game for me and not for the satisfaction of others.
---
Deffo not me, no mic. You should have wasted him
---
Word
---
So a lvl 5 killing lvl 100s is wrong? The funny part is that they would never fight a lvl 60+, you know why? Because they fear someone who can fight back, so they complain when someone their lvl fights them at a workshop but are 100% okay with offing a lvl 5, it's pathetic really. And I deleted the post bc of the notification, I got like 35 in 10 minutes. the reality is the pve community is, for the most part, very soft and toxic. I lose plenty and get tbagged, idc bc I know it's simply part of the game. A pve player dies and plugs in his mic to drop 23 hard Rs and rage quits. They take things too seriously, pvp is literally 100% avoidable, it gives u a message telling u about passivist mode when u turn lvl 5 and workshops do the same. The shit talk isn't real, it's just gloating which is something these fortnite kids seem to forget. Idk how old u r or if u were around when mw2-bo2 was mainstream but that taught me that shit talk and being toxic isn't actually being mean, it's simply playing. I was like six hearing all kinds of slurs and I soon realized that it's fake, literally just a game. We aren't playing ark or rust, there is no punishment for death. Unless u dont stash ur junk, that's 100% on the victim tho. The point is being toxic hardly matters, if u can't handle someone saying "u suck noob" then u shouldn't be playing an online game, none the less an game rated mature.
---
I would be more accepting of the bundle not allowing you to deduct what you‚Äôve already paid for if they would let you buy everything from the bundle separately.  Like I have the contemporary floors so I don‚Äôt want the bundle but I‚Äôd like to have the flagstone.  I think the way micro-transactions are handled in general is just trash.  I personally would give subscribers access to 100% of it while they were subscribed but if the sub lapsed then it all goes away unless the individual pieces were purchased with digital currency.  That‚Äôs just me personally.
---
That's great and all, but I think you missed the point of my response
---
Oh shit. Fuckin grinder. Hell yeah! Mods are the hardest. What are you playing on? I can see if I have mods for that weapon.
---
It is quite active but the main tab is global, meaning you're not just talking to the people on your server, you're talking to everyone who has the mod installed. There is an option to speak to others in your area but its not very likely you find someone with the mod there in my experience. I still recommend it anyway, there is trading and a lot of information to be learned.
---
Super Duper procs separately.
---
You need to know the plans too.
---
That would be sweet! Insider info?!? Lol
---
What plan is it?
---
My ultracite gatling laser just doesn't reload it's stops firing then there is more ammo
---
Do you have the plan to craft the regular jetpack for the armor you're trying to put it on?
---
The jetpack plan for whichever armor it is?

You can get up to 20k caps for them in your store, you likely got them from a duper (from what I see they like to spread out their dupes, came back to my camp as a low level once to a bag of 20 of each kind of plan for various things, didn‚Äôt realize duping was a thing yet)
---
Yeah its xo1 armor but I can't apply it
---
Bibeo bame
---
I don't play nw.  It makes me nervous.  I was in Helvetia when the day changed.  It's the first time I can remember being in world when it changed as I usually do other things while waiting and then play after it turns.  lesson learned
---
I really like the raider camp where you hand in mirelurks, so many containers and life preservers
---
You sure you got the xo1 jetpack unlocked?
---
I'm a dummy :(
---
Didn‚Äôt know it would be possible on Xbox, how would I go about selling them for caps?
---
I was the one of the two guys who figured out the broken formula.
---
Why not check to see if the there is a book first? You can't input a code if there's no nook.
---
Haha the gatling plasma is what got me into ultracite too need all dat damage.
---
When you say log out and back in do you mean just going back to the main menu or exiting all the way to desktop?
---
Put them in your store, you can‚Äôt go over 30k caps keep in mind. I bought mine for 10k but they move for more than that. I didn‚Äôt find one till I was like level 120 (I did mercifully find decent actual fixers in vendors before that)
---
I liked the G Shotgun but its 100% first shot miss chance in vats bugged me too no end. Its all Guass Weapons but still...
---
Nah, the descriptions aren't well done. Just like how the camo skin for the t65 says it comes with the jetpack mod but you still need the 2000 bullion plan to put the mod.
---
So how much would you sell one plan for?
---
I didn‚Äôt know this happened to others I thought I was doing something wrong lol
---
"English isn't my native language"
---
 And you still type better than 90% of the people on here who's it is.üòÇ
---
I'm on xbox 1
---
Yeah thanks for the info I forgot I bought this pa along time ago
---
BE gat plasma for life
---
I‚Äôm an endgame player and I have started building up a collection of legacy weapons, I‚Äôm not even an OG I got the game in April and just been grinding all day everyday since then. You can get all that endgame gear but tbh it doesn‚Äôt even make the game fun anymore, when you can one shot everything there‚Äôs no point in playing lol
---
Ditto. Have a Junkies Explosive Mini gun in been going easy on by using a JunkiesFFR GPlasma. Cant wait too just hold R2 with my Minigun
---
On PC there's a very healthy amount of player interaction going on via Text Chat Mod.
---
Actually, that's the only way anyone in the game ever gets me to trade outside of player vending. I won't take trade invites unless it's someone I was talking to in trade chat.
---
Eh, they are actually not that bad.
---
The harpoon gun is magic, so if you put flechette on it it does insane damage per shot, for now, after it's fixed it will be mediocre again.
---
The pickaxe is almost as good as the best possible 2 hand melee weapon, being about on par with the super sledge and having good effects.
---
The shovel is weightless which is alright if you carry it around for the daily, and is super light scrip fodder otherwise.
---
JunkiesFFR+1Agil. Would give my left one for a Junkies Explosive.
---
Corpse flower stamen and strangler pods please?
---
I have a feeling that the CMs are going to steer clear of the forums for at least a week after p22.  People are going to flip their wigs.
---
Steam. 
---
I actually googled that question before buying the game and what I came up with was DL speeds using Bethsoft's launcher during install isn't as fast as you may get from Steam. Other than that, not much I'm sure.
---
Yeah. I know. You get a lot more 5mm rounds from ammo factory and ammo smith then just doubling the base amount which is why I said it would be better to not use super duper as there becomes a 30% chance you will get less.
---
With super duper: 200
---
With nothing: 100
---
With ammosmith + ammo factory: 450
---
They don't have enough content to cut content in my opinion. They have enough bugs that need to be cut, lol.
---
Why? So you can dupe and do some RMT?
---
There's generally somewhere around 100-300 players on it at any given time, with a handful active in the chat at once. You won't organically come across people using it much (it colors users names blue who are using it so you can tell at a glance though), but people using it tend to congregate and play together (not that you have to, I chat a lot but rarely join people's servers).
---
They‚Äôre probably not tradable because it‚Äôs a pts? Or is it like Bullion items that you can‚Äôt trade?
---
I've been playing on my low level he's like level 15. My other 2 are 210 and 300. I constantly have to tell high level players that I don't need any gifts because he's an alt and I'm set up really good. I actually gave a level 50 a vampires explosive combat rifle because he tried dropping me a ton of stuff 2 nights ago.
---
It causes you to lose a little accuracy and have heavier recoil on certain guns, but nothing severe like two shot.
---
But they do explode my gauss shotgun explodes and I use demolition perk grenade perk the mini gun explodes too I don‚Äôt have one but I‚Äôve seen pleanty in action
---
That‚Äôs really good damage against SBQ and high DPS because of the large magazine. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend going solo with this though but you‚Äôll definitely carry your weight in a team fight.
---
Mine is complete, but they may have bugged something out in the past year or so.  I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised.
---
Isnt the base damage (what's shown in the weapon description with fr and weight) changed by adrenal reaction and bloodied aswell?
---
Entirely agree. The new smaller, regional factions have awesome potential for interesting story telling. 
---
Why turn Appalachia, an interesting setting, and 76 a different type of Fallout game into nothing more than another story about the BoS and Enclave. I'm so over those 2, boring af, factions.
---
That's a odd thing. Maybe try reinstalling the game
---
Stay to the left side of the map. Green is good. Stay in the green till your not a green horn.
---
I will accept that. I don't play nw and didn't consider this bug would impact me.  A strategy dependent on everything working as it should is idiotic.  I will now pay for my poor judgement by buying atoms.
---
Would have been nice to use it for an Enclave mission to be president since your already a general. They are also missing the mark on a presidential legendary scoreboard they could have done since its election year.
---
Give it to me, I horde them.
---
It‚Äôs worth a lot I would trade my tenderizer plans for it
---
Hackers, dupers, rmters already have a way to trade them with a tool they have if you kept up to date on whats being sold you would know that wastelanders weapons are being sold aswell as strangler armor sets and t-65. im asking that they make it so i can give my friends a item like the old man winter pa head that i have 3 of and cant get more of if i destroy them.
---
The chest doesn‚Äôt have anything worthwhile.  Just some caps and a handful of stims and unrefined ore.  When the chest had cursed weapons in the PTS I went for it.  Now, I stick around for the ammo.
---
Nope its like that on the full release and its from a quest
---
Me personally? I have trouble spending my caps, so I‚Äôd probably trade it for an outfit, not even a super rare one just one I don‚Äôt have
---
Edit: but it will sell for up to 20k, if I see one for under 10 I‚Äôd buy it as a low weight item with a ton of value.
---
Sounds like you aren‚Äôt 50, hold them till you are lvl 70 at least by then you will have a pretty good understanding of the end game market and managing when you need resources. You are gonna want 6k a week just to buy gold
---
100+ caps, a couple stims and unrefined ore.  Nothing worthwhile.
---
Who cares if they're never mentioned? 
---
That's the best part of smaller regional factions? You can tell big stories with them, without them having to have a huge impact on the overall lore. 
---
Including the BoS is already iffy, and could cause more issues. Bringing the enclave into the mix just makes that worse. You'd now have to fold in these regional factions into the BoS/Enclave bigger story. 
---
Where without them? They'd have so much freedom. Rise and fall of smaller regional factions, history, events unfolding however they want with little concern of impacting the bigger lore of 76.
---
Same with munitions factory
---
Doesn‚Äôt the atom shop description say ‚Äúapplies on every power armor‚Äù or something like that
---
My commandos should be fine but I‚Äôm worried about my pistol build and berserker. But we‚Äôll see
---
None of them are true Fallout Fans. If they were they would have played from the get-go. Not wait till Bethesda makes it a free for all to get more people to boost in-game revenue. Blame it on Corporate Greed!
---
I also think a lot of them are people that got banned and got new accounts and are just pissed at the world because they got caught cheating and have to start over.
---
Need a bit of help with the horde events in the forest. IGN: xXx_N008_5L4Y3R_69_xXx
---
Yeah. I‚Äôd trade for that silly mask. Must have done a thousand Parades and got a single rare mask.
---
Works like a charm! Found this last week and finally completed the challenge :)
---
*PEELS!*
---
Thank you 
---
Long live the enclave
---
Yah but apparently its it wrong far too often
---
It doesn't matter why because the reasons are numerous and we've seen them all before. 
---
Rational, irrational it all doesn't matter because the end result is the same. Our thoughts or opinions of the matter are utterly meaningless and a waste of time.
---
Their camp, their rules is just more efficient than what I just wrote.
---
BoS and Enclave are the worst things BGS could do, and they are/will because boring people keep asking to rehash or flesh out stories and more about these boring factions. 
---
Small, local and regional factions can be fully explored, stories told, histories made with little concern of impacting the greater Fallout lore. 
---
You can literally do just about anything with these groups.... Mix in the BoS and enclave and you find yourself tip toeing around lore
---
&gt;just like in real life, I can only run for like 0.7 seconds before running out of energy
---
Amen.
---
To expand on this there is also a trash can at the back of the golf club which is full of plastic knives and forks.
---
I finally saw what people thought and I know see yes we should flesh out some of the new factions that were brought in
---
Something similar has been happening to me with what ever gun I have equipped when I log in. I'll have 250 rounds in my magazine. Kind of a good thing in my opinion lol. But yeah, it wont let me fire it at first, and I cant reload it manually.
---
Next update will rebalance damage, but it sounds like in the video you saw, they were likely using a bloodied build, which will give a 80% + 20% +50% to damage once mutations and perks stack, not to mention the +60% from heavy gun perks.
---
Then you can also stack a psychobuff and a ballistic bock for another 25% + 15%
---
How the fuck have you played that much in 2 months? Jesus, go outside.
---
If it‚Äôs wrong send a ticket to BGS and get a refund
---
I mean, they can‚Äôt fix the fast travel bug, or all the other bugs, but sure let‚Äôs see if they can add an entirely different game mode.
---
I thought most players would be annoyed that bathesda keep doing this but no i get a guy accuses me of duping and being rmt as the first comment when i just ask for a game that isent about squeezing the life out of me with its events
---
My B2525 fixer was hard enough. Am I gonna have to get a PCB2525 fixer?
---
That used to be true but not since it joined gamepass (on xbox)
---
Holy shit really? That is seriously stupid wow
---
is there an error code? ususally something is corrupted.  You have to uninstall, delete saved files and clear cache.  Dont worry the server saves you charactera progress.  Just create a Bethesda login just in case.
---
at least 5
---
I think they were the ones before the bog one so you missed it
---
Since XP is now important, I‚Äôve been adding in the Scoutmaster dailies for variety when I‚Äôm in the area.  I started season 1 with 1 Possum badge and now I have 11.  I did a handful of Campfire Tales as well, but only noticed the on-screen badge awards for the dailies.
---
If I had to guess, I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs a 10% chance to get a badge from the dailies.  I have no idea about Campfire Tales.
---
Pffft. Ace &gt; Modus.
---
Appalachia needs less enclave not more. 
---
Who wants to make the place more boring?
---
I sent you a message but was curious. What system are you on. I got a 3 not doing anything
---
And you get to build up the workshop together would be cool!
---
Thanks didnt know i could do that
---
Don‚Äôt worry about him. He‚Äôs getting dealt with.
---
The only mods that are worth holding on to are power armour mods, calibrated shocks, reactive plates, emergency  protocols and targeting HUD. Anything else you might as well scrap or sell to vendors.
---
Turn pacifist on, take any items people give you (they‚Äôre level 100 they have everything) give back where you can (fusion cores if you don‚Äôt need them etc.). 
---
No one will report you, no one can kill you. Fo76 has the best online community, everyone playing loves the franchise and loves new players, be kind and respectful and you will have no reason to fear them.
---
I really want to plant firecaps as carrot flower and brain fungus are easy to get compared to friecap. My ultimate plan is to make loadsa drugs.
---
I'll have to read up on that update it sounds like. I don't think it was bloodied though just because he was trying to get a bloodied one and all of them he hovered over was damage of 150+ Weather it was Furious, Hunters or otherwise it stayed at 166. I still don't get how people do bloodied builds! I get close to dying as is, let alone having basically no health to begin with.
---
Yep. 
---
Because games always allow the same meta to exist for ever, and nothing ever needs balancing. 
---
How annoying.
---
500 hours in 8/9 weeks is... a lot.
---
oh okay thanks
---
This game has one of the most friendly online communities ever! Let people love you! 
---
High level players will give you free plans/waters/stimpaks usually. 
---
Most high level players just love the game and are happy to have new ppl to play with. Also, my perspective is it‚Äôs fun seeing newbs try to figure stuff out. 
---
Dying doesn‚Äôt matter, as long as you‚Äôre not carrying valuable junk. Just put on pacifist and have fun
---
I agree.  Two shot is just about the worst effect for a sniper rifle.  The accuracy penalty alone sucks, without the hit to armor penetration, durability and chance of only one projectile hitting for 60% of base damage.
---
I'm on ps4
---
Looks like I'm respeccing back into Heavy then. Fortunately just rolled a 3* Bloodied Gauss Mini so I should be set.
---
Ah damn, thanks. Guess I‚Äôll just have to wait for some more Scout Armor cosmetics to show up in the shop then. Scout gets no love :/
---
I have gone solo with her but, not in Scorched Earth.  She appeared in a stale Blast Zone as I entered the Grove near the Prime Fissure.  No ads just her and me toe to toe. Had her down to about 5% of her second health bar.  Stepped out of the Blast Zone for a second and she vanished in front of my eyes. Glitch I guess.
---
is there also a power armor glitch? I run with a 190 pounds on me pretty much all the time but when I get into my power ar.or it shoots up to over 800 pounds and wayyyyyyy overweight!!!! HELP!!!
---
I stay &amp; loot the Wendigo Teeth for the Acid+, Ammo &amp; screws. You also get purifier water, super stimpaks, Radaway.
---
I don‚Äôt turn on usually til my kids are in bed at 10pm and I‚Äôm usually in bed by 2 so about 4 hours a night...just consistent
---
I'd love to see it!
---
Xb1?
---
The problem with instigating/explosive is that if your AoE skims a nearby enemy, blows up a car or sets an oil slick on fire, you‚Äôve now lost double damage on every enemy in the oopsie zone.
---
I/+10 is much, much better, because the 10% is multiplied by the instigating effect.  At least, until p22 goes live....
---
It crashed when it usually finishes signing in. I was playing it just this morning, now I can‚Äôt play at all :( I might just wait for the data update tomorrow
---
Follow some of the main quest and do the side missions that pop up. 
---
I found that doing only the main quest at the start meant that I was pretty under-levelled, so it's good to get some of those side quests in.
---
If you go to the "Data" section on your pip boy, it will split quests into Main, Side, Daily, and Events. That's a good place to keep track of them. Also, if you find the right side of your screen is filling up with quest text, you can turn that off here. The quests you turn off will still be there for you to come back to - apart from the Events quests, which will appear when they're live, and disappear when they're not, but they come back on a cycle, so unless I'm wrong, you won't miss out on them.
---
Edit: Also...
---
Do some exploring if you want, you find out pretty quickly if you've gone to a part of the map you're not ready for yet, but it's a good way to get started.
---
Some of the more experienced players set up camps near vault 76, the Wayward and Flatwoods specifically to help newer players - you might find reasonably priced plans, recipes and lower level weapons in their vendors.
---
I had missed em as well,I somehow have em for leather &amp; metal,but apparently missed the scout ones,which sucks,cause I finally JUST got the mask...now I got a full suit wit mask,&amp; the only thing I can put on it other then forest color is the stoopit AF ghillie ish.
---
It's because when you get into armor it unequips all your gear. If your armor has % weight reductions then you lose all those bonuses when you get into power armor
---
Damn, sorry dude, on xbox
---
Small chance of being murdered while you're afk.
---
While a few said they had such issues I can't say I've really noticed much of a problem with either my .50 or .5mm Gatling guns, but I tend to reload regularly whenever there's a break in the action.
---
Perhaps if you run the magazine to empty all of the time it's more noticeable?
---
Feels like he's describing two separate bugs. It's been awhile since I've used Gats but I know what you're refering to. I believe there is a current bug with all guns that causes the reloading to be all over the place. With or without the Firework reload bug, it still happens. Almost curious if Beth put in the Fireworks as a "fix" to the bug until it was fixed and really noticed. I guess we shall see upon this next update. 50/50 both that bug, and Fireworks will be patched.üôäüôàüôâ
---
No probüëç
---
9 weeks is 63 days. 63 days @8 hours a day is 504 hours.   4 hours a day would be a little over 250.
---
I dare say duping would have brought this about.
---
Non tradeable/sellable is what killed Madden Ultimate Team for me- I made a livelihood trading players and items to build my teams rather than using money.
---
I don‚Äôt suggest scrapping it,I dunno if it‚Äôs as rare as the urban...but last I knew they where worth a decent amount of caps to most.
---
I‚Äôd either rock it out,or sell it.
---
My 2 cents,chuck em in a well should jah feel so inclined
---
Oh there are days that I definitely play more like weekends
---
If for some reason you have mods for scout armor those are valuable too
---
almost 8 hours a day. everyday.
---
In laggy places like ACP, weapon switching also bogs down for me.
---
I wish the splash screen would say "the season ends Tuesday morning. Grab your shit now"
---
Bethesda dont understand that if dupers want to transfer stuff that already can theres already 5 tools for doing it plus custom coded ones that Rmters pay people to make for them
---
Dude I love doing that I lure them into a parking lot and blow up the cars it's beautiful.
---
Bulk what you don‚Äôt use and sell the excess. Farm the high school for the plastic needed to bulk. Also make sure all the junk is scrapped. Check for heavy stuff in misc. drop ammo you don‚Äôt use or turn em into ammo points.
---
Fuck no, bring back the Responders or the Free states. Something original.   
---
The BoS make barely any sense returning as it is. As I imagine the West Coast is currently still trying to secure it's own base. The Brotherhood I ultimately think should of remained dead but of course we needed the fan service.  
---
Honestly if they wanted all these old factions, they could of just based it on the West Coast. What we need in Appalachia is more new ideas and factions. The BoS of here to stay now so we have no control over that but we can at least in the future do the right thing and stop dragging the game down in shallow fan service.
---
Yeah those that traded untradeble items got banned if you kept date. You are just making things easier for RMTers
---
Probably lag on the Public server doing funny things with damage. Usually little to no lag on the Private servers.
---
Yeah average...good math though!
---
Agreed. Or at least the camp and account wide stuff should unlock automatically if you haven‚Äôt. Maybe it will
---
Thank you for this post. I have been to Fort Defiance hundreds of times and never checked that terminal. Now I know a new plan, so thank you.
---
There‚Äôs that road that run through the mire....
---
I had a camp built under a section of bridge that had a Hermit crab spawn right by it...it was pretty dope.
---
Had a nice Lol shack underneath,&amp; the some turrets &amp; barricaded on the road,plus the road had a little hole in it,that dropped ya right on the roof of the shack I mentioned.
---
Thinkin back,I really dig that joint,but had too move,at the time it got stale.
---
There are days I play for 16 hours! Weird how that‚Äôs the focus here but oh well
---
Happens every month for me. When it does I usually cant log in for a day maybe two. Never bothered reinstallation because I don't have the download speed for that. Rebuilding data bases and cache clearing never helped either. Just played a different game those days.
---
If you look at his hp in the video, you should be able to tell. You don't need a bloodied weapon to take advantage of 2/3 components of a bloodied build, which is adrenal reaction (+50%) and nerd rage (+20%). 
---
I also didn't mention the 60% you can get from adrenaline perk, on any build, or the 15% from bloody mess perk.
---
Hunters in that case would add another 30% if you hit the right type of enemy, or furious for 45%.
---
Please consider fixing what Doom64 broke in Fallout76 friends lists
---
You really think so becouse i know for a fact that people havent gotten ban for the current method just yesterday i saw someone trade strangler armor to someone else its not done how you think bethesda only ban people who force the item into peoples inventory not everyone gets ban but anyways im not leaking methods just to prove a point also bethesda made it impossible to track cretin things due to there engine limitations
---
Give people the Responders, make them the dominate faction in the region. A faction of people who've trained themselves in different emergency services would be great. Make them come back with the bang by kicking the Raiders out of Crater and taking back Morgantown or just Flatwoods.  
---
Make the raiders a more spread out and decentralised group which gives missions related to raiding and attacking settlements and players  but seriously we need to stop rehashing these old ideas. Bethesda is anchoring the potential of the franchise by constantly rehashing the same tropes again aned again. Never introducing anything new.
---
I know what you mean, I‚Äôm very much the same way even now at lvl400 lmfao. Anxiety is just super fun all the time (/s)! You‚Äôll get up there though but dont exclude yourself even as a low level! There are ways you can still help and be involved in things like events! Like doing revives, mob control...
---
Just scrap or sell them.  Mods are heavy and learnable plans can be found or bought for everything besides scout armor.  Even then, you can just go to the bunker and buy whatever scout mod you want at any time.  There‚Äôs no sense in hoarding them.
---
As far as I can remember, there aren‚Äôt any extraordinary or highly desirable single use mods.  You can either buy the plan or just buy the single use mod from a robot vendor if you want to put an extra claw on your deathclaw gauntlet.  It may require a server hop to get it in the vendor list.  I guess you can save some flux with a calibrated shock kit, but good luck figuring out what type of suit it works with.
---
Tent is life.
---
Ehrm, no. SD procs separately in addition, not as a replacement for the other factors.
---
With nothing 100
---
With AS 180 (if SD procs +100 = 280)
---
Wit AS and AF 450 (if SD procs +100 = 550)
---
Thanks for the reply. That sucks!
---
Fking paywall. Don‚Äôt see how people play without it.  Not saying I don‚Äôt have space issues now but before?  Just do it if you can afford it and like the game.
---
Forgive me, but isn't Raven Rock in this period just an empty bunker with a AI in control of it? What exactly would be there to connect too?
---
Yes def something happened idk I will try again on private server see if it‚Äôs same way or not. Sucks being that I thought I was able to solo earl and the queen
---
Actually, they have tried to fix it.  But they've mostly been Band-Aids against a greater problem with inconsistency.  You are getting hung up on enemies that are unseen or potentially inactive, but still contribute to the "There's an enemy nearby" check.  The question is solving why are they there in the first place, and there doesn't seem to be any one reason behind it.
---
Yeah I am slightly concerned about the PTS changes but I'm waiting to see if it's as bad as people say it is.
---
Maybe the model could be some kind of fusion of those Nuka World bots with screen and a Protectron. That could be good.
---
I wish it was like Meat Week. As in where between main events we had to go Trick or Treating in different towns for candy to use in the main event like Prime Cuts.
---
Tent is your friend. Scrapbox is nice but tent is luxurious.
---
What Bethesda should do is stop those tools that allow for transfer and ban those that use said tools, not give RMTers another opportunity.
---
This is a fair point, if you couldn't even pay attention to the original storyline (which fair enough, it kinda sucks) why are you demanding more content?  
---
I barely remember the storyline because like a lot of end-game contact for 76 it's just setting up an excuse for a particular mechanic.
---
Dude... that's literally the entire Enclave story...
---
They could solve that by making reloads manual
---
They told us it was only available for 4 days
---
Addibg to what others say, you will still run out of space, but your junk wont be an issue. The tent anywhere means less stumbling walks to the nearest train station. The free stuff now happening monthly is nice for the camp building. The atoms given every month is also awesome.
---
Stay and loot for the screws and acid
---
On my first character, I went all out building sprawling and lavish camps.
---
On my second though, I went with the maximum minimum - just a seedy shack with benches and a bed. For quite a while too... but my urge to customize and decorate has creeped up on me lol.
---
Then solution is simple. Ban these people using new methods.
---
Yeah, had a few people that just sit on top of the hut. Yeah, good use of marsupial. Thanks for the teamwork pal!
---
I figured it out! I had the chemist backpack mod on a deselect my traveling pharmacy perk card lol I added the card back and weight went down to normal!
---
Ahh yea I only want the models - not the chess pieces
---
It‚Äôs not necessary to play at all. I did buy it for one month. I got but for 800 hours without it, plan to do another 800 without it again.
---
Bro good call. How did you know it would be there today?
---
Yessir
---
When the game released they gave the hackers the tools to do so be removing the ability to use them they would need to create new tools for them self and all i was trying to point out is not trade blocking every item in the game might be good if they knew how a game economy works
---
Oh man like 1/5 of them challenges are bugged. Doubt Bethesda has them as a priority.
---
Honestly, without the season pass going I have nothing to do. They need to up the frequency of public events plus add new ones.
---
Maybe even rework the whole event system to be like meat week where you do a bunch of smaller events and on the hour there is a big event where the whole server shows up to attend and can turn in the currency from the smaller events.
---
It was just so cool to see most of the server show up to an event.
---
Honestly it been a flash to me the only story‚Äôs I truly kinda know are the NCR and ceaser legion also a couple from old world blues mod for hoi4
---
I definitely think it is. You get the value in atoms and other random free stuff. That‚Äôs almost enough for me. The stash box is incredible
---
I'm wondering this too. Is it anything like the lunchbox confetti explosion?
---
Sell it. Are you carrying a bunch of ammo you don‚Äôt need/use?

Go through your stash and look at your scrap. You probably only need 50-100 of most things

Then keep banning em. That's what other game companies do lol

I can say this for sure, an automatic TS2525 plasma rifle works really well. It works pretty well in the live version right now though too, but it feels less effected than my ballistic rifles do in the PTS.

They cant ban without them being reported as the method they use does not get tracked in server logs and would take days to find in a public server looking through actions that each player does even if they had those logs

I‚Äôm around that level and I‚Äôm still shitty at playing. I love it though.

I have an arena at my camp.
