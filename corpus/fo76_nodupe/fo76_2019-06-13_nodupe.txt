Yeah, you can't go over base 15 in anything.  You can go higher with equipment and chems and stuff, but in terms of allocating points 15 is the max.
---
---
---
Maybe to get people to do that event.
---
I saved this as a screenshot so I could send it to buddies at work!
---
Have you joined the Army at Camp McClintock? You need to do that before the DMV part. Possibly also need to revisit the asylum and read the terminal on the 3rd floor near the lazer-gated elevator?
---
Yes , it cap at 15.
---
Yeah max for any special is 15. And max amount of points in general is 50. So you will never have 15 on all stats. So every level past 50 is a chance to refine your character. Maybe experiment a bit by moving around points. Trying different perk cards, see what works for you.

All I want is Dogmeat or some other doggo to be my companion.

they are in nuclear winter BATTLE ROYALE

Somebody was doing doing it with me. I couldn’t ask them what they got.

I honest to God think it's just a meme to hate Fallout 76 at this point.
---
You are so lucky, I have been looking for the white powder jumpsuit for so long
---
The other skins are called 'Inferno'. There's three variations: Mk I, Mk II and Mk III.
---
Yes please, I hate the light from the pip boy so as for now I am forever forced wearing the mining helmet or hat for its more immersive light.
---
Anytime you get one of those specific clothing from an event you get all of them has been that way ...but yes still probably a bug that hasn't been fixed
---
That's how i'm playing too but it is an RPG so I'm role playing as a post apocalyptic ornithologist in the wrong place at the wrong time hopping from bush to bush searching for the Lesser Spotted Scorch Beast. haha
---
Oof...ha
---
You can build on your friend's camp if on same team
---
If they add a fishing mechanic similar to Far Cry 5's it's all I would do in the game. Love fishing in video games
---
I just came back to the game and I can really see how far it’s come.
---
I mean I never said that's the only reason people replay it?
---
Mmm, end game content and some of the expansions its good to have team mates, though doing it alone and hoping for randoms to help can work too.
---
Most of it is just people being nice though. Most of the player base is people who were fans of the series for years, and the series has always been single player RPGs so their souls haven’t shriveled from griefing in online gaming.
---
Add that to the fact that a lot of what a high level player considers trash and gets by the boatloads is really useful for low level players and there you go.
---
The backpack wasn't showing with my science scribe outfit equipped. So it's possible to hide it. Maybe a simple toggle on/off. Or only use it when you absolutely need it.
---
Go do the messenger event, quick! This might not be a unique occurrence.
---
That's more to handle inventory duping as I understand it.  Prevents me selling a gun and then buying back the same time you buy it get 2 total.
---
Is survival empty as well?
---
PLEASE let it be the Kevin cover
---
I’ll try, hopefully I’ll get it
---
This guy literally bought me a copy of the game because he could and we are total strangers,If that doesn't speak towards how great this community is I don't know what does.
---
Really? So these outfits aren’t as rare as I’ve been lead to believe?
---
In the future, release the game as a complete product like it is now. Don't give us a $60 beta please.
---
You've all done a great job improving the game, but that hard work doesn't erase the terrible state that the game was in at launch. You're all still accountable for that. It shouldn't have happened, the game should be finished at launch.
---
But keep up the good work.
---
Oh. I have only done a few so that might be it. Still wish I had one
---
Playing poker with other players would be awesome. You could build poker tables or blackjack tables and have a robot dealer at your camp
---
Wooooow -_-
---
Change your characters skin tone to pitch black and hide in bushes.
---
The server I was in I was the number 1 player for about half an hour,and all I was doing was tooling around as usual. A few people tried to hunt me down but I chameleon jumped away into the shadows to continue my radstag hunting.
---
Thanks for reaching out, message sent.
---
Sooo I got a notification last night saying my character had levelled in Adventure Mode, but upon signing in that was not the case.
---
Balancing reasons. So that players have to take a risk when initiating a heal. I wouldn't mind if they removed it, though.
---
I’ve got around 100 pieces of trash from her so far. Full of nocturnal with bashing etc. But  today she gave me two explosive weapons, one quad .44 revolver and a two-shot thompson SMG. It’s probably her way of saying Thank you for me not whacking any of her cousins lately!
---
Nope. Flamer for Grilled Radstag.
---
Explosive weapon for Crispy Squirrel Bits.
---
There should be a system where players can bet gear as well as caps, and the winner gets everything in the pot.
---
Not sure if you realize, but 50 is the max number of points you have.  So a level 200 player has zero advantage over a lever 50 player.  Play the Adventure mode until you level to 50 then play this mode.  It really doesn't take that long to do.  I have one level 160ish, one 130ish a level 70ish and another 35ish.  In a weekend you'd be there.  Once it becomes common knowledge what perk cards are available then add up how many points you need to equip them and level to that point.  15- 20 maybe.  The bigger issue is getting the right perk cards to drop for you if you have a certain playstyle.
---
Yeah I tried teaming up with people. We would start a party chat but it'll just be radio silent unless someone needs screws. Or I'll be in a team and the other player just disappears and starts doing his own thing. 
---
But what's your time zone? if we're close I'd love having someone to play with. I'm usually on the evenings except on Wednesday
---
Hi, I have played every single Fallout game and I picked up fallout 76 at christmas. I am a level 81 and have about 250 hours I believe. I played Nuclear Winter the day it came out and I am currently a level 8 with 1 win.
---
As a long time Fallout fan, I love it. The gunplay has been improved upon greatly with patch 10, making the combat more rewarding. I’ll probably just describe my favorite game so far to summarize.
---
I first went into the lobby, which takes a bit because you have to go from normal mode to main menu to nuclear winter to lobby to game. That’s 2 loading screens more than it should. A feature should be implemented so that I can enter Vault 51 (The lobby) From the game world. Now, the thing is, Nuclear winter is squads only. So I played with Randoms. I eventually loaded into lobby and I had a great time. I played some guitar with ransoms and had a fistfight in the boxing ring. I landed at Camp Maclintok in the south of the map. I found a set of T51 Power armor and a automatic radium rifle. Very good weapons. I had a level 0 (first game), a level 5 and another level 8 who landed with me and got some mid tier loot. We eventually headed Borth to New River Gorge Lodge and looted up some more. Here we ran into a squad who dispatched our level 5 .The 0 hid in a building. I used a nuke grenade to down one and I finished the other with my radium rifle. The other two must have been killed by level 8. The 0, The 8 and I trekked through the hills toward Flatwoods. Here we saw a couple squads fighting. One from the Motel on the North side and one from the hills opposite in a fortified CAMP. I one shot a player in the motel with a hunting rifle, and as I was about to kill another, he got spooked and ran into a stairwell. I rushed in with my team covering from the tree line. I popped a Psycho and charged in clad on T51b. The first man died quick, and as i Ran up to finish the sniper for I was met with a shit to the back of my head. In two seconds I made work of the last squad mate. We looted up and by this point the other team was down to two and ours was down to two. Me and the Zero against a final squad. The ring of fire pushed us to the field behind the Flatwoods Chapel and I constructed a makeshift fort. A Time passed until a great Scorchbeast flew overhead and decimated a nearby foe that was unseen to us. Us against 1. We stayed put in our Fort after I killed the Scorchbeast. I was in 5 kills, and Zero was on 0. Time passed and I saw a T51b Clad man ploughing across the field, bounding over a river in one jump. I bounced out of the fort and met him in the middle of the field. Our battle was legendary. We dodged in and out of trees until he gave in and he succumbed to the power of my radium rifle. I was now the overseer.
---
TL;DR: It’s pretty neat. Differ t to most Battle Royales because it has Perk Cards, PVE and nukes. Only complaints are: Solos and duos not a thing, Load times and want a few different maps from around the regions of the game.
---
edit: just saw “short opinions” on the title. 
---
whoops
---
Why would you frantically hit H if you know your suposto hold it? Seems like user error here.
---
[deleted]
---
Ok so this is old but maybe someone knows. Can you have your armor on under the swimsuit or nah?  Back in the day the clown windego made you take it off and I don't want to fight a queen twice
---
Yeah
---
Texas hold em
---
I wanna add to this, just saw the trailer for wastelanders, and did you notice that guy whos doing the gold fishing in the water? He had the atom shop backback so maybe thats a new player activity? Could lead to fishing!!
---
You don't have to hold it?
---
One code is your game and the other is your bonus stuff. You'll be mad if you give away your game code and don't realize it until after your friend installed it already!
---
Flamer for sirloin steaks!
---
Same here turned on the mic after shooting at it and the follow me and the gift emote.  Lol.  250 wood and steel for the man.  Should give him a nice start
---
Has you gained any? It was weird i was scratching my head for a while and was 100% i spent them all before NW
---
I gained a level in Adventure from NW today, hope it catches up for you.
---
I downvote your first sentence but your reasoning makes it okay. Lol
---
They are CHUDS not people
---
Yes. Basically the closer you get to the bog the higher the level an enemy is.
---
That really sucks on your first one. I've had good luck with having no disconnects while launching a nuke, but post-nuke launch SBQ fight freezes/closes about 1 out of 4 times on XB1 for me.
---
RNG loves your nuts. Lol
---
You forgot to add cancer to that list
---
Did you read the note at bulletin board? It's when you first walk into fort defiance, through the locked door on your left. If i recall that should complete defiance has fallen and allow you to move on.
---
Lol
---
And there should be people in the vault just not 52 of them. It is a clusterf*** of 52 people just punching each other.
---
Sorry I haven’t see much of the map yet, to understand, is the bog basically the right side of the map?
---
My bad, i thought you were ranting about healing downed players... So many rageacholics here i dont even read these half the time.
---
Adrenaline takes 3 AGI
---
I haven’t. I’ve only gained XP and caps.
---
I got in for a few seconds, was kicked. A friend of mine was also on said the same thing happened, (FYI we were not teamed up at the time). We tried as a team shortly after, same again. Apparently there are not enough people playing on PC at the moment, hopefully the loading time is a simple as that.
---
You mean they take every weapon they come across? Theyre not doing anything "better" than you. Try a round when your team spawns in 3 towns.
---
I have died several times without even noticing I was being attacked from behind because I was distracted by shooting someone in front of me.
---
Ha, it was only fixed on Fallout 4 by modders. Bethesda doesn't seem to care about this one.
---
... and these blast points, too accurate for sand people. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
---

---
This comment section is a sad sight.
---
I love that event! Its fast and the bot is always funny. I already got my handmade plan but have heard its a reward for that too?
---
Just, thank you. A huge thank you! This is the first new video game I've played in 8 years, and I'm beyond glad I chose this one! 
---
Since the update preventing people from blowing your camp up &amp; adding player vending, I've had even more fun, &amp; it's been easier to talk friends into trying it out! &amp; don't worry about the haters, haters gonna hate. Bugs happen with anything, and you guys are totally on top of them the moment you know about them, acknowledging the issues &amp; getting em fixed.
---
I'm just beyond impressed with this game, and wanted to thank you for all the hard work you guys put into this, just to make us happy.
---
Just, thank you. ❤️
---
Did you craft them at an armor bench in adventure or survival? 
---
In NW they should just appear on your character if you favorite them in the Atom shop.
---
Currently a little burned out, so trying to catch up on other games myself, but gonna go with everyone else and say most are in the new mode.
---
I also had this question, so for example; could my fiancé set up a CAMP, have me build some stuff for her then be able to have it there when logging in again or does it disappear when the team disbands ?
---
fucking agreed dude.
---
Get a weapons workbench. Then get the right material and then you have your match.
---
Traditionally, the northern parts of the map are geared towards newer players. Places like Grafton, Mogantown, and obviously Flatwoods. The more south you go, the more challenging it gets. Obviously there are exceptions, and you will sometimes stumble into a group of higher level baddies. I would try and stick to those quest lines first until you get leveled up a bit higher.
---
What’s the other option and if you say just give it to people then it’s not unique
---
You have to craft them at the armor workbench.
---
Nice! Have a great time!
---
There is an option for workbench repair. You can use that if you've saved the right components to do the repair.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
#*LIBERTY PRIME. BACK ONLINE!*
---
for the camp, I've found that placing it in a new area is easy, just go to the stored section and plop it down. easier on flat land though. 
---
bullet sponge enemies are definitely a turn off for some people, especially in a shooter, but you really just have to get stronger or get some help. its not really different than past games.
---
what are the problems with stairs?
---
Look at the other options on screen when in the bench
---
Thank you for sticking with the game, I'm really excited for human NPCs, new quests and more PvE content. That said, I've really enjoyed nuclear winter as well. Please do wastelanders right, because if you do this game has the potential to become one of the largest online RPGs ever
---
That's it. Communication. After I finally gotten a match with someone with a microphone, it was a 10 year old who just sat there and bragged about how good he was an adventure mode.
---
I'm trying to tell them where they're coming from and all he keeps saying is how trash I was because I was level 150 and he's like level 370.
---
He just was not listening to what I was saying. They ended up hitting him in the head and he died instantly. Then I died right after. And he's going to sit there and blame me. Even though I managed to kill two of them and he killed none
---
Press 'Y' and then 'X' for 'repair at workbench'...I'm guessing that is an XB1 'Y' that you're pressing:)
---
Thanks you Bethesda this game has my girlfriend/wife and I so much closer and really gives us an escape from our otherwise crazy and drab(At the same time.) life. One Love from Ohio!!!
---
I found a Post with [the Map Zones marked out and labeled by level](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9vkwc2/fallout76_zone_map_with_level_ranges/)
---
Thanks for sharing that though it is disappointing. I was hoping for something more true to a Roman helmet, I don't like how most things in 76 have this wacky/zany apeal to them, it's just not my thing.
---
Around 5 to 7 usually
---
That would be perfect.  Great Idea!
---
Ohhh I see now it was Greyed out and I just wasnt paying attention i guess thank you :)
---
Take the time to make healing salve, also check your recipes out, some food you can make give health. Check nuka cola machines and dining areas for cola, those are good for health too.
---
For ammo the best advice is to make your own. Gunpowder is plentiful on super mutants and raider corpses or can be made with acid and cloth at a chem bench. Then all you need is steel (plentuful in junk), and lead. Easiest lead is in weights at workout areas like the flatwoods hotel, the fire station, and the prison yard. Remember, ABL, Always Be Looting.
---
Grab a few perk cards in ammosmith and super duper to round things out
---
No the chance that you get it to trigger period is super low so they are still rare but yes you always get the whole set
---
Edit: just not as rare as the ones you only get single like responders fireman ect..
---
:)
---
*CARAVAN*
---
He who fights and runs away,
---
will live to fight another day.
---
Ok thanks
---
No prob, that took me a minute too. Good luck laying hands on all the repair materials!
---
Yeah, suing people for doing something illegal. What sheep.
---
This sounds great!
---
LOL. Interesting strategy.
---
use a armor/weapons workbench just like the last time you played the game, you never need to pay real money to repair or build anything.
---
How about you post on the nexus page, you know the page dedicated to that mod that you downloaded it from?
---
I feel attacked
---
I've been a tough critic at times, but I knew you could turn it around. You're well on your way.
---
p.s. Nuclear Winter is surprisingly great!
---
Can't do that in NW unless you manage to acquire Marsupial during the event. I've only been lucky enough to get Chameleon once which was really helpful
---
Excited to test this out once the kids are off to bed.
---
Have been running a sniper build lately and had accumulated some decent +VATs gear, so it's been my crutch. Paired with an Instigating Lever and Gun Fu it was the lazy mans cash cow for plinking off baddies at a fairly decent clip. Sadly you get accustomed to one shot kills while sneaking through the grounds of Whitesprings, and then I just got flat out lazy.
---
Now with Gun Fu broken I've been looking at other perk distributions as well as wanting to get less craptastic at NW while it's here.
---
Thanks again for the heads up!!
---
I’m rounding level 7 on a new character i started just for NW, sitting pretty with Pennigton(back up overseers mission quest-giver right outside 76), right now i’m a Rank 10 Overseer, i’ve placed top 5 at least twice per Rank after like R3 or so but my favorite favorite thing is how campy you can get while retaining equal xp for an ai kill compared to killing another player. I’m the shadow baby! Downside: first holotape i find in the first R10 room i enter requires R30!!
---
(Edit: I’m excited to level my reg. Character up to see if i can get a level 25 somerset special!)
---
he is now legendary
---
r/iamverybadass
---
Agreed, but the only items you have are ones you gained in survival mode.  And we get to choose where we respawn.
---
It stays. But you can only use one camp. So you can't combine camp storage. And the second teammate can only build new stuff but not move existing stuff.
---
A random helped me build a nicer house instead of my box lol. I had to remove some stuff then he could go to work. Not sure whos matierals were being used tho.
---
EDIT could have been posidion workshop. Have built many boxy houses to hide from snipers while farming cores and lead.
---
Killing guys, but that obviously takes ammo. My suggestion would be following main or stronger side quests, and sleeping before each. Sleeping so you become well rested (after about 30 seconds) will give you 2 hours of boosted xp.
---
Yea I got worried cause all I saw was the payed repair kits at first and I like tunnel visioned on it but I figured it out now thanks :)
---
Appreciate it; bought around xmas; and the game has been installed the entire time.. my Brother is now trying the free week on his PS4, and he HATES multiplayer; but he's having a great time on 76; think he's going to pick up a copy next week ( along with Rage 2 ). 
---
A few requests...... pre match on Nuclear winter, folks take to the stage to play music; it's not appealing to the ear.  Any chance for something nicer to listen to?  
---
On that note, maybe instead of just the "Well Tuned" buff, we could have sheet music in the world with different tunes, that provide different buffs...  
---
Perhaps a rock n roll style that boosts adrenaline and gives you a small defence buff, a Jazz style that improves scope stability or heals health faster when you sleep in a bed; some 12 bar blues give buff to chems? etc.  
---
Also, not sure if it's just me, seeing a lot of floating rocks, shrubs, and landscape that you can walk inside of... been sniped by people a few times, literally hiding inside a mound of earth.  
---
Either way, been playing fallout since number 1 released; still a fan and can't wait for Wastelanders...   
---
And maybe a higher stash limit; and the possibility to take known plans, feed them into a machine to get technical data, that can be exchanged for plans we don't know, or credits that can be used to buy new plans.
---
Events in the Forest and Toxic Valley. Take workshops and do the defend events as well. Biv's dailies are easy and a couple hundred XP.
---
It does for Xbox lol. Just send messages to the person via the xbox
---
Yeah Tod said it at E-Three
---
The only thing I don't like about this is that it would further encourage people to not use there mics. For real people is it such a disadvantage in this type of game to not communicate with your teams!
---
I fucken hate Dauntless too bro
---
Yep. It's how I found my Ghoul Slayer Railway Rifle.
---
Story is a good way to get what seems like a good amount of XP up until around 15, then it seems to fall off and try to push you to Top of the World which is a bit harder than most 15's would handle.
---
You'd also get lower level versions of the legendary rewards some quests give, but IMO only a few of those are worthwhile (and your build has to match).
---
I got to level 7 in about 90 minutes this morning just doing the initial overseers quests and romping around the forest (did run to WS right off the bat to get the fast travel point for some reason).
---
I'm not the biggest fan of seeing every pellets damage lol
---
Yes but obviously only if you have separate inventories first
---
I'm level 106 my teammates are 96 92 and occasionally a 234 we're plenty strong enough that the 4 of us should be able to handle a boss enemy. The sheepsquach event for example. Not that any of it is worth it with the piss poor loot drops.
---
The stairs are usually the item one can't remove because the structure will be inaccessible blah blah. You can't place a roof over the stairway without spinning them.
---
I'm guessing it's a combination of 2 factors. First, lots of people are checking out the BR mode. Second, the massive influx of new people has probably forced them to spin up a lot more servers, which is spreading out the veteran players. It's had to have a map full of vendors when every server I've been on has 15+ low level players wandering the forest. 
---
That said, I'm usually on for a couple hours every night, so if you're on xbox come and peruse my wares. My GT is the same as my reddit name.
---
Side note: this is a very bad week to try nuking the queen. I helped a guy through a silo today and he dropped on fissure prime before I could finish checking the map. Sure enough, there were only 4 people on the server over level 80. Needless to say, it didn't go well.
---
While I concur that Survival mode desperately needs a change, I respectfully disagree with you on what is needed.  To me, Survival Mode suffers from an identity crisis.  I doesn't know whether it is a PVP mode or simply a tougher version of Adventure mode.  Bethesda is trying to appease both crowds, and it's failing miserably.  My suggestion is to simply remove the map highlighter from the game, and focus on players that want a tougher version of Adventure mode.  With this change Survival won't appeal much to PVP players - they now have Nuclear Winter to have fun with.  For me, I always played Survival mode just like Adventure.  It's really fun, challenging, and when you actually do run into another player there is plenty of tension wondering what's going to happen next.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Let's make Survival Mode like what it is in other Fallout games - a more challenging experience of the base game!
---
I've played a couple of different games that lacked UI customization. I can live with it lol
---
Still prefer Automatron DLC levels of friendly robos. Appalachia is the region of automation after all.
---
I just tried Survival today, and found that when someone had taken a potshot at me, and I tried to return fire, it said I was in pacifist mode and couldn't harm other players..maybe the same applies to their turrets?
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
I usually drop low level legendaries for new players that I tend to get from leader of the pack. Just gave one newcomer a level 10 quad 44 pistol. Hope he's happy with it.
---
Right now losing half my stimpacks when I die is a no go so haven't even tried it.
---
More social features will only make this game greater. What if we had a way to make cities and politics.
---
&lt;3?
---
I spawn in. Scramble for weapon(s). Get
---
* crossbow
---
* 10mm
---
* sniper rifle
---
* ...anything but full auto
---
... i'm going to die
---
lol
---
Yeah I feel you but I think it would benefit mic communication even more so you don't have to try give your team compass bearings etc when in combat and can just get straight to the point.
---
Same issue with 4790k and 970. my buddy has the same issue with a 1900x and 1070. it only crashes for us about 50% of the time, seems like its a recent bug in the game
---
Joined the army and read the terminal many times. It just seems like the game got a stroke and gave up.
---
Im not complaining, more would be nice XD
---
Yep I usually do leader of the pack if it ever shows up. Three low level legendaries guaranteed and I give them out. I'm level 127
---
AND THEIR NAMES ARE WHITE NOT RED! Why are they hostile? Is it too much to ask for some indication that they're going to attack me?
---
I think ppl like that have all travling pharmacy perks. So its so much lighter then if they put it in thier stash as you found out lol.
---
Now get a vending machine up and sell them to other players and have all the caps for fast travel!
---
Xbox player checking in, and honestly it's about as stable as I've ever seen it. 
---
I found the tourist at 1pm today and have remained on the same server all afternoon (4.5 hours) so that people could see my post and come get a camera.
---
I can't remember which - but a serum requires it also
---
Outcast power armor paint!!!!
---
no problems here
---
Quest marker didn't indicate going there. Bethesda has a weird sense of where to place quest markers... But I'll go and do that tomorrow. Thanks.
---
Settling with force.
---
Note to self increase prices by 50 caps per chem
---
I'm pretty sure Bethesda's has them locked, I dont think you can rebind them.
---
That was an awesome story! Don't worry about the length; we can let it slide for epic tales and it would be a nice bit for the video! Slightly off-topic however, should I play the earlier Fallouts? I love 3, NV, 4 and 76! Never fully plunged into the older titles! I have to agree, Patch 10 did a world of good for the game in terms of combat! Also; I'm super glad you enjoyed, I am having a blast too! Level 10 with 1 win and 2 second places with it being me and someone else 1v1! Solos are a thing I believe, you just have to disable Fill Team; I did a game with just me against everyone else!
---
Nice😂🤣😂
---
Wait, someone gave up gold for that?! Shouldn't we be donating our spare supplies of canvas?
---
I haven't tried it but doesn't the option when queueing that says something like 'autofill team' allow you to queue solo? I thought I saw somewhere someone saying something about that.
---
Ahhhh got it!
---
Not in NW from what I read. Are you sure?
---
Honestly, I'm just happy you guys went about and fixed stuff instead of giving up when the bandwagoners came along
---
That's wierd, I died everytime and had to re-spawn. I'm on Ps4 also!
---
Well he won with that strategy so you're wrong
---
I’ve been locking a few and leaving one open. I usually need the stuff but I don’t mind sharing. One shorting me while I’m fighting off the next wave makes the game much less fun anyway.
---
Nuclear Winter gives a lot of XP as long as you last a while!
---
I would pay money to buy an item in the Atomic Shop that lets me send the Insult Bot to other players of my choosing.
---
Oh, yes, so worth it.
---
I gave away my high compacity backpack plan before back when it was glitched to where you can learn the mod before using the plan
---
By any chance, were you watching Kevduit's stream?
---
We brought this up as a topic earlier :D
---
Ok so because you have zero interest in pvp that means its ok to ruin other peoples games?
---
Man you sound like a dick
---
Yes if your team wins but you stay in the game with them you'd typically get credit for it. As for your example of the guy who ran off on his own and died, he gets to watch and if you win he gets XP for it, but if he leaves for another game he doesn't. Games havent figured out a way to determine who was an idiot yet unfortunately lol.
---
Also why doesn't it seem right that you get XP if youre dead? What if you happened to die in the last fight but your one teammate stood back waiting for you to die so he could swoop in and get the winning kill? Do you not deserve XP for the win?
---
*tries to sell lots of stuff to get chems*
---
With a custom insult
---
I have a feeling we haven't seen the last of the Scorchbeasts, that there will be some part of the quest involved in properly eradicating them. That scene of the thicc power armor walking into that cavern glowing with what seems to be Ultracite aludes to this I reckon.
---
Is this for an alt?
---
Seriously i see more outrageous baits in vending machines lately, like spoiled meat for 25000 caps, a red dress for 10000. Of course there’s always the toilet paper too.
---
Thank you Bethesda, we all appreciate the hard work you guys have been doing to make the game amazing.  Fallout 76 has come a long way since the first BETA day and I am proud of you guys!  Keep up the stellar work!
---
Seems like it worked out for this guy and he didn't have any protection.
---
I quit playing for a bit because I got hooked on ESO. That game is crack. But I saw the announcement at E3 on what you were bringing to FO76 in the wastelander DLC and now I'm back and loving this game all over again. Thanks for not giving up on this game and continuing to work towards it's true and full potential
---
Yes!  Even Better!
---
I just did this with a $13 Xbox one copy on amazon haha
---
I mean... That just sounds broken. If your not alive your not alive. Seems simple to me but like i said i dont BR.
---
What level do we get the schematics for hellfire power armor? I only see paint jobs
---
Bobby pins are weightless and a form of currency.
---
Yep, I am upset as I was trying to get it by the end of this week thinking to would be probably rank 50 but rip. At least the pink sprinkle power armor is possible for me.
---
I am sick so I missed a week of work and this is what I’m doing with my life instead of being productive.
---
I still liked that game despite the hate too.
---
Same here! Definitely hype for them.
---
Thank *you* for the constant updates and for listening to fan feedback! This is one of the best handled games I've ever seen post-launch.
---
I think you need to be level 5 to start trading.
---
I edited my comment with an example of why it doesnt sound broken
---
I’m well above 400 and am still having fun. The game is getting better with each update. Thank you Bethesda 👍🏻
---
I think I’ll need to move my camp then. I’ve had it on lead because I need a lot, but a single extractor doesn’t produce enough.
---
As others have said, defending a workshop isn't nearly as hard as it seems - You get some resources for doing it, and around 150 to 300 EXP for each "defense" event. If you're in adventure mode, it is really, REALLY rare for someone to attempt to take your workshop by force. For extra benefit, try to make sure its a workshop with resources you can use (i.e. one of the power plants for fusion cores, the ammo factory for ammo, etc.). The events spawn roughly every 15 to 30 minutes, so feel free to fast travel to other areas - you get a warning before the defense event starts again. 
---
The regular events, even low level ones, give a similar amount of experience and good, basic supplies at the end. Things like Fertile Soil can be cleared in less than five minutes. The "horde" events have a good amount of enemies you can gun down for experience. You might not be to this point in the story yet, but the Enclave missions always give good experience for minimal danger - you can usually run past enemies to do them - and if this is a second character, you can "jumpstart" that quest line by just going to its start. 
---
Beyond that... The right side of the map has higher level, but more dangerous enemies. I don't really like the marshes and cranberry bogs, but Harper's Ferry is usually populate by scorched or super mutants. The latter is a bit more formidable, but even level 50+ enemies of those two types can be taken down with VATS headshots from hunting and lever action rifles.
---
😂 honestly same
---
I had a similar issue with the corpse of a SB I killed the other day. It had a weird swirly effect going on in the air around it that others on my team couldn’t see. When they got close their controllers went nuts vibrating like they were being attacked non-stop, but didn’t take any damage. I didn’t get any indication of attacks, but lost ~20% health/sec if I got close.
---
It's possible, but I can't imagine that being b the case everytime cause I kept dying at my camp as well!
---
Other than the laser it’s working fine for me.
---
I'm definitely not in pacifist mode, unfortunately.
---
Now the level 70 is sitting in his base playing his piano laughing his ass off when I make my feeble attempts to sneak up to my brown bags.
---
I don't understand why the turrets are hostile, I went to another guys base earlier and the white named plate turrets didn't bother me, and I didn't bother them, I don't get why these ones are different.
---
I’m melee in my normal life and have noticed even on top of an enemy I can’t hit it sometimes. And I know I’m right on target since it’s a foot away from me. As far as NW I haven’t noticed this problem.
---
I know that they are weightless now but I don't see how and why they should be a form of currency.
---
What platform are you on? Someone can get you a welcome package.
---
Happy cake day
---
It is wonderful to see the lines of communication open between development and end user in a way that is meaningful and with the potential to influence how the game evolves.
---
As an "old man" gamer I grew up around closed environments where you got what you got, and if you had feedback you may as well give it to the wall because nobody was listening.
---
I'm still more of a solo player, but have come across an amazing community both in and out of the game, particularly here on reddit.
---
Keep up the great work BethesdaGameStudios, my Atoms will continue to flow your way :-)
---
Lol actually it was a bunch of really good plans that i already know. But that backpack mod is like 10k caps on fo76 market , had a person willing to pay 13k for it but realized i gave it away.  I personally paid 10k for it and was kinda sad when i realized it was gone lol.
---
Fallout 4 Creation Club is about to get a Vault Jumpsuit add-on that allows you to have the Fallout 3 jumpsuits and make your suit any colour and any number. It would be cool if 76 git this too.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/345509/june-creation-club-sneak-peek-fallout-4/3?language%5B%5D=en
---
I'll check that out, I don't recall having the bloodied perk though.
---
Well... Maybe you should get credit for being 6th player. Honestly dont know if it only gives xp on winning or not. But ya... If your dead you should not get xp for winning the match. That seems like a lot of headache as insted of valuing thier lifes a team can just yolo the other team while one guy hides and they all get winning xp.
---
Got one from the purveyor today, the second star was limb damage, I think it means limb repair lol 😂
---
less base damage than a .50 hunting rifle but faster ROF and vastly better recoil.  So yeah it's a good option but whether or not it's the "best" is personal preference.
---
All that said if you stumble on a good legendary you're gtg.  I still use a zealous explosive lever I found many months back as a backup ranged for stuff I can't 1 shot.
---
I still like the game. Still salty it got abandoned though, I want my Quarian ark goddamit
---
No problem man! What system are you on? If you have a PC maybe we can play!
---
One more addition I'd like to clarify, as of right now if you die but arent the *last person to die* on your team, you get ZERO xp for whatever place you were in when you died. That's just not right at all
---
I thought it was a visual glitch but I confirmed it wasn't because my health went up and stayed when I used a stimpack
---
They are. And if you disconnect, you're likely to lose any progress on them. (Unless that's changed since the last time I played.)
---
Need a grenade in your inventory
---
White man settle with extreme force
---
I still can’t play the game because it won’t connect me to online servers. Now before somebody says it’s my fault, I have tried everything on my end. This doesn’t happen on any other game.
---
Thanks for sticking with the game and looking forward to what it turns into over the next year. 😁
---
I have done that as well, but that will only get seen by the mod creator, this will be seen by the the people who also use the mod and have the means to get it to work.
---
There's alot of armor and outfits in the base game and you can also spend the atoms you earn in game to buy new outfits from the atomic shop. The main player hub is the whitesprings resort in the middle of the map. The main story is maybe 40 hours or so if you get invested into the lore and explore.
---
It's random based on a set pool of mods. Doesn't matter what attachments it already has, it can unlock something completely new. And you can't unlock all of the mod plans that way, some have to be purchased from a vendor or earned as a reward.
---
Yup.  Somerset Special can spawn up to Level 45, depending on the character's level.
---
Yeah I had that happen last night, fast traveled to his camp, bought some stuff from his machine without issue and we even waved at each other, then when I left I went the other direction and got blasted by his missile turrets. At least I was able to get my stuff back though
---
I have a camp with a junk extractor. If you search the pile (even when the extractor is on it. Just look and search at a barrel) you get whole junk items. Deathclaw hide is a potential item.
---
Daddys holding out in that case!
---
Fingers crossed for a double experience weekend again and hoping it applies to Nuclear Winter!
---
Right now there are no player hubs in game just camps. The main story isn’t that long time wise it might only be 5 hours but you have a lot of leveling to do in between. 
---
After you finish the game there are still events to do such as the scorch beast queen or Arktos Pharma I haven’t explored or seen everything and I am level 102
---
When it comes to outfits there are a few but way more in the atom shop.
---
said in Follows-Chalk's voice
---
Hell yeah!
---
That map is very nice, with a couple caveats - Namely, that the Divide isn't nearly as dangerous as the Mire and Cranberry Bog, despite all of them having higher level enemies, and the Ash Heap is less dangerous than those three. 
---
What makes the Mire and Cranberry Bog so dangerous isn't just the enemy level, but the enemy \*types\* you see out of there. There are still "easy" mooks like the scorched and feral ghouls, but you're going to run into things like deathclaws, gulpers, scorchbeasts and so on. If you hit a batch of super mutants, at least one normally has a rocket launcher, and they all have grenades. 
---
After Toxic Valley, I think the main story sends you to Welch, which seems odd because it is so far south of where you are. But the mole miners there are good to beef up some levels and EXP on - they're so big and move in easy patterns to hit.
---
That's why i still had it because i got it before it was fixed so i already knew it and was just waiting for someone to buy it from me. Had a person willing to pay 13k for it and thats when i realized I gave it away.  So i lost 10k i paid for it and lost the extra 3k i was about to get ugh costly mistake. But all my friends did get to learn if for free plus all my different characters learned it to so i wasn't to upset about it.
---
The hero we need
---
That would just look weird overall.
---
I feel that if they introduce the Mechanist style robot companions from fallout 4, everyone would make Fisto as their companion to travel the wasteland with.
---
Not that I'm aware, they really need to add the planters as buildable objects.
---
Just went and picked it up from Walmart on the PC for $17. Have the Tricentennial edition on Xbox and fully switched over to PC and sold all my consoles. Wish stats transferred over as well. Lol
---
Wow thanks, now I’m torn between NW and aimless vendor shopping 🤮
---
Its reasons like this that I wish rocking chairs were more of a thing
---
I wish it was based off attachments though. That makes note sense in my opinion. Wow, I broke a scope, now I know how to make a barrel.
---
Forget these new human NPCs! I'm teaming up with Rose to bring back the Raiders. ;)
---
Is there a link to the actual interview, without all the buzz crap thrown in?
---
I mean you can then be the rock in central intelligence I mean a tactical pouch like an ammo pouch if it was black would go with my greaser jacket and jeans
---
I actually have not experienced it in nuclear winter I have in adventure mode
---
Some Louis Vuitton
---
Thank you. The instructions were not very clear.
---
On Xbox you can but it’s cumbersome.
---
Open your album, open a photo, press the button to get rid of UI shown in the options on the bottom of the photo, then take a screenshot by pressing the Xbox button on the controller and then the button listed near the bottom of the screen.
---
Then it’ll be save to your Xbox live account
---
So innocent :)
---
You can get the Frog Legs perk, which lets you jump just as high as marsupial!
---
Rank 34 overseer. Been playing pretty much non-stop without a crash or diconnect. On Xbox btw.
---
 That's the banned code. If you have not been banned, submit a ticket. If you have not been banned, they will help you sort it out, as they did with me. If you have been, they will not reply.
---
Camp structures are invincible unless you deal damage to the 'owner' of the Camp
---
First time I saw the purple flash, then grunt, my camp spawned in and it despawned. Never fully encountered it.
---
There is the vault tec jumpsuit outfit which is very similar
---
Good luck getting the radium rifle suppressor and red dot!!! Also I can’t get a damn suppressor for the pump after like 2 thousand scraps of that bad boy!
---
There are legendary variants of that, quad has 4 bolts loaded
---
Yes, very much so.
---
Do pc games even still come with discs?
---
I would t say that 
---
I would say that this E3 just gave us a big boost of hope that this can still become a great fallout game 
---
76 still has tons of issues to fix but it's on a much better pace then Anthem now
---
How do you get atoms?
---
How about a bag that works with power armour?
---
I wouldn't go that far, but I really love all the new people around!
---
Is it the one that looks like a mechanic’s jumpsuit? Can you find that in game?
---
Well that sucks.  Guess I’ll wait for Steam.  Thanks
---
I'm 26 overseer lets see if I remember
---
between 10 and 20 theres stash box skins for camp small and medium and two statues bronze and silver or something
---
lvl 13 10mm shark skin
---
lvl  15 blue camo power armor
---
lvl 20 was a blue camo laser rifle skin
---
lvl 25 hot rod flames laser rifle skin
---
You get card packs along the way
---
here is 27-30 rewards:  [https://imgur.com/a/DvG0g8P](https://imgur.com/a/DvG0g8P) 
---
edit: added link for imgur rewards pic
---
I’m not new to the game by any means, however I did just switch platforms. Xbox to PC. Would anyone be willing to help me get up some levels?
---
I'd add that for #3 yes generally the game gets easier though it helps to use a build planner and have an idea what you are trying to focus on.  
---
 [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)  \- for example.  
---
2 tips: items have levels so try to make sure you are using the highest level items possible.  A level 1 hunting rifle does less damage than a level 10 one for example.
---
Also, scrapping weapons and armors unlocks mods that you can add via workbenches.  You can also buy plans from vendors and find them in the wild to learn mods - remember to click on the plans in the notes category of your pip boy to actually learn the mod.
---
Making sure you have the highest level items you can use and adding the best mods you know to them will make the progression feel a lot better and help you keep ahead of the curve.
---
I have always had hope or i wouldn't be playing since beta lol
---
None atm.  Wanted to hop in but not if I’ll have to start over in Steam.
---
Dang your really high haha
---
Yeah, almost the same scenario. I was in an event with like 5 other people where a ton of enemies were coming in waves. I was using an automatic weapon to mow down the wave when a guy in full x01 power armor and about a hundred levels higher than me walks in front of me. Obviously I accidentally hit him (with a whole two rounds) so him and 2 other guys immediately unload on me and kill me. Wtf guys
---
Look the game had problems but now that they have fixed a bunch of bugs it’s getting better. I also think adding human NPCs will help as well. I have always loved the game but there have always been problems. There still are, but Bethesda is slowly fixing them and the people who might have been haters perhaps did not play the game for a while.
---
Ok, good to know. I still gotta figure out my situation, I was able to quickly stimpack once but it helped only for a moment and my health bar shot back down almost instantly. Major bummer
---
 
---
lvl 15 blue camo power armor
---
I'll update this next game to see up to rank 29 and as i level up I know up to 30 if i remember its a photomode frame, another power armor skin and a skeleton picture
---
The perks are only anti armor and faster fire rate
---
 I'm at 105 and will have my build sorted soon. ;)
---
here is 27-30 rewards: [https://imgur.com/a/DvG0g8P](https://imgur.com/a/DvG0g8P)

When you press pause you see a challenge menu and it shows all the things you can do to get them. For instance "kill 10 ghouls: +20 atoms."
---
Wow, what?
---
I bought mine from atom shop
---
GIVE US DOOOOGGGGGMMMMEEEEEEAAAAATTTTTTTT
---
The game is fun but getting booted from servers every hour or so reminds me of anthems servers and that wound is just to fresh. Other wise, it's been much harder than other fallouts which is somewhat nice.
---
Because its easier for most people to hate, must be cool or something
---
If you’re really digging, it’s only $17 right now at various retailers.
---
Yes I have the plans but I don't remember where I found them. If you are on PS4 I can craft one for you.
---
Fuck anthem. I stopped supporting them. They dont give a shit about their game or their fans...
---
A lil side not I only realized a week ago is that you can get mods from guns that you create. This is awesome for the lever action and others you dont encounter often
---
Were you attacking them or did they attack you?
---
I enjoy helping people out too. The other day I found a place with a bunch of hazmat suits so I grabbed them all and just gave them to some lower level characters who may not have any. Hell, I’ve modded some lower level weapons.
---
When I first started the game I was worried it would just be randoms attacking me but in maybe 200+ hours I’ve only been attacked about 2-3 times.
---
It's a glitch that I think someone posted about the other day. I get the notification almost every game but I've only leveled up once. Will hopefully be fixed when they actually release NW.
---
Same
---
Great job, keep up the good work!
---
I editted to say that part but they killed me first then when I came back i went to kill them for killing me.
---
Adventure mode?
---
I see what you did there
---
 Speak English Trooper! We are not fluent in whatever it is you are using, to communicate.. ;)
---
 Repair and durability are somewhat nuanced, and one could explain if there was any interest.
---
Darn unfortunately I’m on Xbox, appreciate the offer though. I’ll do some digging on YouTube and see if I can find the plans.
---
Yeah though through all it's problems I've always felt people have just been extremely negative towards it because it's like 'trendy' to do so or something.
---
Not survival mode if that's what youre asking.
---
I had to level up to get supressors I think 3 or 4 perk but once I got there I was able to silence all of my weapons, which sounds dope until you want to attract attention
---
I havent seen this at all, might be on your wnd
---
Everything is viable but power armor and melee are definitely the easiest to upkeep.
---
Every time you level up there are new cards available and until you reach level 50 you get to choose 1 special point and 1 card every time you level up.
---
Cards need a certain amount of special points, like let's say slugger, slugger level 3 requires 3 strength points to equip.
---
Somewhere in the late 30's I ran into a scorchbeast and attacked it. If I'd been paying a little more attention I might have noticed it was level 80 and not one of the level 50's I'd been killing. The fight didn't go well.
---
It's not worth much I'll buy it for 200 caps later
---
Saying that is like saying "Ah, I'm not gonna bother playing Modern Warfare, because I didn't like that one gun from Battlefield 1" its ridiculous
---
Power armor isnt end game at all
---
I could tell, and I know a lot of others could too, that the game was gonna be a major flop before it even came out. I’m so glad I didn’t give in to my friends telling me to get it because that would’ve been a wasted $60...
---
It's a way to get around cap limits. Basically it's a player instituted cap-like system. You buy them, opening up cap supply to sell other items, then when you need more caps, you sell a bundle of them. 
---
And at some point someone probably duped a ton of them so they could get "free" money.
---
A most welcome twist on the torrent of ‘I met a level 2 and gave him the deeds to my farm’ posts. Can only spend about ten minutes on here lately before I have to pop a disease cure after ‘you have contracted diabetes’ flashes up on my HUD.
---
Theyre 12k caps at vendors, think bos vendor has it
---
What can I say, shit happens?
---
Looks like they got the last laugh...
---
Nope. End game is what you make it
---
dear bethesda, please add gloves so i dont have to look at my poorly digitized hands with maxson's battlecoat. modders did it fairly easily, so can you. thanx
---
The strength of legendary armor is the effects rather than the DR.
---
You can stack the effects, so if you have 5 sentinels pieces that up to 75% damage mitigation if they all proc.
---
5 Unyielding armor pieces gives you +15 to all stats except endurance at low health.  etc.
---
Honestly I only use it for a nuke zone. The cores drain pretty fast now and I don't like using it anyway. 
---
Melee is still extremely powerful but in my opinion you don't need to do that instead if guns. Just don't bother with shotguns.
---
Yeah I’ve got the perks and everything ready, just can’t find any of the vendors that have it. Which one is bos?
---
 I have no problem hopping about and killing shit. I don't use VATS though.
---
Okay thank u very much
---
Plus it gets you caps, which I feel is another thing you lack at low levels
---
If you have a platform attached it it above it won't let you remove it
---
Banned
---
In adventure mode, pvp isn’t initiated right away. If you attack them, it just does slap damage until they agree to fight. Once they attack back, pvp is on and everyone dies full damage.
---
I’m probably gonna scrip it if anything I just was wondering if it’s even worth using over another gun. If I get the right receiver the damage might be equal to my explosive AR. I just don’t know if explosive is better than AA or not
---
Sucks that this is all locked behind the mode I will probably play the least. Been wanting atom cats stuff since launch and now I have to grind NW to get it.
---
They did, atleas as i heard from the news
---
Ok hope you find it.
---
It’s a decent weapon, especially with commando/ rifleman perks. Well worth keeping mate.
---
Edited to add that it won’t break stealth the way an explosive weapon does and you should fully upgrade it (with ap mag) hardened receiver etc.
---
Try watoga super duper mart
---
Might be someone alt character that they hooked up with low level legendaries
---
Then how is they one shot me before i ever attacked them?
---
That is likely some of it, but I think for a lot of folk they could not stick through the bugs and are coming back now.
---
And it makes them invincible?
---
Thanks, I’ll hang on to it then!
---
Theres more particles in nuclear winter from the fire. Maybe thats tricking u
---
I love Fallout but was afraid of 76 due to backlash. I finally got it free with my Xbox and immediately bought it again for PC ton ppl lay with a friend.
---
No, THANK YOU for sticking with it and making a fun game.
---
My friend and I both have experienced this exact issue. Haven't found a solution.
---
A change that happened when Bethesda made camps invincible several updates ago.
---
I don’t believe it was intended to have that change move to survival
---
Sorry for being annoying, but top 5 players or top 5 teams? I literally just died with my team in 5th place but there were 5 guys remaning so I was like top 6.
---
And I got lucky because I've never gotten that far lol
---
u/aten_ra
---
Im gonna just record bugs as I see them and post them once a day when I get up in the morning. Thats yesterdays.
---
It’s battle royale with the framework of fallout.
---
Yeah, I was expecting to die but when I didn't I was like what the heck, I actually said the other work but whatever, but I was glad I didn't
---
I think the idea was to generate more interest in the game in general, by offering more content.
---
I dont, they just added a new game into their previous game. Its called pub g. I like fallout not pub g
---
Yeah I mean it has always been a live service. People seemed to think after/during the beta that the state it was in would pretty much be the state it's in for the rest of it's life.
---
Both, really. Just being near the top is good for xp.
---
I have a camp built on a junk pile. If you search junk piles (with an extractor you need to look at a barrel and "search" will pop up) you'll get whole junk items like fans and I've gotten a deathclaw hide from that. If you regularly use one in camp you can get it eventually.
---
There's literal tons. You can have it be earned through quests, certain enemy drops, very obscure world spawns et cetera. You can still even have it be from fishing, if it was added, you just can't have it be tedious like most MMO's or MMO lites do, that becomes a problem.
---
Raider power armour and Whitesprings
---
To your (I'm assuming) non legendary shotgun, quite possible.
---
Thanks!!! This is great news.
---
They took a risk with 76 and it’s finally paying off now! I’m just glad to see more people coming around to the great experience the game offers.
---
I know. Considering this isnt the final build, it will be better when it comes out
---
You said you shot them 8 times then they one shot you. If you shoot first, the next shot they land on you is full damage which explains the one shot
---
As someone who has played since release, through the ups and downs and bugs, the game is quite fun in spite of it all.
---
I will, however, temper it with this:  betas need to be longer.  This one thing will help y'all avoid PR snafus and such.  We're willing to wait for quality.
---
THANK YOU! I’ve been looking for the same plan and losing my mind. I’ll try this.
---
Just keep it up and we’ll keep playing
---
I regret buying it....
---
Yeah my buddy had a similar problem where it wouldn't give her any place markers. Our solution was to make her team leader so i see her quests and quest markers and can provide guidance for her that way. 
---
Also if you have a lot of active quests, can throw things off a bit. Sometimes helps if you disable everything but the single quest you're working on at the time. Gives better quest markers that way.
---
I honestly wouldn’t mind the BR mode to stay in beta and stay available for a while longer. I’m enjoying my time in Nuclear Winter.
---
No they ine shot me them when i respawned i went back to fight them to get my stuff back.
---
It’s a sideshow to most of us.  It’s a fun place to visit, but I’m not gonna live there.
---
Seems like now they are doing more skins/paint (such as 4 Horsemen) where the skins apply to any armor (or multiple types of armor), rather than schematics to actually build that type of armor.
---
 That's a good question. I have the Long Barrel but that's not uncommon.
---
They didnt have anything on.
---
I just need them to announce robots for our CAMPS. My shop desperately needs a Mr. Handy.
---
It doesn't. It sounds like you either didn't have it in or were already engaged in the PvP when you turned it on. Pacifist mode only means you can't hurt them not the other way around.
---
I sell 3 star legendary for 300-400 I might be lowballing it.
---
Hey they shouldn't have released  it half finished to begin with 
---
Bet you wouldn't pay for half a big mac and hope that you get the other half later
---
I hated the idea of this battle royale. But turns out it's the best way to add a relatively balanced way to PvP, with no OP builds. And it's quite fun to pass the time.
---
I don't even use my power armor not even when I'm fighting the schorched beast queen and I have melee because I hate making bullets all the time do melee is cheaper
---
That’s what happens to me a lot at my camp I’ll get swarmed by invisible ghouls that haven’t rendered yet
---
Yes you can on a team. Neither can move or change what the other places but it’s doable. We built my teammates camp together, I built the main house with my materials in his camp and he built the electrical and vendor porch area out of his stash but it’s still his base. The whole thing respawns for him
---
You just need to learn how to properly accessorize baby.
---
Who cares? The battle royale is very enjoyable and fun to play with friends, this is one of the only battle royals I’ve found to be fun. Just stop being so negative! 😊
---
Were you wanted before they shot you? Or did you claim a workshop first? Something made you open to pvp. Once they killed you that ended pvp. So your revenge shots didn’t do anything if they didn’t attack back
---
If only I had more options. 😎
---
....what are u talking about?  This is just a taste of nuclear winter
---
You guys are doing great! And thank you for the wonderful game!
---
As in naked, except for tighty whities?
---
Apperantly i care. I didnt like pub g and still dont. Killed survival for me, so yea i care. Il be negative if i want!
---
Yeah I recommend nuking the burrows though instead of white springs ( its a new dungeon in harpers Ferry)
---
KEEP!!!!!!
---
My Gatling keeps bugging and shooting randomly into the ceiling.
---
Keep doing what you are doing guys! I and I'm sure a lot of other people really appreciate the work youare throwing in this game! Keep it up!
---
PvP been dead since it started, I'd expect big changes to come to try &amp; entice people to play it,but it's just not a mode for everyone
---
Yea i was hoping the hype will die down in a couple weeks
---
Go be negative somewhere else then
---
I hope so... Oh and happy cake day!
---
I would die for you Bethany Esda.
---
Nope ive taken nothing and attacked no one i do t believe in attacking random people for no reason they frist started attacking me when I was in a vendor but couldnt do anything to me then I was trading with another person when they attacked me.
---
You can just buy the tricentennial stuff on PS4 for 11.99 for the beta
---
Nuclear winter is not pubg.  It has some similarities but that’s because all the BR games have the same framework.
---
Are they trying to download "fallout 76"? Because I've seen it listed as "fallout 76 trial". So completely separate item in store.
---
Well i know im in the minority. Ive spent a lot of time on my build and camp etc. Pub g just isnt my thing. Hate running all frantically looking for random drops. Just isnt skilled in my opinion
---
Glad to hear!! but lets not forget we still got a long way to go! Ive had multiple crashes lately =( and is there a way to not have daily quest stuck on one server but instead a 24 hour count down for the player, so when the game disconnects from the server and reloads we dont have to restart the whole mission again with less caps and ammo and warn down armour.
---
Come on Bethesda! Some of us need to look fabulous out in Appalachia!
---
I think there are more new players due to the free trial. As a result, less vendors per server.
---
im not talking about vats. ive been using semi auto forever and im telling you right now they fucked up midair aiming.
---
Add all the decorations that are in vault 51 for us to build with! Wallpapers! Flooring! ALL OF THE DECOR AND THE WORKING SHOWERS, STOVES AND SINKS! Please!!
---
Likely less for most of us regulars.
---
It depends on what build you ha v e and what your fighting but I will buy for 200
---
I think it means both. The sneak peek is just a beta and they are testing it out. It will go away I think after the one week free trial is up.
---
Thank you so much for the game I came in late (about 3 months ago) and was so glad I did, I love this game.
---
  
---
And never have I seen a online community that is as helpful and friendly as FO76. From day one people giving me gear and plans. and helping kill big mobs.
---
It's a great game and I am so excited for everything to come! :D keep on being awesome!
---
Also also you could make sitting and sleeping long press buttons to avoid laying down while a supermutant beats you to death! Oh i can dream
---
I mean fallout 76 is very experimental for the companies software.  It was kind of necessary to have a robust community that can test and flesh things out.
---
Probably 2k if you find the right buyer otherwise 1k if your just trying to get rid of it
---
Start at 4.5k lower it by 250 each day until it sells. Also you should be trading it not selling it. Imagine your dream weapon and u can get it with that.
---
Me and my brother got it before beta, he didn't like it. I liked it. Guess who's now level 62? I am! **I also launched my first nuke today!!** I love this game! I love how it okay and I love the community so much, thru make the game 10x better!
---
Nuclear winter isn't what everyone was looking for but that doesn't mean you have to play it. I don't like survival, so I don't play it, it's not hard to do something like that. That's what the haters need to learn.
---
No id rather complain on redditt where people who play the game and where bethesda might see my opinion, rather do that than complain to my wife Lol im good right here
---
I mentioned that to him and he said it was still trying to charge him. Honestly, he might just be an idiot and I gotta go see him in person to sort it out, idk.
---
I was hoping we could use the armor in adventure mode
---
There* 
---
But yes I 100% agree and would totally live there if this happened.
---
Sounds like the acid/Pi** attack was bugged, try waiting a bit more before you get close, if you can
---
From where did u get that
---
Sorta you might sometimes run into a glitch where all your items are just gone. 
---
But that is rare
---
Just gonna farm campfire tales for my last badge lol, these possum challenges too much of a hassle 😂
---
Yeah. I didnt think the game would be perfect.  Its a whole different game now
---
 LOL. Do you have any idea how many Handmades and Lever Actions I have made and scrapped, because I sure don't! I lost track long ago.
---
 A note. I got the Hardened Receiver for the Handmade on my first scrap, Suppressor much later on my last one. Its RNG but with a thumb on the scale. ;)
---
Yeah it's definitely very niche especially considering its in a fallout game where most die hard fans are all for the adventure mode anyway.
---
Talking about the whole game in general 
---
I am having a decent time with NW right now
---
Not for me it wasnt, i had a lot of fun and always had constant pvp going on. Teams of people were atta king my camp etc. Since NW its dead like i was saying. Just not even close to the same.
---
I would assume so. Just so excited to see where it all goes
---
That depends on the type of color blindness.
---
Standard vault 76 outfit
---
I legit bought it a second time while it's on sale just to support it and to give my disc copy to a friend
---
BETHESDA, YOU'RE BREATH TAKING
---
That's which one does it. Thank you for this. I have done it before but I have all of them to search so I didnt know which one was it.
---
There’s a free trial week, Nuclear Winter is still new and novel, and Wastelanders has reassured people who were worried about substantive future content. We’ve had a lot of good stuff come at once, of course there’s a positive mood.
---
Well aware of that. I'm talking about whet there's nothing and it won't let you remove it
---
I found it odd that I did get a level on my main from playing I was so happy. \^\_\^
---
You on? I’m bored!
---
None of the headwear has armor stats, just a few with -1 perception if it’s useable as a gas mask. A beer helmet gives as much protection as a combat helmet or a fedora.
---
Only exception is power armor
---
Just to hear "Good day to you" everytime I come back home would bring a tear to my eye.
---
And now you are last in the main comments. Congratulations
---
You have Instagram or something I can message you on?
---
 Really. I was doing it earlier. I'm on PC.
---
Early game it's easier for me to have a box house with all the essentials I can drop at a moment's notice. Late game I find a cozy mineral to set my extractor on and things get pretty outta control from there lol
---
The same thing has happened to Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, Skyrim, Battlefield 4, ect.where they were horrendously buggy on launch and people hated them because of that. They all made comebacks and are now loved. I can't wait to be part of the small group that stuck it out had have evidence of advocating for it to my cynical friends all this time when it makes an amazing comeback and it is remembered as a good game.
---
I've seen those drops but never got any supplies from one. Did another player just to it first or am I missing something?
---
Lol it's possible. Unfortunately i can't provide much more info as i already own the game. So i can't exactly confirm the process. I just know if i go to store and do a fallout 76 search i see 2 separate items , one for the actual game and the trial is literally called "fallout 76 trial".
---
But your'e not the first to post this question, so maybe something else going on? I'd suggest doing a search in this subreddit, perhaps one of them has the answer you seek.
---
Knowing the Overseer she's gonna leave you a holotape saying "meet me at the crashed space station" but when you go there shes like "actually I had to go to watoga. Meet me there instead." She's like Peach in the original Mario games.
---
Got everything except lol Facebook or discord or in game haha my mic is finally working
---
You guys are doing great. We got your back.
---
I have seen it sometimes but it is never over 1% of my health. What level are you?
---
\+Karma  u/homerspinsome
---
Just a lot different than fallout. Has nothing to do with anyth 8k ng ive done in fallout the last few months. Just run frantically from fire looking for random drops. Just isnt skilled, lot of luck and at a frantic pace
---
*cough* metal gear survive *cough*
---
It even makes Ames moving forward after a year people from other area have heard about the area becoming a little safer and moving back
---
But last I’m downvotes
---
This game is awful
---
If you launch the game on PC via the .exe and not the launcher you can have two open at once.
---
$17 for unlimited stash.
---
 I think Wallace has it once in a while.
---
I'm just hoping it increases the future player base and support for this game.
---
Survival mode. No one is in there cuz they’re all at NW. u get more exp in survival
---
Currently im lvl 78.
---
But we wouldn't talking about the game as a whole.  At least fallout 76 isnt like Anthem lol
---
It depends what build you're going for. You should have a good idea by level 30 odd.
---
Bloodied is the top meta.  PA sucks overall.  
---
All the good systems revolve around specialized, standard armor.  
---
I only use PA in a nuke zone.
---
Spam and a rifleman
---
Fits with the lore better too, you can’t have four overseers. It should make you turn on each other in the end.
---
Another player may have gotten it first. If they call it in, they get a marker as to where it is,
---
Nuclear Winter great, and I can’t wait for updates to the mode!!
---
Thanks :)
---
If you want to have your cake and eat it too, you’ll have to make a gross floaty base
---
One foundation and a staircase, build upwards from that
---
Can drop single foundation bases almost anywhere
---
sir, and I'm happy to help
---
I normally hate battle Royale games. Nuclear winter is so great. It’s like fallout is the perfect set up for the game mode all the way down to the wild fire storm
---
Yikes man, sorry. It especially sucks knowing that every thing they showed off at E3 was fake and just animation. They didn’t have a single mission made by 2017 time.
---
Damn, now that you mention it, it’s been a good 40 hours of playtime since I last saw them. I swear I used to see them every couple hours my first 20 levels or so when I was broke af lol
---
 I take tiny bits for no reason, but so tiny that it does not affect my bar.
---
That's awesome. I was thinking of making a high level scrounger perk in FO4.
---
Basically, you could see how many lootable items were left in a dungeon.
---
My friend was like, *sniff* i sense at least 2 desk fans in here.
---
Well that's a bug, I was building In my camp yesterday and I somehow put a roof twice in the same place
---
I am as well. And I was one of those people that was, you could say fucked off over the addition of a BR mode.
---
It’s a little odd with all the new players learning the mechanics. Someone earlier thought they could take my manta man costume. 
---
Not costume, suit. I am the real manta man after all
---
Haha I swear to god if I have to run around the map again just to actually meet her imma be disapppionted
---
This is my experience playing with a PS4
---
There are a lot less crashes and server disconnects. Bugs in general have gotten a lot better. 
---
Player vending has added a lot to the game. There are some new events and quests. Overall I think it has improved tremendously.
---
I have mine in pacifist mode and I get tagged for PvP when griefers melee me and my unstable isotope or electrically charged procs and damages them. Then of course they kill me and lewt my junk. So yeah it really shouldn't. 
---
I was crafting fluxes in whitespring shop one time and a guy ran up to me and hit me with his buttstock of his rifle and the Mutation procd and I got flagged for PvP from it. Lost my fluxes.
---
Nope.. Everyone is just playing cause they are masochists. Nothing good here.. Back to r/fallout for you.
---
Well considering that riflegaming and his friends launched 3 nukes on one sever I would say yes
---
Hold up lets wait till wastelander's to come out before call that. Its almost there.
---
$10? Where?
---
Darn kind of feel sad I bought the Tri edition for like $80 about 8 months ago. 
---
Haven't played it much till I came back to it just a few days ago.
---
But even at $30 this game is a steak for how much it improved.
---
Im a bloodied build and it does around 10-20% damage to me
---
Take your upvote
---
Only way to play.
---
Well, I appreciate the hell out of the hard work put into this game even if it is still buggy that doesn't matter to me. I enjoy my time in Appalachia and I enjoyed fallout 4 even though it seems whatever y'all put out people cry saying they liked the last one etc.. just keep doing what you do!
---
people had to put up with an extremely broken game for months before the issues got ironed out. the game did suck, but you weren't playing when it did
---
But it’s fuuuuun!
---
AND. 
---
Bethesda is a BUSINESS. First and foremost. A business needs customers. This is the perfect addition for a well rounded game to please the masses. Stomping your foot and kicking those rocks is going to change nothing.
---
Whats does spam mean?
---
Different letters.  Those are the ones with bulbs in them.  
---
Watoga or Whitesprings should have them.
---
Depends on what you want.
---
Mobility at lower levels, but at this point my CAMPs main function is the vending, I have it parked convenient to WS and the train station. 
---
Since I moved there I’m selling LOADS of junk, flux, scrippable legendaries, and plans.
---
I’m averaging about 15 sales per play session and 6-12k in caps just in buyers.
---
I’ve only sold 3 things for over 1k caps individually
---
FEATURE REQUEST: The hud element showing how many launch codes you have and if you have a briefcase is nifty, but I would like to ask that, if you do that, consider expanding it to show the same icons near your teammates' icons in the team list so we can know for sure if the whole team, if they pooled their inventories, have enough to nuke. Was able to get one off because another teammate and myself found a couple codes separately and killed the briefcase carrier, but it only happened because one guy had voicechat and had a fortunate drop. Probably already aware, but I wanted to reaffirm that it would be appreciated.
---
LMG
---
 So very interesting indeed. If you are on a console that means there is some kind of aim control, that I have never seen on PC.
---
I would prefer different breeds of dogs throughout the wasteland but you can only have one. This would make sure no ones dog looked the same
---
Im on xbox so it might be different. think ima scrap this post and clarify all of the things
---
It does not if you're not already engaged. I run pacifist all the time and have yahoos swinging at me regularly. It procs and I'm still good.
---
Well who knows from her tapes there is a high possibility of her being dead
---
Yea im sure it was a good business move, brought all the fortnite kids over. Probably sold a bunch of games
---
Weird that it is taking away that much of your health. It doesn’t happen that often for me.
---
 Your aim bot is broke! ;)
---
Same here, but it was super mutants. I was level 30ish, they were level 48+ with mini guns. I ran around like hell, stimpacking myself over and over until I managed to claim victory. Such a great rush.
---
Play the game and make your own opinion 🤣😂😂 if it was Bc of reddit I wouldn’t play any games Bc they are all bad
---
There is a good amount of both damage reducing as well as damage enhancing items that can be tailored to lower level characters.
---
You'll find a lot of mules (accounts used for holding items from high level characters) or very well equipped alternates (characters that have been loaded with great items appropriate to their low level from other characters or buddies)  roaming about Appalachia.
---
If they're griefing you, hop to another server.
---
Otherwise no harm, no foul, wave hello and carryon with your own quest line.
---
You're gonna die a lot in this game (a lot, a lot, a lot). Worst case in Adventure mode is that you lose some junk... If in PVP mode, then dying is the point, and it costs some caps to boot.
---
Probably losing well fed buff or +hp chems wore off.
---
Nope, it's an outfit so it goes on the outside of everything else you're wearing.
---
It happens like every hour once
---
It’s currently in Beta I am sure they will fix it.
---
Haha was just about to say at least 76 is going in a good direction now unlike Anthem
---
Update: I am apparently strong enough to solo SBQ, only about 10-15,000 bullets, 20ish stimpacks, 13 nuka cherry, 11 nuka cola, 2 quantum and 3 deaths. 6 minutes to spare.
---
I know in the trailer she was the one talking so I kinda figured we would meet her and she’s somewhere in Appalachia
---
that's a good weap.  i'd use it until i found a similar max level.
---
White springs? Is that where other players gather alot?
---
Who cares? legendaries are the reason survival pvp is garbage, I've got a full set of legendaries and bloodied gear you don't see me crying about it, I'm loving NW and you're not because your mad you don't have an unfair advantage to hold over other people any more in pvp. Get Bent Smooth Skin.
---
I’m not a battle Royale guy at all but it works so good on NW. you should definitely give it a go
---
What system?  I have a plan for sale. PS4
---
Power armor has never been end game
---
Glad I only player first person then ;) thanks!
---
 I dunno we have had what affects me, since the beta and its trivial.
---
  I dunno why or how your Bloodied build would bite you, but its not the normal intermittent damage bug.
---
I don't take drugs + I dont have food lol so i most of the time have ap taken away from me
---
If it shows you have space on the bar, close the game and go back in.  
---
Check your stored tab too.
---
Have you tried messaging any community managers or other Beth employees on twitter like Matt Grandstaff (https://twitter.com/gstaffinfection)?
---
Great minds think alike lol
---
I hope we can, but with the fact that she's sick at the end of her holotapes and anyone who can save her is dead, then there is a slim chance
---
Beautiful, will do. Thank you.
---
Sold one for 10k 3 days ago. People are going crazy for bloodied weapons
---
Is it over stairs? If so it’s a bug.
---
This dude doesn't fortnite
---
The insult is you arent worth insulting
---
More skilled then having your legendary gear do all the work for you actually, it actually takes more skill because you can't spam V.A.T.S but please keep bull shitting maybe you might fool somebody. Smoothskin.
---
The plot twist is gonna be she IS a holotape
---
Thank you.  This was my first MMO and if it hadn’t been for Fallout 76 I would never have ventured into an MMO and I now play ESO as well.  You guys produce two of my favorite gaming franchises so thank you.
---
I grovel at their feet. I am not worthy.
---
How do legendaries make survival garbage? Not sure what your talking about. Im not loving nw because i dont like battle royal on any game. Theres no skill just people frantically looking for randon drops, whoever finds the best equipment usually wins. theres no skill and its boring. In my opinion, so get bent scrotum breath
---
They should really make it so the grenade deploys when someone not on your team checks your loot bag instead. Either that or make the grenade that drops while you're still living, but downed, not kill you.
---
Something sounds off there [maybe try rebuilding your database?](http://www.gadgethelpline.com/rebuild-sony-ps4-database/)
---
It really just depends on how you play. I’m lvl 63, and have set up a number of bases, finally settling in NW Whitesprings. (I know, nukes, but they’ve only been a problem once.)  I always used to set up my base in a hollow square around my farm next to a water source to make mad amounts of water/adhesive. Nowadays I find everything I need and instead set up a 6x2x3 tower with no farm, and two purifiers for visitors to my shop. I keep a mortar on the roof (launches across Whitesprings) of the third floor, with some defense stages for getting up close and cozy with any scorch beasts that don’t take kindly to my missile turrets.
---
I do kind of have a desire to make a one square foundation raised camp with a low budget so I can basically make a mobile mortar fort.
---
I think it has something to do with the excavator power armor since i use that thing nearly all the time. Maybe mine is glitched or something.
---
Do you get anything special for winning?
---
Sure, hit me with a time and I can join if you would like.
---
Love the first sheet but this one isn't working. I believe it's because it's set to view only so wont let me expand on the +, or am I doing something wrong?
---
\+1, Fishing would be a dream come true.
---
Bow ya shits, bow before your Overseer!
---
Not according to u/Cl88t. But he's probably garbage at pvp without his full assassins set. B)
---
Dude I was playing it and I’m a woman in my 40’s 😂   It’s a fun little side show :)
---
You have no idea what my build is or how i play, dont care if you do or dont either way. Dont use vats either, hardly works in pvp but doubt youd no that. Your just a scrub at fallout thats why you like nuclear winter
---
Thank you! Just sent this to my friend who was struggling to find it!
---
Yeah thank you Bugthesda for not breaking anything major every single patch 😉
---
Graham and the cow are all over the place.  You have to get lucky...
---
 Do you know where they are in your Pip Boy? They may not appear after enough time and may need to be clicked on to show up on your screen
---
 Otherwise I dunno.
---
it is thank you
---
Part of me wants to make sure they are ok, but I really just need a gamma gun plan.
---
"How do legendaries make survival garbage" Theres no balance obviously and it's dominated by people with duped legendary TSE and full sets of Sent/Assassins but somebody with your intelligence can't understand the concept of balance in a pvp game mode so GET BENT!
---
Give the story a chance—in my opinion, it’s one of Bethesda’s best. I can’t tell you the number of times I listened to a holotape and just had to stop and cry because it was so heartbreaking. 
---
Thematically, it’s beautiful too. Don’t want to spoil it, but the themes of working together/cooperation is actually kind of beautiful.
---
I know a lot of people enjoy it, glad you all do.  Just changed the rest of the game for me and the rest of us in the meantime
---
Every BR ever has been like this. It prevents kill stealing. Makes perfect sense to me.
---
Hmm I had to stop playing due to school for a few months nothing happened to my character. That sucks.
---
Scaley skin requires coal to make, I've had that recipe for so long and have only come across enough coal to make 2 of em!
---
They have already visited this post lol.
---
5 to 10 minutes is optimistic, been waiting for 20 minutes so far, just to find a match :(
---
thing with Anthem is it would take like 2 years just to get it up to date with current games.
---
Right, but if someone finds them I can join their server.
---
Its best if you pick one style of weapon. Like rifleman will take 9 cards alone to max out damage.
---
I added a bit of grenaider to my rifleman cause i found some good legendary.. So i dont mind losing a bit in the damage department. But going rifle/comando will prob make you too weak in both areas.
---
But...Anti armor is good aginst most things.
---
Instigating is great aginst pve with a high base damage
---
Furious is good on rapidfire guns
---
So is vampire.
---
Bloodied is prob the best damage you can get but your constantly at 20% health so..you are also 1 shot away from dying.
---
 You can starve to death you know. ;)
---
Ive got a chameleon set too. Lol i enjoyed figuribg out my build and how to use it. Your probably garbage at fallout thus why you like nuclear winter
---
Those crates are not instanced
---
You take the loot from it, you’re preventing anyone else taking it
---
If another player called it in and you pick it open, you will become wanted
---
Currently very addicted to the mode. Started two days ago and am almost Level 30 with a good amount of wins.
---
So far I usually use 50 cal LMG, Handmade, Radium Rifle, Combat Shotty and Double Barrel Shotty. The shotguns mostly because they synergize with my shotgun and damage perks. You'll be able to take on entire teams with correct perk management. If you fight in third person you'll be an unkillable monster with the combat shotgun and some good perks. Enter a room and John Wick everyone.
---
For changes, I'd suggest a quick match option when you're dead. I just want to queue while I watch my team, and skip those two lengthy loading screens. It'd be much better if you could pop back in quicker. I dread going to V51 after Evey match because of the waits.
---
Thanks, but does nuking white springs still work in terms of legendaries?
---
That's why it's called nuclear winter. Everything is radio active, hence the brighter screen.
---
To be fair, the paper bag can occasionally be difficult to spot in darker terrain or places with high brush. I think not only for visibility sakes, but for user convenience, they should replace the paper bag with one of those tiny new NW loot chests, as they are a nice bright blue and yellow that is quite visible among most ground colours.
---
I just use my handmade
---
Lol i played that game when it was a singleplayer zombie hoard game. Then overnite they switched it up and its was popular. Couldn't understand why ppl liked it so much only to realise they copied pubg. Haha
---
Someone who never plays it and obviously sucks at it and has not much of a clue how to do good at it would have an opinion like that.
---
I want more light hats in general, it's kinda annoying just being stuck with the mining helmet/hat if you want to see anything. Or just add flashlight mods to the weapons, a gun with a flashlight on it would be pretty bad ass actually.
---
Simple: Don't play it. Not like no body plays Adventure Mode. Even if literally everyone stopped playing Adventure Mode its because there is honestly not much in the way of comtent to keep long time players, well, playing. Go grind the same events and areas for the millionth time. When Wastelanders comes out Im sure a majority of the people who stopped playing Adventure will come back.
---
I think they've messed with contrast or some shit so the dark places look darker
---
I beat the piss out of the cow I milked with a shovel. I think the first one knew something was up cause even though I milked it, I didn’t get credit for it. That one died via shovel as well.
---
You can probably get around it by putting in a 2nd stairs to the floor you’re trying to reach. Remove the stairs under the empty roof space. Then put your roof piece in. Once the all the roof piece are installed you can put your stairs anywhere you want.
---
Any word on why random items are losing stars?

Or that i think about it, it maybe is loosing the well fed bonus im going to try it out tomorrow and tell u the results
---
But with the Wastelanders dlc npcs, settlers and raiders are coming back so maybe someone was able to help her. That or it's an eyebot that's been running around spitting out holotapes lols.
---
You juts want a good gun. 200 is way way cheap for this. I would pay 2k for it
---
Yea, adventure still seems to have a lot of players, just killed survival for me. Thats where i enjoyed playing
---
Well then should would have to survive that whole time
---
Wasn’t part of your spiel at the beginning complaining about how useless  your nice equipment you had gotten is now that people are playing with a new game format? Also, isn’t NW just going to last a week atm? People are probably using that time to experiment while they can, and even when it releases survival mode will probably have plenty of players.
---
So what? The whole point of legendaries ruining survival is because it makes having anything besides a min/max build pointless thus eliminating a huge portion of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L tree which just means the only perks taken are strictly to increase damage, like my Max Strength Bloodied build that hits over 1k damage because I'm garbage though lmfao Get STUFFT!
---
Keep turning in legendary items for scrip... Then gamble on a new one. I got a mutants/faster fire rate combat rifle so i switched to that for a bit. Just saving up 5.56 for when i get an amazing handmade again.
---
It’d be cool if in the Wastelanders updates Graham ends up organizing a big caravan service and settles down somewhere a little more permanent.
---
Gave up after 23 minutes of waiting
---
Apparrently someone's been reading all those propaganda flyers that the liberators carry.
---
Hahaha he got BENT!
---
That sounds fun! I’m trying to specialize in nukashine, it’s affects are very fun
---
Good luck with that buddy.  Wish you all the best!
---
Wow that is insane.
---
Same here. I'm Bloodied. I once died in my Camp while walking to my stash. Occasionally Nerd Rage will proc and I'll see I've taken 5% damage, then Healing Factor regens me. That 5% random damage can sometimes be enough to kill me
---
Ok
---
Your build is why survival mode is so unbalanced and dead.
---
I think it’s worth investing in a mic, to be honest. 
---
Group chat is awesome.
---
Assassin's doesn't even give you enough damage resistance to begin with for the current meta of broke legacy explosive energy weapons. Nothing does. And that's why Survival is inherently flawed, besides the fact that events like Queen and Arktos are impossible because of people dodging events to DM people who die and respawn right back at the event to get killed again. That's what *Survival* mode has all but become to most folks in it, Deathmatch mode. Oh, and Fallout wasn't an FPS RPG originally, either, so who made you the gatekeeper of what Fallout can and cannot be?
---
But then he won't get much practice... Just keep going at it OP, or play Adventure mode without VATS for a couple hours and really focus on movement and fast aim. Aiming feels clunky to everyone in this game
---
It says I can't remove it
---
Yea, forget its a limited time. Took me a long time though to get my gear. Just feels like a waste of time was all
---
Excavator/x-01 and all rise is still a decent crutch, but meta has progressed to one-shotting with bloodied weapons. Previous meta was hopping in place like a moderately autistic rabbit spamming TSEs while wearing a full set of assassin's sentinel armor, but that no longer guaranteed invincibility and TSEs got nerfed back down to match all the other effects
---
Party pooper
---
 Ah the subtleties of CAMP building. ;)
---
Exact same thing like me im rocking a bloodied build too
---
Tbh survival mode sucked ass and needs a lot of work. I think thats why most people are playing NW instead
---
Yea there is a bit they could fix in survival
---
My regular equipment and such is much better than PA. I am melee personally, but most people I come across are almost always using ranged weapons.
---
Thank you Bethesda! We appreciate all of your hard work!
---
Did you put in a SECOND staircase to the SAME floor??
---
Been here since the beta buddtee and got a bunch of characters with different builds actually haha! Get S t U f F e D!
---
wait you can't bring companions with you? huh?
---
I accidentally deleted my base trying to fix it and when I tried putting the blueprint in the same place it wouldn't let me, didn't mention anything floating but it wouldn't place
---
Try using the pointed roof piece. Not the one with a steeple. It may look janky, but it has worked for me.
---
Yeah I noticed that too. There are some buildings, its so dark inside that you cant see anything. Got clipped by a guy and I didnt even see him inside.
---
Frustrating as hell
---
Not really. I get killed a lot. Its not all easy for me if thats what your thinking. And thats why i like it really.
---
Weird. I have had people attack me and trigger my electrically charged as well, but it didn’t trigger PvP. I had pacifist mode on too.
---
Wonder if it’s a bug or something.
---
Two shot is very solid also. Your going to repair a lot more but possable double damage each shot is very good. Exploding is another but you need fireproof or you will kill your self haha
---
GET STUFFED!
---
Was in the top 10 just now and was instantly walked by a guy that was at least 50 meters out. Great
---
If you think what you said in your previous comment its clear that you havent played it much
---
 What is the cowboy outfit? I bought the Duster from the Atom store for my cowboy outfit. Its nice with both the Black Cowboy hat or the Cowboy Hat from the Crown Store.
---
Thank you for charging me 60 for the game then making it 20 bucks cheaper a week later!
---
When Cl88t tries to bring his legendaries into NW
---
\*You have no power here\*
---
edit: GET STUFFED!
---
What is a good rifle
---
It does need work, but i enjou the pvp way better in that mode personally
---
It's set off something great. There's still plenty of hate, but the hate for this game was always mostly just a giant circlejerk. r/fallout is now starting to like it, and all this exposure from mainstream streamers is great. I just checked out shroud's stream for about 10 mins, his whole chat was still trying to convince him the game is shit but he admitted that its fun and that people in the chat dont understand that. Bit by bit the "lmao dumpster fire" meme is dying out
---
I'm a Fallout vet, i know where they're at haha. I tried clicking on literally ALL of my quests. Main, Side, Event, Daily, and nothing works.
---
I'd still stomp your romp on survival too! GET STUFFED!!!!!!!
---
Yea il frantically look for boxes like evryone else and hope to find a gun, has no skill.
---
Oh man, I know, it’s very grindy if there’s something you want to collect in game. It’s not a waste though, especially if you had some enjoyment out of it.
---
Its really dark sometimes. Some of the fun humor is there but man these stories are crazy. Raiders becoming raiders. Epic story telling in this game!
---
Start the Nuclear Winter before I piss myself!
---
I ran into him earlier and he said the world would’ve been worse if I stayed outside when the bombs dropped that hurt more than a slap from a deathclaw
---
This is the first time I've seen the old man winter mask ingame, sad I couldn't get it but I settled for old man summer (really wanted the creepy raisin brand sun too)
---
Play adventure mode without vats for a couple hours and come back.
---
if you don't count having intelligent strategy about spawn locations as skill, then yeah! GET STUFFED!
---
Love you to Bethesda, keep on being you. I still enjoy your games even when they're in the (let's put this nicely) "early" phases. I usually just embrace the glitches as a manifestation of my character's insanity. "Is,... is that dragon flying backwards?... No, that makes no sense, I'm clearly losing it and must leave this place... To the tavern!"
---
Thanks B.  A great game goes nowhere without players, and passionate players can’t do what we love without a great game.  It takes both to create such a dynamic experience like Fallout 76...(and the many other experiences through the years).  Consumers and companies alike share the burden of making tough decisions.  Sometimes we get it right, and sometimes we get it wrong.   We all have that voice in the back of our heads, the one we’ve had since kindergarten, that’s less acknowledged as we grow older.  Personally and professionally, survival can sometimes insist that we ignore that voice.  It’s rare to see a large group of people that can still hear that voice...and even rarer to see a formidable enterprise do so.   Truth be told, that voice is not the best insofar as winning.  Yet when all else fails, nine times out of ten a kindergartener can tell you how not to lose.  On all sides, to every member of this community and every person at Bethesda, thank you for showing me that empathy, self-reflection and a little humility still exist in 2019.
---
Thanks but keep going don’t let those people get to you and keep making this game the greatest it can be.
---
Try Whitesprings. All faction vendors are there.
---
you guys did a fantastic job with nuclear winter. I meen really amazing and smooth compared to adventure. Its awesome to see how much this game has grown. a few things I'd like to see in NW such as single and duos mode. new areas maybe that aren't on the original map. and a play again option in case you wanna play again with a random team. again great job and what a great idea to sneak peak it for a week.
---
Lmfao every one reading any of your comments knows you haven't played it at all! Get STUFFED!
---
Yeah but they nerfed it a little, still good but not like the glory days
---
Get stuffed. Such a nerd. So much skill knowing where stuff spawns so you get it first. So skilled yeaaa
---
 Its worth trying a few times. The game loses track, then gets it back. 
---
 Otherwise submit a ticket.
---
It's unbalanced for everyone who wants to start out in survival. Or even lower level characters. Especially when level 300 players that have never seen the light of day are running around with their explosive two shot miniguns and what not, that they spent 3 weeks grinding for. 
---
It's not balanced in any sense and if you believe that then I guess your one of those.
---
Um yea sure
---
Im just about to start leveling a new char waan team up for inspirational
---
Id like you to try. Would be fun nerd. Thats my whole point
---
Thanks for list I wonder who would be the first to get 100
---
I'm looking forward to a group of Human Settlers/Raiders asking help to clear out a site occupied by SM/Ghoul/Scorched even opposing faction and then grants you tiered rewards.
---
The game was never anywhere near as bad as the hate train would have made you believe. Great to see that not all gamers are so toxic
---
I’m looking for high level enemies.
---
Maybe if we find someone else on here willing to let us follow them I’d for sure be down!
---
I completely agrees.
---
Why because the free trial is bringing in some newbs who may or may not enjoy the franchise, those that do used this free trial week to download and play a game that most people have said is actually terrible only to find out it's a good game with a lot to offer to franchise fans such as myself and plenty for those that aren't, I know we are all gamers with nothing better to waste our time on but games and Reddit but Bubba chill if it's that big of an issue quit playing for the week or until wastelanders it's simple
---
Ruh-roh. Good to know.
---
Yea i can understand for the lower levels its u balanced. There were alot of higher level players there for awhile it seemed like
---
Nuclear Winter has been a pleasant surprise so far, I'm waiting for fighting in the Savage Divide when this comes out of Alpha!
---
I cried for Freddy. And the whole Mistress of Mysteries story was just an utter tragedy. And this game is the first time I understood how absolutely badass the Brotherhood was/is. Even I was inspired by Maxson’s speech on the reasons to start the BoS.
---
Yes it seems to be because of all the new free trail people
---
Not really. I was going to wait for the wastelanders update but would have downloaded sooner if this mode didn't have building.
---
I want to play the base game but I feel like I'd get bored.
---
Level 29 here, here's my 2 cents on your suggestions and a few other things:
---
Ping system: I have mixed feelings on this. On the one hand, players are already marked when firing (unsure if it's only unsilenced weapons, need to test with the pump-action shotgun). And it encourages verbal coordination, which will decidedly win games over even skilled mute teams. On the other hand, some people just don't wanna talk and the marking occasionally seems random. There also is no indicator that you're marked.  So a ping for loot I can agree with, but if they can figure out their marker system I think it'll be fine.
---
Perk Cards: I have gotten more duplicate cards than new ones (including grinding all the challenges). I joke in lobby that I'm only this high of a level because I keep getting dupes, but really it's sort of true. You definitely shouldn't be able to get dupes of the starting cards. Some cards (auto rifle/pistol/shotgun % damage increase) are flat out better than others and shouldn't only cost 3. Evidence here is with a Scoped Lever Action and the Master Rifleman you can single-tap headshot most armor types. These cards should cost more or be nerfed to 25% increases. Which would make me personally sad because I love blasting a full hp power armor dude with a double barrel and watching it explode off him, but in the name of balance it should be modified so a player can only specialize in one or two weapon types. Speaking of which...
---
WEAPONRY: On PC everything honestly feels spot-on in terms of damage, but it's very much aim+perk card dependant. Minus the cards automatics and explosives are still king, but the others still hold up pretty damn well. I can see how, on a controller with zero autoaim, a scoped hunting rifle might seem like a pass. But on PC with better average accuracy the weapons feel strong and on-point. So maybe like Overwatch and other games some console-specific balancing would be necessary here.
---
SOUND: I've personally never been a fan of the ridiculously powerful sfx most BR's use. Every single gunshot and effect in PUBG made me jump, even after 300 hours because it was designed that way. I hate how overly important the sound of footsteps are for most BR's so I appreciate this one not worrying about that. In the same vein not having an exact sound effect correlation to damage done makes you pay more attention to the numbers themselves. Fallout is first and foremost an RPG even in this weird permutation. I have encountered a few glitches regarding the sound though where gunshots will continuously come from nowhere. 
---
Other than that I agree with everything else you've said :) 
---
My last thing I'd ask would be to make the Hazmat Suit come off when equipping any other armor. It's really good in ONE specific situation but otherwise (unless they have a radium rifle) you might as well have no armor at all. I've died twice thinking I had better armor on because I thought picking up another set of armor would override it. I will always remember it NOW, but a newer player might not know to check and could die the same way. 
---
My best recommendation for leveling up would be to win, as you get 575xp for first place whereas kills are significantly less (20xp per kill + 5xp for the down I think?). I know that sounds obvious, like I'm saying "just win dummy lol", but every team I've played on that vocally communicated ended up much higher in the rankings than the silent ones. Even if it's just me talking we'll get further than if nobody talks. 
---
Also, if you're the last one alive on your team DON'T GIVE UP! You can still become Overseer by some smart plays and tactical thinking. Use Stealth Boys to ambush groups and turrets in the last circles to lock down positions while you advance. 
---
As a last ditch effort you can even throw down your camp and just start spamming floors and walls to confuse people. It's not Fortnite, but if you spend a little time in Adventure Mode building up a little fort and blueprinting it you can hold off even full teams on your own. Make that battlefield your home turf.
---
I think that some people are forgetting that the Nuclear winter game mode is not the same as the Nuclear winter 'season'. This is just a sneak peak and we already know that the full 'season' will include vault raids and other PvE content. People need to chill.
---
Hadmade has the highest dps i think. Lever action is great single fire. I like the combat rifle for a back-up close quarter's. Put on the faster reciver and silencer. Rapid fire silent boy.
---
Gauss is high base damage for energy. Plasma splits it damage between energy and balistic. Good ish rifle. Laser... Need help right now. Low dps and no Anti armor make it harder to use at top lvls.
---
Gotcha. Makes sense. Just wanted to make sure it wasn't something with my connection. Thank you. :]
---
Yea thinking i might quit for a bit. Just seemed like survival was getting more players, then NW came and its just dead servers basically now
---
Nah it drops a low level 1star. Prolly just leeching hoping ppl complete the event for em smh
---
its 19.19$ last time i checked on  cdkeys fer xbox digital download.
---
We might hear more tomorrow. Every Thursday or Friday, they post an *Inside the Vault*, where current plans are laid out for future patches.
---
The cowboy outfits are from Toxic Valley, not the Mire. They're a very rare drop from dailies/events.
---
Lmfao! the guy calling somebody else a nerd on a FO 76 reddit on a post where he's complaining about a video game mode! GET STUFFED!
---
There is building yes, but buildings where you have to find the plans and only use them once sort of buildings. And only a single wall/turret at a time. Search YouTube, dont judge by Genre ❤
---
OoOooOoo! Immah Neeeeerd! lmfao GET STUFFED!
---
Called you a nerd because you think saying get stuffed is funny or insulting in some way
---
You have violated my safe space.   Have any more?
---
See exactly
---
I’velaid down in the sleeping bag in the golf club about 50 times now very slowly...while getting mauled by 20 glowing ones.
---
I'd also like to have a mister handy to sit at my bar and sell players drinks I supply it with. It'd be awesome to have other types of vendors available to your camp, rather than just having the vending machine.
---
They hate Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 too.  Bethesda will never be able to please that sub.
---
Xbox
---
Yeah, I totally agree! I think people are too focused on 'its a battle royale, ew. It's a new fortnite'
---
Typo but you should  show it to one of your friends and say you got to lvl 100
---
Just happened to me right on the cusp of victory. Feelsbadman

ahahah here let me educate you!

That was yesterday's challenge. Today it's use 6 stimpaks.
---
Just plant your own.
---
had 2 in my team in my last match, i just kept seeing their names spamming the kill feed. their animations they would run in place real fast and were shooting through terrain it looked like
---
Just don’t play that mode. It literally has no impact on your game.
---
I'm on my 3rd game haven't had too much waiting but yeh is slow still.
---
Also staying aimed when realeased aim is an issue for scoped weapons on NW for ps4
---
It really is a testament to the design of YouTube's interface.  You can tell by the comments that a lot of really, really, really stupid people are able to navigate the site/app just fine.
---
 I get a kick out of Bloodied builds. I run a very healthy, well armoured, very stealthy Combat Knife build and can take loads of damage while putting out damage that scales easily to the 300s. That one-shots the Ghouls and as both my knives do +40% Speed, so maybe 3 times a second, I get close to 1000 dps on a good night.
---
 I traded in my Bloodied Auto Grenade Launcher for scrip. I got a TS one which I'll keep. ;)
---
I say start a new character so you can get the whole story
---
Morgantown airport, Billings homestead, or nearly any 50+ level player's CAMP.
---
You don't need that much. Keep around 20, it's not very useful unless you're crafting Serums.
---
Or a legendary with a different effect, like instigating, furious, aa, executioners, faster swing speed, etc...
---
The storage closest in Morgantown Airport was brutal. Colonel was pretty hard too.
---
ANTHEM SUCKS! FALL OUT ROOOOOOLZ! 
---
Tunnel Snakes rule too

That doesn’t mean they have no gear.

Make new friends

I renamed my mods with shorter names because the other line they used to be on was too long and it had a limit, but I don't think you need to anymore with this line.
---
Go to Whitesprings and check in with all the vendor robots. One of them should have it. All the factions are represented.
---
I did.  Love it and it's well worth the money.
---
Yeah for sure. That's what I was thinking. But if we're being honest is the game worth it now? I mean I'm not interested in the battle Royale mode so is there enough content and good stories to keep me playing? Or just keep people in general playing.
---
Yeah dude, really fucked up. They basically just spent years fucking around about overall design until reality set in. If you’d like to watch up on it I can link you a vid.
---
I'm impressed by the backlash this game still gets, same thing happened with Battlefront 2.. Just a thing to keep in mind when you start games as a service, the backlash will persist.
---
I have a friend that still claims that this game is awful and he hasn't even plaid it. I bought it about a week ago and I love it!
---
I second that
---
Is everyone ignorant of the free weekend? None of these ppl are staying after lol
---
Nope. Mine runs with no issue. May be either your connection or your servers traffic.
---
I can't get mine to work, any tips on how you got yours to work?
---
Would love to play blackjack in one of the vaults opening up
---
Oh yeah, I cried about the woman in the storage closet. What an absolutely HORRIBLE way to die.
---
Colonel broke my heart too. I hope he escaped and is safe somewhere.
---
You're the type of person who does not help. Out with you.
---
I found a bug. If you remove both fusion cores from power armor then try to enter, the animation will freeze and you can't do anything to fix it, except leaving from game.
---
I knew that, just said the wrong area. I was reading about the leather coat, too, which is a reward from the Mire. I'll edit that.
---
It'll probably be a separate game mode like NW. I'd imagine they want to keep the current adventure mode available as-is for any new players. Just conjecture though, so who knows.
---
What gear would they have that i couldnt see?
---
Just want to say I started to have the exact same issue. Clicking on the card 5-6 times seems to work as well.
---
I like how the burnt books are lootable pieces of trash while the unburnt books which could actually be useful are background decoration.
---
This game actually has a good community
---
I hardly ever do
---
&gt;Colonel broke my heart too. I hope he escaped and is safe somewhere.
---
I'm sure that he at some farm up state happily playing with other people. #nospoilers
---
Nuclear Winter is lots of fun, the devs should be proud. Can’t wait for more
---
Feed the ppl event and biv are the only times i see high lvl ppl there in adventure mode.
---
Today we did that event with 6 ppl. So much thumbs up!
---
I had this problem in beta and shortly after, the following worked for me
---
1. Log out then back in
---
2. Join another players world from social tab
---
3. Restart your game
---
4. Make a new character, log into adventure, log out, swap back to first character, log in
---
EATING HIS SUGAR BOMBS AND NOT CRYING ABOUT HIS FATHER. 😭😭😭
---
You can get just about anything you want from player vendors. Food for thought.
---
Texas hold em' would be dope!!! $1000 cap buy ins , winner takes all would be awsome.
---
I'm doing the free trial so I haven't played long (level 6) but I've been disconnected three times already.
---
Scrap those steelbooks and make some ammo.
---
I’d love that. Thanks!
---
I have him right now in flatwoods gt is CycloPhile. I ll hold him for 2 minutes
---
Also, I really doubt 800 caps will get you one. In near 2000 hours I've got one leather coat but no luck with cowboy outfits. That's what I mean by rare.
---
*Didn't you hear the Security Chief? The Overseer is too fat for his Combat Armor, go get the breastplate stretcher!!!*
---
Didn't exit that time, wait was 7 minutes, but it exited me again just after getting to vault 51?
---
One last try :(
---
I downloaded the "Ping Lite" app on my phone that you suggested and ran a few ping tests. I turned my cellular data off before starting the tests and ran the test on the same Wifi network as my console.
---
Based off of what I have found online a ping of less than 30ms is good and the vast majority of the the sequences that I ran during the test were below that (usually less than 20ms).
---
The connection issues still persisted today though unfortunately but I have updated my ticket on [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) with the results of the ping tests (along with other troubleshooting measures I tried today) so that they can see it also.
---
Thanks for the suggestion though. I've been communicating with a few representatives since I posted my ticket so hopefully this info will be useful to them in some way.
---
I'll post the exert about the ping tests below to show what I am talking about.
---
# ============&gt; Results From The Ping Tests Below
---
 \#9 -- Following up a suggestion I received on Reddit, I downloaded the "Ping Lite" app onto my phone. I turned off my cellular data and connected my phone to the same Wifi network my console is on. From here I ran multiple ping tests, first on my IP Network Gateway, than on my IP network subnet, and last on my IPv4 IP address.  
---
====&gt;IPv4 Network Gateway Test Results  
---
The first test I ran on my IP network gateway was done with a delay of 2000 ms. I ran the test for 30 sequences. The results: 31 packets transmitted -- 31 packets received -- 0.0% lost. My console, computer, and phone were connected to the same wifi network but I was not running Fallout 76 during this test.  
---
The second test I ran on my IP network gateway was done with a delay of 2000 ms. I ran the test for 100 sequences. The results: 101 packets transmitted -- 98 packets received -- 3% lost. My console, computer, and phone were on and connected to the same Wifi network but I was not running fallout 76 during this test.   
---
The response time during test two ranged from 5 ms - 1274 ms, with the vast majority of responses under 20 ms. The responses that were in the thousands (3 in total) all followed a timed out response (seq. 77 timed out , seq 78 had a 1162 ms response /// seq 86 timed out, seq 87 had a 1082 ms response // seq 90 timed out, seq 91 had a 1274 ms response).   
---
The third test I ran on my IP network gateway was done with a delay of 2000 ms. I ran the test for 295 sequences. The results: 296 packets transmitted -- 285 packets received -- 3.7% lost. During this test my console, computer, and phone were connected to the same wifi network and I was running fallout 76. I was able to make 4 login attempts into fallout 76 during this window and 3 of them ended in disconnects. The one that did not end in a disconnect was due to me voluntarily leaving the server to see if I could consistently stay connected for at least one minute. I was not able to unfortunately.  
---
====&gt; IPv4 Subnet test results  
---
I only ran one test on my IP Subnet. The test was done while my console, computer, and phone were connected to the same wifi. The delay for the test was 300 ms. The chart for the test had 256 entries (0 - 255). My results: one entry had a yellow highlight (last ping failed), less than a dozen had green highlights (received reply), and the rest remained as black numbers.  
---
====&gt; IPv4 IP Address Test  
---
I ran one test while running Fallout 76. My console, computer, and phone were all connected to the same wifi network. The test was done on a delay of 2000 ms. I ran the test for 373 sequences. The results: 374 packets transmitted -- 722 received -- negative 93.0% lost.  
---
The vast majority of my responses were under 20 ms during the test.  
---
(During this test the data was truncated after sequence 298 so I could not go back and check over and take pictures as I could with the other tests. This might be why the packets received and the percent lost are why they are the values they are.)  
---
During this test I attempted to login to Fallout 76 5 times and all 5 attempts resulted in disconnects. Oddly enough the disconnects did not correspond with a lack of response from on ping test (at least 10 ping tests, both before and after the actual game disconnect, would show not error in most cases).  
---
====&gt; End of IP Tests
---
I pre-ordered two copies (one for xbox &amp; ps4) gave up after 2 months of playing and traded in my PS4 copy and stopped playing on the Xbox one along 3 other friends of mine did the same.
---
When SURVIVOR MODE dropped,a friend of another friend insisted i start a new character and only play survivor. I suddenly noticed the crashes stopped along with minor fixes and enchancements it felt like *okay, maybe they didnt abandon this game*.
---
THEN VENDORS GOT INTRODUCED!!!
---
THEN E3 ANNOUNCEMENTS!!!
---
NUCLEAR WINTER!!!!
---
HOLY SHIT WE GOT NPCS!!!!
---
thank you for fighting the good fight, truely. I was 19 when i first played Fallout 2 and havent stopped since.
---
Thanks for making a great game and taking chances with major fundamental advancements in gameplay!   It was a rough start but I’m enjoying myself thoroughly now :)
---
Yeah in the early days when F76 came out and we were fighting a boss we had problems with friendly fire, and some douchebags trying to get a few caps+loot when you're supposed to be all teaming up for the boss
---
Couple weeks back there was a challenge to take a workshop... Someone built all the turrets and it was maddness trying to sneak in to get the claim.
---
Turrets could not be killed lol
---
Glad I don't play such a tasteless genre.
---
Is that a new perk? Does it stack with Marsupial?
---
for what purpose does one need a deathclaw hide
---
Actually, I've been helping others, it's what I do and at the same time make new friends.  If your friends left, make new ones....  it's just a game my friend.
---
It's because this is kind of an echo chamber. Only the positive stuff seems to be getting upvoted.
---
Late game is basically just the nukes and high level areas. Honestly the fun I have is stuff I make up, trying to sell all my stuff I don’t want.
---
Yep OP, *everybody* else can tank more hits and deal more damage than you. Bethesda somehow programmed this into your version of Fo76.
---
You need to grow the fuck up and realize there is a much simpler answer: You suck at the game. Go back to Adventure mode and use Aimlock..err.. I mean VATS to kill some radroaches. Show them how stwong you are!
---
I think I'll start on a small, one foundation gross floaty base with my level 12 character.
---
You think it is fun now, just wait until you ARE the high level who saves the lower level.
---
Yeah except this literally happened yesterday lol
---
Damn. Any more common outfits that would be cool-looking?
---
$13.99 for Xbone!
---
Space ship thing? Is it the space station in the north of the map? Or is it the observatory you’re talking about?
---
I got excited in the waiting room of nuclear winter to find the slot machines.... only to be saddened a little that they didn’t work. But tbh I’d be happy to have them as a decorator in my camp.
---
Check out isthereanydeal.com. Amazon has it the cheapest I've seen at the moment but I don't know what the price is on international versions.

It wasn't flawless at launch, but it wasn't broken to the point of being unentertaining.  I put in dozens of hours right after launch building characters that have been gathering dust for months and exploring all the Wasteland's secrets.  It was my go-to game for at least two months before I took a short break from it.
---
No change with my file then, I'm at a loss. 
---
Have you played Nuclear Winter yet? Maybe that effects it.
---
Sounds like a fun idea. Like a really sloww moving tank.
---
Do PCs still come with optical drives? I haven't had one in probably five years.
---
It's the only game I regret buying. I can find the good in anything, but Anthem is another level of terrible.
---
Even the media coverage and support on other social media platforms is very positive.
---
That group of people is so small that their opinion/voice is almost negligible, come get me when you see more than 4 at one time
---
Leaving a comment just in case someone dugs this thread somehow and has the same problem. In my case it was antivirus+sli combo. I have to turn off malwarebytes and enable sli every time i want to play f76 (i have sli disabled for other games).
---
Try player vendors
---
This has honestly become one of my favorite games I've ever played, so I want to say thank YOU Bethesda. This game scratches an itch I didnt know I needed and it has been loads of fun ever since beta. Keep up the great work and I cant wait to see what happens to 76 next!
---
Yes I would say so. There are some pretty good stories you can find on holotapes and NPCs will be coming along. The game has improved greatly since launch.
---
You must save it to your drive then view it.
---
Ok so what’s in the winter stash crate box?? What’s in thoseee
---
Best head on back to Fortnite then.
---
The funny thing is, there were some clear giveaways in the chat that people didn't know what they were talking about. They were saying he could put on regular armor inside power armor, even though it only "stays" equipped if you enter the PA wearing it. I saw somebody tell him that using martial artist will speed up his gatling gun even though that was patched months ago. Just a sample of the demographic that's still shitting on the game
---
I mean, they were mostly rallied by the YouTube reviewers shitting on the game, repeating a lot of the same complaints that didn't stand up to scrutiny or were grossly exaggerated.
---
I think a capital wasteland dlc would be awesome shit I’d pay for it
---
I take it you haven't fine-tuned your perks? Lol
---
Dunno if it's still a thing but last I checked if two nukes are detonated at once or within a time period after one has already been detonated then it crashes the server
---
Remember when this game was meant to be an MMO and NOT designed as a co op game from the start? like it probably should've been? so the servers don't crash if two separate teams decide to detonate a damn nuke at the same time?
---
Google
---
Ill be on tomorrow 👍
---
I mean, it has potential, but why release this when the regular game crashes for no reason still?
---
Haven't had marsupial yet!
---
Anyone know if they can move? Imagine Bethesda making static npcs who just stand there
---
I got it thank you
---
For the second one check your pip boy it should tell you to level up
---
Traveling ATM, but there have been a number of comments about it on the "I'm going to buy this" style threads, GOG is $17 I think.
---
It's a potential quest reward from the dailies Big Game Hunter and Buried with honor.

I am on PC, and before anything else, thank you for offering help!! Seriously, thank you. My ign name is Ivan. At the moment I am hugging the forest as Jenterland advised. I am gonna go play for a bit.
---
Well, you can get a cowboy hat from the hatter's tea party that's up the hills west of Tyler County Fairground. To start with the drifter outfit might work. There's usually one at Eastern Regional Penitentiary if you search around a bit.
---
I cannot help with #1 because I’m on Xbox but I can say that the same command that reloads, if you hold it down, it sheathes it. 
---
2. Check your pip boy at the very bottom of the screen. May see a flashing “level up”
---
I did that, still won't allow me to access the + Mark's. I have a few sheets I have made and other people have the same things, I think it's because it set to view only.
---
Damn skippy!
---
No unless you bought something from the atom store
---
This for sure. Throw on the green thumb perk and you'll have more than you'll know what to do with. 😋
---
All the people I knew in person who were criticizing the game never even played it.
---
I've only mutated once in a match and got Chameleon. Looked it up and yeah it's a nw exclusive. Shame I don't have the agility for it though
---
I’m on XB1. I still do Adventure 90% of the time. 
---
About 100 meters south of the Overseer’s Camp. 
---
Magazines for 9 caps. 
---
Bobble heads for 49. 
---
Diluted Stimpacks 4 caps. 
---
Regular Stimpacks 9 caps. 
---
Super Stimpacks 19 caps. 
---
To be honest, I’m just trying to clear out some space since I get my 1400 vendor caps daily within about 15-20 minutes...
---
INDEED!
---
Damn, good one, thanks
---
I have the bunny mascot head could I use that?
---
I don't normally interact via mic as I'm always in a ps4 party with friends. So i usually just dump some basic supplies and give them the come here and gift emote. Stuff like stims, radaway, water and maybe some bullets. 
---
I would drop more stuff but they always run away before i can find everything i wish to drop for them. So i try and be as quick as possible and mark the basics off.
---
Thanks for making a game we all could fall in love with! It can't be easy trying something new and getting such a rough start, but that is the way it is with trying new things. You try, you fail, you learn, you get better. And such is the story of Fallout 76, it started rough, you guys kept going, we cheered you on, and you kept giving your all and we kept loving it. 
---
A big thanks to everyone who was involved in making this. Never stop doing new things, keep pushing your limits!
---
When it says  team fill on or off that basically acts as a solo or team version
---
Who ever decided your toons special in adventure should be your BR toon should be fired.
---
Honestly I leave things unlocked on the hopes people don't attack it!
---
Get it and launching a nuke at 200 instead you could launch one 70 up and plus if you do it alone there is less robots and you just need a nuke key card and instead of  getting all nuke cards on the people just go to a web site called nukacrypt  they already have them decrypted. ( on short terms if you go alone there is less robots and just need a nuke key card and get the nuke codes for the silo your in from the website call nukacrypt.) Or you could do the decrypting you self and launch a nuke at 200. Have fun if you do get it.
---
Thank you BGS Team you keep listening to us ..
---
There’s a Vault Jumpsuit version that is outerwear, not underwear.
---
Shit omw
---
Thanks! I'm trying to emulate the bounty hunter duster from New Vegas. That'll be a good start.
---
It comes in handy when you spawn in an area with 2 other squads and you're basically a ticking time bomb. I barreled face first in a shack with a knife, and the grenade killed one and downed the other.
---
It's also how I got my first win. Brings me back to the old Call of Duty martyrdom days.
---
I mean he said shill so
---
Mine doesn't crash at all. No framerate issues. Two consoles and a PC.
---
No reason not to have it unless you use lots of chems
---
aaah ok
---
Dude...I feel the exact same way. The way everything felt during the BETA where it was all brand new. A brand new world.
---
No worries, happy hunting :)
---
[No, it's not the spacestation it's this thing](https://imgur.com/a/acvAlNy)
---
Looks like the top of some kind of structure.
---
I was just curious.
---
Only once daily for me.
---
Lots of words yet nothing said lol
---
I gave up on it after 10 rounds....its basically pub G ....with all the toxic problems to come with those types of players.
---
I have healing factor on my bloody build. I don't have any issues with it at all.
---
Are you serious?  If you're not aware of the state of the gaming industry, maybe **don't preorder or even buy games the day they release.**  And if you can contain the urge to be a humongous manchild and demand a refund for a product you willingly paid for with no prior post-release reviews, maybe you can decide to buy the game when it comes out because you are familiar with the company and trust their practices.  Otherwise, at least **try** to be a shrewd consumer.  Forgoes instant gratification if you're that goddamn sensitive about incomplete content.
---
Fuckin' litigious baby.
---
i haven't seen anyone launch a nuke at the newbies yet. I might change that tonight.
---
Yes still produces legendaries . Seems to be more 3 star then before . But the loot sucks
---
Kicked me out again when at vault 51 - wtf
---
Looks like ill wait till proper release
---
LORE BE DAMNED!!!!
---
but I want it
---
Vats also seems to just drop sometimes even when focused on the same target.
---
Have you owned 5 workshops at a time? Because on Xbox, it WILL crash
---
Jeebus H Crust... did they recently increase the adjustment range on body type?! I seriously don't remember the triangle offering a "crack head" level of thinness all those months back... lol
---
Good pics though! My type of filthy humor :)
---
*^(\[my only suggestion would be to remove the 'White Powder' one, as folk tend to be pretty understanding... until you start busting out racial humor... just my opinion!\])*
---
You can scroll through the options if you find none well that answers your question
---
That’s where the nukes come out of I believe
---
I saved a copy from the link to a different account and I was able to expand and collapse the exams with a different account
---
You mad?
---
It should be on one of the carts on roller coaster in the amusement park near the nukacola factory (South West on map). I think...
---
Lol my camp got nuked last night. I'm only level 20 but have played since beta lol.
---
Now you're thinking with child labor.
---
Same here. Barley have crashes and I've held at least 5 workshops at once with my team. On PS4 and not had anywhere near the issues OP is describing. Must be something he's doing.
---
Come Wastelanders I expect people will have nothing to shit on other than 'insert NPC here is buggy as hell!' Battle Royale was a given to be shat on by randoms but I think future updates are gonna be PvE focused.
---
i fr would play this more if my pc didnt run it at 40 fps lol
---
This is by far the worst part. How am I supposed to feed my LMG if no one is going to sell me cheap .308s? At least I have plenty 5mm for my gatling gun
---
TighteyWhiteyMan man on xbox1. Add me as a friend, come use my camp. I’ve got crops, water, and a decontamination shower that can heal your rads and I’ll craft you some weapons and gear.
---
so you can preview them before you decide to buy ?
---
I think so you have to favorite it in the atom shop
---
Same old story.......  promises, promises....
---
No no Bethesda thank you for making this game so much fun not just for the current players but for the new ones as well this free trial week you put up is definitely pretty awesome I love seeing flatwoods populated with new players exploring I managed to help out a few with some stimpacks and some water and gave them a few caps to start their adventures, keep up the great work bethesda! ❤️
---
I'm on ps4, but for me the default is same button you press to reload. Quick press for reload, long press to sheath weapon. So not sure if same applies on PC or if completely different keys for both actions.
---
From the atom shop? Yes you can
---
Ah got you. Thanks
---
Thanks, I'll test it out right now.
---
Charisma not that good, lone wanderer is amazing.  I have 9 but I'd say 5 is ideal.  Int is also bad no higher than 6.  Str per agi luck have the best
---
what system? if psn add me. psn: bazookagooch
---
I assume you mean you're level 1 in adventure mode. You need to find an armor crafting bench, it's where you'll craft outfits.
---
[Here’s the video that I watched. ](https://youtu.be/_DCi0H7J-aU)  I’m sure there’s plenty more out there besides this one too.
---
On PC press and hold R to sheathe weapon. 
---
Use tab to access pip-boy. Press T to level up. Between Level ups you can press T to view/change perk cards that you have equipped.
---
None of them is selling mods
---
Thanks man, playing this game new and alone is nearly impossible! Lol I appreciate it
---
yes. and thanks you :)
---
Yes, but you can only join when you move your mods out of the Data folder of the game. I have also moved the mods back for adventure mode and they work fine.
---
Yeah I wasn't sure about that one. I was hoping nobody would get upset about it. Of course nobody said it outright , but it's there and I wasn't sure how people would feel about it.
---
Sounds to me like a corrupted file, need to delete game file and saves on PS4 then redownload. Your character(s) and progression/items will stay as that is stored on the servers. You will lose photos and options settings though. I made a write up on this back with patch 4 or 5. I can link if you want.
---
This. It's the missile silo
---
Not yet
---
Thanks lol
---
OK
---
Thanks. :)
---
I clicked the link above for the spreadsheet. Then click the 3 dots. Selected open in browser. Selected the email account I wanted to open it with then selected the 3 dots at the top again. And then clicked share &amp; export. Then selected make a copy. All with a different account than the creator account and hand no problem at all expanding and collapsing the exams.
---
Level 40.
---
Honestly I replayed the part of them announcing npc/rpg elements I was so surprised
---
Not sure u know but u can switch between 2 guns easy. Not sure what u play on but on ps4 u push left on numpad and it switch between last 2 equipped guns
---
thank you for encouraging me to come back, i haven't played since Valentine's day
---
There already exists a coffee recipe
---
Yeah, the sub made it out to be that a battle royale will be the final nail in the coffin and it will make everybody leave. I find it sweetly ironic that it's a battle royale mode that turned it around for 76
---
Come on by. I’m off tomorrow so I’ll be playing all day. Play my tuba so I know it’s you, and set up camp next to mine and I can build you a few generators and crops to keep you going until you find plans.
---
Also that angle makes her body look even worse than it really is lol.
---
Billings Homestead with the green thumb perk. You can come out of it with 150+ corn if you have the perk equipped
---
voice chat is not viable for all players...
---
Crickets
---
On the fly building is possible but it's not like in Fortnite where you can churn out a massive fortified base in seconds, building also reveals your position and exposes you, and people like to snipe from bushes.
---
Dad?
---
I get a lot of workshops at a time on xbox and never any crashes.. may have 1 or 2 a week tops
---
Hey man are you on by any chance if you are try sending me an invite to kronokingk or your GT
---
I know but I only have like a thousand caps
---
In the words of the great Bill S. Preston, Esquire and Ted Theodore Logan, Be excellent to each other.
---
Your comment made me realize that I don't have a chance in hell figuring out who is actually sincere in this entire post.
---
Thenthapple was pretty good but he stopped making videos a while back. Still a decent backlog if you want stuff for the older games. I also really enjoyed the Mindfog: A Fallout 4 Diary podcast. Episodes of that are also few and far between these days but I thought it was really well done.
---
I work nights a stackin shelves and your pics made me chuckle keep em comin lol
---
Now read the title again. I'm aware of that feature. When using it instead of putting you to a different queue with everyone being solo you're put to the same queue as teams are.
---
I wish there was more or less continuity.
---
Like my melee guy keeps getting commando and rifleman cards, and my high luck vats crit one is getting melee cards.
---
Make them matter or not.
---
The game mode will be gone after the 17th, but this is just a beta-type trial.
---
It will apparently return whenever the full "Nuclear winter" dlc drops, we don't know when though.
---
They may release an updated roadmap tomorrow with the inside the vault article
---
There's no real basis for that, given every non dead member is across the continent in California
---
Not strange at all. If you consider the general public's opinion of FO76 was 'nope' and then after a year of development they tried the BR and thought it was at least better than 'nope' then obviously the opinion would be better. Kind of like the difference between eating a turd and eating a turd with hot sauce. One is obviously better.. buuuuut...
---
I wouldn't say there is hope. While I enjoy the BR a bit it's got plenty of flaws and even as someone who played FO3/4 on launch I have no desire to play a singleplayer RPG with enforced multiplayer and I'd wager the majority of fallout fans don't want to either.
---
1.) is the bath robe considered “sleep wear”?
---
2.) either way, where do i get the bathrobe?
---
Man, the community is great. I met a lvl 120 something girl just out of the vault, she gave me some non-perishable food, said to holler if i ever need any help and that i was going to love it in WV. I didnt even know how to use the emotes, so i just jumped arround and shot straight up, but she got the message :)
---
LOLOL exactly
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Farm and do the grind my Goodman!  It's tedious but worth the troubles and you'll reap the rewards!!!!  I promise...
---
Chaotic evil right here
---
That worked! I was just saving to drive directly. Thank you for the explanation the step by step helped a ton!
---
dropped modded up 10mm pistols, ammo, chems and water on 2 level 5 players in flatwoods tonight. i always keep some low level weapons on me for when i run into low players
---
Update it and change your fallout76custom.ini file... all addons should be in the archive section as misc is no longer used.
---
Sell some low-level stuff. Lots of new players in the game now.
---
Well since you put it that way...
---
***yes***
---
Go to the amusement park near the nukacola factory There is a vendor there and it's loaded from the last time I was there (about month ago) my brother and I went there and it had full mods / plans for excavator power armor so it's loaded crap so you might find it there. I Think..
---
No problem. I hope you find a great tattoo
---
Uh... that was possibly me. I did this earlier at the farm up north to a squad. Stealth boy + 50 cal. Sorry, I didn't mean to shittify your experience :[
---
Stealth Boys are in a very weird place right now, I've seen people have the triangle marker over their heads just moments after using them, but sometimes that marker doesn't appear at all. 
---
Although I agree they're OP, they are pretty rare. Maybe shorten their invis time to 20 seconds or so.
---
I'm lvl 30
---
Does there really? Where can i find this?
---
I avoided 76 at release, just started playing a few weeks ago. I've mostly enjoyed my time with the game.
---
I have to say, though, that Todd Howard's smug "I read on the internet our games are buggy" attitude really irked me, even more so now that he says things like "we got well-deserved criticism at launch." 
---
I hope (against hope to some extent) that the lesson Bethesda has learned is that games should be complete and stable from a technical standpoint *at release.* I fear that what you will have learned instead is that people will buy anything, and you can just fix it later. Please take the former lesson away from this experience, not the latter.
---
He with the biggest poop sock and piss jugs
---
Copyright lawyers would have a field day.
---
One extra NPC following someone won't kill frame rate, have you seen how many scorched are in a group? More than 2.
---
I found of you put a post then it let's you place it, same thing happend to me
---
Please Bethesda...
---
Keep wishing
---
Thank you for not giving up on your team's dreams! I'm enjoying the battle royal
---
I was stuck with very low health for a whauel due to radiaton but I found a level 139 and asked for one radawayn, The saint dropped 20!
---
Who doesn't bro
---
Been killed a few times because of this. Didn’t mind it and it makes sense. My own fault. Have since removed it
---
GG...,........ Just gg
---
Oh for sure.
---
Yeah I know it's basically impossible, just fun to think about.
---
People are still going to complain about how "the game should have been like that at launch."
---
Yep, still there I got it on an alt yesterday.
---
Humm I play on PC... I’ll have to try , but to be fair I’ve seen you console guys be able to lower foundations perfectly in build mode and I still haven’t found that button combo on pc lol
---
So this means we can see NPC in brotherhood of steel &amp; enclave..etc factions not just Settlers &amp; Raider ?!
---
I figure we’ll probably see a resolution to her story in Wastelanders. It would be a wasted opportunity to add NPCs without adding in such a significant character.
---
Hate to say it but I'm thinking it will just more bugs......
---
Game stability always has and probably always will be an issue, but it's not anywhere near that bad. I've already gotten to overseer rank 18 and never crashed or disconnected from a match, had some rubberbanding during two of them though. The complaints about the actual game mode hold no water though - it's fallout 76 with a battle royale mode attached, not pubg or fortnite reskinned. The camp system is there and should stay there, the clunky combat and desolate wasteland are there and should stay there. That's exactly why people like it, because it takes the game we like and adds on this mode. Fallout players don't like twitchy FPS mechanics or a giant map with 20 minutes of running before you find somebody. I saw somebody here give a perfect description for it earlier, it's BR for people who don't like BR
---
This just made my night.  I hope you’re wielding a walking cane while doing this!
---
Noticed that too. My usual farm spots are full- less jumping easy.
---
I think Battle Royale had the impact of 'oh, Todd really did that? what an awful game' to those who skim the news but it sort of overshadowed the NPC thing, I think when the headlines read 'NPCs are back in Fallout 76' and they likely will drop a free week around then, people will come running.
---
You have survival where you can have your full assassin set. Been a FO76 player since the beginning and ain’t leaving any time soon.
---
Wait till you see the prototype skin for the ultracite armor
---
I imagine there will be solo, duo, squad eventually. This is a sneak peak. Keep recommending and upvoting it on here and they'll see it. But I'm with ya.  I would prefer a duo. My friend and I always play together but dont have any more. Duo would be sweet. 
---
But they'll have to consider population before putting in more modes. If people have to wait 5 minutes to fill a lobby there will be fire and pitchforks
---
Already gave all my low level stuff to the new peeps after running them through a whitesprings loot run, lol.
---
Another song to get stale after it plays three times in thirty minutes on the radio?
---
We need way more than one song added, man!
---
Thanks! The neon letters need electricity so I guess you need to run a power conduit on to it somewhere? Also, lights cost a fair amount of camp budget. I trying to decide if it’s worth the 500 atoms. I want to post a favorite saying of mine “All who wander are not lost.” I guess I can just put it up on an outside wall.
---
Around the time when the emote first dropped I was trying to figure out how to use it. I checked on the map to make sure no one was nearby and then did it. Out of no where I heard muffled headset noises and someone just appeared out of the dark mist waiting for that gift.
---
It was probably one of the most terrifying experiences I've had as I don't really interact with other players and have a very high perception stat.
---
My only suggestion is that we get to use our guns of choice. Every single time the cause of my death was a POS lousy weapon.
---
Psst... Hey.... Hey kid.... [*Looks around for police Protectrons*] ....wanna buy some ultracite?
---
Complete events of switch to melee for a bit
---
Wym by not seeing legendary effects?
---
Lol. Try a controller then. Jk i know thats a sin on pc lol
---
Idk how true it is but Ive seen whispers of a new T.O.W.N. type system coming too, maybe our C.A.M.P.S. uprgade to the towns or settlements and thats when companion NPCs can join you
---
Me2
---
4 so you can do two groups of 4
---
Controller..... monkaS 😏
---
Silva Homestead, left side of the map in the Forest Region (project beanstalk event is there). If you go there with Green Thumb you'll come out with 100+ corns.
---
Where's the X-02 Power Armour mentioned on the terminals?
---
So you never have any crashes, except one or two crashes a week. And that's acceptable.
---
Good day to you
---
Thanks man! I’ll delete the post now
---
That's just simply not true. If i have a Perception of 3 in adventure mode i can go into nuclear winter and equip the rank 3 perception card "master commando" that boosts automatic rifle weapon damage by 40 percent. If i have a Perception of 2 or lower I can not equip said perk card. So yes adventure mode does give you an advantage in NW, quite a significant one. It's also completely random when or if i'll get that card making it RNG which is never great in a battle royale.
---
Think they meant the canned coffee.

---
But that’s kinda the luck of Battle Royale .... sometimes u find good stuff and sometimes you get a cross bow and die lol
---
You should try reading them. That helps usually.
---
Like I tell people who say that fallout 76 should've had this stuff from the beginning: Sure, but it's better late than Anthem.
---
I suggest if you are just starting off, find the tadpole camp early as there are lots of things to earn,  tasks that you will naturally do as you play through the game that will unlock things and make it less of a grind of you wait to start them later.
---
Yeah this makes sense. The advice id been given was to deposit all junk and carry minimal aid. I thought this guy must be stupid for someone that high level.
---
I mean in his angry reviews, it's part of his personality so it's expected to be over the top and exaggerated. If you watch some of his other videos where he's calm and more level about it because it's not an angry review, his points come across as much more valid. If anything, the problem is both ways. I think the community takes his over the topness too seriously at times. 
---
And to be fair, even in his angry reviews, I'm not sure if I've seen video where he literally says a game is all cons or only lists cons.
---
Damn. Time to grind
---
Id say that there has been a plethora of things added and more things you can do than at launch or just grinding queen
---
Yes plz!!!! Just think 2 headed fish
---
Same. Those beanie-wearing Scorched seemed so OP at the time... I've kinda avoided it ever since. L135 now...
---
Thank you so much!  It was jarring to see myself without glasses!
---
I'll try to find some more signs I can do it with. I'm glad I could make your night a little easier for a moment.
---
My complaints about crashing have nothing to do with BR. My complaint is that they added BR while their game still crashes in adventure. This is a 60 dollar game. Instead of fixing the crashes they're adding new game modes. It's bullshit.
---
Thank you for such inspiring words it means a lot
---
Whats monkas? I searched google for controls for ps4/pc but it never showed numpad controller lay out so i couldnt help ya. Sorry
---
Psychotats and ballistic bock is good stacking damage. You can use the stinging mag with that gun and get more ammo. Not sure the perf mag + tank killer would be overkill but you can see the damage now, so play around with it.
---
GIVE ME A FANNY PACK OR GIVE ME DEATH
---
Which retailers? I already own it but would like to pick it up for my brother so we can play together.
---
Happened to me once as well. Really motivated me to hop into that event any time I see it.
---
😂😂
---
I picked it up from Walmart. I’m pretty sure Amazon has it as well.
---
Could you link me to your stream, I wanna watch it.
---
Huh, seems like pretty much everything from the atom shop datamine is in here aside from the Ritual Gas Mask and Raider Cage helm. I guess those are just available for purchase instead of unlocking?
---
I would think it might be the reward after you reach 101
---
Oh my god. I actually had to do a double take
---
What platform are you on? Also, if you visit any of the train stations there’s usually a suitcase leaning against one of the benches inside. People regularly leave extra stuff like ammo, etc inside those suitcases. As well as the first aid box that sits on the low stone wall right in front of the Flatwoods church, and the 2 corpses you can find soon after leaving the vault. 
---
But I def recommend having a melee for back up, so you’ve got a weapon if you run out of ammo.
---
&gt;Better late than Anthem.
---
I will remember that phrase, it needs to be a thing.
---
Is there a 101
---
*Fisto would like to know your location*
---
Gonna stream in a few, will link soon!
---
I’m on PS4, and thanks for the tip!
---
Considering I've only played about 10 games no.
---
Just pick a sweet username that fits for anything. That’s how I’ve been doing it for years.
---
I don’t care much about nuclear winter, but 76 was the first fallout in the last 15 years I preordered or even played in the first 6 months of launch. There’s things that aren’t great, but I’ve had a fun six months so far.
---
Nope. Just more comfortable. So at least you aren't missing anything haha
---
what's the canned coffee? is that something different from the coffee tins that you see lying around that you can scrap for parts or...?
---
I can't speak for all of us (survival mode is a thing after all), but helping the herds of new players following NW has been quite fun. Glad to hear you had a good first steps!
---
Well it’s weird that I find tons of pipe guns and revolvers. Do they have much higher spawn chance than other weapons?
---
Maybe he rolled in something nasty?
---
Sadly I've done this and it still won't work :(
---
It sounds like the problem might be with your firewall settings, not allowing the game to connect properly.
---
Dang, im on Xbox, otherwise I’d give you some. I’m a melee build so I’ve always got a bunch of ammo that I regularly just leave places for others to grab
---
oh my that endurance is unfortunate..
---
I’m level 13, and have a good amount of wins under my belt. I’d gladly join 
---
Edit: My PSN is Opalusprime
---
I'm not sure them, may need to fresh install of 76 them put the mod in.
---
And yeah I remove the files to play NW :)
---
I would buy Atoms for a black &amp; red Nuka Cola messenger bag backpack skin.
---
art
---
You've never found canned coffee? Yeah it's an actual aid/food item. I think there's one in the bathroom at R&amp;G Station.
---
Inferno Mk 1, 2 &amp; 3 PA skins are rewards through lvls 80s and 90s and the Hellfire PA skin is the final reward at lvl 100.
---
Just checked amazon, $17. Thanks!
---
Hahaha as a newbie i thought it was someone sniping me from the woods or a far building 😆😆😆👈
---
Sell them, you can get a cap a piece for them.
---
Quarian Ark?
---
Thats what im asking, what are they.. all i can think of is the backpack quest, i dont want to play NW as it is not my thing, so thats it?
---
No worries mate!
---
Omg. Dude. I miss it so so so much. That anticipation. Watching the vault open.  Looking out on a broken world. Then finding the radio station. Then running down the street singing songs with friends. Thinking holy crap I'm in a huge new Fallout world with my friends. And the same song is on the radio for everyone!  Definitely my favorite moment in video game history was day 1 beta for this game. Felt so goooood.  I even took 3 days off work when it full released to play it non stop. 
---
I still have the version of Countey Roads from game trailer on my playlist. I hear the sirens then the song starts. Gives me chills and great memories.
---
There were several ships (Arks) that launched for Andromeda, the Quarian Ark went missing and you don’t find it in the main game
---
Why, citizen... That's awfully seditious!
---
Just downloaded it today. Hooked already.
---
Thank you for striving to always improve the game and actually listening to our feedback.
---
It is pretty amazing. I may not sleep tonight just so I can get it. Damn this whole having responsibilities during the week thing I’ve got going on.
---
10$ on gamefly
---
So nothing I care about, great! Definitely won't be playing then.
---
At least they give you up for duplicates in this mode instead of forcing us to keep them like in Adventure
---
Bless their hearts...
---
Ah. I only remember exploring the first planet you go to. Never really went anywhere else.
---
i have played games with rough starts that eventually became good and i know he difficulty of getting a fan base back after allot of them we disappointed and i do have to say what you doing looks good and i wish you luck, but ik you were trying something new and interesting with fallout 76 an open world game with no NPC from a triple A company unheard of but maybe next time baby steps? Don't just radically change everything maybe an fallout game with a good story npc that you can play with friends with an arena for pvp? i would hate for the reaction 76 got to happen to elder scrolls i'm not saying your a bad company or 76 is a bad game its got its flaws and your fixing them just try not to disappoint most of the fans of a game series again ?
---
This happened to me a few times now and idk why it's not being talked about... but from my experience it seems to happen after a revive. Like if you're firing while you get downed, when you get back up and reload the gun will just start firing with no way to stop it
---
Yeah, it would be awesome with a 52 player free-for-all with everyone going at it by themselves. The chaos would be exquisite!
---
Not gonna lie, the launch was pretty disappointing. BUT you guys have done an awesome job at supporting the game and now it's a blast to play. I look forward to the wastelanders update and whatever else you guys have up your sleeve. :) so thank you  
---
[u/BethesdaGameStudios\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/BethesdaGameStudios_/)
---
Yep, that is a nice little boost. I neglected Adventure for 2 days, went back to it today and leveled up 3 times.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
It was absolutely a dumpster fire in the beginning, and that's coming from someone who desperately wanted to like it.
---
I’ve gotten 5 duplicates and I would have preferred a redraw over a tiny bit of experience
---
Yeah.  I remember back in the day when I played WoW I would kill a lot of time fishing when I was bored.
---
That and I was a hunter with a feline pet, back when you had to keep your pet fed.  I was happy, the pet was happy, it was good times.
---
Fishing for stat buff foods would give me something else to do.  Perhaps we could even use salt to preserve the fish so it doesn't decay?
---
I frequently run the “Leader of the Pack” event that starts at the Tyler County Fairgrounds. You’re guaranteed 3 (1* low level) legendaries, as long as some doesn’t kill the 3 pack leaders before you do. Bc each one drops a legendary. And it’s really quick and easy to complete. And of course the normal Uranium Fever event and nuked Whitesprings. And supposedly each horde event should get you at least one legendary of some sort, but those can be tedious and I feel like the last time I completed one I didn’t actually get one.
---
I like it in theory, but hate it in action. Besides not being an even playing field, there are the poor suckers like me who are working to fix their build, but aren’t quite there yet.
---
Either your xbox is badly broken or you are trolling, because these problems are not shared with the rest of the players. Fix your machine. Game runs fine here.
---
Salt of the Earth. Double Barrel shotgun.
---
That's all I know.
---
No, i've never found canned coffee. in fact this is the first i'm hearing of it. but now i want to hoard a shitload of it so i can flex on some people.
---
Thanks for the post!
---
time to hold on to that nuka grenade!
---
No, thank you BGS for giving us the beat games I have ever played. The only thing I have ever faulted you for is making your games so good that I will rarely touch another studio's game.
---
The map and environmental story telling in fo76 is criminally underrated and I'm very excited to see where the rest of the roadmap takes us.
---
Soooo how does one get a backpack? I’ve only just came back to the game after many months away.
---
You find it by using the “Search” with the Can Do perk equiped
---
“Find extra canned goods in food containers”
---
Assume it can be elsewhere, but I’ve never seen it outside of discovery
---
Gives a shit load of AP on use
---
I just started to get back into 76 but I’ve had so much faith and hope for it but had no one to play it with but now my friends actually are playing it so it’s really been fun and I always disagreed with the criticism on 76.
---
I love that you flat out say "someone **will** get you a welcome package", as if you speak for everyone in the Fallout 76 community....
---
***YET, IT'S ABSOLUTELY GODDAMN TRUE!!*** :D
---
Give us your platform and username, and we'll be lining up to help out! lol 
---
However, even if you don't feel like "exposing" yourself in that way (which I can understand), my advice is to keep a watchful eye on the Suitcases at the Train Stations. Particularly the ones closest to either the Vendor Bot or the Workbench. It's a *bit* rarer these days, with Player Vending Machines now being in game, but I still dump off TONS of junk and ammo, the occasional plans too, into them. 
---
Specifically, I go to the church in Flatwoods and dump it all off into the Overseers chest right next to the door, since it's kinda guaranteed the new players will look there considering it's the second stop on the Overseer's quest. 
---
So /u/NotEzrasWife, if you're on PC, I am as well, and you can count on me to leave free junk --which as you probably know, but I'll clarify just in case: "junk" is the scrap items used for building/crafting, so is a necessity to survive-- in those aforementioned locations. If I have a legendary item, these days I'll track down the appropriate leveled player to give them it directly, as I still worry a free legendary may be tempting for someone else to now turn in for "Scrip" (you'll figure out what that's for soon enough, but nothing to worry about at this juncture!)
---
Diseases don't care what they grow on or get transmitted to. Hospital chairs, walls, and air is diseased, you know.
---
Yeah man. I keep saying the game shouldn’t have been canon from the get go. I just hope they don’t try to jam retcons down our throats and just come out and say. 
---
“Hey it’s a multiplayer game and you want cool shit so here is what’s canon and the shit that is lore breaking is just there to be cool.”
---
one of the cutscenes looked sort of like a BOS bunker underground. glowing ultracite in the back ground maybe, had a green light,a new powerarmor etc. the power armor in the cutscene made me think of original fallout BOS power armor. kinda rounded and utilitarion.
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted. Are people actually happy to get a "game in progress" for full price? Is that what the gaming community has become? It isn't just Bethesda, too many game studios do this.
---
Yeah link it
---
Only thing I disagree with in the post we also need a better indicator the person we knocked has been knocked
---
Okay, if you approached me wearing that get-up id not hesitate to unload all 39 of my pipe pistol rounds into your ass and run like hell.
---
I have used a .50 cal past few times.  It works. Not sure if its true but somone on here said explosive didnt seem to hurt her. Think thats wrong
---
Talk to the scout leader and the Pioneer camp and then grind those badges. 😂
---
It’s two shot and faster reloading
---
It would be nice to actually pick your perk cards when you level instead of just getting a random one. How is aquaboy helping me in any way during a fight?
---

---
Legendary ranks be released
---
Heavy Barrel and Long Barrel are both scrap mods, so plans for them don't exist. Chance should be 25% per scrap, so you shouldn't need to find (or craft) many of them.
---
Really? I always have more lockpicks than I could ever possibly use. They are everywhere.
---
And I just did it on a whim, too. I rarely do events. I saw a level 5 on the map, and said “he might need some help.” ... karma? :)
---
Fo76 is the new animal crossing. Now if only I could be indebted to irradiated racoons...
---
🤮 part of playing Fallout 76 is playing with the glitches. Deal with it or go back under your rock.
---
What system are you on? I'm on ps4. I can give you the key or at the very least unlock the door for you
---
Ahhh how I yearn for those days. 400lb stash limit. 12 caps to my name. Aluminum was worth more than gold. Wouldn’t trade that for anything.
---
??????? What?
---
It can be done! It’s a great feeling but it’s still more fun as a group. The more people show up the more damage resistant she becomes.
---
The camp definitely isn’t used as much as it should be. Also, people are reluctant to attack the camps it seems.
---
I won’t ever pre order a game or buy anything on release by Bethesda. Ever again. You guys knew it was bad and sold it anyway. Certainly would have been better if it were released now instead of when it was. I’d still be playing it. Item dupe bugs. Gun damage bugs. Streaming watchers is less than games 10 years old. 
---
Very few other professions in the modern world would even consider selling something this bad. Cars? Boats? Food? I swear the only place that you can do this bad and it be of no consequence in modern America is in the video game market and public schools.
---
I thought they would get bored of it after a few days but nope.
---
Good point, my first round ever we spawned all over the place. I found my closest teammate and just followed him (not really knowing what I was doing), and by carefully hiding and pacing ourselves we were the second team standing. Now that I think about it, I haven’t done near as well since then.
---
Please you guys spread the word! Not just upvote
---
The game still sucks, the problem is your shit taste.
---
that was the first thing I checked, wish it was that simple but it seems not to be.
---
Agreed best way is to upvote and comment, ideally everyone should find a single thread to bandwagon on.  The style of NW queues, as well as other regions for maps I think are two very good ideas for the mode.
---
Would also throw in no duplicate perk cards and account based rewards for leveling up and I think we’ve got a rock solid mode.
---
It just depends If you mind using levels to respec or not. Once you get past 50 you can turn your build into whatever you want
---
The combat was quite good, the characters, plot and aliens were less than mediocre.
---
That’s what he gets for partying too much with Biv.
---
This is why I stood there defending Bethesda even when times were really rough. This game is amazing and so are they. I didn't think I'd like a mmo style fallout but I really do. It keeps it fresh. I look forward to playing this each day now. Thank you for such a great experience.
---
Dude. It’s middle of the day Thursday. Most people will be at work or school in this country. I was playing yesterday arvo around 3/4:30 and got games really quick.
---
Too late. I already did.
---
Graphics does not a good game make.
---
What system are you playing on?
---
Xbox here, there are minor stuttering issues when there's a lot happening on screen. Some occasional enemies in walls, floors, but nothing that breaks the game. Game is definitely better than launch, there has been a steady increase in stability and issues being solved for the xbox.
---
I may repost to get Bethesda’s attention
---
Thanks for downvoting, really welcoming!
---
Let me buy the moonshine mama mask or I send it back
---
Forever yours, Porky
---
Just say no to spray and pray. Keep all your weapons semi auto and pick your shots better. 
---
(Also I don't use vats, I personally think I have better accuracy that way but then again I would because I have no vats perks)
---
No. Removes a lot of skill toward the end of the match, and extremely annoying when it is 1v3 but the beast chases you.
---
Sell it for 1 cap to vendors lol
---
It's because damage resistance doesn't actually do very much. For example, a piece with much better resistances might increase your DR &amp; ER from 200 to 220, which is equivalent to a damage reduction of 3.5%. That's pretty weak compared to the better legendary effects.
---
I’d love a separate stash just for my wardrobe.
---
turn on pacifist mode in the game settings menu and no one can hurt you unless you take over a workshop.
---
Does voice chat not work or something?
---
I watched a few streams for a bit. Seems like classic fallout gunplay jankiness which is fine. The loot and everything actually surprised me, it looks fun.
---
The game is just too damn big and I refuse to delete the games needed to fit it. I need a bigger external hd
---
thanks! Turns out it is possible also from the main Atom store
---
He was probably trying to rid some space. Dog food and coffee aren’t light if you don’t have the weight reductions. I usually will give new players or someone’s mules some food, water, stems and radaway since I’m always over 200 on the last two.
---
Adapt to the market
---
I’ve play in Adventure mode for a few hours just setting up some small blueprints to use in nuclear adventure. Of course I kept having to hunt for wood because I was already low to start.
---
Thanks homie lmao didnt know that was a thing also any chance you play on xbox I cant remember how to get to the menu other than going to challenges first
---
Thank you for actually sticking to making the game better than what it a year ago it came a long way
---
Memory.  The game eats it like Chrome smokin’ weed.  
---
You’ll also see performance hits when large groups of players are in one area farming.  Instanced loot everywhere drags performance down.  
---
I usually hop to another server.
---
*A book isn’t enough BioWare*!
---
Gib more Enclave stuffs!
---
:( same
---
A firework launcher would be pretty sweet.  They have the "push button for explosive" thing with the Hero of the Wasteland statue.
---
No.
---
I’m soo jealous. I can’t seem to tame a single thing. I’m not sure if I’m doing something wrong or what’s happening.
---
Thanks haha
---
Thank you as well! You all have put a lot of hard work into the game and it shows! Keep up the great work! I totally love making items for all the new players, ita shows them that we are a great community that cares about the game and the player base! Great game and great players!!
---
No Voice chat works fine, but not everyone has a mic and that isn't going to change any time soon, so those people can't tell us a thing when they see someone, or if they have a nuke code, etc. Another thing, is that server wide chat would be great for getting groups together to do things in the base game.
---
Hold square for #1 c:
---
That's the dumbest argument I have ever seen in my whole life. If you want to argue that the function should be added for functionality that's one thing but to say we need a whole new communication system put in place for the 50 mute people playing game is ridiculous. It just isnt economically smart.
---
Anything bloodied with decent DPM. Heavy weapons are ideal. Put Emergency Protocols on your PA torso and throw on some Blocker if you want to avoid dying to mobs in the tougher queen fights.
---
If you're using One Gun Army or similar stagger perks, don't sustain fire on the queen in the air because it tends to stun lock. Fire short bursts and wait to see if it lands.
---
so its still the same thing.. but now it doesnt matter if its low level or not because of the vending machine and the purveyor... i see...
---
#WESTERN SPY
---
Helpful reminder to put what platform you are on.  :)
---
Boris will find you
---
I work at Bethesda. I’ll make sure our media team sees this.
---
This isn't where you send requests to the game devs.
---
So containers in Nuclear winter should be lootable. Including the med crates.
---
Well, if you’re referring to the obnoxious croaking frogs in jars, that’s something you can craft after starting the pioneer scouts quest line. It’s required for one of the Tadpole badges. However, if you’re referring to taming other creatures of the wasteland, I’m not sure. Bc I can’t seem to tame a single thing though I’ve thought I would as doing it correctly. But maybe I’m not
---
It IS strange, because there's still a lot of work to do on this game. It's much better than at launch, but still pretty bad. E3 doesn't reverse all that Bethesda has already done (or not done).
---
The random teams are bullshit, has anyone found a way to play with friends? 99% of the time you get lumped in with some shit heads that get killed in the first 3 minutes. It’s an abomination.
---
Just a regular .50 Cal? No prime receiver or any legendary effects?
---
Who cares. Either you like the game or you dont and streamers wont make it better or worse.
---
Are stagger perks recommended?
---
Sorry for the bad picture quality
---
Its a 3 star but i only remember 1. Its 10% damage when aiming
---
Ehhh. It kinda matters. You get more scrip per item the more stars it has. So 3* will get you the most. And weapons will get you more than armor pieces will.
---
This
---
You'll definitely need a team of people.  Just make a group request post in a fallout 76 discord or here with your system and screen name when you're ready. If you're planning on nuking the queen, I'd make the post before you launch the nuke so it'll give people time to group with you and you aren't sitting around waiting for the server to possibly crash.
---
Start a new character would be best. They level up pretty quickly at first.
---
Dear lord. I think the tin foil hat is a little too tight.
---
Ya'll remember when Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson banded together as [The Highwaymen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxNx4UbtNA4)?
---
Aye, have been thinking about it for a while. Its very tedious to say the least.
---
You'll need something with high DPS. I usually switch between my Deathclaw Gauntlet and a gatlin plasma since it has high dps and ammo is easy to come by. You can spend 5k rounds easy, so ammo can be an issue for most weapons.
---
Note mine are both bloodied, so i can average around 2k+ dmg per second on either. Only real difference is one i can engage at a safer distance.
---
You can also use it in the White Russian recipe
---
Yeah it was fun helping out a new player yesterday. Hooked up a dude up with an improve vault 76 suit and gave some food, stimps, and so on to a couple others. Hope they stick around too. Nice seeing this influx.
---
Possibly.  Folks like Jim Sterling and most of the hatorade drinkers are just using the "lul it should've been a basic feature at launch" argument to dismiss Wastelanders.
---
I haven’t seen an insincere comment yet.
---
With Aim down sights
---
I had a guy clipping under the terrain and he headshotted me and all my teammates with a lever action 1-2 apart
---
People are playing the game because it had a heavy presence at E3 and they wanted to check it out. No one's being payed to play it.
---
Punk would be why Social D covered it to great effect.
---
I care because they ripped off how many millions of players with trash. How many people sold their edition or gave it away (like I did) because they released a game for a quick buck before it was completed. I think I'll enjoy this mode, but not because Shroud and Grimmmz are playing it, but because I've been a long time Fallout fan and this actually looks like Fallout, the trash they released before was glitchy and just unplayable. So now they've made the game fairly playable and we're all going to forgive them. As for conspiracy, the major game companies actually have people who's job is to pump up their media presence and these people have numerous accounts that they just spam negative response with. No tin foil cap, it's a known practice.
---
When it says reach level X once - are the rewards account wide? Or are they character specific? Because they achievements are confusingly named.
---
You wouldn’t be able to use the bunny head since it isn’t necessarily in the atom shop. It was added directly to the players workbench and wasn’t actually bought in the store
---
If you could make a rocket launcher that shoots fireworks that would be amazing.
---
Go fuck yourselves. The game is shit and yet you keep parading the parasite around like it’s a success.
---
They should add Mannequins as clothing stashs
---
I mean it's free content so I guess that's a good thing but I'm looking forward to the wastelander DLC. I could really care less about Battle Royale to me it was just a fad who's Time i think has passed
---
Can we get someone to release a Nuclear Winter trailer with the Social Distortion cover of Ring of Fire?
---
This post is just classy.  Didn't have to be done.  Not like it's bringing in new players.  Just classy.  Thanks Bathesda peeps
---
Interesting. I had heard they hadn't banned for mods, just duping and such.
---
It’s not a dumb argument, if you been on the apex subreddit around when the game launched, a bunch of people praised the game for its ping system and how it works great for people who are hard of hearing or cant speak.
---
The ping system is universal, in the sense that you can point/mark at something that could help better distinguish things to people without the need of speaking to them or hell, even playing with people who don’t speak your language.
---
Damn that takes a lot of skill good job.
---
This is why PC players should hate consoles. Having this be on consoles and PC means we get left with garbage controls that only consoles should have to deal with.
---
I'm sick to death of touching my scroll wheel and bringing up the shitty favorites menu that can't be removed from it.
---
Do you mean like a paid subscription service for extra stash space? ESO has a similar feature. It’s a monthly subscription that gives the premium in game currency and unlimited crafting resource storage. I think that would be an interesting idea. I wouldn’t mind paying 10 dollars a month for 1500 atoms and unlimited junk storage. That would free up over half of my stash.  And a good value of atoms I would already be buying anyways.
---
I got an vampire  explosive 10 mm smg from her
---
Sounds like you better off closing the app entirely
---
That’s fucking amazing 😻
---
Well, cripple perks certainly are (if you cripple all the queen's limbs then it doesn't do anything). I think you're better off using One Gun Army with the stun-lock workaround than avoiding it entirely.
---
I hate battle royles but some reason i like this one lol
---
I really appreciate the work you've put in and continue to do. This game still has untapped potential. I personally still find gunplay to be underwhelming and would like to see another balance pass in that area with an eye towards fixing the ridiculous kneecapping that has occoured(some extended mag mods add 6" of magazine and that only holds two more bullets? Two shot legendary is two shots, not 120% damage come on now). Ideally just make it feel like Fallout 4 in PvE. Go the Destiny route and normalize damage vs players. It works, PvP and PvE are both super fun in Destiny 2. Play DayZ and learn how the dramatic tension of loss amps up the feelings the game can generate in PvP. Make complicated foods more worthwhile to make so that having a certain recipes is valuable. You want players to generate value to one another, so that people would think twice about killing on sight even if people were dropping everything they had on death. I hope that in future Elder Scrolls and Fallout games Co-op is an option, having tried the beta for Skyrim Together I don't want it to be an anomaly. And can you make future games so that mods like script extender are unnecessary? That would save the community a lot of days spent waiting for mod updates! Thank you!
---
Yep It sucks cause it could have been great
---
So when are we getting the survival mode rework? Some us enjoy pvp outside of a battleroyale
---
I just hit 50 on my first character and had about 700 saved, went through buying 2 star legendary armor and weapons and not one of them was any good.
---
Gulpers drop them as a not uncommon drop. Gulper loot tables seem to be basically everything listed as junk. I collected 4 of my 5 from gulpers with the 5th being from a footlocker of all places.
---
Not long wait ever for me
---
i do this. usually cranberry treats
---
Are you mad?
---
Yes sir! Not unlimited ! But caps per week/month for 800 lbs per locker.
---
Why?
---
What i meant is that, it doesnt matter if its a low level legendary or not.. because i remember not really wanting to do uranium fever and leader of the pack back in the day because they give out low leveled ones.. now its the stars that matters when turning them in..
---
Killing babies is easy.
---
I too role-play a raider that’s not a big dickhead
---
Use the left trigger if you’re on console.
---
i doubt it becuase there are still bugs in 76 from 4, like the stretched power armor bug and the bodies out of wack in power armor
---
tons of power armor type bugs.  and so basically what is my point? bethesda does not really  fix bugs.
---
I hope they keep it, I loved it, its a fun way to get caps and xp
---
I think the main problem is your expecting a traditional Fallout experience. FO76 is a survival game using the Fallout theme. So if you don’t like the emptiness or online role playing aspect. No matter how many bugs they fix you still won’t like it. Not until year two anyways when they introduce npc and fractions.
---
Thats a dumb reason to being an ass
---
Now I'm a tad confused, so is the hellfire paint set a skin that turns other power armor visual into hellfire armor? (Like the rider power armor skins did) Or is it just a paintjob for yet unreleased hellfire power armor to come?
---
I can't find this.  Link please?
---
you would get your ass tore out by the not nerfed mobs..
---
I think so. It would be an interesting change and the end game pve in survival would be really hard.   I think it’d be good though
---
YES! Please do. This is exactly the kind of response we hope to see! :D "Paying it Forward"
---
\[story time\]  
---
It's what got me into doing it.  
---
One day at a Train Station I found a container full of junk. I thought I just found a lucky cache that Bethesda had created... As a week or more goes by and I played more, I realized that you don't see containers with that much loot in them.
---
That meant the only way it would have gotten there was by a generous player... It was around that time when I was starting to fill up my Stash and was seeing that I can't just keep hoarding all this junk. So from then on I would "Pay It Forward" by dropping off tons of junk in containers at whatever Train Station I was at. Making it a point to collect all the junk I found, every plan I came across even ones I had learned, then at the end of my play session I'd stop off a Flatwoods Church to unload it all in to the Overseer's Chest for a new player to find. Stock it full of ammo, armor, weapons, chems, food, purified water, plans and recipes :)
---
I *still* do this. Some people sell 'junk' in their Vending machines, but not me. I give it away and use my vending slots for legendary items offered at *sane prices* that people can afford. As a result, I continually reach 25K caps. Was in the middle of helping someone a few days back when I had gotten a number of sales. Lacking a Mic, I had to get a bunch of steel and go to their camp to spell out with signs "Trade me 1x Ammo for 3K" lol 
---
I'd rather give away 3K caps just so my store can stay open for people to buy stuff, versus reach the 25K limit and those caps be literally lost to the server if someone buys something. :P  
---
\[/story time\]
---
there is a can in the locked fridge in flatwoods
---
You call it being an ass, I call it having fun at the expense of noobs. And it makes all of you mad because you can’t stop me. I’m going to keep posting more of these clips of the noobs getting slaughtered.
---
I know. You miss seeing him play with the teddy bear.
---
Why, it's a shotgun, they only have much range before it would become unrealistic
---
Ideas like these is why I never gave up on FO76.  
---
They can expand the game in so many directions, there are so many things they can work on with time.  
---
And holy hell I love fishing in games where the main focus isnt fishing. From Tibia, to WoW, to Dayz and Terraria, and now this.  
---
Bethesda pls
---
HOLY SHIT GUYS I CAN CONFIRM THIS!  
---
I just came here to post that I had a BOS jumpsuit drop for me from "The Messenger", then I saw this and checked farther down in my inventory. It gave me more! 
---
I got: **BOS Jumpsuit**, Forrest Scout Armor Mask, Machanic Jumpsuit, Urban Scout Armor Mask, **White Powder Jumpsuit**, AND a **Whitesprings Jumpsuit**!
---
Pics or it didn't happen:

---
My starting point was directly above Helvetia, and the ending point was New River Gorge Resort. If you see the Messenger right beside the town of Helvetia, jump on this event IMMEDIATELY. ;)
---
Thank you so, so much for this game and for putting out constant fixes and free additions. Your hard work and care is extremely plain to see. I’ve put in almost 300 hours since the beginning of the B.E.T.A, and I’ve always enjoyed myself. I’m so excited for you future of the game, especially Wastelanders. NW is surprisingly fun too.
---
Once again, THANK YOU &lt;3
---
Not really it's just sad you have to kill lower lvls because you have no chance killing someone the same lvl as you.
---
I once had a big junkyard with a pet deathclaw in the ash region and hung up a bunch of "beware of claw" posters all around it. He was my guard dog and I miss him
---
Whitesprings, Whitesprings nuked, Blackwater mine, Uranium Fever at Blackwater mine, Harpers Ferry, The Burrows under Harpers Ferry, Burrows nuked, Sheepsquatch event called Free Range, any of these should get you legendaries. Nuked are better than vanilla.
---
I could see that as the free in game option. That they would release along side the paid subscription. That way every one is happy.
---
Less than three minutes on the thread and my mostly positive comment was downvoted enough to become hidden... Nice job Bethesda, your employees are hard at work.
---
Are you that bad at the game u gotta pray on noobs?
---
People would probably actually play it then
---
1: yes. 2: Live Chic at Whitesprings usually has them. I think they're 250 caps or so.
---
I've been rocking a bathrobe, red ski hat, and sunglasses for months.
---
I have a clip for you. I just need to find it.
---
Why I have no problem killing them with normal weapons? Granted I just dont charge right in...
---
I lost my faith with you Bethesda, and I used to be one of your biggest fan boys. But I can see that you are trying and you are earning my trust back.
---
Please don’t be like EA. Fight against the stereotype
---
I swear I notice it if I sprint alot.
---
Yeah, we NEED pets. That don't get killed. And follow us around. IDGAF if they're just decorative.
---
Since "ever" is everyone happy?
---
Actually they are missing the lobby feature. Where you can team up and que for a game. Where when you die it returns you to the lobby where you can wait for your team or if solo install re que. right now it sends you to the main menu which is slow and cumbersome when trying to team play as a team.
---
I would love to see it.

I'm on PC, actually.
---
Xbox 🙃
---
Play around with the bluprinting feature. Its perfect if you make a flat bottomed base, because you can usually stick it anywhere
---
Very nice!
---
No you actually can..
---
No life mode activated
---
I, too, have failed to understand why they'e not made the light functional on the clothing/armor which feature one... Was the same way in Fallout 4 (as TheRealTurdFurgusonn mentioned). The Marine Armor helmet --that they haven't officially made available in 76-- also has a light on it from what I've seen, which no doubt doesn't function as well.
---
Therefore, I concur: make it functional!  
---
Make the shoulder-lamps on the Excavator work like depicted in the Garrahan posters, while you're at it! :)
---
Wastelanders possibly.
---
Slicing Joe’s should have a vendor bot that sells it.
---
Fallout X Supreme
---
Ye i found out later
---
That link is broken
---
Most, or most vocal. Well, at least I can play fucking fortnite and fallout without having to swap games. So there's that at least.
---
If people are digging this expanded pvp stuff, more power to them. For me personally, total shit sandwhich. When I want to play gears, I'll play gears 
---
0/10 for NW unless and/or until the mechanics, locations, gear, et al, are available to non pvp players.
---
I love playing this game so much and singing country roads with some friends is so much fun. 
---
I know I have asked for this a lot but what would be the easiest way to obtain a lever action rifle plan? 
---
I have spent so much time server-hopping just to try to find a plan some where.
---
Correct. If i happen to loot a fairly decent 2 or 3* legendary I’ll try to sell it. Otherwise they, and the 1* ones, go into the vending machine for scrip. Though, may the odds be ever in your favor when it comes to The Purveyor. Bc the RNG god’s stat rolls can be atrocious. I’ve gotten some absolute crap 3* stuff from her. I’ve gotten some mixed results with the 3* armors, and some truly awful 3* melee weapons. I seem to have the best luck with the 3* ranged weapons.
---
So it doesn't effect adventure right? I'm here for same answer lol
---
This isnt the final build.  Just make sure we have them see our suggestions
---
https://youtu.be/mrRC9cZyZCI
---
Streaming!
---
Very glad you've kept the game going. It's far more fun than people gave it credit for. I know you probably won't listen to my suggestion, but for future Fallout related stuff, I'd avoid putting so much emphasis on streamers... they really poisoned the well, at least for 76. I can't forget the top streamers who were calling it "The worst fallout ever made" while simultaneously playing it for 24 hours straight.
---
The matches will get a lot more interesting when there's buildings everywhere.
---
STREAMING!
---
Yeahh dont worry about that. Just focus on getting your special stats where you want them because you can pick any card you want after 50.
---
I think it adds a lot more depth to the mode, being able to have different set blueprints for different situations.
---
It’s NW pal
---
Its not bethesda doing it...but keep wearing that tin foil hat!
---
I actually prefer to melee in 3rd person
---
I keep getting matched with really low level players who seem to think I know what I’m doing because of my level. I just keep playing until I level up. Haven’t actually won once. Got second place twice. But I’m pretty sure that was just luck and statistics because I’m terrible at it. But I want that swag! 😂
---
Not sure if it is important, but the see through parts of the coat only occur on the back half of the coat and boots, the front half is fine. The see through only shows parts of the under armor.
---
Shotguns irl are not ranged weapons... unless you are talking long barrel for skeet shooting. They’re for killing things close enough to touch
---
60 million?
---
Don't make excuses for her... *embrace* your inner crack-whore!! lol
---
I'd love to call you a Jet Junkie, alas, we don't have that in 76. :\
---
.....Mmmmaybe the Wastelanders will bring it with them?? heh
---
Not saying that you should be able to use it as a sniper, but there is a middleground, and even with perks that reduce spread and increase range, you still have to be completely up in their face to do significant damage, not really a fan of that tbh.
---
So I feel like they could up the range a bit.
---
The sheeple have come home
---
🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑
---
Sorry I haven't played it. I was under the assumption that your character is connected to adventure mode.
---
Nothing, it's a skin for stash boxes that you can build in your camp.
---
They could, but you still need to be fairly close because that's what a shotgun it
---
I looted a dog helmet off a guard dog during the SBQ fight. So there’s got to be some reason why they’re in the loot tables.
---
Just please please PLEASE don't let Nuclear Winter take resources away from Adventure mode. Adventure mode is why we all bought the game in the first place. As fun as Nuclear Winter is, the PvE content matters more!
---
Now rumors of the Get off my lawn monster have become legend.... In the next installment of Tales from The West Virginia Hills we'll hear the tale of two intrepid level 2 explorers who encountered the horrifying OLD MAN LAWN MONSTER OF WEST VIRGINIA...
---
  I was going to make a thread about this but cba. This happened an hour ago.  
---
  I stopped playing a few months after release, came back this week. I thought I was still too strong for the game, Scorchbeasts were annoying but doable. Still, I decided to go explore and do more events, while Im doing a Messenger Event I stumble upon some Brahmins and a new Event to get them to their Farm.  
---
  I heard about sheepsquatches, didn't care too much, "wow a new monster, neat, probably weak though".  
---
  What do I get after I deliver those tasty cows to their farm? Two level 100s (I am 89) Sheepsquatches that didnt drop a single point of health from my bullets. I panicked so hard, hadn't felt that trill in a while, running away to get cover (except it was useless versum those god damn hedgehog minotaurs)  
---
I had to buy a repair kit out of the Atom Shop in the middle of the fight to repair my gun twice. I had over 2k rounds of 5.56 when it started, down to like 200.   
---
Im grabbing my chems and going for round two later.
---
Absolutely. I saw that potential immediately and I have three different ones of different sizes. I found they aren’t always easy to place. So a smaller base is of benefit for easier placement.
---
Nah the levels are overseer ranks and are achieved very slowly. You get a lot of packs early game but if your rng sucks then you are pretty much locked out of a viable build to dps some enemies. I was just recommending a solution so people don’t have to suffer getting duplicate cards as much.
---
Yeah I saw that at a vendor I think, basically somewhere I couldn't try it myself. Can you put it on or is it just a useless item for now
---
What am I looking at?
---
You and NMS easily the best comebacks with easily the best communities at this point.
---
Oh ok awesome thanks
---
Brother you didn't need to force shit to get your experience defined by bugs and laughably poor design around release. By all accounts it's better now but this game was janky as fuck for a while and quite rightly got called out for it.
---
You’ll need to say what you’re playing on.
---
So do any of my perks or levels carry over or is it a fresh start basically
---
Do u pick locks/ hack terminals? I almost always find a good weapons and good armor by picking things they other people run by
---
Yeah. Indestructible camps and turrets have killed survival mode imho. Worse than even all the top tier weps and armor used in it.
---
they would have to show somehow its a sponsored stream or they can get banned on twitch and legal issues
---
This is my worst nightmare for this game. It would kill a lot of the player base though.
---
I did, i said I’m on PC
---
I dont really understand why? Get a blackpowder and a stealth boy. Bean them right in the noodle. Plop bag of goodies for you.
---
Or a stealth semi auto.. They cant tell which way it's comming from lol. Jack up the rof and let em have it.
---
I would love to see a PA buff tho. Those guys should be immune to stealth multiplier and head multiplier (if they have all of the pieces oc)
---
Mr Tickles is more of a Deathclaw name, lets be honest here
---
Like the camp?
---
Yeah. You work at Bethesda but your post history is comparing Bethesda to EA and searching for free ways to play fallout on a Mac. 
---
Put some proof and I'll delete this comment.
---
MonkaS is an emoji ... and yeah I’ve looked lol maybe one day I’ll figure it out
---
I took a video of this same dude not 5minutes ago flying around the map in a hazmat suit with unlimited ammo, health, aim-bot, etc. Has to be a sad life when cheating this hard is all you have, but maybe he just really wants all that vault 51 lore sooo bad!
---
Have done that,but seems ok now
---
I wanna take the opportunity to thank the random stranger that gifted me some food today! I don't remember your username but mine matches my Reddit one :) I was sceptical of the game but I'm enjoying my time with it so far
---
If you actually work with a media team they sure do let you get away with flaming a lot lmao
---
https://youtu.be/-Qj8ZdwJHxk
---
No thank you. You brought a game that has showed me what a true family is. People hated 76 and still hate it. But you guys never gave up. Ever. And we couldn’t be more thankful for making Fo76 the game it is today. My parents grew up in Rockville and Potomic so I’ve always had a special connection with you guys knowing that Rockville is a small town and you guys came from there. The fact that you guys never gave up shows a lot. When it comes to the great games you guys have made, knowing it came from a town that I visit every summer is truly special. Also, the games you guys have made have let me have a world to escape to when life is hard. And Fallout 76 made it even more special because of this community. Thank you Bethesda, and can’t wait for more works to come.
---
Its customary to list your platform and region with these kind of posts
---
Make it the Mistress of Mystery Invisible backpack fashion accessory skin available in the ATOM store!  Wonder Woman had an invisible jet -- you can have an invisible backpack. Only fair.
---
I am still having this issue.
---
Oh I haven’t listen to all her holotapes so I didn’t know she was sick
---
Don’t know why you started a new thread but basically:
---
Your adventure perk distribution does nothing BUT allow you to have cards in each respective special. You start with no perk packs and are given some pre set basic cards. Each perk card pack gives one card and if you get a duplicate the card burns and gives you a meager 50 xp
---
I’m a part of the hot-take division of the media team. I specialize in spicy takes

I want able to take a video but he straight up one shorted me and my teammates behind cover, and his kills are over 30
---
Jesus thanks.  Was getting so tired of Clown Costume every 3 days and thought the only sleepwear was old, retired atom store stuff at this point
---
Lol *embraces*
---
intended; there are multiple perks to buff your shotgun output
---
Yes of course, you let em know whats good but also keep it classy. I see
---
Maybe. I just have lost trust in Bethesda. It's like the creepy uncle that no one trusts to be alone with their kids.
---
Looking forward to it. It won't be worth much if it doesn't include finer grained checkpoints for long missions. The need for me is less about getting back to the same server shard but restoring the session, in context, where I was. I want it all baby!
---
That's awesome man
---
If you buy it online at walmart u can get the culturefly fallout loot box free. They're selling these loot boxes for $34 on Amazon.

---
It’s a beta. A sneak peak. We should absolutely flag this sort of stuff to BGS’s attention, but let’s not get too wound up about how a very clearly indicated beta is gonna ruin the reputation of the game.
---
Well at least it sounds like it
---
I love leaving low levels with bad impressions of the game, it's not as if people already dislike it and the free trial is giving them a chance to try it.
---
Your an asshole buddy.
---
Don’t forget to hit the dislike button because you can’t do what I do.
---
Cool story. If people wanna pvp then pvp away. But going out and killing every new player getting on while it’s free is just being a douche.
---
Well, theoretically they could expand it out over time, but initially they could potentially serve a number of purposes:
---
1. On-demand quest givers
---
2. Vendors?
---
3. Managing your CAMP while you're away (harvesting plants/water, defending alongside turrets, etc.)
---
4. Romance
---
5. RP flavor for the creative folks (i.e. putting someone behind a bar to act as a bartender)
---
Just depends on what Bethesda's able to have them do.
---
Wow. U know ur fucking ass if u gotta pick on a level seven in leather armor and even then can’t one shot them.
---
Isn't there sort of a taming system in the game?  Maybe they'll expand on that eventually.
---
Careful with that... Prob ok but id take screenshots cause ppl have been banned for picking up duped stuffs.
---
I have a sign on my wall for .38 1cap for 10
---
And 10mm 1cap for 5
---
I get it around 2k then i just start handing it out in bits.
---
Not saying he's duping cause if you dont use an ammo type thats not a crazy amount. Just protect yourself just in case. Photo mode is super ez to use and at least you have somekind of record if things go south.
---
I don't see anything wrong with this video it's survival mode after all
---
Yes, its a pretty big loss. agree
---
If you are removed by the auto mod, send a message to the sub mods via the link they provide you so they can unlock your post
---
Look at the toolbar at the bottom of the screen, the one that tells you the buttons for each command. If you’re looking at the extractor in edit mode, it’ll tell you how to lock it.
---
Someone downvoted you. It’s like I DIDNT KILL A LEVEL 100 as a level 11 noob.
---
You flat out sound like someone who hasn't played the game since last November. "The actual game is still really bad", are you serious, the actual game is in a pretty dam good state now and has been for a while. If you actually do some looking around just about everyone really likes the new mode and I agree, It's pretty dam fun so why would it be so hard to believe that right after e3 and the showcase for it lots of people are playing it?
---
If u buy it at walmart u can get a free box of fallout loot
---
Nope
---
Hmmm...you MIGHT have fucked yourself buying (And specifically, LEARNING) the Initiate paint without getting it from a drop. It has been removed from the loot pool, so learning it now might break the quest if you haven't already learned Knight Paint first.

Patrolling the Mojave Almost Makes You Wish For a Nuclear Winter

Exactly if you're level 50 you're just as much as strong as a level 100.
---
I've encountered more pvp instigators level 70s than anything in adventure mode.
---
It's called Survival. Get over yourself.
---
Every couple of hours or sooner for me on the PC.
---
Because it has one of the lowest overall approval scores of any game ever released and it was supposed to be a AAA title. I just feel for all the kids who got it for Christmas. Can you imagine how many still go to sleep having nightmares after playing it?
---
I was level 11. So yeah, this sub is butthurt because they said “you bad picking on noobs” well there they go. A video of me as a noob raping a high level noob
---
I’m going to keep murdering them.
---
It's just a copy/paste from fo4, you can't equip it sadly.
---
Is it new?? It definitely wasn't there at launch when I checked. I'm on Xbox.
---
Lol welcome to 76
---
Thank you so much. Been looking for the lowest price on this game since it's only free this week and I'm still not 101% sold on it. But at 17 I can't complain.
---
Exactly, did they forget we've patrolled the Mojave long enough?
---
There's a new category in the build menu for the vending machine, and they only cost like v5 steel and some plastic to build. Hook it up to power source and you show up on the map. Disconnect the power and you're invisible again.
---
The game updates very often and it's all free. There's no bustling city. Everyone is dead due to the scorched plague. It's up to you to help and bring people back. And you do since humans return this fall.
---
There needs to be some choice in perks. I'm a rifle build, and have gotten 8 melee STR perks. It's a bit ridiculous, as my STR is 4.
---
The NCR trooper tried to warn us, but we didnt listen

Every big company pays streamers. Its advertising.

Everytime I stop the game in the middle of a mission , when I come back hrs later or the next day I'm kicked out if whatever building and the whole thing has reset.
---
Ah, xbox. I assume the majority of people are on console like me, and you can't alter the horrendously close first-person FOV. With it + the weird blurry horizon, I literally get headaches from first person 76. Forced to play in 3rd.
---
The only reason it is completely good is that all the negative ways to interact with other players have been removed

Aren’t you the guy that keeps spamming the sub about hating how nice the community is?

Did it need to be while playing NW?

Guilty.

Oh dang I need to stop shooting at the ground to show where the bag is xD I'm such a noob.

Basic stuff that should have been in game from the beginning. Not in Bethesda's games though.

You’re just mad that you’re not as good as I am.

Now that we have an option to see the damage numbers, has anyone used one to see what happens? Would be interesting to know if healing numbers show :)
---
They pulled a reverse-Treyarch and actually linked the game modes together instead of forcing us to grind separately. Brilliant. Just brilliant. @treyarch\_official

Itd be the most arbitrary thing to initiate pvp over but id do it

Amen!

Get rid of the stupid emote wheel and give me this!

Or even the dpad... can’t eve count how many times I accidentally used a stimp!
---
Start a new one
---
Wouldn’t want the four people to see your comment think I’m a phony!!! Unlike your girlfriend that lives 3 states over and is actually a dude I am as real as it gets baby
---
Welcome new players! If I find you I will murder you.
---
If the offered a transfer I would most likely move to PC as well...
---
@coldshadow31 so I'm not allowed to suggest anything
---
That is the case for me. I like to leave everything unlocked so other players can take shelter and get some extra junk if needed.
---
Do it prior to the lobby
---
I’m just sad for you man. But good luck on getting better and enjoying the game!
---
That hack lol hackers have to get banned quick.
---
300+ hours in the game and that's the only reason I haven't launched a nuke yet. Every single time I try, it either crashes or an objective gets glitched making it impossible to finish. I also haven't done Arktos yet because the elevator door has no button on it for me. At least I can fight SBQ but I've really missed out thanks to these bugs.
---
Just got my copy yesterday. Downloading the huge ass 66GB update now. Good to know there's nice people in this game. Unlike in other MMOs
---
Exactly. This was a huge step for the Bethesda team, making their first multiplayer game, and instead of dropping it like it was a hot pocket fresh outta the microwave when the initial wave of backlash came up, they took it and used if to mold it into a great game.
---
Do it from the main menu select the social tab look for your friends name and inv to a team and you're good to go
---
It's called learning to PVP instead of preying on the weak.
---
Power Armor Edition if $46 via Amazon Warehouse.   Gonna try that and see if I can get the helmet.  I know the bag is nylon. I don't really care for $46...
---
Nah don't worry she's legit I asked her and she said all she used was meelee and shotgun for the first 30 levels and she got all that.
---
I have a viscous wolf. I call him Vicious Wolf.
---
Your argument is bad and you should feel bad.
---
Love this community and this game
---
I’m just going to go ahead and state a very obvious observation here...
---
This dude’s literally just a troll who’s clearly only doing this, not bc he thinks it’s “fun” to kill noobs and steal their stuff, but so he can upload these videos on the internet in an attempt to anger random people he doesn’t know for attention. It’s like when toddlers continue to do all this bad stuff bc it gets them some kind of attention, albeit negative attention, but attention all the same. Evidently, this individual never grew out of that negative behavior, bc obviously negative attention is better than no attention and being ignored, right? 😑
---
So, for those of us who aren’t trolls, the best thing we can do is to deprive him of the negative attention he so desperately seeks by just not reacting to his nonsense.
---
I've enjoyed tge whole creepy ghost town feel of the game but am excited to finally have some more interactions and quests hopefully.
---
Again you sound like you haven't played since November.  Go actually play the game before saying it sucks.
---
Thanks for your input, chud
---
Might I suggest turning on Pacifist to eliminate PvP worries. I've seen a lot of people "teach others a lesson" for leaving pacifist off and friendly firing on randoms during events and whatnot. I actually was helping a noob the other day and forget to tell him that bit of advice. Long story short, we're at my camp and I'm upstairs repairing when I get killed from behind. Apparently guy had accidentally initiated pvp without knowing the consequences and I paid the price.
---
You blind yourself to the truth, it’s ok. There was a scholar journal that replaced  the world nazi and Jews with feminists terminology in a mein kampf passage. That journal was published and the publishers don’t even know they published a mein kampf passage for the feminist agenda.
---
I play on ps4 I'm not talking about the display name in talking about your charecters name like the one you see on your pip boy
---
I'd genuinely get into this game if I had the time
---
"Unfortunate placement"
---
If you haven't tried it yet, try it now that it's free.
---
*pulls out uno reverse card*
---
Haha. Do you hear yourself think when you write this stuff? xD
---
I actually didn't say it sucked, I was asking if two of the biggest FPS streamers on Twitch were being paid to stream the game. I think it looks fun, but that was from watching Unsanity play it. I will probably try it, but I will never forget and I will never buy another Bethesda product until I'm sure it's not another money grab.
---
Less than three
---
Def not a hack. Has happened to me before. Its lag on the server side.
---
No worries, they have made many improvements since launch. But you’re right, at $17 one can’t complain.
---
I've been around since beta. Recently took a few weeks' break but back to playing now. Love all the updates and looking forward to what's coming.
---
I only have one request. I'd like to be able to paint my sniper rifle silver or gray. Chrome would be awesome too. :)
---
I completed an event with a lvl 120ish player (I am lvl 11) and once we completed the event I went about my merry way and on to the next mission/event, this guy went out of his way to msg me through Xbox and said ‘hey where did you go? I was gonna give you some supplies!’ I’m actually blown away by how wholesome the community is everyone is so nice!
---
I agree about the "no" on a ping system. When my teammates engage its more realistic and/or immersive to have to figure out where theyre firing at.
---
Oh cool. Tell me more!
---
Got a ghoul slayers wooden chest piece from my first squatch earlier today
---
I wonder if Bethesda knows they hired a racist.. they do now
---
Oh I see. Seems like there's no way to change your character name yet. Hope they'll add this in the near future tho.
---
The other night my vox syringer quest disappeared along with the gun as I was about to finish it, crashed and it rolled back.
---
What do you need?
---
TUrN oFF CapS LoCK
---
I'm on ps4
---
Hit the always run button, check under your keybinds/controller settings.
---
...Elder Scrolls Online?
---
Have you found Sickleman’s cellar yet? That was creepy.
---
Do u feel better now?
---
Yeah, I had initially thought that I had it enabled already but apparently not. Needless to say, it's on now lol
---
I will wear that badge with pride. Granted, I didn’t buy the game while it was in beta, but I did get it for Christmas, and even though it was a little rocky with the few bugs I’ve encountered, it’s ironed out to be one hell of a good time, especially since most of the people are usually pretty friendly. I say usually because you’re bound to run into a toxic pile of pvp-thirsty shit that will try to ruin the experience for you, but the good vastly outweighs the bad here.
---
Yes this was I nice therapy session
---
I agree, I also feel that they had a great idea and put their hearts into it but it was simply the time limit. The game is leaps and bounds better than what it was and is truly a good game.
---
damn theres no depth of field slider on console either? i'd hate to play a bethesda game on console
---
I don't mean to be rude or ignore the problems that are there, but you probably just need more practice, by level 10 in NW you should have this stuff figured out, it just takes time, want less weapons at a time? Pick less up I only ever hold 4 and with meds I usually just wing it with  the favorites wheel
---
I've had that happen to me a few times in the past few months.  I usually try switching to the map or challenges.  Jumping to another location usually helps.
---
I'm looking for people to hook up with if you wanna form a group
---
Shh
---
I mean, the guitar banjo and frame drum together sounds pretty nice, but that’s just me
---
The most negative minority are always the loudest. Just because you hear a lot of criticism, doesn’t mean there aren’t many of us enjoying your game, and loving it.
---
We’re just too busy playing to spend our time online writing comments.
---
the game mode is actually unplayable.
---
Melee weapons serve one main purpose, and they serve it well: quietly taking out hostile AI mobs without giving away your position to everyone in a quarter mile radius.
---
That said, I used a switchblade to finish off a downed player the other day. That was fun.
---
Are you autistic? If you actually looked at the picture you fat libtard instead of jumping on the loser wagon you would realize it’s a JOKE you homo
---
You mean like on PC? Because you can do that already
---
Give us Dogmeat Ver. 2
---
My uplink quest got rolled back. Unsure at the BoS main quest part dealing with the Scorchbeasts
---
Then find the walk/run button. Press that.
---
Please make it fly fishing for God’s sakes!!!
---
It's SURVIVAL. You kill EVERYONE you can. Survival of the fittest. Anyone complaining is whining for no reason.
---
It's definitely on their list of fixes they need to do 🙂 Someone had this same experience about an hour after NW was released.
---
They do? They're all made to play songs that match when any 4 are paired. They aren't mastered or anything tho because it isn't a CD and the teams are 4 max so they don't sound great all at once. But they do play actual music.
---
Ive noticed that too playing on xbox. Wont let me run, have to go to the pip boy and change weapons is what fixes it for me
---
Tell me more! So interesting!
---
that is if you dont remember to delete them. I took my first 10 with the power armor. it looks pretty sweet.
---
It was added sometime after launch. I assume it's on everything, but all I can confirm is that it's there on PC.
---
There should be an option though to click on a hotkey then click an icon of a weapon a sorta quick way of hot keying its just super overwhelming for new players and most wont last long is all im trying to say
---
If you die in survival, it's on you. Preying on the weak or not. You can do it. That's the point. You are top dog until someone comes and crushes you.
---
I’ll take your stuff! Free if charge
---
The UI for NW needs a overhaul over all
---
why do you keep following the fallout 76 reddit if you think the game is such a dumpster fire? If you don’t like it, then you know how to unfollow subreddits, and let those of us who actually genuinely enjoy the game enjoy the game without toxic little shits like you constantly shitting on our parade
---
Maybe? I don't think we know yet.
---
I think move NW to survival, i want pvp like that with all my fallout gear ive grinded for
---
Huge Fallout fan that skipped it because it just sounded so "not" a Fallout game.  Got the trial, love it so far at level 10 taking it slow building, roaming, etc.  Bought it today too, even got a sweet free Steelbook and a Vault Boy keychain with it.
---
Ya thats mostly the case. Like i said i sell it for 200 caps cause i dont use 10mm. Good find tho im at the munitions factory right now making .45 can never get enough of that!
---
Godspeed
---
You do you, and let us do us.
---
THANK YOU FOR CONFIRMED RAIDER THEMED CONTENT.
---
THE GAME NEEDS A MORE REALISTIC APPROACH TO POST NUCLEAR AMERICA
---
running around with no weapons punching multiple ppl to death?
---
good luck on that and watch as afterwards they walk up to their victim both times like normal movement
---
Sense you're using the death claw gauntlet in assuming you don't use power armor. What normal are you running with?
---
I would assume so, they let beta players keep their stats and gear going in. I also find it hard to believe they would remove all the rewards you earned so far after the beta, and if they let you keep your rewards it wouldn't make sense to reset your level
---
That was in Fallout 4
---
Well, it's weird, I definitely can rebind them. I could do so to any key on my keyboard, just not my mouse for some reason.
---
Wait, it does?
---
I believe it is the Inferno Armour at OR 100
---
That and reloading seem to do the trick on Xbox for me
---
Exactly!!! While it is a randomly distributed earned advantage, an advantage does exist. I keep seeing people say there are no advantages, when in fact there is. For instance I got Incisor rank 3 and frog legs 300% jump height, i think that's what the % was) for my first couple packs. Luckily I have just enough agility on my main character to use it but it has so far given me a huge advantage in CQC as I can just hop around them and make it extremely hard for them to hit me. And with Incisor I cut right through that scout armor. And that's just 2 perks. I have no idea what cards are out there with whatever abilities, but I absolutely love it. Unlike opening a perk pack in adventure (a rather dull affair at this point), getting a new card in NW is mostly always exciting. But yeah, between cards and character stats there is definitely an advantage for higher level players (to a lesser extent) and higher level overseer rank players (to a greater extent). While that does exist, I think it's fine and doesn't hurt the game mode, but rather encourages everyone to try and level up and earn their own awesome cards.
---
Always thought about that, will be very nice to play some Beethoven or Dvorak,but Bethesda is better in bringing new bugs than doing something for the players. Love this game, it’s just annoying to update new content and loose old one. I’m talking About Gun Fu!
---
Theres no always run just l2 to sprint and sometimes when i try to sprint my character will stop immediately a couple times
---
What's the catch?
---
We all know it’s not the same
---
I just posted about this, I'm lvl 11 and I have no idea what I have unlocked so far
---
No catch, I like helping out new people.
---
Heavy weapons are fun, but need a lot of ammo. Rifles are good but there are no weight reducing perks for rifles. I advise picking one main weapon class (eg rifles or heavy weapons) and a light side arm (eg pistol, smg or small melee weapon) for when things go wrong. I have a character that uses a gatling gun and a 10mm smg. It's great fun but involves huge amounts of lead, steel and gunpowder.
---
I would say yes, being yourself is still role-playing based on my own experiences. I tend to wear a leather mask, womans clothing and chase them with a flaming chainsaw.
---
Usually have them chill behind me while a do a whitespring run.
---
I know the post is a joke, but as a whole the "nobody asked for ___" argument is just stupid. If we were to take that seriously, innovation wouldn't exist.
---
Technically speaking, FO76 came out before Scrolls Online, so 76 was their first online multiplayer game. Scrolls Online is pretty close in second, though.
---
I'm split between hax, and poor internet. A lot of that looks like someone's ping to the server kept dropping.
---
I’m going to get a tommy gun at belching better soon
---
Yeah, I believe off is the default setting. May even have to toggle it for each character (Idk as I only run 1 character).
---
 The combat, driving, and exploration was the best in the entire series, bar none. Plot is very similar to the first game and in that sense it's serviceable, but doesn't quite fit in how more open the game is. 
---
Characters, honestly, if you compare them to the first game, are far better. Like if you compare them to Garrus in all three games, of course they won't compare, but compared to, say, Garrus in the first game? Most are about the same, if not better.
---
🙄 I’m just going to go ahead and correct you, bc you obviously misinterpreted my motive for posting the above comment. What you meant to say was “other people’s general anger when they can’t stop me makes me crack up.”  This doesn’t actually anger me and i don’t really care to try and stop you.  Bc what random people are doing on the internet doesn’t effect my own life , so there’s actually no reason why it should or could anger me. As I clearly stated in my above comment, this is merely me stating an observation. So you just go on ahead with your trollish ways. ✌🏼
---
Same lol. What platform you on?
---
If you haven't played at least 1,000,000 hours of Fallout 76 you don't get an opinion on it. Sound dumb to you? I hope it does. Because saying "You should have to invest more than five hours into something you're not enjoying to have a valid opinion on it" is dumb.
---
There is a lot to do taking your time is a good idea
---
Third post on the front page

---
Texas holdem and black jack would be really cool. And being able to bet caps to make it profitable to.
---
Maybe even have tables of just bots for when you can't find players.
---
 Yea with perks for sure
---
["It was originally released for Microsoft Windows and OS X in April 2014."](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_Scrolls_Online)
---
76 came out last year.
---
Well part of the fun for me anyway.
---
&gt;Bupkis
---
lulz
---
How anecdotal of you
---
There's a workshop just for ammo? And do workshops only work when you're online?
---
There is the problem, the download size isn't right in the first place
---
Oh wow, I never noticed that.
---
Thanks for pointing it out
---
I am right there with you. Killing other vault dwellers holds zero interest for me. I'm here to rebuild the Wasteland.
---
It would even be something to satisfy late game players. Nothing else to do? All grinded out? Bet your legendaries against another high level player for a high stakes game of Texas Holdem, all skill and luck.
---
That would be great! Keep the ability to earn legendaries for adventure mode on survival but have all legendary effects turned off during survival.
---
Can you friend request him?
---
I should do that
---
Surplus from when I was being cloned could be sold
---
Huh. I just kinda assumed that because I hadn’t even known about Scolls Online’s existence until about New Years of this year, that it didn’t exist until about a week before. My bad.
---
Thanks. I figured as much, but thought I would ask anyway. I’m really liking it!
---
How about support for Fallout 4 VR? It has potential to be absolutely amazing but the support has been none existent.
---
They would have to go back to the ESRB if they did this since Fallout 76 doesn't have a simulated gambling warning on the back cover.
---
 Its not so much graphics but more the actual design of what the game was. 
---
Hearing what happened with Anthem actually made me respect Bioware Montreal more. Like, they screwed up in terms of time, management and money, but at least they had an idea of what they wanted to do (procedurally generated worlds while keeping the RPG element) amid just couldn't get it to work. Edmonton literally didn't know whay they were doing until they made that E3 2017 build so that EA wouldn't scrap their project.
---
Glad I’m not the only one lol
---
Don't feed the troll.
---
Build a vending machine and start selling ammo/junk/duplicate recipes.
---
Get Hard Bargain Rank 3, make enough to buy 1 mutation serum off someone who crafted one from the chemistry station (spend 200 and doesn’t matter which serum), and sell to vendor for 430 Caps. Repeat.
---
Yep. I try to start one if im going to be on for a bit.
---
There is a workshop for amlost everything. But ppl can try and take it from you.
---
Charleston land fill has 3 junk piles and posidion across the river has fusion cores amd lead.
---
Good two to take as they are so close and the xp is great for defend missions that happen every so often.
---
Just set one up and go about your normal day and passively get stuff. Pretty great.
---
lolol feels bad
---
OHHHH MAAAAAH GODDDDDD
---
Yes, but you’re still here commenting and replying. So yeah, keep wasting your time. I still don’t feel bad. Stay tuned for the murder compilation: coming soon.
---
I do agree with you, quoting someone who was quoting another one: "good business gives us things we didnt know we wanted", or something along these lines.  
---
I despise Battle Royales, but since it doesnt affect me, whatever. (Though I am enjoying it for now while no "pro hardcore people" are on the scene, NW is pretty fun)
---
Hell yeah and you wish you were too.
---
There's one in 76 too, I just saw it the other night
---
As someone who plays with a strength of 5 I half-acre. I used bandolier and it is kinda a mandatory pick, I also have the explosive weight reduction as I am an explosives build. I get along fine with just those in STR and dont feel hampered though.
---
virtual graveyards.
---
sounds pretty RAIDER to me. so im all for it
---
How is dropping a nade upon death or "going down" not supposed to kill you
---
If it makes you feel better I bought preordered and bought brink on launch
---
The elder scrolls foretold us of th... wrong series nevermind.
---
Which will be gone when he uses a Radaway.  
---
There’s little point in mutations until you can get starched genes, other than a temporary play thing.
---
10% Tax so in order to compensate, you would have to do Desired Value (x) times 10 and divide that result by 9. DO NOT MULTIPLY BY 110%/1.1 AS THAT IS INCORRECT MATH.
---
XB1, and yourself???
---
You can also get 90% (guesstimating) from event rewards.  I have sold multiple stimpack recipes in the past for 350 caps.  Keep farming those events or you may come across a high level with one for sale.
---
You must be new...
---
Sell to vendors daily for 1400 each day. Do events that pop up. 
---
Yes that recipe is over 1k, but 1k is nothing. It allows you to make stimpacks, something that gives health. Pretty good trade off. Oh you'll have to farm those materials too. Welcome to Fallout.
---
one started with him falling through ground air over and over. that bug can be forced by logging in at the exact same time as a friend standing in the same location at the same time. it has happened to me before on accident . once. in 1000 hours. i logged in started falling through the earth looked it up and yeah I had logged out at the whitespring train station and logged back in later exactly when someone else (who ?? no idea it wasnt a prearranged event.)  its a bug it needs to be fixed if they haven't already. but the odds of logging in at a spawn point and getting that specific bug are nuts. and it wasn't just one yter getting it multiple  did. that hints to me they were setting it up in advance specifically so they could say " holy crap what is this!!" in an overly dramatic voice. I cant say the criticism wasn't deserved but the shear amount of toxic hate piled onto it was excessive and I suspect partially faked. I think they looked up bugs in advance specifically to give them footage and ammo for piling on more hate.
---
This is a great idea. I only figured out the point of paper bags after I died for the first time.
---
I’ve bought a couple books four or five times and gifted them to friends because I loved them so much. Similar sentiment here
---
Plenty of things sell for more than that. Straight jackets, ranger outfits, marine tactical helmets, assault rifles, etc sell for 30+ caps even with low charisma. I don't know what level you are, but at the very least you can scavenge junk and sell it. Screws, springs, ballistic fiber, and other stuff like that will always fetch you some decent caps at a vending machine, too; players always need more of them for crafting and repairs. Selling diluted drugs, spare chems/stimpaks, etc also provides good money. Calmex is pretty rare but very valuable
---
I went from 22k caps and noticed I was at 25k for the first time ever the other day. Tempted to buy a serum recipe and craft serums to make extra caps, but also dont want to risk spending so much since BR will be gone soon and I'm not able to hop on every day
---
Damn. Ps4 and pc lol
---
You can start with the free terminal in the atom store but 2 of the three "quests" are just about the legendary vendor. 
---
Then you can go to the train stations and check out the posters on the notice board. 
---
There might be a note there as Well.
---
Was this guy's CAMP right by Vault 76? I think I saw this too.
---
I knew that but I didn't really care. Besides he looked like he was having the time of his life running around in circles with it
---
When you’re lower levels (10ish), it’s super helpful to farm the crap out of scorched spawns (they go down easy and usually have decent weapons for you to pull). Places like Poseidon energy plant near Charleston down south and Morgantown airport up north are helpful. Clear out all these scorched, take their weapons/ammo, scrap to learn mods or sell to vendors (there are train stations right outside each of these spots). If you pick Poseidon, there’s also a guaranteed monster spawn in the washed out area nearby.
---
Build up weapons, ammo, caps, and hopefully meds along the way. Clear an area, switch servers, rinse repeat. You could also take nearby workshops if you want camp plans from those defend events.  It’s helpful in this game to do some side work to build up your stash. Good luck out there, and before you know it you’ll be swimming in so many meds you’ll end up selling them just to make caps :)
---
 The sad thing is that I can see the potential there -- the suits are unique and fun to play with, the story, while not as good as most Bioware games, is far better than most looter shooters, and the lore wad up to Bioware standards. I legit enjoyed most of my initial trek of going through the base game. 
---
The problem was  once you did finish and started the endgame grind, you figured out just how empty the game really is, how the loot just isn't there, and the activities just got boring after a while. 
---
I was hoping that once it released, maybe they could turn it around like BGS had started to with 76, but their big Cataclysm update definitely isn't inspiring confidence.
---
How you gonna try be stealthy with a gatling? That's a bad weapon for pvp. Smh
---
If anything it requires more skill than the base game. You have to adapt, use what you find, and learn different playstyles based on what you pick up. You can't just rely on your sent/ass legacy explosive laser crutches to carry you.
---
This bug cost my team the match of Nuclear Winter. Sondava bitch!
---
What console ?? /PC
---
 That's a different studio, Zenimax Online Studio or something like that.
---
Pc?
---
Yes.
---
What do you mean by blocker? Sorry I'm extremely new to F76. Lol.
---
ARRIVADERCI
---
I don't play from a sofa, moron.
---
11,000 caps
---
No shit! Really? /eyeroll
---
I’m level 12 and I would discourage anyone from following me. I dunno what the fuck I’m doing.
---
Not my fault the game doesn't know how to autosave.
---
Same thing just happened to me. MAX camp budget all of sudden. I always have around 20% free camp budget just in case there are something cool in the future atom shop. And I haven't bought any CAMP related objects / plan to put into my camp for the past couple months.
---
After today I can't even attach a new wire to a broken turret.... so I decided to scrap all my CAMP and rebuild it at the same spot.
---
The weird thing is that after I finished rebuilding the CAMP it has 20% free camp budget again... so I don't know what happened that caused my CAMP budget exceeded the max budget by itself?
---
Kind of a weird spot, because Zenimax owns Bethesda
---
I have left. Three times.
---
Launched a nuke today lol. Good luck on finding one for yourself
---
Fallout 3 is 200 years later in another part of the world. I'm sure fish would be fine in this lush environment.
---
Yep
---
Too bad it's not on PC
---
K 🤣
---
Thanks! I just did that and played to level 3-4 again and took a break just now. I like the game so far (kinda, it's better than FO4 so far..) but let's hope it sticks!
---
I would love to find more people to group with! FYI I am a total scrub in Nuclear Winter right now lol. whats your at name in game?
---
Damn indeed. I *am* going to get a PS4 at the end of the month, but I don't see myself buying again and starting anew. If only crossplay were to be added......
---
Yeah, three times. But hey just reinstalled and fourth try. This is my final try but if it loads up fine later tonight then I'll be happy and maybe it'll stick this time.
---
Fallout 2
---
Tbf it is a pre beta
---
Can you please provide details? How is it better?

getting to capstash daily is easy once you get a few tricks up you sleeve. I wrote this guide to help out this often explained process. enjoy.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bw6ump/the\_way\_of\_the\_green\_thumb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bw6ump/the_way_of_the_green_thumb/)

You aren't being dumb, I have no idea why it isn't working for you.
---
If only.... It's too bad cause it's half off right now too. I actually finally just bought it this week
---
Good question. I hope so.
---
That was really chaotic to watch but that one dude had 19 kills!!! I’m stoked if I get 5!
---
I literally couldn't get 30 seconds in, and based on the comments of the video it's probably just shit talking 76 and Todd the entire time. 
---
I don't give a damn about the politics surrounding the game, it's in a great spot right now and getting better, and this free week is making a lot of people aware of that.
---
There should be a slug mod that upgrades damage and distance.
---
I wonder how much money he drops on a mod tool that's able to do all that shit lmao
---
I'd say stand 20 feet away from a shotgun blast and let me know how you feel about it after, but then I'd get banned for saying you should die.
---
Pick up 1024 pieces of small junk and sell it all for 1 cap each.
---
Yes but I'm not sure in the same way. 
---
On another play through when I come back from playing a different character my quest, in this case seeker of mysteries, keeps forgetting I listened to the tape not to mention already got the mission from Kryptos
---
I dont have sent assassin or a  laser crutch. You have to adapt more in survival or youll get your butt kicked. Theres a lot of different builds and styles people can use. But i see what your saying from your viewpoint. Ive just played a ton of survival maybe has been a different experience
---
One little question. How did they change the endgame? I'm not quite that far but i heard some complaints about it.
---
Can confirm. Also can confirm that the barrel not firing and getting meleed by a radroach was the cause of at least ONE of my deaths
---
I’m having a lot of fun right now. Anyone on PS4 who needs a friend to dwell with shoot me a PM and we’ll link up.
---
-3123
---
Doing Atom's work. I didn't even notice it.
---
Keep on keeping, people. 76 is evidence. Masterpieces can be made from determination.
---
Xbox? PS4?
---
That’s so nice of you. I might have to take you up on that offer.
---
The other day I got a "super mutant head" and put it in my machine for 10k alongside my "snallygaster spit explosion."
---
Lol I couldn’t see him punch you but is that what that sound was!!?? If so machine gun punching? Wtf that’s messed up
---
Heard a guy in my team last night saying he was hacking and he knew where players were. Didn't believe him at first then he started giving specific spots where players were and low and behold they were. Not a proud win but I did report his PSN. Hopefully this doesn't become a huge negative to a really awesome mode
---
I haven't played the game at all recently. I'm impressed by your guys dedication to this game though. Making a game like this that would guarantee to be controversial from the get-go, and sticking with it for this long with the kind of support I've been seeing is a great achievement in my eyes. I'm definitely picking this game up again on PC when it comes to Steam, which is hopefully soon.
---
dm for discord link
---
That's ok, about 50% of my deaths are caused by me shooting explosive ammo at my feet .. :/
---
they are also good if you have a nuke ready to go!
---
whoops sent you the guide that included going to the farm for all the corn lol didnt catch the last part. as high level I just hit up that farm then west tek and then prime fissure. that's generally enough to cap me out in weapons and food right there. don't think you're up for that just yet judging by your post. 
---
  the stimpack recipe is well worth the cost. you can get blood from the ticks in moonshiner shack and the lumbermill early on and have an easy source of income and more healing early on that way.  patience padawan.
---
Counter counter point: the new kids can't afford them, so they still sit there.
---
My ones work just fine.
---
Fortnite only became a primarily BR game because it was a massive success. I doubt I could say the same for this game, it will primarily be a survival game always.
---
Had it kinda happen with a grognak axe, on a feral ghoul it was almost dead but it took another 2 swings to kill it
---
my laser gat seems ok.
---
They can be used everywhere!
---
Nice!
---
there was a brand new windos update try updating and see if it still glitches out. that was causing me lag about 15 minutes ago it might be running in the background Fn shit up for you.
---
Meh the dialogue was pretty atrocious. It needed something akin to the [Sovereign conversation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvrIFIjTGt0)
---
Same guy one shot my entire team instantly, and then watched him levitate all the way up to the bridge...and then few matches later i was on his team. No mic but got a 12 minute video of the match where i think he wiped out the entire server on his own, also several of the loot boxes were over stuffed with goodies. i had over 1000 5 mil rounds by the end of it. The ammo appeared to be respawning as i fired it. Also first time ive seen a shredding minigun in NW.

As in GT or name? I haven't seen the name come up outside of the character creator screen and the occasional Mr Handy who says my name.
---
I've used a real shotgun before, they still have a minute amount of range, you can't give it to much range or people will have a fit like people did for the combat shotgun in fortnite
---
It already does.  The camp &amp; skin rewards you can use immediately in adventure mode.
---
It depends on the creature. Some require one or the other, and a couple (I think death laws and mlk's) require both perks maxed out in order to have a decent chance of taming.
---
In curious when that will be. I haven’t seen a release timeframe yet. I enjoy playing it i hope we dont have to go too long before its a permanent part of the game.
---
How does someone get killed by 2 swipes of a sword!?
---
I did not have high hopes for nuclear winter or 76 as a whole after launch. What ive seen done to this game has been astounding. I have had many hours of fun with many more to come. Keep it up!
---
It did. I was there. Saw it with my own two eyes.  He hits me. Procs. His buddy behind me is then able to hit me.
---
I don't get paid, over 800 hours in. The game is fun.  If you don't like it, that's fine, but to insinuate people only play if they're getting paid is ridiculous.
---
Glad to help!
---
NW dailies have been disabled for the time being. Presumably due to a bug.
---
Separate.
---
I too would like to know. As someone who played at launch, dumped it, then came back a few months later, I haven't noticed any real changes beyond some bug fixes.
---
Small side note:  Mini Deathclaw Statue is also 20% off if anyone is interested in that.
---
Thanks!
---
atomic shop
---
This comes as a bundle deal when you buy the E3 atom bundle.  To find it, go to the Atom Shop and press the button to buy atom.  It'll be there.
---
I've been shooting guns for over 30 years. A shotgun in real life is going to do at least decent damage 20 feet away.
---
Have it playing nonstop in nuclear winter
---
You'll get loot, but not xp if all you do is sit back
---
I took a new character from level 1-60+ entirely in survival. Encounters with other players are a one shot shit fest that comes down to who has the best meta setup or gets a sneak kill.
---
NW is a much more visceral, yet balanced, experience. Find an M79? Whelp, guess you're a heavy gunner until you find something else. Find a scoped combat rifle? OK, you get to be a sniper for a few minutes.
---
Eliminating the OP builds has done a tremendous job of making it more about skill and map knowledge than having the best gear.
---
You know, all of them will be whores.
---
Nothing like being the 873rd person to be dating some radworm addled farmer.  Bet it's like throwing a hot dog down a hallway.
---
Well now I gotta find one of those!!
---
Oh really? Any idea if it’s gonna be realized separately?
---
I mean, there's some bad dialogue in ME1 as well. And when yucky really think about it, Sovereign as a villain really isn't much -- he talks good trash, but that's about it. I would put Saren, the Illusive Man, and even the Archon over Sovereign.
---
My girlfriend made a Facebook post shaming me  about how I raged and insulted Bethesda during E3 for announcing Fallout BR, then spent the next 4 hours playing it.
---
If you're playing in a group it's solid, no need to alter anything.
---
If you're using weightless armour with weapon reduction, that could the issue. You'll need to log out and log in again.
---
You can still drop nukes in other places and have them mostly to yourself, but it is a very bad time to try killing the queen.
---
My vats build breaks face real fast and as a bonus, my armor takes little to no damage so repairs are extremely low
---
I’ll add you now, right on man!
---
I saw that! I plan to download it tomorrow after work! Thanks for the heads up :)
---
Damn that’s a crazy deal!
---
I just have regular scout armor
---
I'm just trying it now. It's half off right now on PC too, so if you do end up liking it, now's also a solid time to buy it.
---
I find first levels most interesting tho, like real survival, and dont forget essential recipes you get from starting quests
---
Thats a good idea tbh.. imma gonna have to try that thank you
---
You can blueprint a bunker in adventure and use it in NW.  Make sure it's not too big or it won't place right.
---
Nah dead is dead, thats the whole point of abattle royal
---
It would be cool if we could revive them with some kind of rad juice that turns them into feral ghoul. Low hp, fast and melee only.
---
There are oddly a lot of good endurance perks in NW, and little to none in adventure. Its strange.
---
Me too, it's happened twice
---
Thats mostly just on this sub. I think the game has been tarnished too far for a lot of people to give it a chance anymore.
---
Did you have wwr? If so could be that.
---
The grind is tough currently at lvl 25 and the xp needed to get to the next level is starting to really get hard
---
I think I had 10 STR 2 AGI 2 LUK
---
Serrated Machete. Also have 2 unyielding pieces. From the look of it, it triggered for the third hit when the Gatling laser dropped me to half. The first hit lagged out when processing the video. 
---
Idk tho but you can totally murder high levels easily with melee.
---
Wwr?
---
Yea but the problem is they charged $60 for people to test their game out for them.
---
It’s not pvp people are against. It’s griefing noobs simply for the sake of it. That’s a dick move.
---
Nuclear winter is good fun. Loving the it. The one rough part is the load times back in. getting kicked back out of the whole thing and having to pick the mode again plus the large wait to get into the spawn selection adds up. End up getting distracted and posting on reddit about load times Kappa.
---
Might be just for the XO1 since that’s what it is but I’m sure it’s for all of them. Probably won’t see too many the grind is real
---
Weapon weight reduction perks, on any of the pieces of armour
---
Any idea as to when we can expect a roadmap for nuclear winter like we got for wild Appalachia, I’m really loving nuclear winter when can we expect it to return?
---
They really have fixed a lot of things and added a lot of great content. Still has hiccups no doubt, but man is it fun. Nuclear Winter is the only BR I’ve ever played and enjoyed. I could see myself playing this game for a long time. I’ve been playing since December and it’s just gradually become more and more stable and smooth. The fact that DLCs are free/included and human NPCs are coming in the fall just has me pumped. They’ve done a really good job despite the hate bandwagon.
---
I started making a base that sits on 1 floor square. I used the floor that's first on the drop-down list. It has pillars on the bottom. Is that okay? Nor sure what you mean by a flat bottomed base.
---
Probably not.
---
I get downvoted without mentioning griefing. Although i like it because of the whole lawless wasteland thing i think griefing has more of a place in survival especially now that camp vending has been implemented. 
---
Plus most of the people ive spoken to on here and in game are all against pvp in general
---
The fact that you think the "hate" was a conspiracy (without irony) says more about you then either the state of the game on release OR the people who reviewed it.
---
Nope it's not legendary
---
Bless.
---
I got a little emotional reading this. It's easy to forget these are real people and the nice people in this community made their day. Fallout is unlike any other.
---
Cries in Sickle &amp; Hammer
---
It's a perk under Strength, reduces melee damage by 15/30/45%. Normally you can avoid melee damage with a ranged build with a combination of Speed Demon, Marsupial and terrain kiting, but in a queen fight the mobs come at you from all sides so you're going to get bitten. Some players like to sit on top of the fence at Drop Site V9 instead, but that confuses the queen when it's trying to find a landing spot.
---
That's still about $15-20 more than what I'd want to spend on it for the 3rd time of purchasing it
---
So I'm not allowed to suggest anything?
---
Hard to say, but I did 100% find a hacker right now, sent a report hopefully it'll get taken care of soon.
---
Turn on pacifist so that doesn't happen next time.
---
There is a text chat mod for PC on the nexus that a fair number of us are utilizing, consoles can message people directly last I checked.
---
In main menu u go to social, invite ur buddies and play together :)
---
Yeah, I feel it lol. I actually got mine used at gamestop for 20 bucks
---
Go to the Morgantown train station kill all the scorched there and take their weapons and head on over to the airport kill the scorched there and do the event that spawns the cargobot for more guns to grab and sell them all to the vender at Morgan town train station make sure you have hard bargain at lvl 3 and take a grape mentat a charisma bobblehead if you have it you might get like 30 to 50 caps per gun maybe less but it adds up and just server hop and do it all again till you cash out the vender
---
Lmao that's part of the game pal, the PvP in adventure sucks
---
Hammer or sickle?
---
Holster weapon you should be good. Heavy weapons sometimes mess up
---
Yeah, that's why they won't do text chat. People won't be as likely to buy emotes if they can use text.
---
Daily nw challenges are broken right now
---
Didn't work for me either
---
I played the beta and the first thing I did was run as far as I could to get away from everyone else so I could do my thing happily solo. I discovered this amazing location, so very green and full of friendly robots and cool stuff and for a little while it was mine alone to explore and marvel at! Now, of course, the Whitesprings is usually pretty busy and often nuked but I’ll never forget seeing those greens and ghouls for the first time and being wary of all the white robots lol. Id love to experience that again.
---
Thank you for your awesome input, will translate and forward your comment to the artist!
---
I use a tse handmade but weapon being drawn probably has something to do with it
---
Sadly as someone who is lvl 21 in NW 99% of the locked off areas are dead ends with not a lot to offer. Obviously haven't been able to access the lvl 101 grid in the overseer's office yet but I doubt there will be much behind that area either. Leveling is more about the lore and rewards tham ang exploration of the vault. At least so far.
---
Not only that, we will have less laggy pings, too!
---
Thank you for your awesome input, will translate and forward your comment to the artist!  
---
Will defiantly let the artist know see if it's a possible thing to do!
---
Me, with my fishing pole hooked onto a ghoul’s head next to a lake: I’m about to do what’s called a pro gamer move
---
Yesterday's worked for me. Place your C.A.M.P.; I definitely got that one without problems.
---
Become a junk merchant. Focus on crafting and selling what high level players with tons of caps need. Get some excavator armor and and farm lead from the lucky hole mine and set up a workshop at hemlock holes to farm acid while you are mining. When you need a break or get bored go to Morgantown airport And do the collision course event which gives you like 100-200 pre war money which can be scrapped for cloth. Boom, now you have metric shitloads of lead ore, acid, and cloth which can be used to make both lead scraps and gunpowder. All you need to do is scrap some low level weapons to get a barge load of steel and you have all the components to craft any kind of ammo you want. .50 cal and 5mm both can be crafted in huge quantities and you can easily craft 3000-5000 of each from a single days worth of play. Don’t be greedy and sell them for anything but one cap each and sooner or later, the right player will come along and clean you out. Suddenly, you will find yourself with 3000-5000 caps. 
---
Phase two. Don’t blow it all at once. Re invest in your store. Now that you have caps up front, you don’t have to farm. Just go around to all the vendors and start buying all the steel, gunpowder and lead you find. Even if you buy it in bulk at full retail from NPC vendors, the materials to craft 1000 rounds of either 50 cal or 5mm will cost you about 500-600 caps, but if you sell those 1000 rounds for 1 caps each you will profit from 400-500 caps from the venture. 
---
Now that you’re comfortable with that, just work it into your routine to go buy supplies, craft ammo, and stock store and before you know it you will be hitting the 25k cap limit. For bonus caps, watch player vendors selling anything for less than the NPC vendors will sell. For example, if someone is selling serums for less than 450 caps, buy it and just go sell it to the NPCs. Same for some scrap like crystal or lead. If the NPCs will pay two caps for it and the player is selling it for 1, fuck it, buy it and to sell it to the NPCs and you’ve doubled your money.
---
Apex let's you revive.
---
THAT pic is also my favorite, really hoping everyone who plays fallout games see this artwork!
---
Not only that, I really like the way that the artist express it, clean and simple and gives you a smile when seeing it!
---
You on PS4?
---
Did you at least downvote his video? Takes less then 30secs and he currently has 25k likes and less then 900 dislikes, its more likes then this post.
---
I can't tell you, i wasn't in adventure since NW update. :D i need the biggest rank i can achieve :D
---
Depends one what you have I usually play support and have been able to kill the sbq consistently with random players. I usually have a cryolator for the first half and 2 shotguns for the second half, perks are tormentor and enforcer, tenderizer, suppressor and fireproof.  My power armor is reactive so i can ignore small nucences. You ain't doing much damage but your keeping the SBQ grounded, slow and weak.  Somti
---
Oh snap! I got the same email from UPS coming from Technicolor HES SE LLC. I think we’re finally getting our bags! 😁
---
big boi hermit crab comin at ya with the back half of a bus
---
LMFAO
---
You have to go into adventure mode and craft it. Then go to the Atom shop and favourite it for NW selection. Annoying, I know.
---
I mean yeah, but they've also fixed a huge number of bugs in FO76. The state of the game now kinda demonstrates that!
---
u/BethesdaGameStudios_ could you give us more details about nuclear winter like you did with wild appalachia
---
You're not helping. &gt;:(
---
The weird thing about Taiwanese people are... we feel SUPER awkward when hearing people speaking Chinese (yup most of us don't even know what a Mandarin is, we call it Chinese.), most of us are more comfortable speaking in English or Japanese when it comes to communicating with non-Taiwanese players.
---
There can only be one overseer!
---
*WHACK*
---
No I’m on console I hear these story’s for every BR and never encounter it on console
---
Yeah they mentioned it on Bethesda forums someone posted about it last night.
---
I’m definitely that bad in br, but I resort to hiding instead.
---
If you were in power armor or a radiation suit you dont take rads
---
ULTRACITE?!
---
Seems tedious, but thank you!
---
I personally met one in-game when I did trading before, that dude sold me one super sick sledge hammer (vamp+swing+weight reduction) and told me to come back when I have more caps, says he got my back LOL
---
Ha I like it
---
I go to the Steakhouse backyard. It's also got other plants.
---
Cool. Die mad about it.
---
Nazis we're developing Sonic boom weaponry to knock aircraft out of the sky, such a device could've been built by brotherhood or enclave scientists and used against the scorchbeasts of Appalachia
---
Do we know if hellfire power armor is available in nuclear winter yet?
---
You don’t have to craft it, just favourite it from the Atom Shop
---
Have you ever heard the phrase “get gud”
---
Find one of the monuments and server hop for about 30 minutes until one spawns
---
Seems like all you have to do is favorite it, no crafting needed
---
It already takes seconds to cripple their wings.
---
Cool, complain when your house gets obliterated
---
Damn, that's still really the only way???
---
YES PLEASE!
---
And please share me the link when you have actually done it, I want the artist to be soooo happy and cannot sleep for tonight!!
---
I will also encourage more of the artists to share because I know a few of them are playing Fallout 76 or Fallout 4.
---
Bugger. I went through that for nothing.
---
Yes sir! With or without nuts?
---
Oh man back when it was still a lower level area and you could find all the holotapes and golfers. Now it’s a blood bath. Simpler times
---
Who wants to tell him??
---
Yup, that's exactly what its for. Just recieved the same email about 10min ago
---
This sub is great! I’ve just been constantly laughing for the last 20 minutes. Thanks for that.
---
how about "Draconic Vocal Chords" Throw a grenade when not using any to scream at enemies - 60 second cool-down,  unable to eat during cool-down
---
Just south of Morgantown, near a grain silo. Most people remember the airport but forget that unmarked farm. Lots of corn and razorgrain
---
Plot twist
---
**It’s a Trap** event
---
Too bad they can’t be used on Queen
---
he did, didn't he. damn
---
I love how they are pulling a No Mans Sky 2 basically, not ditching the game, but working on it
---
Far as I know, unless you want to search all the possible areas in the server, which is also no guarantee to spawn
---
if you want to use a cosmetic in NW you must favorite it in the Atom shop, doing so will replace the skins when you use that weapon/gear
---
Hi there! I'm Destiny from Rely on Horror and I'd be interested in tagging along for an episode if you'd like.
---
That is a genius idea I never thought of that 
---
This will really help cuz want to do a heavy gunner build so thank you
---
Geez, what an incredibly counterintuitive process
---
My immersion will not be completed until I get AIDS.
---
If it was going to be a fucking tasty ass burger, sure!
---
&gt;Companion NPCs will be able to live in your C.A.M.P., while also offering you quests. 
---
I fainted.
---
Helllls yes!  I was just saying to someone this morning I wonder when its going to come.
---
Do you have a link to the video? This looks nuts! Also, I’ve only seen one person get the mini gun. Also saw one with auto grenade launcher and I got a Tesla rifle off the scorchbeast today for the first time.
---
Agreed, ive done it that way twice now
---
2k is a pittance, no offense to anyone, I've had close to a million rounds of 5mm more than once,'because I'm a melee build, loot everything and dump it on mules..  
---
If someone gives you 20k, or 100k, that's different..
---
I doubt it’ll happen. Die mad about it troll.
---
I've got a feeling some of my weekend will be spent on something like that :)
---
Thank you for this amazing game! I was originally pretty hyped for it but discounted it after all the bad reviews. But that free week you guys are doing and the spot at e3 for it was an extremely smart move, there were so many new people playing and everyone I met was just as in love with the game as me. You guys should feel 120% validated after all of this.
---
Are you talking about nuclear winter mode?
---
Check railroad vendors. They have more than Whitesprings.
---
That's not how you spell Ada.
---
Yaaah.... Only 7 months after we should have originally gotten it... Fuck Bethesda...
---
Hardly seems worth doing it even once lol
---
they arent sold by vendors i checked al of them :(
---
WiFi or old ps4 ?
---
But camera tho
---
#fishing will come for wastelanders update
---
Way to be 13
---
I’d you look at the icon for wastelanders on the road map it has what look like a mr handy/sentry bot hybrid and says new features, so that could be coming in fall with the human npc’s!
---
Top of the world has a bunch of raider plans
---
Been playing since beta and I never experienced a 15 minute load time. Are you sure it didn't just freeze at the loading screen?
---
while i agree with you if you are a PURE melee character you still have to wait for them to land
---
*Hello Buddy*
---
I think they should keep survival like it is but just block legendary effects from being active while in survival. Keep the ability to earn legendaries for adventure mode on survival but, while on survival, have all legendary effects turned off.
---
excellent point
---
i know but im looking for the plans to craft the armor itself not modifications for it
---
thanks for the comment :)
---
just wanted you to know you were my last reddit chuckle before hitting the hay ; )
---
Consoles can text. PC can mod (does not work with NW)
---
thanks. my friend was losing his mind thinking how much he wanted the skyrim throwback
---
I have pacifist becuase I run a quad Tesla and it hits people on accident all the time. I have plague, electrical charge, and irradiated and it procs all the time and does other people but it dosen't put me into PVP, only time it does is if I'm using my reactive armor which many times it just out right kills the other players.
---
Yeah it's 10 bucks, comes with 1500 atoms too.
---
I actually play in third person because that gets me less sick. However, I feel like when shooting enemies it’s less accurate. When playing FO4 I often just scroll in and out of the view.
---
That's quite nice. Back in my GTAO days, most Arabs were assholes that didn't think twice about shooting in the face. Also I'm Arabian.
---
 This sounds a bit racist.
---
Tom Howard's response is well put tho, he and his team was only partly involved in the creation of the game and wasn't the one overseeing the production, he took the full blow of the criticism even tho it was bethesda studio austin not Montreal and even then when he was involved there is a doc of him saying he was very hands on the project. Imo the biggest problem was that it wasn't mainly handled by the A team which if it was probably would have launched in a much better state
---
Yup eventually the music starts to play and and all load In eventually
---
Sadly that's not the case.
---
If i can make somebody smile, I’m doing it right. :)
---
Maybe Human NPCs can't follow you but if you remember the roadmap, there is a "badge" with the vault boy standing next to a sentry bot.
---
 Let"s hope this means robots building and by extention having these  ones as companions. (which i personally prefer)
---
I live in Iowa. UPS Tracking says to expect mine on Tuesday June 18th.
---
Ethernet cable  download speed 94 mbps and upload 10 mbps and on a ps4 that’s maybe 2 years old. My brothers works great and loads in super quick and his is WiFi with a much older ps4
---
True
---
Nah, XBox.
---
Or they can have a shielded jumpsuit
---
I understand the ban for legendary items, but simple stuff like ammo shouldn't get anyone to be banned except the duper.
---
Looking forward to seeing the results!
---
I totally think it’s less accurate in third person as well, but I always play in first anyway. That’s wild that it’s better for you in third, I figured that was the one you were bothered by.
---
I always feel like you need to be close to the end to use it. That might not be the case but every time I drop something I just end up running away to stay in the ring.
---
That would be so cool in fallout 76 MAN I LOVED LIBERTY PRIME
---
Same! I'm rank 29 but like I need to get higher lol
---
How are is handmade?
---
Never been disappointed. Thank you.
---
Really excited for TES VI and Starfield.
---
I happen to be a melee build. I use a crippling shotgun to bring it down. Sometimes I can melee them with marsupial also.
---
purchase the plans, make them, scrap them.
---
Using Unyielding set
---
Just got the same email about 30 minutes ago.  Says mine comes in this Saturday. I was trying to figure out what it is,  says it weights "1lb"
---
Nah it's patched
---
Why is the shotgun called NO STIMS V3?
---
Can you make one for terminals and locked containers?
---
It was when u launched all 3 nukes at once but they patched it
---
Just got the same email about 30 minutes ago. Says mine comes in this Saturday. I was trying to figure out what it is, says it weights "1lb"
---
I suppose NPCs will still be few and far between at least at the start. Don't expect to have Diamond city population everywhere.
---
You forgot the r in rare.
---
Fastest need a higher level friend to let you piggy back his kills.
---
How long does Ballistic Bock last?
---
If you can give them outfits and weapons like fallout settlers that will be a good start.
---
Yep tired of not being able finding my stuff or searching carefully to find it.
---
*Nick Valentine.
---
I vaguely remember grafton having metal armor plans. For the raider armor your best bet is toxic valley treasure maps
---
Thanks for not giving up on the game. This game has a very dedicated community for sure.
---
He's thirsty!
---
did you find a vendor that has it?
---
Being able to doesn't mean you have to.
---
Pretty sure they're only adding the Battle Royale mode as like a buffer so they can work on other stuff.
---
I have never worked for Bethesda, but I imagine that the *"What's our release date going to be?"* conversation involved more decision-makers than just Todd Howard.
---
This tip doesn't help unless youre swimming in caps
---
Okay but doesnt answer my question
---
Has to be the bag
---
I picked up a digital copy on eBay because I’m sick of always having to hand my disc in there
---
Am just wondering why is it called NO STIMS V3??
---
Hi sick of always having to hand my disc in there, I'm dad.
---
Worth maybe around 2k.
---
Never seen that bot before
---
Says 5 minutes.. I use it all the time but it does break the gun fast [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ballistic\_Bock](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ballistic_Bock)
---
Wtf lol this is the same exact dude that was hacking in 2 of my recent games
---
Report back and let us know how much ass she kicks.
---
Yea I'm way over loaded I usually carry 100 plus stims radaway and double that amount diluted all the time but alot of my perks are weight reducing
---
Dude its you! Lol, you tried to do this to a lvl 9 friend 2 days ago and I was behind you and smoked you! How come you didn't show that video?
---
Lol, only want to show the videos you don't die! Coward!
---
Handmade made by hand they is.
---
jeez Louis u on xbox i’ll buy it for u bb
---
I never carry stimpacks on me.
---
Thanks for psa
---
Bro fuck this mode. Armour is ridiculous in this game lmao. 2 headshots with a sniper doing 180+ each and my dude had 40% hp still. I then die to his fully auto grenade launcher.
---
PVE is actually decent though. Better than when I tried it a 6 months ago
---
Oh my god, what a fucking nerd :D Jk good job mate. I'm only rank 14. We somehow can't win with squad we was easily winin in apex, so it take long :D
---
Comments in this comment section are the equivalent of talking shit about someone behind their back but being friendly to their face
---
Where was this?
---
u can make them in Adventure but u cant trade/sell
---
Wait, did it work? Or was it just on your face? I wondered this too.
---
Would Party Boy/Girl effect it?
---
let me see if i still have a youtube account and ill upload it
---
 My bad i dont play nonstop and have tons or caps or glitched by in the day dude. 
---
Declining your offer
---
Basically the whole robot set plans and the metal arms and torso plans (if you have them)
---
Yeah I’m not sure why. I think maybe it might be due to when I play I focus on my character moving around and my character being steady when playing while the background moves? In first person, it feels like I’m getting motion sickness like I’m spinning around maybe cause I’m seeing it from the character’s perspective. But not really sure why.
---
The reason your stash went up super high in weight is because you need to scrap your items before you put them in your stash and you do that by just going to any workstation and there should be a prompt for it.
---
Making around 10k per day. Farm the 1400 vendor caps every day, and invest into player vending. Fort Defiance is best farm spot
---
Wait when did they promise to never ad NPCs?
---
Could I squeeze in 3k?
---
They're not going to abandon Adventure mode...just look what wastelanders is bringing! NPCS with dialog trees, something I honestly didn't think was going to happen no matter how much the community called for it but Bethesda surprised the rads right out of me!
---
First cheater comment I've seen with actual proof. I am curious how someone thinks that is fun though.
---
I get molested every time lol
---
I got one too but I couldn't get it to appear in my camp build screen back in Adventure Mode
---
Same day here in NJ!
---
Probably not a good idea in nw. Get all the bobbleheads and magazines, they help a lot. Perks that increase damage too. I just won one with random team, had big guns bobblehead was hitting 130 a shot with the gatlin

There was a story in Fallout 4 about a dude that pretended to ride a motorcycle and make motorcycle noises.
---
Maybe they can bring that back?
---
Interesting
---
It doesn't for some reason. It works with regular booze though
---
What are your special stats? I have low endurance on my main lvl 50+ and feel like other characters have twice the health as me
---
Weird, I run it one two different PCs at home (main computer and mule account on work laptop) and sometimes play on girlfriends computer at her place. Never had a similar problem, so hard to say what it could be. Firewall or similar would have been my primary guess, or possibly a router setting. 
---
Really weird, I hope you get it sorted.
---
Hmmmmmm.... 7/10. Chuckled.
---
Oh man i would love like a big ridiculous coach purse or a real nice clutch.
---
So that’s how people have hit level 30 in 48 hours lmao
---
The first one you get is just a profile picture :(
---
i play 4 hours per day, maybe 6 on the weekends. i can help a broke bitch it’s cool
---
Because the base weapon is considered semi auto which is why the rifleman perks work with it changing the receiver to automatic won't change the perk usage to commando as the base weapon was originally a single shot
---
Good old Oliver Twist.
---
I have some heads if you want some
---
You really let negative feedback “hurt” you and prevent you from trying the game? ... ...... .. its a video game. Wow.
---
Not working for me either. I was able to do yesterday’s challenge about 30x and got tons of perk cards. Now this one doesn’t work at all. Gotta love 76
---
There could be a few survivors left who ran off then returned, recruiting new settlers who came into Appalachia.
---
i’ll even throw in a slice of pie for ya boy
---
Yeah I went through and looked over it. It there was a shitload of aid items that weighed like 1 each,
---
I have a 1060 3gb, i5-8400 8gb ddr4 ram. 
---
Nothing beefy, but it gets the job done for a lot of my gaming needs, and I don't mind low settings.
---
Has performance increased for meh pc's like mine?
---
They're extremely rare, I've gotten maybe at max 10 dropped including legendary.
---
Seriously man, the plan is the way to go. Or see if somebody can mod it for you &amp; give it back.
---
The more the merrier.
---
Eh, I mean a lot of people died who liked fallout, we don't need to make the game a graveyard for dead fans.
---
I wanna romance with rose but yeah human will be nice tho
---
Youre immature lvl is over 9000, sad
---
If someone really wants it, but it's honestly very easy to get instigating as a 1* for a couple hundred caps. If it had 40% power attack it would sell fast for 2-3k.
---
Happy to hear it :) it really is an awesome game, and with all the stability and balance fixes, new modes and quests it's only gotten better
---
With NPCs coming in autumn I'm hoping we get a big influx of new players between now and then
---
If you combine it with field surgeon it's totally worth it. If you're trying to keep your health in the sweet spot between 10-19%, you're only getting half the benefit of a diluted stim, so the penalty is basically irrelevant. Field surgeon gives you an immediate burst back to "full health" and negates that lag on the second half of the stim, so you are healed instantly.
---
Then, when you're out of combat for 15 seconds you're back at full health again.
---
Haters gonna hate.
---
Just ignore them. These little internet rambos need this. 
---
Better enjoy your time with us! The community

Guess that would be a little OP if it did affect it. How do you get the recipe for it tho?

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76bazaar/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76bazaar/)
---
To be fair a lot of people did, I know like 5 people irl who let the early reviews talk them out of playing
---
\- Class freak is a decent perk point-for-point, just for Adrenal Reaction. Equivalent to about 6% damage reduction per point. Evasive is worth under 2% per point at 300 DR. Generally damage reduction &gt; HP increase &gt; resistance increase for perks.
---
\- If you're only taking one of them, Crit Savvy should be significantly superior to Better Criticals for average damage per shot, especially for a bloodied build where the enemy DR doesn't matter much.
---
\- If you use explosive weapons without Gunsmith then they're likely to break very quickly.
---
Oh ok
---
I said it when they first announced survival mode, "take legendary effects off weapons and armor so it's more balanced for everyone".
---
Then baboomski, that's what they did for Nuclear Winter. Add a similar play style to a survival game mode and I would never touch adventure again.
---
Prove it. Oh wait, we’re on reddit. I forgot you don’t need proof. Haha.
---
The one bit of content everyone was screaming they would ragequit over has given this subreddit its most positive era. I wish people would actually play something before screaming bloody murder.
---

You can, but it will likely be dead air for a Dev response

Guessing it has stock HDD? That's the problem if so.
---
I just started a new character on PS4 (old, v1.0) and the loading times are at least quadruple that of my PC.
---
Yeah classic. Least you caught it
---
Special stats are disabled in NW, Everyone has the same HP.
---
Thank you, it just about made my day.... until someone Gatled my defenseless body while I watched.
---
Multiple thing have been known to fix this bug. I will put them in order of easiest  to do to most annoying.
---
Step 1. On the Bethesda launcher click 'scan and repair' on the game file. 
---
Step 2. Relaunch the game. Repeat. 
---
Step 3. Server change aggressively trying to get the quests to populate.
---
Step 4. Die and choose to respawn at vault 76.
---
Step 5. If nothing else has worked, try to figure out where you last progressed the quest and go back there and trigger it again.
---
Really? Aren't perk cards limited to your Specials??
---
For real? You sure you weren't just getting the non-daily C.A.M.P. challenges too? You sure you're not exaggerating?
---
I’ve managed to find most of the heads just trying to hunt down the unused plans! Thank you so much though for the offer!
---
Most of use are pretty sure it's Automatron for Fallout 87, Automatron being the Fallout 4 DLC where you could build your own robot companions from the parts of the various robots in game.
---
ayo lemme suck that dick ain’t even gay
---
Definitely the bag! You should see your Bethesda ticket number under the "Reference numbers" section (bottom right of UPS page).
---
Lol. Nah. I'm on xbox and got there legit.
---
Mee too. I had to dig around Google before I realized what Technicolor hes is. Maybe this will lift my spirits a bit and entice me to play, as I literally haven't touched 76 since like week 3.
---
Damn I’ve been grinding after work each day and I’m only at 16
---
There's a brewmaster named biv, no plan he gives it to you random in the daily. He's in the tattoo parlor by vault tec univ.
---
I only remember 3 names from fallout 76. My boy Grahm, Chally the moo moo and dick shale
---
This is why I only play single player games on my PC and play online games on console.
---
The buffs are disabled you keep your special numbers so you'll have 15 End, you just won't get any HP from it.
---
Me and the guy I play with win more than we lose. Get about 1000xp per win so we've been leveling really fast.
---
same here just checked my email
---
It's difficult to remember to clip when your screaming profanities as loud as you can.
---
Well that explains it haha I’m only averaging 3-400 per game, good wins around 1k
---
Truly sucks since I was following Fortnite since 2012, then it was canceled and I forgot it for a few years until they said they were going to finish, que me being hyped then disappointed when they said it was going to released in Early Access. Then I read they were going to release it for free later down the line so I never bought, then they announced Battle Royale and I was like "Cool! I can try Fortnite out and see if I like it" then they never continued to work on Save the World.
---
Then Fortnite got a cringy community of 7 year olds just following popular gaming trends to be cool and shit, I completely lost hope.
---
If you log then it stays there for a bit so another player can take a fully built workshop.

You can scrap all the things to get some of it back when you are about to sign off rho.

Cooperating and helping is one of the things I love doing and one of the best and most rewarding parts of forging community and positive experiences in games imho. We need more of that, not less. 
---
That was really sweet and very much appreciated. Thank you. And thank you for sticking with us over all the rocky ups and downs and not giving up on 76. There is so much potential in this game and so many things that we can do with it as a community with the right support and content. That's my dream to see it happen.
---
No need to farm. Buy the cheap as hell legendaries people for some reason sell.
---
The things you built at the workshop stay there unless destroyed. So if someone takes it over they now have control of the workbenches and other things built there. You do not get the materials back.
---
Ah. I just suck then!
---
nice! one last E3 gift from Bethesda (...sort-of...) :)
---
Who's ready for the waifu wars?

How much health do people start with?

Once you get it from him you can make it however much as you want?

Vending changed the game for me. Spend half my time buying/selling.
---
You're level 16 and running around the Savage divide. You didn't be. Go up North towards Grafton or stay in the forest.
---
That’s what I do and check Whitesprings station.
---
Bring Piper back and I will personally slaughter everyone that comes near her.
---
I was doing the main quest
---
They should also add that kid that had cancer who's friends contacted BGS and he was allowed to play Fallout 76 for a day with Todd the Godd and friends.
---
I ignored the reviews and iv loved the game, glitches and all. Now NW is a blast and il play it even more. Hope others find the same fun iv had with the game.
---
Side quests exist for a reason.
---
I got this. Glad to see others basically confirm that it's the canvas bag. But the package is going to my old address, and UPS is going to charge me $8.50 to deliver to my new address RIP
---
Some of the things you're saying are "problems" are really just your own personal preferences and expectations not being catered to.  This is not an RPG in the traditional sense.  The lack of human NPCs is not a problem, any more than the lack of human NPCs was a problem in Pac Man or Frogger.
---
As for unbearable lag and mobs clipping in the ground every minute of the game, I don't know what to tell you.  I don't experience that.  I'm Level 206 so I've put in some hours.
---
Killing newbs makes u kewl
---
Yep it happened today. I was gonna trade with some dude and he couldn't.  Not even hard resetting his Xbox worked. Idk if theres a way to fix it but crashes have been more frequent to me as well since they gave people the free week. Not saying its because of them but... it sure didn't happen before lol Bethesda Fix yo shit lol
---
every mmo and fallout I've ever played never had to do side quests
---
If anything, youre the noob
---
My camp, I live in a huge pirate ship I built
---
Upvote!
---
Thank you for capturing this.
---
I can't say addictol without the man-child in me saying ''a dick doll''
---
Yeah man. It's all about knowing the map and sharing gear.
---
This game is a little different as we already know. There are lots and lots of quests and events you can do at your level. Just head towards Grafton.
---
Why defend it when you have 8 more
---
When looting in ESO I tend accidentally jump instead of grabbing the items, a leap of joy.
---
Yeah, I dont want to play a game that just shows hundreds of items in the game that represent random dead people in RL.
---
I think they screwed up something with adventure servers. Before Nuke Winter dropped, I RARELY had disconnects (ps4) but now I get them like 15-20 min after joining a lobby. The BR servers have been great though.
---
XD
---
At what point does someone stop being a noob? Level 100? These noobs were 70+. Or are you just jealous that I have a bloodied explosive weapon. &gt;_&gt;;
---
Are you on Xbox 1? I think you came by my camp
---
Level 70 players are not noobs anymore, but these guys are noobs. Not sorry.
---
Too bad the censored version is the one they have in game
---
The hermits aren't mutated
---
Yeah this shit was rough when it first came out. So it did suck back then, it's gotten a lot better.
---
I sell my 1 stars at 100-150 caps, 2 stars at 300-500 caps, and 3 stars at 900-1000 caps

The problem is my sexy voice distracts all of my team mates from the game
---
Creep alert?
---
Seriously?
---
&gt;I think my Call of Duty days 
---
Dammit I feel old now... I got burnt out on the shooting other players thing from Quake Team Fortress.
---
But yeah, I'm with you on gating Adventure mode items behind a completely different game mode. Also the lore. I have no desire at all to play Nuclear Winter and so it just feels like a giant tease, and I'm a little resentful because of it.
---
I guess I'll just wait until someone datamines and uploads all the holotapes to YouTube or something.
---
[](/cc_sad)Sadly even if they do overhaul survival/adventure I don't think it'll ever feel like a Fallout wasteland with PvP. Just look at your average player, kitted out in full PA or marine armor wielding weapons that even without the legendary effects would be boss grade weapons. Take those away and it won't feel like a Fallout game, let them keep them, and it won't feel like a Fallout wasteland.  
---
I love the idea of surviving in the Fallout wasteland with a bunch of other survivors, I hate the idea of being in a map sized deathmatch with an army of Courier 6s, Soul Survivors, and Chosen Ones.
---
Bought Fallout 76 just after Christmas, waited 3 months for the patches to roll in and then started playing. Played nothing else since. Really hoping for a PS5 enhanced version. Thanks for all your efforts.
---
Haha, so many butt hurt pussies in this sub. I get so much free junk off of you noobs that i never have to actually farm mats.
---
I generally agree, I'm just saying don't be suspicious of someone giving 2, 4, or even 10k of ammo, as those numbers are fairly easy to hit with most (outside of 556 and 2EC)
---
It spawns on top of a building in Berkley not far from the church.
---
I've got a bloodied explosive as well. But I dont go killing noobs that want a workshop waste of ammo. I have better things to do then that.
---
wasnt me but yea its a similar cheat u see in many games
---
I usually play as female characters in games (im male) but i often switch between female and male in fo76.         If you have a ps4 i would be more than happy to say add me my psn is pappododo
---
I know the risk with this game was great, and brought much dissonance. I've enjoyed it thoroughly so far and you've put together a Battle Royale that I enjoy. Can't wait for year two. Cheers.
---
They were level 70+ you moron. They’re still noobs though. I got high-radiation fluids. Score!
---
Assuming by your username, you are a male, yes,.. seriously..
---
Decades of online playing and you always have these threads, in every game,  of guys asking "where are the girls? Add me as friend".. and its always been labeled as weird or creepy or both.
---
Definitely would, but I'm on PC!
---
Tamed animals really need to register as nonhostile until engagement. I think I accidentally killed someone's pet brahmin the other day :(

Very good!!!

Shame you haven’t found anything better to do in the last couple of decades.
---
Ppl just love having nostalgic-colored glasses is a bigger part of the problem when having these kinda nuanced conversations. Anthem has good and bad parts. Andromeda has good and bad parts. ME1 has good and bad parts. Baldur's Gate 2 has good and bad parts. Ppl tend to overlook the flaws or the bumps when looking back, or when faces with a current mess or controversy of the moment. 
---
Look at all the ppl that come out and go on and on about how they loved ME3 and that it wasn't a bad game blahblah yet flash back in time and it was nonstop hate and memes and "BioWare is dead" yelling. Same's happening with ppl's thoughts on Andromeda now that Anthem is the new bone to bite. Just saying.... it'll happen with 76 when Starfield comes out and there are bugs and crashes and issues inevitably. Then it'll be the Starfield is a letdown, 76 was actually pretty good such and such that ppl will say.
---
Same email here! Mystery solved?
---
Highly unlikely. I don't know specifics but I imagine nick wasn't even born yet only 25 years after the war. Not that he's not 'still' alive, but hasn't been alive yet

---
You must be wearing your big boy pants.
---
^^^^
---
Very helpful. Thank you.
---
Because the people who bandwagon hated the game are actually trying it for once.
---
New gad or that lake?
---
I'm sorry for your limited perspective on the matter. Some people just prefer the company of females (or non-dudebro-ly guys).
---
It is a very good game.  Stop getting your opinions fed to you by fat internet neckbeards.
---
It’s actually the brotherhood scribe costume with matching medical helmet.
---
Thank you for not giving up on the game. I know you're doing you're best and I salute you for that.
---
News flash: All straight males prefer the company of females. Its a genetic thing.
---
Lol. Ok. U do u man. But it still wasnt worth ur time. And they knew it and left. But hey what do I know I'm a moron.
---
What’s better? Giving free stuff and making friends with noobs? They straight up take advantage of you guys. I’m providing a service to offset the balance of energy in the world.
---
Honestly. Gives me a reason to actually scavenge and stock up.
---
That's, uhh... wildly inaccurate.
---
First what's wrong with being fat? Second, some of the nicest people I know have "neckbeards", third your bigotry and name calling essentially make your comment worthless. And it's not a "very good game", it's not even in the top tier now, after a year of patching, it's only different and entertaining.
---
Middle mountain cabins in a basket next to and outside of the farthest left cabin from the spawn point. You can 9nly get it once every 24 hours. You'll encounter either 3 honesybeasts, radscorpions or Yao guais when you spawn in.
---
No joke, my wife and I planned our days around those beta hours. Nothing will ever top finding those wedding rings and wondering Appalachia as the couple we are.
---
No I mean I actually built it from scratch. It hovers in the mountains above White Springs.
---
I agree but I also believe they should remove the forced pvp and make it a duel system for adventure mode so people can’t brute force through the anti grief stuff.
---
I’m a new player and saw a big bat flying. Shit my pants and hid.
---
Damn, this guy has a girlfriend and wife
---
Also when you build, if the materials show in green it's coming out of the workshop budget, not your own materials. If they show white its pulling from your own stash.
---
Fat = no discipline.   And, yes:  it is a very good game.  You might try playing it before forming an opinion.
---
It was totally worth my time. 
---
Is your time really well spent here talking to me? Maybe you should go farm some mats to give bulk junk to noobs so I can murder them and take it. 
---
Edit: you’re wrong though, they left because they died. I didn’t even capture that workshop. They still didn’t return for it.
---
Some of my most rewarding experiences have been helping new players and strangers that just want someone else to go play with. It really gives me some new faith in humankind.
---
I've killed those honeybeasts, but never checked that basket, I'll give it a shot, thanks.
---
I just passed 30 and it's more about having good team perk synergy than anything else. Let the rifle guy have the scoped lever, the auto guy gets the handmade, etc.
---
Having someone pharma farm for meds helps a ton as well
---
Got a new one.. this one is for sure

Also chances of females replying to this thread are very low as most gaming females do not prefer to expose themselves on public forums because they usually get spammed by messages and invites.

I’ll tell you what’s not in Adventure, people! I’m pretty sure everyone’s just playing NW tbh.

I meant the real Nick Valentine. The one in Fallout 4 is just a copy of a pre war Detective with the same name.

No markers for enemy players is prob the bigger prob

I definately wasn't swimming in caps when I bought it, just saved it up. Start farming caps, you'll get it a hell of a lot easier and quicker than trying to find them in the world to scrap.
---
There was a pretty good video yesterday, but it has been removed for some reason.
---
Damn... I have 16 gb @ 1600mhz
---
Right, you're cheap too, I was selling my TS Minigun for 250c
---
Yeah at first I thought they would only send me an empty box. But u get 5 items. My favorite item is the nuka cola bottle opener. It's a 3 inch red bottle cap that opens both glass soda bottles and plastic soda bottles. And it has magnets to put it on the fridge.
---
If you get there and it's gone, server hop. It's a guarenteed spawn of the kind you need for cooking. Someone could have taken it before you. Took me 3 days but it's worth it to have one place to farm. The ones that drop from the honeybeasts arent usable.
---
Imnassum8ng it will because we already used the perk packs as rewards. It would suck so much and probably make me never touch it again if I had to level up all over again with no rewards.

This is I only play online games on console. I just use my PC to mod single player games.
---
Pretty sure it is. Would have to do some research to verify, but I'm almost certain that the vast majority of dudes prefer to hang out with other dudes.
---
That’s definitely true. But that’s also a problem with all the pvp in survival, adventure and NW so I didn’t put it in the list
---
I live 40 miles from the nearest UPS store. I though about paying myself just to try to get it here a bit quicker but I’m gonna let it play out.

We want all you new guys to stay... we need fresh meat.

It's nice that your girlfriend and wife play games together!
---
Right but what does "sneak peak" mean here? Does that mean the full release comes out the day after the sneak peak ends or does it mean they are teasing us with this new game mode and then going to take it away from us for a month before releasing the full thing?
---
I agree I would say it's just a test to see how popular the mode is and if it is popular I hope they increase it to bigger circle and more players Upto 100 and more options on server join.
---
Either solo, doubles or teams
---
I'm glad :)
---
Don't be smug, certainly there are opinions you have that have been swayed or informed by others.
---
They honored a guy like this for Fallout 4 Nuka World... no reason not to really. He was disabled, died due to complications. He was a massive long-time fan of the series. They gave him a little air stream trailer, and a voiced character that let you loot his stuff for free. Super nice and welcoming NPC. Not killable, before you ask.
---
So yeah, OP is not coming out of left field with this one. I think its kinda nice. 
---
Hell even just a plush bear riding a motorcycle with an army helmet or something!
---
Survival needs to go hardcore frost survival + PvP. It has to be a tactical choice to kill someone. Camps have to become crucial aspects of survival. It’s gotta be the complete night and day of adventure mode or it’s just gonna stagnate and disappear
---
Great idea!
---
Nah i gots 'xperience bro
---
Missile Launcher skins yet not a single rifle skin.
---
Comparing it to Anthem is just unfair. To be like anthem the studio would have to put effort so that everyone is miserable with their updates. And remove stuff that makes us happy.
---
Ok thx for the info, didn't know it's the base weapon that counts and not the currently equipped receiver
---
Thank God I dont play online games in PC.
---
Is that the Tweaked Automatic Receiver? Looks like that's bugged so it doesn't add WeaponTypeAutomatic. The other automatic receivers for the Pipe Gun all do.
---
I would very much like that.
---
Thank you!
---
Oh, dear...
---
Everyone's killable in my fallout 4.
---
Every Battle Royale Game ever. 
---
Once the cheaters arrive the fun is over. 
---
Not fixable tho, they are one step ahead every time.
---
You think buying the game is a barrier? PUBG begs to differ.
---
It's just sad.
---
Oh my... I just laughed out loud in the office.

---
 &gt; Oh my... I just laughed out loud in the office.
---
Damn it! Maybe in the future if we get crossplay
---
I don't really think there were any improvement on the game tho. 
---
I recently bought the XB1X and started to play FO76 on it and the first encounter I suffered was when I was getting out of the vault. It freezed and nothing more happened. I needed to close the game and then restart it again.
---
On some towns, specially the ones at the north of the map (I haven't explored the other ones), the framerate drops a lot. 
---
I don't know if it is just me, or my TV or my XB1X lol, cause it happens sometimes with other games, Wolfenstein II made my XB1X to die and I needed to restart the whole console and deleted everything. 
---
I have been playing FO76 on PC since launch, but here it is different. The main reason I try it on XB1X is because I have more friends here than on PC, but still some of them say that they've already patched and fixed many bugs and performance, even tho they dont have an XB1X and play on XB1 S.
---
Ah yeah my bad, hopefully, I mean it would definitely be interesting
---
We really don't know. Given the positive response, one can hope it will push the devs to get the true beta out sooner, but the only date we know is that the sneak peak ends on the 17th.
---
No. The Forest at least is packed in Adventure this week. Many low level players.
---
Lmfao! This is hilarious! Dude just turned into a scorchbeast! And he probably got EVERY kill in the game! His name just keeps popping up in the corner. And the mini gun just flipped to 999 after you were shooting at him! You’ve got the first REAL video of someone cheating on MW to my knowledge! Sheesh
---
DEMOCRACY IS NON NEGOTIABLE
---
My third match in, I was killed immediately by a guy that was at least speed and teleport hacking. I spectated him for a bit, and he was moving about 4x normal sprint speed, then teleported to an entirely different location before killing some other people. I reported it, but it is a bit disheartening.
---
One thing I’d like to see improved is the 2min timer to be reduced when the all the players are in the vault.
---
But fictional dead people who burned in a nuclear apocalypse, complete with skeletons pushing baby carriages, references to cannibalism and dead children... thats totally not depressing. Neither is having to shoot mutated doggos in the face when they wanna play with you...
---
Its a game, the devs can put whatever they damn choose in. Don’t act like you’ll stop playing, or stop buying fallout games.
---
I know you were being sarcastic, but this is for the people who read your comment in earnest.
---
Exactly. They definitely should NOT take it away completely on the 17th. That would be a huge mistake. Tons of new and returning players are loving this new game mode and is they take it away people could quickly move on and lose interest again.
---
Genuine constructive criticism on your wording here: people who identify as female would generally want to be identified just as “female”, not as “female identifying”. It’s cool that you’re wanting to be inclusive, more of that is needed!
---
real survival is 20-40
---
You still have that same experience, you're just a bit higher level for it.
---
Aye ya filthy modder. I miss mods. I should get a PC. But for teh bewbs, not to kill characters who represent real-life disabled people.
---
I play games for fun.
---
Thirst is real.
---
Your still paying for something that might have never come
---
Fair enough (although I'm not sure that is 100% correct), thank you for offering some legitimately constructive input!
---
This is amazing... companions living at my camp, following around the wastes together, romance, all the hits!
---
I had the same idea, tbh leveling that way is painfully slow. I went into a game solo because I wanted to survive, lasted to top 10, got 4 kills and only got 99 xp. I assume that your xp gained scales with your characters level. My mains are getting 1500+ xp for winning matches.
---
I think if you have pacifist on you can’t hurt takes creatures. I only say this cause I spawned into a player camp and had a tamed megasloth right in front of my face. Needless to say it startled me so I hit it a few before I realized it wasn’t hostile and it didn’t seem to take any damage. But I do agree with your non hostile statement. I’d be ticked if my pet cat died cause of some asshat (captnmeowington).
---
The rewards unlock in the Atom shop.
---
Yep then I saw you. Remember a guy running around naked except for a white hat?
---
Still says I haven't achieved it in the challenges tab
---
Confirming that this worked for me. I just found the basket and got the cookable jelly. Now I guess I can whip up some blackberry honey crisp in 48 to 72 hours! Watch those radscorpions though...
---
This is exactly what I was looking for, thanks man.
---
Yes
---
hahahahahaha amazing observation! Thanks for the mental image! (not really :P  )
---
Oh dang. I would put in a trouble ticket under the "Character" category with Bethesda. Though it may unlock automatically when you reach the next rank.
---
Yep that was the same guy.
---
Yeah guess I'll see soon enough, thanks anyways
---
I've been having trouble with my chat not working, I feel that may be an issue for others
---
Ah gotcha. Well let's just hope people don't start saying how to on YouTube or something. Idc if there's a few cheaters out there but when it gets to GTA levels, it just gets unplayable quick.
---
Same here :D
---
At the end of the game, you get a distress signal from the quarian ark that just arrived in Andromeda. Except, they're not really asking for help. It's more of the "Stay away! Save yourselves!" variety of distress signal.
---
Fair enough
---
Please let us romance a ghoul seeing as we can't play as ghouls.
---
The bears are worse lol. Thank God for marsupial and the low roofs. Also there's two magazine spawns there if you're looking. In the outhouse and shed out back.
---
My character was a raider, and that was a nice trailer, I could have sent him to the labor camps!
---
2 people is all it takes for &lt;3
---
I commented in another thread with my experience of someone speed and teleport hacking. Nothing ambiguous about it, he was as obvious as could be with it. Like a dunce, I hit Alt+F4 and closed the game instead of Alt+F2 to open the Nvidia Overlay, but reported it anyway. My ticket was closed shortly after [with this response](https://i.imgur.com/z6C4OGW.png), so I figure he was garnering quite a few reports rather quickly in his spree.
---
Whats fun in competing with a fast bike against some runners. I don’t get these lame folks.
---
I can't aim worth a fuck

an online Fallout has been a pipe dream of mine for years,i got 76 launch day and went in blind,just adventuring and playing fully immersed.I've enjoyed it the whole way through.I just enjoy it as an immersive experience and now its online.Its hard for me to not like the game for some reason.
---
Regardless, the first half was enjoyable enough, any improvement is welcomed—and heck they seem to be taking the whole free dlc thing seriously so it’s like we’re getting more and more burgers that get better each time!!
---
This is why when i play i keep OBS open on my otger screen, ready to just hit F12 and start recording
---
I feel you, completely the same thing for me since day one.
---
The easy option is to drop 4 points from Demo Expert, as those are low-value for most bloodied/explosive weapons (you don't mention which weapon you're intending to use). Generally with Bloodied you'll find that you have more than enough damage for most purposes. Could also lose some points off Evasive or Concentrated Fire.
---
The relaxed pace. If you’re done focussing on combat, you can work a bit in your camp, search for some plans, help a few lowlevels etc. The fact this game has so many aspects it why I like it.
---
Apparently tagging more then 3 prople markes it as spam and doesnt tag people
---
Yay! I hope we will be able to flesh out our camps with multiple NPCs and make our own settlements! Hooray for having my very own camp partners to watch my stuff!
---
They weren't. Recent interview specifically stated that they started development right around launch, more than likely in response to the outrage.
---
Am I the only one that thinks Appalachia is absolutely fine without human NPCs?
---
I sure would. Fisto has many talents.
---
Sounds like you killed yourself a tourist. This person likely only touches survival mode for the weekly weapon. For whatever reason these people are too lazy to store/get rid of all that stuff. Its really easy to find them trying to do the weekly challenge at the start of a week and grab yourself some free stuff.
---
I like the idea of building up someone capable of living out in the wasteland. Actually needing to go out and find plans or discover mods instead of instantly being able to make everything I need is pretty neat.
---
I would guess it's kind of a test during free trial week to see the response so far
---
After the sneak peak i can imagine that we get a bit polish (if needed by their collected data) and more regions added.
---
Aww I missed it.
---
Still a good investment. I'd say you could get around 7 to 10k for your spare and the purveyor one has a better 3rd. In fact, I'd be happy to take it off your hands if you're on xbox ha?
---
But all they do is starting flames in people's butts :D
---
Its all about keeping the team together and being sneaky snakes. But maybe that'll change if they make it Solos/Duos/Teams etc.
---
Some of us just have been around long enough, and gotten lucky a few times along the way, to have nice stuff.  You can't keep it all.  Also, you'll find certain items in my store that are really good for a certain build (i.e. bloodied) that I know others want but since I'm not running that build, there is no sense in me keeping it.
---
I figure that I would rather sell the really good items that I don't need and have it go to a good home than trade it in and have it virtually disappear down the pit of darkness...  
---
I can farm enough legendaries in one or two runs of White Springs to hit the daily limit of script.  Plus I tend to have more than enough after a Nuke event.  But if an item has been in my store for a while and hasn't sold, I will turn it in and replace it with something new.
---
Oh I see I see. I definitely remember the video about Oxhorn and the X-01, where the Nuka world suit was a prime example. And pardon me, I still have yet to complete my first run trough of Fallout 2, and then do a more in depth one, so X-02 I'm quite lacking knowledge about, just apart the date it was created after Poseidon oil rig was destroyed, so heh maybe it can be a newly fangled X-02, which could be covered up as "lack of communications brought this Power armour to life, but may have some regional differences"
---
With the X-03, we do know that it was still made a good 100 years after 76 though. Since in New Vegas, we encounter ED-E, who's his creator, whitley, had to get take off the Duraframe eyebot project and all attention was focused to Hellfire. We don't have an exact date of when it entered production(still around adams air force base before the fight occurred in Broken steel), more of an around estimate, as you say undefined.
---
There's a lot of undefined specific lore I'd say, so things such as exact dates, but we're given rough estimates with multiple mentions and encounters.
---
Granades and granate launcher are underated change my mind.
---
I’ve gotten master shotgunner (Strength 3) 40% more damage with shotguns
---
I think it's fine, but I'm not saying it wouldn't be better without NPC's. Remember, Role-playing game. [S.P.E.C.I.A.Ls](https://S.P.E.C.I.A.Ls) having an impact on gameplay for once. besides that one quest with the trappers having perception to see a booby trapped bomb.
---
They are ok games
---
Awesome thank you
---
I mean honestly i was pretty much okay with that part, it was the complete removal of the entire dialogue system which was a core part of the entire franchises thing and then not replacing it with any truly compelling new ideas that bothered me. 
---
don't get me wrong i like the game but even in a spin off its kinda bad form to just get rid of beloved features and also not really add anything to fill the gap.
---
xbox unfortunately
---
I played for over a 1000 hours and never missed them. I liked it.
---
I guess because we all are to Nuclear Winter? After the free week we will see how the level-population of the servers is.
---
You find it randomly, out of the matches I've played (not that many yet) I've only found one set of T-51b. It helped a little but I still got shot down fairly quick, I got cornered in a bus lol
---
Currently, only the vault suit works as an under armor. Since the tactical suit is under armor, you can’t equip it like other cosmetics in NW.
---
It's all luck of the draw. I played my very first ever round, decided to spawn at the lookout tower and found power armor and a sniper rifle. Next round I found only melee weapons.
---
There should be an option to mark the skin as nw favorite from within the atom shop menu. On ps4 all you have to do is press x on it after its bought but idk about pc or Xbox.
---
You not get the community you want but deserve - as it seems you've made it pretty well.
---
Thank you for keep pushing and not back out!
---
Ive been spending all my time at V76 giving away water food and stims.  #feelsgoodman
---
Relax dude. If girls dont want to talk to or friend him, they wont. They dont need you to police comments and white knight for them here. What do you care if he wants to meet a girl that plays the same hame as him
---
only if theres a chance to spawn a mirelurk queen
---
I have a bloodied, Explosive +1 Agi Handemade.  
---
My secondary weapon is the Bloodied, Power attack, reduced damage taken while power attacking Deathclaw Gauntlet from last weeks survival mode challange.  
---
I think that the Demo Expert is a heavy investment and doesnt give as much damage as other tallents.
---
You seem to value evasive quite low. +45 Resist seems pretty decent to me.   
---
I think droping concentrated Fire might be the go for starters since my perception is hovering around 30 most times accuracy in vats isnt a problem.  
---
3 Points off Evasive, 2 off Concentrated Fire. Demo Expert.
---
I encountered this guy today too.  36 kills or some dumb shit.
---
There’s a perk card you can earn that assist in finding pa
---
I for one love the way the story played out. We left the vault, the only survivors of the scorched horde. We fought them back, nuked their queen, persevered as a vault unlike any before and its gotten the attention of the surrounding survivors. We straight up made Appalchia habitable again. Theres something to be said about that.
---
they said they will remove it and release at a later date. still don't know if we get to keep the levels we get now
---
the grafton vendor doesnt sell it for me either but the tip with the treasure maps was very helpful i tried it but given up because i havent found anything and wasnt sure if they can give me what i need
---
thank you very much 👍🏼
---
Sad state of affairs and this is why I won't play any pvp game I loved battlefield and this got killed off with hackers for me and I can't see that beathesda will be able to stop this happing in fallout 76.
---
Ps4 until 18th
---
You’re calling people noobs but are excited over getting high radiation fluids. Can’t kill the queen for flux?
---
Gatling and 50cal are fucking beast they both hit for around 100 damage, have huge magazines and are precise.
---
Combat rifle - 30damage
---
radium rifle - 30 damage
---
pistols fucking useless shit that wont even hit
---
shotguns super hard to hit anything
---
scoped snipers unusable
---
hunting rifle - better to melee
---
melee "Are you fucking kidding me?"
---
lever action still way weaker than gatlin
---
M79 granate launcher - beast
---
plasma granate - nice powerarmor you have over there, it would be shame if something blow you out with one hit
---
i know that feel, ME: andromeda did the same to me, hinted dlc with quarians at the end of the game and then got abandoned lol... sadlol
---
You guys are doing great as well! Almost every online game has a hard start, espacially at the beginning. The most important thing is, You guys didnt give up on the game and us, and provided constant support, new amazing game content. You did listen to us as a community and implemented all the things we asked for. Thank You all for Your hard work!
---
Lets rebuild Appalachia together!
---
Yeah I have noticed the same about lack of Vendor camps. I assumed it would be due to the massive influx of new players playing this week for free.
---
Ah yes, i've encountered that same guy a few games ago. Reported in game and on the website.
---
A capitalist pig would hire a team and have them guard the unlocked extractors, whereafter he would take the lion’s share of loot.
---
A socialist pig (I know the fauna doesn’t fit here, but I couldn’t think of an animal in the natural world that exhibits socialist tendencies)...anyway, a socialist pig would hire a team to perform the aforementioned duties gratis, but then evenly distribute the loot...that is, after he took the lion’s share of course.  
---
And lastly, a woman would would hire a team, with each member claiming her own workshop. All of the women would lock said extractors, subsequently pulling resources from five workshops to divvy them up before going to enjoy some infused bloodleaf tea,  They would then wait for their husbands to come home, and acknowledge how hard their husbands must have had to work guarding those unlocked extractors ; )
---
(If you’re not married to an amazing woman you might not get this...)
---
Me, my brother and my friends teamed during the BETA and just had fun exploring the map, in the first beta session we got onto I said I wanted to go see watoga as it looked cool as fuck, so we made our low level asses all the way across the map into the hardest location of the game to have a nose around.  
---
This was also back when Watoga was a constant war zone of scorchbeasts fighting the non stop spawning robots
---
My biggest gaming disappointment of recent years, and I'd been looking forward to that game so much.
---
U have too equip it in the atom store and use expand on the scroll wheel (I don’t know what key bind it is on PS4 but it’s Q by default on PC)
---
Pull up the wheel and hover over an icon... There will be a button to change what emote is in that slot.
---
It's Q on pc but it tells you at the bottom.
---
Once you get through the basics the back end of the main quest is very fun. Especially the brotherhood and enclave stuff. There are a heap of events that you can do outside of the main quest that are entertaining such as the alcohol, cryptid, and scout portions of 'Wild Appalachia'.
---
Once you have a character who is strong enough, launching nukes and fighting the SBQ is incredible. As somebody with a few characters, I recommend reading and listening to lore. And playing with somebody. Otherwise you'll find the game to be empty. It's Fallout with people after all
---
Thanks, added it.
---
This is basically having a small dick, so comparing it to that of a child to make it seem bigger. A) no-one cares, B) you're an asshole, and C) you're unwanted here.
---
I would love to see crafting animations removed, it would allow players to craft at the same time like scraping, it would help keep players from undermeshing, and it would keep players from using your benchs to get into your camp.
---
She'll live, but will you?
---
I would have gotten a video but there was no time. The guy just teleported around in power armor and killed the last people alive with a combat shotgun in like 20 seconds
---
I think he sometimes can still appear past the bridge, but yeah, camps definitely mess with spawns.
---
There is a spot he can appear up by Janet’s Soft Serve that is much more reliable. Walk the road until you get to the overturned bus.
---
I agree with all but the last. And only because it makes it worth while to grind out level 50 atleast. But it may deter people as well. I also think they should add some sort of marking system for team communication kinda like apex but even if it just moved your normal marker by pushing the button that’s normally vats.
---
4 just did such a bad job with npc and dialogue most 76 players were cool if they left it out. Imo
---
The acting is really good in this game and maybe it's cause they didnt have to read 4 versions of lines lol.
---
I did 14ranks in like 20hours, it take ages now to level up and it is really hard to win, with all those campers around.
---
pc sadly
---
They need this. Then theres the fact that you wind up wearing the same armor for hundreds of hours because its “the best” (or what you were looking for), and you just get tired of seeing the same outfit/gear all the time.
---
Yup had a guy oneshotting everyone in my squad with a pumpgun ... mind you that its impossible to oneshot a guy in a powerarmor. BR and free to play times just work as a lämp for these god awefull moths...
---
I AGREE
---
I identify as a female rock, that’s 556 years old, good enough?
---
I agree it would kill a lot of the hype. Especially when it’s running so surprisingly well.
---
One for rank 0 is near vault enterance
---
another for rank 6 is in corner behind those red things which are behind podium where you can play on musical instruments
---
rank 11? in in medlab. 
---
didn't find any other i could use.
---
Yeah but it's still fun. I just did a new one and am taking my time. I appear to have missed a ton on my first 3.
---
Same with gatling plasma
---
Check your audio settings. On PS4 I always have my chat volume turned all the way down for some reason
---
Yeah, I met two cheaters already as well. Their articles/patch notes say that because it's in pre-beta, they might have to take NW down at short notice. I would say this definitely merits taking it down if there's anything at all they can do to stop it. At least you don't lose anything other than your time for meeting a loser like that
---
Haha I've been chasing them around in my ritual mask, i remember the first time i saw someone beckoning me over wearing that thing... The endless battle between he may have puppies for me to pet/may bundle me in the back of his van and eat my genitals.
---
Pretty sure I have all those.....psn pathofcinders I'll be on tomorrow
---
happened to me too and one of my friends as well
---
there was a newbie doing those first responders quest and he was at the computers in front of the church, then i decided to change my clothes to the tattered mole outfit and wait behind him....
---
i scare the shit out of him when he turned around! he screamed and run away swearing at me lol
---
I have said before that as much as Its cool to have legendary weapons and shit... They kinda spoil the game, makes every non legendary weapon not even worth having, so it takes out the entire "crafting you own weapons" part of the game, along with the obvious PvP problems with balance they cause.   
---
I think removing legendary weapons would improve the game or at least have a game mode without them so like you said, remove them from survival will probably be the best balancing you they could do
---
Can u elaborate more please? Is this for adventure mode lvl 100? And how exactly are these rewarded?
---
The devs themselves don't come here, we have community managers. They are usually active in the days following an update or inside the vault article.
---
Can we do it during NW? I couldn't figure out how to blueprint stuff.
---
No, markers are needed, if there wont be markers, reduce movement speed by 50%.
---
Sure, no petrological bias here!
---
I’m pushing 1k hours in it. It’s definitely worth it IMO :)
---
Nope capture a workshop
---
I've been using a gatling plasma all day and finally figured out how it works. It will cancel your shots with any spin-up weapon if you aim down sights while spinning. It works fine if you hipfire and then aim down while it's already shooting, OR aim down the sights before you begin even spinning up the barrel
---
(On adventure)
---
Have you ever considered you just smell really bad?
---
^((jk))
---
Project paradise was the latest things. But vault raids should be coming soon
---
Why do people cheat in online games
---
What’s the Slocum’s Joe power armor paint look like?
---
Never played a game with xray so its just... Werid to me. But i get that it's popular now.
---
The experience we had of the game doesn't exist any more. They'll run into player vendors, get interrupted by new side quests, and be surrounded by helpful knowledgeable people
---
Why you think that? There is a roadmap till the fall of this year. So the next one will be around november.
---
 PLease google before posting

I don’t really understand what your post is for, but I’m female, I regularly see other females playing. Gt is often a giveaway
---
much less upvotes than expected
---
The game mode is only around for a few more days, it's unlikely Bethesda will or can do anything about cheaters within this time.  
---
That said it will probably be one of the major concerns that they'll be trying to work on before bringing the mode back permanently.
---
And why did the link get removed, how is this witch hunting a witch hunt would be if they didn't have valid proof like a video of him aimbotting and flying
---
Anthem ... unmemeable .
---
Sometimes showing up at a quest location will trigger the next part for you. Has helped me before
---
Mine Fallout 76 playing hot-blondie girl-friend asked me to give you thumb up for this. For obvious reasons she dont want to do it herself. But I can confirm. They are not like Yeti. They exist.
---
Don't take it to seriously, this is a pre beta after all. Please don't get up in arms if they don't.
---
To Andromeda generally, or the hypothetically quarian DLC / sequel?
---
I rather liked Andromeda myself and saw a lot of room for future expansion of lore there. Shame we're probably never going to get more games set there.
---
I don't use power armour and 2 of the best cards I got are for it -.-
---
I'm loving the sniper rifles- the range on them is fantastic. Paired with the Rifleman perk card, I was one shotting people if I managed to line up the shot properly.
---
I found a minigun one round though too and that was a lot of fun.
---
I am like level 21 if that is Good. I would love to help more players if I can.
---
You can ping enemies in apex, that's close egouth.
---
Cheating being possible like this shows how badly the networking has been designed.
---
A player should not have this much control. Bethesda you know about server authoritative networking. Please make cheating harder to do like CS:GO!
---
Shame you're not on PC or that I'm not on PS4. I just started the tadpole badges myself. Going to go camera hunting when I get home  from work.
---
HEY HEY HEY I STARTED THIS MEME IN THE FO 76!
---
AND WHEN ITS DEAD
---
 I want the funeral feast to be the biggest the kingdom ever saw, and I want everyone to taste the meme that got me.
---
Hop in and try
---
Im convinced the grenade launcher is a must have,one if the best weapons IMO.If you have the Frog Legs perk its even crazier with the grenade launcher.
---
Are you a time traveler or somethin'?
---
Good luck to you 3 and have fun in Appalachia!
---
Easy on the nukashine lol
---
Missing a lot.
---
The whole camera process is a bit ridiculous, honestly... Like how is it that they thought it was a good idea for the spawns to be completely random lol
---
Same thing here. I was just absolutely baffled when I got a shipment notification.
---
For the most part just wondering about the male/female ratio of players here, and if there are any predominantly female/female-character factions. What is "Gt", btw?
---
you gotta drop the nuke so that fissure site prime is inside but on the edge of the nuke zone, and that v9 is outside, this makes it possible for ppl to kill her out of the nuke zone and use melee.
---
like this https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/renawana/screenshot/12286898
---
totally agree i play only solo and i just met group of 3 and 6 people
---
I've been to two camps with pets so far (one a Yaoi Guai, the other a glowing Mirelurk) and both of them attacked me on sight, even though I was not attacking their owner. I wish they would fix that, honestly. I'd rather not have to resort to killing them, and of course I didn't kill them, but they still did a bit of damage. Particularly the Yaoi Guai one, that one kept knocking me about as I tried to shop at the vending machine. He got stuck in geometry eventually, much to my convenience.
---
Thank you! Anything extremely vital I should know? Without spoiling the learning curve?
---
i once hit a car in the parking lot of the powerplant. obviously, when the workshop is taken, that makes you wanted, too. not sure if pacifist protects you from that....
---
Jesus lol
---
I don't think the story was so bad, not memorable sure, but not totaly worthless. I think many however tried to compare it to the trilogy, thats what truly killed it ... that and the face capture
---
That's not the roadmap im talking about. That one is very simplistic. And shows Spring/Summer/Fall themes
---
Me and the others who commented want a detailed roadmap for Nuclear Winter like we got one for Wild Appalachia
---
Like this:

---
Please google before responding
---
Oh right. Means Gamer tag - like username on Xbox. Other platforms call it other things,
---
I got 6times duplicate perk card, so i can't tell what perk cards are imba, because i don't have any fucking perk cards. Well i have, atleast 4 for melee build..... :D
---
I just got the email for it too, Was pretty confused by it.
---
The base game of 76 always gave me some Bioshock vibes, adventuring through the ruins of society populated by violent madmen with only audio recordings and the occasional voice over the radio to guide you.
---
Absolutely the same feeling.
---
Think R1 on PS4
---
Hopefully this doesn't get the Apex Legends treatment where hacking + bugs + slow devs = -50% of the player base. Bethesda should have the man power to get this sorted.
---
Thank you guys, Im honestly starting to enjoy the game now. The no NPC thing REALLY got to me amd I just could not for the life of me get into the game. I really really tried too. Fallout is my all time favorite game series and I was devestated there was an entry I just couldn't make myself play. Flashforward to 3 days ago, and I am finding myself rather enjoying the game. Encountered no game breaking bugs and glitches, and I rather enjoy the Battle Royale. I love PUBG and other BR games so this mode I feel was definitely catered to me, and I realy like that. I totally understand how some despise it though. Regardless, I greatly look forward to becoming a full fledged raider this fall!
---
How much do you want for all of these ?
---
I have the same problem. However, I have used more than 6 stimpacks throughout several matches of NW. I thought at first it might of been because there are different stimpaks now that didn't count; like "epired" or "extra" stimpaks, but that wasn't the case because I made sure to only count regular stimpaks. Maybe you have to use 6 regular stimpaks in one game? I'll have to try it out, but as of right now I think the challenge is bugged. 🙁
---
Ah, okay, thanks!
---
HOLY CRAP.. Insta ban this asshat and any and all alternate accounts this person has. He does not belong anywhere near FO76.
---
I've played like 50 hours and still haven't run to him yet. Instead I've seen the prize bot multiple times and he's starting to get annoying. :D
---
I've found a few broken cameras, but I'm not sure if they're the right ones, or if scrapping them means I've ruined them. So hopefully I can find another and start fresh on that pursuit.
---
My 2 shot lever action is pretty damn accurate.
---
“YOUVE WON A PRIZE”
---
“Where’s my fucking shotgun”
---
I'm pretty sure they have to be cameras from set random spawns. I believe a quest starts once you pick it up. Apparently you find it on dead tourists near landmarks throughout the map
---
If you are on PC, the key for push to talk was changed to Caps Lock for some reason.
---
I buyed it for 30 and they were good spent in my opinion, i played like 100 hours. I stopped playing just because the game force you to run certain 'raids' for getting progression or you don't get shit fast enough, but im waiting for the cataclysm release, i will judge it myself and decide if it's worth my time
---
With Frog Legs you get 3X the jumping height i think it is?So you can jump over people,onto roofs,roof to roof while shooting people with the grenade launcher,hilariously broken IMO
---
I have noticed there there are the firework launchers from FO4 placed around certain locations, seen 1 for sure on the roof of the building with the voting station in Lewisburg.  
---
So they must have a plan for them somewhere down the line or it seems a pretty strange thing to have there
---
I honestly think, and i might in the minority by saying that, but up to now i was fine with missing them out because of the story that was told what happend before the vault opened. It just made sense.
---
Also if i think about the rocky beginning - it was better they left it out at first to prevent more troubles and flaws.
---
Are on PC? I've got the vendor bot right now, though he doesn't have the outfit for me.
---
female identifying? Oh here we gooooooo
---
Nothing I've seen, and I'm keen to know myself.
---
It crosses pretty much the entire board, from i5 to ryzen, 1060 to Vega, some amount of people seem to have the issue yet others don't. Elusive AF.
---

Yep. I need help on Scout missions too. On PS4. Add me if you want and I can help out. LVL15. Got the camera, but I can help you find one. I am in New Zealand, but I play all hpurs of yhe day.
---
PSN: yurodivy
---
honestly if somebody gets like 15+ kills in a single round they should be investigated, complain all you want but I really doubt somebodys gonna get that many kills by themselves
---
We absolutely will, by the end there will be players who are prob in the 80’s, there’s no way they’ll reset after the time we have all put in it.
---
People are reporting it; it is getting widespread...

He can sometimes spawn if there is a camp there I think, but no guarantees. 
---
However he does spawn in other places. Down the road from Lady Jane Soft serve is one point, just turn right from there and walk down road a little till you see a couple vehicles. He can spawn there.
---
He can also be found on the highway junction south of gorge junkyard workshop, west of Morgantown. I've seen him there a few times.
---
I'll share this whole thread with the team so they can see everyone's views :) thank you for this mate
---
Play with a group if you can, its an absolute game changer cus even when you dont have anything to do yourself, you can tag along with whatever theyre doing and just help each other out, feels more like a survival game that way
---
non-automatics are as good or better than the automatics, the balance is great on PC
---
...try using a mouse I guess? :s (sorry)
---
Dead is dead. But dead can walk. It would be funny if player corpse just raise as npc ghoul, who require second termination :)
---
This sums it up pretty well.
---
We reclaimed it (okay... maybe not the way as intended by nuke everything lol) and now let the story continue.

Thank you for fixing the game and making it so fun and interesting. Moments after i tried free version,I immidiately got hooked and ordered full game. Keep up the good work.

This made me laugh very loud and I feel I need to apologize haha

When you first "lvl screen" thats when you select which Special to add 1 to, you use the bumpers (Console) to change them, you will then be taken to perks for that special, again, use bumpers to go elsewhere

Even better is they can sense remaining survivors on long range and just like homing missile run to any hidding survivors.

.. poor snipers!!

I got a fun weekend ahead :)
---
I was annoyed AF after I got the battlecoat for the bundle and it instantly unequips as soon as I put on wood armor. Like wtf didn't they talk about cosmetics so you can represent or some shit? That hypocrisy really pissed me off. Like it's literally the OPPOSITE of how it usually works? Why would they change that? WHATS THE POINT!

Has there been any word from bethesda saying that it will change?

Every Fallout oreviously played was Offline, and not level locked.

What MMO's then? Phantasy Star. WoW. ESO all have side quests to level, don't try an drum up a fake scenario to justify your stupidity. You can't even spell Experience, and we're supposed to believe you know what MMO's are like?

Come on dude, TRY at least.

Nah, if you win a lot you can get to 30 in probably 24 hours. I for one haven’t but I’m 33 right now without cheating.

There is mention somewhere in game of the next “rank” of badges after possum. I’m racking my Brian trying to remember where it is but I can’t think.
---
This.
---
I want an attack Corgi.   His only ability would be to cripple legs and having them with me would consume more of my food than Speed Demon and Parasites combined.
---
Love you guys! So happy with the direction this game has taken.
---
"This is why nobody likes this game" speak for yourself. Mr experience.
---
P.S every MMO to date has level locked quests and areas, with side quests to level. 
---
Elder Scrolls Online.
---
WoW.
---
Phantasy Star.
---
Final Fantasy.
---
Neverwinter.
---
So on so forth.
---
/raises hand
---
Yup.  Too late.
---
Skip lead and settle on an acid extractor. 
---
Running Lucky Hole mine once in excavator armor will net you enough lead ore to use on most anything
---
Especially as the cards are in no way equal. I got +40% automatic rifle damage. My mate got takes less rads when standing in water.
---
Guess which of us is having a better time.
---
Discover the first region by doing the quests/events till you guys are ready to head to the next region.
---
If you want i can let you know the recommended levels for each region (bit of tiny spoiler maybe cause of the region names)
---
But the best tip i can give you - take it easy, don't rush and just enjoy it. :)
---
And you will. No doubt about that
---
You're not entirely wrong. The pvp for this game is GREAT for when it's balanced and people can make sense of it. There's got to be a way of doing both.
---
Taming no longer works for me after the Nuclear Winter update. Both level 3 perk cards equipped (Animal Friend and Wasteland Whisperer) and my Charisma is 10.
---
Who
---
Yeah I got that vibe too. It comes across as “yo any chicks here? I’ll be your friend 😉”. You could have gone with “Laid back guy looking for non-hyper competitive guys/gals to play with”. But you didn’t. Hence the creeper vibe.
---
You can change your character name on PC?
---
REMOVE LEGENDARIES AND V.A.T.S WATCH SURVIVAL FLUORISH! PROFIT!
---
I enjoy PvP but not the main game, it's so broken and unbalanced, 1 shots everywhere unless someone has that sentinal etc build.
---
Nuclear Winter all the way for PvP, until they give armour values actual armour, joke being 1 shotted in a full set if PA stacking 700 DR, yet some skinny guy in LEATHER can take 5x more damage. 
---
Where's the logic?
---
So will the hellfire PA set be an actual PA set or just skins?
---
Remindme! 7 years
---
I think it’s Squirrel and I *think* there’s a purchasable item in the badge vending machines that references it...
---
It’s stock but i find that hard to believe that it needs to be replaced when other games run fine
---
After looking it up earlier today, that's my understanding of it now too. I know the tourist bodies can spawn at the civil war cemetery and the memorial on the mountain top to the south of there (assuming I'm remembering the map correctly now), so I'll probably bounce between those two locations while server hopping.
---
When will you guys release a finished game?
---
Same camp as you. Tried to use them as a turret stand (for which we have none)
---
Checked both of those and the waterpark parking lot multiple times today and nothing lol
---
Apologies if it came across in that way, certainly not the intention.
---
Why non-hyper competitive, though? Not sure the implication there.
---
Thx for the response, keep up the good work :)
---
I'm curious to see if they add in new Charisma perks once we have NPCs to interact with. Seems like there's a lot of room for expansion there.
---
You already have the option to play solo. Select solo from the first screen after selecting NW

Please tell me suspended accounts will find peace  soon.

No it doesn't lmfao. I got boosted by a pair of level 200's in a 200 cave...... 👍🏻
---
Don't tell someone who owns a game what does/doesn't happen.
---
Bye nerd.
---
I might have to do this, I can't put up with the useless emotes anymore
---
This is the first thing I thought when I read this post.
---
Valid points
---
I will say this on the ap/sprinting issue.
---
There are cards you can get like action boy, and marathoner that allow you to sprint for much much longer. 
---
It would definitely be great if they allowed more ap/lower cost, but I think the way it’s designed is it forces you to make the hard choice in perk loadout.
---
Do I run damage cards or cards that allow me to sprint for longer etc. just my 2 cents
---
PS4 for me got him to spawn again this time a witch hat and ranger hat lmaoo
---
:(
---
Incisor/martial artist, and then your choice of unarmed/1h/2h dmg increase
---
Right but doesn't that just make it to where my team has no fill? Wouldn't it still be me vs other teams of 4?
---
Well max level is 50 so r/quityourbullshit and if your referring to champion level it's just to build your character. I played through main story to get to max
---
I watched a guy who wiped my team twice it two separate, but consecutive matches - he was genuinely good, building towers, playing strategically, good aim; got 9-10 kills in every match. So it is possible. Flying, however, is not...
---
LMFAO Max level isn't 50 AT ALL 😂😂😂😂😂
---
I was honestly a little amazed launching the game again that they still hadn't implemented better inventory sorting, it was such a highly requested feature with a pretty light development cost. 
---
So much still seems to be the exact same complaints the game had at launch.
---
naive sheep. but keep on munching stool...
---
Will be so much worse if they wipe our progress.. Lol
---
Max champion and Max level are two different things bud
---
Playing with cheaters, a PC exclusive 😂👌
---
Yes! People kill my poor Benny all the time. One particularly horrible player killed him right in front of me and when I gave the grumpy emote and fixed the feeder, he killed him again! After that I got out my Power Armor and chased him down the street with my Super Sledge. Pretty sure it was him who kept killing my poor cow for the next hour, I finally server hopped just to stop it. He's one out of three assholes I've met since the Beta came out so I suppose I'm lucky, but try to kill me, not my poor cow!
---
If they are gonna do that I'd prefer it if they did it with brand new outfits rather than outfits copy pasted in from Fallout 4.
---
Oh I fucking hope not. Grinding was fun it I don’t want to do it ever again. Once I get 100 I’m taking a 10 year break
---
I'll be around flatwoods a lot. All &lt;level 10 get free supply of food and healing chems.
---
It would be cool even if it was possible to make gift bags at your workbench. So it's one item showing in your inventory which has a pre chosen content.
---
No, this isn’t an 18, it’s a survival-lite game. Idk. Maybe you would get more than 2 kills in NW if you were older. Or you know, NOT A NOOB lol them noob tears yum. You’re the type of player that I would murder over and over again just to hear you cry over the mic.
---
Yeah sure kid.
---
with the xp they give might as well keep them like in adventure lol
---
SupaFlyEbbie got it right.  Lucky Hole mine is THE place for lead ore.  You'll encounter one of three things (random enemy type) 1. Cave Crickets 2. Radroaches (glowing)  3. Radrats.  There are usually 10 - 20 mole miners sprinkled throughout the mine tunnels.
---
The mine near arktos pharma has a lot of coal.. Gauley mine or something.
---
9-10 kills isn't 15
---
I think they need to take down Nuclear Winter based on this.  If it's possible to cheat that bad then the mode isn't even half-baked or in beta, this is more in alpha and seriously broken.  I hope these cheaters get banned fast.
---
Thank You BGS for another Fallout.
---
THIS. it wouldnt cost em 30mins to implement such thing and yet they didnt do....just dont get why they ban such mods then if theyre too lazy to make their game better?!
---
But this probably means that this is just a skin for the X-03...which hasn't been released yet. Meaning it's coming and unlocking isn't gated behind NW

---
Oh ok then
---
Lol I blueprinted my bar with as many decorations as the blueprint budget would allow so I can set it down during NW for shits and gigs
---
That's what Ive been saying since day one. Bethesda needs to just come out and say it that this game is only "Semi-Canonical" parts like 
---
*Canon*
---
"The Appalachian region was ravaged by the Scorch and humanity almost completely disappeared. Then the Vault 76 doors open and life returned"
---
*Not Canon*
---
Everything else
---
Insulting a minor on his appearance. Classy. So, it's clear that you hate when people try to enjoy a game, and both due to that and your previous comment, you're a pathetic little PoS. I hope you get into a debilitating car crash that doesn't kill you, but leaves you without any motor skills for the remainder of your life, and when you ask for the life support to be turned off, your parents don't allow it just so you can suffer.
---
Same. I NEED MY HELMET AND STATUE
---
Not sure what your point is, kid? What I post is irrelevant to the fact that you haven’t got any hair on your balls yet. Don’t worry, it’ll happen. One day.
---
salty stool munchers everywhere.....i bet you like fortnite light aka nuclear winter, dont you good boy? now go fetch!

You have gotten a blueprint to work from adventure to nw? 
---
I’ve tried to no avail
---
I love helping out new players! Anything to get rid of the crap I don't need. 🤔
---
I was looking forward to survival mode a lot too but it just ended up become more of a quick fire PvP deathmatch mode with the top 3 scoreboard system.
---
That one was actually pretty funny. Somebody has to tell these kids that they aren’t special. And look at you. You prove my point. None of you are nice. The real you just came out. A hateful fucking person that wishes death upon people. All over a video game. Stupid noob with titties.

I hope the AIDS effect works kinda like mutations with a buff and a debuff. The debuff being carrying less and doing less melee damage the longer you have the disease. The buff granting poison splash damage to anyone that attacks you with melee

What is it with this subs fascination with balls and dicks? Is that all you think about? And it’s totally relevant because you’re trash at this game and you’re here talking shit. If this video was titled “epic double kill at workshop” and posted on filthy casuals and I pretend to be nice and helpless like you, then yeah, 400 points for being bad at the game. I’ll take the negatives any day.
---
Lmao!!
---
You've made my day. This is hilarious! Lmao
---
THANK GOD! I'm getting tired of getting com bans for trying to seduce my fellow wastelanders
---
Again, insult through appearance. Real classy. I'm simply calling you an asshat for ruining someone else's experience. Now imagine that level 70 had a gruelling day job with an asshole boss, making just above minimum wage. Playing a game after work was their best way to chill out. Now you ruined a game for them. That's not my experience, but more than likely many others'.
---
I get off work in about 6 hours and need help with this too, if you still need help then I'd be glad to join you.
---
Damn, i start work in about 6 hours lol
---
Could you name some?
---
50 DR really doesnt make a ton of difference. You really have to stack defensive cards to get any noticeable difference in staying power. At most its saving him from an extra bullet, maybe two.
---
IP ban babyyyy
---
I never insulted their appearance you illiterate fuck. I insulted the style of that pathetic picture. And if I did, well fuck I forgot because as you can tell, all I do is talk smack lol
---
I really liked Old Longfellow. Best companion in the game in my opinion.  He picked up a legendary minigun from a downed super mutant once and went to town clearing out the mob.  Once done, holding the glowing smoking minigun he started chuckling and telling me he was having a blast.  Then said we should go for a drink.
---
U can rank up by killing mobs and hide. People will share with lore from NW mode later.
---
It is grindy if you don't win, which i don't understand how to win.
---
Match making should be balanced better that is sooooo true.
---
If you only have one weapon if you do the hot swap it goes to fists on console (it’s the right directional button) it’s the one we use to swap between the current and last weapon so if pc player have that mouse or key button use that
---
This may not be an option for you but the PS4 version is $17 if you don't mind a physical copy.
---
Oh hit a nerve with the balls comment did I? Sorry kid, like I said, you’ll hit puberty soon.
---
Something similar but worse happened to me in adventure mode. There was a guy who killed a pacific scorched beast in like 3 hits with extreme damage and accuracy. I thought he was just good and had god tier weapon. Then the more I was around him I realized my health was going down and down (like getting hit by invisible enemies). I heard the bullet noises hitting me and from extremely long distance this guy was managing to hit me and dealing insane amounts of damage (like killing me in 3 shots when in PA) I managed to heal myself but the strange thing is that I was in pacifist mode and and that guy wasn’t even wanted for hitting me. He was bypassing every PvP rule and he was killing me straight away.
---
Bugs that have existed since beta are in Nuclear Winter. They've been reported and been said to have been passed on. But they still exist. All we can do is keep reporting them and hope they get some priority. Good clips.
---
I do actually think the fire is too fast in this game, often you have to forget the fight to get to the last circle. I’d like for you to be able to outrun the fire but only just so you can stop and shoot at enemies etc.
---
Muthafucka that's a sweatshirt. It's like when jeans make it look like you have a boner. I was slightly hunched over my desk. Plus it was a YouTube video, and why are you looking at a post of mine from April just to find a way to make a mediocre insult towards me? That's just pathetic.
---
Camp using the craft station and fermenter
---
If your on ps4 I'll mod it for you I have every mod except the nv scopes
---
AND.... Great stuff from the Atom Shop... Would repair kits have an advantage in Battle Royale from your experience?
---
Psn is BLGWHITEMEXICAN I'll be on tomorrow
---
One of the biggest streamers out there lmao
---
No, another user here was talking about dicks too. I guess we now know you’re also not an original person. What’s trending today in the world of fashion, ya cunt?
---
Jk, back to the game. I forgot which noob you were tbh. You’re all actually the same, just another dumb noob. Oh yeah, you’re the noob who got two kills and made a happy post about it haha. 👏 👏
---
Can't drop cameras =(
---
Technically yes. But other people play solo or in smaller teams.
---
West Tek
---
I never had any mods tried out the game yesterday and today with different graphic settings.
---
After leaving the Vault I keep falling through the map wherever I try to go.
---
There was not 52people running around in skyrim.
---
And game is beautiful on 4k super rig. Of course it is ugly on cheapo PC.
---
You level up your special in adventure mode
---
So it’s acceptable for you all to do it, but not I? And there we go again with the dick references.
---
thanks
---
Will we be able to join factions with these NPCs? Or is that not confirmed, because in the trailer I saw a cult base and a cult member fighting back so idk if factions are coming
---
You absolutely can be successful solo this versus the other 4 player teams but it is a fuckton harder to do so. I've tried maybe a dozen matches solo and while I've made it to the top 5 solo it's mostly though a lot of clever hiding and patience and luck. I like solo in adventure. I like solo in survival. But the 4-man team is definitely the way to go in NW. It's a bit of a learning curve on how to be a good team player but once you figure it out it's great.
---
I didn’t want to like nuclear winter
---
I still don’t enjoy playing it
---
And yet
---
I can’t stop playing it
---
Can you buy repair kits in BR? I'm curious if this would affect the possible outcome in this mode.
---
Nope.
---
Sounds great, thk
---
And If you see any Nuka shine, be sure to drink it because it will give you great buffs.
---
What a shit post
---
Did not know that I'll try it on pc.
---
Some of the Devs do browse the sub. They said so at Bethesda game days.
---
MooMoo lives matter too! Eat more chicken!
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) there’s more where that came from
---
Something like the fishing from WoW-classic would be cool. 
---
Regional fish, seasonal fish, rare fish which can cook for odd effects maybe like short-term mutations.
---
Epic fishing rod weapons...
---
Darn it, stop racking Brian, he doesn't know any more than the rest of us!
---
^or ^*does* ^he?
---
Lol that same dude killed me and my squad with an automatic lever action. Kinda funny but I don't see the point in cheating in this game.
---
Have you tried shutting the Launcher with task manager and restarting it?
---
&gt;Nuka shine,
---
Nuka shine, noted!
---
Doing a robot? xD that would hurt badly
---
Ran into 2 cheaters today, one there was no doubt about it, he killed the whole lobby with in 9 or 10 minutes and my whole team at the exact same time.
---
I wrote his name down but not sure what to do with it.
---
Funny thing is the very next match he was the fill on our 3 man squad. We trashed talked him called his a p.o.s and of course he didnt respond but instead started to fly around the vault. We left the match in the lobby to not be apart of that game. 
---
This is one thing that can and will KILL the game mode, I really hope they figure this out because issues like this usually dont get better, they get worse when left alone. Let's hope Bethesda figures this out.
---
If enemies in adventure weren't so stupid bulletsponges, you could play without stacking damage there too.
---
Oof
---
team doesn't get the intel, no
---
I think you spelt fuck wrong it’s fuck not thank 
---
Naw but they have improved a lot so yeah thanks
---
Welcome to Appalachia, Vault Dweller!
---
You mean you dont like insanely difficult fights in grandmaster that give nothing but shitty blues and purples?!
---
What’s up there?
---
How would that work? Maybe missions that unlock skins?
---
How do you know he has unlimited ammo? Can you spectate player in Nuclear Winter mode?
---
This is it.  This is the moment BSG can generate momentum and, in a sense, reboot the launch.  They did great in E3 and the free trial is VERY successful. Nuclear Winter is a home run and will attract the twitch shooter crowd.   With Amazon pricing physical copies at $17 and other sales out there, there is a good chance we'll see a ton of lowbies running around beyond the trial.  I'm hoping BSG is throwing money at Amazon for extra server space as the first impressions of this game last year nearly destroyed it (constant server crashes, etc.)
---
Well, you're kinda acting weird and somewhat creepy to a minor, but it's been fun watching your karma tank for the last two hours. You can go back to watching whatever weird shit you get off to.
---
sounds like a good thing to me
---
Sorry to disappoint you but there's more than a few lobbies where the overseers office is just as full of naked lunatics fisting each other, it's all about the pervert nook behind the gym now for peace and quiet.
---
I moved my camp to a deposit North of Mononghan. Used a fo76 map app to find a good spot. The real problem is, if you need another resource for bullets you'll have to find that too; I use gauss rifle as my primary so I dont have to worry about gunpowder.
---
Oh yeah same i play on ps4 you can't mod shit on playstation
---
not if those free accounts arent getting banned, if they are able to freely do this unstopped on throw aways, you can sure as hell bet they'll feel secure in using their actual accounts to continue this.
---
That’s weird because during the Fasnacht event the bandstand for sure played true music when all instruments were in use.
---
West Tek as the other guy said is a good place though not always worthwhile, a good Exp farm none the less, I would suggest areas such as Harper's Ferry, the Sundews in the Cranberry Bog (best when in a NUKE region), I've had some great luck at Garrahan Mining Headquarters, found some multi stars in the car park outside many times!! :) Star Chemical can be a good place for them, usually to the Northern area of the location, can be Gulpers from the trees, additionally right above Dyer Chemical is a little place where Super Mutant's hideout, that's always got a couple legendary enemies for me :) hope that helps, happy hunting!!
---
Die again with a single piece of scrap and go collect that one.
---
Andromeda generally, which was just increased by the Quarian DLC really.  For a while, I couldn't really put my finger on what I didn't like as much about Andromeda - whether I'd hyped myself up too much for it, whether it was because I loved the first three so much and it didn't live up to them in my head.  But there was something about it that just wasn't grabbing me.  I did like the map exploration, and was actually a fan of how it worked with the mobile app for sending your squads on missions.  Even tried out the multiplayer which I don't often do with games.  Hearing that they were basically abandoning it just made me really not interested in it any more.
---
It's the same reason I still haven't played Lego Hobbit, the fact that they decided not to finish it really put me off.
---
Do the breach and clear event a few times. Provides loads of material.
---
Companies need to be harder on them and perma ban them all.
---
But caps though
---
ditched my elder paint for black rider in a heart beat, the paladin looks better imo
---
Well yeah I agree engine is bad and its need upgrade or a new one, but game looks beautifull. Comat hasnt really changed much since skyrim and f3/nv true
---
Aren't you glad it was a free trial?
---
Thanks, now I’m gonna use that spot too so when you can’t place your amp you’ll know where to find me 😂
---
While the Ammo workshop is of course an option, I would suggest to invest in the ammosmith perk card (2 ranks, agility, +40%/+80% crafted) as soon as possible if you use lots of ammunition. At level 50+ you can get the super duper perk card for a decent chance to double the outcome of anything crafted.
---
If you need large amounts of steel - the scrapper perk card (intelligence, available at a low level) will help a lot when you scrap weapons.
---
Yeah but.....  ........who?
---
Once Nuclear Winter has been fully released, I'd imagine we'd be able to explore Vault 51 at our leisure in Adventure Mode.
---
Google is your friend
---
masochism is a thing
---
I wonder if we'll get a big faction at some point, especially linked to the previous games.
---
More like nightmare 
---
One of the truly scary moments in game is when you are fighting and then realize you just triggered a long, uninterruptible animation.
---
Very unpopular, at least before BR came to town.
---
But we all know that the reddit crowd is fickle and prone to turning on a dime.
---
In the height of the TSE 'debacle' there were a few dissenting voices, mine included, that were quickly silenced under the weight of the 'you are wrong becuase I say you are'.
---
We posited that balancing a game that had PvP, PvE, coop and solo with hocus-pocus wasteland magic effects thrown into the mix was not impossible but a mammoth task that could be altogether bypassed by... vanishing magic and balancing things based on more predictable parameters.
---
Reason being, if you balance based on the existence of legendary effects for anyone 'without' encounters are just bullet-sponge fests.
---
If you balance despite the existence of legendary effects for anyone 'with' 99% of the encounters are trivialised.
---
If you go for striking a true balance is going to take a titanic effort and every time you try to introduce something new you have all the 'magical mumbo-jumbo' cross-interactions to take into consideration.
---
However, if you balance everything right and do away with the 'endless quest for better loot' you are going to have to churn a lot of content to keep people entertained.
---
Cue BR. Maybe the answer you were looking for? Maybe there is method in the dev's madness after all.
---
Maybe the answer is not making everything play by BR rules but enjoy the BR rules in BR.
---
Yeah I'm noticing that, I'm only level 20 now, and I hate this game mode so... damn... much. But I really really want hellfire armor.
---
Lmao
---
And don't forget to lick out every single drop of the bottle for best effect. When everything turns blue then it's right.
---
All ready happened in Far Harbor my dude.
---
What system? I can probably replace some of it if I pull it out of my vendor. No charge.
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Hello, Sanjay here!
---
How can you forget that?
---
This is exactly what I do. Can usually make about 800 lead after breaking the ore down with super duper active also.
---
I've tried shutting down the whole computer and restarting and didnt work
---
You're severely limited by ram in this case, everythibg else should provide medium quality. I'd go and grab a stick of ram for 16gb.
---
Right, I mean I'm not saying it's not enough for my crafting needs, it definitely is. It's more about making it harder for me to collect things like legendary weapons that I don't really feel like using right now, but I may want to possibly use later on, so I don't really wanna trow them out.
---
That's just one example, there are load of things like that in the game and at that point it becomes frustrating, when I have to decide if I want to throw out, say, 2000 steel to make a room for a weapon that I just may use in the future. Of course steel is very abundant in the game, but it just feels like a shame to me to throw out this resource that I've collected, if that makes sense.
---
Also with the game constantly updating, there is always the chance that something will be added that utilizes a abundant resource like steel in very large quantities and at that point I may look back and regret throwing out that 2k of steel so I could keep a weapon I never ended up using anyway. So it's things like that, where each time I'm making room for things, there's this in the back of my mind, and I know it's silly, but regardless it is there and it makes the game just a little frustrating.
---
How? Genuinely curious, not being a dick.
---
"improved significantly" Lol, this comunity have really low standards.
---
Dont worry about it, i recently acquired plenty of scrap from some guy who kept shooting me, then ran like a little girl when i started shooting back and leaped to his death in Arktos Pharma.
---
I'm seriously glad you guys didn't give up, after that insane negativity even few months after the launch. Was the negativity deserved? Some of it, of course. Releasing game for a full price in a broken state is wrong. But you guys admitted your mistakes and started working on fixing them, even though basically everyone on on social media including reddit was against you, except for this sub. That's something you don't see every day in gaming industry. 
---
I'm glad this is more like NMS situation (altough F76 was more playable and fun on release) than Anthem situation. 
---
And you've fixed so many things since release, added new content and even more is coming. Seriously, you guys deserve praise for this.
---
I'm just kinda sad subs like r/games still have hate boner against this game, without even trying it since it's release. They act like they haven't ever done anything wrong and then tried to fix it.
---
By lever 20 you're pushing into bigger level areas, and are more likely to run into a situation you're not prepared for and have that survival tension
---
Update 3 camps in a row have vendor blocked me got him again only to get the hat only rip
---
Just saw your name.. do you play ultimate or disc golf by chance?
---
From a fourm response
---
There are a few different things that could be causing your download in the launcher to get stuck. Here are a few troubleshooting steps you can take that may allow the download to proceed.
---
1. Install the game to the same drive as the Bethesda.net launcher or if installing to a different drive, ensure that the drive that your launcher is installed on has enough space, even though the game will be installing elsewhere.
---
2. Add exceptions in your anti-virus and firewall programs. The application files that may require exceptions are:
---
Bethesda.net_launcher: C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda.net Launcher.exeQuakeChampions.exe: C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda.net Launcher\games\Fallout76

Can do on Friday evening (UK time). Psn: BekR321
---
You're breathtaking
---
5 level 3 perks of the same stat?
---
This, 20+lvl super muties are too much of bulletsponges, for how much you must kill them and how weak are weapon on that level.
---
Just regular frisbee.
---
Issue is, photomode doesn't let you take a picture when the gallery is full, unlike the camera.
---
And it is required for a Possum badge
---
Fall 2019, no exact date given
---
Anthem was such a shame, an ironman simulator that was beautiful, but it was only skin deep. Such a shame.
---
Yeah I was going to say enemies/players health aren't the same in NW.
---
NW Crossbow should fire 3 times before reloading
---
Next week bro
---
My nearest UPS store is like 2 miles away, so I'll probably just pay the $3.50 and pick it up
---
Or maybe make the hub a permanent area that players load into with team. Then ready for a match to begin search.
---
With ya on that. No joke, I've been only getting duplicates the past 12 perk packs opened. I don't even have many perks, just constantly getting some of the ones I have already.
---
Bro had one of these dude on my team tell me he uses CHEAT ENGINE to hack. WTF?! Even Roblox has some anti hack protection how is this even remotely acceptable?!
---
&gt;However, if you balance everything right and do away with the 'endless quest for better loot' you are going to have to churn a lot of content to keep people entertained.
---
Realistically, they still do have to churn out content even with legendaries and what not in the game. Yeah grinding for better loot is "content" but its not fun content. It's not engaging or enjoyable content. It is exciting for like, 2 seconds when it drops but that's about it.
---
A way to fix that? I'm not sure. Like, do you just add infinitely repeatable content or just content that takes for ever to complete. Either way I'm glad you brought that up because it's something I am really hoping Bethesda figures out soon, the drip fed content is better than no content but it does get old fast to where I am at the point where I would rather just take a break for a few months and come back to see what's new rather than sticking around.
---
Yeah, like i have shotgun, heavy gun, rifles, pistol damage perks, but that is all what is good. First two days it was ok, because nobody had much perk cards, but now people are starting to have strong builds, which is unfair, as i got atleast 6duplicate cards (50XPs...)
---
There are some seriously stubborn holdouts though. 
---
I wonder if Youtube has come around. They were the vanguard for all the (much deserved) 76 hate at launch. They didn't seem too impressed during the E3 presentation.
---
Talon company cow bodyguards
---
I agree with one thing and that is all guns should be end game viable. I think you need to realise that you don’t need to min max the damage of your whole arsenal. Spread your special points out so you can use all types of weapons. You say yourself you don’t like the one shot gameplay. Change the way you play, worry less about how everyone else plays, don’t follow the meta blaze your own trail you will have more fun 🤗.
---
We all have our parts to play!
---
Even if it's just a supporting role or as bait. Can mean the difference between your team winning or losing if done right 😁
---
I loved that story.
---
What? You mad? Lol
---
Yeah whatever CUCK. Get back to watching GOT reaction videos and AOC speeches. #MAGA
---

---
Follow the main quest for a while, which will take you on a generally southward direction. This will help introduce you to the basic mechanics in the game and give you some of the essential building plans that you'll need for your camps, like beds and water purifiers. 
---
Though, you may want to take a long detour to a farm in the northwest corner of the map. It's got a lot of crops you harvest to plant in your own camps, but - more importantly - it's one of the few places you can get to easily at low levels that have cranberries. The basic cranberry recipe gives you +5% experience, so if you're eating that and sleeping regularly, you'll have a +10% xp bonus as you're running around.
---
Thank you for not giving up on the game.
---
 ***"Greetings. Fisto is programmed to please."***
---
Stalkers is highly useful for sneak builds. Not in combat yet, insta-kill sneak attack. Paired with chameleon armor and you're golden
---
depends on the build you want and the cards you pick.
---
&gt;n everything turns 
---
Ok, Now I'm thinking it might be a better idea not to drink that, lol
---
It's already been said a bunch of times before in this thread, but thank you so, so much for sticking with it. Launch was definitely rough but y'all have really turned it around.
---
I can't wait to see where we go from here. Ever upwards, as they say ;)
---
The problem with that is it's a multiplayer game. Normally I am one to just play whatever sounds like the most fun. But what about if I wanted to play in survival mode?  I would need a one-shot build to compete at all.
---
Even in adventure mode there is a problem where some people can just one shot 3 star legendaries meaning I get no loot whatsoever because I didn't have a chance to tag it.
---
Not to mention that arguably spreading special points like that gimps your character in other ways. Like if you had one perk point in pistols, another in rifles, another in heavy, etc that is less perk points that you could be putting into utility cards such as lockpicking, gunsmith, science etc. ( which is another reason I am on board for passive perk cards Bethesda :D )

wish the exp gains were a tiny bit higher for being in places 2,3,4 and 5 as well as for surviving and i'd be fully satisfied with the gains for adventure mode
---
I think some mods cannot be learn from scrapping and have to be bought and learn from plans. Try the train station vendor bot near top of the world, they have all sorts of plans. I had to buy the different caliber plans for my hunting rifle there, not sure if the combat rifle mod plans are tho, but there was a lot of plans so worth the shot.
---
Gimp.
---
You have about 5-10 minutes in the vault as you create your character then you're free to join up together.
---
Thanks! That sounds like a solid one!
---
The perk cards you get are random, so it's not like there's a perfect build. It depends on what you've gotten from the perk card packs
---
You start in Vault 76. Where you create tour character and you're given some basic supplies and are "encouraged" to leave by Mr. Handy robots. In that time you can be placed in the same server, kr join your friend after leaving the vault. Your call.
---
What platform are you guys playing on?
---
(also since you replied as I was editing my post, I just wanted to be sure you saw the part about getting some early legendary items too).
---
Welcome to a br... Smh...its every br not just fo76..apex is proly the worst.
---
It has to be basic builds, walls and foundation, defenses like the "quick wall" and turrets need to be found
---
Just came here to ask same question, if not,  let’s make one!
---
I mean it says that its pre beta.. give them time and instead of demanding just bring it to their attention. They'll do the best they can I'm sure because they know if they dont people will leave NW in droves which is not good for them or players.
---
Yeah I really am tbh. I'm also really sad though because I'd happily buy it if it was anything even close to just a 2015 game. But for 2019 the state of this game is unacceptable and I'm really worried about future Bethesda titles.
---
I get it. Your only one session away from a max box full of junk tho. Im going to delete one of my characters cause i was totaly messing around with funzies perks when i should of started a build.
---
Going for 3 char and have the other 2 just hold 1800 lbs of legandays haha. Now if only i could mail myself something.. Even if it was 20 lbs a day or something. I got 2 shottys on my rifleman and a quad gauss on my shotty guy haha. Damn it
---
Nope its November they announced it a the Ea conference
---
It has some good lighting and I loved all the colour and fall trees and stuff totally agree. But it also has some shockingly horrible textures and graphical issues unfortunately.
---
&gt;  I used boiled water until I realized that boiled water is heavier than purified water. 
---
Add to the list of things I never noticed in 119 levels and &gt;400 hours.
---
Would also be pretty funny, if youwere just looking for food to fish with a bug zapper. You would get low rarity fish, but in a bigger quantity. I kinda think it would fit the fallout theme.
---
This is really sweet to read! The latest updates to FO76 have been some of the best I’ve ever seen in games. Nuclear Winter is some of the most fun I’ve ever experienced in a game! Thanks BGS for everything! :)
---
I'm on PC, was more wondering about the sale in the Bethesda Launcher
---
Thank you, have a nice day :)
---
I want a general build so I can build anything in the camp, workbenches, and able to lockpick any lock and hack any computer.
---
He was distributing the wealth
---
That's kind thx! 😊
---
Wish i could say my role is more medic than bait.
---
Gatling gun is more precise.
---
Minigun is crazy gun that will tickle you to death in seconds.
---
79mm granade launcher is "TEAM DESTROYER".
---
I agree with you , heavy weapons are overpowered.
---
Bethesda this error has occurred both PC and PS4 
---
I'd submitted a ticket, still in progression so far. Nice support service, but still cant find a solution for this error every time you quit the world.
---
Bathesda support: I'd tried power cycling, reboot ps4, delete saved game, DNS number changing, internet testing, but it doesnt work at all. I need technical solutions, not search in Google.
---
Im waiting for next suggestion from Bethesda Support. 
---
While Im typing here I cant even login anymore, I wonder may be this is the end.
---
Take your time some mods tend to unlock when you scrap a bunchof them so it might take a while
---
Idiot.
---
I understand it's random but still if I need o points in a single perk for a desirable card I need to know that ahead of time.
---
The perception perk for non auto rifles is 3 also.. master rifleman or something like that I believe
---
Can't believe he was born in 1927 as well.
---
You're right, probably why on Skyrim the FPS was manageable. Then again even the unofficial skyrim online mode ran better than this. Anything looks beautiful on 4K, an infected toe would look gorgeous as all hell that doesn't mean much at all. The fact of the matter is that every single game from basically 2011 onwards looks better than 76 does in 2019 and that's unacceptable for an AAA game that has done next to nothing to push the game forward in other areas to compensate.
---
Top tip, banked. Thanks
---
but do you know if i have to be a certain level?
---
😯
---
This is why I bought the game on PS4.

The thing people like missing on PC but that can also lead to cheaters. Are PC players willing to give up modding to fix this?
---
No, thank *you*. You've done a fantastic job on the game. Please send our regards to all the devs over at Austin and Maryland who worked their butts off on making and improving this, and a special than you to Jeff and Todd too. Todd might not have been game director this time, but I still really appreciate him taking the flak and owning up to the game's issues like that, it was admirable. Love you guys. Really excited for what this game holds in the future, as well as Starfield and TES VI.
---
Literally minutes ago as of this comment a buddy I was in discord with was looting while I was on a loading screen
---
Because almost everything you wrote is bullshit.
---
&gt; I couldn’t think of an animal in the natural world that exhibits socialist tendencies
---
Meerkats.
---
Not going to lie I was being facetious. 
---
I've been playing since launch over 850 hours in. I guess I just love Fallout titles enough to ignore the quirks that have always been. This title has made leaps and bounds to better gameplay, I'm sorry your views are different. 
---
Yes the story was shallow, but it is growing and being expanded soon with NPCs. There is even a BR knockoff to entertain when you get tired of grinding. 
---
Surprisingly, the perk system is very deep in this title. No longer can you run everything and be an absolutely badass, you will have a weakness and can always be beat by something. The whole thing is give and take. 
---
Sure, some bugs that are still present should not be there. Admittedly, some bugs were patched and came back with the recent update but if you have been around since launch you know it happens every update and a week later they iron them out. 
---
My point is Bethesda is actually listening to their community this time. Hearing feedback and implementing solutions. 
---
I'm sorry you feel differently but glad it was a free trial for you. Take care and hope another title has what you are searching for.
---
You can go through the challenges, maybe it'll say something about how many you have to scrap.
---
 Skeleton on a motorcycle. How thoughtful.
---
Why would you lock a r/darkjokes post you poo
---
That's not saying much though let's be real here...
---
What platform are you?
---
i don’t think it’ll be so many tho but do you know if you have to be a certain level ?
---
On a related note, Train Stations are your friends. That's where the vendors hang out. There are two main factions of vendors - Responders and Raiders. Generally a good idea to check in with both factions periodically since they had different inventories. 
---
The Train Stations also have stash boxes, which connect to your camp, so you can dump stuff you want to keep there instead of heading all the way home or gather up supplies that you have stored. They have one workbench, so you can scrap your junk and unwanted items too. Depending on the bench, you might be able to make and repair items there too.
---
There's also a bulletin board at the train stations with (currently) three posters up. One of these will start the quest to teach you how to make nukashine and other alcoholic drinks. One starts the quest to get the backpack. The third is a missing persons mystery you have to solve.
---
Too bad nothing can fix the terrible game engine from 2008 😔
---
Some people cheat just to win. They can't tell the difference between winning legit or while cheating. Its just a tool to win to them.
---
A problem I find is that the lower level areas are harder level capped so high level players won't make the enemies max level. When you get to the 20-40 level areas you are likely to encounter lvl 68 ghouls from high level players having passed through and you are ill equpped to handle that. Those areas are still giving a high level character something to do, for variety.
---
Try boosting your intelligence when you scrap
---
I dont know but i doubt that weapon mods that are obtained by scrapping are tied to any level.
---
Power tower?
---
If you have 3 points in rifles, that’s where your points come from take one out and shove it in pistols don’t gimp your utility. Also things like science don’t use them all the time only when crafting or needed, you will have way more points to play with. Pve is one thing pvp is another destiny tried to balance both together and ruined the game so I stopped playing. Warframe balances them apart and the pvp is so confusing it’s unplayable. You can be effective without using the meta use your skills and your cunning(which is way more satisfying anyway👍).
---
ok thank you
---
huh. Is fallout 76 just a prelude to fallout 5?
---
like they're building a future virginia based on our actions in 76?
---
will do but would i have to be a certain level to make this maybe
---
Bethesda does have the manpower, but not the will to use it as about 80% of their devs are making Starcraft and only the Austin team is working on 76, and they are a very small team. [Wiki page for them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Game_Studios_Austin)
---
I don't get on with the GG. The DPS + RANGE of the 50 cal may be the issue, just hose down those escarpments zero problem.
---
If bethesda asked me I would say add more cone or recoil like the unusable assault rifle that jumps all over the place.
---
Yep! Got Shotgun Master 6 time I think! Pretty ridiculous...
---
But they're not wrong? It SHOULD have been in at launch and it's not okay it wasn't.
---
I don’t think so
---
This also just helped save my camp's roof, thanks so much!
---
thank you anyway
---
Wish I could move my char from pc to console :( 
---
4 games all the games were won by someone who had no spread on bullets and were locking on to people with the crosshair ....
---
It was poo repost
---
Yeah I kind of figured afterwards, when I thought about your predicament. Because for example, if ironclad is a perk and it's 5 points in endurance. You'd definitely want to that, but I'm not sure if it is.
---
I get what you mean. And I agree it would be good to know what's perk are possible.
---
It's t0xic
---
Cough Fallout isn't a BR cough
---
I like to think that instead of it being lore breaking, it’s suggesting that these things you’ve seen elsewhere aren’t the only instances. Obviously it’s tricky when it comes to design marvels like the hellfire armor, but with the outcasts, I see no reason why people living in Appalachia now can’t want to be Brotherhood, but go in a different direction to the majority... like separatists.... like outcasts.  I think people get too fixated on lore continuity, pick what you want to be canon and just have fun.
---
No Bethesda, thank you for crafting such a welcoming experience. Even if my updates take forever to download, that just means that I'm more excited to start the new stuff.
---
That’s interesting because assuming other players can collect NPCs we could have multiple of the same character within sight of one another.
---
Damn that's a small line between appalachilli and being a murder.
---
I would milk it to avoid both troubles.
---
I've been playing for 3 days now with my GF, and we havn't run into a single person that attempted to communicate :(
---
Not that we've really run into many people at all, usually only see 6-7 on the entire map.
---
Melee weapons with Stalker's have 95% chance to hit.
---
Melee weapons without Stalker's have 95% chance to hit.
---
Yeah, I can totally see the usefulness.
---
&gt;  the strange thing is that I was in pacifist mode and and that guy wasn’t even wanted for hitting me
---
You being in pacifist mode has nothing to do with anything.  All pacifist mode does is makes it impossible for *you* to damage other players.
---
We will be playing on PC, streaming it on Twitch too, around 2 PM EST. Thank you for the hint about legendary equipment!
---
For lockpick and Hacking you only need 3 points in Int. and Per. and you can swap the cards in and out same with all other building cards. I would focus on a weapon build. For example, i run a Riflemen build. I can have most building cards but the only one equiped most of the time is Gun smith. 
---
I run.  S6 P13 E3 C4 I8 A13 L8 - i\`m missing 1 point somewhere :) but you get the idea i think.
---
Bait can be just as important if not more. 
---
My buddy isn't much for stealth. She just likes to rush everywhere, making a ruckus the whole way. At first i would try and get her to crouch, slow down, try and be stealthier, but she won't listen. It's just not her playstyle. 
---
So now that i know better, i use it to my advantage. I just let her do her thing and i hang back a bit. Soon as bullets start flying, enemy gives away their positions and allows me to take them out. And if we're lucky, she's still alive or at most just downed and i can revive her and keep going.
---
That’s so odd. Just wondering did anyone have any mods running? I heard Bethesda said mods wouldn’t be supported in NW for now and I’m wondering if this could have been a factor?
---
We always believed in them, as Todd Howard said.
---
NO, YOU'RE BREATHTAKING!
---
I don't understand why people keep on insisting that legendary effects should be disabled... It basically defeats the purpose of even using them! Survival mode shouldn't be a cake walk... but at the same time reasonable balance should also exist. I think there are better ways to implementing balance for this mode without taking away the awesomeness of top tier gear.
---
Step 1, find someone who isn't a zombie.
---
Step 2, find someone who doesn't ignore other lifeforms. 
---
Been playing off and on all week, really want to buy the game. But I've yet to find people who aren't just running around aimlessly like No One else exists.
---
Im in high 30s and it takes about 3 good games to level
---
Sorry if I wasn't on. Wasn't dodging you or anyone else. Just went to bed super early.
---
Bye 👋 👋
---
You can generally get by with lower intelligence then. It's mainly for building and hacking, but you can swap out the perks you need for that as you go. For my current character, I'm aiming for Intelligence 5 to run fully upgraded Makeshift Warrior constantly.
---
Of course, if you want to eventually rely a lot of on power armor, then having high intelligence is good. There's a lot of INT perks that you'll want to keep on all the time in that case.
---
Did... did you just use CS:GO as an example of good anti-cheat measures? Dude, casual is FULL of cheaters and I had a ranked Comp match once that turned into Hacks v Hacks. Who the fuck are you kidding? lmao CS:GO is terrible about hacking.
---
Tnx for not giving up
---
I am not 100% certain, but I think all ammo changing receivers are plans or mods only. Not obtainable via scrapping the weapon. There was a comprehensive list of mods somewhere in reddit, with chances to obtain them via scrapping. It wouldn't hurt to check it.
---
Yeah I think you’re right because one of the terminals in vault 51 talks about a new prototype X-02 PA set.
---
thanks i’ll check it out
---
I just hope we can have them man the buildable little guard bunkers and stuff like fo4
---
I also love getting bonus xp, even though it's very little, for when you get duplicates in NW. I'm only lvl 7 but I've had three duplicats. It's a small comfort, but still a comfort.
---
I kill cows
---
For the lazy ones:

---
Well a few things. You said you killed each other back and forth so you clearly weren't in pacifist the whole time. So either he seeked revenge on you and you threw on pacifist, there's a glitch or you killed yourself with your own mutations (it happens). I've been over 200 levels with every mutation that causes the melee reaction and it has never caused PvP in pacifist because it's not designed to unless you are already in a dual which you said yourself you were.
---
hope u enjoy your fki n BR mod, children. i knew bethesda f\*\*ked up but i havent imagined that badly hahahahahah
---
Well you seem proud about this good effort
---
Imagine several groups of 4 people, each with their own NPC follower meeting somewhere in the forest or Mire where there is dense foliage and heavy fog/particle effects. 
---
I think that would cause every system, even those not connected to that server or playing Fallout 76 to just start chugging.
---
do you have a link to this reddit by any chance/ what is it called
---
Cool, I'm on PC too, but I'll probably be just signing off as you're logging on. I'll have to check the twitch stream to see how your first session went later if you'll have the video up still.
---
Thank YOU Bethesda for not pulling Anthem and for not giving up on the game and the community. Not giving up shows everyone that the game WASN'T the cheap "cashgrap" as the trolls wanted everyone to believe. It shows us that you wanted to make the game and that you wanted to make it happen, no matter how many bumps (as Todd would say) are on the way. All this shows that many issues with the game were honest rookie mistakes. Mistakes that were fixed quite quickly if they became serious. Honestly, it blows my mind how blind people can get when seeing the game through their dogmatic "Bethesda Bad" lenses. The game is quite smooth and stable, in a non-Bethesda way (if you excuse the jab). You are really dedicated to fixing it, which doesn't sound like the image of company that never fixes their games (like many would want us to believe). On the other hand, grabbing all the fixes made for the Unofficial Patch mods and releasing them as bugfix patch for Skyrim, Fallout 4, Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 would grant you tons of goodwill, I'm sure of that. Also, if you could take the engine fixes made for Fo76 and backport them to Fo4 and SSE, that would be amazing...
---
You also did something rare these days - you've managed to fulfill your roadmap so far. "Roadmap" is nowadays a word quite hated by the gamers, because often it comes out as an empty promise. Cheap PR to silence any issues and give the community ammo to fight any criticism (like "Why are you angry that the game doesn't have X? They clearly show it on the roadmap for next summer"). Anthem roadmap? Gone. Epic Gaming Store roadmap? What a joke... Roadmaps of various kickstarter projects? Usually delayed even by years. Compared to those roadmaps, your roadmap is solid. And one more thing. You didn't give in to chearp PR and didn't overpromise in the roadmap. You have Wastelanders as big update on the roadmap, but you've never overhyped it. You could have said "We are going to have NPCs in autumn, just you wait!" with big NPC label slapped on the roadmap, but you didn't. Thank you!
---
Well, not everything has been rookie mistakes. The canvas bag fiasco is unexcusable, but that's not the fault of the developers who make the game. Many people are too single minded, but we can appreciate different parts of a company differently. I love the developers of Bethesda (you), but I'd be very wary to order anythign physical. I also dislike the repair kits. Not because it's pay to win (it's P2W in the loosest possible definition anyway), but because it's a broken promise that Atom shop will be cosmetic only. It eroded my trust in you, but now the Nuclear Winter mode and Wastelanders DLC more or less helped to regain that trust. Still, repair kits are a useless addition, when put in the atom shop.
---
Anyway, I really love the game. I had a blast at lauch despite the issues and it quickly surpassed WoW as my more frequently played MMO. During January I slowly moved back to WoW, but then the Wild Appalachia updates made me come back to the game and play basically daily again. I especially love the vending machines update, the more strick Pacifist modes and more boss fights (both fake and real Sheepsquatches) These have really put a big MMO aspect into the game. I really hope that with the Wastelanders update, there will be more focus on community cooperation within chosen factions. I want to rebuild something with other player. To have a shared effort, like the original Gates of Ahn'Quiraj in WoW. To truly experience the "Rebuild America" motto.
---
Speaking of WoW (and rambling a little bit more). The way the game plays really reminds me of Vanilla WoW. Vanilla WoW (and upcomming Classic) have nowadays accessibility issues due to outdated mechanics and designs, but the core is still solid. As Vanilla WoW, Fallout 76 is about the journey. About a goal we choose every day to fulfill. Not because of a checklist of activities presented to us by the game... In a way Fallout 76 is in spirit more Vanilla WoW than Classic, because it allows me relive the experience and the joy with new content. Classic will never be Vanilla WoW for me, because I've already played Vanilla WoW. Classic is used or recycled Vanilla WoW experience. Fallout 76 is a fresh and new Vanilla WoW experience.
---
Were terrible but that's what they get for making a broken game at launch
---
Don't do the missing kid quest given by the nanny bot until youre level 50+.
---
Save your caps.
---
Scrap everything after looting. Sell all crap guns. Find a class you like and tinker with the perk cards. 
---
Mole miners are a great source of black titanium. Sentry bots are a good source of fusion cores.  And buy plans from players. You'll save a lot of caps.
---
Don't steal from player camps.. Youre gonna have a bad time if you do
---
Take your time, and enjoy the Forest. There is no need to rush through the questlines. I got to the final Responders quest (Firefighter) and left it for a week or so, as I needed to level up a little further. 
---
Don't worry about dying! It'll happen a lot in the early levels. Just respawn, track down your junk and carry on. 
---
The key point - have fun!  Most of the players are friendly, and will happily help you out if they are nearby.
---
That's the code I get when it's on my end, usually a shit connection at my router.  I have no idea if that is what that code means, I just know that's the correlation I have for that.
---
So don't play NW, enjoy the other two modes.  Problem solved.
---
Lol I wish it was that sadly Xbox is hardwired and only game it happens on or even remotely has issues on is fo76 oh well thoughXD
---
This made me lol
---
I was able to fix the problem by having us both change servers! Not sure if it works every time.
---
Odd.  I'm on XBox as well and it's rare that I have issues getting in.
---
Thank you! We've yet to die but we haven't faced many enemies just yet, a few mole rats and farmhand bots oh and those little commie robots! But yeah was a pleasant surprise seeing how passive everyone is so far, we've come from playing red dead so were on edge when people were around.
---

This should be it.
---
Ill keep it in mind next time it happens.
---
Did you upgrade the perks? The option becomes available if you have multiple of the same...
---
In full disclosure: We're still trying to figure it out.
---
The bomber jacket is from technical data only but it’s quite comely dropped
---
I have one for sale on PS4
---
I’m bummed that all the BOS paint is for T-60 when in this game all the Brotherhood wore was T-51b...
---
I assume you're playing adventure. I'm glad you had a good experience. Most higher levels are glad to help, but their will be a few rotten apples from time to time. Most never experience griefers, but here is something to keep in mind in case you do.
---
In Adventure, as long as you don't shoot back, they cannot hurt you. Even if they are constantly attacking you, just ignore them, it will pass. Don't fall for the bait, unless of course you want to try a little PvP action. On that note, claiming a workshop will open you up to PvP if another player contests the workshop regardless if you shoot back or not.
---
Take your time to explore the region, don't rush the main quest. Their are tons of side quests and events and places to explore. Refer to map linked below as a level reference. Try staying within those regions until you've leveled up enough, otherwise you might have issues down the road with enemies being to difficult to handle.
---
https://cdn.gearnuke.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fallout-76-zone-map-level-range.png
---
&gt;  I don't think it'll ever feel like a Fallout wasteland with PvP.
---
Of course it feels like a Fallout wasteland.  As you implicitly point out it feels like a Fallout wasteland, but this time you get to play one of the NPCs, not the usual Fallout protagonist.
---
Ohhhhh no really I didn't know that's how private chat party worked oh no....gtfo if you don't know that you probably shouldn't have a console
---
Noted, thanks! I wouldn't have thought of stealing from camps but is there anything we should do to prevent it happening to us? 
---
Good tip with the plans! We were actually going to start finding out how to get them.
---
It's been like that because it was bugged so they disabled it.
---
You can get them from turning in technical data, I've had a few. Not sure about anywhere else though.
---
I spent a good bit of time last night sat at the overseer’s camp in my nurse outfit handing out care packages :)
---
I dont have any multiples. I was saving my points for specific perks for the build I'm going for
---
Downthread you mentioned not wanting to pair with a dude-bro. Saying you don’t want to play hyper competitive is a more polite way of saying you want to pair up with a more mature and level player. Unfortunately your post makes you come across as less than level. Ask for what you actually want. Do you want to play with serious players or do you want to flirt with chicks? Own it.
---
,:')
---
I've got a couple of Technical Data but I haven't started any BoS quests yet
---
If you move your cursor to the "Trade" emote, it should give you a pop-out menu to choose the "Gift" emote.
---
thank you . you cannot learn it through scrapping apparently
---
Like I dont have gunsmith , commando , etc
---
Hmm I couldn’t figure it out - I’ll try again ...
---
Don't be so butthurt. There are people who will burn out of zone, no matter you told them 3times to move.
---
Luckily I’ve stayed away from most Fo76 gameplay and story. All I know is that endgame is nukes and Scorchbeast. I’m really looking forward to the story tbh.
---
Can't come soon enough, now the pvpers are sorted.....can't wait!
---
Yeah I've a couple of Technical Data but I haven't started any BoS quests.
---
The perks that were derisory to unlock at certain levels never unlocked either
---
I'll probably still be romancing myself.
---
This ain't 1956 kid
---
I'm on the PS4 what's your PSN and how much will sell it for please?
---
Oh damn that's wicked! I'll definitely be using the map, thank you! But yeah I'm not sure we're going to be so pvp focused, good to know they can't do anything to us. I think we'll try our hand at exploring the area a bit before getting too far into the main quest so good to hear there's side quests to do. Thanks again!
---
Yes, but please, never launch a game in this state again
---
For food and water, I personally like making corn soup, all it takes is just corn and boil water and it'll replenish both food and water for you. You can plant those at your camp and if use your green thumb perk, it'll let you harvest twice the amount. 
---
fast travel is nice, but cost a lot of caps in the beginning cause it's kinda hard to come by so keep in mind your camp, your team's camps, and your friend position, and vault 76 are always free fast travel.
---
If you like exploring and checking out details, take your time and look around. Bethesda has always been great at telling a story using the environment, sometimes me and my wife just walk at random direction to see if we can find anything interesting. Usually runs into silly things like teddy bears doing something or what not
---
Fallout 76 has the option though
---
Sure! You mean i picked that credit on the house, car and loan from granny for nothing?
---
Nah but seriously, i have my own opinion about the repair kits as of the total handling with atomic shop, i also kind of understand the point of Beth, not have to agree with but could imagine they remember the backlash from repair kits.
---
All in all - future knows best.
---
Are you cool with 600 caps?
---
My solution would be a bit more extreme to please both sides (who want legendaries and the ones who don’t):
---
You can use legendaries in survival but when you die you drop the last weapon you used and one piece of armor you wore. At this point it’s up to you to decide if you want to go around with legendaries and being OP but once you die risking to drop your stuff or going around balanced with weapons you don’t mind losing.
---
Also make sure you turn on pacifist mode so you won't accidentally attack someone and engage in a pvp. Sometimes when fighting together with players, you can easily accidentally hit em
---
And Amazon! One day shipping with prime
---
I can't add it if you're not 100%. Just to clarify, this is NW cards only.
---
WHY ON EARTH IS THERE A LIST OF BEST SEX GAMES MENTIONED IN THAT ARTICLE?!
---
if there is a camp there he will spawn at the other end of the upper train bridge.
---
master rifleman, 3 perception, +40% damage to non auto rifles
---
tenderiser, 9 charisma, 15% damage. I want to say longer than adventure, but can't confirm time, will reply/edit this when i get on tonight
---
couple more will edit/reply in that aren't on there. good post, will be nice to fill this out completely
---
&gt;I'll have to check the twitch stream to see
---
I'm sure it will be lots of fun! More likely than not due to our noobie clumsiness. I love exploring new worlds and the feeling of learning how to play by the rules of it so regardless I will enjoy it. Oh yes, this is my channel: twitch.tv/ReneChiquete
---
Battle Royale can make anything popular. I guess we'll have battle royale in Elder Scrolls before too long now.
---
&gt; Went from having 80 weight to 450. I panick waddle towards my camp
---
The cowards way is to quickly quit the game if you're ahead, move to adventure mode, get back to your camp and save your loot.
---
One other thing, if you've hit level 5, change your setting to pacifist. You won't hurt other players by accident!
---
So did you never put a point into any SPECIAL at all? I'm so confused as to what you tried
---
Well obviously, but where do we make a line? 5? 10? 15? 20? People got different skill ceiling - but they shoudn't fly nor clip though geometry.
---
Yeah it's true. I myself definitely jumped the gun before I had even played it.
---
I didn't get an option to put points into SPECIAL. And the onky perks i have are the ones from perk packs.
---
I sent you a pm there of all the ones I've found so far :) just double checked them all also, thanks for the post.
---
The cards come available when you distribute the point to that level. So a level 10 card will only be available after 9 points are distributed.
---
But... that's part of the fun ;)
---
Ill add you later. Thank you man.
---
So I have to waste points on perks I wont use ?
---
Hey, I resemble that!
---
My biggest survival mistake so far -- entering survival mode but forgetting to turn pacifist off.  Luckily I got away with it, but I came out in a cold sweat when I suddenly remembered.
---
Can you thank us with double xp? It takes 20 scorched beasts, an arm and a leg to level up once
---
I just want to start by giving some personal suggestions that i think can please the majority of the community. Broadly speaking there are 3 categories of FO76 players:
---
1.	⁠Hardcore PvE: are those players not interested in PvP at all and they wish it wasn’t even implemented. They are interested only in the story, collecting, trading and stuff like that (and god bless them). They are the ones always ready to help you and offer a warm place to rest and get your shit together.
---
2.	⁠Hardcore PvP: are the ones who play the game mostly for challenging, annoying or showing their superiority to others (god bless them too, i guess). They give some spice to this game, if they kill you and steal all your junk it’s a legit aspect of this game. Don’t hate the player, hate the game.
---
3.	⁠Players like me that want a healthy dose of both of them. Players that like to play Fallout and progress through a more challenging environment and not the godmode sanbox the current PvE is where dying has no consequences and you inevitably only get better and better.
---
So how to create a system that can please most players at once? There is no need of drastic changes, just small things, but a lot of them. The perfect Survival in my opinion (and feel free to criticize me) should:
---
•	⁠Give more reasons to join Survival beside the pure PvP. +20% XP is a good start, but it should add something more, like a higher percentage of Legendaries spawn, higher rewards for completing quests and events and 3 stars should drop a guaranteed 3 star item to push other players into survival that are not entirely interested in PvP.
---
•	⁠Killing/destroying “innocent” players/camps for no reason should have more serious consequences. If you kill someone out of the blue without him attacking back, it should put a bounty of 50 caps on you for each player killed that way. PvE players should be more protected because if they keep being killed without fighting back those 50 caps add up and the griefer becomes a juicy target for the entire server. Kill 6 innocent players that don’t want to fight back? No problem, if you want PvP the entire server will come at you to claim those 300 caps and if you die you lose that amount. If you have less than that amount you go in debt and the caps you will earn from that moment on will go to pay the debt. If you attack someone and he fights back then it’s just normal PvP, no crimes committed therefore no bounties.
---
•	⁠You shouldn’t be marked on the map for being in top 3 or for having a bounty. At best there can be an “area” that gives a rough idea of where the player is.
---
•	⁠Legendary armor/weapons solution: some say that legendaries shouldn’t be included in Survival others say that they will quit playing if legendaries won’t be included. The best thing that came to my mind to please both sides is to include legendaries BUT at the risk of dropping the last weapon/ one armor piece you equipped before dying with your junk and some of your aids. At this point it’s up to you if you want to play safe and use mediocre weapons/armor that you don’t mind losing or if you feel confident enough in not dying and use your best legendary stuff. This will create a much more diverse meta than your usual marsupial explosive build and engaging fights with other players will be much more risky and rewarding at the same time.
---
•	⁠When leaving a server there should be a cooldown of 5/10 mins before actually leaving the server. This is to avoid someone stealing your precious shit and then going offline two seconds after not giving you the chance to take it back (Bethesda was talking about permanent camps so it’s technically possible stay there even after turning everything off). Or at least this should be applied to wanted players. Or simply don’t allow server hopping in this new Survival gamemode.
---
Actually, slap damage to other players isn't a problem now. But changing to pacifist will alleviate a few problems!
---
How about an 'army mode' where it's 26 against 26? I'd play.
---
Oh god please. There is no way I'm hitting level 100 in one week and I NEED to get into the ZAX mainframe cause I'm dying to see what happens.
---
I think the only thing you can take from players camps are their crops or purified water, but from what I can tell, most players don't care and it'll respawn new one in a few min anyway and most of the time, players have it out to share. 
---
The only thing I can think of that is bad is when something is locked, like a door, don't pick it because you'll get wanted and a bounty of 10 caps on you. If that happens, just store all your junks and have a friend that's not in a team kill you and that should remove the bounty.

I need commando baaad.

Sadly, i got refractor three levels in a row pre-ten
---
The community managers do seem more active in the past few days, or atleast making them selves seen in the posts. Can't say I blame them for not wanting to interact so much before, but it is nice to hear from them now.
---
So you're saying all your SPECIALs are at the base value of just 1? Before level 50 you should be able to pick a SPECIAL and raise it by one allowing you to add more perk cards to them. There's no point in waiting or so, I'm sorry but I don't think you used the system the right way.
---
It’s a great addictive game,didn’t fancy NW as not a BR fan but I was pleasantly surprised by it,keep it up Bethesda 👍🏻👍🏻
---
If they put this much thought and attention to an out of nowhere BR mode, I have restored faith they can fix Survival mode. The BR PvP balance definitely needs a bit of tweaking here and there but its already astronomically better than the PvP Survival has now. If they could give Survival similar treatment and balance, it'd be great.
---
Just pick a build and distribute points based on that. you are going to end up with a lot of cards you will never use.
---
Thank you so much!
---
But to initiate PvP and damage at all between players in adveture mode, you can't be in pacifist. (...unless you have a workshop etc.) That makes it very much relevant.
---
Can always get a friend to turn them in for you. one at a time and just have them give you any outfits or paints(if your lucky) and let them keep the caps for their time
---
My new favourite waste of time is running around the Forest and Flatwoods in Chameleon armour, jumping up into trees and playing Predator noises from a soundboard (like Predator clicking, Predator vision, shoulder cannon lock on) for the benefit of any Newbies.
---
Some folks ignore it but I've had a good few Hearts thrown up and a good few run like \*\*\*\* in the opposite direction xD
---
Damn was kinda hoping for an Overseers desk too to go with the chair...oh well the rest of the stuff looks badass and its basically free just for playing the game. We need more unlockable stuff maybe they'll do like seasons or something with different prizes
---
You can actually lock your purifiers and doors with locks.. In camp mode you'll see the option to do so on the bottom of the screen.  Level 1 lock is all you need. If anyone steals from you they'll be wanted instantly.
---
I don’t know how this Reddit stuff works but thank you! :D
---
Creep
---
Wait... Really?! So and caps gained in me carries over to adventure???
---
Killing 20people gives less XP than one win. I am gonna keep grinding ranks forever this way.
---
I have a build in mind , but none of the perks for the build are available.  (Gunsmith , commando , starched , etc.) The only perks available are ones I got from perk packs
---
Well, you can go up to Overseer Rank 197 so they'll probably add more rewards in the future.
---
Did you pick the same card repeatedly after opening a pack? If not do so once you get another pack. That'll let you merge the cards to the nxt level
---
Ip bans dont work. If you want to ban in such a way, you need to ban the Mac Adress.
---
I guess you just need a tier 3 perk card and another "tame" option should appear when confronting an animal/creature alone

I have seen players with other than vaultsuit clothing on in the waiting area. How do we get that ?
---
Preferring company of females equals creep - gd, what is wrong with you?
---
You don't need chat kid survive yourself
---
The way you asked wack I'm a female. And when I read this I knew you were a creep
---
You are doing your best! I understand. My nicknames were Shark Bait and Chum Bucket in Fortnite because enemy teams ALWAYS found me. :')
---
But Bait also plays a helpful role, we lure out the enemy and then our team takes them out!
---
Yeah no problem, hope you enjoy it 😁
---
Usually newbies have trouble with stimpaks early on. Best alternative early on is learn the healing salve recipe, easy to find ingredients and make them. Will be able to heal yourselves until you can find enough stimpaks or eventually produce those as well.
---
Another tip is caps. Robot vendors can be found at each Train Station. They all have a combined pool of 1400 caps that resets every 20 hours. So basically pick up everything you see, use what you can and sell the rest. Will give you some decent spending money to buy stuff you see at player vending machines.
---
Giving up modding will not fix this. It's unrelated... unless you mean giving up PC as giving up modding.
---
If they add a Glitzy shoulder or clutch bag skin to the backpacks  you'll be sorted
---
I felt bad launching a nuke in a match where the final circle was 4v1. Not only was this guy outnumbered but he also got nuked to death.
---
It just dawned on me. Since this is your first time playing and you're specifically playing with friends, you might need a quick walk through on how to make sure you're all playing on the same server.
---
When you start up the game, one of the menu options will be "Social." You can add your friends to your friend list there assuming you know their account name. You can form a team from here, but at least when I did that back in the early days of the game it was a big buggy. Haven't tried it that way recently.
---
Instead, once one friend is in the game, the others can select them from their friend list and chose "Join," which will spawn them into the same world. 
---
You'll have a brief character creation period inside Vault 76, where you'll be by yourself for a bit. Once everyone is outside, bring up the social menu again (accessed by hitting esc or M to get to the map. "Social" will then be in the top right corner). From there, you'll be able to build the team.
---
Also on the map, in the top left, there's the options menu. In the audio section, you can select whether you have Team chat or Area Chat. Team chat means you only hear the people on your team, and can only be heard by them. Area means that you here anyone around you and they can hear you too. Area is default, but you might want to switch over to Team. If you do, make sure everyone on your team has switched over too or you won't be able to hear each other.
---
What happened to your camp?
---
The screaming bro its a game dude grow up
---
I've only got 605 caps
---
Uggh... Can I rephrase this thread to say "looking for  thoughtful, kind, high-IQ folk?"
---
&gt;Team chat means you only hear the people on your team, and c
---
Oh! This is SUPER useful, I never thought about the possibility of spawning in different worlds. Much appreciated for all the guidance!
---
tamed beasts cage fights!
---
with bets!
---
Also garbage. I won back to back games with multiple kills and had a dozen other highly placed games in the 10-15 games I played tonight. I probably didn't make more than 200 ish caps. 200 caps barely covers my transportation fees in a day of playing.
---
To be clear, I love that I get adventure/survival rewards for playing NW. But if your playing NW for the xp and caps, you're being **crazy** inefficient with your time.
---
I suggest you try to get as many technical datas as possible its much cheaper that way
---
I like the idea but they won’t do it because people would accuse them of recycling content instead of making a new game.
---
Cheating in a pvp game, how novel.
---
Im running hunting-rifle or lever action with master rifleman. Unarmored People are oneshot to the head and People with armor are also oneshot if they are a little dmged. But I See why cal50 is meta, It shreds.
---
I've gotten 3 kills, 2 downed and 1 environment kill and I SUCK. I wouldn't think 15 to be unrealistic.
---
Oh... Quests and side quests. If you get inundated with them on the right side of the screen (which you will!), you can turn them off and on in the pip boy. Just choose a couple to follow, and once those are done you can return to the pip boy and pick out others to follow.
---
Yeah Id like to know at least by month when the wastelanders and nuclear winter beta is coming.
---
Thank you for the game, enjoying it for about 900 hours.
---
Give me a scoped lever action or auto handmade any day
---
Cool, thanks!
---
99% of hackers are on PC
---
This guy gets it 👍 good work
---
How is it unrelated? Mods can and will be used to cheat.
---
😂😂😂😂😂 spoken by a true creep gross
---
No god please. I already fear every ubisoft game cause they stick stuff in the water I don't need to fear Bethesda games too. Water is fucking scary man!
---
I was lucky enough to get commando and frog legs extremely early. Nothing special since then though and I'm level 40... Lots of dupes.
---
I could not solo a team of 4 with a one shot repeater, even with my gaming sox and chair. 
---
With a 50 cal there is an even chance to clean em out (if they are somewhat rubbish).
---
Also there's plenty of food and purified water in my garden, there's no reason to kill my cattle even if you are starving or thirsty, for Atom's sake!
---
I dont get it what kind of fun is to kill some one while cheating? There is no challange in that. No feeling of accomplishment.
---
"This CAMP is under our protection"
---
[Then this message is for you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROFsV18qrdQ)
---
​Woah - I just saw the russian hack demo video of what it looks like from their POV. For the doubters, PLEASE watch that video. Cheating is very real on NW and has to stop or it is DEAD. 
---
The video shows the location of all players on the map, and has hit boxes/aimbot for each. This is really messed up.
---
I'm on ps4 and need has it taken that long bruh
---
you missed the continuation
---
Not sure what on earth is wrong with you, but this is definitely not the kind of community I thought was here. Suppose I'd be better off looking for a different community, or a different game entirely.
---
Agree that sales have bottomed out, a new aggressive sales plan needs to be implemented  lol with so many kids around maybe we should all sell toys and nuka cola. Time to shut your bars down as well or you might get prosecuted for selling alcohol to under age drinkers lol.
---
I think every card is in lvls of 3 and the cards are random. So 3 if its the only charisma card you run.
---
That's so annoying. When three of you are you together, and the fourth boob decides to land on the other side of the map. Never to be heard of again.
---
I have to upgrade perks I'll never use to increase my SPECIAL ? i dont have the option to allocate points to my special attributes. Is there a way to send you a ss of my perk list ?
---
Ok thanks I'll keep on searching for Technical Data and also keep on searching the shops in Charleston incase it appears there
---
Lol ill be waiting on my boat with my pet white cat
---
Why are people so fucking pathetic. I hope BSG adresses these issues quick and permaban these douchebags.
---
It angers me that people think you can hack on PS4. Lmfao
---
Do it
---
I haven't got any friends who play Fallout 76, so it might be a bit harder
---
#3 on cons is ridiculous dude... Maybe a below lvl 10 and above 10 . But 1 to to lvls?? That'd be awful.
---
The Vault spoiled them. Not that it is an excuse but the only reason i can come up with.
---
Would love to have some tatos and a well purified water or milk.
---
PC MASTERACE! :D
---
This is really bad and feel sorry for pc players.
---
You have th better game with 60 fps but the down side are those stupid people that think cheating is okay
---
Try r/fo76filthycasuals man.
---
It was fun at launch making an organic group of friends, heading to their secluded camp, then nuking the Queen or Whitespring. 
---
I love the new content an insane amount, but I also liked being part of a small community of people who got the vibe of 76 from the get go.
---
You need it to make the Fairbairn-Sykes skin for the combat knife.
---
Better yet keep the legendarys but only let them effect Ai. Also tone down perks by like 50% for pvp.
---
There are cards that require more points. Also got one which requires 9 perception and one that requires 6 charisma
---
Ya same here, theres always people willing to help out though if it came down to it
---
Oh that i didn't know. Only played a few games of the BR. Thx for the tip!
---
I find the best thing about it is that the mode is built into what's supposed to be a realistic environment. In other BR, the world is more like a nuisance. It's just obstruction for people to duke it out. It's very "stage-y". 
---
In this game it makes BR feel much more realistic and immersive.
---
Help yourself. Mi casa, tu casa.
---
Nobody’s keeping you here 😉
---
Don't have them on you when you start the quests and only take them out one at a time. Otherwise, you'll lose them all.
---
In my very first match I killed two, then one in the match after that. And since then, nothing (around seven or eight matches). I even managed to kill myself once, I misfired a grenade launcher into the doorframe I was standing next to. The naked, unarmed fat guy I was trying to kill must think he has a guardian angel.
---
Must be a troll, nobody is that dense
---
I prefer Curie.
---
Fellow noob myself, but things I discovered are useful early on:
---
1. Focus on one weapon type you want to use early on. Grab every weapon of this type you come across to scrap them at workbenches. This will give you the chance to learn mods for them. Leave other wepons behind, usually they are heavy and don’t give you many caps.
---
Take the “Green Thumb” perk (probably got it in a card pack anyway, because:
---
2. After learning the healing salve reciepe, take a walk on the river from Flatwoods to Morgantown. You will soon be stocked with healing salve.
---
3. Place your camp at an open space with soil and plant corn, tatos and mutaberries. Not only will this give you an endless supply of corn soup (easy to make, quenches thirst and hunger, spoils slowly) and vegetable starch (therefore adhesive), but also lots of crops you can sell to the vendorbots for easy profit.
---
Don't drink any Nukashine if it's offered. It won't kill you, but you may wish it had...
---
(Actually it's pretty good fun.)
---
&gt;Don't drink any Nukashine if it's offered. It won't kill you, but you may wish it had...

---
&gt;(Actually it's pretty good fun.)
---
Oh no, now it really picked my interest lol
---
There's no Groupquesting system in place like Baldurs Gate or Borderlands. So it doesn't really matter that you are a 4 player group. Everything has to be done fourth times.
---
Thanks! For some reason I just let the launcher go for a bit more and while it kept stuck on downloading, it ended up reporting that FO76 had been fully instaled. I guess it was only stuck visually but it was still working
---
Oh, you mean Great Great Great Great Great Great Grandpappy Daniel Garvey? Yes... I believe you're right.
---
&gt;erything has to be done fourth times.
---
Got it!
---
I placed the NW chest Stashes in my friends' bases who haven't gotten high enough to unlock them so I believe you can sell it
---
Only 20 people can be in any instance of the map, so if you find yourselves in different worlds, keep one person in theirs (preferably the one with the fewest number of other players already in their worldspace), and have the other two back out to the main menu. From there, go to their social menus and join the friend who stayed in their world.
---
Another thing you might need to know: you can fast travel in the game but it cost "caps" - the currency you can find around the world or through doing quests. Fast travel to  Vault 76, your camp, your teammates, or your teammate's camps is free. So you don't feel like hiking across the map for something, one of you can pay the cost of traveling, then the other two can travel there for free by selecting the teammate on the map. That'll save you all some money if you rotate who's doing the traveling.
---
When it comes to getting better weapons and armor, you can craft some from the beginning of the game and build their leveled versions as you level. For others types of weapons and armors, you'll need to look for "Plans" scattered around the world or on sale by vendors (player vendors show up as a green circular icon on the map and usually have good prices for this sort of thing). For the upgrades, you generally have to scrap extra copies of the weapon to unlock them.
---
So if you're favoring a hunting rifle, pick up extra hunting rifles that you find along the way and scrap them when you get a chance. This gives you a chance to learn how to make different components (barrels, receivers, scopes, grips, etc.) for your hunting rifle. Same goes for other types of weapons and armor.
---
When you guys level up, you'll be presented with seven attributes: Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck. These are your SPECIALs. Whichever one you select on the initial level-up screen gets a +1. This will then open up the Perk selection screen, starting with the chosen SPECIAL. You don't have to pick a perk from this SPECIAL though. You can scroll through others (z and c cycle through the Perk categories) to pick from other categories too. 
---
If you want a quick description of what each of the SPECIALs and their associated perks are good for, let me know. For now, I'll just say that Charisma is good for teamwork, so all of your might want to put a few points there early on and pick up Inspirational and / or Body Guards as your perks.
---
Hopefully they can craft like the slaves in conan exile

Sorry, logged off after my last post.  Go to your map, press the left bumper. select setttings&gt;game and set pacifist to on.
---
Favorite a clothing item in the atomic shop
---
I don't think you'll be finding hermit crabs that use busses as shells naturally
---
And still no ultra cite armor skin :(
---
Two early quests you're given involve the Overseer - The Overseer's Quest and Personal Matters. You can do them one at a time or together. They're best done early as they're an interesting guided tour of the map, give you lots of lore and reveal some important locations. They're also a challenge early on, so more fun.
---
Can't bank level up points. Just the way it is.
---
Wow lucky . And grind is real lvl 40?? How many noobs have you slain
---
It's better that you keep it with yourself. Mutant freak.
---
I keep hearing people say how fun NW is. It's almost undeniable. 
---
Only the trolls keep shifting goalposts to try and discredit this.
---
I've got 4 pieces of Technical Data atm

If you need it you can read everything about specific aspects of the game in the Help menu (once you are playing) &gt; Esc &gt; Z &gt; HELP

I sometimes take workshops again since the team-contesting-griefing was stopped. I never lock them and I expect others to take what they need. I often forget to loot them myself and even if someone else loot them I usually get something when I finally remember to collect. I also build workbenches and a stash for others to use when there. We're supposed to rebuild Appalachia, you know.
---
🍤🍆

*Laughs in crossbow to the head doing 442 damage
---
Are you on ps4? I need help.
---
I believe nukes and dragons build tool gives a level map, you can check what becomes available. you could choose nice to have cards. Not directly for your build or level up the Riffleman as well so you could swap your build.
---
Yeah it's crazy how they were trying to convince him to dislike it. Like how dare you have fun? It's pathetic honestly
---
I didn't know anything about the level, perk or stat systems, nice to have an idea, that should make it easier as well!
---
Bullys/Cheaters have to enjoy being an a-hole because they need to be hated by so many, it feeds their reason for being and expands their ego.

Shallow small-minded little creatures that are the minority, they will never be liked, but they must not want to be liked, they are bottom feeders.

(Unsure of posting this as Reddit like most if not all social media platforms can be unforgiving, but sometimes it's good to vent, even if others disagree.)
---
You're naive if you think it's unhackable because it's a console. However it's arguably much easier on PC.
---
This is bang on for me. Survival mode has the potential to be so much better, removing legendaries would be a great move.
---
Just give me a working slot machine ;)
---
Favourite them from the atom store is the only way I know how
---
I look forward to many new S.P.E.C.I.A.L. interactions with my character including:
---
\[Charisma 1\]: "Who are you? What the hell are you doing in my Camp? Did you take some of my water? DID YOU TAKE ANY OF MY \*\*\*\*ING WATER?!"
---
\[Charisma 1\]: "Hey there pretty lady, you smell like a Mirelurk, but in a good way."
---
\[Charisma 1\]: No, that ain't molerat shit on the sofa. I mean it's shit, but it ain't from no molerat, if y'know what I'm sayin'"
---
\[Agility 19\]: "Do AnY oF yoU fiNe WasTELanDErs haVE any C-c-c-c-c-cOfFeE you could seLL ME? I fIND mySelF in MOST PRESSING NEED."
---
"It's a trap!" (Possibly)
---
You can only use atom shop cosmetics. Go into the atom shop and select an item you own - the text at the bottom of the screen will tell you what button to make it a 'NW favourite'
---
You can do this with cheat engine and there enough people who make so called tables so you have all the addresses for the attributes
---
Curie the cutie. I like her too.
---
They do sound like one good thing to do! Now you guys are getting me hyped!
---
I loaded into this guy's camp and thought for a second as to why a sloth would spawn on the golf course.
---
So I have to waste perk points on worthless perks ?
---
When the quest starts, if you have them on you they'll compress down to one.
---
And Windows 10 is still the same core OS as Windows NT.
---
You'll want to focus on Charisma primarily. That's where the team buffing perks are. You'll also want to pick up the Travelling Pharmacy perk in Strength to carry more chems and medicine around. Pharma Farma in Luck will be helpful for finding more medicine (once you get the perk, but sure to hit the "Search" button, whatever it happens to be on your platform, when opening med kits, doctor bags, medicine cabinets, etc.)
---
Yeah i can relate to that :D
---
 I mean i'm okay being the bait, someone has to take the role but i honestly feel sorry for the pain my random members must feel.
---
If it wouldn't be that somewhat exciting i would give in imediately lol
---
The funniest thing for me is my one and only kill up to now was in the very first round.
---
Early on I saw that behaviour in Queen fights. They walked in front of people firing upwards so when the fight was over they could kill people and take the just rewarded stable flux.
---
I love how it feels like it fits the fallout universe. This is already a world where we know there are crazy vaults staffed by rogue AIs and out of control corporate experimentation on the residents. A battle-to-the-death-for-overseer seems pretty tame compared to some of the other things Vault Tec has canonically gotten up to!
---
That's such bullshit
---
Oh you silly rabbit fallout ain't for kids
---
I'd hate to tell you this but the PC version of Fallout 76 is just a case with the Serial number and has no disc at all.
---
Oh okay, thank you!
---
I got the same email from the same place. It said the package is only a pound. I hope it's the correct size for the helmet. I was expecting it to be a little heavier given the size
---
Im a guy with a female character on PS4, does that count?
---
The overseer's office with a chair you can sit on, and a holotape that requires lvl 31 or something to listen to.
---
The Switch got hacked pretty bad, totally ruined Splatoon 2. PS4 is definitely hackable, it's just difficult and anyone who would be interested is probably just going to go with PC.
---
In workshops if the material is green then its provided by the workshop, if theres no green materials when you build then it's from your stash. If the workshop runs out of it's own then it wont resupply itself unless you find a new lobby that doesn't have anything extra built at the workshop(theres some sort of timer to despawn the stuff when the owner leaves)
---
Haha, this actually made me laugh, also I did that once to see if it was anyone who could lock posts or just some. It was a shit joke anyway lol.
---
I just tried upgrading my sturdy frame to level 2 and my STR is still at 1
---
Go commando and shake what your mama gave you.
---
Still an asshole move
---
You don't have to catch them in the loading screen. Organise beforehand/through discord/ps4 party/whatever and make your team from the social menu in the start screen before choosing NW.
---
Fallout 2 has Tool posters on the walls of some houses, and a barbershop quartet in New Reno sings Tina Turner, Nirvana and Red Hot Chili Peppers songs. The pharmacist Renesco the Rocketman also says he took his name from Elton John.
---
I only paid £25 for Fallout 76, rented it initially and chose to keep it the day it arrived, but I'm still considering installing it digitally so I can forgo the disc needing to in.
---
I know I can't speak for everyone but I'm really proud of you Bethesda. I love the game, I love the story, and I love what you've done with it. Keep doing what you're doing.
---
Awww, you guys! Ain’t nothin’. 
---
Seriously - I love the game. Not a fan of NW and that, but... my time is coming! Thanks for sticking with us, as well. I’ve purchased games from other publishers that have had a bad initial time of things and instead of doubling down on the game and making it what people want, they... gave up. They cut us loose and junked the game.
---
You’ve not done that. It must have been a hard few months with so many people shouting loudly, but... well, as a member of the shy majority, I personally want to say thank you. I’ve been with this franchise for every game since 1996/7 and it’s always been my favourite. It’s been a pleasure to see it grow and change, especially when it could easily have just been left to fade into obscurity, so - thanks folks. I’m looking forward to many more adventures in the world you’ve built for us to muck about in.
---
Peace.
---
Just give us a balance like in nw and a drop x items from inventory and I would love to play it.
---
It would also be cool if you can not repair power armours so you always have to hunt for them.
---
Another bug that goes back to release and BETA. When you zoom in a scope and release it too fast you'll get stuck and have to tap ADS to get out. With a PVP heavy gamemode this is infuriating. Not acceptable in an AAA game for this bug being here since tje beginning.
---
From the sound of it you seem extremely experienced in fighting there SBQ. Lol. Any tips for the sheepsquatch? that's my next target, I'm only asking because you sound really knowledgeable on F76.
---
Oh my god, I hope they didn’t change the spawn for the owners of the camp as well... fast travelling / spawning is (or was) the only way for me to reach / enter my camp.
---
What's your psn? I'll give you one for free as they're really not worth much more than that. Asking 600 caps is a fucking joke lol.
---
Full rewards list is out now. All cosmetic skins just as I said.
---
My spawn is also different at my camp, but I did move my nose so that may have been it. Good luck, hopefully your spawn is still fine
---
People that want this suck in PvP
---
I too just received a mysterious shipping notification, since I haven't ordered anything recently. Been trying to figure out what it could be.
---
She got a big booty so I call her Big Booty.
---
Hmm that would be far better than solo mode, though I'd like solo mode too.
---
Don't want a disc, just want the code.
---
I hope so. As much as I'm looking forward to MOAR CONTENT, I kind of enjoy wandering around in the desolation as it is, y'know? It's pretty.
---
Also cocaine and hookers
---
I just want a damn skin for the ultracite armor
---
It's rpt-1991, thanks really appreciate it
---
Why do they even bother? Seriously confuses me! I posted about trying to make the game mode more fair a day or 2 ago, not like these A-holes 1-upping everyone. No satisfaction in this at all. Like, what do you get from cheating?
---
It's not just 76 it's pretty much every single thing that there has ever been a YouTube video made about.
---
If you read any comment section on any game or movie though, it seems to get pretty heated in a short space of time.
---
I've never been able to understand it. There genuinely does seem to be a certain kind of person who just passes their day making shitty comments about things. Pay it no mind! :)
---
I really doubt the repair kits will be useful in NW. Maybe I'm just a bit shit at the mode but no one seems to survive more than a few bullets and I've bashed things to death without breaking my gun. Maaaybe for armor since I definitely broke my PA, but otherwise nah.
---
And the people who are willing do go all the way to hack a game on ps4 are much less so your chance to meet someone is so small
---
I'd settle for being able to use my Pip-Boy whilst sitting.
---
Why not is my question, they must have the code all set up just add it to other helmets, really strange but typical Bethesda I guess.
---
Get yourself a flamer and all the ammo you can hoard
---
There's a perk card where the flamethrower heals teammates and I've always meant to make a heavy armor, fire medic who brings equal parts joy and despair
---
You got the old man winter mask from faschnat?!
---
Suppressor perk on CHR requires 9 points. Perhaps tenderizer requires 9 points too?
---
If you do like it, more power to you for sure. But you also have to admit that BioWare are straight up liars. The Cataclysm that was shown originally is nowhere near what you are actually going to getting.
---
Just a thought! :D To be fair, some of the skits are fun but a review that comes out a month too late is pretty pointless.
---
Don't know why you're getting downloaded. My adventure character is specced out massively for a melee build which I'm never going to use in BR, all the good rifle perks are locked out for me because of it.
---
You can still order a physical copy. Its just a code in the box. You still use the launcher. Found the game at wall mart for 30 bucks or around 20 if i waited for Amazon delivery.
---
I ran into this same guy.  Same shit.
---
I love it
---
I paid over €100 to pre order with extras because of nostalgia and got a pile of shit
---
Yes please! 😊
---
For me it was the atmosphere. Slowly walking around taking in the desolation, listening to the holotapes, really feeling the loss of those brave people while we were comfortable in the vault.
---
What has kept me in the game is exploration, slow pace, ability to do basically whatever I want whenever I want. I like maintaining my shop, rearranging my camp, doing the daily challenges, and meeting new people. One you're high enough level you're basically in godmode where nearly nothing in PVE can harm you if you don't get super careless so it becomes very, very chill.
---
im on ps4 does that make a difference?
---
Nice to see Beth/FO76 getting some good press for a change.
---
It fun, I can't shoot straight and I die.
---
Of course it's PC. Cheats will come to console but it's way easier on PC. 
---
One reason I hope there's never crossplay.
---
The main reason combat is more enjoyable it NW is because all the magic star gear is gone.
---
Depends in your play style. I like it but my freind hates it. Any weapon from the orange boxes or locked containers is the META. The 50cal, combat shotgun, handmade, and auto laser are all so strong because they are in the rarest boxes.
---
If you're in contact with Todd tell him I said hi
---
The fun is not coming from the challenge of playing the game for these people, it is usually from inhibiting other people from having fun playing the game. "Some people just want to watch the world burn"
---
I don't get the sticking ADS lucky.
---
Zenimax is the publisher/holding company, Zenimax Online Studios is a studio they own, separate from BGS. The naming of all these entities must make for some fun legal doc reading.
---
I love the game. Playing on Ps4. Didn't buy at start as got burnt with Andromida and said I'd never pre order a game again. 
---
You have made it into a fantastic game. Granted, it can still be a bit buggy but fuck it! I love it. Bring on the NPC's. Woo.
---
Starcraft isn't a bethesda IP.
---
This comment really doesn't deserve any downvotes. There's no two ways about it that the state the game released in was unacceptable.
---
* **Strength** determines increases your carry limit and the damage you do with unarmed attacks and melee attacks. Its perks mainly help with those things, as well as shotguns and Big Guns.
---
* **Perceptoin** affects your accuracy in VATS - the auto-targeting system you can activate by pressing "Q". Its perks are mainly related to your rifles. But it also has lockpicking perks, and perks for gaining more resources from plants you harvest and animals you kill.
---
* **Endurance** affects your hit points and your survival skills. Its perks are mostly related getting more health, making the most of your supplies, avoiding diseases, etc.
---
* **Charisma** is all about teamwork. The more points you have in Charisma, the higher level perks you can "share" with your teammates - If your Charisma is 3+, you can pick one of your 1-star perks and it affect your teammates as though they also had it (can't stack with perks they're already using). Every additional 3 points of Charisma increase the maximum star-level of of the shared perk by 1. Almost all the perks in Charisma are about buffing yourself based on your team or helping them in some way.
---
* **Intelligence** covers a lot of utility effects. This is where the Hacking perks are, as well as lot of the crafting perks. It doesn't do much without the perks to back it up though.
---
* **Agility** determines your Action Points - which you use for sprinting and for attacking things in VATS. It has perks that affect how you use your Action Points as well as perks that buff your pistols and sneaking. It also has my favorite Perk - Born Survivor - which automatically heals you (if you have a Stimpack) when your health gets low.
---
* **Luck** mainly impacts how quickly you can build up a Critical Attack in VATS. It's perks impact a lot of the random chance aspects of the game, like what supplies you might find while looting.
---
Usually, ads are based on your search history.
---
"Companion NPCs will be able to live in your C.A.M.P., while also offering you quests."
---
Are you saying that we will have our own Preston?
---
Terminal to another room, need 100 to get in. Nice desk, chair and round window. It's posh.
---
Right, Starfield, my mistake.
---
I used to go on the eye testing machine 😄
---
Elder really should have the committee scheme of Paladin and Sentinel. But I wanted maximum Elder for the picture. I may go back to my Paladin paint.
---
Nuke
---
Definitely! It's a real positive for the game to have high profile streamers enjoying it.
---
I miss the days when that place was my safe haven, and the robots protected my camp.  On the other hand, I love how this game continues to evolve.  Now I run a strip mall outside Sutton Station.  I'm sure this fall will bring all kinds of new journeys.
---
That might've been me! I like how it ends in a stalemate
---
Thanks for the jacket
---
Sure does! Only because I am ps4 as well. I'd be more than happy to help you with your quest. I also have a ton of plans you are more than welcome to pick through 
---
My psn is Papertattoo
---
Possibly in the air! While then coming back to the ground. Fun times!
---
They're recycling all the stuff from FO4 which had the BOS paint jobs for T-60. I'd love to give my T-51 some BoS love.
---
By two hits do you mean In PvP or in pve?
---
It's a bit compulsive. You play a game and get owned, then think, just one more go. Next minute it's 2:00 am. Every game is different.
---
It's almost like "free" is a much more acceptable pricetag when dealing with a buggy mess, compared to "60 dollars".
---
What system, I can take a look for you. You likely need to ground the floating bits to a foundation with some other stairs, also work your way down to avoid the issue with not being able to remove because other things need it. Top to bottom and furthest out to closest in to where your main staircase is that makes sense.
---
No worries. Sorry to just dash off, just doing dailies quickly then back to NW and my camp spot was taken on that server :)
---
I just hope next elder scrolls and fallout will be on new engine, dont care much about 76 just play it sometimes when I have time
---
It isnt an ad, read the article closely.
---
What level are you? Hard Bargain 3 + just selling all the weapons you pick up doing things like clearing Camden Park should get you 1400 caps a day easily.
---
What's the discord link?
---
Okay. Thought I'd just mention it just in case you didn't want to wait.
---
Damage floater doesn't work quite right at the moment. It can't capture on-trigger effects like furious, etc. Only the pre-buffed passive damage.
---
Don’t worry kid I’ll let you have the last word, I think your self esteem needs it.
---
Hunting rifle or Scoped Lever Action, plus Combat rifle and I'm all good.  Early game I just hide, run, and occasionally snipe.  Late game closer quarters I switch to combat and let fate decide.
---
really? i didnt know that
---
if so thats stupid ehy should plans be available on pc and not on ps4? 
---
sure im already pretty well set except for heavy/sturdy metal plans and raider armor plans but i will have a look ill add you when im online maybe we can do a treasure hunt some time 👍🏼
---
You can always help by reporting these people on their [support site](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10).
---
Every BGS game needs a warning before sitting/sleeping/drinking dirty water: Are you sure you want to do that or did you mean to pick up an item?
---
Makes Fortnite look childish. Which I suppose it was anyway.
---
OH...NO  
---
DO NOT BECAME NEXT EA PLZ!
---
pvp
---
They will not become available until you’ve spent the previous levels Perks. 
---
There is no “Hording” of levels in this game, 
---
If you want a perk that is unlocked at lvl 13, you have spend points on levels 2-12 first. Then, lvl 13 perks unlock. 
---
Simply put. You will not have your perfect build at lvl 50, it typically takes an extra 15-20 because of the inability to Horde.
---
Hate at the launch was well deserved and it helped the them see that they fcked up and had to fix the mess that they made
---
That's ok no problem I need to head to Welch for the next quest
---
Br has brought back some of the magic of the early days. An excited player base means a lot.
---
Overseer ranks. The skins can be used in Adventure mode too, but you have to level up and earn them in Nuclear Winter.
---
But I read that some people find out how Furious works.
---
What's different now as opposed to the first month at launch? Are the performance issues on PC fixed?
---
Try using psycho and other damage resistance drugs to help you? That’s what I do usually but I don’t PvP a whole lot tbh
---
Sounds like you lost a fight to an energy weapon lmao
---
Well, plans arent platform specific...what I meant is that it matters you're on ps4 as now I can lend you a hand. Sorry for the confusion. I'm still half asleep lol
---
The most heart pounding moments I've had have been when I'm just chilling in a bush and a full group run right past me.
---
Try it and see for yourself, if you are buying it just for br don't buy it for a full price
---
Oh I know. I just hate pointed out the lazy flip job half this game is because no one likes hearing it and isn’t if people just accepting criticism against Bethesda people just down vote.
---
There’s so much good shit made for and added to this game, but then there’s the areas that are lacking like the BOS paints, that you know they made horsemen of the apocalypse armor sets, how hard would BOS paint for T-51b or T-45d be?
---
ah okey get you :D no problem
---
Haha awesome. Yeah the ones who wouldn’t give me milk all died a ‘mysterious’ death.
---
That would be amazing! I think it has a good chance of happening post beta.
---
I did
---
Try reading what people have said. 
---
Spend your levels ups on getting your final SPECIAL’s that you want. 
---
You may have to purchase perks that are not useful to your final build idea,  life’s not fair. 
---
You will probably need to get to level 65-70, due to the number of high level PERKs that you may want.
---
One day shipping was free so I'll get it before the free week is over. Thanks though
---
*I'm gonna build my own bar, with hookers, and blackjack. In fact, forget the bar and the blackjack!*
---
Ehh is it just me or is putting a skeleton on a motorcycle as a reference to a recently deceased person who liked motorcycles and fallout really disrespectful?
---
Like think about it? Putting a skeleton representing a person that just died into the game, not cool.
---
So what Bethesda can say to his relatives that "Hey yeah we made you a quick reminder, hes dead"
---
I feel like that's a pretty terrible idea but that's just my opinion
---
Can confirm on the minigun. Had a match yesterday where it was my teammate vs one other person, and my teammate had pulled a minigun from (what I assume) was the scorchbeast and lit up the other guy with it. I don’t think we would’ve win if he didn’t have it
---
Well, this is no laughing matter.
---
Most likely that mask has been duped.
---
Scan and repair fixed my issue. Thank you kind sir.
---
Okay. Thanks for the answer. Was just curious if i missed it in the patch notes. Ill just keep grinding then.
---
Its same in every battle royale most exp is from time survived/wins, kills give very little exp
---
The quest to learn to make nukashine gives you a free bottle early on. With a team its either going to be extra funny or extra annoying. I'm honestly not sure which. 
---
That quest can be done a relatively low levels too, so it's not a bad option for you and your friends to try out. Like I said, follow the main quest for a bit. It'll eventually take you to Morgantown, which has a train station and the poster you need to start the quest. It's a spot to start the nukashine quest from as well.
---
I got a 3* Instigating 1 the other day.
---
OUTCASTS POWER ARMOR PAINTS!!!!
---
My first camp ever was there, on the edge of the western cliff near the Jeep. I could count on easy mutt chops and occasional low level supermutants. I recently started a new alt and put my camp there only to get overrun by Overlords and glowing mongrels. It’s good to see the game changing tho.
---
i got lucky to get a hand on a furious explosive one in november that really does well
---
but furious ones or two shots do pretty well nowadays 
---
only thing is youll need a lot of fusion cells so you should always watch out for copper and plastic
---
Charisma: Spiritual healer (3) You regenerate health for 10 seconds after reviving another player
---
Agility: Action boy/girl (1) AP regenerates 60% faster
---
I hope the companions have a unique look, or at least be able to change their appearance somehow. I dont want to see 5 different people with the same companion named Baker or something.
---
Also i wonder if raiders will be able to stay at camps since we are able to side with them.
---
Im glad to see people are still finding them. RNG must be hating me right now.
---
Yeah, that just happens, you get used to it. Like tripping on a something irl.
---
Oh shit, I also encountered NicePingforMe in a game and it definitely seemed like he was hacking. He was hitting headshots with a gatling gun across the map without even actually aiming at people. His gun was flickering while he was shooting. And it seemed like his gun was somehow explosive? No video proof from me unfortunately but I definitely reported.
---
 Unfortunately with all the free accounts coming in not a lot Bethesda can do for this period but once the free period ends hopefully we will see this shit die off fast.
---
This game really doesn't have "team composition" like tanks and healers, in all my 1000+ hours I've never ever seen a healer build or actually gotten any effective healing from a teammate. High charisma just lets you share nice high level perk cards but don't expect to actually be a "healer" in this game.
---
Any time my brother!
---
Yes, if you solo queue you still go against full teams, the only option right now is playing squads mode (4 Players)
---
I don't think it's the battle royale that's making this popular exactly. It's more the balanced refined PvP where you don't need to worry about your equipment and durability etc.
---
Why is this guy who told the truth is gettimg downvoted wtf is wrong with ppl, its not comming next week
---
Agreed
---
I'm a new player and it is exactly how you described, I can't believe how fun this game is and why I put it off for so long!
---
There’s no true solo mode yet, whilst you can go in solo other players still have the option to team up
---
Freedom is a helluva thing. Some people abuse it, but I'd rather be free than caged up any day.
---
Erm, Protective and Shielded Raider armours were (are? ) purchasable at Sutton. 
---
It’s where I got mine from. 
---
Casual and Marine however....
---
Same here! Happens quite a bit for me. Same deal too, I'm looking all around for an enemy who's never there. We're being pushed around by ghosts lol
---
Watch out for sheepsquatches ;)
---
Rarest loot is in Scorchbeasts, computers and safes.
---
You can get the same things from orange crates as locked safes
---
Thanks
---
Grow corn at your camp. You can get a bunch of corn at the Silva Homestead, which is pretty close to Flatwoods. If you can get into the greenhouses at the agricultural center in Flatwoods, there's fertilizer in bins there. Plant the corn and make corn soup regularly. It works for both hunger and thirst. If your crops get destroyed by enemies (and they will), don't repair them. Scrap them for one corn and one fertilizer, and just replant them.
---
You actually make more money banning them. These morons will go out of their way and cash in for new copies.
---
Ah bummer. Would explain why I am always getting tagged teamed to death. Thought these people were just buddies ruining solo queue, but it's not a true solo queue
---
Alright thanks for the help
---
Ive gotten to 12 already
---
Yep, had an anti armor one drop a couple of days ago.
---
100% positive. It was an exploit in a way, the daily was repeatable. I even made a post about it. Got a new card every single match. I intentionally farmed it to get frog legs and have it now
---
Yes, I'm doing the exact same right now, I switched a sentinel piece for ammo weight piece because I use a QE Harpoon and BE Railway. Their ammo weight so high that it's worth it IMHO.
---
But I have one question: Does Sentinel work while fireing (while standing)?
---
Especially since it is not really uncommon to be suddenly surrounded by feral ghouls, scorcheds or mongrels you swear where not there a second ago...
---
Ok. The basic cards I got for my first round 
---
S. Strong back. +25 carry weight
---
P. Picklock. Pick all locks
---
E. Life giver. + 45 health
---
C. Creature crusher. +100% damage against creatures
---
I. Hacker. Hack all terminals
---
A. Marathoner. Sprinting -40% ap
---
L. Class freak. -75% mutation negative effects
---
 Probably same starting deck for everyone
---
MATN had an agility card. 9 points goatlegs, no fall damage. That's one of the reasons why I started thinking about all of this.
---
It’s a bug it happens a lot for me too I just get used to it
---
A million times THIS!
---
Oh man, a "Thanks for being a great pal" note? The neckbeards in here are going to eat this shit up with a spoon.
---
My bad didn’t mean loading screen meant game menu.    I’m talking more about ya play a match and get a good group and then want to jump in with them again.    Players should be able to stick together between matches and be able to que in line with someone in vault loading
---
It used to be amazing. Now it's completely fucking useless. Anyone with a non legendary weapon can down you in less less than 2 seconds. I have a full set of both that are also assassin and I get destroyed with it so now I just use chameleon because the only way to survive in PvP now is just to never get hit at all.
---
Rocket launcher, minigun and else?
---
Oh sweet I heard they had god aweful durability is that true?
---
Would be sick to have weekly fishing events.  Turn in your fish and whoever gets the biggest, smallest, heaviest, lightest, ect. ect. wins a prize.  Would be cool to catch fish and use rare ones to spawn some bosses.  Legendary Mirelurk King vendor maybe lol.  You could do all kinds of cool shit with fishing other then eating or recipes.
---
I'm at the Safe n'Clean Disposal atm with high level Super Mutants in the 60's plus a Legendary one
---
Nice find. Maybe ill just have to cruise the market an see if i can find the one im looking for
---
Same. Just one more. Just one...
---
How's about adding a damn text chat next? Like you should have done at launch? Name one other online MMO that DOESN'T have a text chat...go on, I'll wait.
---
Man. The rocket launcher sucks. I shot a guy in marine armor 3 times with it and he was fine.
---
600hours of whateverthefuckiliketodo
---
Same here
---
Let people have fun God damm it
---
Hahahaha 😂
---
I see out to make a team medic myself but switched it up.  I got to level 80 before I started redoing points.   Just not a lot of people playing in groups per se.  I’m hoping with more content they make a medic more a viable build
---
Or even a fixed Elder paint. I'm pretty sure Maxson's in FO4 is using the orange and black. Heck give me an orange and black T-51 with the logo on one shoulder and rank on the opposite. Or maybe anl full olive drab set with the logo/rank.
---
Ok thanks, I definitely will 😂
---
Happens to me again and again in Golf course, usualy just in haste of looting ghoul before another get in range, I suddently stop the rush, SLOOOOWWWLLLYYY LAY DOWN, no rush - right, and then SLOOOWLY get up. Meantime I always franticaly massage keyboard yelling NOT AGAIN!!! .. while ghouls massaging me as I am lying on sleeping bag.....
---
All the loading and wait times just kills it for me personally. I need to get better at it.
---
Well done man, 19 kills is an awesome achievement, but you deserve much more Xp than what it gives you!
---
So it is doing 100damage? Like i can take down people with 3 granades from 79mm launcher
---
As someone that has played since the early access testing, even though the bugs were never so severe that it deterred me from playing, I wasn’t blind to their existence. At launch, some things were rushed, but the game was flooded with so much toxicity, you’d need a gas mask just to browse the sub. A lot of hate was about how different the game was from previous installments from people who didn’t give it a chance. If Fallout 3 didn’t walk a different path than previous installments, most people still wouldn’t know what Fallout is, but it’s a beloved game. Same with New Vegas, which is some peoples favorite as well, if it didn’t change anything, you’d never know how much you wanted factions and meaningful choices to be made in the world. Fallout 4 took risks with having a voiced protagonist and changing VATS, revamping the weapons system, adding settlements, and introducing legendaries; again, all new but very welcomed changes. 76 does a lot different, and now that it seems to have found its fan base and has gotten CONSTRUCTIVE feedback, the game has come leaps and bounds from what it was at launch. It’s crazy to think that we are just 7 months post launch and the game has already done this much. I look forward to what the next 7 months brings.
---
It’s good xp and caps when you get 36+ kills, as I saw a hacker get last night. He killed squad after squad with 4 seconds per group.
---
I dont remember the damage stat  ut it was a trick barrel and I hit the guy with all 2 shots. He was at like half health.
---
It's just a no fill option, most BRs have it. Allows you to not get paired up with randoms, hope a solos mode comes out though.
---
Try to get to the white spring early. Having a major trading hub is essential
---
I did.
---
A 3 star, double dmg if the target has full HP +50% limb dmg +reduced VATS cost.
---
I call it Anklerender, it rips off most legs.
---
Found the song on spotify but it seems incomplete, 
---
not relevant to the pot but you could go listen to it there if you wish.
---
900 hours +, still havin fun.
---
So true
---
Yeah, the game showed at the e3 2017 was totaly a different thingh, however i don't think they were liar, i think their objective was that , they just didn't have skills/time to do it. I think the real mistake was release a game with so many bug of technical nature and a lack of content
---
yes, with Chameleon+Weightless/Sentinel I survive longer than in other armors. But all the good players I'm talking to are using unyielding to get the high perception to see the opponent earlier on the radar.
---
Hey. That is my style too!
---
In around 2 more days that office will be no better than the lobby! 🤣
---
Hehe, once I did this. A player even tried to hide in the same bush as me, and he did not notices me. A quick shotgun and I killed my very first player :)
---
Yeah or even just silver with the logo on the chest like Vegas.
---
New character = FREE PIZZA
---
2 links from Google does not equal research.
---
Yeah, it’s pretty fun, you can get some cool stuff for adventure mode (+caps &amp; exp) and there’s nothing to lose.
---
I'm a rifle vats/crit build and I only ever use PA for nuke zones (mostly for the carry weight since hazmat removes my +carryweight armour). It's totally unnecessary unless you're trying to be tanky.
---
stealthboy?
---
lv8.5 here, have you gotten you frog legs yet ? i even see lv3's having it :/
---
I miss my jumping, feels like i have a ton of lead around my legs, lol
---
People on Twitter still hate it, so eh.
---
I guess we will end up doing it, and if it may bring some fun, why not?
---
You added an e to the end of it.
---
You can see an outline/distortion with a stealth boy which I really didn't see, wish I had shadow play to look over the footage but I suspect it was to do with the insane amount of lag he had.
---
I agree especially about not taking rads while being invisible
---
It's more about having fun than anything, you really don't need to feel bad at all and anyone who says otherwise isn't worth your time! I'm also absolutely terrible but I'm just there to have fun. If you're on PC feel free to add me and we can suck together, my username is microwavedregret :)
---
Let us know how to suppirt the cause! If you need more ammo or wepons made so you can keep going id be more than glad to donate
---
For me was an awesome game at start, not certainly perfect but you make it better and i agree that the community is awesome too, thank you and keep up the good work.
---
if only it had a proper sight :/
---
In a recent match I went for a suit of Power Armour standing in the open and died in a hail of bullets. It turned out a team had left it unoccupied to act as bait. They got quite a few kills that way.
---
Woah, someone did this to me when I came out the vault.  Are you on Xbox?  I used it a lot, it was a great help.
---
Sorry to not clarify. I know that part. Just curious (since I can't find it on a wiki or amything) what materials the workshops come with (amounts and how many of each) and if they respawn over time. Or any way to restock them?
---
True, i like Cait and Curie but Piper for me was something else, prob because of how amazing the voice actress was portraying her character.
---
i dont think specials matter in NW
---
Does 1 mean you are spectating yourself, or have I got an onlooker?
---
It did but since it 75% chance now &amp; every competent player in pvp is going to use rapid fire weapons their is no more just standing around tanking anymore
---
Honestly I don’t mind for pvp too much in adventure I’d just like to do the story, could I still make it work with all that endurance?
---
Honestly, I haven’t played the game in like a month or two, and I’ve just started playing the hell out of it again and tbh, it’s so much better than what it was a release
---
Just my humble opinion, but if you think of it more as a great (and huge) fallout sandbox with questing and events thrown in, rather than a new version of earlier fallouts with other players thrown in, you'll enjoy it more. The fact that everybody is dead in the quests (except robots and possibly the Overseer) is a bit depressing to be honest, but Wastelanders is coming and should change that to some degree.
---
&gt;Everyone must be suffering with this?
---
 Nope. I claimed 3 workshops yesterday on my level 5 character, never disconnected once.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/home

The challenge the day before where you had to place your camp 4 times was bugged. It was repeatable which resulted in being able to farm for perk cards. I got about 30 cards in one day that way
---
Fr though I was in this dudes squad and he needs to be banned. I know I don’t have any proof he clipped through the map had auto aim and flew

I was wondering if was just at my camp, but I noticed that visitors and teammates were suddenly spawning where I usually do. I love it!
---
I still got stuck in a few other camp foundations, though.
---
i did not check yet. i will update you after i check it out.
---
*edited
---
some level 70 showed up at my base and started giving me stuff, it was cool.
---
Because it’s already been released
---
Troll level 1, maybe 2.  Piss poor. You really need to work on your trolling skills.
---
In a few years, people will acknownledge what you guys did here. You corrected a mistake...and made it into a gem. I have seen so much change since day 1, nd all of it was positive.
---
I was dissapointed, but hopefull. And now months later, i am glad i had hope. 
---
A big thank you to all the hard work (so far!).
---
As long as you have 3 or more in each section, you should be good. My character is already set that way.
---
Thanks for making the game!
---
Sending love from sweden❤❤
---
I want a scope attachment very badly
---
yep, I've always been opposed to the levelling/scaling system they use. NW uses none at all and its just great.
---
If someone has less that 3 in one section then they can't use some perk cards.
---
That's Todd Howard telling you hello.
---
Does it only go up to 3? I’m only lvl 4, so I wouldn’t know
---
This!
---
They do; you can only equip perk cards if your SPECIAL stat connected to the perk card is higher (or equal) to the number displayed in the corner of the card (or the sum of the cards, if you run several cards connected to the same SPECIAL).
---
It matters a bit atleast, since you need a specific amount of points to equip stuff.
---
For example:
---
You got 3 strength skill cards. One requires 3, one 6 and one 9. Youve got 10 points in strength. So you can equip either the 3 and 6 card, or the 9 card, because you dont have enough points
---
try checking file integrity, and that you're not running out of RAM/VRAM I guess
---
is this a joke post? i dont get it.
---
i'm running on ultra and theres a huge difference between fallout 4 and 76.
---
granted my net sucks so i get the occasional stutter as it loads but it doesnt tank my FPS.
---
I have the stabilized card and it needs 9 int in nuclear winter. So I can understand wanting to spec for it. I would say hold off for now and wait until it's full release. You should have more perk cards by then as well. Any changes to the perk system that may happen should also happen by then.
---
Some NW perk cards require 9 special points. There is one that lets you see briefcases on the minimap and it costs 9 perception.
---
by Rapid Fire, do you mean 25% Fire Rate or high Fire Rate weapons in general like LMG, .50 Cal etc.?
---
Because thats another big question for me: Is Explosive worth it in PvP?
---
Dense+Fireproof makes 25% Fire Rate better IMHO.
---
I'm more of a reflex sight kinda person, but I'm finding scopes useful in NW
---
Hi more of a reflex sight kinda person, but , I'm dad.
---
Give us the romanceable Assaultron, already. Kappa
---
So true. Gotta communicate with eachother so you can sort the gear accordingly.
---
confirmed..... thinking it was just me. another fine update are bobby pins 8 pounds again....
---
Ya I’ve heard of the lack of npc’s has always been a downside but have also heard there’s big expectations for the wastelanders dlc so I guess we’ll see. Is there dungeons with lore though? 
---
Ex: The dunwich building and it’s sadistic story, or the story of hallucinagen from fo4 with its little side lore.
---
wait...hold on. someone said you can preview the items at the atom shop. so you can see it fer yourself.
---
I've seen a lot more positivity on twitter actually.
---
I have confirmed four other spots in the forest that the vendor bot spawns.
---
 The Charleston spot may be the most famous spawn spot but not the best spot for that vendor to spawn.
---
great for making sniper towers and beefy bunkers ;)
---
I'm /u/BadDadBot
---
 *Well, okay. But I don't want people thinking we're robosexuals, so if anyone asks, you're my debugger...*
---
So who wants to build the Playboy Mansion?
---
There are some black glasses in the locker room in vault 51 that you can pick up and wear.
---
I look forward to seeing whatever hilarity ensues.
---
It's hard to have fun when there is still duping going around...
---
I'm sure the game would be more fun without people creating god tier weapons and armors out of thin air.
---
yeah that happened to my friend. not the best way to show off the game to a new person who is trying to play 76 for the first time
---
I feel that the only times I need power armour are for scorched earth events.
---
Personally I'm gonna wait, as NW is only out for a limited sneak peak. Who knows, when it's officially out it might be possible to select a separate SPECIAL setup for NW. Moving around points for NW now and then back again for adventure/survival mode when sneak peek ends will take a bunch of leveling.
---
I am playing on PC.
---
Well that’s the thing, you don’t do it for everyone, just a few. Who is enshrined and who isn’t is irrelevant, those who are represent every community member who has passed.
---
These guys are right. Crafting perks are secondary as the cards can be swapped. 
---
Did you review the cards and make note of one's you like?
---
Strength covers melee, heavy weapons and shotguns as well as power armor builds. 
---
Perception handles rifles, commando for automatics, rifleman for non-automatics. 
---
No real weapon skills for endurance but fireproof is a must and has some other musts for specific builds. 
---
Charisma is more support oriented, group buffs, and such
---
Intelligence is your crafting but max of any 1 crafting skills is 5 points. Although some crafting skills are just that, the big ones like gunsmith, melee crafting and such double as increased durability. Additionally nerd rage is important for bloody builds. 
---
Agility and luck are more about vats which I don't mess with but there are some good perks for other skills. I couldn't have made it through my first play through without enforcer which really stands in for 4's crippling/kneecapping legendaries on shotguns. Also there is starched genes and class freak which is important if you want to play with mutations. And who doesn't want to do that.
---
Just high fire rate in general anything from a handmade to a lowly 10mm auto pistol will get the job done.
---
Not everyone uses both dense+fireproof but if they are yeah 25% FR all the way.
---
I'm with you. Ignore the downvotes - probably just PC master race 😁
---
Yes but this is a fun story about someone roleplaying for the new arrivals and you have to ruin it with all this pessimistic bullshit, sure he could of super it but he could equally have earned it and yes duping is an issue in the game but it doenst have to be brought up all the time, the developers are 100% aware of the games issues
---
local scrub terrorist stomps regular human being players.
---
You can have multiple cards using the same SPECIAL traits
---
not anymore, only first 2 tiers
---
Ok but who chooses who gets in and who doesn't? What makes this person more reasonable then my friend who died ?
---
Are you in the forest or ash heap? Try higher level areas and the enemies shoukd be using higher level weapons. Even at over 100, enemies in the forest are gonna drop low level stuff.
---
I’ve experienced this a few times too. Not sure exactly why it happens though I’d say it’s probably loading too much at once and confusing itself.
---
Haha pog this is beautiful
---
I know that much, but is 3 points the most a perk card can be?
---
Nah, she was in a memorial service, someone shoot a bunch of here friends over at Uranium fever :)
---
I was in a match with this guy last night and was in his squad. It was ridiculous. I spent the first half of the match wondering how he was seeing other players. This explains it of course. It didn’t take me and the other guy on the squad long to figure out he was exploiting.
---
I think disabling auto-fill will help the “getting your friends on your team” thing out. The whole friend-team thing in NW is tricky anyway.
---
Its a taunt
---
cap stash runs with the cap collector perk card. easily can get 1-2000 caps in 30 min.
---
Wow.
---
&gt;Not Canon
---
&gt;Everything else
---
Welp time to bring back liberty prime to Appalachia while they are fighting the NCR, Legion, Master, the Institute, the Children of Atom, Followers of the Apocalypse, Crimson Caravan, Children of the Cathedral, Khans, Chinese remnants, Boomers, and the most important and influential faction The Republic of Dave. This will give the players plenty of factions to choose from. /s
---
ROFL
---
2k is nothing. I'm generally rolling in 5.56, 45, Fusion Cells from all the mutant farming I do.  Usually have 2-4k for sale at all times. You do not have to worry about that ammount being duped, enjoy freely!
---
I don't know for NW, but some cards goes up to Rank 5, mostly Crafting perks
---
That is because super mutants are stupid bullet sponges. I feel you.
---
Just got an email too.  Could be the new canvas bag for the collectors edition of Fallout 76?
---
Solo queue will be a very different game, probably far less complex and fun than squad queue. I’m a solo player and it does irritate me when I have to queue in with ransoms who don’t speak, but I prefer it over solo for sure. 
---
That said, it will probably be a thing eventually.
---
Hi, thanks for the reply.
---
Where can I do this cap stash run?
---
I farmed the daily before they figured out it was repeatable and have frog legs now. When you get it, if you really want to get away from the low levels, you can jump into the level 30 area. It’s the balcony section of the theater room with the music instruments.
---
Or maybe your "standards" are just set too high?  If you don't like something about the game now is your chance to give constructive criticism direct to the devs and you're wasting it by shitposting,  it plays like pretty much every BGS game for the last decade but it's got multiplayer and free dlc, that's what a lot of people have wanted for years (look at all the multiplayer mods for past games) and they gave it to us. If you don't like it don't play it
---
At lower levels the best source of acid is to pick up the one bag in Flatwoods (it's on a porch with metal shelving, same side of the road as the church, but up from it by like one house or so), and there's another three bags down in the big barn with a silo around Silva homestead. This plus any antifreeze/coolant bottles around those areas will give you a good amount of acid.
---
Bethesda. The owners of the game choose. Not everything in gaming is pseudo-democratic.
---
Where's the best place to mutant farm and what do you use?
---
loot everything and sell go vendors with 3* hard bargain perk. This is the fastest way.
---
&gt;isthereanydeal.com
---
Clean, simple site. Loved it, thanks!
---
Thats me pretty much.  Man i suck.  Love it when i get to chase down a guy with no weapon and kill his ass while he is trying to loot the nearest container he can find though.
---
Funny thing is, gladiatorial combat has always been a part of Elder Scrolls.
---
Any idea if they are going to let us keep the overseer level after the sneak peek? And rewards already received? Or will they reset everything afterwards?
---
And that ladies and gentlemen is how you do it 🤣
---
Thats not a bug, thats your shity internet. If you use WiFi then switch to a cable.
---
Depending on your level, I would recommend visiting areas like blackwater mine. Go through, clear it out loot absolutely everything then go back out to the train station and sell it (preferably with the hard bargain perk). Participate in events and again, loot everything. Anywhere where there are scorched or super mutants are good as the carry guns you can sell.
---
I always found that by just going around in these areas killing these kinds of enemies I would be recovering enough ammo from them that I wouldn't be losing any at the end of it and would usually come out a bit ahead. 
---
The event uranium fever (I think? anyone?) at blackwater mine was a good one as there were lots of enemies in a small space, just be sure to be courteous and let everyone get a shot at tagging the legendary miners after you've had a shot on them.
---
Doing this sort of thing you should be able to make lots of caps. I can usually bring in several hundred a day without actually trying to, and if I really go hunting for enemies I can hit my daily 1400. 
---
The other thing you can do is look for clothing plans like the marine tactical helmet, civil war hat etc. and make those and sell them for caps, not as easy or rewarding as the other ways but an easy way to pick up a few extra caps.
---
I think it's supposed to be that way to prevent players from getting cheap shotted but idk
---
That's ridiculous.
---
I wanna thank the dev team for not only continuing to make the game but also continuing to make an amazing experience. This week has been fantastic getting some of my close friends into the game, and the community has been just as amazing.
---
My newbie friend started when I was at work and immediately made friends right out of the vault. They explored together up to level 9, just goofing around and experiencing the world. All the while she had level 100+ users helping her out by dropping ammo, weapons, aid, and tips!
---
I am so incredibly proud of the devs and the community for not only keeping the game amazing, but actively progressing towards even more positive experiences. This is easily one of my favorite gaming communities by far, and it continues to blow me away.
---
Even just a few weeks ago when I started playing, the community was endlessly nice and supportive of new adventurers in Appalachia. They helped my boyfriend and I along the way in our adventures and have provided laughs and incredible adventures. Never has a community welcome been so warm. Thank y'all so much.
---
Would you kindly follow the voice
---
I have a 2 star two shot explosive laser rifle for sale. 20k.  It’s a “legacy” weapon. I also have a 2 star bloodied explosive one.  10k.   The 3 star bloodied explosive one I have is 20k.   
---
Options.   
---
Let me know. 😊
---
I really enjoyed it as well.  The booogly eyes didn’t really bother.  I was in high school when 007 Golden Eye was the best game out on N64 and everyone was a bunch of polygons with faces.
---
I wish they didn’t drop it.  Someone mentioned a book?  Is there one out that continues the story?
---
When you inevitably get too heavy - try the following
---
- Scrap your junk at a workbench
---
- Store this scrap in your stash
---
- Remember you don't need to carry lots of weapons around
---
- Sort your inventory by weight and check the Aid, Misc and Ammo tab to assess where your capacity is going
---
- Consider perk cards which make things weigh much less
---
That is interesting! i didn't knew that all heavy weapons where powerful but i did noticed that people using them generally do better including myself. I like the concept of making heavy guns powerful, afterall they are powerful in real life. it is kinda hilarious that in other modes  for example using a minigun  firing a fictional 5mm cartridge (that would be a fairly high caliber in real life) at way over 1000 rounds per minute does nothing more than a little tickle to enemies and gets outperformed by pretty much most other guns in the game in most scenarios.   but i think theres should definitely be a balance to make them more powerful as they should be.. some kind of tradeoff to keep them as they are but still make it balanced like making them a bit heavier and drain significantly more AP. Make it so people have to choose and strategize between being fast but doing less dmg or being slow and doing more dmg essentially even making it so it could be used as a role in a squad depending on the player's build, having a slower and more vulnerable but deadlier guy on the squad assisting the squad would definitely make encounters more interesting and make players of enemy teams look for the heavy gunner like "should we focus on the heavy gunner that we hear comming shooting or focus on his friends nearby" and many other interesting possibilities. we already have great perk cards for the creation of builds and play styles that would support a more balanced and polished heavy gunner build
---
Nah not really lookin around to buy one :) thanks for the offer tho
---
Don't rush it. If it's not ready just let us keep what we have and release the full thing when it's all good. Would rather have a polished product than a rushed mess like launch.
---
Also what’s a legacy rifle
---
Sure. There's decent lore around. Order of Mysteries quest and the lore and locations regarding the mining companies are just two examples. There's also just good environmental storytelling.
---
I kill stuff and sell their guns and any drugs I find.
---
Without watching the video - what's the process for this?
---
Thank you :)
---
I’m currently level 61 and I thought that the more I leveled up the easier the game would become but it seems as though it is just becoming more and more challenging.
---
How many Winter Man Masks (that we know of) there are for every platform? 2? 3? 5? For most of them we don't have any proof and probably some of them are from the Dev Room.
---
I just don't think that a Bethesda community manager should laugh at someone with an obviously duped mask.
---
Maybe this guy just bought it from a duper, but still...
---
Too bad youre not building a game thats going to last long term. Nobody is going to be playing this game for Battle Royale in 3 months, let alone 6 months. 
---
Shallow additions for small, short term gains. Battle Royale is not why 90% of this playerbase plays this game.
---
I have a stealthy(ish) sniper and I usually try to avoid the PA. I only bring it out for areas where I know I'm going to be swarmed in melee (ala the whitesprings club house or some West Tek areas) or for nuked areas or certain events.
---
Other than those I find I do just fine without it...better in fact as I can use stealth and being without PA tends to make me play differently and use more caution.
---
Thanks, saved me. I bought an outfit and was equally disappointed it goes away when you pick up armor.
---
What? How to launch a nuke or why did I decide to target the remaining safe zone on the map with the nuke?
---
I call it the "stub your toe" damage
---
Nice :)
---
Must give you a big advantage in game as well :)
---
Was hoping it was a perk that is given out around overseer lv10 :/
---
Oh legacy is  not a rifle, it’s a rare weapon perk combination. Rare because it doesn’t drop from enemies anymore.  
---
Legacy is defined as an explosive energy weapon.   Tesla, gauss, laser. Etc.
---
Hopefully the 5 raider gangs (cutthroats, gourmands, etc) are brought back to life .
---
Just don't do anymore gameplay affecting microtransactions please. You don't need anymore bad press and the game is better than people would think
---
Ohhh gotcha so how does one acquire such weaponry via perveryor?
---
"Many people are put off by not hanging human NPCs at launch" I hope that's autocorrect asking for hanging folks
---
Been playing since beta
---
Speed hacking?
---
Same xbox x
---
Someone set us up the loot.
---
Being able to camp on top of buildings right now is great. Not many people have the perk so most are confined to ground combat and don’t even think to look up. I suck at PVP though so it’s not a huge advantage LoL
---
Was this on PC or console? So crazy that people think stuff like this is fun and that they can't just practice till they are good on their own.
---
Lockpicks are being used by some players as ‘alternate currency’ since there is a 25k cap limit per character. 
---
It’s kind of like the ‘bitcoin’ of FO76, so I figure why sell those unless I really need to?
---
This is why I gave up NW after 10 rounds. Pretty obvious it was going to become a toxic cesspool ala GTA after only a few rounds.
---
They’re calling this the Nuclear Winter “sneak peek”... is the game mode going away for a time after the sneak peek is complete? Will our level be reset when it returns? I’d like to know just how hard I should grind this right now haha...
---
Froh legs needs 9 points in agility... but I agree 3 points in each stat should work for most cards.
---
Well, I have some, so you could get one from me.  Unlikely from the purveyor.  Prolly get an explosive mr handy buzz blade before you’d get a legacy weapon.
---
Had this repeatedly to the other night. Seemed to be fast travelling when clicking on the map. Was okay when using the social menu.
---
As often as it can be in adventure I'd figure nuclear winter would have some carry over.
---
how do you launch it? I have had multipe codes and the...suitcase is it? But never all in one match. What is the process once you have all the codes / suitcase?
---
Oh well atm I got a explosive handmade so will probs chill with that till I find the ideal energy weapon but if I happen to have the caps I’ll be sure to pm u
---
You're right OP, 50cal is the meta. Grenade launcher + frog legs is pretty OP too though. 
---
The lever action is the worst weapon in NW, close second are your bare fists.
---
I assume it's 250. I was at 295 with lifegiver, and that adds 45 hp
---
First session last night. My s/o and I team up and hop on with mics. 7 games, never heard a mic anywhere.
---
Blocker: -45% melee damage if you have it, to help against the Ladybots
---
Incisor/Martial artist at max rank if possible, of course the slugger/Gladiator perks just like panoflex said
---
Born Survivor, I guess which rank you use depends if you have a bloodied build or not. Sucks to die in the silo if you are alone and forget to stim in time
---
Lone Wanderer rank 2 or 3
---
Adrenaline rank 1 (optional)
---
Bloody Mess (optional)
---
Radicool (optional) if you can handle the decreased health
---
Stock up some +melee dmg food like glowing steaks and +str food (molerat chunks?)
---
If you have a spare melee bobblehead - use it
---
I found it surprisingly easy to do with my melee char around 50 (with All Rise too), had a way harder time with my heavy weapons guy around 70
---
If they have a mobile phone, it probably came with headphones/microphone. Those will work in a pinch. 
---
Even a decent basic gaming headset is $20, and is usable in a bunch of non-Fallout 76 games.
---
What does this card do?
---
You select the briefcase once you have the 4 codes. That's it. Dropping a nuke works exactly how it does in Adventure (pick a area, see the zone, confirm)
---
People knew the narrative reason for why we didn’t get NPCs; they were saying that the game was poorer without them so why weren’t they present. You could still have emerged at the tail-end of the scorched plague, where a few pockets of resistance remained. Still, hopefully that particular bone of contention will be moot with the release of Wastelanders.
---
Ya a tse (two shot explosive) handmade is a good bet. 😊
---
Apparently tagging more then 2 prople markes it as spam and doesnt tag people.
---
u/Ladydevann
---
maybe i mean i came here looking for all the prizes and once i saw no one had done it yet, so once i stared doing this list i already was lv11 so 1-10 was is going via memory but i can add the photo frame and box
---
Yeah iss also got the suppressor effect so it goes alright
---
I belive they will use L1 button (which was use for vats) for some kind of marking. It is hard to describe enemy location when there is mostly just trees and grass everywhere.
---
No problem. 
---
I actually like that the game became a bit more challenging, enemies can go to level 80-90 but we don't really get much stronger past 50 other than tweaking builds, means that some areas just aren't push overs. The real challenge after the quests are done is collecting items/plans etc.
---
I've become somewhat obsessed with collecting outfits (though no matter how often I try the hunters long coat STILL eludes me on xbox...depressing) and plans. I've got a huge collection of the outfits that I pass along to friends or sell in my vendor machines (usually for about 10-15 caps since they're extras - and some other players have sold ones I needed at that price - only fair to do the same and spread the fun of dressup!).
---
I spend a lot of my time just exploring the world now trying to make sure I've been to every single marked location.
---
Nope. The system wont let you hide. Its dumb and broken. I love the game but its absolute BS.
---
You can block for session inside of 76. Go to social and click the person and you can block or hide
---
Lol no
---
Is it auto and with a drum mag?
---
I'm talking about on console specifically. On PC i can get any Bethesda game to look incredible. Mind you thats only with mods, god forbid they make their default games look good and modern.
---
Make camp near river, get yourself corn from any farm, plant 20corn. Now you can craft 20 corn soups every hour, problem solved.
---
They respond more often when there are new things to respond to.  Questions/comments regarding NW will get responses.  Asking for the millionth time to get full character respec, the ability to convert ammo, or the ability to plant everything in our CAMPs will not get a response.
---
How am I trolling...?
---
They also sell accounts. Many people have no idea that the real loser is the person buying a leveled account to show off.
---
Not really
---
I, for one, am wondering why I am even wearing heels while traipsing about the West Virginia wasteland in my Nuka Girl getup (that outfit would still look sexy-sick with some Doc Martten style commando boots) but that’s just me ;)
---
Doesn't make it a fun game in any way.
---
Oh yeah drum mag long barrel reflex hardened automatic it’s amazing but if you have any decent grognak axes I wouldn’t mind purchasing those
---
Level 100 3\* fog crawler. So even hackers won't win.
---
A billion time THIS!
---
This is what worries me is Todd has specifically said the next TES game wont be on a new engine and how far behind the modern gaming scene bethesda is falling is pretty scary.
---
It’s not a big element and you don’t have to cook it really. you can mostly ignore it but you’ll always somehow have meat with you if you do get hungry
---
Did I say someone was??
---
It’s really not that big of a deal and it’s easy to maintain.
---
Pacifist.
---
Pretty sure they knew there's exploits possible so releasing this as intentionally "limited beta" so they can see what people did, explore it, fix it, then release with more complete version
---
Then no one would win. Ever.
---
I have one. It’s a max level 2 star instigating grog with 40% more power attack damage.
---
Scrap weapons &amp; armour to unlock mods for them! ;)
---
I had a map mod and weapon sounds mod and it wouldnt let me in without turning them off due to modified game files.
---
I guess
---
How much u want for it and what system u on
---
Since we could have duffel bags drop upon death, can have that in adventure mode? Its impossible to see/find a brown paper in grass bushes water. And it too small for places you get stuck or floating off in the distance.
---
It is though. It's their risk they took to get in.
---
I’m on Xbox.
---
Are u scrapping, or storing. Either u were using the wrong button u maybe just reload into the world and it will fix itself
---
Bummer was gonna saw I wanted to come see grumpy old man winter in person
---
Yes thats why I bought a game, so I can just look it up on the internet
---
Considering it's free currently. Yeah
---
Hey! That was good!
---
I moved since they asked for my address so mine is being delivered to my old address :(  luckily the people living there have our contact info
---
but ya, saw this shipment yesterday with no other info, first thing to cross my mind was that bag because i knew i didnt win any contest or anything.  thanks for confirming.
---
Omg I just did it using incisor and martial artist and it was so intense. Launched the nuke at Whitesprings and kill 1 bloated and crashed. Nooo... how typical. Not sure I’m in any rush to do that again.
---
sham, sham, sham.
---
Agh damn I’m ps4 but I’ve some Xbox friends I can send your way (they also use melee and energy weapons)
---
PS4. Scrapping, noting stored, i posted after reloging when it didn't do anything
---
Keep in mind this will be huge because of the free week, all you need is an email to create an account.  
---
After that, it'll cost people $30+ to buy the game to do this.  The amount of cheating will drop significantly.
---
How are you not?
---
 You sound like the brain dead zombie youtube watching sheeple who are absolutely convinced this game is garbage even though they've never played 1 single second of it.  You know, the kids who have others make their opinions for them.
---
 I am on PS4 pro as well and I don't see any of those problems you listed. I think the game is gorgeous and plays very smoothly.
---
 This game is obvious not for you.
---
Good luck finding that hunters coat!
---
yeah it does, but still, rather have 4 in a team than 3
---
Also not a fan of it.
---
but once I found out about the corn soup and planted some corn in my CAMP, the problem was solved.
---
Okay thanks yeah it maybe easy to maintain but its something that i hate that gameplay system in games so im gonna be uninstalling. Thanks for the quick reply and i hope the game keeps improving for everyone.
---
There is medic legendary weapons which heal teammates when you perform a critical hit.
---
Just submitted a ticket last night for THIS asshole:

Flying over the map, spamming a pistol with unlimited ammo, that killed in one shot and used an aimbot. We need a major crackdown on cheaters. Ban them PERMANENTLY, block MAC addresses, these people drive more players away from the game and hence lose you (Bethesda) more money than you will EVER make temp-banning and forgiving them and allowing them to just make new accounts. Coming down hard on cheaters benefits legit players AND ultimately your company's bottom line.
---
Apparently tagging more than one people marked it as spam and doesn’t tag people 
---
u/
---
it was a Sham, but i'm sad it wasnt better
---
Ok thanks.  The legacy info should be the same though.
---
Yeah maybe not, i was just thinking
---
Sounds good man
---
Nick was my favorite character in Fallout 4 and one of my all time favorites in the series. I could see them at least adding in his outfit to the atomic shop, and in that case, take my atoms!
---
...
---
If that 1 person ruins a game for you by cheating then maybe you aren't mature enough to be playing that game in the first place? I'm not gonna cheat I enjoy my long standing gamertags associated with them is really the only reason but if that nakes you rage and upset then you or whomever shouldnt be gaming online.
---
Yeah, like Steve I sell drugs for caps. They're light weight, pretty easy to find, and the vendor bots give decent caps for them. Always loot all the drugs.
---
Stabilized increase weapon accuracy and ignore target armor.
---
I think so my wife complains of this too
---
This is nuts. In adventure mode I have had this happen to me. But only when I had mods on that were not updated or my .ini wasnt updated. 
---
Maybe the guy got in with his mods still on? 
---
Also another glitch that I have seen is people losing all textures and soo they can see people from a distance cuase the map is just flat. Granted. They can't see stuff either. Happened to one of my team mates and he was blind as bat Haha. Kept running into trees and rocks. But he could see people who were behind stuff and in buildings. They didnt seem to mean this as the guy was a Free-bie and was freaking out about it.
---
Sounds op. I need it.
---
To listen to holotapes, one is longer than Quee. I was trying to record it and see it after sneak peak ends, but round start before holotape end.
---
I second this. Ash heap has a ton of enemies around your level as well as better loot. Also try the savage divide, and if you’re feeling ballsy the mire.
---
Have a lovely day. 😊
---
As long as you can’t spend actual legal money on the gambling currency it circumvents most laws. 
---
For instance, you buy gold bars in RDRO, so regular in-game paper money is able to be gambled with since you can’t actually buy it with real world dollars.
---
Anyone know if they are releasing the bags in waves? My ticket shows them confirming that I will get one (February) but I've seen no additional emails about it or shipping info.
---
This has happened with ESO people have forgotten the hate that had at launch and such the dick of Zenimax studios even though people hated it and the studio at launch
---
It's free to play, why don't you go look by yourself?
---
I know what you mean. I don't often have my mic on (my dog likes squeaky toys that sound horrible when the mic pics them up). Sharing any information is a struggle. 
---
I like the idea of a one button system but there's very little risk involved in over using it. I feel like it might take away from ambushes and escapes if everyone can tag everything all the time.
---
I'm sincerely curious what you would define as "leaps and bounds to better gameplay" 
---
Unless the game radically changes past the level 23 I got to?? Like coming from someone with over 2K+ hours on F3 and NV and even 200ish on F4 I objectively can't see any major improvements. Actually it's still a step BACK from New Vegas it seems. 
---
I actually have no issues with the story. After Fallout 4 I have very little expectations with Bethesda in terms of writing so I would have played this more as just a wandering survival game regardless, which is fine with me. 
---
Agreed the perk system is a semi interesting step in a better direction. And kind of going back to the series roots ironically. 
---
I'm actually really curious if you even read my post? All you talked about here was supposed gameplay improvements, perk system and the story mostly but I never mentioned any of those?? 
---
What I was talking about in my post is the shocking AGE of the game and it's engine. From bad textures to horribly clunky movement and combat to terrible FPS and server netcode with all the desyncs. The creation engine is archaic and Bethesda has for too long left modders to make their own engine better and it's scary now seeing what an untouched vanilla Bethesda game is like. I'm just not sure if they're lazy or incompetent or both 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Okay so...why is it bullshit?
---
Well the crash sucks, but at least you got your mission cleared :-)
---
And yes it's intense, especially the last minutes during launch prep defending the launch officers if you are alone
---
It's super ugly. Like a dunkin donuts looking pa
---
I got mine just last night. Minutes before I posted this.
---
Are u using excavator armour? The thing with that P.A is it’s meant to give you +100 carry weight but if you log out in it and log back in you end up with a bonus of +200 which your not meant to get, that’s the bug, when you step out of it and climb back in it registers the proper +100 carry weight and not the bug of +200
---
Yeah, that level of cheating is pretty pathetic.  
---
I remember when I was actively playing Final Fantasy 14, I used to get notifications/msgs from someone selling max lvl chrs or offering me a price for my chr, to which my response was, "I don't need to cheat, I will improve by my own effort, please go away"  and I always reported them to admins, let them sort it out.
---
NPC's at my camp?  So it won't feel like it's just me, a frog and the cat topiary anymore??
---
Also curious to why this is happening
---
If you pick locked the locker then yes same goes with mineral extractors
---
Nobody likes loading screens but it is tons of fun...I feel like it's sucked the life out of the main game though.
---
Dog food perk. Dog food is easily available and fills you up for a while. You can also make purified water at your camp pretty early on.
---
I think it’s more or less the fact it went free for a week, allowing people to see for themselves how it’s improved rather than getting the information second hand.
---
And also use  grape mentats
---
Hopefully they'll shoot sooner than turrets.  I don't care if they miss once or twice so long as they engage when enemies are attacking!
---
What will hapen if someone nukes them? They act like nothing?
---
Kind of annoying because I don’t think there’s a warning it’s the persons object
---
It definitely feels like an "adult" br.
---
You were trying to do that dupe thingy that was patches, don't you?
---
It’s the time to get new perks after leveling and to change them up.
---
The only reason I have razorgrain is to repair my cows....
---
Fashion endgame? What has this world come too?
---
Yes, but they're incognito.
---
There are ways through mutations and perks to cut it down but you can’t turn it off. There are substantial buffs with some foods and drinks so it’s work it in the end.
---
Was on a team with that guy last night. Myself and our other team member never saw another player and he could just shoot in the air and then the notice would pop up he’d killed someone. We were completely confused when all of a sudden we won and he’s floating in the air.
---
No idea, It’s probably an oversight TBH. A lot of people on this sub and elsewhere have mentioned wanting to be able to wear it and the others so I imagine a fix could be coming, esp considering this is just a sneak peek.
---
Pretty sure that's a feature, not a bug.
---
There should be a thing saying it is owned by someone, but if they've logged out recently, sometimes that will be missing, but the workshop won't be open for claiming yet. I'm assuming it is a safeguard for people disconnected, i.e. like a silent five minute timer in case they log back in quickly.
---
There's a dupe method with that way? I've been playing for over 600 hours now, I'm not an idiot who would dupe man and chuck all my effort away.
---
??? They've historically been very active on this sub. If we're being honest I've seen them less lately rather than more and when I do see them recently it's almost the same or some variation of the line, "I'll pass this along."
---
I think I know what happened. When the game says a workshop is under attack, it means a player is taking it from you. When it says defend it means NPCs are attack your workshop. I think that by the time you arrived at the workshop, the player already finished taking it. Therefore when you went to the locker and picklocked you got wanted.
---
An obligatory yet sincere,  Thank You, Bethesda.
---
Not officially stated yet, but I would say that towns (like the crashed space station) will be considered essential and cannot be nuked. Places with raider camps or settlers in houses which are not essential would have the NPCs run away from the blast zone before the nuke lands, and they would wait outside until the Fallout settles.
---
Agree!!! Ruined my outfit.

---
equip greenthumb perk and harvest the crops at silva and billings homestead .
---
I don't think this deserves to be down voted. 
---
It was very clearly bait and switch and they tried to keep it under wraps by blatantly ignoring the issue without telling anyone.
---
Yeah man... The miracles of the Radiation, I guess.
---
Ye, you renamed legendary, sold it, bought it back and it got duped somehow, i think, i just saw post about that, no experience, cause i got 600hours and i am going for 7600 not ban.
---
Between reaction videos and constant “reviews” that are really a whining shitpost....
---
Youtube has become unwatchable for me...
---
But people obviously adore this stuff because it keep coming.
---
But he lives in Boston?
---
Imagine instead of ''someone killed my pet sloth'' to ''someone killed my pet human''
---
As soon as the free week is up, but until then I bet they keep it to try to get more people hooked
---
Maybe I should give that a try. I picked a safe a few times just trying to see if there’s a pattern in RNG, half of the times it was a pipe gun, the other half was a handmade or a scoped lever action.
---
Lol Bethesda should have let you take the holotape the adventure mode and let u listen to it there.
---
If he is alive, there's no reason he'd be in West Virginia, he's on a crusade in Boston hunting down a certain criminal, which spoiler you help Synth Nick find and kill.
---
&gt;or a skeleton on a motorcycle.
---
 I know u want to be kind but that is just... what? Anyway it's true, how many people heard of him? I don't think many and he may have been a huge fan and all but adding him to the game is not necessary.
---
- How do you know I've never played 1 second of it? 
---
- So the game looks as good as all the other AAA games to come out since 2011? It looks as good as say RDR2 then? 
---
- Where did I say the game specifically is garbage? If you actually bothered to read the post you'd see I was talking about the ENGINE specifically. 
---
- So because you haven't run into any bugs or desync or AI getting stuck that means those things don't exist? 
---
- So you think the combat is better than even something low grade like Conan Exiles? Which at least manages to have a dodge key because it's got a functioning combat engine from before 2005? 
---
- So I love multiplayer survival games, BR games, 1000s of hours on Fallout and TES games and apparently this game isn't for me still? Who is it for then pray? 
---
God you silly fanboys are what's wrong with gaming these days and why Bethesda get's away with being so lazy. Is it really so hard for you to emotionally unattach yourself from the game to be objective, even slightly? Is really every little bit of criticism about your precious game so offensive to you? I said the game seems like it could be good it's just held back by it's outdated game engine which is TRUE and an objective fact it's OLD. 
---
Oh and for your information, oh lord of jumping to baseless assumptions, both myself and my girlfriend got to level 23 and played for about 30ish hours before finally putting it down. Sorry that's a bit longer than 1 second 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Huh well damn never knew that, I only find out about dupe glitches when they got patched or when Juicehead covers em, I just meant to scrip two armour pieces I didn't need, and then next minute my only good chameleon piece got sucked in.
---
They should make a play again button after you die
---
I guess I am mistaken then, to be fair I was out of the game for a while so I checked sporadically. I guess I missed them when I was there.
---
It’s a little backwards that the perks that make types of items lighter don’t function in the stash because a huge reason to have, say Bandolier, is to be able to sell ammo in your vending machine, but it weighs ten times as much in the machine than it does on your person.
---
It’s doing it by default every time you log in? It’s been doing that for me.
---
So chubby mole people have obtained true gender eqaulity. thats it im becomming a mole miner "puts on mask" murgh murgh murrr "gives thumbs up and digs into the earth never to be seen again"

Intelligence (3): Demolition expert: +80% explosive damage
---
Luck (1): Pharma Farma: Search NW chests for an 80% chance to find extra aid items
---
Perception(6): Fashion Finder: Nearby power armor appears on the compass
---
Then we might as well have Godzilla spawn.
---
Heels in the sky, western spy. Heels on the ground, comrade found.
---
Doing the Slavic squat yeah.
---
I have it but I don’t have the hard drive space right now. So I’m just seeing if it’s worth it
---
You could be one!
---
I looted an instigating explosive Dragon yesterday. On my birthday, even!
---
There is a dog and a cat NPC already....but they dont do anything.
---
I sell them for 200 caps scrub.
---
Nah this dude did it right. The tension of “does someone find me and harvest me like a game animal” is compelling game play!
---
I believe you can start making lever action rifles at level 35 - the plan costs 1,500, purchase from Camden Park or Welch, I think. That's a really good "base" weapon, around 75 to 100 damage per shot, with the damage multiplying with stealth and a silencer. 
---
I'm around level 90, and I still use my LAR as my base ranged weapon - found a legendary with a 20 shot clip. A hunting rifle properly modded can also do decent damage at your level. Make sure to get Concentrated Fire in Perception - you want that VATS headshot bonus.
---
cool, another part of my identity to celebrate during Pride!
---
Even as a sniper hiding up on the roof, keeping those brahmin alive with sheepsquatch and all those bugs is damn hard!!
---
2 choices really, 1. Block or 2. Lie by sending them an Xbox message and say a friend/relative will be playing on your account from now on and if they see you in the game they may be ignored as you friend/relative doesn’t team up and is antisocial, then proceed to ignore them while pretending to be someone else till they get bored lol
---
Yeah, text chat would be great, like a global or local one would be perfect. Also some way to message your friends on PC, like seriously, the only way I've found you can communicate/coordinate with your friends is by joining their world and talking to them over the mic. It would be a million times easier to just hit them up in a friends chat or something.
---
"The Purveyor: Legendary attributes are no longer removed from 3-Star Legendary Wood Armor pieces or Salvaged Assaultron Heads obtained from the Purveyor after logging out."
---
Thank you, now can you make wood armor able to drop as 3-Star normally?  **Wood** greatly appreciate it.
---
Godzilla will be in "Fallout 汉字"  that will be happening in nuked china.
---
Not even pc. Only a couple items can be placed like plushie but only from the atom shop.
---
You're not invincible when lockpicking or hacking or looting or in your pip boy right? 
---
So why should you get a free pass for the time it takes to step in to a mobile tank.
---
I like it but I think the cards need to be reworked a bit. I was getting killed awfully fast yesterday even in power armor and regular armor. I made it to rank 3 overseer but it seemed other players that were higher were doing way more damage.
---
Automatic weapons seem pretty op as well.
---
Hey, my name is Steve too, and I do the same thing! What are the odds? :)
---
I would trade out a torso mod for a backpack
---
Damn, but Godzilla can swim right? ;)
---
All it took was a battle royale that everyone is putting in games.
---
Meh, he probably wasn't carrying anything that bothered him to lose. I've got ~400 stimpacks between my toons and that's only because I stopped picking them up. At a certain point you don't really need them anymore and they stockpile pretty quick.
---
Same here but PC. Maybe the DECREASED the limit for NW?
---
Once you scrap you cant get back?
---
I read your post. I agree the engine has had no major improvements, in fact it is the same engine which is mind boggling. Right now the texture pop in and loading is horrible, it was never this bad until they added player vending and they tried to decrease load screen time, which personally I'd rather have a longer load screen versus being killed by sleeping or invisible enemies. 
---
The leaps and bounds is because the gunplay has been improved. I remember the other fallout games not being super friendly outside of vats. This is more refined in my eyes. It is not and never has been as good as the twitch shooters and that is ok. 
---
The worst part about this endgame is the lack of one. It's basically a farm fest and trade fest. They need more locked to high level missions or quests for end game people. 
---
With that being said I still enjoy this thoroughly, maybe it's because I have wanted to play with friends in a fallout game since 3. Then when you could build in 4 I was itching for a co-op experience and its finally here. The game is not perfect, far from it, but it is a great game with a growing list of things to offer. I can look past the graphics not being ramped to say RDR2 and other quirks because it is genuinely fun to me. I still find new things even after all the time spent here. What more can you ask for out of 60$?
---
yes, you can get quests like that.
---
The first couple of steps in Roses quest are in the Forest, but IIRC, then next step takes you to the Divide, and it goes downhill rather rapidly from there, leading you to places lower levels (under 40ish) are nor ready for.
---
M as is Mire, perhaps - the Mire is the top right of the map.
---
Or Mysteries quest, which will also eventually take you to higher level places.
---
Blue glowing things that chase you.....the flatwoods monster glows purple, but other wise fits - it's a random critter - the few times I've seen it, it's always a high level.
---
Yeah launching the nuke was all I was bothered about. I managed to get back in on the same server, now that was lucky.
---
Ahh okay that's good to know! I'll stay away from locked player camps in that case, is there any other way to become wanted?
---
I just found this out...wasted 700 hard earned atoms on them.
---
I’ve never had more than 500 caps at a time.  I dunno how people have so much
---
Thank you! I do remember seeing an option last night but I didn't bother, I'll bung one on there when I'm next on.
---
Power trip man.....
---
They are doing something others cant, and dominating them in the process....
---
The very definition of power trip.
---
Yeah, but i still accidentally use the map :(
---
what nickname in the game?
---
I mean in fallout 4 there is a very small chance for it to auctually work so maybe in 76 you can get it
---
When did this happen? Yesterday late evening my buddy tp'd to my house and got stuck in the foundation.
---
Hard bargain rank 3, sell all the crap weapons you get from your daily run through Camden et al.
---
camp at Charleston are great, i love them.
---
Thank you very much! I'll definitely turn pacifist mode on and nice to know the quest system is similar to FO4.
---
Bye! Thank you for being a part of this community, and good luck with your next game!
---
Google "resource map for FO76". Somebody made an excellent one way back in December, don't have a link for it.
---
I see that as a sellable mod often. Check the robot vendors out. You might just find one that way.
---
Maybe not NPC factions and storylines lol but atleast Camp decorations. I would love to do a Children of Atom camp theme or maybe a NCR theme camp.
---
I can confirm you can. they are very yummy
---
50xp in overseer xp is what, like 1/3 of a games worth? That’s not bad. It would be better to not get duplicates at all, but that ain’t bad.
---
Google's not your friend but helpful.

It has been only 25years, china is far away, idk how good of swimer she is, but if i had to swim from china to america, it would take me longer probably :D :D :D
---
And the damn Marine Armor Helmet!
---
And would it kill them to make the visor for the MAH translucent? :(
---
lol, this whole post makes you sound pretty powerless
---
Nooooo :(
---
already have done . found at harper’s ferry. thanks anyway
---
Remember how the roadmap mentioned a prestige update that would allow you to reset your level when 50+ and that you'd get access to special perks/skils or something like that?
---
Perhaps you'll get some of the NW perks everytime you reset, or for every 50 levels you had before the reset?
---
Awesome!
---
Oh crap - where did my gift emote go!? I "purchased" it when Bethesda was giving it away, but I no longer see it on my emote wheel or when I expand my options...also, it no longer listed under emotes in the Atomic Shop. I know I "owned" it!
---
Well, I know it works in general in 76. In fact, I actually got one in some random building one time. I'm just curious about the specific one in the Nuclear Winter Vault 51 Port-A-Diner.
---
I never said that you only played 1 second I said you sound like one of those kids who haven't. 
---
 This game plays and feels like a fall out game. I wouldn't expect anything more or anything less. I understand it's an old engine. I dont have issues with it like others I guess.  I think it still looks beautiful and runs great on my machine.  I am far more intrested in the actual gameplay than how it looks for any game.
---
Conan exiles has terrible combat.  Beautiful game but I couldn't get over how clunky that game felt to me.  It's actually very easy if you run around with a polearm poking everything.
---
Rdr2  Is most definitely a beautiful game as well but I couldn't tell you about the gameplay because I fell asleep of boredom in the 1st few hours.  Nothing says awesome gameplay like riding on of a back of a horse for one hour per mission. Fun stuff.
---
 I guess I'm not overly picky. I have A blast playing fall out 76.  The only thing that matters to me on a video game is if I have fun or not and this game is definitely fun for me.
---
You need to have very high luck to get the pie.
---
You actually got it out of the Vault 51 Port-A-Diner?
---
He could come to WV. like macready did.
---
There's a youtuber that does a review and how to unlock if that's your thing.
---
https://youtu.be/zIgUY11ArYk
---
You can kill players for there loot ? New guy here on pacifist atm
---
you can find even refined one at vendor bots. Refined increases the damage.
---
Mmm, drink in the rads, you were low HP and high on rads anyway, make this mistake again and you might accidentally die!
---
Cheers, 
---
-The Game
---
oh in 51, I haven't even noticed them in there haha sorry
---
Nah
---
would that be semi auto then?
---
Yes! Someone else mention the pacifist mode, I'll turn that on. Great tip on the corn soup though, I'll make sure to grab some corn and add it to the garden! 
---
We put down my camp first then out of curiosity she placed hers down fairly close to mine so we might have to move one of them if it's free fast travel, good to know! 
---
I've always loved the environmental story telling, my last rerun of FO3 I actually found a skeleton with his head stuck between a light and the ceiling dangling down above a ramp and crashed motorbike! Great to see they haven't forgot about that side of things, I'll keep my eyes peeled!
---
Ah, no worries. Still makes me wonder though. It's just sitting there. Taunting me to get and eat it in the ~2.5 minutes I have before each game.
---
That is definetly not quick. Oh my got so much effort, when you could play NW whole time. :D 
---
I gave you like for effort, good job!
---
Yep it’s like a total different game than six months ago. Liked it from the start but just way too many crashes and also the annoyance of pvp settings in Adventure. They’ve made literally TONS of changes in both stability and gameplay, transformed a fun game into an outstanding one. Thank you Bethesda for the beautiful wasteland! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
---
Lightwood laminate! lightwood laminate!
---
perhaps, maybe there is a way to those but I doubt it since you don't have anything but your clothing in there.
---
Think of it as a different game. You have to relearn how to play and figure out how to survive in such a short time (Compared to base game)
---
But..... but this community is only love......
---
Healing salve, lots of corn, tatos and mutaberries and invest in one weapon type, gotcha! Good looking out, thank you!
---
There’s cap stashes all around the map and the easiest way to find them is to just google a map for their locations. The cheapest way to travel to them all is also to get the perk which lowers fast traveling costs by 30%. Can’t quite remember it’s name.
---
Started the game at 11pm - enjoyed the game - looked at clock.......... Shit it's 5am. Good job I had nothing planned the day after lol :D
---
What is with that crap? There's no point to punching anyone in the vault so why do it. I'm trying to explore and get a map of the vault in my head in the couple minutes before the game launches and these idiots keep getting in my face punching me. So far I think I have about 30% in my head after a dozen matches, if not for the fools I would be done by now.
---
Haahaha! Crop, foundation, pot, done. It's only not quick if you like things fancy and symmetrical like I do. Thanks for the like though.
---
Pick a spawn location and server hop (a lot), thats how I got it.
---
Honestly. I know their E3 wasn't the sexiest, but all the updates made me feel like they're sticking around.
---
I’ve never had that problem. With melee I typically one hit people if I can get to them.
---
The Bethesda peeps don't usually comment on the angry and bitter and salty posts. Can't say I blame them. Who wants to open themselves up to that?
---
You get more flys with honey than vinegar and comments from Bethesda work the same way.
---
That's from data-mining. While probably credible, people still want to see actual real time number.
---
Sounds like golden advice! I'll head out to gather those next time I'm on and keep the scrapping thing in mind, thank you!
---
people are catering to the influx of E3 noobs..
---
also Winter...
---
I'll keep an eye out, thanks.
---
I'm also nervous about playing nuclear winter. Only my husband plays fo76 so I'm concerned random teammates will hate me..but they have to remember that everyone was a newbie at one point. If you're on PS4 you are welcome to join.
---
You've already got 1 kill! If you keep at you'll get more. Everyone is new to this mode. Soon you'll look back and fondly remember when you were bait...don't forget your old chums.
---
I have to say, after the early bungles, I gave up on this game, despite the excitement for it I had up through the initial launch.  However, seeing how hard the team worked to win us over, how much effort went into fixing the issues, and bringing us features we wanted, has me playing again.  Looking forward to see what more we find in Appalacia!
---
It was popular to join hatetrain, that's why.
---
I'm with you. Never really noticed a lack of NPCs.
---
There is automatic 38 receiver exist but im not sure about refined 38 auto receiver.
---
Yep just collect the stuff dropped by the mob you killed, nearly everything can be sold, from weapons to chems and even their meat and fluid. Boost your charisma, it helps a lot with the selling price.
---
Don't forget to SMASH that like button
---
So far I've been pleasantly delighted actually so fingers crossed it doesn't disappoint! But thank you for the help, I'll get on making healing salve and selling stuff to the vendors.
---
Still wouldn't really make sense. He'd be like 60 years old walking across the country for no reason
---
No, nuclear winter was released, wastelanders is update with human npcs
---
Add a sound notification for when it's time to pick a drop spot too, and you've got my vote. I'm usually afk in the waiting lobby and I've missed it quite a few times.
---
More like a balanced PvP system.
---
Please name a BR that balances in matchmaking
---
I could probably play Nuclear Winter for a year and not kill 19 people.
---
I'm gonna guess it was in the big plan all along. Why? Cause it would take more than a couple months to code that shit.
---
I was thinking the exact same thing. While consoles may not have the hifi capabilities of some PCs, at least I’m not getting instagibbed by modders online.
---
Damn :/
---
It's in your weekly challenges. Map, menu, challenges, weekly.
---
When you decide to post a 'shout-out' for people to team up with (in whatever sub-reddit) don't forget to put what platform and if you have a mic or not. I'd also put the time zone you are in as well to make possible replies more relevant and helpful. Enjoy your adventures in Appalachia :)
---
It was the thing to do......lemmings love to follow eacb other.
---
As a 50 yod gamer, I am used to bugs and issues at launch. How one could expect a game this ambitious to NOT have bugs proves how many people have no clue how MMO games work.
---
Been playing non stop since beta, the Lore , community (that actually plays the game) and environment, have med this my favorite game in the last 5 years.
---
How does launch work?
---
The launch didn't go too well, from what I've heard the game was a horrible bug nightmare. The whole canvas bag problem and the Nuka Dark rum scam.
---
Super mutants are bullet sponges period. If you want to level fast stay in and around whitespring. I went from 15 to 70 in about a week just by whacking ghouls lol. Less than one full run in WS will level you up.
---
I AM a woman, and the last paragraph makes me cringe. =/ The lowest denominator of women are no better than the lowest denominator of men.
---
BR is a bit like an action movie, and you're the unwilling systems analyst that was added to the mission at the last minute: not the most experienced in combat but a wildcard who can turn the tide of battle by luck, growing experience, or by giving another distracting target to worry about in a firefight. If this gamemode was The Rock then it sounds like you might just be it's Nicholas Cage
---
I see what you mean, saw a post of a guy who fell for the same fate as me, now whether he was trying it or not, no clue that this happened or was a thing though.[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bzfx6z/legendary\_exchange\_wont\_sell\_back\_stuff\_whose/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bzfx6z/legendary_exchange_wont_sell_back_stuff_whose/)
---
I've been surprised at how many female players there are. Met quite a few.
---
You can try the battle Royale at anytime. Everyone starts with no gear or weapons and levels don't affect anything except perk cards which you get also. The radiation from the sink is just confusing, idk why Bethesda added that. As with the "not in the open world part" you might have just loaded into a relatively empty server, that happens sometimes.
---
This is the challenge of adventure!!! Dont cheat and look up your answers......learn as you go....its much more rewarding than leveling up as fast as possible.
---
Ugghh just happened to me with a my three star chameleon piece ;-;
---
Man i feel ya, I just made a post and the most helpflu comment (not) was being called a duper.
---
Nah, more so for the Fallout Tactics fans.
---
My Best guess will be at the end of october at the earlyest.
---
In previous iterations of FO, I didn't play hardcore, so I rarely ate/drank either. 
---
76 forces you to do so, and yea, I found it annoying at first - but you'll get used to it.  
---
There are perks that make the effects of food, drink, and chems last longer.  
---
Equipping those will make it a little less bothersome.
---
My own method is one that has been mentioned already.   Clear an area of enemies and sell their gear.   Where to go is of course depends on your level.   If you can get regular areas with super mutants you are set, all those assault rifles sell very well.   Scorched can be good and mole miners drop plenty of gauntlets and shotguns.   You use hard bargain 3 to sell the gear.    In my own case before I sell that gear off I sell off the excess aid/food items I have then the gear.   If I have leftover gear then I now have extra scrap I can use.    You can supplement all the above by extending your gear run.   My one regular one was Pleasant Valley than south towards Whitesprings collecting everything to sell.  Yes I was overweight and waddling along but I was always able to hit my daily cap limit.
---
Ammo is not hard to do for the most part.     Lead from the Lucky Hole mine will quickly overwhelm you with the amounts it generates.   Steel is a bit more work.    The limiting factor for most people with regards to ammo is acid.      
---
 Acid to smelt the ore and acid to make gunpowder.     You can scrounge for lead and steel scrap but if you have acid you can really do so much more for ammo.
---
If you happen to be on PC I can show you in the game how I go about things.   Just let me know.
---
Fallout Capture the Flag!
---
The game has enough cheaters already. Nota a good idea.
---
And crystal to repair the darn thing, which is a real pain in the ace. They break so fast there’s really no practical use except for occasional fun.
---
It is free. You just have to own the base game.
---
Thank you for the 100s of hours of fun and frolics! Really looking forward to Wastelanders, started building a new house to celebrate. Any hints on when it's gonna drop?
---
OH HEY I RAN INTO HIM AS WELL!!!!
---
he was using an automatic lever action sniper to take out half the map
---
Cheaters?
---
I won't go into the rest of it as I do largely agree with you and hey if you've had fun then that's great and ultimately what matters most right? For me it's just really a shame as Bethesda used to be my favourite developer and made some really amazing games I thought back in the day when standards were a bit lower like Morrowind, Oblivion and Fallout 3. So it's just sad to see them now being overtaken by basically every other developer out there purely because Bethesda's either too lazy, incompetent or cheap to bother upgrading or making a new game engine. Heck even Ubisoft can do RPG's now better in most areas which 10 years ago I would have laughed at in disbelief. 
---
However I'm still really curious what you feel has improved gameplay wise? For me it felt identical to Fallout 4 in terms of animation, sluggishness, clunkiness and so forth, trying to aim and shoot at a moving target is just a hassle basically. I've never ever played Bethesda games for their combat, as it's usually always very poor and that was okay because they made up for it in their NPCs and stories and world building and such. But most of thats getting worse not better and they have so many piles of cash it's hard to excuse them for not fixing their engine. Heck modders in fallout 4 made the combat much better than what Bethesda themselves can do and thats just not okay.
---
Yeah, wouldn't say everyone mate. 
---
https://youtu.be/ghdOSTAda1w
---
Not just the video, read all the comments.
---
Yeah got 2 this week....
---
Second was a bloodied.
---
Nah, people that rely on overpowered builds and vats, which is basically an aimbot with a build in chance to hit someone suck.
---
It takes no skill to mow down people with the right gear and vats.
---
Hi, thanks for replying.
---
This is all very helpful. Thank you.
---
I am on PC in Australia. I’m not online right now however, If you would be able to show me sometime whenever you are online, that would be great.
---
Thanks again :)
---
Most likely, since you keep everything you unlock.
---
#1- they didn't explicitly state November.  They've always said fall 2019.
---
#2)- E3 not EA
---
I know but what are the legendary effects of the weapon and what weapon it is? That’s what I asked.
---
Had to reset my Xbox to factory settings back in December. Game totally bricked my console. No problems like that since then.
---
Pretty sure you're ok. Whatever problem caused it was fixed.
---
Because it was bad, you got 3 hours video showing all fo76 glitches
---
No, NW is in pre BETA testing. It's only out for a week or so. It hasn't been fully released, this is just a sneak peek of what it will be.
---
Follow the main quest to get the plans to all the workbenches. Then I'd just start grinding for lvls
---
So you wouldn't have more fun if the game was on a more modern engine and was less clunky? Like that would make the game worse if Bethesda improved their engine to bring it anywhere near every other game released in the past few years by their competitors? Heck they could even just use mods because the modders have made fallout 4 and it's combat much more interesting and far less clunky.
---
...for now.
---
&gt; Just look at your average player, kitted out in full PA or marine armor wielding weapons that even without the legendary effects would be boss grade weapons.
---
Except those times wil be easy to get for everyone while getting the right set of legendary items is luck based and can take forever.
---
Todd is always watching, looking for new ways to port skyrim
---
Yes he made a typo no reason to get downvoted
---
Ugh I swear that’s what I’ve been doing. And it hasn’t been working
---
This article stops at 17 June. And after that? Are they going to post a new one?
---
Will they merge if you have them in your stash box when you complete the bos questline? I have maybe 100 in my stash, but don't know if they'll become one :/
---
Guess I should be thanking Bethesda like everyone else for.....fixing mistakes that shouldn't be in the game? Adding a fucking BR mode? Making the game somewhat playable a year after release? I can hear the paid crowd from E3 in this comment section.
---
Not everybody uses vats and theres ways to counter vats without using stealth boys
---
Thank you so much. I would’ve had to punch myself so much if I missed this. I assumed the initial one covered all the sets 😅
---
Ah he's just a puppy
---
You need to send team invites while everyone is in the main menu.
---
awesome!
---
Yeah thanks mate, I think PC players don't like thinking of the consequences of what they ask for.
---
People have been duplicating legendary gear for months. Every time Bethesda fixes 1 exploit, they find more. I'm pretty sure they are at least a part of the reason updates don't happen on time occasionally.
---
an invincivble camp destroying puppy
---
I would think so maybe if it’s not in the latest patch notes
---
You nuke people by getting nuke codes off of special Scorched and a Keycard by shooting down special drones. You have to be a general of the enclave though which you get near the end of the questline.
---
Then you'll have to fight thru the silo, which is hard or impossible depending on you're level
---
You get perk card packs every 2 levels till level then then every 5
---
Oh god please no. I don't want forkknife kids in this game. The free week thing going on is the best thing that they can do.
---
it doesnt work with NW which really needs one.
---
Keep up the good work, this game just keeps getting better.
---
Thanks, the only useful response so far. It seems like the others reply before even reading the thread.
---
Yh but in nuclear winter u can't use those legendaries
---
if you dont have anything nice to say, dont say anything at all. in other words, shut your bitch mouth.
---
What would happen if at the end of the game a solo player and a team of four were left with the one player hidden up on Gorge bridge and the team of players below them, and the crypted that spawns in turns out to be a sheepsquatch on the ground though?
---
Those bug compliation videos were pretty fake though; all of them contained beta footage mixed with launch footage, and none of the youtubers that were jumping on the "news" bandwagon bothered to fact check anything.
---
No, they are giving false information by saying "November" ...that is where the downvotes are coming from and why I stated it as reason # 1.
---
I finally convinced my cousin to play this game and he absolutely loves it. You know it's a great game when you can replay through the beginning missions with a friend and still spend hours just exploring Morgantown and still enjoy it. 
---
My cousin and I have always been couch-co-op gamers, and this helps bring back the feeling, at least for me.
---
No
---
How cute whats his name?
---
I am on EST and work a constant graveyard shift so my hours are not regular North American hours.   Ill send you a message and we can work out a time.
---
And I think if u move ur camp he will  go away
---
his name is mud now
---
Yeah but on top of that, nw going free to play attracts the same crowd that made apex legends basically unplayable. I don't want Bethesda having to waste more time fixing any possible exploit those types will inevitably use.
---
Sounds like you are using a 10mm or a 38.
---
Pick up a sniper rifle (308 or 50).   308 snipers are relatively common, and can be found on many rooftops.  
---
You can also a hunting rifle for a full stock and a scope.
---
Should take down a L16 mutant in 2-3 shots depending on your perks.
---
Combat rifle (45 semi-auto) should do well against them too.  
---
Combat rifle will also work well for the mole miners you are likely running across now.
---
If you are a melee build, a L35 death tambo, mole miner gauntlet.
---
@38, you should be able to do a WS run, especially non-nuke - you'll likely get at least one legendary weapon there.
---
And thank you for actually taking what we want into account. I know you said no human NPC's, and then gave us exactly what we asked for (human NPC's).
---
Thank you again for listening to your community and always communicating with us no matter what.
---
I really wish BioWare adapts the same approach with Anthem, but sadly they just seem to be set on ignoring their community.
---
No what?
---
Well to be fair, if you wanted any kind of challenge from FO4 you had to play on survival anyway, and that wasn't even tough enough at times. So I'm kinda glad it's there. But it's pretty easy to maintain through corn soup.
---
There’s always a bigger fish

Yikes, chill out. You weren't very clear in your post.

---
No problem!
---
Jesus!
---
There are no-clipers and flying gods... Imagine that x1000 if the game was free
---
Yh probably the only people who did those exploits where like gta5 tryhards fortnite fans and pubg people
---
dont want to move camp..i jumped servers amd now he is gone
---
Because I already knew about this article and they mentioned it as “sneak peek” so I assume it won’t be a regular thing, that’s why I asked for (another) source.
---
Yeah thanks for the reply. I appreciate that there are ways to ease the system to make it less intrusive but that is not something I want to deal with at all in any way. I hope you continue to enjoy the game it's going to be a no from me.
---
Yeah, after you die you can spectate the team that killed, then the team that kills them and so on.
---
Sounds good. :)
---
Oh thanks I will look for you!
---
No. That’s dumb. Don’t use a dead guy for karma
---
That's the West side. I need the east side to get to the terminal and the holotape.
---
OK well I wanted to get a megasloth but don't think that that's a good idea
---
Not really, I’ve killed a few with lever action. The worst are pipes with the fake reflex sight, you hardly see anything.
---
It was never as bad as people made it out to be from my expierence. Patch 1 pretty much solved most of the worst crashes (that weren't caused by idoots duplicating items)
---
I hope we encounter maybe some great grand parents of characters of Fallout 3/4
---
I’m not using him for karma, I can care less for karma
---
This was supposedly fixed Monday with the update.  It's in the patch notes.
---
It is 10 bucks on Gamefly bro I ordered it yesterday.
---
Maybe, but i played since start and I cant say it was 60€ worthy game
---
They couldn’t hate Destiny forever and needed another game to bash on for the next 5 or so years. Bashing EA doesn’t make money anymore. Game has improved but still lags behind Anthem in their eyes, because like I said , EA doesn’t attract attention anymore.
---
Really? I didn't know that. I guess it's not surprising since anything can become a currency in the game as long as it has some form of scarcity and people have a sense of trust in it.
---

Gotta love how someone actually downvoted NOT wanting hackers to come ruin the game mode. Astonishing.
---
Try it. Don't like it? Switch it. Simples.
---
An inside Job
---
This is hilarious!!!!!!! :D
---
Nobody cares about a random dead guy
---
what would you go for in your personal opinion
---
I don't mind the eating and drinking, I only wish my character didn't have to eat and drink so much all the time.
---
Sry but the Xbox performance is bad... this has nothing to do with servers
---
When I say cryptid I really mean the originals. Mothman, grafton monster, faltwoods minster, windigo. Also that's quite a scenario you came up with and it seems VERY unlikely.
---
Yep. And that's ridiculous. They even stopped communicating with us on the forums and subreddit.
---
Seriously, we have to get our Anthem news from third party leak sites and YouTubers. How messed up is that? And now even [MMOG Fails](http://mmogfails.blogspot.com/) seems to have stopped giving Anthem updates, so its even harder to be excited about anything they have coming.
---
Seeing Bethesda do what they do makes me both happy that I play Fallout 76, and sad that I spent $80 on the LoD edition of Anthem, only to have it be available for less than $15 3 months down the line. Say what you will about Fallout 76, but it was never that heavily discounted until just recently.
---
maybe 2 minutes of in game time
---
You seem to care since you are posting on this
---
The west side was actually open. I just need the east side for the note and to see the map.
---
That’s my problem with it. If I ate as much as my character did I would be huge!
---
I'm on PS4 but i'm far from normal.
---
It also a gameplay element I'm not a massive fan of but honestly really easy to manage once you level up and get used to it.
---
You have a tonne of perks that help deal with this, such as slower hunger times or increased gain on food+drink. I had the perks making food/water fill me up more.
---
Once you level up enough to make a proper base, you get industrial water extractors that allow you to generate water passively. I normally have 20-40 water on me at all times, and can grab more whenever I need; I'll never get thirsty now.
---
As for food you can eat most enemies honestly. Most creatures will drop their meat that you can eat, other than humanoids of course. You'll just find food passively as well. If not your thing, you can build your own crops just like with the water and produce your own food.
---
I personally have the meat eater mutation that makes it so I can't eat vegetables anymore, but meat fills me up x2 the normal amount. I also have another perk that removes rads from eating, so I can pretty much eat anything without issues.
---
There's a player spawn mat in miscellaneous in build mode!
---
Nah just pointing out that it’s a dumb waste of time that you are using for karma. 
---
I mean dead guy upvotes to the left
---
Shit I moved since this whole thing. Hoping my change of address I put in about 15 days ago reroutes this.
---
If you have a good build not a food and scrap carrying build you can taie out anything with a normal non legendary weapon. You just need the right perks.
---
Oh I don't just like it, I love it. Ingenious really to link the modes like that. And the cosmetics! Oh mama!
---
Now please just make Overseer level account based and not character based.
---
Please and thank you.
---
Wasn’t me by the way. But am I getting this right? You are afraid cheaters will ruin the game, so best thing to do is to avoid attracting players to it?
---
As long as you don’t act like a child and cry over everything it’s fine
---
I did yes. It is not possible for people to fly arround and just give themselves weapons and ammo is it?
---
Some things are not easily preventable such as aim botting. I have played a I know what you mean.
---
Its hard to prevent cheating without preventing the player from doing basic tasks like aiming. That is why overwatch exists after all.
---
I hope you understand better now why I used CS:GO as a comparason. I choose it for its good networking implementation.
---
Centurion at Level 73!
---
Now i’ll be shouting Deus Vult in the Microphone
---
Lmao. If you are playing an online game on PC then there will be hackers. There is literally no way to stop it. Sure you can ban accounts but it will keep happening. Thank God I only use my PC for single player game modding.
---
So we just dont care anymore about the obvious unobtainable item this guy has?
---
Lol. But are you as active as your character? Fighting monsters and muties can be quite a calorie burner...I imagine.
---
I have the plans for that, but I still use the flaming 10mm SMG from the robot in the water park up in the north west.
---
Well I’m not using him for karma, I would find more effective ways to get karma
---
Have you read the terminals in the BR lobby? Info tucked away in those. Some are locked for higher overseer levels.
---
He was part of the 2nd generation of Synths so I don't think he already exists
---
100% with you on this one. Pre ordered, only to be pretty much scammed by epic for abandoning the product I paid for.
---
It was still fun even at its buggiest.
---
45;  higher damage and the usable life of the rifle will be longer.
---
I used a (45) combat rifle to take down my first (several)  scorchbeasts.
---
It's under weekly challenges
---
LOL. Points to you my good sir.
---
This post brought to you by "We Rate Sloths".
---
I have a ten mm. I’m going to get a .45
---
I use a shotgun, the blade of baset or whatever it’s called, I use a hunting rifle for sniping and a combat rifle with amor penetration
---
Yeah ok
---
...that's genius.
---
Harsh to instantly assume the gun was duped, but eh, I also hate higher levels (says me who's level 260). You'll get higher levels just try and take workshops from other higher levels since it's a gateway back into the ol fest of a show months ago when explosives could ignore Slap damage limits, just how some people like to watch the world burn, I tend to just manually farm stuff and only claim workshops for atoms, and then instantly quit.
---
I mean from what I've seen on other posts, there's a few already doing it (flying in the air, phasing into the ground, aimbots ECT) and its the very reason I uninstalled apex like 2 weeks in. Granted I play on ps4 so I'm unsure if it'll affect my personal gameplay all the much. I just don't want a game I've been playing since laugh to devolve into that. I already have been match made with small children far too often even this week.
---
I'm drunk or high most evenings, start talking about the most random things and forget what i'm supposed to be doing sometimes lol
---
You seem to have high expectations of what a game will look like when your only there for a free week. The pistol one is fair but the no players (why would players mostly already done the story hang around the starter area) and the nukes issue (you're level 2. They said that's endgame shit) are weird things to be mad about. What platform you on? Maybe I can help you. But the free week is about a taste, not playing the whole game through for free.
---
When you take a workshop you’re accepting the possibility that  PVP can and will happen. It’s just part of the game man. I don’t think it’s because of your low level he attacked you. I’ve been attacked and killed many times while owning a workshop and I’m a 225 plus level player.
---
I'd definitely love a solo and/or duo mode.  I almost always play NW solo or with my gaming buddy.
---
It has been better but not flawless. I spawned inside Senneca rocks mountain at one CAMP and inside the ground at another two...
---
Overall it has been at least a 75% improvement however.
---
Of course with NW taking the payer base away from Adventure mode the number of vendors to visit has dried up considerably so time will tell
---
That whole vender thing happened to me about 30 min ago. He was level 220 I think I open the vender to unload some stuff and within seconds it's just some a hole shooting and trading me over and over again....so I kept it open an extra long time. If you people want someone to leave a vender wait in line and don't be a jerk or it will end up taking even longer.
---
PM me with questions and I'll answer. Post format is real hard.
---
And still very VERY radioactive, and inedible.
---
I've had the game make that choice for me. I click close to my team and my dot appeared in a random location nowhere near where I intended.
---
Viscous versus Vicious.
---
Although u/yisthissocomplicated seems to have them the wrong way around.
---
You don’t need to destroy your camp, you can store it.
---
Keep up the good work Beth's! We all appreciate it :).
---
Eh, honestly best you can do is go to Bethesda support and report a player. Reported a bug here and got called a duper, since that seems to be the "ur mum gay" of this game, so unless you have fifty other redditors saying the same, it's best to just go straight to bethesda support and report it there.
---
I had a teammate last night who spawned on nearly the other side of the map, died fairly quickly, and then started bashing the rest of us on voice chat for not saving him.
---
Folks are crazy.
---
oh right...cause you are so powerfull sucking bethesdas dick or what? dont make a fool of yourself
---
Well there are other players who aren't just looking for legendary items to buy.
---
I don't bother much as I'm looking for unusual items and plans, legendary items are likely overpriced so I'll take chances with Scrip.
---
But to be fair to you - perhaps a legendary counter? A category on the list of items that the vendor has ie. "L - 5" indicating that 5 of the items this vendor is selling are Legendary. Doesn't detail what they are just that there are some to keep it very simple. Would that work?
---
Although I think that what happened to you was unfortunate, I wouldn't want to see you get banned from here, too, for not following the rules. Please see rule #9, "No witchhunting", which says that we're not allowed to name and shame in general, among other things.
---
oh yeah, that would be awesome
---
There is no anti material rifle
---
For the most part yeah. If you played Fallout 4 at all the building designs are pretty similar. Though I would say there are more open houses in 76 than 4.
---
Is this your first time playing a Bethesda game?
---
&gt;  By the way, you can particularly tell when it's a person's pet because its owner's camp turrets absolutely refuse to aggro onto it.
---
That's a reliable way to tell?  Guess they have made some advances in turret AI since I started playing.
---
But I thought that since the factions didn't work together, they met their own demise showing that working together is better. We as Vault 76 entered the aftermath and learned from their mistakes and worked together to fight the plague because the resources we're there for us. That's why we were chosen as the brightest and best of Appalachia.
---
Some left because they knew it wasn't going to happen which is why they are coming back. They see that Vault 76 was the ones who turned this situation around and heard that Appalachia was become stable enough to return but they had their own foe, each other (different factions). I'm willing to see NPCs from each faction and not just settlers and raiders.
---
It really isnt. Thats just the case if you only follow people that happen to be positive. Judging from the main fallout and games/gaming subreddit people have simply given up on this subreddit because anything negative just gets downvoted until it disappears.
---
Don't use racist, threatening, or homophobic language and you won't get yourself banned.
---
Believe it increases the value actually
---
Adios muchacho
---
👉😎👉
---
25k is max
---
There's no way I would change my agility for that card. My strength and intelligence is maxed out.
---
I just want a functional pool table.
---
Personally I really like it. It only appears once you've fired the first bullet as well, so it isn't always on.
---
It speeds up the gameplay a little and makes it so everyone isn't crouching through bushes slowly trying to stealth kill everyone.
---
Ooo, I've been tempted to move my nose lately too. Aside from centre-face, where would you suggest is the best place to have a nose? Where did you end up moving yours?
---
We must be playing a different game. I was really impressed with the graphics and overall gameplay. It also runs damn near flawless for me, however I do have a nice gaming computer.
---
What's the point of playing the game like that?  It is like proving you are a tough guy by beating up a group of toddlers.
---
In order for PvP to work you need to remove legendary effects and many perks, just like NW.
---
Wastelanders has been released for Xbox 360 only sorry
---
Truth.  I can pick up close to 1,000 shotgun shells without even really trying.
---
Another special that I won't change my stats for. I'm built for strength and intelligence but good to know that there are stronger cards.
---
Jumping on the hatetrain was a guaranteed way to get likes and/or views. I posted a thread on r/fallout recently asking what they thought of the free trial and they said it was bad because of glitches they declined to actually give examples of or the most petty things imaginable, like someone jumping around in vault 76.
---
Pipe with glow sights (FO4/Adventure) is better than that reflex rubbish which just obscures the action.
---
Thank you! Surprised people charge so much if it won't all be credited lol
---
No! I like it on there.
---
I sell all of my chems, collect weapons and armor to sell, and, if I’m not busy, farm purified water to sell in bulk.
---
Also, if you have any, sell your plans at a lower price in your store. I find that plans are some of the most in demand item, and I that’s the only thing that I can reliably sell to other players.
---
&gt; They were the vanguard for all the (much deserved) 76 hate at launch.
---
No "hate" was deserved.  Some criticism was deserved, some was totally spurious.
---
That would be great for an alt, or lower level, but I'm not sure about the price.
---
I’m not so...
---
1.  The intro is weak, there's no denying that.  76 takes a very big assumption that you played Fallout 4 and are familiar with the mechanics, either that or that you are willing to learn as you go.  You'll see tooltips pop up for some things as you're starting out, but they are easy to miss and don't tell you everything.
---
2. You take radiation damage simply from touching the water.  As for where the cartons you put it in come from, it's just simpler for them to spontaneously exist, even though in other games you might have to have jars or bottles to collect water first. 
---
3. Any time!  Until it goes away anyways.  In BR mode, levels only reflect how much a person has played and presumably their skill level.  Everyone's stats are essentially the same, but your special cap limits CAN go up or down depending on your character's adventure level and loadout.  You may choose to wait until you've maxed out your number of skill points at least, but that's up to you. 
---
4. If you left the vault, you were in the open world.  Some people do get a fluke where they are the only person on the server, but I'm more inclined to believe there were just no other players nearby.  There's no way to get a private server right now. 
---
5. You'll learn how to launch nukes as part of the main quest.  You can't launch them before then. 
---
6. Everything causes radiation, from eating and drinking to taking melee hits from ghouls to walking near radioactive areas.  You can most easily cure it with packages of Radaway, which you can find in medical containers or for sale by vendors. 
---
7. Yes, you get a skill point every time you up until level 50 where you then get to choose from moving a skill point or picking a perk.  You get packages of perk cards every five levels which you can then choose from when assigning your perks.  Each perk card has a number on it which corresponds to how many SPECIAL points it requires to equip it.  If for example, you have 10 points in strength, you can equip three strength cards with a cost of three and a fourth with a cost of one.  When you level up and can choose a perk, you can choose to pick a new one, or get a duplicate one and use it to level up by combining them.  You can't own duplicate cards at multiple levels, but you cannot have two of the exact same card equipped.
---
Hope this helps!
---
So let me get this straight? You had your arse handed to you on a plate over a pvp workshop so you sent abusive messages and now you're banned? ... Ha
---
I would guess people price things that high that they want trade offers for
---
When a level 100 takes a workshop from a level 30 for no reason and when the level 30 says What the hell? And then the level 100 says haha... how would that make you feel?
---
Unfortunately, game chat on is super quiet compared to the environment.
---
Very useful, thank you!
---
Had a lvl 47 guy stand there lighting me up with a gatling plasma while I did my vender sales once. I just looked at him for a solid minute like "are you sure? Are you really sure about that?" He kept on so with a sigh I unholstered my lovely AAE radium and triple tapped him 3 shots.....thats all it took. Didn't feel to good about that but i couldn't have him ruining my whitesprings run. 
---
The moral of the story is don't come at lvl 100+ people while on power armor and under lvl 50.
---
Doubt
---
I don't follow people on twitter lol. Don't really care for creators that cover Fallout. I just go directly to the main pages.
---
Just quickscope. Ez.
---
There's enough open buildings for it not to feel too closed off.
---
No that is not how it went down
---
A combination of (1) team don't use their microphones PLUS (2) they chose to thoughtlessly spawn in a super high traffic festival of death area.  I can deal with any one of those, but not both.
---
One of the best things about RDR2 online is the fishing.  Some people only play it for the hunting and fishing.  I would love to see that added as an update to the Ever Upwards quest continuation.
---
Missions, events, sell items.
---
It won't. That's only for USPS. Plus, UPS will charge you to deliver to a different location. Bethesda should have verified addresses after how long it took.
---
Not for me, I played 4 games last night 3 in teams and one solo. Consisted of trying to get together with team mates only to be run over by a team with a guy in power armour at 1:30 into the first game.
---
Two shot by a team at 2:00 minutes into the second game while dodging in and out of cover peppering them with a grenade launcher (and doing nothing).
---
Group massacred in third game at 2:30 in third game by a team...don't know where they got the heavy weapons so fast...
---
Solo fourth game I stayed away from everyone, snuck and hid until last nine then was two-shot by a guy with a gatling gun after I tried sniping him with my scoped pistol...shot him three times, scratched him, he stepped out with gatling gun at fair range and I was dead in seconds.
---
Just frantic running around jumping like mad or you're dead.
---
Question for the experts here though - I found a suit of power armour but it wouldn't let me enter the suit (level 50 armour) - is this because I was too low of a rank?
---
Edit - And for all my efforts at getting to final 9 I received 4 caps - So rewards are really only there if you kill and fight, if you try to just use stealth etc. you're rewards are pretty meh.
---
new player here but since 1-2 weeks before the free trial anyways is there a way to get the backpack other than doing the challenges? I can't really do them , those missions are impossible
---
They should just eliminate the power armor animation entirely in NW.
---
For easy wood go to the lumber mill near vault 76 (free FT), you can easily get 200+ within 10 mins
---
Not me. But maybe they don’t approve of the team choices and they prefer a safe area away from enemies. 
---
And they could still have auto fill on because this means less players wanting to kill them :))
---
you can send them a message and tell you just want to play alone for a while, I've done it many times and my friends get it. usually better to send it when they just started inviting you, before they join your world.
---
Yeah I absolutely hate it but got many of them even from the safes I picked.
---
seriously bloody gatling build. fog crawlers go down like a sorority girl at a frat party
---
Im trying to hit 100 before the end of the week, at 30 rn so not too bad but im starting to get a bit bored of the mode. If i get it ill let you know
---
Damn I woulda spent 7 bucks extra for the stuff.  Got it for 10 bucks yesterday on Gamefly.
---
You can role play that in adventure mode, you don’t need to be a bloodied build to have fun, I know because I’m not and I only use part of the magic cards (not one specialization card).
---
Wouldn’t you think I would delete the post since obviously I’m not getting any karma so stop hating on me for just posting on the subject
---
Nobody is getting 100 that fast.
---
Get a grip lol. Wah wah duped gunz wah evil scum duper cheater blah blah. 
---
Bet you called him a homophobic slur that begins with F didn't you? Haha.
---
Claim a workshop and accept the PvP that's gonna come with it. Why does this always have to be explained on these outrage posts?
---
Sadly there is no real reason for a PA build. I do it for the carry weight and I just like it.
---
You're forgot there's 4 options on terminals, You are only 3 shown at a time. You missed nuclear code.
---
And I believe multiple chems, bobbleheads, magazines don't stack. The last one will be the only one applied.
---
The Silver Shroud?
---
Despite the level? I know not a lot of level 25s have that kind of caps.
---
Yeah. I just picked up a level 35 quad lever from a player vendor cheap that I can’t wait to level up to.
---
kein problem
---
Something very odd going on here, last night a buddy and I played for about 3 hours, setting it to not fill it was only queuing us with other teams of 2, every firefight we ran into was teams of 2, even we even ran into multiple 2v2v2v2 fights.
---
I definitely agree a solo mode is needed, but I wonder if something is going on in the background for duos and squads that they could just transparently add solos as well?
---
Cherish these weeks to come! You get a chance to start new with a wave of other new players. And with more quality of life that most of us had during the beta.
---
If i can get to 40 by the end of today im roughly on target. I think im probably only gonna manage about 80, though i know there are pvp gods that are ahead of me by quite a lot, when i was at 19 i met a 31
---
The few times I've played in the game mode, if my team are picking a spawn point too close to well known areas I will spawn away from them. If I die, I die. If we make it through the first few kills, I will endeavor to make my way to them so we can team up for end game.
---
Well you have to live in a bubble to think that the media coverage is mostly positive.
---
It can be useful for melee builds, as you will be attacked/mauled more often
---
This is an idea to fix it.
---
Butbitbtakes more and more co to lvl up
---
Yeah you should
---
Many people are just baiting for caps, hoping one of those days their roll of toilet paper can fetch them 25k caps. It’s really dumb and lame.
---
I have 15 str, 9 int and 8 agi... feels bad man. But on the other hand, im running Adrenalin which is Overall a better option than 300% higher jumps.
---
&gt;  I had a workshop taken from me and I tried to fight back and was one hit killed by what sounded like an LMG. I told him to go play Nuclear Winter where he belongs and he got me banned. Yes yes my language was a bit wrong 
---
you sure?
---
Even if someone deserves it? Wouldn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings in 2019 though. Where is is our world going to? Critique used to build character. What the hell has happened to the world?
---
They spent developer time and money to put a Royale in but can't fix the damn game 😂. These people are next level stupid. I can't believe this game even has a community with how piss poor it's gameplay is. Battle royal with that clunky shooting system? No thanks. Lol 😭😂😂😂😂
---
I try not to spawn right on top of my teammates to increase the chances of everyone finding gear quickly. That being said I still try to spawn nearby.
---
It's a game bro. Any momentary frustration would subside with the realisation that it isn't real life. 
---
Grow up.
---
Asking the real questions here..
---
You have to give the system time to register. Had the same problem yesterday and I got out of the build menu, waiting 5 min and went back in to place my new item.
---
U are getting way too much hate for one post that just expressing ur dissatisfaction with graphics
---
Yeah no none of that
---
They're not hackers; they're Bethesda employees using special builds and characters.
---
It doesnt seem that significant rn but yeah depending on the ramping it might be basically impossible. I can level in about 2 wins or so rn so its not awful. I completely forgot to take that into account though so yeah youre probably right. I wouldnt be surprised if someone did it though.
---
Every person with better equipment than me is a duper. Any person with equipment worse than mine is a noob. I think that's how it works...
---
Okay if you say so ❤️
---
When I was leveling up my rifleman last week I was using a level 15 handmade to take out level 50 ghouls with no problem. Lever action has even higher damage per hit.
---
Safety in numbers? Sure! But this but Bush is only big enough for me and I'm not gonna turn Team Fill off cause that's 3 more people I have to hide from
---
Maybe you would try to get karma, but I don’t care about karma
---
Was about to post about 3/4 of these! Hopefully they fix whatever is broken, whether that's the mechanics or just the damage number display.
---
I wonder how the special checks are going to work?  Especially since you can get crazy high stats wearing unyielding armor.  It may just possibly use your base special stats?  Should be interesting!
---
Development costs got larger... well yes, but actually no. 
---
Developing games today costs more but A LOT more copies are sold as well to an ever growing audience. Morrowind came out 17 years ago and almost 100,000 copies were sold in two months. Skyrim was sold 7 million times in one WEEK. You can't just justify todays release standards with inflation because trust me, they earn a shit ton more than they did back then while still selling them for 60 bucks.
---
By "haters" do you mean upset consumers who didnt get what they were promised so voiced there opinions in the only places they were listened to and had there opinions respected...
---
This is my point, until I got told on and band...
---
Why would NPCs make them get rid of eating and drinking? Lol. It's a survival game.
---
Thanks for posting this, I've been trying to give so many gifts to the new players and they just run away.
---
Yet here you are crying about your hurt feelings...
---
Well I personally see it as part of the trade off of wearing power-armour, but that might just be me.
---
I know what you mean. They’ll be overwhelmed with level 100’s cleaning out their inventory and dropping tons of aid and junk.
---
Happens to me 75% of the time, I have the free version friend does not.
---
I can help whenever.  I will be playing weekday nights and weekends whenever. PSN tag is same as here.
---
Not crying pretty happy actually
---
I don't think you know what whitewashing means
---
I hear ya. I am the absolute worst at gunplay. The only way I climb the leaderboard is if my teammates bail me out or I hide in cowardice after I've caused my teammates to be slaughtered. You are not alone!
---
I had a “snooze bar” dream this morning about playing NR.  I couldn’t even kill people in my dreams.  19 is pretty impressive congrats!
---
Yeah I looked into it after posting my comment. I was able to change the delivery address thankfully.
---
I don't see how that's an insult though. It's cartoony and silly, the game is very much trying to be childish
---
Tbh it made me laugh reading your sarcastic comment. Just give yourself sometime to cool down and have a snickers or something :)
---
But seriously the game is designed to let people fight over workshops. If you don’t agree with that, I suggest upon losing a workshop to someone higher level, just hop to another server and claim it there. It’s a video game and no need to take things that serious.
---
interested, but 20% is not enough, I will wait at least 40%
---
I like the way survival is working at the moment. I prefer it to NW because I’m more of a solo stalker when it comes to pvp in this game. I also like the balance changes they made with the armor nerfs and death penalties 
---
I don’t think they’ll abandon survival.
---
I'm not saying I'd feel any better than you did. I'm just trying to help prevent you from getting in trouble on here, too. It's up to you if you want to risk leaving their name in your original post. I'm only watching out for you! :)
---
Blade of Bastet is good.  I got mine about L47, and still use it (L100 now).
---
It's probably your best/highest damage weapon at the moment, and has AA as a bonus.
---
I think you can recraft it at 40 and 45.
---
Anyway, I would consider putting on PA and doing at least the row of cottages @  WS with Bastet in hand. 
---
There should be at least one legendary in that area, and you should not get more than 5 critters on you at once.
---
If you do the clubhouse, odds are, you'll get more than 5 on you at once - there are times when the entire population of the clubhouse meets you at the door.
---
Evaluate whatever legendary you get - don't like it, goto the train station and trade it for scrip.
---
repeat.
---
Alternately, check player vendor machines.  
---
Some sell low level legendaries at reasonable prices (for example, I sold a vampire lever action for 250caps), and I bought The Gutter (Assaulton blade with electric damage and health regen, 177dmg) for something like 300 caps.
---
I've been using automatic weapons a lot more often, but I'm still low level in NW. I log on, farm caps for the day, maybe buy some pa plans, go for the queen or farm foliage if a nuke is dropped... and go a few rounds on NW.
---
$60 early access. Ouch.
---
Yup, on top of the Salon. It's usually lvl 15.
---
The Scourge didn't make sense considering the vastness of space, but I found the concept of the enemy aliens and religion of "exaltation" fascinating.
---
SYNTH!
---
True but I still enjoy my setup.
---
Having to buy different modes? What is this EA??? Hell no. Thats why is a free weekend. If you like it buy and continue if not then don't buy it,  is called marketing. Also i don't understand why have a general based level for NW , it should be hard decisions to pick what perk cards to go with or respec character. It wouldnt be a fallout survival game if you didn't have to make tough decisions.
---
Similar to the rubber mat anchor method, but thanks for the tip! :-)
---
If I tamed one of these guys would it attack my brahmin that's apart of my brahmin pin?
---
They've patched that up so we can't do that anymore :(
---
unpopular opinion: pay attention.
---
I could try and help. Same name as on here and I’ll be on in a few minutes.
---
Same boat here played for about a month after it came out then dropped off due to bugs and whatnot. Right now I'm focused on grinding levels and building my camp collecting ammo food and water meds and every bit and piece of scrap I can find for crafting.
---
This is the only reasonable comment I’ve gotten. I guess I just disagree with that and I try to help the lower levels instead of hurt them. Idk that’s just me.
---
Lol. I did misspell that. But now that I’m thinking about it, his coat does look kinda oily.
---
Maybe it's just the particularly bad rigs then? My matches start off with 10-15 seconds of loading and 20-25 seconds of "WAITING FOR OTHER PLAYERS" before I can finally do anything
---
Honestly, I fell off the hype train hard when the game first released but then I recently picked it back up. It’s now become one of my favorites to play, so thank you for not giving up on the game!
---
Todd must love your butthole op 😉
---
I started two days ago.  I was doing a higher level quest and there was zero chance I would be able to beat it.  All of a sudden I run into 2 other dudes who apparently were struggling to do the same quest.  Between the 3 of us we did it and I got a nice legendary drop I can't use yet.  Normally in old Fallout games I would have just said damn and moved onto the next quest.  It was really cool having others to work with.  Just need to find some people to play with regularly because such few people use a mic on PS4.
---
I found my best way to score, is hide in bushes.  I tried killing other players and got 1 kill so far.  Only because they were distracted looting my dead teammates.
---
Your post sure seems like crying about it. Even naming the guy that hurt your precious feelings.
---
Your a dum dum
---
All spot on points. Another one to mention is people who ignore downed teammates when the coast is clear. Literally just had a guy staring at his pipboy while I died &gt;:(
---
How many stars? if it's only one at that level i don't think it's worth anything. Either scrip it or give it away to some one who could use it.
---
Before you Reddit me a new arsehole, this is a joke ❤️ I'm all for any sort of small improvements.
---
Same issues here as well. Haven't been able to get it to work since Monday's patch.
---
Oh word. thanks
---
Cause it’s a way to gain karma and he thought it would work
---
Nice
---
Yes! That will give the griefers a new option, teaming on solos, just the kind of unfair fight they are looking for.
---
Because they want to make money?
---
So when are the people when were promised to be unbanned in future updates are going to be unbanned? Ive sent in about 3 support tickets over the span of 3-4 months and have never been responded to or contacted in some way or form.
---
This isn’t fortnite lol they’re not making the br free and that’s a good thing
---
There's a tadpole challenge for launching a nuke?
---
Somewhere there just has to be a sticky.  
---
If you listen to the robots inside the vault and collect all the items they have out for you it should answer several of your “how does it work” questions and give you enough supplies to get to the Overseers camp. Her camp has supplies and workbenches so you can refuel, craft weapons and armor and listen to her holotape for more info.  She also has a Stash box you can store gear in so if you get killed you don’t lose it. You can find Stash boxes all over the map, usually inside the Red Rockets or you can toss one down in your own Camp.
---
Head down to Flatwoods and run the Responders quests in the area.  That will finish up the basic tutorial and show you how to treat your food and water, reduce and treat your rads and also give you some gear and recipes.  There is a Vendor in Flatwoods where you can buy and sell items and a recurring event that is great for items and gear at lower levels.
---
There isn’t a single player mode. Sometimes there are players everywhere while other times you might be the only person on your instance. You don’t have to interact, you can always just wave at them and continue on your way.
---
No, when my cousin switched to console from PC he had to start over.
---
You sound like a petulant child. I never had an issue in the beginning.
---
Same for me. Just told some sceptical friends that they should try it out, as it is now a much more stable game.
---
Luckily, its only me who keeps crashing that way and they have fun and all, but the irony is killing me...
---
I don’t care
---
I've considered moving my camp out of the bog, set up shop in the Forest for the week, and getting rid of plans and ammo high levels don't want for a cap or two. Churning out cheap healing salves and disease cures probably as well.
---
Bethesda doesn't launch games in a good state no matter who was working on it.
---
Dum dum care.
---
I would rather here footsteps then music
---
Wait, what?
---
the problem with the economy right now is the demand is high for BE, AAE, TSE, B25. Lasers, handmades , harpoon gun, 50cal, plasmas , etc. Any other legendary is not viable that's why no one wants them.
---
first thing i get when i search for the name and this is it.  outstanding :)
---
That makes no sense as it would be the same while running around the world. I can be connected for 8 hours solid with no problems. As soon as I grab a workshop, boom I'm out in a couple minutes
---
It's only 1 star. I was thinking about giving it to my friend that's finally getting back on after pre-ordering the game, then stopped playing because of the bugs (and possibly the hate).
---
Still new here, how do I turn on pacifist?
---
Ad Victoriam !
---
What can I say except "You're welcome".
---
No there isn't... I just checked misc and floor decor. Neither have a player spawn mat.
---
EX MACHINA
---
Dude it's making me like so happy. Unreasonably so, just because the hate didn't have anything to do with me. I really have been a fan of Fallout 76 since launch, and I never had any enormous bug or connection issues. And it's making me really happy to see things turn around for a game I've had so much fun with.
---
I got one yesterday but was only a 1*
---
I saw a jarred scorch head for 6k xD
---
i hate battle royales, but am having a blast.  give it a try!
---
Cheap. There's a word I was wondering about, lol. Nice find, though :)
---
Honestly I don't see this game being remembered as anything special. Even when the absolute wreck of a launch and the miserable state of the game early on is dealt with, it's still an experience that not many people are interested in.
---
I think it works as is TBH
---
If your going to post unhelpful sarcastic comments then you can leave.
---
 I'm not saying I'd feel any better than you did. I'm just trying to help prevent you from getting in trouble on here, too. It's up to you if you want to risk leaving their name in your original post. I'm only watching out for you! :)
---
I have three ranks of butchers bounty, good with salt, and thru hiker to make my caps- I cook and sell meat - you also get a big boost to xp from cooking as well.
---
I'm sorry but I think that is an absolutely pathetic tactic. You must be one of those guys without armor in the final battle. Gah
---
If you don't engage in combat, you'll never get better at it dude. Stop being scared and practice how to fight lol
---
Happened to me too a couple weeks back. No idea about the duping "method", but yes it does happen to people on accident, and it will not let you correct your mistake. Lost a 3 * Furious Faster Fire Rate Gatling Gun this way. Exactly as OP said. Other items could come and go, but machine refused to give back the item accidentally scripped.
---
we get caps?!?!?!  oh happy day!
---
Didn’t hurt me... just hurt what I believe in in this game. Hear me out... i have a level 120 character but I was playing my secondary level 30. I just think that the higher levels should help those lower levels. I try to help the lower level all I can. Most of the higher lever that are not in NW are preying on lower levels just to do it. I think that’s wrong. We as higher levels in adventure should be helping lower level. You wanna kill someone... go to battle royal!
---
Why would they forget about it? Nuclear winter is leaving after this week for months
---
We killed each other a few times. He would pick my lock to get bounty. I'd kill him. That was fair and as it should. There were multiple fatalities. In many of them I'd be not engaged in pvp. He would hit me until it procced then I'd die. Which isn't how it should be.
---
Just delete them off Xbox live. I had the same thing where this one guy just kept on appearing, or always sending me messages. Piss off mate, I only accepted your team invite once when I was slashed, and I'm not your friend. Stop sending me 'pity me' messages about having no friends IRL, as I don't care.
---
Pvp is def not the same in NW and survival. In NW you don't have all this legacy weapons running around instant killing people. If they ever fix op legacy weapons on survival and unbalanced pvp then sure if not then NW it is.
---
I already completed F76, i'm waiting for a big expansion. But the game not really "improved significatly", just slighty better, if you keep apart the server stability which was tremendous first months. What remains ? They just added some few brief missions, one new enemy, no new map parts..and the endgame is still boring! They are slow as hell to build proper contents!
---
All is forgiven my son. Say 10 hail Howard's and all will be well.
---
Don't get me talking about power armour now 😑
---
Same on Xbox since update.
---
What platform do you play on ?
---
Fortnite has you buy different modes as well, as do a lot of other games, but whatever. I just wanted to present an idea that would reward Bethesda with some more money to dump back into F76.
---
Its not about picking one character. I play 3. Why should I be punished for wanting to enjoy the game my way?
---
BR perks have no impact on Adventure mode, and I have good ranged cards on my melee guy, and good melee cards on my ranged guy. Would just be nice to have it consolidated instead of having everyone be different overseer levels with different cards. 
---
I am overseer 5 on one guy, 9 on another, and 3 on a third. Would be nice if I just had overseer level 10 or something on all my characters, with the same deck of perk cards on all of them.
---
If I want to play a melee guy, I can load up my melee character. If I want to do ranged, I load in on my sniper.
---
I mean realistically, it would be better if we just got a way to respec our characters without having to level, but I doubt that is easier to implement than an account based overseer level.
---
Huge hassle to remember who your main for BR is since I enjoy playing all 3 characters in Adventure.
---
&gt; got called a duper, since that seems to be the "ur mum gay" of this game
---
fuck why cant i stop laughing
---
Thank you but what is done is done, already posted...
---
Best thing to do with it in my opinion. Keep it in your friend circle so if you decide to level up an alt it will still be about for you to use.
---
You didnt get banned for saying "what the hell." So I guess we can add being a liar to your resume.
---
I admit I was one of the people who thought the game was bad based on the media, but after getting to try it this week I can say that I genuinely enjoy the game and am curious how it will progress.
---
the pa HUD has been the same for a while, I second the thrade off theory
---
No. It's already a free DLC. People can buy the base game.
---
Hail Howard
---
Oh ok I though you were talking about the camp section in the atom shop
---
Survival has been ruined by dupers. NW is what survival should have been. Take out the ring of fire and you have survival. Actually maybe they can make it the hardcore version of NW, remove annoying red dot above people’s head, enable friendly fire, and make bullets more deadly.
---
Sometimes want to survive beyond the first few minutes. So if some lvl 1 chucklehead wants to spawn inside Sutton, I'll pick a safe spot with spawns outside and then work my way to them. 
---
Or not, as most likely they dies in the first 30 sec
---
Lorewise the real Nuclear "Long Winter" with huge amounts of Snow and that stuff is going to happen in some decades, maybe this is coming as a story stuff later on. Don't really know why they called this Battle Royale Mode Nuclear Winter and not just ''The Storm''(like the weird computer voice says it over and over again)
---
Go play fortnite if you like to pay for different modes. Bethesda already making a lot of money out of atomic shop. Just make 1 character for NW and play the rest as you like.
---
Yeah but carrying 200+ lbs of gear on you at all times would burn that off pretty well ;)
---
I was wondering where the post with flying cheater was... Now I know.
---
I know absolutely nothing about Fortnite. But honestly there are a ton of posts on this sub that are showing you can but the game for 17 bucks!  I have about 400 hours in the game already and I paid 40 for it.  I have gotten my money worth for sure.
---
Because games company have only 1 priority. make money to make more games. It's a good priority don't get me wrong but Survival has had low numbers for quite a while. 
---
Sometimes there only seems to be 3 or 4 servers online. As jumping servers keeps putting you back in the same ones over and over. 
---
If they perceive that it won't make them money then they could abandon it (so to speak) 
---
wouldn't be the first time a games company dropped a project mid way through
---
Now go forth and expierence the glory of bountiful appalachia. May all your legendaries be god rolls and none be rolling pins.
---
Ok, sure.
---
I mean I love all the new players we got, but whatever.
---
When this trial is over and they leave, the pool for NW will be quite a bit smaller. I did not want this to happen.
---
u/AbugandUncleE
---
It's not called Nuclear Winter due to the season. Nuclear Winter is a hypothesized global cooling effect after firestorms following a nuclear war. Pretty wild shit.
---
Amen
---
Best way I've found to combat this happening is to add atom shop paints to as many items as I can, that I don't want to risk losing. This removes them from all trade menus. Favoriting and renaming help, but obviously in our cases didn't save us, lol. Mrgl or whatever the F her name is owes me  a GD 3 * Gatling Gun! Make it a furious explosive, and I'll forget all of this ever happened.
---
in first person mode i can understand why it looks the way it does, but in 3rd person mode it should operate the same way it does without PA
---
I'm really happy to see how far the game has come since the beta, and super excited about what's yet to come! Loving Nuclear Winter so far, and the way you get XP to carry over to adventure mode is great, too. I've never liked an online game until FO76, and while it took me some time to come out of my shell, I actually enjoy playing on teams now. I've met some of the nicest people in Appalachia, and I think the lack of human NPCs has actually helped to strengthen those bonds across the community. Well done.
---
It's pretty simple, discussion and potentially clips of examples belong here. Identifying information with evidence of cheating belong in a support ticket to bethesda. There is no overlap between the two
---
If they enjoy the trial they will buy the game, it’s 50% off after the trial ends so the odds of them buying it I’d say is very high If the enjoy it
---
I’m not sure where you are. If you started in the vault, you can follow the vault boy signs pointing you towards the door and stop at the stations along the way to pick up gear.
---
Your right I didn’t get banned for that. I got banned because we had a back and forth and I won and he turned to Xbox for the win, and then he sent me 3 messages of hahaha you got banned
---
Ok from this thank you, and everyones comments about the games improvements. I’m in. I’m getting the game and stepping out from F4. See you in the wasteland fellow vault dwellers.
---
I managed to cause this glitch by grabbing the holo before I had the quest on my way by.
---
It's pink with sprinkles if I'm thinking of the right one. Originally from the FO4 Creation Club mod if you want to look it up.
---
If you're afraid of that then don't play solos.
---
It's pugs, your almost always going to get one. Either that or people that hoard an arsenal while their teammates carry sticks.
---
But why when I already have 3 high level characters in Adventure mode? Why can't I play them all? What do you gain by taking that option away from me?
---
Found a guy selling the space suit (which is free if you just walk to the crashed ship) for 1.5k
---
Do the areas change? I've only ever gotten flatwoods so far, im still low level.
---
It's a good gun for sure but once you level up you are likely to find something better for sure.  I have a level 45 quad I use quite a bit and it's solid.  The lever damage is quite good and the fact you can shoot 20 times without reloading is nice.
---
It's always a male voice too lol.
---
Awesome. Just finallising a few things then we would be grateful if you can help us. Thank you very much in advance. Just let us know when you are ready.
---
On xbox here so can't physically help, but I do have some tips.  As far as the crossbow goes, you can pick up the plans to craft one relatively cheap from the Free States vendor.  If you don't want to drop the caps, the plans also spawn on a table at the Pioneer Scout archery range (as long as someone hasn't grabbed them already).  And remember...the challenge isn't "break and repair the crossbow".  It's just "repair".  So you only have to use it until the condition has deteriorated just a little and then repair it back to 100% (make sure you don't have weapons artisan equipped).
---
The camera is a little more tricky since you have to find that dead tourist.  In addition to the locations already mentioned in the comments, the tourist also spawns at the Mothman statue in Point Pleasant and the Giant Teapot in Charleston.
---
For the revving someone in water, join the Encryptid event if you see it launch.  There's a pool of water that people go down in all the time.  By doing that event, I was actually able to check that one off the list fairly quickly.
---
If you play on ps4 I’d pay you for it, I’ve been looking for a good lever action, or any at all
---
The area doesn't change, but it seems the circle closes in a little differently each time
---
No problem at my camp now so invite me when you’re ready.
---
Hackers on everygame , there is people out there who sits on their computer and wait for new games to come out to data mine it and design hacks and sell them for money. Is a job for them. Any other BR or online game has issues. It just depends on the company if they want to fix it quick or let it ride and die out.
---
Sorry but I’ve had no issues whatsoever, and that’s with 2-3 systems in the house playing. 
---
Cite your data source.
---
if i keep spamming ?Q" i will get one of you 
---
eventually.
---
Oh wait.
---
I also suck hard at pvp, good against Game Ais. LOL
---
I just got my tracking as welll finally
---
Yeah pretty sure it's intended by them. So push for removing it.
---
Some of the buildings I think are closed purposely. When they dropped new DLC some of those places were changed and reopened.  I think it gives the devs existing places to use for quests later down the line.
---
Yeahhh, so close :' \^ (
---
Thanks for the idea, I'm giving this a try tonight xD
---
lol same, my first game i had no idea wtf was going on. could her the rest of my team chatting and was like "oh, i guess world chat is on".  I didn't even know we HAD teams.  so im running around and these guys are near me so i start shooting them.  and hes like "why are you shooting me??? we're team mates???".   I didnt' have my mic set up, and felt pretty silly, so just did a confused emote, and a heart emote, and they were all like "it's all good, let's go kill people" so then we found some guys, and i died right away.   was good times.
---
It’s funding my frequent fast travelling.
---
Happy to hear you like it. It only gets better with every update :) unless they make bobby pins weigh a ton again. Then we riot.
---
Really? That's a bit of a waste, but I assume once beta is finished new areas will be added to nuclear winter.
---
Had one random add on our squad that actually won it all as the last man standing, but was selfish and just used the rest of our team to bait his cause. Hid in the bushes at a distance and was an all around coward.  Milked the clock and only shot at other peeps when it was killshot stealing time, while the rest of our team fought hard to make us the last team.  Would not stimpak anyone either, even when it made sense to. Only made goofy evil laughing noises on chat, but would not say actual words or communicate.  Bizarre AF, but its a strategy that worked out for him I guess. I won’t divulge the name, but that dude can suck it!
---
There is hope... The devs fixed a bug with the compass in PA that had carried over from FO4 release.
---
I agree that the PA HUD is pain. Hopefully they will give it a face-lift because on PC we have option but on console... not so much.
---
This may or may not be how I've gotten my only win so far...
---
O just get rid of duplicates
---
Sounds like you took the L, with or without Xbox.
---
That seems to be the consensus
---
Have you seen the human npc ad? It looks well done :)
---
This is just bs
---
And they say there are no NPC's in 76 because it looks like there are a lot
---
The game came out without survival or NW. no one knew how it was going to be. What about players that are brand new and just make a random character to play NW?. You have to adapt to the change trust me bethesda won't change it into a general level.
---
I'm not sure if you know but you can always edit or delete any of your posts. You may want to edit the original one in this thread to remove their gamertag. That's what I meant when I wrote that it's up to you if you want to risk it.
---
I honestly don't mean this to sound bad or as if I'm putting anyone down, I'm really not so please don't misunderstand this as I really don't know.
---
Do people actually sit and watch other people playing these games? I keep hearing about streamers and people mention names but...these are just people playing games right? And other people sit and watch them? Why? Wouldn't you have more entertainment actually spending that time playing the game yourself? 
---
Semi-old fart just wondering what the point of the streaming is.
---
I find tickling is better than a 38, at least you get a laugh.
---
Now it is targeting but is crashes my xbox total rest. Seems to have at tree house with the sting wings
---
Sure does

I just did Irrational Fear and that’s the first time I’ve ever seen it... in 709 hours.

I just found it over the weekend.  Excavator, melee weapon, a bunch of dead crickets, and 30 minutes later, walked out with almost 400 lead.  And a lot of other useful things....
---

---
You dont know that he duped it.
---
You need the key card in the dead responders hand. She is in the basement in a storage closet. Use that key to unlock the stairs going up
---
I can confirm op argument.
---
Played with 3 friends yesterday which one of them was lagging like hell.
---
He told us that it was pretty unplayable since sometime is AP bar wouldn't decrease and other times it would stay at 0.
---
Vut spectating him was hilarious. He kept teleporting (when he wasn't standing still) and he made a bunch of kill just shooting at the grass!
---
This is mostly luck for people who lags like him. They can see you immobile when you're running, therefore that might be easy for them. But you could also see him immobile while he isn't...
---
What is upsetting is when those lags, even when they are minor, cause your opponent to be able to shoot you through a wall, cause he still sees at the doorframe
---
Maybe.
---
I am going off my own experience here.
---
I brought my boyfriends guild to Fallout 76. That is over 100 players.
---
We asked in Discord how many would be buying it, and only 14 said they will, with only 3 that already bought it.
---
I tried to convince more to buy the game, but was pretty much jumped on because not everyone has time/money right now. 
---
I know $17 isn't a lot for most of us, but for some people that is a bit out of reach for a single game.
---
A lot of the people said something along the lines of "Why buy Fallout 76 for just one mode that I enjoy if I can buy 7+ games for that price on Humble Bundle". And I honestly have no reasonable response to that statement.
---
But if that mode was free, Bethesda could eventually entice people into the purchase.
---
One week is just not enough time for a lot of people. We have over 30 players that won't get to try the game because they are busy with RL ATM.
---
Just throwing out ideas here, but apparently not very popular ones.
---
Also PSA for new players: there's one emote and two CAMP objects for free in the Atom shop.
---
Oh, right i forgot to mention the compass. Practically useless due to the HUD.
---
They have slowly increased camp budget as time has gone on.  They also reduced budget on certain things like turrets and lights.  Camp and stash budget increase is one of the most requested upgrades I see on the subreddit.
---
I think the main problem is that when you have all those players on the world it gets hard for the servers to handle all the inventory.  
---
I would guess as the game goes on they will continue to add budget to camp.  They are supposed to be adding junk decoration soon as  it was pushed back in April (?).
---
Sometimes you watch for the personality, sometimes you watch for how skilled they are, sometimes you put it on for background noise, lots of different reasons it’s not always just to watch them play a game
---
Just got my email as well.
---
Sounds like my irl dog. 5 years old and she still destroys our house
---
Sometimes, it's just a joke though.  I have the single action revolver ivory grip plan selling for an ungodly amount of caps in my machine because it used to drop *everywhere*.  I don't really expect anyone to buy it.
---
Noisy. Hey we're over &gt; HERE &lt; please shoot me.
---
Is Dead Silence even a perk ?
---
tbh I don't have Frog Legs nor would I have enough special points to equip it, but I just use my camp to get on top of buildings. Works every time haha
---
I see you too are ignoring the mole minor locker key quest.
---
Yes. I know how the game came out. I am a Tricentennial Pre-Order owner. Although I left shortly after due to all the ridiculous bugs and the fact that Anthem was coming out. Yes, that was a colossal mistake lol :-)
---
Anthem is a burning pile of garbage while Fallout 76 was fixed up quite nicely.
---
I hope they change it, but I won't be too upset if they don't. I will just continue playing both my characters. I can leave my crafter on the bench so to speak.
---
Its only in workshops, not in camps.
---
That makes sense ☺️
---
Yeah I'm pretty new to this game and most seems helpful and all. Except for that one guy who went up to me and started hitting me with his melee weapon.
---
Apart from that no one has really bothered me. I did get some stimpaks when I started out by someone who was lvl 100 something so I now got 40 stimpaks at lvl 7.
---

---
The longer it's kept out in front, the quicker this will get fixed.
---
Posted a link for reference for you, on the caps stash locations.
---
That ban specifically happened literally like 4months ago. You are never getting unbanned, no one has.
---
Nooooooooo!
---
Kill um all and let atom sort them out
---
Well whats the fuckin point of that? lol
---
Ahh yup you're right. My bad.
---
Big sad I guess. The new content coming up looked fun.
---
How do I know what stick to get to add to it?
---
Can I buy one stick of 8gb to add?
---
Do I need to buy 2 new sticks? 
---
I’ve never built anything or replaced anything, so I would be completely new to that.
---
They're not really being cynical. A 60 dollar game that had a couple days worth of content is awful. And now they're coming out with DLC that probably costs 100 bucks total. They shouldve had that shit at the start.
---
We need a ghoul npc who talks like that selling fishing gear and takign our fish to make mounted trophies. make it happen BGS!.
---
I know! That's why I had to come up with something else.
---
I totally get where your coming from but if they split up the modes into different prices that’s just yelling EA, maybe they eventually will make NW free but for now it’s just a side mode to the full game, when 76 came out it was just adventure mode and these modes are just little side games, I feel like if they made NW free it would turn into the next fortnite, little kids running around being toxic, but since it’s behind a paywall most wont get it.
---
Its amazing. Sorry man, they wont even accept appeals of any kind.
---
That's not really different than what we have now. Either you're up against squads or solos. At least with solo mode, theyd have to get lucky and end up in the same lobby, and deal with friendly fire being a potential issue instead of always ending up in the same game, without ff.
---
It was still pretty bad.  First few weeks were pretty dreadful with the number of crashes i would run into.  I had some quests i could not even complete cuz it kept crashing at the end of them and i would lose a bunch of loot.  The one being a quest where you go into the mines with all the scorched in the south part of the map and fairly early on in the game.  I forgot what it was called but it was stupid.
---
After getting to level 15, and taking maybe 15 hours of play time (this includes some hours in trying to build a nice base which was a whole 'nother buggy mess), i ended up quitting until things were resolved.  Which now the game is at least in a much better state.  But i would still say it needs a bit more before i would consider it a game that should have been at the initial release.  The improvements have been impressive for sure.
---
You can just switch back and forth depending on what type of ammo you have. The 45 receiver is much better damage wise though.
---
no tactic is pathetic your ability to adapt to them might be though. a win is a win.
---
Argh!

I guess cheap is one of those relative terms, huh? :)
---
Ahhh okay
---
There is I killed the scorchbeast and it dropped a power fist
---
I agree
---
But hearing a “I’ve got another settlement that needs your help” would quickly send me into a downward spiral I may never overcome...
---
The reason NW gives both is because it has aspects of both. Battle royale plus a bunch of adventure mode features, while adventure mode is just adventure mode I think this is why you don’t gat Nw do in adventure
---
It is all a part of the Vault experiment.
---
Is your new top tip: always keep the hazmat ?
---
ps LOL +tears ... "nuked themselves".
---
Dammit she said she wouldn't tell!
---
Yer this happened to me yesterday and I just couldn’t be bothered to go and price everything again. Glad I’m not the only 1 tho
---
do you happen to know wether it's working with the new update? I have the updated sfe but can't get textchat to work. is it me or does it need an update, too?
---
would be funny if it's tied to how much you are carrying and no one notices because everyone is always at the brink of being over encumbered
---
I'm pretty sure they're coming out with a respec system with wastelanders.
---
Do swimmer,archer,and athlete they are the easiest. Look to redit for help with completion. Make friends to help you. You only need 3 badges for the pack
---
Then you could just not turn the radio on?
---
I leave mine unlocked yes because I am being nice. What pisses me off is when people try to take it when everything is unlocked for the taking and all I am doing is the defense quests.
---
Nuclear winter perks are separate to adventure
---
You could try to do the assault course on the hill in the middle. That's often near the endzone and if you successfully jump across all the things you'll be safe in the tower until it's outside the safe zone. I tried but chickened out halfway and got lasered by a well-coordinated team from two directions at once.
---
When you move your camp without taking anything apart,all the walls and such go into the stored tab in the build menu. Which allows you to freely build your blueprinted items with no cost.
---
Man the comments on that article are IGN level toxic. 
---
I guess constant unrelenting negativity is whats cool these days.  Fallout 76 is a blast. My wife bought her won copy so she can play with me after watching me for hours. Now she cant get enough of exploring and building.
---
Oh well. $60 lesson learned.
---
Yeah, I have that tactic, but gosh there's such a lack of paints for popular stuff, and man, sorry to hear about your gattling gun! Sounds like much of a bigger loss than my Chameleon armour piece, I wish you luck with the RNG gods to get that back or get an even better one!
---
Like you're pouncing on them
---
&gt;  100,000 unique items in a 30 day period. Never duped .
---
To explain how one guy could find it in his menus and another could not.
---
.45 is much better, but low levels .38 is plentiful.  If you are having a hard time keeping ammo in stock build both.  Use the .38 when farming lower level areas to conserve .45.
---
Is anyone else not getting the level ups in adventure mode earned through NW mode? to choose perk cards?
---
Capturing the workshops is a easy way to get exp, caps, meds, ammo, and plans.  You don't even have to set up extractors.  Just capture them and do the defend events when they pop up.  
---
You can bulk all the junk in the game and sell it to the robot vendors.  It's an easy way to get caps.
---
If you start finding enemies that are high level and take tons of resources to kill.  Just go back to lower level areas and level up a bit.  The main quest takes you to some areas that can be very difficult early on.
---
You also might want to invest a few perks into a melee category early on.  Ammo can be difficult to find at times so having a decent melee with help you conserve more of it.  Fire axes are a solid choice early on.
---
Also make sure you level up your armor and weapons periodically.  A level 10 hunting rifle is going to do noticeably more damage than a level 1 hunting rifle.  
---
Good luck out there!
---
That was a typo. I meant to say having
---
Survival is one of the aspects of the game. Taking away drinking and eating might aswell just disable carry weight , ammo weight , damage reduction and call this minecraft.
---
YouTube's algorithm favors more extreme videos, so people make more extreme videos. Honest appraisals of FO76 at launch wouldn't be extreme enough to get picked up by the algorithm.
---
It had problems, nothing horrible, but it needed an actual beta period to quash them, not just a two-week head start. Biggest issue was server stability and performance, which was exacerbated by dupers loading themselves with so many items they'd bog down the servers and crash them. PvP also wasn't implemented well, favoring greifers way too much.
---
Well yea with free week and a whole bunch of noobs you can’t expect to get a camera picture of another player doing one hand handstand in a nuke zone in ass less chaps.
---
Just wait till June 18th lol
---
No Witchhunting. Do not ask users to go after other players in game. Do not accuse players of cheating, use Bethesda's official support here. Do not name in shame in general.

Oh gosh sorry!  Women and men are both capable of the best and worst things equally.  No offense meant at all.  It wasn’t intended to be, like, an illustration in absolution—just a funny portrait.  But yeah...sorry...I have never been very PC, and work around a lot of men and women who crack on each other all day.  Ironically, the women usually make fun of the women and the men usually make fun of the men.

Thank you for your thank you. And thank you too.
---
As a software dev i know the shit you went through. We all appreciate it. We have been harsh at times and i can imagine the mood in your offices at times.
---
But we, the community, enjoy the game, and we are in effect your embasidors and sales team. So a thank you is very welcome.
---
At the same time thank you for all your hard work. The community would not be doing what we are doing without it. And having fun at the same time.

The original Nick Valentine is long dead along with most of the population after the bombs dropped. The Nick Valentine you meet in Fallout 4 is simply an early model synth with Nick's consciousness and memories uploaded to it by The Institute. I don't think synth Nick was around during this period being he was dumped and  stumbled upon Diamond City not long after the Broken Mask incident.

How are you going to win if you have a pipe sniper and no armor? Sure you get some nice xp for surviving for a long time but the last enemy(s) WILL find you and WILL annihalate you
---
I played about 15 hours when the game first released and can say that it was a mess of a game. I just joined back a couple weeks ago.  I know some others did not run into all the bugs that many would get, and they are lucky.  But i had so many frustrating crashes with the game at release, some that actually prevented me from finishing quests.  And i also enjoy to build in FO4 but the building in this game was aggravating.  Tbh, it still has its moments of annoying bugs but luckily Beth has been hard at work.
---
The game's stability is night and day compared to its initial few weeks of release.  Plus, with some minor additions like seeing other player Camps and being able to sell your equipment has helped a lot in adding some life to the gameplay ive noticed.  Originally, it was mainly only events where i may see other players.  Now its more constant at actual Camps and thats nice.  I do wish Beth would reimplement the "bug" where Events gave rewards to everyone on the map.  Just balance it so it better rewards those whom actually participate.  I actually thought that was kinda neat to help others, even in a minor way, across the server.  It seemed a bit more rewarding.
---
All in all, i would say the game is a lot closer now to what it should have been at release.  Once the Human NPCs are out, i would say that is a good time for many to rereview the game.
---
Glad you enjoyed your first co-op experience, just a little heads up because you noticed the minor rewards: you will get plans for camp items for workshop defense events like this, maybe you missed that. 
---
And yes, you could buy most of them from vendors too, but every cap not spent helps at low levels :-)
---
Im sorry, I feel for you, but you gotta admit that's damn funny. Wish you had a vid of this. 😂
---
Like Hello Games, who screwed up No Mans Sky and turned it into a great game, I’m glad you all stuck with Fallout 76 the game is enjoyable and I’m very hyped for Wastelanders
---
I literally put signs up saying “Free” 🤷‍♀️
---
It's not broken because literally anyone can get it and while mid air it's hard to shoot and you cant dodge if someone start lighting you up. Plus it makes you stand out like crazy to any teams near by.
---
Isn't there a better respec system coming in wastelanders?
---
Do you have the palgue walker mutation? That one aggros Brahmin.
---
There's definitely power fists around
---
I just made an open 2x2 square in the middle of my bases foundation.
---
Inside garden with 1/20th the work.
---
Thats my main point of confusion. Not sure how they landed on that number, none of my characters had more than an armor set, weapons, and ammo on them at any given time. Didnt have anyone to play the game with, and it takes at least 2 to dupe
---
Hey that’s my favorite Radiohead song
---
'Fill team option' say what now ?!
---
I think this would help, so people can view the lore of vault 51 if they are not great at multiplayer. 
---
I’d love to read some of the terminals but I’m absolutely crap at PVP
---
This post doesn't have value. Lol.
---
Lol I've seen quite the opposite when my teammates enter power armour. Theres been a handful of times where I've died and have been specing my teammates, only to see them get greedy with pa they see at the end of a circle that's closing in and they were killed while entering it when they were outside the circle. 
---
Cant see why guns or the circle itself would make a big difference unless people are shooting the armor itself and not the actual player trying to hop to it. 
---
I've also been hurt and almost killed entering PA too so maybe it's a server side issue that just acts up?
---
Yep, and I agree with you there. I've dealt with plenty of kids in Fortnite. But there are also plenty of kids in CoD games, which carry a full price tag.
---
I like choices, and as I said - you can still buy the game to have all modes, or buy them piece by piece.
---
I would have a lot easier time telling my friends to buy the Adventure mode for $10 after they sunk in 200 hours into the BR mode. That's how I got 50+ people into StW lol.
---
Just tossing out ideas here. I see your point and partially agree.
---
No, definitely not. People buying the game are buying it for its current state.
---
Good job this is the internet and I don't care what you think. But you're right about the final battle, I don't use armor. I use camouflage. Who said I'm scared or bad at it? The objective is to win, there is no "right" and "wrong". But I suppose everything is a nail when all you have is a hammer. I'm going to keep playing the way I play cause that is what works for me. But thank you for your well thought out comment.
---
Not you, the other guy.
---
1.
---
2. Yes, open the wheel, press Assign (on pc is C) and select the object you want to assign
---
3. I think yes
---
4.
---
YES! That's my build - the Action movie system Analyst!! 😂😂😂😂
---
It's true and thx for the laughter
---
I found a sledgehammer yesterday
---
i think the adventure xp given scales with level.
---
started a brand new character for nw and even when i win i never get 2000xp.
---
From my limited experience in last few days: the optimization is pretty bad, you get randomly get disconnected from servers, enemies often freeze on spot and there is a buggy door in Vault-Tec University that instantly kills you and wasnt fixed for 6+ months. 
---
The lack of NPCs is pretty bad too, it makes the world seem lifeless.
---
It does to me. Fake plants are gross.
---
You on Xbox? I need to be carried to a win
---
So putting a foundation on top of that square would be 19/20ths harder?
---
&gt; Bethesda support says my account was flagged for review for ToS violations for aquiring more than 100,000 unique items in a 30 day period. Never duped, but did a massive amount of trading at launch.
---
There is NO WAY you acquired over 3K unique items each day for a month. You blatantly used an exploit or cheated, so you're getting what's deserved.
---
I feel like it should stay, but that's just personal preference.
---
Probably because of the free week, a lot of people probably only heard that it was really bad (and it was, to begin with) without playing it. Then when the free weekend came around they thought “eh, might as well.” And then once they played the game they were like “Oh, this is better than I expected.”
---
French accents FTW.
---
If you get a bounty just stash all your junk get naked gather as much wood and rubbish junk you can as you await a bounty Hunter to claim the 10 caps and a bunch of low level.junk as an F U.  I go to the lumber mill.and collect wood or any place with fertilizer.
---
The server stability and amount of bugs at launch (and still present) were and are pretty astounding. There used to be a user that would list out the mass amount of bugs for the game present each week, but I believe that person is just getting downvoted into oblivion because the community can't seem to understand what critiquing is.
---
How was this post witch-hunting? He didn’t mention anyone specific. You’re lousy at your job.
---
&gt; UNLESS every single Cap has it's own ID and is considered "unique".
---
It isn't. So there's no way OP legitimately got 3K unique items each day for an entire month. Obvious exploits are obvious.
---
I also was on a server which had lots of new ppl on and also some 300+ so i went to launch a nuke cause i remember how hyped i was when i first saw someone launching one. It really gives the fallout vibes
---
1.  There is indeed a learning curve.  No denying that.
---
2. Regardless of whether you collect or drink, the water is still irradiated, but when you collect it is listed as Dirty Water under Aid in your pip boy menu. You can then boil it at a cooking station to further remove rads, but eventually you'll start amassing Purified Water, either by finding them or building a water purifier in your camp.
---
3. I don't like BR so I have no input on this one.
---
4. It is rare to get a private server, but sometimes it happens. Unfortunately, no way to go back to it.
---
5. You will need to be higher level to launch a nuke and go through the Enclave questline to gain silo access.  But launching a nuke at another player's camp is a serious waste of time, effort, and resources.  If you go through all that trouble, you want some payoff for it.
---
6.  Just about everything causes radiation.  LOL  You can decrease your exposure to it by taking a Rad-X, but the effects eventually wear off.  Rad-X doesn't stack by the way, so taking 10 of them at once doesn't give you higher radiation resistance.  If you take too many rads, pop RadAway to chase some away.  There's also a decontamination shower in Poseidon power plant (and in higher level player's bases sometimes) that will get rid of rads. 
---
7) This one has already been answered pretty thoroughly
---
Even if your version looks better :)
---
I have the same problem.
---
The Long Johns also qualify as sleepwear, and they're under-armor so they won't affect your outfit.
---
I didnt pick it up during to the bad reviews and general "this game is broken" vibe but I'm glad took advantage of the free trial as it's right up my street! I'm enjoying it more than fallout 4 so far.
---
That would be awesome but sadly on PS4 :/
---
Nice Nick and tag btw :D
---
You guys wanna win this round, or are you only here fo my *soothing* voice?
---
Lmao. I am on xbox. I am not going to be on again until tomorrow at like 8am. PM me your GT and when my buddy gets on I'll message you and as long as you stick to our method we will get you a win for sure.
---
Agreeed, it’s an excellent way to level a character, and is a nice bonus for the high levels as well.
---
Cant dodge? just keep bunny hopping lol. In a town, you can hop on buildings for better coverage. I'm lvl26 and have not gotten it yet lol
---
They don't have their best people working on the game and it shows. Usually, Fallout games also have modders that can fix the issues they don't fix, thus negating a lot of the bugs and removing the tedious aspects. This time, modders were able to make managing the inventory just a tiny bit easier and that's it.   
---
So we've had to rely on Bethesda actually fixing the game and that came slowly and quite frankly, poorly.  Just play the current game for a while and you'll have issues popping up left and right. Then take a second to think they've been fixing issues every week and you're imagination will probably still not match the horrendous release they put out.   
---
Remember this is not the first time it ever happens. For example, one of the top MMORPGs, Final Fantasy 14 also disrespected their fans so much once that they had to cancel the entire first version of the game and they remade from scratch. So it's not a first. Difference this time is the inexperience is visible because they're keeping the game live while fixing it.
---
Or just an unlocked tab for everything u own from the shop would be nice
---
I'd classify myself as a Bethesda fanboy, the people praising them for this post are something else though.
---
Hmmm. Not sure my dude. Alot of variables, player kills, AI kills, time alive, revives, ect.
---
Noses should be on the top of the head of course.
---
Why do u want music?
---
Nuclear Winter gives you XP for both because it utilises the same skills as adventure mode - e.g. killing enemies, lockpicking, hacking terminals, etc. It makes sense that your character should get better at these from an RPG perspective playing this gamemode. But in adventure mode, your character is not improving the Nuclear Winter skills at all so no XP there.
---
They need something to chew on...
---
I said mid air. If you jump and some gets a bead on you its over.
---
It's the main reason I don't use power armor
---
Lol I’ve had so many 2nd place finish so I don’t think I’m complete trash just chasing my elusive first victory, 
---
never would I have thought I’d enjoy a BR mode this much as a change of pace from adventure
---
Hahaha. Fair enough.
---
Different one, that’s the “pink with sprinkles” paint.
---
What are these items? If you don't mind(:
---
Lvl 40 here getting 1500 do and 90caps per win
---
A) “Hold my beer” —Bethesda
---
B) All the time we’ve put into it?  Nobody’s putting in more than a week, right?
---
I get second place a good bit too but when me and my dude get together we clean house.
---
Food and water quickly becomes so trivial it doesn't even matter.  If that is enough to make you not want to play the rest of the game most hold little interest so go find something else.  I suggest you avoid any game that is the slightest survival in the future since 76 is very light on survival.
---
That definitely seems familiar. Lol
---
There is also one that spawns in one of the houses at the top of Tanagra Town. Its in the bathtub on a partial floor you need to jump to, also a dead settler and a bed up there. I was frequently finding a magazine on the head of the bed even if the Royal Jelly wasn't there.
---
They never once promised that. Idk why youre spreading bullshit.
---
If you stay on the ground youre most likely to get shot lol. Why do you think everyone jumps around in survival mode with their explosive legend weapons lol.
---
Not sure what happened in your case but for me after increased server drop outs and blue screens on my PS4 Pro since the last update today the game hard froze my PS4 so i had to actually pull the plug and restart my system. Pulling the plug  i guess corrupted the files as when i went to start FO76 it said the files were corrupted and i need to delete the game and reinstall......  
---
So now i'm waiting for the 66 GB update to finish and whilst checking its progress i've just noticed its blue screened **again** and now its telling me to do a PS4 update....which is 460mb so....doing that now..then i guess back to waiting...hope it works....cause i got a lot of time in this game now.   
---
So maybe check if you also have a system update...that's all i can suggest.
---
That's crazy. I get like 150+ caps too. Maybe I just complete more metaphorical checkboxes
---
True, but there’ll be people with 100 hours + easily invested in the game by then 🙃
---
I too am a burden, but I am not sorry.  I provide valuable services like soaking up enemy ammo, revealing their positions to my team mates, and carrying items they can use later.  I should get an additional reward now that I think about it.
---
I would love that.
---
Nw is so much better on a team with mics, than with 3 other rando's.
---
&gt;Idk, maybe it’s just the Xbox One
---
My experience on PC was very similar to what you described, except I also had lots of trouble with the "damage bug," where damage you deal to NPC enemies would be delayed and sometimes not even go through for no good reason at all. There were multiple times my only recourse in a given fight was to run or log out, because the enemies had developed inexplicable invincibility.
---
So I for one can confirm that the bugginess is not limited to Xbox. I don't have a weak PC either - my specs exceed recommended by a fair bit, and I can get 100+ FPS pretty consistently. 
---
My suspicion is that a lot of the worst bugs were (and some still are) on the server-side, not the client-side. Which makes sense given that Bethesda has much less experience developing servers than clients.
---
Happening for me as well. I'm on PC. Thanks for posting and saving me troubleshooting intermittent mouse clicks :)
---
Nope. It was annoying in Fallout 4 but at least in that game you could peg it down to RPG immersion. In a battle royale, the HUD should not be so obtrusive; ditch it.
---
I did find another Furious 3 * in a vending machine later that week for 5k. . . Sadly it wasn't faster fire rate, but eh. Whatya gonna do?
---
I am not saying it was not fun, but its stupid prasing unfinished games and paying full price for them but keep downvoting me everyone
---
Anyone have any imgur shots of the skins? Can't reach the Bethesda site at work.
---
Use vats, use chems, hop in some power armor, ask a higher level to help out.
---
A trillion times this
---
&gt; but did a massive amount of trading at launch 
---
 And then you never had more than the barebone basics? I'm really trying to not accusate. But something smells fishy about all this.
---
Leave the quest behind for a little bit and explore/do events to level up some more. 🙂
---
Inert Flux weighs .2 and gives 30% water
---
To avoid explosive damage and bloodied build which dont exist in this game mode. The point it that the perk has downsides and isnt broken. Your team got wiped, or happens. It's not because something is broken, you just got beat.
---
What level are you guys? And what weapons are using on it? You can always cripple the leg. Or come back to the cave with a bunch of explosives.
---
Just seems like such an odd thing to do. I can't imagine watching someone streaming something, I'd much rather throw on a movie or music for background, and regardless of how good they might be I'd prefer to play something myself.
---
Different mindset I guess.
---
Yongyea is already making it.
---
We are only level 14 and have very little still.
---
start a new character and play a few rounds.
---
Not strange. Game isn’t bad now, and expectations from many who are returning or playing free were low from the stigma this game is slowly shedding.
---
We are level 14, I've thrown many grenades at it and we are using whatever we have ammo on.
---
Select the purifier in build mode. Choose ‘store/scrap/replace’. Use ‘replace’ to change the skin back to standard, then try again.
---
Agreed. I kept mine in the wrapping, haha. Just looks nice.
---
At level 220, I find myself not wearing power armor almost at all unless in a nuke zone. 
---
The legendary effects on regular armor just outweighs the benefits of PA. Plus,  I can carry like 470lbs out of power armor and only 385 in.
---
I hate the HUD on power armour too.
---
My stick was shot, but ti had a blade on the end.  I think they called them hatchets in the old days.  Some guy with an automatic laser rifle took it from me.
---
We did that and thought that it was an event.
---
If it is one star sell for about 700 caps or scrip it. Quad is not the best (nor the worst) for LAR... but being 1 star is what limits its value to others... that being guys 20 to 30... by 30 you have probably picked up something else that is better... that said my L25 exploding LAR lasted me from L40 to about L90... so someone may get a lot of mileage out of your quad... but that was in the pre-scrip era where it is easier to get 2 and 3 star gear.
---
I just spend my time punching that infernal machine.
---
A free week eliminates all of the risk for the consumer, so now people  whose only exposure to the game was through YouTube and the easy karma jokes have a chance to play and form their own opinions.
---
If I remember correctly the emote was "Give a gift" and the two CAMP objects were a personal computer and a some kind of a bowl for beverages.
---
&gt; Now she cant get enough of exploring and building.
---
Which is literally all there is to do in adventure mode - the main mode of the game - and, until Fallout 4, building wasn't even part of the franchise; lots of Fallout fans couldn't give a damn about it. 
---
&gt; I guess constant unrelenting negativity is whats cool these days.
---
The game deserves its criticism. The battle royale mode is fun, but adventure mode is deeply, deeply flawed to put mildly.
---
It’s meant to be funny, why are you here
---
Not really  I recommend checking your competitors prices
---
Alright. Thanks for all the information.
---
I do mostly solo, and do the hide and seek, and can confirm its a great way to consistently get to the final circles, i usually hide as near to the fire as i can the whole time
---
Honestly, I think the reason it's in the forest is because I'm pretty sure Vault 51 is the un-numbered vault in the northwest of the map.
---
Found myself spawning on the outskirts of the camp vs by the vending stations like they said you would. I've been finding this better because rarely does anyone build that far out to the edges of their camp and you're almost always spawning in the clear on solid ground. Like another poster said, its an improvement which is always good.
---
Maybe a "Memorial Wall" mod would be a better tribute?  
---
When mods become available to console, something like this would probably be better fitting.  That way, it could memorialize ALL of the dedicated Fallout players that have moved on to the next life.
---
If somebody else doesn't already do it, I'll gladly do it when the time comes.
---
How soon did you load in and run to the workshop? Like did you click survival, as soon as you could checked the map and then moved to the workshop? 
---
To me it sounds like you checked the map while everything was still loading in. The workshop was on a "retake" and that's why there was a horde there.
---
It’s crazy hot it’s the complete opposite with these big youtubers they desperately want the game to fail and only post hate/controversial topics fallout 76 rep will always be negative and skewed cause the big gaming news youtubers (you know who they are) will not give the game another chance or just any credit or ounce of positivity
---
Some people don't know and others are too rich to care...
---
I don't really either, but I use a vampire buzz blade and cannibal perk.
---
But nobody would use it because hearing footsteps is pretty essential to battle royale games.
---
3. yes and no? you can earn xp for adventure/survival mode in nw but you have to go back into one of those mode to actually advance your level and spec your character. but beyond that you dont have to play it.
---
Will the reddit hive mind finally accept that people were banned falsely? Answers on the back of a post card!

Aww crap, this means I might have to do something about my level 4 CHR then, won't I?  No one wants to, ugh, get romantic with someone who has the personality of an irradiated rock.
---
Couldn’t agree more!

*It feels like this whole game isn't even worth playing anymore if I can't grow something as simple as aloe or a fern.*
---
**drama alert!**
---
Oh God a jacked grafton
---
&gt; No. It's already a free DLC. People can buy the base game.
---
Which sadly means that the battle royale probably won't sustain a healthy population. So far, no paid battle royale game has.
---
i actually didnt think of that lmaoo, thx b
---
Godzilla can swim very fast
---
Appreciate the help!
---
Would be a waste of overseer rank.
---
Just speculation, but if you are playing NW with a high lvl toon, you may not be earning enough XP for adventure mode to actually be leveling up. 
---
New toons probably earn enough to lvl up in adventure
---
Part of the main quest line actually, and for making it to that point as level 14s deserves some kudos 👍 Well done.
---
goddamn level 30 already!?!?!?! you must be on summer break i hope?
---
Ah that's a shame :( and thanks! you too!! :)
---
the ability to jump into trees is a sure advantage.
---
The cool part of them "bringing people back to Appalachia" is that now all they have to say is "We were waiting for the scorched plague to die down. Now we're back," for any faction.
---
Right, I didn't know this. So is this separate from selecting a saved blueprint?
---
99% of them have never even played the game or tried it for one hour, the hate usually tend to bring up the canvas bag or “pay to win” somehow lmaoo
---
You are a snivelling little sycophant aren't you? Lol
---
Way of the road, Bubs.
---
Also, it has nothing to do with adapting. Looking through bushes and behind trees to find the last coward, so you can insta-kill him is nothing but a waste of time.
---
Show us who sent the message.
---
Because the rest of the "paid battle royale" games didnt have anything else to offer. This is just a fin game model not the game. As long as fo76 has a population its battle royale will too. It isnt comparable to the other ones.
---
Used launch more as a relative term, most of my trading happened during the TSE gold rush. Which i assume is half my problem to begin with
---
There are deathclaw gauntlets as well
---
Why copyright and licensing laws need to be completely rewritten.
---
&gt; If they enjoy the trial they will buy the game
---
Not necessarily. I really enjoy Fallout 76's battle royale mode but, as someone who currently finds its adventure mode lacklustre, I can't really justify spending £30 on it  (the current price on the PS Store here in the UK) when there's other battle royale games I enjoy just as much that are free. For that same £30 also, I could buy games that I enjoy *all* the modes from like Battlefield V - that was £30 and worthwhile to me.
---
You can use the "block for session" option, but you have to do it for every, single, person on your friends list in game. It's tedious, it really should be tied to your profile status.
---
If I want to solo for a while, I just tell them I'm farming mats for crafting. I don't mind being in an XB party and playing solo, so if you change your mind you can join in, rather than having to unblock everyone again.

You both copied it from me.

While what you're saying is true, it's really all about the humor of hiding naked and unarmed, yet somehow winning

Thank you didn’t realize I needed a keycard for this part.

Yup it can be changed in the gamemode selection screen
---
He's listed as the executive producer, the first name in the credits. He was the public face of the game, hyping up people for a product he KNEW had major problems. Regardless of his level of involvement, he had no business saying things like "I read our games are buggy," as if it wasn't true, as if Bethesda doesn't have a reputation for delivering games modders have to fix. He deserves to be the public face of contrition.
---
Hackers are only a problem on PC, for me this is one of reasons why i tend to prefer console gaming rather than PC.
---
Dude I am GOD AWFUL at any type of PVP game, but this really isn't too hard if you stay with your group.  I finished third my first game, and won two more last night and I haven't killed anyone yet.
---
Thank \*you\* for all the hard work of continually evolving the game, bracing through fire, experimenting and continuing to listen to folks here and elsewhere. Keep it going!
---
yeah im level 11 and have gotten 7 duplicate cards... feels bad man

Yes. Something like Code breakers category...

I just want differant flavors of the jukebox. Id like to have the jukebox that you activate when you do the One Violent Night event.

I was really expecting some sort of complicated work around like what we have to do to build second stories with stairs, but this is super simple and looks amazing. 
---
I would have never thought to put a foundation over the plants like that; it would have literally never crossed my mind to even try. It seems like everything occupies a much bigger space than it seems and intersects with literally everything all the time, so the fact that crops and foundations *don't* blows my mind.
---
I'll have to find a way to use this with my CAMP the next time I redo it. Currently maxed out on budget, but I bet if I get rid of the current fencing around my crops I'd get enough space to make a greenhouse... 
---
The amount of times I've been flushed out of cover by mobs or the scorchbeast shooting me is frustrating but still an interesting game mechanic it keeps everybody guessing when the final circle closes in
---
Yeah your like 15-20 levels lower than you should be for the savage divide area. But that doesn't mean you cant just cheese him. I would grab as many plasma grenades you can stock up on. Make a buttload of throwing knifes . And if you have some psycho that will help a bunch. 
---
Otherwise if your trying to get him with pure weapon damage bring alot of ammo and jump up on rocks and high up things where it cant hit you.
---
A guy did that in a recent game on the final circle, me and my team mate died as did the launcher, but he won. I tip my hat to him.
---
Defo some type of weird glitch. Was back online earlier and revisited Venture. No damage taken standing on the landing pad
---
Yes. So if you wanted to, you could either build the thing you blueprinted, or you could build a new structure from the items in the stored tab.
---
Also, if you didn't want to do that say you built a simple room with 4 walls, if you go to the walls tab and try to build (if you house was made from wood walls for example) then on that specific type of wall there will be a number in brackets. That is the number of walls you'll have stored for example and can build those without using materials
---
Wood wall shutter (4)
---
Build one 
---
Wood wall shutter (3)
---
All the items you can store in the camp are like this. Some are more generalised, so even if you switch the wall type to the one with the door frame, it still pulls from the ones you have stored first.
---
Lol. I smell a soyboy (not you)

If you get some shotgun perks you can cripple it and then it's easy peasy. When in doubt, come back at a higher level.

Vats helps as you do more damage. Try sneaking too, although I know it's difficult without all of the perks. 
---
If you have the concentrated fire perk card, you can target it's legs to stop it from mobbing you.

I don't want to have to get to lvl 30-50 to be able to use all of my cards, but duplicates shouldn't be allowed.

I'm ok with the RNG aspect, but you could potentially be locked out of certain end game perks forever. Especially after you reach the point where you're not getting perks every level.

Found the duper.
---
Same - I quit months ago after a particularly bad night where I spent multiple hours fighting crashes in order to get about 10 minutes progress and just didn't pick it back up again until now.
---
I finally had a crash on day 3 (last night), but *everything* in the game feels better. After shitting all over the idea of a battle royale - I actually like it! And it lets people work out some of their agro off of the adventure server, so people are nicer on adventure now too.
---
Time to bust my PA helmet back out.
---
you'd rather they adapt their play style to how you think the game should be played?
---
Yeah, now that everybody is spending time in the main menu they’re realizing just how crazy loud that music is
---
Weird I have been consistently in the top ten in my matches yet have only gained one level this week. Everytime it says I have leveled up I check and I don't actually level.
---
If you're on PC the hackers seem to be coming more of a problem with NW.
---
I have been stacking them up in my camp near my workbenches, makes it look like I have actual materials storage
---
Actually you're all incorrect. After last Tuesdays update, the anything with neon now costs more towards budget. This means you were probably over budget after update, and now after scrapping a few things you are still technically over 100 percent. Happened to me too, and it's stupid because I bought something from the atomic shop and scrapped about 6 things and still can't place 1. Try scrapping something neon, and see if that frees up some budget.
---
You're not able to activate it. It's just a decorative tease.
---
Which I always thought was kinda odd since T-60 was all the BOS were in the Capitol Wasteland and the T-51 was more special in 3.
---
“Rat monkey”?
---
You can change those settings!
---
But I did activate it. It jiggled the plate.
---
If you have a weapon then you are not unarmed.
---
Hey wait, were you the other guy who was with me? Cause I just had the same scenario too (I gave 2 remaining nuclear cards to my teammate who had a nuke, he launches the nuke into the final curcle, obliterates everybody remaining in the game including himself)
---
You've been playing it for 7 months and you still don't consider it to have been worth 60€??
---
Thats bullshit. I doubt the only reason this reddit is FLOODED with posts about how amazing nuclear winter is the free players. I think the battle royale mode will keep a healthy population. 
---
Also, PUBG is a battle royale you pay for and I have never had a problem getting full matches.
---
My exact thought! So so simple. I was looking on YouTube for how to bring plants inside and it seems like everything people have done in the past has been patched.
---
At first I was just trying to have a bit of terrain exposed to put plants on and stumbled across this.
---
I'm glad it's helpful!
---
Honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if it did go free, it’s only a sneak peak after all.
---
You have to go back into adventure.
---
So you're telling me that you can hit a guy who is bunny hopping in the air just as easily if he's up in your face vs him being on the ground?
---
Yup, hackers are only a problem on PC.
---
Low effort rebuttal detected. 
---
You're the snowflake because you're triggered and have to lash out at someone who has evidence of being banned falsely. 
---
Todd will keep you safe.
---
True true, I’ve started blueprinting things for instances like that too. Made a sniper perch last night and a door maze
---
Ya when your team dies you can spectate anyone. It is possible he didn’t have unlimited ammo, but I he fired his Gatling gun for nearly the entirety of the match.
---
Go to the big world map and look in the top right
---
Friend this sub is for fan boys only, either say positive things or lose your karma, also thumbs up all 3 comments from you to try and offset it.
---
For myself, I usually price things for close to half what the game says they are worth... the exception being made for rare items. Radshield, for instance
---
I share my account with one of my kids and prefer to not share overseer level.
---
You can keep being salty about bans, I respect your choice, don't worry.
---
I guarantee if you got all the cards within the first 20 lvls you'd say this game mode is boring type of guy. I'm lvl 30 overseer and happy I don't have them all keeps me playing.
---
The RNG gods are displeased... offer more sacrifices to them.
---
Nah, there's many assholes lurking around here. I won't name them though because then I'll get banned for witch-hunting... again.
---
I won a match by getting the chameleon mutation and then hiding in a bush until everyone was dead. Not sure how the last player died. It wasn’t from my skill.
---
Wow, guess I should have looked more into it. I got the backpack and bailed.
---
He wasn’t even born yet in the timeline of 76
---
And yet I'm not banned......
---
I’m annoyed that it isn’t 76% off
---
Profit?
---
Not everybody is using the same strategy.  Teammates make noise.  When you are lying low trying to avoid everybody, the sound of footsteps is usually the first indicator that you are being stalked.  In a group, you lose that - because everybody is always moving around.
---
You have to actually find the camp first and talk to the robot counselor. He's give you a scout uniform and a few quests to get started, after that just complete the scout challengea in the world section of the challenge menu.
---
This feature has not been explained... people don't know about it!!!
---
I've died to the schorchbeast and its minions ganging up on me... when alone and in a hazmat... and I've seen a team mate get killed by a mutant dog... so there's that lol
---
I also am aged flatulence, and never understood the appeal of watching other people play games, let alone give them money for doing it, so you're not alone here.
---
Yeah true but then people comment about it and say like its to high or low, which give me anxiety?
---
Yep. Came in 9 hours ago. Delivery next Wednesday.
---
9 AGI is pretty expensive
---
He’s not just a man....he’s a symbol
---
Glad to hear it, son!
---
Youtubers stoked up a giant hate fire for the sake of generating views and a bunch of people who either can't or won't form their own opinions jumped right in.
---
The down side is you are huge target, it takes NINE agility to use, you dont have any perks for sprinting or AP regen so you cant run very far and when you are out of AP it takes an insane amount if time to get it back. I have this perk and getting around is a huge obstacle because of this. I can basically print 20 feet every 30 seconds.
---
A trillion times this!
---
I think your plants are the victims of the particular vibe they are going for in this game.   That being the late 50s early 60s polyester/plastic everything so they probably really are plastic.    My favorite is lead paint.    Lead can be obtained from the wood children's blocks because its in the paint used on them.   As advanced as this world is they are also laughably behind the time's in so many other ways.   It does explain quite a few things if you keep this in mind.
---
Again, once you get all 4 keycodes/keycards/whatever you like to call them plus a Nuclear Briefcase, you have to select the Nuclear Briefcase from your Pip-Boy or Favorites menu. That's it
---
Yeah, then i have to worry about legendary weapons and setting a good price on them.
---
It had a lot of issues coming out such as server stability. But since then it has improved drastically
---
Don't use power armor these days but still well worth getting them.
---
Ok. Thank you. 
---
-Beam splitter not focuser??
---
-Demo expert, I heard that didn’t work on TSE Gat Plasma and it doesn’t make my number higher when I equip it.
---
-why bear arms? Necessary?
---
-what about stabilized??
---
Had a really good team of 3 for a decent amount of time, we did consistently well and it went up quick. I think I'm fairly good, but my mates were even better XD
---
There in the challenge menu which if your on xbox is in the start menu. If your looking at the daily their should be one that says world challenge at the very bottom. The menu should look like daily weekly and so on in the side bar on the left. As for the challenges themselves it goes from running obstacle courses to multiple choice tests.
---
System config?
---
For real. I’ve only played 4 and 76 and even I know vault tec is pretty much the devil
---
Did you try to put  mayonnaise ontop of your Grafiphcard?
---
Should help!
---
Get the fuck outta here
---
Haven't played NW yet, but can you go outside the ring in the hazmat suit?
---
OH they are challenges like that! God do I feel stupid. Thanks!
---
Play the main game to increase your SPECIAL stats in battle royale, but otherwise no, nuclear winter is a completely seperate gsme mode with its own perk cards, and obviously equipment doesnt transfer since you reset BR evey match. The only thinfs you can bring to BR are cosmetics from the atomic shop.
---
Stable flux at 300% base price.
---
This is super good. Nice job!
---
I had zero interest in playing the game when it was announced but out of the 3 free play games announcing during e3 I thought I'd give 76 a chance.
---
Enjoyed it yesterday, playing some more today, might make a purchase of it remains fun for someone who doesn't have friends playing it.
---
At launch the game was not finished and barely playable. I say not finished b/c it was as if you were trying to play a buggy beta. As much as people here deny it, the launch of the game was terrible. Lots of graphics tearing, server crashes, huge load times were you were I game but unable to do anything, really bad balancing for building to repair rates, and all the typical Bethesda bugs as well. 
---
The game may have improved, but the initial representation to the larger community was that the game was not finished/poorly made, and it's hard to get rid of initial impressions.
---
🤣🤣
---
Right there with you!
---
Agreed OP. F2P player currently, love the battle royale, but struggling to really justify buying the game *just* for it when there are lots of good battle royale games out already that are cheaper or bundled with a game I already own or flatout free.
---
After he's done with your account, can I rent him?
---
I liked the game at launch but half the quests didn’t work and it crashed a lot. And the stash limit was absurd. They fixed that pretty quick though.  The duping era was annoying too.  I always dug it though,  definitely felt there was a bit of a feeding frenzy because of sheep mentality and youtube chuds.  I found it charming out of the gate, warts and all.
---
I think I have done it, is it the one when you go to file browser, and then find 76,and change the thing that says 1 to 0?
---
It isn’t an insult, in the past few days I’ve noticed when people who play NW need to make a comparison to another BR they go to Fortnite to bash as if it’s the only other battle royale out lol.
---
They are some of the old ones that have made their way back round but I'm happy they have kept it simple,I've got to go see biv and I'm dreading going there.
---
Can confirm. Have done this many times. Hassle me, be impetuous and I'll return in like with pettiness. 
---
It seems you want to access the legendary vendor? Welp, friend I'm afraid I'm very busy considering my options here. Do I buy a 3 star ranged weapon, a 3 star ranged weapon or a 3 star ranged weapon? I should probably do eeny meenie miny moe. Wait wait wait, that's not random enough, I'll assign each option a number and roll a dice. 1+2 for 3 star weapon, 3+4 for 3 star weapon and 5+6 for 3 star weapon. That'll be random... No no no, I can't just do that. I have to consider this thoroughly, it is, after all limited scrip. Hmmmm what to buy, decisions decisions. Oh? You've server hopped? Well decision is made! Glad I took the time to thoroughly consider my options ... for this 3 star medics pipe pistol -.-
---
I do, the level isn't there upon going back to adventure. I have probably received that message 20 times but have only gone from 294 to 295 this whole week.
---
In all honesty as someone who has a PA build. I do agree that power armor needs more love the what it is getting. It needs to feel more like a walking tank then a walker smart car. You can buy the Power armor mods and plans from the faction venders at whitesprings but they require some expensive materials.
---
Can confirm it is possible anywhere else on the map. I havent been to 51 yet, unfortunately. Will try tonight!
---
Easiest place to get then seems to be Flatwood. I get one everytime I go.
---
XPs for taken damage would be something i support
---
Ok, so I should make sure everything has loaded in properly, that makes sense. It also explains why earlier I got attacked by an invisible camp's turrets. The map and the workshop machine itself both said it was unclaimed, but while I was fighting I did see a chemistry bench load in. Thanks!
---
I mean I apparently also have to go find the plans for potted plants now and that's your fault so you owe me like, 200 caps.
---
Just buttering us up for upvotes and gold.  :-)
---
Damn it’s a long grind to that centurion helmet
---
You're proving my point here. Just close your eyes and pretend that everything is fine ;)
---
iirc a level 5 TSE weapon will be worth much more than a level 50 as any player can use it , this means you can set up another character and pretty much be at an advantage straight away , basically it means that you can breeze through any early game activities and even start grinding at a low level.
---
He’s a minute man, one minute he’s there, the next he’s not
---
That's what's so great about it though!
---
It's completely isolated! Well, besides some carry over cosmetics for Adventure/Survival. If you don't like it, you don't have to play it! But it IS there for people who do like that kind of gametype.
---
I can't stand PVP in general, no matter the game, and Battle Royale is at the top of the "meh" list for me. More of a singleplayer/Co-op/Fun party game kind of guy. But I don't need to touch Nuclear Winter to enjoy Fallout 76! 
---
It's a very smart way to do things really.
---
I can't wait for Wastelanders though!
---
Post here, with your platform of choice... someone will answer, for sure.
---
Hahaha. You don't want to know how much the empty white ones are then....
---
I got the potted plants plan from taking over a workshop for a while. You get a new plan every time you clear enemies. All my plans have been great.
---
You on ps4? I can build you some!
---
Oh god I almost don’t want to log in to find out XD
---
I dont like how everyone can spawn in the same location. The load times are too long, so I just dont like how I die nearly instantly cause the 10 people around me found a gun first.
---
Hahaha. You don't want to know how much the whitespring empty white ones are then....
---
I've been going with less than what the robots charge , more than what the robots pay. Gives some room for flexibility. The exception to this is rare outfits , good legendary weapons and armor. Rare outfits that cost 700-800 caps I sell for 1000-1200 depending on how rare. Trash legendary weapons that are being sold for scrip are 50 caps per star . Trash armor sold for scrip are 30 caps per star. Good legendary items vary widely depending specifics . Consult the 76 marketplace Reddit for info regarding these . Although they will tell you to do crazy prices. I'd rather price lower to move product faster.
---
Oh shit is there really? I can finally get that.
---
Been sick as how a snallygaster looks in this game, so I have just been grinding.
---
I get you, but I am in the opposite boat. I have 3 level 60+ characters that I am currently playing. Ranged, Melee, and a Crafter.
---
I would absolutely love a shared Overseer level.
---
Account sharing is also against the ToS. But as a step parent myself, I sympathize.
---
this happens alot when a game goes free... =/
---
This needs to be upvoted and bumped as much as possible.
---
With enough bad RNG it can make a character either gimped or unviable.  You don’t want to keep getting str cards on your 2 str character, it’s silly.
---
I personally wouldn’t mind having to earn ~80 cards, but the game must be smart enough to not give me duplicates.  Statistically speaking with random cards one would be pushing 160 packs before they got them all, and could hit 200 being a bit unlucky.
---
what if you are Todd?
---
This is a nice change. I thought you were going to start saying how it was a cash grab and waste of space. Thank you for being so polite. I hope you enjoy wastelanders as well
---
Focuser is good but the beam splitter will give u more bang for ur buck
---
I hope add groups of NPC raiders that go around the map
---
holding it at a local store is good, too. That's saved me time and money before when fixing deliveries
---
Ok, this makes sense. Thank you. So in regards to my existing blueprint, is there a way to store this so when I build it there will be no resource charge? At the moment my blueprint isn't built because I moved my camp (and missing a couple of resources to build the blueprint). Or do I need to build my blueprint with resource charge and then I can store it for future (free resource) builds?
---
I am not at home so I can't check for myself now. Thanks.
---
There were patch notes with instructions. Everyone should have read them.
---
All that work having nice spawn points for 5 Camps, if any are bad now I’ll be choked haha
---
Just fast travel to everyone's player vendors and kill the mobs u spawn from arriving. Afterwards declare you saved everyone loudly and lounge around acting like you own the place.
---
Won a match without killing someone as well just hid in. Ushes and buildings to the end and let the scorchbeast kill the last player
---
Yep precisely. So many people seem to think whatever form it ships out should be perfect and permanent. With all the tech and mechanics and graphics we demand of course it’s not going to be easy. But people seem to think “omg lol they just remade fallout 4 why can’t they just copy and paste those good npcs? It really goes to should just how braindead people are when it comes to coding and development. There’s a reason polishes games take up to a whole decade
---
 at times.
---
I think it happened if you hadnt finished any other dailies, mine stopped working when i finished a different daily but before then i finished it ~25 times
---
I whole heartily agree
---
Really? 🤔 Ok Thanks.
---
Just like what yaosio said if the Vault Dweller has the T-01 Power Armor and a Laser Rifle your not gonna defeat them even if the slap damage was still there 5hp lose will be lower to a Power Armor Player. So good luck with that
---
I did. I survived.
---
What do you mean by script?
---
the only benefit to winning are challenge rewards and more points/ caps rewards. Your rewarded the most for surviving, not killing. The longer you can survive on the map, the more points you'll get. It would take a while but you could never even sniff top 10 and still level up like everyone else.
---
Honestly, they just played it really smart with E3 this year.  
---
I haven't played in months, and Nuclear Winter was not something that I would have come back for either.  
---
Then they announced what they were going to do with Wastelanders and I got very hyped. 
---
So much so that I decided to boot up the game again. To my surprise, Nuclear Winter was playable already. Didn't even realize this was the case honestly, because I zoned out for anything bu Wastelanders.  
---
Then decided to play a game of it, because it was there anyway, and I actually ended up having fun... Even had a couple of good games as well now.
---
You sound like someone I want to play with.  Add me.  I kept getting stuck with kids yesterday and it sucked then someone made fun of me for being 31 lol.  PSN is same as name on here.
---
June 18th roles around
---
New challenge for 10 Atoms: Kill a 3* sheepsquach while naked, while engaged in PVP, at Fissure prime, during a nuke, while drunk, and take a picture with 2 different kinds of camera lens
---
My hypothesis, definitely unconfirmed, is that it's when a certain buff falls off. I haven't tested it but my guess would be a +HP buff so when you lose it the game registers it as losing that health and registers as taking damage.
---
exactly what I meant actually ;p
---
Yep turn on Pacifist mode
---
You are welcome! Well i've always stuck by Fallout 76 and always liked the community for it's mostly none toxic atmosphere and even though it was a little rant/vent I figured.. eh not for me, but why be like all those that slammed me for playing Fallout 76 on launch? :P
---
What system are you on? And do you know your internet speeds?? I've met people of all platforms that have had issues, and usually it's an internet problem. If you're running wireless, try wired - a pain in this day and age, but it is proven to be faster.
---
*sweats*
---
What are you playing on? I have a shower at my camp if you are on Xbox.
---
Shhhhhhhhh don't give them ideas, they actually listen to us here. If wastelanders comes with Preston Garvey's descendants I will blame you
---
But that’s 3 less people that can kill you! Haha! I don’t play solo, but it seems like it might be part of the strategy for solo players
---
I would ask that they find a way to offer those of us who really don't enjoy the mode to explore the vault/learn the lore without having to play the mode. Even if we never get access to any of the new items/skins (through quests/event rewards) then at least give us a chance to explore through quests and learn the lore.
---
Try to milk the brahmin in flatwoots. Brahmin milk will take some rads away.
---
PC
---
I have been playing this game since beta and just learned how to do that without being at the workbench. Thanks!
---
Get no scoped
---
Thanks, I think I have discovered that place so that helps
---
What level are you, are you near whitesprings or have discovered it? There is a Decon shower in the Blackwater mine, you might be lucky and meet a player that'll help you get there or has a Decon shower in there base, they take off rads.
---
Additionally, when you die you get a slight auto rad heal. Due enough times they'd go down quite quick I believe.
---
Hey I won that workshop last night!  Had no idea what I was doing and then didn't understand setting up equipment to mine the nodes lol.
---
Edited the post :)
---
Ah that would've been important information I guess.  I'm on PC, and sadly wired isn't really an option based on where our modem+router has to be located and where the PC has to be located.
---
It's mostly frustrating because it loads for a split second into the vault before cutting to the disconnected error.
---
I'm also worried that every time this happens some team of 4 is getting their fourth removed at the last moment.
---
No, i played it for like 50 hours
---
Well if you have an account with extra skill points, you can swap out other stats to agility to get that needed AP regen perk in adventure lol.
---
You are 100% wrong. Go play something else.
---
Then why have Survival Mode if that is the case. If the goal is to make Fallout 76, Sea of Thieves 2.0
---
Nah, I have lots of fun interacting with new players.
---
oh wow, I haven't thought of blueprinting stuff!
---
Nah PC. I'll just put them all in a bath tub like the dirty hillbilly my character is lol.
---
The thing is i paid for full game at start not for early access
---
... unless you’re a shrieking 9 year old. Then please turn your Xbox off.
---
Nah, I think it'll function like an MMO you probably need to finish the main quest line, or have the level requirement to do it
---
Ope, maybe I misread...I had just woke up when I commented this lol
---
I think it’s good but a key-down after FO4. There’s a sterile, abandoned feeling to the game, probably because Bethesda expected more players to be populating it. Also a small fraction of players have headsets (or even want to talk to people), adding to the listlessness.
---
It’s pretty clear most haven’t played since launch or at all.
---
Thought that's what you meant. Great suggestion! I'll pass it along to the team.
---
I did this accidentally as a level 5... here's how I got out of it 🙂
---
I went to Flatwoods, south of overseer camp, and took EVERYTHING - then sold it to the vendor, take Grape Mentats if you find them to get the most bang for your buck. You can also run the route from the Vault to the barn just south, overseer camp, to Flatwoods. Take, and sell, absolutely everything. Should be able to buy a few full strength radaways.

---
 &gt; Thought that's what you meant. Great suggestion! I'll pass it along to the team.
---
you can always go outside, it gives you rads and drains your health. The hazmat lets you stay in nuked areas (the whole useable map in this case), and keeps you from getting rads outside. You still need stimpacks to compensate for the health drain.
---
Sorry, what I was wondering was what hardware and possibly some driver versions.  I know that certain graphics driver versions will cause problems with various games but usually one of the biggest problems is the speed of transfer from disk since a lot of today's games load textures "on the fly" as needed by the game since textures have gotten much larger over the years.
---
Things like the amount of RAM on the video card and for your system can be the difference as well and I believe one of the recent updates radically changed the way things are being loaded and how much memory is being allocated and etc...
---
Previous comment was actually tech support shorthand for "what are the system specs you are running the game on"...
---
It’s not patched but you need to start on the edge of a foundation :) Miz Tracy on YouTube did a video, but this looks cleaner imo
---
The explosive effect applies to every single projectile. Beam splitter basically quadruples the explosive damage you gain from the weapon, at the cost of accuracy. But in my experience it's still good enough for scorchbeasts when you use the power armor accuracy perk
---
Has anyone else encountered the influx of new players who think the PvP combat starts as soon as they step out of Vault 76?  I hope it's equally annoying that my level 70 character is just giving them a thumbs down as that level two keeps swiping at me with some level 5 melee weapon.  And I only went to the entrance to hand out free plans to the newbs!  Some thanks I get!
---
nope. doesn't. tried on every weapon in the game. only flamers so far
---
You can find radaways in medkits. You also could get lucky in finding a camp that has the Decontamination Arch. 
---
Just by looting around you can get a full supply. I never had to buy a single radaway.
---
It’s in the gameplay settings in the options menu
---
Another way to say that it is in beta/alpha.
---
Ppl will always complain about others pricing, that's because they feel that they should always get the deal,  I bet if you went to their camp you'd see some wacky pricing.  I will sell for what I want if it's a legendary item and they dont like my price they may message asking to negotiate which I will if it doesnt sell then I will scrap it.  If its junk and they dont like my price then they can get off their lazy butt and go farm it.
---
Yeah, that takes a ton of time. Switching points back and forth isnt something you can just do all the time. That isnt a valid arguement. Gtg.
---
So, I'm not a fan of BRs. But... are you saying that stuff earned in NW carries over to adventure mode?
---
Congratulations you revived a dead comment that you couldn't let just die. Also the Power armor is called the X-01 Laser Rifles don't deal as much damage compared to other weapons it just matters on your build. Also there are perks to take out power armor users. You just need to learn how the game is played in order to ensure you survive. And either way you can just fast travel away to another location or leave the server. Slap damage wasn't all that bad they just needed to fix it.
---
I've been playing since BETA. It was rough, but hardly the worst Fallout at launch (New Vegas still holds that crown for me). The marketing team fucked up hard, there were serious issues with the games stability and balance, and it being a retail title with any form of microtrans made it a HUGE target for the YouTube and Twitter hate circlejerk. Some of it was well deserved, some of it was just regurgitated anger that this game wasn't New Vegas 2:Electric Boogaloo. It's steadily improved since it came out and I'd say it's like 85-90% of the way to feeling like a really well rounded game now.
---
That said, what came out was *Exactly* what I wanted. I wanted to be able to explore an interesting world with my friends. The desolation and emptiness of not having NPCs (in the traditional sense) worked for me and I thought it fit with the story the game told. It's been interesting watching players fill the roles of usual quest givers, merchants, and random encounters. In regards to the story itself, it seems like we're taking a more "seasons" style approach to it so the humans returning after the events of Scorched Earth make sense. 
---
It did throw some typical fallout conventions out the window, and that definitely upset some people. Wether that was because they didn't quite know how to implement branching dialogue and consequences in an online environment or because it just didn't fit with the story they wanted to tell, it's hard to say. 
---
In any case, you've certainly picked a great time to try it out. The game is the best it's ever been and is poised to only get better! Happy adventuring!
---
P.S. Nuclear Winter is WAY more fun than it has any right to be.
---
You’re welcome! Gears, screws, and aluminum are the three things I am always low on so I know the struggle.
---
You stubbed your toe.
---
Welcome to this sub.
---
Exactly...this is the one time sticking your d@*# in crazy might be a good idea.

Ditto here. Only once for me since the last update on the PC.
---
Arktos pharma is a good spot, I found 3 3*’s in one habitat room
---
I played most of this game alone and just recently started playing with others. But you could post here, discord, and Facebook has a few groups too. Sometimes too you’ll find people running around just inviting to a team. Made a few friends by accepting those.
---
The Lore of 51 isnt even that important. Quit griping.
---
They're going to bring his great great grandson Cuthbert Garvy in when they add human NPCs. Cuthbert will be able to spam quests at you from half-way across the map.
---
The legendary vendor at Berkeley train station sells weapons and armor for scrip, you can break down 150 worth in scrip per day. Some players would rather buy some junk legendary items to get their daily scrip than running around finding them. 
---
I think every train station has a legendary exchange machine for breaking them down for scrip. 
---
When I first log in , I hit up all of my farming spots until I hit my daily limit. Then for the rest of my session, all extra junk legendaries I get I sell to others that don't feel like farming. They sell quickly with that fair pricing system. It at starts at 10 caps per scrip , but gets to be a much better deal the more stars the item has.
---
Kinda hijacking a little, however did the latest update add the human npcs? Or is that coming later. I haven't played in a minute but I feel like simply having npcs would be a huge improvement in how lonely the game felt.
---
Hahaha some people just want to watch the world burn.
---
I didn’t til last night. I have a camp I love and didn’t want to level it to start blueprinting stuff. So I went to a workshop instead to blueprint multiple things.
---
I dont understand how that makes me a faux badass but okay, I'm cool with it. I mean, I actually am kind of a badass but, whatevs.
---
Great strategy to die first lol.
---
Other Reddit’s can help as well. fo76filthycasuals is one.
---
The game was buggy and unstable at launch. Granted, any Obsidian game (especially FNV) was even more buggy at launch and any released online game is usually even more unstable (from the games I played at least), but the stability of the game was a bit unpleasant. Combine this with quite a niche content (focus on roleplaying without handholding and on exploration) and with general audience already being negative towards the game (based on false info like "no story", "no NPCs", "Rust clone", "cashgrab with reused assets") and you'll get a response where people actually want the game to fail. Many people came to the game searching for reasons to label it as fail. 
---
In most metrics the game was mediocre at worst, but the negativity of the game resulted in basically a witchhunt. "I don't like content in any other game? I won't play it, it cannot satisfy everyone. I don't like content in Fallout 76? THE GAME IS SHIT!" Any possible objectivity when reviewing/rating the game went out of the window at the moment when people were in advance innoculated to consider the game bad. As I said, any flaw in the game was overblown to point out how shit it was. And then any reviewer how wanted to keep his "street cred" was forced to hate on the game otherwise the general gaming audience would tear them apart. Circlejerking on r/Games reviewer of Fallout 76 became the sport of November 2018. Every day a new negative interview and the same 100s of negative, misinformed and insulting comments. And the reviews were bullshit too... I'm not sure if it was Angry Joe or Jim Stirling (both are nowadays really angry) who made his video "review" consisting basically of bugs and crashes gathered from all over the internet. Instead of showing the actual gameplay they have misinformed their audience about the state of the game. Imagine if someone made such a video about Witcher 3. I'm sure you can compile a video full of Witcher 3 bugs as well...
---
As I said, the state of the game at launch was unpleasant and quite inexcusable. Currently Fo76 is having meta score of 2.8, while Anthem has 5.1. In reality, the scores should be reverse. Score in range 5-7 is quite fair for the state of the game at launch. Anything under 5 really misrepresented the game. But these are the gamers of today. Half of them jumps on the hatetrain and rates 0/10 just to be part of the cool club, while the other half rates 0/10 to punish Bethesda for releasing a multiplayer title instead of New Vegas 2.
---
Understand, I'm all for Bethesda learning the lesson to release games in a better state, but to basically bury a game using false narratives is childish.
---
I can't find my elders coat in the atomic shop even though I bought it plus the vault boy and girl power armor heads can't be equipped for NW
---
1 Ask to an high level player, spam help emote or use the microphone, radaway are not a problem for an high level. Or they could have a decontamination shower in their CAMP
---
2 MAYBE if you die from radiation you will come back without radiation. Never tried however.
---
3 Radaway are not so expensive, if you sale some materials you can easily get the caps to buy it at a train station
---
Screws is the one thing I’m always low on. I’ll spend a few hours grinding to get them and then all of a sudden it’s like I’m out of them again.
---
Haha perfect. Anything sits on top of them so there might be something cool in tables or stash boxes.
---
I can't seem to get this dang perk. I have 12 AGI, 9 for this perk is nothing. Having a 4 STR, and getting **nothing but melee perks**, *that* is a problem
---
That's an amazing idea.
---
They declared it as a "sneak peak", so that noone can flame them for the glitches and bugs
---
Grandfather. This is set at least 200 years before 4
---
If you dabbled in taking nuka colas as trade payment they banned people for having way to many colas on em, because the amount cannot ever be legitimately obtained.
---
Once you have the full version you can play normally.
---
Or either
---
They’re not in the game yet. The recent Nuclear Winter update just added the new mode, but the Wastelanders update is coming out in the fall and it’ll include NPCs and settlements. I’m definitely looking forward to it!
---
Most everything you say is not correct. Sync and borderless window was patched early on. You can navigate the radial menus using the numeric keys like a clock; i.e. 1 = 1 o'clock slot,  9 =9 o"clock on the radial menu. Esc works to exit most any menu. DOF and DOV were added months ago as well as wide monitor support and push to talk.
---
Oh really? I watched the YouTube videos but couldn't get it working and read that it was patched. Ah well good to know! Thanks!
---
Couldn’t agree more, I’ve had teammates who literally  wander away from the team and get themselves killed. Then have the decency to get mad about how none of us were there to revive or help them out.
---
I mentioned above that demo expert didn’t raise my damage output number at all (nor does two-shot for that matter). I just assumed it was completely nerfed for TSE Gat Plasma.
---
*Japan
---
Gonna do this once I get home O\_O
---
Thank you for such a well written response!
---
I’m not a huge fan of BR style gaming but its nice to see how well they did it compared to other styles I have tried. It’s definitely something to hold me over until wastelanders.
---
It was different.  FO76 is an odd hybrid game, mixing genres and styles.  It really needs to be judged on its own merits, as its own unique thing, and most of the critics didn't.
---
Oh I see
---
Only if you play Survival mode (free-for-all pvp), and the only loot they'll drop are their junk and aid items, and you will also get some of their caps. In regular Adventure mode (where pvp requires the consent of both parties, but most people have pacifist turned on and don't engage), if you die you only drop your junk items. You can run back to your death location to retrieve your dropped loot as long as nobody else picks it up.
---
Basically, if you want to pvp, Survival mode is where to go. Otherwise, stick to Adventure. You can freely switch between the two with the same character. :)
---
It doesn't seem that buggy tho
---
Hey, if you are still struggling with this tomorrow l, add my IGN iGhostfire92 - I’ll help you out as much as I can. But like others have mentioned, Rafa way from med boxes or laying on tables in flatwoods, or milk Brahman.
---
Ahhh okay, ty! I'm really excited for it! The footage even had the speech prompts and stuff, I think that update is gonna take the game to a new level.
---
I’ve noticed some people join a team just so even if they die and the team ends up winning, they are also considered winning. (If they don’t exit)
---
After a few days not doing hunting, I did it today and my usual rich spots (Whitesprings, West-Tek) had zero legendaries. Maybe the large influx of new players make the servers spawn fewer legendaries, even for veteran 200+ players.
---
This sub is an airtight circlejerk, they're all just gonna say crap like it was the cool thing to do totally dismissing Bethesda's mistakes. That canvas bag debacle should be enough to turn people off on praising this company, it was full on fraud (not to mention Nuka Cola Dark). 
---
I don't hate the game but it really isn't *that* great. People around here act like its the best thing to ever happen and anyone with any criticisms is braindead and a hater. Seen it in a hundred other communities, its never good. This sub is like the t_d of fallout communities. The game is lacking in content and there is so little player interaction or things to do in the endgame that high levels just roam around the starter area giving crap away. 
---
The game is aiight but reading this sub you'd thing Fallout 76 died on the cross for our sins and we should proclaim it our savior. Quite a joke arpund here.
---
I shamelessly sold the 5 I had this week for 2k caps each.  Figured it cost me a few thousand in fast travel caps so the price wasn’t that unreasonable.   If I find more and you’re on PS4 I’ll hook you up.
---
And they were originally founded by Bethesda people.
---
If you're on console, just make another profile. If you're on PC, sorry for your luck.
---
It’s like £12 on CD Keys if your on about bathesda.net price :D
---
Corn stalk out of a toilet it is!
---
You need a break man... chill out!
---
pick a spawn point near two locations but not on top of them and run to the empty on when the game starts.  you get 10 or so seconds of being invisible and invincible so use it.
---
Whitespring, Harpers Ferry, West Teck, Uranium fever event, One violent night event are my favourite. Also horde events.
---
Mods on this sub forum are jokes 😂
---
It’s only 100 in excavator not including the shocks.
---
Are you kidding me with that reply? You can just swap out and good to go for the rest of your time unless you plan on changing stats haha. Bro just admit defeat.
---
That's my biggest issue. So many free BR games. But once you are sucked in and have a high level character that you can take right into Adventure mode, I have a feeling you will buy it lol.
---
I agree, I believe it's because of my level, but that means they are using a generic number to base this off of and not your actual character levels...which should classify as a bug.
---
Yeah, I know, I said that.
---
Oops. You're right. great great great great (great?) grandfather.
---
Well , like many things tested in labs, once you release it into the wild, and it gets used by players and machines that cannot be replicated in the office environment, you learn ALOT more about whats working and what isnt.
---
Not to mention the folks that live to “break” stuff cause they can.
---
Having designed many levels for L4D , we tested the hell out of it for months before releasing it. We thought we had a unbreakable map, but ince it mixed with the zillions of mods and machines put there, we spent many more months bug hunting and refining.
---
Years later, we had to stop updating because it was literally monthly changes just to keep up with all the changes outside the level on PC that would affect how it worked.
---
I'm sorry , I accidentally replied as another comment.
---
No you said extra 200
---
The skin packs don’t include excavator usually either. Excavator and Ultracite have their own separate skins and for the longest time they didn’t even have any. Not sure why this decision was made but that’s how it’s been. They seem to want to keep the T series together and everything else separate.
---
Half the people playing are here for the free week and are new to FO76. They probably don't even know where to go for patch notes.
---
"Including shocks" read what I said, dude.
---
This sub is the t_d of fallout boards. I kind of hope some of them are shills with how they ride Bethesda's dick despite it being a demonstrably sheisty company.
---
Same. 9 agility is nothing especially if you're account you carried over has max stats and left over points to swap(permanently).
---
Well your name that everyone will see can be changed once every 3 months. But the names you give each if your characters, cannot.
---
MAKE A SLIDER FOR MENU MUSIC, FFS!!!
---
Same for every other non t-51b/excavator PA. I'm using T-60 and I'm feeling just like you.
---
The new music is much better, but the ability to change the volume and/or mute it would be great.
---
While it would be touching to do something like that for any fan, it would be hard to justify. I don’t know who he is along with a lot of other people. If he is added as a NPC, what stops other people from asking the same for their friends and family. Bethesda cannot just make a NPC for everyone who just asks for one or else it would lose the very meaning of adding them in the first place. 
---
If this guy is an exception and deserves it, why so? What makes him more special than the many other fans who may have died during the time? How has he contributed as a fan that made lasting change? The same can be said for the kid in Nuka World but I suppose they saw something special in a disable kid being a fan of Fallout. That sorta open the gate to having other people added into the game.
---
Doesn't matter what you do you will still get some dick message you saying "your prices are too high"... I always reply "thank you".
---
There are certain items that sell well... ammo... shotgun, 5.56, .45, .308... and stuff that never sells... ammo... cryo, gamma, .50 balls
---
Price it at base cost and see what moves... lower stuff that doesn't sell... bin stuff that never sells... you'll be surprised what shifts... and at what price... once you find what works you can control the throughput by raising and lowering to keep your stash weight balanced.
---
This last bit is important to me... if I'm at 600 I can raise prices on my stable flux and their components (heavy stuff)... if I'm at 800 then I lower prices to make room...
---
Most stuff is between 40 and 70 % of base price... why sell at 10 or 20? ... you can get 25% by chucking it at a vendor... ( all those people flogging serums at 200 caps!!! )
---
Don't forget wasteland tax (currently 10%)... so your 500 cap item will only get you 450 caps... 
---
Legendary items are a lottery... price them with your gut... keep lowering them if you want caps... or just scrip if they don't sell. 
---
Through the camp trading machines I have bought all but 2 of the serum recipes and all the x01 plans along with dozen or so key plans that I was missing... now just keep buying decent gear to try out from other people...
---
You know you can make bug-showcase video for any game? How about bug showcase for Witcher 3 or RDR2. Would the existence of such videos make the games bad? No, of course not. That's because cherrypicking ANYTHING is forcing a narrative and intentionally misrepresenting ANY game. I can make 3 hour video of picking flower. Is Fallout 76 now a gardening simulator? I can make video where I have constantly 10+ people doing funny shit. Is Fallout 76 game full of players at every corner?
---
This whole argument is bad. Anytime there's a "proof" why unpopular game X is bad, ask yourself if the same argument can be made about popular game Y. Most of the time the answer is YES. This is why critical thinking is necessary. But 2018 is a proof that general gaming audience is uncapable of critical thinking.
---
Playing solo is a ton of fun, obviously sometimes you get unlucky but I've played my cards right and been one of the last few survivors multiple times now. You just need to get a little lucky with your spawn, and play the stealth/snipe game for a while while other teams wipe each other out.
---
Yeah honestly I really don’t know what I’ve unlocked so far haha
---
It's happening to many people regardless of the game. Happened to me a few minutes ago while playing For Honor.
---
Oh hey - didn't know this. Thanks for informing me!
---
The game is good, just not $59.99 good.  For $17 on Amazon, it's a good game.
---
Bitching about the game having a BR mode was extremely short sighted.  While it might not be the average Fallout player's cup of tea, it certainly was always going to give the game a shot in the arm.
---
Bring on the ban wave!  Maybe the sneak peak week was just to identify the people who cheat and get them banned?
---
Looking at any door/container in your camp/workshop, press F
---
Sounds like it will fit me perfectly.
---
No shit. I figured something like that would be easy for Bethesda to pick up on, like how they can see if you access a cell you shouldn't be in, like ones that contain recurring legendary respawns and serums and shit
---
The armor penetration is 45%. Sadly it is situational because it is hard to get power armor and a heavy gun in NW sometimes.
---
Well fak.
---
Todd himself admited that game was not ready and it needed lots more of beta testing and criticism was well deserved.
---
 I just don't understand this ppl. I am sick of companies releasing unfinished games that should be early access and then fanboys prasing them after 6-12 months when they actually finish the game like it was intended they. And thanking them for not giving up on the game ffs
---
From the way it’s described, I’d say most likely.
---
Well we still have to admit the game released in a pretty terrible state. The criticism in the beginning was justified (not all of it though). The game came a long way and the updates it received made the game alot better then it was on release.
---
Most of us here just believed what bethesda was trying to do with fo76 would eventually turn into something great and it seems we were right to stick around ;). 
---
The only thing i still hope for is some kind of hardcore survival mode where it is hard to survive on our own and we need to work together to survive the wasteland.
---
seeing the same, it tells me all the time to go back to adv. mode to level up, but no new levels :/ probably buggy..
---
I'm currently using it. Just to flex
---
It seems like there are several Excavator paint schemes available. But I think there may be only one Ultracite scheme out right now (unless I'm missing something).
---
I was near the end of the big bridge neat the resort with a team mate. Madlad move for sure, loved seeing it happen.
---
While you're at it can you improve the Scorchbeast loot pool so they are worth killing in all modes? K thanks.
---
They defrauded people. Twice. Quit riding their dick, the game is just *okay.*
---
Ugh. Leveling is so much effort though. Not a bad idea though
---
They dont support mods at this time, when the game released they had mentioned mods wouldn't be supported until they rolled out private servers (which I'm still hoping will happen at some point)
---
max out your pharma farmer perk and never have to worry about any kind of aid item ever again.
---
It’s all good. Very few found them without asking. Lol
---
I thought that it was when a drug or such wore off. This definitely makes more sense that it’s when a HP buff ends
---
Yeah, I understand why they don’t let you wear an outfit over armor because it might be considered p2w due to the enemies not being able to see what armor you have
---
Same price for each system, 17 bucks on Amazon atm.
---
This is not a bug but a feature, now you have a reason to grind for materials.
---
Same.  I can hide well, follow my team well, provide some cover fire when trying to flank someone (but never seem to actually hit anyone) and have revived a few people but I'm probably the least helpful team member. :/  Just last night I finally got my second kill, though downed a number of people.
---
Nah no chance, he just had like 300 ping
---
Myself have been trying to find the diffusers.
---
Fortnite 76, the game no one wanted,and no one swill still not play.. This is one of the most slapped on ad hock make shift dumb ideas in video game history . One of the best franchises of all time copy and pasts one of the most mind numbing dumb ideas in gaming history .  
---
 I can not wait to eat popcorn the day Bethesda finally closes the doors for good . I hope they manage to find a way to sue the pants off this dev team for ruining possible billions in revenue .   
---
DIE IN A FIRE.
---
Went through this same route of support, the final solution they gave was "It's a known issue, keep an eye on forums and patch notes." It has been an issue since launch, known at that, and nothing's been done.
---
Same,  suck at PVP that's why i need my frogy legs :)
---
For some reason other players refuse to stand still while i kill them, so i need to make a fast getaway....
---
Yep, carnivore mutation and lead belly x3. All that's needed. Run out of meat, eat whatever you want without disease or rads. Because of this, i stock up on ionized meat. Has no condition so it never spoils, weighs less than typical meats and with the mutation and perk there is no downside.
---
&gt;2 MAYBE if you die from radiation you will come back without radiation. Never tried however.
---
You come back with less Rads, but not no Rads
---
Sorry to hear it's not for you. I generally hate PvP and Battle Royale, specifically. Honestly, Nuclear Winter has been nothing but a good time, nothing but bonuses for playing, and no real consequences. Also, wow did I rely on VATs a lot in Adventure mode!
---
Who?
---
Thank you Bethesda!! My wallet also thanks you!
---
I'm waiting for release of Cyberpunk 77 and for people ignoring the bugs and other issues. A game of such complexity has to have these issues. Witcher 3 had tons of issues at launch. I can already see the popular comments like "I don't care about bugs. I still have fun.", when the same comments made in defense of Fo76 were downvoted to hell.
---
That's what you get for having a Deathclaw as a pet.  Seriously, what did you think was going to happen?
---
&gt; As a 50 yod gamer,
---
Newbie.  (60 years old, me).
---
I saw someone post the other day that the creatures you target to tame need to be random spawns, and I \*think\* it said something about them being under level 30 as well. That would explain why people talk so much about server hopping to find the 'right' target to tame.
---
At the beginning it is annoying, but is not an issue after you build your CAMP, mostly for purified water.
---
Food is everywhere.
---
wheres is the legendary vendor  located at
---
This has been a known problem for a long time, hopefully with the exposure it receives due to the free access and massive issues it cause with Nuclear Winter it will see a resolution. Thanks for posting on here about it though, the attention definitely helps. :)
---
Maybe make a cost of like 2 nuke codes or something
---
How does this work, if i place my camp, does it mess up my current placed camp in adv. mode ? haven't had the balls to test it :)
---
Excavator has more skins, ultracite just has the one so far. The four horsemen skins apply over any of the power armors in the game but they change the model to look like the skin. Those were limited time though.
---
*dont forget the part about being well fed and diseased
---
Happened to me yesterday too, took me an hour to refill all 4 of mine to capacity.  It doesn't help with the scroll bug either.
---
Same here, probably an issue with how NW cards are handeled in the same slots but hidden in adventure. I swap cards a lot (hard bargain, ammosmith...) and it's a pain.
---
Don't get hung up on it... the game is telling you to come back when you are stronger... if you got through this then the next thing is even harder... do some side quests... do some events... explore... do NW ( you get xp in there as well as your overseer ranks apparently )
---
I'm not denying the pleasure others can get from it, but the 10 games i've played, I spawn in with my group, get a bit of gear going and then first time i see an enemy i'm already downed, it's like I never get to fire a shot and i've played Survival mode alot and don't think im bad at PvP in Fallout 76. It's just that this game mode seems to fast for me :(
---
It be like that sometimes
---
No witch hunting.
---
Don't forget to also check medicine cabinet mirrors, some are searchable for first aid supplies.
---
If you're around Flatwoods, there are a few locations where you can find a med kit, doctor's bag, chem box ,or searchable medicine cabinet mirror. Those are:
---
Green Country Lodge: 4
---
Room above workout room with radroach and weights has a medkit and a medicine cabinet. On the stairs inside leading up is a locked skill 0 chem box. Near the pool outside is a single recliner with a medkit under it.
---
Flatwoods: At least 3.
---
1 medkit is right outside on the stone wall, there's usually a radaway or radx next to it. Inside Flatwoods Church is a medkit and doctors bag, possibly radway or radx spawn. I think the buildings in Flatwoods might have a med kit in the bathrooms.
---
Near the Vault Tec Agricultural Research Center are several sheds, there are medkits scattered around on the walls inside them.
---
Lastly other people have suggested visiting other player camps (green icons on the map), some may have a decontamination shower, which will remove your rads.
---
I haven’t found a radaway in a week
---
what would you say a lvl 25 2 star lever action rifle sell for?
---
Why are you alive? Why are so many other people dead, and you somehow managed to make it this far?
---
Hmmm sounds like a lot more work than I’d like to do considering I have very impolite neighbors. Those stingwings just like going around giving everyone diseases 🙄
---
If you play with a team this seems to be a waste IMO. It doesn't hurt the teammate reviving you but it can cause confusion. I typically end up alone at the end but have after a dozen or so matches never saw it actually kill a looting player. Neat idea but not the most useful imo.
---
Hmmm... no email for me yet.  I'll keep an eye out for it though.
---
Me, too get an error 4:9:0 constantly
---
FO76 at launch was a very different game.  VERY
---
Bugs, lack of content, missing features, poor server stability.
---
Anyone saying it was just "popular to hate on it" isn't being honest, or didn't play the game at launch.
---
There's tons of posts and articles now about how much the game has improved -it has- but keep in mind they wouldn't be talking about that improvement if the game hadn't changed so much.
---
Which is a super fascinating consequence of NW taking place on a map that was designed as a (mostly) single player exploration game, NOT as a battle royale. I also love that aspect.
---
The game was objectively bad when it was released. Anyone who disagrees is a shill, or didn't play on release.
---
The game is currently on like 50% sale.... Ps4 is 30 dollar or sumn crazy
---
You're actually right. Keep hiding and feeding. Easier wins for the rest of us. I should be thankful
---
Berkeley springs train station is in the east half of the map in the mire. Northwest of harpers ferry.
---
same here. It's propably not you. and if it is: you're not alone
---
Yes 2018 is a proof, when people like you make excuses for companies that release unfinished games, even Todd in interview with IGN said that they made mistake and the game needed a lot more of beta testing, he admited that crticism was well deserved and it helped them to see their errors.
---
Grow back Appalachia, One foundation at a time!
---
Well to answer the last bit of your question, when it first came out, for many people it was practically unplayable, world not even loading, enemies were invisible (Both still happen but to very rare degrees now, last one happened to me recently), and it was just in a extremely poor state technically.  Has it improved over time? Sure, is it still a more than average buggy game compared to the rest of bethesda's games? For damn sure.  People are still shitting on it cause of them adding stuff to the game rather than focusing on issues.
---
I don't know... I thought the thrilling thing with Battle Royale games was the YOLO thing.
---
The cover definitely doesn't have the same feel, and I agree with /u/taac52 .  It wouldn't fit with the other music
---
Lol, on the contrary I think you're TOO PC. Please don't worry about it :) Happen to have a lot of male friends and I just tire a little of the "womenz be smart, menz be drooling, testosterone-fueled idiots" trope that seems popular these days. :) That's all.
---
No problem! I think that's why whenever super high level players level up they're just holding onto the perk points. 
---
In Bethesdas words they're implementing a "prestige" system which also adds more powerful perk cards. I believe Tod said it in an interview, but I don't think it's going to be as flushed out or as legendary as they make it out to be :p
---
Horrendous performance and poor programming included
---
In fallout lore it is china vs america, thats why i pick china
---
This is the message I got: [https://imgur.com/a/IGmzzZM](https://imgur.com/a/IGmzzZM)
---
I've redacted the name because as u/HughesJohn said, no witch hunting.
---
Well whilst playing FO76 today it froze my PS4 and i had to literally pull the plug which corrupted my files... then had to delete the game redo all the updates and reinstall so idk.....never had an issue that serious before but i have been blue screening a lot recently since the Nuclear Winter Update...mostly when i use the legendary vending machines but quite often its just random.
---
So I can start a new character and level via just Nuclear Winter?
---
Because the build on my regular character is not lending itself to the perk card setup I want for NW.
---
I got it, thx, im just worried that im selling things too low and stuff lol
---
Please elaborate on that.
---
Don’t see people using the Ultracite power armor that much to be honest. Myself I hardly use mine.
---
I just have a bunch of turrets surrounding my Brahmin so people won’t try to hurt my Paul
---
Ah okay...now i read some other guys have problems, too 
---
Should be the game/ servers...thx for your answer!
---
It's like $17 on Amazon right now.
---
Remember the final fantasy game where you could catch rare monsters and have to fight? That would be awesome!
---
T-60, the unsung hero of being the cheapest to repair.
---
Remove legendarires, not vats.
---
well they had bad durability 
---
the real problem was that the only way to make them viable back in the day was to get a explosive one and put a beamsplitter on it both effects let weapons degrade faster so they werent usable until after the patch 
---
before that they broke within two magazines ( around 60 shots) no joke
---
but now even the explosive one with a beam splitter is viable it still breaks fast but one with just the two shot effect is no problem whatsoever
---
And if you’re okay with 1* legendaries to turn in for scrip, the leader of the pack event is a guaranteed 3, 1* legendaries. One on each pack leader and it takes like 5 mins max to complete
---
I saw a sign next to someones brahmin "milk only plz"
---
Why are you the way that you are?
---
Not an option on my purifiers, it seems. Can’t use replace on workbenches, vending machines, trash cans...seems replace is only an option for objects with multiple models ( doors, walls, foundations...) 
---
Thanks for the suggestion though
---
Honestly, I think it's not worth the XP for a duplicate.  It seems to get harder to level, so if you get a lot of duplicates early on you're at a disadvantage as you don't have more perks to pick from.
---
It helps keep down the pvp players in advancer. I’ll probably try it out for the rewards.
---
You need to get them as a reward from Project Paradise; which few people do anymore and it isn’t sure to drop anyway.
---
There's is another thread about it in here somewhere, but after the NW (Patch 10) i haven't found 1 single legendary, something is broken or turned off on purpose..
---
Awesome. I am currently a level 215 and I am not going anywhere, anytime soon!!
---
You always get at least one running the Free Range event. It’s quick and easy with a couple of players (or can be solo’d even faster with a bloodied build)
---
Yeah, good call, didn't notice there were two listed. In that case, it's probably the tan paint that came with the same package.
---
Well that’s a start. Thanks!
---
Just wanted to come back and say.... You were right! I was wrong.... Devs said in a recent interview that they decided to add npcs shortly after launch. Enjoy your W! :)
---
Oh nice I’ll definitely look at getting my hands on one then
---
I agree!  Whats ur usernanme?
---
Had this walking dick with ears pull the same shit on meat Berkley. I turned around and looked at him and on mic said "Look dbag cut the shit unless you want to get turned into paste." He kept on shooting so I turned around and one shotted him with my trusty 3 star Super Sledge. He had TON of good junk on him.  
---
Yeah real good idea screwing with the guy that runs a full two handed max damage melee build when youre right next to him lol...
---
Almost every time I’ve been with a team they want to spawn in on the edge of the map and just chill. Once that happens I bail because once that fire wall gets to you it’s hard to out run. Gather supplies and move towards the middle of the map. 
---
Also had a team where they wanted to spawn in he middle of nowhere so I followed. One loot container. I got a crossbow. They all sprinted into flatwoods where there were 10 people. All got downed then yelled at me when I bailed. My crossbow and zero stimpacks aren’t going to be much help. 
---
Some teams suck.
---
I know for a fact that I sell weapons low. But I don't care , I make caps , someone get a good weapon. Still a win /win.
---
I dont think it satisfies thirst anymore...
---
i cant even load the bethesda homepage??
---
Americans call it forest fires. I have heard bush fires before
---
Yeah was very much in the same mind set as you until I actually watched one that I enjoyed. The steamer cracked me up to no end and suddenly it clicked as to why people can find watching streamers entertaining (though some are terrible at it, of course). 
---
It's pretty much a podcast if done right, made more entertaining if the visual represents a game you enjoy and topics a game you understand. 
---
Northernlion is the streamer that made me 'get it'. It took a damn long while for me to understand it too, but now I find myself watching or listening to his channel most evenings!
---
That is what I am thinking too
---
So long as you have the all the resources to recreate what you have blue printed you can build it. In regards to storing it, all that gets stored is the layout. All the physical building materials go into the stored tab, but the items you have stored start to eat into your overall build budget. 
---
When I built my bar for example because I had so many materials stored (from moving camps) I could only build the foundation before I'd hit my build limit. Ideally you dont want to have too many stored things because it reduces your build budget. 
---
It's a pain I know but it's just so people aren't running around with huge gigantic buildings all the time. I have 5 or 6 stored blueprints, but not any of those physical things stored (walls, foundations, generators etc)
---
Also, turrets and defences will take a decent sized chunk of your build budget 😉
---
He's a detective what other reason does he need to travel to WV.
---
Definitely not, I’m really enjoying nuclear winter, when is the sneak peak supposed to end?
---
I’m not qualified to make the distinction on bugs, but I certainly feel the whole NW rewards/perk system could have been explained a bit better with a quick tutorial or something.
---
Tru that, i mean i do want to get rid of em but not just throwing them away but ig its okay if its a lil low
---
I am way too low level anyway it seems. So ah well, but now I know for the future at least!
---
The learning curve can be steep, for sure. I get pew-pewed pretty quickly if my team won't/can't communicate and doesn't keep their head on a swivel.  I'm glad there is something for if not everyone, most in this update. Really looking forward to Wastelanders!
---
I've been enjoying NW way more than I thought I would. Never played a BR game before, and even though I died fairly quickly most the time, those rare occasions when I actually get a few kills under my belt is so much fun. 
---
Definitely will be playing NW exclusively until trial is over. I don't have too much time to play video games this week cause of work and life, so I'm getting the most out of it as I can!
---
you should do actually stop by and have a look in player vending machines i bought like three good legendary laser rifles and ultracite laserrifles over the last two weeks
---
only buy a ultracite laser rifle if you are willing to spend time farming ultracite every once in a while though thats a ressource that could easily limit your use of the gun
---
i usually spend a few hundred caps every once in a while if i see good offers for ultracite
---
I'm going to put my Quantum harmonizer in your photonic resonation chamber.
---
You consume a lot of food and water when you fast travel. For you is a 10 second loading, for your character is a three hours run in a hostile environment
---
The free trial of the game runs from the 10-17, so I am hoping they keep Nuclear Winter up for the same amount of time. They better give us the weekend to really get into it.
---
I honestly feel like that's the majority of players are in the same boat of wanting a shared level.
---
Skip adventure for a while. Just play NW while it's out, and you'll gain at least 10-20 levels easily, just from the XP NW gives.
---
Make sure the headset and microphone you are currently using are set as default in windows.
---
No kidding I’ll def look around then
---
nice job removing this post you idiot mods
---
good job, you protected the privacy of a hacker. im sure he'll thank you
---
I had a sloth named Speedy. He was a good boy. I even had a sign that said "No shoot sloth." One day, after logging out next to him, I logged back in and he was gone, never to be seen again. He just disappeared. I like to think he's still out there in the wasteland, but I'm still sad to this day.
---
Same here brother. I’ve been having a blast on the game, and it’s going to be the only one I play till they pull it from us.
---
Did that, even toggled it to another device and then reset it as default for both
---
Posting here since this is the top comment.  
---
I didn't delete the OP or anything in case anyone's wondering.  Even though the post itself doesn't mention anyone by name and was directed at Bethesda/the community as a warning rather than targeting the asshole in the videos (who can just create a new account anyway once they're banned) the mods decided just to delete the whole thing.
---
I'm on PC and just finally got the sack on to try it for the first time last night.  I loved it.  And I usually shy away from PvP.  I'll look you up next time I'm on, it'd be nice to have someone to die, erm, I mean, run with.
---
Maybe they don’t want the same drop location because people might choose overpopulated areas, or ones they are more familiar with while intending to join up with teammates if possible. Otherwise they might not have noticed the option to turn it off.
---
It would be a stretch, but not impossible. The NPCs in Wastelanders come from outside of Appalachia. Most probably from directly surrounding regions, but the Commonwealth or Capital Wasteland aren't that impossible.
---
No worries. I could have sworn it was an option. 
---
Hope you work it out.
---
Did you really just quote ToS to a parent sharing a video game with their kid? C'mon man.
---
I mean..... you can cosplay as him and go to random settlements saying they need yourself.....wait I just thought of a group of people who go from workshop to workshop for each event and only use black power weapons.
---
Would suggest against it unless you are playing with friends.
---
Nah, next time im posting a clip to explain
---
That’s because mods for it are hard to get especially calibrated shocks which is the most thought after mod. Also it has no jetpack mod
---
I love explosive weps. The 80% perk plus an auto grenade launcher is amazingly op. Hell with even hand tossed grens its great
---
Actually.... don’t immediately kill me please... I actually just didn’t like the game when it first came out.
---
I had great coop experience yesterday too. We reached morgantown with my friend(lvl 7). There was a place with quest that you have to send some food from machine and defend it from ghouls/robots. With 3 additional random low level players we managed to do that. Working together to find food canisters, repair broken machine and guarding every entrance. It was amazing experience and it convinced us to buy the game.
---
Hey do you still need it? I currently need it too and we could help each other PSN is AidanD369.
---
I NEED A LASER MUSKET! STAT!
---
Black powder weapons are great though. I have a 'frontiersman' character who uses all black powder weapons...a challenge but really fun. Just remember that the broadside is a black powder weapon as well!
---
No it's permanent
---
Survivalist.
---
Picking a lock on somebody else's property will get you wanted. I learned this the hard way just after launch (back then, even the labels didn't say "steal" like today). 
---
Also I warn you about Government Supply Drops you see in the wild and are also locked. Those will get you wanted as well. However, if you are on PC and near Flatwoods when this happens to you, I might just immediately clear that wanted status ;)
---
wild is over.. winter is here
---
Unless you want people just queuing and going afk cause of the absurd lobby times
---
Wow. That was unexpected.
---
Thank you.
---
In a previous camp, yes. Three of my four purifiers, all of which were locked at one point, became unlocked and I was unable to re/unlock them after that. Never found a solution, unfortunately.
---
Skogstrolcow patrol! For only 5 caps an hour!
---
“It’s a perfectly balanced and none fortnite like br” lmao
---
Absolutely correct
---
bush fires are a thing too.. depending on geography...
---
Wild Appalachia is over but you can still do it's content.
---
Does "Block for Session" show you as offline or simply put you on Do Not Disturb?
---
Hold up, you can get caps? I know you can get XP, but I haven't ever gotten caps yet
---
First BR style game/mode I've actually enjoyed. Pubg sucks, fortnite pvp wasnt my cup of tea, Apex legends was decent. This, though, is actually enjoyable to me. Was skeptical at first but gotta say they did well on this in my opinion. Can always be improved as with anything, but it's still a good start.
---
Now I’m just seeing a group of players running around with black powers weapons and someone just running behind them using the broadside.... it’s great lol
---
It isn't really in the same state anymore.
---
At all.
---
Check to make sure you have lock picking set up in your perks, I'm not 100% sure, but I thought I remembered not being able to do the same thing once. Hope it works.
---
This is a br. Fortnite is less than 30 seconds before dieing and getting into a match. Apex is about 45 seconds. You think it’s acceptable for fo76 to be 5 mins?
---
The only thing in Wild Appalachia that was limited time was the Fashnact Event.  Everything else is still here!  Most of the new content can be accessed by reading the posters in the train stations.
---
I won with 1 kill. Hiding in the bushes until it's you and another guy getting attacked by the scortchebeast seems to work.
---
Just go to your challenges and look in I believe "world" or "character" (forgot which it was). It shows what you unlocked at each level
---
you need Animal Friend for some animals and Wasteland Whisperer for others, but you don't need both for any animals. You need to be twice the animals level and for it to be a random spawn, which is super rare. The only way I manage is server hopping at a random spawn point (I usually do the one by Treetops) until there's a tame-able animal there. As for the level 30 thing, that  refers to the highest level the animal can be once you tame it. If you tame a level 50 deathclaw, it will have its level reduced to something in the 20s
---
My gf and I have tamed: 2 death claws, a yau gaui, a kitty, a sloth, a rabbit, and asnallygaster
---
People still go the polygon?
---
One foundation stairs going up add floors and walls you got a floating building.  Because physics  don't exist in fo76.
---
can't you change hud color in the .ini file? I know I changed my pip boy color
---
Yeah. But that could return at some point.
---
Where: West Tek, Generals Steak House Cravasse Dam, Huntersville, National Isolated Radio Array, Harpers Ferry
---
What: What ever gun I'm spec'd in at the moment - Gatling is a favorite, Bolt Action Pipe Rifle is another, also shotgun.  You can farm decently with any weapon as long as you have the proper build.
---
Character Names ftw!
---
Most definitely. I only play fortnite for my daughter's sake. Other than that I have deleted every br game besides this one.
---
At least on PC it is not the case...People only play it because of mods..BGS's game design is a joke
---
.
---
Their roadmap has been out and it shows free content DLC through the fall.  I bet they are going to release a new roadmap soon that has more details about the upcoming features.  They usually release an "inside the vault" every Thursday around noon.  It's often posted on reddit as well as their website.
---
No, Wild Appalachia was the collective name for all the content drops we've received over the past couple of months. It did contain a limited time event The Fastnacht Parade but that is expected to return again at some point. Where currently at the next collection of content drops called Nuclear Winter which all we know for now contains the BR mode but we should be getting more info on the rest of the content soon.
---
Your GT doesn't appear on their friend list at all in game.
---
 Make sure your XB profile is set to offline first.
---
Glad to have you onboard ...
---
As soon as you can (think 30?) get white knight ... it will save your life (and your ballistic fiber)
---
And lead and aluminum.
---
I don’t think it should just give you NW XP, but I hope they’ll include some events or something that you can do in Adventure Mode to boost your Overseer Rank and get access to the lore. I don’t even care about the cosmetics—just don’t lock story content behind something that only part of the player base will be good at. 
---
NW is fun, I like it, but I’m just not that good at it and my friends won’t touch it—so leveling up over 100 is just not realistic.
---
As a mothman cultist I prefer to follow new players around menacingly without offering any assistance whatsoever.
---
we got a full year roadmap, summer is covered in it.
---
Ok, I got it. Thanks!!
---
Well... I haven't played the game when it came out. Downloaded and started yesterday and I'm quite impressed.
---
BUT: I keep getting disconnected ALL. THE. TIME. When googling I found out that this issue started around SIX MONTHS ago. This is something that could and should have been fixed quite a while ago. It's just annoying to get disconnected and lose your progress five times per hour.
---
Not sure why people think "games need bugs"... As much as I don't understand why people keep bashing games for no reason. But come one. BETAS "need" bugs and most of them should be gone after release.
---
Still: I like being able to finally explore the world with other players. And I'm not shitting on it. Just a bit disappointed and it looks like I'm not gonna buy it after the free trial week.
---
Back in the day it had a lot of issues. From lag, disconnects, exploits and many bugs. Then stack with the unrealistic expectations people set on the game, it all leads to a flustercluck on the internet. You are witnessing the game at a waaaaayyy better state than it was before
---
Nah, all my points were correct.
---
Yes, they talked about year 2 of content at E3. The game will most likely be receiving updates at least until fallout 5, but will probably have continued (if maybe less frequent) updates after that
---
And eh, the game at launch was a mix. It was fun, but there were far more game breaking bugs. The game is much more stable now than it was back then, but it's still the same core game. The hate it got was a giant circlejerk, coming mostly from people who never played it
---
It is odd, when I do take a workshop I normally leave a few unlocked FOR people that are passing...
---
nvm, got somebody to kill me properly.
---
First thought I had lol
---
Probably some "performance" mods and some UI improvements.
---
This^. Huge fallout fan, I enjoyed the game for a time, but eventually gave up because it all felt rushed out the door. My largest complaint was that the BETA was clearly just early access in the Devs mind , when they desperately needed an actual beta. The crashes were bad, mechanics weren’t polished, the game had very little end game content. It basically felt like nobody had play tested after the main quest line. If they had, the scorch beast hate and legendary loot angst would have been immediately recognizable.
---
You’re welcome
---
If you want a joke...
---
When they nuked this post I started a new thread to complain about what "witch hunting" really is and how the mods were over reaching on the subject.  
---
To prove my point I made up a fake scenario of what actual witch hunting would look like using a made up player "SuperHackerA" being accused of cheating by someone because they one shot them in a workshop... I then received a message that I had been suspended from the sub for thirty days... for accusing a player of cheating... the player I'd just made up.  Needless to say I got the suspension removed.
---
Don't care so much about that, unless it unlocks some special things.(not going to look at the article right now)
---
Specials in NW help only for equip cards. You don't get more life point if you have more endurance and you don't get stronger melee attack with high strength
---
Yeah, likely the case. Here's hoping to a bug that is never fixed.
---
I’ve put in 300 hours. I paid $60. I’ve been playing since October. I’d say it’s paid for itself in terms of entertainment. The game in its current state is worth it.
---
As do I.
---
There should be no duplicates in br mode. There are no splitting or variations of cards. Tbh i would make BR cards have NO RNG but come from overseer level rewards (not packs but specific cards awarded per level)
---
It would be cool if they do something similar for the Fourth of July.
---
I agree.  I've been playing it since release ( but not beta ) and absolutely love it.  However, I do play it as a single player game and rarely play with others.  In fact, I still actively avoid other players due to some early problems with 'griefers'.  I think that issue is pretty much fixed now though.
---
Noobmaster69
---
everyone in the comments saying it was just a hate train is wrong.  the game at launch WAS NOT THIS GAME.  it has improved immensely.  much of the criticism at launch was warranted.  they persevered and now the game is what it should have been at launch.
---
Did I really tell someone not to break the rules laid out by Bethesda? Yes I did.
---
My boyfriends son also plays with us from time to time, and he has his own account under his own profile. This was not at all difficult to do.
---
Same. Though I appeared to be lucky enough to avoid most of the issue some people were reporting.
---
It is an interesting diversion.  I don't love it, but it's different and fun.  Sometimes you need a break from adventuring.
---
It'll come back. it's just a preview of what's to come
---
Hehe...I understand
---
I think it’s a really cool concept personally. I also really enjoy the story of fallout so I just enjoy going out and scavenging things for my camp. Eventually I’ll dabble in pvp but I’m a confused deer at the moment lol.
---
And also from my understanding your progress will still save
---
With levels intact?
---
Why would anyone do that? Bypass the cap limitation?
---
What are those things?
---
Don’t @ me but a majority of issues arose from assholes duplicating items and massively overloading servers. Yes, there were bugs and odd things, but it was always ‘fun’. At a certain point, it got boring, but they’ve been introducing different things to help that recently.
---
I'm going to have to take time to do this tonight too... maybe I'll just redecorate the whole thing and make it a project so I feel like it's a worthwhile use of my time. I'm at around 21k anyway and with all the new players good vending machines are more scarce so... accentuate the positive
---
Oh sweet thanks for the info
---
I was thinking the same thing. Like the One Violent Night event when it says “sons of dane compound alert” or somethin like that.
---
But that doesn’t answer his question. The scorch beast can attack both targets since its flying... less specific example is someone is in an elevated position (roof/building) while other team is on the ground.
---
I actually don't watch either, so I'm not sure what you're basing your conjecture on. I support Trump, I'm not ashamed in this. I can support him and act like a normal human, you - however - can't seem to handle yourself.
---
And plastic for all of your bundling needs!
---
You'll thank me when your stash is overflowing but you can't just throw away that 1000 steel.  Now you can sell it!
---
Player Unknown's Battlegrounds costs $30, got millions of players on it's peak period but it probably has a worse microtransaction model than FO76.
---
Fallout 76 probably will be priced the same when it hits Steam and would have significant improvements on both Adventure and Nuclear Winter.
---
thats a nice loop from the vault down to overseers and into flatwoods &gt; vault tech agri
---
Im lvl 71 and I still run it from time to time when I get low on mats...
---
The first time didn't bug me so much. I kind of laughed and said I needed to redo them anyway.
---
It's pretty interesting to me that some people get bugs and some dont, I haven't had any in 12 hours of game time.
---
Good I can stop that awkward situation I have with Rose.
---
Oh hi dad.
---
(44 year old me).
---
Steve's gonna Steve what can I say ;)
---
I've only ran into it once after checking the chair in adventure and coming back to NW felt like the first fight took place in adventure I was shooting but didn't register damage until they shot back thought lag but bud said he thought it happened to him...
---
Right? It takes forever 😂😂😭😭
---
Text chat won’t fix stupid
---
Nope, it was completely right to shit on the game at launch.. how the game is now should have been what was released at launch. Release a full game, not a half finished buggy mess and patch it up once the majority of the player base is gone
---
Literally I just got back into the game this week, Lv22 and I won two games of NW last night, I'd don't really play BR games but this has been so fun!
---
Just pointing out aside from the horseman skins Raider PA has NO skins.
---
Challenges used to always be like this though, early on you'd usually see challenges as simple as "Scrap a toy car" or "Kill 10 Super Mutants" but for god knows what reason instead of finding a way to scale challenges to match player level Bethesda decided to ramp things up across the board.
---
It would be nice if this were a permanent shift, but i doubt it will stick along for much longer than the free week.
---
Thanks, I wasn't aware of that. So everyone has the same basic attributes Strength, Agility etc?
---
it would be a waste of 20 bucks if you didnt so, yeah its worth it.
---
its been a great break from what was an endless grind for scout badges and legendaries for me.
---
Not the guy that said it but I take it as there is no campy shit in it. No gimmicks. It stays grounded in the Fallout universe.
---
Sounds like your internet connection is the problem...
---
You mentioned your PC so I’m not sure if you can configure your NAT at all but your ISP might be throttling your bandwidth 
---
I’m on XB1 and have played at least 30 matches by now without any disconnection - all from a hotel w/ slow internet speeds
---
White knight is a perk. 
---
ballistic fibre is a material you need to craft and repair certain armours.
---
All stuff you'll figure out on your own... let's refer to the post to which you responded as "unnecessary info" at this point. 
---
I'm glad you like it, though. It's a super fun game.
---
Yeah that would be really great. Many times you die fairly fast as several groups spawn into same place, so it would make getting a new game much faster.
---
Damn good luck man
---
Hopefully we’ll hear about the new summer roadmap next week then. I want to know when Nuclear Winter will be here to stay.
---
Yup. Over time, it's slowly redeemed itself by fixing issues and adding more context and so much more, and now Fallout: Brotherhood Of Steel is the worst Fallout game again.
---
That's what I was thinking.  It'll be back to the usual madness next week.  I really hope not, but I'm not getting my hopes up too high they'll stay this way.
---
Well, it's RNG. I think IM overseer rank 10 and got aquaboy twice.
---
This is my go to strategy, though i have managed a couple of kills. One time I found a Chameleon Serum. I should’ve just hidden my way into the final circle and stood still, but instead became drunk with power and decided it made me an immortal sniper. 
---
Turns out, not so much.
---
I'm in the same boat, started playing at the first BETA and I was really excited but the game didn't run on my PC, even on low settings. I figured Fallout 4 worked so this would work too right? There's no reason I can run GTA 5, the Witcher 3, but not FO76.
---
So I gave up after about 3 BETA sessions because it just wasn't happening, I was lagging and freezing, everything looked low poly and awful so I just set it down hoping maybe I'd get a better computer and come back if they add anything.
---
A few months pass and people are rampantly shitting on the game, so I think, hey guess I dodged a bullet despite not getting my money back.
---
After I heard Wild Appalachia was a thing and saw the roadmap I thought, hey, why not try it out right? Maybe it will work now lmao.
---
Shockingly, it did, on ultra and now I've read into all the drama and seen that most of it is clickbait blown out of proportion, and I've been having a lot of fun these past 3-4 weeks.
---
what a sad, sad little mod. so eager to use their powers they can't take the time to fully read and comprehend a post
---
these fools should realize that they are potentially decreasing Bethesda's awareness of the seriousness of the issue and how widespread it is. but if they thought things through that much they wouldn't have taken the actions they have today
---
I imagine they are taking this stance because they want to protect this subreddits reputation as being friendly towards Bethesda but if the goodwill of the community is forced and not genuine there is no point to being here
---
This is how it should have launched and avoided most of its bad press
---
My quad something something broadside (why will it not let me type broadside\*r\* darnit) is a lot of fun...can't wait to try it with the updates to explosive weapons...with the multishot cannister it should be pretty scary now.
---
A group running around in Union outfits and caps (though cowboy hat works well with the outfit as well), with black powder weapons (with the crazy bayonets) and broadside\*r\* support would be awesome...must work towards that now.
---
I was hoping they'd show the roadmap for Nuclear Winter. Guess I hyped myself up too much.
---
Got a 9 luck Bloody Mess earlier
---
Really? I find the opposite to be true. The first 20 levels go by super fast just camping events, and earning epic loot. Then XP gain starts to suck till like 35, only to pick up again after.
---
Did they ever say they would take it away?
---
I’d say plastic, glass, and leather for bulking. Adhesive, lead, screws, oil, gears, aluminum, springs for personal economy. Silver, gold, fiberglass, asbestos, circuitry, and antiseptic for non-bulk sales. Keep your nuclear waste, it’s annoying to farm sometimes. Not sure what I missed. Steel if you use a lot of ammo, but it gets heavy fast!
---
What platform are playing on?
---
Fully with this comment right here.
---
I dont play many Battle Royales but dammit if NW isnt addicting. For the people who don't like pvp maybe putting the Vault and lore in Adventure mode would be cool.
---
Whys that?
---
A lot of people will say that it early on people were just salty. 
---
However, while fun, at launch the game had a lot of quality of life issues and bugs. The game is much more fun now that a lot of hard work by the devs has fixed a lot. 
---
Issues with bugs, stash too small, pvp issues, overpowered the, duping, etc.
---
No downvotes for that homie. Not liking is fair. Our gripe is the people who go on about old issues like nothing has improved. YouTubers who know pissing on the game gets more views than a thought out opinion so they continue to trash it with no idea what’s going on.
---
Yeah, but you're the minority in terms of the gaming population.  Majority of the population thinks this is a very subpar game for $59.99.
---
Yeah. Pretty under whelming inside the vault this week.
---
Poster at train station if u haven't read it yet. Then takes u to frat house in Morgantown
---
I agree. Fishing in WoW was my goto relaxing activity in Vanilla/TBC. But to make in not too relaxing, there could be a chance to catch something more dangerous. Like and angry Mirelurk.
---
Speaking or Mirelurks and fishing, a whole water-themed content update would be nice. I love the flowing rivers of the Forest region, but there's not much to it. Besides fishing, there could be new water-based resources. Watermill-like generators for rivers. Plantable water flora (tarberry). What about some Nuka-lurks around the Nuka Plant? Biv could give us a quest to hunt for a mysterious Beer-lurk. New CAMP structures, like pier/dock set for floors, walls, roofs...
---
Go to any train station on the map and you'll see some posters on the wall. The nukashine quest is started by reading the poster advertising a fraternity party.
---
Everyone expected bugs. Nobody expected the sheer number or intensity of them at launch. That was the problem.
---
It could have been much better if Todd gave a fuck.
---
"You are the cancer of this community" writes a walking, talking brain tumor who claims to be a "true fan".  Fuck 'em.
---
I've loved the SB. I can't aim other players, but that thing has helped me to win by killing the other remaining players.
---
been begging for this.
---
You have to either find a poster around the map that advertises a party or go to fraternity row. On the map and enter the house to explore a bit which should start the quest
---
Kids may not get the reference
---
the game-saving "Unofficial Fallout 76 Patch"
---
It’s not witch hunting when they actually are guilty.
---
Because when it came out it was a complete broken mess. Countless patches have turned it around, which is fine, but those who of us who suffered from the beta onward had a rough time.
---
no fallout 76 for us then i guess
---
edit: lucky i didnt bought it
---
Everyone has the same base life points, stamina and action point regardless special and level in adventure.
---
However Special matters as you need them to equip NW cards (for example frog leg is 9 agility point) that can modify your base stat (for example there is a card that raise your life point)
---
Well said and spot on.
---
Visit a train station that has the posters in it, look for the one about the frat party. Some player camps might have them up, but a train station is your best bet. Also check the posters for the pioneer scouts quests and Sheepsquatch.
---
Like its true but your gonna get downvoted to oblivion.
---
I will too just for responding to you, but you deserve some solidarity for speaking the truth hahaha
---
Those are perks that you can unlock, the "white knight" makes it cheaper to repair armor and makes armor deteriorate much slower. Ballistic fibre is a material commonly used to repair armor that is lvl 25+, and it is very difficult to find compared to many other materials.
---
for a look into what other perks there are, you can check here: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
I don’t have a picture but I can describe them:
---
They’re a dark tan color as a base with yellow accent colors, specifically on the arms and joints of the armor. It’s actually quite nice, I prefer it over the Blue and Yellow
---
Go to a train station and look around inside for some posters, interacting with them should start you on the quest for nuka shine, the camping one, and the arktos one. At least that is how I did it.
---
I was using it yesterday. Works better than water
---
Same here. I’d say it won’t be too much longer though. I’m going to stay hopeful for next week.
---
\^ yes please fill out a ticket and follow up with me with the ticket number.
---
Go to any train station and read the posters. Then go to Morgantown and look for a new location on Frat Row. There’s a new frat house open.
---
Yeah I have a healthy friends list but for trades only. None of my friends play FO76.
---
For what armor?
---
Oh damn I was wondering what the hell was coming in lol.
---

My assumption is just that, bypass max caps.  Because you could drink the cola and get a cap back.  Early on, you would see people advertise items on the market place for 20k nuka colas n shit.
---
Sweet man thanks!

Cait was absolutely filthy, but I married Piper

I thinkyou need to learn waht the word Defraud means, nothing they did was illegal. They messed up a launch like most games as a service do and they are trying to fix it
---
A lot of us hate pvp and especially BR. I'm thrilled to have been proven wrong, but the concern was justified at the time. I don't think any of us expected it to be this fun and especially not this stable.
---
Rest in Piece, brave Wastelander.
---
You're deeds will be remembered.
---
(On Ps4 and at work)
---
GL man.
---
Mod/Private servers won't likely be added until after Wastelanders. Also, I play on console so I doubt I'll have access to the majority of mods. With all tht being said I'm looking forward to;
---
* Pitboy lamp color
---
* menu color options
---
* radio options
---
* gun mounts in camp
---
* new camp items
---
But the biggest thing I'm looking forward to is... New FAN MADE QUESTS AND STORIES. Like the whole fallout Miami or any of the cool longer quest made in FO4 I would love to play in 76. And honestly, because we know they aren't making a fallout game anytime soon its the only way we will get some single player fallout games. I would pay atoms, money, subscribe whatever to get a nice private server with a short single-player story made by a fan.
---
No need to be rude geez. You ask a question and didn’t specify that you also left the vault and still didn’t save. We’re just trying to help here. 🥺
---
You can thank the E3 hype train Bethesda always puts out and people eat up.
---
&gt; June 18th roles around
---
Rolls, like in Royce.
---
F
---
Because no npc’s /s
---
Well worth it my friend.
---
Yeah except you'd be able to choose which ones you want to be alerted for.
---
Your 2 biggest issues you posted about the game dont have anything to do with the game though. That's not a circlejerk, or forgiving a company for problems, it's just that most people dont care about canvas bags or video game branded rum.  You're looking at that way wrong
---
Any chance you have textures on 'high'? Game wants at least 5GB of VRAM on that setting or will stutter when swapping textures more than most games when you go beyond the available VRAM your GPU has.
---
&gt;So many people seem to think whatever form it ships out should be perfect and permanent.
---
Uh... no. Some people think the game should be playable at launch, which this game wasn't.
---
There are always exceptions to the rule. PUBG is one of them.
---
Having said that, I bought it for $5.99 from Kinguin and only played it for a few weeks.
---
Fortnite costs nothing.
---
Apex Legends costs nothing.
---
Realm Royale costs nothing. 
---
I could go on and on.
---
Free will always beat paid for a lot of people, even if the paid version is superior (as is the case with Fallout 76).
---
If I recall correctly it starts with clicking on the Frat Party poster.   It was available for free from the atomic shop but I am not sure if its there still.   Get the poster, click, and you are off.   Failing that you have to find the posters in world.   They were at train stations and I am guessing you can find one near fraternity row in Morgantown.
---
PM sent
---
&gt;Companion NPCs will be able to live in your C.A.M.P., while also offering you quests.  
---
&gt;They will not be able to follow you around like previous Fallout games.
---
Ooh. Can I get my newfound wife to make me a sandwich when I come home from a day of exploring and scavenging?
---
every game has to have bugs because when you fix one thing another wilkl always break. It's not a case of tjhey just didn;t fix it, it's that they have to account for so many variables that a simple fix isn;t possible
---
So I can only equip a maximum of seven cards at a time (one per Special Category) and only if I have enough Special points invested in that category? Sorry if this is a stupid question, but I am quite stupid.
---
Let me help you with that
---
Kill all the scorched and ghouls you can find too. Many of them carry radaway also.
---
Man.. being a game dev must suck.
---
Even with the dropping of the bombs, not everyone died. Take the responders and their counterparts from Fallout 76, or the children in little lamplight. It is possible Pre-war Nick found shelter somewhere, and being roughly 30-40 years old when the bombs dropped would make him fairly able in the wasteland. It's not particularly likely he's alive but it's not impossible
---
My only current concern is the perk cards. Past level 20 a duplicate card becomes really damaging to progression since they’re so much rarer after completing challenges and leveling.
---
Long term, I hope BGS is quick to add new maps, as it keeps each match feeling fresh.
---
So you can hide in deep water without a snorkel. Smart.
---
Afk
---
and drunk on Nukashine and the picture must be taken exactly at the moment before blackout
---
Do we know if NW beta ends the 17h to come back later? Or if it stay as beta until the definitive version is releashed?
---
I actually hate farming springs, maybe when we get some true high end content I'll choose another PA to maximize DPS. I'm a lore monger, T-60 is perfect for farming and exploring with some mods.
---
&gt;Well , like many things tested in labs, once you release it into the wild, and it gets used by players and machines that cannot be replicated in the office environment, 
---
Todd said it in a recent interview: they should have let the game bake longer, letting it be played online 24/7 for several months.  That is the only way you can really see what needs to be fixed.
---
50 hours and it isn't worth $60 that just over $1 an hour a movie is around $25 for 2-3 hours
---
I sit myself down at the handily placed bench.
---
Naw man they missed out.
---
Oh I was confused, I thought this was Fallout 76 and not frogger or pac man. 
---
I clearly should have been going into this expecting to play frogger or pac man. My mistake.
---
Oh and don't blindly trust your team if you do auto-fill, they can just watch you die and take your stuff...
---
The part I am waiting for is for people to hop over to adventure mode and create some blueprints of 1 foundation block Port-A-Fort's and start dropping them and using them for portable cover and advantage in Nuclear Winter.
---
That will make the game insane.
---
I agree it maintains most of the mechanics of fallout but I wouldn’t call this adult like pubg or anything. Someone with frog legs jumping around launching grenades and people ploping down a small fort isn’t “adult” to me lmao
---
Looks like someone didn't grow up in the 70s/80s with constant fears of Nuclear Winter (and the definition of said) being shoved down his or her throat.
---
I agree with both sides. I played from the jump and it was really challenging and frustrating. I agree it was extremely buggy and the server stability was horrible, I would get 10-15 minutes of gameplay before being booted.  
---
However, I do think a lot of the hate was also bandwagon hate. I'd see people log in, crash once, and never play again but then harp on about how awful it was everywhere they could. Even now, with all of the improvements and changes Bethesda has made, people still trash it because they held on to it for this long and don't want to change their position.
---
It's because everyone hates Gamefreak now
---
Yes, you get XP. You just need to create a character, get out of Vault 76 and then log out and into Nuclear Winter with that character. This would get XP and stuff for the new character.  
---
I'm actually thinking of doing this just to see how it goes...my spec in Adventure is a snipey character, so it...is a tid bit annoying in Nuclear Winter. At least I had 6 points in Strength.
---
The game had multiple flaws at launch, many gamebreaking bugs and pretty much every single fallout 4 bug was included in 76 at the point of its launch.
---
The game had a bunch of gamebreaking issues that went unpatched for months which caused people to sour when they couldnt use their favorite weapons for more than 5 minutes without being forced to relog due to the damage glitch triggering so you couldnt kill enemies anymore since you did 0 damage. More of that below
---
The game also had weekly "scandals" for several months after it launched, be it 60~ peoples support tickets leaking out, canvas bags, how they handle certain bugs/glitches, etc. Add week2/black friday game sales which caused quite the outrage aswell (for some reason?). You also have the Nuka rum, etc. list goes on
---
The issue wasnt that the game got alot of uneccessary hate at its launch, the issue was that the game was launched in a terrible state to be frank. As much as i loved this game since day 1 it was kind of a similar love that you have for your first rundown and broken car, it barely runs and its barely holding together, but you still love it because every time it works it just makes you smile.
---
The game has been patched up and improved by boatloads compared to launch, which is mostly why people ask "why did the game get all the hate at launch?" as loads of people have mentioned, of course people jump on a hate train as soon as one leaves the trainstation, the issue with Fallout 76 was that most of the negative points about the actual game was valid. Most of the bad PR and "hating" came from said weekly scandals, which was also a thing they deserved criticism for.
---
i currently have over 1400+ hours in the game, i love it, but dear lord did it have its issues at launch and it took more than half a year to get it into a playable state in most cases. Just to give a small rundown below to bring up a few examples of the bugs it had:
---
Damage cap - This bug triggered when you did too much damage within a servertick, causing it to return negative values, making you do damage but the mobs instantly healing it back since the server flat out rejects your damage. This bug was around for months and triggered as often as you hit mobs, sometimes all you had to do was shoot one mob and bam, you had to serverhop to fix it. 
---
Power armor frame glitch - Caused you to absorb powerarmor frames and be unable to exit them, this bug was also in fo4 and could be fixed via console commands, in 76's case around half of the people who ended up with the bug could cheat their way out of it by doing certain time demanding things to empty their fusion cores and such, others didnt have that luck.
---
Map glitch - This glitch is currently STILL in the game and sofar is unfixable. It can trigger if you open more than 15 maps per server, this breaks your character permanently, you cant repair, fix, unequip stuff, trade with people, etc. it permabreaks your character but leaves it accessible so you can watch it slowly be grinded to dust. /dramatic posture
---
These are only 3 of the "worst" and most easily triggered ones, the damage cap bug is still in the game, it just doesnt happen as much. Add the good ol' list of bugs from fo4 and a few duping ones that originated in 76 aswell and having duping running rampant for 6 months post launch and it leaves a sour aftertaste in alot of peoples mouth.
---
And i forgot to mention the biggest issue of all; the game lacks any sort of endgame except for one boss fight in the form of the Scorchbeast Queen which was nearly undoable due to servers crashing when you launched nukes, when the nukes splashed down or when 15+ people fought her at the same time causing the server to crash.
---
The game has come a LONG way from then, but it's also important to remember where it came from and how we got here. Bethesda also didnt have changelogs for patches until it was requested heavily by the playerbase.
---
Energy heavies still break faster than their ballistic counterparts. Energy heavys also don’t benefit from armor penetration perks as well.  Lastly, more personal is I use grounded mutation for the 100ER and that lowers energy gun damage by 12%.  The king of heavy DPS is the LMG.
---
Hopefully you at least sent the mods the unedited version. I had someone literally tell me to never argue with them on the sub again or they'd kill me. Dude was banned immediately
---
A “Nuclear Winter” is basically supposed to begin with large firestorms following a nuclear war. The theory is that the soot in the air from the fires will block out the sun and thus begin a major cooling event. Seems like this is just the beginning.
---
It's not letting me om you the link :/
---
That's a lovely thing to do for new players :)
---
Never in my life would I ever thought BR and fallout would actually work as a life long fallout fan it has some issues but works very well GJ!
---
Get ready for F3 characters to show up! (Or their predecessors)
---
&gt;not a half finished buggy mess and patch it up once the majority of the player base is gone
---
Yeah this became a big problem when gaming systems became connected to the internet. I'm old enough to remember when gaming machines weren't connected to the internet.  
---
Back then, games had to work at launch. 
---
Period. 
---
Thanks to the net, it's release today, patch tomorrow.
---
I explore around and check vendors
---
😊
---
Oh shit! I gotta do that, that would make it a lot more fun!
---
For easy ammo get a good gatling laser. They just use fusion cores. If you get the perk that makes power cores last longer that applies to the gatling laser. The max level makes each clip 1000 rounds. And power cores are easy to get from power plant extractors.
---
actually we are praising them for listening to the community and releasng npcs etc to the game which they had no plans to ever at launch. (and don;t say they should have been in anyway, because that was never the design plan). The community asked for it and a choice based story and they are adding it for free. The shit they got for the bugs and the state of launch is acceptable, giving them shit for turning the game around and making it worth the money is just stupid
---
I wasn't bashing Fortnite, it's the only other BR I've played.
---
and then drink another nukashine to return to the place and take another picture with the same people and creatures
---
It's still unknown after 5 months
---
So they are all going to be Preston Garvey
---
yes you get adventure exp for playing winter..
---
I do not know the math on if its better than grinding on some mobs for a while..
---
Such snark for someone who already expected to play a game that Fallout 76 clearly isn't, and was never advertised as.  Don't get snooty with me, sister.  You might as well have expected it to be Pac Man or Frogger if you expected it to be F3, F4, FNV, or whatever you had in your head even though all of the advertising and press for it clearly said it was not going to be that way.
---
Couldn't agree more. It deserves the backlash it got at launch just as much as it deserves whatever praise it gets now for  getting fixed.
---
We ran into a visual glitch last night. One of my squads world didn't load. No trees bushes houses etc. He also could not see any creature mobs not interact with anything or shoot anything. Only thing is, he could see other players. So he became our spotter for the whole game, calling out player locations.
---
No, you'll have to start over.
---
You are correct pacifist mode makes it so you cant kill tamed animals. I unloaded on a guys pet deathclaw and he freaked, only to realize I dont do damage. Confused me at first until I was being bashed from behind lol. After we danced with his deathclaw named Bubbles.
---
Mostly it was a mixture of Toxic Fanboys / youtuber band wagons / little to no understanding of mmo's by a lot of people who had never played one and some actually pretty serious bugs in the game that have since been mostly fixed all snowballing into a perfect storm of WTF is wrong with you people.....
---
I normally get top 10-20 (in terms of players not teams) but even that you don’t get too much xp
---
Flamer counts as energy still?
---
I would love to be able to pick a drop spot at any point during the lobby period. Why do we have to wait until everyone is loaded in?
---
Buliding is insanely useful. Having knowledge of the build UI and having blueprinted defences can be the difference between winning and losing.
---
FUCK YEAH MORE XP
---
I already play with at least 2 mods, and I can't imagine playing without:  
---
* Perk Loadout Manager, to change my perks in 2 seconds.  
---
* Some UI mod that adds icons and sort items.  
---
I hope I see both of them merged with the game in some way, because they're amazing and deserve to be coregame.
---
Not full price. Never full price. But if you catch it on sale (its $30 USD as of right now), its a good time killer if you get bored.
---
Noticed that the past few days and this weekly also. I hope we see more of the same from here on out.
---
I expected to play a Fallout game. But like you said I should be expecting something completely different like Frogger or Pacman. That's my mistake. I'm sorry to have put you through this great turmoil in hearing someone doesnt enjoy your Fallout: Frogger experience. This game that you apparently had a lot of deal in developing or something since you're so taken aback by the criticism.
---
10 bucks on Gamefly dude I spend more on a pack of smokes then I did on this game.  Easy buy.
---
If anyone else finds this post and has this issue, at the time of this comment having your master volume or chat volume at anything but max it cuts out the chat audio for me. Maxing those in game solved my issues
---
&gt;This game has no connection to the prequel!
---
or
---
&gt;this game is exactly like the prequel!
---
You can't win.
---
Remember when *DEMO'S* were given out for free inside Gamepro Magazine and were more polished than the "AAA" titles being released today?
---
Pepperidge Farms remembers.
---
Ambition is not an excuse for releasing an unfinished product.
---
Keep the momentum going by continuing to push out cool content to us and we’ll keep playing!
---
It was more of a generalized statement or I would’ve referred to you directly, I should’ve just said fortnite was what most people compare NW to.
---
Wait, you can solo queue?
---
Damn does Daddy Todd have a tasty dick or something? People are sucking him off as hard as Reeves or Musk at this point.
---
Shouldn't be that bad I have a friend in London and the game run fine.
---
Hopefully gold will be more useful by the time they put that out, I rarely ever use it.
---
I’m hoping for weather and seasons and fireplaces and snow ones and ice cream and fireworks and pumpkins and costumes and greenhouses and planters and robots and pets and and and...
---
Kind of like rad storms, some type of natural events around the map.
---
How do you build in Nuclear Winter?
---
Yes! It will be a new PvP mode. Team freeze-tag Fallout style.
---
Except it couldn't have, unless it was an open beta for the same time it's been out.
---
Sure, they're definitely a bunch of bugs that they could have caught ahead of time. But some stuff only shows up when you've got half a million people hopping on the servers at once. That's not even a server load thing so much as just a numbers thing. If a bug has a one in one-thousand chance of showing up it looks like it happens a lot when you've got a very large number of people and is completely missed by a small testing group.
---
but a lot of where this game currently is is a result of them listening to feedback and making changes. Without the feedback this game would not be where it is.
---
I'm not going to pretend that the launch couldn't have been better, but to say that it could ever have launched at the state it's currently in is a ridiculous expectation because this is a game that is the result of the community talking and the developer listening.
---
Fuel is under Energy Ammo in the chem bench, so it seems like it
---
Complete the event means watch it til the end. At least that's how it credited on the pc.
---
The game isn't bad. It wasn't traditional Fallout with NPCs and role-playing. It could feel pretty lonely at times, and the potential competition against other players soured people who were more part of the role-playing crowd.
---
The game had some miffing bugs on release. The one that ultimately got me to take a break from the game was that I just started to randomly take severe damage in sessions, killing me until I relogged. I respawned at a camp by myself and that didn't resolve it. When I'd get the bug I'd have to totally drop server.
---
It's not the best game I've played in a rolling 12 month period, honestly. That probably goes to Spider Man or Assassin's Creed Odyssey, both of which I found to be just fun with the kind of polish you only get from single player experiences. It's not the worst game I've played in that time either. That was Anthem. That people on Anthem communities go "At least this isn't 76!" is confusing to me. 76 had more to do at launch than Anthem, and unlike Anthem, is actually improving.
---
76 wasn't great or awful. It is a decent game with some issues and room for improvement, and for what it is, is fun.
---
👍
---
Yeah, I don't care for it either.  But if it helps keep the game alive and they don't lose focus on the single player experience in the long run, I don't have a problem with it existing.  Glad people are having fun with it.
---
No. Too many reminders of Hardcore Diablo 2
---
It's not like Beth has set traps for cheaters before or anything.....oh wait....
---
I don't see why they wouldn't keep supporting the game indefinitely if it keeps/starts turning a profit. I've played the game most days since the Beta and I still keep finding things to do in the base game let alone the extra content. And who knows, if the Atom Shop started selling some decent gear (as opposed to giant heads and clown outfits) I might even part with some hard cash.
---
hardcore survival servers.. that kick you into regular survival &amp; adventure when you die..
---
new toon required..
---
10 characters.
---
Found kotaku's account
---
It's definitely the one of the few loops I use pharma &amp; scrounger on instead of better cards - I just hit 113 &amp; still do it at least once a weak...  I think not scrapping anything at level 5, and instead selling it all, broke something inside of me.
---
It was never as bad as the hate bandwagon suggested.
---
Because it's coming out after Battlefield 5's Firestorm.
---
But remember you had actively search containers! It’s not a passive!
---
How is the content?
---
You can equip a maximum of seven cards but there's no need they are in different special categories, this is a thing that tricked many players. You need however enough special points to equip multiple cards, like in adventure.
---
If you have 15 strenght you can equip for example 3 cards that cost 5+6+4. Then you can choose other 4 cards for the remaining special attributes
---
That's a damn good idea...
---

---
...result from the prolonged blockage of sunlight by high-altitude dust clouds produced by nuclear explosions.
---
66 yr old and I’ve got 600+ hours in. I’m also not the oldest I’ve come across in the game!
---
Huh?
---
Just something’s been complained about for years that they can’t be bothered to take the ten seconds to delete 🤷‍♂️
---
Its free this week.
---
Give it a shot and see for yourself.
---
Oh!  Oh, help me!  I'm taken aback!  I'm in turmoil!  Chauncy, fetch my fainting chair!  I do believe I have the vapors.
---
You have a lot of weird ideas about how things are.
---
Fallout is the only game i have issues with. I pretty much only play online multiplayer games
---
This would go against the narrative they have for the game mode though so I doubt they'll do it. 
---
There can only be one Overseer.
---
I played it since January. It was not very good at release. As expected from Bugthesda. But all the scale of negative feedback was extremely exaggerated!
---
Two words- Gatling Gun. Decent DPS and the ammo consumption and repair rate can’t be beat.
---
Nope.. it's too easy to die in this game (without end-game top tier gear), especially from stupid quirks or clunky controls.
---
I don’t see a single thing wrong with it.  It’s meant to last an average of 20 minutes.  It’s not god roll time, it’s skill time.  And you use your skills to win.
---
I think they meant to not charge for the addition of NW, not to make the whole game free. That's how I read it anyway.
---
In the first roadmap the main photo used for wastelanders also had gold over flowing out of a vault and a character running out of it with a money bag. So something is definitely up with gold.
---
It ends for the week as a sneak peek and will return in launch this summer.
---
In the enclave bunker modus sells them
---
MODUS Command Center. possibly player vendors
---
Holy shit it's the bags.
---
That's a good question...PvP is also beta, but they never took it out...I wonder if NW will stay, but the free week will go...I cant wrap my head around releasing somthing everyone likes, Nd taking it down until further notice...maintenance only...just my thoughts.
---
How is the xp rate in NW?
---
You buy the mods from the Enclave bunker. The armoury sells the single use mods but the production section sells the actual plans for each mod.
---
Otherwise you could check player vendors, you never know what you can find there.
---
The Institute made 59 clone synths of him, though.  Now he's a 60 Minuteman.
---
i did exactly this...made a new character to play in NW on monday and havent done anything but play NW with that character. currently at level 10 with an overseer rank of 14. so its possible to level up without doing anything in adventure mode. 
---
i think theres a slight advantage for higher level players coming over to NW compared to same overseer level but lower adventure level. but only if you manage to RNG good perks from packs in NW. youre limited in that you can only ever equip 7 cards in NW but some of those 6+ point cards are nice and you could luck out and roll one early on.
---
I don't feel like getting into an argument about game mechanics with folks around here. Lurking in this circlejerk is irritating enough as it is. Those are just two of the clearest examples of why people really shouldn't be praising the company or their product. If you'll dismiss that, it doesn't matter how accurate or fair any criticisms about the game are, y'all are just on it's nuts at that point.
---
The fact that you're even arguing with me about how crappy their false advertising and other dishonest practices are just exemplifies what a circlejerk this sub is.
---
its good because its populated with tons of useful things for noobs exiting the vault.. 
---
swap in all the scrounging/crafting perks and go to town
---
30 minutes can net quite a haul if you hit all the spots
---
Yes, a station of nothing but Ring of Fire
---
The holy desk fan and type writer, also lead
---
Thanks. That's really useful.
---
Without being a grammar nazi I just give you an example:  
---
Fixing your typos (i.e. 'wilkl') won't cause another typo, wouldn't it?
---
Saying that games have to have bugs is just not true. There will be bugs, yes. But this disconnection bug exists for six months now and hasn't been fixed. I think this one is quite crucial. And I don't think the game HAS TO HAVE this bug
---
Believe it or not, Todd wasn't lying at E3. It's had some big updates and fixes, it's fun!
---
Contrary to all these comments, it wasn't just the hate train. Firstly many people were upset that the game was not optimised correctly and even if you have the best build, frame drops would occur. Along with this a lot of people at launch did not like the new perk system as they feared it would turn into a pay to win kind of thing with the packs while also it not being fallout-y enough. The game was riddled with bugs and didn't even have human npcs, along with countless other grievances many thought it was a downgrade from Fallout 4 which already is on the lower spectrum of Fallout games
---
That thing has caused me to lose so many times
---
Can't you trade your dublicate cards for Xp??
---
lol ok sure
---
There's a 9 point Goat Legs card that is fantastic.  Running from fire/enemies on the bridge or cliff?  Jump off :)
---
There's also a Frog Legs card that gives you high jump, not sure the points on it.
---
Enclave Military Terminal for random mods (good luck!). And Production Terminal for the actual plans! ;)
---
Not a single bug or glitch? 
---
In my last match alone I found multiple, names and health bars staying on screen while the person was gone, walking up the side of a camp wall, hoping out of power armor while reviving, the lag spike when I switched weapons mid fight
---
Austin and apparently a lot of folks from the Dallas studio. Not sure how big that one is though.
---
I prefer ballistic for the armor pen, as was mentioned in another comment here. I also don’t like double-dipping into my fusion core pile for ammo. :)
---
My favorite is the .50 cal, but I think most heavies prefer the Gatling gun for ballistic weapons. It’s certainly the easiest to keep in ammo, since it goes through it much more slowly. The LMG is a beast but it’s hard to keep enough ammo for unless you make gathering/crafting it a serious part of your gameplay.
---
Also, there’s a bug right now with the weapons that ‘spin up’ like mini guns where they don’t always actually fire after they spin up if you’re looking down the sights, so just be aware of that.
---
At last. An excuse to wear my Prospectors Hat.
---
Yes. A friend (who's a programmer) pointed out that it's impossible to write perfect code because of all the different hardware etc. Also location is quite important I guess. At least for the disconnection issue
---
People post this same exact thread every day.  More than once.
---
The only real answer is "How are we supposed to know if it's worth it to you?"  You're the only one who can answer that question.
---
If you already downloaded the trial, why ask us? Play it.  See what you think.
---
That "some reason" is the mods doing an incredibly sloppy job of trying to keep this all quiet for some reason.  Hell they deleted my whole post and video links yet left this thread up with comments full of even more videos, some of the same exact guy.
---
It just proves that one can’t always listen to the “reviews” when 99% of them where from people that didn’t even play and others like YouTubers did the hate train for clicks. 
---
Welcome to Appalachia!
---
Yeah I felt the same. Looked almost like a variety of ultracite PA, based on the silhouette. I’d love to have some NPC soldiers show up in WV that you can utilize to reform the local BoS chapter or Enclave garrison depending on your affiliation. Perhaps if faction wars become a thing then recruiting people into your faction could change the dynamics of the game, like in For Honor where factions take ground and the areas change as a result.
---
Game goes a bit too fast for a mechanic like that.
---
The LMG?? Well that was unexpected :) 
---
Great points about armor pen and grounded though....looks like ballistic is the way to go.
---
Sister.😉 and just won my first battle Royale!! Me and two others on my team! Omg what a rush. RIP the fourth teammate who didn't make it with us. 
---
If I can do it, anyone can!
---
There was a godzilla easter egg in fallout 1
---
Sadly, no.  
---
PC progress from the Bethesda launcher won't even be carried over to PC on the Steam launcher when it's available.  That's cruddy.
---
Nuclear winter is the resulting outcome from the mass of nukes launched.
---
A sextillion times, even!
---
Grafton vendor should have the plans/mods for each type. ;)
---
You used to get wanted when you attack another player outside of pacifist mode if they do not engage back but I think it's no longer possible since a few updates ago. Most of the time, players will have their stuff unlocked because there's really no point to lock it cause you can't really steal or destroy anything, I guess you can lure enemies into their home but repairing your home is usually pretty cheap so it's not really too much of a headache.
---
If someone griefing you, best thing to do is just block em and just hop to another world, no point in getting so work up over them.
---
To be honest, I have about 500 hours in and play since the beta and haven't encountered anyone that troll or grief anyone yet and for the last few months I keep telling my wife how great this community is for an online game lol 
---
But just like the real world and other online game, some people are just out to upset people and Id say just ignore em and continue your day
---
Sounds like you got your noob ass kicked dude.
---
Easy ammo is always nice :) I am concerned about the lack of armor penetration though. Perhaps ER on enemies is lower and compensates?
---
What do you think about the legacy explosives? Worth it?
---
No it is not worth it, 25$ for a movie is not worth it either, and tickets for a movie are like 7-8$.
---
60$ for triple A polished game is worth it, but fo76 was not that on launch
---
You should specify what system then.  Cause I’m on XBOX and it’s run literally perfectly for me.  I’m level 21.  I think at this point any problems some people are having are their own.  I’m specifically saying I have not seen a single thing wrong in my 50+ games I’ve done of it.
---
"All sloths are at least 10/10. Very good bois."
---
Cause I dont rely on others
---
"Dude it wasn't technically illegal to advertise one material and deliver another."
---
Yeah, no circlejerk here, no siree.
---
congrats.. I guess?

I downloaded it to play the free trial, I wanted to play the new br but thought i'd play the normal mode just to see how it plays
---
I spent hours running around doing quests, looting, listening to tapes, I couldn't believe how much fun I was having, I was spooked from the atmosphere and always on edge because of the food / water / radiation situation, it felt like I was playing a horror game, losing some loot when I died made surviving actually matter which I like
---
i've only got a cooking pot in my camp and storage boxes cause I havn't unlocked much else but i'm looking forward to it
---
so glad I tried it, i'm gonna buy it and finish the quests, having so much fun finding loot and crafting / cooking
---
i've seen random ppl running around but noone has said hello back yet
---
I just hope the pvp or griefing isn't too extreme, I just like the pve aspect
---
Indeed! 50 cal seems to be very popular too, but I don't know enough about heavy to know why tbh. Any advice on those?
---
I've been standing by the overseers caches in flatwoods and her camp and gift emoting. So many people can not find the brownbags. They also freak out a little when I shoot the caches but most times someone understands what I'm doing and will get the loot out of it that I put there.
---
Really wish we could drop things in a bright red gift box as an option.
---
I wouldn't say it was within a day. More like it has slowly been growing on people. Sure it helps that they have a free week going with a preview of a new Battle Royale mode which has got people all tickled but there's been a lot of people still in love with this game since it started (Like me). See you in the wastes!
---
I think the reason most people hated it was all the bugs at release. Now they are all fixed and everything is good!
---
Yes there is a perk called starched genes that will not allow you to get rid of a mutation.
---
Wow major bummer. Probably won't get it then. I was really hoping for cross play but transferred progress would have sufficed.
---
I think there's definitely a middle ground here. The game deserved a lot of criticism especially at launch - it wasn't quite ready. 
---
But yeah, outrage culture jumped in like crazy and people just loved to pile on
---
Desperately needs it.
---
:( They should reply my email soon. I’ll update once it concluded. Hope me luck.
---
You just are flexing too much like nobody cares if you can lift a lot because if it's true it's still annoying. Also, you use Reddit nobody on Reddit especially people like you are badass
---
It’s worth it. The game has improved greatly since launch in almost every way
---
Thanks bro. Do we need to do anything special besides friending to play?
---
THANK you.  I knew about starched genes, but can I no longer GET mutations with it on?  Also, can I have more then one mutation at once?  I've read about a few I'd like.  Thanks so much for your help.
---
Because it's rng, technically, someone could get NO non dupe cards for every single level until it goes away after the very first one.
---
I need to hear ‘Powering up. Protectron on duty!’ more, for a long time I thought that it wasn’t even in the game
---
It is sneak peek this week and will be fully launched this summer.
---
It’s not. What you say is correct. I honestly love the game and don’t really play anything else at the moment, but the technical state is just disastrous.
---
Too bad I have the opposite problem, I sound like an NPR host.
---
Nope this game is perfect in every way and you're just drinking too much haterade, quit criticizing my game!
---
There's a perk you can get under the luck tree called "starched genes" at level 2 you never get new mutations while it's equipped and rad away doesn't cure your current mutations. I'm not sure at what level the perk actually unlocks though!
---
Cut and paste of an earlier post I made on mutations, specific to mutations:
---
With maxed starched genes equipped, they last forever. Even if you die. Multiple sessions.
---
The fine points:
---
There are two ways to acquire mutations, either via Serum or Random Exposure to radiation.
---
Serums grant the named mutation permanently and suppress the negative effects for one hour. You can take a mutation serum again and again to suppress the negative effects for one hour.
---
Mutations granted from radiation exposure are random. So if you want say five specific mutations, getting the five exact ones you want is going to be tricky. What you would do is go to a place like Black Water Mind and purposely expose yourself to radiation via the pool outside or the barrels inside just before then entrance. If you mutate and get what you want, put up starched genes. You then go inside blackwater mine and use the decontamination shower to both clear the rads off you and if desired via removing starched genes...remove undesired mutations. Removal is random too. Theres always a chance of getting a desired mutation removed and you will get mutations you don't want.
---
Going back to serums, serums are the smarter and safer way of mutating. Craft or acquire the serums you need, plenty of people on Reddit sell them as reasonable prices. Then make sure you have starched genes off (go jump in a decontamination shower if you need to remove rads, or use radaway full strength), once cleared, use your serums. Re apply starched genes once you have gained the mutations you want. Sidenote: apparently there has been (possibly still is?) a bug with applying serums and the carnivore serum, apparently having carnivore already effective can or did cause further mutation serums to fail, suggest consuming the other serums and carnivore last. Reapply Starched Genes and always keep it up.
---
Max out Class Freak and run that too, it lessens the negative effects of mutations. Side note on Healing factor: From what I've noticed with my own use of healing factor, even with Class Freak maxed out, the negative hit on the healing that Stimpaks seems unchanged regardless of having class freak in use.
---
Radaway has a chance to cure a mutation unless you have starched genes up.
---
Rad X at full strength with suppress all mutations for 5 minutes, I have mine diluted as do many others.
---
So:
---
Max Starched Genes is a must, never in-equip this.
---
Acquire desired mutations, use Carnivore serum last.
---
Class Freak at max is a good thing
---
Be careful using full strength Radaways if you know you're going to be out in combat soon, like farming Whitesprings in a Nuke Zone.
---
Mutations are forever if starched, last through death, from session to session and cannot be shared.
---
Carnivore and Herbivore are exclusive - meaning you can only have one or the other.
---
As to serums, the suppressing of negative effects expire after an hour but you keep the mutation with it's negative effects. You can take another serum of a specific type and it will suppress the negative effects of that particular mutation for another hour. They don't stack in the sense that you can get two hours or more of suppressed negative effects via chugging the same serum type.
---
Hit the nail on the head on survival ruined by duper’s. I’ll add the fact camps/turrets are also indestructible has ruined the experience.
---
What we need is servers to go permanent &amp; everyone starts over at lvl 1 and no trading gear from adventure mode.
---
Xbox. 
---
Lag time between switching weapons could be shortened or give a perk card that would fix the issue. And sometimes kills/downs don’t count as you doing them even though the top left says your name doing it.
---
Another C.A.M.P. needs your help!
---
Do u mean the mode?
---
When I saw the trailer I was under the impression there could be only one winner, once it got down to a few left the team would disband and it would be an all out brawl.  I don't understand how a team of 4 could be the overseer.
---
well now I need ass-less chaps ...for reasons
---
Nope. Only Marsupial, Speed Demon, and Herd Mentality.
---
This is gonna sound nuts, but I always thought LMGs were light weapons....kinda in the SMG category. TIL :)
---
Gatling seems to be coming to the fore, tbh, but I guess I can look for any nice heavy ballistics I might have. The lack of armor pen on the energy weapons is a deal breaker for me :/
---
I'm first time F76 player. I am not impressed... but I'm not quite disappointed either. The game feels like an early access game with potential to become a decent game.  
---
-Poor performance (on GTX 1070, medium presets ingame)  
---
-Game crashes  
---
-No text chat (my friend doesen't use mic)  
---
-No friends list in the launcher   
---
And that's just after few hours of playing.
---
Valid point, I'm on ps4 and all these things are happening, I love the game mode but the bugs just make it hard to enjoy the good in it, but when it gets on a roll it gets rolling with the good stuff of you know what I mean
---
youll need the starched genes perk maxed to make mutations permanent..
---
class freak is the card that mitigates the negative effects..
---
almost all junk has a use in crafting.. avoid burnt books &amp; magazines..
---
you only really want to bulk junk if youre gonna sell it.. only 2 bulked items actually reduce weight..
---
just take everything and break it down.. eventually youll figure out what you need most then you can tag those things for search in the pipboy
---
Like do I need to connect to European servers or something.
---
If so to play with others in NW you need to invite them to your team in the main menu
---
how do you make your character cry whenever they see a body lol
---
Did not know Dallas was onboard, their [wiki page here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Game_Studios_Dallas) states them as having 48 employees. Last I had heard Austin was the only team left working on 76 as the rest were all in on the new IP's Zenimax wants done asap.
---
If its happening that often, its 90% most likely on your end with your internet connection.
---
It's possible. Little Lamp kids were lucky. They happened to be in the caverns and avoided nuclear fallout. The caverns may have been an appropriate place just for these circumstances which explains why Vault 87 was built there.
---
As for Appalachia, from what I gather this place is far more remote than D.C. and Boston. Survivability of the nuclear war would be compared to Vegas. If Nick somehow skipped town before the bombs fell he may have survived but considering his personality and his hatred for Ed Winter I assume he would have remained in Boston knowing Winter was released.
---
Thats true, there are some bugs tho. Once I tried to pick up a teammate while being in Power Armor. And since you need to hold the interact key for both leaving the PA and reviving a teammate I got stuck in my PA, unable to move
---
That's what we have said since the game came out.
---
You and many others were completely misslead by reviewers, Youtubers, and reddit haters.
---
Thats the fcking problem every company now thinks it is okey to put unfinished game on a market and charge it for full price. And finish it in a year after release. This is not okey and this shouldnt be new standard for gaming industry.
---
All this games that you mention gained heavy criticism and thats why they worked hard to improve. If everyone praised fo76 at start bethesda would think game is perfect and no need to work so hard on it to improve it as they did now.
---
Well I played on new characters on my PS4 when game came out - the first bunch of levels had boring go here kill this guy or go here loot this and come back.
---
I don’t want to slog through all that again on a new character on PC just for the trial to end and then I’m sitting there thinking, I just played all the same shit I played at launch.
---
I didn't really play any but a few hours of the beta.  I've played the free week a bit so far.  Not entirely enthused.  Most little things I can overlook.  The disconnects that like to come at the worst time, and completely reset things like workshop control and daily quests are annoying enough I don't know if I even want to drop the $17 for it on Amazon.
---
I play plenty of games, not a single other one has these disconnect issues.  Hell, I fucked about in Black Desert again early this year and stayed in game there a week at a time, only disconnecting due to the weekly maintenance.  Bethesda really needs to get it worked out.  At least have a grace period to reconnect to the same server and not lose all progress on any daily quests you hadn't yet finished, and control of your workshop.  They aren't that frequent, usually can get a couple hours in between them, but it's still no fun to just randomly lose the workshop you were looking forward to gathering resources from once you finished this next quest.
---
Not to mention now that I'm seeing those atom prices for myself (I know, I know, you can grind some in game too) they really are fucking batshit insane.  A one off power armor skin for $18 would be one thing, but fucking $4-6 for a pip boy skin?  Shit's so overpriced it feels legitimately insulting.
---
For mutation, you need Starched Genes rank 2 under Luck. When you want to consume a mutation, remove the perk. Then equipped it back on so you can take Radaways and it will not remove any of your mutation.
---
Oh no the game will just connect the both of u to the same server if your parties up
---
I found the Perk system a little confusing, but it turns out that all the players have the same amount of health, strength etc. The only difference is how you've distributed your Special points. If you only have One points in Agility then any Agility Perk ranked above One is useless to you. But if you have 15 points in Strength you could equip three 5-rank cards, for example and still have room for four additional cards in the other categories (you can only equip a max of seven cards in total). Still learning myself though.
---
The free week is really stressing out the servers with so many new people playing at once. I expect this to be reminded after it's over. Still obviously the occasional disconnect though.
---
You made it SO damn easy to understand.  Thank you SOOOO much.  I got lucky getting the mutation I wanted on my first mutation -- haha.  I have starched genes too so will just level that up ASAP.
---
/r/boneappletea
---
Photomode expressions! 😂
---
I think FOMO is simply a pill someone has to swallow when it comes to these sorts of live games.
---
You are correct sir....   had to look that up. 
---
I don’t have the recipe for Scaly Skin yet.   I have about 7 serum recipes, gradually buying
---
them at a rate of about 1 a week (daily cap limit + selling stuff).  
---
My plan is to eventually get all of the serum recipes.  They used to drop from the SBQ but those days are gone.
---
I would.  It’s the kind of thing I would do anyway after completing everything (that I wanted) in the game. It would be especially sweet if there were a reward of some kind.  Something unique to serve as a trophy.
---
Right now gold isn't very useful. I thought they should try making it more rare and use is kinda like a second form of currency.  If gold scrap was worth 5 caps to vendors you could basically use it to hold more than 25,000 caps at any given time.  This would possibly open up the economy and make workshops and mines more valuable for players to take and defend.  
---
My gut tells me it's more likely to be some sort of BR mode though.
---
You evil genius - I salute you!
---
Either be honest and say you want to play alone, or delete them. Don’t just pretend they don’t exist, it makes you look like an asshole. Even more so when you get caught
---
if you do not have the Starched Gene perks available yet go to the White spring Nuka Cola vendor and buy the Grape Nuka-Cola.  Cures Rads without removing mutations.
---
No one thinks it was perfect but the amount of bugs in the game, as bad as it was doesn't take a 7 or 8/10 game and make it below a 5.
---
The fact that stupid shit like this is near the top of the thread is why this sub is such a friggin joke. Is this sub just one big ouroboros of y'all sucking each other off with Todd at the head?
---
nice.. well played !
---
What I ment bu lag spike is the game screen freezes for a second to switch the weapons, and i haven't seen that bug that sucks!
---
Also just before the bombs dropped he was at CIT for PTSD recovery so I doubt he was going anywhere
---
Unarmed not two handed or one they mean meat hook,power fist,mole min gauntlet excetera...
---
I just saw about tagging things in the pip boy.  Haven't done this yet.  I've been playing like other Fallouts and know to junk literally everything.  Thanks for the help!
---
Couldn't have said it better myself!
---
I don’t think they will either, it just stinks that at E3, or in the inside the vault today zero mention of future updates to survival.
---
You would think it will be getting some new updates/news soon, hopefully in the next few weeks. They very well could announce permanent survival servers after the “pre-beta” is done with Fallout 76: Battle Royale.
---
Would be smart from the developer perspective. You have all the mostly positive hype from this new game mode, and new players who like to pvp. You have to dangle a new carrot to keep these guys playing.
---
This is the only online game that I frequently disconnect from.
---
Just a heads up the shocks and jetpack are some of the rarest and hardest to find in the enclave bunker. You can buy the plans but if youre just looking for the mods its gonna take alot of server hopping.
---
Lead paint on child blocks? That might explain the mentality of some of the players.
---
It's a pain to get them to snap, but you can small the regular floor pieces into the floor of the stair platform
---
Nice! Harper's Ferry would be a fun NW map, I'd love to see a Cranberry Bog map or a map situated in the mountains though.
---
Yesterday the daily for use 5 Stimpacks was bugged as well on Xbox.
---
I gotcha.  I could have definitely written one the other way around too! Lol. Thanks for responding.
---
I have had this happen to different trophies like getting 25 levels 
---
Sorry to say but if you want it you’ll have to start a new character
---
I'm still not clear on this. Are you asking a question?
---
I also haven't played since the new year. Is there a list of bug fixes and changes I can read?
---
My biggest frustration was my base being destroyed every time some one else had their base at my location.
---
&gt;an all new main quest
---
Does that mean is replaces the current one or expands on it? It reads like it replaces it, but clarity would be nice.
---
I think you have to set the hat separately.
---
As far as we know? No
---
Id definitely save that idea IF private servers become a thing and allow mods. You could definitely be able to balance it out to work great. But as it sits right now, its super easy to die lol Glad to hear your enjoying the game tho, it is definitely nice to see all these new players
---
only if they remove legendary weapons from that mode, sure.
---
I played the game at launch.  Yes, there were bugs;  yes, there were glitches.  But I personally never encountered anything I considered game breaking.  Even when disconnects were rampant, I still had a blast playing it.
---
And yes, it was popular to hate on it as demonstrated by the sheer volume of people who openly admitted to never having actually played the game.  I saw a lot of self-fulfilling prophecies from this crowd.  Before there was even a beta to play they had long lists of why FO76 was going to kill the franchise and then found issues to back up those pre-existing opinions once the game launched.
---
I know a lot of people experienced a lot more bugs at launch than I personally did.  I know there were people who felt the bugs were literally gamebreaking.  I'm not discounting that or their experiences.  But, at the same time, it cannot be denied that it was also popular to hate on the game.
---
Pretty much the same. I've had great fun from the start and it's just getting better.
---
I would play a perma death survival, if they removed all legendary effects like in NW.
---
Sometimes I‘m too tired to play myself and just want to watch. And sometimes I just want to watch people who, other than me, know what they’re doing. :)
---
Obligatory question: why do you watch sports? It’s kinda the same.
---
Why would you have an empty lobby? It's free week for a brand new game mode, lobbies are going to be packed.
---
I just realized I want Godzilla to fight liberty prime.
---
Best feeling ever
---
6 points. I tried it out and didn’t like it but I do see a few taking advantage of it.
---
Sure, but I want real plants.
---
Neither does the mining armor sadly.. 
---
If it had a jetpack.... woooooo
---
This is possible?!
---
Just a re-hash of all the stuff they talked about at E3.  I was really hoping they would have more dates and info dumps on what exactly we should be looking forward to with the Nuclear Winter dlc.
---
Congrats! First one is always the most epic.
---
Now you just have to work towards SOLO kills! ;-)
---
Yea I know that's why I asked... so they should throw us some shit for it cuz not all fault we cant do it
---
&gt; the first bunch of levels had boring go here kill this guy or go here loot this and come back
---
That's the basic structure of every Fallout game.  The others just had an additional "Talk to/convince this person" as an optional way to finish an objective.  But it's the same loop.  That's the basic loop of RPGs with quests.  If you don't like that, you won't like this.
---
I think that certain problems are specific to individuals.  If I don’t notice something a friend is, it’s a them problem.  Connection issues are internet, everyone’s internet is different.  It’s not fair to say fix this or fix that if not everyone is experiencing the same thing.
---
Is it just me or do card also auto upgrade?
---
I had rifleman,  got another and the second vanished while my equipped one jumped in power.
---
That's what I assumed.. thank you.. must be bugged on xbox
---
I made a separate character for NW. so far I’ve played 3 matches and leveled up twice. The longer you survive and the more kills you get the better the XP from it.
---
Low level characters can only equip 1-point perk cards though.
---
There's a couple in the shop, isn't there? Like the cat face one.
---
What the hell that was the only one that did work apart from the flamethrower.
---
Yeah. Invisible enemies for example would make this difficult.
---
Just unequip it, radiate yourself until you mutate again, and re-equip it 
---
or buy the specific serum from a player's vendor
---
you can have as many mutations as desired
---
They're as toxic as all of you are white knighting. To read this sub, you'd think that Fallout76 was the best thing to happen to the internet, ever. Half these thread titles sound like they were designed in a corporate office: "Isn't it Strange that within a Day the View on Fallout 76 is Completely Flipped Being Mostly Positive" It hasn't, y'all are just jerking each other off over it, coooonstantly. Would be nice if there was just a neutral place to talk about the game.
---
Word thx man
---
Squeaker, no squeaking!
---
I think it's more like talk them out of spending $60 on a game they're not going to enjoy. I fall victim to bad hype, too. Not because I'm not willing to try a game that may or may not be bad, but because I can't afford to waste that kind of money on one. I had high hopes and pre-ordered this game (which I rarely do) with full expectations of having to wait a bit before it was as good as it could be, but not everyone can afford the risk. That's why these free trials are worthwhile to developers and more should do them, imo.
---
My friends and I encountering this bug most of the time after the NW update. Game crashes when try to click on team on the map for the purpose of fast travel. Atleast fast travel from social tab works.
---
Ad Victoriam, soldier.
---
Sweet okay thanks.  Sounds like I won't mess around in nuclear waste anymore and just buy serums.
---
Congratulations 🤘🏻
---
You can farm lead at Posiden.
---
I typically play alone 99% of the time and have one friend I play with when we can line schedules up. So far I have fun playing SP since there are always events to run.
---
Very good point and I completely agree :) I'm the same lol this was the third game I've ever pre-ordered, others were Skyrim and AC odyssey
---
*You smell like dog buns*
---
You can get the collectors editions for 50 dollars on amazon. I ordered one and im supposed to get it today.
---
Ballistic gat is my workhorse as it has high single shot damage and is ammo efficient. 50 cal for when I really want to shred. Lmg is good for a higher firing position. It's held like a rifle rather than low slung like most heavies. That can be an issue if you have objects between you and your target. With bear arms though I carry at least one of everything. They're all different and fun in their own ways. I hear that the legacy explosive gatlings are nuts, but I dont have one.
---
What’s that? Run naked into Flatwoods with only a board as a weapon? 
---
Anything for a rifleman card.
---
I've gotten 9 duplicates and I'm level 15. Also 4 melee cards that I'll never use....
---
My thoughts exactly. I can’t see them giving us something we all love and then stripping it from us for maintenance. Just fix the game as we play, that way we stay happy, and they get the best feedback possible.
---
Ooh, that brings back memories of wasteland 2
---
I'm also on PC, friend me and I'd be glad for the company. And I have a mic! Account name is same as here.
---
When you're strong enough to get into the Whitespring, there's a nice lady robot on the second floor selling Nuka Cola Grape that does not remove mutations. Tucked in a cubby hole Just down the hall from the bartender. She only sells one at a time, though.
---
From the Wiki:
---
 A purple bottle of [Nuka-Cola](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Nuka-Cola_(Fallout_4)), it features a purple label with an image of a purple grape bunch along with a similar bottlecap. This drink restores 100 [Hit Points](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Hit_Points) when consumed, along with restoring 50 [Action Points](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Action_Points) and reducing [Radiation](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Radiation) by 400 points.
---
And I have different internet than both of you in probably a different country and I don’t have that problem.  Round and round we go, where we stop no one knows.  It’s all relative man.
---
&gt;Back then, games had to work at launch.  
---
&gt;Period.
---
\*Laughs in Fallout 2\*
---
Yeap that how I feel and thats probably the way most people feel about this kind of stuff, there is people out there that like other companies also.
---
No it's good
---
Because you weren't there when it came out. Good as it is now, the launch was not without any problems.
---
Countless &gt;:) I'm usually full geared within 20 seconds.
---
I'm guessing English isn't your native language, most of the those sentences make no sense to me
---
I don't see why not. If they hear about this and decide to do it they should have a character who fought in the great war and survived and have him at a red rocket or abandoned military camp or base where we find him tinkering with a motorcycle and possibly be able to recruit him as a follower. Or they could have him as a member of the brotherhood or enclave and still be an option for a follower. For me, this is a character I could really bond with as me and the guy have the same interests in motorcycles and I do plan on joining the army when I hit 18. There's a lot of ways they could put him in the game and would make for a really cool character who could have lines that would reflect the guy's life.
---
The flatwoods church is an amazing spawn, you get 2-4 terminals to hack. You can get to know where everybody is and get yourself outfitted with some good gear. Starting there with a minigun is awesome
---
Not in your stash, but you can only hold one at a time on your person.
---
Definitely makes sense to bide some time, Wastelanders won't be out till September at the earliest and is one of the biggest updates, one that I'd imagine only just began development shortly before E3.
---
Just ordered my friend up north a copy..for 10 bucks you can't beat it.
---
I sincerely believe my experience with the game has been greatly enhanced by this community! I really couldn't have figured out some stuff without y'all and have not seen another gaming community--on any forum-- be so positive and helpful!
---
The best part is that even my husband was floored by how interactive you Bethesda people are and how quickly things brought up here are addressed! He didn't believe me until I started showing him posts with answers from your team then some of the requests would be handled within a month, or even a week. That's INSANE.
---
I know not everyone understands how things work at game development companies, but I know how bureaucratic it can get in those offices along with the simple logistical steps that have to be taken for such fast turnaround times. 
---
Please pass along that we appreciate the mind-bending, back-breaking work y'all do over there. You're superheroes and you deserve all the praise! High fives all around!
---
I totally agree. If I hear someone and I have a large trade, unless I’m on my last daytripper I’ll disengage and let them trade.
---
Sure and then I can totally use that 50 xp to do more damage with guns or have armor last longer just like what a non-duplicate perk card would let me do!
---
I have actually played a large amount of games and can safely say even big names like WoW or FFXIV have disconnect issues.
---
There is no perfect game, if there was you would be playing that.
---
Fallout 76 is just a spin off game so im not concerned, also i feel no marital commitment to it, at all.
---
&gt; But I personally never encountered anything I considered game breaking.
---
Disconnecting after launching your nuke is game breaking.
---
Having the final boss fly beyond the edge of the map is game breaking.
---
Rampant duping of weapons in a game with PvP elements is game breaking.
---
And then there's a litany of bugs and just general game instability.
---
I was on a match where it was myself and one other guy and a mirelurk hunter came out of nowhere and killed my ass. I was so embarrassed.
---
I am hoping that will be on the next one. I'd really like to see the roadmap.
---
Whats the update on Legacy System, the two vault raids, displaying items at our camp, and why have some items implemented in Wild Appalachia aren't in-game yet like the Beer Keg
---
I have had this issue across multiple characters. It still says I haven't hacked any terminals. My challenges and achievements have never tracked properly in this game. Unfortunately, I find myself sitting with minimal atoms because, even when the challenges pop up as completed, I won't be awarded atoms. It's quite annoying considering the only other way to get them is to buy them. It feels shady.
---
Edit: My theory is that if you had made any progress during the beta, those respective trophies/challenges will no longer track.
---
I so wish rifle had the equivalent of bear arms....but anyhow, that's not relevant :)
---
So you mentioned legacy explosive gatlings....do the ballistic ones not spawn with explosive anymore?
---
There are like 30 different places all over the map where you can start great with your teammates (or alone).  I love how versatile locations can be.  It’s super great!
---
I collect books to sell for an easy buck. :-)
---
Yep.  Seems like this activity is on the uptick lately.
---
I know right
---
Just wait till you get to the endgame and realize how hollow and meaningless it is. Killing the queen or doing uranium fever for the 20th time, nuking whitespring over and over.. it just gets old fast.
---
Congrats. You always remember your first. Hope you took a pic
---
Legendaries ruin so much of the game
---
I'm really hoping for some capital wastelanders. Harper's Ferry is up the river (or whats left of it) from DC. Also only like 40 miles by land.
---
It’s more than likely duped and OP purchased it from them; I’d do the same!
---
Thanks REAGAN!!!
---
Try trading/buying an item from a very trusted friend to get you down to 9999 caps, then go loot a super mutsnt or ghoul until you get that cap and see if it works.
---
The thing where you get stuck aiming down sights is pretty annoying. You can get out of it by reloading or switching guns but it's very easy to get killed in the moment due to it. RIP that 1v3 I could have potentially won
---
Hit level 13 yesterday. I have gotten 8 duplicates from levels and challenge packs. My friend has gotten 1. My friend has a sick build that works well. I have a mishmash of random junk because I keep getting duplicates that do me no good.
---
Thank you for the reply. Yeah I'm not a fan at all and avoid any game with it in. I just assumed that FO76 would just not have it. It's fine there are plenty of other games out there. :)
---
what  dont you understand man? I will try to explain
---
Yeah but if you scrap your dublicates it will probably open up different ones, I understand that the 50xp is nothing
---
I like the pick one of 3 type idea, good thinking.
---
To be fair, a lot of the bugs in Bethesda games don't impede the function of the game.  They're usually just graphical or animation issues.
---
Yeah glad to see other people noticing - just had to consecutive matches with invincible people. Very cool.
---
&gt;proves how many people have no clue how MMO games work.
---
What do MMOs have to do with Fallout 76? It's not an MMO. Developers never referred to it as an MMO, which should have been a clue.
---
But also a different console, yes it is all relative but there are bugs that are console relevant, if never ran into the bug where you kills arnt counted like the other guy, if you haven't ran into any bugs that's great good for you, but some people have and that's why I made this post for those who have so that way people are aware of bugs and what may cause them, how to fix them, and avoid them
---
the way the matchmaking in this game works you will never find an empty lobby, unless someone leaves.  I bet they are Beth employees, they did say they were playing right along side us.
---
This this and this. The objective is to survive to the end and there is no demand that you have to kill to stay in the game mode. I put on my dark black cosmetic outfit and hid in the dark corners of houses and bushes until the end of the matches and I won each time.
---
What do you mean? Even MaTN said the game was a disappointing mess in his "how to fix fo76". It had more to do with the fact the game came out an absolute buggy mess. Even Todd Howard recently came out and admitted they fucked up on the launch and it shouldn't have been released when it was.
---
Just because everyone was shitting on this game when it came out doesn't mean there aren't legitimate complaints.
---
Basically any game you need team work.
---
LOL. As if we were not OP already.
---
Yep hopefully that ones way down on the snagging list, that would be the most unpopular bug fix to date I think lol
---
Hmm.  Maybe I *am* speaking too confidently about that.  I'm not 100% sure, no.  But Bethesda has already said that you won't get the Steam version for free if you have the Bethesda Launcher version.  I know that much.  I can't recall if I read something about progress not being carried over, or that was just an assumption on my part due to them being considered to be two different versions of the game.
---
Getting old is awesome!  I'm lucky I remember where I live.
---
If you can't handle people sharing their genuine feelings on the game because they're too positive, then don't browse this sub.
---
Sounds like bad rng, I got it really quick. If you're on Xbox I can slap one on for you.
---
To your question, only football (soccer for some), but I have very little time to relax so I either put a movie on for background while I work or I play a game...heck I don't even get to watch youtube and am years behind on my Netflix watch list.
---
But I guess it's much the same as the upcoming craze of Esports….watching people play a game professionally...just seems so...odd to me with videogames. 
---
I was invited to watch the World of Tanks finals when the company came to Toronto and held an event so I went down (mostly for the freebies really), watching the game was just...odd...the way the professional's play is much more akin to a group running screaming at each other across a field - so much more twitch action than any real sort of plan or tactics. Again, just a different mindset that it doesn't interest me as much, but in comparison with regular sports I can understand it somewhat.
---
I was only being silly mate. I half heartedly post or when I'm fucked, so apologies haha.
---
 I think trump is hilarious, not to mention the actual good he is doing for your country. Now some people can't seem to handle that fact.
---
Peace!
---
Welp, since the only kind of armor currently in NW happens to be T-51b I can't imagine them adding a skin you couldn't show off in the game mode.
---
It's because there's no actual bug with atom shop skins on weapons. I've had skins on most of my two and three star weapons since the game launched. Never "lost a star."
---
is not fun to make a joke about someone just because you dont understand the way they express things.
---
When the game was announced, there was a segment of the fanbase that was...unhappy...that it was:
---
* Online.
---
* Not Fallout 5.
---
* Not a sequel to New Vegas.
---
It didn't help that the B.E.T.A. (and initial launch) was buggy as hell, even by Bethesda standards. There wasn't much to do, there were issues with the servers. In sum it just wasn't a very fun game. The hate train that started when 76 was announced just gathered more and more steam. If it was (almost) anything besides Bethesda and/or Fallout, it would have just been forgotten about.
---
To polish it, patch it, perfect it. Also, a waiting period might make the new players stick around longer to play the base game.
---
Well...
---
I dunno man start with your title. What terminologies? What has been useful? 
---
Are you asking a question? Or are you stating your opinion? What, in fact, is your question or opinion?
---
Disease also has to be Whoopsie
---
That happened to me a few times in adventure mode, sucks to hear it still happens in nuclear winter
---
 The ballistic ones still drop.
---
Welp, I just said bye-bye to my overseer rank - I doubt Beth will allow us to keep our progress with THAT kind of stuff happening. No question about this one - great capture on your part.
---
Added them, thank you. Nice to see action boy only costs 1!
---
Add them, thank you.
---
Interesting, hoping they release more info after this week's sneak peak.
---
And what have you been doing for the last 200 hours? Running around Whitesprings and dropping goody bags at Vault 76?
---
Well if 100 other people comment on your post, maybe you’ll get lucky and the Dev’s will forward it to Bethesda and fix it for you.  I won’t notice the difference but hope it works out for you!
---
Finally somme good fucking content
---
I'd like to imagine Nick catching wind of Winter's release, storming out of CIT and despite the chaos around him he ignores it all and would rather meet his end avenging his fiance than cowering somewhere. I look at the synth we meet as an extension or rebirth of the original Nick that has the sole purpose of finishing what his predecessor started.
---
There was some shady shit Bethesda did with the power armor edition, and I think that heavily impacted people’s view of the game. While I’m not defending what Bethesda did, I think a game should be judged solely on its content, not on the corporate side of it. I love Dragon Age and the Sims, and EA being a garbage company doesn’t affect my enjoyment of either, and I think that should apply here (although I don’t think Bethesda is anywhere near EA garbage levels)
---
Not only am I getting a bunch of duplicates, the duplicates I’m getting are completely irrelevant to the mode or incredibly narrow
---
Added Pharma Farma, thank you.
---
Is that why even Todd Howard himself admitted the launch of the game was an absolute mess and shouldn't have been released when it was? Is ol' Todd now part of the hatetrain too?
---
On pc. I don't think it's rng bc I've scrapped about 30 after I learned all the rest and still haven't got it.
---
Thanks for the long reply. I am sure the mechanic becomes trivial to deal with after a few hours but it's something that I hate when games do and will avoid whenever I can. I'm sure the rest of the game is great it's just not for me. There are plenty of other games for me to try. :)
---
I play on PS4 and have had fantastic connection/performance lately. Maybe the servers are stressed from all the new players
---
There probably won't be a road map, likely just an is what it is except for different maps in other regions.
---
Shark bait, ooh haha.
---
Because you didnt see how bad it was then and how much we all had to go through! Lost many legendary items that we all worked for. Many frustrating bugs and issues, crazy things over and over...But Bethesda is making great strides forward and now you are seeing those improvements....
---
Maybe it's like the dense CA mod where some patch broke it and they haven't fixed it yet?
---
The Punch Bowl.
---
You could place any beverage inside of it, and anyone who drank from it would give the effects to, without it depleting the bowl. It was broken somehow, so Bethesda disabled that part of it recently, and are apparently planning to re-implement it soon.
---
So for now, it's just decorative.
---
I looked em up, on Xbox. The gamer tag Radscorpion is definitely an active player and just unlocked an achievement in 76 yesterday and is a long standing account with many games games over years worth of time. It’s a real person. Mirelurk on the other hand, is either a completely private account or it has just been sitting abandoned for years. So if you really played against someone named Mirelurk on Xbox, there’s a fair chance it was a bot.
---
For the record, I have never (intentionally) duped anything in this game.  I have had a couple of glitches where I went, *"WTF, why are there two of them now?"* but I imagine that doesn't count for your moral outrage.
---
I thought we had settled that chaps are by their very nature ass-less.
---
Oo 😂love the barrel sticking out cracked me up lol and good job on photo have used to see if 🐸 peeps are on the roof above me...
---
Ah yes, the refuge of people who have no arguments to stand on: "You're just shitting on people who disagree with you."   
---
Why yes, I am, because your disagreement is not based in anything remotely resembling reality. BGSD is a different studio. Different company -- they work for the same \*PARENT\*, they have different history (BGSA was Battlecry studios, BGSD was Escalation studios; regular BGS in Maryland has always been BGS). It's been announced for months and months that Nuclear Winter was being developed out of Dallas, and that Austin was working on Wild Appalachia, and Maryland on the base game.  Get your facts right before getting defensive when people correct you on your shit.
---
Except they weren't listening to y'all. Y'all were sucking on their knobs regardless of what garbage they tossed you. They were listening to everyone else with half a brain in their head that actually criticized the game. If they only ever listened to the numbnuts in communities like this, they'd never have to release a finished game again.
---
It's a demo, not the full thing. They've also got other content coming out so they probably want some focus on that.
---
We definitely need this, i want to know what and when to expect this new wave of content. We all need to keep the hype alive for this game
---
Assuming you have no other addons, your Fallout76Custom.ini should look something like this...
---

---
What camp improvements are expected in Wastelands?
---
Are we going to get other functional objects like logic gates in Fallout 4, for our camp?
---
How will player choice and consequences mentioned in the trailer, will affect other players?
---
I think some sort of siren or launch alarm going off would be a neat touch
---
Do you play the game in public lobbies and what’s the craziest funniest and most entertaining things you’ve seen the players doing that you could never have imagined or predicted when the game was in development? I know one developer once said they were amazed by a players home made Brahmin toss game as they didn’t even know the physics of the game would allow that. I’d love to hear more stories like that.
---
John Henry.. Eden?
---
Hrm, I went into Adventure Mode and "favorited" both the hat and costume. I also favorited the costume pack in the Atomic Shop, but the Silver Shroud Atom store is the entire thing, not seperated.
---
Agreed. I just went through all the other challenges and the few I did yesterday reset as well.
---
When I first played FO4 I thought there would be a different HUD for each power armor. So something like the T-45 is bulky and invasive, but T-51 less so, T-60 even better, and X-01 has the most slick and high-tech interface.
---
That is so untrue it makes me believe you weren't around for the beta. Even todd howard himself admitted recently this game was a massive screw up to release it when they did. Is he now just part of the "generating views" group?
---
That's literally not how the games industry works.
---
Toxic Larry’s Meat n Go? Yuh, that’s where we dropping boys.
---
That's a nice way to think of it. Nick is an incredibly interesting companion to have around (and a very useful one) Him and DiMA are both very interesting
---
I’d ask them to approximate the amount of developers working on FO76 to put Reddit minds at ease... that there is more than one developer.
---
I noticed last night the PA skin had the 'atom bomb' icon from Nuclear Winter, so I assumed it was a reward of some type.
---
Cool to see that it's 'just free'.
---
Staying alive
---
How drunk did you get
---
That's why this is considered PRE BETA...they are gathering feedback, is that acceptable?
---
I can handle it. It seems it's you lot that can't handle anyone else having a different opinion on the game than you. The posts where I've witnessed some of you having to confront that fact, you'd think the sky was falling to listen to the fanboys.
---
Oh honey, that was a nice attempt but you failed.
---
Really? Didn’t feel all that invested in fallout 76 quests such as pick up bottles or listen to these holotapes. Whereas in Fallout 4 I did actually care a good deal and got pretty darn invested.
---
Didn’t come to talk about RPGs bud, was focusing more on this game. Wanted to know if it was still a buggy mess or if it’s worth putting in the hours.
---
Darn. I'll try it out later and see if I get anywhere with it.
---
No, it's just...I think that back in my days it was harder to escape learning about it.  They drilled it into us so much that we all learned it.  I get the impression that you have to make an effort to learn more about those things if you grew up after the Cold War.
---
It was optimized poorly, it ran badly and the ammount of bugs in the game was outrageous.
---
Also there were huge PR disators for Bethesda as the handled alot of issues terriblly.
---
Its anazing what 6 months can do though, the game is very good now
---
Well first, it's like any other Fallout. FO4 was barely considered a Fallout game by many fans and FO76 went even weirder with some of the mechanics, plus adding multiplayer.
---
So yeah it's a fun game but for Fallout "purists" it's pretty far off the mark.
---
There were, and maybe still are, a lot of technical issues that irritated a lot of players.
---
Pet Megasloth are very noisy buggers, they roar every second!
---
GET REKT
---
Just adding my voice to the list of people saying it's actually pretty fun. I have played PUBG and Fortnite, and didn't really like either. I sorta liked Apex Legends, but not a huge amount.
---
But I have had a lot more fun with Nuclear Winter than any of those. It maybe just because I am familiar enough with Fallout to not suck at it, but it really is a fun time.
---
Only had one teammate who constantly chattered...no teabagging that I noted...feels very visceral as opposed to the cartoon feel of forknife...
---
Very nice.
---
Notice how each map is similarly named, even the smaller Charleston map. These are probably the nuclear winter maps. 
---
What interests me is the flatwoods map that doesn't follow the same naming protocol. Could this be a different game mode?  That's a very lonely "d" at the end of the map name. Maybe for defense, as in maybe an attack defend game mode.
---
I know this seems like a radical idea nowadays but just play it and form your own opinion. :)
---
And then take two of them at a time. In the wild!
---
Then take on a Sentry bot with rockets and a SB. (thankfully they will attack each other).
---
President of America!
---
President...of your heart.
---
Woof!  (I am a dog, can only lick and woof)
---
Sales haven't worked like that in the past, if something goes on sale they don't discount it further later on; they'll more likely just take it off the store.
---
Being only able to have one card per slot is even more limiting!
---
Let's hope. I mostly liked it, but it did feel a bit empty and quite repetitive, not to mention the bugs.
---
No worries at all, I get accosted pretty often for supporting Trump so I thought this was more of the same - I also apologize for taking it the wrong way. I'm glad the good is being seen, the media is in a frenzy here with their hate - but so far he's been great. 
---
&gt; Now some people can't seem to handle that fact
---
Absolutely, it's actually baffling to see how some people act in regards to Trump. 
---
Have a great day and weekend 👊
---
Where are all the terminals? I haven’t seen one yet and only 1 safe to lock pick, I must be starting in the wrong places 🤔
---
There are a bunch of vids. mostly this person, and another guy that wears the brotherhood flight suit. I can still see that particular thread, but the video is gone. I don't know what they gain by covering it up. it's a beta. you would think that they would be into it.
---
Noooooo don’t take away the eating and drinking! Food and drinks give so many different buffs. I stopped being a junkie using chems and alcohol cuz of it! 😂
---
And now the song is playing in my head :)
---
I gave examples of balance stuff, as in things off the top of my mind, like how a single pulse grenade can kill a whole group or a 50. Cal on a team of power armored people, the thread is for bugs and issues people have had with the new mode, balancing can be an issue, again I'm happy you've had no issues but as I said it's an example
---
Actually false advertising is illegal which they did with the canvas bag issue. Why do you think they backed down from the "we aren't going to do anything about it, to here is 500 atoms, to okay we're getting the bags out to you"?
---
Because what they did is extremely illegal in all of the EU under consumer protection laws.
---
He said defrauded people twice, so he is clearly talking about the canvas bag issue and the nuke dark scam.  Both of which absolutely legally fall under defrauding.
---
Oh  I see. Thank you.
---
Note it’s under challenges it just keeps up with the ones you have contracted.
---
&gt; Whereas in Fallout 4 I did actually care a good deal and got pretty darn invested.
---
But why?  It's the same exact structure, except that you get a human-looking NPC in Fallout 4 talking to you, and you get a holotape or robot or terminal in Fallout 76 talking to you.  That's the only difference.
---
fair. but ...but...
---
There’s a difference?
---
Dam, downvotes for asking a question.
---
I saw the new mode looks surprisingly decent on first glance, I’ve always really wanted to like this game just never found anything to hook me and keep me playing. I’ll give it a shot after work
---
Despite what the current crop of "anti-haters" keep pushing, it was a completely broken mess at launch. Not acceptably buggy or slightly offkilter, but basically broken. And it kept getting more so back and forth until February of this year. Each patch brought "fixes" that were a combination of real fixes, stealth nerfs and introducing new bugs. Oh and frequently reintroducing previously fixed bugs (like the infamous patch 5 that rolled back to an old version).
---
It's in a decent day 1 release state now. It still has a lot of bugs and horrendous UI choices (like tab and esc being used randomly as the quit submenu option, or R being used for drop, reload and transfer).
---
The release state was unacceptable. It's much better now, but pretending that it's been good since day 1 is a great disservice to people who actually played the game and had to constantly fight against the very engine just to do so,
---
I don’t understand why they haven’t implemented this already. The interest in the project paradise event is almost nonexistent now because there is no notification for it and you need a team. At least give us the server notification like encryptid so people know it’s happening. I would love to be able to select from a list of every event which ones I want notifications for, but would settle for sever wide notifications for the new events.
---
When I spawn in the vault, I just go find a chair and sit down and watch all the idiots punch each other. Reminds me of bum fights.
---
Can someone share what major changes made the game good again? 
---
I got the game opening day and the boring part was how little interaction I had with the World. I didn’t realize how attached I was with the typical Fallout 4 formula until I walked around 76.
---
One to one levels isn't the idea.  The idea is to have the range tight if possible so you don't have new or low level players getting constantly destroyed by high level players.
---
It would be one thing if there was any point to the multiplayer but there just isn't. A few perk cards for extra xp or some crap in a party but no real player-driven interactions. Because there's no actual ways to, beyond those dumb ass vendors.
---
If by chance you are playing when the server is acting weird then boots you. When you reconnect, go directly to the bunker.  I never found a jet pack mod or shocks mod by itself until I noticed every single time I log onto a server and it stutters, lacks legendary enemies and gives no loot for kills, its about to go down. Once it boots you and you reconnect, its always a fresh server (in my experience) and the shocks and jetpack are there IF you are the first to get there. Good luck, the jet pack is barely useful but those shocks are MONEY.
---
It's not ready...and it broke gun fu.
---
Partly because that question gets asked multiple times a day. Wasn't me tho
---
No, it's totally separate in that regard.
---
You have to be the last team alive. If all teams die at once, it's a stalemate.
---
Now that you seem to have found your stride with FO76... are there any plans to make FO5 a co-op campaign/ open world game?
---
God damn y'all sound like you're reading a script when you say shit like this.
---
Obviously that isn't true, if people didn't care it still wouldn't be an issue, yet it still is. So obviously it is a major issue for many.
---
I find the stage gets left alone most
---
It's a free week, so sadly people who dont want to lose their main account will do this just to feel superior.
---
That or since it's a free week they feel theres no real consequences to cheating.
---
You should get overseer points for matches that you can spend on cards you want. More powerful cards cost more points. Ok Todd, where's my check?
---
Solo players with low charisma unite!
---
How though? It dies almost instantly
---
Whore houses inbound boys!
---
Go watch Joseph Anderson's video called 1001 bugs of fo76 to get a feel what the game was like at launch. It was an absolute buggy mess.
---
I even completely uninstalled it last night and did a fresh download and i am still having the same problem
---
Fuck that I'm in love with this idea. Do it Beth.
---
Random number generator.
---
Wish your character specials weren't based on what you use for pve. I really dont feel like making a new char just for a better pvp loadout
---
He's an adult mutant.
---
Yeah, I've been trying out different places to see what works well. There's definitely a big advantage to knowing where the terminals, power armor, etc spawn. Flatwoods seems to be one of the best though, there are so many terminals and rare crates there
---
Dunno pal, just felt like it had a bit more substance, I cannot disagree at all that 76 has a lot of content. I just see a lot of filler like quests from Fallout 4 at the forefront of this game and not a whole lot else. Holotapes and robots just made the game feel, idk empty? Not trying to poke fun at your favourite game or anything, I just wanna know if it’s worth jumping into.
---
Thats amazing
---
Awesome that you think that.
---
I'm just a couple years younger than you, but this is the buggiest launch I've ever seen. This makes Diablo 3's connection errors or even WoW's month of lag at launch look paltry by comparison. No amount of whitewashing or ignoring the issues of many will make it go away.
---
I'm glad you love it. I still enjoy it despite the mountain of issues. But that in no way negates the massive disservice done to the fans by Bethesda. They've been able to slide for a LONG time due to world building and story telling skills... but that falls apart when much of the story is shuffled aside and the game is set up to be an MMO-like grind.
---
Todays inside the vault I'm sure
---
A behemoth dual-wielding fat mans (fat men?) would be cool. Dream big!
---
You don't trade or scrap them...the pack opens and it's says "duplicate card" then it disntegrates into ~~50 xp~~ a pile of ash
---
GASP. . . I cannot believe it's the canvas bag. 
---
Somebody pinch me!
---
I willing to help but I won't be home till 3 hours from now
---
It's no Van Vuren, for sure.
---
I agree though, the MMO term gets used all the time for games that aren't MMOs.
---
The game runs on cloud servers (AWS if I'm not mistaken). So there's a server for every 24 players, and players get added to existing servers as spots come available, and new servers get initialized as needed when there's no more spots on an existing server.
---
So total player population *shouldn't* have any impact on server stability. If anything, it's just new bugs introduced by new content/patches, which we've seen happen with literally every release since BETA.
---
Sad, I unfollowed this sub a while ago. Was under the impression that there was a super friendly community for this game
---
Ok, so they are released a couple days apart each?  I was worried I had missed something when I got a skin the first day and couldn't find a second one the next day.  But got the 45 last night.
---
And it's not as good as this sub's circlejerk likes to pretend.
---
They're good sloths, Brent.
---
See, the issue that I am bitter about is that this game has been released almost a year ago.
---
Is it going to become the norm to publish unfinished game and “have” the community fix it. That kinda scares me. TBF I kinda wish that FO76 would have failed so bad in order to teach a lesson to games company that this kind of releases just don’t pass with the community.
---
As you can tell, I'm a big fan. Nick Valentine is one of the most well written and memorable NPC characters I have come across in quite some time. Not to mention his voice acting is superb. DiMA added even more depth to the character. I'd rather imagine during this point in the Fallout lore we're at the end of the 2nd act of Nick's story.
---
So about 2pm Central
---
That's just the way the vocal minority of the br fanbase is. I fell into that a while back as well being a pubg fan, I always said fortnite is trash even though I didn't play it. Once I did try it out it wasn't even bad lol. Completely changed my perspective.
---
Can I grab a video or pic. I want to see.
---
I'm on PS4. I learned to make them before any other mods. Try taking some daytripper and wearing intelligence gear while scraping. My luck was 15 and my intelligence 8 ( not counting buffs) when I learned it. If you need me to demonstrate- I would be happy to tonight after 8p Texas time.
---
Because the game was a buggy barely playable mess at launch and has only slightly improved since. I downloaded this for the free week and the Battle Royale mode is more fun then the base game because you can actually use loot you pickup.
---
Great! Hopefully some luck or trading luck and ballistic explosive here I come :) Thanks for all the advice!!
---
It really should just say win a NW then cause whats the difference
---
It blends in a bit better if you want it as a form of camo though.
---
Only rank 3. Already got 4 duped cards. (Did camp/photo challenges for extra packs)
---
That's gonna help me out a ton. /s
---
It was a 5. Great concept, amazing environmental and level design (the most fun game I've ever explored... ever) and just so many loving touches like the various bear tableaus. But a fundamentally broken game experience from an engine and UI perspective at launch.
---
If we were just talking art, environment, VA and music... easily a 9, very close to a 10. But add in the rest of the broken aspects and 5 almost seems generous.
---
It really wasn't just bugs. A lot of the overall metagame, balancing, core gameplay loop etc were quite under-developed and half baked. 
---
I think a 6 or 7 at best would be reasonable, but I definitely agree it wasn't the 2 or 3 I often saw people claim.
---
Because the launch was a disaster, yet there is a vocal part of the community convinced that it was and still is just people bandwagoning against Bethesda. There are absolutely legitimate issues to be had with this game, the launch was not acceptable by any standard for its price tag or an AAA release (cue ''Anthem was worse''- if you're comparing it to *Anthem* of all things, that should be telling enough), and this went paired with numerous PR issues around that disaster of a launch, constant server instability, repeated stealth nerfs after promises to be more transparent, etc.
---
This sub gets this exact same post, slightly differently worded, voted to the front page *every week*. And always there's some well upvoted comment convincing everyone that it was just horde mentality. You're absolutely allowed to like the game, but there are some people who like it so much they'll ignore unacceptable bugs and stupid mistakes by the devs, and look down on people who take issue with them. Beth's definitely improved things, but whatever greedy fucks are running things at the top for them really didn't care about reputation over money, and it shows. The sort of people who ignore the criticisms out of their goodwill for Bethesda just play that kind of shitty behaviour further into power.
---
76's far too early launch was shitty move and Beth's reputation for buggy games is not an excuse for how broken things were. Then there's the recent period of ridiculously specific Atom challenges to show that they *really* wanted people to buy Atoms. They cooled down on that as of late, for sure, but that doesn't mean that sort of shitty treatment should just be forgotten about.
---
All that aside, I can still understand people enjoy this game. I hope you enjoy your way through Appalachia, because there's some pretty cool stuff out there.
---
For this discussion I'm going to reference the timeline that Todd Howard presented in the DICE 2012 Keynote.

It showed that design &amp; create time were shortened so more "Opportunity time" could be used. Play the game sooner, fix the issues there. Don't spend all of the time designing before you start to find the bugs while playing it. 
---
That's great in theory, but "Opportunity time" shouldn't be after launch. A paying customer should NEVER be playing a game during "Opportunity time". That's what it felt like. Like I was playing a game that was still being designed. That decision damaged your brand for some people, myself included. 
---
You can argue that since it's basically an MMO you won't know the big problems until people stress it. But to counter point that most good MMOs have months of testing to figure this out in closed betas. Months. 
---
I bought FO76 after watching MATN become Batman a few weeks after it launched. 
---
I enjoyed the game for a week or two but that was back in December 2018, and there were a lot of issues. I became very frustrated with the game, uninstalled it, and moved on. It looks like a lot of good things have been worked on since then and that's great, but the game wasn't ready at launch. It was still in "Opportunity time". If I bought a household appliance that had to be worked on for months before it was ready for daily use I'd swear off that brand for the rest of my life. 
---
Don't let marketing steer the ship. If you need to fix a game fix it. If that means taking it offline for a month, do what needs done. Utilize common sense more than the reports generated by the market research companies. I know many people that overtly lie to those companies just for the $100-$400 they pay surveyors. 
---
MATN put out a [2+ hour FO76 video essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W31mxU9s6MI) and I agree with 85% of his ideas. That's the FO76 I wanted to play at launch. I'd come back for that game. Sticking with your product and fixing what was broken at release is the least I'd expect from any company. For that you get  a head nod, not a parade. 
---
I'm not buying the next BGS game for at least four to eight weeks.  I want to see the reviews, read up on how the game is. I'm fed up with unfinished products being sold and patched later. Sell the game after it's polished. 
---
If it turns out that the next BGS game was sold while it was still in "Opportunity time" I will not buy it.
---
Are you giving him enough attention when you're home?
---
It’s implied - if your the last person/team a live, you win. Not sure where the confusion is in that statement.
---
That problem has been patched for months. All the patch notes are on bethesda.net
---
They’re everywhere!  You just have to look :)
---
I was having the same thought. Perk points should just be removed from the mode altogether.
---
Ok let me start saying that sometimes I give for a fact things that have been said in the past and don’t apply in the sense that present information do and that is totally my fault in the sense that this stuff is not usually what people tend to relate to other info, having say that... if you are not trolling and asking for real I will be more then happy to answer, so I guess what I really want to say is that before we didn’t have all the judgment we have seen recently from and for the community and that referring to this isnot only stupid but also could be misleading because of the work devs are doing with their games lately. I remember reading on reddit a user that posted three different discussions in less then a week and all of them became a pain in the ass for those who were in fact trying to work things out for them. It just seems weird to me.
---
edit:I guess this is not only me but others also and this people are the kind of people who dont deserve being insulted by devs with this kind of bugs when they have paid 60 dollars for their product.
---
In what way?  I've seen literally zero performance issues.
---
It's so they can collect all kinds of data, which they can then use to make any changes to the mode and the backend. Todd said he wished they had done a free BETA for the main game before launch, so they offered this for free. Also it's no coincidence they're doing a free week for all of it. They can get an influx of players to stress test/break the new mode and get more data.
---
steam has its own launcher..
---
if you are opposed to launchers.. you can always browse to the .exe on your HD and open the game with that..
---
Will check the game out after work, looking forward to trying it out after being absent from it for like half a year
---
Wow. I haven't seen that bug since the BETA when the spawns were screwing up. Ran into a herd of them at that waterpark up on the north end of the map. Then the game crashed.   
---
I wonder if the strain from all the trial players is causing issues on the servers?
---
I'm a Gage man myself. I'm pretty sure he can slaugther anyone who come near him himself tho.
---
I think they're just trying to gaslight new players coming for the free weekend. It's not that great. You're right, there's just nothing to do. There's not even any meaningful player interaction. The most player interaction you'll encounter is getting an extra bit of xp for being in a party or going to a player vendor.
---
I think it's just staying in the match till the end. Don't leave the game as it will close the lobby.
---
*jumps to the top of Seneca Rocks with super marsupial*
---
They do? It’s the sound of when you get a quest in adventure mode
---
I went looking for bloatflies once for that stupid scout leader...ended up attacked by 3 scorch beasts....NOT AMUSED! 
---
Top it all off...couldn't find any flies there...argh.
---
You are the one complaining.
---
Not me.
---
Sure
---
It can spawn on top of you and spam you to death almost instantly at times.
---
"Good job killing the scorched queen, baby. I just got word that another wendigo needs to be killed while wearing a clown suit."
---
Love, 
---
Preston
---
They're selling it for less than a third of the price not even a year after release. I'm skeptical that there's much profit.
---
I would rather have a 200lb account wide global mailbox than another stash increase..
---
hoard less.. sell more...
---
I'm running an AMD 8300 8 core, 16 gigs of high speed ram and a GTX 960. Not great frame rate (45 FPS min) but I really don't get very many frame drops.
---
Technically you complete a match when you're dead and out and if you spectate till the end you should get a completion but not a win and the challenges ask for completions not wins
---
Can you give me a link saying it will be taken down? I must gave missed that one.
---
Hopefully after the free week is over we can actually get teemed up with people who have a mic and communicate.
---
Y'all act about the same, just in the opposite direction.
---
My only issue was the end game, not much to do solo once you had to get the silo's and my other friends moved to other games.  I should come back and dick around in this game bounty hunting was fun.
---
Grats! I did as well. Twice.
---
Why do you care if others want it? Just dont use it if you don't want to.
---
Show me a game that Bethesda has personally polished. And not relied HEAVILY on the work on many unsung heroes in the form of modders.
---
No I've tried that doesn't count
---
You underestimate first impressions
---
Aid items are plentiful. Just sell what you won't use in the next few play sessions. Check your misc tab for gunpowder, it weighs a lot. Scrap all your junk down into the base components. Make sure you store PA pieces on the frame, since even a fully loaded frame weighs 10lbs, same as an empty one.
---
Noob Question: I hopped on for the free trial and bought this atoms pack. Where do I find my Elder's Battlecoat in game? (and do all my characters get it forever?)
---
I will log back in but frankly the reason I stopped is I feel like if I don't research a min-maxed build, every single enemy is a bullet sponge. Taking forever to kill dudes and spending all my money on ammo sucks.
---
No, that’s not correct - technically or absolutely. To complete a match, you must survive it.
---
Come on man, this is common sense 101
---
Yeah but... Fortnite bad
---
[ITV](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c070f5/fallout_76_inside_the_vault_e3_2019_roundup) is out, and doesn't include a roadmap.
---
This. 10000000000000000 times this.
---
ouch
---
You got it all wrong, hater. DAE this game is actually probably one of the best things ever made?
---
I couldn't agree with you more there. Playing Far Harbour I was not expecting to find a synth like DiMA, let alone them actually having some form of relationship. The thing I find quite sad about them both is that eventually they will run out of room for memories and have to start deleting old ones
---
And i have a right to my opinion just because it not the same as yours don't mean it a hater's but i do see your one of them people thatthinks your always right and everyone else's is wrong.
---
I would add to get a mic and call out enemy positions.
---
Game needed a whole nother year to cook. Everything this year being added as part of the base game would be great experience to start.
---
Link?
---
But you will still be able to level your character through PvP. Overseer XP and Adventure mode XP have nothing to do with each other. 
---
Just participating in NW gets you Adventure XP and caps.
---
You're best reading through the patch notes on the Fallout website (they're all linked here, you'd have to search). I'm unaware of a comprehensive list of bug fixes, but there's been a lot.
---
Bases still get stuck I'm afraid if there's someone already there. You can server hop or move it. Last time I moved my camp like that it moved intact fortunately, but normally I just find a new server.
---
But they weren't. This sub was almost overwhelmingly positive to a fault until the big bad patch in late January. Then shit hit the fan in the Bobbypinocalypse.
---
Go to an armor workbench and hit the "craft" button. It'll be in one of the sub catagories.
---
Welcome to the community!
---
:/ thanks
---
For the people who held off playing because there were no NPCs or any of the other content that's coming with the Wastelanders update, to start playing and then be told "wait a minute Buster you've gotta unlock all that" is insulting and borders on false advertising. 
---
IMO the better way would be to offer (like you said in your post) an option to new players to start with Wastelanders content enabled or disabled, with an option to enable it later. But. I doubt anyone starting after it launches will want to play without that content.
---
I played on release and loved it, as did many thousands of other people.  Out of all the bugs that were reported those first few weeks, I maybe got 2 of them, and they were fixed by restarting the game and losing like 3 minutes of progress.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
because nobody played it when it came out. it was always “this and this isn’t in the game so it’s bad” or “you can’t do this in the game so it’s bad” that kinda thing
---
That's the only bug I've encountered
---
When did I hate on the game? I genuinely enjoy 76, I just need Bethesda to put in some elbow grease and iron out issues like these.
---
Trying! I might have waited too long. Brb
---
This is why I think it should be optional. For those who hate it, it would go away...but for those that use it, they could use it to get buffs...like a risk/reward system. Both of best worlds for all, and more importantly it would bring in more players, never a bad thing.
---
At launch the game was a bugged mess with finite content. The game has gone a long way since then. 
---
Still waiting for the goddamn text chat, though.
---
It got better because after the initial hate storm ended, Bethesda got to stop doing crowd control and working on the game. They fixed many bugs, fixed the graphics, and started to work on more content such as DLC, NPCs, Nuclear Winter, and Survival.
---
&gt;before we didn’t have all the judgment we have seen recently from and for the community
---
Before what? I've been around since the beginning.
---
After the announcement, the community was divided.
---
After launch, the community was even more divided. The game got a lot of hate, some deserved, some undeserved. A good amount of people stuck around.
---
Now, one year since the announcement, things are really turning around for the game and most people are praising it now. 
---
Are these the judgements you are talking about?
---
There are dozens of us!
---
Because this is the internet, and bored nerds like to shit on everything new.
---
Thanks for the reminder!  I had completely forgotten about that.  I went a long time in FO4 before learning about it there.  I am a bit of a junk hoarder though.
---
If you're not even level 20, then dump **everything**. PA is everywhere, you won't want &lt;50 lvl stuff anyway. Scrap anything you can, and start crafting/scrapping the weapons you want now to unlock mods.
---
It's easier just to ignore these since they didn't happen to some people personally, right?
---
Heres ones I have that are not on your list so we can make a more complete one:
---
Strength - Blocker: Take 45% less damage from your opponents melee attacks.
---
Strength - Bullet Shield (3) - gain 60 damage resistance while firing a heavy gun.
---
Strength - Martial Artist: Your melee weapons weigh 60% less and you can swing them 30% faster.
---
Strength - Lock and load: Heavy guns reload 30% faster.
---
Perceptiom - Grenadier (3) Your explosives detonate with twice the radius.
---
Perception - Sniper: Gain improved control and hold your breath 75% longer while aiming with scopes.
---
Charisma (3) - spirtual healer: you regenerate health for 10 seconds after reviving another player.
---
Agility - modern renegage: gain excellent pistol hip fire accuracy.
---
Agility (9) - goat legs: take no damage from falling:
---
Luck - quick hands: gain 25% cahnce to instantly reload when your clip is empty.
---
Luck - pharma farmer: search any nuclear winter container for 80% chance to generate stimpacks/chems.
---
Edited my comment, see above.
---
That second one could have a slightly different name.
---
I need to make a sign for Hubert, my sloth. He is scorched though, much less hairy than Mr. Tickles. He even followed me into a Queen fight once. It was... confusing.
---
Uh this was me but not me, level 68 at the train station with an axe but there was no one else and I got all the stuff 500 pounds worth, why did he shoot back, I swear I wish I could give it back I feel so bad, if this was you and ur just changing the story I’m sorry, I was just joking around
---
maybe /u/Valseek or /u/Ladydevann could look into this?
---
I feel your pain, but I’ve gotten a little lucky with cards so I don’t really have room to talk, but I believe communication and good team tactics can overcome any obstacle in this mode. When I get on teams that talk and share loot, look out for each other and stay close, we win. It’s as simple as that.
---
get armor that has 20% weapon,junk, aid, etc. carry
---
Was it ever confirmed that we are getting one?
---
For sure, I’d like to think there aren’t bots.
---
People are literally invincible getting in power armor but no yeah flawless game mode 😂
---
It is. Up in the northwest corner area. Funny enough, you can put your camp down right on the vault area.
---
Thanks, I thought I was taking crazy pills reading the top responses (ok that's not true: I fully expected a lot of the people still in this sub after the earlier debacles to be the "I'm too invested to see it clearly" crowd. It's just natural that the people who got fed up with their previous decisions aren't even in the sub anymore.)
---
After having read about their earlier issues and now playing it myself in the free week...it's still boring as sin with some boneheaded UI moves and frustrating mechanics. The major stability issues have been fixed but at least the first 15 levels or so still feel like you're doing the same thing over and over again and the utter lack of NPCs or story-changes just don't feel like Fallout to me. I won't be buying it after the free week at this rate. Like you said, it's not _terrible_ but it's not super solid either. Just kind of meh with a veneer of Fallout.
---
Not making fun, I was asking.
---
Yea that’s exactly it. Thanks
---
I'd also add that the lack of text chat is game breaking for people with hearing/speech disabilities.
---
Can do! I've added the feedback you're all leaving in this thread to my notes. Thanks for the suggestions!
---
Hadn't noticed that -- but honestly why not just shoot them 2 seconds later..?
---
Man I only got the footage of tracking the last one. Trying to get it online. I’m on PS4 and have never done it so had to log in yada yada yada.
---
You are the one telling people to leave for having a different opinion than you.
---
Can't say I'm surprised the 76 fanboys come up with such incredibly stupid retorts.
---
I’ve done a lot. I learned the environment. I leveled up a lot. I explored most of the map. I’ve joined different factions, completed a shit load of events, and have built up quite a lot of stuff. I have walked in the parade. I burned Old Man Winter. I’ve completed countless challenges and finally got a few badges and my backpack / camera. I’ve nuked, and have been in countless nuke zones taking out ghouls and SBQs. I’ve made friends along the way, and I’ve also claimed  a lot of bounties. I mutated. I’ve grown. I’ve gone on runs to find Legendaries in preparation for the Purveyor, and have visited her regularly. I got drunk as fuck on Nukashine and blacked out. My character has done it all. And I could list more things too if you want. I enjoy it. Stop being a lemming bitch who just wants to complain.
---
Expands on it. ESO did something really similar
---
&gt; How one could expect a game this ambitious to NOT have bugs proves how many people have no clue how MMO games work
---
Then why not just delay release to have more time to fix it, if the beta alone was already such a telling disaster? It would cost more for further development, but it could have actually paid off and not made 76 an absolute joke to the point that it scared off a huge portion of their potential consumer base.
---
Blaming anger over an AAA release with such a horrible launch on ''lemmings'' and bandwagoning is also a pretty shitty thing to say to people who paid full price for this game only to endure at least two disconnects a day. Or items randomly disappearing, which was NOT a lie, as opposed to what many people who sound a lot like you said to people who had this issue. Or numerous other bugs that popped up with **every patch**, because clearly they didn't do all too much build testing before releasing builds into the wild. Some as easy to find as literally logging into the game or opening a crafting menu.
---
It's good to hear you enjoy the game, but that and your nostalgia with buggy games is not an excuse for Bethesda to flunk as hard as they did, nor to dismiss their absolutely deserved criticism in regards to that flunk. I've no doubt there's people who just saw critical youtube reviews of the game and went ''oh so it's shit''- THAT is the kind of bandwagoning I assume you're referring to. But please don't group that in with the plenty of people who actually played this game from its early days only to find out how they paid 60 bucks for a game that's only approaching that worth now, half a year after release.
---
Thank you, Bethesda.
---
Thanks for not giving up.
---
Thanks for putting your work out there, and sticking by it despite the negativity.
---
Thanks for your corrections and management of the multiple debacles and controversy that surrounded 76.
---
Your studio has given me some faith back in the gaming industry. So cheers, here’s to you, and us, moving forwards and upwards.
---
Thanks,
---
A long-time Bethesda fan.
---
Could be because it's released already and needs to be called something different.  Who really knows.
---
That’s not the point and really reveals a lot about how this discussion will go lmao
---
Get this post every few weeks. Even after increases. 
---
Hoarders will still run out of space, much like that person everyone knows who spends their entire paycheck in a week then broke till next one, no matter how much they make.
---
At first stash size was a shock to me from doing fo4 and skyrim. Then i just took a critical look at why i need 7 different fatmans and enough pipe pistols for each finger when i never use either.

 &gt; Can do! I've added the feedback you're all leaving in this thread to my notes. Thanks for the suggestions!
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4f9q90xXpnRJ8vlIWVJxVK/fallout-76-nuclear-winter-is-coming
---
Righteous thanks. Underwhelming for sure, maybe next week?
---
Duplicate cards make no sense. They said there's 75 perk cards I believe? Which means you would need to open 75 packs to get all of them which sounds more than a fair amount of grinding to unlock all the perks. Duplicate cards artificially extend this grinding by an insane amount.
---
Right thanks man big help
---
Yeah I don’t fancy going in mines much, do you get anything of use from them?
---
I have to relog to get mine to work properly in NW. In survival and adventure it works flawlessly.
---
I think they should reduce the weight of ammo entirely tbh. Or reduce junk weight slightly.
---
10 steel scrap weighs so much... but 10 scrap gets u nothing. Crafting some ammo can cost 12-40 -_-
---
Ammo weight I may get some flak on for asking for a weight reduction, but ammo weighs a lot as well.
---
Overall, The stash weight capacity shouldn’t increase because we don’t need even more server instability. We do need some weight reduction on junk or ammo.
---
If your onPC, there is a chat mod on the Nexus.
---
it's definitely not ready for prime time.
---
great!
---
if some one else can help me in the meanwhile I will let you know. :)
---
Sry but your just wrong there should be a difference between WIN and complete and your being a little rude but thanks for your opinion
---
Posters in the train stations
---
I completed 3 out of 5 today (finding the camera helped). It was noticable
---
Maybe he was born February 19, 2007
---
This is a sneak peak, so the devs will probably see what needs balanced and fixed during this period and see how the servers handle the new game mode. When the full DLC comes out, it may be different and be more fluid to go from adventure/survival into NW.
---
Which quest? Wild Appalachia is a collection of quests and additions to the game.
---
It's disabled unfortunately. Due to it being underarmor. Which is stupid considering it's cosmetic.
---
All?
---
The quests don't start automatically. You have to read a poster, and check your terminal.
---
Far as I remember theres the game mode, a vault dungeon and new events.
---
That is great news! I don't mind having to move to a new server for my base to have a spot to spawn. I just hated having to rebuild it piece from piece after moving to the new server that didn't have anything blocking the base.
---
And well tuned
---
RAM is fine and file integrity seemed okay. Bethesda support said they have heard otrhers had the issue from the response i got this morning
---
Go to a Trainstation and read the posters. 
---
Good luck.
---
Yeah, I'm not a fan of the RNG.
---
I'm only Rank 5, but I've done several challenges and have pulled several support perks.  
---
Rather than post my build, I just wanted to mention how INCREDIBLE Pharma Farma and Scrounger have been.  80% chance to pull extra chems (including Stims) AND extra ammo every time I find a loot container, even if it's already been looted.  And it can proc multiple times on a single container.  I've pulled a Stim, a Med-X, some 40 mm grenades and some .45s all with the quick push of a button.  Being able to then share all that with my team has been invaluable.
---
Most other support perks are situational, but these are too useful to pass up, for sure.
---
I'll have to try that thanks :)
---
Fallout has realistic settings, its definitely a hallmark of the series.
---
Im hesitant to give away my secret for upper floor growing, here's a hint: explore the edges and intersections....
---
I just finally got it on PS4
---
Is there a quest per train station?
---
Thanks for the info! I dont mind if I have to server hop to get my base to appear. The original problem would cause the base to never spawn again once it couldn't spawn once.
---
Blocker (1) Take 45% less damage from your opponent's melee attacks
---
Perception
---
Lock Detector (6) Nearby active terminals appear on the compass
---
Intelligence
---
Pharmacist (1) RadAway removes twice as much radiation
---
Wrecking Ball (1) You deal +120% damage to workshop objects
---
Stabilized (9) In Power Armor, heavy guns gain excellent accuracy and ignore 45% armor
---
If I ever take the power plants, I leave the extractors unlocked. Even the fusion core one. Then I leave a “take some” note on it. I really only need like 7 or 8. Who ever shows up while I’m away elsewhere on the map playing, can grab until I’m offline.
---
I'm going to miss it when it's gone. They should just leave it up, and release a complete version along the regular timeline.
---
You sir, are both a gentleman and a scholar. Acknowledging your goodwill and humanity, so that you can continue to do great deeds. I wish you all the scrip your character can handle, and may you always get dank rolls.
---
I'd be lying if this didn't make me laugh, it's scarily accurate though
---
I get a lag spike when I try use quick build stuff from the favorite t wheel.
---
Back in December this sub was the worst. There was a whole phase at the time of people writing resignation letters like playing this game was some type of sacred covenant we had with Bethesda. Like we were a council of Reddit elders and the only hope was for Bethesda to completely abandon the IP and let modders fix it. The amount of unnecessary drama was staggering. We knew then most of those players would be back.
---
The lesson here is that sometimes you should just take a break from a game rather than treating your disappointment with it like a break up. So I think with this sudden "76 is good again!" Is a little dangerous : the game was never really that bad, but people love to complain on the internet so it was cool to hate on it. You're learning the wrong lesson about the situation. The game didn't turn around, you could have been running a Mothman cult the entire time, albeit with less server stability back then. It was your emotions that changed. You settled down and remembered it was a video game. Maybe next time we can collectively skip the histrionics.
---
No, they are all the same. Each station has all of the posters
---
The Tactical Suit isn't compatible.  You can't bring in an Underarmor, atm.
---
&gt;in ass less chaps.
---
All chaps are ass-less.
---
God bless
---
That's what brings depth to both characters. It's the past and the foreseeable tragedy that makes players empathize with them. For all the heat Fallout 4 receives Bethesda should at least receive props for bringing to life such a great NPC.
---
I'm expecting it next week after the N.W. Sneak peek ends.
---
I presume they only talked about N.W. and Wastlanders DLC, because their priority was bringing in new/former players, rather than current players.
---
Hopefully they aren't postponing the content they mentioned already (Two Vault Raids, Legacy System, CAMP Displays)
---
I've seen no varying levels of cards, only one card of fixed costs.  I think you might be imagining things.
---
I'd say adult casual - its a great middle ground between Fortnite and PUBG.
---
Why not?
---
NW:BR needs a lot of improvements. A lot of the current mechanics probably need to be reworked i.e. needing to play PvE to readjust builds, hit boxes, insanely low revive times, using picture mode to get FoV... etc.
---
Fun but needs a lot of QoL, so it makes sense that this was a demo. I'd say they should take it down and bring it back with fixes/improvements etc.
---
I don't think you understand what I mean.  
---
For example, games like Rainbow Six Siege still require the Ubisoft Launcher even if you buy it on Steam.
---
I was not telling you to leave. I was suggesting it, however. 
---
Btw, that was not a retort. Just stating a fact. Calling it stupid would also be in poor taste, or even childish.
---
They should think about just offering other types of cosmetics that are in the backpack slot and function as a backpack but look different. Like wings, satchels and strap purses, quivers, animated pet critter you're carrying on your back... :P
---
Dang, I was hoping the Double XP applied to Nuclear Winter too.  Got to grind for those rewards!
---
YUP if noticed that as well, its probably due to how it's still opening up the camp system
---
I’ve been playing since launch. The launch of the the game was terrible, and they never should have released it in that state. But they have fixed most of what was wrong and added more content, so the game is WAY better than what it was
---
Ha why are you hesitant to share? We're a sharing community 😁 That's interesting though. I'm keen to explore that.
---
My guess is, they weren't 100% how well it would work or the reception they would get. I'm sure in a week or 2 they'll flesh out when we expect to have it back online, and possibly improvements they intend to make
---
Yea but you don’t get the full picture with just “chaps”
---
While I've grudgingly enjoyed NW battle royale, I really hope that they can announce other PVE stuff of worth that will fill the gap until Wastelanders.  If NW is all we're really getting, I'm going to be seriously disappointed.
---
I use psn chat.
---
Since they released game right before ada complience became mandatory i dont think they ever will.
---
The Launch Was Crappy, as it has improved there are still bugs and small lag, but yes I played the game for a full 4 months when it came out and just hoped back on, it still needs improvement but its worth checking out
---
I dont like the idea of the pvp part. That sounds real bad to me.
---
I would like to see a completely pve permadeath mode. But only once all the bugs and glitches which can cause death are gone.
---
There is an extreme lack of awareness or empathy among the current crop of glad handing posters. If it didn't happen to them, it didn't happen... EVER.
---
So this critical and honestly basic missing feature isn't an issue since they don't need it.
---
Same reason why every other beta is taken down after a short period of time
---
No. 800 is very workable and more than we had at the inception.   Once you get more hours in the game, you will sort out these issues.
---
&gt; *Laughs in Fallout 2*
---
Which came out in... 1998? When people were connected, downloading and the internet was becoming a thing?
---
I don't remember day 1 patches for Silent Hill or Grand Theft Auto Vice City.  I remember them just working out of the box.
---
Am I the only one who's 18?
---
Yea now when you enter a server that has someone taking your camp spot, it gives you a warning message telling you that before the server does anything to your camp. After that, it gives you a choice to either find a new server or play on the current server and move your camp.
---
I belive you, but where did you get that mask? Did you drop it by yourself or you bought it from someone?  
---
I'm only saying that probably whoever sold it to you, duped it.  
---
During Fasnacht throught data mining, tests and pure farming has been established that this mask was almost unattainable and the only few masks that got out where from the Dev Room.  
---
I know that this was only ment to be a funny post about roleplaying, but it just seemed weird to me that a CM was ignoring the fact that this mask was duped, it's nothing personal.
---
I'm starting to doubt if there even will be one, the new cinematic screen doesn't have anything except NW and there are some other small evidence supporting this.
---
Scrap everything, sell what you dont use and bulk your junk. 
---
I'm 160 and it's not often I hit the limit of 800 just try not to hoard as much. 9 chances out of 10 by the time you get to the level of the weapons you want to use everything you craft and find at that point will be better anyway.
---
I am amazed how many people don't talk on pc. I get about 1 every 2 groups. Im not trying to be a strategic champion or take lead.  But a little communication would be nice otherwise its 4 guys running around wildly getting picked off till were all down.
---
Do you have a source on them actually using AWS? 
---
Not trying to be critical, just curious and couldn't find any reference to where they're servers actually were or who they were using. Other then a bit that Pete or Todd said once about the servers being on "the cloud" which just means that they'd be renting server space from a farm somewhere instead of running their own.
---
And don’t forget Graham. He’s one of my favorite NPC’s of all time.
---
You’ll enjoy it for some time, I’d be willing to bed. Keep in mind it’s an MMO, not a strictly fallout experience. The biggest difference I noticed is how loot works. You don’t always get what you think you’re going to get, but for the most part you’ll get things you want just not soon after you start playing. I wanted to go out and find an assault rifle as soon as I started playing, took me more than a few days to figure out you can’t til you’re like 25ish.
---
Please stop replying to this person they are literally here just to try and stir shit up, they've been doing nothing but that here in this subreddit.
---
I usually have this image I toss at the Facebook posts with the haters 
---
https://i.imgur.com/pcbPfQU.jpg
---
he isnt being rude at all lol he is speaking the truth and you are ignoring the very obvious answer.
---
Because it was fucking trash.
---
The in-game idea is definitely so people could build a base for themselves, or else the budget would be higher than what we have. Lore-wise, we’re supposed to be rebuilding those current settlements. We might get the ability to create T.O.W.Ns in the future, would be fun to manage it like SimCity/Sim Settlements.
---
Not occasionally.
---
But if they did a Special Event for a few days or a week, I think it can actually be interesting.
---
I'm running to the store in like 15 mins but I can help you until then I have a small body of water next to my cap so it'll be easy
---
There's a free trial going on. You can see if you like it.

Have you thought of what the family wants. Do you think somebody going through mourning want a nameless anonymous   man on the internet to bring attention to their grief because you think it would be nice. While insulting the family by saying he should be remembered by a skeleton on a motorcycle. Are you that stupid?
---
Yeah, I thought it was just Austin as well until I read the post from Aten_Ra a couple days ago.
---
Unfortunately that’s not a bannable offense...
---
Depends on the stars...
---
This is probably for the people who has not followed E3, getting them up to date. Next week or week after we might get some new nice inf or hopefully a more detailed roadmap.
---
The framerate is still way too choppy for me. Anyone have any tips for fixing the framerate issue on PC?
---
Daniel is definitely Preston Garvey’s great-grandfather. ;)
---
I hope nuclear winter is not only the battle royale. Currently we know more about wastelanders than this. Also, visiting vault 51 in adventure mode would be cool
---
ahh shit gotta try those two perks now.. totally wrote them off as useless! ive had so much more success when working as a team though and that includes sharing meds around with people when you see they are low on health or high on rads.
---
Lol...seems obvious right?
---
Unfortunately, Im not surprised at all theres already a handful of hackers.
---
Best thing to do is directly reply to bethesda support and show them your evidence
---
Tell them you want to play alone. 
---
Honesty is a pretty neat concept. 
---
Hiding from me feels shady, and I might drop you from my list.
---
Take your toxicity back to youtube bro, your entire post history is literally downvoted because of how immature you are acting in a place trying to look at things in a positive light. People are here because they enjoy a game and want to be part of the positive side of the community over being part of the negative.
---
Could that be among the reasons they rushed the release of the game? 🧐
---
That’s be great! I just accepted your friend request.
---
Holy shit yes! That is amazing and exactly what was needed! Im looking at photos of bases from the news section on 76's website. Did they also increase the build limits? These bases seem to be packed with content when I could barely fit a few guns and some walls.
---
Let’s just say launch was different
---
And cross platform while you’re on it pls
---
My world or yours?
---
Now they're arguing semantics because they have no real argument, what a total joke. Trying to convince yourself that a fact and a retort are somehow mutually exclusive, now that's stupid.
---
Trying to join your world now.
---
What are the limits on the free trial? X amount of hours, X amount of levels gained, or something specific?
---
Not a surprise at all. Welcome to Beta.
---
I should have never even tried the PC version during free week. I mean, I'm only level 30 or so on PS4 and still have a lot of the map to explore... but the PC version is better and I don't really feel like doing all of it over again...
---
i just dont want them to patch it!  ive said too much already!
---
calgon, take me away!
---
Anything you can do to help is great, but at the bare minimum not hindering your team is what we're hoping for
---
I’ll grant them that the launch was shit, but unlike Anthem’s team, they kept at it and the game has greatly improved.
---
But some people just want to be crybabies their whole lives.
---
I've got 4 or 5. 9 point perk cards. Can't equip any of them because I don't have 9 points in P, E, C, A, L... I just hope my next perk card (which is 4 levels away) isn't another dupe card.
---
Read the patch notes, this: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bn33ul/is_this_worth_buying_or_coming_back_to_the/ or the numerous posts of this same question posted multiple times a day.
---
you come back with about 75% to 80% radiation if you die
---
Being Overseer rank 37 already, I’ll say one thing, perk cards almost do absolutely nothing.
---
If you are good, you’ll do just as good with starting perk cards as a build you made yourself.
---
I have a shotgun/heavy gun build right now and the Gatling takes just as many bullets as it does without the 40% extra damage, which is 3-4 depending on the armor.
---
Dang, how are we supposed to do that with 3 days left of the mode???
---
I got my copy off of amazon and the case was in Spanish but luckily it is not region locked so it played fine
---
A google times even.
---
It's a real number!! Looks it up kids :)
---
There is none it ends the 17th. You can get the game for ten bucks on GameFly with no shipping right now too lol it’s a no brainer
---
Haha. Well I appreciate the incredible risk you took!
---
I’m also unclear as to what the post is about.   
---
Are you asking if we believe the hype about future DLCs and the roadmap?   
---
I take any future plans with a grain of salt simply because there are too many unknown factors.  For me, summer is here, so I won’t be paying any attention for the next couple of months.  Whether I come back to the game in the fall will depend on the new story lines and how engaging they are. 
---
As for the release of Elder Scrolls 6, I’m very disappointed that there has been no further news other than the standard statement “we are working on it but it’s a long way off”.    
---
They know that as soon as they release Elder Scrolls that they would immediately lose half the player base of Fallout 76.   I’m thinking that they want to build the Fallout brand to the point where players will come back to it before releasing Elder Scrolls 6.
---
On server, fast traveling to your camp
---
This [article](https://www.pedestrian.tv/gaming/bethesdas-todd-howard-gave-us-the-scoop-on-how-fallout-76-will-work/) says that Todd Howard said they use Amazon cloud servers at E3 last year.
---
I wonder if his killable?
---
thank you for listening!
---
Gotcha
---
Yes please. My wife lost interest in the game immediately after some lvl 315 in power armor started to run around us, showing off. It kills all the immersion. Matchmaking should pair you with players of similar level.
---
I love having internet friends to die with!
---
John Henry NEEDS to be a robot, though. 100%.
---
It’s a troll, the sad loser made a whole thread of responses claiming the game is garbage, yet now claims you’re the hater.
---
Ignore the child and they’ll find something else to do.
---
INDEED i DID
---
The same reason it took me thousands of technical data dropoffs to get my Brotherhood Elder power armor paint and the other guy got it  after 50.
---
RNG  hates you and is punishing you because it  can and for no  other reason. Welcome to the brutal world of MMO gaming.
---
Such a good game. Such a fantastic, lovingly crafted RPG.
---
Ah okay, good to know! I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised that the community is so great, most people in r/fallout just slag FO76 off and that's why I haven't touched it up until now but I'm glad I've finally picked it up. Good advice for griefers though, same thing applies to Red Dead so shouldn't be too new.
---
So I just realized there is a challenge for deploying camps ten times separate from the daily one. There are a bunch of challenges, actually. Definitely worth having a look.
---
I would hope not. I think they put it out at time they did hoping to catch the black friday, cyber monday buyers. Rather than later when parents and friends already had bought xmas presents.
---
T-throw away steel!? You heathen. I need to make as much 5.56 and recently .45 ammo as I possibly can. The bottleneck is always lead, but I can’t part with my precious steel.
---
yup
---
I was having this problem also and I used the  the console to check the file integrity and it hasn't happened since.  Go to the Bethesda launcher and poke around until you find it
---
Fallout 76 [deadzone](https://imgur.com/Ya35omu) | [dotgraph](https://imgur.com/l8Z8j5M)
---
The deadzone is large, but the biggest thing is the heavily restricted diagonal movement.  When making precise adjustments you only have access to 4 directions.
---
Acceleration feels fine overall, though hard to tell anything specifically because of the wonky angles and the jump is common in other games.
---
Yeah, I already had to move one point around on my main character, I might have to do more later. XD
---
I wish I could say the same about Anthem.
---
We're still in a free trial period so if you're curious about the game, you can play it for free for the next few days. If you don't like it, no harm done.
---
Glad I'm not the only one with this issue. Hopefully this isn't somehow permanent.
---
He is absolutely part of a generating revenue group (as a business) but he absolutely didn't say what you are claiming here, you are just hearing what you want to hear.
---
I was absolutely around for beta. The worst part was dealing with dupers crashing servers.
---
I'm taking no offense, and hope you aren't either.  For whatever reason I've decided that YOU'RE the guy I'm going to answer the question for.  I have no idea why I've decided that.  
---
To answer "is it worth it" you have to get to know that particular individual.  The game isn't intrinsically worth anything.  No game is. Its worth has to be determined on a basis of the person who's wanting to invest in it.  I'm trying to analyze what it is that you liked about Fallout 4 that didn't carry over.
---
What I'm getting here is that the difference between "a bunch of pixels that look like a holotape" and "a bunch of pixels that look like a human" are the difference maker for you.  One makes you feel uninvested and one makes you feel invested.  Otherwise it's the same exact experience; it's just the way that /u/seanyuhh feels in response to the way the pixels are presented.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's what I'm getting as your primary pain point.
---
If that's the case, then no, you will not feel invested in the main storyline of this game ever.  This Fall when they add the Wastelanders DLC, maybe that will change.  But if I've read your tastes correctly, this game *simply does not have* the feature you need it to have to feel invested in it.  Therefore, for you, it is not worth it.
---
True, I just got really pissed that the mode just started and already there are people ruining it for everyone. I guess I didn’t put too much thoughts in my post. Sorry about that.
---
I just picked it up this week and I've been enjoying it so far (I last played during the B.E.T.A.). With the upcoming Wastelanders update and the Nuclear Winter mode (if you're into such things) it's definitely worth getting into.
---
Don't be alarmed if you do order it and receive a European copy (the PEGI classification on the front will be a giveaway). That's literally the extent of the differences, it'll be fine on an American console or PC.
---
You have less than 6 gigs of ram? damm dude it's 2019 have at least 8 gigs
---
47 here have 1400 hours and still going
---
Its smart. I dont shoot till i know i have a chance
---
Yeah seen this on the bridge once too, they use the pa suit like a wall getting in and out.
---
an exploit literally is a cheat
---
Rifleman card is naturally more powerful than the adventure counterpart, it just poofs and you get xp
---
Because it had many issues at launch. And still has many. It's still very enjoyable but that doesn't mean that things that are wrong shouldnt be called out.
---
Free all week, just check it out and decide for yourself. You'll lose nothing but time. Then you can decide if it's worth your money. I personally love it, but that's just me.
---
I’ve said this a few tones as well. LVL13 now and only have a couple cards that aren’t duplicated giving me a whopping 50xp. RNG on the cards is annoying but I can deal with it knowing I’d get them all eventually. But when it’s duplicate after duplicate it’s not ok and shouldn’t even be possible. Cards should never be dupes unless you literally have them all.
---
That's where I fuck up.  I shoot when I think I have a chance.  Which I really don't.
---
Well if you didn't play the game at launch then why are you evening asking? The game was atrocious.
---
Not if you are good.
---
You got me.
---
well this is the point of the sneak peak, to get the bugs out
---
Thanks very much!!!! Let me know if I can do anything for you.
---
Understandable. I honestly don't mind 4 man. I just wished there was an every man for themselves version of it. Thanks for the feedback😁
---
I just wanted to start a flame in your heart, but now the world is burning and everyone is killing each other.
---
You guys gotta stop giving Bethesda these ideas.
---
I play lots of fps games. I just use my play style from that
---
I assume you don't get the rewards as plans? :p I'd like to have some of them but I'm not bothered going into BR :'D
---
No prob m8 I just enjoy helping people I don't expect anything in return lol
---
Atom shop backpack items are skins only unfortunately.  Sorry
---
No worries, I had a suspicion, thanks!
---
Bethesda games use _d in textures for diffuse, also known as color. Often there will be multiple files for each model, because there’s many images that can make up a single “texture”. 
---
I’d wonder more about why some of the other ones are black and white. Maybe just placeholders.
---
You can pick 4 luck cards if you have the luck.  It’s not 1 per stat, maybe you know but not obvious to all.
---
You still need to earn the plans for the backpack. Atom Shop stuff is purely cosmetic (besides repair kits).
---
I'm 16 lmao
---
Bethesda is pushing hard for it's own launcher, they're not going to release it on steam.
---
Still need to find a way to get purifiers off ground level, the old floor mat got patched. Oddly enough, the floor mat still works fine for windmills.
---
The skin is for a backpack you have. Get the backpack first and then apply the skin
---
This. I was really hoping that they release the summer roadmap today but now i don't believe they will which is unfortunately, to say the least. 
---
They need to keep the momentum alive or they will fall into the cracks again
---
I get booted maybe once a week or once every two weeks on PS4 and my shitty 5mbs WiFi
---
It's definitely not bad. As far as gameplay it works pretty well, at least when I played a couple years ago. 
---
Just not my type of game, I'm not crazy about third person shooters, and I'm really not crazy about going 1v1 with Bob the builder in a shootout. It adds a whole different mechanic to the game that I can't get competitive at.
---
No limits, it ends on the 17th.
---
Lol I'm the same. Got 2 kills first match and maybe 3 total the other 15 or so matches
---
Hard to say without knowing your build, but as long as you don't have 15 points in intelligence it should be salvageable.
---
[We’re pleased to announce that RAGE 2, Wolfenstein: Youngblood, Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot, and DOOM Eternal will be released on Steam. We will also be bringing Fallout 76 to Steam later this year.](https://twitter.com/bethesda/status/1110225138979651584)
---
I do that when nobody on the team has a mic.
---
I have 8 luck, but it wouldn't let me equip more than one 1point luck card!
---
I will say at launch it was very different but know the game is great
---
1067 Rodger that.
---
would be helpful if you tell us what platform you playing on buddy 👍🏼
---
It seems to be a larger issue on PC apparently.
---
you make friends bro! That's like my favorite thing about this game. I started solo, and now have a great crew of dudes i can count on to have my back when problems arise, or pose for pictures when atoms do :)
---
You'll have better reception posting this on r/Fallout
---
I love how pissed off you get and how personally you take it that someone else has a different opinion than you.
---
The game is nothing special and you just described doing a bunch of the same stuff over and over, half of the things you said are just very basic, fundamental components of any RPG. You leveled up a lot? Wow! Oooh, you claimed a lot of bounties? You did COUNTLESS challenges and daily events, REGULARLY?! Wow, how groundbreaking! You've GROWN?! The fuck does that even mean, that's just straight up padding the list which you wouldn't have to do if there was legitimately plenty there to choose from.
---
And then to top it all off, you felt the need to insult me personally. Yeah, what a great community you've got here. At least you don't just blindly echo one another's sentiments about how great this game is and how everyone is just a hater and any criticism of the game is just haters.
---
I literally just read that whole thing and it didn't say they are taking it down.
---
Closest thing that could be misinterpreted would be the first part saying you will see something new from the 10th to the 17th. That is for the new players free play.
---
Actually we should be writing this note to you.   
---
Thank you for keeping the game going and constantly making it better! 
---
As they say "Almost heaven"
---
It dosent do it if I select it from my pipboy.
---
This is TV I'd watch.
---
Thanks, im on PS4 though, is it a trial week on there too?
---
Lag...   online games are not well suited to really difficult gameplay simply because of poor server performance and internet congestion.   
---
If you want to play a similar type of game, try the Dark Souls series.  When you die you lose your progress in that level and have to start over at the beginning.  
---
A game like that would never work online because the key battles require twitch reflexes and any amount of lag would just kill the experience.
---
Thank you! I will
---
You clearly haven't even played the game... like seriously what kind of bull is this?
---
2k the most for noobies. I got a 3 star level 50 for sale
---
When you get high enough level, I suggest getting the Portable Power 3 perk that reduces power armor chassis weight by 75 percent (2.5 lbs). You'll have to keep this perk equipped permanently though. On that same note, store all pieces onto the chassis, because the chassis with or without pieces weighs 10 pounds.
---
Exhibit A: Sorry for your downvotes friend. After two days, I couldn't stand the game anymore and uninstalled it myself.
---
I haven't figured that one out yet. Let me know if you do!
---
Yes, all platforms. Was announced at e3, free from 10th to 17th. So players get a sneak peak at the new battle royale mode. Search "fallout 76 trial" on ps store.
---
If Twitch is anything to go buy games full of 50+ year old hicks on the mic.
---
I won a game with grabbing one weapon and some stims.  Hiding, moving when the fire got too close, rinse and repeat, next thing I know it's me and one other player for overseer.  The player hides like me till the end and I got some grenade launcher shots off.  I won.  I have also hid for most of the game and came in 2nd place five other times.  But, I do actually go out with my team more often then not and go crazy, constantly moving.  You got to mix it up for fun!
---
Anytime. If ur on xbox and need help with something hit me up gt is same as name here
---
That’s what I did once in a solo match. Was able to hide for the whole game until it was just me and a team of 4. Died as soon as I took a shot. I kick myself for not trying to stay hidden and see what happens.
---
Purely because it was the cool thing to do. Most of the points people complained about were either blown out of proportion or flat out wrong.
---
True, the game was pretty buggy at launch, but it was honestly still better than something like fnv at launch. Some people had a bad experience with crashes/disconnects in their first half hour and decided that's what the whole game is like. It didn't help that there were youtubers fanning the flames for that sweet ad revenue. The game now is the same game as it as on launch with a bit more content and moderately more stable. Usually it's not too hard to tell when somebody shitting on the game has never actually played it
---
I suspect it might have been an earlier version of the Flatwoords NW map? Note the grid and the oddly colored squares, that looks more like dev stuff than something they'd show in the actual game. And I believe "_d" just has something to do with the type of .dds graphic the file contains.
---
I would absolutely LOVE a control point style mode, though! A full-map faction war, like STALKER: Clear Sky/Call of Chernobyl or Planetside 2 would be AMAZING.
---
I quit after my camp got removed by the server. I finally got back into the game this week and I'm having a blast. Still had a few crashes, but I never lost hope; I was just really depressed lol.
---
You're level 30 that won't take long and you have alot to explore still make the switch it's worth it.
---
As a lifelong biker (so far... 37 years of it) and lifelong Fallout fan (22 years so far)...
---
HELL NO! I'd love to be a skeleton on a bike in game. And so would my family.
---
The *real* endgame
---
When you say foursome I think of an orgy on fire.
---
Oh sweet thanks
---
I'm mainly doing solo and trying to get the backpack too. If you're on PC, we could help each other out on that one.
---
Sounds like my rotty.
---
And even despite the bugs, the number one issue most people had was with the content. Claiming that "it's not a real game" until Wastelanders finally releases, which is certainly one step up in lunacy compared to a "not a real Fallout game."
---
So even if it launched like this today (barring the new BR mode), it would still have been slammed with harsh criticism. Some reviews gave it a low score because it wasn't a single player game, that they couldn't just save scum or that it's always online because it's a multiplayer game.
---
It has a date span. Clearly indicating that it'll be around for that period of time. I don't know how else to spoon-feed you the information. Watch the E3 announcement on YouTube.
---
earth is flat.. gotta get to the other side somehow...
---
The only thing stopping me buying this game on multiple platforms is the amount of time I've put into the xbox version.
---
If I could bring my save over to pc I would do so.
---
Same here. Must be bugged.
---
Everyone that was involved in the trading scene got that mask on xbox. It spread like wildfire on the last dupe wave. Practically the same value as toothy now.
---
You can change your username on the account page on the Bethesda website. 
---
I'm at work at the moment, so I can't give you specifics... and I'm not sure how it works on console, but I've changed mine successfully.
---
You're right on that, because unlike them we actually played the game for a reasonable period of time; any real player covering 76 properly sees the game in a positive light now. These people are reporting on reports, not reporting from front line testing and experience of any meaningful length.
---
I’m on Xbox, so that’s cool, my gt is DjangoParker .
---
Yes, I know. My point is that you get so much Adventure XP and Caps from NW, that its a refreshing change from having to play Adventure mode solely for new Characters when you’ve already done that several times. Was I not clear enough?
---
Just pick up everything, sell what you don't use.
---
I play with my roommate a lot, I only have 1 charisma.
---
I’m on Xbox I’m afraid pal!
---
[I know that feel](https://imgur.com/HXKYFFO)
---
If they "take it off the store", then that is a sale as well.
---
Pretty standard scheme in Atomic Shop - New Limited Time item, then back again for limited time, then back again with discount, then back again "take off store" discount. Pretty much same with non-time limited items.
---
However I don't believe in all that take off the store stuff, only if it's something really generic like a cap, then maybe, in other cases pretty sure it will return as limited offer again and again until it's purchased.
---
100% sure there will be a bigger discount for Mini Deathclaw Statue, that is how I got the Mini BOS Statue.
---
I'm a long time fan of Fallout since 2. I've loved every single intance of it, despite the criticsm, despite the bugs, it's the world that always reel me in and keep me inmersed for hours and hours.
---
Originally, I've skipped 76 because I was influenced by the bad press and the multiple reviews against it. Now I'm playing the freee trial and boy I'm loving every single thing of it. I'm running it with a couple of friends and our adventures are amazing so far. From hunting a wanted vault dweller for just 5 caps to explore an abandoned power plant and irradiate my ass off trying to fix it.
---
Sadly, my fun will end with the free trial. Now I'm in an economic position where I cannot buy the game, even with the massive discount, I'm a gamer, but before that, I'm a father.
---
IMHO, F76, now is a worthy addition to the Fallout Legacy, might not be the best, but deffinitely is not the worst.
---
(Sorry for the typos, I'm still learning :P)
---
Awh man, if you enjoy the lore but don't have the want to play the older games check out oxhorn. That man does an amazing job with the lore.
---
They haven't said yet, as far as I know.
---
One day we'll be speaking with games the way we do our other electronic software.  The NPCs will have to react accordingly.  That'll be kinda neat, and lead to much unintentional hilarity.
---
That’s exactly what we will be doing after we win.
---
If people buy this game after playing the free week expecting to continue to play Nuclear Winter...people are going to be *pissed.*
---
We need clarification on what "sneak peek" means.
---
edit:  /u/kindofsquishy I have friends thinking of buying this so they can continue to play Nuclear Winter.  Does the game mode really go away in a week?  I don't want to encourage them to buy it if that's the case - they are only really interested in the battle royale mode.
---
Oh god, nuclear winter in the mire...I'm kind of scared of whether or not they decide to add in berry mentats to the mode, that would 100% be a game changer there
---
Shame. Good luck though.
---
Have you found the camera yet?
---
Good thing is that you can see his screen and name, so, easy to bethesda to ban those cheaters and make the game more clean.
---
Oh I've seen super mutants spawn in groups like that in the woods, maybe they can spawn behemoths too.
---
You too! Nope, that’s my next venture! Is it easy?
---
I dunno… but it's gonna be awfully hard to justify why that NPC I killed yesterday is back today, saying the same stuff.
---
It wasn’t because it was “the thing to do.” The game was trash at launch. The graphics and rendering were a joke and still is to some extent. People with some of the best PCs on the market couldn’t run the game. There were no NPCs. All the story was hidden behind holotapes. The PVP system is a joke and kinda still is. There were glitches in the game imported from fallout 4 that STILL WEREN’T FIXED! Bethesda gave pre order people low quality handbags and lied about it. I could go on and on about why the game was garbage. People had justifiable reasons for not liking the game. 
---
Bethesda still didn’t fully apologize for the fallout 76 mess at E3 but basically said, “Hey I know we messed up and we deserved the hate, BUT MOBILE GAMES, OH BOY LOOK AT THIS MOBILE GAME! DID SOMEBODY SAY BATTLE ROYALE? I THINK THEY DID!
---
It was buggy, Especially on consoles and people wanted to be edgy and hate on it because it was so different than Fallout 4.
---
Sure it had some flaws, but they were addressed rather quickly.  
---
Personally I play on a high end gaming PC in 4k, and saw very few issues at launch. Mostly stretched bodies and servers going down and some quests were bugged. Older PCS and consoles saw the bulk of the issues.   
---
TLDR: People wanted to look cool by jumping on the hate wagon for no reason, mostly console boiz.
---
I think it was a combination of a couple things. First, it was a buggy mess with some poorly implemented mechanics and balancing issues. This coupled with lack of content and PR nightmares (e.g. canvas bags, Nuka Dark, customer data breaches) soured a lot of opinions about the game. Second, people dislike change. FO76 is widely different than other Fallout games that people have grown accustomed to. There was a lot of resistance from the start and judging from comments early on, many wanted it to fail just for existing. The problems at launch only helped support the naysayers and cynics and didn't help win over anyone who was on the fence about it.
---
FO76 has come a long way, but it still has a lot to more to do. It's the L'il Brudder of video games ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqjIEUO4Jz0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqjIEUO4Jz0) ).
---
&gt; an attack defend game mode.  
---
CS:Fallout?  I'd play it.
---
I've watched them.
---
Nowhere does anyone say it will be taken away from us.
---
Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?
---
Because that's what mindless sheep do.
---
I remember at launch I wasn't able to run the game if it wasn't on my SSD. 
---
Now I can run it off my hard drive no problem. 
---
Plus theres a lot more content and adventure mode feels like its in a much better place.
---
at our house if you put the TP on over the top the cat will unroll it and tear it up..
---
litterbox is in there so closing the door isnt an option...
---
I dont hide on the outskirts. I hide close to action and find if i can
---
they should just give us the damn planters that are everywhere in the game world.
---
This.  I always want to wait it out.  But by that point, its been twenty minutes, and I'm itching to pull a trigger.  Then I fail and die by the other guy I didn't see hiding.
---
It’s not just for BETA players. The discover locations challenges are broken for everyone. The learning recipes/plans challenges were also bugged for a while and did not track.
---
Unfortunately I don’t see these getting a fix anytime soon, especially with so much new content in development.
---
Thank you for posting all of these. I really appreciate it! 👍
---
For example, how many packages of pre-war food have been eaten?  How many photos have been taken?  How many deathclaws have been tamed?
---
Couple reasons, some more valid than others.
---
* The game had a lot of bugs and stability issues at launch.  Multiple crashes of server and or client in an hour of play was not unexpected
---
* There were a lot of exploits, too, which further compounded the issue of server stability since a number of them relied on destabilizing and crashing the server to dupe items.
---
* A fallout game without any humanoid NPCs was just a jarring change from what folks were used to.  Robots aren't the same, and listening to people tell you what to do without actually being there is just not right. So a lot of folks didn't care for that change.
---
* It used to be a lot easier to grief people even with pacificst mode on - it used to be that you always took 1 damage from each attack from another player, so if someone wanted to kill you they just had to follow you around and keep hitting you until you ran out of stim packs and died.
---
* Your storage stash used to be hilariously small.  It's still smaller than I'd like, but it *used* to be something like 200lbs capacity.  This lead to a lot of derision and annoyance after FO4 encouraged a "loot everything and stash it at base" mentality.
---
* It was the thing to do.  Todd Howard made a bunch of lofty promises and the outcome was less than ideal, so everyone piled on to shit all over Fallout 76. It was basically free karma, and everyone knows that fake internet points are the only thing that matters.
---
It's not. I can't remember what the rest of but "all new game mode" was only one of a few things were getting.
---
It’s because people actually played the game and realized it’s great instead of listening to douchebag YouTubers who gave it a bad reviews. 
---
Sadly people put all their trust into these folks who generally don’t give a game a fair go.
---
you should be able to get level 40 or 35 explosive weapons from vendors. It's really about you perk card build. Bloodied weapons are great even without explosive as long as you set up your perk cards right.
---
It's the wasteland glomp
---
Same thing! My teammate and i were in the top 6.. i tried to revive him and got stuck. So painful
---
If you don’t select a location to spawn in, it randomly spawns you somewhere on the map.  Most likely that person was afk during the deployment phase and missed their chance.  
---
A few times too I’ve come across people that didn’t actually know they COULD deploy to a specific location.
---
I'm on Xbox and I'd pay good caps for that mask and any extras you got!
---
Love this.
---
tbh Survival should have ammo weight and food/water deprivation while Adventure should be for Adventure
---
having to worry about my water and food levels is just annoying as an adventure player, I literally just wanna explore
---
I'm pretty sure they will add it to adventure once the full NW mode comes out. I can see many issues popping up with adding a location to the game world and then removing it once people have had a chance to go inside and build things in there
---
Pretty funny
---
Games also were less complicated back then. And I still remember jumping through hoops to patch older games because of a serious flaw.
---
I never have any caps to buy weapons from vendors, or anything really. The most caps I’ve ever had was 550
---
Hmmm.... I was hoping for a lot more than just a simple E3 roundup. A road map of Nuclear Winter over the summer, features, events, and things would be nice. Any sort of update on junk item decorations and display cases that was delayed? Text chat? Vault 51 lore and quest? Private servers and mod support update as it will be a year come Wastelanders? Prestige resetting after level 50 and legendary cards or w/e?
---
"Only people who like the game are real players, everyone else is just wrong/full of it/lying." Yeah this sub is totally reasonable and not a circlejerk. What an asinine thing to say. At least it exemplifies how utterly clueless you fanboys are. You've got to be like 12 if you're unironically saying something so delusional.
---
Nuclear winter won't be around anymore after the free week
---
Tell me where to pre order it Bethesda and just take my money
---
People hate my game play but I hide, shoot, hide, shoot. It's served me well so far, I generally stink at pvp but using my bunny method I've won 6 so far. To be fair that's probably not so great a ratio considering in lvl 24 lol so over played s lot
---
I was always a little bit confused on the blowback. It definitely had its issues, and still does sometimes. But everyone I know IRL who plays it says they really like it.
---
I think gaming YouTube channels and media outlets like kotaku and polygon's use of negative opinions to garner attention (very effectively) played some part. 
---
There are so many YouTube channels with vids that all boil down to "what I hate about gaming today and why you should too"
---
I've only got 1 but I'll ask my friends for you!
---
&gt; How one could expect a game this ambitious to NOT have bugs proves how many people have no clue how MMO games work.
---
I've been saying this since day 1. The fallout community is so used to single player they have no clue what goes on with MMOs
---
1067 bullets?? On a drone?? 
---
What are you aiming at?
---
I was teamed with a player that had to leave because “Mom says I have to take a shower now!” Lol
---
It deserves to be downvoted because it isn't contributing to the discussion of this thread. Yes, we're all mad it's way too late and yes we're all mad about the original fiasco and how dumb it was. But that's not what this thread is about.
---
It's not. I'm still looking. Tried a few of the spawn points but couldn't do the server-hopping trick. Kept getting put back onto the same server. I did get a crossbow along the way though, which you need for the Archery Tadpole badge. So I got that going for me.
---
Fuuuuck. 
---
I've had a busy week/weekend and haven't been able to play more than a few games. I took tomorrow off work to get some stuff done, but looks like that stuff is going be NW. 
---
It's going to be a long wait.
---
Have a look at this post from Bethesda forum - might explain your issue ....

I know! The sky gardens in Lewisburg kill me.

I am so glad you made this thread. I had been scratching my head for the past few hours trying to figure out what I may have ordered in a drunken bender.
---
Well, I tried too. 
---
Game is not on steam.
---
Some lancher is required.
---
I'm out.
---
Thanks. I just found it odd that they would have 2 maps with such overlapping terrain. The fact that flatwoods was centered on the _d map made me think of a control point style map rather than a BR style.
---
I agree that the B&amp;W maps are placeholders most likely.
---
I see some stuff I definitely want, so I guess I'm going to be going hardcore in BR for a while.  Makeshift Ronin helmet here I come!
---
r/ihadastroke
---
SO Many people just jumped on the hatewagon for those likes / views. Many even straight up copied word for word what others have said without even playing it themselves. Those type of people are not journalists at all and just radroaches.
---
Many thanks my friend!
---
No idea, I'm also avoiding the mines lol.
---
under the map guys are around too..
---
The current main quest ends off on a pretty big cliffhanger, so yeah it will be a continuation. We don't know for certain what happened to the overseer, the scorched threat is still a big problem (despite the fact that we've nuked thousands of queens already...), and there's still potential for expanding the BoS and enclave factions
---
Capital wasteland is like right there
---
Go to whitesprings, there is a vendor there that sells grape nuka cola. That's how you keep it until you're 32
---
The song was arrive by June Carter so the song rights would belong to the same estate regardless
---
Being 16 myself, I usually am on the opposite end, delivering the ads kickings.
---
You get xp for winning which levels you up, that's what they are talking about
---
nvm. The value/ability-to-sell was nerfed.

Woah stop yellin

Soo upvotes for circle jerking about Bethesda but calling them out for false advertising and bait and switch deserves downvotes?

---
Will be playable until June 17th in bold on this this.
---
No info or hint at when it will return.
---
On his little legs, that hold a box
---
EYY! You got your first one🎉! Quick question how many times did you die because you were using the hazmat suit?
---
It's a "sneak peak" of the game mode during the free trial. It's been stated. Read today's Inside the Vault.
---
Aiming with V.A.T.S
---
Don't forget it was more problematic on consoles and older systems. Which is what the vocal majority played on.   
---
High end systems had far less problems, though still some serious bugs.
---
I really hope so.  I want to see all the lore that is in there.
---
Oh right. Pc lol
---
Shame i have potato aim. Should try more times. Photomode is way of cornerwallhacking
---
That was the drones way of telling you to learn to aim.
---
Totally agree. I’m right under 1000hrs and don’t see myself quitting anytime soon.
---
I've never looked up a build and just kinda put points where I wanted them... what level are you and what weapons are you using?  That may be a lot more of the issue.
---
Dude are you guys even serious? lol I feel like you guys are trying to drive me crazy right now. I have never made a post where noone understand a word of what I am saying.
---
That's what it is! I couldn't place what made it feel off, but the small precise adjustments were noticeable.
---
Thinking of diving back in myself. Is it best to start a new character or should I just continue with my iirc lvl 30 character?
---
because it was not like this when it first came out. i've played 275h between launch and patch #4. where i decided to stop and give the devs time to fix their game because for 1 bug they were fixing, 2 new ones would show up. I just started to play again with a new character and it is way more stable and interesting that it was. granted that the hate train has always been overly negative, but they deserved to be criticized at some point as they did put on the market a product that was not ready to be stamped as a final product. Beta should have been an additional 6 months at least.
---
It would make as much sense as me being from Ohio but going to West Virginia. What we know about a character isn't all inclusive.
---
to be clear, I'm not against certain exploits in this game, the CAMP system is horrendous, just calling it as I see it.
---
Following back up on this thread, I've sent PMs to those of you who have been running into the 4:7:2000 error frequently so that the dev team can take a deeper look into this issue.
---
Your not alone my friend!!
---
I agree to an extent. All archetypes should be viable at end game, but weapons having tiers in the archetype is OK.
---
Though with how all weapons go to max level i see your point.
---
Dupes shouldn’t even be a damn thing in the mode. I’m Level 14 and I have 14 perk cards, that’s far less than I should have with challenges included but nope, I keep pulling dupes. It’s fucking really unfair when some of these perks make such a major difference
---
Unfortunately you need low quality of graphics in order to achieve better fps. The game is fun but poorly optimized. It's better play with ssd and high ram.
---
Okay yea i found it, thanks again
---
Hahaha you’re a sad sad man.
---
&gt;If that 1 person ruins a game for you by cheating then maybe you aren't mature enough to be playing that game
---
Your are joking right?
---
If i you cheat and that ruins my game it means i'm not mature enough to play?
---
Lets get this straight, you are saying being mad because you lost to a cheater makes you "not mature enough" to play.
---
Yeah spot the scriptkiddie
---
Ok, i'm get it, but my aim is not important, important that drone goes through ground
---
No one is circle jerking Bethesda in this thread. So I can't say. However, you do know this entire subreddit is dedicated to a Bethesda game right? There's gonna be a lot of circle jerking.
---
&gt;Calling them out
---
Bitch please. This was done literally months ago and MULTIPLE times. Do we *really* need to go through that stupid song and dance every time the word "Canvas" is mentioned? Are you gonna do the Nuka Dark dance when it's added to the next game too?
---
You have to unequip another card. So you can have 3 per, 2 agi 2 luck cards if your stats allow.
---
okey im on ps4 so sadly i cant help you out sorry 
---
but im sure youll find help!
---
If you don’t mind hopping into survival for ~10 mins, the challenges are easy this week and the shotgun from that is very good
---
LOL. 
---
I got nothin'
---
I'm glad you're enjoying the game. I'm playing it in lower (edited .ini so it can go even lower) because my setup isn't up to date, and I have a blast!
---
I played at Launch, there was some bugs and issues, more so on console. Server stability was a issue for sure, mostly caused by people crashing the server to dupe or massive amounts of enemies attacking at once.   
---
I tried it on PS4, PS4 Pro, Xbox One and A Mid and high end PC. The experience was horrible on all the consoles, but slightly better on PS4 Pro and Xbox One. The Mid range PC did just a bit better than consoles and the high end PC had the least issues. But they all still suffered from servers stability, quest bugs and animation issues and players exploiting, which seemed to be the worst on Xbox.   
---
Exploiters and Dupers were the biggest bane of the game at launch, those people caused more issues and stability problems than expected.
---
I'd heard all the bad things about it and really wanted to try it in spite of all that. Usually in my experience it's never as bad as everyone says, but $60 is a lot of money and I was afraid to spend it in case I was wrong lol. Plus, I didn't like ESO and I don't really like MMOs very much in general, so I was concerned that I'd hate it anyway.
---
I downloaded it for the trial this week and I'm having SO MUCH FUN. Everyone is really nice, the world is gorgeous (I really hate the ticks though. HATE.). It doesn't really feel like an MMO to me, which is great. I went ahead a bought it, I love it and I'm so glad I tried it out!
---
I did hear ESO got a whole lot better, so if anyone can like confirm what's changed since like around 2016 that would be cool. I'm considering trying it again as well.
---
Probably Brotherhood, which would work alongside/absorb the Responders.
---
I’m not stupid, I didn’t know a skeleton was offensive, but I now know. That’s why I took it back, I said it should be a npc so others can enjoy the game more since he enjoyed the game a lot. I’m sorry to those it may have offended
---
Yo i were having this the most powerful fish would better in the grafton dam OK?
---
The internet hates GAAS
---
Always shoot the 4 wings/thrusters first. It’s a little harder but if they break it slows down.
---
random number generator, but it is used to describe in some games when a system is implemented to give seemingly random rewards
---
Still leaving alot of wasted stat points not allowing more cards!
---
Keep scrolling down to add-ons
---
Hi and thanks for your report! Sending you a PM requesting more info.
---
Hey, this a little bit off topic, but where do you find the rewards for Nuclear Winter, I'm new to the game.  I can't find them anywhere
---
lol nice. That's up there with the tip someone posted in r/fo76FilthyCasuals about stealing the fusion core from  power armor you aren't going to use and then camping it.
---
Yeah I'm gonna have to take a look when I get home.
---
No asswipe, 100's of hours into Skyrim, FO3, FO4, NV, etc.  Just seems that almost every building I come across is inaccessible and that seemed out of the norm for the recent Bethesda games.  I thought FO4 was pretty accessible, and Skyrim you could get into anything.  FO3 seemed quite limited.

 &gt; Hi and thanks for your report! Sending you a PM requesting more info.

Yet another reason why I'm glad I''m happy with the enclave gettup
---
Add sidthesloth814 when you’re on! Been grinding all morning
---
I believe it was a joke to Fallout 4 and how the toilet paper was backwards at Nate and Nora’s house.
---
I've had an amazing time in nuclear winter - my only criticism is my build in main game is not how I would build for nw. Being co.pletly different aspects of the game - I hope that they instead do point systems rather than special systems. Like 15-20 points to build the 7 card deck.
---
So did I. Our enjoyment of the game does not mean it was good, or an even remotely finished, let alone polished, product.
---
Use the bandolier and pack rat perks, or manage your inventory.
---
FO76 is a game of trade-offs.  Damage, defense, or utility: you'll have to pick one.
---
Np, hope you like it.
---
I have a feeling that the textures aren't compressed correctly, so I'm going to compress them myself and upload the compressed textures to Nexus soon.
---
I think I am level 38. I try to keep 1 gun available for the ammo types I have. 
---
Generally that might be: .44 pistol, 10mm machine gun, some kind of assault or combat rifle, a shotgun and a melee sledge or spear. Sometimes I pack a laser sniper or a plasma gun but not often.
---
I never have enough ammo for a single gun type (except .38) so I switch around weapons to make sure I never totally run out in case I need that particular weapon. 
---
I am not *good* at video games but I do love fallout so I wish I could move through the content a bit easier.
---
edit: one thing the MMO setting has made clear is how much more other people seem to do / figure out in the game compared to me. Never really noticed as I went about business in the single players.
---
You clearly just make shit up to protect your delusion that everyone who plays the game likes it 100% like you. If you have a god damn rebuttal, make it. Stop posting these meaningless fucking responses that amount to, '... Nuh-uh!!'
---
Humm maybe I should change out of my Priest clothes
---
if you have a two or three person team (from the social menu) will it backfill the empty spots with randoms?
---
It was hinted for displays for things like bobble heads and magazines. Don’t remember what patch it was expected. Maybe 10.5.
---
\*Thumbs up in Fallout\*
---
Slow down / take your time exploring.
---
There are at least a dozen PA spawn points in the forest alone.  so You don't really need all the frames right now.
---
Until you get Batteries included perk, cores for PA weigh 3# each,  After you get it, they weigh 0.3.
---
The perk to reduce their consumption rate will not appear for you for a number of levels - until you get that, 
---
you will burn through cores rather quickly.
---
Most likely, by the time you collect a full raider set (starts at L15, I think), you'll already be high enough level for T45 or have built your (first set of) Excavator.
---
Yeah I definitely don't think the Responders would be able to do it themselves, I've always viewed them as a Followers of the Apocalypse-esque faction.
---
The Free States could also be a major player
---
Daily challenges are disabled I believe but the other challengers are still able to be completed as I've done 2 today (photos and place camp).
---
Shitting on the game gets upvotes.
---
They drastically reduced the amount of budget that turrets and lights use, but put a cap on how many you can have (10 and 50, respectively). So there was an effective increase if you had been using them. People who had been doing more involved builds previously had just gone without turrets, since they're not especially effective.
---
I already did this, and that why drone can't go up
---
I’m jealous. I used to be able to run this game completely fine, but nowadays I have to disable my intel graphics card because the game refuses to recognize my nvidia card. It’s a fucking hassle and Bethesda isn’t helping either :(
---
I picked up the Enforcer perk card and use a shotgun to kneecap just about anything that comes at me.  That alone was a HUGE game changer for me.  If you're on PC, send me a message with your gamertag and I'll hook you up with some better weapons, if you'd like.
---
It already exists in Adventure, just can't go in.
---
Uh
---
you don't, welcome to Bethesda games, even on PC they run like ass sometimes
---
Revive an ally isn’t super hard when solo. You just gotta revive anyone who goes down during events, per se project paradise or imposter sheepsquatch.
---
Or just ask around like you would if you were going for the revive in water challenge.
---
I have liked the game all the way thru. 
---
At launch yes it was not good and I would get dumped prob 1 an hour and that wasn't fun
---
yes it did seem half baked on release.
---
My main question is how long would have it pushed back release? 
---
Are we better off with a buggy mess at launch or waiting 6 months to year for a more fully baked release? Or in the case of a game like d3 wait about 10 years and its still a buggy mess at launch??  Whats the answer here
---
Don't feel bad if people don't reply. For example, I'm Brazilian, and we play on the same server as NA, so probably the entire continent does this as well, it might be that people don't know enough english to actually try to talk to you.
---
I disagree. A server disconnect is only a issue when taking workshops, and only when you don't have a team (you can back to the server). Workshops are a little part of the game.
---
Quest don't reset generally on server crash. It can happen, but is not the norm.
---
You on console or pc? I keep getting signed out of PSN for some reason
---
Yes teams are always 4 players
---
I'm glad you finally got to see the game for what it truly is.  
---
It had some issues at launch, especially on console but the hate wagon was strong and vocal and really hurt the success of the game for no real reason.
---
I actually think you can play solo though
---
It’s because the daily challenge the day before was exploitable. It was just place your camp down 4 times in a match, but it was repeatable. So you could keep farming the perk cards being awarded for the challenge. I did it 30+ times and got a lot of good perk cards!
---
Not if you dont want it to.
---
Same, I'm decent at shooting but leave the building to my friends
---
Two possible issues. Mods leftovers if you used mods. Get a new custom.ini file if so.
---
The other is patching. If you patch from version 1 to 2, its tested for not fucking up the whole thing. If you patch from version 6 to 7, its tested too. But noone tests if you can patch from versions 1-5 to 7 as much as they test a single iteration. This is common across all things that are patched, the more complicated they are the more commonly this issue arises. There's a chance that specific transition between versions, i.e. 3-&gt;7 fucks stuff up. Clean reinstal will solve this issue for 98%. 
---
The version numbers are bullshit here, only illustrating a point.
---
Yeah he actually was. In adventure mode when you come across someone usually they can give you free stuff or emote with you
---
Oh sorry. Guess I cant read.
---
I'm on PC.
---
Tell me this, if a player kills you in the world do they steal all of your stuff that you have on you?  Weapons, armor, clothes, junk, aid, etc etc?
---
The sheepsquatch imposter? That's one that you really want to start with a team. The trouble is that the advance warning is very short, so players will show up late and usually won't be willing to take a pylon. It's possible to tank all three pylons yourself but I wouldn't recommend it until you've played it the "easy" way a couple of times.
---
We do both, but it feels like the majority tend towards being generous.  It helps that there really isn't much in the way of non-consensual PvP.
---
Hello.
---
 I completed the quest. Thanks anyway :)
---
You can get those sexy lady mod recs from him too
---
That god damn scorch beast. I was the last of my team and had three of another team left. Maybe I could have won, who knows, but the god damn scorch beast targeted me.
---
Oh so even though you did it, it just decided to clip through the ground for safety. Gotcha. That’s upsetting.
---
Because of expectations associated with prior entries in the series. I have a theory that contains all media; The more someone is invested in any series, the more they try to predict the series. When their predictions are false, they feel the need to lash out and want the series to go in "their" direction. These people simply are not satisfied being a spectator. Although not necessarily a bad thing, there is a time to be a spectator and let the artist display their work, and being an actual participant.
---
Beth is just trying to display their work. The angry people were simply expecting something else.
---
The sooner you let go, the sooner you can enjoy.
---
I don't see the Free States doing much. They really weren't big.
---
If you have the tinker’s workbench you should never have to buy ammo. And if you get some decent legendary weapons it shouldn’t take long to kill anything except for the boss-type enemies.
---
Yep. Most of us drop supplies to newbies and help them with gear.
---
Which graphics card do you have? I have an nvidia 1050ti and it runs fine (after I have disabled my intel card, since I play on my laptop).
---
Bandoleer perk greatly reduces ballistic ammo weight.
---
Ammosmith will increase ammo output, especially when combined with superduper.
---
(metal) Ore weighs more than (metal) scrap, so get some acid and smelt any ore you are carrying.
---
This is why you ALWAYS put it on BACKWARDS
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/W2MBu64
---
Interesting, so looks like they will have multiple NW maps when it goes live?  Could be interesting.
---
Definitely agree on damage:  being a good shot mitigates a lot of boosts from cards
---
However there are a few utility items, frog legs especially, that can change how you play the game.  I don’t want to be guaranteed to get the card when I want, but I’d like a guarantee to get it in a reasonable time frame (like before rank 100).
---
Yeah, everyone’s super nice. There’s no pvp in adventure mode, even though it’s allowed. If you’re a new player and people see you leaving the vault,you’re gonna be given a lot of items for free.
---
Wow you are that dumb
---
What are we looking at?
---
I've won a couple where one teammate was downed at the win. I wondered if he/she received the full 525 xp, assume they did. But if you die, you can only spectate. There's no xp if you get carried.
---
Hopefully to address some of the exploits people have been utilizing. If the evidence of hackers in NW are true they'll need to address these issues asap &amp; I'm thinking they've seen the gammut already.
---
I might add that, even if you accept to be in the server without your camp. You don't need to move it. You can do whatever you want and THEN switch server and your camp will spawn in the correct location.
---
NW perks work completely different than adventure/survival. There are no ranks, and duplicate card drops are discarded in favor of Overseer XP.
---
The Enclave, even with the homicidal computer at the helm and with an seemingly unlimites amount of robots and connections to an orbital platform
---
I don’t understand why people who hate the game and the devs and what they do so much, that they still get on the sub. Like BGS said in their post the other day, they did appreciate the feedback, but stuff like that is uncalled for.
---
-notice- please don't feed the trolls.
---
It could probably have used a bit more development time or at least an actual beta. The flipside is a game like Mount and Blade 2: Bannerlord which has been "coming soon" for several years now.
---
Very true cuz my husband sucks at keeping up with the food and drinking! 😂 I always have to remind him to eat and drink! 🤦🏻‍♀️
---
Some people are dicks, but mostly we're pretty nice. Last night I saw a low level doing an event, so I went over there to help. I was too late to get the event to succeed, but I gave him a bunch of stimpaks and invited him to another event that I knew we had time to complete. He didn't follow, but I tried. 
---
And I've been given all kinds of stuff, myself. And it seems like the lower level you are, the more free stuff you get. I mean, now is a weird time to get into it, since there are so many new people and most of the older players are trying the NW mode, so there's more n00bs on a map than veteran players.
---
Lol, already have all those. For end game players like me who have 5-15k of all ammo types we use, none of that makes enough difference.
---
super..
---
Yeah, but not in Survival mode.
---
How I’m I dumb?
---
The good ol’ bush-Wookiee tactic. I remember when I did that in season 1 fortnite.
---
Takes time to build quality content to add. I've got a feeling most of their time has been focused on trying to bug squash and balance what's already in play, so big add-ons have gotten a bit backburnered.  I'd rather them take a few more months and put out *quality* content than some slapdash bullshit just to calm down people screaming for more right now like naked chicks in a nest peeping for Mom and Dad to puke regurgitated insects down their gaping maws.
---
It's just a personal thing, nothing to 'get'.  Also helps if you grew up with that sort of thing (though I didn't).
---
I tend to watch streamers that are playing something I'm interested in, but don't really want to play.  Or, games I'm significantly invested in personally.  Plus, there are a few streamers that are just damned entertaining no matter what they do, but that will vary a *lot*.  There are a ton of really *really* popular streamers that I can't stand to watch, and a ton of small streamers that I find fascinating.
---
It's not something everyone will enjoy, and that's fine.  If there's something you enjoy, check out a few streams, there's a lot of things besides games to watch (though that's the majority).
---
Display cases are still on the way with a future patch! We will have more details and info to share about them ahead of the update that will add them to the game.
---
You've spent the past 2 hours skulking around this sub telling people not to have fun because you don't like this game, then you accuse them of being childish and delusional.
---
Yeah. Good luck.

---
 &gt; Display cases are still on the way with a future patch! We will have more details and info to share about them ahead of the update that will add them ...
---
Because there are no NPCs (yet), Bethesda had to tell the story via journals, holotapes, notes, and through the environment, and they really shine in that department.  I really enjoy stumbling across skeletons or bodies and trying to figure out why they are there and what they were doing.
---
I don’t melee and I don’t have any uber guns, but I have enough rifle/crit/limb perks that I can bring her down with one critical wing shot with a hunting rifle most of the time. 
---
I can’t do shit for DPS after that, but I can keep her on the ground.  
---
So I if you’re going to go after her alone with a mostly melee build, I would focus on just crippling her wings rather than trying to do damage to her in the air.
---
I cast summon bigger fish!
---
It seems to be due to lag/loading, it was orignally a boarded up door. Happens sometimes to me(when trying to go in, but not out)
---
I was a HUGE defender when the game launched. I had a lot of fun for a good month, so when all the RAMPANT cheating started I didn't feel like I had 'wasted my money' - but Bethesda's EXTREME inaction and then finally capitulation to the cheaters ensured that I was done with this game. 
---
It's good to see their new BR is going to be 10x worse.
---
Aww poor thing.
---
It uses 6gb? I've been running the textures at Ultra and I'm getting a solid-ish framerate, and I only have a GTX 770 2gb.
---
This is happening to me too. The PSN status is intermittent but I can sign right back in, it just happens again every 5-10 minutes. Frustrating.
---
Yeah because the canvas part is the only thing that anyone should be angry about and not the part about "false advertising and bait and switch" which I said directly.   
---
Blindly accepting this as just how things are is one of the main reasons why this whole thing is one of the most frustrating parts because Bethesda blindly lied about shit because they knew people like you would be totally ok with it.
---
I've bought and given copies of games and/or expansions to complete strangers in the past. How does someone giving a copy to a friend = insincerity to you?
---
That’s not really a bug, that’s just something that’s always been a thing with power armor, but they probably didn’t think to take it out.
---
Just like radstorms, but won’t do anything its just there to be either a good scenery or might spawn legendaries inside it.
---
My only critique so far is the loading and waiting between matches. Not sure how to fix it but almost 4 mins of waiting which can lead to 2 mins of game play is a rough life
---
That sucks i llove this mode
---
I've actually had a few the past two days, haven't had that issue in a very long time (xbox)
---
I love giving  newbies supplies right when they come out of the vault, i try to give 30 stimpacks, a level 1 brotherhood recon sniper and ammo everytime
---
Hi! We're currently investigating an issue affecting Nuclear Winter daily challenges and have disabled them for the time being while we look into it. They'll still appear in your challenge menu but can't currently be completed.
---
There are still a number of other Nuclear Winter challenges you can complete, but for the moment, Dailies are unavailable. Apologies for the inconvenience!
---
if only we had 2 handed swords
---
He could have thought that anyone would love to be apart of the fallout universe even a skeleton
---
Might cause a lot of problems with people trying to do missions, pergola d newbies. It’s probably better off in NW.
---
Can you explain what you've seen or heard of as far as exploits go?
---
It’s strangely addictive. Adventure mode feels likes it’s missing something after long hours of NW.
---
Guess theres issues with psn currently
---
The only delusional 12 year old would be you, miss-reading what I tried to clearly type out and then interpreting it completely differently. What my sentences were trying to communicate to you was that a vast majority of people reporting on the game did not sink enough hours into the game to properly report on the state of where it was and then have not sunk enough hours into it over the patches to report on where it currently is now. A vast majority of people are finding the current game to be completely opposite of what is currently circulating in terms of what people claimed the game to be. It is opposite because of the complete morons reporting incorrectly compared to the people who know the positives and negatives due to experience of actually playing the videogame. I'm not saying the game is perfect, I'm clearly not saying you have to like it to be a real player, I'm saying there are very bad reporters giving this game falsely placed hate. Please learn to read.

Gear? What am I missing lol? Have so many i bulk and vendor
---
Yeah I thought that
---
There is a challenge to stay in the fire zone. Try and work in that 😁
---
Gotta try your recommendation. Hope it works for me!
---
yea, point taken.  
---
I'm L100 ... carrying 2k+ of 3 different ammo types, so I know what you mean :)
---
I have Zealots and Troubleshooter .50 cal explosive machine guns, both drops.  I use the Zealots for the Scortch Beast Queen and the Troubleshooters for the Cryptid event.  
---
I feel that the .50 cal does more damage over a greater distance than the other ballistic heavy guns.  I could be wrong, but that’s just my sense from playing with each weapon type.  
---
It’s also really easy to make ammo for it.  
---
But mainly, I haven’t found a really nice Gatling gun.  Most of the ones I find or get from the legendary vendor have weak modifiers.  Perhaps the good ones just don’t drop as often as the .50 cal machine guns do.  Or maybe the RNG engine thinks that I look cooler with a .50 cal....   (grin)
---
1. I'd go for the Wild Appalachia quest lines and Nuclear Winter if you're into that. Also have a look around players vending shops you may find something you like.
---
2. It's still very good but I've stayed with my rifleman build and haven't had many issues pvp or pve.
---
3. They're still probably the best legendary rolls you can get but they've been nerfed quite a bit and so they're not as devastating as they used to be.
---
4. I'm not sure, I just farm mine at the Thunder Mountain Power Plant with a fusion generator.
---
5. Still hard to find in my experience, and thats up to you. I, personally, am on top of a junk extractor.

Welcome Back!
---
P.S. What system are you on?
---
Stay tuned, there are some that take 9 of a stat!
---
For real. Someone passively agro'd mobs to my base by FTing to it multiple times, and when I showed up my Deathclaw was dead and my walls and some of my stuff was destroyed. Dude disconnected from server, and I have no idea who it was, since when I noticed a player at my base I didn't think to keep an eye on him. So frustrating.  
---
They need to just make CAMPS impervious in Adventure, and pets unkillable.
---
There’s a whole lot more to wild Appalachia than the new quests. I know it takes effort and most people think it’s a put down or something, but you should read the inside the vault articles from when you stopped playing til now to get caught up on all the changes. It’s more than anyone is willing to type out
---
Got a couple hundred bucks to spend on atoms just for that one.
---
I tried to price match a game at Walmart on their own website and they said that they don’t do that...
---
Thank you so much. The duplicate cards I get and Overseer level not being account based (instead of per character), are my two biggest issues.
---
I have a level 8 Overseer character with 4 duplicate perks! That's a little ridiculous.
---
Thankfully I also have a level 7 Overseer character with 0 duplicates.
---
When are we getting more ethnic hairstyles?  We've been living off the land for six months now it's about time we got the option to ditch the box cut and the other traditional 50's hairstyles and go natural too.
---
This is exactly why I said "personally never encountered". I'm not discounting that bugs, some serious, occurred.  I'm not even discounting that some things I don't personally consider gamebreaking were gamebreaking for others.
---
My point is that there *was* a hate train from a subset of people who wanted to see the game crash and burn right out of the gate.  And like all hate trains, especially on the internet, it gathered speed.
---
3 days left of the sneak peek, it will be full released later on and then we have al the time in the world.
---
They made some adjustments to build limits along the way as stability improved, but in addition, build limits go up as you level up, as well.
---
It's absolutely the norm for daily quests which completely drop and you have to restart.  As well as any events you were working on yourself since you get plopped into a new server.  Plenty of games let you rejoin the one you were in after a disconnect.  76 should do the same.  At least then the disconnects wouldn't be as annoying.
---
I can post a picture of the receipt with my info taking off
---
And I haven’t had any issues. 
---
Therefore, it’s too small of a sample size. 
---
Which is why I asked if you had a source.
---
Damage resistance has diminishing returns: +45 DR is pretty good if your DR is 50, but six times weaker if your DR is 300.
---
That’s why there is such an influx of players
---
No I believe you! I was just complaining they didn’t do it for me.
---
There is a vendor that sells them now constantly.
---
Ohhh if you only knew...
---
Game is still garbage. Play Rust.
---
Ohhhhh, I see. Thx for the info. Hopefully it’s released some time in July when schools still out :/
---
Alright pal, game was a complete piece of shit dumpster fire all I was asking is quite simply has Bethesda sorted out the shit game that this was at launch or do I spend my time in games that have a bit more care and effort into them?
---
If you have NVIDEA download the NVIDEA experience from their website. When my drivers were out of date everything ran super poorly. But when I downloaded the NVIDEA experience to update my drivers everything seemed to work very well again! If you have a lower end PC and no shame in that, the game itself will need to be run on low settings.
---
I've been server hopping white springs that have full spawns every time throughout. One vendor at the station that promptly disappeared as I approached. 
---
Loads of low levels around 76 and flatwoods though!
---
I was going to say you can show it to them and see if they will match that
---
The same thing happened with Survival not so long ago. Everything will get back to normal soon.
---
I haven't noticed much of a difference, and I actually saw more people on Survival today. It's a good thing that all the different modes are populated.
---
I guess the only thing to do is too keep your duplicate cards and keep winging about it then.
---
I was wondering why everyone seemed like they were running in from up the road.
---
Found this:

Im Loving it! My best round netted me 15 kills and 1500xp. (Maybe the round lasted a bit longer than yours?) I didnt screenshot it so i cant remember where all the xp came from. Do we share some kills with our teammates if we are all shooting the same targets? Ive had rounds where all 4 of us had over 10 kills, but im pretty sure we didnt fight more than 40 people. 
---
Someone commented here that their only kill was against someone looting their dead teammate. Lmao. Ive been killed a bunch of times because because my head was stuffed into a duffle bag trying to loot gear for hat i did not even need. Lesson to be learned there!
---
Yes I'm well aware. I realize the majority already know about it. But I'm still seeing posts asking if it's worth it.... so trying to catch those stragglers. But thanks for the downvote i guess...smh
---
u/Bethesdagamestudios
---
Could you add the volley sights to the M79? Or  give  us a sight that flips them up? Itd be cool
---
I got the game 2 days ago after my friend prompted me to try the trial and I love it and got the full game,  what impresses me the the most is that I can play it using my garbage hotspot. Usually 600mbps speed and it runs run. Occasional lag but that's expected with a Online game, I just wanted to say thank you for not giving up on the game. Keep doing what you guys are doing on it, listen to the players like you have been and keep on surviving. See you in Appalachia!
---
Nah it’s all good, I bought it from Amazon instead haha.
---
No one is blindly accepting anything though?
---
We're accepting that we're finally getting the bags. Everyone already fucking knows about what happened. Everyone already voiced their opinions. We've shouted and screamed and gotten annoyed. We're getting what we wanted.
---
Is it right? No. 
---
Are we talking about that? No not right now. 
---
Man, you seem like the kind of guy to start with "NOT ALL GUYS!"
---
After server hopping somewhere around 30 times, I finally managed to get the plans. I really appreciate the tip for the location.
---
 I did notice that hopping on Survival increased my chances of at least finding a plan; playing in Adventure always seemed to have nothing there.
---
Vendors have permanent stock now, but prices increased as well. You might be able to find them cheaper at player vendors, but I have yet to see anyone selling them.
---
At a guy who has the time to hide his username but doesn’t bother hiding the names of others.
---
That’s one lil cute bear though.
---
Stash issues at level 20!? Wait til you get into the hundreds!
---
That's a great strategy, although sadly I want to put my crop on the second floor.
---
I didn't tell anyone not to have fun. Why do you feel the need to make up lies to try and oppose my viewpoint? Isn't there enough in the game for you to just provide examples of how wrong I am? Must not be, because the only responses I ever get about my criticisms of the game are that I've never played or that I'm a lemming bitch.
---
The Onion. The Onion never changes.
---
Nice so photomode panning works in NW lol
---
The maps that overlap the edges of the savage divide would be tough. Getting stuck on the wrong side as the storm closes in. Such a pain trying to figure out a way over the mountains. Could make for some choke points at a few of the openings.
---
This is still Webster’s definition of Nuclear Winter. When fire burns up everything and ash and dust covers the sky and blocks out the sun. 
---
With Wastlanders coming up that will be changing parts of the map, it would be interesting what else is changed than farm houses and the downed space station.
---
Check youtube, its a bug in the config
---
Did you get the tricentennial one
---
I'm 52 and got my dad to play too.. he's 75
---
Oh... Daily quest, events and workshops are better content for multiplayer. When in a party you can returning to the server. But yeah, we need the return last server.

Nah first come first serve.

Yeah seems like a troll account at this point, he can't even have a productive conversation let alone read correctly.
---
Will do!
---
Congrats on the first!
---
Don't let the skill get rusty - Visit Ft Defiance....or Mosstown :)
---
Ten Dollars. I only got ATOMS due to the E3 special, otherwise I find it more fun to grind an earn ATOMS to get stuff from the store.
---
Yeah I've had the entire eastern half of the map to myself sometimes. Seeing lots of activity around Flatwoods though.
---
I was talking about a completely different game (Red Dead 2). Maybe since last month they changed their policy
---
In the overall year 1 roadmap, they said that the summer updates will also include vault raids and a legendary level reset system (reset your XP levels to 1 and get special perks), so there’s definitely more than just the BR mode
---
This guy is famous now lol. Seen like 10 other posts!
---
Yeah I kinda feel the same way. I just wish they could add a solo playlist because playing with random people is a real pain sometimes. Should be pretty easy to do for the devs too.
---
Which vendor is that? Is it the one in harpers ferry?
---
Oh
---
"True fans". Ugh. What a gag-worthy comment. Anyone who has the gall to call themselves a "true fan" of *anything* is just a worthless, gatekeeping twat.
---
Iv been playing regularly since BETA my main character is lvl 48 and i have never been greifed
---
It’s probably the surge of new players. Just wait for a week then its gone.
---
I'd appreciate a PM, if you're willing to share Mysterious Stranger.
---
Upvoting would allow Bethesda to see this post
---
In my mind I more of think, cant see players over lvl 10 until you are also over lvl 10, at this point you can have a store and what not. Dont bring in NPCs until they have completed the oversears quest line and made the wasteland safe for them. This could really be at any lvl. I feel this would contribute to the story line and make the player feel like they're truly making a difference in the wasteland.
---
I don’t have a headset and my Xbox just won’t work with it anyway, so I can only communicate by emotes and IMs so please don’t feel bothered. Sometimes I can see that people are talking nearby but can’t respond. FWIW, I’ve been playing since November and only had a few run-ins with other players being jerks. I suck at combat and just like doing quests and challenges on my own along with my treasure hunting so I’m also an easy target. The number of good, kind players has FAR outweighed the bad.
---
I've seen Mega Sloth, and was like whoa. Would love to see it randomized a bit more with cryptids, good idea!   
---
I suspect other Nuclear Winter maps will have different things. A powerful Flatwoods Monster on Harpers Ferry map that reveals where everyone is? Yes please.
---
I agree with the hive mindedness when it comes to criticisms of the game. I love the game too, and play it every chance I get. However to say that I haven't been frustrated because of how messy it can be would be lying. 
---
Take gun fu for example. Multiple posts about it being broken, and every comment gets down voted. I don't care about karma or whatever, but if people are so sycophantic that they can't handle genuine constructive criticism, then I don't know what to say lol.
---
Saying that patches can't be tested well prior to release is met with frothing mouth outrage.
---
None. I just kept shooting at it while it was flying around - it didn't land near me or try to attack.
---
Yeah but this game is bad because people with shitty computers play and have issues :(
---
Bethesda is really good at world building and story telling via environment.
---
Aww lucky.
---
Have you ever though that the family might not want this?
---
The Khans left vault 15 the same vault produced Shady Sands and later the NCR. Not all people would be looting all the time and murdering each other.
---
At least you get xp rather than just being stuck withe 2 of the same cards.
---
Yes this is the kind of stuff that I really enjoy hearing about because it’s so relatable in a way.
---
Usually camp stuff with the except of 2 PA skins and like 3 random cosmetics, id say I earned $20 worth of atoms in game, and then have spent like 40-60
---
&gt;Do we   
---
&gt;really  
---
&gt; need to go through that stupid song and dance every time the word "Canvas" is mentioned? Are you gonna do the Nuka Dark dance when it's added to the next game too?
---

\- No idea what that even means, just kinda seems like you're pulling shit out of your ass now.
---
It is cute but the bears in the game are no laughing matter, with their constant knock backs. I keep second guessing if I want to engage them now. Freaked out when two of them attacked me in the wild and a Sheepsquash. They almost killed the Sheepsquash before I grenade them all.
---
3 recorded spawns in Clarksburg, and now one in Summerville?  I didnt see something like this listed in the random encounters. Can anyone datamine for it?
---
Last night it was just me and a level 10 on a server, I ran 2 power plants and never had them contested so now I have about 80 fusion cores lol, time to sell some cheap! Every once in awhile I'd go where the level 10 was and drop them a few aid items and help if they were fighting something particularly tough, it was nice, but yeah my shop overlooking watoga got no love
---
Also curious
---
A PC Gamer post positive about Fallout and they didn't mention Fortnite?! \*Gasp\*
---
Playing devils advocate a bit
---
Could you build a stair camp, climb into a tree (some are solid) then trash the camp?
---
When does NW launch fully? Presumably not alongside Wastelanders...
---
Also, when does Survival go out of beta?
---
That's odd, my issue was caused by a similar situation as I have both Intel and Nvidia. I hope you find something that'll work though.
---
It’s already out. It provides nothing new just says a double xp weekend is coming June 20-24
---
This is why I turned fill squad off, if I'm at a crate first, deciding what I want to take teammates always run up and just indiscriminately take everything
---
Oh - that explains it. You get booted after each match, so....
---
Damn I saw that toothy mask in someone's store and didn't buy it, dang it!
---
Welcome back! It's a lot of fun, and has really evolved.
---
I'm excited to see what they do with it!
---
Hi all, and thanks for your reports. We're currently looking to release a fix for this one with our next update!
---
I just use my Vamp (faster reload faster fire rate) 10 mm pistol against it. It has never let me down once.
---
Side note, do you know how to get the whoopsies? It’s the only disease I haven’t gotten for that challenge
---
You can few your kills/wins by looking at the NW challenges. There’s no way to view K/D at this time though. And it would be awesome if we could show our wins in our camp!
---
Yeah, disabling the intel card helps. Just annoying to do every time I want to play, haha. Emailed Bethesda with this but they kept blaming it on my internet connection.
---
I spent £4 ish and got the vault tec blue and yellow track suit
---
lol I like how someone just downvoted you. Wtf
---
I’m having loads of fun! I love how much freedom this game has. I don’t like ESO because of how structured it is in comparison. In Fallout 76, you can make your own base, make your own objectives, and even role-play! I started out as an ammosmith, but now I’m a gun-runner and Armor-supplier as well! I switched to a business suit and made a giant robot base to have an iconic shop.
---
I spend loads of time meeting new people and making friends! I was trying to sell a bloodied, Swing Speed Baton for a while when a police officer showed up at my base and bought it! He told me how he likes to chase people around and harass them with batons. I met another customer who runs a brewery, and he showed me the ropes of crafting alcohol! 
---
Tourists from all around come to my base to chat and take pictures, it’s great!
---
Theres a difference though between constructive posts that actually outline how to fix bugs and or how to improve, in comparison to the “bugthesda at it again they are morons and I hate this company”
---
Thanks for your reports about this one. The dev team has done some investigating and we're currently looking to release a fix with our next update.
---
Only to buy the e3 special
---
The game had massive issues at launch, but none so bad its deserved the ongoing hate. You can tell the haters never played and never have because they parrot the same shit from day 1, even though 90% or more of issues are fixed and continuing to do so. And if you mention that they just fall back on the god awful nylon bag argument. The collectors edition was focused around the helmet so I never even saw an issue in the first place, yet Bethesda is still producing and shipping the “originally promised bags”.
---
I think we'll see Vault Raids before Wastelanders in the fall.
---
What are you disagreeing with? That it shouldn't be a problem for these players because you consider it "a little part of the game". 
---
You even say that quest progress can be reset on a crash.
---
Thanks for reporting this! We're currently planning to release a fix for this with our next update.
---
That's been true going back to when FO76 was just a glimmer on the horizon though. I had a guy arguing with me about a general statement of Bethesda games *often* being a bugfest, especially at launch. He actually claimed that he had *never* encountered even *one* bug or glitch of any kind in *any* Bethesda game. And that is a claim I find laughable.
---
They kind of had to, all the new players with level 1's that only want to play Nuclear Winter.  
---
They need to switch to adventure to pick their specials!
---
Worth grinding for the bloatfly syringe barrel. Collect 10 glands and unlock the mod by scrapping syringers. The bloatflys are in that little cave by the dead brahmin. There's more in toxic valley too.
---
&gt; look cooler
---
Honestly, this is about 50% of my consideration hehe :)
---
I'm not that stuck on damage (PvE is pretty easy). But looks, now, that I care about. I like flavour :)

I have almost never experienced any major bugs/glitches. My two best friends experienced almost every single one and quit a few months ago, so I think it's also up to random chance. I've been playing since beta and it has definitely improved by a fair amount, although I understand how some people can still be jaded from the release. A few times on here I have mentioned how one of my characters was rendered unplayable by a bug, and ot if people down voted and didn't believe me. I just started over and kept going because it's a Fun game. Not a ground breaking emotional story driven life experience, but a very Fun Game.

Thanks for the reports on this one, all. We've investigated this issue and have a fix in place that we're currently looking to release with our next update.
---
I came back after a fresh install and found it was the same Fallout 76 gameplay I've come to know and rely on:
---
* Created a new character. Crashed to desktop upon leaving character generation.
---
* Returned to old character. Quested for an hour. Crashed to desktop upon loading into building. 
---
* Got hung up trying to access two separate terminals, resulting in the game playing the 'walking towards terminal' animation indefinitely until I had to force-quit the game.
---
In other news, Nuclear Winter is pretty fun. But I would have thought that after 6+ months they'd be able to at least get the basics of loading their world and ensuring quest objects worked down by now. I guess it's expecting too much.
---
Hope not. There is the leader board issue all over again as in Survival
---
No just junk items
---
Some of those hairstyles you have to admit I’m not quite sure are from any era...lol.  Like the Mohawk with whatever is going on by the ears there.  I’ve seen my dad had some different looks growing up, but I can’t imagine that was in vogue.
---
Lets be real.  Anyone who played the Beta and the launch knows it wasn't in shape for launch.  The hate for the game at the start was deserved.  The problem was the hate train lasted while the game kept getting better and better along with fix after fix with every update.
---
Beth fucked up, but they made sure to fix it.  I took a good 3 months break, when I came back to some major updates It felt like a different game in adventure mode, now with nuclear winter the game is a fantastic game.  I'm proud to say I feel my money is worth it from a team who was so dedicated to fixing their mistakes.  The first few months of playing, I was pretty angry to where I spent my money.
---
So lets not pretend people where just hating the game for no reason.  I agree a lot of youtubers and personalities jumped on the hate train just to get views and such, but it was still a really really bad launch.  
---
In the end Beth redeemed them self's and made their game great.  That's what matters in the end and what I hope  people remember.
---
Thanks for the tips!  I'm on PC.
---
Yh, sometimes the Fit In or F@*k Off attitude really gets out of hand.
---
&gt; Started development near the launch of the game, human NPCs were not intended to be in Fallout 76.
---
I will truly never understand why anyone thought this was a good idea? They take the time to make a world 4x larger than FO4 and decide to NOT populate it? And the "reasoning" is it's 'too near the great war'.. so in other words you purposely and arbitrarily painted yourself into a corner? Not to mention it's not even adhering to it's own established canonical conventions (super mutants being around).
---
So they make a giant world, DON'T populate it, and then rely on "we want every human you run into to be a real person"... but the world is huge and the player cap is low... so it still feels very empty. None of the design philosophy makes any sense.
---
Harpers ferry and watoga station. I think it’s 1.5k caps
---
Probably $50 and I been playing since beta.
---
Fuck that, I always get excited when I have a squeaker on my team. They're on summer break and have nothing better to do than get good at NW. 12 year olds keep me alive.

- Literally THE ENTIRE THING is related to this issue
---
Yea not the best week to do the GoatSquatch or Dragon Queen, but it'll be invested in the long run
---
Except the values from Specials still count for perk usage. 
---
For example, you need 9 strength on your adventure guy to use Walking Arsenal card in NW.
---
Shit. I just started a new character and was going to binge all week
---
Kill it faster and it won't happen!
---
I’ve heard the Strangler Mirelurks provide that.
---
Doood, thank you for the advice. I’m pumped I can see that now. But right? It would be so cool to display your BR win count in camp.
---
yeah getting overseer is great
---
Yeah! I like the idea of patches and updates these days! The game creators can release a game, listen to the audience reaction, and THEN adapt after launch! I used to be against it, I used to think if I buy a game, it should be finished. But I think it gives players a chance to have input in the game creation as they play! And the content updates are free!
---
You can tag components for scrapping, yes.
---
There's two ways to do it; 
---
* On the crafting menu for the item you're trying to craft, there should be a button to 'Tag for Search'. 
---
* In your pipboy, under Junk, you can 'View by Components'. This shows you all the scrap available, and what you currently possess. You can go through this list and 'Tag for Search' just like the step above.
---
'Tagging for Search' will show a magnifying glass by any junk that contains the components you're trying to find.
---
I would agree, I spent my session going for challenges. They were "do-able" and engaging.
---
There might be some at blackwater mine since its somewhat a heavily fought mine. Its always right next to the armor workbench.
---
Never bought atoms and never will. If I cant afford it with atoms I've earned, I wont buy it. F#$k in game purchases.
---
Just use the nuclear klaxon sound like when someone launches a nuke or something :)

LOVE that sound :)

---
E3 special and 500 once to get the silver excavator
---
Can you tell us some lore in the vault you’ve learned from unlocking areas? And how long has it taken you to get to rank 29?
---
I'll add you later today. Though I'd rather join in the slaughter than leech, if that's cool.
---
I think they should just give all of the cards to everyone. 
---
When making a build, I don't want to feel over powered or lucky, I just want to have a good build. And I want other people to have good builds too, especially because there's no solo mode (choosing not to have auto-fill doesn't count). There are some crazy perks in this mode, and some come across as extremely over powered when luck is involved. If it was just about choosing your build, certain things would be less offensive. Solo queuing into a group of randoms would be less of a negative without a big layer of build RNG that has cascading effects on the value the group gets out of loot. 
---
Any Paragon players out there (RIP)? Card pack RNG was a big contributing factor to that game's demise, and I'd hate to see it happen here. Nuclear Winter doesn't need to be super competitive, but it needs to feel fair most of the time. There's nothing fair about randomly acquiring perks that can completely transform your character. There's enough RNG in the mode itself, and I think perks are a good place to remove a bit of it and empower players with choice. 
---
Sure, they'll have to come up with something else for their progression system. Getting special stats that you can allocate without having to go to Adventure mode would be a good start. They could have alternate card art for cards. More gun skins. Vault suit recolors. Atoms. There's a lot they could do.
---
I'm only saying that you can play other thing in the game. It's really not a big issue if you don't focus on that. If it's the way what you want play then yes... it's a big issue. But it is not a big issue for all us. I am just giving perspective.
---
You're still making the same idiotic point: If they say positive things, they're right and they played enough and I agree. If they don't say enough positive things, they're wrong and they haven't played enough and I disagree. In the end, it's just you that is deciding whether or not they have any points based on your own flimsy criteria that if they aren't positive, they're wrong. Not whether or not they make reasonable points, just whether or not you, personally, agree.
---
Also gives you some special point swapping levels for that juicy BR card you picked up, but are 1 or 2 special points away from using.  Jump into adventure mode and adjust as needed, as long as you have extra levels to do so.
---
I mean, it's all also related to Fallout 76. So can we talk about NPCs since that's also related? Let's talk about NPCs. My favorite is 3-Dog. He is an NPC and NPCs are related to Fallout 76's New DLC which is related to canvas bags.
---
(Just because it's related, doesn't mean it's relevant)
---
Sort of, it still can happen. But less likely with people putting vendors away from main structures.
---
What level are you currently?  I ask because I sometimes enjoy helping out players, but it’s much better if they’re at least level 10 or so
---
As far as I know, no. I don't think my team mates had any either since they were pretty new to the game. Not sure about enemy players though
---

---
Man slipknot has really changed over the years.
---
Luckily, there is no pvp in adventure mode unless someone attacks you, and you attack back - or they contest your workshop. Most griefers go to Survival mode! People in adventure mode tend to work together, do lots of trading, and socialize!
---
More times then not, power armor isn’t the best choice. It’s a cheap and effective choice in pve though. No need to spend 10-25k for good gear but power armor ends up very limited. I’m sure that will change in time though. Hopefully they will release legendary pieces with its own legendary effects.
---
If they load slow, this will still happen. They just need to load your camp assets before quick traveling or just QT away and back again.  
---
If it still happens, try moving your vendors further away. If he uses the camp teleport and isn't in group should do the trick. If in group, it will teleport him differently.
---
Have some god damn faith!
---
same as adventure mode.
---
I'm hoping someone makes a video of port-a-fortin' tho
---
It was...rough...at launch. I don’t think as bad as everyone said but there was a glaring lack of endgame, on top of quite a few glitches that could be frustrating/game hindering. But my Fiancé and I stuck through it from the beta and now we’re lvl 100 without using a single exploit and are raking in the dough with our vendors.
---
Shoots an additional projectile, 15% faster reload, and 10% damage while aiming. You have to get it by doing farm stuff. Take over Billings Homestead, kill a creature with a farm tool, grow plants, harvest a wild plant, and I believe milking Brahmin.
---
Meh I still think it's an uninspired and boring fallout game. I hope the NPC update helps it. But the MMO feel to it (The effect of everyone rushing out of a starting zone and fighting mobs that keep respawning) and the wonky combat system with bad hit detection just ruin it for me. The atom store really sucks too. Some of the best customization items are there, and so expensive.
---
I try ti like it, but still just can't really fall in love like I did every other fallout game I played.
---
Also, forced pvp servers and latency issues suck. Private servers will hopefully help there.
---
Is it too much to wish that this was instead a standard fallout game with some MP co-op capabilities?
---
Right?  
---
They seem very guarded about the Summer DLC preferring to focus on stuff much farther down the road instead.  When can we learn the estimated release dates of the new Vault raids and other new features lie the prestige system?!?
---
I don't think they should be unkillable, there should be *some* stakes, but I would be much happier if they would fix whatever automatically kills them on load in. It's not an enemy or player, there is something very broken with this feature.
---
Meeee toooooo.
---
If you tell me how to format a spoiler tag on mobile, yes. Hah. I’m not good at mobile Reddit.
---
As for getting to Rank 28, I played all day Monday(from the time maintenance ended to about 5am) and all day Tuesday (from 10am to 9pm). Then I had to go back to work, so I only had about 5 hours yesterday to play. So... total hours played 37 hours?
---
These are most likely the same people that said repair kits would destroy the game.  Personally, I like the improved ones.
---
Yep it is :) Grafton has lever action rifle too I know that one used to be hard to find, and the whitesprings/enclave bunker shops sell all kinds of stuff now too, a lot of power armour plans including X01 in the production wing of the bunker
---
There should be a stringer that turns humans into ghouls or super mutants allies
---
Nice Hyperbole, holy shit you're dense.   
---
It's 100% relevant considering that the only reason we're just now getting the bags is because it's illegal for them to not ship them or provide a refund. It's literally the same conversation.
---
All the hate for this game is generally from the series of fuck ups on Bethesda's part. This sub is extremely supportive of 76, which is admirable, but to the extreme. This sub will let you think that the game was just as good at launch and say that big issues were only issues for 'bandwagoners and a few people'. Any legitimate criticism is totally brushed off and history is revised here. You're not really going to get a solid answer here, just as you would get an overly negative one that doesn't take into account the improvements if you asked on r/Fallout. Both subs are prerty opposite, each compensating for one another by being more and more extreme in their beliefs. If you have a look at the recent posts, it's all praise for the game, justification for its poor launch 'because New Vegas was bad too' etc. You're not really supported in having a negative/not entirely positive opinion in here. Bit of an echo chamber to be honest.
---
I like this advertisement. 3/10
---
I have a really good theory that I want to put together about ZAX and the original vault dwellers of 51. Maybe I’ll just put it together in a “spoiler” post.
---
As a note, you can hack in game terminals to get that info. Dunno if that is what they meant but it IS possible and an intended benefit of the Hacker Perk card.
---
I finished the powering posidion event
---
Mine by default go in "documents/my games/fallout 76/photos".
---
Doesn't seem to care if it's a photomode or camera shot it all goes there.
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
---
Noise kills
---
The child he pretends to be in Fallout 4 doesn't have an accent, though.
---
same, i guess they won't even allow us to play during the free week either. sent a support ticket, they have not answered yet
---
Thank you
---
I have played Bethesda games since Fallout 3. My computer is strong enough to run them all at 60 fps, except 76.
---
except frog legs, which will most likely be a must-have once more people get it. so easy to hop around and get an advantage in a 1-on-1
---
This would be huge in my opinion
---
Fallout 4? I didn’t know he was in that
---
Missing double barrel shotgun
---
check this official Bethesda link in regards to bugs in challenges for NW .....
---
It's the same impulse that makes people stick with obviously harmful religions, cults, health fads, etc... mind you that's a wild oversimplification and possible broad brushing, but we all have the need to feel like we're right. Examination of our choices can be very painful. And some people take these identities too much to heart and it becomes this sort of bizarre battle of wilful blindness.
---
I truly enjoy aspects of this game. I have never blindly based it nor praised it... but as much as the true "haters" are a pain in the ass and a waste of storage space/bandwidth on Youtube, the hardened "Todd Did Nothing Wrong" fanboys are equally vexing.
---
I do not hate Bethesda for delivering a fundamentally broken game release that has since been patched to an acceptable day 1 level of "quality"... it's still far below what I'm used to but I can accept that Bethesda does not make polished games and never will. I absolutely enjoy the game when it work. But my experience is not invalidated just because someone loves Bethesda and everything it does. Or loves all things Fallout. These are not even remotely equivalent.
---
I don’t mind chipping in a few bucks :) If you’re in Europe, let me know- where I live, the game is EXTREMELY on sale at the moment.
---
The sneak peak ends than. I guess they could take it away if they really wanted to. They could also just end the sneak peak and release all it's content.
---
Full support
---
I do way better when I solo and hide until the last 5 players.
---
Is the take all button gone? You could just grab it all and drop shit if not.
---
That would be awesome but at the same time, NCR rangers will be everywhere. The NCR have taken over WV.
---
I love this idea... it is a bit anti-climactic right now.
---
My idea of an online Fallout world was basically keep your head down and stay away from players unless you have superior firepower. But even when you could grief other players and their camps, it was a surprisingly chill environment. Did some basic trading with friendly-looking randoms, even though you were nervous they’d see your inventory and find a reason to kill you.  
---
In short, it’s the most laid-back, friendly online game I’ve played, and if you see a high level player coming at you, you’re way more likely to get a gift of some water &amp; food than a shotgun to the face.
---
Edit- and the new updates only made it skew even more towards the friendly side
---
i personally enjoy sitting on the benches in the train station and waiting my turn, gives me time to make a run to the fridge.
---
What are some must have perks? I see no reason to unequip life giver
---
That's why I usually spawn a short distance from my team and loot before i join them. Grab all my loot to get my gear then split other gear and resources I don't need with the rest if the team
---
Pretty bad on my high end freshly built PC (like a week prior to BETA for unrelated reasons). And given how poor the graphics look (just take a gander at those trees... ouch!) it's pretty jarring how poorly optimized the engine is.
---
Would it be worth buying? I wanted to give it a chance but waited and waited until prices will drop and then I saw all the negativity. Do you think it would be worth a shot??
---
i read some where that it comes from the little baby mirelurks, but those always get killed immediately by my mutations, so i dont think ill ever get it lol
---
hi redditors, this stream was fun, we will be streaming it tonight if you want to follow the shennanigans, ty and have a great day!
---
Level 22 right now, mostly just need help with the events and all since some of them are pretty hard solo haha
---
This guy has several accounts. I’ve seen him under nicepingforme on other videos. I wonder how many variations of those names he’s got
---
Well there ya go! Hahaha thanks for sharing that!
---
Great idea
---
Right? I think they were trying to go with the “It’s the apocalypse, we can do whatever we want without people” direction. Didn’t quite work out, world felt partially dull and most of the quests became quite repetitive and boring with the main questline being underwhelming. I wouldn’t mind a human or uniquely written “big bad”, similar to The Master for this new questline. The Scorched questline was underwhelming.
---
I actually wish they had special challenges like this, that were essentially impossible, but worth like 1000 atoms
---
Awesome, first thing i thought playing nuclear winter is can't wait to have a map in the Mire!
---
I try not to show off high level stuff to new players or jump around like a crazy marsupial.   
---
I made someone a level 25 lever action rifle last night because they couldn't find one and they were super fascinated and impressed with it. I didn't want to minimize their world by pulling out my legendary weapons and lighting everything up. So I just use a combat knife and Vault-Tec suit.   
---
With great nuclear power comes great responsibility. Don't be that high level jerk and kill everything near them.
---
Lesson learned.  Don't listen to just what people tell you to think.
---
Yeah! I got a lot of atoms yesterday not even trying to. I knew something had changed
---
👀
---
No worries lol, I know what happens when you dare voice criticism in this circlejerk of a sub. I got the game for free and I still can't get myself to really play it. It's just poorly executed in every way, very boring and nobody I usually play games with wants to get it. I am literally getting laughed at when I ask if someone wants to play some fo76 :D
---
If the game launched today it would get probably a lot of 7+ reviews, if it waited until Wastelanders to launch it would probably get a lot of 9+ reviews because NPCs and Companions are probably going to be what really makes the game feel 'complete' for a lot of people.
---
I really do think they just launched too soon for whatever reason.
---
It was never designed to make the money from the sale of the game itself.  The ATOM shop is the source of revenue.
---
Is it really not a big issue or has everyone just resigned that this is how it is? It isn't worth taking them since they are so easy to lose by the server crapping out. Not because they aren't fun to go for or build up.
---
Next year
---
I will do from now on. 🙏
---
Talk about bad RNG. I've only got a few dupes, by level 20.
---
Also when can we expect Summer's Nuclear Winter Roadmap? Like the one we got for Spring's Wild Appalachia. There's tons of us who want to see dates listed and all the other stuff coming before Fall
---
Yep, that's right! $$$ Ka-ching! $$$
---
Edit: Seriously though, it is the same for the same for the Elder Battlecoat but they did it ;-)
---
And someone pointing out that there *are* flaws isn't the same as someone "hating" the game. I quite enjoy playing Bethesda games. The debacle with the deep price cut two weeks after launch means I won't be pre-ordering or even buying on launch day any of their titles going forward, but that doesn't mean I *won't* buy their titles. Recognizing flaws in something isn't a bad thing.
---
Bethesda makes good games. They're not *perfect*. Not by any means and anyone who says they are is delusional. But they're still *good* games, even with the flaws. And as a bonus, we now know that they *will* put in the effort to try and correct those flaws if/when possible. Can't say that about all the big publishers out there.
---
My team wiped in third place, but we stay as watched the rest of the game, and that was basically what happened. Team of 4 on the ground, with two people on the bridge. The ground team killed the SB, but it landed on the bridge. 
---
We had to wait for the storm to fully close on the map for the game to finish. Two of the ground crew died, but then the bridge group wiped. I was really rooting for them though.
---
About a month ago when there was a holotape data mined or something. It was talking about a guy in a crate and him getting out. On one of the terminals in Vault 51 it talks about how there’s life sign detected in one of the delivery’s but that’s the only thing I’ve found personally. 
---
I’m on mobile too so I don’t know much lol
---
They released a $39 early access survival game as a finished $60 title, and Elder Scrolls was announced to be not coming out for a long time, everyone decided bethesda is the worst thing that ever existed.
---
What's really the point of hiding players? And if someone &lt;10 wants to play with their friend who's been playing longer? Are they just SOL? 
---
The suggestions you're making would turn off more players than it would attract.
---
They mean make Nuclear Winter free to play. It's already planned and announced to be free with the purchase of the base game, just like all the other DLC we've gotten.
---
I haven't played before Nuke Winter was released but I'm up to about 6 server disconnects and 1 full game crash
---
I bought 5 from a player vending machine and it didn't register me using it till the fifth one. Just a heads up.
---
After the wastelanders dlc i believe
---
K good to know.
---
Okay because I was trying to open the building menu last night and it wouldn't work. Going to try again later.
---
Not to contradict your point or anything just found it amusing that you pointed out Fallout 2 releasing in 1998, while both Silent Hill and Grand Theft Auto Vice City released after being 1999 and 2002 respectively.
---
Thats why I play fallout and not fortnight
---
Don't get hit by them.
---
I'm a new player so I haven't discovered a ton of farming locations yet, but the "Fertile Soil" event that repeats at the Vault Tec Agriculture center next to Flatwoods repeats every 40 minutes for me, and I get 10 aluminum and 10 lead in about 10 minutes from killing the Protectrons and Handys.
---
Good job
---
Adhesive is also super useful early game, but it is not the big of a deal later, don’t be afraid to use it up but definitely grab as much as you can!
---
&gt; for god knows what reason
---
God may not know, but I can tell you.
---
They noticed that people werent buying enough atoms with real money.  they only had two choices, either produce a bunch of quality stuff for the atom shop, so that players wouldnt be able to keep up with the free challenge atoms, OR make it so players werent able to actually earn enough free atoms, and were *forced* to spent real dollars if they wanted *anything at all*
---
i for one am shocked that its not a lot worse
---
It is completely dependent on the store. There is no company wide policy walmart to follow sadly. It can vary by manager as well.
---
Fireproof perk takes away some explosive damage done to you, so does the Dense torso mod for armor pieces. Both of those together bring down the damage a lot.
---
I always get the dick wandering around with the trade emote constantly
---
No im just making shit up. Wastlanders is after NW so i assume as little as a week or as long as a month?
---
Part of my daily routine is dropping off excess chems/meds/ammo to lower level players. I pretend to be part of the great Appalachia sweepstakes. It's good fun.
---
I'll be honest, a very small conspiratorial part of my brain almost wonders if some of these almost extreme manic high level of praise posts are fake... not shills but people trying to drive people away. Like Adam Scott's character in season 3 of The Good Place for those who watch the best show on TV ;)
---
Then I say "what are you, a big stupid head" to myself and chuckle at all of those who are so wrapped up in a publisher they view as their best friend or worst enemy. They're a business entity who wants to make the most money for the least effort. Outside of some indie studios and CDPR, I don't see a lot of game companies that are going the old Blizzard or Valve route of "we'll release this when it's done".
---
Yeah, that's what I was saying.
---
Tactics, lol
---
Something like that would be nice, along with fixes for the duplicate card stuff. I'm only Level 15 in the mode and have gotten the Aquaboy card at least ten times already, followed by several copies of Demolition Expert.
---
I'm PC, and will need to check that when I get home from work as well. I'm quite sure it would have been big news when they allowed that feature.
---
Well at the very least prestige system was mentioned in the yearly roadmap. Also vault raids.
---
Don't you dare harm Mr. Tickles
---
I'm pretty sure there is another entry on that terminal that is a log file of Zax analyzing Braun's voice and personality, and then using that information to impersonate him to have the armor delivered to Vault 51.
---
I have to ask though, why wouldn't you just permanently keep your integrated graphics disabled? I mean my PC doesn't even have integrated graphics and it doesn't affect anything.
---
It was actually next to a teddy bear, a rag, and a piece of paper that can’t be picked up. Just found it again. Assuming it’s a static spawn.
---
The fact it's possible to get duplicate perks for this mode is pretty ridiculous. These perk cards give players an advantage which is only balanced by the fact it's limited how many you can equip, and other players also have access to the same or similar perks to give them their own advantages. If someone gets a ton of duplicates they're put at a disadvantage based solely on bad luck.
---
Massive Fallout fan here but I avoided this like the plague after reading about the negativity and as well as not liking the idea of an online Fallout.
---
Well I finally dived in tonight since it’s the free week on Xbox, so far I’m enjoying it quite a lot. More than expected.
---
When do they plan on adding NPC’s?
---
Solo queue is a MUST. People just don't communicate here, not having 4 friends is a good way of getting in 1 vs 4 fights. And I already have trouble with 1 vs 1. Maybe some quick markers and stuff like in apex legends would help.
---
The server drops are terrible, but I didn’t expect any difference. I logged in yesterday and someone had nuked Grafton. I suited up to farm flux and Pve-xp. I get there and it doesn’t look like anyone had been there or ever came... before the server crash. After I was reloaded in all my (40) raw flux had become inert and all my (20) food was spoiled.     Mu$&amp;@-f^&gt;&lt;£  stupid server crash cost me an hours work.
---
You earn it in game at a really reasonable rate so I just go with that. Bit of a grind but i like a good grind so im cool with it.☺
---
Firepoof...
---
Yeah, visiting vault 51 for more than 3min at a time would definetly help to catch all the lore.
---
Man I wish I could have got the footage. I was scrambling to save all my scrap and get somewhere over encumbered for probably 10 minutes so it was all gone :/
---
All week I've been dropping off supplies at Overseers camp. Most of the noobs run away - but maybe they come back after I leave and check the bags.
---
While I agree almost entirely with everything you've just written, I will say that the negative feedback has pushed them to listen to the playerbase as a whole. The long-winded "goodbye, 76" posts may have contributed little to nothing, but people who talk about mechanics they'd like to see changed, while still playing the game, are probably the reason that it's started to shift the way it has.
---
Friendly fire in BRs doesn't work out, the jerk teammates kill whoever gets the gun they want
---
The amount of detail on vault 51 is incredible
---
Cool, thanks. I listed the ones that you had special values for.
---
There should be a cut scene for this. As the circle grows smaller, the player (in first person view) would look around frantically before the ladder drops to be swooped off to safety just in time to see all of Appalachia charred and in flames. Or if the safe zone is on a cliff the winning team would have a cut scene of leaping off the cliff into a vertibird just as the flames reach. Unlikely and doesn't fit, but some cool ending would be nice.
---
I feel a lot of people would complain about it later on though And it would just be messy and they’d probably take it out after a week or month but It would be interesting to have that stress of worrying about your team mate backstabbing you. Idk it would be interesting.
---
Thanks for your input. I was looking to see a post like this to come back and start playing 76 again. Going to play a little tonight.
---
Yeah, I like the game a lot, but while playing I can't ever fully shake the feeling that it's empty and not in a good way
---
They can also do what fortnite did. Make Battle Royale free, while adventure and survivor paid.
---
Oh I wouldn’t dare...I mean Mr. Tickles is behaving for now.  Hopefully his worldview doesn’t shift!
---
Thanks. Good to see there's more intelligence cards. I only had 3...
---
I mean as an interior. Right now it's just a solid wall with a vault texture over it, you can clip through to see some rubble
---
Yeah it seems hacking is becoming more and more of an issue on PC now with NW.

---
There's the post
---
If only my friend can stop talking about it badly whenever I'm playing it in the party. 😦
---
This! I've spend 0 real dollars but I did get the E3 special but that's the only thing I've spent any money on.
---
Aside from everyone trying to kill each other the place looks very habitable. Much more than 76.
---
Angry marines would've just ignore you and/or swear at you so loud your eardrums would explode.
---
Indeed, some people will just jump on the hatewagon because it's the new 'cool' trend.
---
But unfortunately some people will dismiss any criticism as 'being a hater' and that's really bad for the game.
---
The cross-mode rewards are listed in the Atomic Shop. The first few chests are actually player icons, chests you can build at your CAMP come later.
---
Maybe August or JulyV
---
Yeah, thats true. When I had a mega sloth he kept drugging my visitors with his back spores.
---
   Let's repeat this one last time, I'm done feeding you after this; you can take this trolling somewhere else. You still don't understand what I'm saying here... what I'm saying... and I will simplify it even further one last time is that... there is fake news. Real information will cover both the positives and the negatives with proper researching done. A large portion of the reporting on this game and how terrible it is has been based off of incorrect information passed around along with a mixture of old information. 
---
   I think this game had a horrible launch, I think they made some horrible decisions and actions but I can also see the good they have done as well as the hard work they have put into the game to fix their mistakes. You have every right to trash the game and say it sucks but you better have something to back up what you are saying instead of expecting me to mindlessly believe you.
---
?*
---
I have only had the invisible glitch when u enter a building, they fixed it now
---
You sure can! And it should have been, but wasn't.
---
And it should be noted, you can change your display name. Not account name. Like now I display as FruitLupes but I still have to use AlcaTabs to log in.
---
I think it will answer the question, was nuking and killing the queen enough to stop the spread? I'm inclined to say yes, unless we vaccinate everyone who comes back.
---
You can find that Overseer's body close to Vault 76.
---
To add in they let rampant duplication exploits go on for months wrecking the economy and were still feeling the effects.
---
Good question, and one I can’t answer. Maybe I should... Haha! 
---
Doesn’t take away the fact that Bethesda messed something up in one of their updates, even forcing the game to use the nvidia card through nvidia’s program doesn’t work. It used to work fine before patch 10.
---
Have you found a complete list of perk cards yet. Still waiting for those.
---
Is ZAX mean to everybody? Or as I'm being killed constantly, he just says bad things? Just wondering
---
Its being downvoted cause its known. You can go to the webpage and see exactly this kind of thing.
---
So ppl just get tired of the same posts over and over and no, hitting the social media 100 times a day does not make that process move any faster. Sadly...
---
Really? Cuz last night, it was FULL. All under level 10, mind you... but FULL.
---
Agreed, we either need to be able to select our perks or have separate special points for nuclear winter. I'm a heavy gun build but I haven't found a single heavy gun perk card in 17 levels. Have plenty rifle and charisma cards that I can't use though
---
u/AKA-Doom
---
I’m a big fan of this game and have played since release, but at launch and thereafter, I feel the criticism was well deserved. 
---
Companies have to hear when they’ve messed up, cause if they really care then it will keep them in check, and I think the community done a sound job of making their opinions heard. 
---
After all, I’m certain they would have not been so quick on a road map full of content if they hadn’t heard the voices of their disgruntled customers. They gotta keep people playing somehow, and for full price at launch, the content was not there.
---
Hell no
---
I respect your commitment to the game with that level of lag from that video.
---
Hats off to you my friend.
---
Yeah, last night I helped out a fresh vault dweller by crafting them a level 1 .50 hunting rifle with full mod package. Just fun making someone’s day, went back and forth between farming legendaries and helping him and a few low levels out. It’s fun and when you have the extra mats, why not?
---
I also built him a camp, on a junk pile with all workbenches, and an industrial water purifier. 
---
It’s just that once you are farming all the high level spots and looting everything, you tend to wind up with an excess of everything except ballistic fiber, so there’s no downside to helping someone who is just starting.
---
I would say to.expect it in full within a month and a half to two.
---
Haha. Wow, thank you for the Initiative, but I'm from Latin America (Chile to be more precise) and I play on American servers (I guess? I've never asked myselft where I'm connecting to). :)
---
Oh and let us not forget they sold the game for 60$ at launch and then a week or two after discounted it to 30$.
---
They could. I noticed that only atom store skins go to NW. Which means spend money to show off in NW. So free to play NW is a possibility, but there's the challenge of how to get a custom character in there without starting adventure mode. Create a whole separate character creator on top of existing large one would be tough. 
---
Maybe a permanent demo where you play with a default unless you buy game.
---
Really what were your specs?
---
I was playing in 4k on Ultra and experienced so few localized problems aside from the global ones.  i9 7940x and EVGA 2080 Ti Hydro
---
A really nice falloutish twist they could add.
---
I’d rather see them implement solo player games
---
I’m not much of a team player
---
Specifically a 'Godzilla meets Bambi' Easter egg.
---
&gt; Statistically speaking with random cards one would be pushing 160 packs before they got them all
---
what statistics are you using?
---
with 73 different cards, equal weights and dupes not being blocked it would likely take waaaaaaay more than 160 draws to get them all, or even to come close.  like, thousands.
---
idk about everyone else.  but i dont think very many players (relatively) will even be getting to lvl 73...
---
I got suppressor which reduces enemy dmg by 30% for a couple seconds, need 9 points in charisma to use it tho
---
Need to know your full computer specs before anyone can give you advice outside of updating your drivers.
---
We're not talking about the game anymore. We're talking about you. 
---
Why are you here, on a sub for a game you don't like, telling us this sub is a circlejerk [over](https://pay.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c06ups/i_was_so_wrong_about_this_game/er2avka/) and [over](https://pay.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c06ups/i_was_so_wrong_about_this_game/er2bqft/) and [over](https://pay.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c06ups/i_was_so_wrong_about_this_game/er2ii6w/) again for hours at a time?
---
great find! thanks for sharing!
---
Yes, You have your occasional grief monger. But all in all most people are courteous to others. . . Unless you're looking for trouble, lol.
---
RadLemmings for sure, it was horrible. And still happens, not just with Fallout.   
---
Copy/Paste culture.
---
Only the funny long arms when leaving power armor glitch.  But enjoyed and miss it hahaha
---
all the ones without numbers costs 1 that was the idea, since anyone can use them
---
As a Melee character I do what I can to craft ammo for allies, but once I hit those bottlenecks eventually I sell or dump.
---
Gotta keep that stash trim!
---
Every gun feels much better than in adventure, you are more fragile than in adventure. It feels somewhat as the balance in FO4 survival mkde. Dunno, if they weaken legendary effects and put more punch to weapon themselves while also making us a little more frail it would solve a lot of problems with lack of any kind of challenge.
---
I'm hoping we get more expanded content including the enclave and BOS. It would be nice to see the brotherhood make a return in wastelanders and interact with the enclave. Would be the perfect way to introduce more faction based play and  game mechanics
---
keep in mind.. nuclear winter is the name of the BR mode and also the name of the current block of content lasting all summer
---
wastelanders is the next block of content starting in the fall..
---
I would hope that even if its still in beta.. the NW BR mode will be permanently up before the content block of the same name expires a few months from now..
---
Not applicable in NW
---
yeah hes/its kind of a snarky stinker
---
Fallout 3, rather, that was a typo!
---
I don't seem to have experienced as many as others. Biggest one is trying to swim to the Ohio side of the map, but getting stuck underwater while clipping through rocks.
---
Lol I didn’t downvote you, but okay
---
Its coming out after wastelanders. What else do u need lol
---
I'm glad they're made the game much better than it was and that people are coming back. A lot of people, especially YouTubers and stuff who haven't played the game in months, still bad-mouth it a lot and it was rough at first, yeah, but it's so much improved since then. And with the addition of private servers and the upcoming Wastelanders, maybe the game being more like a "traditional fallout game" will help people appreciate it more.
---
How is killing someone just joking around? and if you were why did you take their stuff? I love these posts. I accidently killed someone......
---
My point is that it's likely the devs looked at how much development time they'd been given, realised they could probably get a bare-bones version of the game up and running but little more than that (bear in mind that they were re-purposing the creation engine for multiplayer, which must've been a huge task), and so crafted the narrative around an initial lack of NPCs with the possibility of them being added in later. 
---
Nobody would actually *choose* to bring out a game that's so initially barren, but after being told they had to the devs did their best to turn lemons into lemonade.
---
I agree. I started leveling up an alt just so I could have a more balanced character for NW. My 15 luck, 15 agility with 1 strength and 1 endurance on the main have been just fine in pve but a real hinderance in this game mode.
---
No one in knows for sure but seeing as NW is the main update of the summer block of updates it will be in as little as a couple weeks to as long as a couple months.
---
Thanks y’all!
---
I can say that finding the marsupial serum is good in BR but the perk "Frog Legs" does give the big advantage. Literally everyone runs marsupial in survival mode to avoid being hit. Definitely an advantage in towns like flatwoods where you can jump on a building while people are below you and get the edge of surprise since you can peek from any spot of the roof and also escape with ease. Demolition expert for 80% explosive damage bonus with froglegs and a grenade launcher is definitely very annoying to fight against. If marsupial can save ass against explosive weapons in survival mode then how good it will be in this especially being a perk.
---
I think that would be really cool, though I imagine there might be some sort of gradient of adding factions to the game. Maybe it’ll be settlers and raiders first, and later on we’ll start getting more and more factions as word spreads Appalachia is back open for business.
---
I just think it makes a company seem lazy and unoriginal when they add shit that doesn't have to be there just because fans want it. Like the Brotherhood for example, could have easily made another faction with new lore.
---
It is legit.  Don't listen the high octane frag-head or the sneaky-snake bush assassin, play what works for you.   So completely ignore the rambling below, as I lean toward a sneaky snake.  However, my two wins are on the extremes of that range.
---
Most randoms I'm in are terrified of the circle and want to run to the center.  These teams usually die really early with or without mic communication.  I've been in a few randoms that became pre-mades of 2 or 3 with mics and still never caught a win.
---
First win.  Got in a random and there was zero communication our team lost two members and the two of us remaining split up for about half the game.  We met up again for two more circles and won the game by sneaking around edge, using brush, and cliffs.
---
Second win.  Got in a random with a high octane frag-head that at least knew how to work the ring edge.  We basically ran the entire match and mowed down anything in our path.  Again, the last circle had me and Mr. Octane against a team of two.  Mr. Octane and I both had stealth boys.... they never saw us coming.
---
Cards help as well; +40% for weapons, +80% for explosives, +40% armor ignore for rifles can make a big difference in a quick gun fight.
---
But that bonus damage against everything may be the difference between winning and losing any battle and boosts the damage of all weapons by almost half of what all the other damage boosting perks do.
---
Iv made random friends in survival... But iv been shot in the back by a lvl 7 player too. Just never know.
---
On the flip side some guy was killing everyone even the nubs so i took him on for over an hr so other could move out of flatwoods! What a d bag.
---
Good thing ppl like that typically can't play and made over 100 caps off his ass.👍
---
Damn. Never seen a dude with negative karma before. I salute you armchair developer/edge lord.
---
K thnaks
---
A roadmap for nuclear winter
---
Just tell him if he doesn’t shape up, it’s gonna be a trip to Van Lowe’s.
---
ye its really strong tbh
---
That would be pretty sick.
---
So I was about to log off and a guy walked in, no one ever does pvp so I just wacked him, did some emotes fooling around, he hit me back so I slapped him once and he died, I felt really bad when I realized he had 500 pounds of junk
---
I'd love to play if it weren't for the constant crashing every 5-10 minutes. I have a beefy rig too so I have no idea why its happening.
---
Oh I have gone and gotten them a few times after that...but darned if running into all of those scorch beasts while hunting bugs didn't 'tick' me off a bit.
---
Not the general roadmap... The Nuclear Winter roadmap, detailing the new features and content coming in the next few months.
---
the creature you turn into could even be scaled to your overseer rank.
---
nothing would get people to play NW more than the prospect of turning into a Behemouth or a scorch beast when they die
---
you could even respawn at your original spawn point (sans being damaged by the storm).
---
Well he was put down by some level 200s griefing my base when you could still do that kind of thing.
---
NW is coming first actually.
---
I've gotten to the point where, if I see a 1* for over 1k caps, I immediately move on. People need to be reasonable with prices...
---
Meanwhile, I don't sell legendaries. I keep level 5/10 upgraded leather armor for sale between 22 and 44 caps a piece and try to keep some aluminum chain wrapped bats on hand for 55 caps with dilluted stimpacks and radaways for sale on the cheap. Everything a newly released Smurf needs...
---
Thats not the hate train though. Admitting problems and handling them is normal, the hate train is the people right now saying things like, "This game is still TRASH!", " Worst GAME EVER LOL" "This game looks like smeared shit XD" "DEAD GAME" "Who plays this trash?!", these are real comments I've seen in the past days during the free week in various communities. I'm positive the people saying this haven't even played the game, which is a shame since I'm sure they'd be genuinely surprised, but I doubt they even care enough to actually give this game a real try.
---
Do you read before thinking up smartass remarks or no? 
---
You have no option to keep them if for some reason you wanted to. you just get 50 xp
---
Ah, Mosstown.
---
The only place where I need to prioritize killing the Scorchbeast before killing the ticks.
---
I think that's been fixed, not 100% sure tho. Touch wood, I haven't had that issue my last few moves.
---
If someone dies of radiation do you get credited with the kill?
---
When it comes to always online multiplayer games there is no delay to make it flawless. They need to put it out into the wild and see what needs to be fixed. They cant really know what's going to happen when millions of people all play at the same time until it happens. Also I've been playing since beta and other then slight performance issues it's the same game with extra modes so this " it deserved all the hate in the beginning " bullshit is so fucking stupid and is a cheap excuse.
---
Seemed like huge coincidence, but whatever. My apologies if i was incorrect. Either way, not like it matters. 😂
---
Well I have a mutation that weapons my energy weapons. That sucks.
---
No worries, glad to help ya :)
---
Jesus Christ.  Why do I bother?
---
No, do not play the game.  You won't like it.  Simple enough for you?
---
Why did they show wastelanders first...
---
Only a 1070ti, 32gb, nvme boot drive. The issues are odd... no vsync or ingame AA was a VERY strange choice for this game, so there is lots of tearing indoors as framerates spike and drop. And textures are butt fugly and horribly pixelated in lots of places (trees, shadows, etc)
---
That would be nice, we already know we are getting new factions in wastelanders and I'm hyped for that. I just hope that they don't neglect the old factions. That being said I do like the idea of the factions eventually coming back. Would make for some interesting content
---
Have you tried going into Adventure mode and blueprint mini-forts to drop down in the BR for cover and advantage?
---
The damage number on any TSE weapon is doubled since both bullets do the weapon card damage. The TSE gat will probably be better since it has explosive and two shot legendary effects. The anti armor explosive will just get closer to the damage card number per shot. I’d say that TSE is better but it does depend on the enemy. Some enemies have a very high damage resist like mirelurk queens but some don’t like super mutant behemoths.
---
Well, the accent fluctuates between the girl and braun’s original voice.
---
Am I the only one who hates the fact that a red tag pops up when you shoot? Instantly gives away your location.
---
I'm doing the trial week and got kicked off the servers twice last night trying to play. Also I've had a weird issue of walking through banks of dirt. I went into a mine between locations doing the responders storyline and had to walked through a wall  of dirt to get to the actual door in.
---
This is so dumb lmao
---
Some tips
---
\-Use voice with your team, and use compass numbers for callouts.-Teamwork wins every time-If playing on PC use Keyboard/Mouse.-If you are not the best at gun play, don't spawn in crowded areas and gear up and survive till the end and kill them with guns you are more comfortable with.
---
\-Try not to give away your position with sound, especially gunfire or running. If you have to kill a monster, use melee or try to fire once or twice but then change positions. Multiple shots make it easier for someone to narrow down your location.
---
\-Also, while sound can be your biggest enemy, it can be your biggest ally. Listen carefully to increase your environmental awareness and get the drop on the enemy instead of them getting you.  
---
If none of those help, then the only way to win, is not to play. And the best part is, it's optional so yay.
---
Have you heard his comments during your gameplay? Nuclear Winter is definitely a simulation.
---
I think ZAX made a battle royale inside the vault. Only the overseer survived, and that is the person that tried to reach vault 76 to warn the dwellers about.
---
You dont have to upgrade the cards, and it's not a waste if your making use of something. This doesnt really seem like a necessity
---
I was wondering on that but the aai with stableized would basically ignore 95% of armor, which the two shot cant. It still deals heavy damage but against the sbq idk which would deal more because she has such a high dr
---
It's possible to teleport and use bunnyhops in CS:GO, so I'd call that equivalent to flying. It's likely possible to give ammo, but that isn't necessary if you have aimbot, so I wouldn't know. The point is that CS:GO is full of hackers. You said they should make it harder to cheat in FO76 like it's harder in CS:GO, but you can easily get hacks and start using them in 5 minutes with low ban risk, even in Comp. Just a bad example no matter how you cut it. But they SHOULD do SOMETHING to prevent hackers, especially bans (permaban would be preferable).
---
Those games were also extremely simple compared to today and only had local multiplayer. So in other words game from then are not even comparable to today's.
---
Yeah, I was trying it over the free weekend, and noticed all the clutter in every house and everywhere.
---
Pretty much whatever you want for them, moreso if they aren't the popular duped versions, ~15- 25k is probably the most caps you could get.  But save it to 1:1 trade for an item you want
---
And people would have complained even more about it not being a real fallout game. 
---
Personally I like that they expand on lot instead of treating it like gospel. The games would be kind of boring if they didn't expect on existing stories, and it's not like they're weren't two new human factions plus the scorched and mole miners introduced.
---
And i read a lot that the explosive on tse isnt as good as it used to be now its only 25% of the damage while it used to be 100%
---
I always  store everything first, haven't had any issues yet.
---
I had glitched ghouls this morning....the sleepy boys are bad enough but getting pummeled by an invisible enemy gets lost fast.
---
Anthem proved them all wrong almost immediately although your way of defining the game is completely accurate with it being early access at that point.
---
Roadmap detailing NW has not been released yet. My assumption is we should see it in the next 2 weeks or so considering it is officially summer and the overall roadmap detailed NW is during the summer season.
---
Manage easier &lt;3
---
I would imagine next week after things get to normal after E3
---
Paging u/ladydevann  ! That would be so awesome!
---
Should be before shouldn’t it?
---
Which means you may have a disadvantage compared to others who had the same amount of drops. But rng I guess.
---
Here's hoping. I'm excited to see what's in store for us.
---
I mean granted it did seem kind of limited but in the end it came out pretty well. The team did well with the plot for the game. I know it's sad to not have NPCs but when the release them it will come out better.
---
For post-game players the only way to obtain ammo is to pay for it, 'aint nobody got time for that'
---
I don't see why there needs to be stakes. Dogmeat in 4 was unkillable, and it was great. 
---
Maybe there could be two types of pets, defensive ones that can die, and just pets that can't be killed, cats, possums, etc.
---
oh dear god. i forgot...
---
If you've played since beta and are only 68, then you don't play very often. That's not a crack; just a fact. Your comparatively limited exposure to, well, everything, likely plays a big part in what you have and haven't experienced, bugs/glitches included.
---
Same I have no idea what's going on, as soon as I walk around I get huge lag spikes as if the map is loading in... Yet I'm on a brand new SSD and new Xbox one X... Wtf, my download speed is 15mbs down and 1.5mbs up
---
The problem though is that the amount of bugs to the amount of hate were in two different dimensions, it was way overblown and unfair.
---
Because the hate train was strong and unwarranted. It had some launch issues, and people ruining the game with exploits but those have been long addressed and Bethesda has done a good job making the game better with each passing month. It just took awhile for the gaming community to realize that they got trolled by people who just were trying to be edgy.
---
Maybe it’s the negative effect of a NW specific mutation.  The positive effect is that you have +3 strength and +3 endurance, but the negative effect is you will continue to get the same perk card.  I’m being ridiculous but that train kept going in my mind thinking of the possibilities.  +8 Strength, but your console will restart at some point in the next hour...etc...
---
And definitelly much more than 111
---
Cause people are addicted to righteous anger.
---
Just make sure to research both sides of the story and make a decision yourself based on what you find; it's what I did and I got the game only one week in seeing the positives far outweighing the negatives.
---
Has to have a condition or else you will just get monster brawl with people suiciding at the start.
---
I think we’ll see the resolution, or at the least the continuation, of the Overseer’s Journey. Mainly because she narrated the trailer, but also because she can provide us with backstory to Vault 79 (if it does appear)
---
What would be cool is if she has two different greetings, one that’s happy to see you, and one that berates you if you’ve launched a nuke before.
---
Enough pipe pistols for each finger &lt;3
---
Yeah you can get some pretty crazy dmg number, I have bloody mess with commando (40% dmg with automatics), then find a bobblehead for another 20% , pop an overdrive while your in a fight for a bonus 25%. The amount of damage you can do in kind of insane.
---
Closer to 200 hours I'd wager.
---
i found the problem!
---
A solution that dates back to *Fallout 4*. You can edit the config file in **%userprofile%\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76\\Fallout76Prefs.ini**.
---
In the **\[General\]** section edit the **bGamepadEnable** property to read:
---
**bGamepadEnable=0**
---
In the **\[Controls\]** section edit the **bGamePadRumble** to read:
---
**bGamePadRumble=0**
---
Edit: if there is no tab for \[Controls\] or \[general\] in fallout76prefs.ini then just write a new one at the bottom and add it like the rest. it worked for me
---
That's a low bar to set :D
---
Never seen it either.. and I'm level 210
---
I do the same thing. Find the black bushes and hide in them. Wait till the last person and attack when he is not looking. Mostly fails because a team is left and not just 1 person
---
Oh my how the tables have turned
---
As a side note I noticed on PS4 even if you delete some pictures from fallout ( because you "reached maximum number of pictures" ) they are still on the PS4 under screenshots.
---
They're still fucked, it's 'safer' to be with a squad in a warzone then just poking around by yourself before you're inevitably slaughtered. If you're really that good then you should just que solo, 3 guys shouldn't be too much more trouble. Not saying you- I just hate when this happens, especially with how long it can take sometimes to get into another match. If the team splits up at ALL your fate is just about sealed.
---
Absolutely NO. Enough of this shoehorning real people into Bethesda games. Youtubers and fans no one heard about till they died? Its totally unnecessary, immersion breaking and just plain stupid. Im sorry buddy died, but people die everyday, they don’t need to be thrust in our face in a videogame.
---
where are all these explosive weapons coming from. have over 100 hours in the game and haven't sniffed one.
---
noice.
---
As I understand it there is a much lower damage increase now with the TS, however the second shot is extremely low accuracy. You might find that overall the AAE might put out more damage for you.
---
Pshh companies used to hand the game out for free
---
Thats what I had feared, that the XP would scale into the stratosphere the further you get. Meaning going from 80-100 will likely require more grind than 1-80.
---
BE handmade will fetch a handsome price, you can probably trade it for any other item you might want.    
---
TSE is still a good item and a top option with trade value but nothing like in the past.
---
They could also make an Infected sort of game mode. Where some people start as ghouls and they have to infect the rest of the players.
---
... you know I'm saying my *character* can carry that much right. I can maybe lift 250 under the right circumstances. I certainly cant run around with it and repair other peoples camps... for real though you dont even know me sport, I dont care what you think, I'm ex military. I've gotten stabbed and shot and basically walked it off. Both of those instances were protecting people also. I give my time to the less fortunate and I'm an amazing listener. If that doesnt make me at least a little badass then I think you dont even understand the word. At any rate you're a pissy little cunt and you bore me. I'm gonna play fallout now. Byeeeeee
---
Mostly see them going for 15-20k on Marketplace
---
If you press TRANSFER you can check the weight (which has a max.) In WATER (CAMP) it says how much it produced
---
Long term I'm really hoping that we get a chance to join and help rebuild and advance the agenda of a faction or factions of our choice. Due to the open world nature of the game that would require that some areas of the game world be instanced to individual players though. Bethesda has been working on instanced areas for the new vault raids so that may be feasible
---
He gets nicer as you rank up
---
Each size shares a pool, you must frequently empty them for more to spawn. You can't just walk away and come back to hundreds of purified water, unfortunately.
---
Yea they can still let people bring stuff over but the magic effects will be gone, so my level 45 bloodied functions the same as the one a noob picked up from a random crate. My only advantage is the attachments, as the one I randomly pick up will be random. Only when the game is fair will it attract real pvp players from other online games.
---
I played the beta and made my choice to buy it from that. Me and my son have been playing since launch and except for a couple stability issues the only thing different are a couple game modes.
---
I’m even more lost after reading this explanation. Bro, 90% of us have no clue what it is you’re even saying. Not trying to be rude, but please be more direct in your sentence structure. It’s all over the place.
---
True, Anthem really showed gamers what bad looked like.  
---
It was so bad, my free copy from buying a video card never appeared on Origin, despite claiming it and Origin stating that I used the code and should have it and months of EA Support chat. I never got to play, and at first I was mad... but now I feel like I dodged a bullet.
---
They definitely price match. I bought my younger sister a copy for PS4. You have to show the item on the Walmart app to the manager. Then they do this long ass process ( at least at my Wal Mart.) The store wanted $40. We got it for $17.99 this was maybe 3 days ago.
---
Not to be a nitpicking nancy but it's actually still spring. Summer starts June 21
---
LOL i traded for one. My rng has been terrible too
---
Actually it's just laziness, not everything is always so sinister.  
---
It's a hell of a lot easier to just push out the same challenges to everyone every day instead of individualizing them or working out a fair scaling system.
---
I am truly terrible in PvP and have avoided it totally in all video games up until NW which I’m actually enjoying. If I try to engage others it’s pretty much instant death for me so instead I just play solo with no team and stay hidden. Last night I came in second just by hiding in bushes naked (because it’s easier to blend in that way.)  I was only killed because a wolf attacked me and I had to fight back which exposed my position.
---
I’m finding it a pretty fun challenge to stay hidden as long as possible. I avoid others by spawning somewhere on the edge that I rarely see others pick. I also always try to stay near the edge of the playable area while everyone else is rushing to the middle. It means I have zero kills but I’m still levelling and getting the cool rewards.
---
Because they felt like it
---
It works in NW itll work in survival otherwise theres still adventure mode
---
Right thats what i read mainly, i read that for snipers and shotguns tse is still better than anything but for most other things aae was better
---
lol yeah, It is definitely a shift in thinking.
---
Thats how i get killed with one shot from pipe pisol, when i shot two magazines in guy spaming stimpaks. I hope they do little more balance.
---
It does that if a nuke was dropped a while ago and it's about to reset totally. I've had all sorts of robots spawn, kinda fun lol
---
Loving the game only lvl 18, only thing that kinda sucked was killing lvl 9 ghouls then suddenly lvl 60+ legendary one and other lvl 60s spawn. Killed a few but the legendary no chance for me.
---
It's not. (Unless the paint is actually just a skin to apply to any power armor.) Technically nuclear winter hasn't even deployed yet, we're just testing a beta-version of the mode.
---
So either the reward is a hellfire skin, or we get the hellfire power armor from one of the vault raids yet to come. We won't know till they either add the hellfire into the game, or someone reaches OR 100. (In a few years.)
---
Just need to learn to play.
---
You have 3 posts total and all of them are you whining and complaining about one thing or another... you seem fun
---
So they are all connected and have power?  Do you have enough power in your base to power the purifiers and everything else that requires power?That's the first, but obvious question. 
---
Are they producing at all? Or nothing?
---
They don't all produce at the same time, its an over time mechanic. 
---
I have 1 industrial, two standards, and several in ground ones, and no issues. I check and empty them all when ever I return to my camp.
---
Are they locked too? If everything is fine and they are not locked, people could be helping themselves to your water. Someone can be in sneak mode at your camp (not shown on the map) and be taking your water.
---
You are wrong and should feel bad. Shame.
---
I'm on Xbox and had the same thing happen yesterday afternoon. It's occurred several times it's just not a lot.
---
Will we get a roadmap for next year? I'm wondering cos they talked about year 2. Would love to see a roadmap for next year.
---
So - here's a question, do you get perk cards by leveling up your overseer rank? How do you get the cards? Where do you find them?
---
May seem obvious but I played about 4 games and found it little fun. Wondering if anything will help.
---
It's still an always online multiplayer game with millions of people playing at the same time. It just has a smaller server cap compared to mmos you consider. Which means it's still going to have the same issues mmo's and many online multiplayer games run into at launch. So get off your high horse and relax a while.
---
That would still make pvp unbalancedm the core of the problem is legendaries. Plus if somebody had a full set of OP stuff that means he'd just be killing everybody and taking their stuff. Itd be the same way as it is now only now all the TSE sentinel people will get to steal your items too. You didnt think that idea through
---
I'm wondering why everyone is making fun of them putting battle royal in when you can get on here or in game and most everyone is loving it. It's being accepted greatly by the community but people (mostly YouTube "influencers") are making fun if them for doing it.
---
Their not skins tho they are their own backpacks you just have to unlock the ability to craft the first
---
Nope, 2 shot is not double damage.  Compare any 1\* 2 shot to the base weapon, with and without mods, with and without perk cards.
---
I strongly believe what happened to the OP has happened to a LOT of players and Bethesda is unwilling to admit yet another huge mistake in a long line of huge mistakes.  To be clear, I am fine with them banning people who actually duped, but I am 100% NOT OK with them banning innocent players who did not dupe, merely because they picked up a bag with duped items.   If Bethesda cannot program a cheat detection system that is capable of telling the difference between someone who duplicated and someone who merely possessed duplicated items, they need to fire that whole department and hire some competent people.
---
I have a friend who I KNOW for a 100% fact never duped that was suspended, who also picked up large quantities of materials in a paper bag as it is common to “take all” for convenience, then dropped them, not because he thought he would get banned, but because it massively over-encumbered him
---
* Back then (long before the ban waves) there was no way for an average rule abiding player to know to be wary of picking up paper bags (as stopping duping and cheating is BETHESDA’s job, not the players, we paid to play, they GET paid by us, that is how this relationship works).  Even after the ban waves began there was no clear indication from Bethesda if they intended on banning players who merely (even for a short time) possessed duped items then dropped them
---
\#1 - First and foremost, Bethesda has made and continues to make mistakes (as all companies and people do). Albeit they do tend to make more than their fair share of mistakes. So this leads to the logical conclusion that Bethesda (either by accident, oversight, negligence or intentionally) suspended / banned players who were innocent.
---
* If you believe Bethesda’s ban wave 100% only caught dupers, then you must live in a fantasy world where Bethesda makes no mistakes and this game was launched flawlessly (without 1,000+ bugs/glitches) to rave reviews and accolades from every person who played it.  Here in the real world, most people know better.
---
\#2 - It is actually quite easy to “acquire” over 3,000 things a day
---
* All you would have had to do was pick up a paper bag that had a bunch of stuff in it (like the OP did).  Even if you dropped it 1 second later, the broken cheating detection system could flag you for cheating as it does not appear to have any way to determine who duped the items.   Imagine a duper drops a paper bag with 200,000 ammo/junk and then another player picks it up, then for no other reason than being over-encumbered they drop it, then the next player finds it, and so on... till 9 innocent players have picked it up and dropped it.  In their current so called “cheat-detection system” all 10 people would be flagged and banned and 9 of them are innocent (all they did was pick something up in the game).  That is so beyond unacceptable it is sad.
---
* Heavy gunner builds I play with can easily burn through 5,000+ x 5mm ammo in a session (meaning they then have to buy / craft 5,000 more), which over 30 days of play would be 150,000+ (but 100% without cheating / duping etc), so it is utterly ignorant for anyone to say that cumulatively having over 100K items in 30 days MUST mean you are a cheater, as that is 100% false.
---
* For the people who say “but I had X items and I never got banned”, well their detection system is as broken and flawed as the rest of their game, so many people may have simply been missed by it and not got banned (innocently or otherwise).
---
* I also 100% know of dupers who didn’t get banned (so their system also fails to catch the guilty as well as punishing the innocent, so that’s great)
---
\#3 - The “over 100,000 items” is cumulative
---
* meaning that if you crafted 5,000 X 5mm ammo, dropped it in a bag, then picked it up again, Bethesda would think you “accumulated” 10,000 ammo, not 5,000, meaning there is a serious flaw in their system that surely flagged innocent players.  You could drop and pick that bag up 20 times and then you could be banned.  Don’t believe me, go try it (and if you are not willing to try it, then maybe you do not believe their system is “flawless”)
---
**Questions for those who believe 100% of banned players are guilty**
---
DID Bethesda ever (in game) warn ALL players to be wary of picking up dropped items in paper bags as they MAY be duped and picking it up (even if immediately dropped) could lead to your being banned?
---
ANSWER:  NO, 100% they did not, so clearly THEY either didn't know that is how their broken detection system works (sad), OR they did know and didn't care that it would absolutely ban innocent players (pathetic) and didn’t bother to tell or warn anyone
---
Are you alright with players being banned for merely picking up a paper bag?  (even if they immediately dropped it)
---
* If you are alright with this, I sincerely hope you get to experience being banned for no good reason.
---
Why is there NO APPEALS?  When Bethesda says “no appeals” what they are actually saying is: “you mean nothing to us, we are Infallible and perfect, screw you”
---
* Failing to even offer appeals is like saying “we are 100% sure no innocent people were banned” which is absurd, incorrect and is ridiculously arrogant.
---
* Other game companies offer ways to appear suspensions / bans, why would Bethesda not do so?
---
IF Bethesda is alright with banning innocent players (ones that did NOT dupe) then they are despicable and do not deserve out money or our time.
---
IF Bethesda merely did what they nearly always do (screw up), then they need to admit it, and review the cases for those who request them (as false bans are one of the WORST things a game company can do to its players).
---
* They seem to have no problem admitting their faults in the game design and launch (which were staggering), but are being silent on their clear mistakes in their ban waves and problems with their cheat detection system.  This shows a lack of transparency (which they have repeatedly claimed they would be “better at”) and a lack of integrity.
---
My suggestion to the OP is to demand a refund from Bethesda in a documented Help Ticket, then when they refuse or ignore you (100% assured) you file a small claim lawsuit (in many places it is easy and inexpensive to file yourself, without hiring a lawyer, and it uses layman language, not legalese).
---
* I doubt they would even appear to defend it (seeing it as too small / petty), meaning you will be able to get a default judgement (you win).  Even if they do appear to defend it, it will cost them much more than to simply give you back your money for their broken game that bans you for playing it and they will have to provide you the evidence of how they decided to ban you (which will require them to provide details of their cheat detection system and how it works / doesn’t work).
---
* I would love to be able to cross examine a Bethesda executive (under oath with penalty of perjury for lying) and ask things like:
---
   * How many customers have you banned?  How many total players do you currently have?
---
   * Do you believe you ban system is perfect and Bethesda is incapable of making even a single mistake?
---
   * Do you believe there were any players banned accidentally?  How many would you estimate?
---
   * How many banned players have submitted help tickets asking to have their suspension reviewed?
---
   * Do you in fact use moneys to program your games?  Or just incompetent people?
---
In fact if ANYONE who (like the OP) believes they were falsely banned and you would like to look into a possible small claims suit against Bethesda, please PM me as I would love to help and be involved as I am sick of people on these forums defending Bethesda’s despicable behavior and treatment of their customers.  If we get enough people, we could even explore a class action suit.
---
it says (OWNED)
---
Which system are you on? Had multiple different errors crashing or disconnecting my games today on PS4, likely due to PSN and not the actual game.
---
Same here.
---
They're locked and I have extra power in case random things attack it.  I have 2 that produce the correct amount. The others don't produce at all, it's always the same two.
---
so do the rewards stop at 100 but the leveling continues? Anyone know what the max level is? or if there is one?
---
I'm on Xbox :(
---
I’d prefer to not know what my actual stats are so I can keep at least a shred of dignity.
---
Yes. In the vault go into your pip boy and look at your perks. You probably have a perk card or two to open up.
---
Edit: You can hold 7 cards at a time. You can have more than one type of card as well.
---
Have you got any antivirus that might be interfering with things? Or do you have a memory editor or similar tools installed on your computer?
---
I think it needs to be separated. The gameplay is totally different from adventure at least for me. But god it's fun
---
Being that next friday is the official start of summer, hopefully we will get it on thursday
---
Ballistic fiber too!
---
Accurate
---
Dont forget to like and subscribe to only the best YouTube channels for all that exhilarating recreational outrage.
---
I feel like this could be cool, but the waves to defend the workshops would need to be MUCH bigger and the rewards for defending them much better.
---
I encounter the glitched ghouls occasionally, I experience the excavator power armor carry weight glitch every day (some may call it an exploit, but it’s been around forever and they haven’t patched it so....), and my personal favorite, the t posed frozen ghoul south of whitesprings next to a car that I built a shrine around, because he is always there. I still think we all need to agree on what to name him.
---
You get them for leveling up and for completing challenges. (Some are super easy like using stimpacks and placing camp down)
---
The devs hate the ultracite power armor apparently. 7+ months and it's had a total of one paint job.
---
I think I'd prefer instigating or AA on a sniper, but for anything up close like a shotgun then TS would probably be good.
---
To me though I would rather the AAE for gatling just because it tends to have great accuracy so works at longer range.
---
Your arguing that people who dont use aimbot are bad at pvp? Your have a low INT stat clearly
---
Yup. Same here
---
I feel like this sub has always been extremely positive towards the game in contrast to the rest of the “fallout fanbase”. We’ve had our criticisms, most of them justified, and we (I say we because that’s my perception of the attitude of the sub) we’re ready to hate this BR mode. But I, like most everyone else here, were well taken back by how much fun we’re having playing this mode. It’s intense, fun, exciting, and can be extremely rewarding!
---
Yea same. Just came here to check
---
These are the same type of brainless idiots who clapped at the E3 Bethesda conference.
---
Servers down.
---
Well that's more of a higher mid tier build, but still shouldn't have issues at 1080p  
---
That's more than enough to drive 60 fps solid at 1080p without tearing. Have you tried G-Sync? You will need a compatible monitor, but it would help with any tearing. Did you see if your CPU is bottlenecking? What is your texture quality set to? It doesn't scale down very well from Ultra.
---
Thank you! I was wondering why mine wasn’t working.
---
Probably a different issue all together then, can't say whether that's related to the game or not then :/
---
I think it might actually be a Playstation Network outage rather than FO76/Bethesda specific.
---
Can’t say I’d agree with you on that, but you made me laugh 😂. I have 20+ wins already.
---
Then wtf cant you leave it at that and move on? Have an upvote for being honest with yourself.
---
Did you place your camp?
---
This would actually be fun af.
---
Great logic
---
So you can gripe? Clearly.
---
Weird..I got booted a couple times...but it’s been working ok for me for a little while  now.
---
Nah mate I just like being a smart arse...
---
Yup, happened to me and is again happening right now twice today, as well as several of the people I've played with in the more recent hours. At this point I can't even sign back into PSN.
---
**EDIT:** Checked out their network status service, it reads:
---
"**Affected Platforms:** Other, PS Vita, PS3, PS4, Web
---
**Affected Services:** You may have some diffficulty signing in or creating an account on PlayStation Network. Our engineers are working to resolve the issue as soon as possible, and we thank you for your patience."
---
There are lies still embedded in their game and now Bethesda gets a pass when it still isn't the game they advertised at the beginning? Now, this behavior will continue on, and not with just Bethesda but other developers and publishers, because they don't have to give you the game you wanted to begin with anymore just something remotely playable that's within the lore of the game franchise that people love despite not being the best game they can create.
---
I don't even get an error, the game freezes for a second or two, then quits to desktop. So infuriating.
---
truth.
---
Removal of legendaries would buff PA because there wouldnt be insane DMG that kills people in PA the same time it kills somebody totally naked
---
I know, but just a tab that has everything you own/have purchased
---
Yup, it's definetely PSN having issues.
---
That was honestly the one that earned your upvote from me. Actually chuckled out loud. The rest of them are a bit more obvious, but that one's the most clever.
---
Ah right ok. We went off and got 2 levels from joining the Enclave. What would be a recommended level to fight the enemy? We knocked him to a quarter health with power armour and sickles before death.
---
This happened often with me and lockpicking. I’d crash every time I tried lockpicking anything. So i simpley stopped lockpicking. Im on PC.
---
This blow, going to uninstall again because I definitely want to play this game
---
238963 👍🏻
---
Ooooh that's an awesome idea. +1.
---
I have 4 characters that I play and would love a unified Overseer level. That and no duplicate Perks would make it a lot more fun.
---
Awesome! the map I'm looking forward to has to be Charleston! such a fun and vertical place to explore sometimes, I think there should be more areas that feel that urban and vertical
---
I wish my friends were like this and give it a second chance
---
Yep found it yesterday and put it in my vending machine for 25k
---
What was it meant to say?
---
Thanks. Saw this and tried to log in. Sadly PS4 is having service issues so I can't play.
---
Because it was a dumpster fire. People have short memories, fallout 76's first few months were so laughably bad you wouldn't believe it.
---
This is why Bethesda won't give us custom signs or chalk boards. No good will come of that, only lots of obscenity.
---
We got him to a quarter health with power armour and sickles before dying. We ran out of stimpacks.
---
Watch internet historians video about it.
---
Ok and i assume ill naturally kind of come in contact with that sort of thing
---
Have to look at it this way, PA is liken to a "shield" type buff, and in the single player game it was easy to be OP and it didn't matter. But because none of the weapons are equalized, nothing will work right to help PA without making it OP which it in fact should be.
---
Because it was the most hyped up
---
That was a very generous and very timely thank you.
---
It’s the diseased mirelurk spawns or larva or wtf ever they’re called. Take a rad away kill a mirelurk queen and then let the little ones attack you. Hopefully you don’t have the electrically charged or unstable isotope mutation cause it will kill them but you just let them attack you and about 50% chance you’ll get it.
---
That's what made it fun for me. I am terrible at playing against other people, but the other night a guy surprised me when i was looting some chests early in a round, and i blasted him with my shotgun. He ran and i charged him. He started shooting back, but i actually got him. My first kill in the game after over 500 hours, lol. But that's not all, after that - i don't remember what gun i picked up, but it was great - weak baby tiny little me confronted someone in PA and i took them out with 6 or 7 shots. I felt like a badass for once.   
---
Last night i was actually one of the last three standing in a round.   
---
It feels good to have a little success in this kind of mode. On top of that, even if you don't do that well, you do make a little progress anyway, and that keeps me coming back. It's also a nice quick jump-in-and-go mode that's a change of pace from leisurely exploring the wasteland. I'm actually going to miss it if it takes a break after the preview.
---
keep in mind 2 shot carries an accuracy penalty so even if the damage is higher you might miss more often so it can easily be a wash.  
---
If you are using PA and have the stabilized perk maxed then the TSE might be marginally better but I doubt it would be a huge difference.  If you don't use stabilized the AAE is probably better.  And beyond all of this the AAE will always be better vs high dr foes regardless of stabilized.  
---
Please note the above is a guess, I don't have extensive aae vs tse testing to back that up :)
---
Just found this out. WTH!?
---
It’s been happening for a while now. I get disconnected from server after a few minutes
---
We are slowly going through side quests. We went and joined the Enclave and that was an easy two levels.
---
Maybe about $60 now? I love this game and want to support it. Plus, buy ALL the things. (Like the plushies. Love them.)
---
Nope NW and adventure for me no Survival
---
It would have been re-assuring to call it beta but sneak peak implies it will go and come back which i hope they don’t do. Anthem tried pulling that with their late content and NW appears to be ahead of schedule
---
I mean i have the "normal" windows defender + CCleaner. I dont know about any tools but i remember that there was a way in the past to change your inventory .
---
Ok i found it. That was this thing. [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32)
---
But i completly new installed the game. How can i delete that ?
---
I’m hoping for a radio DJ. I always enjoyed their commentary.
---
I didn't think of this.
---
1) Grenades.  
---
2) Things that launch Grenades.  
---
3) Perk cards that make Grenades better.   
---
4) Ask your teammates for Grenades.
---
This game is huge in the nonagenarian demographic.
---
What about springs?
---
Yes, yes, yes. Please do this.
---
I think this is more than half of the reason why it happens. I know I’ve done it a few times.
---
Well this kinda says it? I do not think having 2 disconnects a day is a huge deal, thats just part of internet  gaming at this point. Especially in the MMO world.
---
As far as the other bugs? I only recall one that was pretty bad, the “stuck in power armor” thing that went on for about a week, and was patched.
---
Again, understand releasing a game into the general populace that relies on the internet and has a HUGE amount of information changing hands between servers and multiple users is bound to have issues.
---
Its happening again right now as player complain about server issues in NW due to the incredible generosity of Bethesda in giving it away for free....
---
Free means overload and issues.....
---
Regardless of how you want to qualify the build, it should NOT be struggling with these middling quality graphics.
---
Turning on vsync (manually through Nvidia control panel) does remove the tearing, but that's just a sad and bizarre omission in a game from 2018. I don't have gsync as I'm using an oddball 1440p panel (a couple years old, but no issues in far more graphically demanding games).
---
This level of tearing, pixelation and oddball frame dips is just maddening in a game that looks and feels like it's fresh out of 2012. I can mod the ever loving crap out of Mass Effect 3 to look FAR better and it still runs rock solid. Not to mention a variety of shockingly GPU intensive strategy games (Endless Legend and Frostpunk are both beautiful and cause the temp to spike far higher than this). Hell, WoW in all it's antiquated engine glory looks better when looking at background crap like trees (at least in recent zones).
---
I have Bodyguards gives 12 damage and 12 energy  resistance per teammate (max 36 ).
---
this.  Also keep in mind there's a lower tier chest mod if you don't have dense, iirc it's called padded that also reduces explosive damage.
---
It was really buggy when it came out and I'm glad their feet are finally being held to the flames for that kind of stuff. I didn't have any serious issues with 76 but I used to play on the ps3 so I know how frustrating it is when you get a good game you can't play because of technical issues. For me, New Vegas was my 76.
---
I haven’t gone back to the game since the bugs caused me to not only lose ammo, but to make my shots ineffective to where I had to use way more ammo than I should. 
---
I really do want to get back into it, but having to grind for ammo again just turns me off it.
---
I forgot about VATS. I need to get chems too, which could help.
---
Love the mental image of pulling a quad rocket launcher out of a 4"x 6" leopard print hand bag.
---
Marry Poppins is *pissed*.
---
Makes me think of Mario Kart 64 (the battle mode). If you're playing 4v4 FFA, and die early, you become a bomb. 
---
You can at least avenge your own death that way, haha.
---
If you can show me people who can consistently wipe out 1/5th of the server by themselves Ill change my tune. But I dont think thats realistically possible. If somebodys getting that many kills back to back on servers then they should be investigated. If that same persons got multiple account reports of cheating then it doesnt take much to put 2 and 2 together
---
Heck, you can just go to any train station and read the posters. That starts the quests.
---
Have they fixed the performance issues? Haven't played since very early this year, and performance on the Xbox One S was awful
---
Soon(TM)
---
I may be wrong but I am used to Lenovo dual NVIDIA/Intel setups, but having them both on enables the user to assign different gpu different tasks. For ease of use, turn off the Intel grfx. But there should be a way in the NVIDIA panel to allocate the NVIDIA gpu to only be used with the game. Sorry I don’t have more info as I don’t have one of those units in front of me right now.   I am pretty sure I had issues managing those systems directly through windows display settings and had to use nvidia settings.
---
Yaaa sadly I don’t think it’s digital though
---
Same here.  It goes into your Documents folder, then my games/fallout 76/photos/(some wonky folder name).
---
Under the weekly challenges this week is a challenge that gives a gun called "salt of the earth" it is in survival mode but very easy to accomplish even at lvl 25.  It is a three star legendary shotgun with double shot, extra dmg when aiming, and I can't remember what the third perk is.  Regardless it would be an epic weapon for your lvl.
---
I wish you the best of luck, hope it'll work out for you or that you'll find a solution for whichever problem might be causing it!
---
Yup with two 150 plus toons - just got my 1st and 2nd about over a week ago, 1st at vendor, then mob at WestT, 3rd a few days ago...
---
Yea that's what I do lol. I refuse to buy any micro transaction with any game I play out of principle and it's not gonna change with this one. I just look out for easy dailies and save up.
---
A single, waterlogged, leather boot. \*nods\*
---
Scraps into 1x Leather, 1x Cloth, 1x Steel.  
---
Chance to catch only in specific locations: Grafton Dam, Thunder Mountain Powerplant, Lake Reynolds ^(\[Ash Heap, S of Lewisburg\]) 
---
*"Why those locations... and... why steel??"*, you say...  
---
Steeled Toe Boots, of course!   
---
Worn by workers in heavy industry... like Grafton Steel Mill, Nuclear Powerplant, and a region dedicated to Mining! :D
---
Believe it or not as soon as I punched in the first five numbers I got disconnected. That hasn't happened to me for almost 3 days. LOL
---
Place my camp where? In adventure?
---
Oh wow. It just dawned on me this game is basically like Fallout: Second Life
---
Dont feel bad. I have 7 copies of lvl 1 action boy. My character already has a lvl 3 action boy equipped.
---
Hope I didn't hurt your feelwings, go eat another pop tart lil Boi...
---
https://status.playstation.com/en-us/
---
Adventure mode is turning into Florida for me.
---
Like I’m retired and can’t keep up with all the young whippersnappers in NW.
---
Same here. I have a useless level 12 Overseer character. Actually started a new one and got him to level 8 because of the useless duplicates. 
---
For real now. One character has 9 duplicate cards, the other has 1. The RNG is just insane on this one and can quickly ruin builds.
---
It's -2 perception, and a small handful of hats random got 1 damage resist recently. I think it was a bug, but not really enough to mean anything at all.
---
I haven’t read that, but if true then he’s met Braun before, or he was created by Braun.
---
Yes, their system is broken, sometimes you get banned for having lots of stuff, sometimes you don't. Sometimes the guilty go unpunished, sometimes the innocent get punished. This is Bethesda.
---
If you are confident that the system is PERFECT, then meet me in game and my friends and I will drop enough stuff for you to pick up to trigger a ban flag (not a single item will be duped, we will even let you watch us craft the ammo), then we can see how confident you are their system works....
---
PS4 issue apparently... This isn't on Bethesda... I guess Apex is also unplayable
---
No in NW, you can't build unless you place it. Its free to do it btw.
---
You attacked the user with passive-aggressiveness. I think it mattered to you.
---
Did you not think there would not be glitches?
---
So wait, what if they actually are doing the things theyre accused of? Because a witch hunt is specifically going after someone for *shit they couldnt have done*
---
If he is using a laptop yes that would be a different story because the integrated graphics are used for power saving measures.
---
But yea ive had the bots happen before as well
---
is it me or is the hit registration in this game mode awful. I unloaded on a guy at point blank range with Gatling gun and nothing happened.
---
So how do I place it?!
---
edit: I have picked up and used quick walls, but cant figure out how to place my own blueprint.
---
I have played since launch, along with several 10’s of thousand others......
---
Need to find a legendary spray bottle to stop that
---
You've experienced glitches.  Period.
---
Record it and report it to Bethesda. Nothing will happen if they don't detect them or no one reports them to be reviewed.
---
Bethesda support. Need their gamertag and evidence (video or extremely detailed explanation)
---
Yup! I love leaving surprises for new players at the Overseer’s Camp.
---
Ok i deleted everything with a inventory in the ini data and it works now. Thank you for answering that fast.
---
I haven’t had a problem with it. If I do I’ll come back to this post and tell you
---
So are you saying that melee weapons remain shit even if you get perk cards for them?
---
Latency issue maybe?
---
Life giver is fantastic. I had strong back but took it off as 25lbs doesn’t make or break a build.
---
I ended up getting First Aid (Stim 45% more effective) That has been a staple ever since.
---
I run the one that gives a Dmg bonus to auto rifles as I usually like to use sub machine guns and I *think* they count as rifles.
---
Other than that it’s pretty deterministic of your play style. I like frog legs but that’s just an extra layer of movement when being attacked.
---
Edit: Oh, and the +100% Dmg to creatures, so I don’t have to fuck with them.
---
Your connection must be crap. I play with 30 mbps on PS4 and i haven’t had those problems since launch
---
I thought you said your PC was High-End?
---
I'm guessing the uninstall didn't remove the mod folder. If you can find it and remove it manually, you might be able to solve it
---
Is it entertaining? Yes. Does it feel hollow and kinda pointless? Also yes.
---
I didn't think it would be exclusively glitches. Only one enemy attacked me back in 2 hours of play and a cow vanished into thin air.
---
Same. No sure WtH are these bugs people complain about.....
---
The only issue that affected me was getting stuck in power armor bug. And that was fixed in about a week.
---
Yh i logged out to have a rollie without worrying about food/drink and now i cant get back in.. Been getting way to stressed with this game the past couple of days. Nearly just deleted and gave up with the game  till i saw this post. So it most be a ps4 issue
---
You’re playing through the glitches and don’t even know it. Tons of things are still bugged.
---
Fallout without glitches is like call of duty without little kids, its gonna happen, the ones you described don't seem that bad and are definitely not game breaking, if you give it a chance the game is actually a good game.
---
Maybe a scorched would be more on brand with fallout 76’s story. Also since feral ghouls are erratic, and scorched are relatively the same as humans.
---
My internet is 200 mbps. I play multiple online games without any issue.
---
Damn, this was my only evening free to try the new game mode. Ah well.
---
Because some men just want to watch the world burn.
---
Same as adventure mode, open the pip boy and the button you should press would be displayed in the bottom.
---
You are so ignorant. The game may be better now but it wasn’t at launch.
---
I did make some in Adventure but I honestly haven’t found and kind of use for the in NW. I bet, if you could get good at remembering to do it, that you could easily pull up the camp and slap down a few walls. Will be interesting to see that strategy evolve.
---
I with you. NW was fun for a bit, but I like to have some time to stalk and ambush my victims without a forest fire chasing me down. 
---
Plus that NW lobby is worse than an elementary school playground.
---
go meet the low levels! bring them a few gifts and nukashine. it's a change of pace but a fun one
---
Then call it middle high or whatever. I don't give a crap.
---
No matter what verbiage you want to use to describe it, this aging game engine shouldn't be able to tax my PC in any meaningful way.
---
I have never had such problems. Do you have good internet connection
---
They simply misnamed the challenge. It was supposed to read "NW: Enjoy playing something on your phone for twenty minutes."
---
I'd offer you a cold Nukashine, but I'm on PS4.
---
Have fun.
---
Well, it doesn't really matter anyway, as mods have closed this post due to, I suppose, naming and shaming... I think we can both agree that cheaters should be dealt with swiftly and with extreme prejudice.
---
Not game breaking?? The enemies were T-posed and didn't attack me.
---
Maybe I'll fire it up again today and see, but I certainly wouldn't buy it from what I've experienced so far.
---
Same thing here, its a PSN issue I think
---
Lmao I 100% relate ^^
---
Yeah, I'd just like to know if there will be a roadmap.  Full stop.  There are a number of things floating around out there, which you describe, but we have no semi-concrete idea of when those are going to show up.
---
Sure but that happens in the real world as well
---
New from RobCo! The Stealthpack^TM . A bag that you can't see can't hamper your style and works for all occasions! But being invisible doesn't make it any lighter! *Or does it?*
---
^^^RobCo ^^^Sealthpack^TM ^^^is ^^^actually ^^^heavier ^^^than ^^^other ^^^comparable ^^^models.
---
So I've noticed this too. And its bwen since the patch before NW. I felt like it was my internet but other games run great. So i think the servers are having an issue or something with the sudden influx in players? I dunno but I have bad lag only in Fo76 as well. I play daily. Sometimes quitting and reloading in solves it.
---
Nice! That is a great trick.
---
They do exist, there are two I know of for a fact in the cranberry bog, although one of them is nearly useless and it resides inside the typical nuke zone of queen fights near the exit to glassed cavern. The other is not too far from the cranberry glades where there's a fissure site near by, north of the flooded train yard.
---
a person who cant be bothered having a windows 10 key
---
I got Team Medic. 6pt. Shares stimpack heals with nearby team mates.
---
It's spelled "Googol" if you're referring to the number!
---
The fickleness of this subreddit is amazing considering someone actually down voted you for posting the day of true summer and its solstice.
---
My guess is based on how a lot of "summer" sales and activities tend to begin very shortly after Memorial Day. I personally go by the weather; and it's been about a month and a half into "summer" here in the southeast US.
---
Ohhh! Okay very nice. Thank you. I was referring to the camp as the actual building, and trying to hold the touchpad down to open the menu. I forgot the camp was an actual piece of equipment.
---
So its such a circlejerk, and comparable to T_d... and yet here you are posting up and down this thread, with a post history full of 76.
---
Weird, its almost as if youre engaged in recreational outrage!
---
If you're on PS4, PlayStation is having some issues with logging in and such.
---
Hopefully they get this fixed. I'm running into the same issue and just wanted to try it it before deciding to buy or not.
---
200mbps and I play other online games without issue. Dota 2, Apex, Warhammer Vermintide 2, usually with Discord running in the background.
---
Yep, so was I. I wanted to get the free power armor skin from the store and have not been able to log in yet.
---
Contacted Sony support and the tech gave me that link and said some games will not work until it is fixed. He also said there is no ETA on the fix. Yaaaay Sony.
---
The website flat out says fallout 76 doesn't support mods. This is a somewhat recent change to the wording I believe.
---
Ah it's not just me then
---
You might be lagging.

Those dogs sometimes glitch, the robots are part of an event and are passive when the event isn't active.
---
The Brahmin...will I don't have anything on that.
---
You might not be encountering so many enemies because of the influx of new players, low level areas are kind of crowded at the moment. This isn't always the case.
---
On a sidenote, what can we do to get Skyrim Granny into FO76? That's the redemption arc this game deserves.
---
From what I've seen, the max Overseer Rank right now is 197.
---
If it was a crime, wheres the Lawsuit?
---
Also make it visable for out fits with backpacks, I want to wear my fireman outfit and have my backpack displayed.
---
What was it's level? A rule of thumb I lived by before I had to worry about it was '15 level discrepancy' - if the enemy was within 15 levels I would engage thanks to being a tough, but hardly impossible fight. Anything above 15 levels, I avoided at all costs due to the stims and ammo I learned it would eat up.
---
Get some friends on your friend list.  That's how I did it.  When someone would launch a nuke, especially if they seemed to do several in one session, I'd try to make friends.  Otherwise right now, it's like you say, very much a crap shoot whether or not you'll have enough high-levels to deal with either the SBQ or Encryptid.
---
Here is my source....
---
So your point is that people will exploit this by spending the whole game getting in and out of power armor?
---
Anything that fixes chainsaws
---
Glad I could help.
---
Don't think so. Might have to investigate later.
---
Agreed, it should run better. It runs pretty good on my i7-3770k, with a 980 Ti at 1080p and looks fine. I don't have Vsync enabled on any of the pcs.   
---
Also runs really good on a AMD system with a 1080 TI at 1440p. I'm wondering if there's something odd with your system or vsync causing you some issues.   
---
What is your CPU?
---
ah, no worries. Will do thanks!
---
But you can only attack with unarmed strikes (w/ extra ghoul damage)
---
I'm at 490 hours myself, got the game on launch day. I've experienced...most of the bugs. I never had disappearing gear or a game reinstall, but most of the in-game issues occurred at one point or another. Crashes and disconnects for sure, sometimes even 5 times in one day. Falling through the ground, legendary enemies not dropping anything (last time happened last week with a sheepsquatch), invincible enemies, damage bug (last time happened on monday), things not loading in properly, getting stuck in all sorts of places, enemies getting stuck in all sorts of places, getting stuck inside a broken power armor frame (twice), getting hit by things that didn't load in, not receiving loot from various quests/events, items getting duplicated, quests getting reset, vending machine getting reset, scorchbeast queen flying off to infinity and beyond, people's gunfire or random humming noises looping forever, an assaultron head lost its legendary prefix, I found a few bugged items, some quests repeated too often and others never triggered at all, plenty of challenges never registered, I could go on and on...but despite all the bugs, I still find the game fun
---
Calm down there Micheal Jackson.
---
The only real time I get bad lag is when I first log into the game and everything is loading in around me and after a scorch queen event. It could be caused by the nuclear winter battle royal event going on right now and all the new free players putting a strain on things.
---
I feel the same exact way. I didn’t want to try it because I didn’t want to get disappointed. I’m a huge fallout fan and finally playing it this week i feel like I finally have something I’ve been missing hahahh
---
Maybe but I really don't think so. There were about 5-10 other players on the map. I didn't experience any rubberbanding and one ghoul did attack me but I blocked the hit with my hatchet.
---
Didn't experience any other signs of lag, and the other players seemed to move and respond pretty naturally.
---
I have 200 mbps internet and never experience lag in other games so idk why I would be lagging.
---
Are you registered through UPS? It’s not a normal email from Bethesda or anything.
---
I couldnt get into the game and then my friends list and trophy list wasnt accessible too but now they both are working but still cant get back on to fallout =(
---
How would the average player know how to tell if an item is duped?  
---
When the "average player" sees a legendary item in someones vending machine, how would they know if it is duped?  
---
There is no way, and that is one of the many problems here....
---
I have an The original Xboxone and have no issues
---
If you keep the storm to your back (like literally, a few feet away), you don’t have to worry about anyone sneaking up on you. So I hide from bush to bush that way until I get down to the last 4. Then I usually die, because I suck at PvP lol.
---
It's down currently, at least on PS4.

Oh called me whinny about the game I shelled out 60 for because I don't expect trash. Your edgy. Lol Where's them duffle bags?
---
So maybe the game does require a fast internet connection, that's very disappointing.
---
There's no point in changing worlds for me, as soon as I start walking the lag happens, all the time every sever
---
Don't tell me, tell the mods
---
Most of been a problem since last night. Cuz last night i kept getting booted and losing so much shit today was fine till i signed off to have a rollie and then my ps4 bricked but now everythings working again besides  fallout
---
i guess ill look for one tonight!
---
I definitely feel your pain.  I started on my 3 per heavy gunner and loaded down with rifle cards.  My rifle character has mostly str cards.  I don’t think anyone’s goal is having you remake your adventure character based upon your NW’s card drops.
---
The downvotes on your comment made me realize that this is a Bethesda fan-boys ONLY sub.
---
nice one.

Wha?
---
Not a bug, but a teaser of vault 76 being all synths

---
Honestly, it's not the radiation that would keep me out of the water in Fallout, it'd be those things! Even if they didn't attack, but could be seen in the water??? FFFFffff that! lol
---
I'm having a lot of issues in Adventure mode, I can't really play much anymore until it's fixed. Big latency issues, invisible enemies, etc. NW is running great though.
---
Been thinking of jumping back in, can anyone recommend if I should start a new character or can I just jump back in and be good?
---
i7-9700k... so that's definitely not the issue. Not OC'd at the moment, mostly due to extreme laziness. I would have paired it with a better GPU but I had to upgrade said out of cycle due to my previous one biting the dust 3 years and about 3 weeks in (so 3 weeks post warranty). I honestly haven't done anything but run crap at stock since I'm old and got most of the PC tinkering "out of my system" a long time ago, back when OC'ing was just a matter a changing the bus speed on the mobo from 66mhz to 75mhz (or 83mhz if you got lucky). Both GPU and CPU are watercooled, though only close loop, so I'm sure I can push them as time permits.
---
All that said, it still a very badly optimized game. Even when it works perfectly with no tearing it still oddly ugly in many places.
---
Mission Impossible
---
wowza... but the rewards do stop at 100?
---
Painfully blatant. Zero fucks given to mask his aimbot.

Make sure you submit that video to Bethesda!
---
Lol, yep. Just noticed my trophy list is not accessible. Thankfully I can still see my friends list.
---
Oh well, playing Fortnite for now.
---
Thanks for the response. 
---
May I humbly suggest a system where you get 3 random cards, and pick one of the three.  Sort of like a draft in a certain popular card game.
---
Comment out the \[Archive\] section in your FalloutCustom.ini file by putting a semicolon at the beginning of each line in that section. Or just rename the whole file if you don't have any other tweaks in there like turning off grass
---
One of my character builds is a combat medic that sides with the Enclave because of the threat of the Scorched. I always headcanon that this is like the first presence of the Enclave on the East Coast before Navarro fell and Autumn Sr. came over.
---
Obviously not. Again that you don’t see the problem reveals a lot. If you cared about the game and understand the technical quality of each patch it would upset you. *Some* of the problems in nuclear winter are acceptable and perfectly minor problems but more was added and broken with this last update that has nothing to do with the game mode. If these patches are pushed out too fast or whatever may be problem then something must be done. If you disagree you simply don’t care if this game is in a good place. Core features are constantly broken with new updates. Bugs being introduced and reintroduced at the scale we are currently at is just embarrassing.
---
Ensuring matchmakers have a stable connection to the game is my best guess. That way if a team is set to load out, but can't 'lock-in' they get removed and a new matchmaker is set in place.
---
Best guess here anyway 🤷‍♂️
---
Well considering how op legendary gear is I think a buff to PA would be quite appropriate.
---
Ah ok thanks!
---
r/fallout was always a toxic place even before the announcement of fallout 76. I predict they will hype themselves for fallout 5 then when it will come out it will be "the worst fallout game ever, not buying from Bethesda again" and all of this until the next spin off or fallout 6.
---
that's some serious ugly.  no way i'd claim these.
---
Are you running it off an SSD on an Xbox one X?
---
I'm in Ohio and "summer" shows it's head once or twice a week and then spring kicks the door back open
---
Anyway, If I were a betting man I'd say we'll see something next week, the week after at the latest.
---
I haven’t been able to start the game at all after latest patch on pc 
---
I hit play then it says running then does nothing then the button says play again
---
My guess is to give people time to open perks and figure out what they want to go before the match starts. Granted it doesn't take the average person that long to do so, but a bunch of new players are trying it out as well
---
Free week.
---
Thanks for the input, I thought as much.
---
Great job capturing it. Shit like that just ruins all the fun of the game.
---
It's just your imagination. 
---
^or maybe the free trial week until this Monday.
---
The bugs. I was bugged and could not launch nukes(why i ended up quitting).  So what many consider the penultimate experience of the game - I simply could not do.  Imagine my frustration even if that was the ONLY bug I experienced. which it was not.
---
Newb question, but how can I tell what graphics card my game is using. I have nvidia 970, but something did seem to change a little while back and the graphics seem worse now.
---
What does Michael Jackson have anything to do with me being “mad?”
---
I suggested something like this and got downvoted.
---
I had another idea though. What if new players don't come from Vault 76 anymore and we're the veterans that made Appalachia safe?
---
Quite fond of that marsupial pouch of yours, are you?
---
Just the standard xbox one hard drive
---
The way you were making fun of it like it was a typo made me wonder what it was supposed to say
---
I think it's still free to try for a few more days, so you can see for yourself.
---
Yeah, but the good thing is it discourages players that hop and pop for xp.
---
Just gotta take Rad-X to suppress the mutations
---
Watoga?
---
Yeah, it was lonely last night. My store is set up in the middle of the savage divide and I didn't have a single customer. There wasn't a soul east of Morgantown. I'd never seen an unlooted Watgoa before. No events going outside the forest. There were only 2 other players that were over level 50 and they were both running with the newbs in Flatwoods. I felt like a 21 year old at a high school prom. Too many kids. But the positive note, there were 3 of us at the Nukashine and we all hopped on an instrument and jammed out. Hadn't seen that in months. I hope players come back or it's going to be a while before these kids get strong enough that we can start doing SBQ, Encryptid, and Paradise again.
---
Good point. Noted !
---
What else can you do in adventure mode? You essentially cant kill anyone unless they’re totally green about the mechanics and invite you to do it.
---
Considering a few people have started receiving tracking codes this week your duffel bag should be on its way, no joke. Shhh its ok baby.
---
This is definitely a game mode that should exist
---
Good luck with splitting the playerbase.
---
Yeah I agree, I didn't think I was going to like it but it's a blast
---
Bethesda if you're reading do you have any news to share us on if you're planning on boosting the energy weapons, since they're still underpowered compared to the other guns, some explosive weapons like the rocket launcher also suffer from this, or if you'll change how the armor ratings work at all to make sure all weapons are usefull?
---
Yea, I have killed so many queens that I have lost count. It will be an epic feeling when the NPCs show up.
---
But you also have to be parched
---
I usually check in my task manager! Check the performance tab, should show you which card is being used.
---
Damn. That sucks. I lag like crazy but its not unplayable for me i end up getting disconnected though a lot.
---
You keep popping up to say this. You clearly have some sort of grudge or something and have turned me, someone just learning about this sub, to believe the opposite of your point.
---
About 40$. Camp stuff and PA skins
---
I like the fact that the world is slowly changing with us. New buildings are opening up, new creatures are coming into the wastes, new dungeons are being uncovered, I can't wait to see how the lore around the queen expands.
---
It won't happen, and if it does, the backlash will be so major, Bethesda will be considered worse than EA. Remember that FO76 was sold as a feature complete survival game, if they removed the survival game aspect completely in favor of the BR mode, well I'm sure you can see how getting rid of the thing a lot of people bought the game for would be a dumb decision.
---
New player here from this free week, how has the changed from when it launched ? I still feel the horrendous hitboxes (cmon Bethesda) but other than that i am loving the game. Have they changed much and is there indication of more content in the future ? Actually want to buy it, didn't think i would.
---
Dude all of these glitches are happening to me as well and all of my friends. We play on ps4. Just because you dont have any issues doesnt mean other people dont either stop trying to argue pointless things

Cool. Thank you. :)

Yeah... I miss school and summer breaks. Gods I feel old. Enjoy summer. Here in old people world I will be working.

Unfortunately, there are many ignorant fan-boys around here who are incapable of rational thought and believe Bethesda is incapable of making mistakes (in spite of there being public apologies by them for making mistakes).

Don't worry about these people, when they get falsely banned, they will then experience irony (even if they are incapable of understanding it)

If you download tale of two wastelands for fallout new vegas, you can technically have that dev joke fire gecko fight liberty prime. Although liberty prime is invincible, soo
---
congrats
---
&gt;i7-9700k
---
Oh yea that should be fine. You certainly have some strange issues. Have you tried to do a 3dmark and see how your config compares to others with similar builds?
---
Do you have a Nvidia profile for Fallout 76? or have the general settings set to performance instead of Quality? Performance setting will make the textures look really poor, especially on the lower settings in game.
---
The only time I have any performance drops in the White springs with multiple heavily decorated camps in the area.  
---
OH here's a thought... are you playing Full screen? Or Borderless full screen? The game runs poor in Borderless/Windowed mode. Most games suffer a huge performance hit in windowed mode and this one is no exception.
---
Wow.. day three and already there is a valid issue that can make the game un-fun..
---
Bethesda, you started out with a level playing field and it looked like skill was going to dominate (which is fair). But all the issues with the cards.. Players will not be happy if anyone ever has an unfair advantage. Legendary and Mutations were that what hurt Adventure mode, then you made it kinda better by letting us community dwellers have peace by giving the PVP'ers a new place to kill in (Survival).
---
When any game starts everyone is the same and all have fun. As time passes even if the rewards are specific and at certain levels, the higher level guys will have distinct advantages. At least in this viewpoint, the general populous will see this a fair platform. (I'm level 210)
---
Hearing that you have one or more power perk cards like Frog legs.... Oh, My really??.. how can that ever be fair to those that don't have it. There are even comments about how this makes you even change the way you play due to it's benefit! maybe things like these need to be handed out in RNG format as handicaps. "OK, the game has detected that you suck at this... here is a little edge to help you out.. Warning this card can be automatically removed by the system once you appear to have proved yourself."
---
Thus if you have the skill, you have bragging rights to say I did it without perks. AKA "God mode" as you sir, ARE a !!!Video Game God!!!.
---
Old dude, you needed Frog legs to keep up... (I'm 52) so yup.. needed..
---
Comments?
---
Personally my "mobile" base is a single foundation doughnut camp with crafting benches and a bed. Everything else was built off that if I wanted more.
---
I never claimed it to be *perfect*, but it is efficient enough to have solved the rampant duping. 
---
Surely you know what happened during that week when Bethesda accidentally unbanned those that got their accounts suspended in the big duping days.
---
By the way, if you have some secret to craft ammo, share it, because I'm struggling with that haha.
---
Nope sadly only one for the ultracite rest are for all the other pa
---
Might be too young to get that reference sorry. Its sucks getting old
---
The scorchbeast already reveals where everybody is. Those explosions and screeches make it very clear. I don't get why people don't instantly kill them before they give your position away, it takes like 5 shots from a rifle or smg to down a scorchbeast and like 2-3 from a gatling gun
---
Too  bad new players will never know what that mask means and how people obtained it. I am still hoping Bethesda will delete people's duped items one day.
---
Or walking out in the woods or large expanse of area. Get into any town and go to 1st person, can’t play can man simulator without first person on.
---
No xp or advancement as a monster would still provide the drive to stay alive I would think.
---
If you're level 68 and you've played since beta...you pretty much don't play the game.  You have what...ten  hours of actual play time in this game, maybe twenty? This is a joke post, right?
---
Listed them all.
---
I can buy them at a vendor for 9300. Unless you wanna go down to that
---
Someonw just posted the network is having issues
---
This is actually a great idea. Maybe a Scorched would be more appropriate. Either way, though, this would be a great way to make the game more challenging as time goes on, and to keep players eliminated early from getting bored. It could also offer a way for less skilled players to still practice and improve, which is something I find lacking in most BR.
---
This, but only if the match ends in a ridiculously short time as a deterrent to hackers.
---
Yeah. Same here. My melee toon had nothing but ranged cards and a bunch of dupes. This made him useless.
---
My ranged guy only has 1 dupe so far and outstanding other perks. Terrible RNG.
---
I wasn't making fun of his "typo" (50 yod for 50 years old), I was calling him a newbie for being so young.
---
You must not have been around for the camera challenges before the camera was in game, the alien challenges before Flatwoods monster was categorized as an alien, the radstorm challenges, etc. We will 100% not be given anything extra for this
---
I'm not new (since day one), but I've been waiting for my friends to decide to start up the game again before we start going east on the map, but I didn't know Watoga was vertical! thanks for the help!
---
Think everyone is getting it. Best guess servers are down for maintanince. Been seeing people bug out emoting..so maybe they brought it down for a fix.
---
ya mean like COD?
---
Yay! Love you too Bethesda! :D
---
Yup, fullscreen exclusive/borderless.
---
I only have major drops in similar situations... it's not a framerate issue MOST of the time honestly. Just poor quality graphics. Though I'll check the Nvidia profile for giggles to see if it's set to "looks like a homebrew game from 2007" ;)
---
Alright
---
I DEMAND to know how many people in nuclear winter have been killed by a hatchet
---
That would be Scorched, then.
---
Glad that it only took a capital class law suit looking over them to get it. Lmao idk what u think your gonna get out of arguing with me, but its just gonna be alot of you getting triggered cap.
---
Servers are down I think
---
Any not worthy weapon (ie what is really good and what is kinda bad)?
---
Yeah, very low traffic on the west side, so after an AWOL Armements and Surface to Air, I headed to Flatwoods to find the Tower for the Backpacking badge. Ran into a lvl 8 who was scrounging wood. I went to his camp, made him armor and weapon workbenches and crafted some lvl 10 armor for him. Also set up a small water purifier. 
---
Still need to find Kawahuna East tower and South Mountain tower.
---
Lol, yeah. 
---
There's still a fair number of annoying super-fans on here who will argue that any bug or flaw in the game was intended because the developers are obviously creative gods and not the sort of overworked programmers and designers who would easily miss something in the hellish rush to bring a game to launch. 
---
They kinda make it impossible to discuss any design elements of the game in a critical manner. 
---
*shrug*
---
It was unpleasant launch. Far from unplayable and it had above average server stability for an online game. But people were overly negative about the game since announcement, including spreading false information about the game. So at launch the general public was innoculated with negativity about the game and any issue was weaponised to bring the game down. So a game that should have been considered as mediocre at worst was completely trashed by overblowing every negative aspect of the game and by ignoring the positives. Just compare the general narrative:
---
For Fallout 76: "I've tried the game for 30 minutes and didn't enjoy it. It must be shit". 
---
For any other game: "I've tried the game for 30 minutes and didn't enjoy it. It's simply not for me".
---
For Fallout 76: "You were done after 30 minutes? Lol, you surely seen everything in the game anyway".
---
For any other game: "You were done after 30 minutes? You should play the game for 10 hours, then it will click with you".
---
Sorry, sometimes I lack common sense
---
Please report to Bethesda via their tools so a ban can happen and they are aware of what they need to fix.
---
Sort of but on a bigger scale, and with Fallout quirks
---
Ooooh yes! Give multiple cards and we pick 1.
---
All great points. Do you primarly play with a group or solo? I find I survive much longer when playing solo, using unnamed spawn points and hanging way back as you said. Playing with a group tends to be more action-packed but I find I die so much faster. My perk cards haven't been great so I tend to alternate between groups for fun and solo for XP. 
---
Also, do you primarly use third person perspective for shooting? I was watching a popular streamer on Twitch last night and couldn't get over how accurate he was with almost every weapon in 3PP. NW made me brutally aware of how crippling my reliance on 1PP is and think I need to go practice or something.
---
Agree totally. Now a capture the flag mode would kick ass. Like say team fortress except each team can totally build their own bases to protect the flags.
---
Oh I was... the week the camera came out we had the camera challenges for 4 or 5 days before we got it..
---
I'm actually liking the battle royale more than Adventure Mode.
---
Gives you time to open perk packs and pick which ones you want to play with.
---
"No campy shit in it"
---
*Places C.A.M.P.*
---
This would be fun.
---
Before I nuked WS I got kicked pretty soon after loading in. I'm also having to get used to putting good with salt back on when i'm in PA. It does seem that if I server hop my hunger, thirst, and food spoilage has gone through the roof.
---
I think I remember them mentioning something in the patch notes about NW (and possibly Adv. And Survival modes) periodically going down during this pre beta phase
---
Donkeypunched ya huh&gt;?
---
You have but one recourse....
---
Nuke your base.
---
Possible, but I played from 8 pm to like 1 am yesterday without issues. 
---
Stupid sexy Flanders. I mean stupid sexy Nuclear Winter.
---
Whoever gets the kill should be the one first one to look, after that it’s free game imo. Otherwise it’s first come first serve to everything else.
---
That can happen if your PS plus account runs outta time. That might be it
---
Aight, thanks
---
Playing online games with WiFi can cause lag. Best to play wired for online games. This happens with gta alot if wifi but no issues with wired. I'd expect the same from an unoptimized game like fallout. (Mind you, I love fallout. But gotta state the obvious)
---
I also use a portable drive. Loads faster. And I have the one x.
---
20$ so far. 
---
10$ when I first started playing just so I could have a boost in atom points. And 10$ for the E3 bundle cause it’s a hell of a good deal.

To slow players down from consuming the content too fast.   
---
It takes players longer overall to get bored of a particular content if they have small chunks of micro-boredom along the way. Player spend a bit less overall time actively playing that content, but because it's interspersed with so many tiny periods of micro-boredom, they spend far more in-game hours.   
---
Kinda like how an American Football match lasts over 3 hours, despite there being only 10-15 minutes of people actually playing football.
---
Ive had it since beginning of may and probably spent $50 so far. Mostly to buy camp skins. I get plenty of enjoyment from the game and its worth the money.  Cheaper than cable TV and more entertaining.
---
Yes yes a million times yes. The helmet and coat go so well with everything! And add bennys suit too
---
The respec system is actually coming out with Nuclear Winter. Not the BR mode, but the whole "Season". We should get it well before Wastelanders.
---
As it was explained last, once you hit level 50 you can choose to Prestige. You go back to level 1, with benefit of some extra special abilities that were not elaborated on.
---
And that's about all we know!
---
There was a game my friends used to play called Contagion where you would turn into a zombie if you died in either co-op or VS.

Uhh no. Anthem is way better than this lile of dog shot Bethesda squeezed out. 76 is dead.
---
oh man, I forgot about the ticks!  
---
Must have been the excitement of the 4 back to back SBs and the scorched that went with them.
---
Ah, your point is it indicates a systemic fault you're convinced exists. However you're expressing that belief by pointing to a bug you don't believe matters.
---
While you may very well be right, can you see why this would confuse anyone reading your comment?
---
You guys are assuming that these players are here with us on reddit...that they actually know what they are doing and or care...I think that is a stretch to all 3.....
---
how does armor even work. Is it just an extra health bar
---
I'm too lazy for that. I just raid the work out rooms at the motel and fire department.
---
Then why take it?  More than likely the guy is coming back for it. The considerate thing to do if you were actually sorry, provided he isn't initiating revenge, would be to stand on the bag so random can't grab it until dude respawns.
---
I think so, rads are treated separately though

Can we be friends Mr. Nukashine man? I need a brewery for the Kanawha merchants, and you'd have at least two players a day nearby. We all have artillary so, safe haven for all players really. Pacifist nerfs any damage to players so mobs are not a problem to lower level players, so we'll see lvls 6-200 coming through to buy from some of the largest collections of items you'll see at camps. Talking 90-120 items at competitive prices to Tops of the world and Whitecaps, and with a current group of 8 CAMPs, you're generally guaranteed to fine a few things that you'll want. From weapons, to aid, to junk, and of course ammo, we got everything but a brewer, so please consider the invitation. And of course if anyone's reading this and plays on ps4; we always have room to grow, and need cooks, chemists, gunsmiths, armorsmiths, smelters, farmers(the planting and harvest kind), and (most important for the resettlement of Appalachia as a whole imho) caravaners to bridge these distances between our communities and begin again the routes of trade and aid in this oasis Bethesda has us in.
---
You'll find them in pretty much any high level area. My personal experience is avoid places with scorched though, they very rarely spawn as legendary and most of the time are 0 stars (meaning they will only drop a 1* item)
---
The Wasteland is an unforgiving place. Dust yourself off and try again
---
I'm still slowly respeccing my cannibal nurse (I made some horrible early decisions) post-50, and I have a level 20-ish character that still works just fine.
---
IMO if you like your early character, stick with it -- worst case scenario, post-50 you can move attributes around if you haven't horribly cocked it up. And even if you have (like me, lol) then you can still recover, albeit a bit slowly, via respeccing a point at a time.
---
Do jump back in. I had a lot of fun, but also a lot of reservations near launch. Loving what I'm seeing now. :)
---
Nope, I'm getting the same error and my psn was renewed on Sunday. The ps servers have been wonky all week.
---
Yep! :(
---
Did all the enemies tpose or just the one, it's a matter of oerspective. It's easy to hop on the hate train and go with the flow, but stay awhile and just hang out and the game will show itself to you!
---
Yep, think it’s an issue with psn 👎🏼
---
Melee is in a really bad place right now. Unless you happen to find Twisted Muscles, and a bobble head , PLUS a power fist, you’re better off with a gun.
---
Radium rifles are the absolute bomb. They shreds health, use .45 which is pretty common, and keep them under pressure with the rads suffocating HP. Unless they have a large stock of Radaway they won’t make it.
---
Double barrel shotgun can be awesome, but you’ve gotta get super close. Have a stealth boy or chameleon mutation to play really well with the shotguns.
---
Crossbow is pretty awesome too with the 3 bolt “magazine” it chunks health if you can hit them fast enough. Usually 2 bolts kills.
---
I haven’t played much with any laser weapons but they just don’t really seem to perform. That’s of course the same as the adventure mode though.
---
Would be cool if there was just not levels that effected the game this heavy.
---
Serious question: What lies?
---
The most notable thing about "common" sense is its rarity.  It's cool, don't worry, have a nice night.
---
Yeah it’s been booting me from my psn often. It sucks but I’m glad others are going through it.
---
Gotta check areas to see if higher levels have spawned in higher level enemies. My only other advice is don’t rush. The main quest doesn’t take terribly long so trying to rush only disappoints you.
---
You can already kill someone in half a second without it. Useless.
---
Yes, the last reward is the Hellfire skin.
---
Supposed to be 9 or 9.5. got pushed back then with no details of when other that, at that time, a couple weeks.... Obviously we're past that, so....
---
I think that something like this would be better:
---
Make the Vault 51 lobby / staging area not part of the countdown. This allows those who want to explore it leisurely to do so. (Or let us explore it in Adventure mode, with the Vault reflecting our character's Overseer XP level.) It also allows time for Perk Cards, etc.
---
At this point is where you can team up with your friends. I can't tell you how many times I've had to go back to the main menu, and then go through all the loading again, because of issues with the Social system and my current team, or just wanting to add a friend who just came online.
---
Then, when you're ready, you opt-in to actually start via a similar method to Hunter/Hunted. Since you're already ready, the countdown is now very short as soon as the minimum player count is reached.
---
Lastly, after you finish a match, you automatically go back to Vault 51.
---
You probably ran into an area a high-level character spawned into (and thus affected the spawns of). Yep, it blows lol.
---
Yeah, yesterday's NW challenge was broken too. The one on Monday worked fine though. I won two matches and stayed until the server shut down today, neither counted towards the daily
---
I do repeat runs of WS, then scrip what I don't want/need.
---
Then its off to Berkeley...
---
When listening to "reviews", it's better to see if the article/video tries to be objective by pointing out positives with negatives. Many reviewers don't try to stay objective and rely on the fact that "everyone knows that the game is bad". Also video reviews essays about the game tend to force a narrative by the gameplay showed. For Fallout 76 it was popular to show only a montage of bugs and crashes to misrepresent the game... Sadly, many people live out of views and rabid fans buying merchandise, so most of sources are unreliable. The big ones like Angry Joe or Jim Stirling tend to sail where the popularity points... Look up smaller channels with a history in the genre/franchise. Typically let's players are more reliable because they focus on enjoying and showing gameplay first and pandering to outrage second (if at all).
---
Damn me too
---
Good idea but I'd rather reincarnate as a super annoying scorchbeast! :P
---
LOL, god mode serum. This dude has been in so many posts lately, how is he only lvl 15?
---
I have over 500 hours play time and am only just level 157. Some of us like to take our time and explore every nook and cranny. 
---
I find it hard to believe you haven't experienced a single bug, OP, but yeah on the whole I agree with your experience - as I say I'm over 500 hours in and I very rarely see any glitches, certainly not ones that bother me. 
---
I'm not saying they don't exist, I know that they do, but there are definitely a large portion of players, like us, for whom it is a perfectly normal gaming experience.
---
No, it provides you resistances that lower the damage you take. Your HP doesn't change. Your armor does have a condition bar though, and will be unequipped once it breaks
---
Oh, well, Black mirror or the last episode of good omens?
---
Sweet, thank you for the heads up, I had no idea.  This may make NW a bit more interesting....
---
Well it can be any number of floors I just ment that you dont want any ramps or staircases going below the main foundation. It makes the blueprint harder to place down if you do that
---
Only one of the dogs was in a stiff pose. The other one ran around in circles barking. I let it come up to me to see if it was hostile, but it didn't attack...same with the first ghoul I encountered. So out of the 4 "hostile" npcs I encountered, only 1 fought back.
---
I'll try playing a bit more, but the fact that the first two hours was nothing but bugs and quest chasing was a bit dull.
---
I get that you have to get into the swing of it, but things just felt so empty. Not a great way to hook people in imo.
---
Nah. Exploring on foot and running like hell hoping you have the AP to escape a scorchbeast you stumbled into is part of the fun. If I could just zip away on a bike anytime I run into a scorchbeast or wendigo it would suck the fun.
---
I logged on and got murdered by a level 60 in no less than 20 minutes. Im level 25 and was looking at my pip boy
---
We have working generators, why not working motorcycles?
---
Hmmm a weapon does more damage to a certain type more then others. What a surprise. Enough joking around though, your level believe it or not means jack shit if you run around with a level 1 pistol or the likes. Some creatures have more armor, some don’t. You can’t compare a gun that one shots a super mutant and expect it to one shot every non boss. Power armor was level locked because x-01 level 2s wasn’t what they wanted. 
---
Edit. Te level 33 was a leader mob, so it would be higher level.  You can explore rebased less of levels you just need to play smart.
---
Also am having same issue I have 3 items showing at that range of quantity but the hundreds amounts differ between them slightly.
---
Lead is @ 4,294,967,284 actual is 85
---
Nuclear Material is @ 4,294,967,295 I actually don't even have any of this on on me currently
---
Plastic is @ 4,294,967,288 actually have 40
---
Yesterday I got yelled at for doing the main quest cuz I'm a low level
---
aww, first Fallout game I take it?   \*tousles hair\*
---
YESSSSSS. Or just give me a 'Join new match' button when I die.
---
This is from yesterday, from another piece of footage I saw, he's at least level 26 now.
---
This isn't an argument, at least not from my end. I can call you out for your comments just as much as you can vent your displeasure. I don't know if you've tried the game recently but its much better, the recent turnaround of positive opinions isn't unwarranted. I say give it another go around if you haven't already, you'll find an awesome community and a pretty damn fun game that's been patched and updated like crazy in the past months.
---
Yes. Seems to be a worldwide problem.
---
That'd be nice...
---
But I want a Pick-R-Up to roam the W.Va hills with a portable stash and minigun mount in the bed.
---
Bonus would be putting Deathclaw horns on the hood.
---
If we are going to dream dream big!
---
Wow ok so from the looks of things it really must be the internet connection, that really sucks. Hopefully when I move out I will have a better one :(
---
That’s lame! Thanks for the response.
---
Owning both an Xbox and a PS4, I find it odd how Sony's network stability pales in comparison to Microsoft or even Nintendo.
---
Sony is the most issue prone of the big 3, even though they are the industry leader in terms of hardware sales.
---
And camera challenges were showing up before the camera was even released. It seems so weird that things like that slip through the cracks multiple times
---
Wasn't he a higher level in yesterday's post? Did he already get banned and make a new account? lmao
---
Yes!
---
Ghouls don’t work like that; they don’t infect people.
---
Glad I made this post. It’s giving me different error codes each time I try and sign in.
---
Nah this is from last night bro.
---
I think Halo did that first, but I imagine it wasn't an original idea for them either.
---
I used multiple kinds of weapons. I upgrade my main as much as I can
---
That’s a 4 hour video. What’s the time stamp or maybe you have an edited down version?
---
It was late and everyone was offline unfortunately. I didn't mind though, I didn't have to worry about taking someones legendary or waiting to make sure that everyone gets a hit in. Sometimes a little alone time isn't a bad thing lol
---
Find a hardware store and loot every paint can there (except empty ones). Lots of lead in that paint. Sweet, sweet lead paint. Also goes great in wine. Sweet, sweet lead champagne.
---
I’m getting the same problem, it won’t let my play at all.
---
Wastelander DLC. Yes. Please.
---
NotBannedYet
---
Might want to check out his post e3 interview. I literally quoted him.
---
Then it wouldn't be battle royale also you wouldn't be dead
---
I made a post a bit down. Seems to be happening to a lot of people.
---
if it's cut short, just go into a new queue. If anything, there could be a  Ghoul vs Vault Dweller mode where one person starts as a ghoul and infects others. the infection turns the vault dweller into ghouls and goes on until the timer runs out or all dwellers are turned into ghouls.
---
Ah, figures. I'd be surprised if they acted that fast
---
Yes. Would love a squad of 4 vs 30+ player controlled scorched scenario. 
---
Or a super mutant vs a squad of 4 (like Evolve but better).
---
U on ps4?
---
I have more gears than i know what to do with. For sale at reasonable prices and yet i still have too many.
---
If you keep going east of the whitespring bunker, then go up the highway about 50 metres away, there is nearly always a bugged floating tpose ghoul next to a car. Me and my friend found a game where it was literally pregnant.
---
Says fall? Whatever that means. :)
---
Can't say that is definitely it but would be my first thing to try
---
Does someone have a picture of the makeshift ronin helmet?
---
&gt;  with Fallout quirks
---
tee hee
---
Got a link to those people saying that? Cause I just checked YouTube and no one has a video saying any of those things.
---
Happing to a lot of people. Including me.
---
eyeball critter.... Snallygaster?
---
First met them in toxic valley, and again in Charleston
---
They ate me for lunch.  And dinner, and midnight snack....
---
about 90 levels later, I now take my revenge every time I get the chance :)
---
And there are even *bigger* fishes...
---
Would be awesome. Getting L4D vibes !!
---
It’s a Psn server issue check the status.playstation website for info
---
Maybe sony?
---
Playstation network is having issues
---
PSN is down right now for some reason a lot of ppl reporting issues across the board.
---
Think about it though, this change doesn't actually increase the attack power of an Instigating weapon, and if anything, it would motivate Instigating weapon users to take their time and let other players get shots in before they attack. As it works currently, you either rush to be the first person to get a shot in, or you don't bother playing with Instigating weapons at all. Jerks are always going to steal kills on trash legendary mobs, Instigating or not.  This change also isn't going to make it so people are suddenly able to one-shot Sheepsquatch or other tanky bosses.
---
If you want to beat explosive weapons, get a friend to hold one, get a sledgehammer, and start bashing away at the gun.
---
Now that's a proper response. I have tried the game it is much better. However it still doesn't invalidate my comment of they spent money on a mode no one asked for it to go free which no one in the community wanted. Even if it is for a short time it's a waste of man hours on something that could of been better content like maybe getting the human nps back in first and not later. It's only the #1 thing asked for.
---
Archer one is pretty ez to do. Just kill with and maintain a crossbow for a bit.
---
Give it some time, a lot of people are getting their Nuclear Winter on right now.
---
well.. you have a point.
---
Maybe each map has a different cryptid?
---
The engine couldn't handle it. Rendering speed is nowhere near fast enough
---
And in Nuclear Winter too.
---
I can’t tell what your even trying to say. Are you in survival or normal? What do you mean by win? Also stimpacks still have time before they top you off just shoot them dead during the animation.
---
Yup all red
---
I was booted from PSN twice today and now got the login error, seems like its been acting up all day.
---
Who cares about graphics? Graphics doesn't make a game good.
---
It's an after-death screenshot of a guy who basically one shot my entire team and 12 other people. He was walking around the area above New River Gorge Resort. 
---
I whited-out all the player information to stay in accordance with the rules of this sub.
---
My comment was a joke pointing a hilarious programming blunder. Glad we welcome criticism here in this sub the supposedly cares so much about the health of this game, franchise, and studio
---
Sheepsquatch is an old event now, mosty everyone has the rewards from it so not too many ever do it besides 1-2 people. With nuclear winter going on id expect even less
---
Welcome back. I have been waiting for your return. Lol. Been here from the beginning, put up with alot of B.S, but I  made it to this point, and I will keep on trucking till I hit 7600 hours, another 6300hrs to go, I  am now a level 300 player, and can't wait to get to level 760. Maybe Bethesda will  bake me a cake with my name on it! Lol. I wish everyone the best, see you in the wasteland.
---
The downsides to making a pvp mode like this and having a free trial.
---
I hope bethesda realise they're gonna need to pay more attention to reports now.
---
And aid in survival
---
I had a guy contest my workshop last night while I was in combat with 4 lvl 68 super mutants, shoot me in the back with an explosive shotgun, steal all my junk, then fast travel into the void.  He didnt even try to take the factory, just wanted to kill and steal.  I had a weeks worth of salvage on me (like 200 lbs worth) because I had been playing NW all week without hitting my stash box in adventure.  I was freaking livid.  This, however, was the first time someone has screwed with me in MONTHS.  Guess the point is (besides venting) that it happens once in a while, but is extremely rare.  Just know that when you own a workshop, it is possible.  Otherwise, you are free to adventure without grief.
---
I mean it depends on the event and server. High levels like myself are really only doing a few things. 1 grinding certain things because they have better legendary odds or 2 they some sort of rare item or recources. You are also in a high level area meaning someone a high level entered that area first. Really though unless its a raid boss dont expect people to drop everything.
---
Where on the map is your camp and which extractor is that?
---
How do you do a run? Server Hoping got patched right? So how does a run work?
---
Same, was hoping to hear more about character prestiging and such.
---
Bring on Fisto!
---
Wow. Yeah, obvious hacking is obvious.
---
This is why I now play most games on consoles instead of on my PC. Too much fuckery there. 
---
Surprised this isn't posted on mmogfails. That dude hacked the crap out of the PC version of ESO.
---
Found them at whitespring too
---
I agree, but there should be a daily cap of 50-100 atoms.
---
&gt; is NW progress shared with Adventure?
---
Yes it's shared XP and caps.
---
Just came back
---
Someone else posted this same person as well looks like he is popular.
---
Thanks for that level map link. It will certainly help. The enemy was level 32, I believe. We thought that we could defeat it as we had literally just taken on two level 60 something Super Mutants with no problems.
---
Yeah that person wrote it out better than I could have. It's been a bloody NIGHTMARE for some of us. Half go about their game playing blissfully unaware that the guy next to them is having so many issues. Glitches, bugs, disconnects. I calculate that for every hour we play, some of us, we spend 10 minutes TRYING to either get the game to load/work/respond OR trying to team up with our friends because the social menu is Totally BORKED all to hell. That said, I have over 1000 hours in haha
---
Phew, needed a hit.
---
It would help differentiate between what you can buy and what you already own. Nuclear Winter item favorites easier.
---
That perk tip is good to know! Got mostly none combat perks so far.
---
1:26:45 till a bit after.
---
I agree with almost everything you said, however "no NPC's" was true. I'm glad they're going to remedy that later this year, though!
---
seen it twice (PS4).  
---
They all dropped L1 Legendaries
---
Damn these are crazy. Anyone have pics of #89 the ronin helmet?
---
Either group em together at bottom/top or make a tab for them. Fishing for that one item for NW ain't fun.
---
Bad graphics won't ruin a great game... but they can certainly drag down one that is struggling in so many other areas (UI, stability, content). I've never understood this point... do you literally not care at all about how something looks? For some reason the entire game industry doesn't seem to share you opinion...
---
And before anyone jumps all over me about content, it's still pretty barren at "max level". Arktos Pharma is a potential nightmare, Burrows was 45 minutes (maybe) and not really worth repeating and the less said about SBQ and Impostor Sheepsquatch the better.
---
Shhhh! The T-50 is a special secret set just for us here in this thread. 
---
Just kidding, thanks for letting us know! Typo should be fixed shortly.
---
Sucks as this is my one night off this week!
---
I mean I never said they were youtube videos haha!
---
Go look at the thousands of comments on the Nuclear Winter trailers, any of the uploads, go look at the thousands of comments on the Bethesda E3 presentation. Go look at the live chats for some of the larger Streamers giving Fallout 76 a try. There you'll find a constant barrage of those types of comments, thats a hate train.
---
Is this why it's a massive ballache trying to select things on the map with a controller?? It never used to be this bad, but a fair few updates ago it just became impossible to choose targets on the map with any degree of accuracy.
---
Thank you.. but yes this is one thing I'm liking about these 'kill cams'.. it will help find people glitching or using aimbots
---
I doubt they will. They might add challenges might I doubt they add infinite amount
---
Don't forget Springs!
---
Thanks didn’t know what happened
---
 [https://downdetector.com/status/playstation-network](https://downdetector.com/status/playstation-network)

Having you start from scratch and a steeper difficulty curve alone would be a great start but at this point I don't imagine they're going to change the first suggestion

I’m always low on adhesive even though I have a pretty big farm to grow vegetables  starch screw and gear I’m low too
---
&gt; everyone seems to made of steel and me of paper.
---
This is me to a freaking T... How the heck does everyone else kill me in three shots, but when I attempt to get head shots with my Assault Rifle, I can not get them below half health. I really like the game mode, but that does get frustrating to me sometimes.
---
I don’t think they should we already get adventure mode caps and that is great
---
Beta veterans assemble!
---
It is a great game.. shits gonna be buggy at that level, especially trying what they did...the people who are bitching should just shut up...it's just a game.  If I don't like a game, on tho the next one
---
He is obviously talking about Nuclear Winter. Also, Extra Stimpacks (I think that's how they're called) get applied immediately.
---
Thx for your wise words there and indeed i think that's what i have to keep in mind :)
---
The mirelurk hatchlings that pop out of the queen.  I know because [I've gotten it](https://imgur.com/YPOILhe).
---
[Fever Claw](https://imgur.com/yvh9yI7) is also rare.  Only from diseased Mirelurk Hunters.
---
Because people will cry about anything
---
Yes, when you click Play (from the Main Menu) and the mode selection pops-up, look under Nuclear Winter and it tells you to press a key to toggle Auto Fill On/Off. Turn Auto Fill off and it will not let random people into your team. You can use this to play Solo or when playing with less than 4 people on your pre-team in the main menu.
---
Not gonna happen the game engine can’t handle it
---
The E3 deals is the only one I have done and likely will unless another better value comes around.  I don't do a lot of cosmetic things.   They have added a lot of decent dlc and wastelanders sounds like it will be awesome so I don't mind supporting the game a bit going forward.
---
I don't know what I can say that u/mirracz didn't already say.. But I am so glad people are giving the game an actual chance.. I remember people saying the game would be dead by now.. Glad you're having fun.  And depending on the system, hope to see you in Appalachia.
---
Hope it's back up soon. This is the first time this week I've had time to play and I go to login and then theres this ugh
---
NW: Daily challenges don't seem to work.
---
Unless they hotfix it or update it with the next patch, The Gun Fu Perk isn't working correctly. So you'll just have to Vats every enemy for now. I would just put different perks in its place for now as that's what I'm doing until it's fixed
---
And thank you for giving me not only multiplayer fallout but fallout in WEST BY GOD VIRGINIA (my home state) Fallout 76 is a masterpiece!
---
That is what everyone else claims that it is YouTube's on the hatetrain. That is why I checked YouTube to see if there was a hatetrain there. I couldn't find any from any YouTube's that have atleast 100 subscribers.
---
ROFL, are you seriously trying to use youtube comments to prove anything? You realize no one who spent any time on there pays attention to the comment section.
---
I can literally find thousands of comments on YouTube hating on literally anything. That means nothing.
---
There was major duping in the last 2 weeks and there has never stopped being duping methods since day 1, they find 1 hole, patch it, 3 others pop up... it just doesn't get widely known until it hits Youtube.  My issue is that they can ban dupers all day long (it will not stop duping) but when you start banning innocent players (which they have) then the game really loses credibility, as players can tolerate a lot of punishment (as seen in this game) but being banned falsely is a deal breaker (and seeing my friends or anyone getting falsely banned sucks)
---
For crafting ammo: Ammosmith (2) and Super Duper (3) 
---
For the materials, player vending machines and LFG (Looking for Groups) posts, when you find someone who grinds steel / lead etc and sells for good price, they are your new source (and maybe friend)
---
First person only here. Also, primarily solo, but sometimes I play with fill on., but I don’t change my playstyle. If my teammates end up near the end with me, I’ll stick around them, but most of the time I’m all for myself unless I’m playing with actual “friends” that I know. Kinda counterintuitive to what I said in my post I know...
---
That’s like someone walking by your house and just seeing your cat chilling there, obviously suffering from some incurable parasite, and coming over the fence to kill it.  Shameful : (
---
Thank you very much for your help!
---
Make the survival aspect even harder, more dangerous enemies that do higher damage spawn more, less aid and food on the map.
---
Make it season based with new character where the goal is to survive the longest but explore the most.
---
Make it perma death. and run it for a week or two -w- a decent reward at the end for people that exceed certain thresholds for categories: Highest distance travelled, most enemies slain, most workshops claimed, most events won ...
---
i giggled at this  :)
---
Good catch. I dont play that really so I totally spaced it
---
I've had good games where I've gotten 12 kills which is a lot with the numbers of players and that was dropping hot spots and hunting, but that was the end of the match.
---
That makes sense. I hope that spectate mode isn't the only form of "cheat detection" they added.
---
Same thing happened to me in a match earlier this game, except his name was slightly different; but it was the same guy. He was walking in an area above the map, and definitely had some auto-aim/high rate of fire mod running (he was using a pistol weapon). He ended up with 16 kills.
---
Awesome! Looking forward for the next update then - thank you!
---
I have a Deathclaw named Kevin.  He disappeared one day in much the same manner but, somehow he returned again like a week later just walking around my camp like nothing ever happened.  I like to think he took a vacation to go visit his deathclaw family.
---
Kevin decided to go on another journey again last night, here's hoping he comes home soon (and may your good boy return one day too).
---
Anyone who... Does ellipses... After... Every few words...

---
The fact that you can speak three languages is why Asia is on the rise.
---
Handmade and Lever never used to drop much, so I expect them to be rare at player vendors.
---
Every time.
---
They had Harpers Ferry
---
And we all know how annoying those explosive turrets are.
---
I feel you i sat down to stream and couldnt even login rip
---
There are “real” pvp players that play in survival now. Quite a few actually, and 90% of survival mode is having a good build/knowing the map &amp; setting up your weps and armor properly. 
---
God-tier legendary stuff is great but not necessary at all to do well in survival.
---
Ha, FWIW, I tag like a dozen things - gears and screws, but also oil, copper, black titanium and other things that are either rare or that will sell for a nice price when you Bulk them. I actually don't run low on screws that much - I have a couple hundred - but I pretty much always need plastic, because I have so many other junk materials.
---
Yep survival is really bad you either 1 tap or get 1 tapped then quit when score is to high. Its really something they should have just made adventure with just default pvp on.

The game has been fun since beta. People just whined and look for reasons to be upset, which was then echoed on different platforms. That seemed to be what got the most ratings and so people stuck with that narrative. Were/are there some issues yes. They have been worked on and the game has since improved.
---
If this is your first time playing i doubt you could help in any way huting a Sheepsquatch, go get XP somewhere else, it looks like you want to be carried and get to higher levels without deserving it.
---
This issue has been repprted sicnce patch 8. Bethesda simply told us to remove friends. Which is absurd and unacceptable. Its 2019. Having 150 friends shouldn't be a problem for a game in this generation.
---
You make a good point, yesterday I was
---
(booted from server)
---
hey hey i like this idea!
---
Because its cool to hate on Bathesda, and Epic Games, and EA... and generally people on the internet stuck.
---
Im seeing a lot of posts that psn is down now. Im not home from school but im pretty sure thats whats happening
---
His nickname was "NicePingForMe" 
---
Fucking ass.
---
You can radiate em
---
@ u/valseek u/ladydevann
---
I feel like the gun and combat mechanics in fallout don’t really lend themselves to battle royale type games. The game mode is somewhat fun but it’s also a shit show.
---
A good strategy
---
I think it’s likely Adventure mode will be split into two subcategories: Legacy and Wastelanders. New players will be advised to play legacy first as it is year 1 content only.
---
They're having server issues I'm pretty sure.
---
I think he was talking about the food builds. A decent amount people that play a lot of pvp are kind of toxic
---
You should also throw his name out on your console groups and anyway ya can.. let other people know.. what was it Bingonme or something
---
PSN is down atm.
---
Weird how opinion of a game changes when people actually play it, rather than just echoing outdated negative feedback.
---
I miss Three Dog, and would love to experience someone like him again.  It'd be great to have a DJ commentary over the radio between songs and making "this just in" announcements when events pop up on the server.
---
Turns out I was wrong.
---
Why? We got something better...nukashine.
---
Wrong😂temporary suspension they have to unban all suspended players at some point. Big oof.
---
Man, how does she even lift her pipboy with those arms?!
---
Honestly I think the BR should have account wide rewards. No way in hell am I gonna play my alt when I just want to level up and get that hellfire PA.
---
Two separate Perk cards, three points each, I think under Perception.
---
I don't play fallout 76 on PS4.
---
game isn't competitive enough to boycott over some consumable boost
---
It’s definitely a diffuse texture suffix. 
---
The black and white ones are likely the bump maps
---
It comes and goes depending on what’s been released. In a few weeks after the shine of NW where’s off the end gamers will be back to their nuking and legendary farming shenanigans
---
This has been happening to me since this update as well
---
Aww thats what it could have been. I did see some crimson hanging on a tree.
---
And instead of a nuke we can call in a scorchbeast attack
---
I have no idea what you are on about.
---
I did like that crossbows in NW has a 3 charge to them instead of one. Those things can take 2/3 health on a shot. Thought it was going to be week. Was surprised.
---
Is it defo both platforms? If it was just PC I'd say it was because of mods, but if you're getting the same on xbox...
---
I've had this issue for about a month and a half, so I don't think they've had issues that long.
---
I like semi auto laser weapons. Recoil is manageable and they have quick follow up shots and good damage
---
Have you tried the age old solution of a smooth unplugging , followed by the traditional plugging back in?
---
Which one is this ?
---
Fire team leader!
---
Awesome! Thanks for the update!
---
I just factory reset my PC, so let me get Fallout 76 reinstalled. But yes, the issue is on both. I last checked the PC last week and the xbox a couple minutes ago.
---
Can’t help but feel with all the communism stuff - we will be playing out the post-war war.
---
Need time to get those slaps in.
---
Oh and to try and punch soccer balls.
---
whats ur twitch? would love to watchj when its back up
---
Lol.
---
The link has clearly a `&amp;t=5202s` timestamp. It does not work on your machine?
---
Your on the server in your area unless a country has banned it you should be able to play
---
Idk I feel like this would commit to trolling lower level players when your lvl 40 teammate kills themself and destroys you
---
damn auto correct :(
---
It's back up for me.
---
Well a dev employee just commented on this tread about them so there will be news soon. :)
---
That’s how survival should be
---
Yea, I didn’t realize how much he had so I just clicked through all of it by the time I realized he had left the game
---
Agree agree agree!
---
if amazon is in your area its for sale on amazon for 17.00
---
I'm in a Fallout discord and everyone liked to harp on the game any time they saw I was playing. It got to the point where I was about to leave, because it turned into a huge clusterfuck that had the same points brought up over and over. Luckily, the worst offenders left, and a few of them decided to play for the free week.
---
Lo and behold, they're having fun, and want to buy the actual game. I've gotten so many "Is 76 good yet" messages from friends and like bitch I ALWAYS liked this game. Play the free trial and make up your own damn mind, You already know I love the game and play every day. I'm not gonna hold your hand lol
---
How do you mark them w/o workbenches?
---
Its like seeing someone mowing their lawn coming over and then throwing a grenade through the front window and then killing the dog when it comes out to protect its home.
---
I get you, everyone is different, if you do stick around long enough to get through it pretty soon you won't even notice the bugs
---
It’s also 50% off on ps4. Nuclear winter is making up for all the BS I put up with these past few months worth it.
---
Game/PSN is down
---
Yeah, you don't have to destroy it until you wanna place it down again... and it flashes green but won't fucking place.
---
Its psn itself not the game
---
I've found it works intermittently.  Sometimes it doesn't work at all for hours and sometimes it works too well targetting enemy's so far out of range I couldn't hit them with a ballistic missle.  They didnt apparently test gunfu after they made changes to vats that look to me like they were made specifically to improve gunfu.  Par for the course with Beth.  I chuckled.
---
they do still have the basic training glitch which pretty much breaks the game for you.  Cant join brotherhood because cant progress thru the quest line bc its bugged and that is about the only glitch pissing me off.  Tired of waiting
---
For some reason, cows have been going aggressive on me lately when they get near me.  I'm a Plague Walker, but it even happens when I don't have any diseases.
---
&gt; Does anyone else like to hide in bushes and watch
---
What, who me?  No officer, I just dropped something.
---
PlayStation network is down. Hitting all PS4 players afaik
---
I think it's because PS Network is down right now.
---
Edit:  [https://status.playstation.com/en-us/](https://status.playstation.com/en-us/)
---
PSN is down at the moment.
---
It's a game changer
---
Nice! Thank you!
---
Not on mobile, but thanks for pointing that out. I’ll skip forward
---
o/
---
I'd like to see a daily challenge to win Overseer.  20 atoms or so, resets every day.  Would encourage more people playing to win.
---
Well said, fellow member.
---
I was against the whole battle royal thing but me and my crew spent a whole day in it and other then everyone punching each other in the lobby it was a lot of fun. I’m actually glade they opened it up.
---
It's a game.
---
No, it's a psn problem, all the online games are down.
---
Yup. And if your adventure mode character has 15 str and 1 perception like mine, all the good rifle cards are unusable, gimping your damage in br mode.
---
Its godotscafe. Me and a buddy made it pretty recently and he hasnt ever played Fo76 so that's why I'm bummed its down rn.
---
Idk I run the game pretty well, but sometimes there are hiccups
---
For me it happens with Pipe Bolt Rifle
---
Fair point and I can see where you're coming from. Look, I've only experienced the game at its current state since the start of the free week, a much healthier state then when it launched for sure. The most I can hope for is that the players that spent their money on the game/collectors editions etc. will feel like it was worth it in the near future. Not being snarky but I hope you do get your canvas bag since that's what you paid for and deserve it. 
---
  The way I see the Nuclear Winter thing is that it is fun and as a sneak peek during the free week it has helped bring new players to the game ensuring a stronger player base for the real release of Wastelanders and Nuclear Winter, as quite a few people have bought the game because of it. I'm buying it because of the Adventure mode since that's more of what I like. Nuclear Winter giving you Adventure mode XP and caps is also nice since it helps your character grow even when doing the BR stuff. Having a leveled adventure mode character also helps you in nuclear winter since you can have more perk cards equipped. I gotta say thats a pretty neat way to make both modes important for all players. Glad you have tried 76 recently since there are many that have completely left the game after the terrible launch.
---
Yes, which I clarified in my second comment.
---
Oh never mind I was wrong. Now I’m getting that error too
---
I can second **all** of this.
---
There were two audiences
---
1. one was receptive to this new **"experiment"** Bethesda was pumping out, *heading their warnings of it being different and a challenge for them to make*
---
1. the other there was a much more vocal audience who were afraid Bethesda was going to make all of their beloved single player, story rich, games into trashy online cash grabs
---
It was the second groups self-assigned crusade, **probably out of fear** that their suspicions would come true, that they must do all they can to amplify every mistake of the game. YouTuber's, who are widely persuaded by view counts on their videos, jumped on the bandwagon to keep their views up.
---
**Overall**, a sad state of affairs, but those of us that saw the experiment for what it was, were interested in following what the game could be. Turns out... a lot of fun!
---
**Welcome to the Wasteland** fellow vault dweller :)
---
I wonder if they've tried turning it off and back on again?
---
It doesn't top *Fallout 3* for me, but I'm glad you're enjoying it.  I am as well.
---
Did you not read my post? I said I play on Xbox and PC. Not playstation.
---
It was buggy at the start.  They had a short beta period which was in no way meant as anything but a preview for preorders. It wasn't long enough to accept feedback/bug reports in time for it to be fixed for launch. So it launched with bugs and all. I participated in the beta because I preordered, but after playing for a bit, I cancelled my preorder. I'm glad I did, but they haven't implemented the features I want yet. My main issue with recent events is that they added the BR mode before they added something they promised at launch, private servers and mods (I mostly want private servers).
---
Just using the term run loosely.  depends on which direction I'm coming from,  Generally, a "WS run" for me is:
---
WS station, through the WS gate, down the row of cottages, across to the presidential cottage, over to the golf club, pass the pool, down the other row of cottages, around the back of the building, left through the breezeway, straight across the spawn in point, hop the hedge, go around to the back parking lot to brick laundry building.  Clear the parking lot and the building.  Through the breezeway again (which brings you back to the spawn in point).  walk over to WS station, scrip stuff. 
---
By that time, everything has respawned, so you can do it all again.
---
Definitely a good idea. Had some trouble figuring out what I had and didn’t have last night.
---
I will try harder...and see if it happens to me...that is a pity...gun fu was awesome
---
The game was released in a really terrible state with many bugs, missing features that were normally in every other game, poor servers, poor launcher, and the game had no real purpose to it. I haven't played it since release so things may have changed, but the reviews of the game getting 4 and 5 out of ten were sensible, while 0s and 10s were just silly.
---
Had to restart the game twice before I could log in.
---
Edit: Nvm. It didn’t let me stay for more than a moment.
---
Gears screws and springs for weapons and armor, lead acid or gunpowder and steel for ammo, gold silver and black titanium for selling/armor, ballistic fiber for armor, adhesive for guns, weapons...
---
Honestly pick up everything. If you don't use it there's a way to sell it.
---
There’s no “right level area”. There are places in Appalachia that are easier to navigate for lower level players but that doesn’t mean you’ll not have any trouble with them. And it also doesn’t mean you can’t make it through the tougher areas at lower levels either. Utilize stealth and long range weapons to take out tougher enemies from a distance. You’d be surprised at how well a good hiding spot allows for taking out groups
---
Can’t play till later tonight will be on tomorrow a lot I work 9-5 every work day 
---
I have been playing BR for 3 years now

None of my friends have it and really want a team who is competent.

I also don’t take it seriously though.

Anyone feel free to add me and invite when ever

I also have a mic
---
I'm most interested in the prestige system.  I started saving great, underleveled rifles as soon as the roadmap was shown.
---
So far I've got a lvl 5 Furious Pipe Rifle, a lvl 10 Instigating/Explosive/reload DR Hunting Rifle, a lvl 20 Two-shot/E/Reload combat rifle, a lvl 35 TS/E/AG handmade, and a lvl 40 instigating/+10%aim pipe bolt rifle for leveling.  I'm really looking forward to that feature.
---
Why did I drop from 56 upvotes to 15? When every single comment in this thread is positive?
---
Gamefly has it used for 9.99.
---
Not downvoted? Surprising lol
---
Come on, everybody on r/Fallout *knows* that we r/FO76 people *all* have White Knight.  :)
---
Ha get xbox a bit more reliable internet service
---
I have a question, and the answer may be obvious to everyone but me.  Why do people look through the game files or datamine to find out information that hasn’t been released?  The people that have these talents and interest certainly are some of the ones that provided some amazing mods in Fallout 4, so I am not knocking on it at all, nor am I saying anything negative.  Hopefully you take my question in sincerity.  I usually never look at stuff like this because I like surprises.  But I saw your title and picture and thought I would ask.  I would imagine it’s the curiosity, which I totally get.  For me once I’ve made the decision I want something, (like to see a new movie or something), I want as little information about it as possible.  I could also imagine that it’s because you’re accessing more and more information about something you enjoy.  There’s no wrong answer in my mind.  I was just curious as to what motivates you?
---
Maybe request those people do this on their threads? Ya know like direct suggestion rather than a vague one like this.
---
This is the problem with games going free to play. I think nearly every online game that is FTP has it. Just glad this is only temporary.
---
Thanks for the tag! We're aware of and looking into the issue where your weapons are unloaded after logging in. 
---
For the second issue with your 50 cal, I'll be sure to note it down for investigation.
---
Thanks for the reports!
---

---
That just sounds like a quick way to get violently violated by a Sheepsquatch. Have lube in your inventory. ;)
---
I have a two shot 50 cal machine gun if you want it max level
---
Good news is they are aware of the problem and have posted it is being fixed.  Sucks there is no eta though.
---
So your point was that the game is a mess and your only supporting point for this conclusion was just a joke, but you definitely have better supporting points that others should assume exist.  
---
You believe that criticizing games is the best way to improve them, regardless of whether you can indicate what is presently lacking and possible ways that deficit could be improved.
---
Cool.
---
I dunno man my brother seems to sit on it fine
---
True, but you can store all pieces, or not in that case?
---
Nice work.  Hopefully they don't "fix" this.
---
Good to hear that,Hoping they will fix soon rather than later
---
I like to leave bags of fertilizer at people's door.
---
He said 168 :/
---
You can explore vault 51 for lore items, holotapes, terminal entries as you increase overseer levels. I'm guessing they 4 minutes was intended for that, along with perk card management.
---
Should be vault raids (94&amp;96), legendary player progression according to roadmap. I would expect camp object decor, permanent nuclear winter and survival mode proper as well as balance patches as well
---
I don’t think it’s a thing. It could be referring to Ultracite PA
---
It would seem that either you didn't have enough duped items to trigger ban or the ban system simply failed to find you.  So perhaps you got lucky, others not so much...
---
This is great! I will be using this method when I get home
---
Saw this guy last night too. Same name, except he/she changed the word "name" for "ping". Flying around like Free Cam, killed 25 people. Reported to Bethesda, for whatever good it will do...
---
Todd wasn't lying about that part at E3
---
Conceptually, in a broad-strokes non-game-experience kind of way, it's pretty damn cool that we started out roaming around not knowing what the fuck was up and dropping nukes on this new found world to now having player vendors, incoming human NPCs, festival events, etc.  It's a growing, bustling world that is developing from its infancy after exiting the vault.
---
You can’t still place items on the eu. We mats to get them closer to other objects.
---
Yup. Had the nicepingforme dude on my team and I watched him drop under the map and shoot people. I didn't have Shadow play on at the time unfortunately, but this dude is 100% hacking. The PoS also chooses to fill and just abandons the team right off the bat. Crazy how every hacking report I've seen seems to be this one PoS.
---
It happens to the best of us.  Except for me.  I thought I was wrong once, but it turns out I was mistaken.
---
Ill watch for you. Would love to team up. I’ve solo’d up to Level 68 but need some teammates to tackle end game activities with. LegendaryPapaD if you don’t mind tackling Appalachia with an old dude
---
Things like this name glad that I play on ps4.
---
If you look at this website and put in the weapon and perks you use it will calculate exactly how much damage each one does against an enemy with any given protection
---
Scorchbeast queen = 300 physical and energy
---
[Get to da chopper!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs_OacEq2Sk)
---
It may not be an IP ban though. I never did voice chat or typed anything.
---
Sorry it’s happening to you guys.  I’m just pointing out some of us aren’t.  I’m not arguing pointless things if I’m saying that it’s fine for others.  🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Shooting a guy that is already down takes zero skill, the guy that actually downed him during a battle deserves that kill. Just like every other BR game. Not sure how you're not understanding that. Plenty of times I've downed 2-3 guys in a row and then told my noob teammates to finish them off while I engage the last couple of guys. What do you know, I took out the whole team but my teammates have more kills than me, even though they literally didn't help at all. That's what doesn't make sense.
---
It stores as a blueprint... which needs to be broken down... then it all appears in your "stored" items, yes.  So  you get to keep all the mats used as opposed to scrapping them, but then you still have to rebuild from the ground up.
---
The 2 shot effect doesn’t double the damage on the weapon card but does shoot two bullets both doing the same damage.
---
Fucking server disconnect every hour just about. Absolutely ridiculous
---
Fuck :(
---
It works well and is more efficient If you need to make ammo for a single weapon, or a relatively small amount of different ammo types.  
---
When I make ammo, I do it in batches of 1000 to 5000, and make .50 cal, shotgun ammo, and 5.56 ammo.  
---
I use about 2500 to 3000 rounds of .50 cal when doing a single Scotch Beast Queen event.  If I remember correctly it takes about 200 lead and 800 steel to replace the bullets per event and I usually don’t replenish until after two or three events. 
---
You might get that much lead if you hit the motel, fire station, and the prison yard and/or Hornwright estates, assuming that they aren’t picked over.  If they are, you’ll have to sever hop.     
---
or...  I can grab the workshop at Hemlock Holes and then head to Lucky Hole Mine.  
---
To each their own....
---
Did a google search on the name, see other bans listed in other games for that name.
---
I accidently shot a players Deathclaw when I went to their base to buy stuff. Scared the crap out of me. Fast travelled and boom Deathclaw. Thankfully I think all I did was tickle it with the shot. No real HP loss.
---
Thanks for this!! I’ve been wanting a hard copy so this was perfect. Just picked up my Walmart’s last two!!!
---
Do these come with the game if it's used?
---
Thanks for the quick response!
---
Listen here Enclave drone! Im sure if you joined me in some Watoga Boogaloo on survival mode my Sniper Rifle and me would give you a run for your money 🙏
---
Yeeeeees! Omg best mode ever lol.

Beast mode ever?

You seriously made me search the first video on youtube when I typed Fallout nuclear winter. Are you blind or a troll?
---
  You asked me to show you the hate train, there it is. Look at the vote ratios for each video. Hell look at Jim sterlings most recent video, what more do you want? Fallout 76's hate train has never been shy or hard to find haha
---
Where were you?
---
Im with you. I made a similar thread asking about permadeath opinion. The best thing would be separate Survival with Survival permadeath. Remove leaderboard in permadeath + legendary stuff, stealth boy etc.
---
I’ve made my posts and comments elsewhere and submitted plenty of tickets. This became more about pointing out that this sub doesn’t care if this game gets better if it means there’ll be criticism along the way. Look how you’ve taken even my joke criticism and gotten butthurt. The people of this sub don’t care if it improves.
---
Having that cliff run down the center of the map opens up a cool risk/reward dynamic. You you drop on the top side and risk falling to your death if the storm pucshes east and you have to climb down? Do you drop on the Mire side and just accept that you're probably fucke if the circle closes west on the top side of the ridge?
---
Pathetic.
---
Look!  One of the haters he described so well actually showed up as a PERFECT example!
---
Maybe you were IP banned for being a rude fuck?!?
---
The reviews at launch were true though. The game was garbage but now it’s good. Just because it’s good now doesn’t mean it was good then
---
back to FO : NV, where you the Wander were the one to decide...
---
I disagree. Sometimes getting the kill can be very difficult. And again points are awarded for both downs and kills separately.
---
When exploits get discovered they will work on fixing them. Tuesday’s challenge was place your camp 4 times, but it happened to accidentally be repeatable, giving you a perk card (or 50 overseer xp) every single match. A few of us farmed that method til we got a shit ton of perk cards at early levels. Seems Bethesda took notice and disabled the daily challenges altogether. Probably smart, you get some great perk cards later on!
---
Well... it doesn't ALWAYS happen, according to some.
---
but it ALWAYS happens to me. Unless (as with a couple of my characters) I keep the whole thing quite small.
---
But my full on, large CAMPs? Yeah, I can't move those, something ALWAYS screws with my placement.
---
And when buying it? If the game is global why there is regional keys all around? :S
---
I think it would be cool to make all weapons and armor barebones but have survival perk cards that replace legendary effects on weapons. Example a perk card under endurance with 5 levels called Bloodied Wastelander. You deal up to 15/20/25/30/35% extra damage the lower your health but your health depletes 35% faster. Or under Intelligence called explosive weapons, your weapons deal 5/10/15% additional damage because their shots explode upon impact, but you will take area damage from these shot
---
I had an issue with the original Xbox and the 360. My One X has been flawless. Knock on wood lol. 
---
I've had a ton of network issues with Sony. Some with Nintendo as well, but Microsoft has been pretty darn good.
---
As far as I know there is a set amount of water your camp can produce every hour. I believe 12 is the magic number. If you had 20 purifiers that could produce 40 (2 each purifier) then only 6 of them would actually put any output and make the 12 limit.
---
When I first started I did the same thing. Built a ton of purifiers and waited but not much happened. Since then I’ve got 6 medium purifiers and empty them every time I go back to my camp. If you go back every hour and empty them you should be set on waters.
---
Same here except I'm a Mom. I get team invites but I always gotta decline cause my little guy is going to get up from his nap soon.
---
I've done it a few times when I've had a no mic team where half of them choose high conflict areas.  I usually have a better chance on my own than following them.
---
Tse Gatling plasma is still insanely broken
---
I see, that sucks indeed.
---
Agreed.
---
Is the game region locked?
---
I haven't paid close attention in my brief 3 games, but do you see player name tags above enemies? (when you target them or not?) Is there a reason to crouch (in NW), other than to be a smaller target?
---
just another something to hate..
---
On a side note can walking armory be a real card for adventure mode please? 
---
“Reduces weight of all weapons by 75%”

I don't know how it was, so I can't really speak on any difference.  I haven't tested the map controls, but the deadzone feels the same which may map it a little difficult to select things easily, however there doesn't seem to be any restricted diagonal movement.
---
I just hope it isn’t like the month long outage of 2011. Had just got lost planet 2 after playing the multiplayer demo.
---
By the time it went back up it was a dead game. Got wipeout for free tho so not too bad, better get some free shit off this one

I feel like he should get a special reward if he was 76 at the start

Google: vault 51 wiki
---
I found it very interesting :)
---
That would be perfect!
---
On Bethsesda forums there was a message of a dev saying the NW related daily challenges were deactivated for now, with no current fix date.
---
Only the dailies though, all other NW challenges seem to work.
---
OFC they didn't swap the challenge list with alternative ones, taking out 10 or more potential atoms from each of us every day :P
---
Used to that by now anyway.
---
It’s Info Wars level of conspiracy.
---
Broken or nerfed
---
...for about an hour now
---
X-02 is the Fallout 3 "Black Devil" Enclave Power Armor, so it's probably coming at a later date if the terminal mentions it
---
which will break the lore even more if it IS the Black Devil armor because that shit wasn't created until AFTER the Oil Rig got destroyed in 2241
---
I’m actually agreeing with this because 1000+ hours and I’ve looked in those things maybe twice.
---
I’m on
---
do you still have this? what platform are you on? been searching for one of these for a while
---
Yeah, YouTube is definitely making the frogs ghey.

Can you post a picture of your camp? It sounds really cool!

I've recently made the transition from student to real life and fallout is the only game I play now because its so flexible in terms of time commitment.
---
I am disliking proper adulting, 76 acts as a pressure release lol
---
Even if they did add atom points to NW it would be just like adventure modes atoms: ie an abysmal award you would never be able to get.  IE Get a triple kill with a broadsider while in a nuke zone wearing only the Easter Bunny costume for 10 points.

Adventure mode had some really fun and engaging challenges for the first 2 months until they realized we were never going to buy atoms if we could earn them.  Started off dropping from 20 to 30 atoms per challenge to 10.  Now they are so ridiculous you might get two or three done a week.  They just aren't interested in handing out free money.
---
same as multiple other posts, the game is currently down.
---
PSN is down
---
I actually played with this guy and thought he was hacking but I thought this about 5 seconds before I was kicked from the game.( first time it happened) so I figured getting kicked is what made it seem like he was hacking. Now I think my game fucked up because he was hacking.
---
Would love that, Make him a companion that wields a Super Sledge hammer, or would the Railway rifle be better since it shoots railroad spikes?
---
I feel ya
---
Sweet! I’ll send you a friend request now. I work similar hours and have the same attitude towards the game
---
oh wow i didnt even realize that was a perk card in NW.... is it a "9" cost card?
---
Brace yourself...
---
**"Am i banned?"**
---
posts are coming.
---
Why the hell are we waiting on main screen to get a match if we can chill on Vault 51 waiting for the other 51 players....
---
I hope never.. 8D
---
Have a nice day !
---
It generally seems to make you easier to hit.  Have never tested the hit boxes, but it likely has larger ones.  I tend to avoid it atm.  There could be some NW cards that make it more useful.
---
Psn is down not the game
---
Fuuuuuuuuck these kinds of posts
---
What an asshole
---
Is yours saying your signed out of profile and disconnected from server?
---
Error 2:0:219578....
---
You on PlayStation?
---
Oh phew I thought something happened to my game.
---
And if you don’t want to scrap your current camp to build NW blueprints, claim a workshop and build them there. I don’t know why it took me two days to figure out you could do this, but FYI, you can do this.
---
I see where you are coming from too but in the end it's just like this example here. If I took your money at a car dealership and came back with a boat you'd be pretty pissed. Especially if I said everyone has a boat right now so we got you one for you with that money you gave us. It's not what you paid for and you have every right to be mad that it's not a damn car. I payed for adventure rpg with friend with 16 times the detail (yes Todd tell me more lies, he's In the chess club you know) and you give me a battle royal....... and a year later at that.  Not to mention at the expense of the NPCs which should of been in the damn game from the start. That's why I even bothered to comment. It's just modern fraud but it won't cost them money just fans.
---
Lol my favorite vault 51 Hobby since time for reading terminals is often too short.
---
Like all puppys.
---
apples and oranges
---
Thank you! I thought something was wrong with my game
---
Nice idea, and I agree.  As of now the vending machines and pre-war currency are practically useless.  To your point, it makes sense that the train station vending machines would take paper money since they were implemented before caps were a thing.
---
Thanks for letting me know
---
I agree with you fully.
---
Let's hope they change that after this week "pre-beta".
---
so the datamined pictures of it show it with a bull barrel yet it doesnt use it.. i hate that
---
it makes you much easier to detect, that's for sure.
---
and in Ah-nolds voice: RUN TO THE CHOPPA!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
It's a one day shipping item, the box has the code to use on the launcher. No disc
---
So lame
---
I don't want it to end! Come back NW!!
---
Yeah, didn't bother looting them till someone said on voice "omg crossbow has 3 shots".
---
If only it had a scope it would be my go to weapon every time.
---
Yes please! Or the craft stations!
---
Yes it is, and by far the best investment on any perk card I’ve used so far.
---
What System? And How Much? Im not exactly rich on Caps...
---
IDK. 
---
I started doing WS around L27 (I'm L100 now), so I've gotten that place pretty much figured out.
---
I've visited Mrgph many times, but I've only done a full circuit of Berkeley a couple of times; I have not spent enough time there to develop a route or learn the critters patterns.
---
Geez, I hope that user gets banned from YouTube....what a turdmonger.
---
IIRC that only applies to hard copies? If you buy it digitally it should be fine but a USA bought hard disk game won't work on a China Playstation...
---
We, and when I say we, I mean the wife cause she's so awesome, just got our little 2yo guy into Daycare full time which is amazing, don't get me wrong, I love the little guy, but having some extra free time is beyond blissful!
---
&gt; They cant really know what's going to happen when millions of people all play at the same time until it happens. 
---
If you want to talk bullshit and cheap excuses, this is also a good one. Things like the damage bug (doing ''too much damage'' with guns so enemies would heal it off) that were in for months and absolutely must've popped up if they tested their game even decently should just not have been in the base build. End of discussion. Things that break or fuck with the core loop of your game- gunplay, which is all that Fallout is about now- need to be out.
---
There were a lot of problems in the BETA, yet it was barely long enough to fix any of them. It was more like a ''preorder to play the game early a few times''. You can argue what you want about the BETA, but it was specifically announced to help iron out bugs yet despite the mass of issues at launch they didn't think to extend that  beta...or y'know, maybe open up something meant to fix bugs to people who didn't just preorder your game out of blind faith?
---
&gt; Also I've been playing since beta and other then slight performance issues it's the same game with extra modes so this " it deserved all the hate in the beginning " bullshit is so fucking stupid and is a cheap excuse.
---
That's nice for you, but your experience doesn't reflect everyone else's. A lot of bugfixing and rebalancing was done since release and you won't find me shitting on any of that, because they have definitely put effort into trying to fix this game. Not NMS levels of effort, but still a commendable- and successful- attempt to try and fix the issues. But from my point of view, and a lot of other people who played from early in this game's life cycle as well, the launch was shit. 
---
Also, a cheap excuse for *what*? Getting angry because the produce delivered to us for 60 bucks was a bug ridden mess, online game or not? For fucks sake, there were bugs in SKYRIM that carried over to 76. I can understand connection issues but there was some network unrelated *really* dumb shit that should just not have been present, be it at BETA, launch or beyond.
---
Bring on the ban wave!
---
 "Hello I’ve been suspended for 4 months!"  
---
"How ever I am wondering when or if I will get unsuspended"  
---
I'd say in 4 months.
---
Yea, I have 2 ps4's &amp; both have same error msg. Its actually psn network. You can check the link I posted in the description👍
---
Water spray, that's what you need.  Spray him in the face when he's bad.  One of those big Firebreathers trucks should do it.
---
I'm glad you found it and I like the tip about doing it in survival.  I'm not even sure survival was out when I made this post but it makes alot of sense.  Definitely fewer people on those servers and therefore a much better chance of finding a plan spawn.  Thanks!
---
What makes that so absurd to you? Did you see this years State of the Union address?
---
I never said anything about buffing or nerfing anything and the main arguement he's having is the fact that there are some horrible glitches happening to people. Like not getting credited for a kill or healing someone in power armor and both people getting stuck. One game I killed about 14 people and got credited for 1. How is that any fair. I was playing solo so theres no reason why I shouldn't of gotten credit for those kills. See my point?
---
I'd be booting up now if I had one😂
---
So I should build 6 mediums? Or could I do 3 industrials? Or does it not even matter? Sorry noob as hell here.
---
My bro is online but I can’t log in and we only live 10 mins apart 😔
---
Well put. Someone complained that there were no NPCs and Bethesda was not listening to their fans. At E3, they announced NPCs, technically solving both issues, but the person doubled down on the hating.
---
At this point the bashing is more about momentum than reality
---
Ha, are you on PS4? One of my friends was doing the same thing last team we teamed up! :) 
---
I'm not a parent, but I agree with you and OP - It's nice and easy to login any time to 76 and to complete an event in 5 to 10 minutes, craft or harvest some stuff at my camp, get in a round of Nuclear Winter, and so on. They've done a really nice job of making most of the quests digestible in short play sessions.
---
I’ve also found that when it’s stuck if you duck and punch it it will usually spin free. We need a goal man!!!
---
I was thinking Morgantown and harpers ferry would make awesome NW maps just last night!
---
No worries, PSN down.
---
Me want play DAMIT
---
Savage 👊
---
Glad they fixed it, started fast traveling to land marks near by and walked to player camps due to that.
---
you flexing your character stupid and cool I guess except you sound like a fucking nice guy
---
Phenomenal tekkers
---
PS4 probably about 1000 or trade but I’m Flexible.
---
So, once your dead on that server you're out of that server and must start over. Very limited aid in the game so you need to kill other players for additional aid and survival needs.
---
Again, I get that.  I was defending my original response.  And again, I’m sorry that is happening to you guys.
---
I think I'm lvl 101 never looked up a build just kinda build around what weapon I like after lvl 50 all you have is time to move around your perk points and cards so d9nt worry man you've got time to figure your build out dont worry about maxing damage just have fun with your build
---
I like playing on console for this reason as well, but damn are the frame rates look garbage. I just wish there was a 1080p 60fps option.
---
Between work, wife, kid and all the little things in between fallout has fallen into those little gaps and really truly does satisfy that itch to game.
---
And don't worry, Proper adulting sorts itself out eventually, though I wouldn't hold your breath.
---
The network logged me out, but I just logged myself back in. Had to enter my psn password.
---
FYI you can press TAB to get rid of your 'game over screen' and spectate in fullscreen.
---
Yes, numerous times, I've even destroyed them and rebuilt them brand new. Didn't work for me. I have double the amount of generators, they're spaced far apart, I just don't understand
---
Exactly, it seems as if it was meant to be.
---
NPC stands for non-playable character. The game is full of them. Any enemy is a npc. The shops are run by robots which are NPCs.
---
If the game had no npcs it would be empty of everything but scenery.
---
Do you remember where? Only reason I ask is whoever yelled at you might have been trying to help you or might have been a dick.
---
Get a pet they said, it would be fun they said... ;)
---
Well they technically are right now (which I took full advantage of) but now I need to buy a key after the week ends.
---
This is a fair response. 
---
However, in addition, part of the backlash was also compounded by the promises that were made regarding the game at E3. Many people felt that the game didn't live up to those promises at all, and they felt cheated at every turn to pay full price for a game that felt so incomplete at times that then turned around and leaned so heavily into costly day 1 cosmetic microtransactions that were standard fare for character customisation in fallout 4 and previous entries (Like certain hairstyles and tattoos came with fallout4). 
---
People don't like paying in full for unfinished games (from large studios) and don't like feeling like content which should have been included in the base game was removed to later make money. Overall that cause extra backlash but it was not unwarranted, in my opinion.
---
I do not. But he didn't offer any help he just said I was stupid for going there
---
They must have added that. You couldn't before.
---
&gt;I'm on PS4 as well, and that's not a terrible price, ill message you.
---
I don't understand what I'm seeing.
---
Got to have some balance :) hahaha
---
You had 100k of dupes in your inventory? Could you even move around with all that weight?
---
Tried and and no luck
---
wow... yea..
---
worked.
---
still realy uncool. i wont buy it.
---
Nothing more then usual anyways.
---
Perfect. Thanks. 
---
I hope nukes and dragons does a NW builder.
---
PlayStation is usually pretty good about fixing stuff quickly.
---
Please remove the video link, or Black the names out of the offenders, and I can reapprove your post. Reddit (and this sub) has rules against witch-hunting.
---
No its a thing
---
I always check because I'm not one for hoarding in on someone else's farming. Unless it's nuked then there is enough to go around.
---
Same here , Belgium . Can not log in
---
It does get easier. Once they get to 8 or 9, the problem changes to them and their buddies bugging you to play Fartnite or goat simulator together.
---
If you can't see it with your own eyes it doesn't matter what I say. I like the game, I just want to read real discussions and all this sub does is jerk itself off.
---
That's a legacy gun. I'd keep it just for the memories.
---
No Xbox. I think there must be a lot of stay at home parents though who manage to squeeze in an hour or so here and there though when you consider the age of the franchise. Lol, whenever I hear a young kid on the mic I want to ask em if they were even born when Fallout 3 came out.
---
You clearly never pubg'd before
---
I killed two people with a board yesterday !   It was an unlikely circumstance ( it was the only weapon I had) and it was MARVELOUS !! 
---
I basically let everyone kill each other as I hid, then came charging  out as they were looting.   
---
Promptly got killed as I was looting them.
---
That really bites. I can produce tons of corn and mutfruit, but you're saying there's a limit on water? I've seen people at white springs with like 30 of the in ground ones, and they all produced water because he allowed me to loot them. I'd do all in ground but I moved where I am to specifically put the industrial because I thought they would give me tons of purified water.
---
confirmed on PC
---
I'll honestly have to do a lot of digging. I think I had actually mentioned it in another one of my posts, but it was shown on the Bethesda Forums.
---
uhg I know, It was getting unbearable hearing all the negativity for a game I loved. Now i'm eye rolling at all the people who act like they never said anything bad.
---
Explosive damage is calculated separately. It doesn't show on tooltip.
---
AA should work against mobs. But I remember hearing it only worked against DR and not ER, so maybe it has no effect.
---
I’m not a native english speaker, I don’t tend to punish myself watching international politics when my actual country is shitty by itself.
---
At most he admit to have dupes. At least they can’t do anything at that weight and have to destroy them.
---
Ive seen used copies for that price but new is still 200.
---
I can relate to what the OP is saying, in fact was just pondering that very option today.
---
We all have the option to “rank up” a card - as in game, why not permit “rank down” a card that you have multiple copies of. 
---
Even if for no other reason to say that card or cards were obtained through the 5 level up card pack awards. Not a mistake pick, just the luck of the draw duplicate.
---
I can see how having the option to level down a perk and apply it for another would be greatly beneficial to the players trying different skill set directions... particularly those who may not have the time to grind out another 9 levels required to go from full out melee to a gun toting transition. 
---
That being not unlike the requirement to equip and weapon enhancing perk, but a skill card like lock pick, or fix it good - or even gunsmith... why do I need to equip a card for that skill I already paid level ups for?
---
Anyway, the rank down would permit a less labor intensive change of a given character load out. 
---
I for one find it enjoyable to super tune your play style and making that experience more efficient for many could be just what that rank reuse point would allow.
---
I just want the damn medic one.
---
And then I still want the medic BOS scribe outfit.
---
Level 5 with 2 dupes.   Sigh.  
---
Duping always a problem in this game.
---
i've seen two different variants of his name.
---
so either he got caught and made a new toon, or for some reason he started over .
---
Lol my favourite build was my vats critical rifleman. Taking alot of getting used to with free aim
---
This. Got mine back in December, it’s fun but really useless, breaks after ten shots. A fun toy to keep that’s all.
---
Keep it, if it's not in the game anymore, that drives value up over time
---
Yeah, the large has a capacity of 3. So 5 bottles
---
I've been playing for a few days and scouring reddit with my free time in order to pick up some tips and tricks.  This is by far the best info I've found yet!
---
Any other good tips/tricks for new players?
---
someone cheating.
---
Wow! Clever! Thanks for the tip :)
---
That's where I am, too. Somehow, this game fits my every need. 
---
A few minutes? lets empty my collector and rearrange my CAMP.
---
A couple hours? Let's do some storyline.
---
Anything in between? Sure thing.
---
This game is damn near perfection for where I am in life.
---
You know what man, thanks for going into detail about this. Thanks for hearing me out as a newer player with a different experience and I do understand why you feel scammed. As for the game I do hope you stick around and continue to play. Have a good one!
---
The Playstation Networks are confirmed down, the affected areas are games, social, music, videos and streaming and such.
---
Ha! Just laughed out loud here at work.  Like...”well that escalated quickly.”
---
I pray Fornite dies before he's able minded to think about video games. Though I have let him attempt to Sea of thieves and well.... it was good, until the ship sank. "hello oshean" "Ship!" "Whoa" and "Shark stop, Shark no" and whats the shark say? "Do do dooo doo do do". It's going to blow his mind one day when he realizes sharks don't sing Baby shark.
---
Looked could not find it. If I remember right it was on one of their forms but I can’t find it at the moment.
---
Basically he is stating when a group of people have something they want to hate, they look high and low for an excuse to hate. As with this case with the audience, make up a bogus statement that it’s a paid audience. 
---
Haters that I see are just delusional spinning mad so I say let them have their little “tantrums”. Game will continue despite them.
---
Only during updates. This error is the PlayStation network being down though. The game is showing as up
---
It's all good man
---
if you make content harder then players would be forced to cooperate(some of them). I played Dayz and you could find people who actually work together to survive, However I would separate server. Make survival and survival permadeath
---
Odd, I got back in.
---
No you aren't stupid. A friend was trying to figure it out yesterday and he couldn't either.
---
Well the game *was * as bad as you thought, but there has been a lot of updates since then.
---
I've never heard of this being a thing in game but logically it makes sense. But maybe your trying to use too many purifiers in too little of water? Like if you have those ten all in the same little puddle maybe its simulating you drying up the bed? So maybe change a few to being ground pumps.  Idk man this is really weird and I hope you can find a fix for it. If so please share what that is
---
That’s very true I’ll admit I did give my friends random stuffs and junk characters are need because you walk SUPER SLOW  I DO NOT RECOMMEND cheating or taking duped items as it takes the fun out of fallout!
---
Just wanna share a good game experience. We split from the start and till the third ash circle we were far from each other. Only I and 1 team m8 survived, both just hiding till this point, then there was last 7 players (us included) we killed them 1 by 1, other he was taking a fire and I come from the back and kill enemy or the other way around. Dat was fun.
---
I was wondering if that was the case.
---
Nope, but good to know.  I'll keep an eye out for the actual package then.  I know I was approved for replacement!
---
Man I would love a non BR multiplayer mode
---
Back into the game?
---
As many have pointed out. We are supposed to just expect games to launch broken and barren and be fixed over several months. Why are people struggling to understand that to expect anything better out of products you pay for is clearly just entitlement culture.
---
/s
---
Thought when you are that high weight, only option is to destroy the items? No trading no dropping and no cap collection.
---
The story and lore is great in this game too, you just have to go out of your way to learn it
---
Because it was multiplayer only, and that really angered people. Bugs existed, hard to tell how common they were. It was at the least variable - I experienced one crash during the introduction cutscene, and the next crash that interrupted gameplay was close to endgame.
---
Well me and my girlfriend are absconding to New Zealand for a year to try and put off adulting as long as possible. I'm working on the you though, it fits wherever I need ot to.
---
Right on, or become a scorched.
---
Couldn't have said it better myself.
---
Apparently the nerfs were so stealth we both missed them.
---
Probably tried that and blew the power grid.
---
I made the mistake last week of "rearranging" my camp. 2 am came about surprisingly fast. only 3 hours of decent sleep, no regrets.
---
Yeah they added that and then did the ban wave
---
Yup! Lol sorry shoulda mentioned
---
Helldivers
---
This man!! Like the small field in our old vault 76 atrium. That would be sweet!
---
PC?, I'll add ya!
---
I figured it out. Go to social, invite whoever you want to play with to your team, then queue. I forgot the social menu was a thing lol
---
The link literally goes to the exact time when the hacker kills my team... maybe read the description before complaining?
---
Nope, PSN down.
---
&gt;Those games were also extremely simple compared to today and only had local multiplayer.
---
Not really.  In today's games the  worlds were bigger and graphics were better, but the gameplay elements were mostly the same.  I don't see why a bigger world with better graphics compared to older games requires developers to release an unfinished game. 
---
And multiplayer is no excuse.   Single player games with zero multiplayer features are also routinely released unfinished, requiring patches later.
---
Excellent!
---
The hate train really got out of control. I played from launch with only minor bugs, which for the release of a MMO type game is good. The point is that the hate train was so out of control that people thought the game was unreasonably bad, which was never the case.
---
It's all good. The reinstall worked. Fourth time's the charm on this occasion! Loving the game so far. Can't wait for NPCs though.
---
I hear that (I think they’re name is) Oxhorn who does a lot of fallout stuff had people try to take him down mostly because he was honest about 76 and didn’t say it was complete shit, while still pointing out flaws (not over exaggerating them)
---
Yeah it’s been bugged forever
---
The other two things mentioned in the original roadmap were "high level vault raids" and "new features", which most people suspect is the prestige system they've talked about.
---
What is it?
---
Dont base everything off the enemy level either, I can one shot a level 68 charred ghoul all day, but a level 50 sheepsquatch takes quite a few hits from my level 90 character before going down. And as someone else stated, enemy levels are affected by other players spawning into an area first, I actually got one of my best guns that way. Came across a 3* legendary ghoul that was about 40 levels higher than me at the time, spent around 10 minutes trying to kill him, and he drops an anti armor explosive hunting rifle. I still use that damn gun constantly lol
---
I think you pretty much answered it I can’t data mine but you said the reasons I would and look forward to post like these
---
 DOOOO IT, Finding time to play games is one thing. I don't even think about anything that is further then a 5 hour drive from me these days.
---
I honestly think this is a bit BS. This is absolutely blatant hacking. I have no mercy for this person. I'll link it elsewhere if blatant hackers are going to be sheltered here.
---
I spend SO MUCH TIME working on my CAMP. Honestly, pretty much the only time I leave it is to go get materials... to work on my CAMP.
---
I get genuinely excited when someone comes to visit... and *actually* explores the whole thing, as opposed to hitting the vendors and beaming out.
---
I imagine it's pretty easy to make a new account with the free trail week. Hopefully this doesn't become too rampant.
---
Yeah, been an issue since launch. I watched a fo4 video on it and it looks awesome. Add that with the jetpack and a lead champagne and I'm expecting it to do some fun damage to a group of mobbing ghouls or mole rats.
---
Gamertags are always on for teammates all the time. Even across the map.
---
Gamer tags don’t show up above players but if you hover over them (and they aren’t crouched) their HP and nameplate show up at the top of the screen.
---
So crouching I believe makes you undetectable unless actually seen.
---
Also, if you are sprinting and moving and firing, all those things cause you to be marked on the enemies’ compass and HUD (by a small red arrow) if they are close enough to see you. This doesn’t happen while crouching.
---
16x the detail over FO4
---
I think that is ninja nerfs my good friend.
---
Every negative aspect was magnified and blasted to everyone who would listen, in no small part because a multiplayer Fallout rubbed many long-time fans the wrong way. This could be seen in the disparaging comments seen before the game even came out. If the game had launched with absolutely no issues this wouldn't have been a successful smear campaign, but because there was instability and imperfections throughout, all the haters were able to overblow those flaws and the youtube wankers saw dollar signs and helped to fan those flames by expanding the reach of the negative message.
---
If there is anything to take away from this, it's to think for yourself. The opinions of randos on the internet and those that stand to gain from fads and mob mentality should not be given so much credence.
---
Nice, glad to see people doing this. Funny thing is some player is gonna think this is a real place lol and go back to a bridge
---
I’m the same can’t get on
---
Open the social menu and create a team with a friend. Then queue up for the match in the main menu. You can turn matchmaking on or off if you want to fill the team.
---
.... Thanks Sony.
---
Happening to me too
---
Have they confirmed that they're pulling it down after the trial? I figured they'd let it continue so they can gather metrics and player feedback.
---
Idk about nerfs but my rocket launcher got a stealth buff! 👍
---
The voice acting in this game is Amazing. The long form stories are touching in a way a dialogue tree can never match.
---
I hope they find a good balance between them when Wastelanders comes out.
---
It has nothing to do with sheltering, and all to do with public shaming. It’s against the reddit TOS.
---
i like this idea.  I'm now anticipating that we will all find out that the original overseer of Vault 51 is no more.. because he/she died, you know, having been surrounded by the storm with no escape.
---
Yeah, I've been stealing the Fusion Cores of PA I find and then dumping them elsewhere so they don't weigh me down.  It's too loud and clunky, and honestly the DR on it doesn't seem to do squat in NW so it's just a big freaking sign that says 'shoot me first'.  I like the idea of camping it though after getting the Fusion Cores.
---
This is what a real responder looks like.  Two thumbs up, brother.
---
You play on PC?
---
Yep! I've seen a couple lower ranked people trying to defend a workshop. If I can, I drop in, slay most of the bad guys and then leave.
---
part of me hopes they fix the bug so I can trim down my carry weight and move back to my X-01 PA.  Otherwise it's just too big of a difference having the 540 carry weight I get on Excavator vs. the 340 on X-01...  
---
Of course the hoarder in me wants the bug to never get fixed...
---
Yeah I get all my news from CNN and orange man is definitely bad!!! Reeeeeeeeee!!
---
Cannot stand it, not only the video, the comments, everything.
---
The people in a chorus like it’s a church, while in the comments people make xenophobic and racist remarks, both opposers and advocates talking to each other.
---
I bought the game day two with a small discount code ($55), bought about $50 in atoms from launch til a week or so ago, another $10 in atoms for the E3 bonus thing, and three tricentennial editions for my friends to try for a game day about a month ago (only $45 for three copies!)
---
So all in all I’ve dropped about $160 on 76. Crazy... I need to slow down!
---
If this is true, is there going to be a line of people waiting for their turn to get the "lover's embrace" buff at them like vendors?
---
Well where the frack is mine? I didn't get one.. just the original email saying my claim is accepted months ago
---
I've recently started looking to "camps" around pre-existing buildings, nooks and or what not. I enjoy sprucing up the area's!
---
The link literally goes directly to the incident. It starts 3-4 seconds after the video.
---
I did here about that. I guess I would rather them turn them off than be exploited.
---
Wanna post the interview and timestamp? I haven't seen his post e3 interview.
---
Don’t see the point of this.
---
I'm 35, and I'd say my friends' list of people from the game is evenly split between people my age and older, and people who are like, still in high school or younger, haha.
---
Should have checked there when it happened but of course I assumed the worst. You know the usual, account got hacked, game is no longer owned by my account somehow etc.
---
Empty paint cans still give 1 lead.  
---
Pencils give one lead each.  
---
Toys give between 1 (wood blocks) and 5 (toy cars) lead each.  
---
Tin cans give 1 lead and one aluminum each.  
---
Rat poison and 'hazardous material containers' give 5 lead each.  
---
Barbells and lifting weights give between 5 and 20 lead each depending on the weight.
---
yes, he absolutely was. There's always "that guy" but I only meet "that guy" about once every dozen sessions.
---
I’d actually use them for once
---
Exactly. My situation is that use the explosive perk at rank 4  and gunsmith 5, (intelligence is 9). When I jump into power armor I need to equip my batteries included perk to drop the weight of my energy ammo/ fusion cores. Due to the fact my combat armor ammo/ junk weight reductions are unequipped. Then I cannot use the demolition expert anymore. Being able to drop it down to rank 2 would be helpful.
---
Most of the community feels that way. Not me, I’ve been breaking the game since launch per Todd Howard’s request. But I am always glad they fix the exploits that get found after I tinker with them for a few days.
---
Why Is It Down
---
Exactly.... you read it.... that makes it disappear since it becomes learned.....
---
Do you support trump and the republicans?
---
Thanks for this. Couldn't log in. Then thought maybe it was PSN when my friends list didn't pop up. Came here to verify.
---
Very true.  I didn't think of that.
---
Same treatment ME:A got..initial bad reviews spread like wildfire then it was the popular thing to do to jump on and bash it
---
Always be the same. But since you have the plans just make a new one at the higher level
---
this one is even worse: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGjAuKkJsPQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGjAuKkJsPQ)
---
A Windigo is probably equal to about 6 of those super mutants - two with machine guns, two with other ranged guns, and two rushing for melee. Even at a high level they can be a pain if you're not spec'd right.
---
I'm going to live in Tanagra Town
---
You can craft them at different levels but higher level weapons require more junk/materials
---
I'm personally curious about the emote visibility to non team members.  I'm fairly certain that you can't see non team members emote, can anyone confirm they have actually seen non team members do so?
---
To add insult to injury, Bethesda apparently didn't WANT to add NPCs, but did it anyway for the fans, so even when they DO listen, they're still somehow doing something wrong
---
Bye
---
I love that theory.
---
X burx. Bought it...read and learned it.. Gone.
---
I guess they can't reveal everything at once and decided to just reveal the stuff they thought would pull the most people to come try the free week and then buy they game. Seems to be working.
---
yeah, but it was the same, even when you could attack others. I rarely had anyone "fire first'.
---
A true responder in nature!
---
Also worth noting that some weapons are level 5,15,25 etc and some are 10,20,30 etc.
---
It will always be that level but you can craft a new one that is higher level if you yourself are (e.g. 15, 25, 35, 45).
---
Perks and lore
---
No, they are not getting reversed. 
---
They increased the duration of the caution and danger, they removed sneak attack damage from enemies already engaged in combat and they made it easier for enemies to find sneaking players. I've had a sneak sniper since launch and I've been considering revamping his build due to this.
---
It just is.
---
and if it doesn't show in the Atom shop, make sure to quit the game on Console and relaunch it (don't want the missing easter egg fiasco of 2019 happening again)
---
It will show you the max level in the craft menu
---
Overpriced?
---
Seconded
---
If only this game had console cross play like Fortnite. I started on PC, went to PS4 because I had a lot of friends there, and switched to the One X when I bought it. All my content transfered between everything, and since PS4 and Xbone play together, I am loving the increased effects, resolution, and FPS.
---
I've seen some pretty cool stuff built around existing buildings. 
---
I have fun just having my ghoul character squat wherever he can find a place to drop a sleeping bag.
---
I WAS wondering about the red diamond marking! I thought someone's weapon had highlighted them.
---
They are never going to tell you that someone was banned because of privacy laws. However if they see the cheating they can pull logs, tweak their systems and ban the player.
---
It is in their financial interest to ban people that cheat so the game doesn't get a bad name.
---
It is also in their interest to analyze server side data to identify cheaters better and faster.
---
But that will never be made public.
---
I’d bet because he has no life
---
Each SPECIAL goes up to 15 max. Charisma is important for team play, intelligence is still important for modifying and equipment maintenance, and luck has scavenging and crafting bonus perks on top of the usual combat centric perks.
---
Oh so you actually did find a clip! Well as you can see it's a total partisan shitshow. I would expect bethesda to do that beofre i would have expected to see it from the government. Probably best to stay away from our politics as you were lol.
---
I never hated it, I was excited about it even though I hate having to play multiplayer, but the BETA was just kind of boring and I didn’t want to pay $60 at the time for a game that might be boring and not that fun. I figured I’d give them some time to work out the kinks and update it and I’d revisit it later. It was on sale on Amazon for $17 so I gave it a shot and it’s pretty damn fun now. I did a Wild Appalachia quest that was the kind of weird fun stuff that was missing in the BETA, and I’m happy with it now. 
---
Then I hit a bug that caused one of the main story quests to stop progressing, haha. But, oh well. I’m enjoying the other stuff and am really excited to see what other updates they push out.
---
Literally today I gave a player right out of the vault some stimpacks and a nukashine (special alcohol)
---
I can't imagine how overwhelming it must be umping into the game now, much less in 6 months when wastelanders is out. I partied up with this level 8 dude alst night so I could help him clean up his camp wiring, and the entire right side of the screen was filled with quests. 
---
He had the 2 different overseer's paths, the responders mission that takes you to Morgantown, all 3 of the poster quest lines (Biv, scouts, Squatch), and a couple others I can't recall. I commented on how it was hard to see with so many quests and he was like "yeah, I'm not sure what the fuck to even start with. It's giving me anxiety just looking at all those things *I have to do.*" Nah man, you don't *have* to do any of this, unless you want to launch a nuke, in which case you just need to follow the main quest line. 
---
He didn't realize you could toggle quest notifications on and off, so I walked him through that and deactivated everything except Biv, the main Responders quest, and the Overseer's Journey. The sigh of relief when "oh thank god" when he backed out of the pipboy was funny as hell.
---
we deserve a reward for this  :B
---
Or....y'all should just learn how Fallout 76 plays. Don't change a thing!!!!! This game is all about how much weight you can carry so you have to decide what you want to take into battle! Also, there is a Perk Card for that. Just adjust.
---
In my opinion the game was kinda crappy at first but it has gotten a lot better.
---
I've been playing since launch and the number of times I've wanted to pitch it in the trash are too numerous to mention.
---
I still play occasionally and like I said it's gotten better but there are still problems.
---
As for all the hype about nuclear winter, I don't care for br games but after reading the hype about it I thought I'd give it a try. As I expected it's fortnight wrapped up in fallout packaging. Not much different than any other br game.
---
As a huge Fallout fan even though I like 76, I'm still kind of underwhelmed.
---
How do you know they aren't??
---
I agree.
---
Wow! So many replies and so fast! 
---
Now I know what people do when they cant play fo76....they go on reddit
---
Thanks for the answers, the many, many answers lol
---
Ok, Thank You
---
Good Idea, and it makes sense, as why would the "pre-war" vending machines take CAPS instead of CASH?  (Then all that money we find is worth more than 1 cloth)
---
\+1
---
I personally like these:
---
Life Giver for extra +45 HP
---
\+40% Damage to Automatic Rifles
---
\+40% Damage to Heavy (non explosive) Weapons
---
Hacking Perk (to get a god weapon)
---
\+DR if Not Wearing Power Armor
---
\+DR per Team Member Alive
---
and can't recall the 7th card.
---
Of course your build is going to be really dependent upon your SPECIAL points available.
---
Level 80 some here, I just wander around killing. Been getting killed alot recent though.
---
I know it's anecdotal, but I played from launch and   must have been really lucky because I didn't experience any bugs that made the game barely playable. Sure there were bugs, but what online  game nowadays releases without any?
---
What's messed up is I had built a foundation, then a ramp down to a lower spot, and built some foundations down on the lower elevation, and every single foundation and the ramp all became immovable, it was like 7 pieces.
---
Thanks for the info
---
Yeah ..but I can't craft it ?
---
I understand what you're getting at..but I should be able to make them and I can't. I'm fully levelled. 😀
---
But it will not be gone forever.  I believe they are taking it down for adjustments after the trial week.
---
Because they would say ice cold drink
---
Apparently there were more than I thought, I was talking about the ones that lowered Legendary enemies, made weapons break easier, etc
---
Technically, didn't say soon. 
---
Said there will be news right before the update that includes it. That could be 5 updates from now considering 3 have already dropped since it was supposed to be released.
---
Take that comment with a grain of salt until we get more detail.
---
Try out hard events like the Imposter Sheepsquach event. There's always players going down from it.
---
Damn I wanted a cheap pc version so bad
---
Thats really funny. If that happened to me, i would get a laugh out of it for sure. Now i want to try placing a camp terminal with a spring trap so when someone tries to hack the terminal they get launched. 
---
Only one way to find out if this will work!
---
i googled it and it is not it seems several ppl said no it is not region locked
---
Problem is: Time flies so fast in this game.
---
This evening I just wanted to harvest the crops in my camp and sell a few.
---
Ended up exploring the Mothman Museum, doing the Airdrop Event at Morgantown Airport, finally planting the crops, doing the Fertile Soil event...
---
Damn, gotta go to bed...
---
Why all of these posts about people 'discovering' the game and loving it? Seems like a circlejerk
---
Nope play the game only using mele weapons while wearing the Nuke Cola Rocket girl outfit and the Nukeshine hat to make you stand out while running I to Flatwood or Sutton.
---
As opposed to siege or WWZ?
---
Thanks :D
---
Source for this? I had always assumed we'd see expanded NPCs as the story development continued which is one of the main reasons I ignores the human NPC argument when offered as criticism.
---
Just wait.
---
THANK GOD, I got so scared
---
So I’m level 301, and used to be a solo only player. I will say that I will begrudgingly admit that Tod was right it is much more fun with friends. However I still enjoy going it alone.
---
yes budget is increased, by a lot. if these were your only grievances back then you should get back into the game.
---
PlayStation is down, not fallout
---
I’m hating that there’s not many camps to visit or with any good stuff. Or that I’m getting many visitors myself. Up side is I’ve sold a lot of plans that I had to find more to fill my machine.
---
I’m guessing you’re on PS4 is a PlayStation issue
---
God dammit, i never knew about this.
---
You could use the double xp weekend to build up a fresh character for NW. I took one from 1-36 (almost all in survival) during the last double xp event.
---
Common sense answer 7 month later and its still pretty buggy.
---
Hmmm. That is odd.
---
Ah yeah, I just watched a longer video of the same guy, with even more obvious shenanigans (clipping through the world, etc.). Ugh.
---
Happening to me too. On PS4. Authentication failed comes up right?
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Hmm, very interesting. I was always thinking they were going to add more maps, and I am happy they are making urban ones! Maybe one in watoga hopefully!
---
Cool. Maybe they'll add the option to drop them from a "loot mothman". They could make them look like pinatas, and fill them with confetti.
---
Cause', that's exactly what 76 players want...
---
Ah that's what I meant to ask, so when I create one at 15 it'll be 15, then when I want one at 45 I'd just craft one and it would be 45?
---
Is it just me or is this ITV lazy af? It's just recapping what was said at E3 and not adding anything to what was already known. Come on can't we at least get a roadmap or eta on when we'll be able to play NW? 
---
Like I get that this is for people that didn't watch the Bethesda conference, but come on just give something new to chew on for the people who didn't even watch it but still knew about all the upcoming stuff.
---
I like that! Adds to the story, they missed there chance to be from vault 76 lol
---
Yeah followed by numbers
---
So, you have Marine chest armour and you cannot apply the mod?
---
Have you checked by mistake if it's not for the limbs?
---
Same.. randomly crash when on a team and trying to fast travel to camp. Verify game files didn't help.
---
I prefer the matrix breaking down and the player emerges from a reality pod like the ones from fallout 3
---
I was hoping they’d tell us when it will be back with this inside the vault
---
Hiding is extremely easy with all the bushes around in the forest
---
I kind of like these interactions. It ads excitement to my daily runs. Typically happens at whitesprings. I wish that passive was easier to toggle. For the most part tho it’s some player whacking me over and over while I spend time at the script machine trying to not sell the items I actually want. I will finish and then hop off let them get on and kill them while they’re at the machine them selfs. They seek revenge I hide in a bush and wait for them to go back and kill them again. And again and again I never take their junk tho. Mainly because junk farming is tedious and very frustrating if you loose it because you’re impatient and decide to insight some silly pvp over waiting for someone.  This usually ends with a spiteful/ hate mail saying: wow just wow. I took a workshop for some lvl 50 player the other day killed them took their junk cause to me that’s fair game and noted when you claim a work shop. They spammed me with hate mail saying that : you high level players have no honor!!  I didn’t even reply they came at me with emotes. I did the puking one and the downed/panic emote and just laughed with my buddy.
---
Remember it’s fair game. Try to take it back you will most likely loose again or who knows maybe you’ll be able to take it back and then I’ll be the one who feels stupid for trying to take it.
---
Nope this might be a battle royal game but it’s a fallout game first needs to keep pip boy. If everyone is disadvantaged by it it’s not a disadvantage.
---
Loot is perfect because weapons and armor are extremely balanced you can win with a pipe rifle as long as you and your team are good at the game mode
---
They're not quite companions, but it sounds like they may be duty officers (people you can send out on missions).
---
I still want an NPC with me in classic Fallout sense, but I LOVE duty officer stuff. I just really want that SWTOR feel in 76 where it's a team of two NPCs, my husband, and me.
---
Make sure to insert circle jerk over New Vegas even though it took awhile to fix their buggy launch.
---
Amazing when I saw your hours had to reply all my friends work nights so it’s a never ending I can’t play loop
---
Red diamond is NPC enemies. Mirelurks, ghouls, etc.
---
Downward pointing red triangle is an enemy player who has been “detected” by being close to you and moving/shooting
---
Protip: If you get disconnected from a great server, or in this case a sought after vendor, do NOT press play to try to find it again. Instead use the social tab, recents, and click on everyone to View Their Profile - chances are pretty good someone has their settings so that anyone can join them... just have to go down the list 🙂
---
Note - XB1, but seeing as it uses the games interface it should work on any platform.
---
I started playing about a month ago. That Breach and Clear event is blowing through my acid. I don't think I could handle this mine.
---
Alright, but as someone that bought it, then gave up on it due to bugs and it feeling meh during the beta, then started over this week, the jumping around in the vault was a real bad way for that to start, and I barely made it out without shelving it again.
---
Bethesda needs to read this one\~
---
I’ll test with my wife, see if we can get in a game and mess about with it
---
I only play adventure and I give stuff away constantly. At level 165 I’ve maxed out basically everything and have every weapon and armor piece I need for my optimal build. I still have 23k caps and 695lbs in my stash and I just farm events and end game bosses and clear our stuff I don’t use in favor of stacking more of the things I do use. I have nothing left to spend caps on other than recipes that I would just craft and  sell in my machines for more caps I still won’t use. Just last night I found a streamer who was giving 76 a chance so I dropped a 3* super sledge and a bunch of chems and food then had him sell me a can of dog food for 1500 so I could go wipe out the vendor caps pool for the day
---
I haven't either luckily, and I'm pretty sure its mostly contained on PC (old, easily modded engine adapted to multiplayer, potential backdoors etc). But I've been leveling up a new character in adventure on PS4 so my exposure is limited.
---
I've just come off twitch watching a guy on it .
---
If it's unlocked at a workshop and you take from it, will you become PvP flagged?
---
Got back to normal until NW is actually released.
---
You have to be specific, because whenever they change anything, whatever group is effects is very... vocal, about the changes. Which is understandable, because it is frustrating if you've invest X hours in a build, even if in a calmer moment you might go, "Well, yeah, maybe I shouldn't be able to one-shot everything except the Queen." But it is always hard to tell how many people this actually effects, or whether people are just really vocal about it, a la the issue with Fortnite from [a couple weeks ago](https://kotaku.com/epic-removed-a-popular-fortnite-mechanic-because-it-mad-1834343157).
---
Anyway! I don't think there was a rollback on this, but I also run with White Knight and Gunsmith. I usually don't have to repair unless I've done a silo run and spent a good amount of time in a nuke zone. If you also use the repair perks that buff your equipment's condition to 200 percent, it really isn't an issue. Especially since there are now repair kits too, which don't require any resources to use.
---
What would happen if none of the players in a match killed each other, and just ran to the safe zone?
---
I was watching the guys that killed me yesterday, and it seemed they got down to the last 2 squads, but started using the heart emote at each other and never killed each other until the game ended -- so who wins??
---
It was pretty broken at launch but it's amazing now.
---
I really enjoy the statistics, big yes to this idea.
---
Looks like Babylon is their code for Nuclear Winter.
---
if you’re on Xbox feel free to hit me up if you need back up
---
PlayStation users are the most fragile of players. They tend to get onery when they cannot play their shoot games and are only placated when Sony Corporate makes fun of the competition.
---
Nice try, Bethesda
---
I can see now how terribly misunderstood you are, through no fault of your own.
---
The problem truly is everyone else.
---
No one cares like you do.
---
The monsters.
---
If only they'd taken the time to read your comment history to see all of the good faith arguments you've made.  The tickets you've submitted.  The sleepless nights you've spent thinking about how you could possibly save fallout 76 and bethesda from their current trajectory.
---
You are too good for this world.  
---
We don't deserve you.
---
Fight on, brave prince.
---
But you know PSN is down, right? That’s probably what’s going on with your account.
---
Up vote! Up vote! Up vote!
---
Also let me actually use the apparel I purchased in NW.
---
Meaning, tactical suit.
---
I named my All Rise John Henry
---
This is fantastic.  Thank you.  (I'm lvl 226, and 164 on my alt, so I've been around the block a little)
---
[This is what I usually do](https://imgur.com/Heyg8Nk).  Not ideal, but it works.
---
Judging by your flair I think you may be biased
---
Yeah that’s totally what I’m saying
---
I’d like to be able to favorite players without friending them.
---
I thought they had just bodged the sneak system entirely? Sometimes it works as I would expect, other times a mutant can see me through 3-4 walls and put me in \[DANGER\] for no bloody reason at all.
---
Yes please, they are overlooked because the prices are ridiculous, and pre war cash is in great abundance, it also doesn’t make sense that they use caps.
---
How is that an advantage? You can literally go make your own blueprints in adventure mode.
---
Basically it seems like they're going No Man Skying it not Anthem it (fingers crossed).
---
Ok but seriously though if we're going to have BR maps of areas like harpers ferry or morgantown we should start letting them know just how unoptimised those areas are.
---
I'm on a gtx 1080, 16gb ram and an i7-7700k and morgantown drops frames like crazy. Harpers ferry is even worse.
---
We need some more optimisation updates please
---
You can
---
It was a joke. The guy I was responding to said "t series," in reference to the T-45, T-51, and T-60 power armors. So, I made a joke about PewDiePie.
---
6 weeks of Reddit posts complaining that it’s gone
---
If you're on ps4, Sony is having a seizure rn. Lots of stuff isn't working
---
You can do it too, you know. Pop into Adventure, build your CAMP fort, blueprint it, and enjoy confusing the people who don't want to bother dealing with CAMPs
---
Honestly what i gather from NW is that the team can do balance right. Every person will want some tweaks here and there but it's in a good state already.
---
Hope this mentality will carry on to all modes, not the same as NW but the general idea of how make underwhelming weapons work.
---
Great job, you broke it.
---
I just don't get this. If I'm impatient waiting for you at a vendor, I'll just go to another one or hop servers or, you know... wait my turn.  With the 1400 cap limit, it takes time for me to unload everything. I've resorted to unloading the current tab I'm on and then letting someone else have a turn if I hear someone come in because every time they do, 5 seconds later I'm getting attacked or pestered. I shouldn't have to do that. I'm camped near Whitesprings and that vendor brings the worst people in. I'm considering moving my camp so I can peacefully unload my junk.
---
Getting this same error, did you ever find a solution?
---
Probably ddos attack for Sony not being at e3 or some crap.
---
Im an xbox user also? Lol people on reddit are so testy.. Maybe from lack of having any lol
---
&gt; Duplicate cards artificially extend this grinding ~~by an insane amount~~ nearly infinitely.
---
Great feedback, thank you!
---
I was really surprised how well the game translated to BR. It really is a condensed experience of the full game, without all the farming and end game content. When you strip it down and there’s still great mechanics and infinite replay ability, you know you have a great game
---
Psn is currently down.
---
Sony is experiencing an mild seizure because they finally realized they've been fucking over their player base with the asset protection
---
Thanks for the reply! Sadly, i figured that much, was just wondering if anyone seen a date or timeline.
---
Been here since day one :)
---
What are you even talking about, this sub has been full of criticism. Especially few weeks after the release people were pretty critical about this game here. Why do you think Filthy Casuals sub exists in the first place? It's because of this sub. 
---
However that criticism was actually constructive, unlike on r/fallout and their "FALLOUT 76 BAD GIMME UPVOTES". 
---
And now, people are just happy this game is finally getting better so it makes sense people here are positive.
---
Actually this sub is something between Filthy Casuals sub (that's always positive and there's nothing wrong with that) and r/fallout with their hate boner.
---
Yup, exactly what I had. It's bullshit. I've submitted a ticket ages ago. Can you do the same? The more of us make Bethesda aware, the higher on the list the issue will sit.
---
Fun, isn't it?
---
I participated in the ESO beta (someone gave me a code for the last weekend), thought it was buggy and unbalanced and not worth the initial price and subscription. 
---
Fast forward to now, it's on sale for ten bucks, so I said what the hell.
---
Holy shit what a difference five years makes.
---
This game I've been with since release and in that short time, it's come a long way.  Well worth the investment.  Although ESO has captured my attention for the time being, this one is still on my drive and I'll still play it.
---
I feel like I'm being cheated out of extra caps and xp  because I don't like BR games. I don't think they should carry over to adventure.
---
You mean you and your squad don’t unload clip after clip into the last person’s corpse?
---
Before I hooked up with the people I play with now I only played with my best friend. Then I meet the people both me and he now play with. One of there group recognized my tag as something associated with me. I realized he was trying to get my attention but I was ignoring him until he called me out in the area chat. That in it self was kind of funny. But it’s just the interactions. There are a lot of shit people out there but sometimes things just happen and they work.
---
After the free week is over this beta preview is over.
---
I've played since the closed beta, and I've never hated the game, even with all the bugs that plagued it at launch, though I am a simple guy. I can spend ages in games with base building, though there's still a lot of placement problems in f76. But in the beginning, people's expectations were a bit high, resulting a big let down partly by Bethesda's deceitful marketing and promises (kind of like No Mans Sky), and the no npc's deal causing the a lack of a flushed out story set people off. With most games now a days, people hate just to hate without true experience or reason. However, players were denied refunds, with the game going on sale soon after launch even, got people fired up even more. While not affecting game itself, players also were cheated out with some special edition duffle bag that was quickly replaced a cheap trashy bag and offered  $5 worht of atoms as componasion, which isnt much of anything. Bethesda lying, cheating, false promises, selling slins from previous games, and more ruined launch. But I still enjoyed the game for whay it was, and still enjoy it. Definitely hope for the future of the game.
---
Nothing yet as far as I know.
---
I think the early levels are especially punishing on solo players but after lvl 30 or so it becomes a lot easier. To echo, it is not required for enjoyment but i think it is more fun with a group of friends
---
Fucking rip paragon man I miss it so much
---
Haha ill probably internalize the complaint but ill definitely sympathize with them
---
Maybe, but it looks as if ZAX analyzed Brauns research to best mimic him so the prototype armor would be sent to the vault. Similar to how in the Whitesprings you find a log of John Henry Eden and MODUS, in which JHE is analyzing presidential data so he can replicate them to make it seem like he's president.
---
I'm glad I was finally able to understand your amazing brain.  
---
It puts the rest of us to shame.
---
Thanks for giving the rest of us something to aspire to.
---
That. Ultra light is a mod not a built piece like the heavy combat armor.
---
I definitely can’t wear the tac suit in NW.  There’s no option to favorite it or anything.
---
Get a jerk on your team and it ruins both of those games too, let alone be the random joining a queued party of 3.  It's my understanding that neither of those games have a royale mode either, correct?  In a royale mode this is more common, because you can assume your enemies may be compromised as well.  In balanced matches if you kill a teammate you are guaranteed a man down, a 3v4 fight.
---
It wasn't even that bad at start.  Low levels are hard until you get the Perks needed for survival and establish yourself.
---
Materials - if you can pick it up... pick it up 😉 Best way starting out in my opinion.
---
Flat land - good luck on that one... there's maybe a handful of spots besides Whitesprings Golf Course, or a road.
---
I would personally suggest waiting a bit to expect making a mini town though, you won't have many plans needed being the main part (unless you've got a high level camp building friend 😁
---
Same thing for me can't log into the game !
---
Your pretentiousness is a wonderful counter argument
---
Not sure for this one, but it most other BRs the circle will eventually collapse altogether, and it’ll come down to whoever was the last to die to it.
---
[In his own words.](https://pay.reddit.com/r/Mordhau/comments/byd5a8/turned_the_community_around_in_one_simple_update/eqklyzz/)
---
I would support them taking pre-war money for stuff, because honestly, after I first found them and looked at the prices I've never looked at them again and won't.
---
Hahaha well there is that, or the gratituous corpse hump. You're right, I guess there are a number if options here presently in game.
---
Why is it that people can't just make a post saying that they are happy the game has been improved and are enjoying themselves? You don't need to apologize or blame those who have been negative because the game was released in a terrible state and Bethesda just kept feeding the hate train with dumb decisions/mistakes. They are a hugely successful company that makes loads of money off of their products. They already should have known better or at least paid people who did know better to help them make a game that isn't broken at launch.
---
What I am really trying to say is that you should enjoy yourself, but don't let a profit driven corporation off the hook because they absolutely will pull the same BS again if enough fans keep sending the message that it is OK to ship a bad product and then fix it later.
---
I hope someone golds you for this, i would but like, money. Its not the dev team, it was the publisher, but everyone needs to understand that, the game could have been perfectly fine, and it broke down release day with all of the people logging on. I have been saying that to see the game get better and fixed, people need to let up on BGS. I want to see this game suceed and grow, not fail and die.
---
 Gotta try to sound smarter than you are lol
---
Can you craft it? The hat I bought from the atom store needed to be made at a crafting bench first.
---
I've played Arma 3 BR, KOTK, PUBG, Fortnite, Apex, etc.
---
Nuclear Winter has the most time consuming inventory of them all.  Time consuming inventory means death in BR games.
---
My buddy asks for ammo.........I've got to open the pip boy, click on the tabs at the top, scroll past 5 other tabs, get to the ammo tab, select the ammo, and hit dump.
---
All other battle royale games........open inventory, select item, dump all OR select quantity to dump.  It's just as easy to equip guns, change armor, use meds, etc.
---
It's so much faster.  They really need to change it.
---
It failed
---
I got the frog legs perk so I just jump up high so no one can touch me
---
That’s really, really dumb to do.
---
This is a free week, and there’s probably a pile of people buying the game because they’re enjoying NW specifically.  Removing it is going to cause a *lot* of salt.
---
They should leave it in and just, you know, adjust it as needed.
---
that would be an epic win screen
---
1. It's better for exploring since you can read notes and terminals at your own pace. You can also pick up a fully maxed lone wanderer card for 4 points in CHA.
---
2. Fast travel back to Vault 76, your camps, and your workshops, are free. You can get a perk to reduce FT cost by 30%. Also, perks such as Pharma Pharma and Scrounger are not passive, the game prompts you to trigger them upon searching the appropriate container.
---
3. I built a camp way out in the woods and I saw the Flatwoods Monster staring at me from the treeline before disappearing. Haven't seen him since. Additionally, I bought Nukashine from player-run bar, got blackout drunk, and ended up on a tightrope in the mountains.
---
So I had the game for about 5 days now. Tweetdel1 is my name (I need friends) and I’ve encountered only one bug. But that wasn’t game breaking. A scorched was in a rock but he came out real quick. I also bought elder max sons coat and the tric. Edition. I wish the game had some settings to turn off god rays because they lag on my computer but when I turn lighting settings down it’s all pixelated. Reverted my expectations to the good so far. Todd was right. I was wondering how good the game was
---
This. I got the same EXACT DUPLICATE 4 TIMES IN A ROW.  
---
Also, I'm forced to do Sniper build, because that's the cards I got; instead of a Commando build, which is more my playstyle.
---
Alright, I will keep this in mind. Thank you!
---
NW I had a lot more dlc in it. The BR Mode was just one of them. It’s supposed to include vault raids among other things... as much as I hate to say this I got it from a juice head video....
---
Yeah, the bugs were pretty bad but I managed to stick it out. Exploring west Virgina with my buddies has been a blast. We’re kind of all stuck in the end game loop trying to grind for nuclear flux and legendary hunt so we stopped playing for a bit. But as much as others hated it. I’ve loved my time with 76. I think I just hit 200 hours. It’s really a shame PVP vending didn’t exist or that you could just sell all the stuff you wanted to at a single vendor back when my C.A.M.P. Was massively glitched. And every time I logged in: it basically just kept duplicating what ever you had that wasn’t on a foundation. It took me a good month and a half to break down all the corn I had in my stash. I was sitting on 5086 corn at one point cause it kept duplicating anytime we’d change servers. I may have not had a stash for that month and change but I had enough corn soup. that I could have fed all of West Virginia. Which I totally did do multiple of times. If I saw a newb player. I’d fast travel to him and drop 300 corn for him and his crew and 500 wood. lol. But only after I made sure to max out on all my caps at the different vacation vendors. But if any of ya’ll are playing on PS4. Shoot me a DM and let’s give back to some of these newbies joining us in the wastelands.
---
I’ve been playing since launch, and I’m loving seeing all the low levels around. I’ve been helping with a lot of the quests I did a long time ago, and even bought 1 .38 round for 1000 caps to give a guy a boost so he could get something at a player vending machine and still have some caps left.
---
What’s great, is at least in my experience with the free trial players so far, is the toxic people that just hate the game seem to be staying away.
---
If we can get a bigger player base without them then the game just improved immensely, even though I don’t consider myself a direct benefactor (yet!).
---
It’s nice to see all of the positive feedback after months of posts trashing the game.
---
Hopefully a bunch of people stick around!
---
I understand what your talking about. I was more apologising to the players who I didn't believe but I should have made it more obvious.
---
True.  If you just started out then getting lead from weights at the firehouse, motel, etc. is definitely the better way to go.   Plus, you really aren’t using that much ammo. 
---
FYI:   Hemlock Holes workshop has three acid deposits.  So if you need acid at any point, it’s worth taking even for a short while.  
---
At least now you know how to find lots of lead when you do finally get into the big guns...   .grin.
---
Which plan are those pots from?
---
 You’re the most dramatic fool around
---
That would be pretty good too
---
So let's lock the FOV to 45 degrees.  Everyone is disadvantaged equally so it's ok?  That's such a weak argument.
---
BR is supposed to be loot fast, move fast, shoot fast, share items fast.  There's no reason they can't have a traditional Battle Royale inventory UI.
---
There's a reason ALL of the other games use quicker / easier UI...........because it works and it's what BR players are used to.
---
Tru7h. This is Beth's home, not Sony's (or is it sonies?🤔)
---
My parents were very proud when I was accepted at the local university to major in the field of scatology with a minor in obscenity-ology.
---
My friend that I queue with is a Melee build; yet in NW, melee is drastically underpowered and he can't have any ranged because his PER is so low. Our other friend is drastically better, and he made a character during the Free Weekend.
---
Thanks... I was wondering if there was a perk or something that would help me only grab what I need instead of aimlessly grabbing everything at first. This was also a thing in FO4 right?
---
* I enjoy story questing alone. I like to read terminals and listen to holotapes and take my time. That's not much fun for the other guy.
---
* I enjoy doing random shit in a group of friends, or, *their* quests because they need help, or just arent a completionist OCD person like me.
---
both are fun.
---
I'm actually into this idea.  I've been playing for at least a couple hours almost every day since the first BETA Thursday, and I've maybe bought some 5.56 ammo once or twice from those ammo machines.  It's way easier to just make your own ammo at a tinker's bench, especially with ammosmith and super duper cards.
---
Yeah and you could also level up in adventure mode to improve your play in NW. I personally love how the two are connected story wise and with the mechanics as well.
---
-People who like it don't deserve to earn anything out of it, because there are people who exist that don't like it
---
I suppose you also feel player vending shouldn't give caps because you don't like being a vendor?
---
Thanks for the tips! I'm excited, this game sounds pretty great
---
I thought you were going to be talking about the vending machines in NW, which do literally nothing. Why even leave them there!
---
There are some great game mode ideas in this thread. Hopefully we get to see some of them. 
---
Like each 4 player squad are different wasteland creatures/people. Squad of super mutants, squad of scorched, ghouls, raiders, vault dwellers, scorch beasts, molerats, mr gutsys, deathclaws, etc. etc. Each would have their own strengths and weaknesses. 
---
I would like to play in a squad of Sheepsquatch Imposters. Lol.
---
Just tried to find it ... it's not listed. Sold out already?
---
Ghouls are not dead people nor zombies, they are highly irradiated persons, that went crazy.
---
At no point did I claim to be better than anyone or act dramatic about anything. Arguing a point went over your head I guess.
---
I have an issue here or there, but its not and never was unplayable for me either.
---
Cheater peater.
---
They dont have to. They really dont. They can just never unban you at all. It's their game.
---
Can ypu leave a insult in a brown paper bag outside the door of their C.A.M.P.
---
You type like a brit, don't you go to jail now for offending people online? You better be careful chap, cheerio!
---
Yeah, I totally agree.
---
Half the time I'm carrying around ammo I don't have a gun for............and my friends could really USE that ammo..........but it takes so long to get to that part of the pip boy and drop it..........it's almost not worth it.  In fact unless they're out of ALL ammo or I am...........we don't even ask eachother for ammo.
---
The worst was the guy screaming thinking Bethesda was doing great at E3. Those were paid actors in my book.
---
The fallout 5 bit is the true true. Vocal minority/influencers that wanted the game they wanted rather then listening to the E3 presentation last year lol. People are silly lol
---
Holy shit I hope Bethesda sees this lol it would also give people something to do when that die and are waiting for their friends to die or win lol.
---
&gt; The Pip Boy is great for Adventure or even Survival mode
---
No it isn't. The pipboy is an awful UI and has been for a looong time, i hope whatever the next version of FO is uses a drastically improved system.
---
I’m almost certain there will be a vault 51 dungeon. 
---
Datamined files from a few weeks ago had audio files from a vault dweller who escaped from 51. There was also a datamined “To Do” list that ended with “Kill Z.A.X.”
---
Considering you don’t kill Zax in NW, and there’s a ton of lore to find inside the Vault 51 lobby, I’m betting we’ll see it as a location in adventure as well.
---
I don't think he's talking about that. If you were around Fallout 76 on release, you would remember Youtubers especially were literally farming views on Fallout 76 hate train with their clickbait titles that were lies most of the time. On r/games and r/fallout, people were farming karma with literally only saying "Fallout 76 bad". I remember posts with few words in it and hundreds of upvotes. Saying you enjoy Fallout 76 there (that doesn't mean you can't admit mistakes) would get you basically dozens of downvotes without a single answer. 
---
That's the hate train he's talking about.
---
 You know you look bad and it’s upsetting you 😂
---
I imagine the full release with incorporate the full map and different sections a long with other changes. I wouldn’t stress out about burning out.
---
This is probably it.  All apparel from the store can be made as much as you want, but cannot be traded or sold to other players.  It's only 5 cloth at an armor workbench, so go crazy.
---
If it's something else, then disregard this and please elaborate.  Can you use it in NW? Can you use it outside of NW? etc.  I haven't tried NW yet myself, so I'm not wholly clear on all the restrictions and quirks it has.
---
Also, everyone was mad at Todd for “lying” but I honestly don’t know what exactly he lied about. It’s not his fault everyone’s expectations were way too high
---
&gt; Nuclear Winter has the most time consuming inventory of them all. Time consuming inventory means death in BR games.
---
Clearly you haven't played Firestorm
---
Not saying NW is good, its not, it's really bad - but it's no where near as bad as Firestorms is
---
I’m calm but ok
---
Biggest downside is that you’re a giant beacon for any enemy fire.
---
That may be why they wanted to take him down by pulling every bad thing from his history. Im not going to much detail, but i dont think something stupid you said 10 or more years ago should mess with what you do today, people change.
---
Yep. It reached the point where people would claim it was crap, then refer you to a Youtube video they watched as evidence.
---
The game had its issues on launch, and still does! But MMOs always have problems, even the ones who have been in the industry for over a decade have issues with every patch. The point is, don't jump on the hate train just because a Youtube video you watched said it was bad... Second-hand information (and 3rd, 4th, 5th in this case) is so incredibly useless and toxic.
---
Whatever happened to the "Legendary Player" prestige mechanic they mentioned way back when?  Is that still in the works?
---
It’s random.
---
Same guy in my game, probably same game.
---
Good content gets good coverage, right? I've liked the last few patches, and it feels like they set the stage well for some cool new content.
---
 I’m here to mock you as long as you claim things that are actually false yes
---
At least we'll always have [this](https://youtu.be/3OCJCZJWA68).
---
Maaaan, the fact that I'll never get to play Steel again makes me so sad.
---
Thanks for the acid tip. I definitely need some!
---
That’s creepy
---
As someone who will try it today, is there any way to have "private" pr "invite only" play ?
---
I have no interest beeing camped by someone who already maxed out thier toon
---
Same reason people call victims of school shootings trauma actors. People love to hate, and even more like to think they’ve figured out something that no one else has.
---
Stupid argument.
---
Does Fallout need a pipboy as the UI? Yeah, it's a pillar of the franchise identity. 
---
Does Fallout need a shitty pipboy UI though? No. Just because it has one doesn't mean the one it has is good and shouldn't be improved.
---
New Atomic Shop item: *libtard* (price: 0 atoms)
---
*libtard* **(OWNED)** 😎
---
Bethesda’s support site.
---
Wild Appalachia had a week by week update schedule
---
I don't really see what this would add.
---
But this isn’t made for br players it’s made for fallout players, who are mainly older men who play a few game titles and don’t want to change the UI. 
---
The main argument isnt the disadvantage it’s the fact this is a fallout game, not a br game get used to the interface it’s not horrible
---
I found meele weapons to be good for taking them down. I went on just know and on my own I withered it down to half health with something I got from a quest.
---
What? No how would I? You truly speak nonsense sir!
---
It can be difficult to find flat areas, but the road to Flatwoods, or around Morgantown, are petty good.
---
I've had more mobs on screen than that and no issues, think you just got unlucky.
---
Does it also count for when I am level 50 or will the level locks still apply how they used to?
---
I have noticed a lot less vendors too, but also a lot more newbies that just aren't high enough to set up vendors. Population has looked solid, but the crowd got younger.
---
But then how can I go around punching people?? 
---
Jk, I like your ideas and I hope they implement them in some way!
---
Wait, so you’ll have to buy it, then go into adventure/survival and craft it, then go into NW with it?
---
That doesn’t make sense.  I picked up the E3 pack and the Elder’s coat it provides is available immediately.  Same with the Vault 51 jumpsuit when unlocked, and most of the paints I’ve unlocked.
---
I think he means that you can't use under armor in NW. You can only use costumes such as nuka girl
---
That workshop near flatwoods (the foodplant) has a junk node and an aliminum node.  Good source for both, even if the junk is random.
---
Assuming you don't get disconnected a lot.
---
I have played upwards of 100 hours and i have never had a disconnection bug (and since the beta). The bug could be a very specific one which only affects a handful of people now. Thre's no quick and easy fix is my point.
---
I'm not completely new but I'd appreciate a good ol' helping hand!
---
I use an LG Ultrawide just fine. Borderless Window
---
Oh you know, itd just be really nice for them.
---
Sounds like you’re just insecure about yourself
---
It would mainly help with what you want to wear in nuclear winter, but its mainly just a quality of life feature
---
I've only seen T-45 and T-51b so far.
---
Huh. Sounds like between this and Team Medic, it's easy to use up 15 Charisma. Thanks for sharing!
---
Don't know how bad it was at launch but it doesn't deserve harsh criticism.
---
So you can easily sort through the things you already own.
---
I can see why. It might be a bit unfair to just kill people when they are about to get into power armor
---
Just because you didn’t experience any bugs doesn’t mean everybody else didn’t. I’m glad the game was fun for you but it was horrible for a good majority of the community
---
No I just now fully realize what you are
---
It’s something wrong with you, mister?
---
Yes! It would be way easier to sort through my outfits and stuff during NW.
---
Its probably due to the fact it's a new component to the game, due to the extra code that it has to go through from the favorite wheel to pipboy then to camp and then specifically showing only quick build plans without showing other camp stuff and making it so it doesn't need a camp to be placed
---
Due to all those extra steps it's taking its probably causing that lag spike (I'm just guessing on its process but I bet its probably similar)
---
Port-a-fort haha that is perfect.
---
&gt; Currently Fo76 is having meta score of 2.8, while Anthem has 5.1.
---
I agree and I only played the demo of FO76. I own it, just haven't played it because of the state it is in. Having said that, I plan on coming back to it because it looks like loads of fun now that a lot of the annoying things have been worked out. 
---
I played Anthem the day of launch, I really, really, enjoyed the game. However, the lack of content and lame loot really kills the game. There's nothing to do, maybe out of 10 legendaries you get 1 decent one, so it's also not rewarding to play. What it does get right is the environment and gameplay mechanics. It's a fun game with nothing to do and no rewards once you get outfitted with several legendaries. There's other issues, like insanely priced cosmetics and literally not javelin customization, but overall it's a good beta of a game. Just waiting for the rest of the finished game to drop. Which who knows when that will be. They really need to make the game fun by adding new different missions, story, and a better loot system.
---
Yea it sucks but this time at least Bethesda can’t be blamed
---
I just use the SB as an indicator to where the last team is ( if it didn’t Agro my team of course)
---
You get the best outfit from camden park :)
---
Well, stop wanting that or go elsewhere for it. What kind of asshole walks into a circle jerk and shouts "wow stop beating each other off, I think that's gross"? Of  course you're gonna piss everyone off.
---
Thanks! That sounds... okay, at least. Stimpaks seems hard to find.
---
are you calling me a libtard or making a bad joke?
---
If both last people die at the same time it is a Stalemate, otherwise the last one to die from the storm wins.
---
But the ui isn’t that bad all your stuff is separated and you can use it fast, where as br games usually everything is just clumped together having to sort thru stimpacks drugs armor and a bunch of ammo just to find a weapon I want to drop is way worse than just hitting LB or RB until I find my category.
---
This also coming from a console player not a pc player
---
Just two so far. Another post mentioned the next one is our Friday/Saturday, and the last is available Sunday/Monday
---
Welcome, I'm sure you'll enjoy the game. A lot of the hate comes from people unable to form their own opinion and only follow what some youtubers say.
---
No tips for you other than take your time with the game and delve as deep into it as you want, don't feel rushed. :)
---
You're forgetting that this gamemode is generally unfair (my own experience) where hitreg occasionally takes a vacation, my own team dies a few minutes into the match, and winning is generally impossible or like trying to take a picture of a black hole.
---
I like the idea but I also like it how it is.
---
Can a mod in fallout 76 fix this?
---
Just hope they didn’t get hacked again. This is taking too long lol
---
Yeah, you are a Whiner, next.
---
Sonys would be the plural of Sony (because it's a proper noun). The possessive is Sony's, you had it right ;)
---
Get proof, get his name in the video while spectating as him.  Post it.  Let the ban wave come!
---
I have a couple alts. Grind to level 50. What direction where you thinking of setting up you character?
---
 They typically have a blog post of the Atom shop schedule every week. https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6lu7jIlXd5clSzKJ23Inza/atomic-shop-patch-10-items-and-sales
---
I suppose a Charisma build would already be well incentived to keep their teammates alive. Thank you!
---
I’m a solo player (sniper and heavy weapons guy characters) and I’ve found to be able to handle most things well with the exception of the story end event (it alerts the server as there is no way to reasonably do it solo) as well as this one event in the ash heap hat also has a server message and finally the project paradise event as you can only be so many places as a single player
---
I get where you're coming from, but I feel like that's the risk you're taking to get some of the best armor in the mode. Just doesn't seem to fit in with BR
---
1 every OTHER day.
---
Wow. Couldn’t handle a double major, eh? ;)
---
I’m downloading the game now. Be on when I get off. Psn:Alternader
---
Do lucky hole mine with a set of excavator armor. Bout 1500 lead scraps with super duper perk when it’s all said and done. 
---
Then put on ammosmith with super duper and get way more ammo.
---
YouTube some ammo videos. If you take your Excavator Armor down to Hornwright testing site #3 you can mine lead and steel ore by the boat load. Then you're only bottleneck is acid. That's why my camp sits on an acid node.
---
There is an event in the mire call irrational fear. You kill 6-7 honey bee queen things. You’ll net a lot.
---
Yep then when the area was empty a lvl 100+ spawned in.. I wish the game was either scaled to your level like eso or atleast have each zone with their own set lvl that isn't affected by players.
---
The only good thing I can see about this is you never know what is going to happen.
---
Ye, the game itself really wan’t that bad, it does feels like fallout( with all it’s bugs and creative engine duh) but what pushed me of the game is the god damned Bethesda launcher where after I launched the game a few times and the game was broken that I literally had to reinstall or wait for an update, but I had patience at the time, and this happened 3-4 times, in the end, it was broken again so I never came back.
---
Yeah, like I said; some of the reasons were more more valid than others.  Todd went out as a hype man and hyped up the game.  people extrapolated from that to take the hype to sky-high levels that not even the second coming of christ could meet (more hyperbole there).
---
They should put it in rice!
---
But like i said i didnt praise Bethesda at the start. I am giving them the benefit of the doubt because they are actively trying to fix their mistakes. There's a difference. Giving them more shit for trying to do the right thing is stupid though. You want them to fix the game and add more stuff, make it more stable but then you keep throwing the bad launch back and saying "it should have been better"  yes we all know it should have been better, it wasnt though and repeating old stuff which has mostly been sorted doesn't help anything.
---
yes it's a place to see what has been purchased and what hasn't been so you can easily see what you have already purchased
---
last night we had like a half dozen video on cheaters in NW, and people were asking why there no gain? add atoms as a prize and there gain. right now the cheaters are just ass holes and are rare. give a gain and there become more common. at least until Bethesda get a handle on that issues I have to say don't make atom a reword.
---
No neither are BR but I just never understood forced friendly fire games. Well it's funny because I play WWZ and Siege alot.. at the cost of the occasional griefer.
---
Full map no, a map for each region yes.
---
Not sure what the wiki says but have you tried the event in the Mire called 'Irrational Fear'? it always spawns at least 3 honey beasts. Its located just underneath the Thunder Mountain power plant.
---
I am level 17. Does that count. LoL
---
Love these stories. 
---
Similar story.. but not really. I was at the Whitesprings rail vendor. Selling off my daily Halloween crafts. As I was getting punched by a lvl 150 in PA. I disengaged the vendor, And then I ( a lvl 76 non PA user) proceeded to pull out a TSE Dragon. And hit him for 6k damage, and continued to sell my witch hats
---
Figured it out. You are correct that i needed to favorite the hat.
---
Can you tell me how to do it ? Not by my pc right now and i'm sure i will forget about this later after i sleep lol
---
What does Obisidan have to do with 76 at all?
---
did that make sense to you when you typed it?
---
You should've tried posting this at r/Fallout. Despite the fact that the aforementioned subreddit is an anti-76 echo chamber, you could've... tried. I guess?
---
Exploit !
---
They don't care
---
Do these people get paid to post this crap just like they pay the crowd to cheer for everything they introduce at E3?? Don’t believe one bit guys. Game is still a buggy mess, even with friends. FO4 bugs were funny, FO76 bugs are infuriating.
---
I'm starting to get suspicious that may have been the case, it's been down for like 3 and a half hours now, not normal
---
I think its like $17 on Amazon for all platforms. Maybe cheaper if ya look around. Can't imagine that is too much?
---
I enjoyed it for a while, not a bad game. Bugs were numerous, and affected me and many others quite a bit. Honestly as a game it’s fine, not great. Watch the video by internet historian to understand the hate towards the developers in general.
---
Do the bundles reduce the weight or what ?
---
Ok I’ll add you when I get home. Accept the request and send me a message once you’re out of the vault, I’ll hook you up
---
Nope. Only if you pick the lock.
---
Try it for your self and see. It’s still on a trial. And you get discount if you purchase.
---
Well in the uk cinema tickes are 12 quid then anything else is extra. $7-8 is about a fiver what do you get under 16 student rates
---
Just tried, still can’t login 🤮
---
To add, as a vet, we’ve explored flatwoods now we’re battling there; as a noob, you’ve battled there now you can explore. 2 different experiences within same map. Its well done imo
---
Sure!
---
Don’t be a salty baby. Just git gud.
---
I want powerful players in there, there is balancing and fixing to do, but I like how powerful people are.
---
It’s like every MMO you play, you see the elite end-game players and can’t compete but you want to be like them one day.
---
Tell him to ask seventeen different people for a dollar (maybe 20 for tax). Boom, then he can get it.
---
I had it happen too. I was shooting them as they were entering and their health went down to about 10%. After a couple seconds their health went all the way back up and his teammate killed me.
---
We're still waiting for the Enclave President system. We're still waiting for the big presidential power armor, power suit and gauss rifle.

I've never been much for battle royale style gaming, but it's surprisingly fun, particularly when 1-3 adventure mode friends are on and we can work together well.  One of my friends is a PUBG and MoH vet and really gave me a LOT of tricks and tips for surviving.  Most of it is just plain common sense once I hear it, but as a single player aficionado I never really had to apply real life common sense to my gaming as someone who studies skills and perks to create monster builds that barely have to try.  (ie, why join in on a bear vs shark battle when you can let one kill the other and then only have to engage with one wounded predator?) It's really cool to feel a sense of improvement with each round of first hand experience.  I'm still very average and sometimes terrible, but I find the Nuclear Winter mode a fun little diversion that I'll likely engage in when I have a really long day and would otherwise not bother logging in because I don't have the energy to play for hours on end.
---
Do lucky hole mine with a set of excavator armor. Bout 1500 lead scraps with super duper perk when it’s all said and done.
---
Edit: Also, since they are lead nodes and not like cans/weights, the ore can me mined by everyone. No server hopping just to find out those can chimes or weights have already been scavenged.
---
This is fucking ridiculous. 
---
I love paying for a service that always seems to have issues on my day off.
---
Outstanding. I just completely avoided WS because I thought you'd get auto flagged. Thanks for the info!
---
&gt; the ui isn’t that bad
---
I mean.. that's your yardstick? It's "not that bad"? The UI shoudl be good to great. And the Pipboy is a pretty bad UI. I love FO games but that UI is awful. 
---
Also it soudns liek you haven't played that many BRs - some do have terrible inventory management (PUBG and Firestorm for example) but some have good and effective inventory management. "Bad" isn't par for the course.
---
Metacritic needs a significant reform. Most of the gaming community is too stupid, petty, or angry to be trusted to give fair reviews. Metacritic needs to change their review system to predetermined entries using maybe a a five factor (i.e. performance, replayability, bugs, world and rate each 1-10) scale to determine the points. Only by providing proof of purchase and hours played should anyone be allowed to write a review and give their own number. 
---
Games should never be reviewed based on whether the user thinks it should have been made, or the type of game it is ("I didn't want an online game"), or because they are angry at the developer for something.
---
Seems like a pattern just like the people paid to cheer at Bethesda’s E3 conference. Everybody noticed.
---
I’ll try that when I get out of work 👍
---
There is a recent list? Where? I haven't played a lot in the past months, is it a new feature?
---
I forgot to friend him. I would normally do that.
---
Ya got out of work a little early to rad it up.... sadly.. not gonna happen.
---
nothing sinister about it.  they are a company, run by businessmen.  by "worse" i meant *more profitable at the expense of our enjoyment*
---
Usually in Bethesda games I go stealth mele/sniping but I feel like this game being online that won’t work so honestly I’m not entirely sure haha any suggestions?
---
Most of these are just your own comments.  No one likes a troll.
---
You misspelled “is”
---
Same. I have like 30 bulk gears and nada. They are priced well below suggested and no one ever buys.
---
*My* fish.
---
I noticed this a few days ago as well. I hope it maintains because this seems like a good balance. Loving it!
---
Visit my camp then... I price duplicate plans at "super cheap" pricing, as well as clothing.
---
You plan on pvp ing?
---
I agree with you. I only ever ran into two bugs in this game, the first one being the power armor bug and the second one being the assultron head firing all cells in the first shot.
---
Many of the bugs that were to be found, you'd only find or run into if you were actively looking for them. Others were unique to some elements of the game, like explosive weapons that made enemies unable to die. All silly bugs that can be easilly avoided until a patch drops, I think we are going into a new generation today where kids are not used to new releases.. Online titles usually have a bunch of bugs at releases.
---
No you're completely wrong and generalising. I never said that they were in the right. You're projecting what you think I was doing rather than what i was actually doing.
---
Ahh thanks. That's great!
---
Sup arlov
---
That’s both not trolling and really sad. Good luck.
---
Choose cards that are not  ease of life cards first
---
I spam vomit emote and grenade launcher the guy’s body
---
But it kills the grind. As annoying as it is, the luck factor keeps people playing.
---
I was looking maybe for trapper armor
---
I’ve played pubg and apex don’t like either of those ui even compared to the pip boy. This isn’t a BR game it’s made for fallout players, and I guarantee they won’t change the UI when they still haven’t fixed a lot of aspects of the pvp so why even talk about this.
---
What platform you on? Start with that, and you may find someone willing to help you out, in game.
---
well i think that going back to the spawn point would help a lot, as would simply making them equal in strength to the current monsters in  NW, all of which are significantly weaker than their standard counterparts.
---
I am really sick of people trying to take all of the teeth out of survival!!! Obnoxious
---
Which exploit? Exploit is a broad term. They've fixed a lot of them, haven't fixed some of them.
---
Are you saying that because the lone wanderer appears or whatever?
---
Yet here you are, still riding my dick, stalking through my post history like someone with a real life.
---
I might come by and buy them from you to redistribute for free. I’ve made hundreds of thousands of caps and have no use for them other than to regift stuff. Send me your psn if you’re interested.
---
Definitely. Because if it closes to the west, there are only 4 places where you can get over without marsupial: northeast of Site A, east of Yellow Sandy's, by Autumn Acre Cabin and finally an area wesr-southwest of Mosstown. I wonder if you will be able to go inside Hawke's Refuge or any of the bunkers.
---
Including Tanagra Town and Treetops in the map would make some interesting places to hide and snipe.
---
This is speculation but my bet is July, they might do a Fourth of July event this year too.
---
workshop exploit maybe?
---
There was also VR pods in F4 fwiw
---
See, look how upset they are.
---
Bethesda has done a good job and continue to do so. Haters going to hate, thats why it's best to make your own opinions. The backlash at launch, people blew it out of proportion imo. Wasnt THAT bad. Anyways, some good tips. Search everything and scrap like crazy. Build your resources up. Sell everything else unless you using it. We dont have the storage space to go super crazy on collections. But enough to comfortably go through the game with. I say this to all new players too: if someone asks you to follow and they take you to or start heading towards a workshop. Run away. Its the only place griefers can kill you and theyll take your junk. Its not too common but it happens. Most importantly though, have fun. Welcome!

There’s still a luck factor.  Nothing will stop someone from quitting quicker than the 8 duplicates someone else reported.  
---
Also you receive less and less packs as time goes on.
---
PLEASEEE
---
It comes back in October
---
Particularly in the Fallout community. Some of the metacritic reviews basically said, paraphrasing, "this game is shit because it isn't FNV, Bethesda should have given it to Obsidian". The entire Fallout sub was incredibly hostile around release to people who went there looking to talk about 76, one of the reasons this sub is as large as it is (since the hostility drove traffic here).
---
Yep as long as you yourself are level 45. You will also still be able to make lower level handmades if you want to.
---
pcmr
---
Omfg thank i was wondering wat was going on thx for the info
---
Sell junk! People will always buy lead and steel for reasonable prices. Screws, springs, adhesive, crystal should also sell pretty well. I’m always looking out for vending machines with a fair amount of junk listed
---
Someone on the team has to be in the workshop in order for the team to be flagged for PVP.
---
I know it’s a dead post but I’m having trouble finding the plan, do you mean north of Lewisburg station or south of it?
---
I just started and every time I login I have to listen to the Overseers holotape again. Annoying
---
The launch was way worse than you described
---
I'll check it again tonight, but at least in the few minutes I had to read it, it sounded like Zax was impersonating Braun to get Vault Tec to make the delivery.
---
It wouldn't have been crucified by critics as much, but the community would generally have bashed it for not being what they wanted, which is FNV2.
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
While it looks clear cut a lot of things can be manipulated or cherrypicked to look a certain way on the internet. Its honestly better to just treat everything as a potential witch hunt and let the mods do the actual hunting.
---
Fortnite runs independently of paid internet systems on consoles. That's why it works as opposed to other online games.
---
Eh mainly I’d like to play with people and pve but maybe down the line!
---
huh? I was playing until 30-45 mins ago and had been for hours. Just come back to it and there’s auth errors now
---
FYI folks it's back til June 18th.
---
Sorry I poorly worded it. That was my intention, thank you.
---
Stealth sniping builds are very good all around except for the big big bosses in endgame
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6lu7jIlXd5clSzKJ23Inza/atomic-shop-patch-10-items-and-sales
---
Noted!
---
Thanks.
---
Daaaaamn I'm too late! And my PSN is down
---
I paid a total of 387$ for 2 copies... 1 for me and 1 for my wife. for a combined total of about 30 hours of game play
---
Had some issues last night.  Kept lagging and popping up here then there then back here.  It was weird.  Really messed up on opening doors or looting mutants.  Everything else was good though
---
Its 10$ on gamefly
---
&gt;I wonder if you will be able to go inside Hawke's Refuge or any of the bunkers.
---
Doubtful. You can't it inside Vault tec Ag or any of the other building that require loading in. 
---
&gt;Including Tanagra Town and Treetops in the map would make some interesting places to hide and snipe.
---
Hiding at the top of Treetops and sniping or lobbing explosives would be fucking awesome.
---
You know if you had suggested this a month ago I would have laughed at the idea and said "OWNED is clear enough," but now with Nuclear Winter, being able to quickly scan through your stuff and adjust favorites would be a huge benefit. Good suggestion OP.
---
I know it. I wonder if has anything to die with it being 5am or so in Japan
---
Yes.  The community is extremely friendly, helpful and generally good natured.
---
Or let each game end near a vault that opens when you win to escape the fire
---
You have to understand that the way you came about the game is why you feel the way you do. I'm a huge Fallout fan but I could already see tons of problems when it came to the beta. So I told myself that I would wait and the game continued to have issues. So I held back from buying it for six months and it was the best thing I could have done. I didn't get that sense of regret and anger that it wasn't what I wanted it to be. I have no regrets waiting because at this point it's a very solid game. I've had very little buggy issues out of it and I'm glad I didn't have to deal with the frustration at launch.
---
Sorry. XBoner, here.
---
That’s always how it is with these builds, makes bosses super difficult but the rest of the game fun and challenging. I just don’t know how it would workout down the line if I go into pvp
---
Honestly though, this would be soo helpful to see what youve unlocked through the new gamemode too
---
Info from a youtuber that has the same access to them as you....that's like reading the news on facebook.
---
Nothing suggests valut raid are connected to br,nor there is any kind of info on when BR,raids or anything new will drop. All we now is that they're scheduled for the summer segment.
---
So the current bugs we've found are
---
XBOX
---
Kills dont get accounted for even when it says you've killed them
---
Getting stuck aiming down sights
---
Ps4
---
Stuck in general
---
Hoping out of power armor while reviving a fallen team member
---
Lag spikes while switching weapons
---
Not getting credited for kills
---
Balance issues 
---
(Iv looked through the reddit for other examples)
---
Heavy weapons seem to be on the strong side
---
Some don't like how perk cards are tied to specials making it so some people can never use some of the cards
---
Some dont like the blueprint you can bring in and use from adventure mode
---
Some dont like how armor is good for 1-2 shots and how power armor doesn't help alot
---
Melee weapons are horrifically underpowered due to the range you have to close against a 50. Machine gun that deal over 50 dmg a shot
---
Some do not like the pipboy UI due to how time consuming it is just to drop ammo and want it to be overhauled to have a BR mode exclusive UI
---
IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER BUGS IR SUGGESTIONS OR ANYTHING RELATED TO BALANCE FOR NUCLEAR WINTER, PLEASE POST WHAT CONSOLE YOU ARE ON
---
Oh geez, thanks for pointing that out.  It is sad, isn't it?  
---
Thanks, I'll need it.  I don't know if you knew this, but there are a bunch of angry weirdos on this sub.
---
Good luck to you too!
---
I make almost all my money off plans ammo and mats. I believe I'm up to just under 350k earned since vending started.  No one buys legendaries on ps4 unless they are perfect, I've got 6 bloodied, 2 inst, 3 furious, and 3 vampire in my machine relatively cheap right now and because they aren't explosive they just sit there.  I do however sell quite a bit of 3 star and 2 star legendary armor.  Also I cannot keep shielded underarmor in my machines.  Hope that helps.
---
Gt postalslave Hmu
---
i was playing for hours until 30-45 mins ago but now i’m in the same boat
---
Yep. The more you stay back and non-aggressive, the better you will do. Thankfully most of the players/teams don’t follow this method. It’s nice to get a win streak going on patience and mindfulness.
---
Ok cool! Thanks for the advice. I tend to end up with tons of junk because I have the habit of picking up every single item from the old games haha.
---
What kinda price is a good or bad price for say adhesive though? Like is the “value” of the item listen in game even close to what people are willing to pay?
---
I’m not sure because personally I run a vats crit sniper build, but I would assume not the greatest due to sneak damage being your main source of damage but I could totally be wrong
---
Those new players come from strange harsher lands.
---
Don’t trust them any farther then you can throw them.
---
After comparing Adventure and NW, I think mutation and weapon loadouts should be allowed to be brought into survival, but weapons only do base damage like you said. Mutation should be allowed. This will give people reason to keep playing Adventure to work their build but won’t be able to abuse it.
---
If everyone starts from 0 in survival and no mutation/weapons carried over, many people would simply skip the Adventure part of the game because there’s no benefit in perfecting their gears and mutations. 
---
When I played COD I never did the storyline, always go straight into hardcore multiplayer mode. Haven’t done any of the solo part because the solo and MP modes are completely separate. FO can avoid that by allowing part of your build carried over to Survival so people will play both and use one to enhance the other. But definitely no ‘standing still to avoid damage’ kind of crap.
---
Yes I know that’s why I worded it the way I did. The only thing we do know is there is more than the BR Mode.
---
Man all it took for me was to go into photo mode in a nuke zone. It was new years and the whole server was there. My first SBQ too.
---
Yeah but it's harder to find your stuff among the other shit. This makes it much clearer and concise. Also it's just QOL stuff that should've been there anyways
---
I've had this happen with non legendaries and artillery strikes on ps4 since e3
---
Thanks for adding to the discussion and not getting weird and mimicking me. That would’ve been strange.
---
Intuitively I'm constantly clicking the thumb sticks to toggle owned/not.  Then I remember it doesn't do that. It should be just a filter- toggle imo. Not an extra tab.
---
Thanks, I appreciate it. Seems like mats are gonna be my bread and butter atleast for now.
---
while yelling "**THIS** is for the players!"
---
Why do you need more than one character for that mode?
---
Personally I think the Power Armor is the worst armor in NW. You become so big and bulky, easy to hit and easy to spot. You hear the sound of someone in a PA from miles away.. And then you just get 1tapped by a headshot anyway.
---
Ah, gotcha. If that is the case then disregard my comment. I thought they earned it via NW and wanted to use it in the other game modes.
---
17 here.
---
Yeah it was, i didn't realize it was in this one too either. Been grabbing desk fans and typewriters off of my Fo4 knowledge lol
---
When you draw a circle inside of each of those maps, I bet the playable terrain doesn't actually overlap. Just my 2 pennies.
---
While you make some decent points, he's right. There are a lot of things that might work fine when you only have a few dozen or hundred people playing, but then break when you have tens of thousands or millions playing. Server stress is a real thing, and it doesn't always simply cause disconnections. Sometimes the timing of a scripted event gets broke, which can snowball into other related issues. Sometimes spawns disappear or don't register properly.
---
Either or, just something to distinguish between what you have and don't
---
For Posterity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6HdBplLmuU
---
I have had no problem locking things w/o a lock pick perk selected.
---
Ok, I misunderstood. I thought you wanted to use the NW rewards in other modes. Sorry I don't have any insight on the NW specific use of it :(.
---
Update, can play PvE, but it cant find a NW match for me. :(
---
Stop posting about it or none of them will benefit from both lol.
---
Indeed. Baby steps.
---
I used it once to buy radaway when i was trying for a specific mutation. Even that was after all the quests i could do... And verdant season in the forest.
---
We should be able to drive the cars. There were working cars in fallout 2
---
Any time.  I'd hate to be strange on the internet.  I appreciate your contradictory points, insults, expectations that others would read your comments, disgust that others would read your comments and self awareness.
---
I’ll reach back out to you if I still have anything left after helping the other three guys. I know some plans I have like 8 or 9 of so send me a PM if you want those scraps
---
I mean, it was never about the game... My original point was about the sub, you just have to keep changing the subject because there is no way to claim this sub isn't a circlejerk without looking completely deluded. I never said I didn't like the game and here is the problem that you're all so desperate to deflect from: unless you have only nice things to say about the game, you lunatics will smear everyone as never playing the game, as being a "lemming bitch" (the irony) or just bandwagoning or any other bullshit you can come up with to ignore any opinion even slightly different than yours.
---
a final boss for ending players
---
Always online and millions of people playing at the same time does not an MMO make. With these qualifiers, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, despite being entirely single-player, in an MMO. The hitch is that these players have to be playing *together* in massive numbers. And 50 (or whatever the cap is in FO76) isn't a massive number. If it was, then Battlefield 3 would be an MMO, because it caps out at 128-256 players. Ever hear BF3 referred to as an MMO? It's always online, millions of players, hundreds on the same server? No. That's because it's not an MMO either. EVE Online, on the other hand, with 60k+ players on the same server, at the same time, interacting with each other? That's a good example of an MMO. 
---
And it's not a high horse, it's a donkey. You don't know your games OR your farm animals! :P
---
Man you have got the Uranium Fever
---
So we didn’t provoke/attack these guys in any way but they started punching and doing normal damage. Me being sane ran away but then got shot by the same guys without even fighting back.
---
Hmm wonder why Bethesda doesn't do the same thing. 
---
Not being able to play on a day off is brutal.
---
Different characters have different S.P.E.C.I.A.L builds whicheads to different perk builds. I would prefer to use my healer but I'm locked in on my main since the rank is character bound.
---
Turds are strong on the reddits
---
I want one centered in watoga with all those trenches around it. That would be wild.
---
Whhaaaaat! Awesome
---
Report them immediately to both the sub mods and Reddit admins. Telling someone to go kill themselves is a site wide bannable offence.
---
I doubt bethesda sees it as a bug
---
Happened to me too, EXACTLY the same as you described it, got to be a bug or something.
---
You don't even know what happened... but you thought it was fixed. OK.
---
Beat me too it - came here to say the same thing!
---
I mostly play alone and love it.  I team up when I want to and love that too.
---
They absolutely do not like being called out in that circlejerk.
---
I'm at 6 crashes and counting. They happen at random times but whatever. Hoping that the npc update is goodand they managed to optimize the game.
---
its part of the main questline
---
What is verdant about btw
---
There is legitimately no reason to go look at comments unrelated to what’s being discussed. Lmao you really are the internet in a nutshell. Also made no contradictions but again good luck.
---
[Let me tell you about the DMV... ](https://www.ign.com/wikis/fallout-76/How_to_Join_the_Brotherhood_of_Steel)
---
There's that event near morgantown airport that has a drone drop a box after you complete it, that one always contain 100 pre-war money.. It'd be a nice farm.
---
Murphys Law at it's worst.
---
Not really. People sell steel at about 1 cap per unit, and lead can be 2-3 caps per unit. Just experiment with it. If people are always buying everything, raise the price; if no one is buying, lower the price. 
---
You can also sell stuff to the NPC vendors and get 1400 caps a day too
---
Juicehead was annoying at first with all his negativity but then he began seeing that he was being to harsh and started using proper judgement skills
---
Why this won't be included in full nw launch will have lame excuses and promises of canvas
---
Double plants picked... Stacks nicely with green thumb to get loads of plants for crafting!
---
Well don’t accidentally scrap all with Pre-War money in your inventory. Can’t say I like this idea.
---
Nobody is going to wait that long for it to come back, it will be DOA
---
Exactly. I do think we need them to go permanent, current rules in place are fine with exception of indestructible camps/turrets 
---
I do think when permanent survival launches everyone should start at lvl 1 and no trading in gear from our adventure characters
---
Thanks for the feedback :)
---
We all have a role to play and props to you for at least being honest and real about your role. I will add that if you're not already doing it, then simply having your head on a swivel having a mic to communicate to your team any enemy movements you see in the field can be a HUGE help, especially if none of them are on mic. Maybe then you're less of a bait and more of a scout hehe.
---
I get reactions all the time when i say i play it from people who haven't touched it. I will admit it wasn't worth the $70 or so at launch but is quite good for $30. As i said before some of the things that made Fallout great is lost in an MMO especially the role playing, picking side and shaping your game world around you as a player. But for what it does Fo76 does fit alright and is a ton of fun to play, but got old as does any other MMO. 
---
At least they are adding stuff too it, but for me it was too little too late. I got my burnout on it and had to stop. I will come back in the future when there is more too do.
---
Check underwater. They may have glitched and snapped to the terrain under your house.
---
and your ui isn't stretched out? please provide screenshots.
---
I always stock up on ammo and Stimpaks when I’ve got extra caps. Always looking for ultracite scrap these days.
---
you only get so many water per hour, it produces one water like every 90 seconds, its random which machine will get the 1 water, some seem to fill first before the others, the only difference between 1 water purifier and 10 water purifiers is how many you can store, not how many you can produce. you are still limited to the 1 water produced every minute and a half to 2 minutes so if you clean all your machines out wait 10 minutes then check machines again you will have like 5 water spread out between all the machines you have placed.
---
same currently. I think play station's network is having issues. [Check here](https://status.playstation.com/en-us/).
---
YouTube comments don't matter. Seriously, they don't. For years the YouTube comment sections has been known across the internet as a cesspool.
---
Oh yeah I forgot about the special skills... Been ages since I've had to go into that menu.
---
My bad.
---
I'm similar my char is based on crit/heavy. My end is low and that's one I'd like higher. I wish it was just fill up the card slots instead
---
Like how you sort stuff in the pip boy when you press LS(on Xbox)
---
It would pretty sad to say goodbye to everything
---
No fuckin shit, wow. This is awesome. Now I can play drunk and not have to feel like my wandering is ruining others fun!
---
Whats so controversial about calling a bad game bad
---
No one ever fucking speaks though, the amount of times ive died cause the team just doesnt communicate
---
" Considering this is just the PS4 player count, which is usually the biggest one between PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One "    
---
Your kidding right? because its normally always Pc with the biggest
---
They just need more details in general. We're all nerds, we can handle data, treat us like nerds!
---
If you want base damage weapons there’s nuclear winter.
---
Legendary weps and armor need to be in the game. 
---
Do you think it’s possible to take down the scorchbeast queen with base weps?
---
Happens often now. Really obnoxious. I think there must be a server crashing bug near the beginning of the game that a new player must just hit often
---
Just trolling, but what if I did? Would that upset you?
---
Maga?
---
Yeah. First a psn update and now this.
---
\*fortunate son starts playing\*
---
You mean acid and waste oil right? #flamerproblems
---
Honestly in my whole time playing it (I've only played like two weeks in total couple hours a day) I've met maybe 30 people, and none of them wanted to kill me. Granted I generally dont go seeking people and rarely goto areas that are super populated.
---
Honestly just like chillin on my cliffside camp, I'll walk to the creamery to fill up on drinking supplies, head back to my camp and listen to the radio. 
---
Theres also the fact that all of my weapons are either broken or have no ammo and I haven't been able to fix them, so like any time I go out it's with a melee weapon.
---
I feel like a redraw would be better OT least the first dozen or so packs vs a paltry 50 pts
---
Great thank you! I popped their username in google translate, is it accurate to credit them as Fox or  Hú hú ? I would hate to write the wrong name!
---
Shotgun shells and 5.56. I sell tons of it since I'm melee. One cap each.
---
I totally would - if it wasnt the fact that characters dont share inventory / crafting progress. So I'd unlock stuff on a character I'd only use for nw. 
---
I only play one character. I'm not into jumping multi characters in mmo. I may just level a few stats to help and suck it up on main game.
---
Are (or were) they all sitting on something you can go into build and store, like a foundation or a floor? You might be able to see them again in your stored items as a result of storing whatever they were sitting on.
---
Nope. Plus it clearly says 7/10, meaning they're gone, but this stupid fucking system thinks I still own 10. They're not in the storage, they're nowhere to be found.
---
If you are PS4, ill happily buy steel 1 cap per, and acid 4 caps per!
---
Yeah that pretty much nailed it
---
Ya, keep following the overseer and she will lead you right to them. Get their too quick and you’ll get shredded to death.
---
These are the things legends are made of. Or at least the things that are retold on the drunken gamer buddy nights or just on the mic while doing some mindless grinding...."Man, I remember this one time in Nuclear Winter..."  
---
Grats on your win!
---
You're pretty dense huh? Or maybe you're just stubborn. Either way you're not getting it at all and funny you bring up battlefield because every single BF game at launch is a hot mess of connection and net code problems, you know the whole point of what I said. I'm not trying to argue what is or isn't an mmo, but how online multiplayer games of many sizes have issues when released.
---
Hey, it’s late so I can’t help u out right now (10:43pm here) but in the morning (7-9 am my time) if u still haven’t got the quest done I’ll happily jump off a cliff or something so u can revive me.
---
You don't really and its all perspective.  The one he's talking about all takes a lot of farming, months worth. It's rare and valuable.  It's like 3-5 dailies that give a coin and you need like 200-300 for the clothes and hat
---
Fortnite was given special permission by Sony due to its immense popularity. It's also the only online PS4 game that supports crossplay, for the same reason.
---
Well they're both equally as credible.....
---
I would think so. During the BETA for the base game progress was kept, so I don’t know why it would be different
---
I’m with you there, I spent months putting together and perfecting weps/armor/perks, but currently the glut of duplicated armor and weps has screwed the mode. 
---
At least a restart or seasons would change that. 
---
It took guys months to grind out god tier sets to dupe. Just saying
---
Okay thanks for the heads up. I might try to dig into a bit more!
---
 Not gonna happen
---
I'd like a toggle like 'Hide Owned' so when I'm looking for new things, I do not see what I already have.
---
i run a water farm on all my characters 10-12 industrials on each one.. leave and go out to like west tek do some farming, come back an hour or two later and i will have 50 to 60 water sitting there waiting for me to pick up.. grab what i need throw a few in stash for back ups incase i come home and someones cleaned me out when i run out on my character. go back out rinse and repeat. its not a bad thing to have quite a few purifiers out.
---
I still don't understand why people do this. What fun is it to play like that? It takes all the challenge out of the game what a ding dong
---
No worries I was surprised when I saw that one character is br 4 another is br 14 lol dumb.
---
(on Xbox one x) I get the same hitching as in adventure mode, but strangely enough it's always the auto radium rifle that consistently kills my performance. It's probably the same in adventure mode, I just never used it before. Otherwise I'm shocked at the solid stability for a new game mode like this.
---
You'll find some really cool lore about everything from factions to perks in the game. It will require reading/listening to a lot of notes. A couple really blew my mind.
---
And yea, I think they plan on supporting 76 for several years. As long as they're making money off it, they'll keep updating it. How long has gtao been going on?
---
It wasn't nearly as bad as the "content creators" wanted people to think. It became a circle jerk where people kept trying to one up each other about how bad it was and spiraled out of control.
---
Not talking about CNN, about the “Reddish Human Not so good” meme.
---
The perk cards you equip have an effect
---
Your Idea however showed me something interesting. They're still there, just invisible, which is what I suspected.
---
https://i.imgur.com/WWjhURj.jpg Here.
---
I find this post really confusing
---
Maybe not now, but the more heat it gets. Delete this topic NOW!
---
Go in your pipboy, go to junk, and at the bottom where it tells you to place your camp, view, perks, blah blah blah, it will tell you what button to press to show you how many of what you are holding. From there you can request to have it on “search”
---
If this is true, then Todd, if you are in fact watching.....You totally have permission to install a monitor and some ram on my toilet so I can play Skyrim while I maek teh poopies. Come Port Ma Potty!
---
 There is legitimately no reason to go look at comments unrelated to what’s being discussed. 
---
\-you
---
I’ve made my posts and comments elsewhere and submitted plenty of tickets. 
---
\-also you
---
If you cared about the game and understand the technical quality of each patch it would upset you.
---
If you disagree you simply don’t care if this game is in a good place. 
---
 At no point did I claim to be better than anyone or act dramatic about anything. Arguing a point went over your head I guess. 
---
Also, why did you delete your comment?
---
If you didn't show on the board as a player, it would be like a halo/left4dead 2 mashup. You'd still need to chase down the survivors to rampage and, if like in what a previous post said, you where set at a similar handicap as normal NW mobs there wouldn't be suicide for grief as much since even a low lvl player could take them out for the second time. And definitely beyond anything else, even if this doesn't get put in as a mode or something, Bethesda please for the love of god add the same quality of life (the server hop for CAMPs) from adventure to NW (join new game or something)
---
i think he was expecting each purifier to produce water at the same time, not the system the game has set up. from my understanding what he is explaining is he believed that if he put down 10 purifiers and waited a couple minutes all 10 purifiers would have 1 water each.. which it doesnt work like that.
---
Psn is down for everyone
---
Praise be the desk fan and typewriter
---
Runs great on console. 😁
---
Broke?
---
I think it is due to all the new players
---
I don' know, do you?
---
Sounds pretty basic lol
---
Rifleman and bloodymess add to it. I think adrenaline will too. It’s all about perk cards my dude!
---
Gotcha.  Thanks for responding.
---
This is a super creative and fun idea!
---
Ah great! Lol! How long has it been down? I’ve just finished a NW match like 10 mins ago, was all fine, then couldn’t re-connect to a new one.
---
I would like that as an adventure event boss.
---
Lmfao holy shit well at least you admit it.
---
I don't know mate, don't sweat it :-).
---
1. Didn’t even suggest anyone go look at any other comments as again they aren’t relevant to what’s being discussed here.
---
2. Show me where that says I’m better than someone?
---
Good try though this doesn’t look weird for you at all
---
Haha I’m sure. I actually fixed it by launching outside of launcher. Don’t know why that worked.
---
If you don't have the perk to increase animal dmg or reduce animal dmg he is rather devestating.
---
Other wise I've killed it in seconds with the right perks on.
---
I think it's to Force a gameplay choice. Do more dmg to players or kill beasts easier.

 &gt; This is a super creative and fun idea!
---
It's definitely going somewhere.
---
It’s taken me months to get a god set, I feel like I’m finally close to perfect, 99%. I agree there is a lot of duped armor and weapons, I’ve probably even bought some at some point.
---
But tbh, the duped stuff isn’t even all that incredible besides the weapons. I don’t think it’s bad enough to screw the mode entirely. I actually think it makes the start up cost to get involved with survival much lower. Imagine how few god players there would be
---
Over an hour for me. More for others. Huge pain in the ass.
---
I have both those maxed!
---
Yeah, check my post. They're "there" just invisible. And Absent in any normal way. They don't fire, they aren't phisically there, they're just... A ghost, occupying my build limit.
---
I stored the foundations they were on, and ghosts dissapeared and I could built turrets again, wasting resources again. Shame.
---
Yeah it’s down across the board
---
I always seen to not have enough, maybe its because I build so many turrets.
---
So it’s a bloodied lever? Is your health high?
---
Thanks man!
---
Wait until the free week is over. I have a feeling they are prioritizing NW servers atm at the expense of adventure mode. I can play NW just fine but adventure is a mess.
---
I'd say that there's a decent chance that it would trigger the hell out of you, but there's also a chance that you're a liberal minded person that doesn't worry about these things!
---
I didn’t say I experienced no bugs. Read my comment again.
---
You're a good dude
---
NPCs are coming with wastelanders in the fall not nuclear winter
---
food works the same as water, if you clear out your garden and then stand there and watch them you will see they come back one at a time over a period of time, not all of them  at the same time.   
---
like i pick all 20 of my gourds i can stand there and watch them regrow at about 1 every minute or two after about 30 minutes they would all be ready to harvest again.
---
Dude full games use to be no bigger then 5mb, and you're gonna tell me games aren't more elaborate now? Games are way more elaborate and harder to make nowadays and on top of that people expect perfection.
---
If you understood that then you're iq must be lower than a flys
---
Why did you wait so long to get the game?
---
The complaints were valid. The game was still in BETA at best at launch. Aside from the numerous disconnects (oh you just killed a scorchbeast queen? disconnect. completed an event or mission? disconnect, do it over.) there were some serious bugs like dropping bags through the ground (still don't trust dropping items) or VATS glitching when trying to take down a scorchbeast or sbq to the point where your game would crash or you would die. Bethesda tends to take 1 step forward with this game and 3 steps back. The servers are more stable, sure, but I've noticed since NW/free week launched there are graphic issues with player faces and terrain (faces appearing green and like something out of the Matrix, terrain glitching so you can see through it). I've taken screenshots and video to submit to Bethesda but my complaints (like others) just go ignored.
---
This place is a circle jerk. Keep playing, you'll see.
---
it's a sneak peak not even a week old yet.
---
You need to start bulking all you junk and sell it.
---
I think I cant find a match b/c so many others cant login
---
why TF did you delete it?!
---
Which one? Must've been mods
---
Yeah. I wish it was just 7 cards, and you can't have more of one special stat cards than 15.
---
This look amazing. Thanks for the tip!
---
The turrets weren’t in your stored items when you stored the foundations? Hmm. Yeah. It’s a huge pain in the ass.
---
You have a bloodied lever action.
---
Your damage will increase as your health gets lower.
---
The “orange man bad”  comment.
---
better to pick it up now while it's on sale, last I looked stores still had it at full retail price for the most part.
---
So is that a yes?
---
Yeah but I was referring to the BR
---
Ex-actly! Please man, I bought that shit for a reason
---
Yup :(
---
I mean there is an official discord for it. Where you can actually roleplay
---
Is there a list of things in the vault that you can interact with as you level up?
---
Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!!! Rape riot pillage burn! Our society is at its end. Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!!.
---
3 minutes is far to long
---
It's still there on my end. You know how biased social media platforms are though.
---
I agree. I’m really curious to see what Bethesda does with it. 
---
The way they continue to respond to the duping is fucking over their game imho.
---
Brown paper bag with fertilizer... you can light it on fire with the Pyrolyzer. :)
---
Will double exp apply to overseer rank or characters exp earned from NW?
---
This sucks 😭
---
Nuclear Winter is the dlc name.not just the gamemode, like wild appalachia wasnt just survival mode
---
With 12 people who watched him, how did he honestly expect to get away with that?
---
What?
---
True, tried it just now. Still garbage.
---
Oh that's if you're already a member :/  
---
$10 to keep it.
---
You can only sell most junk to vendors when it's bundled. It does help with aluminum and lead weight though.
---
But every bundle cost 2 plastic. You also need plastic if you like shotguns/energy weapons... For ammo pressing.
---
I have the opposite opinion 😄 id rather less waiting for the BR... and adding invulnerability would remove the risk of where to spawn and the fun early game brawls
---
Bos gross
---
He also released over a dozen stories that turned out to be fake and instead of removing these videos or coming back out to explain it was fake he just stopped talking about them and left them up on his channel. Now I feel his coverage has moved but I don't think its because he changed I think hes just reflecting the majority like he did when he released the tons of slanted coverage to get clicks and is moving to a more moderate view not cause his changed but because his viewer base changed.
---
No thanks. I want to see whether my opponent is wearing wood armor or marine armor before I decide to rush him with a weak gun. Plenty of time to do catwalk shows in Vault 51.
---
If i could bloody get on i'd tell you. This playstation server problem is really annoying. Watch this space.
---
okay
---
If you didn’t already know, you learn weapon mods by scrapping other weapons. That was something I didn’t know when I started. Also melee builds are pretty OP. 
---
If you’re wondering why your inventory weighs so much, its probably the massive amount of aid items you’re carrying around and don’t need. I dump pretty much all my chems and all but 5-10 stimpacks in my stash, and I’ve yet to take anything back out. 
---
Also bulk your junk items if your stash gets full :)
---
Hell yeah I'm in no more spray and pray. I love pubg for this reason.
---
Railings
---
I'm gonna piggyback on this since you touched on a social aspect. How do you accept a team invite? I got a popup that I was invited. Ctrl+Tab'd into social. Under teams it was empty, no invite. Empty friend list...I'm new. And, of course, recent players. Am I supposed to find the inviter in the recent players list or something? The UI in general is confusing, tbh, but Bethesda key mapping/UI is always "unique".
---
Dear Todd, please put shit that was good about the other three fallout games you frakking made. Please?
---
Yeah, which is weird because I bought it from GameFly like a month ago for $12 without having to do a trial, tell them I’m keeping it, and then remembering to cancel my membership.  Dang it.
---
I don’t see anything, sorry.
---
Goat Simulator is actually really funny for adults, too.  The whole thing is just so ridiculous.
---
It sounds fun, but it also gives players that should be out of the game a mechanic to affect play. Someone would figure out a way to die as a strategic advantage for their team.
---
If you play adventure and turn on pacifist then neither you can hurt someone nor anyone can hurt you. In adventure mode.
---
Credit to u/EDDIE_BR0CK above:
---
There's two ways to do it;
---
•	⁠On the crafting menu for the item you're trying to craft, there should be a button to 'Tag for Search'.
---
•	⁠In your pipboy, under Junk, you can 'View by Components'. This shows you all the scrap available, and what you currently possess. You can go through this list and 'Tag for Search' just like the step above.
---
I haven’t. Prices much weight loss, maybe just the plastic. But any junk you can’t sell straight up can be once bundled
---
That is the most valuable thing to highlight. Always pick up ballistic fiber when you find it and hord it like a greedy dragon.
---
Totally true...up until a couple months ago, I could count on about 1k atoms a month just from playing the game...now, if I just "play" I get next to nothing. 400 atoms in two months of regular play.
---
THANK YOU! No other “fix” has worked and it was this simple! Ryan
---
So I’m guessing I’m kinda screwed then?
---
Someone just got jebaited.
---
It’s essentially a one star, limb damage isn’t all that useful in the long run.  Caps are pretty easy to come by and 50 cals are very strong. Not a terrible investment.
---
So he does not know nothing about Adventure mode when the More Info CLEARLY said Cooperative Play. PvP is NOT Cooperative Play there is a difference between Co-op and PvP there are never one in the same, Get your facts right.
---
People who poses as being someone who does no harm to players to try and draw them into false insecurities to kill them for there loot, This is not Sea of Thieves where you have to always watch out for danger at every turn. Adventure does not mean kill anyone on sight, Adventure means to explore and discover and do stuff cooperatively.
---
Also you been reported for your bad behavior at the end of your post. Good Day to you.
---
My friends range from 19 to 49.  We all have fun together.
---
Perfect. thanks
---
I just want railings.
---
Stairs that don't make me want to kick a baby
---
Ya, it’s not OP but that’s a good deal for it. Ive seen a similar 3* for 8k
---
This has been suggested before, and it's a great idea (and presumably not too difficult to implement.) Right now those machines might as well not exist.
---
Won't argue with that I suppose. Still, I do not think the launch was acceptable by any standard, especially following their opportunity to hold a proper bug-squashing public BETA.
---
In one game I seemed to take a long time to spawn in, and once I did, the first thing I spotted was 2 players in Power Armor with Gatling guns already, I just ran, obviously some have played enough to know exactly where to spawn for quick gear grabs, but if you never survive long enough to find any of those, what chance do you have.
---
Then play with friends. If you don't have friends then make some
---
Also if you team up then you can't hurt your teammates in any gamemode or setting.
---
Love that you got down voted for pointing out a fact.
---
What do you suppose "most killed enemy type" will be?
---
&gt;!It's gonna be feral ghouls by a wiiiiide margin.!&lt;
---
Out of interest, does anyone know what's the MOST you can coax from any rifle with all the relevant perks? (And what those perks are!) And what the stars would have to be.  I'm guessing 2 shot, area damage, instigating?
---
I'm English, so my opinion on trump doesn't really matter. I don't think he's half as bad as the media portrays him though, so I suppose that makes me a Nazi.
---
Also, if you request a nuclear keycard from the Enclave, the crate it comes in has 100 pre-war money. I’m pretty sure that US Supply Requisition holotapes give that much too.
---
Exactly. The only smart guy in this thread.
---
It's been down for 2.5 hours now... Sadly enough, the crashing of psn (i was still in a fo76) caused my base to get completely demolished by invisible enemies.. As a level 30 player, i won't have enough rescources to repair that in the next 2/3 days!
---
Ty for posting.
---
I’m confused. Have a good day.
---
You clearly never experienced fortnite when friendly fire was a thing
---
Why? Are you that bad at aiming?
---
The posts and comments that contained the supporting arguments you didn't have the time to type out weren't relevant to your claim?
---
That makes sense.
---
You imply no one else cares or understands like you do.  
---
Chin up.  You'll get through this.
---
I'm sure calling me weird will eventually be effective.
---
Who says it was a man?
---
Asks, a man.
---
Ah maybe
---
No because who the hell other than the Fallout 4 fans would most benefit from it.
---
I'm kinda lost on what you mean by this.
---
Fuck, that sucks man
---
That would definitely be a nice addition. I just started playing (currently level 10) and my favorite thing about FO4 was building so naturally I gravitated towards that but I’m finding it to be a big grind to get the things I want and need in a base
---
I would like to see this as well.
---
I remember seeing apost a few weeks ago about someone who had this encounter in the toxic valley
---
Yea I'm not saying you become a zombie. I'm not saying your character turns into anything. I'm simply suggesting that you should get to play some monster, whatever that monster maybe, after your death.
---
They might complain. But they'll get over it. Everyone got over it in pung which is why it's the better battle Royale.
---
Honestly, I feel like none of the previous factions or even personalities of individual robots are taken into account with the current character models. Biv, Vlad, Rose, and the whitesprings vendor are basically the only special ones. All the responder vendors are copies, with no regard to the area they would have been getting repairs from or work at
---
Sony said they weren't going to do anything for E3, but it was all a ruse!
---
I must be doing things way wrong. I cant kill anything in one shot. Everything I fight is a massive bullet sponge
---
You sellin any fasnact plans?
---
Make sure to scrap all your junk. 
---
Shotgun ammo is plenty so is 308 and 45
---
I agree with this. Our camps could use more flair for porches, balconies, and around stairs.
---
During the beta it deserved the hate It got, I've played during the beta. Nothing they said was lies.
---
Use this https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks to plan your build and look at a perk level up road map. Scrap all junk before storing in stash. Scrap all weapons to learn mods. Plant mutfruit, corn, and razor grain quickly to get food and make adhesive.
---
Pleasure.
---
Ewwwww dont do that gross
---
I've played pubg for the whole time it's been out and they've always had friendly fire. Just don't be a bitch dawg.
---
Are you on PC or what?
---
bloodied is hot now before they nerf it, so it should attract some buyers, id say 4000-5000 minimum on reddit marketplaces (could go alot higher!), but not as much ingame vending as people just dont pay as much in game
---
It’s a sneak peek it’s going to go away
---
i thought he was gonna tear apart any uninvited guests
---
I’m able to invite people into my team without them being/becoming my friend. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
What region? Hasn't been too bad for me in the PNW USA.
---
this has happened to me this twice this week. i’m not sure if it’s to do with the charge level as my controller wasn’t disconnected, and i opened the pip/map to stop the waste
---
It appeared in the Wastelanders teaser trailer, and the DLC is worded as “Year 2” so I’d take a guess around mid November?
---
Dude YouTube comments are a literal joke no one takes serious. YouTube comments are about as good as garbage posted on 4chan.
---
he used to get lots of cuddles
---
Xbox.
---
It's nice to see you again captain
---
All I am saying that the hate at launch was deserved, i am glad that they improved a game, bdcause i am having s blast in nuclear winter. I am just sick of all this new trend of making half finished games (anthem, fo76, no man sky, sea of thief etc) it is not okey and noone should defend it we deserve better than how this companies started to treat us.
---
They weren’t supporting anything I was arguing. Cherry picked and irrelevant. Nice. Also weren’t relevant because what was being discussed was the technical future of this game and what that time line looks like. Didn’t say nobody cares or is as smart as I am. Blatantly ignoring poor patches and not discussing the issues to blindly praise the good bits is unhealthy for any software. Glad we’ve been discussing that this whole time. I’m calling you weird because you’re being weird. I’m done with this so good luck again.
---
For the most part, yes. Everyone I've met, save one or two, has been incredibly helpful and kind. When my sister started playing and I was running her through some daily events, a random dude came up and gave us both about 2k+ ammo for each of our main guns (.45 and 10mm), thumbs up emote, and left. I've also had people give me other helpful stuff, or things I'm collecting (I like to hoard Nuka Colas and their flavors for when we get the decorating update one day)
---
I think personally I've only ever run into one dude who wasn't nice. I think. I couldn't quite tell?  He pistolwhipped me for a good 2-3 minutes while I was "AFK" (eating). I'm on pacifist mode... Pretty sure he was trying to bait me into that ol' switcheroo-PVP thing.
---
But I digress. I also like to help out when I can. We found a little kid and his older brother (?) who had just started the game. So we gave them some cool outfits, stimpaks, and a few other goodies. Gave the kid some nuka cola too and I guess he must like it as much as I do cause he lost his absolute shit. It was a good feeling.
---
Disclaimer: This is in Adventure mode. I don't do survival mode.
---
So first I have to shoot player and then immediately a ghoul before getting his loot. No thanks.
---
Yeah.  I've met the Enclave and their pet Deathclaws.  You sir, are not a member of the Enclave.
---
Jiggle the cord
---
Yup this. That 1800 cost of Blackbird paint makes it obvious. It’s just paint with no effect on the armor. It’s 3 times what it should cost. Almost real life $20 for just armor paint.
---
No new info about junk decorations.
---
Who's triggered here?
---
Boom roasted
---
Since you talked about vendors, which ones can you sell ammo to or is there even a way to do that ? Players rarely buy my 700 .35 ammo and i don't use the fusion cores
---
I wish the area was a lot bigger and the storm moved slower or had much longer pauses and shorter travels. I'd like a long match with lots of loot finding and strategy.  
---
The basic premise of a BR isn't bad, but the implementation favors ADD twitch players and so I can't get into it.
---
Glowing ghouls! I think a mode like this (or even just the original suggestion) sounds AWESOME!
---
That actually would be cool as all get out. Make it so all the items shown in game are literally just models
---
And find the water purifier plans sooner rather than later, but don’t drink it unless it’s an emergency. That’s what boiled water is for. 
---
Don’t freak out about rads; you’ll eventually get some Radaway, but only use it if your more than 25% ‘cooked’.
---
This isn’t something Bethesda can make happen. This is something Microsoft, Sony and Bethesda have to work together on.
---
Honey beasts drop the consumable, CND version of royal jelly do they not? I've heard it can't be used for cooking :o
---
If I could upvote this a million times, I would. Desperately needed!
---
No way in hell this will happen. Bethesda have already put themselves in a bind by being generous enough with the free atoms (and 'meh' enough with desirable atom shop content), that they shoved the elder's battlecoat into an atom pack just to try and shift some more of them.
---
For me, when I run into that problem (and I have...A LOT), scrapping whatever they're sitting in throws them into storage. Just storing whatever they're sitting on isn't enough.
---
I ended up putting my missle turrets onto rugs or tables. Less resources wasted when they disappear and less rebuilding involved.
---
It would really be nice to do, even if a little limited (so we don't go clearing out the entire forest or anything). I have a giant dirt mound in my house that can't be removed. I just suck it up cause it's such a nice spot for me... but still. I think I'd just like more to build, more than anything though.
---
Many on this sub seem to be on a religious crusade to downvote all and everything that in anyway criticises the game or BGS.
---
you sure?  i did get an enclave uniform
---
PS4? Servers are down.
---
This. Please. Bethesda.
---
Sounds pretty damn fun honestly
---
I think the stairs off the 1st foundation let her set it that way.
---
At the moment it‘s a little bit frustrating. Obviously it‘s because so many new player are on the servers but this has to be fixed soon!
---
I've played since the Beta started. Bethesda released the game with tons of bugs and still allowed it to launch on the set date, and the very same bugs encountered weren't fixed for about a month. Most people haven't gotten past that, but in reality, it's really improved
---
Whitesprings would be the perfect place for this.
---
maybe a legendary flame spray instead
---
Yes pleeeaaaaaase. I would buy it the *second* it went live.
---
Heck.

Yes if your in adventure mode you can go up to  them and it would tell you what button to click, also in the map you hover over there name and click there name and there would be little menu that would say team up or add to team something like that.(I don't know in survival but it should be the same) you can not do that in BR.
---
In this case it prob is JUST the game mode.
---
Honestly a great idea. Prewar money also makes more sense to me.
---
Not Captain's Dance again. I can't do it.
---
yeah but at least you can check it out a little! it seemed interesting at first. But got super boring very quickly
---
right? i‘ve had my fair share of idiots to deal with on here. and i LOVE bethesda. but loving something means giving constructive criticism.
---
Sadly that's not likely to ever happen. It would take up to much of the server space for when it load the world. If you thing loading is long now, try adding the information of where everything is supposed to be and whether or not someone has scrapped that thing and how long ago
---
Even having the purchased items sort to the top of each category would solve this problem.
---
awesome thanks :D so any proggresion made in adventure goes into survival and vice versa ?
---
Just move it and it will fix it all
---
On console there is the option to do that but if the person is already on a teN you dont have the option to.
---
Prewar money could be changed to misc.
---
Also use green thumb when you get the perk card to get double crop harvest. Use woodchucker perk card when you get it to get double wood.
---
I care, as I have been getting disconnects and Crash To Desktop regularly since NW went live, OP has a perfect right to post complaints on this sub, it's what it's for after all.
---
There is something very suspicious with all the down voting as of late, it has a pattern and it is becoming obvious.
---
Survival is pvp based and if there was nothing showing where anyone was no one would play it. Go to adventure if you want to farm steel.
---
Or let us trade cards in some ESL kind of minigame. You could make the cards have other properties and values that pertain to the game.
---
I've found a work around but it doesn't seem to last long
---
I wish we could just enter the vault without the timer. Hopefully we can once the full feature is released. There’s a lot to explore, especially when you start getting up there in levels. Granted it’s mostly holotapes and stuff, but exploring is half the fun. For example, you can pick up a pair of glasses in the locker room and wear them throughout the NW match, but there’s no time to find those if you just have 1-2 minutes every time.
---
Good point. Nuclear winter does remind of pubg in a way.
---
What other thread did I see you in?
---
Any explanation for the outage?  2.5 hours is excessive not to mention I just got home from work and really wanted to play lol.
---
The whole year road map shows vault raides and stuff in it, so theres gott be more
---
Excellent feedback. Thanks
---
Weird on PS4 that’s not even a thing
---
Haha the Pipboy is a trash UI, it has been since FO3, you dont have to die on a stupid hill
---
So, it works in a lot of BRs but it becomes stale to play that way, but if all you want to do is get to the end I would suggest this to anyone. That being said it is much more satisfying to sneak, kill a few stragglers a long the way (loot) and then 3rd party the last two teams...to win. People will hate you...but you will win and get some adrenaline pumping while you're at it.
---
Try this explanation: if he spends just 100 hours playing the game, total, then for the $20 (average price I’ve seen), he’s paying 20 cents per hour. 
---
When a two hour movie costs about $10, the comparison is a win.
---
Same here. The servers have been weird all day. Too many people?
---
What I don't understand is why can't I wear my purchased tour guide outfit in NW?
---
Fracking fool, kill this post and meet me in WV. I'll explain everything.
---
Yeah it sounds like this person just wants to play adventure and if they want to pvp than just attack someone
---
It not like rust, you have one character that keeps their stuff between servers.
---
Use this site to plan out your build. Saves levels later on adjusting it.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/
---
Collect as much adhesive springs and screws as you can during your leveling even if you think you have enough. At 50 you might need to craft items to scrap to learn certain weapon ir armor mods.
---
The mole miners drop miner suit scrap which when scrapped gives a black titanium so you dont have to go looking for nodes or deathclaws.
---
One thing I think is important is to keep the hacking perk. I got a minigun from a terminal and mowed 8 people down in a single battle.
---
Hey thank you!
---
I don't  mind people.making caps through vending because its a part of adventure. NW isn't the same game as adventure so why should the caps and xp cross over?
---
I have a shit ton of caps and xp in Fo 4. Should I get to bring them overm
---
I see them in a hard spot. 
---
I’ve made a post about this before, but I’m beginning to recognize nearly everyone who’s a challenge on the Xbox servers, there really isn’t that many people playing on in the Survival Servers.  
---
So they’re in a hard spot, do they want to do things in an attempt to bring some of their players from other modes onto that one? Or do they want to avoid risking turning what little players in that mode off from it?
---
My opinion; they won’t do much. They may wipe the bank characters again. And if this E3 stunt brings in a lot of players, and they’re feeling confident, they may do account bans or wipes, but I doubt they do anything that massively effects the game like a “clean character survival.” 
---
Adventure is their baby right now, maybe NW will be one day, but adventure is where all of their players are right now. And if they did something like that to survival, they would just be dumping all of those players into where they really don’t want them.
---
Yea it should be a risk that’s cheap af
---
Same here.. as soon as the cursor gets near to or over any team mate, crash and burn.. I feel your pain..
---
What about your settlements and all that which you build?
---
It’s not known yet
---
At level 15 you can get raider power armour, which is needed when it comes to exploring some areas at lower levels
---
Correct! Any loot you collect, any exp or caps you earn, it all transfers freely between Adventure and Survival mode. 
---
The only mode that works differently is Nuclear Winter, where the only thing that gets transferred to it is your SPECIAL points, and you don't get to keep any loot except for the rewards you unlock via levelling up through the Overseer ranks. You can get cosmetic items (including CAMP furniture!) and so forth from that, *and* every time you play a NW game, you earn caps and experience for Adventure/Survival, so you can level up and earn money in the "main" game while having fun in the battle royale mode!
---
Yeah I’m on PS4 so you’re probably right. This sucks lol .
---
On PS4, the issue is on Sony's end. Servers have been down for some time, the outage is widespread
---
I sell my extra plans for 9 caps, unless it’s really rare. If a new player teams up with me, I gift them with a full set of level appropriate armor, a well-modded pipe pistol and about 250-500 rounds of ammo.
---
I guess what I'm getting at is the mode really seemed to be lacking for PVP. 
---
I think it would fare better if you could see the next highest person ranked on your map plus the leader.
---
Oh good! I wanted to play some fallout tonight but we ended up binging four episodes of Lucifer and I felt like I had missed out. This makes me feel better haha.
---
I'm all on board with this idea.
---
Taking their time too. Thanks for posting, be great if everyone upvote so we can keep others informed.
---
Refrigerated backpacks do need a boost. They're expensive to craft (in terms of sheer bloody hours invested) and only give 60% longer on food, which is outdone by the top level of 'good with salt' perk. The only real bonus is freeing up two points in luck.
---
is this a trap?
---
Your camp? Yeah that stays saved where you build it unless you decide to move it somewhere else
---
I enjoy the battle royal, but I still love Adventure mode, more. My reasons are, I enjoy just touring and finding rare new Items, no pressure trying to survive for just a few moments and returning back to a vault full of delinquents punching each other. Too each there own I guess. Nonetheless I wish everyone the best, I  hope to see everyone in the wasteland.
---
Full auto drops pa fast, but you have to be kinda close because of all the recoil.
---
For the forest zone I think there are going to be random human npc's encounters that would be cool
---
We will definitely see.
---
I’ll say this, the 17th no nuclear winter. Bethesda needs to push all these new “pvp players” to continue to play the game, and it would be a good transition on their part to naturally announce changes to beta survival making it permanent in the next week. I was hoping we would see some sort of an announcement in the inside the vault today, but nothing.
---
Don't be afraid to die. Losing your junk is meaningless. Plus like 99% you can just go retrieve your stuff. The only time I lost my junk some dick stole it from me. But then he died shortly after and I took mine back plus all of his.
---
I dont mind the target on your back, I had a guy chase me all the way from the mire to flatwoods the other night before we finally fought for a couple deaths each, that was fun always watching my back, never knowing if I was in his sights and just catching glimpses of his red name at the top of my screen. The only problem i have is the spawn camping teams at train stations, you get killed and looted, kill one of them only to have the others snipe you before you can grab their bag. Oh well that's the wasteland I guess
---
There was a thread where what items sold were ranked.  Fusion cores were at the top and stimpacks were also up there.
---
At what? You lost me.
---
Stick to melee weapons at low levels since it's the least resource intensive weapon. Build and scrap boards regularly to learn spiked and other mods.
---
That would make more sense to me if crossplay between all systems did not already exist (it does even with PC)
---
They go up on Thursday they did not announce anything new except for a double xp weekend coming June 20-24th
---
90% of my friends list is 18 to 30, which im somewhere in between 😀
---
True but every time I log in this week it happens so it's quite a frustrating bug. I can load the gun, log out, log back in and it is now unloaded and giving an error about missing ammo. I do my gun maintenance at the end of a session when I recoup back at camp so I'm ready to go next session. 🤷‍♂️
---
This is getting fucking annoying.
---
But that takes a while. I’m talking like instantly
---
You keep saying circle jerk. Nearly every post is about the circle jerk on this sub. Of course it's a circle jerk. Reddit as a whole is a collection of circle jerks and exists so anyone can find a subject the enjoy and start jerking with others.
---
The reason you keep getting shit on is because you come in fists swinging. Dropping snooty remarks about how bad the game is, then insulting people who engage with you. Accusing people of using the same deceptive argument tactics that you yourself use. And all around being a toxic, hypocritical, waste of human flesh.
---
Claiming that you just want to have a non-circle jerk discussion about the game while calling people childish and delusional for conversing with you is just absurd, and speaks volumes about you as a person. If you act like a little bitch, you'll get treated like one.
---
Speaking of hypocritical, you didn't answer my question. Why are you here? This sub is a circle jerk. The discussion you want isn't here. Only children, idiots, and paid shills promoting a super shitty game that no one likes.
---
Why are you here?
---
Not until the issue with hackers is resolved, and really only around 50 a day max
---
You have a camp, which is a small mobile settlement that you can build (nearly) anywhere. It will also be fine when you go to different servers. (Unless somebody already has built a camp in the area yours was on that server, but it's fine because it saves everything you built)
---
Workshops are different, you pay caps to claim workshops around the map and they produce resources. Unlike camps these can be fought over in pvp and will not transfer over from server to server
---
Anything else?
---
If a guy is killing an entire server and the entire servers teams up against him he’s going to die, and once he dies he loses his precious shit so he’s not going to have the monopoly anymore.
---
I'm going to spend a little more time with it this weekend and really focus on going after people and see what I think.
---
Well some crossplay does exist. Gears of War shares servers with PC and Xbox but the one thing all those have in common is Microsoft. It’s easy to make crossplay if only one company needs to make the decision.
---
Are you talking about NW?
---
I came across this by accident building my current base. Seems like it works pretty well if you have an adjacent foundation at the right level. But I'd expect it to be patched now. If there's one thing they're on the spot patching it's people using building glitches for fun.
---
“My dad owns bethesda I can get you banned”
---
I tend to know exactly what I'm looking to accomplish when buying or selling from our delightful robot overlords, er, friends. That said, I still end up being smacked by a random douche (in PA with an All Rise or Grognak's axe 90% of the time).
---
Can't wait the 30-45s I need to finish my daily cap haul, turbo? Guess it's going to take 5 minutes now...
---
How else would you do it to make it instant?
---
What's your idea?
---
Personally, the current method works just fine
---
To clarify...at lvl 45 you could craft a 15, 25, 35  or 45.
---
You already have the story of how it was buggy at launch and that once a hate train gets going, it can pick up momentum fast. The other aspect to it is that Fallout is a very old franchise and it has diehard followers from the older games that hate change. Fallout 3 was shit on for not being turn-based isometric. There are some old school Fallout fans that have enough hate to start a train all on their own. 
---
Fallout 76 changed the formula again. Fallout has never been multiplayer - and this Fallout was multiplayer only. So it was guaranteed to generate haters. Coupled with a pile of bugs and unstable servers, the game got a ton of criticism in the early days.
---
Yep. Look at Fortnite.
---
I can play a game on my phone at work, then come home and resume on PC or console depending on which friends I want to play with. 
---
I think Bethesda just has to make the request.
---
Funny.  But, in the real world, there is no way on earth someone with the clout of Sony could be DDOS'd.  Small countries yes, but Sony?  No fucking way.
---
I found Fallout 76 for $17 on Amazon is that a good deal?
---
Perhaps, I guess everything will be revealed once people level up. It's just a case of waiting.
---
I have killed a bunch of them today - PC, Adventure Mode - and I haven't experienced this behaviour.
---
Did the do the 'carpet bomb' move in your case?
---
This is most curious...
---
Mostly the 'pile of dog shit attitude you squeezed out' tbh..
---
Well those are the only other way then going to add them then teaming up with them
---
Not talking about PC to Xbox I'm talking about PC to Xbox AND PS4. My wife and I play on PS4 with people on both Xbox and PC on dauntless for example. This already is something that exists outside of simply Microsoft.
---
Or just make it one of those pieces of junk that needs to be scrapped manually, like deathclaw hands or beer bottles.
---
It's due to the free trial and a new influx of people.
---
using a program like HWmonitor should tell you the Mhz and brand.  you wont need to buy 2 new sticks.  download that programs and show me what brand/mhz etc you have in there now
---
Wait til he takes a look at NW.  we’re showing our true colors here!
---
Just make sure you only keep minimal aid items on you as you drop some every death, and some can mean basically all. Lost about 60lbs of aid stuff the first time I played not realizing it.
---
No you didn't, actually quote him and stop putting words in the mans mouth. What you are saying that interview meant is something entirely different than what he said.
---
I’m talking about NW
---
You botched it
---
no need caps atm 
---
can trade for prime reciver plans if You have in bulk
---
With mats the key is dont get greedy.  Even if the mat is slightly rare.  If it sells for 30 dont get greedy and try to milk the extra 5 or 10 caps per from people.  I have a lot of repeat business and frequent price changes upsets those regulars.  Definately dont want to give up 1000 caps a week from someone just to get one sale where I make an extra 25%
---
Also, this goes for any type of vending, dont fill your machines with garbage just to get people there.  You will piss people off they paid 30 caps to get there and  all you have is half broken level 30 guns and golf clothing.  They wont buy anything from you even if they bbn need something you have AND on ps4 I've heard people literally foaming at the mouth screaming at the camp owner for having spent money to fast travel there and their machines are full of drek.
---
Finally, make sure you constantly refill your machines.  I restock about every hour.  Even of I only have just one new thing to add.  Never know when the guy willing to pay 300 caps for that rare plan is going to come through and you dont want to miss them.
---
It started out in Halo 2 as a game mode the players were voluntarily doing! Good times.
---
I knew some of it dropped but wasnt sure so I carried 15 stims and 15 waters. Thanks for the tip.
---
Lol, I c wut u did dere.
---
Most likely it's an old picture from before they changed the explosive damage.
---
Also bobbleheads, magazines, etc... tons of ways to boost damage that wouldn't show up in a picture.
---
Yes I did and I posted the link down below, here it is again:  www.pcgamer.com/amp/todd-howard-says-his-main-regret-about-fallout-76-is-not-having-a-free-beta/
---
Dear lord yes. I get why they need to regulate the amount of stuff in a camp to maintain server stability, but they went out of their way to edit all of the 'glitches' that made building fun, creative, and realistic looking in fo4. Especially the ones that let you repair existing objects easily and combine assets. And they have quickly patched the new found glitches of that type when they're found. The building in fo4 was basically the endgame and kept its popularity up. I wish they'd allow some flexibility in that respect here.
---
I'm 42, so I'm on the upper end of the age list.  I did play for a 4-5 hour session with an awesome pensioner (retiree) from the UK a few days ago, but haven't seen him online since.  He was running a bloodied unarmed build that was BRUTALIZING bosses.
---
He liked gaming online because it keeps his mind in shape, trying to build strong characters.  I could relate to that.  At 42, my body is starting to get slower and creakier, but my mind is sharper than it ever was, largely because of constant gaming and the analytics involved.
---
I have 1000 hours in this game... damn it, I wish I'd known about this.
---
Unfortunately there isn’t a way to add them to the team without adding them to friends. It’s a pre beta so I’m sure they will work out the team/match making issues. Like if you stay the whole battle you should atomically be replaced in same team in new server.
---
This is a troll post right? After a couple of matches, being the wait in the lobby just gets tedious. I'd love it if they implemented the Vault in its current state into the actual game world with the same requirements to unlock areas, holotapes etc., so people could freely explore it at their own pace, whenever they'd love to explore and listen to the lore.
---
Forcing people to wait longer in between matches, when the lobbies seemingly fill up fast enough that the time could be shortened (not sure if/how that would negatively impact loading screens etc.), would seem like a bad direction to go. Pretty much everyone I've talked to through the games seem to share an annoyance with the waiting, at least past rank 10 or so.
---
If possible shortening the lobby wait, and letting us explore the vault with its restrictions through adventure mode, if possible, seems like a better option to me, if it's actually a possiblity.
---
My dad works at Jagex
---
Check the lore
---
Double-dipping is a bug. That is all.
---
My previous post was plenty sufficient. Consoles can't mod. Anyway seeing this post had a completely different reason for private servers and it's been 5 months without these private servers. No one wins
---
Yeah I was only planning on doing the weapon challenge so I had all my adventure mode stuff on me, when I looked at the aid tab to eat something i literally had 1 daddy-o left and that was it Haha.
---
I think you summed it up perfectly. Forget grandiose plans like something that comes close to a 'scrap all' mod; a lot of people just want basic building pieces that were in FO4 but made painful by their absence here.
---
That is seriously cool!
---
Time for a nice little enclosed garden off to the side of my grand entrance :)
---
You could ask someone else to open it.. idk if it will work like that but I saw someone else asking like a week ago so maybe?
---
Last I heard AA had no effect on energy weapons. This all grapevine info so take it with a grain of salt.
---
Have fun, and explore. Take the game slow.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Always sneaking in the free stuff. How does that make sense? why make it free but then not mention to everyone that they can pick it up?
---
I’m a dev for Blizzard
---
I also think childish when I see WOW. But that doesn't make a game childish. It is just an art style.
---
You can float connector rods to create railing effects with poles. You just stack a rod in an object at a correct height. Attach additional ones to the end. Then scrap the object you set the first one on.
---
Power lines also make passable 'railings' in some cases.
---
What is childish is bashing Fortnite to feel good about FO76.
---
I have 57 unused level-ups. I only want one character and have all the combinations I want. That tells me that something is off with this system. I also cannot believe I have to unequip master shotgunner in order to collect brain fungus. It boggles the money mind.
---
It has been out since 10:17 AM according to tweets.
---
It is now 4:23 PM. I highly doubt it will be coming up soon. Even their games at E3 are impacted - making them look like crap.
---
I think at least 2 more hours of downtime, if not more.
---
The scenario he described is really not that unlikely if you are familiar with BR games before NW
---
False advertising is illegal which they did with the canvas bag issue. Why do you think they backed down from the "we aren't going to do anything about it, to here is 500 atoms, to okay we're getting the bags out to you"? Because what they did is extremely illegal in all of the EU under consumer protection laws.
---
\*narrows eyes\*
---
Really.
---
\*loads explosive laser rifle in Brotherhood\*
---
They have been down for 3 hours at this point. I haven’t seen a psn issue last this long. Here’s hoping they having it resolved soon.
---
I know what you’re saying and I’m saying it isn’t simple to do. It’s a very complex task to get companies like Microsoft and Sony to work together.
---
Auto laser weapons shred enemy health
---
This is happening to me (lvl 64) as well
---
There's no cross-play between the platforms, so this is not possible. Nor will it likely be in the foreseeable future as Sony generally have some pretty strict policies in terms of cross-platform deals, to my knowledge.
---
So it probably doesn't exist
---
What's your platform?  We all have stuff to give to make the early levels a little easier (food/water/ammo).
---
Apropos of nothing, but if you're talking about stacked stairs (the 1x2 all metal variant with posts), that's honestly very simple. The only big downside is you can't place your camp if you have to move it... so if you foolishly decide to watch a nuke from your teammate's CAMP while yours is inside said nuke... well time to rebuild from scratch.
---
glad to hear this... I suck at PVP and it has been keeping me out of NW... might give it a try tonight...
---
So long as I can choose to make my new toy not shoot nerf darts, i'll be pleased :P
---
Poseidon power plant generates them for you
---
Probs because people want the cool stuff without a care for the lore, granted X-O2 looks badass but you can't retcon the armour because it looks cool, it'd ruin the entire lore of the Enclave
---
Best way is to take a power plant yard and sit on it for a few hours. Dont even have to stay there just lock the collector.
---
Now I think they allow you to change to a different world if your camp wont load
---
Are you on ps4? Psn is down.
---
What’s the legendary player thing??? I’m intrested
---
Two minutes is plenty! I was laying down in the vault bed taking a nap waiting yesterday.
---
Hah, depends on how active your server is
---
I'm on PS4, probably downed about 10-15 Scorchbeasts in Adventure/Survival Mode since the release, in a bunch of different areas, ranging from 50-80. Can't say I've encoutered any kind of "instant death" zone around them at any point.
---
You are correct, although I can play ark cross platform on PS4 but the rest is true.
---
He's saying the person lied just to mess around with you
---
They weren't, and neither were you.  Seems fair.
---
You did say that.  You can read it again if that'd help.
---
We stopped discussing fallout after the first few comments.
---
I'm glad you cleared that up, I was afraid you were calling me weird because you're bad at communication and had to fall back on insults instead of discussing that thing you weren't discussing.
---
I'm disappointed that you're done, I was getting a lot out of it.
---
Because while Sony might be lead in sales, they're assholes when it comes to asset protection
---
I have about the same and just learned about it yesterday so don’t feel bad lol
---
But did you take his junk and perform the ritual T-bag?
---
Hahaha i watched tv instead
---
Take over one of the workshops at the power stations. I normally use the Poseidon because it’s easy with really low level scorched.
---
You can also check players vending machines, there are some who sell them for a decent price.
---
Otherwise you will have to search for them, there is one on the roof of the nuke cola factory. 9/10 when I go there it is still there
---
The sentury boots at white springs will trade them for a few shotgun shells or 5.56 bullets.
---
Same. For me ESO and FO76 were not very good at the start. Recently have given them both another chance. I really like both of them. Although I still need to learn what perks and what to do for farming shit. If anyone wants to add me on ps4 I'm ILOVELAMP328
---
I downloaded it yesterday. Only slightly buggy and it's a touch laggy but that may only be a personal problem. So far it seems ok.
---
Dude. You didn't. What you said and what he is saying in that article are two very different things.
---
Words have meaning. You said you literally quoted him, you didn't.
---
Either quote him or don't but don't claim you literally quoted him when you absolutely did not.
---
I think that's a hard question. The workshops are short living by design. Bethesda intended workshops were constantly changing owner. They don't want you just build a giant base and wait for your resources without effort. But you got a point... the PvP is hard and requiere a lot of specs in order to have a opportunity. It's possible, but just for a minority of the player base, and that's a problem. The disconnect is not the bigger issue for the workshop, but the workshops were not intended to be big constructable personal areas.
---
In Adventure mode they need change the complete design in order to be fun to build up. A lot the players like you wanna some similar. Eliminate completely the PvP aspect and do a base, maybe without the resources and limiting to just one for player on the server. And of course, letting you get back to a server. But it's not the actual problem of workshops.
---
The crashed space ship will be raider base, and somewhere in the forest will be civilians base
---
Bloodied and assassin do, not much else I'm afraid afaik
---
If you’re xbox, i sell 100% cores for 75c ea
---
Hey, if they're wanted... it's fair game. For a level 5, I would have watched their stuff for them, though.
---
Vault Raids are coming in this update, other content as well
---
Any word on the new lore regarding X-02 and Hellfire? This completely breaks the lore Bethesda themselves created...
---
Who the heck downvotes a "Help" post?
---
Nah. Just snuck off, silent assassin-style.
---
I mean, how much good junk could he possibly have on him at that point?
---
Just coward my way into the upper canopy of Tanagra and dropping in on the final survivors!
---
Oh in that case I agree. Free week doesn't help with that either... Better launch that new battle royale gamemode with maximum server  stress right away.
---
It's so dumb that they literally point out where you are so you become the biggest target to be killed. 
---
Why can't they just keep the score, but remove location all together. Make it pike your playing day z where you can see the map, but that's it, there's no live update info, hell remove fast traveling all together and let people actually survive in the wasteland if they want a more hardcore survival mode that isn't just story based where you can avoid pvp.
---
Also, just stating I hate pvp and can't stand the feeling I get if being on edge the entire time, but at least do it right, it's a joke how the "harder" mode feels in 76.
---
Ultracite PA could definitely benefit from some Bethesda love.
---
Right after the game is out of open beta
---
Sure, but then we get into server stability issues, no? The budget exists to keep shit manageable.
---
Besides... how  much larger do they have to be? I've seen some MASSIVE CAMPs, with TONS of stuff in them.
---
Always on my day off.
---
So regular Raider armor plans do drop from events? Been searching for any of these since game launch without any luck
---
&gt;Games also were less complicated back then. 
---
This is not an excuse to release an unfinished game.   
---
Releasing a game that is simply not finished has nothing to do with complexity.  
---
You're seriously telling me that because Fallout 76 is "complicated," that the developers were not capable of seeing how weak heavy weapons were?  Or how ridiculously fast that they break, even with gunsmith maxed out? Or that entire items get deleted from your camp for no apparent reason?  Or that it's possible to get stuck in power armor?  
---
These problems were not present in the game because it was "complicated." They were present because the game was simply not finished.
---
Ok got it
---
Good choices young grass hopper son
---
He had a friend. I'm sure he's fine... right? 😳
---
Cloth is great for making gunpowder
---
Did yo uchange the settings to be shorter than 5 mins?

That’s easy, Sir. Please just go here: https://discord.gg/xVyXPhK

Ad Victoriam!
---
For the Enclave
---
I popped a wanted level 35 last night... I had to fast travel across the map three times so I took his lead and steel. By 35 you should know better then get a bounty.
---
Yeah I hear there's  a couple more of his story out there, but I'm brand new to the game. I'm trying to avoid spoilers but this gives me hope that the story part of these bethesda games still has a future despite the corporate bungling of late.
---
Echoing everyone's spot on feedback I'd just like to add, it was somewhat of a shocker ( to me at least) to see youtuber's that I followed go from, hey yeah, this is all real fun to hell no, Bethesda is evil incarnate for pushing this game. Now, I just follow 1 youtuber. Fallout 76 is where I go everyday for a few hours after work, my sanity maintained.
---
He's probably turned off the game forever... and written your name in his "big book of grudges", to be honest.
---
It's up now
---
The servers are down currently, but I would love to help you with my level 50 character. 
---
What level are you? What stage of the quest are you in?
---
Was it Halo or Counterstrike that did it first? I remember a Counter Strike custom game mode with heavy fog and a super zombie (normally in a Predator skin), but don't recall if it was 1.6 or Source.
---
I do know that it was 1.6 players doing 1 vs ##, with the ## being knives only, that lead to Left 4 Dead.
---
Its been since the Nuclear Winter update and im on xbox. We had one at red rocket where I was watching my gf defend it from three level 50 Scorchbeasts with the help of four friends and once they were all dead, about 60 seconds after they died there was one section of red rocket mega stop (the courtyard with the picnic tables) where if they stepped in it they would just suddenly die, no matter how high level, power armor or not. Near instant death. This just happened to us in Cranberrybog near the Overgrown Forest or whatever in the south.
---
I know it sounds selfish, I broke off a 4 year relationship and turned down quite a few jobs lined up to make time for this kind of stuff. 
---
It was about a year after I graduated college and was working 50 hours a week only to come home to 'spend' time with my girlfriend that I just finally realized that I was fucking done with trying to adhere to societal standards. Broke it off with the gf, quit the job, moved back home etc.
---
Now I work 3 days a week, 5 max, and have all the time in the world. I've been able to help my parents as they get older, I've become a huge part of my nephews and nieces life and most of all. If I literally don't feel like doing shit for a week, I can literally just lay around in my underwear playing games. I know it's selfish but damn do I love it.
---
The prices on these are terrible, but if you used pre-war money it would be kinda overpowered, because you can easily just get a government supply drop and get that 100 or 101 pre-war money, but I still like this idea
---
I had this issue in a few matches and legit thought no one was talking till I heard a small murmer. 
---
I think I fixed it though it may entirely be coincidental.
---
While the game was open, I opened the headset menu on PlayStation ( (Settings) &gt; \[Devices\] &gt; \[Audio Devices\]). Clicked on the volume thing to check if my voice was loud enough. THEN (and i think this is what fixed it). Went to "Output to Headphones" -- Flipped it to Chat Only
---
Saved
---
Then Flipped it to all Audio.
---
TLDR:  
---
Go to Output Settings and flip it to Chat only and then back to All Audio.
---
See I joined for the same reason. My three major complaints though kinda ruin the game for me. One, trolls. Trolls everywhere. I can't be near a player without getting shot at. Two, enemy scaling. One minute they're level 15s and then suddenly you walk where a high level has been and they're 60s. And 3, constant server issues. But that said, the game has promise and I do enjoy it. Now if I had some people to play it with lol.
---
I think the top 3 should definetely stay, but as it at one point was, be based on player kills. Especially with NW having just released, you often see people who just left Vault 76 on fresh characters, anywhere from lvl 3-10, be in either of the top 3 spots because everyone's off playing the new game mode.
---
Seen a lot of bullies, ranging from 40-350ish, go for the low levels to farm kills, presumably for their amusement. While I'm having a great time ridding the new players of those pests,. I'd love for the players doing this to be visible on my map for my convinience of course, but in the current state of Survival as such few people are playing it with NW having just released, it must be a discouraging experience for new players getting camped by lvl 200s geared to the teeth as they first place down their camp.
---
2h does more damage but is slower than 1h. I prefer 2h over 1h an unarmed because if the extra damage especially in pvp and even in pve. Unarmed is out of the question because you can use it while wearing power armor which is almost necessary late game.
---
3 cloth and 8 wood probably
---
Things have been better yes I don’t play with any of those so I would not know
---
Agreed, but I do think OP has a point about tweaking the budget value of some of the smaller and less complex items. Kinda hard to fill that castle you painstakingly build if you don't have room in your budget to place posters and plants and shit.
---
🙏 thank you.. old yeller 😂
---
I don't think that falls under the NW banner though
---
Not at all, that doesn't do much damage anyways. This is just seeming like a kill zone. I'd post the clip but this sub wont give me the option.
---
What does that mean? O.o
---
Probably... but I was level 50 before I found out that picking a lock in someone's camp was punishable by death. Who knew?
---
I enjoyed New Vegas when, it came out, despite bugs. I feel the same way, about 76.  I don't see why a lot of them got so upset.
---
PSN is done for me
---
I’m back in like sin
---
Some have tested and said it doesnt work but i have no real confirmed info.
---
They already have. Cross play is a thing now between all companies and has been for a while.  Both Microsoft and Sony has made it clear they are willing to make stuff cross play and the reason was Bethesda themselves calling out Sony on refusing cross play. It was Bethesda that shamed Sony into cross play and not that it's a thing Bethesda is one of the only companies being nearly dead silent about adding any sort of cross play in the near or far future.  Simply saying it's hard is dumb. Making a game in general is hard. Crating, designing and coding a game is much harder then restructuring the servers to cross play. The hardest thing would be to make sure all 3 platforms stay on the SAME content updates and bug fixes simultaneously and even that would be harder than adding cross play itself.
---
*enters nuke launch code...target...brotherhood compound*
---
Justification? The coming fall update
---
It's a sneak peak for a reason, they will polish it and will most likely make it faster when its released.
---
I think a few more games support cross platform as well, but in general it sounds like it's quite hard to strike a deal Sony is cool with. They do seem to have, and continue to, move towards being more open to it.
---
100% - they could use a lil’ creative injection. 
---
From a CK standpoint - I think they could very easily accomplish this with a few unique material swaps and maybe a hat or two
---
No it was 15 minutes but I was in shock for a while so it only caught the last little bit. It was like a 20 minute ordeal
---
Na, the game was fun as fuck when it launched. I don't give a shit what anyone says.
---
its just a cooler with some shoulder straps
---
If you find any Nuka-shine be sure to drink it. It gives you great buffs.
---
If it happens I was here let it be known
---
honest question, I thought they changed it so you can't kill people or damage people's bases, so how do you get wanted now?
---
We know how to use the functions maybe we jist choose not too use game chat cause I dont wanna hear fckn screams or ragers
---
For stimpak diffusers try vendor hoping at different player camps. Have found several that have had them for sale, as you only need to use them, not craft then to count toward merit badge. However prices can fluctuate like crazy. The cheapest I have found them is 20 caps each, most expensive was around 1000 caps. 
---
As far as plasma grenade plans are concerned... good luck ! Personally I do not think they are in game right now. I have followed different post/ web searches for how/ where  to find these plans, but as of yet nothing. Some people have claimed to have found them, HOWEVER no one has ever posted a video of themselves actually crafting any. I have played since beta, have two characters over level 120. Close to 1000 hours of game play over 100 of those hours the past month just exploring ash heap and doing ash heap quests and not much else, still nothing. I have enough ore from breach and clear and load bearing to completely rebuild all of West Virginia lol. I even recruited a couple buddies to search vendors/ player vendors but still nothing. I also thought that maybe is was a level specific drop, like how the odds for level action rifle plans spawning at grafton station were best between levels 14 to 45. Before that or after that level range odds were crazy slim, so I started a third character and after reaching level 10 headed to ash heap now level 35 and...still nothing. Another possibility is that is seems with very patch/update the loot/ drop tables change.  Some quests that used to drop certain plans no longer drop said plans. Dear Bethesda if this is done unintentionally, please fix it. If it done intentionally please add a section to the patch note as to what has changed and why. Don’t get me wrong love the game. LOVE IT, I personally don’t even mind the grind of certain thing- just found my 5th deathclaw hide last night-! But there is definitely a huge difference in grinding for an item you know is in game and an item that is not. Sorry so lengthy and for venting at the end, but hope this helps.
---
Like one button/key that cycles through a toggle: Show All, Show Owned, Show Unowned
---
If it happens let it be known I was here
---
That's a lot of loot, they may be a duper bro.
---
It boils down to Sony being a dick about their software. That's the whole "shitty mods on ps4" reason, and that's why Sony is going to get its ass outsold if they don't make like game devs  and read a flipping reddit thread every now and again
---
I did, he clearly states the game shouldn't have been released when it was. It needed actual beta testing, not just released with the 24 hours of beta they had.
---
That would be awesome, those small contactors give me a headache when building something big.
---
As flaired its a suggestion, i know its a sneak peak im giving feedback
---
I know it's not an excuse for a lot of people but I came into fallout 76 like I did every other Bethesda title I've played:
---
Expecting bugs.
---
Expecting imperfections.
---
So I wasn't nearly as disappointed.
---
I've been playing since the beta. Lived in the exact same spot outside of Morgantown like I did in the beta.
---
The game has gotten so much better with new content.
---
I just want a place anywhere tool.
---
Well, I think it boils down to smart builds. 
---
Keep it one story. Limit lighting. Do more with less. 
---
Multi-floor builds, with lights everywhere, and tons of foundation use... these are all super expensive... and wall decoration falls in there, too.
---
Gotta prioritize.
---
It’s not just the difficulty part. It’s also expensive. Sony has been very flaky about crossplay because of the expense and the fear of losing exclusive titles.
---
Agility: Dodgy (3) avoid 30% damage for 30 AP a hit
---
Give you 1000 caps for it
---
Guess I’m not sure because I never played Counter Strike!
---
Next inside the vault might have some info on that.
---
Itll be available through the atom shop for 3500 atoms because its Bethesda and they're just waiting on the chance to creation club our asses
---
I was thinking maybe the leader is shown and whoever is the rank above you. However if someone leaves the room that could be very annoying if its who you were after.
---
Has there been much said about changes they are looking at for this game mode?
---
It sucks ass for us. Five + minutes to find a match, one minute to connect to the match, another minute to load the vault. So lame.
---
Hopefully the sneak peak leads to an open beta and they actually FIX this.
---
For me, I am always looking for .308 and shotgun shells. If you have your ammo priced at 1 cap each, then I always buy quite a bit. I'm also always looking for weapons plans I don't have.
---
yes please
---
r/woosh
---
Honestly it was the best game ever. It was better than any game out there on the market. Bethesda is the best company out there. Please suck my dick Todd Howard. /s
---
I've played literally over a hundred matches now. This hasnt happened once
---
Why
---
Yeah must be
---

---
Looks like there should be a few things
---
I'm not sure what the rules are anymore. You NEVER see Wanteds on the Adventure Mode servers anymore, though. That's why I jumped at the chance to end his young life.
---
Red dead who? FO76 ALL DAY BAYBAY!
---
Back on as well, cheers for sharing mate!
---
Part of possum challenge I need 1 more
---
And that's why they have this two week testing period. They'll probably figure it out. They need better cheat detection though. Kinda like how mmorpgs have that immediately know when people are cheating or hacking.
---
You on Xbox?
---
I feel stupid. Captain obvious.
---
No but why 1000
---
Dont attack the robot at whitespring
---
:’(
---
Sure, but then I can't build THAT at my C.A.M.P.?
---
Just wait till you figure which is the best power armor... Hint: it's not ultracite or x-01.
---
Yup, I need 2 more
---
It's one of the challenges break down 5 deathclaw hides...don't do it till you get challenge
---
I’m really hoping all the poster and magazine cover references for the Communist Prime becomes a thing. 
---
Servers become wars between communist vs. capitalist factions.
---
We relive the McCarthyism of our grandparents generation. 
---
All the while two giant robots duke it out and hurl nukes at us on the whitesprings golfcourse
---
Agreed, it's not all that hard, some people have even managed retextures in FO4 on ps4. So if some dude on his parents computer can get around sonys assets asshole to get some new looks to things, it should be as easy as a soft update to the server for the all mighty Beth Softworks
---
Also a sort by price option
---
Try a sneak build. I don't even have the best legendary gun and I managed to pull this off.
---
[https://gfycat.com/consciousdearfirebelliedtoad](https://gfycat.com/consciousdearfirebelliedtoad)
---
The game is fun i picked it up this week. I don't understand why people just jump the gun. There's alot of content to explore ,Finding Plans and the lore is super deep.
---
Time for bethesda to drop the ban bomb
---
No they made a statement about it I just can’t find it
---
They did adjustments for the turrets that vastly reduced the cost. 
---
Maybe more improvements in the future.
---
Try playing it again, most of the things that appear to be choices actually aren't.  Add to that that most of the skill checks ultimately mean nothing, usually just granting a bit of extra exp or money.
---
&gt; I would hope that even if its still in beta.. the NW BR mode will be permanently up before the content block of the same name expires a few months from now..
---
The caveat is PC. You can’t do that on PC. I’m still not going to share my account with anyone, I’d be terrified of them messing something up.
---
Nobody:
---
Hackers: "Nothing personnel kid"
---
Excellent, thanks man!
---
sent you a direct message
---
I picked up a long bow mod yesterday.
---
I like the cable idea.  Thanks.
---
Sounds a bit like fo4, choices dont actually do anything.
---
Pic?
---
If they add 10 more seconds to that naked he-man boxing mob Ill run towards the nearest living thing and kill it.
---
I'm level 20 and it gets worse.  Once you get to lvl 15 you only get perk packs every other level.  Once you get to 20 it's even lower like one every 3 levels.
---
Also there's an error with daily challenges that you can complete them once per match instead of once per day.  Yesterday (place 4 CAMPS) allowed you to get 1 pack per game easily.  Today's is nearly impossible to do consistently (Use 6 Stimpaks, Expired and Extra don't count.)  
---
It's going to create a lot of balance issues because some people unlocked nearly all cards through the error and some people will have hardly any decent cards despite playing for a LONG time.  I really hope they tweak it so you don't receive duplicates or get packs more often.  In it's current state I think a lot of people will quit around level 20 because progression becomes nonexistent.
---
Balancing my stash is a game in itself. I take 100 pounds out and then suddenly I need 150 in space but already at 800 already. lol
---
Easy fix, take out vats like in nuclear winter.
---
If you’re hidden, plasma grenades do a good bit of damage. For everything else, aim for the head and wings!
---
Simple but great! I love it! :)
---
Sure, I'll post it when I'm home. Give me 39 minutes.
---
pick a lock at someones camp, pick a lock at someones workshop, pick a lock on an air drop someone else called in = wanted status.
---
Yeah. We will see if Bethesda can with this.
---
FIRE!
---
See that's not unreasonable. And I assume you're camped near low level areas. But I'm talking the people who try vendor basic gear that dropped off random mobs while they're camped in the more.
---
Literally, your solution is the whole reason for the  original post.
---
Yeah... Wouldn't bet against that at all
---
Fundamentally, the problem is that the criticism of Bethesda is deserved, while that of Fallout 76,not so much. But people aren't making the distinction.
---
It IS possible (and is my personal opinion on the reality) for Bethesda to be acting badly AND for Fallout 76to be a good game.
---
Jesus.. 350k. I just returned to the game at level 59 and I have like.. 100 caps to my name, and fast traveling cuts into that pretty heavily.
---
my trouble is server not responding everytime i load into a lobby...and yes also the 5 minutes it takes to get into the lobby..probably spent about 1 hr trying to get in..after about 10 attempts and 9 disconnects i got in once.  wondering if its a problem.on my.end or what..i ran a speed test and am getting 45mbs download speed..can play adventure mode no issues...frustrating
---
If that's all it is then would it not be easier to just you know....not add straps and put it in camp? :(
---
Yeah the wires, even in fallout 4, are just really... Barbaric?
---
Thank you for your reply! What if you want to go for a stealthy playstyle? PA isn't really stealth right?
---
That update brought my night of gaming to an end it took me so long to figure out what had happened.
---
Brilliant. I couldn't have written it half as good as this but my thoughts exactly. The issue is people don't understand that this was never going to come out a "complete" and polished game. These games hardly ever do (see Destiny for example). They didn't falsely advertise the game or anything, people just threw their toys out the pram because they had been spoilt by Bethesda beforehand.
---
I love Bethesda. I support them 100% because they don't aim to milk us dry but instead provide us with genuinely good games. People should do also.
---
I’ll give ya 8k caps for it.
---
I personally with NW have experienced it twice. I’m rank 6. On top of that there are plenty of hills and cliffs so the opportunity is very much there and that is all the described scenario requires in order to happen. Also as someone who has played a lot of BR games. Yes, it can happen quite often. All it takes is joining a squad of randoms who don’t communicate in any way and you soon picked off one by one until you end up in the smallest of circles against a full squad
---
Same.
---
I had to kill a level 157 wanted player who kept killing low level players
---
often people are chasing lore or messing with perks
---
For anyone saying microsoft has a more stable network than sony just remember that ps4 has about twice the people compared to the xbox 1.
---
why don't you install the free trial and see for yourself if its dead or not?
---
I think this would take a really long time though. Like that last ring would have 40 players and it still. That idea appeals to me though total chaos.
---
I just wish people would use conduits. They are super easy. Not perfectly clean but better than wires running everywhere inside your camp.
---
By the time I make space to finally stash some scraps, 1 hour has passed in real life and my character is about to die from of thirst and starvation
---
oh okay, thanks
---
I like using power conduits. Like the one that can clip through walls to make it look cleaner between rooms.
---
Fair enough, but I have a single story 6x2 with all crafting, four venders, five turrets, and eight purifiers, and I have a small spattering of decorative junk with bare min of lighting. Barely have space at all. Some things like crafting and purification units (not the ground ones) are a bit unnecessarily heavy on budget. Roofs and turrets cost the same from what I've seen
---
Thanks for this. It's been pissing me off trying to find it!
---
Having an actual functioning fridge at your Camp would be useful if it actually kept food good much long than your inventory. I'd love to be able to travel back and pick up more food instead of eating/selling it when it's close to going bad. It would be a useful item for sure.
---
Yes, but largely because PVP was clumsily implemented for a long time, satisfying neither PVP players or PVE players; then it was almost completely separated from adventure mode, so only the friendly players were left in adventure mode.
---
BTW, Amazon has this for $17 right now ..I was able to walk into BestBuy and do a pricematch and they threw in the PIP boy chain and the FO book with the deal...all for $18 inc taxes.
---
I'll be honest in saying I loved FO3 and I stayed clear of FO-76 mainly due to the onslaught of CONSISTENT bad reviews all over the place. Then I played the console version at a buddy's place last weekend and I was surprised that I actually enjoyed the 4 hrs I spent in the online game world.
---
Unfortunately, social media outlets now seem to dictate the gaming reviews more so than in the past when only online sites would do reviews .
---
Down in the mines? If they're grounded, go for it!
---
Because people love to rip shit apart without trying it for themselves. It was buggy, but at least it didn't crash 24/7 like Pubg and Dauntless at release. And 400lbs storage was just...dumb as all hell. But I have always loved this game for a few reasons.
---
1. I've always wanted to play a co-op fallout, even if I had to play a companion I'd be happy.
---
2. The community is amazing.
---
3. Most of the bugs are funny little graphical glitches like someone appearing like slenderman while in power armor.
---
So my opinion? People can't make up their own mind and play follow the leader :)
---
Level 20. Have 20 different perks available to me. Got duplicates over a dozen times. I really want a select few perks. Why is it so random.
---
ahh this explains my psn constantlu sigining itself out about 8hrs ago..
---
Making the game free would probably worsen the microtransaction models of FO76 and make the community worse. That is the unfortunate consequence. Plus FO76 has three game modes while those BR games only has variations of the same BR gameplay.
---
I don't have a source for this, but I have heard it before. Would like confirmation that Bethesda made a statement like that.
---
I will say that Bethesda has historically incorporated feedback into their games. As I understand it, the Skyrim Hearthfire DLC was well received and they responded by creating the settlement system in Fallout 4. People wanted to be able to build F4 settlements anywhere, and in F76 we have workbenches AND a portable camp.
---
The last line of your post feels like it summarises Bethesda's view on the game right now, kinda. Why dedicate all your resources to fixing and building a really fun game that buyers actually wanted when we could just add Battle Royale because it's popular right now and fuck what everyone else thinks.
---
Ofcourse the player base is gonna be above normal since it's free for a week.
---
Right now everyone has moved away from survival for nuclear winter, so the servers are a bit emptier. However I can reassure you, it is not dead at all.
---
Oh good, I didn’t have quite enough radiation already!
---
Heavy weapons and energy weapons make more damage and the degradation feels right.
---
How about using both? Like "Fox (HúHú)". I'm sure either way it will work out. Thanks for asking anyway ;)
---
Been playing since BETA and still never seen one in the wild. They won’t stalk me 😭
---
I still can't get that damn thing to work right :/
---
Did this go from 400 upvote to 0 ? wtf
---
As long as random stats don't start to edge out actual news, then sure why not?
---
Hey, it's better then the porn noise of people punching at each other.
---
Half of them are bugged.
---
Do this...
---
Discover this place...
---
Revive...
---
Take pic of...
---
Kill blank...
---
A bunch have to be done multiple times before they count.
---
I have to disagree.  You can nearly double your damage, get consistent PA, ammo, Stims, etc.  There's a lot of really strong perk cards. I'm Lvl 20 but I've got around 40-50 perk cards from grinding the CAMP daily.
---
I have a little over 300 hours logged and only looked at them once early on and never went back. I agree 100% with this post! Hopefully The Toddfather will allow this idea.
---
I just bought this game and I hope the OP is not a bot planted by Bethesda.
---
&gt;. Even todd howard himself admitted recently this game was a massive screw up to release it when they did.
---
Literally quoting you. Now literally quote Todd Howard where he said what you said.
---
I was lvl30ish when I found out people could craft turrets at their base. I thought the building was a place to loot. So I put on my perk cards started picking the lock. Next thing I know I'm getting shafted by gun turrets. I destroy them, then 3 lvl100+ show up and just ended my life as I knew it, repeatedly! I licked my wounds and tucked my tail. Walked away slowly, still not know what had just happen. Later that day a friend filled me in... 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤣😂😂
---
Had I known what i was doing I'd probably do it again. But maybe a little more discreet. 😉
---
 I now do more giving than taking. Always dropping chems and such at the vault for the lil people. I know the struggles coming up &amp; wish people was so much more giving back then. 🤣😂
---
I am so sorry for my reply..I misunderstood your comment.
---
And the constant feeling of being in an orgy as everyone punches the shit out of each other
---
I actually cannot argue against that.
---
It hopefully will prove to be only a joke about a darker time in Bethesda's history, when they didn't fix their games and promised gimmicks that  they probably never intended honor
---
What is nuclear winter?
---
Lol do you know how under-armor works? Pretty self explanatory. I do understand that gripe about outfits, but atleast underarmor should work
---
I stand by my statement until evidence is produced to the contrary.
---
Tip: to get the wire go on the backside with out the connector. The side where the two pipes stick out. The front, the game will target the wall and not the conduit.
---
Nuke the hell out of it!!

I appreciate the response.  I have been server hopping more frequently than I prefer looking for vendors.  I am not making any progress so I thought I might as well just ask.  As far as the plasma grenade plan, couldn’t agree more. People say that it spawns during Ash Heap events, but I have done A LOT of them and haven’t seen a plan for anything, let alone that one.  Between that and the deathclaw hide scarcity, I am losing it with the RNG.
---
Heavy weapons have been buffed, so they’re actually good now.
---
Energy weapons are actually good now. Explosive energy weapons were removed from RNG, meaning they’re worth a lot.
---
Power armor bug (guessing you mean invulnerability) has been fixed to my knowledge
---
LOTS of Challenges are bugged. Most of the Possum: Musician badge, for example.
---
And according to the Challenges, I've STILL never killed a single Scorchbeast Queen. 🙄
---
? I dont see one
---
Somebody was taking the same strategy as you just more patient.:)
---
Just got an email from Bethesda confirming the shipment of the canvas bag
---
Oh yeah, I hear you bud.  I have the exact same issue. Died because of it too a couple of times.  Just learned to check my ammo more often.  It actually has improved the rest of my game too as I reload a lot more often on all of my guns now.  Small silver lining lol
---
Just be glad you dont have a laser gatling.  The glitch on that one puts a new core in your weapon every time you pull it out so you end up with dozens of half used cores in your inventory.  I used 25% of 18 seperate cores on the queen one night swapping for adds.  Crushed it into scrip about 15 minutes later when I realized what had happened.  I can laugh about it now lol
---
Couple of hours but I'll see what I can do.
---
watoga usually has 2-3 laying around and 3 power armor spawns, then at the firebase near the station another power armor, and sometimes one laying next to it. if your out and just needing a couple quick.
---
Without VATS, this is just another looter shooter with a fallout skin. Sure it's fun and flavorful. But fallout was an RPG.
---
Dont know for certain. But I think you can kill their animals, brahma bulls an such. Or pick their locks on water purifiers or extractors. Will make you go wanted.
---
Sames.
---
Put the connector (nipple) through the wall. Just the connector. The rest stays on the side you are on. Then pull out another connector and attach to the end with no nipple.
---
ah right didn't see the underscore haha
---
Ugh ugh aha ugh smack smack... And I thought the music on fortnite was irritating jumping off that flying school bus.
---
This is exactly what I thought of. It was almost better to be a bomb than a player.
---
Show me the evidence saying it’s not supposed to be obtainable then.
---
If they did this, it would have to be at least 2:1 steel to screw/spring/gear. The rarity slows you down and forces you to scavenge occasionally. Steel is way too common to turn into rare junk at the ratio you suggest. Even 2:1 would change the player experience a lot.
---
You must not play much. If you are going to give the through the effort of swapping your entire build for this game mode you may as well make a new character. Are you kidding ME with your arguements dude? You have made ZERO valid points.
---
You'll just have to "silence" them the old fashioned way after the match starts.
---
It's BEEN a popular thing but people are starting to get tired of the mode with the myriad of other games hopping on the trend. I don't know if I believe a battle royale mode in a game reknown as buggy and broken at it's core will be a game seller, although it might encourage people to buy a few atoms who already bought the game or play on Xbox Game Pass.
---
"...ensure longevity and more content." - yes, however it doesn't ensure FUN/GOOD content. They are already milking players with the Atom Shop, the more players that buy Atoms, the more Atom shop content they'll make as opposed to putting it into the base game.
---
Excuse me, did i not say he allowed himself to take the full blow of the thing? It was his mistake to not put the A team on it like they should have which they have parts of it working on the dlc now. Todd Howard also doesn't have a choice about being the face of Fo76, I'm sure by your response you don't know shit about corporate but his specific designation in the company is both fallout and elder scrolls, unless he offloaded that work to his parent company zenimax he has to be the face of it every single time.
---
Check under challenges.
---
That's just the aura it puts off. All around it.
---
They are promoting the game, it’s 50% everywhere for this week, nuclear winter is the new update which has a pretty cool battle royale mode.   Play the free trial and make your own judgement unlike many who listened to all the haters at launch and seem confused now why it had so much hate for a pretty great game IMO
---
I get your complaints. They are a bit of a problem but I overall enjoy the game.
---
Okay, I'm glad to hear it applies to CAMPs. I thought I noticed it at a workshop the other day, but I couldn't be sure. Thanks for that. Hopefully they get their act together and do another big patch update
---
I remember people on r/fallout were bitching about no radio host, just because they haven't played the game for longer than two hours. Those posts got heavily upvoted. And there were more things like this.
---
That's why I dont play online games on PC.
---
I know there’s a lot of really strong perk cards, I win about 75% of my games, that’s why I’m such a high level. 
---
I probably have one of the best perk decks right now and I’m doing just as good as if I had my starting deck, as there is a bug going around that forces your starting deck to be used. 
---
You just need to learn what guns to pick, and how to pvp. Gatling gun and combat shotguns are the best weapons right now whether you agree or not is a personal opinion but they are. Gatling two shot if you have good aim, and shotguns two hit if you have good aim too, which you don’t need cards for.
---
I get it that a company wants to make money. Bethdesda could have just made an awesome game that everybody wants to play. Instead they released a incomplete game, which they had to cut the price of the game in half shortly after the release. Something that could have been avoided if the game wasn't so full of bugs AND getting dumped off servers AND servers going down at least 1X a week.
---
Are there builds you can suggest?
---
Damn, I need those precious card packs since everytime I roll one it's a duplicate Shotgun Master card. 6 times I've gotten that same card, and 50 exp barely makes up for it since card packs become few and far between as progress is made.
---
Counterpoint it's almost better to get duplicates than most of the cards cuz most of the cards aren't very good, and the duplicates increase your overseer xp.
---
Hope not. Haven’t been there yet.
---
Oh don't get me wrong, I enjoy the game but I think if they could just fix a couple minor annoyances the game would be great.
---
Yeah man. I’ve feel I’ve posted a million times that this game should have been canon so they could just go nuts, especially considering cosmetic micro transactions.
---
Or they should publicly state that aspects of the game story wise are canon but items and gear arnt.
---
If anything, make it the riot gear from New Vegas. That's essentially an unadorned ranger suit, and far more lore friendly.
---
Just got an email from Bethesda regarding the Incident opened for the bag, confirmed shipping information and delivery on Saturday!
---
It worked for me! Nuclear Winter is taking a while to load, which is understandable as people are now just starting to get on, so it takes time to gather people.
---
Nope, same here ps4. First thing I did when I was able to get back on.
---
Define good tho, by bugs or by qaulity of other things in the game? If the former I agree but the latter there is definitely a difference.
---
LOL you're acting like you got Todd Howard's personal cell or something, calm down and use official channels for dev requests like everyone else.
---
a level 34 started encrypted on my server this morning with my level 120 just doing the dailies being the only high-level character I can find on the whole server. Sorry dude but I had to get back to nuclear winter while it's available. It is crazy to be able to finally loot everything I'm finding a lot more magazines and bobbleheads then normal. The only nukes I've seen since this started were on White springs though. Maybe I'm crazy but I'm beginning to miss the scorchbeast queen....
---
Yes, yes, yes and yes. There are still some issues here and there but overall it functions much better than at launch. I just wish the atom challenges that are bugged would get fixed, I've been at 22 diseases caught since launch and the discovering regions is still busted and I only know 42 recipes when I know I pretty much have all of them by now. One of the scout leader dailies isn't firing off for me after the last patch and I believe the Heart of the Enemy daily is still broken but those are the only issues I have with the game. The gameplay and overall bug fixes have worked wonders on making it more playable. I still hop on everyday if I have time. My other games are starting to resent me I think lol
---
m'mursion that's why
---
Oh shit I forgot about that. I remember doing that in FO4. I pick up most of the things I find anyway though.
---
Yay. Thought it was a game issue. Started feeling like this game was cursed or something having it go down during the free week.
---
It's the only game I've had an issue with, and I'm coming to the conclusion that unless the game becomes more stable, comparable to every other game I play, I probably will have to just give up on it.  
---
If I can play and win in other modern competitive shooters (Overwatch, Apex Legends, Killing Floor 2, Warframe, Fortnite)  while not having any kind of connection issue, I don't think the the majority of the issue is on my side.
---
A shame, I was actually intrigued with Nuclear Winter.
---
Sadly, this is a reflection of the main game itself. The amount of duplicate cards I have is pretty insane.
---
Rad! I can’t wait to start over again, I’m a big fan of staring anew after a long period of time. Probs too much to type but what other things have been changed?
---
I don't care if it's a ridiculous amount of whatever as long as I can do it and it doesn't take nukes to farm for
---
Most PA sets have a stealthboy mod for the chest. Your still noisy as all hell tho. And unarmed is a lot of fun in my opinion, and they have modds for PA arms that increase your punch damage. Honestly though, i only ever use PA when there is a lot of rads. Mainly during silo runs, and nuke zones. Which you can just use a rad suit, then you can still use your unarmed weapons. In my opinion, your super squishy in PA. Get a decent vanguard set of armor and youll have more damage resistance then PA.
---
Lol to be fair I do not have that much currently.  I've dropped probably 3/4 of that on weapons armor and apparel.  I believe in keeping it circulating so I dont sit on it.  Only have a couple of mules.
---
I’m pretty sure you can download mods that disable it
---
Can do! Love this suggestion :)
---
Yes, like poketed, deep pocketed, strengthened, ultralight ect. Its all get from that event
---
Exploring the vault longer would be cool, the wait time should be lowered while queued but the vault should be open to be explored while in adventure mode.   There’s a fair amount of Holo tapes and computers that unlock after reaching certain ranks so the ability to explore/read this with no time limit would be great
---
bVolumetricLightingEnable=0 might be worth a try in your fallout76custom.ini
---
Okay yeah that's what I thought that's why I was confused as to why some people have called me a troll or said it's bullshit?? It's not like I'm saying the game itself is bad, just that the game engine is extremely outdated and the game would actually be fantastic if run on a modern engine 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Thanks for the suggestions! I'll give it a try when I hop on today :)
---
Ah good, maybe they got the message that we pay their bills
---
Ya, that's weird.
---
Then I guess I’m going back in.
---
I believe it has more to do with the fact that Bethesda wouldn't have all these game breaking terrible, garbage bugs and glitches if they would just work on a new engine but they refuse to do so. And now since FO76 got bad ratings they are basically at their wits end and still refuse to get a new engine and are now spewing as much content as they can even though they know that their games still have bugs and glitches in them and instead of slowly adding content while fixing bugs and glitches they are going to watch their games quickly go down hill because they also mostly run like garbage and adding too much content at once makes it worse. They need a new engine, plain and simple. Using the same engine for 10+ years is not how gaming works unless you're fixing it but they aren't.
---
See you in the Wasteland :)
---
Do u have a handmade rifle plan willing to give up? Level 18
---
You can actually go into ZAX’s chamber in the NW waiting lobby, but it requires Overseer rank 100. I assume you can probably shut it down from there, though it won’t affect anything gameplay wise. It’s more for lore reasons
---
Actually was looking at the Raider Sturdy Arms, Legs, Chest Plans. I haven’t see these or the light or heavy versions anywhere in fo76
---
The new Battle Royal mode.
---
I agree with this...I was killed by storm trying to equip my secondary weapon from pipboy...it should be a 1 2 3 select in one location and go.
---
https://bethesda.net/en/article/6VhBPehTctlszsrRCIPZP3/a-newcomer's-guide-to-fallout-76
---
Shoot me your PSN and I can help you rebuild if you want a hand. Plus drop you some plans and supplies if needed. Level 283 here, I have more than enough to go around.
---
The free week is actually a great opportunity to stress test at one of the best parts of the year. Hype is high immediately after E3, it's summer, and since the game is free for a week they can get a lot of people to try out the base game and test their new mode. Nuclear Winter doesn't actually release until August I think.
---
I would hardly consider this game "dead" even before the free trial happened this week.
---
This RNG disadvantage only gets worse as you level up
---
You are entitled to your opinion but I completely disagree I've been playing since beta and loved it the whole time. It did have a rocky launch but more from it being outside their regular gameplay, and experimenting with it.
---
That would not be very fun in my opinion, I think battle royale is good enough on it’s own
---
I have the Jet pack, and it really is useful. I can scale mountains and jump off of cliffs and buildings, just a quick feathering burst before touchdown. Sometimes the landing is hard though, so shocks would be great. I also have the Marsupial and Bird Bones mutations too, so that helps. 
---
I can leap tall buildings with a single bound!
---
Nah, I actually **prefer** the cold embrace of silence and roaring flames. There is no rescue. You only win another chance at slim circumstances for survival. Congratulations.
---
I need to get on putting stock in my vending machine :| Fucking anything at this point lol.
---
You are a godsend bud. Send me a request, and I'll find you in game. You get to pick out an item from my private non vendor stash. For free. Also invite to the discord for the community Merchants of Kanawha
---
Thanks I thought so too I made the post purely because I love Fallout and TES games and love the idea of 76 but the game is held back so badly by it's archaic engine and Bethesda's either unwillingness or incompetence to properly upgrade or develop a new engine. And it's sad because it's seriously holding back some amazing idea based games.
---
I didn’t get an email like this
---
*\*blasts your hands off with said explosive laser rifle with beam splitter resulting in a spectacularly gory explosion of flesh that cauterizes the wound with the boosted gamma emitter modification\**
---
You can't launch a nuke if I've disabled your hand!
---
Even just on personal terminal.
---
I would *love* to claim my FREE T-45 Vault-Tec Engineer Power Armor Paint today!
---
But the fucking PSN is *still* down.
---
Where is that?
---
Are you an investor?
---
You made it all the way to glassed caverns without ever encountering a scorchbeast? That's impressive on it's own, just leaving watoga I have like 3 attack me
---
At lower levels these components (especially screws) can be a frustration, but as you level you will find them easier and need them less. I feel this is an intentional set up to keep the leveling a challenge. If this were implemented, it would allow people to always have top end gear while leveling and would prematurely kill the danger and excitement.
---
Yep.
---
This is helpful when learning mods. If you suddenly wanted a suppressor at level 35, you could craft and scrap level 15 versions, and apply mods you've learned to the level 45. This is especially true when you don't know the plan for a weapon at, say, at level 45, but you get a legendary drop from enemy, and you want to mod it out. Go buy the plan, build/scrap level 15 versions, then apply the mods you've learned to the level 45 version. It saves you resources as you need more materials to craft higher level weapons. It sounds complicated, but it really isn't that bad.
---
i think by 25 years responders would have modded those machines
---
and the brotherhood would have split them in the middle to get everything it had xd
---
T E L L M E L I E S
---
This is a very common issue I've been seeing across platforms. Please send everything you have on this to Bethesda. This is unfortunately a result of the free week.
---
Giving up? Do you think this was some sort of passion project by the devs?
---
Same, got my tracking number yesterday!
---
Already doing it :) 2 more to go
---
Agreed man. I just want an easier way by crafting them, the amount would be whatever they out out but regardless I just want to be able to craft them...and tbh it would make sense for us being able to craft rare components as these 3.
---
I just downloaded it as well, I didn’t buy it during release because of all the bad reviews. I can say no matter what happened on release this is the time to jump in, I’ve had a great time with the game. Ive already put in over 12 hours and I only got it yesterday.
---
Sorry already scrapped it,  need 2 more
---
exactly the same as my name on Reddit :)
---
I’ve been playing since beta, almost every day, and not once have I ever bought anything from those machines. I cannot support this idea enough. Thank you kind user. 
---
Please, take my poor mans gold 🥇
---
Lol was it worth it?
---
On PC it's a bit better fully agreed but then every games like that. I was playing specifically on PS4 pro at that particular time. Even on computer though I'm not sure how someone can look at things like AC:O, RDR2, The Witcher 3, even modded Skyrim from 2011 and say F76 looks amazing. It's just not up to modern standards and that's purely the very outdated game engines fault. The gameplay is also extremely clunky and hasn't changed since 2008 really. Well that goes for the whole thing honestly and that's the sad part.
---
This is a very common issue I've been seeing across platforms. Please send everything you have to Bethesda.  This is unfortunately a result of the free week. It is allowing people the opportunity to cheat without fear of retribution from admins or devs.
---
I thought it might be because I was too fast, like when you go to the Purveyor station and it's all boarded up and you have to wait.  But I've sat in the elevator 10 mins and it's still \[INACCESSIBLE\] so..
---
## Your Ticket Has Been Submitted
---
### Thanks for submitting your question. Your ticket number is: 190613-006553
---
If someone is wanted, they are fair game. I mean we get atoms for killing them, well 76 of them. Don't misbehave and trolling, you gonna learn the hard way when explosions fling your dead body like a rag doll. Muhahaha
---
Ps4 has had server issues all day today.
---
I find adventure lobbies easy 💁🏻
---
PSN is done
---
Scrounger is the same as Pharma Farma but for ammo.
---
So did you file a report and ticket with Bethesda along with the players name and device (console, pc) along with this video? 
---
I’d also post it to Twitter as well and link them!
---
bc maybe 25 years of responders and people walking around would have modded those machines to accept caps, likes the ones you are using...
---
Im around level 100 and still have issues finding enough screws and if I find some its just enough to repair my gear and then back to having none again. It gets tiring having to find screws more so when I could be doing something way more productive.
---
Please please please keep focusing on Adventure.
---
NW has such amazing presentation and polish, please continue that into adventure.
---
That isn't how this works, you made a claim, I don't believe you. It isn't my job to support your position. I don't believe you.
---
&gt; My TSE handmade was pretty worn down 
---
Oh you poor baby.
---
Why did i have to craft my costume? This might be dumb but i couldn't figure it out for 20 minutes till i googled it. If i get something with atoms i should just have it.
---
Just received an email from Bethesda with a UPS tracking number.  Canvas bag will be here Tuesday 06/18
---
Yes please.  We got a detailed roadmap for wild wasteland: [https://i.imgur.com/NgS95D5.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/NgS95D5.jpg)  
---
Why is something similar not available for NW?!?  Seeing as how the NW DLC has already started dropping...
---
A positive article on the inter at about this game? Wow.
---
Seems like a PC thing
---
You realize the people making playable content and the people making atomic shop content aren't going to be the same people....
---
So they can continue to make both playable and cosmetic content *gasp* despite the popularity of AS shop items. 
---
And as for "milking players"? People like cosmetics. 76 playable content is free. You don't need to buy them, others do and you get free content, so that seems pretty decent. 
---
The only people who feel like they are being looked in the AS, are people who just want everything free.
---
Happy Cake Day. Take this meaningless validation arrow
---
I got the email as well. Also, even before the email, it showed up in myUPS.
---
Pistols are still kinda crap. Not as bad as launch, but still crap. Meta is heavy shotgun and melee rn, and they shouldn't nerf them. They just need to balance the cards. (See what I did there)
---
Ok? It’s my primary weapon...
---
I have a 100% maxed CAMP budget. The game is having a hard time loading in my CAMP and nearby items. The grass assets nearby are being removed to compensate but it still is having issues. If they do increase budget, they need to improve load times somehow.
---
That would be awesome
---
To me you made it sound like he didn't deserve to take the full blow of the criticism. I think he did.
---
Fair enough.
---
Nice! Lol what’s your PSN?
---
Yeah that's true.
---
The only thing i can think of is did you record it so you can try find that one player and show it to Bethesda. Good luck man
---
Well, technically this is just a sneak oeak at the dlc, but yeah it would be a good time to get a NW roadmap out
---
Hit camp McClintock and Sugargrove. Piles of clipboards at each for all your spring needs.
---
Not the absolute best but it works. Shotguns got "nerfed" aka fixed a bug that shouldnt of happened. From what ive read the new meta is the junkie class. I could be wrong though.
---
I just got an email from Bethesda directly regarding the Incident opened to replace the bag, so they're directly emailing people too with tracking information!
---
i couldn't get in today aswell, but that doesn't explain what happened yesterday and the day before yesterday
---
I think bethesda should take every blow for it and he is compensated for his role to be the face of it I'm just not going to sit here and pretend he knew all of the facts about it's launch and beta state
---
Yesterday I was sneaking around and found myself hiding in a building at the edge of the circle and got 17 kills because people were constantly trying to kill me. The Gatling gun is unstoppable
---
and you're on ps4 aswell or another platform?
---
Those criticisms aren't really on point though; it's all overblown hyperbole.
---
&gt;no story
---
I can concede that the *main* story isn't very *great*. But I don't really know any Bethesda game where I like the main story better than some of the side stories, and that still doesn't mean that there isn't *any* story in the game. 
---
&gt;"no NPCs"
---
Except there are literally NPCs in the game, just not humans. Whether or not you think the reason for no humans is valid, it doesn't change the fact that saying "no NPCs" is patently false. 
---
&gt;"cash grab with reused assets"
---
Now here's where I really take issue with which you said. 
---
&gt;Cashgrab is the wrong word, "experiment" is better. But the game is ENTIRELY reused assets. 
---
No. No it's literally not. There are a *lot* of reused assets, but they're reused in the same way New Vegas reused 3's assets. They made a lot of new assets for 76, in addition to handcrafting literally the biggest map in any of the 3D Fallout games. Look at Helvetia, or the Mire. 
---
&gt;Now, that's not a bad thing. Lots of sequels reuse assets, but I feel, as a consumer, that Bethesda didn't really try hard enough. It felt like they slapped some shit together and called it good, using the saying "Good enough for government work."
---
I feel like they used most of their 3 year development time actually making the engine online-capable as well as upgrading the lighting and rendering systems in their engine. Todd really wasn't kidding about that 16x more detail thing. Look at distant LODs and compare them to Fallout 4. Hell, that mod that puts Appalachia in Fallout 4 can't even render the land that far away. 
---
&gt;Which, I know, makes me some kind of entitled jackass. But calling it out as such isn't wrong.  
---
I truly don't think you're an entitled jackass, just incorrect about the game being low-effort. They put a huge amount of work into it, it just wasn't in giving the game a totally new art style the way they did for 4. 
---
&gt;As for score I'd probably give it 6.5/10. Respectable but with some very glaring issues.
---
Completely agreed. At launch it was a pretty solid 6 out of 10.
---
Oh well this is not good. I try to believe others as much as I can but...now I'm starting have doubts more if it's really true.
---
One guy on twitter mentioned he made decoys using the cardboard vault boys
---
Yes and putting it in a longer beta literally means releasing it later...
---
Actually yes, it does fall onto you with the burden of proof as to why you don’t believe me. The lack of evidence is not proof it is a unobtainable items, It’s just that, alack of evidence.
---
has no one mentioned the dreaded canvas bag. idk has nothing to do with the game (I like the game, got it this week) but felt I should bring it up.
---
Camp items seem to be a really good way to try a lot of tricky strategies. Can’t wait to play more with them.
---
Holy shit, I never thought of doing that. I picked up a level 5 bloodied hunting rifle the other day. I think I'll pull it out of my machine and save it for a bit until we know exactly how this feature works.
---
Its nowhere near dead on any platform.
---
As a PC player myself, I can say that I have never seen a dead server on Adventure Mode. There always seems to be a decent number of players everytime I log on. Server maximum isn't very high though so sometimes (depending on where you are on the map) it can seem dead.
---
I can't speak for Survival...never played much on that mode.
---
what the hell does a stalking mothman do.... it actually stalks you? (i'm a newbie, don't blame me for not knowing xd)
---
I helped unlock all of the goat skins, I played it quite a bit too. If you think it's ridiculous as an adult, you should watch four 9 year olds playing it on splitscreen, it takes on a whole new meaning.
---
We buy their games, and they get a portion of the money we spend on both console services and internet services. That's a fair amount of money, and more than enough in my book to warrant a bit of reliability in standards relating to accreditation of customers and continuation of current customers. Simple economics of make and keep your customers happy and supplied or you'll never make a penny.
---
[Interview with Jeff Gardiner](https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76/npcs)
---
And said camps probably had no turrets because they dont get attacked my camp is small and not decorated and have 4 turrets and budget is full.
---
They do this with everything, just how it is. It's kinda annoying but, at least for me, when I get the item it makes me feel more accomplished.
---
That is hilarious. I don't believe you because you cannot provide evidence that the post does exist.
---
Nice try though
---
Yes it is. You can start the quest by going to a train station
---
Re: third person vs. first person, go with whatever you're comfortable with from Fallout 4. Most people prefer first person, but personally I like third person for most (but not all) weapons. And with scoped rifles, it forces you into 1pp anyway to take the shot. 
---
The advantage with third person, especially if you crank up the FOV slider in settings, is the increased field of view allows you to see around corners and detect enemy movement easier.
---
Yup, you are a true gentleman of the legendary grind sir.
---
Hi I'm the 900 hours guy. I've had people tell me to kill myself because I enjoyed this game from launch.
---
And the canvas bags and the leaked user information didn't help either. People had even more reasons to hate it.
---
Have fun, and take it slow
---
I don’t about anyone else, but in the atom shop on mine, there a little (owned) where the atom price is. Unless it got taken away after the new update
---
Gimmie a vampire suit
---
Okay and? That doesn't sound like a "hatetrain". That literally sounds like a valid complaint. I mean people in this subreddit still are begging for a radio host, and this sub is like the exact opposite of a hate bandwagon, it's the exact opposite here.
---
100% agree with adding in those features due to feeeback. I only question the human NPC angle because it seems like it would be a radical change to the storyline (that I'd imagine was fairly firmed up for 10ish (?) Months post launch. Plus they have already weathered the storm of criticism. But who knows, maybe we can get someone to go on record :)
---
It doesn't matter. Any extra ones simply add storage capacity. Large ones produce faster and hold 5 total. You're probably never away from your camp long enough for all the extra ones to fill up, which is why you always see two with stock.
---
Right? I literally travel around to the lesser known screw locations to gather then hop to rinse and repeat. It's the biggest time eater I have. Time I could be spending exploring or getting that damn backpack.
---
Yeah I tried to edit that into my comment right after I posted but I got an error msg lol
---
You're a good dude, OP. Don't let that affect your perception of others. Way more people lie on the internet than off of it so don't let this damage your worldview
---
Aaaaand there we go. Can't make a cogent argument, and resort to personal attacks? Really?
---
And what, in heaven't name, do Battlefield's launch and net problems have to do with anything? I brought it up to illustrate a point - that nobody calls it an MMO, despite the fact each of its servers contains significantly more players, simultaneously, than any of FO76s servers. What you did is just utterly irrelevant to the discussion at hand.
---
I wasn't arguing about what you said. I argued that FO76 isn't an MMO. Nothing more, nothing less. And I'm the dense one?
---
Are... Are you trolling?
---
That is 90% of the fun
---
The game was launched too soon. You're only now seeing what a nearly finished base product might look like. We struggled through it all. And paid literal money for it. Bethesda deserves the hate. But the game is fun.
---
Dude, can you quote where Todd Howard said what you said or not?
---
If you would like to talk about what he said I am down to have that conversation, but first we have to be talking about what he said, and not about what you said he said, which is a totally different thing.
---
I'm on the river, SW of the Black Mountain Ordinance Works. The more southern junk extractor site south of the little umbrella table on a concrete block. It's right off the road so I get fresh blues stumbling in fairly regularly. I keep all the doors unlocked so they have access to all the crafting and beds. Some of the folks coming out of the vault lately are just plain weird... &gt;_&gt;
---
&gt; Edit: Now that I think about it, why are the Robo venders accepting caps? 
---
I can't remember where I found it (I think it was one of the WS holotapes), but there's some lore that talks about how just before the war the local nuka plant was running a promotion where you could exchange caps for "something" at various robo vendors and vending machines. When the world went to shit, people continued using the machines to buy vital supplies and it just became the de facto currency.
---
Idk, seems like a winning strategy XD
---
Also pre war money **NO**, the joke in fallout is that dollar is no more and we use caps lmao
---
Since we are in Appalachia we need to think in a modern/robotic way, a special currency only available here, maybe some kind of tokens or credit, remember this region was experimental and edgy, maybe the free states created their own currency and this was problematic, some kind or "electronic money" there is a good chance here to create new lore and quest, and these machines could only accept those currencies by doing jobs and we getting paid from the robots as daily quest or something.
---
srry englando guys
---
Thanks. I just want to help out the community as much as I can but I feel limited at times.
---
Plan your lvls out. There’s several websites to assist. Nukes and Dragons is a decent one. 
---
Break down junk items at a workbench before you store them.
---
No need to hoard weapons and armor unless lvl 45-50. You will go through it quicker than you think. Occasionally you may find a lvl 35-40 godly weapon but that extremely rare. 
---
You aren’t going to really be “well off” for a little while. But I’d suggest against hoarding. People complain incessantly about the stash weight limit. But it just seems like most people can’t say “no, 500 bits of asbestos is enough”.
---
I got it for xbox for three bucks and have a great time playing it with my 7yo daughter.
---
If I had seen the red rocket sign in person I would have brought it without a doubt.  Same with some of the limited PA skins.  The pictures don’t do them justice.
---
Very well! Thanks for the link!
---
Serums are popular but it cost like 18000 caps with bargain and grape mentats
---
Nice! Mines scheduled for Saturday.
---
Do I need PS+ to sign in?
---
A - It's multiplayer
---
B - It's not Fallout 5
---
C - Hate-bate gets clicks
---
Slow, something ive never done in any fallout game, and ive played them all, this games already making me change my ways 😂
---
I bought the CE from best buy. Is this an automatic thing or do I need to make a request? Or am I too late? Just recently found out they were doing this with the bags.
---
I agree with this a lot because it's a simple QOL improvement. I'd like to know what I have on hand
---
Yes exactly!!! Right there with you!!!
---
Ammo: 1 cap per. .308, .45, 5.56 and shotgun shells sell fast, you can always try throwing other types in to see if it sells and if it doesn't, toss it. I have thousands of shells and will ALWAYS buy more at 1c per if someone is selling, my hope is that since Bethesda is tracking sales it adds to the data points and shows it's in demand at that price point.
---
Gunpowder: this one is tricky. Sometimes I sell it like crazy, sometimes it sits in my machine for days. I sell anywhere from 1-3 caps per
---
Serums: serum recipes are a great way to unload caps once you push up on the max cap limit. The popular ones (Marsupial, Speed Demon, Healing Factor, Adrenal Reaction) always sell. Personally I price them at 450-ish. If you're not Enclave yet, you can often find players selling the recipes in the marketplace.
---
Outfits: even "common" outfits sell well if you price them fairly. Think clown costume, scavenger outfit, Brotherhood outfits. Rare outfits (Imposter Sheepsquatch, Forest camo jumpsuit, etc) are obviously big sellers, so check the marketplace first to make sure you're not selling yourself short, no pun.
---
Chems: don't bother. Whiskey and Nukashine I can unload OK sometimes, other times they just sit in there taking up space.
---
Last thing, location matters! I've had camps everywhere from Whitespring to the Cranberry Bog and if you want sales, you need to be where the action is. The further out you are from common areas like Morgantown and Whitespring, the more incentive you need to offer to make sales such as low prices, great inventory, and/or rare stuff. My friend runs a successful clothing shop due in part to her proximity to Vault 76, she wouldn't get the sales if she were out in the Savage Divide or the Mire. Personally I don't want to plan my camp around vending, but it's an important factor. I learned from being at Whitespring that you can sell tons of plans and "garbage" you wouldn't otherwise be able to elsewhere bc people are there anyway and figure screw it, lemme check out this shop.
---
And reading all the posters at the train stations.
---
Interesting - same guy but a slightly different user name. Replace "NAME" with "PING" and that's his other one.
---
Collect ALL of the junk that you can and then take a workshop. Then just hang there for a bit for a nice surprise...
---
Idk, pretty late. Contact Bethesda support? They collected everyone's information back in december January.
---
So, the same mechanic as in Ring of Elysium?
---
You needed to contact support, probably too late now
---
My mistake, its "Chainsaw Long Bow Bar" lol
---
Medium speed weapons, whether unarmed or one handed, seem better for PVP. There is one shot protection for PVP so it does not matter if your super sledge hits for one billion damage. You also do zero damage on your first hit accepting a duel. It is more advantageous to attack quickly at moderate damage.
---
Unarmed is pretty good for a tanky PVE character. You only get one perk card for damage, so you can invest into things like blocker or barbarian to increase tankiness. I only lose about 15% of my Health when the imposter Sheepsquanch punches me. Most everyone else I see dies instantly.
---
What is the range on the small power conduit radiator?  Is it just through the wall to the other side?
---
Can that radiator power another part of the conduit?
---
Follow the story quests for the first portion of the game. If something seems too tough, well, it probably is on purpose - Backtrack, explore some other areas, level up. For general reference, the left and upper-left of the map is where you should stay as a beginner. You'll get quests from the overseer and the Responders after leaving the vault - these walk you through a lot of the gameplay mechanics, and also provide the base materials and plans you'll need to be successful later. 
---
When it comes to combat, don't get intimated by posts on here about the perfect builds. Just find a ranged weapon you like - most likely a hunting rifle or SMG, early in the game - and a melee weapon to switch (a spear or combat knife works well early on) when enemies swarm you. Early on, you should have plenty of stimpacks to work with.
---
OH NOT YOU AGAIN
---
Yep, mothmen are either hostile right off the bat, or will stay far off and watch you.  If you shoot one that is actually stalking you it will flee in a cloud of black smoke and leave the area.  Very rare creatures.
---
It's a shame we now have confirmed hackers with massive XP in NW. That kind of spoils it.
---
Project paradise is kinda tough. All you do is access the elevators in arktos pharmacy.
---
They finally had enough money to get them made.
---
Ill take brick and metal building set for free and ill also take the xo1 target hud plan and xo1 calibrated shocks!!
---
That's tops.. since the beginning considering what the game is made of and how many people are on with full stashes.. yea I think that's very acceptable
---
That’s a reasonable idea. Would be cool to have something special when you hit rank 100 like that
---
It is sort of new. Before, you could only take a look at the components that you had. Now it also shows all the other types (although greyed out).
---
Yes because I never said FO76 was an mmo I was trying to explain what the OP meant by calling it an mmo and you couldnt get past those 3 letters so yeah, you are the dense one.
---
You should fairly soon! Keep an eye out for a case reply email
---
Everyone is limited, OP, that's what's so interesting. People are better when they work together. Just keep enjoying the parts of the game which you enjoy so they get the data of what people actually enjoy doing in the game, keep commenting in threads about what you want to see in the game so the community managers might see it, and also send in feedback from time to time so the quality assurance people can report that to the dev team
---
They could convert some of them to old school Nuka Cola vending machines.  Takes prewar money for a variety of Nuka Cola products.  That would be awesome.
---
Nice! I'm in Canada so I probably wont be hearing from it for a while
---
I thought October was wastelanders.  Isn’t end of June the start of NW?
---
I did he said he regretted not doing a proper longer beta, which means not releasing it when they did. Watch the video in the link.
---
I get downvoted a lot when I post [either of](https://kotaku.com/review-fallout-new-vegas-5670346) [these articles](https://kotaku.com/comprehensive-fallout-new-vegas-patch-will-hopefully-5684137) over there. People really don't like being reminded that the state NV released in was worse than 76. And then the few who actually engage with me usually jump to blaming Bethesda for not giving good QA, even though QA doesn't actually fix games.
---
This was the most beautiful thing I've read in a long while. Best of luck and loots to you, sir.
---
inb4 downvotes, but  I quite like the new NW gamemode. The OG game for the best couple of months has been terrible, not just in gameplay but also in bugginess. This is totally my experience and in my opinion I haven't enjoyed it. I had several game breaking bugs that ruined quests for me. Now that's not everyone's experience and I'm glad you had a good time :) A little disappointed in the single questline in Wastelanders, but I'm hesitantly looking forward to it. I hope that things turn around just a wee bit. 
---
I do disagree though that saying '99%' of reviewers didn't play it. I will say that of the "vIdEo eSsAyS" of the game actually quantified why they weren't too much a fan, Joseph Anderson in particular. But idk, just my point of view.
---
This would definitely encourage team play.
---
How many cans of dog food have been eaten?
---
Yes, just wait until the free weekend is over and this cunt won't be as cocky when he doesn't have unlimited alts.
---
Hmm ok. It’s probably too late now. I may call them if I can round up my invoice.
---
Sadly :(
---
Aight sounds simple enough, ill probably be avoiding PVP entirely though just sticking to PVE,  hows the playerbase? Is it a constant warzone or are there more nice people than im am thinkinh.
---
Or just go bear hunting
---
[Nuclear Winter Complete Unlockables List](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bzy6xd/spoilers_nuclear_winter_complete_unlockables_list/)
---
That's how it was for me last night. I nuked WS and I was the only person that went there. Kind of nice honestly lol
---
Fasnacht was the only limited time event. The others are standard.
---
How about connecting them to the closest player camp?
---
As soon as i get the bag ill let you know.
---
Alright, thanks
---
Pharma farma is critical perk
---
Just got my tracking number too.
---
Look at builds and have one to start ranking up the right attributes
---
Hmm I'm on ps4 and all seemed fine to me. Well.... let me rephrase, i saw plenty of players, it was by no means empty. What i am noticing is most are levels 1-10. I'm used to seeing 100+ levels with 15 or so camps with vending machines on. Now i just see maybe 1 or 2 camps. I assume most are trying out the new battle royale mode.
---
Yep! Tuesday next week for me woooooo!
---
Came across a herd of them near the hospital in Charleston once shortly after launch, but just that one time.
---
SNITCH!!!!
---
Just kidding. Good job on pointing this out.
---
Well i've encountered one yesterday.. I was at the Whitespring bunker and as a level 25 with only an upgraded lvl 10 hunting rifle, it was very hard to kill a level 50 Mothman... Didn't look what kind of mothman tho, but he was hostile right off the bat xD
---
All NW challenges are/were bugged so far. Thats how Bethesda show the "maybe future" players whats going on. \^\^
---
Nope. I just am bored and no one to play with. Might as well do something. Redo my camp help low levels. I'm terrible at PVP.
---
Plan ahead
---
[Here](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) 
---
Because changing perk points later is a pain in a ass
---
People just can't keep their opinions to themselves, can they? And it gets worse when they perceive you as the enemy.
---
Also, you're the guy that all those news articles mentioned? That's a hell of a lot of time patrolling Appalachia. Hope all of them were fun!
---
Yeah too late, they had a deadline when they announced of when you needed to get your ticket in by. I even had to provide proof of purchase even though I bought it directly from them.
---
A more condensed map like charelston would be great and would love to see one with one of the theme parks in it
---
Sometimes you run across an asshole just trying to give you a bad day, sometimes you have people role playing as raiders.. but for the most part it has been mostly positive for me.. I've been playing since the beta. I know me and alot of other higher levels give out free stuff to lower levels all the time so it's pretty cool for the most part
---
 I have trouble believing many owners of the collectors edition are really upset about a bag that was only ever supposed to be storage for the Power Armour Helmet.  
---
What exactly are people planning to do with a oddly helmet shaped bag?  
---
The only thing that bugged me was that youtubers were sent canvas bags. But even considering that, I'm 88% sure that most of the people complaining about the bag didn't have that version of the game (or in many cases, have the game at all).
---
Yeah I just read it on twitter thx!
---
Kinda shocked they have not yet.
---
I would've loved to join you and farm some juicy XP out of your nuke ;P
---
Yes it is an online game
---
I think you missed my point. The person I replied to implied FO76 is an MMO. I corrected that. The game is not an MMO, and how MMOs work isn't relevant to FO76. I never argued any game, in any genre, is incapable of having launch issues or bugs. My only objection is to people playing it fast and loose with the term MMO, to the point where it almost lost all meaning. I would act in the same fashion if someone called Stardew Valley an RTS. So you're literally arguing with me on the point I never brought up or contradicted.
---
Not a plan, but I can make a handmade for ya!
---
It's my username lol. I got lucky, My PSN and Xbox live are the same too. I got a discord under the same username as well. Had a YouTube channel back in the good old days
---
Awesome. Makes me feel better leaving the vault and not worrying like im constantly a target
---
Then I would be paranoid as hell that they can take my stuff.
---
You take that back this instant and begin praising the glory of the mouth harp, hallowed be its name.
---
Just wish weight perks applied to stay items...would fix a lot of headaches and overthinking the inventory management
---
*headbutts the launch button*
---
Is there a video cause I would love to see that!
---
Cool will do just decided to give it a try since it's free to try and all definitely a more positive experience than I expected gonna try and sink a few solid hours in before trial expires and go from there
---
This should make devious camp traps easier to set...
---
Gonna have to rethink my camp!
---
You can definitely tell by the map who the new players are because they all tend to land in named locations. Meanwhile, I drop somewhere unmarked (like the obstacle course north of the bridge, or Gauley Mine), and have the place to myself for a solid 2 minutes. They're not as densely packed with crates as some of the higher traffic areas, but there's enough containers full of loot that I've never had a problem gearing up.
---
Is there stat trackers in nw? Ex. Total kills?
---
What platform?
---
Get some raider power armour it makes life easier, you can look up a guide on yt
---
I think if they would do it, they would make it cosmetic for other players to view only.
---
Nice, i just turned 10 and got my chair, lol :D
---
So depressing hearing people wanting a roadmap for nuclear winter.
---
Fallout:battle royale it is then.
---
Thank you for the tip! 
---
Also, I could use some more tips as well. I’ve been trying to progress through the story and feel like I’ve hit a stand still now at level 17 and haven’t progressed very much.
---
That the most are levels 1-10 is no suprise since FO76 is free to play this week, so a lot of gamers are giving the game a chance, since they can see now with their own eyes if it's a good game. 
---
Honestly I've been helping a lot of new players getting started and made a lot of friends that way. They all seem to love FO76 way more than they expected
---
I miss the days of his channel before fallout 76 was announced. I remember coming home from school every day being excited to watch his videos. Wether it be a mods weekly or Bethesda rumors. Those were the days
---
Right? Or how about some paint for my ultra PA? Like for reals
---
It's how I get fast travel spots for low-levels. As long as I can survive the trek back. LOL Level 6 in Harper's Ferry is very tricky....
---
There's a glitch where you can hide outside the map and shoot anyone anywhere. Honestly, nothing to different really, except now it's all pvp and has some merit to try and do.
---
In my experience, it only pops up if you're standing.
---
Is a heavy build of the start a dumb idea? Tradition from every fallout game ive gotten at start i always make my very first character a heavy weapons build. Is that...viable at start?
---
Normally I'd down vote this, but it would give people a reason to play after they die.
---
This would be a good way to get some exp after death.
---
I won’t lie, I made that mistake a lot. I keep thinking “great, I’m with a level X, maybe we’ll get far” just to watch them charge a team that’s much more put together. 😂
---
That wouldn't be bad at all. Or like a random event where we have to stop a meltdown or it nukes a larger area than the silos.  Chernobyl my resident
---
Same here just got the email.
---
It's really nice to see people giving this game a second chance, or first in this case, and enjoying it. But it's also a shame that there's people it there who will never admit that this game ever got better, even tho it has
---
Keep the legendaries and learn to dump all the useless stuff. You can save a lot of weight by getting rid of heavy weapons, and unscrapped junk. A lot of the stuff you don’t actually use, trust me.
---
Well *shit*.
---
Touche... Touche.
---
Allright boys, we got approximately three minutes to evac before the bird leaves the silo.  Let's go!
---
I wish I had but my shadowplay was off, it was basically me just running around with a gatling gun lol
---
I hope you have fun!
---
Not that I have seen, but there should be.
---
Took me a month to figure out they actually sold stuff..  I thought they were just decoration.  Once I checked the prices, they BECAME decorations as far as I'm concerned.  If we could SELL stuff to the machine, different story.  I like the pre-war money angle suggested.. I use the pre-war cash to make gunpowder currently.
---
Pretty much what I do is I hunt the number 1 until I am number one then I defend it for as long as possible. My biggest kill streak is 28 so far.
---
I've been using scarecrows for the same purpose
---
Wait they actually read this?
---
I’d support this as long as it didn’t reward people who go Leroy Jenkins and spawn a million miles away from the team and die in 15 seconds, since they contribute nothing to the team. Other than that I like this idea!
---
Map dpad to the right
---
If you have a good firestick, go for it :)
---
And if you are in a good power armor they really can't do to much damaged to, except maybe eat you, it is it's friends you should look out for, lol
---
Thank you for this guide
---
Even better, why not extend the teams to bigger numbers and have factions duking it out? Maybe those factions very a team specific perk.
---
That way you could have brotherhood VS super mutant or scorched VS raider or other themed natural enemy modes.
---
😂😂 but killing their vows is fun
---
Scorched?
---
Try resyarting device
---
I forgot about those youtubers almost immediately.
---
Its not going to happen. That's why you drop baggies. Individual item tracking is hard on game loads as is, put that on a server with 24 people
---
With all kinds of stuff happening all at once? If you thought the crashing was bad before...
---
My tired ass spent 5 minutes rereading the title going “what are those words?”
---
you can run..but you cant hide
---
What youtubers
---
They need a workshop where the machine spit out either screws,  springs, or gears. 
---
This brings up another point: make the damn workshops useful by making them able to fabticate completed items.
---
-ballistic fiber
---
-nuka cola products
---
-alcohol
---
-screws
---
-etc
---
Not only could we get useful stuff but the worshops would become very valuable.
---
The entire season of content is called Nuclear Winter. People are waiting for a lot more than just the new NW game mode, such as the new prestige system and any events/quests or other new features like Fridges, Ammo Scrapping, Camp Decorating, etc.
---
\+ 1 from me :)
---
Hippity hoppity dont kill property
---
Yup, noticed the same. The game has improved since launch, but i think some of it was also the hate bandwagon everyone hopped on at launch.
---
Are you looking for ppl to run with??
---
 Or are you a solo player??
---
There's some kind of metaphor for the Great War in here somewhere, I just know it.
---
Project paradise is closed (ps4 confirmed). Sorry guys. It's just the scouts, booze, and sheepsqwatch for now.
---
Upgradeable storage
---
Maybe using caps or a higher material amount
---
I love the new battle royale mode. It brought me back to fallout 76. I hope it sticks around beyond the 17th. Great job Bethesda!
---
CAMPS are incredible as bait. Throw down something that looks fortified and go hide a couple hundred feet away. Most people are idiots and will expose themselves by firing at the structure or rushing the door thinking they can get the drop on someone.
---
Similar to creation club
---
I agree. The vending machines were set up before the Great war. It makes sense they would accept old world money.
---
Dont ever speak of that cancer here
---
But yes i would like too see a larger team size
---
No one wants BR
---
In menu when you open map, the br challenges will have NW in name.
---
Ad Victorium brother.
---
lol, wat? It's nice to know that you think I'm powerful, thank you! You're wrong about my sexual habits in regards to Bethesda, and I'm not sure why someone commenting on your post made you think about sucking dick but I won't judge. 
---
It's the degeneration into insults that makes you seem powerless: it's not the reaction of someone who's used to success in arguments, and as an example of an argumentative style it's not very strong - insulting people relies very heavily upon the idea that the other person values your opinion, and you haven't established any rapport with anyone in this comment string at least. If the arguments is not going your way, or if the impact of your statement isn't being taken as intended: insulting the people who reply to yoi is no different than admitting defeat in a lot of people's eyes, and outlining that you're out of all other options but to rage and to think about eating fecal matter and felating phalluses will not turn any downward spiral in the direction that you want. There are over 180,000 people in this community and I'm positive that someone will want to disagree with your posts at some time or another, and when arguing victory does not mean as much as you may think while the method and style of your arguments is a reflection of who you are
---
Maybe after the beta
---
The image I linked came out before any of the last DLC dropped, I think most of us expected something like that this last inside the vault.
---
Not a life threatening emergency mind you but people are curious about what else is coming other than BR.
---
I can defiently see some people like it?
---
I'm actually surprised and upset this isn't already the way that works. What the hell are they thinking? Community building hard when you no make people want teamwork
---
Yes agreed! And yeah workshops are pretty lack luster. Been hoping they would do something like this for a while to improve on them.
---
Most of those youtubers’ gimmick is to hate on games whether it’s ET for Atari or Breath of the Wild they scream like morons because it gets them views. See: Angry Joe.
---
Excavator Armor full set will give you +100 carry weight. You really don’t need more than 1-2 frames of power armor. Sell what you’re not immediately using. With materials, bulk lead and aluminum and try to keep around 100-150 of any resource you use en masse and about 50-75 of anything you *might* need. Personally, I don’t use cork so I always toss it out. Only weapons you should keep are the ones you actually use. Vendor them, scrip garbage legendaries, and sell decent legendaries in your shop. Only keep the ammo types you use, and maybe 1-2 ammo types you know are popular (5.56, 5mm, and .50 tend to be popular) to sell in bulk.
---
As a counterpoint to OP's reply about melee, I always keep at least 1 melee weapon because you can kill hostile critters without firing your gun and giving away your location to other players. Even a board will take out most of the mobs in 2-3 swings, so it doesn't even really matter. I just keep the first one I find.
---
It would be nice if they still implemented clutter in some way. Even if it was just a camp item like a shelf or table with some stuff on it
---
Nah there are plenty of subs that aren't circlejerks for their respective media. You're just making up some alternate reality here to convince yourself of something, I dunno, don't care enough to find out.
---
And I'm not calling them delusional and childish for conversing with me. I call them that because of the deluded, childish things they say. You're putting a bunch of words in my mouth, attacking me for disliking a game I've already said I liked. You're just plain going off the deep end here.
---
Or explodes the silo
---
But it’s not exciting when you take almost no damage and you inflict a lot of damage. I mean, don’t get me wrong I have a bloodied 3 star deathclaw gauntlet.  Swing speed and dmg reduction. It’s a nice weapon. But even that is no match for my bloodied auto 3 star handmade with dmg reduction and reload speed.  I can hit someone with 10 shots in 3-4 seconds at 150dmg and they are done for.  
---
So don’t be a slappy.  It won’t end well for you and I’m pretty sure you aren’t rocking the same deathclaw gauntlet I have.
---
Mule characters and 2nd accounts pretty much for those who really want to have a war chest at their disposal.  Everyone else is forced to get rid of stuffs.
---
Op, are you England or US? Seen a few posts about the bags shipping, but haven't received any tracking info emails
---
Us
---
This game mode is so great I'm finding very minimal problems which is great for the early launch of any br title
---
They have a few camp items in the atom shop. But yeah more would be nice, but still they'd have to tweak the camp budget more.
---
So funny  story. I plugged your heading, "So, where does Fo76 store screenshots, anyway?" just copied and pasted. And got the answer, first result, in a post from last year.

I miss this from fo4 but I didn't have to worry about people stealing and when the game got unstable I would just hop saves. I used to fill my shelves with nuka colas and place stimpacks inside test tube racks. Man those were the days...
---
Sell stuff!
---
Well done. You (and others) have matured past listening to what others say and forming your own opinion with your own experience.
---
Congrats.
---
Same. Glad to finally get closure on this matter haha...
---
Yeah, something outside of the sbq that makes me give a damn about Appalachia
---
Workshop pvp would be worth it if you could defend a ballistic fiber machine. Or maybe a canned dogfood plant. The options would be limitless tbh, and they already have areas set up. Cmon Bethesda!!
---
Im not a br vet, but have learned alot just by hiding and watching other players. 
---
Also just because you see someone doesnt mean you have to immediatly engage. They may have teammates kinda walking behind providing cover.
---
Because if you don't hide it will attack you?
---
What’s so good about project paradise
---
Yeah so true man Lets hope we get something out of this post at least lol
---
Yes for sure!
---
There are a few utube videos out mate that might help you. I'm not sure if there is a tutorial.
---
Angry joe is such a twat, literally just jumps onto a fad and shills out to whatever the popular opinion is
---
How do you even get brahmin?
---
I fully agree this is super reasonable and not to op.
---
*\*cough\**STASH increase*\*cough\**
---
You have answered a question I never took the time to ask
---
I just got my email about 6:20pm eastern
---
In Nuclear Winter you need up S.P.E.C.I.A.L, but for adventure you do not really need anything from Nuclear Winter
---
Any advice for someone who just cant aim to save hos virtual life?
---
Yeah! Why should we have to display any skill with this gamemode? We should be able to just wait until we find a team with three other high level players, immediately die, and then profit! It's the only fair way to move up a ranking system which can be used as an indicator of your experience in a battle royale setting, as I see it :-p
---
I'm constantly dropping gears. Somehow I always have waaaay too much of them and no one ever buys them from my vendor, even at 1 cap per.
---
If it means anything. Pick yr battles wisely. My heavy build sucks lots of cool guns decent armor high level. Pvp character. Lower level just a couple of viable weapons and barely ever anything useful to take junk wise. Lol the only quest I’ve done is the one that gives u the perfect storm hahaha
---
&gt;you don’t have to worry about anyone sneaking up on you.
---
Unless someone find a hazmat suit. My wife won a match a couple nights ago by simply hanging just outside the safe zone in a hazmat suit and waiting for everyone else to burn up or die from the scorchbeast. Never fired a bullet.
---
Oh, I don't know, if this Nuclear Winter has taught me anything, it's that I can really hide like a mofo!
---
You still haven't answered the question.
---
I bought it a week or so ago and never had a problem with pop.
---
Will look you up!! It’s always good to have another ally in the wasteland!
---
"Thank you for assuming the party escort submission position."
---
Maybe it was still loading... give it some time then try again
---
Noticed the typo is correct. 
---
That is worth some free atoms right!!
---
Not how that works.
---
you can still attack other players in adventure mode.  It deals zero damage but if they retaliate then pvp is on for both players.  
---
iirc other than the other methods mentioned here constantly instigating pvp with people will eventually earn you a bounty but it requires pretty diligent effort constantly attacking everyone in sight.
---
Yea I totally agree with you, but at least if we can't add items from our stash box. They could do some like (ie making a nuka cola or small little items such as food items where they can be placed for more decor) just like the plushies etc. Might sound a little pathetic lol. But that would be more than enough for me.
---
Maybe a system similar to WoW where transport would have a schedule
---
AH,  here we go. changing core game mechanics in favor of BR.  no.
---
They capped out, I’ve got every challenge done.
---
Fallout wiki says the event happens randomly.
---
https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Event:+The+Path+to+Enlightenment
---
If you didnt know, what you unlock in BR is only within the same character and not the account. You have to use your main character if you want those BR items like chair and statue lol.
---
Make a mule my friend.  
---
Get someone to help transfer the stuff you don’t use to it.
---
Sorry it took me so long to respond! 
---
Stars: 1. Your V.A.T.S. critical meter fills 15% faster
---
	     2. +10% damage while aiming

---
Level 45
---
I think the majority of his movie and tv reviews are off of toxic threads he reads on reddit. Every last episode he did of GoT was verbatim stuff people said on freefolk.
---
Also tamed creatures if they haven’t already
---
Please figure out a way to stop the hackers in Nuclear Winter. Thank you.
---
Bless🙌🏻
---
It certainly seems as if they aren't
---
Thanks this actually helped me out alot.
---
This game's gonna be so good once it gets out of BETA!
---
Anyone else hear the sound of bethesda possibly drowning in money over this one little thing? There's also like... an echo... sounds like.... "patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter"
---
It's not a hard event, you just need to be really quick. You're only killing fireflies and possibly Brad toads for the bioluminescent fluid. You need 50 to light the lighthouse I believe, so you have to kill a lot and since your timed you have to be fast.
---
Ya, ps4 has had issues today. It's their servers, not fallout.... Today
---
Extra Power Armor can be stored in Power Armor Chassis (10lbs).
---
I read the comments mate. They are referring to Battle Royale.
---
A mule is the same as a second account? I am hoping that when they add in NPCs that they bring back companions and their carry capacity.
---
One ghoul would be cool but I feel to easy. What is you could control a pack of ghouls?
---
its 72 or so gig, now.
---
How do I post a pic on here? I don’t see anywhere to attach one..
---
Nice. Next time put on the classical station when fighting miss sbq. You get some stable Flux from Scorched Earth event too so that was very productive.
---
That's what you took away from my post. Ok
---
It has to be night time in game. Then you have to travel to that area for the event to trigger. Same with camp fire tales.
---
Then it's easy. Kill frogs, they give 2-3 each kill.
---
Lightening bugs give 1-2.
---
10 minutes and done.
---
Lol chillll it’s all of PlayStation network
---
I feel like this might just be the way it's set up for the sneak peek trial. I could see when they actually release the mode, having us either chose from the menu or actually go into 51 and trigger the matchmaking. Especially if they want us to take the time to read the lore as we level up, we're going to need to be able to explore it without the timer.
---
I feel like I want the haters to continue thinking it's bad because I dont want to have to play with those assholes
---
Oh but I was so close to Victory I can almost taste it. It was probably the most exciting game I had. Because I actually had a good team that was communicating very well. And then that bulshit happens. Then I get on another team with two people with no microphone and one guy who was blaring what sounded like Dora the Explorer in the background
---
Thanks, I can't get the event to trigger though. Do you just have to be lucky enough to have it spawn?
---
I mean if you're going for a raider base then ramshackle fits.
---
But I want completely clean.
---
No conduits. No wires.
---
You can get T-45 at level 25
---
Lol... Today 😂
---
It's a bit rude to only get 400xp for 20 kills though.
---
Two xboxes.....
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; In short, it’s the most laid-back, friendly online game I’ve played, and if you see a high level player coming at you, you’re way more likely to get a gift of some water &amp; food than a shotgun to the face.
---
I was running a nuke zone last night and decided to pop over to Flatwoods to greet some new players, forgetting that I was wearing my PA and toting a 50cal. I was waving and gift emoting, but none of them would have anything to do with me until I put my gun away and climbed out of the PA. 
---
Turns out people are much less threatened by an old man in a bathrobe than they are by a literal walking tank.
---
A 'Confirm Purchase' would be better than just tapping X on the item's screen to buy it, a brainfart on my part caused me to drop 1000 Atoms on a weapon skin I did not want.
---
A cheat is an unfair advantage, an exploit is taking max benifit from something possibly overlooked. I would call this an exploit not a cheat. There's no gameplay advantage to doing this over just building bases and walls around them, it actually just costs more materials.
---
Thanks a lot
---
This is a great idea! I used them a couple of times at low level when I was desperate but they’ve been pretty redundant to me since
---
Make sure you collect your 1400 caps every day from the robot vendors.  One uranium fever event should net you enough guns and mmgs to make around 800 of that.
---
And I know it sounds stupid but that 1 point perception perk that helps you find cap stashes is actually pretty friggen amazing.  Throw it in when you're farming and you will be amazed how many cap stashes are hidden literally everywhere.
---
Any Joy?
---
Why don’t you just eat dog food and drink purified water I’ve never had to worry about perks or the back pack mod
---
I mean, my 10-20 jab is a bit low. I'd say I was level 50 within 15 hours, but thats because I was shooting for that. Maybe this guy's at 30-40. But it's bound to be low. Or he's idling/exploring without doing much in the way of actual gameplay, which is where the bulk of the worst bugs happen. 
---
As for levels...yeah. Unless you're actively grinding for XP, they get harder. Bellow 50 isn't bad. 50-100 takes twice as much XP as it takes to get to 50. And so on, from what I've found. 
---
I'm 184, in 719 hours. And a big part of that is because _I don't grind for levels anymore_. But getting to 50? Thats not a lot of time invested. If you're sub level 100, you haven't put that much energy into this game. 
---
In that 719 hours, I've had several hundred CTD's (I get between 1 ctd every 3 hours and one every 20 minutes, depending on the build. There was one update that I didn't play because it was every 5 minutes... I haven't logged an exact number, but it's 300+).  Just as a for example.
---
Report this to Bethesda on their support site. Posting here does nothing. Include the video when you report it.
---
This! So much more fun than red dead...
---
Its up everybody
---
Up and playing now in the midwest
---
This is exactly how it went down, people got pissed because it wasn't top shelf AAA and was essentially Fallout 4 with no NPCs and an online component and just lost their shit.  It wasn't a bad game, just not what they expected.
---
It was buggy as hell, but it's mostly stable now.  Also bugs are to be expecting in this style of open world game.
---
Oh I know. I was frustrated for the time being. I got over it. It was just so crazy how I was finally doing good and then it logged me out.
---
I”m going to repost it with a pic...
---
Hmm can’t find you! I’m D-Wall317
---
Kinda like zombie mode where dead players become ghouls. And live players have to survive as long as possible.
---
Wasteland Workshop content would be great. The concrete wall, curved walls, fancy railings. Maybe even the creature capture things (with a limit on creatures - can't capture one if one is already out or something).  Plus the electrical options, like logic gates. 
---
Set up a laser tripwire with a Deathclaw cage, so the cage opens upon your base being attacked...
---
I killed a 15 for 5 caps wasted 35 lol but gave him junk and plans
---
Traveling pharmacy and true hiker should be your first 2 max cards. I did that on my alt character. After that, bandelier. 
---
Food and ammo are so heavy in this game. 
---
Once the weight is reduced 90%, you can forget about it and focus on legendaries.
---
Also, make sure you don't have numerous 40mm. They weigh too much. Drop or sell them.
---
I was one of them, saying to my friend how shit Fallout came out, but now half a year later they made it a really good game if you can look away from the bugs xd
---
Not even trying to hide it.
---
Report player link: https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10/?prod=1129&amp;cat=28
---
That could work. I'm always open to options, never once I have I complained that there are two many choices.
---
The Brahmin pen plan from vendors
---
Sweet
---
the only issue i have with NW is the audience who dont play fallout, they demand changes that would break our adventure mode/survival/lore
---
Yeah I think they should up it a little but it's still quite a lot in terms of leveling.
---
Yes you can make a new character but you wont earn the exp and caps on your main character if you use an alt for BR. Also lets get back to the original question. If someone is fairly close to you with frog legs, will it be harder to hit him or without it? Why can't you answer this even after i asked a few times lol.
---
Awesome. I think I already have that plan. Thanks
---
Uhhh it’s a team based game. You taking one for the team so your team can survive should be rewarded. Also you get 500 do a win and only 20 a kill so they WANT you to win and the best way to do that is working with a team. And I’m willing to bet money I’m a better pvp player than you so I’m not making an excuse because I’m “bad”
---
I put over 400 hours into this game and did all the activities available from launch until January 2019 (the endgame was farming whitespring and sbq).
---
This game deserved all the backlash.  Perhaps it is better now.
---
Despite having a good time with my friends for the most part (which was the main reason for playing), building camps and interacting with other players who were role playing vendors; I will say at that time, this was not a quality title and was very obviously made for micro transactions and experimentation of new systems for their future titles.
---
lol, ok, I'll give you that.
---
The Pip Boy is not terrible for adventure and survival.  Better?  :)
---
If you want to see some truly mind boggling HORRIBLE UI?  The new Ghost Recon Breakpoint test was so confusing I couldn't do almost anything in it.  Just trying to select a mission was impossible.
---
A vid was posted of that exact player earlier.
---
File a report: https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10/?prod=1129&amp;cat=28
---
The feeling I think all us players have earned, and in hindsite I guess i dont really care if new players share the experience we had stabalizing west Virginia, but I do feel like it's a quality plot line they wont even know they missed out on.
---
I was in a game with him! I also got video proof of his hacking. Knocked our whole squad in one second from a few bullets, from pretty far away
---
That's my point.
---
Im VERY worried about year 2.
---
We have the wastelanders dlc which is great. That is coming. But with how focused the dev teamclearly were on battle royale considering how detailed and polished it is, coinciding with the free week. 
---
My concern is what they are aiming for long term now.
---
I’ve had mine for two weeks I thought everyone already got theirs lol
---
This has happened to me twice. Yesterday I bought BOS armour plans, learned them, then when I went to make them it wasn't there in the list. Happened again today when I bought some deep pocketed robot armour. Gutted as I spent a fair few caps on them :-(
---
Works now. Just got in.
---
then proceeded to shoot randomly and just rack up kills, auto aim and noclip through the ground
---
Oh really? Well that's good to know. Thanks man. I was thinking if they change it maybe show the red dot on the compass at the bottom so you can tell the direction but not exactly where they are.
---
Yeah, other BR games have much cleaner "one page" inventory styles.  Easier to quickly use, change things, drop things, and go.
---
Level 100 sheepskwonk will wreck everyone!
---
To me being specked to run is dumb, yeah I'm should be able to run everywhere but when the ring is closing I should run forest run right? Nobody no matter how are tired who would stop if they know it meant death.
---
My pessimistic side is feeling they are aiming for the fortnite crowd longterm potentially.
---
The top comment is about the seasonal content as a whole, and I just counted five other comment chains that are about the rest of the season's content or specific parts of it, such as the prestige system.
---
I was wondering why she took several pump shotgun blasts to the head entering that thing and proceeded to strafe around the side of the lighthouse and blast me with an SMG through the wall.. good times
---
I kind of feel like they should go full out on this and have had three tiers of power armor chassis. Each using either Fusion Cores, Plasma Cores, or Ultracite Cores. Each tier of chassis would control things like energy drain, movement speed, and the overall fuel efficiency. Actual physical protection would still come from the armor pieces used.
---
Well, I mean you're downed. You shouldn't have tools for survival outside of your teammates saving you.  Sure it sucks to get downed and taken out early on, but it's a fair strategy to kill downed players.
---
As it is, you have a 360 degree camera, use those precious moments and your vision to lead your team to the enemy, before they finish you off.
---
Guessing that's why they announced a partnership with Microsoft on cloud gaming and AI hardware recently.
---
I'd assume Xbox stuff is 100% Azure, and with xCloud coming they're probably joining forces to fight back against Stadia.
---
It was literal false advertising. People paid for something and they 110% have every right to what they paid for and SHOULD get upset about it. What Bethesda did is basically illegal and in no world is that okay.
---
Nuclear Winter literally is BR.
---
Players drop in with zero loot and must quickly search for loot.........check.
---
A circle that gradually shrinks and damages players if you're outside it...............check.
---
There can only be 1 winner or winning team..........check.
---
And the interface is too slow.  Hell Xera Survival just came out from an indie team and I'd rather have that UI than the pip boy.  Bethesda can do better.
---
I'm not saying split them permanently, just give them a few levels in a completely uninhabited wasteland before it repopulates itself with NPCs. Make them achieve something before you give them the stability that was brought to the wasteland by the dwellers of vault 76.
---
Right... so why waste time here?
---
No one who matters gives a damn what he thinks.
---
 Switzerland?
---
Thats fine, more chems for me.
---
Oh wow that is awesome! I hadn’t seen anyone post that they got it yet.
---
Imagine an army  people In marine and combat armor being led by Uncle Sam riding liberty prime
---
&gt;When the god of all 9 year olds
---
His opinion is right up there with Juicehead on the worthless scale.
---
It does seem like they are purposely designed to be used as a last resort.
---
Jesus is that guy still a thing?  Feels like a decade ago I would play minecraft with my girlfriends little brother. He was a big deal to him lol.
---
Patrolling Nuclear Winter almost makes you wish for the Mojave.
---
True, I was just comparing to adventure mode xp and I know I probably shouldn't.
---
But I was getting 400+ Xp for downing a lvl 50 SB and 108 for a lvl 68 scorch.
---
Op killed 20 gamers and only got 400xp, should be alot more imo
---
I definitely did not expect to enjoy this mode as I did.  My better half and I teamed up with two guys who also had mics, and were able to plan, strategize, and trade, which made it a more pleasant experience. 
---
I am still terrible at it, and she and those guys basically carried my useless ass throughout, but it was a good night.
---
Thats actually brilliant. I wish i had thought of that
---
Theres a map that someone has all the loot crates marked, I like to spawn at the lighthouse, usually noone there
---
It's ironic to say anyone that didn't like the game was just following the trend but then everyone who religiously defends the game follows the trend by claiming anyone who doesn't like it just follows the hater youtubers. 
---
So my opinion? People should stop making stupid baseless assumptions just to try to downplay many peoples valid issues with something.
---
Ive read more comments
---
They can be in the game and just lower the HP of the mobs like the did in NW then
---
Will that keep the 9 yr olds in other games? If so, then I salute him.
---
Pewds is 30+, and only plays the games his fans make him play. He's just a little out of touch and misinformed like most youtubers. But even as someone that likes the game a lot I don't blame either of them. I have negative opinions on a lot of games and movies I haven't played or scene. The human condition, what you gonna do?
---
Piggybacking on this - I had one negative encounter in the beta, and all positive since then. I'm level 89 so I've put a lot of hours in.
---
Does Sony also have a cloud computing platform though? If not I'd assume total workloads are on par given everything else Azure is used for besides Xbox.
---
My buddy started playing a couple days ago. I gave him some but didnt tell him itd move him. Lv6 and down by watoga when he woke up. Lmao
---
Don't hoard useless crap.
---
Break down all junk before storing. 
---
Don't keep more than 50-60 of each junk item. Exceptions being there rare and more used items like ballistic fiber, screws, gear, etc. Base the exceptions around what YOU use most. What do your weapons use. What do you need to repair your armor? Focus on those and keep everything else around 50. Some junk can be lowered even less when you figure out what you don't use. (I keep no corks or bones)
---
Use lvl 50 fully modded t-51 power armor the majority of time. It's the easiest to repair and requires the least amount of junk which lowers how much you need to keep.
---
Don't keep any aid or ammo in stash unless you are selling them. Perks only reduce carry weight and that stuff is heavy when you put î in stash.
---
Max out the perks listed below to reduce personal carry weight which reduces what you need to stash.
---
Following this, I have 12 weapons, 3 full sets of armor, all magazines and bobbleheads, 50 of all junk (except bone and cork) 100 of the rare items and I'm only sitting at 640 weight in my stash box.
---
Granted I came in a little hostile, I more ment to say a majority of people said they would never try it because of how bad people said it was.
---
Battlefield is leagues beyond fallout out. Down to the guns, their recoil and sound. Their calculations, and damage numbers. Fallout wishes to even run like call of duty, if we’re talking accessibility. There’s a reason why anyone was able to pick and play CoD games with ease, they designed it that way.
---
Like a mini version of "Oh... Sir!"
---
So why don't you expect bethesda games to have less bugs and imperfections? Other AAA developers even some not AAA developers can manage to make massive amazing open world games and have 1/30th of the issues Bethesda do. Why do bethesda get a free pass then? How does that help them grow and progress as a studio if no one expects anything? Having low expectations for a product is a BAD thing for that company.
---
Oh, I have yet to see a hazmat in NW. I gotta see if I can find one of those.
---
Yeah I'm going through the whole crafting and scrapping weapons for mods rigamarole and I'm burning through screws and springs like no one's business =_=
---
I would happily use a stupid amount of steel if it made these components even slightly easier to come by
---
OH I CAN SEE IT JACK. IT'S THERE IN FRONT OF ME.
---
Doing Atoms work!
---
I don't think the req tapes give that much usually. Maybe they have a chance to but I thought they usually gave about 10-30. The enclave drops you get after the connection events drop about 100 cash though.
---
After a year an half in ark on official servers. 76 is a goddamn sugar coated cake with sprinkles and happiness oozing out of its freshly cut perfectly preserved piehole. 
---
Its good.
---
I think there should be mutations but they have negative effects still
---
Silly goose, there are rad showers all over the map for that.
---
A fucking HUD UI is not a 'core game mechanic'.
---
What do you mean by cloud computing platform,
---
I humbly accept your gold kind sir.
---
Is it actually or is it just that glitch that makes new area inaccessible for no reason until you relog?
---
High level could have just server hopped if they wanted that factory so bad. You employed a legitimate strategy to keep what you claimed.
---
I suspect it's something to do with precombined meshes and previs.
---
Check your ram run a memtest86
---
It was cheaper to buy a few radaway at inflated costs then travel to camps lol. I have the plans but not the stuffs to make it... Plus i think im going to opt for a brahmin and thats a chunk out of my farm budget.
---
Was hackers in the other game modes? Or did something bethesda do made it possible now?
---
Meta is super complicated and is different depending on player archetype. Archetypes I see are melee PvE, bloodied melee PvE, PA Heavy PvE, PA melee PvE, sneaker PvE, Junkie PvE, Junkie PvP, sentinel PvP, cavalier PvP, sneaker PvP, blocker PvP (niche), mister sandman PvP (super niche).
---
PvP archetypes are generally poorly understood. People who first complain armors are OP, when they get them and go PvP still die if they don't know what they are doing.
---
It's gonna be Prototype X-02 Power Armor.
---
Or you know, the game had a lot of legitimate issues and people weren't happy about that? You're right though clearly it makes more sense to just say everyone was a dumb hater because it was cool 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
No caps on psn
---
Honestly, I think FO76 is the most underated game of the year. Yes, there was a bumpy launch that was really more of a public beta while the tried to deal with everything they hadn't anticipated. However, despite that, they have pulled through and created a game that works pretty well. And then they added a battle royal mode that no one thought they wanted until they tried it.
---
Please do this...
---
Glad your enjoying it the game as it is now, however you should know that this game, at release, was a (and still is) a Work-In-Progress beta game. YouTubers had grossly exaggerated the issues with the game but their criticism was very much needed to get Bethesda to shape up. 
---
The only reason that Bethesda is putting time and effort back into FO76 is because Fallout is a lucrative IP.
---
Because people get weirdly emotionally invested in some games that causes them to be completely unable to look at them objectively with even a grain of intelligence.
---
if everyone keeps asking.  
---

---
maybe we'll get an answer.
---
This game is only gaining momentum
---
No, its actually closed. Sadly. I've tried three times waiting a good bit between relogs
---
Maybe theres a good reason why it's "cool" to hate on those things?????
---
I wouldnt say there shit out of luck, they can start a new character to play with there weak ass friend. It kinda screws with the plot of the game if you come out of the vault and theres human npcs all over the place. Following the path of the oversear wouldnt make alot of sense. Make them plug through for a couple hours before stability arrives in west virgina. I look at all this as an extension of the main quest line.
---
Is that why I failed? As soon as the camp counselor wendigo cane out it told me event failed. Did the fire just go out?
---
Yes because hiding our heads in the sand is how things improve yeah THATS a great idea 🙄
---
A god of 9 year olds is no god
---
There were a few, very few, posts regarding aimbotters in survival mode on this reddit between today and when that mode came out. My assumption is the free trial week in combination with nuclear winter has brought in an influx, albeit small, of those that don't want to play legitimately.
---
So impressive that you kept track of the bullets even!!!!
---
So for communication, what about just using your microphone? I mean if you don’t have one I can understand why you’d like to have emotes for it, but you’re really never going to get an emote that says,
---
“Hey drop the nuclear codes here so I can pick them up and use them to drop a nuke on the other team”
---
Sounds like 'Nam
---
Proof?
---
Yes I am the same way. Drives me nuts when someone just shows up and trys doong everything for you
---
And raider at lvl 15
---
Okay, I've been hearing  people scream cheater, but I'm glad we actually have some evidence of it.
---
Yeah everyone loves the fact they're still using the exact same engine as from fallout 3 in 2008 complete with all the same bugs modders fixed in 1 day. Yeah THAT has nothing to do with why people arent happy 🙄
---
Just sent you a request
---
For good reason?
---
Another idea: Give us the ability to hack them to reduce prices for like 30 minutes. Can reduce their prices dramatically depending on the level of Intelligence and how many hacker perks you have.
---
I would just like shelfs with stuff on them! Ones for kitchens and garages. Would be a great addition to camps!
---
hop servers again. should fix it.
---
" 16x THE DETAIL EVERYONE"
---
Yeah Todd has never lied whatsoever, never ever before. 
---
No but really how out of touch are you? Todd howards put more lies out of his mouth than games his company has published.
---
Or an ammo recycling platform.. trade a stack of 100 10mm for 150 .38 or 25 .308 for 25 shotgun shells
---
I'm guessing they're waiting until the sneak peak of the Nuclear Winter mode is over, so they can examine feedback, stats, and stability to see exactly how much work they need on it before they'll release a detailed roadmap.
---
Oh wait...Fallout 76 is free? Like the entire game? I thought it wasn't avaliable to download and you had to buy a CD or something but I'll look into it. I'm on the PS4 so I'd have to get PS4 online access again.
---
Yeah, I sold a Bloodied +50 limb damage gatling laser for 5k in a few days
---
You can find the corpse of the vault 51 overseer in the main game! I won’t say more
---
I think ghouls 1, super mutants 2, scorched and protectrons 3 and 4.  Maybe mole rats 5?
---
Proof? 
---
Edit: OH its you again wow you're really determined to keep that tin foil hat on arent you?
---
Same here. Asked me to complete 2 matches. Won a couple of matches and it did not clear.
---
That seems like it would be simple enough to do... The exception could be when you join a friends server who is a higher level then you. I'm sorry about your wife's loss of interest. Hopefully she gives it another try. Sharing fallout with the ones you love is the best.
---
Or are just haters ruining the game
---
He must've heard that some Jewish people worked on it.
---
Also the Ring of Fire song should be playing in the background.
---
I have mastered how to die.  
---
I can also do stupid crap that gets most of my team killed quickly.  
---
Would you like to know more?
---
I always wished you could hack the machines for better prices. I mean I'm not above outright stealing ideas from bioshock.
---
Fallout 76 has been one of my favorites for the past year. I was on deployment when it was announced and I was so excited that when I got home I had this game to look forward too.
---
I never really understood all the heavy backlash it took. I’m not saying there weren’t problems, but it felt more like a witch hunt and people just jumping on the bandwagon of hate.
---
I was so happy to see more and more content being added and with the announcement of NPC’s and everything else.
---
Finally, can we just point out this is such a better come back than No Mans Sky? Bethesda has put their money where their mouth is and it’s so great to see them succeeding.
---
I'm going to take my opinion more seriously than someone else's.
---
I hear the hand made rifle is a decent weapon 🤔
---
Part of me is hella Jelly, lack of obligations would be amazing. However, that being said, Somewhere out there you will find a reason to do things other than gaming. 
---
or...
---
Perhaps you'll luck out and find a Girl that when she sais "I play games, I enjoy video games" she actually means it and isnt referring to Spiro for PSX back when she was a teenager. 
---
Perhaps you'll luck out get more involved with games/gaming. Streaming, working with a studio on some aspect... who knows, just don't go for Chef position, fml that eats up your game and or family time like a mofo.
---
uhg, life. Some may also say, waddu hek, why waste your life playing so many games blah blah blah, It's seriously the most enjoyment I can get out of my day. Hell, I bought that Secret of Mana collection on the switch the other day. I've played SoM 1, and Sieken dinetsu or h/w its spelled, but damn they're fun games. Now I just need them to remaster that other one... that has a simular art style, but you are from the future, and you go back in time by acident, shit goes down, and you basically gather materials to build better stuff along you way, oh, and you have a crazy op Dog. Gaaaaaaaah I can't remember its name!
---
Yeah, this past week it's been free to try.
---
 Unsubbed.
---
This is great haha
---
I get that people hacking to be dicks is bad, but you gotta remember not to witchhunt.
---
Block all the doors in the ammo factory... lol no one will take it...lol
---
that’s nice ◠◡ ◠ yesterday i saw a level₂ heading toward grafton instead of the flatwoods and i decided to sort of herd them south. without any communication all i could just sort of do was take out enemies i knew they hit for xp sharing and dropped 100 of each ammo type. region chat would help so much.
---
i’m finding it hard to communicate with the newbies, even the team invites and trade invites are declined (mostly because it’s not a very good system to navigate.
---
good on you guys for your patience though
---
It is true. If you expect me to keep buying stuff from the atomic shop I need more room to build it. If I don’t have room to build then I won’t spend my Atoms mean I won’t spend my money on atoms
---
exploit falls under the umbrella of cheat
---
The last time I removed the perk of weight reduction had more than 2500 weight ... and logically my stash full XD.
---
I would love to see a bank to deposit long-term objects ... (ammunition, aids, some scrap, clothing and collection equipment ...)
---
Thanks for the link
---
Im not salty, this isnt an opinion piece if you noticed there not one personal sentence in there, I do play survival and I do well in it.
---
HOWEVER there's next to fuck all in it. 
---
Survival isn't end game content sorry to say bub. its an unbalanced mess. Your "elite end-game" is the upcoming vaults and the SBQ and nukes, and everyone has done it.
---
if you're perceiving it this way I believe you and your followers are mistaken. 
---
Survival right now, is ganging up on people who arent in parties, who arent geared out and spawn camping. these balances will fix it entirely, and I think you and your power fantasy trolls can go blow each other in adventure mode, while one hitting legendary enemies at events while others watch.
---
Anesthesia!!!! It is a little different than reddit... lol
---
Mule is typically same account, different character. You use someone as a middle man to transfer between the two of you. 
---
Unless you want to pay the exorbitant cost to have a second account and platform for it. Then by all means use the second account
---
I had to Google FOMO. I get that. I was just hoping they would tie the changes into the plot. Regardless, the experience has been good for.me and I'm glad I'm not FOMO. I hope I used that in the right context.
---
No just let it continue downloading
---
Alts yo!
---
Or the guy in PA with a TSE shooting the counselor with one shot so others can’t even get a shot in...
---
Ah my bad, I must have missed the when I made my psn. Crazy I've never noticed that though. It's been some time
---
He's about as relevant as MySpace.  Is that still a thing, BTW?
---
Honestly most of the stuff is good. I played when it first came out and was too buggy for me
---
They are missing out.
---
Agree their already too easy to get and they put items on sale everyday and quickly. Like something? Too expensive? Wait a month it could be up to 75% off.
---
They need better tools for everything unfortunately: /, I do not know how they have risked taking a game mode for masses and temporarily free without having covered their backs, it seems that they have not learned enough after all these months.
---
The worst part is that I still love Fallout 76
---
Secret of Evermore\*\*\*\*\*
---
Launcher gb remaining is bugged visual your dl is nor complete until it installs
---
What are some of the more major changes?
---
Also the FO76 app is very handy
---
No. I’m confused, why did you edit your comments instead of replying?
---
i would love this to be added, carnivore is one of my favorites to have and it’d make it so much more interesting. i can also imagine some herbivore casually eating the bark straight off a tree and that’d probably be something worth seeing as well
---
I imagine... but I wouldnt mind starting over if they "fix" all these duplicate perk cards coming up instead of new ones
---
I’m definitely going to have to try a few things with Camps as people have pointed out
---

---
The vault raids are coming with wastelanders not nuclear winter
---
Honestly almost a 2.0 metascore means it should have been a gif of a literal dumpster fire. People were just hoping to shit on it and once they saw it had some issues they jumped right on it
---
That's the first thing I noticed after the update. The ominous soundtrack is brilliant.
---
Or we can better utilize our space? I’ve never run into this problem aside from the times I was attempting to go well above and beyond and make my base a castle, and that’s pretty much going to crash the server, so I don’t actually recommend this at all. Better space management people, that’s all you need.
---
You're right, it's best to just file a report as /u/Melodicmutiny suggested.
---
Well max fire proof and iron clad will get you to 8. I know ironclad isn't that great but since you got all those points.
---
People will wait as long as they have to and still play it. Bethesda knows that
---
No worries I’m about to hit up a round of NW then we can meet up in adventure? I’m not really expecting anything for free lol but we can trade and see what’s up!
---
He’s still a thing? Who cares... guess they don’t have anything else to do but trash something...
---
I enjoy helping out new players too, I'm just looking for a way to make the changes fit with the plot. Part of the plot for me was the abandoned waste land that I/we restored to glory.
---
Explains a have I had yesterday. All four of us were alive in the center as the last of the flames came in but the fifth person was no where to be seen and when we all burnt to as the flames came in all the way we came in second and never saw the other guy
---
Yeah sure thing, I'll most likely be on again tonight
---
I want to like this game.  How do they charge me to move my camp then not allow me to build my stored camp?   And everywhere I look no one is saying how I'm supposed to build my stored camp.   The least they could do is give me my caps back.   What a rip off, as usual turning this game off in frustration.
---
they should allow the use of ultracite cores in any advanced power armor and that this would give them more melee damage, speed and less PA consumption by that more powerful power source
---
This was the same guy mentioned in another post. We really need some sort of anti-cheat.
---
Agreed. I think Fallout was slept on. 
---
NMS on the other hand didn’t have the same resources as Bethesda so I can see why their development has been lackluster. Both games have so much potential
---
There's no need to store almost all of the stuff you are storing.  
---
Aid,  junk items, non legendary Weapons/armor, none of that is worth keeping.  Legendary's are only worth keeping if you've already reached your daily scrip limit, it's an item you are 100% sure you will use but don't have the levels yet, or it's something you know you can trade.  
---
You will rarely need more than 100 of any individual down junk so if you have hundreds of junk and you never use it drop all but 100.  even 100 is overkill for stuff you never use.   Don't even deposit more junk if you already have 100 of it, just drop that shit on the ground for some new player to find.  
---
You will know what junk you need more of as time goes on and you run out constantly of one resource or another depending on your playstyle. 
---
And my bro there is no possible way at lvl 20 you need 3 PA frames.  ditch 2 immediately, just drop them for some other player that is a complete and total waste of space. at lvl 20 you can only use basic Raider PA parts and maybe t41 but there is literally zero need for PA frames collecting dust.  Those things are a dime a dozen.
---
There were plenty of audiences, we had a group of people that were pissed it wasn't another CRPG game or an Obsidian game, a group that hates Bethesda at every turn, a group pissed it wasn't Fallout 5, another that it wasn't Elder Scrolls and god it just kept going up. 
---
This game could have come out at launch how it is currently and gotten huge backlash.
---
I would do the bloodied so you can take on the imposter sheepsquatch in addition to the queen
---
I sit on an acid well for this exact purpose. Never buy ammo!
---
At your level the bast camp is to place one foundation, have a single staircase up, then build a small shack up there. Then you can place it pretty easy whenever you move your camp
---
Also, congrats on actually trying the most underrated game of the year. I can understand why some people don't like it (it takes a while to get used to the lack of NPC character), but this game doesn't deserve the hate it still gets for a bumpy launch (which I mainly attribute to rushing development and poor communication. Just announce it as "public beta" and that they will notify people once the game is truly ready). 
---
Okay, I'll get off my soapbox now.
---
I still see people on different sites (mainly twitter) bashing the game relentlessly. I really don’t understand the hate. I’m not a huge fan of it being online instead of a traditional Fallout game, BUT I gave it a chance and I’m enjoying it. I wish others would do the same
---
There's another hacker named NicePingForMe. This is a group, I'm pretty sure.
---
Did you file a report with Bethesda?
---
Where did you get it?
---
For sure! I’ll add you when I’m on next!
---
Same!
---
“...then they added a battle royal mode that no one thought they wanted until they tried it”. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 
---
Hit the nail right on the head. I agree, FO has been slept on this past year. I always try to get my friends to play with me and they end up deleting it after a few hours lol. 
---
Bethesda really played the waiting game because now I feel like it’s going to take off
---
It must be a glitch. Just die again and collect that loot to get rid of it
---
Find and use a good melee weapon in the beginning to save ammo for important targets. Later on you’ll be able to craft tons of bullets but they’re hard to come by initially.
---
Lemme guess. Was his name NicePingForMe? Or NiceNameForMe?
---
Definitely some glitchyness then as I've just logged on to adventure and the event is already going, I don't even need to go check.
---
Was he just tanking the fire with lots of stims? 
---
Seen ppl hide inside the nuke zone with a hazmat suit and wait for other players to die to the fire.
---
No email for me.
---
With player vending available, the npc vending machines are useless.
---
You're an idiot purchasing stuff from the npc vending machines; that's it.
---
Instead of this how about fixing the game issues surrounding the big bosses. Ie: Scorchbeast Queen, Sheepsquatch Impostor and others. These legendaries glitch out and don't take damage or they flat out disappear or leave the battle area altogether. Super BS when you consider all the damage done to my gear and weapons with no payout. Fix your game play before worrying about your Stupid Atom shop!
---
The only reason I'm personally refusing to play it is due to live service games becoming the norm and developers are releasing unfinished games to get the money now and fix it later.
---
Xbox stuff is hosted on Microsoft Azure, which is a cloud computing platform somewhere in the realm of Amazon Web Services and whatever Google's product is named (they're all good at something so it's hard to definitively name a rank).
---
They're all their respective companies database, hosting, etc. services - used internally and as services sold to other companies. For example, Amazon hosts the Amazon website on AWS, as well as renting servers and storage to Bethesda to run Fallout 76; and Microsoft is running all Microsoft services including Xbox on Azure as well as renting services out to Adobe and 3M plus others, etc.
---
What I'm getting at is that unless Sony is renting server space and computing to 3rd parties on the same platform as the Playstation network and all their internal stuff, even having twice the player base isn't actually twice the load versus how much server load is on the same platform as Xbox (since Xbox's total capacity is shared with, for example, the entire Office 365 platform).

### NUCLEAR WINTER
---
#### RELEASE: SUMMER 2019
---
Summer will bring another series of major updates to Fallout 76, including **Nuclear Winter** \- an entirely new way to play that changes the rules of the wasteland.
---
* **New Game Mode: Nuclear Winter** – An entirely new way to play Fallout 76, completely changing the rules of the Wasteland.
---
* **New Vault Raids: Vaults 96 and 94 Opening** – For our most seasoned players, test your strength in all new high-level group Vault Raids.
---
* **New Feature: Legendary Players** – An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities.
---
Straight from the roadmap.
---
Glad they r shipping out. I didnt buy any special edition but congrats all who finally getting the bag
---
I like the different ideas being suggested here! Thank you to everyone for your feedback :) Going to share this thread with the team now.
---
PS4 = Trash
---
I have played it many times but have always failed no one plays objectives
---
Yep!
---
Now we get to carry around out helmets to various places, in style.
---
What do we do for these NW camp stash boxes? Is there somewhere to open it
---
Awesome
---
That's why I want an actual group of people rather than just whoever shows up at the event
---
Ya, sometimes you get a sucky starting point and die really quickly.  Then you wait and wait.  Hopefully they can cut down some of that.
---
Nope can't do any of that
---
Ha! Thank you for that suggestion :) Sharing with the devs now
---
"I don't play it there for its dead!" This guy probably.
---
High level players shouldn't need workshops. Scrap is plentiful as is. You were right
---
This is a band-aid fix.  They said players will now spawn near your vending machines.  This is not true.  I've had players spawn *sometimes* near my machines, other times, far from the machines, other times, no-where near my CAMP.... I LOVED the way it worked before -- they always spawn where you first placed your CAMP device.  I have built my CAMPs all with this in mind, and have done specific builds around where people spawn.  Now, it's all ruined with this new method. All they needed to do was give us the FAST TRAVEL MATS that they had in BETA, and still have in the workshops.
---
So I'm not alone in that experience. I had the same thing happen to me
---
i already did report it an included the video.  just sharing with everyone .. Hacks are already here :)
---
Probably. There is also a 3 wave version of the final part without a wendigo. That one is even harder to keep the fire going. The kindling appears in the same 3 places as it did when you first collect wood for the fire.
---
So happy that you returned and are having fun :) Really love reading these kinds of stories. Keep having fun everyone
---
An option to leave the game straight into the lobby to another game would be great, also really wish there was solos or duos.
---
Current state of the majority of the bugs being worked out yes. People returning to the wasteland after we stabilized it should be part of the plot. It's the achievement of being so badass that you've destroyed everything threatening that humble settlers can now come to live in peace. The requirement for NPCs to be there right away is the equivalent of the real princess wasnt even in the first castle ugh.
---
Only thing clear was that there was two types... those that were actually banned and those that were suspended until a fix happened. 
---
The difference was that players that were banned were told that they were banned from all Bethesda games and that their account will be permanently banned. 
---
Many others received a suspension notice for multiple reasons... even being in possession of a certain item like ultracite ammo in many cases. 
---
Those accounts received a message saying their accounts would be restored later once the issue was fixed.
---
Nuclear Winter, the new content, allows for about 30 seconds of game play per 10 minutes wait time.  So, you are not missing much.
---
Thank you for reading it! It was a bit rushed as I wanted it up while the other post was relevant. Bad timing with the flood of NW posts. This was a nice surprise.
---
Ok Bethesda Engineer... EHM.... I mean totally real person on the internet....
---
Turn off auto-team thing before joining Nuclear Winter.
---
You can claim from anywhere inside the buildable area. Looks cool though.
---
Yea, we just had this happen between 3 of us a little bit ago. I had it happen last night. It’s a big PITA.
---
Why was the video deleted?
---
Thanks everyone. Knew faschnacht was limited. Wish I would’ve done that but oh well. I’m sure it’ll be back at some point.
---
It’s not bad as most people think, but it’s bad when you compare it with other weapons.
---
Seriously we need V.A.T.S related perk when using pistol. 
---
Also i want more kind of pistol too. 
---
10mm, 44, single action, western are all we got
---
In your mind, sure, but they're different words with different definitions. It's like smart and intelligent. They may be used interchangeably but that doesn't mean they're being used correctly, you just get what they meant to mean.
---
And play against squads alone??? I’d rather have random teammates lol
---
Australian gamers such as myself who bought the PA edition haven't heard anything about ours yet.... /\_\\
---
5 month old comment. :P
---
How about some new perks! Ones that work in stash space. I would pick that for my store!
---
Pick up all the plastic you can find and bulk your junk at a tinkers workbench, to save on stash space. And don’t latch onto out of level weapons, you can and will find better guns. Most everything should be seen as relatively temporary until you hit level 50
---
That sucks, it’s gotta be coming soon.
---
That's a good point. I keep forgetting it's beta still.
---
how do you protect your gear
---
Ya you can. Takes a second person to transfer or you can take a risk and leave the stuff in something like a mailbox, log out, log into the second character, join someone on that server and collect the items. Totally able to transfer between characters. 
---
Caps, buy something off a friend for the amount you want to transfer, then have them do the same for your second account.
---
Camp mcclintock is good for balistic fiber, green country lodge and Charleston fire station is good for lead from the weights. Places with super mutants are good for steel from scraping weapons. The perk card scrapper is a must if ur gonna scrape gear
---
Well if I had PC  I would. Wish you luck.
---
Isn't the Blackbird paint Enclave?  I don't have X-01 and have never seen it on anyone in game though.
---
How big is your C.A.M.P.? Mine is very basic (maybe 20% of my total budget allowance) and the longest that it takes to fully and functionally spawn in, is about 10 seconds. If you have a massive C.A.M.P. with large amounts of resources being tapped into - yeah, it'll probably be awhile before it's fully ready to use. 
---
Everything has its benefits and penalties. I enjoy faster load in with less quality of life. You enjoy a better quality of life with slower load in wait. It's not designed to be that way - it just turned out like that.
---
You’ll settle into a groove and matches will last longer. Try spawning into smaller more nondescript spots on the map and gearing up before heading into named places. Starting at the edge of the map helps too.
---
Yeah got the email too. Well we did it guys, congrats!
---
The luck perk about picking up extra chems is a good one to take early in a play through because you get lots of chems and stimpacks that you can use and sell.
---
Is there any way to communicate with your teammates? Its frustrating me not to tell where enemies are and all that stuff..
---
Exactly. If people realize that this isn't meant to be just another fallout game, then they'll actually have some fun cause everything new this game offers, I think, is good additions
---
Launcher works fine for every single other person I've ever spoken with. Maybe you had a technical hiccup in downloading and it got corrupted? that happens.
---
Did all that, thanks though.
---
So, what will you put in it
---
Your on PC right?
---
If you're on PS4, I'd be happy to repair your weapons for you and drop you some spare ammo.
---
Yes, I already did
---
Nothing increases your camp budget.  Anyone who tells you about a 'trick" to increase your camp budget is either pulling your leg or misinformed.
---
Love this idea. I couldn’t help but think of John Henry doing the whole the Excavator armor / mining automation sub plot.
---
I watched shroud play yesterday and one match he killed 23 some odd players! I dont think tge fallout crowd is ready for players like that lol
---
You don't say... ;)
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bzkhjy/theory_vault_51_is_a_simulation_and_zax_is/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Like all other fo games....
---
nessa porra :)
---
I will find a friend eventually
---
Maybe choose your deployment better. 
---
I've only played twice but fortunately I watched a video before and it said don't deploy on named places. 
---
Both times my teammates did but spawned off to the side. 
---
First time I remembered a campsite nearby and I got a scoped lever for my efforts. 
---
2nd time literally each of my teammates spawned right on a hostile players. I arrived just in time to slaughter the guy who slaughtered them.
---
Great idea! I havent looked in these vending machines since I was level two or three. It would give them a purpose. And really who built all these vending machines that take "caps"? Dollar Bill's makes much more sense.
---
Stuff, maybe things, who knows?
---
Actually, i have a queastion as well.
---
Can emotes be seen from players outside group?
---
Seen it happen where a teammate emotes then is killed very shortly after.
---
They should tell us with some text or something. Ps4 service was going out today also it did not help the frustration. Lol
---
As always, I'll share this with the devs. Thank you (and everyone) for taking the time to give your feedback on this :)
---
Im on PC, but thanks for the offer! I just need to actually try and focus on fixing stuff. At the start i only cared about building my camp, and now that that's pretty much done i can explore the world fully.
---
Yesterday I learned I can only place a total of 50 light sources. May seem like a lot but it really isn't when i'm trying to string a bunch of Christmas lights around my house. I'm no where near max budget either.
---
Good for them.   
---
I don't get this nutty "I WANT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THIS THING, WHY ARE YOU MAKING IT HARD FOR ME TO TAKE THIS THING".   
---
You have a couple options, from less shitty person to more shitty person. Less shity person option...server hop. Someone wants that junkyard, they're defending it, means they're using it. You can be a decent person and let em keep it. Sack of shit garbage human option...destroy their shit and take it over.
---
As a Battlefield and Fortnite player I must say. This game has GREAT POTENTIAL!! I'm excited for what it can become. Bethesda please listen to feedback and make it better every patch!!
---
So yeah. Ban bomb and the suspension blast wave. I just wanted to give it a fallout esk name because i'm bored. Spark conversion and thought.
---
I also find the interaction of some items in the vault strange and wonder if there is a pattern like in fallout 3 to reveal a secret area or control panel. 
---
There is even a pair of sunglasses in the gym that you can equip .. an oversight or part of the requirements to see the hidden/secret thing?
---
If u want to pew pew or slap people stick with one path
---
We're definitely committed to supporting this game :) Best way to stay up to date is follow our fallout social media (ie twitter or Facebook) and keep an eye out for news about our updates. Fallout dot com is also where we house news and info for all our updates and patch notes, including our roadmap for future content!
---
A seperate mode would be beeter for this.
---
Do not give up it gets better.
---
I never played BR beofre and my first Nw game my "team" got all boxes and i was unarmed and scared in a rain of bullets in the mid of Helvetia. I died fast.
---
Last games i run solo. Chose a lonely spot on map. Get weapons and armour and stalk. I last a lot more and even got some drops. 
---
So beyond all first games "what the hell is this?!" it gets better. \^\^
---
Update: Up now in US at least.
---
I mean, the munitions factory isn't worth it. (just like every other workshop, the headache from griefers is way to high for the shitty returns). 
---
But nah, the griefer sack of shit is the asshole.
---
Yea I have a level 165 a level 30 and a level 10... on my level 165 I have more problems with people trying to kill me but it is still few and far between
---
Whitesprings I believe. Maybe Westek. The only good legendary I’ve found and it’s only two stars
---
Degenerates like cheaters belong on a cross
---
My problem was installing it :)
---
With NW we really need this. Just make it 1 tab of everything you own
---
Who cares about what that dog whistling nazi thinks?
---
Fun fact. I have \_never\_ been able to add wood to the fire. Not at a single tale. I gather wood, shoot bugs, find missing camper crap...but I flat out \_cannot\_ add wood to the fire, because this is a buggy fucking game.    
---
So I hang out on the roof and cover the people who do.
---
Especially cause i cant find the gift emote anymore. Its completly disappeared
---
Just post it to YouTube and send Bethesda a link.

Apparently from the shelf in the bridge's generator room to the floor is not close enough for the double barrel. I had some guy dead to rights and got both barrels off and his armor shrugged it off and he got me with a radium rifle during my reload. I had a submachine gun before that but he was the fourth person into the room and I was out of ammo for it.
---
You can respec after level 50 but one level at a time.
---
I don't know about you, but I ditch my vault suit in the vault before picking a spawn point. 1.1lbs of useless.

Don't like it then leave. Downvoted

Thank YOU for sharing this with everyone buddy

Perhaps help make sure that link is highly visible? This subreddit is a far easier place for someone to attempt to make a report than Bethesda's own website.

Go to junk, press the components button and mark screws. You will never have enough screws. Also good are springs, lead, plastic, acid, ballistic fiber but screws are vital.
---
Take your sweet time in the forest, then head north. Take your sweet time there, then head south and take your sweet time there. The other two thirds of the map can spawn stupidly high level enemies so you want to be ready.
---
Don't rush the plot. In fact, feel free to abandon it if you don't like it. It &gt;!doesn't really go anywhere and involves a bunch of back and forth tedium in the middle!&lt;, but you can start the later stuff at any time without doing the earlier stuff.
---
Try to have an idea of what sort of weapons and playstyle you want. You can experiment with different weapons and styles in Nuclear Winter, which is handy.
---
Running away is often a good option. You can come back from high ground, or stealth, or just bugger off. Some enemies are really tough and they might not drop anything of value.
---
Alternatively it is totally possible to keep dying, respawning and charging at an enemy until they die. I did this once, but it isn't very fun.
---
Pick up every weapon you can to scrap them, it’s how you unlock mods for them. Also set up your camp around a lead deposit for bullet crafting.
---
I don't run heavy guns at all but a few recommendations here anyway.  
---
\-Get the fireproof perk in endurance and max it out.  Lessens explosive damage significantly.
---
\-Get rid of your 3 luck perks and take bloody mess instead.  It's a flat 15% damage increase on all weapons.  
---
\-You probably want to get starched genes and class freaks to keep your mutations and mitigate the negatives of having them.  I would ditch all but 3 of your endurance perks and put them in luck.
---
\-5 points is about all you need in intelligence.  You have crafting perks there that you can swap in when you are at a workbench.  They are just using up valuable spots being active all the time.
---
\-Bullet shield isn't that good.  Use those 3 points in strength and pick 1 rank in slugger, master slugger, and expert slugger.  Melee is powerful when using power armor and it gives you a nice way to conserve ammo on weak enemies.
---
Like I said I'm not an expert in heavy guns.  So take it for what its worth.
---
Good luck out There!
---
You don’t have to if you have an atom shop outfit (not under armor). But I did notice that as soon as I equipped armor my outfit went back to the vault suit. That being said, I think this is a worthy gripe and something they can adjust for when the game comes out for real.  I only have the nuka girl outfit and I would like to keep it on for longer than a couple minutes.
---
You get an upvote!
---
Definitely might as well not exist at this point.

Give ‘em the ol’ Joshua Graham? Set them on fire and push them into the Grand Canyon?

Nuts
---
...read what I said again. Your file was probably _corrupted while downloading_. Spotty wifi/iffy cables/internet can have this happen sometimes. 
---
Delete the downloaded file, uninstall the launcher, and download the file again. 
---
The issue _isn't_ the launcher, it's your pc/internet connection.
---
That would make melee even more useless than it is in that game mode
---
When you get to level 50 you will have the choice to respec a single point or get a new perk card.
---
We got milk machines and nuka cola machines. Just give them a instanced small weight capacity. Boom. I can finally make food again insted of eating ionized meats and dogfood!
---
  Nan, this one doesn't even interest me.
---
I want to see normal content. If I understood correctly if I chose “pacifist” or something option I can just ignore all other players and explore

---
this game's servers can't track client actions accurately so it makes random guesses like "idk kill both players at the same time i guess" like it's a p2p arena shooter from 2006
---
What system are you on?
---
Very useful advice! Hope to see you all out there soon :)
---
You want to strap as many weapons as you can to unlock mod plans for the guns. Same goes for armor. Ledge dart you’ll want to turn into a machine at the railroads for scrip to trade in for a lottery of a weapon.
---
But no longer part of Adventure Mode no damage to other players and such. Slap Damage 0
---
This.  I'm so sick and tired of coming to the event, doing almost the ENTIRE thing all by myself, and some dude shows up at the last second as the final boss spawns (or in the final wave of the insect ending) and just smashing the boss themself and I get nothing.
---
There is also a “Wise” variant that is always friendly.
---
Uff-da.

Fortnite was a PvE game before it had battle royale. It will be interesting to see what happens next.

Nah, it's good.

Interesting. I appreciate the input.
---
What are some of the bigger quality of life changes
---
It's better to start properly, let them make their own gear. There's not much exciting you can do for a level 2 anyway, and caps are easy to find at low levels. If you have a really cool level 5 piece of legendary gear then pass that on, but you don't want your 2nd character to be in hand-me-downs forever.
---
yes please!
---
Where can i find backpacks btw?
---
I had the same thing happen the other day. Logging out and back in twice fixed it for me.
---
Yeah, if the Atom Store is the method for choosing NW skins, they need to give us a current loadout screen with all the skin categories (PA, PA-Helmet, outfit/underarmor, X weapon skin, Y weapon skin, etc.). You click on the current and it goes to the category with your bought items all at the top, followed by the limited-time, then deal items.
---
At level 12, not worth rerolling. No matter the build you will need points in most special. At level 50 you can move points. As for build its based on playstyle. I think my most fun is my big guns (started as a pistol character), but I also enjoy my auto rifle and my support builds.
---
Solved initial problem.
---
Here we go

He should've crouched then. Arrow only shows up when standing.
---
Is that the save a player in water? Cause the other one you just need to pick up a player anywhere. Ill be on. A little later and i need the water one.
---
Literally been that argument for a while now.
---
Good point. I added the link to the post. Reading the sidebar on reddit mobile is something you have to go out of your way to do, and not a lot of people know it’s a thing.
---
Play in adventure without using vats for a while and you'll pick it up. Also, use automatic weapons whenever possible and fire in bursts or get close. Skip the shotguns because you still need to aim them accurately to get all the pellets on target, and manual rifles and revolvers are just too slow if you miss a lot.
---
It's worth it to keep going because you've got a lot of points to come, and once you hit level 50 you can choose between a perk card or moving a point from one special to another, for example -1 strength for +1 luck
---
Pioneer scout camp do the missions to get it
---
regretting something and calling something a "massive screwup" are not the same thing man.
---
my attitude towards cheating has always been that i just do not care as long as what they are doing does not impact other players experience. 
---
if a guy wants to mod his game so he can always see the sweet spot or correct answer when lock picking or hacking then whatever you do you. 
---
its when some douche canoe is crashing the server by duping ten thousand stimpacks or making himself immortal and destroying PvP that i get upset.
---
When i started playing i didn't know what to do or what to go for. I just went with my instincts of getting the reduced weight perks for like ammo, food , aid items. Etc. But once i got into the game i wanted to do a melee build , therefor i started assigning my points to whatever my build was and this was almost at level 25. Once i got to 50 i had to reroll some points and then at level 65 decided to switch from melee to heavy weapons. Having to respec again made it a fun grind, but is what you make of the game. Don't go for a meta build because you are going to reach end game before you even know it and then you are going to get burned off. Just play for fun and experiment. Trust me you are not missing on anything if you mess your perk assignment. Have fun!
---
pc!
---
Yer alright boaahhhh
---
Hopefully they will fix the "join another NW game" after you die. And shorten the times to play.
---
Step one. Make sure _everything_ beyond insect parts for campfire tales in your scrap section is...scrapped. 
---
Step two. Look at the weapons you use, and your armor. Look at what it takes to repair that. Look at what it takes to make ammo you want to use. Are you building a base? Look at what you want to build there. Is there something in your stash that isn't on any of those lists? Drop everything but 20 of it. Or bundle it and sell it (I personally don't bother with that, but you do you). 
---
Aid items. Don't store _any_ in your stash, unless you're vending them. 
---
And make a mule and have a friend help shuttle shit over that you just can't make yourself get rid of.
---
Ring of fire ?

Just saw this posted...

But how do we know if they're a witch

Do they float?

Oh, that's why it wasn't working. I was going put so Vintage Nukashine in it.
---
Contagion had such potential.....
---
Except from the patchnotes you cannot do slap damage to low level players it said Slap damage was set to zero.
---
No. They need to sell their dog food to me.
---
Are they made of WOOD!?
---
I’ve given out tons of food and ammo and random weapons to the new folks who’ve been playing this week.
---
Thanks for update. I was having a bugger of a time figuring out how to submit a ticket from my phone last night. Now I won't clog the tubes.
---
Nope, it's an ambient track. I played around 10 games and it showed up in every single one
---
Hold them under water for a while. If they live they're a witch, so you should burn them.
---
How are your settings looking? Didn't anything change with voice chat?
---
I got my interest peaked again with the nukashine update, but this is the first time that I’ve felt super engaged with the game. The rewards are such fun, and I constantly look forward to leveling up. Yes there’s the problem with the duplicate cards, and occasional bad teammates, but overall it’s an amazing mode and I’m having a blast.
---
A section on the camp build menu for "newly unlocked" items would be nice, too
---
There’s no doubt that the free week was planned to be during the release of nuclear winter. Whether you have a problem with that is up to you. I would argue that they put more work into wild Appalachia. I’m glad that this free week has brought many new players to try the game. From what I’ve been reading, new players are really enjoying Fallout 76. Im glad that the game is finally being viewed in a positive light as opposed to when people were scared to touch the game because of how poor reviews were. I doubt Bethesda would attract many new players if they were to offer a free week any week before the battle royale released. I believe they were trying to attract a new type of player.
---
I did 3 times and again today.
---
I have never bought anything from the original vending machine or the vendor except plays and a couple  pieces if clothing early on! Lolol
---
Maybe one day
---
Make sure you scar junk before you put it in trash
---
For me it was the update that gave us brewing. My main character was an alcoholic and this gave for great camps.
---
For Role Playing he went from an alcoholic to someone who started making his own and in the process of making it himself and making it a hobby he started making bars, he still drinks but now is far more about sharing the love in the wasteland.
---
I haven't opened settings in this session yet and I just logged out but I'll check once I'm in, but thanks
---
Maybe Beth is just throwing in subtle ironic programming puns?
---
You drop seemingly random stuff too. So i pick up all things aid related to lessen the number of stims i drop. Spoiled foods potato crisps you name it tons of junk aid helps.
---
It's on auto voice chat mode
---
Fasnatch Parade was my jumping back on point. I know it was a short run thing but it was a lot of fun and by that point the stash problem had been fixed, as had the bugs. Well many of them. Some of them. Anyway I can’t pin why but it felt way more addictive second time around.
---
Calling bollocks - not on the false advertising, but at how much oUtRaGe there should be. They edited it pretty early on, so the number of people impacted by incorrect advertising are a minor percent. And again, most of us got the power armour addition for the power armour, not the bag the power armour was stored in.     
---
And again - the bulk of people complaining didn't even buy that edition. Most of us who did don't give a flying fuck.
---
So you mean that the only way you can communicate is with mic.. I'm from Spain and I've never played with Spanish people if these guys don't speak my language I can't chat with them
---
Not what I meant. There are rad showers all over. As in literally all over the default map, there's usually one within 5-10 caps of you travel cost wise. Most of them are in highly irradiated areas so it's easy to get radiation there and then also scrub it off for free. For instance, [Emmett Mountain Disposal Site](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/8/81/EmmettMountainDisposalSiteInterrior.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/640?cb=20181118014345). As you can see in this pic, there are stacks of barrels that will irradiate the piss out of you and just through the door thats in the middle of the pic are 3 rad showers you can activate with the push of a button. There is also a power armor suit spawn in here as well as a deathclaw and the prototype hazmat suit. Lots of goodies for and adventurer lookin for cheap upgrades and mutations.
---
Honestly, unless you're carrying a lot of booze/water/canned foods? I don't even bother with through hiker anymore. Keep like 10 cooked food on you and have done.
---
I can but I have 2 accounts
---
I’ve got a 6 week trip planned in September and I can’t wait but a small part of me is like “I wonder what I’ll miss!”. Not that I’d trade the trip for anything, but I wish I could Atom shop out of my PS
---
Well, someone doesn't live in a McMansion IRL. Superfluous shit is the foundation of our society.
---
I was scared for a second, because I play as a witch.
---
I swear, I'm docile!
---
Not if you are even half way decent
---
Good thing about heavy weapons, all str based, and melee is very good to start you off
---
sure, keep telling yourself that bandwagoning is a good thing.
---
A very minuscule amount, sure. If they want the mode to actually succeed they’re going to have to release way sooner.
---
What’s the karma one? And roses I think was just for quest
---
you can only use outfits and headwear in NW the tactical suit is an under armor... that's why you can't wear it... only the actual outfits can be worn like grognaks, manta man etc
---
I'll take your explosive zealots if you don't want it
---
Same! I'm happy its finally coming now.
---
The problem I have is the new players are being encouraged to play battle royale. I mean look at the messages at the main menu.
---
How this is not a concern to fallout fans I do not know.
---
I just got my email as well. Fingers crossed the bag turns out well.
---
Correct
---
Lol a comment had never been more true. It always comes back to baby shark!
---
What they've shown of the Wastelander's dlc it's got far more in common with FO3 and New Vegas. Also, the battle royale mode is just one bit of the Nuclear Winter content, there's also the vault raids on the way. People are just excited about the new mode at the moment because it makes a refreshing change from farming Whitespring and it's actually a lot of fun without any complications.
---
I am a tank build (mostly) in adventure and stealth sniper in survival.  It’s mostly in adventure that people try to gank and pull stupid shit and that’s pointless with a melee weapon against my build.  Heavy dmg and heavy dmg reduction.
---
But that’s not how ghouls work? People already got pissed about super mutants being in the game. Don’t ask them to change lore to fit what some are asking for
---
Honestly I’ve been on board since I bought the game, but before I bought it I had no interest.
---
I just started doing the no auto fill teams option and I like it a lot better. I’m a lone wolf, yo. 😄
---
You left out not a single thing I could think of. Nicely written.
---
Another Dad here chiming in on the joy that I've found in the Fallout series.
---
Pushing 50  (yeah, I'm the old dad) with a 3 and 6 year old, so my gaming hours are far a few between. Basically once everyone has gone to bed I get play, mic. muted though.
---
Having grown up in the console era of Atari, Colecovision, Intellivision, etc. it's wonderful to be able to find a community within the game that is active and available in real-time.
---
My team role generally consists of being a bullet sponge, absorbing the swarm of baddies, and promptly dying while others clear the remnants. Re-spawn, rinse and repeat, I love it!
---
When I solo, I'll run a sniper build and build up a hoard of things that I could never fully make use of. So now with vending being a thing, I can sell my exploits at a price that keeps folks well stocked and ready to roll in Appalachia. There is certainly something for everyone in this game.
---
Man, I miss when my pet, Dianna the Deathclaw, would do that she sadly had a heart attack and passed away on my porch. :+
---
This is where I draw a line. IMO Bethesda are underhandedly being very scummy, with fallout and with its fanbase. Obviously it must be more subtle then I thought. But its there alright.
---
Huh..weird. there was a thread on it earlier today. Good shot my resident
---
sometimes we’re hungry
---
Are you being sure to pick up "kindling"? I didn't realize it was looking for kindling the first time I was in it and thought it needed wood...

I price matched at target today so I could get back into the game

---
literally 100% I cannot place a small budget item. My point is, if we had all 24 players with max or near max budget on an increased budget without solving this issue, the servers are not going to be happy.
---
Because eating dog food all the time gets old. I can practically feel my character’s depression as he cracks open another tin. By which I mean, I’ve got to find ways to keep myself interested in the game; crafting different food/drinks is one of those, but not when it all expires so quickly. As it stands, the refrigerated backpack feels rather superfluous, and ice cold drinks could easily make it into something I’d covet.
---
I wonder if that's why it took so long to get a road map sorted, them not being sure exactly what they were going to do.
---
Yeah same here. No real purpose to them at the moment.
---
I'd prefer guillotine, but hey whatever works
---
I don’t think you get to keep them. Rose takes them back
---
Im suprised with how nuclear winter is pretty much bug free i havent had 1 problem with it yet and i got 5 wins last night. So fun
---
Upvoted! Totally agree with these, and it would also add to the lore as well.
---
Ps4, I logged out again I can invite people to trade now but no voice chat they all have the mute symbol next to their name, is that something on their end?
---
If they burn, they’re not a witch

---
What platform are you on? The games themselves are regionally coded to the region of the platform you have. I would say you're likely in the clear, but if you want to buy new games it may be best to buy a console (and F76) in Canada so you don't have to purchase from an EU store.
---
What tamed pets are there?  How does one tame a pet?  Do they work like a companion?
---
BR is a fad that will die out in time.  Don't get all worked over it.  
---
In any event there is still a huge demand for single player rpg's and I'm sure fo5 will be exactly that.
---
I just played it for the first time too. I think the game has great potential, I am really surprised. And its great that you want to support it and make it better. 
---
But I have one question: Are you planning to overhaul the User Experience regarding Menus, Interface, hotkeys? As a pc player I feel forced to use a controller to play this game, with mouse and keyboard all the menus feel really... bad. Yeah, it is bad. Are you going to overhaul this? 
---
Then I might buy the game in the future. :) Thanks.
---
Im not saying we should have unlimited budget, but it seems reasonable to have something like a 50% budget increase over a couple months.
---
Me too bay bay
---
In PvP its range based game so without team melee is useless and with team its crap. In PvE its 2h for PA and unarmed for regular armor.
---
Same as the vox syringer would love to have it permanently
---
thats sad..she probably ingested too many mole rats i heard they are high in cholesterol
---
    Hope this helps.. 
---
     If you meant the assaultrons and other 'bots in Watoga hassling you, then complete the quest "Mayor for a Day". After that, they leave you alone permanently (unless you pick a fight with them).
---
    The Marsupial mutation is one of the best you can get, but don't feel bummed out about losing it. Lots of players these days sell the serum pretty cheaply, or you can acquire it again through high rads. HOWEVER - if you want to KEEP it (yup, radaway wipes it out, as you've found out) then you'll need to equip a level 2 Starched Genes perk card as soon as you've got it. It'll let you keep the mutation permanently even if you remove the rads.
---
    As for not being a hoarder, it was worse when the stash limit was only 400! It's still too small, but there's junk everywhere and you learn to prioritise and realise that you should only take what you need. Oh, and between power armour pieces being attached on to a frame to lower their weight, along with the right perk cards to lower weight of chems, weapons and junk, it's manageable. It just takes some getting used to!
---
