Almost ready to launch
---
---
---
I basically avoided teaming up (except for a few isolated incidents like defend events) until I was level 40ish. Frankly I liked taking my sweet time to explore and listen to holotapes in peace as I trekked along. Once I completed most of the mainline quests, I stumbled across players who were fun to help out, and gave me my first legendary.
---
Back in my day, we had to level a new character to 15. Precisely 15 or you overlevelled and lost access to it. Took several dozen server hops to get it to spawn at either Watoga or Wallace. Bad times...
---
It says ya offline
---
I have seen huge gaming sites giving fo76 2.3 of 10. Surely no one would be playing it if its that bad.
---
I remember those days 😔
---
Built in power units like batteries. Probably fusion cores of some kind.
---
ROFL, I have the PAE, I know what the "quality" of the helmet is, I definitely could use my ender3 and make one just as high quality. Not to mention like I said the electronics can easily be salvaged from 2$ flashlight from the dollar store. Paint isn't expensive either.
---

---
Lets look at it like this, the PAE was roughly 200 bucks. lets remove 60 for the base game, and another 20 for the nylon bag and other odds and ends. That leaves the cost to replicate the helmet to be 120$. I could make it out of real metal for that price. Let alone 3d print is. 
---
The only time I have had failed prints is when I screwed something up myself. The helmet would be a joke to print as there are already tons of files on thingaverse and minimaker for the helmets. So no, you are completely wrong about not being able to 3d print the helmet for cheaper than it cost by buying the PAE. LOL
---
Level 5
---
Generators powered by fusion cores
---
Did you check your stash? Occasionally they'll glitch out and delist everything. I've never heard of stuff completely disappearing.
---
it just works, that's how.
---
Is it actually completly gone or did it just unload into your stash? Unloading into the stash can happen frequently
---
I don't think so. I had it for a long time and finally bought serums to the mutations I wanted and took some radaway to get rid of it. But I believe the consensus is that this is caused by plague walker somehow.
---
*next time on hoarders buried alive*
---
extremely good batteries (unlike the real world), that up until recently (i.e. when the player takes them) are powered by extremely reliable (unlike the real world) fusion generators
---
I actually didn’t know, but wasn’t exactly trying to level for it. TIL
---
Launched!
---
OH. MY. GOD.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's there!!!!! Thank you haha
---
World is full. Good luck.
---
3* Weapon: Buy 100 sc/Sell 40 - Each ‘reroll’ costs you 60 scrip. 
---
2* Weapon: Buy 50 sc/Sell 15 - Each ‘reroll’ costs you 35 scrip. 
---
To be honest, I don’t find the tertiary/minor effects worth the 25-50 extra scrip.  +1 to physical stat, some situational damage resistance/reduction, reduced weight on a single weapon, etc., just doesn’t feel worth that to me.
---
Nope I checked the stash. That's what is making me mad is that it the items are all gone. There was some decent items too.
---
When you put PA on I believe it nullifies the other armor you are wearing.
---
For the life of me i cannot get the sight ring from scrapping!
---
would be nice to have the map extended on any side bethesda chooses to be the glowing sea area to traverse in
---
Yep
---
Nope I checked the stash, these items are no where to be found, or I'm just dumb
---
Holy ship Captain!
---
I was thinking last night about building a ship as a base, but didn’t get into how I would do it. 
---
This is great. Well done. 
---
I’d give you more upvotes if I could for teaching me that items can be built entirely underwater.
---
In fact, because I also wear unyeilding armor pieces, I rarely wear PA anymore unless I'm fighting the SBQ and even then if the placement of the nuke is right, I don't have to do that.
---
Great news and all, but is patch 10 going to fix the melee-can't-hit-flying-creatures-in-vats problem?
---
Ah, so that explains why I've seen some camp crops that can't be harvested, but world crops are almost always available.
---
Nuclear power.
---
Same here, honestly.  It seems like everything in camp grows really fast, even junk
---
Damn...
---
I'm almost certain I have those plans in my vending machine. Either that or plasma mine. I'll look when I get home. I'll keep y'all posted.
---
Yeah I can't argue with that. He might wanted to separate the quests and the event but in the end they are the same DLC.
---
You get them for launching nukes?? I thought you could only get them in the Atom Shop.
---
I managed to do this last night, and a 3 star lvl 100 sqautch drops me a 1 star. That was a real kick in the jewels. Come on Bethesda,
---
It’s plasma mine.  I’ll save you the time.  Hahaha
---
I don't have a lot of crops, but visitors are welcome to take what they want at my place.  Crops, water, and even junk from the extractor.  But I do respect others' desire to say who can and can't take their stuff.
---
I wish that there was more than one song. I guess it was too much of a hassle to write parts for all of the different instruments. Wasted opportunity if you ask me.
---
[removed]
---
I don't get it. FCs are everywhere. I dropped 3, 75% cores today to reduce weight.

Thank you 
---
Only some things can be built. It wouldn't let me place a fusion generator just the windmills. Even tried on a foundation. 
---
Fun fact: you can build a bed and literally sleep with the fishes
---
Your non-PA armor mods, such as pocketed for example, don’t apply while in PA. 
---
I run into the same issue. My Excavator Armor with Calibrated Shocks puts me at 395. But in my Pocketed armor, I’m at 320, so I’m not getting the ‘full effect’.
---
Appreciate that lol. I knew it was plasma something
---
They aren't interested in paying attention to the details of the game ..... just in selling it to people who haven't bought it yet.
---
cynical me ...... but the same issue has plagued the "Marine Buttressed" and "Marine Treated" mods since BETA  ... 10 minute syntactical fix to a lazy employee created problem .... its not even a programming/coding issue, and it rates a ZERO on the priority charts.
---
Your request just hit the "Ignore" pile.
---
But like check because I swear to God it’s not in the game.
---
love it.
---
Yep they are correct. All my armor is 20% weight reduction and getting in PA make me a fat ass
---
Yep. Thanks. Duh. I should have thought if that
---
Yup.  You get three repair kits for every completed SBQ killed.  So you have to launch nukes on the SBQ to get them.
---
No, I purchased the PAE for all of the items. As I said above, if it were just the helmet and the game I wouldn't have purchased it as I own multiple 3d printers I could easily have printed the helmet myself and bought the base game and saved myself 100$.
---
But I chose to buy the PAE because not only would I get the helmet I'd also get a nice canvas bag I had planned on using as my gym bag, the nylon bag that came with the PAE is garbage, it was fraying before I even got it out of the packaging, and now after using it only a handful of times the zipper has already completely separated from the nylon.
---
So you are incorrect. I sure as hell wasn't about to pay 200$ for a plastic helmet I could print myself, but I got it because it had MULTIPLE things I wanted. One of those included the CANVAS bag.
---
A lot of kids are finished or basically done with school for the summer, so you are going to see a noticeable uptick in douchey and annoying behavior now unfortunately.
---
That is gonna be based entirely on luck*
---
But the legendary effects still work? I thought even the legendary effects were cancelled out as well.
---
Same here, except I got wood armor which glitches out if it's multistar and makes it just one star.
---
All the big guns need a huge buff.  Missile launcher, Fat Man, Grenade launcher, the fucking Cannon ball Gun thingy.  I really want to use these weapons but until they fix them its not worth it.
---
Specs would help!
---
It wasn't like that on Amazon, even after they shipped the nylon bag and people were complaining it still claimed it came with a "canvas" bag and nowhere did it state "subject to change".
---
They added the "Bag is not the correct representation of the product" after release. "Image is of a prototype" is standard stuff but that usually means the colors or some of the art might be slightly different, it never refers to a material swap. (Source: I collect figures and I've never had a prototype do a bait and switch. That said, I really don't care about the Baglash and think the whole thing was taken way out of proportion)
---
Finally someone that understands
---
That was a typo. I had the number 2 on my mind after reading the post.
---
I will still check lol. I'll be about an hour before I'm home but I planned on getting on to do a trade anyways so I'll letcha know.
---
Really happy lots of people are getting sights but my poor Furious Explosive 10mm SMG is still stuck with the horrendous iron sights....
---
my all explosives character needs a buff
---
the only good mutation for explosives right now is egg head because it lets me shoot more missiles
---
Won't the new VATS change break gun-fu?
---
Wait. You can rename the PA Chasis??? Since when? Lol. Yeah I’m still playing catch up after being gone for three months.
---
I want to come with you psn same as here
---
oh nice i hope so but I'm sorta burned out from BRs so that I'm not looking forward tbh
---
Radiation emitter plans
---
You can only assign 15 points max to any SPECIAL stat.
---
Make enough bags to cover every single PAE bundle they made... Then they would have the exact number of canvas bags for the people who bought the PAE.
---
It's definitely not in the game. Another Bethesda OOF
---
After lvl 50 there are no more special points given. You are only given new perk cards to choose from or the ability to move a perk point. If below lvl 50 then yes you should get a perk point every 5 lvls when you open a new pack
---
So what do I do to fix this?
---
my base is hidden very far away from people no one goes their unless i show them it at the very edge of the map were no one goes also it prebuilt so no one can break it if u get what i mean
---
Hmmm. I’ll have to try and get rid of it then. Unfortunately I don’t have the plans to make all of my other current mutations, just 3 of them.
---
Wouldn’t that be more costly stability wise? Wouldn’t the console have to load more since a lot more is in view?
---
For my scavenging only character her camp is a single foundation with a stash box and a streetlight so I can find it easier at night.
---
My guess it try removing the point from perception and see if the next time you lvl up if it lets you max that card. That's very strange, I haven't heard of that happening before. Is perception maxed out for you at 15?
---
raiders are the most oppressed group in the wasteland
---
raiders rise up!
---
 Did the same thing at Grafton Steel. Guy came over and thanked me after I took my pic. We did a quick jam session and I have pics.
---
Mutation serums are pretty cheap nowadays. You can usually find them at player vendors for between 250-450 caps. I rarely see them over 500.
---
I have it.
---
:)
---
I’m sure patch 10 will be huge, this is just all they can reveal right now. E3 is happening on Sunday and we will learn everything about it then.
---
 Just what I did. Thanks for the directions. :)
---
Yeah but I have no idea how
---
Ill give you 750 for it.
---
Its like Launch week all over again
---
I used this perk for my firsts 100 levels, and i was very happy with the results, low level enemies restore your armor with 5-6 hits  and you can keep the junk for repair the weapons. in muy opinion is a good perk
---
 You get used to it. Mine gets used for jumping off cliffs mostly and for more carry to get home. The Cores last a long time used like this.
---
 Its almost a shame, my Plague Rider X0-1 set is pretty sweet.
---
How is that rear made? With that tilted floor?
---
Thanks to everyone who showed up to kick her ass in 5 min lol
---
Her voice is the worst thing I've heard in my life, the voice acting is too enthusiastic and over the top. I'm glad I never have to do those tedious quests ever again...most annoying NPC to ever be created.
---
Shit dude, I'll buy all the flux you have for 40 each. I'll even give you 50 for cobalt and crimson because I'm out right now.
---
Go to the amusement park that is North West on the map.  Equip "Can do" perk and open all the trashcans.  There are a ton of them.  You will also get a lot of coffee which is pretty useful in my opinion.
---
Is there a difference between high and low level enemies and how many hits it takes?
---
You do realise how big the game is, and that the devs just might not realise this is even a problem? I would like this fixed but the amount of stuff these people have to do.....
---
Line in the sand event rewards fusion cores... not a great option, but best I have.
---
NO YOU DON’T WE ARE IN PARTY
---
I run a 2 handed melee build and really like the lucky break perk! Anything that cuts down on ballistic fiber costs is a good move for me lol
---
Jump to a different server. You won't always find that happens and quite often you'll have a free run getting all the fusion cores you can carry
---
Make friends? It's bullcrud there's no PvE lobbies where you can share more easily. Like. Maybe I want to be an ammo trader but don't want a douche walking in and one shotting me for the ammo I'll let him take freely if asked.
---
Hop servers and try again. Or take a different plant. There are 3 on the map
---
When they modded Marcy so you could kill her, the FO4 universe celebrated and all was right in the world. I hate that bitch. Rose ain’t so bad. Kind of an evil party chick vibe with her.
---
Is there literally any point to workshops if you’re low level?
---
Interesting. I need to recheck, but I recall seeing the Hardened and Prime give the same damage so I'm still not sure they are working correctly.
---
Other than that, you could become friends with somebody high lvl who can craft them maybe. Have you tried locking the fusion core maker before you're killed? That way at least the person would have to become wanted to get to them.
---
If you listen to the audio files they have already added in, it is clearly a battle royale game mode. The audio files even talks about having to move toward the center to get out of the deadly zone that is closing in, just like every BR game out.
---
I think is the same amount of hits, not sure totally but my armor repairs itself frequently during combat so problably the level of the enemy doesnt matter, Hope i help you!
---
ah..ok I see :)
---
When you pick a stat to add a point to, you don’t have to pick a card from that stat. Add a point somewhere else then jump thru all the cards to get the card you want. 
---
If your stat is at 15 already you just need the card you want. Pick a different stat to add a point to.
---
You could say the same thing about "wrecking ball" also being useless now that CAMP damage is gone.
---
Helped a lot actually thank you very much!
---
I hate Twitter, but I would love to be an HOA member/agent on PC.
---
Let me know what's possible.
---
They won't always get stolen, and death penalty isn't very severe. If you can deal with the frustration of the people who take them and just swap servers, you can find one with good people who will let you have your workshop.
---
Actually last question, what level is your luck??
---
You're in a helluva quagmire here, pal. :) 
---
Bite the bullet, come to the dark side JUST for the HOA. We'll welcome you with open arms.
---
Lol. Dont have any at the moment.
---
Learn where power armor spawns and collect those. They aren't full, but you can get enough to get around. Eventually, there are perks you can get that stretch out the life. There's some spots where full cores spawn. Keep checking player vendors too. I have seen some priced reasonably.
---
Make them, find them. You don’t really need them though. There are other ways to play without being in power armor all the time
---
I've been getting disconnected from the server a LOT over the last couple days.
---
This happens wayyy to often. I’m tired of losing ALL my junk because the game glitches and I can’t respawn
---
Given Bethesda's general attitude towards NV in general, I'd be very surprised if we see any assets from that game make it into 76.
---
I'd love to see the .45 auto myself but I don't really expect it to happen.
---
Clearly this other dude thinks they should be given the benefit of the doubt, but that is just enabling their fuck up.
---
So you're ok with getting screwed out of something you paid for and were promised but didn't receive? Throwing a fit about not getting what was advertised to you is an appropriate response, and I don't see how it ever couldn't be.
---
It’s the plague walker - used to happen to me- I removed it and it doesn’t happen anymore. It damages all small animals, Brahmin etc
---
Nuclear Winter... Wonderland. Look it up, on holotape.
---
By the time I used the perk (im actually changing builds) It was 9, now its at 15 and activates more often
---
Ad Victorium brother. Im on Ps4 been thinking about starting a proper chapter tbh. My group of ragtags, killers and merchants need whipping into shape. Ive promoted one to Palladi, i can because im the only fucker with all the paints i know of lol, as she is frankly the most level headed (and may have showed her absolute loyalty and discretion with many many many many drugs) and a straight up killer in ove and pvp. But yeah now im writing it dow  a proper chapter seems like a slice of fried gold.
---
Onwards to victory brother
---
Shame really, New Vegas had some very fun and unique weapons...might be time to dust off the disc and run another play through.
---
I got it from the quest at the prison... Helping the patrol bot.
---
that would suck. Why should people have to pump perk cards into a stat to build a bigger camp? And it wouldn't work, because if you decided to swap perks from INT to another special it would break your camp.
---
Man i tried out my aae explosive laser rifle its pretty beast with beam splitter and automatic only thing is it breaks pretty fast it hits way harder than a aae handmade and has the burning gamma mod.
---
Ill give it a try. i sent you a link from the NCC-76A :P
---
He's there to watch over the Miss Annie nanny bot. He must ensure that she's ok.
---
This isn't about perks, this is about raw stat. There is currently little to no reason to have a high Intelligence.
---
Just got it... LOVE IT! Read my reply on DM.
---
No :/ I don’t wanna have to dump perks into stats just to build
---
Sorry, didn’t think to clarify. Basically, it’s like you’re not wearing those armor pieces at all. So not even Legendary effects apply. 
---
This is why a lot of people debate between PA and Legendary effects.
---
Who said anything about perks?
---
To be fair, the Battle Royal rumour mill was started by players
---
All BG has said is ‘an entirely different way to play’ so we’ll see what happens
---
No worries. I was confused the first time it happens to me as well.
---
Sounds like a pretty handy gun!
---
Perks / points whatever - our special stats should not be tied to building
---
I was so close the other day but I ran out of bullets!
---
Thanks. Sad, however. Lol. My Excavator still gives me a boost, however, and other than SB fights, I've been doing better with no PA.
---
I have better luck getting Luck of the Draw to perk than Lucky Break. I eventually ditched Lucky Break because I was still repairing. YMMV though, everything is a RNG here.
---
I have Never once used a workshop to make cores.  There are hundreds of locations to collect cores. (lvl 220)
---
That said ..... server hopping is part of THIS game.  It's not taboo here..... it's part of the design of the game.
---
was 15-20 i think. I used to buy them on my alt at level 17.
---
Really i want to see pistols be buffed in general they are just to weak right now
---
Why not? There already are perks for building, why not more? Or are you one of those people that think any perk that doesn't increase your damage output is wasted?
---
You can get them for free by doing the event at the penitentery as well
---
I wish I could upvote you even further, mawfk.
---
Okay that's what I thought lol. Thank you
---
Well, Fallouts original fan base has a pretty big "anti-social" sect. What I mean by that is people who'd rather indulge in thier own fantasy world without the influence of others. And as one of these people, I can say I sraight up wouldn't of played 76 if it were like survival mode, and I love Bethesda games. Slap system let's you ignore pvp crazed folks and go about your relatively peaceful way.
---
I didn’t say that at all - I just wish perks for combat and survival shouldn’t be tied to building - I don’t want to be restricted from building things because I don’t want to run a high int build when I’d rather run luck etc
---
I really respect that. 10/10 props my guy
---
It's been noted, been submitted, been acknowledged ...... 
---
Game size isn't an excuse for shoddy work .... the game isn't in BETA right now, it is in FULL release, waiting for the first DLCs that add a price tag.
---
I bet they could find a data mining fan that would love to fix it for them for free .... but they don't want modders touching their game.
---
They also fixed the bug that Calibrated Shocks provided double the bonus if you logged into the server already wearing it.
---
Thats weird a few weeks ago i accidently scrapped my frame, all the pieces went into my inventory. I guess the failsafe isnt so failsafe for everyone.
---
Kill Sentry bot,. Loot core ,..Server hop , Rinse -Repeat
---
I never said anything about needing perks to build anything. I'm talking about C.A.M.P. budget, not perks.
---
Well eff ya to then.. haha.. just gonna ignore someone after asking for help.. I'm joking I dont really care
---
From what I've seen, alot of people just block off the workshop like crazy, and if they can't reach it, they can't get to it, if they attack it before triggering the workshop it's wanted status.  More things they destroy the higher it goes up.  I've seen people go crazy with bookcases as each one adds $$
---
This thread is exactly why I don't bother with workshops. They just aren't worth the trouble. I get far more junk scavenging than trying to claim/keep a workshop, and without the forced PVP.
---
Same. I haven’t found a good one yet and it’s very difficult being a pistol build character.
---
Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
i have a 3\* exploding 30% to animals 90% lighter .45 auto combat rifle and love it very hand at SBQ as the doggys and bears show up unannounced.
---
Most of this sounds good except reticle on big guns while aiming. Kinda drains the point of an "iron sight" system, being meant to make the feeling of firing your gun more immersive. Adding a bright yellow X while aiming isn't that real feeling.
---
My question is does it repair all the armor or just 1?  It happens about the same as luck of the draw but going to different pieces is like 1/5 the amount of help.  I just use white knight at the workshop, not during play.
---
Raw stat would be the same thing though, say you put on unyielding gear, get radded up, pop some int boosting chems then build a crazy base, once you heal it breaks your camp because your budget changed.
---
Even having a good one still sucks 10mm is awful, pipe can be ok sometimes. Only real good ones are the revolvers but single action has to have reload speed or you suffer and just in general need the quad legendary effect. They also have like no armor pen which is a kick to the teeth its vats or bust.
---
Ya must got me blocked or something.. cuz I cant see ya online, add ya as a friend, nuffin
---
I'm up on the ridge below The Vantage. There's been a couple times where somebody nuked the resort directly instead of far enough west to get the golf club in the blast and my whole camp was wrecked. Once though somebody dropped a nuke where the edge of the blast went right through the middle of my camp. West half destroyed, east completely normal. I'm still sorry I didn't think to take a picture of it before I repaired everything.
---
I don't take workshops any more.  The griefers are the worst.  The easiest way is to do fusion core runs.  I just hop servers until I find one where no one has cleaned them out and I look in every place there is a fusion generator.  They are all over the map.  Google it.  There's plenty of maps that show fusion core locations.  You can craft them if you craft stable flux.  But that's the really hard way if you're low level and don't participate in killing the SBQ much.
---
I don’t know man I have only blocked like 2 people since I started playing xbox lol. Maybe you are one of them!
---
That is dumb and why would anyone even consider such a thing?
---
No
---
True. I’d love to have the plans too
---
I agree that there is so much to do right now, I never claimed there wasnt. I was trying to ask players what they usually work on when theyre bored or dont know what to do and it spiraled down into everyone giving me downvotes for not realizing what the badges were for.
---
The damage number overlay is fantastic.  Now I can truley see what 1 bullet from my TSE or executioner's weapons do as I hit the enemy.  Maybe have the numbers drop like in Borderlands?  The numbers don't overlap and it's  very easy to see the damage values.
---
nah, camp size is tied to engine and server stability. also limiting camps will kill creativity and the game does that already since we cant build giga massive mega projects
---
Interesting. Must be bugged then, bc it happens even when i don’t have any diseases
---
Worse.
---
I’m sorry but “25 minutes to go” is on Johnny ‘s best under rated songs.
---
I think the SBQ drops them still. May want to try that avenue
---
I'm on XBox. I wish this game worked on the 360, we've got two of those and my wife would play just to put me out of my misery.
---
Probably, Apex has an FOV slider with loads of detail on outdated tech and that game is strictly PVP. I could see it being fine for 76
---
I am just about to the end of the quest that lets you activate it. I don't think there's any way I could finish it, but I might as well start it and see what happens. What the hell. Thanks!
---
Dookiestorm is my name
---
I hated when they did that. I used to use the arena pads to have her and Jun fight each other with various melee weapons. They'd beat each other senseless until one of them would go down. The winner and everyone else would go back to whatever they were doing until the loser healed up enough to get back up and they'd be back at it.
---
I could give you a silver, and did.
---
Dude, i got a 3* Bloodied, 10% Damage Aiming, 250 Damage Resist Reload one from the purveyor. It's worth it??
---
1- stability increases as work on the engine continues.
---
2- the current budget is the floor. This suggestion is about a means to raise the ceiling.
---
I see what you did there.
---
Silver for unredacted documentation
---
Is that in your camp? Then try moving the cooking station, see if that helps.
---
Great pic!!!!
---
Honestly, it's not even that it doesn't fit in the Fallout universe (although it's a newer sounding song, it's still on the cusp, and it's lyrics still fit the culture), it's just that it doesn't really fit West Virginia.
---
Now Fallout: Miami. There's a good fit.
---
this sub reddit is racist against raiders
---
I dont care about downvotes or karma on this website but I do noticed alot of hate towards a person with a different playstyle. grow up biggots
---
Damn. If on PC I'd help you out. But like everyone said, start the Imposter event. People will die
---
People with marsupial wouldn’t be happy, and pretty much every high end player seems to have it
---
By that logic you could have saved even MORE money and bought a bag of the same or better quality on it's own and just attached a Fallout themed patch or decal.
---
Gotcha!
---
Pure gold
---
&gt;Happy now the 2 people who actually bought the collectors edition and were mad about the bag?  
---
  
---
Ah so I guess that giant doxxing that happened as a result of this Duffel Kerfuffel didn't actually happen?
---
*\[First off... GFC? Can't quite figure out what that means... heh\]*  
---
Personally I don't bother to sell ammo because I have enough issues with STASH space trying to sell \~25 \*\*\* Armor and \~25 \*\* and \*\*\* Weapons, as well as 50-some odd plans.
---
Consequently, that also means I don't have room for Steel or Lead, either lol  
---
I blame my love of collecting clothing, as I'm sure I have well over 10lbs worth!  
---
I also blame Bethesda not coming up with a way to make certain perks passive and in turn allow them to apply to the Stash weight.
---
As such, I give away any of the ammo types I don't use, making a daily stop at Flatwoods to dump off ammo, armor, weapons, plans and any chems/food/water I can spare.  
---
**However**, I also am more than happy to buy .45 rounds at a cap a pop. I try to keep 1000rnds on me, so if I get down to 500 I'll drop 1000 caps at a vendor just on .45 if they have it. I also used to buy 2mm EC when I found them at 1 cap, but then I upgraded my Gauss to Prime so... :\\ At least I can still buy Plasma Cores if folk sell 'em cheap enough (I'm content spending 25c/ea), since those are required in making Ultracite Plasma Cores.   
---
*(No doubt made someone super happy when I had dumped off like 13 cores that glitched and had only 3-8 shots each, since they'd convert no problem lol)*
---
That being said, I feel some folks have quite a disconnect from reality on their pricing for legendaries... People need to remember that we are limited to 25K, and that most of us aren't going to have multiple accounts or characters with caps to shell out. Nor would I accept that as a reason to justify the pricing either. This means asking 5000 for a mediocre-*at-best* \*\* or \*\*\* legendary, is bonkers (understatement).
---
Gotta price things for a normal, average player. The casual player that doesn't grind for hours a day, and that may be &gt;lvl 50 but only has 6K caps to their name. They won't have 'god tier' items, and as such won't want to drop a shitload of caps at someone's shop. *PARTICULARLY* when said item has only ho-hum effects, which for most people it only has one effect that's of any use. 
---
I recently had gotten, as a drop from a Nuked Whitespring grind, an Anti-Armor Explosive .50 cal. THAT I probably *could've* listed for 4000, but between my shop and my typical playing I'm always near the 25K limit... So, I put it up for 1900 caps. :) 
---
Point is, my "dream" weapons would be something like... A Bloodied-Two Shot-Quad Gauss or Lever-action, or an Anti-Armor-Two Shot-25% Faster Firing Gat Plasma. THOSE I wouldn't hesitate dropping 10-15K for... maybe, *maybe* even 20K, but there'd be serious hesitation for 20K unless it was the L-a. Mind you I don't know if those combinations can even exist, I hope so, but it doesn't detract from my point either way lol
---
\[/wall of text\]
---
 No they never said that. They said your system does not meet requirements. They said nothing about your processor.
---
 As we cannot see your GPU, maybe that's the problem. It looks like you have lots of goodness in what we can see, so I understand your puzzlement.
---
Ultracite actually, the power plants have a terminal stating they converted to ultracite
---
Learn the fusion generator plan, build one to power the core generator instead of restarting the plant every time. Lock the core generator and leave the workshop. 
---
Go back every 15-20 mins crouched, so you can’t be seen on the map—they’re only targeting you because you’re low level and easy. Get your cores and get out. Make sure your junk is stashed first. 
---
Eventually someone will take it from you, but you won’t be there to be killed. No big deal, server hop and repeat.
---
Beyond that, don’t live in power armor. Use it when you need it. You’ll use far fewer cores and as you get stronger you’ll use it less and less.
---
Hoarder!!!!   🤠
---
I could be wrong but from what I remember some water is more clear than others and if the water falls within the green border of your camp it’s clear. I used to be in the mire on a lake and it was always crystal clear. Even had a few skeletons at the bottom with their hands tied behind their back.
---
Yeah, they screwed you.  You're definitely a victim.  \*rolls eyes\*
---
Ye must hunt the white Wendingo now!
---
Lol k.
---
Cool paragraph, still false advertisement.
---
For someone running a bloodied rifle build it's totally worth it. If you're on xbox I'll give you a decent chunk of change for it as it'll be a lighter option than the bloodied level action I'm toting around at the moment. The damage resist is one of the best 3rd modifiers for things that take a few extra seconds to reload.
---
I'm not sure what it's worth, but could post a price check on one of the market threads and see what people say.
---
Not sure what they drink, those twistoffs are hard to open with a wing!!!     :)
---
Oops!!!!!!
---
I loved this song, heard the tale the first time in some sort of history theater dealio way back, kinda forgot about it until now but I agree immensely. I love the music fallout has introduced me too
---
Concerning Stealth...?
---
Is it possible with the 25-ish AGI you say you have you accidentally broke the cap and reversed it? (That could be a potential bug).  I have a stealth character with 11 total AGI and getting detected is very hard.
---
Yes there are many better ways to PvP not 1 shot a low level that clearly without any thinking  know you’re going to win it’s literally just for meat heads who can’t handle survival and become dicks and if the “rewards” they say are good there are many more efficient ways than that to get “rewards”. Clearly it’s an asshole move
---
GFC = Global Financial Crisis. Huge economic depression world-wide in 2007-8. US housing crash etc.
---
Diehard 🤠
---
this just means they (BETH) are up to no good. something bad is on the way. like as you enter and area of a game and there is 3 heath packs and a missile launcher, the next doorway going to be bad.
---
Oh yes - I buy treasure maps, often at 10 caps. I wait until I get 10 or so and do a treasure hunt.
---
&gt;  It's as much about what your willing to give up as what you want to get.
---
This. I am a stealth rifle build. I have maxxed both Perception (rifle) and Agility (stealth) to get as much as I can, but I've had to sacrifice a lot of other things to do it. Choosing a specialization is necessity.
---
That is a secondary effect. It does not change your raw intelligence. You still have the same number of perk slots as your raw Intelligence
---
No, unfortunately not. It’s an npc camp in the north of the map
---
Gratitude like "thank you so much, I appreciate it"? Because honestly, thank you so much! I appreciate it!
---
Or 'certain level of gratitude' as in clean off my double-sized bed and get some Day Tripper and Vodka before you come over. Work with me here, instructions unclear.
---
Don't worry, we've all been there. ;)
---
I used to have my Peepers in my hotbar, but since I don't generally need to tag stuff, I just use my 105mm Camera these days since it offers the same level of zoom.
---
So you want more of the same, just different setting? Meh.
---
&gt; that Traveling Pharmacy may be a waste of STR
---
Hmm, that's a good point. It was necessary for me initially, but now that I have the entry level backpack, it's far less important as I almost never run out of carry capacity. I might be able to use those points somewhere better like Luck. Thanks for pointing this out. I'll have to play around with it.
---
Flip a coin. We're easy. :)
---
Oh my gosh thank you!! Really not necessary but &lt;3
---
You are wrong, the processor are marked by them in the answer, that gray and red line is in the email.
---
No, got those elsewhere (workshop or sth). Stone benches are another one, and I also got the Safe plans from him, no idea if those are exclusive, but I never got them anywhere else in more than 900 hours playtime.
---
people still debate this!?!!
---
Same for me
---
I want an ACTUAL Boroughs. Not the one under Harper's Ferry.. An ACTUAL dungeon. What do you mean, "more of the same"? Making drinks and taking pictures?
---
I thought you were going to say cheep beer
---
My GPU is a GTX 1070Ti... yeah maybe you think that video card " does not meet requirements " LOLOLOL
---
Scorch beast is a bat. So i can only assume it works
---
&gt;You're definitely a victim.
---
I glad you can at least acknowledge that.
---
&gt;Their idiotic advertising department forgot to remove from the image.
---
Then why not state that well before release? 
---
&gt;You got your bag.
---
I got a bag, not the bag I was promised in an apparently faulty advert that they never properly explained as a misprint before the release of the collector's edition.
---
&gt;It was never meant to be more than a cheap add on
---
So? When I buy a product that promises a set of items, I want all the items promised as they were displayed.
---
&gt;What you were paying for was the game and the helmet.
---
And the Canvas bag.
---
This is awesome. I am not going to enter because I know my camp is an embarrassment compared to others but I will def stick around to see the final winners. Good luck everyone!
---
I honestly really hate that shit. Like it's not like people can really steal your shit, and now they can't even break it. What's the point of building and decorating something that nobody will see? Checking out player camps is one of my favorite parts of this game and nothing turns that to disappointment faster than locked doors.
---
Mine is so bare and functional. Not crib worthy but it is the wasteland!!!!’     🤠
---
 I thought you had done that.
---
I used to make Marcy pit fight death bots wearing nothing but a sack hood. 
---
Sometimes I’d make her fight her husband or Preston and give them weapons and armor.
---
 Same as mine. I dunno, they must be drunk.
---
I don't think it works that way, if the owner changes, it's their lock now.
---
I have talked to people but it’s only been a few. I kinda think it’s more that people aren’t talking.
---
Lol
---
i have a level 45 marine right arm. fall damage, rad resist, and weighs 90 percent less. any interesting trade offers? i am partial to weapons with weight reduction.
---
Dear lord.  That would be a nightmare.  
---
Kinda reminds me of the story of the family feeding raccoons every night..... then they went on vacation.  Came back to a mob of pissed off racoons who were pelting them and destroying their house becuase they weren't getting nightly goodies when they went on vacation.
---
Try to get close to your bag and drop one ammo in new bag, the old one should change in the new one, unless that’s fixed by updates.
---
So why did you contact Bethesda Support?
---
 Yeah its great for the SB but I usually use an Instigating Lever Action and the trash had to be shot more. ;) 
---
 I'll have to practice.
---
Yup lots of trash out in the wasteland and in real life too!!!
---
Sometimes when I eat or drink with my character the game freezes/crashes.
---
Yes. It’s under the inspection tab in your pip-boy
---
Twice!!!
---
I thought karma was a chameleon???!    🤠
---
These would be populated by 60+ level mole miners dropping \*\*\* legendaries.  I'm all for it!
---
By perk loadout, I don't mean you can rearrange perk points. Just the perk cards. I'm at a LVL now where I've accumulated enough cards to switch between rifleman and commando, and other perks that go along with those but it's a pain to switch all the perkcards everytime, forward and back.
---
So unfortunately Bethesda blocked an entire playstyle from the endgame events. You cannot get sneak dmg when the enemy is aggro'd, even if you are completely undetected.
---
I take people's crops all the time and haven't become wanted.
---
Literally EXACTLY what I just said... Wtf Bethesda?! You just made waste a shit ton of plastic. I couldn't be any more upset. That shit ain't easy to find. So stupid! 😡 Well, I'll have to watch out for this so I don't fuck that up again! My God. Smh. 🤦‍♂️
---
 The Western however just sings. Mine was around a 100 a shot and very accurate with the long barrel and a Reflex Sight.
---
 One shots almost all the small stuff, and was fun for me to offhand as I never use VATS. Once you start to pop stuff that pops up, just boom you are gone, you feel kind of badass.
---
But just because somebody kills you, unless it's while being contested, doesn't mean they take over your workshop. My understanding was that OP already had the workshop right? I guess other guy could have killed him and then contested it and taken it that way. But my scenario was for if it was already taken over.
---
Yeah, go ahead, I'm on Xbox 1 and need caps.
---
There are three purifiers
---
I see a lot of fully charged fusion cores in player vending machines for less than 100 caps a piece, they also show up in ammo containers (the Scrounger perk card helps with that), and on enemies that drop laser gatlings as loot.
---
If you've pacified Watoga, there is at least six spawn locations there (four of them in power armor frames, though, so only 25% charged).
---
Check camp vendors
---
I've bought dozens of 100/100 cores for under 40 caps a piece
---
I had some similar problems when I first got my computer. This was long before playing FO76 though. I fixed the freezing by disabling the CPU power saving in the BIOS.
---
No, it's one of the ways you PvP in this game. Workshops state such.
---
Yeah I get that, they wanted to provide an experience that people were used to. It's created a kind of bipolar game where you have a co op pve game (adventure) or a glorified death match (survival) I think there is a happy medium ground in there somewhere that they could have achieved if they fully embraced fallout as a multiplayer experience.
---
The pipe bolt action rifle should benefit from both perk sets too, although the pipe rifle won't.
---
It's almost certainly unintentional, so I wouldn't over-invest in a build for these weapons. Should be very strong at the moment, partly because the pistol and rifle perks are multiplicative, so a full set gives +156% damage rather than +120%.
---
weapons can be found that scale with level, yes. if it is found off an enemy it will scale off of their level
---
yes
---
This has had a fair amount of feedback so long as it continued with future ones I'd be more than happy to do it.
---
Regarding the seperation of Encryptid and LL I can see both sides, I just seperated them because they were very different types of content and I can imagine a lot of players much preferring one or the other. Lying Lowe I thought of was the more solo sorta stuff, so the quests leading up to Encryptid as well as the pin-board missing person cases, but I probably didn't make this 100% clear.
---
It's possible
---
Ahhhh shit, I have plague walker.
---
100% failing to milk Brahmin :( and I need it for an achievement too.
---
Even if you dont have diseases it still attacks nearby enemies, it just doesn't hurt them. Annoying AF when trying to sneak past something.
---
Is not on Steam. You need to go to the Bethesda website.
---
You have to get it from Bethesda. They use their own platform. 😕
---
Bethesda.net
---
It's a common issue. Bit surprised that they don't know about it, although support are probably under standing orders to fob people off with some insulting rubbish.
---
itll be on steam later, like december. currently only available on beth launcher
---
Heyo! You get it lol
---
Figure at that point 1500 (~power armor paint) seems fair
---
What you get, for playing 7600 hours, is a bad case of Vitamin D deficiency.
---
At least. Blackbird? :)
---
pretty sure the highest level a laser plan goes to is 45, but you just need to find the plan first
---
Those are few and far between. As well the only interesting ones are Rose and Biv and Biv is interacted with so little. The robots and mutants of fallout 4 felt like they had so much more personality like KL-E-0, Curie, Codsworth, the noodle vendor, Ada, Erickson, Strong, and Virgil.
---
Got to take those orally lol
---
 Weapons go to level 50 and level 45. Certainly weapons start at various levels but as far as I know they all go to one of those 2 numbers.
---
You can't craft a gun higher than your level
---
OP wouldn't be so dumb and fight back an attacker six times their level, so my understanding is they got one-shot out of the blue, and that is only possible when the workshop is contested (assuming all this takes place in Adventure mode).
---
Hmm. I had that happen too.. where I'd be the only player on the map for a couple of hours then maintenance warning starts. Doesn't make sense to block off the servers hours ahead of maintenance.....
---
Would be cool if I didn't have to go through Twitter
---
I just want her damn stringer out of my inventory
---
Wasn’t most everything moved to Miraposa before the bombs fell?
---
Junks and ammo is the only good way to earn money from vending machine. So I only sell both of them.
---
For what? Depending on what you are doing might change which gun /legendary effect is best.
---
I didn't say he was lol. And yeah that makes sense.
---
Lucky Break works a lot like Luck of the Draw: Every time your armor loses condition, there's a 0.3% chance that the condition loss is multiplied by 30/60/90 and reversed. On average it's a 9% reduction is condition loss per perk point, so White Knight is over twice as strong, but Lucky Break works for both PA and non-PA and unlocks at lower levels.
---
I'm level 52, so that's not an issue
---
A level 5 enemy will never drop a level 45 gun
---
I like to think of it as a nice way to log how many hours I have
---
Which known spawn locations are you talking about?  Also, which quests are you talking about?  I know that most events have a cooldown timer on them, so if you go to a spot where an event is supposed to occur but it doesn't start, it's likely because it's still on that cooldown and you just have to come back later on.
---
Technically, your carry weight is 380, but you have to carry around a 10 lb PA frame, so really, it's 370 either way...
---
:D lol
---
quite literally not
---
I also get what ur saying. Even something along the blizzard aproach of flagging yourself for pvp could have worked. But as a filthy casual, the current system works just fine for me.
---
If I would have known that the advertisements were false, I would have. That is my point.
---
Only justification I can see is that the person thought i5 at 3.5ghz is better than i7 at 3.4ghz. I know the support staff aren't technicians or developers, but come on, it's not arcane knowledge that clock speed on a processor isn't everything
---
Cool.  The Prydwen  in Fallout 76.
---
Can't wait for them to drop this patch and then people flood this subreddit with "So and so perk doesn't work the way it's supposed to".  I'm sure people have already noticed ones that don't work right, but with the visible numbers to PROVE it, it will come in tenfold.
---
Furious explosive automatic handmade with Commando all the way maxed out, Adrenaline, and Bloody Mess as well.
---
At that point you should get some kind of super shiny gold armor paint set, that applies to all armors. Something really obnoxious to let everyone know.
---
You are right. I am wrong. Base unmodded lvl 50 radium...37/15...berserkers when equipped w/250
---
Dr 22/15.
---
TWO WHOLE DOLLARS
---
All explosives break too easily. Two shot also makes it worse, because this game counts durability damage per hit instead of per shot or damage
---
Whu huh??
---
Hmm...I'm from Winchester, VA, but live very close to the real-life location of Raven Rock. Can I still join?
---
Did you forget to include the Burrows dungeon in the list of content? Or is it part of something else?
---
Nah mine is too sensible to be an oddity. And kinda purposely shabby lookin, so probably not any of the rest.
---
Lol. Super bright and garish. Something that says “look at me suckers, I got no life!”
---
I really think for pve its the gat.  Excellent at all things.  It's a mower, whatever gets in front of it is going to die.  It's not all that sexy but its all business all the time.  reasonable ammo consumption/crafting and hits hard.
---
my #2 pick would be handmade, for its versatility.
---
I keep having to go into my game settings and turn the chat volume up.  It doesn't seem to save that setting.
---
No wonder, it probably counted the dozen players around the queen as hits even though I'm in pacifist.
---
Silly nVidia user... Could've just as easily pressed the Print Screen key to save a screenshot to the main Fallout 76 folder :P
---
Serious-joking aside, that indeed would've been a sweet shot!  
---
My coolest encounter has to be just outside Ms Murmgh's. As we know, a Scorchbeast lurking to the East isn't an uncommon sight (or sound), so I didn't think much of it... But just as I was going in to visit our fine Purveyor, I get knocked off my feet, as a damn Sheepsquatch had shown up! We were layin the hurt down on them in the parking lot between the train station and the Bot Stop when..... the SB decides to land and provide me with such a great photo op. So I quite hastily busted out the camera and took th...is pic--- **~~fffffffuck~~**~~... I think I just accidentally deleted the picture while looking for it~~ **~~/~~** ~~cleaning out the album of "take picture of X in Y region" with shift+click then shift+del (bypass recycle bin) :( :( :(~~
---
~~Damn... I seriously liked that pic.~~  
---
[I FOUND IIIIIIT!!!!@!@!111](https://media.trillian.im/media/?m=aW1hZ2UvanBlZywxOTIwLDEwODAsAVHPLIH%2BuJpsU3HBH%2FUZhdjZZLab1BX6pGaEse3swU8%3D)
---
Would love a red dot sight for that gun. And a suppressor
---
There is no need to post stuff like this.   This is how it gets nerfed away.
---
Ya, it really does grind my gears to find my door open every time I come home when I KNOW that I closed it. Even had to lock my Nuka-Cola machine cause savages kept opening it 4 some unfathomable reason.
---
It has to be a joke.
---
However, Im sure someone will hit it on day 318.
---
After getting one, a few below, just what I'm thinking. ;)
---
I made a few designs of it.. unfortunately it just kept coming out like a loooong rectangular house. I’ll see if I can find a pic of it
---
Oh I see. Then would the camp shrink if the player moved a point away from intelligence after level 50?
---
Stop bringing logic into this
---
Yea I would absolutely love a notification. I usually map check but for those times I don’t who knows what I’ve missed out on since I only vend junk, ammo, and rare plans for ultra cheap.
---
You're not the only one. Im on ps4 and I too have given up on trying to figure it out. I went as far as submitting a ticket months ago but none of the fixes helped
---
Well I mean shit if your just giving out silver....😀
---
Same for me on ps4
---
Ya, and it's like 4 or 5 camp items to make a door, aposed to 2.
---
Isn't ultracite used to fuel nuclear power like plutonium?
---
Two shot is the best “normal” prefix for all explosive launchers (excluding bloodied because it’s insane on everything) . It’s an absolute must to get the most of them. 
---
It does double damage on them. Check out the numbers here. They always worked this was but with patch 9 the stat screen now shows the true damage values
---
http://imgur.com/a/yehf41S
---
No, it's 20 cents ;-)
---
Keep that and get the perk that Tank Killer or whatever that is for automatic guns
---
 Or it is just a simple way for players to track hours played.
---
Fun fact the mirv does the same damage no matter what level the gun is. I have a level 25 two shot mirv that would do the same as my level 45 two shot fat man if I made the 45 a MIRV 
---
So if you gave a low level fat man with decent legendary attributes, consider slapping a MIRV on if you can aim it properly
---
Because that's not the case. It never worked in FO4; there's a LOT of carryover of bad/weird mechanics from FO4
---
Probably
---
You can't please everyone aye? I'm just a bit salty I didn't get what I thought would have made an amazing game. Still love 76 though, it's an amazing game.
---
im not using the purveyor until reddit says it's safe
---
Yeah I have an instigating explosive one that sits at 334 base damage
---
The Blackwater Mine exterior has a bunch (6+).
---
RAIDER THEMED CAMPS
---
Thank you
---
I've been looking for this recipe, no luck so far.
---
Absolutely!
---
I wish I could run across people like this more the last level 100 who was helping with an event watched from afar as I was getting chased by a mirelurk queen 😂
---
Huh?
---
yes all of this. I'm hoping after E3 they get back to the weekly updates and bug fixes. I bought he game when it came out but didnt play because everything I read said it was broken. started playing in February and since then they've come a long way.  I can only imagine what it was like those first few months. a lot of complaints but man I love this game. can't put it down.
---
Yes...   'nuff said...
---
On stock speed the i7 has a turbo of 4ghz and the i5 3.9ghz. As long as the i5 issnt overclocked the i7 will be better in points.
---
Ok, I like that. It takes the sting out of it!
---
You might try unequipping and then re-equipping the armor pieces.
---
Was just going to ask if my authority was recognized there.
---
Is that cannon throughout all fallout games or just fallout 76
---
Look up Captainoob’s Stealth Commando build on YouTube.
---
I've seen them sold in whitespring, the raider vendor I think
---
Well they "Must" know more than me, the regular consumer. They are supposed to know about tech support.
---
I usually run with Gunsmith 5 and Luck of the Draw 3 and start out at 200% condition. I can fire off 150+ rounds no problem.
---
It used to be everything. All you youngsters complicated things.
---
I'll check that out. Thanks!
---
I would advise you do that! I’m more of a F3 guy, been my favorite game since I first stepped into the wasteland &amp; will always be my favorite but I actually popped NV in about 4 months ago &amp; played it with all the DLC’s &amp; damn did I have fun man. I just wish 76 was made by another studio so BSG can focus on a new Fallout. Don’t get me wrong I love 76 it’s all I play atm because of the current state of COD but I miss those massive fallout worlds I feel like I discover things all of the time with all the little side quests &amp; such. Fallout 4 didn’t feel that way to me but it’s okay, I still enjoyed it. Honestly though I doubt they could even work on a new fallout with Starfield &amp; the new Elder Scrolls game
---
Riiiiiiiiiight
---
I like using my Vampire's gatling but I'd like to have an explosive one.
---
Will do, thanks
---
If not mistaken, twisted muscles only affects VATS accuracy.  So unless your'e a Vats build, you should be fine. Just aim like any other shooter game. 
---
Anyway, that would be cool. Have an anti-mutation serum or something like that.
---
I will probably regret saying this. But, I haven't crashed at the purveyor yet. On PC lvl 164. But I have had all the rest of the problems you mentioned and more. The disappearing inventory is the worst. Lost my Enclave undrerarmor and the ability to craft it last week. No I didn't sell it. I was wearing it. Big question is why did I lose the crafting ability. You learn a plan and it's forever. So I thought. Bethesda proved me wrong.
---
No it's happening differently to that, the game thinks the armor effect is working as when you take it off your carried weight increases. 
---
You know when you join a game and it'll briefly say overencumbered then you'll hear the unemcumbering noise a second or two later as it actually calculates perks/armor weight reduction? That will happen but it fails to actually do the math properly on how encumbered you are. So instead of 469/470 it'll be 961/470 then when you take off an armor piece it will go to 1000+/460. If I equip a different weight reduce armor that I wasn't wearing on login that will reduce carried weight but it will base the reduction off the wrongly calculated starting weight. I know it's the armor failing to work as 961 is my carried weight with all weight reduce armor removed in a normally functioning game.
---
I'll try to get some screenshots + footage of this happening when I play later.
---
Is it in your camp? If so, you could store the cooking station.
---
Them sentences are tired from all that running.
---
Hasn't been working for me either, and my friend who I was playing with couldn't hear me either. We ended up just calling each other on the phone
---
White Knight + Luck Break =  Haven't repaired my armor since May
---
No one to talk to in a game oh how lonely  you must be
---
The damage of the weapon already has the second shot calculated, and it's only about 25-30% damage increase.
---
Oh and learn to use search

I don’t think SB counts. That would be zealots. Animals are mammals (like sheepsquatch) as far as I know. But the explosive effect is going to help with damage no matter what tho!
---
Wireless energy like Tesla's tower

Same except I always leave my room locked and shut. My camp has everything and it's all out in the open, my room is just a 4 foundation area. It's my area to relax, afk, go through my stash, change my appearance or get some buffs. Nothing but a bed, stash and piano. I don't understand why everyone keeps picking the lock, fast traveling to my camp places you outside of the compound never in the room. I see people get angry and even shoot at me because the door is locked, then they pick it and get wanted. YOU DON'T NEED TO GO IN MY ROOM, GET OVER IT!

NUH UH, I DID IT FIRST GIVE ME THE ATOMS! lol

Was visiting an already nuked Fissure Prime just to grind out some Flux when I noticed things sounded... different, somehow?  
---
Then I noticed how there was an [extra color present](https://media.trillian.im/media/?m=aW1hZ2UvanBlZywxOTIwLDEwODAsI2vGG26zmUb34vhYfR2RHAa%2B47x%2FhCl%2FZsFaZ%2FZFufY%3D) in [addition to](https://media.trillian.im/media/?m=aW1hZ2UvanBlZywxOTIwLDEwODAs%2BEQwf%2FmFwny%2BJ7c8ZXsvKkDMrujS7Yy14Kiw9vj971U%3D) the [usual irradiated orange glow](https://media.trillian.im/media/?m=aW1hZ2UvanBlZywxOTIwLDEwODAsx98NlvJHo2qKcZYYpJGaGwGLj7FlbsRF8nHiNkpa1KM%3D)! lol

I like the first and third best. You can just make out Watoga in the last one. *(Fun Fact: the second two should be combinable into a* [*Pano image*](https://media.trillian.im/media/?m=aW1hZ2UvanBlZywyNzY0LDEwNjYs2XlkUOqU6AVqEsq0ecASl4qL0G%2BjfJ2DEx72VD%2BhzWw%3D)*; I just quickly used Photoshop's Photomerge so something better is probably possible)*
---
i think players data mined audio files though that indicate a last man standing thing
---
I built a ton of stuff and discovered all locations then i was about a level 35. Afterwards i followed people into nuked whitesprings. Make sure to get a shot into enemies that people are killing bc if youre not hitting them they wont give xp.
---
Much obliged!
---
cool, thanks i might consider buying this
---
I’m an aggressive fusion core salesman but I would never do this. If the shop is yours, it’s yours I don’t take owned stuff.
---
I lost a tse shotgun too, forgot about that. I envy your lack of crashing though.
---
I bought high cap backpack plan for 9999 caps, modified my backpack and sold someone for same prize.
---
I've never even considered or tested that. I wonder if there really is a consistent way of even testing that.
---
Fallout 4 had some nice assets to build structures that were less square, like curved walls.  Even some prefab buildings and pieces had more interesting shapes.  I wish they would add that stuff back.  I also prefer the more thrown-together and scrappy builds over what we have in Fallout 76.
---
Same. It's a ton of fun, just super frustrating.
---
I also hated her voice with a passion. In fact, I was disappointed I never got the chance to kill her.
---
Thank you. I didn't know I needed this.
---
Makes two!
---
I’ll try that thanks
---
Find shallow water with a mostly dead guy in it; super simple.
---
Barring that, buddy up with someone willing to PVP for a few minutes. You'll find a bunch of people willing to help as it is an annoying task to accomplish.
---
Ah crap, you're right.  I was off by a zero.
---
I don't get why this person was downvoted. This is exactly the procedure you follow.
---
Done
---
Looks like reversed straight-angle roof pieces. I can't for the life of me get roof pieces to arrange like this, so I'm assuming there is some trick like using half-walls on opposite sides and building down.
---
 No it was working on her. I hunt them. Zealots is for Scorched. I have a Combat Shotgun Exploder stashed away so I kinda know how it is. 
---
 Now whether she is both may be open to debate. She does the scorching but is she scorched?  She is certainly an animal. ;)
---
I was thinking that same thing today!!! I built a hall in fallout 4 to display them in
---
People don’t appreciate being helped apparently. Or downvote because they feel dumb after finding out they’ve been stat selecting wrong for 40 levels 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Which would be the correct fallout answer in like, any other quiz.  Damn pioneer scouts being all normal and full of honesty and integrity.
---
Hhmmm that is a good point. She’s definitely scorched! But is there a difference... strange, but a good question! I’m going to find out now!!!!
---
 Yeah, I think TK works on both. I have that maxxed, my non auto is pretty good.
---
I can help if you want. I am on xbox and my handle is Nocturnaria.
---
Sounds like Xbox is having issues. Almost every post I click on about problems is from Xbox players.

Please upvote this if u want Bethesda to add the feature

FINE

Usually have to create a party chat just to communicate with the mic rarely does area work for me...
---
I just tried without even checking the list. I did all of the challenges (from memory) but didn't get the weapon on my alt character. That's when I checked and realized I couldn't :-(
---
Yeah
---
Store all of your items under the aids and junks tab.
---
There’s a pretty disturbing lore around those from a previous game. You should google it, pretty good read. :)
---
White springs free states and bos I think was there the other day
---
Might just be Poseideon, I'll check later.
---
There’s a lot to do in the forest and toxic valley before you go to far down the main quest. Good side quests include leader of the pack, which reliably drops 3 low level legendaries, and Grafton day, which is easy as long as you snipe away at the monster from cover, which Grafton has plenty of.
---
we need a apology emote
---
Done the Event At least 30 Time's now and Still Haven't Found it I'm Getting so Damn mad only Mutton meat Pies :(
---
Burrows was my favorite too!  The lore, the atmosphere, the challenge
---
&gt;they wanted to provide an experience that people were used to
---
not exactly- they wanted to create a game for the calls to "play fallout with my friends" i.e. play pve with friends not kill each other since there is a bajillion games where friends can kill each other with guns already
---
They should have separated the two out from the beginning, which would have enabled them to create a good pvp and a good co-op pve
---
Go to Big Maw with a friend... High dive into water
---
Profit
---
Good luck!
---
they should have removed the legacy weapons and made survival require new characters...
---
Iguana bits aren't iguana
---
In that case they should have made co op fallout more along the lines of the previous games. I think that would have been a much richer experience for people just wanting to play with their friends.

 Someone said its supposed to affect sighted accuracy but I cannot see any difference at all. I head shot things by choice and its no problem way past the stated range. I was picking off Ghouls with my old Suppressed Handmade at ridiculous ranges yesterday.
---
HAHAHAHA!!! Yea! That’s what I had to do!! HAHAHA!!
---
Exactly, this guy on the server I just left is running around with a TSE laser rifle fast travelling to all the train stations and events just mowing everyone down. I don't see the appeal in that, they also should have left it so only players who have kills appear on the map, so those who want to PvP can fuck each other up.
---
I just died for a guy earlier today..
---
he made a thread asking for help and I was about to jump on anyway...
---
I’d say skip camp building at early stages and focus on leveling. As you progress, you get access to more materials.
---
If you go in your pipboy and scroll over to junk, you can hit right bumper if you’re on PS4 and it will bring up a list of possible junk. You can select which ones you specifically want to look for. You’ll know it’s selected when you have a magnifying glass off to the left of it. From there, you can quickly find what’s worth picking up and what’s not. When you hover over junk in world, a magnifying glass will show up with the name of the piece of junk. So you know when you pick it up, it contains material that you’re looking for.

I wish they would have kept pvp the same as it was. Adventure is missing pvp and survival doesn’t quite seem worth doing. So both worlds are now suffering. What they should have done was make survival the same pvp as it normally was in normal mode and make adventure a tree hugger place.
---
That helps a lot actually
---
I don't trust kinguin. Just another key reseller. Thanks for your input though
---
Ah gotcha. I bought copies for my two friends off kinguin for like 12 bucks each. No issues.
---
People that insist camp budget increases with level aren't even the worst ones out there.  There's still people out there who actually insist that the COST of each camp item decreases as you level up and you have to demolish old structures to update the values and get the budget back.
---
They were originally cooked and sold by a guy named Iguana Bob. Iguana Bob’s Bits aka Iguana Bits are mostly human and other even more mysterious meats.
---
Glad it does. I wouldn’t select every little thing. Just the important stuff like adhesive, plastic, screws, gears, springs and such. Selecting steel or wood doesn’t quite make sense since almost everything has one or the other or is easily found. Same with cloth. Your next question is going to be about stash space since you’ll actually be getting things you want. When you bulk, I usually won’t carry more than 5-10 bulk of what I consider worth holding on. The rest I sell to either vendors to get my 1500 a day or player vending.

Read this. The info was data mined. Some creatures were removed from the hunter effect a few patches ago.

The only reason I really go into survival anymore is because of the 20% XP boost which i can stack with inspirational and other XP bonuses. Now I think im going to avoid it entirely
---
Man I’d love to see a few quests that unlock weapons from fallout 3/nv. Maybe cracking open an old armory or something.
---
Also they added to the creation club a model of the 10mm made to look like it did in fallout 1 and 2. It’d be cool to get that as a high level quest reward.
---
Coded switches work good for powered doors.
---
Well you have given me hope that maybe he’ll come around. I keep hoping he’ll take pity on me because I used to play daily and now barely play at all since my son quit playing on me. He sees how depressed it’s made me because it was the only thing my son and I really did together (he’s almost 15). 
---
I also play with my dad sometimes too but it seems like every time we team up, we either can’t hear each other or one of us starts crashing a lot.
---
D-Wall317 has the responder not right now.   Just got it
---
I love ,... lamp
---
Roam the area in the ash heap near abandoned mine shaft 6, you can get a half dozen or so. More if the battle bot event spawns a sentry bot while you are there
---
I gots me dem ol GHz bluoooooooes
---
Awww, he didn't have the coat for me and now the server is full.
---
Uh... It costs something similar to **what you’re offering** just to buy it from the robot
---
Goooooodluck, I see them clear for 5k easy and fast
---
I don’t blame you. It ends up not being worth the hassle. When I pvp, I prefer a challenge, not to be a dick to those who are just minding their business.
---
I’m leaving now
---
Man!!! Someone else got the coat and all I’m seeing is spacesuit. Rage!!!
---
I have crashed. It seems to change with every patch. Quests that don't complete. Being attacked by invisible enemies when you log on. At whitesprings the other day I logged in and ran into the clubhouse. Was being attacked but there was nothing there. Ran out the back and jumped on a golf cart to stop it. Then they started showing up.
---
I agree with that for sure- but Beth in their wisdom also wanted to "increase the fan base" which is why I think they melded it together-
---
this is the same reason they have moved more towards FPS and less RPG (which began with 3 if you are familiar with the original non Beth 1 &amp; 2)- it sucks because I find FPS boring, and many fans of that find RPG boring...
---
(and I find them boring since I played way too many in the 90's so I do understand the attraction)
---
This is like game 4 of “the skeletons are hugging! Todd Howard is a genius!” It’s growing old at this point

Thanks alot! He unfortunately didn't have anything for me but appreciated the chance!

Sure if the player reduced their raw Intelligence.

Leaving and coming back

Cuz the game continues to have the same obvious problems every day

Usually a few cans under the bed

Make it if you don't close door your wanted 999,999 caps

No prob!! I check regularly so if your on I’ll send a message.

It's a bit of a trick for sure but those are roof pieces.

Slanted walls will get it to go into place with a little effort.

It’s plague walker but every time you go to the responder bot his inventory refreshes. So that guy couldn’t see the couple unique apparel items he had for you. So he had 2 items for him and 2 different ones for you, if you get a friend to hold the bot you can dashboard and rejoin and his inventory will refresh every time. Sorry kind of got side tracked... lol
---
Lol, it is not.

Serums are going for 300-400 each. Easy enough to buy the few you want. That first rad shower in a few months was scary, but I feel much better now.

Thanks. I'm pleased, Lurks are melee targets and my Combat Knives have been my main for a couple of months now. 
---
 Thanks to you I won't be wasting entirely homemade 5.56 on them. ;)

Add the physical copy on amazon to your cart, but don't buy it. Keep track of it, it periodically drops below retail. Right now it's at 56, I paid $25 for my copy off amazon about two weeks ago, last week it was 35.
---
If you could wait til after Bethesda’s E3 conference I suspect it may go on sale as a promotion for their new dlc update.  Some people speculate F2P but I highly doubt that. We could see a half off deal however. With the conference being right around the corner it wouldn’t hurt to wait regardless.
---
Oh boy, another one. They're coming back. The patch 5 notes clearly say
---
&gt; Weapons: Flamers, Cryolators, plasma weapons, and laser weapons can no longer spawn with the Explosive legendary mod.
---
&gt; Dev Note: The explosive mod causes weapons to fire bullets that are . . . explosive. The weapons listed above don’t fire bullets, so we’ve temporarily removed the ability for them to spawn with that mod applied so we can make adjustments.
---
"we've *TEMPORARILY* removed the ability for them to spawn with that mod applied". Removing something then making people farm for it again a few months later would be ridiculous
---
Each location has 2 or 3 of each you don’t need to get it from camp
---
This would be great but I have a feeling that it would bug out and turn into permanent decorations.
---
I have moved my camp to solve this. Just place your water pump close to it and the bulldoser effect will remove it. Sucks but if that bag contains enough stuff...
---
😂
---
I tried knocking out multiple challenges for this week's weapon, so I started at west bend tunnel to melee some ghouls and then went up to that camp NE of the ash heap train station to kill some critters. I killed some max level scorched and got up to third place on the small server. Within barely a minute of hitting that, it was already raining TSE spray on the tents around me. I already got my weapon so I just left the server, they didn't deserve the loot or satisfaction
---
Op is probably starving from the parasites.  Pirate's life ain't all pillage and drinking... 
---
Biggest drawback of the boat build is the fast travel spawning and the sometimes instant water-borne disease.  On the plus side I learned where to get disease cure mats quickly.
---
In survival mode, while naked, low on health, with rad worms and drunk on Nukashine, during a verdant season
---
In every other game iguana is human meat, but in this game there is only a few humans in the area in the last five years so it’s just bad writing to reuse every dumb thing that has ever been in any other game, like the cryolator going from a one of a kind thing to a common drop
---
Naturally occurring? Encryptid or the arktos pharma events. The arktos event is composed largely of water, and chances are some people will be getting downed. I got the challenge done without even thinking about it on the first day there
---
Yeah, it won't let me msg you on psn either, but we'll manage with emotes for now
---
Blackwater Mine and Fort Defiance are my favourite places to just run through and collect junk. The weapons you pick up from Mole Miners at Blackwater mine can help with getting max caps from vendors and the extra meds/crafting items the ghouls drop at Fort Defiance can be super useful as well. Also tag everything you don't have to make stuff you want to do you don't miss even the smallest items.
---
Try the silos. Just hop from one to the next and raid the workout area. I get around 270 lead each time I do it.
---
These would be great. Since the AI in this game isn't that great, many fights just turn into mindless slugging matches. While I'm not opposed to it, some variety based on enemy type would be lovely. As annoying as they are, mole rats popping in and out of range before giving you bone worms at least add some spice to fights.
---
Now that we have camera's, they need to add Photoshop so you can go through the full experience of getting the kids in because clearly money just isn't enough sometimes.

I hear VTU has an impressive track &amp; field program and is always looking for new athletes.
---
I feel like enemies need to be massively overhauled and given unique properties, Why don't Deathclaws do severe bleeding damage? Why do they roar and announce themselves when you don't even see them? Why doesn't their rock throw attack stumble players so they can actually close distance instead of tickling you? Why don't behemoths rag doll players with their attacks so they can't be easily soloed? Why don't Steel plated robots do more damage to your melee weapons when you smack them with it? why don't Snally gaster acid spit do double durability damage to armor? 
---
If the enemies had certain bonuses they'd actually make you think twice before gunning them down like a joke. I.E Do I really wanna mess with this snallygaster and risk getting my armor broken? Do I really wanna punch this assaultron with my knuckles and risk breaking them?
---
I am lvl 164 and have never produced cores. No need to. Learn where they spawn and you will never be short. They're everywhere but the highest concentrations are in the Ash heap. There's 4 at the Nuka cola plant and 3 more at the rollercoaster right down the road.
---
VATS with the auto railway. Not only does it eliminate the recoil problem, but you can focus onto specific parts (such as the head) for even more damage.
---
Unfortunately not even the responder bot sells the Longcoat for 700caps, I think it's around 773. 
---
But it's not impossible to find, if you have lots of spare time, travel to Charleston Train Station, walk to the red railroad bridge in the Charleston direction. Cross it, wait a second and then walk back to the station. On the right hand side will be a random spawn. There's a low chance of the bot spawning in, but with server hopping you can find him fairly easily. I found him twice in 5 mins yesterday. 
---
Unfortunately even if you do find him, he may not have it. His inventory rotates multiple outfits :(
---
Holy shit, that's pretty impressive. This game has come a long way from the buggy mess it was.
---
Bloodied builds are always in fashion. Just take the right mutations, use nerd rage and serendipity and keep your health around 20% with rads. Vats is your friend in PvP, and just in general. Use perks that benefit/improve vats. Handmade rifles are generally your best weapon choice.
---
So I posted about this the other day and the thing I’ve figured out, for me at least, is if I join off of someone’s profile (Xbox) vs. joining from the social menu it always messes up my armor. Then when I back out and join from the social or just jump to new server it fixes!
---
I don't know if it's going to be nerfed anytime soon, but it's definitely the game's best automatic  weapon at the moment for sure
---
As stated above, don't build a camp, or focus on camp building early on. Explore, do events and finish quests. I haven't built in awhile and I've acquired about 1k of each junk type
---
I would settle for Johnny Cash in general.
---
If you have the Woodchuck perk in Luck that gives double wood, go to Helvetia.  There's a woodshed between the yellow house and the river, you can get like 250 wood real quicklike.
---
I wish I had known this sooner with the kill 20 enemies with the fat man requirement for atomics fan. I killed myself sooo many times whilst trying to take out enemies with the fat man.  For my 20th kill I bashed a rad roach with my fat man &amp; it gave me credit. That’s when I had a “son of a b****” moment.
---
No, I was with the ghoul. As I said, it was alive. It was alive in front of me, and on the event health bar thing. It was even still alive after I wandered around looting all the corpses. 
---
It could be they didn't get kill the 3* but it was less than half when I bailed on that to go escort the ghoul around, as the other friendly had gotten killed and I wanted to make sure the ghoul was ok. We had around 5 minutes when I left the 3* to escort the ghoul.
---
 I dunno man.

My lead extractor at camp xD

At least been month and a half that’s when I got back on and noticed it

I think it's just a weird bug that happens sometimes.

You do need a chem bench and acid though to make it real lead
---
When I first started back before there was even a survivor mode a way higher level approached me and demanded caps or something,  I didn't quite understand it it was my first contact outside the vault "give me (whatever) or you die" I def heard the "or you die" part.. then he started a count down 5....4....3....2....1.... smacked me a couple times with something and left me confused and dead atop a hill in the forest... I shyed away from everyone until like level twenty some.. thought everyone was a murderous robber hell bent on destruction thanks to him..

I do rather miss the almost sneaky, agile deathclaws from 3 and nv

Judge Wilson, in your eagerness to be loved, you seem to have forgotten that Pennsylvania can not second it's own motion.
---
The Pipe Revolver Rifle ALSO applies to both Rifle and Pistol kill counts for achievements/Atoms.
---
The mechanics behind PVP in this game are entirely broken to begin with. Add to that the grossly unbalanced equipment and the duping... if you didn't spend real money or get in early on in the scams, you can't compete. Bethesda doesn't have the cojones to do what's necessary to fix both this and the economy: a full wipe of items/caps.
---
Same. You must be a 'grown up.' Only kids think they deserve free reign in someone's home. Adults know better. I visit a lot of camps and I'm grateful for the workbenches. My own camp has a garage that doesn't even have a door. Most of it is open except for my afk space. There are no secrets to be had in there, just respect a man's private space.
---
Yes, false advertisement.  But it's in the vein of "My steak and baked potato dinner was supposed to come with a side of cole slaw and you gave me boiled carrots".  No one should be flipping tables over a side dish.
---
Also the eastern regional penitentiary courtyard and Charleston fire dept

I dunno if it will be back, but I'm in the same boat - I had no idea they were going to pull that outfit, and it's gone.  I'm not happy about that.
---
They are still pretty damn rare! And I agree, 6k is a fair price tbh. I got mine for 5 and felt like that was a steal!
---
What I seriously miss is the little execution animations from Fo4 when you had low health how a deathclaw would just lift you up and dig his claws into you for an insta kill
---
I’ve been consistently getting 0% on the sbq using melee (after she lands of course). I need my crits damn it!
---
Always get 0% on flying dudes, and sometimes do *no* damage on enemies OUTSIDE of vats even though the sound effect of a hit goes off. It’s been annoying for sure.
---
Battle Royale is not my thing by any stretch.  These updates absolutely indicate a PvP orientated update soon.  These terms are straight from many popular first person shooters currently out. Aim down sight, sprint out times and such.
---
Instigating + Power Attack + Luck SHOVEL
---
Executioner's + Swing Speed + Luck SHOVEL
---
Vampire's + Swing Speed + IDK Something Switchblade
---
Well I'm pretty sure it's bloodied so alot of that is gonna come from having really low health lol. But also bloody mess, iron fist I think works for unarmed melee. Those are the big ones I can think of right now.
---
Seen them underground before... guess this is how they get there.
---
REMEMBER WHEN THEY'D BODY SLAM YOU IN POWER ARMOR? The first time that happened I just turned tail and noped the hell out of there
---
Ironically, I leave mine open, and when I come home and someone's closed them I'm like "WTF?!"
---
I guess I'm the winner!  The most damage goes to me!!!
---
These updates indicate what some have already datamined,  sprint out times and aim down sight times are important for first person competitive shooters. Battle royale?
---
Really? It wasn’t in the production section!? I haven’t gone there in a week or so maybe I’ll re check. I feel like it’s been there every time I’ve ever been there.
---
Yeah, then I don't know. It probably bugged out or maybe it was the rare chance you ran out of time on the event. I'm putting my money on it bugging out though.
---
wow fkin GOLD! love it
---
My base up in Seneca rocks gets rad storms all the time. Seems like every few times I play I log into a rad storm.
---
I don’t think I’ve ever gotten a mutation plan from the SBQ. good to know though!
---
It's still illegal. The severity of it doesn't matter. I'd say it's even more justified to be upset when, using your example, they say, "Oh, well even though we gave the reviewers of our food a side dish similar to what you ordered, instead of owing up to the mistake and giving you the promised side dish, how about we give you 30 cents that you can ONLY spend with us!"   
---
Then when that's obviously not accepted because I want my delicious cole slaw, they let me fill out a form to order said cole slaw, then they royally fuck up and accidentally let everyone and anyone see my form that contains private and personal information, leading to even bigger headache when this could've been much more simple and less annoying if they just gave me my cole slaw.

Can't be a truer statement, the hostility towards raiders or "griefers" as they like to call us, even though we never "grief" is worse than anything any of us have ever done in game.
---
The childish taunting is truly sickening.
---
For maximum damage you need to be at around 20% health for bloodied effect to be at it's max.
---
As for perks and stats, it's a melee weapon so it's affected by strength. 
---
Since your'e already low health, get nerd rage from intelligence.

In order to keep health low, have lots of rads. Since you have rads, get radicool under endurance. Add strength points the more rads you have, which will add melee dmg and extra carry weight. 
---
Get Iron fist under strength
---
Get twisted muscles and talons mutations.
---
Omg whaaat?! No more iguana for me.
---
I got a tse combat shotgun out of 10 3 stars in a row. I haven’t got shit from her 2 or 3*! I’m bound to get something good soon... I hope!
---
You can build round buildings with a lot of practice and patience. Check out [this video by Jug](https://youtu.be/VpzPUmfv960) to see how.
---
Dude I am so sorry. I’ve read he can do that. It’s like he just times out. Come check out my shop and if there’s anything you want I’ll make you a sweet deal.
---
If you hate these fetch quests, wait until you try to join the Brotherhood...
---
The method got patched soon after I made the comment so I never took the time to explain. 
---
The best way I can recommend right now is to fight the queen but only kill the mobs that spawn for XP instead of killing the queen
---
I hope I finally get that belly pouch I’ve always wanted
---
I was going ti show you but, i deleted fo76 to play No Mans Soy. But i will figure out in the morning. Im sure I have a recipe.
---
I've been told that the melee problem is because Bethesda removed the little "hop" you get in vats melee due to people abusing that mechanic to jump out of bounds of the map.
---
 There was a very common method of clearing nuclear silos by using vats on a ceiling turret and the "hop" put you on the ceiling outside of the map and you could run straight to launch prep.
---
Blessed be to RNGesus
---
Why would someone pay for it? Easy to get same weapon with better perks
---
Map checking would be most efficient if sometimes, the camp symbol didn't hide the player dots. I've thought no one was at my camp but slowly moving the cursor around the camp icon revealed a few player dots hidden underneath.
---
This is true.
---
Starched genes?
---
I think Oxhorn did a video on it.  He's the shiz when it comes to Fallout lore.
---
Cause it would be a limited time weapon and if people didn't get it the week it came out it would be considered a collective item
---
Put it in your vendor for 25k, pretty sure anythig assigned to a vendor wont scrap
---
Ah yes, the under the floor nearly impossible to kill until you lure them up steps mobs.
---
Maybe for collection purposes yes
---
Ohhhh mate, no problem! I'm really happy with my space suit! Tbh I felt super bummed out for you, since you where the one who found him in the first place! I got to get off now, since I snuck out of bed when I read your post, and the misses is not amused 😅 but you seem like a nice person, we should nuke something sometime!
---
bird bones allows you to fall a little bit slower, giving you a smidgen more air time per jetpack puff, used correctly and you can hover mid air until you run out of AP
---
That is cool
---
I was searching if anyone has mentioned this because I'm not sure if Bethesda knows about this bug.
---
Same issues where pip boy shows I'm encumbered, but there is no icon showing I am. Can fast travel but cannot sprint.
---
Have to quit and join again to resolve the issue.
---
I'm also thinking this has got to do with the WWR armour and it's quite bothersome especially when you would like to join a friend or an event.
---
Has anyone notified Bethesda?
---
I picked enemies just because I figure they would have to give me other stuff with it like sheepsquatch quest line and event
---
I bought my PC version on Humble Bundle. The $79.99 Tricentennial version I ended up buying because it was on sale for $49.99. The base version was on sale for $39.99, which I should have got because you're not missing out on anything with the Tricentennial version. Humble Bundle put FO76 on sale for no special event going on. It was a 5 hour sale I caught at the right time. 
---
Hope you guys get the game at a good price. If you do, look me up: unbeatenHAVOC
---
I appreciate his work but his “voice” is kinda unbearable to me I wish he’d talk normal the way he talks drags his videos out an extra ten minutes
---
No prob man! I actually bought a hunters long coat from a player the other day for about 4K and really wanted another one to sell lol recoup my losses. About to log off myself. Yeah let’s do it. I’ve actually yet to launch a nuke so an assist would be nice.
---
What is vendor boy when was he added ???
---
That’s actually really helpful though bc I’ve never encountered the responder vendor so I was unaware he only had 2 unique items for every person, I assumed it was a shared inventory like the other vendors.
---
can buy copy's in australia for $9 aussie dollarioo's :)
---
100 points for the shooter mcgavin reference
---
I thought karma was that shit that made you extra buff and then super weak
---
Was it the veribot thing?
---
In general, the diminishing returns in this game makes it kinda not so optima
---
You built verti bots for a couple aluminum and steel then killed them for about 500-1000 xp, kill 190 of em done right takes about an hour and gets you from level 1 to level 50
---
Thanks. Well they made much bigger bugs from one "fix" and game breaking. How many people lunch nukes compared to how many people use vats in pve and PvP..
---
I don’t know why you’re still following the fallout 76 reddit if you think the game is that trash.    
---
Let people who actually enjoy the game have their fun with it.
---
mysterious savior triggers it btw
---
Early game I would tag aluminum, lead, screws, and acid so you'll pick up junk to scrap for those.  Once you're level 13, take the "scrapper" perk which will give you more scrap when you break things down.  As you play you'll start building up a ton of scrap without even realizing it, especially if you break down all the weapons you're grabbing.   By the way, I say pick up all the weapons and armor you find anyways because scrapping them unlocks mods, so you're killing two birds with one stone that way.
---
Your camp in early game doesn't need to be anything specific or fancy.  Just build yourself a small shack with all the workbenches, a bed, and a few water purifiers (once you unlock them).  Go to the Poseidon Energy Plant any time you see the "Powering up Poseidon" event pop up.  You'll unlock the generator plans by completing it, that way you can build lights and power your water purifiers easier.
---
I shouldn’t have laughed but I did, I’m sorry 😂
---
Unfortunately not, I've taken that approach already and they're still on the same server
---
Martial artist and the Armor penetration under strength also help to. 
---
You can throw in Lone Wanderer and Tenderizer under charisma
---
. I use marathoner and moving Target for agility. 
---
Also luck of the draw, and serendipity in the luck slot helps to for utility.
---
Also applies to the Stalker’s legendary effect, both at range and up close.
---
Same may, same...
---
I vote "Big Bad John" should be added as well.
---
I see fairly often at player vendors
---
Spend a peek point or two to make a card passive would be great.  No endgame build includes hacker or lock picking, because the points are wasted.  So either we gimp ourselves to unlock containers with junk in rhem/lore terminals, or we ignore them.
---
Most games show yours in a different color from everyone else's. I hope they do the same approach here
---
It’s the responder vendor bot that is a random spawn at a few locations. Sells rare outfits and the rare clock plans.
---
Move the pistol perks to perception and i would never use anything else than my BE/Bffr/AAffr 10mm again 👍
---
Given the useless garbage she puts out, I wish I'd crash when seeing her. Lucky you.
---
That’d be great I’ll probably be able to play tomorrow
---
I personally think they're just quality of life changes that most modern video games include, and that FO4 didn't, and so FO76 hasn't.
---
Yea it’s strange. So you might see clean space suit and helmet and I might see hunters long coat and long shore man! It’s crazy. But he does always have the 2 rare clock plans and they are worth buying everytime to resell in your vending machine, 500 caps a piece all day! It’s best to do it with a team mate like I said so you can farm him until he drops dead for whatever reason! Lol
---
I know I have it maxed, I also have class freak. I want to be able to heal from having a specific mutation without losing the other ones I want to keep.
---
I think the 1 point per card system would be an easier implementation, code wise.
---
I really didn't like that people were skipping the silos but honestly it only saves you a few minutes if you used the skip, it wasn't that big a deal that people were cutting silo runs down from 20 minutes to 5 minutes. It sure is game breaking that melee vats is entirely broken though.
---
I was so happy when they aligned the sights on the gatling, just to have them blocked by the drum mag. -_- Oh well, this crosshair will still help!
---
What do you mean with "aggro"? Whats that?
---
Is the longshoreman outfit rare? And i wish I had friends to play with or I would def do that lol
---
whats your PSN and regular playtime schedule
---
Technically the start was 400.  The servers were shit then, but they've been optimizing them and increasing stash as they go, so I doubt 1000+ is out of the picture.  I have only had one random disconnect in the past couple months that I remember, and it was everyone on the server, so I blame dupers more than anything.
---
No I haven’t! But I hadn’t really found anything about this yet. Should we send them an email? I’ve never done that so I’m not sure how to do it.
---
Freettersmagee and I'm on around 11pm or so
---
Mmmrmmmgrrpher
---
Yea it is. A pretty good one too! That sells for 2.5k I get 3.5-4 for hunters long coat. That bot has all the good shit!!!
---
No probs with the down votes. 
---
Meet up on Xbox ... I'll do as much as I can.😀
---
How many are you talking? I run 4, had 6. Cost me 1200 caps to reset my mutations to my chosen combo
---
Me too!
---
Ahh so I’ve just been wearing this longshoreman outfit not knowing how rare it is 😂😂
---
In only want to rid myself of one. I run 5. I just didn’t want to have to heal them all and buy new serums.
---
I found the plan in someone's vending machine today for only 50 caps! :)
---
Not only that but OP's suggestion also makes no sense and will break the game.
---
Why? Because magic caps.
---
How? Imagine OP having 100 caps. Player A list item1 for 100caps. In normal situation, at the end of transaction there will be 90 caps remaining in the system. With OP's suggestion, let's say CHAR will help save him 20 caps. This means player A will have 90 caps (assuming tax still applies). The game will end with 110 caps from this transaction , meaning there is now 10 extra caps in the this system.  Straight up cap generator. 
---
The only way to make this work is to make the CHAR bonus never exceed tax% but that would still make no sense because it still contradicts the point of caps system and it will decrease leakage.
---
Mr New Vegas?
---
Lol yea that’s my favorite one he sells at least! So i buy anything he has that’s clean for collecting and reselling. So it’s worth going to Charleston and trying to get him to spawn when your in the area.
---
STOP IT.  Pics.
---
But it is so cheap? I started buying the recipes for mine. They are easy to craft. If I plan on a long session, I'll heal all my mutations and take new serums. No negative effects from mutations at all for 2 hours. 
---
I kept my first natural roll mutation set forever. Now it is second nature to change it up for a few caps.
---
Build, not gun
---
I've tried that a bunch. I ended up moving my base and then it worked lol
---
Thanks for the shout out! Glad you got one!! He died on us while people came in. I never got the coat :( but I got two sweet skiing outfits!!!! &lt;sarcasm&gt;
---
In the lore, "iguana bits" and anything else "iguana" is supposedly human meat. But "Iguana Soup" is made with Squirrel Bits, NOT iguana bits. So either Bethesda goofed on their lore, or "Squirrel Bits" are ALSO human meat. But there are actually squirrels in 76 that drop Squirrel Bits, so this can't be true (At least in 76, at the time period in Appalachia covered by the game.). The absence of squirrels in other Fallout games leads me to believe that "Squirrel bits" may have also been code for "mystery meat, likely human" in THOSE games. But since 76 has squirrels that drop Squirrel Bits, either the Squirrels are carrying around chunks of human flesh (terrifying implications, there) or they screwed up the recipe for Iguana Soup because they added in squirrels that dropped their meat but kept the old "Squirrel is people" lore. All they need to do to correct this is change the recipe for "Iguana" soup to needing Iguana Bits and that satisfies all the lore.
---
I did it once or twice, the watching thing, only because i had to remove the items from the machines because close to caps cap :) maybe thats why we all do it? :D
---
It's a thing lol I look at it as the owner is putting more stuff in the vending machine since you probably freed up some space from buying stuff
---
Does lamp love me?
---
Just a tip for the future, you can remove listed items directly from your stash. You can even take them into your inventory. You just can't put them back up for sale unless you're at the machine
---
They're waiting to see if you buy the "vibro-bone" club.
---
Or I see it as the owner may have more stuff not listed in his vending machine
---
I got the joke, it’s a shame so many didn’t. Of course it could be self prophecy the joke would “bomb” because, you know, Corvegas can explode easily... huh? See what I did there? &lt;crickets&gt; ....You’re right... tough crowd.
---
when rolling 2 star it's guaranteed you get the first and second effect? I could swear when rolling 2 stars I often get effect 2 and 3, being the lesser effects. Hope I'm wrong but I now only roll 3 star so I'm guaranteed all 3.
---
They nerf all the funs
---
I’ve read on this forum that the anti-armor effect from perks, weapon modifiers don’t add but rather are applied sequentially. But there’s a really good post about furious weapon damage that also goes into detail about AA effects. Search for it.
---
Oh, well i did not know, thank you for the tip!
---
Will it cause the buyer problems? Like i get close to 25k so i remove all the items, will the buyer with the open shop get glitched out if he buys more?
---
Racial profiling?
---
New cult. All hail the Squatch!
---
Do you need a plan for this? You craft them from the tinkers bench . One fusion core and one violet flux as I remember.
---
I don’t even understand how that post could have been viewed any other way BUT sarcastic, tho. I just can’t come up with a scenario where that would be genuine. Oy! There really needs to be a sarcasm font.
---
I've had too many encounters where I'm one shot killed from some type of TSE. If they exist its fine, but I want a fight not a one shot kill death match. This isn't quake or some shit
---
No, just the standard "trade failed on server" message with no transfer of item or funds.
---
I should have been more clear:  Peeps have been reporting lots of disconnects and missing loot drops.  I didn’t mean to imply the loot was better at Whitespring.
---
That's what i read, i go into my tinkers bench, under ultracite and can't find anything...
---
I’m with you on that! I hate store shopping for the same reason lol
---
Permission to board captain!
---
Oh thanks for the info since I got you here do you have an extra neon sign plan I’d pay what ever
---
Aggression. I go from [Hidden] to [Danger] as soon as o use the SB and even if I'm out of the mob's L.o.S. (line of sight) they make a bee-line straight towards me.
---
GT aGraciousGod
---
Thank you! That will make it easier
---
I had my favorite weapon which took me months to find only for it to disappear when I got kicked from the server and logged back on?  WTF? Never been so frustrated in my life! Can't craft it because it was a 3 star....  enough said.....  going to bed!  Maybe my bed will disappear and I'll reboot.
---
I've had this as well, but to be fair the last player came over to give me a big thumbs up. :)
---
Could help you now if still  need it
---
How do you lock your doors?
---
Then thats a bug, sometimes I have the same problem even when I dont use stealth boys and/or I dont have nearby enemies
---
I run a build with both mabye start with sniper but they share a lot of perks
---
They are interchangeable for the most part since both rifleman and commando perks are in perception. So feasibly you can support both if you want depending on the situation.
---
Yeah that would be awesome!
---
And in fights with the SBQ yeah snipers aren't ideal lol but that doesn't mean it's useless in the end game. In fact, I do the stealth, bloodied rifleman myself and get along fine. I die alot haha but other than that I deal a shit ton of damage.
---
Finally , time to start tweaking dmg numbers 👍👍
---
Please make the Mire next!!
---
I don't watch people intentionally, but if there's someone at my camp when I'm there I always wave hello or give a ❤️ if they buy anything, whether it's 20 caps or 2000
---
Tag: eternaaphrodite
---
Wish you were on Xbox
---
scorched must have been born in a barn
---
Yes it have a lot of ammo, it makes u immortal, and also kill everything it touch (all of thid with the right perks)
---
Its my favorite weapon so far!
---
:O where is that deal at!?
---
Your world is full
---
There can't be used copies of the PC version because the key is tied to your Bethesda account.
---
If you have 29 items in your machine and you’re setting whatever you’re adding as the same price as whatever is in the machine it should work. 
---
This happens to me a lot with ammo.
---
You know the old programmer song...
---
99 little bugs in the code, 99 little bugs  
---
patch one up, mark as resolved...  
---
123 little bugs in the code!
---
I’m down. IGN roundyroundy
---
The fall Wastelanders update might introduce NPCs, or not, only time will tell.
---
My way by frank sinatra would make a damn good addition, or L.O.V.E.
---
One day 😂
---
Geez thanks for actually answering me as a normal decent human instead telling me to go die 😂. 
---
I first got reddit for F76 when it came out and stopped using it when I stopped playing. I just recently came back to it and the first thing I saw was Fallout reddit stuff so I decided to ask lol
---
Yeah, that's what I do but when my vending machine is full, I wish it would work the same
---
Actually, I think I have this plan.  But not 100% sure.  I do have a nuke grenade though.
---
Wasn’t intentional and was unaware it would have triggered responses like these. Last time I ever heard of the game it was dying
---
Nuke em from orbit, it's the only way to be sure
---
Also: "my laser gun does 5 dmg less than the dragon, it is garbage. Bethesda plzzzzz!!!"
---
Dps meter has more pros than cons. But in any games that it exists, the neurotic whining over inconsequential performance difference is amplified ten fold.
---
Love the art style, defo would look into a fallout commission if you do them.
---
Even if they do a battle royal mode we dont have to do it if you dont want but still reap the benefits of them doing something about improving the combat controls and actions. 
---
They would have to do some serious weapon balancing before I would step in a battle royal arena!!
---
Personally I really liked the voice, I felt like the enthusiasm was also just kinda part of the raider demeanor.
---
Ya know in. the coincidental of 76 hours of gameplay on fo76 I have not encountered any radstormsbut i’ve has 3 nukes get launched on a server I was on
---
If there's a single thing that I want from this entire list (that isn't a common request that is) it's the 8th Suggestion under QOL AND UI; "When viewing equipment at a workbench, show all possible mods for the item. If you can make it and have the mats, show yellow as normal. If you don't have the mats, gray it out. And if you haven't learned it, put a padlock icon on it just like unlearned camp plans."
---
I constantly hoard and pick up every weapon I find because I'm unsure as to whether or not I have all the plans for the weapon. Please make this change!
---
Lol 😂😂
---
It's always clear if you don't dive too deep.
---
If I recall correctly you'll need more than 6 GB of VRAM if you go above medium. The lighting system also kills performance in some areas at certain times of the day. However, it seems to be random. A guy with a weaker video card than mine had no problem while I was standing next to him and my frame rate was suffering.
---
Have you submitted a ticket btw?  The community reps are here often, but they dont see everything.  Just dont want this to go unnoticed, because you (and the replies) are the first I've heard of this one.
---
Its just the perfect combination of enthusiastic high pitched whiney voice + mind numbing quests, if it was one or the other it wouldn't be so bad. But both?! Woof thats a paddling.
---
It's actually better to find a workshop with a lead deposit and setup a lead extractor. If you need some extra ammo then go to the Ammo factory at the north of the map near the big Red Rocket stop. The Ammo factory will build ammo for you, you can choose what kind. It also has a lead deposit.
---
You xbox?  I got tou if so
---
I don't know whether it was a decision made to increase the fan base, I think they wanted to create an action-rpg/open world survival hybrid game because that is interesting and new concept. I have been a fallout fan since fallout 1a
---
Nice hob dude.
---
Make a small camp , put down a lead extractor on a deposit -----&gt; stay a few days -------&gt; move to an acid depot ----------&gt; farm cloth = craft ammo to start a war 👍
---
Go to the Monorail Elevator, when you spawn head the nearest pylon on the left and take the lift to the top, there's a load of lead and concrete being used to counterweight the boards laid out to get to the train (oddly the floor doesn't collapse when you collect them!).
---
Inside the train is a couple of chem boxes, and some plastic scraps, going back out by the railings is a gnome and a box of pool balls.
---
The old saying: 
---
*Silence is golden, but duct tape is silver.*
---
Savage
---
I keep forgetting to look there!
---
Wow, this is all extremely well thought out and just as you said, terrifying. I think it's the sort of thing that would make Survival into an actual survival mode instead of the obnoxious pvp slogfest that it is.
---
The nuke actually travels from where it's launched to the targeted spot. This makes me wonder, would it be possible to ride the nuke Dr. Strangelove style?
---
Funny I just made a post about bringing back Chameleon Deathclaws and overhauling enemies to make them scarier and more immersive xD Not that cloaked glowing one is immersive but that's still cool! Maybe a preview of something soon to come? :P
---
I'll have to do that, I guess I'm not used to Bethesda having a support ticket haha.
---
Sending this to people in the morning who are asleep right now
---
I'm down with all that. Gotta keep your head on a swivel in the wasteland.
---
I'm not, I managed to find one off a player vendor on the first go for only 50 caps, but thank you anyway. :)
---
I really love the idea behind the nuke. It's a mini dungeon for the entire server to participate in. I wonder when they came up with the idea of letting players launch nukes like this.
---
A sneaky PA sniper build you have my interest.  I use a sneaky vats/crit but I never use PA. So I tend to stay out of nuke zones.
---
I'm like you, I don't like being hovered over while at a vending machine, so I treat others the same way and give them space.  I  just give a wave and go about my business such as repairing equipment, etc..  
---
Usually when I'm at my CAMP I'm there to re-equip and then either head out on another adventure or to sign off for the day.
---
If, afterwards, a visitor gives a heart symbol because they like the place, then I will take them on a quick personal tour.  Most miss out on my roof deck simply because few venture to upper levels.
---
I'm guessing the intention is for players to sell their excess ammo to other players.
---
That's hilarious. They just changed the leaderboards from that because people complained about it and now you're suggesting that very same thing.
---
Yes you can repair the old way...the where is just different. At the bench, examine the item. There is an option under that view to repair normally.
---
You don't have to use repair kits. At your workbench there is an option titled "Workbench repair"
---
For food you can find the crops you need around the world. Just pick them up, get some fertilizer, and then you can plant them at your CAMP. Water can be a bit harder to find until you can build water purifiers, letting you get an endless supply of purrified water. You'll find water laying around in some places, and if you don't mind the radiation you can cook dirty water to make clean water at a campfire. The wood is easy to get, most logs on the ground will let you loot them for wood scrap.
---
Read your UI
---
You’re not required to have repair kits
---
Do I need twitter to enter this? Id rather not, but I am very serious about CAMP building and have put hundreds of hours into refining my art in this game and many hundred more in fo4 building intricate structures.
---
if vats closes on kill what about gun fu? Vats crit classess utilize this perk to take down multiple targets in quick succession???
---
Yeah it just seems like a super fun build. I have to stay out of nuke zones too, my melee character gets wrecked by rads. Although he’s awesome, I’d like to try something a little different.
---
I'll do 25 caps for each flux I get....I dont use it.  Dont have atm but I'm on ps4 as well
---
That’s an awesome idea.
---
I have a 980 ti and I've had to turn a couple settings down from ultra because certain places on the map bog down, namely WhiteSprings.
---
This is a cool idea, specially for those, who have several variations of PA.
---
Amazing Pics I really enjoyed them. You have also set a new bar for me to reach with my photos!
---
I thought it was intentional so it's easier to climb into your camp. As long as you can walk into the foundation you'll float up the side.
---
It's mostly grinding for weapons/perks or switching builds.
---
Post-50, you don't get any new SPECIAL points from levelling up.
---
There's also challenges that revolve around level 76 (Take a photo of a player at that level, level up while level 76 or above, etc), also that's not the greatest reason.
---
There's probably some funky stuff that can happen with the perfect timing, but that would be very difficult to recreate without trying to. It will probably be fine unless you remove it at the exact time somebody tries buying it
---
It's confusing. If a person dies in water where they can swim they can't be revived. However, you'll find puddles all over the place, those are where you need to revive somebody. If you see the Encryptid event pop up run on over there and just wait. People will be dying left and right and you'll easily finish the challenge because the entire area is covered in a thin layer of delicious water.
---
Just do a really basic camp, pretty much for a free Fast Travel (FT) point, bed,  crafting benches and a stash. 
---
Junk itself is everywhere, but certain types of junk are more common in certain areas, of course. Schools tend to have a lot of plastic, offices have screws and springs. Steel you get from breaking down weapons, which you should be doing a LOT because that's how you get mods. Wood you can get from junk, or just harvest from logs. As someone else mentioned, you can tag specific junk so a magnifying glass shows on the things you're specifically looking for. I've got it set to lead, plastic, screws, and ballistic fiber. 
---
There's a Lead node in the Forest, between White Powder Winter Sports and the Top of the World, which if you haven't unlocked yet is the weird red dome looking thing in the middle of the map.  It helps to keep your Camp in the forest early on so high level mobs don't attack your camp and wreck everything.  Lead comes in handy early on because of making bullets. Later there are easier ways to get lead, but you need a certain power armor for that. 
---
Wood buildings are the easiest to build and repair, even though they're also easiest to break. But wood is free literally everywhere, pretty much, so if something destroys your walls, it doesn't matter so much. People talk a lot of crap about "floating" buildings, but they're easy to build, easy to defend, and easy to move. Place a single foundation, put a staircase up, and build from there. Block the stairway off from things, and then only ranged attacks can damage your structure, and walls are CHEAP. Later on you can make an awesome base, but at the beginning I wouldn't worry about it overly much. 
---
As for your food/water worries, there's always those dogs as the Isolated Cabin, which is a short walk from Vault 76, which is a free FT point. You almost always get purified water from events, so do the Fertile Soil event when it comes up. Players with camps on water nearly always have an unlocked water purifier as well, make sure to check them.
---
Perks that come in handy for food and junk are Thru-Hiker, Butcher's Bounty, Green Thumb, Scrapper, Good With Salt. I can't recall exactly what level you can get them, but it's a good idea to keep an eye for perks that lower weight of food, and lengthen how long before they rot. Good Doggy helps make dog food more worthwhile, and dog food is nearly everywhere, so there's that, too.
---
They should add whole lot of new songs, not just one or two
---
You need to be hostile to the owner (or do they have to be hostile towards you?), so if they have their weapon holstered, you can't damage it.
---
It worked like a charm! Thanks!
---
Sniper builds do have a place in SBQ fight. Get a few hits in on the queen then find a nice high spot and just clear the mobs to keep the front line heavy hitters free to pound on the queen when she lands. 
---
Basically get your tags in then be the most useful as overwatch.
---
That's too literal
---
Sounds like you need a separate electrical shed to one side of your building.   Have your primary power come to a switch to the shed (could be just a wall).  Then tie that switch into everything that you want to switch on and off.  You could have multiple switches in the shed for different things.  A whole bank of switches for inside lights, outside lights, garage door, etc...
---
For a clean look you can use power conduits but just remember that they take up more budget space than power connectors and wires do.
---
I'm sure they made it so you can't actually be one-shot anymore.
---
It's why the meta is automatic weapons now, high damage per second, not damage per shot.
---
Lets people kill you just as quick as before, and bypasses the one-hit safety net.
---
No.
---
Ok just let me know when you have some.
---
It’s the same as in Adventure, you have to be in active PvP with the owner. The difference is that everyone is vulnerable in Survival, so if you get a hit on them or they get one on you—you can damage the camp.
---
Would love this. i currently have every set in the game, hoping for the day where i can build a room at my camp to show them off.
---
It took me to about level 100 to get my perk build perfected. And i didn't get my favorite weapon(a tse 50 cal) until i was 123.
---
Here here 🍺.
---
Balance it by making it inaccurate, projectile drop, and slow to re-load... basically what it does now, just moar damage.
---
Only needs a damage/rad buff, and a VATS nerf, then its good to go.
---
The wendigo is probably the biggest disappointment of the bunch. It barely does anything. Its scuttling sound is EXTREMELY loud and distinctive. For how fast and unpredictable its movements can be, it spends most of its time standing still and only attacks once every few seconds. The attacks are pretty weak, too. I still don't understand what its roar attack is supposed to do - it seems like it does a tiny bit of damage, but it doesn't seem to affect me or any other NPCs in the area. It's not even functionally identical to the deathclaw roar because it will do it in the middle of a battle for no reason instead of at the beginning
---
Every quest is a fetch quest if you look hard enough
---
I hate to break it to you, but wrecking ball has always been useless.
---
Find a melee weapon and get to killin. You'll find all kinds of ammo and caps on enemies. It takes a minute but we all had to go through it in the beginning.
---
What are you going to do differently??
---
No, sorry!
---
Look up wal mart near you. I found it there for 30 around 30 bucks couple weeks back. Could have waited for amazon which was around 20 but i had the day off and was ready.
---
Dont buy it used on pc.  Its just a key in the box so you never know.
---
I love her and her quest.
---
Anyone ever figure anything out. I've tried 5 times. I've went to Fort defiance, got the note, killed SB, went to vault, Terminal not powered....
---
I was always thinking in my head that she must be hot before I got up there and remembered the no humans thing. Voice is still sexy though.
---
When explosive expert and grenadier are maxed out... it’s kinda sorta OK against level 68 mobs. I’ve managed a couple squads wipes for the atomics fan challenge. 
---
Definitely not a boss-slayer, but really fun for crowd control.
---
Fun fact: You can toss nuka-grenades and shoot them mid-air for more damage. Just don’t do it when in an epic 16 player battle, otherwise your client may crash consistently like mine.
---
Have you managed it yet? If not my ID is SkullCrackaX and I'll be on in a few minutes. I just managed it myself with the help of the Impostor Sheepsquatch and half a dozen complete strangers, so I'd love to pay it forward.
---
I knocked them out in Morgantown airport.
---
Nope. I'm starting to lose faith in ever completing this quest
---
Frustrating yes, but you ended up with a great story for the pub and Reddit.  May the wasteland take pity on you next time good sir!

Where are my launch codes? I've got one last nuke I need to launch...
---
There’s pretty much no reason to restart unless you put all of your special points into a stat you know you will absolutely never use and your perks into cards you absolutely hate. You’ll have tons of perk cards and a deck every 5 lvls. The special stats are the only reason I’d consider restarting instead of waiting until lvl 50 to reassign them.
---
I don't mind this, as long as the owner isn't staring at me with their bug-eyes.
---
Seriously. You're only level 6. You shouldn't have much at that level anyway. Keep playing and quit complaining.
---
Tree?
---
I hope the changes won't go live as they're shown on that damage numbers gif from the article, we don't need any more unkillable scorched in this game xD
---
I have 5 characters. Two are near 200, one is around 100 and one is currently around 50. The other is lower, and mostly for when I play with my wife.
---
They are all different, so I can try different builds and such.
---
And none of them felt close to “done” on perks until around 100. Once you run out of SPECIAL stats, you’ll find there are tons of quality of life and swap in perks you want. You may not want them all the time, but you do want them.
---
I'd trade being completely rooted in place to skip the PA requirement. I'd even take a penalty to stagger resist. 
---
Strange enough it's not Bullet Shield that requires PA. If they buffed that and added a dash of damage avoidance (Serendipity) I'd convert to 100% PA character.
---
The people squealing about realism and trusting Bethesda will undoubtedly be the same people demanding to know why Scorchbeasts fly at all, justifying how Unyielding trousers are #legit, and accepting eyebot physics...... Pointless arguments.
---
Elder Maxson did just fine with Final Judgment in previous games, didn't blow his arms off or push himself off the boat firing it, and we still don't have a particularly good reason for why a Laser Gatling should require PA to hold.
---
But the Purveyor gives me wood armor.
---
I don't want spam P for Pinocchio 51B left legs.....
---
I'm slightly upset, its the ONLY mission I haven't completed to its entirety. Todd....come on Todd..a daily shouldn't be bugged that bad..well I'll definitely be looking out. I'm on PS4 if that makes any difference to you. Whether your Xbox or PC. Just saying the struggles here too..
---
I'm not saying they are the same DMG, sorry for the confusion, I mean they are configured the same as all the other receivers of the same type, but the Severe has a rouge edit
---
This happened to me multiple times but the items were always in my stash
---
I did all the challenges in one sitting on my low lvl alt which I’m planning to make into a one handed melee build, did all them in one sitting in a very short period of time and didn’t leave the area around vault 76 except to go to monongah power plant and stand next to the nuclear was to get mutated and claim the workshop, whole time had an extremely low survival score, it’s doable without coming up too high in the ranks so fortunately didn’t get found by anybody, guaranteed I would have been killed regardless of being below lvl 10 haha
---
i still get 640 pounds on my excavator on PC are you on console?
---
Raider questline spoilers abound! I'll try to spoiler tag it but spoiler tagging is the stupidest thing in reddit.
---
[Rose the robot was actually based off of Rosalyn, the raider who led some raids against the Responders in charleston, eventually she was captured, which lead to the christmas flood, as retribution for taking the raider leader's flame. They later made Rose, with a similar personality and reconstructed voice. You can actually find a holotape around the top floor of the top of the world with a recording of Rosalyn while she was still human, performing acts of adultery.](/sp)
---
I'm the same way. I try to help out customers and give them room.
---
I wait until the end of the business day or my gameplay to drop stuff inside.
---
it's an uncommon occurrence. i can hide from scorchbeasts if i don't actively engage them. but sometimes it just gets thrown out the window. someone mentioned network registration and some creature bugs. chances are it'll resolve itself with a stability upgrade
---
Happy for ya!  Just trying to do my part
---
I'm a Sheepsquatch mascot outfit so they can't profile me easily.
---
Now, if only they could make energy weapons viable.
---
I get that at times. Some players even comment my place and explore it. Hell tonight I had about 10 players in it at the same time. Like they made it like their own hub for the time being. Even sat in the chairs near the vending machines and chatted with each other.
---
Like most ultracite ammunition (combat rifle is bugged, IIRC), it unlocks when you learn the prime receiver/capacitor plan for that weapon. 
---
Note that the Ultracite Gatling Laser uses normal fusion cores, unless you prime it.
---
That's quite the impeckable pun.
---
Good point
---
Some perks don't unlock until ~50, so it will take a while to perfect your build. The loot is also incredibly RNG dependent, I'm at level 221 and still don't have anything decent for a bunch of weapons. Other than that, I personally just play for fun. I stopped caring about levels (other than for the level up daily challenge) ages ago
---
OR you place them down and they vanish into oblivion like items actually do sometimes.
---
It's so weird and it's creepy.
---
I'm watching you browse. You might want to buy that. That item is good.
---
Sure- I have one on PS...oh...700 caps.  Good luck
---
Recent reports suggest that to get the loot, you need to deal some chunk of her HP, maybe 1 or 2%. If you're in a good team with a lot of bloodied players, you may need to ignore the adds and concentrate on spamming shots into the SBQ's face.
---
So if i recently acquired a furious prime gatling laser, only way to craft the fusion cores is to get the prime receiver/capacitor plan from sbq correct?
---
I'm in the same position except on the other end.
---
I always feel super awkward when people are buying stuff in my camp because I don't want to look like I'm staring.
---
I usually either start using a crafting table or just straight out leave when one shows up.
---
With 5 characters, you must have started over from the vault at least 5 times. When a character seems "done" at say level 130, and you want to try another build, do you have to start over?
---
Yes I probably have a good chance.
---
Makes sense. 
---
My game crashed at the beginning of the event and I was lucky enough to reconnect to another server about to nuke prime, waited for the nuke and walked in to find a scorchbeast queen corpse already dead and about three minutes later there were two 😂 most expensive and time consuming tiny stack of ammo I've ever gotten in this game.
---
Melee
---
Have to do it with good gun because of Assaulttrons. Sneak have been super broken lately tho so we will see.
---
Nope thanks, loading buildings takes long enough
---
Because Luck of the Draw also triggers on condition loss, rather than hits, you could get some friends to stand there while you spammed 40mm rounds at them, and see if it procs. Might need a lot of 40mm though, as it's a 0.3% chance.
---
These are terms from first person shooters, yes. They are not exclusive to battle royales. There’s no way you can look at these combat QoL improvements and draw the conclusion that they are reshaping the game for a battle royale mode.

Theres 7 different vendor factions in the game, and they all sell different sets of plans. Not sure who sells the laser weapon plans, but I know I've seen them. Also seen plenty of level 50 weapons, from gamma's to plasmas to lasers. You'll have plenty of options at 50 and up.
---
Yes. Either prime gatling laser plan should work, so that does at least double your chances.
---
If you're on PC I think I have a prime gatling laser plan for sale.
---
Melee and sneak
---
I would like to write something about every new content, not just one i choose.
---
I would like Project paradise event, if Alpha wasn't just stupid oneshoting bulletsponge. Same goes for Imposter sheepsquatch in uncrypted. Those two are only true engame bosses (next to scorchbeast queen), but you won't see people do it much, because it isn't balanced well. 
---
Nukashine was good content.
---
Ever upwards was good, new things to do, when you have completed everything else, with great reward of backpack.
---
Fastnach was one of the best things that happened to FO76. If there was also hardcore mode (50+lvl) for parade event, it would be awesome.
---
Legendary vendor is good, but 150daily scrips are kinda anoying  from the perspective of level 200+, now I don't feel like droping legendaries, this result in me being overstocked by legendaries I can't scrap, if i play more than hour daily.
---
Camera was good idea, but terrible done. Spending days server hoping, to find the corpse and start quest. Also daily and weekly challenges .....
---
Survival is great, after bethesda adjusted things you drop on death and balanced assasin/sentinel armor. People still cry, that PvP is unbalanced, but survival is not only PvP, the biggest part of people playing there, are level grinders (+20% XP bonus), so you may meet guys who won't attack you and if you keep dying from mobs to be under 3rd in scoreboard, you are theoreticaly safe. Survival is just a harder adventure. PvP will be coming now in nuclear winter.
---
I love bethesda for giving us new content, I am happy about what they introduced, but if you ask me how to rate wild appalachia "DLC", i will still tell 5/10.
---
That's ace, I love that!
---
sounds good and fun, but know the PA is loud it will be interesting how it will play out
---
If felt good to have that many people come and visit.
---
Doesn't work. You don't have to interact with the workshop to contest it. You just have to be inside the perimeter.
---
Lol I deleted my comment because I was terribly wrong. It was a pulse grenade - _-
---
Don't you fucking dare touching our sweet leader, or i will feed my friend deathclaw with you!
---
that would be cool, maybe some trashed looking walls and walkways all over the place. Having to snap everything together at a 90 degree angle sucks.
---
I mean it's the best thing to do for them. Giving them space makes them feel good. I don't like being in the way.
---
Yeah thats the issue, im away from my PC until the 29th
---
i might have a few in my vendors, GT is the same as here.
---
Chameleon Deathclaws would actually be nice if they didn't make the world know that they were there to get you with their roar. 
---
After reading your post earlier for the monster updates I was surprised to even see that this was a thing. I'm guessing this might of been a glitched Mirelurker king, or something went wrong with the coding for generating this monster?
---
I hope the stuff you talked about gets implemented because I really agreed with a lot of the suggestions you made!
---
No, just... no....  to both....
---
Lead extractors, steel extractors, and the ammo factory do not hold a candle to lead and steel farming.  The only workshop that I use now is Hemlock Holes Maintenance for Acid.   There are some animals that you can farm for Acid but it's easier to claim that workshop and farm the rest of the stuff you need.
---
I recently made 10K .50 cal rounds, 5K 5.56 rounds, and 3K Shotgun rounds.   
---
It wasn't fun nor pretty but if there is one thing that I learned is that the Extractors suck for output for the amount of effort.  I had the Ammo factory (1x Lead, 1x Junk, plus ammo), Grafton Steel Yard (4x Steel, 1x Lead), Thunder Mountain (1x Steel, 1x Fusion core), Tyler County Fairgrounds (1x Steel, 1x Junk), and Hemlock Holes Maintenance (3x Acid).
---
I gathered 10x the materials (Lead and Steel) from the locations below than could be produced by all of these workshops combined in the same amount of time.  Yes, I also got a ton of plans as rewards but you also lose out on a lot of time on defend events, when the enemies kill your extractors, etc.
---
So, if the goal is to make a lot of ammo quickly and with the least amount of time, you are actually better off farming for lead and steel than relying on extractors.  If you also want plans and XP, only then is it worth it...  
---
Personally, I'd rather farm a ton all at once and then just enjoy the game, not having to worry about ammo for a long stretch.  But each person has a different style of play....
---
Lead:
---
* Lucky Hole Mine with Excavator Armor (this yields the most lead in one run)
---
* Charleston Fire Dept  (usually picked clean)
---
* Green Country Lodge  (usually picked clean)
---
* Eastern Regional Penitentiary  (sometimes picked clean)
---
* Hornwritght Estate, if you have completed the quest and have the keycard  (very few use this site)
---
* Alpha, Bravo, Charlie Nuke Silos  (usually untouched unless someone is on a Nuke run)
---
Steel
---
* Top of the World area
---
* Uranium Fever
---
*  Gather up all of the weapons that drop.  Use the Scrapper perk.  Mole Miners give the most metal because they carry two weapons.
---
Plastic
---
* Watoga High School
---
* Morgantown High School
---
Acid
---
* Hemlock Holes Maintenance
---
*  Yao Guai (Dolly Sodds Wilderness, a couple of dead ones by Thunder Mountain)
---
Cloth
---
* Money
---
* Teddy Bears
---
* Cups around Tyler Country Fairgrounds and Wavy Willard's Water Park)
---
I don't like being in the way either but I always wonder if I don't look odd running away from my own camp after someone shows up.
---
If you have 4 machines and lots of stuff that can't fit in there, it's a good idea to top up as soon as there's space. That's what I do unless I'm near max caps.
---
mark for search the mats you need or what you use the most.
---
I had a hard time choosing between faschnaut, ever upwards, and player vending. I ended up picking ever upwards because it added a lot to do.
---
Hey don’t worry dude. It took me like two days before I realized the badges were in the challenges from the menu. I was totally lost and just wanted a darn backpack. I finally got one but I have a long way to go to mod it out at al.
---
whats your ign?
---
also not letting people buy out all your stuff maxing your caps and then proceeding to spend 5 more k giving you nothing leaving you with nothing
---
That's what I do but I never got max caps. I had close to 20,000 caps and that was back then for plan: neon lights and lettering

New legendary weapon drop: Fly Swatter
---
I still really wish I could use shift for hold breath instead of alt.
---
I'm terrible at that
---
Long range weapon is pretty important for a build like this as PA is going to negate your sneak bonus a lot as it is noisy and easy to detect.   If you haven't really played a sniper build you should be looking for an Instigating weapon.   Forgot the name but take the perk for long range shots too.
---
If you're really playing ranged and don't care too much about the PA, I've found I can bring my sniper into nuke zones with an environmental suit and just be careful in picking off mobs.
---
The combat should be better regardless of the motivation behind the update.  That means better PvE as well as better PvP...
---
Same as here, jaj22.
---
My character is so ugly he'll break em so I dont think that's the best idea
---
Do many players do any roleplay in this game? My early impression (level 10) is no. I've been thinking I can roleplay better myself if my character doesn't interact much with other PCs.
---
You will get the hang of it.
---
Beautiful artwork. Nicely done!!!

Shotgun shells sell constantly. I’m working on stocking fusion cells now, they seem to be on demand.

50% of my game is getting 5.56 and .45, and 50% is using it.

They may be showing up so you can examine any legendary items they have too.   Unless they fixed that bug.

Yeah, probably so

---
Fallout 4 is for you my friend 👍
---
A few QoL and rest dmg , why kill things slower than you could ? Farm more ammo when you could be gear farming instead
---
Lead extractors better for lead. While they are making lead you can go farm something else and come back to  your lead. It would be ridiculous to spend all day farming a single thing when you can farm multiple things at the same time.
---
You can build near resource spots as well. For example on the west coast there is a few junk piles that you can build a resource extractor on. Its like owning a workshop with out it ever being contested!
---
I have a nice little river side shack with one amd as long as its powerd you collecting random bits of junk. Was a life saver as i rebuild and play with weapon mods like crazy so screws were impossible to keep up with. Slap a lock to deture ppl from stealing and your good to go☺

Find a group to farm with. Make sure to use inspirational as well as boosting bobbleheads and drugs. Even if you don't normally run bloody get a cheap unyielding set and do it for the higher intelligence which translates into more XP. My clan is going to grind Arktos Pharma this Friday from 6pm until midnight eastern. Message me if you want to hop in our discord. We ate an over 18 mature group so no crazy screamers.

Bloodied deathclaw gauntlets are that powerful lol. I have a 1* bloodied deathclaw gauntlet that, if I'm sneaking, hits for just over 1700 and that's without crits. When I'm not sneaking it hits for just under 700

Love it all just feel bad for the new players trying to explore I think they just need an entire new game mode like survival but for people over 50 if you mentioned this my b didn’t have time to read it all
---
And that's without iron fist maxed.
---
Truly inspiring. Great job. :)
---
I don’t think they’re tradeable, they’re super easy to make just check quest items under tinker workbench
---
But don't you need a broken one to make it?
---
I'd Love to do this. On Fallout 4 i had like 50 sets all in a line. It looked SICK! love to do this.
---
Bethesda put out an official poll asking what people want the leaderboard to be based on before the last change.... The majority replied with keep it at kills.
---
You guys play on all platforms? I'm a console peasant.
---
I gotta say, there have been more positive encounters lately and less negative ones (for me at least) but this is a great example of how the game should be :)
---
Not sure but you might be right about that. Either way, you only need 15 of them at one point in the nuke zone. When you have to break the final mainframe terminal, it will give you 15 broken mainframe cores I believe. You can either find already built ones scattered around in the room or go to the tinkers workshop connected to the room.
---
Yeah but I suck at combat and will likely die trying to find them or fix them
---
Yes deathclaw gauntlets are great, easy to repair too due to the components so it makes it a great primary melee weapon. The Unstoppable monster is essentially a bloodied 3* at level 50. So if your running a bloodied / radicool build with it then it definitely holds up to its name. Also it's very very easy to get, even if your not a survival player. I played in adventure, found a bottle of beer, 2 meat and made sure I was starving. I hoped into survival and fast travelled to vault 76. Walked north to the fairground. Grabbed the workshop on route, drank my beer, cooked some food, ate my raw meat, killed a scorch with my axe and a fox and then jumped back into adventure mode. 15 minutes for a guaranteed 3* bloodied deathclaw which is now in my vendor for sale.
---
I got it up to 1650 with my health at 20% with nerd rage maxed and adrenal reaction
---
I have a 3 star Gauntlet with extra claw.  Think its a bloodied one but dont play the bloodied build.  Mine does around 300 damage.  Bloodied build is ridiculously overpowered if i see the stats others get
---
Final render better not know about this because he will definitely win.
---
If you can’t fight your way to the mainframe core area, then don’t even worry about crafting them. Otherwise take a buddy or something. The only time you ever need a mainframe core is for one specific terminal in the nuke silo so if you can’t make it there you don’t need to worry about them. What platform do you play on?

I really hope your'e checking your camp for buyers prior to hopping servers or logging off.

I found a two shot handmade last night I can sell if you're on PC. Yes I meant drum instead if barrel.
---
I saved up 200 scrip so I could buy two 3 star ranged weapons back to back. I got a Gamma Gun with limb damage, bash and damage to scorched. The second was a Gamma Gun with limb damage, ignores 50% armor and 10% damage to players. If the rolls are truly random, I must have hit some kind of awful jackpot . . .
---
What I'm hearing is that Appalachian squirrels are actually mutated humans. That's not good.
---
lol I am a little over level 100 and i recieved a message from a player at my camp who was shopping..."your base is getting wrecked.... I'm doing what I can but it's mostly destroyed" i was half through uranium fever so messages him ok thanks and I finished the event, I had assumed "mostly wrecked" was an exageration. when I went back to my camp 7 min later, I was shocked to see that my base was almost gone.... there were 3 scorched beast attacking, and the little level 30 guy was fighting for his life to defend my base... lol we polished the beasts off and I rewarded him with a weapon from my vending machine
---
If your still playing the game would you be able to hook me up with the helmet also

Get scrounger in the luck special. It'll give you a chance to find more ammo in containers, remember to ise the button prompt to do so. You only need level one. (I also suggest pharma farmer and butcher's bounty. Can do and woodchucker not so much)
---
Use the hunting rifle. It's ammo is plentiful in the forest region. It's slow fire rate will break you of the spray and party mentality and make you chose your shots better. I personally don't use vats. Until you build up vats related cards it's too inaccurate.

Stay in the forest region when possible. Until you're leveled up don't jump in after those high level enemies. If you want a taste of that it want to level up quicker to to WhiteSprings. High level player traffic spawn in high level ghouls for good xp. There's also some good spots where they can't get you.
---
Agreed. The over repaired extra damage was the only way that buzzblades and rippers were viable. Now there's absolutely no point in using them. It was a fair trade off as well, because you couldnt use them for that long until the bonus damage wore off.
---
Ah shit that’s the one platform I don’t have it on :P are you level 50 yet? Silos are challenging sometimes or just a face roll. I have two level 50 characters, one a power armor heavy gunner and the other a stealth rifleman and it’s a bit harder without power armor but it’s never been impossible for me to solo. Otherwise see if you can find anyone on here on Xbox to run through it with you, or get to level 50 and get some decent power armor
---
never thought about that. thanks!. will change my location to whitesprings. it works anywhere
---
omg bless that level 30 guy, he was probably so scared lmao
---
i know what bug you are talking about but there are a few similar ones.theres even one where after a while things like your turrets dissapear and if your lucky enough to have placed it on top of a structure you can delete that scructure to get the item back.
---
I'm level 78 and I have two full sets of ultracite pa and I have a tse lever action
---
I was so happy to finish that questline all those levels ago and not have to listen to her anymore. And F you for even reminding me of it.
---
People suck and I don't want to be anyone friend.
---
I'm currently working on my strip club. Slowly getting it together.
---
You should be fine then. There’s no OP boss besides the occasional assaultron. Just look for every level 3 terminal and hack it to disable turrets, take it slow, being ammo &amp; stimpacks and you should be good to go. Seriously make sure you disable the turrets it makes a hell of a difference
---
I assumed it's flippers buying up all my serums for 300 caps each. Fine by me. I don't play long each day so I wouldn't shift them fast enough otherwise.
---
I think you'll struggle to sell a Vampire +25FFR for 12k, but I have a bunch of moderately useful 2-star weapons for 2k each on PC if anyone wants to flip those too :P
---
Hey while I have you do you know how much I could sell a tse the dragon? I have one but I don't have ammo for it cause it's kinda hard to get and it's of no use to me
---
*Whoops, better put on my newsman fedora here.*
---
PC only for us. However, this forum is a great way to find other people. It really becomes easier to level with a good group. For one is sharing three stars. When one if us finds one we all swarm it and get a little hit. We can get ten legendaries easy out of one. Then we see if other people need what we got. It makes a huge difference.
---
Yeah I don’t care too much about the PA, I actually want to do exactly what you said. Head into those zones and pick mobs off from a distance.
---
Bethesda, could you just play the game for me? That would be great, thanks.
---
It’s nice and all but seems kinda boring. Hopefully they release new content soon because I have been spoiled. Here’s hoping the vaults open one by one.
---
You can just craft the ammo. You'll only get a few shots out of a TSE Dragon before it breaks, but it might be handy against those level 46 Assaultrons.
---
Yeah, I know it’s counteracting the sneaky aspect, but it will be fun to try out. I plan on being a distance away from things, so it shouldn’t be too bad
---
Well why can't it function like how it did in fallout 4? Since Bethesda said they are bring display cases for weapons then probably eventually we'll have PA Displays.  I mean it would be nice.
---
Also, thanks for the tips on Weapons. Appreciate it
---
There was one day where I served hopped for hours trying to get him to spawn and it never happened. Sooo frustrating
---
So I was just looking at your "Common Flora" map, looking for Mutfruit, and it has it in the legend as pink, but there are no pink pips on the map?
---
I remember in Fallout 4 I would have all these nice decorations and mini models of things, and food on plates and pretty Nuka Cola collectables. Then slowly but surely they all disappeared, only for me to find the treasure trove under my house lol.
---
It reminds me of all the times I clean under the couch and find the dozens and dozens of cat toys.
---
“Have to” or “get to”?
---
I find I’ve skipped / missed and and some are just different entirely.
---
The third (right around 100) I intentionally saved caps and hopped around to get raider PA at 15. That was very different. The fourth (one I’m doing now) I avoided the main quest until higher levels and really explored the regions. I’m also going absolutely no PA.
---
So .. had to start over ... sure. But it’s fun.
---
I still tweak the 180s as well. I mean, you have an idea but you don’t find your right gear ... but maybe you find something cool (or 3) and pivot to that.
---
Don't discount the Fixer. It is really good in stealth. If you combine it with a shrouded wood set you can sneak faster than most players can walk.
---
It doesn't work, it still says full even when you make it the same price.
---
Sure they can. You're a Sheepsquatch mascot outfit wearer and therefore doubly suspect.
---
This happened to me just now. 20 min to get to the chiefs and spent 30 min stuck at 3/5. All 5 were at their stations and the game would not advance. I had to replace the two along the way but game stayed at 3/5. I went in and out, up and down the stairs leading to the final room multiple times and nothing. Finally I was disconnected from server...SMH...
---
They had a pet rad toad?
---
How many entries are we allowed to do. I have a very unique bar and also unique camp idea build. And just wondering when it needs to be in by?
---
he was just goin at it!!! lol I got to give him props he had heart!! lol I didn't even know he was struggling I assumed he left after he messaged me
---
F76 wiki is terrible and inacurate.
---
For 6 months they listed "sprinter" legendaries from Fallout 4 as a potential affix for 76 legendaries.
---
It's just copy-pasted garbage most of the time
---
That was amazing input to this thread! Thank YOU!
---
No. I'll sell you kitchen knives for 10k and there's nothing you can do to stop it.
---
They are alarm clocks. They were free in the Atomic Shop about two months or so back.
---
My char is closing up to 180, he's a Jack of all trades, where some people stick and master a particular playstyle and build I can swap and change mine now to suit whatever playstyle I want at that time 
---
I can swap all 3* rifleman to commando, 3* heavy gunner to slugger, shotgun, iron fist and insisor 
---
Going well past lvl 60 allows me to max out alot of perks to swap and change at will in all s.p.e.c.i.a.l
---
Shaped like a semi circle? Green grey? Yep, Sounds like the atomic alarm clock.
---
Your right they are alarm clocks but they were a limited time free item from the atomic shop
---

Are dupers gone ? I have a hard time believing that given the amount of identical God Tier items everyone and their grandmother seems to have theses days.
---
Oh yeah I'm in tears right now dude, having a mental breakdown over some lazy cunt on the internet.
---
I'm pretty sure rose can talk to multiple people at once, did that for me and my friend on different quests. I'm sure the devs could replicate that with other npcs so they're less like vendors as your imagining now.
---
I've been on a few trading discord and lots of people lost the explosive effect. Hope your shotgun is safe man.
---
Well thank you everyone I will now sit in sadness
---
One of the best weapons in the game, within the best weapon category in the game, with god-tier legendary effects. Because they went for power attack damage, this can be one of the highest single-hit damage values possible.
---
That makes sense. An instigating Deathclaw gauntlet is crazy good with a stealth build, obviously it'd be better than a tee assault rifle, which isn't the best rifle either, if you didn't have a build around it.
---
Ok buddy keep asking for your metal fences and complain about how they're overpriced when the launch.
---
Still not fixed :/
---
Nah, roleplay is at a minimum here. Either people go off by themselves to RP some character, or they form discord etc groups to all be raiders or BoS members or something
---
Hmmm, I have rank 1 so I don't notice it much, but I will research it more to see if this is true. I don't really pay attention to condition anyway.
---
20 hours since you last did one.
---
I'm ok with this but as somebody who built their camp and maxed out early on, the other day I checked my budget and it was like half of what it always has been and the only thing that's changed was I've leveled up 50 levels.
---
So I don't know why this has happened but I bet people attribute it to leveling as that's what is the first thing I thought of as the reason for. I mean I could probably build my camp sevenfold in size than what it was.
---
Most higher up traders on Market 76 will get you that deal, check there.
---
Also remember : Your CAMP-Budget is depending on your Level.  Thats my personal reason to keep leveling
---
This is hilarious! I have a separate 2 by 1 shed outside my house for my generators and I locked it and I get so many people trying to get a peek in through the shutters so I put up posters on the inside just to mess with them
---
I didn't mention dads, the scorched were a biproduct of the bomb, and thus represent the struggles of a post apocalyptic life.
---
Yeah, but since a large part of the player base constantly complain that the game is too damn easy they either can fix things like this, or do a big overhaul making every single enemy harder. Same end result. One takes some bug fixes. The other need a lot more manpower,
---
Actual ingenious post. I just lurk around this sub.
---
Yep, I'm honestly surprised.
---
I am really surprised how few people use mics.
---
yes, near big tree
---
I'm slow and old but...If you don't want to PvP then stay in adventure and off the PvP servers? Just a thought...
---
I was going to but the wastland happens.
---
I won't be surprised if Bethesda nerfs it. I would prefer they boost everything else instead
---
Italian- oh fuck, I mean italic. Probably works, but it doesn't look too good if you want it to be /s.
---
These are all fantastic ideas that would vastly improve the fo76 experience. Good job!
---
...and a ceiling mounted he? Naught, naughty boy...
---
I personally wish he'd respect the LGBT community but that's obviously not gonna happen :)
---
Why? Priorities.
---
I’ll second that.
---
Make sure you sleep to get an xp buff. The top of the Forrest is a farm with lots of cranberries find cranberry cobbler recipe and make lots of them this will also give a xp buff. Combine that with sleeping you get +10 xp. Make sure you cook up all meat and scrap anything you dont need. Dont stash weapons that are levels above you l. You will get better wepons when you reach that level. Grind the Forrest event for more xp ammo and aid.  I found the buffs from legendary armour even if its level 5 out weigh the stats for higher level armour. I still use a level 10 hunting rifle as my sniper because of the instigating buff. Keep playing dying doesn't really matter unless you are carrying lots of scrap..
---
Some people aren't immersed by using their own voice. 
---
Talk to Bethesda so we can get text chat implemented, until then I'll stick to emotes.
---
Thanks for your response, i will keep swapping cards and points see what works best. Just wanted some ideas on where i can go and know if at least the base is good. 
---
It\`s interesting point to swap cards based on event/fight. Haven\`t thought of that. Right know i swappen r3 glow sight for r2 and swapped CF back in. And i found a new toy :) Bloodied Handmade \*\* with 25% firerate. Never thought this would make a big differance. now all i need is a bloodied lever action.
---
I kept hearing that it was buggy and didn’t mess with it. Lol. Totally going to do this now.
---
The perks multiply with legendary effects, so its a must have for any AA weapon.
---
They try to stare you into trade.
---
*stares in shop keeper*
---
Does it drop at lv 50 even if you're under?
---
Its survival, if your build isn't in top shape and you don't have top notch gear, don't whine buddy :)
---
Not sure how to do it but here's tagging some relevant people:
---
u/BethesdaReplied
---
u/Ladydevann
---
in another thread about this topic someone suggested to implement camp items that look excactly like the ingame power armor when left. so if you buy a paint you automatically get that camp item for all the different pa versions.
---
i.e. i buy blackbird paint and will be able to place all the different pa as a camp item. maybe only one paint per time or something like that.
---
Lol has anyone bothered with the pipe rifle?
---
There are people on this sub that hang out all day and downvote literally everything because they are mad this game isn't Fallout 5.
---
But on to your question.. I personally prefer auto rifles to everything but unarmed melee. I think a sniper build is viable for PVE but I would never PVP with it. Auto rifles are good for both, so it's the best option in my opinion. Get the gun fu perk in agility and you will be laying down the mobs in no time. The only thing that sucks is trying to fight the queen with autos because the ammo consumption. For queen fights, I usually shoot her wings in the air to cripple them, but use minimal ammo/shooting. When she lands, I use either an anti armor or bloodied buzzblade. It honestly does good damage against her. I hope this helps!
---
Just craft them, its like 2 circuits, you'll get all the components from the silo.
---
It definitely gives my 3* bloodied dcg with faster swing speed a run for its money
---
Yes a Japanese noodle vendor that the average player can literally not understand is a good story npc.
---
Lol you died to a tse shotgun after the nerf
---
I would settle for a max cap cost of like 25 or something instead of those 35+ ones to get across the map.
---
Heh. Suits me, clears my damn stash out. I’d rather new players took the free ammo but whatever.
---
This is correct.
---
No we don't. Play with a team if your bored or get good.
---
Its not the perks, its the armor. Get Assassins sentinel. Get a good weapon too.
---
Yep, can confirm that. Had a rocket turret on a roof and someday it was gone. Of course I thought it was just broken, went in to camp mode but nothing there. Deleted the roof and I got a massive part of my building budget back, so I’m guessing I „scrapped“ my invisible turret with the roof.
---
They aren't tradeable :/
---
Then environmental suit is the way to go.    Pretty much zero rad damage.  Max out sneak and just keep a stealth boy hotkeyed in case you draw too much attention.   Or just be prepared to sprint out of the area.
---
The humans were weak and too preoccupied to level up.
---
Only the Brotherhood tried, but they went with a power armor build with hunting rifles or laser rifles, that didn't work out so well for them.
---
You have to earn them yourself unfortunately.
---
I still haven't managed to do it as after the first few days of release I finally got online but no-one turned up to it. 
---
I hope they do.
---
You are map visible on survival servers? W...T...F...
---
Most enemies don't even have ER so AA shouldn't have been on laser weapons in the first place. I doubt they'll ever fix it and AA on energy might become legacy.
---
Rose was honestly my favorite part of the main questline... Which, Fallout76 considered, isn't saying much? But she's so great she'd probably have been one of my favorites in any other game. I wish there were more characters like her, the whole "no human NPCs" thing wouldnt be so bad if there were more characters like her. Was she annoying? Hell yes, but what should we expect? A psychopathic raider leader that's NOT annoying? I think not.
---
She's really compelling as a character, a hell of a lot more than most of the others. It's a shame she's only really relevant outside of her radio for all of a couple of hours.
---
I still do this daily pretty often. I am still waiting on firecracker Whiskey to get fixed.
---
Consoles have spotify too! Idk about ps4, but xbox will play spotify alongside your game.
---
Dont we have immunity from that quest in Charleston?
---
It's not just the ones produce there it's any clean ones you find in the world can't be used as well
---
Good catch! If I can remember I'll fix that tonight
---
I sell all magazines for 20 caps each, rarely have any in stock. i buy them at 10 or less each. Maps i sell for 50 caps each, i buy all I find for 25 and under. Can't keep them in stock either. I move lots of other stuff as well, bulk scrap I sell for 40-50, usually gears, springs and screws sell pretty quick, i sell ultracite and black titanium regularly as well at 4-6 caps each. i buy all food i find for 8caps and under, as well as all radaway and stimpaks for 10/5 for diluted. If you don't gouge people and you have lots of weapons and armor up people flock to your machines and product moves from my experience. The higher end stuff might be tougher to move, or it might move really fast. Had a tse dragon with faster reload sell for 15k within a half hour of listing it. I sell .45, 5mm, 5.56 and 50 cal ammo quite regularly. the rest just doesn't seem to move.
---
Which should be fixed
---
There is method in my madness. I don't like filling up my SSD with extra crap. Hence the reason why I use Nvidia experience as I have a 2TB drive devoted to making video and pics. What I should have done is just hit F10.
---
Not in PvP, but PvE sure
---
Stop by the vendors in your game, I see tons of plans and recipes from others shops especially the high level ones
---
That style of play is not viable. You will feel like you can’t kill anything and constantly struggle to stay alive all while never having any caps or loot. I would suggest picking a weapon type and sticking to it. Melee shotguns and heavy use strength. This also gives extra carry weight if your a vendor type and want to hold a lot of loot all at once. Perception is for rifles. Agility is for pistols. Agility also affects stealth while perception affects vats hit chance.  If you want to be a power amor user you will want intelligence. If not you want endurance. You have a limited amount of special points and the allocation of them is more vital than the perk cards you slot in since you can switch them about freely.
---
Here bro, take this wig.
---
That’s why I always make sure I have 24 scrip left I the bank before I buy a three star armor piece.
---
It's eb games
---
In the last days i imagined how interesting it would be if in survival were only "out-of-the-vault" starters allowed and additionally no legendary weapon/armor found. Instead you would get a higher amount of mats/aids per exampel.
---
Would be just pure and raw survival.
---
Are you sure?
---
😂😂 probably just happy you bought something and didnt turn into warren buffet telling them their prices are all wrong. Ive had a few people do it to me and its quite nice really. They come and give you a thumbs up or a heart lol is nice 😄
---
You do make a really good point. I really liked her at first and hoped for more robots like her. But by the end of it all the bugs and repeating the same objective because the server wigged out I just wanted her to die. 
---
Her and Biv have been the most interesting NPC’s so far
---
GUNS GUNS GUNS!
---
P.S Need more guns.
---
No it doesn’t, this is a rumor.
---
But constantly getting stronger and playing in survival is a lot of fun. I try and beat my survival high score always. 
---
Then I open a shop to sell the junk and aid I get from PvP in adventure, then use those caps to get even stronger. 
---
I’ve been playing since the stress test and I still don’t feel like I’m the strongest you can be yet
---
Personally, I don't use PA, but mannequins would be nice, to show off our rare or funky armours/clothing, especially some of the rare drops from events, it would be great to have them on show, like trophies.
---
The problem with that is it that having all the switches in one spot is not only not as interesting, but also a hassle when you have to keep going back and forth.
---
Plus the fact that, in general, switches should not give off power a radius in the first place.
---
Also this has just started happening just recently as far as I can tell, they worked exactly how I wanted them to less than a couple weeks ago.
---
Shotguns actually go over 3 different SPECIAL stats: STR, PER, AGI.
---
Heavy is the same: STR, INT, LCK
---
Melee/Rifle is probably the best overlap since you can keep all the Rifle (minus Tormentor) in PER and just swap STR with damage OR traveling pharmacy, etc.
---
Definitely best weapon given by weekly challenge so far, and what's more important, very easy to get.
---
*throw up emote
---
I also do flipping but I sure as heck don’t over charge lol 250 to 12k that is just pure capitalism
---
Damn that's a hell of a bubblegum one!
---
While yes, it's kinda annoying. I've never found it too horrible. Though I'm on PS4. I just tend to stay away from the hotspots.
---
Usually people aren't even that bad. I've had more friendly encounters than murder sprees. Yeah, there are the level 120's with TSE weapons but I usually just jump off a cliff before I hit the leaderboard.
---
A quick little death and I get my lootbag and continue on my way. No biggy.
---
I leave it on the bed then take a selfie 😂😂😂
---
What is the quest called and how do i get it? Sorry - havent played Fo76 in a while, just coming back to it
---
Everyone's dead you see no struggle. Get the fudge out dude, have you even played the story?
---
As far as these "other players" go, I hope for the best, but plan for the worst!  
---
Thankfully FO76 is far more friendly than hostile, especially in light of recent updates/patches.
---
This. Although I'm not sure if adding sth that was supposed to be included from the get-go half a year after release warants being called 'magnificent'..
---
Thank you, my need for news is now satiated until the Big show Sunday! I can´t wait, I hope you have a great presentation!
---
Sweet. I was being lazy and hoping for some near me ha.
---
Not sure if it's still a thing but previously, players weren't able to see all of the star modifiers on legendary gear unless camp owner was present. That is why I would go to my camp if someone is purchasing...and also to see if they might be interested in any of the super cool shit I keep on my person.
---
Will never happen.
---
I was being general. I was associating each weapon type with the special stat that their damage cards are in. To get the full damage potential out of one weapon you need a minimum of 9 and if you spread all your points or evenly you will fall short while also having useless perks in other stats that you wouldn’t need depending on your play style.
---
I'm RPing as a guy pretending to be deaf...
---
Sure. Just making conversation. ;)
---
Get some Cranberries, sugar and gourd or just Cranberries with water and you can craft food for +5 or +10% xp.
---
Sleeping gives you another 10%.
---
Then visit a Location with super mutants, for example the lumber mill in the north west corner of the map.
---
Sneak+ hunting rifle should do it, no matter the perks.
---
After that being said, check how effective the perks you have equipped are with the weapons you use. Rather go for 1 or 2 weapons, than 5 different ones.
---
Perks that ignore armor are good in general, adrenalin is great for mobs.
---
And ask a lvl 50+ to craft you a full modded weapon for your level
---
Sorry to burst your delusional bubble, but it did in fact say "Canvas". They changed it to "Nylon" after they were called out on it (see the wayback machine link below).
---

---
Np I usually wait til I got a bunch...so maybe in a couple days
---
Upvoted for visibility, but I doubt they care much about it - I still have many challenges "frozen" with almost done: 3 world discoveries (despite I've discovered every single location on the map and tired to do complete challenge with alts - no luck), one requiring killing big enemies (SBQ is still missing despite I've killed countless SBQs) and many more.
---
For me, more irritating is broken Mire dailies - I've have been able to do them just once - from now on, no matter what I'll do, they're inactive and can't do them at all.
---
I love this so much! I had some pretty sucky experiences in the beginning. I've aimed to be more welcoming like your 100+ guy so newer players don't have to deal with what I did.
---
12k??? Lmao
---
This. They flount the atomic shop and the fancy armors but can't even fix the challenges needed to get the points
---
It doesnt have to hit zero. Once it gets to the point the hunger bar goes red your good to go.
---
Well, preading evenly would give 8 at every stat, so ;)
---
But I get your point. So I guess it's really wise to go for more specific builds...
---
"Its actually better" please elaborate? I can farm 1500 Lead in 10 mins by running through Lucky Hole mine. Workshops are early game farming tactics. If you want to maximize your time/effort/resources you have to leave workshops behind and go after the big fish
---
It’s not like you can’t play. It will just feel so bad when you see others one shorting things because they decided to go for one specific build. You give up a lot of damage when yo tho for a jack of all trades. [jack of all trades build ](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=8888888&amp;d=s50ss0si0sg0se0sj0sv0sb0pd1pk1pp1pl1e50eo2eu0ee1c72cr0cu0ce0c20i11ir0ic4a70a80aj0am0ar0an0ao0a10lv0lu0lk0lt0li0l10l71&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=) 
---
It’s just no mater what I put in it all feels like it could be better
---
Hmm. Does this also mean Strange In Numbers makes it worse?  
---
Could this also be why Grounded was (is?) screwed up with Class Freak?
---
Thanks...
---
The "Melee meattank who just grabs a rifle in special situations" was actually the most fun build I had in FO4, so let's see how it works here.
---
Guess that means I should max STR (for damage bonus and perks) and END (don't really like PA). Some AGI for more APs is always nice, and the rest, let's see what cards I can get my hands on that seem useful...
---
There are no "bugged" magazines.  They are all in game.  I only have 3 left to find out of all of them.  There's a perk you can equip that will get you a noise when close. Like a ping then pages flipping.  
---
As for the tourist, either goggle or on here, stated, you go to the tourist spots on the map.  The cemeteries, the amusement parks, uncanny caverns, etc.   I found mine at Philippi cemetery.  
---
For the tadpole and possum badges, the only ones I know for sure are bugged are the Musician and Chemist.  Musician:  you can get 7/14.  Chemist: the 3 syringer with animals and the elusive plasma grenade recipe.  So you should be 21/25 for that.
---
I'm happy to answer any questions.  Also once I find the last 3 magazines, I'll be posting a guide.
---
I paid full price on release, enjoyed the first 150~ hours, but have mixed feelings at this point. But for 12 quid it's definitely worth it.
---
I don't like talking to random ass strangers and it would honestly almost never be necessary. What do you need me to say so badly for you to be able to understand what we're trying to do? If you're on a team doing a quest or event or whatever there's just no need to communicate. Even launching a nuke. It's not like this is fucking WOW
---
Canceling drawing animations and reducing the aim time? Not only it looks unrealistic and immersion breaking but they’re also making the combat mechanics unnaturally easier, and PvE combat is already easy. Why don’t just give us godmode and instakill already at this point?
---
Quite possibly. More testing could easily show that. A full group with a max perk will really show it
---
Oh shit guess what the nuke silo isn't as hard as I remember
---
I wonder if the issue is that other players would be able to enter it and walk off with it.
---
Bloodied MELEE is ridiculously over powered (and most melee is OP anyhow). The only ranged case I can think of that's crazy OP is a bloodied Gauss or Dragon and they still don't come close to melee due to their fire rate limitations.
---
Awesome! The choice of colours is spot on. Well Done You!
---
if your just starting, then your options will be limited until you start moving [up. You](https://up.You) will soon get a feel for the direction that suits you.
---
An all round set up is perfectly viable, but its all trade off's.

I cant leap over tall buildings in one leap (with or without a cape), I cant one shot everything, but I dont NEED to. I get by just fine. I dont struggle with anything.

---
When was the nerd? This happened months ago. But I guess if you hear a story, you assume it happened today...
---
I believe so. My low level alt has a max level resolute veteran.
---
Same thing happened to me, I'm level 135 and I was chilling in my base, just managing inventory, crafting some ammo. My base is right above Site Alpha in the mountains so its a pretty quiet neighborhood apart from occasional Yao Guai thats trying to rape my Corn and Tatoes. So as I was chilling I hear somebody on the open mic, turns out it was a new to the game level 14 player asking if I had some spare materials. I crafted fully modded level 15 handmade and armor for him, dropped some ammo, meanwhile he enjoyed venturing around my base. Bear in mind, I had my vending machine turned off cause I was doing some renovations in my camp aswell, so my camp icon was not on the map, which means this newbie guy just randomly stumbled upon my base! He then thanked me and waved me goodbye. I instantly felt that Appalachia is lively even without npc's, cause this encounter was so random and felt natural, just as two people would react to each other in the wild wasteland!
---
If it were a handmade he'd probably get it.
---
Use XBL looking for group feature and msg the people in your game.
---
Good to hear, I’m glad I could help!
---
Got an assaultron head that turned into a 2 star as soon as i traveled away. Bad enough you waste 100 scripts to get crap, but then you don't even get the max back when you try to rescrap the crap.
---
Have fun getting into it and exploring the world in your preferred playstyle!

When you arrive at the Point, where some get bored because they finished the Main Quest, be assured that there is a vast Community who generates content.
---
I'm in the same boat
---
Must be a joke or typo lol
---
Grounded is bugged if you use Class Freak? There's no way, I'm using a Gatling Laser/Plasma and still do a lot of damage... Well, I wouldn't mind getting Grounded away to have even more damage.
---
I'd love to display my full Nuka Cola Power Armor since I never wear it...I just have it to have it...
---
You got a deal on it and there's plenty to do!  Take it easy, don't feel rushed to get to a super high level, and enjoy!  What time of day do you normally play?  If  you're in the UK, i'm typically playing around 1-5pm your time.  Feel free to message me and i'll shoot you my psn.
---
At least getting a good endgame weapon on Destiny 2 is not totally based on chance
---
Go to any train station.  There are posters there which you can inspect to start the new questline.  You'll be tasked with completing 3 different set of challenges (among other things), and then you'll be awarded the backpack.  The challenges it wants you to fulfill are located in the "World" category of your challenges menu (They'll only show up once you've got to that point in the questline).
---
This should definitely be a thing!!! I would join in a heart beat
---
Vanguard will quickly lose it's bonus DR the second you start losing any health. Never tried it, but I'm thinking paired with a Vampire weapon, it might work out pretty good to ensure your'e always max health and can get the full benefit of the Vanguard armor.
---
Did somebody ever told ya that **it's not about size?**
---
Scorchbeasts are still marked as Scorched and Animal, thus both Hunter's and Zealot's work on them. Zealot's Prime is exceptionally good, only surpassed by Executioner's Prime when below 40% health (and you are not a bloodied build I may add).
---
Right.. right... but still, people can still outdamage a vampire effect. Maybe a mini gun? Lol faster firerate = faster healing? Lol
---
Im suffering this too. I maxed out the perk the other week thinking I'd be set for 5.56, but oh no, in the last week or so it never procs. I thought it was maybe me being unlucky with rnjesus.
---
I'm in the same situation.
---
If that's true, that's one hell of a nerf.
---
Which challenges are bugged?
---
working for me, as of last night. (same 5,56)  but it does seem that its been slightly nerfed over the last week or so across the board.
---
I rebuilt my base and had a higher budget. But I think it’s just really glitchy
---
Stupid monkey, go to the survival server and leave the humans alone.
---
100% agree, and I am RG colourblind, so it makes it even worse!!!
---
It’s all good I never ended up dying and we beat the event 😂
---
*slap* Damn radio... *slap* *hit*....always when 16 tons or country roads is on *hit* *slap* god i wish for wasteland videos.
---
I live on Sunshine Oil, so I can definitely understand the frustration of trying to find irradiated Sugar Bombs. I think this was explained in the lore, if I remember correctly... Something about how the irradiated ones are the secret to the flavor, I think
---
I appreciate and support all these suggestions but it’s not going to make the wasteland terrifying at all. I already said many times and I will keep saying it that the problem are not the creatures being easy but rather the system not punishing you for dying. 
---
Bethesda can literally create the most OP creature that one shots everything but it’s not going to scare you, because you know that if it kills you you’re just going to spawn back in 3 seconds 5 feet away and going again at it, trying to kill it over and over until you finally manage to do it. 
---
Now imagine losing one level, 10% of your caps or the last weapon/armor you equipped everytime you die, I CAN FUCKING GUARANTEE YOU that even a pack of mole rats become terrifying.
---
They stack remainder-multiplicatively:
---
Tank killer 3 is **36%** armor ignore, that means 64% armor remains. Perforating magazine is **40%** armor ignore, 60% remains. Anti-armor is **50%** armor ignore, 50% armor remains. Exterminator 3 is **75%** armor ignore on bugs and mirelurks, 25% remains. If we multiply the remaining percentages:
---
`0.64 * 0.6 * 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.048` or **4.8%** remaining. 
---
That translates to 95.2% armor ignored. We don't really know if there is a cap on this number though. Generally, there is no benefit for armor-ignore if your damage output is more than 6.5 times the remaining damage resistance of your enemy.
---
ba dum dum chi
---
It depends on a bunch of factors. See  [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html) and setup your guns for comparison.
---
No idea, maybe? I'd sure be interested to find out though. At this point not much suprises me, if you can find the right combination of gear and perks, most anything will work.
---
Obviously it's not so good now since the overrepair nerf, but i could have sworn a mr handy buzz blade was worthless well before the nerf... Yet someone  turned it into some badass weapon at the time. Blew my mind lol
---
where did you advertise it?
---
It had been. Don't know if it was fixed or not. Regardless of the perk it still applied a 50% debuff to damage with energy guns.
---
I'm definitely using that. It's great.
---
Then FINALY someone will buy my ammos for 1c each...
---
I even try to sell the endgame ammos for 1c (like 5.56, .45, shells, etc), but nobody want it :(
---
Even my free ammos (10mm, fusion cells, etc) are untuch...

Does this mod keep food fresh as long as a 3 perk good with salt card?
---
I play 2-3 hours a day. have 3\* good with salt and food I cook on Monday will last until my Sun session so if the mod lasts a similar amount of time I should be able to free up the card.
---
Everyone talks about arkos pharma and I have no clue where it is
---
I didn't know I wanted to see this but now I do.
---
Also laughed about killing the Responder's dogs with explosive bait. I'd kill her as quick as any radroach if I could. Scum.
---
I haven't had any issues, it does seem to be a little less often. I just made around 4k 5.56 last  night and it duped me a big handful of them.
---
Or bugs that ported over from fallout 4 x)
---
haven't seen anyone mention Radicool under strength for a bigger boost with lower health for bloodied stacked on. I'd suggest the ninja perk card under stealth if you want to go with that route.
---
&gt; or the last weapon/armor you equipped everytime you die
---
In a game where you can play 500 hours without finding a "good gun", then when you finally find it you are too scared to use it because you lose it if you die.
---
Yeah no thanks. If BE and TSE Guns start dropping from every 3 star then maybe but then again nobody would actually want to play that way. People don't like losing stuff they grind for hundreds of hours.
---
I've been thinking of locking the back door of my bar. It's mostly because it would be locked IRL and you would easily get around it by entering through the front and then walk past the "Employees only" sign. Likewise I think the safe that's just a stash box should be locked as it's a safe.
---
Follow the quest lines
---
They are designed to familiarize new players with the world and game mechanics.  Completing all quest lines will take you to level 40-55. 
---
Also, the quest lines are sequentially level appropriate.
---
(unless the spawns get effected by high level players being in vicinity)
---
Not necessarily true, an overall build is viable in PvP as well. Not only I am a good example of that myself but check Rage Chronicles videos. He has a more or less balanced build like mine(still not perfectly spread across all SPECIALS) and he’s kicking 99% of the player base ass.
---

---
Have an upvote for asking a question i find useful.
---
I'm conflicted with the narrative of the game and how it handles factions. On one hand, for obvious reasons, does it matter what automated voicebox you get access to resources from? My Vault Dweller is no more a US Soldier after doing the camp excercises than s/he was before. I doubt a Brotherhood 'member' could just walk into Hidden Valley like they owned the place. It's a means to an end. But I do begrudge that it's impossible to go back, once we've 'accomplished our goals', and destroy these NPCs if our characters morals dictate we don't leave budding pseudo faction leaders (one especially, in a certain bunker) around to mess up the day of any of our brothers and sisters from the Vault. (I'm guessing on that last one, as I haven't personally gotten all the way through the MQ yet, but from what I'm reading and seeing there is a status quo maintained.)
---
And yet they still manage to mistakenly select adventure instead of survival once in a while to come show us how cool they are by camping people while invisible to one-shot us from the back with their bloodied-two-shot-explosive-mutant-berserker rifle... uuuuf sexy
---
And so they kill you, they stand up, feeling manly, they look proudly in the mirror and see themselves as a geekier version of Jason Momoa’s Khal Drogo and they whatsapp their mates to tell them how the raw rubber, a gear and a couple of screws he just looted was well worthy the wait behind that bush... yeeeeeah!!!
---
Thanks for the new iPhone wallpaper - Keep it up, this is amazing!

Man I'd love for them to fix this. I like the eating/drink mechanic but I have been finding it tedious as of late.

I love her. But I agree her quests suck.
---
You would need specifically a LMG for firefirate for the vampires effect which is eh in pvp and great in pve. Mini guns take too long to spool up for them to matter in PvP. By the time you start firing you'll be dead. However if you can get your hands on a faster fire rate explosive or antiarmor assault rifle then you'll probably get somewhere. Still I've found vanguard to be just overall not worth it in my expierence.
---
What? Purified water has a value of 20c and you sell them for 25c? :P
---
Welcome!  I had similar hesitations but also got a good deal on amazon a couple months ago and I’ve been loving it so far. 
---
If you’ve played any fallout games before you’ll figure out most of this game very quickly. This sub also has a lot of great guides and info you can search back for.
---
What gun is it?
---
It's fckn gnarly, I renamed it to the Bloodied Day Wrecker because that's what it does.
---
SBs are 3hits tops to dead, 1 power attack to dead. Yogis are 2 reg attacks.
---
Its my new daily driver now, with my set up I do around 1400 reg damage at 30% health. No iron fist at all.
---
Maybe if we could build a personal power armor station that displays owners PA and only owners could use it. Additional menu for choosing which PA to show.
---
If it's placed in a camp then it would suffer damage like any thing else placed, that would leave PA vunerable to griefing and also nuking
---
I wouldn't say they're bug free either though. There is some funky stuff with half of them. It looks like the art and effects were mixed up poorly, a lot of Backwoodsman seems to have the wrong effect corresponding to the cover. One has stuff about the art of the tomahawk on the cover but does something else entirely and another unrelated issue has the better tomahawk effect. I also had a Scout's Life or something that instead had an Awesomely Awesome Tales cover.
---
Luckily i'm not the only one. Wanted to go further with this questline because i thought i haven't done everything yet. When i select the quest it shows up in my hud, but it won't tell me what to do or where to go.   
---
All the holotapes have a mark behind them to say it are quest items, but listening to all doesn't let me progress any further in the questline.
---
Also, i can't remember which part of this quest i already did. So there goes this questline....
---
Do I need twitter to compete?
---
I love the idea of a game in which I'm too concerned to experience the game.
---
I appreciate your zeal, but all this would accomplish is driving players away in droves, and the game already had a rough start (I have never in my life seen someone of Todd Howard's level in business admit to a product damaging the brand). Lowbies who haven't made friends yet. Melee builds in general would be rendered laughable; everyone would become a stealth sniper or heavy weapons user by necessity, rendering a third of the games perks pointless, and characters heavily invested in melee would have to be rebuilt. And this is before the eventual problem that will face the game as it stagnates, that you won't be capable of doing 70% of the games content, because no one turns up for events (this is already happening, but most can be done solo), nuke zones will be empty with no support (something that is going to be a problem is Scorchbeast Queens are ever supplanted as an endgame boss also), and so forth. As someone who is only just starting to be able to take cathartic vengence upon the bloated menaces, it's already bad enough to wander into Whitespring as an oblivious 20-something and to be ripped apart by a pack of glowing max-level ghouls that you could have sworn were level 10 a few hours ago. Walking down the road and then being ragdolled into orbit by wonky physics as a Behemoth stomps up behind me while I flick through my junk would be hilarious but also disheartening if I could forsee no reasonable way of dealing with it aside from building the Unstoppables.
---
&gt;There are no "bugged" magazines.  They are all in game. 
---
Wrong. Awesome Tales 4 isn't in the game.
---
No, I was told that menu lagging into a purchase doesn't warrant a refund. I don't even own an xbox anymore, switched to PC and never looked back.
---
The bloody thing sell for 2k easily and i can probably even get 3k from it. Id suggest that you try to spawn the vendor bot instead, he sell it for 700 to 800 caps depending on your charisma.
---
ok this may sound stupid but do i need to trigger / start this weekly challenge somewhere or just do the 5 tasks in no particular order?
---
It would be great if you'd do PC. I have at least three characters' CAMPs that I'd enter. I don't use mules for items. I use mules for CAMPS. I'm not sure the fourth is ready for entering in a competition yet. It still has budget left. The fifth is still just a small wooden shack until I transfer plans to that character.
---
This. I hit SBQ with The Dragon a few times throughout the fight but focus mostly on adds. Doing so allows people to focus fire on the Queen and helps lower player deaths.
---
Calm down now Thanos :)
---
Do you wear power armor? Cause they are already stupidly op for me feral ghouls kill me in a few hits glowing add way too much radiation, bots are stronger than they need to be..
---
Then the current Fallout 76 is the perfect game for you. Zero risks, easy peasy.
---
theres tons of ways to play, and theres lots to see and do. I'm almost 148 on my main, have a 47, a 19, a 14 all on playstation, and a 31 on xbox. I still come across places i've never been to. I haven't finished all the quests or content, and have redone my build on my main and am still tweaking it. My alts will all play the game differently than my main and that will open new doors of fun for me. I haven't even tried survival yet, and i might just start a complete newb to do it on. Right now between me and my wife we have 2 playstation accounts and an xbox account so theres still like 6 character slots left for us to start new characters with.
---
I have a solution fo that.... spend spend spend.
---
Try and use the hd texture dlc in fo4 if you havnt dont that. Its graphicaly similiar to 76 while vanilla fo4 is not.
---
Sorry! Just made some sketches for the Toxic Valley. I'm planning on doing the mire next. Really would like to make the giant treehouse somehow.
---
Honestly, with how much armor you find in the wasteland, I'd be perfectly fine chunking a whole set just to make it decor.
---
Give me a week or so and i hope i can be of service.
---
yeah anything about PVP will get downvoted to oblivion here, i mean you now have a legit easy soft PVE mode, why the hate on players that like to play survival for some challenge.
---
Well yes but no. I want to save up for expensive things in the market. Lol some things go over 25k
---
I would absolutely love to be able to enter without the need for joining twitter! You would have my full gratitude! Especially if you accepted entries on PC.
---
LOVE IT!! 🙏🤯
---
Mind if I borrow it for my phone wallpaper?
---
It was useful back when CAMP damage was a thing, increasing damage by 50%? Yes please!
---
Oh! I would love this, but sadly I'm on PC.
---
I would especially love to get feedback and ideas for improvents!
---
Do you feel like you understand the concept of escapism? Actual hardship and struggles exist in life.
---
So you want an RPG where you lose all your stuff when you die and all enemies should be extremely dangerous and one shot you?
---
That ain't fallout.
---
You can test this yourself, when you die. Drop your best weapon and leave the server.
---
Now dying has consequences, if you like it that way nobody is stopping you from playing the game your way.
---
I do it full custom and here is my most bonkers design

That's something I tried, I put up all ammo types and cores for 0 zero caps, nothing sold, absolutely nothing, I'm thinking that regardless of super duper the game NPCs and caches boxes bleed so much ammo there is no need for anyone to buy.

I show everything working, join a server off someone's profile then show it being buggy. Sorry for the long load screen time Xbox isn't easy editing clips I could only trim the clip not crop out the useless waiting.
---
I'll keep trying just for LOLs but really it doesn't matter that much, lead, gunpowder and steel are so plentiful, Super Duper is a moot point anyway.
---
It does look like then maybe, that 5.56 specifically has been broken with regards Super Duper the only ammo type I need to craft. Shotgun shells is the other type I use but scorched seem to produce a never ending supply of shells.
---
I shall do that at my earliest convenience, blood will flow, be assured O.o
---
Dude is a scumbag that abuses DMCA takedowns.
---
Can't fault your logic... UV from me.
---
Stupidly powerful.  Yes.
---
Yet you can still glitch through out of bounds in the silos with a PA...
---
No you can't. That was also fixed.
---
Well, the cost in junk to build stuff decreases when you level up and get that perk that lowers the cost, but other than that...
---
Great build
---
When you visit a vendor and interact with the owner positively, then you check their goods and realise you won't be dropping a cap. Awkward.
---
No mans Sky just announced or released a HUGE new update, that is probably why.
---
The camp system is so whack, for being such a key part of the game. I loved the settlement system in fallout 4 and although it had some problems it was fixable with mods. I had hoped by the next fallout release they would have worked out the kinks of settlements. Somehow they took a step in the wrong direction and made it WAY worse.
---
If it's really old it would be the change to the budget that they did some time ago where turrets and light suddenly cost a lot less but was limited in numbers instead. I expanded my CAMP a lot that day.
---
Yea there's 2 versions just like most packaged food in the game if you think about it,it makes sense since not everything will be affected by the radiation ( especially if your running sunshine meadows) it would be "new" never affected by radiation.... Unfortunately you have to go look for the irradiated stuff for these recipes
---
I use multiple rifles, but all single shot. ammo is generaly not a problem.
---
super/d kicks in , bonus, and thats the way I think about this card. Nice, but dont count on it.

ROFL, not trolling, you can easily place the PA halfway inside the ceiling on boxes and use that to get oob in the "fix the pipes" area.
---
Bloodied explosive gatling plasma.  One of many things to mention.
---
I wonder if my mic even works...
---
Username check out. Get lost man. That stuff was patched ages ago.
---
Yesterday I've crafted ultracite ammo: 2x .308 bundles and 2x .45 bundles - super duper triggered twice ;)
---
You'll be able to get through anything PvE if you spec for VATS. This allows you flexibility to deal damage with any weapon you select. Also you can go with level 1 of each possible weapon card, have +45% out of +75% possible anyway, and be really flexible.
---
Your only must-have perks are Action Boy, Four Leaf Clover, Bloody Mess, Fireproof and Adamant skeleton. I suggest grabing sneak, escape artist, and covert operative anyway. VATS headshots from sneak will often OHKO opponents even without a crit.
---
Select automatic over single fire perks, weapons which can be both auto and semi have their VATS cost reduced by 50% when put into auto fire. With an automatic 10mm gun and Grim Reaper Spirit you can easily have 30+ shots from 10mm auto pistol, each 3-4 bullets taking down an enemy (thanks crits), each 3-4 enemies resetting your AP bar to full, infinite AP.
---
hope they fix this one, getting tired of having to eat and drink so often
---
The part where you could get in and out of it to get through walls was yes, it still doesn't check for collision on ceilings though. LOL
---
The alternative is that everything is there for you all the time.... not realistic and would make the game even less challenging...
---
if only we had some kind of box with a lock on it to keep item Safe... or a stash for caps, that they could implement
---
I hate her as a person, I really did want to kill her with my switchblade. The smug, arrogant fuck.
---
Massive props to her VA though, she pulled off the character really well.
---
Exactly.  Like a normal stash but only for caps. I Would like mine in the shape of a mini nuke :3
---
Yeah, I guess, but I'm not talking about weapons or armor or anything game changing. When I spend more time staring at loading screens and waiting than playing I'm not having a great time. All I really want is not to end up on servers that have been up for hours, already looted to hell.
---
I forgot how buggy the game used to be... I got it fairly late so I lucked out on that part. I can't imagine how frustrating her quests would be when the game was even worse!
---
I hate her because for me her quest has bugged and I cannot progress with the main story :(
---
Just east of 76, north of Helvetia
---
There were several silo skips that all got patched at once, the power armor and the vats methods are gone.
---
Most of them are gone, you can still glitch oob by using PA on the boxes on the right side of the room where you repair the cooling pipes for the reactor that lets you get on the ceiling. It is how people are still able to complete silo charlie this week even though the silo is bugged.
---
What platform you on? I got loads of cheap stuff you can buy I need the free slots😀

No particular order, just in survival

The reddit market is retarded and im glad Player vendors are a thing.

I have about 150+ damaged ones and 15- 30 fixed I sell both in my machine
---
Yes! Same. 3 events n nothing. Wasted more than thousands of rounds for nothing. Bestha should compensate me for the lost time to re-farm the rounds again.
---
I hope so but I doubt it. It’s a hard event to complete without help. What I always do is start the event but don’t initiate the experiment. Now just send team invites to everyone you can on your server. You may only get one or two join your team, but others will check where you are on the map and see Project Paradise is going. I run the event a lot and this does help get others involved. 
---
Also while you’re waiting on people, initiate the experiment and shut down the AI. This will help heal the friendly animals between waves and guarantee the Arktos Pharma backpack skin if you’re successful.
---
Can you get Deathclaw skins yet? I thought that one was bugged.
---
All your stuff? I said the last thing you equipped, you drop it when you die and still have a chance of getting it. This will make things much more tactical than your usual no brainer explosive spraying Rambo style. 
---
And I tried myself something similar. I modded Fallout 4 into a much more realistic and hardcore version of the game and it was a thousand times more engaging, fun and intense.
---
Have they ever addressed the mouse-jerk issue that causes you to look an extra 90 to 180 degrees than you intended when inside buildings?
---
Which doesnt make sense. Whats the diff?
---
That one still shows unchecked for me, even though I've been there.
---
yeah, there was a friendly radtoad chilling in his base and some other guy came up and killed it. I don’t know if he thought it was hostile though or if he was just being mean
---
I wonder if you play during peak times? I’ve never had this problem but I play at weird hours.

With fix less gum drops

What's down there? Pics?

I have a vampires FFR mini gun. I agree with the spool up taking to long for pvp, but for almost everything else i can just tank damage and my health is instantly refilled. Its amazing.

  That being said, it dosent have the highest damage so i rarely use it. But things like the imposter sheepsquatch.....i can be a conduit, and take the robot head on. As long as i keep shooting it, im basicly indestructable
---
FO76 need an extended map designed for highl lvl players with better gear.
---
Sometimes, yeah. Right now it's early morning so I would assume not, but I think I've been getting worlds that were thoroughly looted overnight.
---
Are they tough? Despite owning since christmas i havent got to level 30 yet (I think im Lv28).
---
I havent really got into the game due to a mix of exams and preference for the older games. May give it another chance though.

---
My camp is bare bones basic and it's at about 95% build capacity... I see other people's castles and sprawling ranches and just think "How?" 
---
I swear I am missing some quest that allows you to build a well appointed camp.
---
NOT 100% ,but fairly sure, whats in a box or  or general junk, is specific, to you.
---
many times i've moved thru an area, that I know some else has been there minutes ago,and stuff still there.
---
Boxes and containers can contain something different for each player ie stimpak for me, buffout for the other player next to me. just pure rng.
---
also noticed that server hopping will not regen the loot for the same player, in the same area. (usually)
---
Until then, I recommend growing razorgrain and making soup! 20% food and 15% water
---
*sweet hot-fix coming up*
---
For the sbq I think you have to be the one that gets the killing blow on it, not just part of the group, the person that gets the last hit is the one that technically killed it I think, at least that's how it worked for the behemoth for me anyway, killed as part of a group it didn't unlock, but when I killed one on my own it ensured I got the killing blow on it, the sbq is my last one to get also
---
Well, that sucks. I’m just surprised that I’ve never run into that problem. I don’t search for anything on a regular basis so that might be why I haven’t noticed.  
---
May the servers be kind to you and your needs :)
---
She's my favorite NPC in 76.  The second half of her quests, not so much.
---
anyone seen where vault 63 is :)
---
Oh, if you have “Can Do” perk, a run through Whtesprings (inside) trash cans always gets me lots of canned coffee.
---
I've gotten 2. They're just super rare and random. Got one from a metal box in white springs. Behind the locked building between club house and houses. Where there's a metal box, red tool box and a ladder. Near where the rad stags spawn. Also got one at darling sister lab/ cabin. In s green box by work bench.
---
"Ha ha lul random rite guiiiizzzz?!"-Rose 
---
Yes, I can't wait for private servers, goal one is kill her to death
---
damn, that way it's almost impossible to do it, since half of the server teleports to fight the SBQ...
---
Boxes and containers do contain random loot, yeah. I mean the junk and stuff laying out in the world.
---
I wish
---
1300 is nothing, I'm doing 1400+ without iron fist and talons. That's with full unyeilding and around 30%health.
---
I dipped down to about 8% health last night and checked it, it was up around 1650 damage.
---
Charlie hasn't been glitched for me this week at all. Are you on pc?
---
Yeah, its based on 'survival score' enemies killed time alive all adds up unfortunately. It was great when only the players who had killed people in PvP were visible none of this bullshit behaviour
---
I mean it's abit rough, and I get why people want it fixed. But as far as effects go I've found its not too hard to adapt to aslong as you also have carnivore mutation (suppose herbivore might work). Just a tip until they fix.
---
Yeah, that's my go to when I've exhausted all the set spawns I know of. I don't love the RNG of it but usually still worth a trip.
---
PvP alt &gt;\_&gt;
---
Anglers need more hitpoints...
---
Crap, might have to rebuild an old camp for this, or does an imgur album count?
---
Yeah, it's definitely a luck thing, you're doing such a small amount of damage each it could be any number of the 20 or however many people there lol, I've done about 30 Queens and still not got the last hit on her lol, save a critical strike for that last sliver of health and hope for the best
---
Nice.
---
Farm Grafton (has 2 events in the town too). Farm the "Leader of the pack" at the county fairground for low level legendary gear.
---
Set up camp by hopewell cave or deathclaw island and farm the DCs...
---
I tend to keep to my own as well, avoiding big hotspots like the white spring etc. This guy sees you visible on the map and will fast travel to events etc just to kill you and then move on. It's pretty impressive the lengths they go to
---
Ya it's fixed, only -12% with full class freak.
---
I legit picked up a faster fire rate vampire handmade for 260 caps, I have it at 60-7500 I think, except this is a 3 star with 250 damage resist while reloading
---
The PS4 community is pretty rad. There’s a couple of people in adventure mode that tend to grief, but it’s not the hugest population. If you ever need help on some quests shoot me a pm and I’ll send my PSN
---
All fantastic ideas. None of them would make it into friendship camp, I mean adventure mode, but could be great for survival. If that were the case then I’d add the removal of legendary weapons. Those things have bothered me since they bellyflopped into Fallout 4. Not only do they bugger any sense of balance to hell and back, but they make no sense in the universe. However, they were something that other games were doing so in they went.
---
:D
---
Okay, but then they'd have a load left that they can't send out because they don't have the details of the people who bought them.
---
Not everyone who got the power armour edition sent in their details. Not everyone cared enough to request a bag.
---
I stand there with my gun out and if they don't purchase anything, I start shooting.
---
I think this is a great idea, it makes people rely on their skills and knowledge of the game to create a build to suit the environment rather than relying on the crutch that are TSE guns and assassin's gear.
---
I have 15-6-6-4-11-11-3 SPECIAL spread and can run easily with no power armor, melee specific with one LAR and have been having a great time. I also am sneaky. It’s not really the direction I meant to go, but over time it’s been good. Only thing I’ve thought about changing is taking 1-2 from Int and adding it to End.
---
I was always sneaky sniper in FO4, then tried melee in one run-through. What FUN! Now I’m kind of addicted.
---
“Good luck with that!”
---
Nah, carnivore, raw meat gives 20-50% hunger and is readily available like everywhere.  As for water I tend to drink whatever I find... Inert flux, booze and Nuka-Cola are top picks.
---
Did anyone say it didn't happen?
---
I literally run a bloodied unyielding build.
---
Much easier with a second toon
---
My main has all the utilities, like super duper, fix it good, weapon artisan etc......
---
Just trade all my gear to my main, bam, no need for like 10 perk cards
---
Curious, you gather coffee, royal jelly, etc to sell?
---
I’ve had this happen a few times so I started letting everyone else loot first then going and getting my loot. It seems to be server lag where people share the same drop because they looked at the same time
---
How about a container that’s a decoration. You put power armor pieces in it and they pop onto the display representation of the stand. You can make it so only the owner can loot it in adventure mode and make it lootable by anyone in survival mode?
---
I use a strength build that lets me swap between bloodied unyielding/PA heavy weapons
---
The thing is, not everybody who's at the endgame (or near it) is running OPAF one-shot builds, so you have people like me who already have a hard time killing things like Deathclaws get a even *more* harder time trying to kill Deathclaws because I'm not running a One-shot build
---
Have you ever meet mirelurk queen?
---
No that isn't true haha
---
Yeah. One team-buff rifleman (semi and auto) and one melee/heavy. The builds were just too different. Probably the best thing about having two different builds is that most good legendary drops will work for one character or the other.
---
Yes! And noticed wolves have a crap ton of health points for being a fairly regular(relatively) type of creature
---
I’m joking bud
---
For the future, you can save yourself some trouble by blueprinting just the walls and roofs, but not the foundation. That way you can place that by hand and avoid the floating/support error.
---
its way better then GwS food stuff last for days and it frees up the 3 luck cards. most worth wild grinding i ever did
---
This was in the patch 9 notes I believe. -12% for me.
---
That’s a load off my mind
---
Does the herbivore mutation help on soups? If so both corn and melon soup weigh 0.5 lb and give like 10% food and 15% water. If herbivore works on them then I'll grab that and all I will carry on me is soup.
---
I usually end up getting some disease from raw meat oh, like it will tell me there's a 5% chance which means there's about a 90% chance it seems.  Like in Vats when my shot percent is 95 but I missed three shots in a row.
---
Melons uncooked are good for herbivore. Both food and water. Heavy as hell though. I find my aid tab weights as much as my weapons tab these days.... but I don't want to lose speed demon.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bwm974/nuke_launch_codes_june_4th_to_june_11th/
---
Going by the post.
---
nope 1 since beta lv 211 1020 hours
---
I got herbivore. It's manageable but annoying.
---
Carnivore mutation removes disease chance from raw meat. Except spoiled meat.
---
Herbivore + (water)melons = no issues
---
Gives 20 food and 15 water and 8 rads i believe,  (could be vice versa)
---
That's a good point. You could make a second character stripped down to only the most essential perks so that by the mid-fifties you're rolling full steam.
---
Perhaps death should apply a debuff to experience gained on top of losing caps/junk and a flat 20% percent damage to equiped items? This way after 2 or 3 deaths your gear will be pretty much trashed and you have to retreat to the lower level areas of the map to recuperate resources safely?
---
u/Ladydevann - this has been around since beta also and hopefully will help your devs fix it.
---
Run my main "Grant" (a rather bad but charismatic pre war actor) since beginning with level 190+
---
Followed by non mules -  "Penelope" (smart as beauty Chemist), "Seamus" (fight, drinks, girls and corvega loving, half irish mechanic) and "Roxy" (cute but ratty greaser girl with a little chem habit) all just still level 5+
---
Razorgrain with herbivore is 20% food 15%, not sure if these percentages are affected by the mutation
---
Ya I figure it's be abit harder to find sufficient food in some places as a plant eater.
---
How much does it weigh though?  Like carrot soup weighs one pound but gives the same food and water benefit as corn soup , different other perks of course
---
I personally want to be immersed in a post apocalyptic wasteland when I play FO 76. Skyrim modded would be far more suited to your wants with all kinds of strange mods as well as cheats since its single player?
---
Razorgrain soup weighs 0.5 lbs as well!
---
It's online game, some people like to meet new people and make friends, and it is more fun to play with someone who use mic than playing with a mute
---
Oh awesome.  Still easier to make soup for me as I have everything growing in camp but that's good to know.  Been debating between the two
---
Without class Freak i do ~50 damage and with i do  ~90, so i'd argue it's finally working with the latest Patch
---
it takes a bit of work sometimes but yes you can place foundations under water then place stairs up so you can build a floor the hard part is finding somewhere to place your camp since it still needs a resting place
---
Just eat canned dog food with the perm and drink inert flux.
---
I didn’t like running cannibal and using a perk card for it in that stat.
---
Hopefully somebody with the herbivore mutation can chime in.
---
I have the herbivore mutation lol. Someone without it should test if razorgrain soup still gives 20 15
---
Trying to convey msgs w/ emotes only is like a whole mini-game.
---
I used to do Carrot soup and Boiled water, now i've found melons to be quite amazing with herbivore
---
I imagine this is why. For gameplay reasons though they probably didn't want it to be a death sentence if you didn't complete it yet.
---
Rose is an angel compared to Mrs. Hammer-The-Wall-24/7
---
I agree with high level end game areas! but I feel like even a new area would still not address the issues needed as you can see is the case with the latest Arktos event
---
Hahaha.  Ok, that makes more sense. Almost all of the soups are 10% food and 15% water. You're herbivore mutation is making it 20% and 15% water. Which means corn soup or melon soup would also go from 10 / 15 to 20 / 15.
---
u/Ladydevann please please resolve this with Patch 10 if possible.
---
I pretty much survive off of berries, packaged food, and going back to my crops when all else fails.
---
As I say it’s not game breaking but I didn’t fully test it.
---
I can’t upload to this sub
---
How is that im just over 900 hours and have a level 260, level 150, lvl 55 and a level 32
---
hahaha
---
Atom shop data mine awhile back had a bunch of potted planters and even some cacti!
---
I had a pressure plate that said "no step". I had a door which it opened, labeled private. There were opposing doors which were always opened, had "public" neon label, and all the amenities. The place had a nearby farm and set of industrial purifiers, only one closed for me. Everything was accessible, nice looking and welcoming except the "private" area.
---
Within the area was doors leading somewhere, visible when standing on the pressure plate and looking through the powered gates. Doors were locked and literally lead nowhere. The room with the doors also had a switch labeled "don't switch". It activated set of traps and a siren - I farmed nearby and I could hear it being activated.
---
Besides loot bags I also received lots of thumbs up from the people learning the new definition of scorched.
---
Ya, I have a slew of uncompletable challenges. Including some of the 80pt ones for visiting locations. Real bummer cause its basically impossible for me to grind atoms for the stuff I want, if it's limited time, I might as well pretend it doesn't exist.
---
Wait, Class Freak makes Adrenal Reaction reduce JUST 12 HP?! 
---
I don't even use any Bloodied weapon but it looks like it's totally worth it. 
---
Anyway thanks for your testing, here's hoping some CM makes Bethesda know and they fix it so I can enjoy Speed Demon even more.
---
That'd work for me too, actually!
---
Great suggestion :)
---
gotcha, again ,not 100%. stuff like abraxo. "nope, ive got a bar of soap".
---
but I do know what you mean.There are times when I cant find anything.
---
Even when the area is quiet.
---
Did ya actually go into somewhere or fall threw map?
---
And what has changed over the months? Player vending.
---
If I want to visit the other camps on the map, depending on where they are this could cost me a few hundred per server hop.
---
Oh god I just remembered having Arachnaphobia
---
I've made 1.2k worth of junk off a person and yeah for sure miss old survival. Could make max caps in less than a day
---
Don’t worry about the downvotes. There are probably several downvote bots in this sub. Literally everything gets a handful of downvotes no matter what the subject matter may be.
---
 Aim for the limbs! Ghouls with broken leg(s) are easy pickings for melee. Dont forget there are melee builds that hit for thousands of damage in game at the moment, I didnt say they should nerf damage. Also Teamwork makes the dream work!
---
How long have you not played the game lol? Its been like this for months now.
---
Either that or just go to your camp and look. It generally takes a minute at most to look.
---
As others have said.  Of the many times I’ve taken a power plant for core farming.  I’ve only had it contested 1 time.  And even then it was after I had 15 100% cores 
---
More than enough
---
Just try a different server
---
And I wouldn’t bother till you can craft a fusion power generator so you don’t have to power up plant
---
And remember u can fast travel between camp and workshop for free.   
---
Hang at camp and only travel to workshop to collect.  
---
I do this about once every other week to stock up
---
And yes.  There is a chance someone will want to pvp or contest the workshop.  But I find more people really do just ignore power plants because they understand the need for cores
---
And do onto others
---
I had a group of guys show up and asked if they could join team to farm cores and I just offered up 10 cores for them to split.  Then we all took turns looting collector and farming events quests
---
Don’t let one bad experience ruin it
---
It can be productive
---
So do it then? Dont use your last equiped weapon until you get back to your junk bag. If its gone get rid of your weapon. Its an extreme mode that the vast majority of people wont use so why waste timing coding it when it can be done willingly by those who want it?
---
you will have so much lead you will find a new 3 problems steel. acid and cloth.
---
I've noticed this if I spend over 500 caps, it will generally happen, especially if I'm buying a lot of things. They usually give a wave and give a heart emote then go off to do what they were going to do.
---
Auto sniper and shoot it like it were semi, tap-tap-tap.
---
Weapons which can be modded either to auto or semi have their base VATS AP cost defined for semi, and half of it for auto.
---
If you happen to obtain a hybdrid (either auto or semi) rifle that has -25% AP cost, this bonus considers the base value of unmodded gun. Take combat rifle, base cost 26, semi cost for -25% AP wespons 20, auto cost 13, auto cost for -25% AP weapons 7, three shots that fill your crit bar instead of one for the same AP, same gun, different receiver.
---
For manual aiming Rifleman may be better but for VATS Commando outclasses Rifleman by far. Actually for manual aiming I prefer auto too as the recoil is smaller when used via 'tap-tap-tap', allowing me to put more shots in the target in the same time when compared to semi.
---
Just left mine, good luck!
---
I'd like to see this in the PVE side of the game too.
---
So you think because the negative effect is an increase, its counted as a positive effect?
---
To field test this you would have to try this with another situation where you get an increase in something as negative effect. If your theory is correct, the result should be the same.
---
Aaaaaay! (Finger guns)
---
I make 5.56 ammo all the time.  I have never had a problem with super duper not proccing.
---
Yeah I got a VE I never use because it feels op. And the ammo crafting costs are negligible...and the ammo is recoverable!
---
Ive noticed that if its a glowing wendigo, it can resurrect ghouls with the roar.
---
*pulls out a sledgehammer*
---
Buy my stuff or I'll break your legs.
---
does the mod reduce overall carry weight?
---
I have a Lvl 50 backpack so my carry weight is +60, using it I've freed up 2 strength and reduced strong back by two points. I moved the extra perk points to luck. and overall I've gained 20lbs in carry weight. I wanted to get the high capacity mod to give me an extra 60 lbs but I haven't tested whether backpacks can be worn over hazmat suits. I don't use power armor. I have one point in sunkissed so I'm not really worried by -60 rad as I can free up two more points from strength and put one more into sunkissed and the final one to increase luck.
---
Nothing. OP is dreaming. Items with such high value aren't for sale. They are for trade only.
---
i got multiple characters in f76 and tbh i really wish i can get more. i got.
---
A jack of all trades character (my main) who is different career person depending on my camp, atm i built a dj concert and gonna play music in front of a crowd.
---
got a medic character named Dr. Love who has a mini hospital in whitespring. performing life saving surgerys and selling alot of butt drugs. His wife left him cause he got caught making out with his skeleton display that stands in the corner.
---
A Russian Soldier who looked like he went through time travel and made it to the present day. having a really awesome bar that serves multiple types of alcohol and have people swing by and socialize.
---
A Atom Cats Member named Ace who got a garage camp set near the red rocket stop that builds all types of power armor and mods, giving them sick paintjobs and selling it to people. 
---
And lastly my Big game Hunter character named “Billy Hawken Hitchcock” who specializes on using a crossbow and hunting rifle to hunt down big trophys out there in the wasteland.
---
I buy every single 5.56 ammo I see for one cap.  Doesn't matter if it is 12 or 12,000 I will buy them all.
---
 I hate going to camps and seeing all the 5.56 ammo posted for 2 caps Per bullet.  I wont touch it at 2 caps.  It's a shame too because these people would make a good amount of If they just posted their bullets for one cap a piece.
---
I have a level 62 character for adventure and I just started a level 8 character for survival.
---
I said personality and in his case plain out interesting and even lore in the computer in the mayors office.
---
The cola perk enables much faster healing though. Stimpaks are too slow for some situations (imposter sheepsquatch for example)
---
Too bad that we most likely never meet :(
---
Give us Ring Of Fire
---
Yeah, they sell really well and I never have enough.
---
Oh I totally agree as it is I dont think one shot builds should be the goal Im not hitting nearly as hard as other people specced for that cause I dont have any melee perks maxed out at lvl 70 but I feel like Deathclaws really arent that difficult to kill at the moment ecspecially compared to Yao Guais, they also dont hit as hard in my experience. The changes would just make people not default too "Oh a deathclaw! Im gonna run up to it and beat it to death!" When really I feel like you should be trying to take them down as far as possible, crippling them or at least having some mines armed before you piss it off
---
Yeah having only ~24 people on a server and only a handful of them buying at a time is definitely a tough market.
---
Aye, there be some trickery there.
---
The angle walls wont snap to the roofs like that...well they will but not with the painted sides out like that. 
---
I had to place an extra roof outside both the port and starboard sides. Then then the angles wall snaps to the outter roof with paint side out. The 2 inner roofs used as the hull are only snapped to the half windows above. 
---
It took a bit of time (and beer) to find a workaround but I'm happy with the end result
---
If i see people getting stuck in my camp when spawning in I rebuild slightly so it doesn't happen anymore it's also why I leave all doors unlocked just in case except for my generator building which is always built away from main building
---
Just done it. Look forward to seeing the results.
---
Thanks. I’ll have to practice that because I don’t really notice any difference in the sensation.
---
Yeah they have really made a point out of making some npc's extremely annoying, in my opinion. Most of Rose's quests felt pointless and her voice is very annoying. She acts like she knows that she is an invincible robot in a video game, kind of like the children in earlier fallout games. (get out of here, mungo!)
---
Then we have the robots at the DMV. I get it, that one is done on purpose, and it would have been kind of funny if it wasn't for people crashing halfway through the quest and having to start over a bunch of times. 
---
MODUS is another thing on its own. This is again just my opinion, but i REALLY hate how he pauses....when he... talks. It doesn't seem like he have to find the right words, it seems like he is deliberately dragging out the time it takes for him to finish a sentence. Why would he need time to find the right words? isn't he a giant super computer? 
---
How about the "Census Violence" bot? I know that protectrons are supposed to have a slow and robotic voice, but for the love of Atom, please make him recognize you if you have done the event before, so I don't have to listen to him speak for so long. (something like "Welcome, volunteer! It's good to see an outstanding citizen like yourself wanting to help out again! lets get started, shall we?")
---
Oh oh, how about Sanjay? don't you just love hearing his voice announcing that the food processors at Mama Dolce's is ready to work again, for the billionth time, when you are just trying to complete a daily mission? Never mind that you are listening to a holotape from a mission with important info/lore, this takes priority! I would so love to see a feature to disable the "event annoncement" audio, as it really gets repetitive. Even if his voice wasn't annoying, it would eventually become annoying.
---
And you can also take chems like Fury for 30% more melee damage, mole rat chunks 1 strength and certain meats will give a 10% melee boost.
---
I'm not quick enough to pop open the favorites wheel and precisely select the right thing when I need to so it doesn't really matter. So many times I've opened it to select a rad away and it's bounced over something else (xbox elite controller likes to bounch back and the sensitivity will sometimes make its luck the thing on the opposite side of the wheel during the bounce).  The only time I'm drinking nuka is when I'm either out of combat or a situation where I know have time to actually go into the pip boy menu and select it.  So the healing benefit really doesn't help me.
---
Green thumb, plant melons at home base, infinite food and water! Feeding herbivores is way easier, they just don't get the good buffs!
---
ah, good ol capitalism
---
We're kicking you out of the raider club, Jeff
---
And if he had declined....?
---
I didn't read the entire post. You're pbly on to something but higher levels are tougher and glowing makes them even more so. I hope for lvl +100's in the future.
---
Ah point taken
---
I did nearly all NV with a pistol... up close silent assassin... was great. 
---
Found a quad + FFR + faster reload 10mm that I now use as my side arm (event tagger and low level killer) doesn't feel like the 10mm could ever be viable as a primary in fo76 :(
---
I would have offered 500. I help out the low lvl guys when I can. Gotta build em up before you can tear em down.
---
I'll tell you what are good ideas. Good ideas is not try to satisfy all the people coming from different directions with one thing.
---
First, Casual mode should be added, and it should reference Filthy Casuals camp poster language in the mode selection screen. Gals and guys deserve that. No PvP, workshops are first come first serve.
---
Then, Adventure mode. What we have now.
---
Then, Survival mode, what we have now + new way of summoning people to desired playground via in-game interface (maybe events that you trigger when you use an item somewhere?) + 100% level caps cost upon death with a maximum at 100 + camps can be destroyed because WTF is the current situation, the trapcamp heaven. This is the gangs area and if you break whats great about it expect gangs to stop hunting for other gangs and start randomly trolling elsewhere.
---
Then, Hardcore Survival mode: full loot drop upon dying, no mules, single hardcore slot per account, twice the stash size, no legendary items, all you can use is what you can craft and the meta is not about minmaxing the damage but about minimising cost per maximum damage. No leaderboard map markers. Bonus twist: legendary items permitted but only quest and event rewards, the 'named legendaries', so that each and every legendary item is legendary. Still dropping upon death. All unpicked loot bags remaining on server for half an hour should cleared out by the server and randomly distributed across worlds containers for more "woah".
---
All of the modes could also use Faction system being added.
---
If you are a solo player, then the revive another player task can be a pain especially at lower levels. It's one of the requirements to finish the Tadpole quest line.
---
Then I'll join one of the BoS player factions... they are WAY more hostile and raider like anyway. And with the added bonus of thinking you're better than everyone else. Lol.
---
Heh, welllll... that’s the reason for the problem ;)   If you’re going to farm that stuff to sell, so are other people. Which makes it harder to get because you’re all server hopping to get rare stuff just to sell. 
---
I mean, no skin off my nose - but it’s sorta funny you’d complain about it.
---
Nope. I've killed the queen before and it still didn't count. I know this as I had the kill legendary enemies challenge tracked and when she died, that triggered and added one. So I definitely got the killing blow.
---
Still need to kill the queen apparently.
---
Muricaaaa! Fuck yeah!
---
i do have 4 characters one is my main and is still my favourite (stealth rifleman)
---
my second is an al melee character which was an refreshing playstyle experience as he is way less maintenance heavy you barely need ressources its the perfect playstyle for anyone who just wants to play every now and then without worrying to much over crafting and shit
---
the third character is my heavy weapons explosive powerarmor tank 
---
and the fourth was planned to fill out every other weapon categorie i havent touched i was able to do a good and viable combination of commando/gunslinger/shotgunner/unarmed but i have now abandoned his perception stat to invest more in to luck
---
my main reason to do more characters was just so i could use every weapon type at perfect effectiveness
---
however due to how fo76 special system works i realized i ended up with very similar results most of the time
---
XB1.  1)  Any time I try to meet up with a specific player through the “Join Game” option of their profile, I load into the game over encumbered due to the wwr effect of my armor not working.  2) Accepting another player’s Xbox invite to join their world causes the same bug.
---
Glow sights should definitely be core of endgame build imo!
---
For those who just HAVE to lock their doors, please make one wall have a window and put a chair people can sit in on the other side or something that people can use to get outside.  
---
I typically have the pain of character loading in before the camp does so I get stuck in objects a LOT.
---
^ this. Plus build a stash right next to the core generator so you can get the cores, turn and dump into your stash in 2 secs flat then FT back to your camp.
---
I get this problem but only with my thirst for some reason  🤔
---
Taking and defending give you plans.
---
pvp is the point of survival, its not those who want to pvp
---
Pretty much the same here...
---
Was looking forward already last fall, even made a pre-order, but glad I canceled it in time. Now I saw a copy pop up for about 10€ on Amazon, I thought it might be a good time to give it a second chance.
---
Let's see how my adventures in Appalachia will work out, hopefully the disc arrives before the long weekend. See you ingame maybe...
---
This ain’t even an RPG is it
---
 u/PKOA . 120 members across all platforms and here to help and give.
---
There is one that spawns on the second floor in one of the houses in Whitespring Resort. It's the house just behind the firefighter place.
---
Because they weren't vault dwellers. Nobody is as good as a vault dweller.
---
Only a Fishchowdar would react like a fish, many thanks for taking the bait, hook, fishing line and copy of Fishermans weekly
---
And you're sure that no-one bought it? (You don't always get a popup notification of a sale... e.g. if you are fast travelling etc)
---
They don't exist at the time period of 76.
---
Thanks for that.
---
Probably should have gone with another title. My main idea was to tell a kinda funny story about my previous experience and the comeback.
---
Wasn't aware what kind of triggers this could activate...
---
That's the brotherhood way
---
That's really what people are spending these ludicrous prices on? That just doesn't make sense.
---
If I were complaining exclusively about rare stuff you'd have a point, but I'm not.
---
BLESS YOU CHILD!
---
Communism we SHARE, One does not OWN a workshop.
---
Really!? Now thats pretty awesome! Surprised Ive never encountered this grinding the whitesprings golf club! +1 well played Bethesda!
---
It doesn’t proc for me anymore as well. Thought it was bad rng up until a certain point – but no proc, not a single one the last 1k or so rounds.
---
Unbelievable...if they fear of pushing casual players away with pvp why dont they just make true pvp servers for those that actually want real pvp? Man making players visible in a pvp environment fails on so many levels...
---
I came to F76 with 9.0 and Im really liking it, but if youve played online games you immediately realize that Bethesdy has never made online games...
---
I once saw someone run away as soon as I initiated the capture...very slowly. So I hunted them down. Was like 1200 with pack rat but a lot of it was steel and wood.
---
Yes! It is an awesome gun the Bloodied LA, I have just the single star and I love it! Speed Demon is essential in my opinion for best results.
---
That Bloodied Handmade is going to be your new best friend! Congrats!!
---
So don't play it.  It's not the game for you.
---
Thanks for all the input. I'm going to see what happens with the used copies on amazon, and if anything goes wrong I'll complain and get my money back
---
So you just don’t enjoy the game. That’s fair, play a different game. This one is what it is
---
That will just make it so everyone tries to run in front of other people with explosive weapons and kite mobs to afk players to steal their guns.
---
When you find out you can steal that ultra rare BE Rifle somebody is holding the game suddenly becomes a battle royale.
---
Nobody is gonna be using a rifle they might not get in another 500 hours.. unless you literally make them god like so that there is actually some reason to use one.
---
Why use a rifle that only gets you 95% more dmg when it took 500 hours to find and you could lose it in seconds.
---
I also modded my fallout 4 so that mobs would almost one shot me, it was fun because if you died you would load another save.
---
Think of it in a way that you would play fallout 4 but if you died it would delete your save file, that's not casual fun because you are just paranoid 24/7 about dying.
---
Yup. Hardest part is placing the camp device like you said. 
---
Luckily there is a rowboat there I used
---
Damn, that's *really* early in the game to call it quits.
---
I think a part of the problem is that there are players who 'farm' items. They'll go a specific route every day around a number of places collecting rare loot then server hop and do it over and over again.  This ends up causing other players who may be quite happy to stay on the one server to have to server hop to get something they need for a quest, and now where they are causes another player to have to jump servers and so on and so on.
---
It really comes down to trying to convince players to not spend all their time hopping server to server vacuuming up everything in sight so players on other servers have a chance to visit locations.
---
Now this sounds like a proper idea.
---
I have 2 PS4s in the house due to my kids having one as well.  As of right now I use a whole bunch of alts to trade in legendaries for scrip from my main.  Then if I find anything good I can just trade back to my main.
---
 Since level 2 characters can get level 50 weapons from the vendor (not 100% of the time) it seems like the logical thing to do.
---
Food production workshop and 3 industrial water purifiers....boom, it's still mildly annoying lol
---
So because your country has roads and pavements make it socialist? Lol. Free market economies with social policies doesn't equate socialism. 
---
I obviously don't need to mention how well most of the true socialist societies are doing around the world, but obviously that's the evil capitalists interfering right?
---
yeah it is the pain we all had to go threw,
---
have you tried to ask for help to ppl on your server? 
---
and if you are in xbox, I am more than willing to help you, I know the struggle and it sucked.
---
It’s more of a fascination/wish the game would get better.
---
I’m not telling anyone they can’t enjoy the game.
---
Check out razorgrain soup
---
60 HP
---
20% food
---
30% water
---
Easy to plant and make...
---
So, I don't doubt this, it makes sense. But...
---
How would they not have been able to figure this out? It seems so obvious, especially from a programming standpoint.
---
&gt;  I’ve heard playing with other people isn’t exactly a necessity (although it does make the experience more fun apparently). 
---
Some people thinks it makes it more fun, some people thinks it makes it less fun.  It's a matter of taste.
---
(There are some things you must do with other people, but none of the main quest needs other people, just some additional achievements and challenges).
---
The mirrlurk queen is a pussycat...just vats crit the spouts first and the fight is already over...any of the "aura" mutations take care of the babies.
---
I'm calling Libert Prime.
---
I'm in the same boat as you her bud, very little time to play, maybe an hour at most a day ( and I mean at most) and have been a long time fan, I played the beta and decided it wasn't for me.
---
Wrong call to make, this is a game you have to give time to (even if it is spread thinly) levelling up and working how things work, I haven't ever had a problem with mobs being way too high because I'll just leave if they are.
---
Don't give up too early on as the lore (all be it only told through holotapes, terminals and the occasional bot) is very strong and intriguing, if anything additions to this game could shape future fallout titles (whether it be type of mob or play style), don't you want to stick around and see the direction of the franchise? 
---
If anything to honour the story that's been told over the years.
---
I didn't have a mic when I first started.  No mic appealed to my anti-social tendencies and the thought I was always play solo.
---
Teamed up with a IRL friend who also plays, realized it is a giant PITA to not have a mic.  Comes in quite handy.
---
Fallout 1, 2, Tactics, 3, New Vegas, 4, and 76 launch content were right for me. I guess I should abandon the franchise now that some numb nuts are trying to turn it into Rust, PUBG, and Fortnite. Or, maybe others should be asking for Fallout to succeed at being Fallout. Fallout 4 is estimated to have made 1.9 billion in profit.
---
Makes sense, I just hate growing food, some critter always wrecks it on me. Now I can just eat said critter.
---
I have my main, Amlin, since beta. Her perks age a bit of a mess due to me figuring things out as I went but she's a pretty effective heavy melee. She lives near whitesprings, and quite early on I had a camp I was so happy with that I didn't want to move so I created a second character to scratch my building itch. Unfortunately bethesda booted me from that location due to future content so Amlin had to move anyway but I found her a nice spot close by and I just tweak my camp every now and then.
---
My alt, Aveline, is also melee but unarmed / shotgun, and moves around the map regularly in search of interesting build spots and cool things to build.
---
Real Super Mutants neither, but....
---
I always plant my food indoors!
---
I love my plasma flamer, but you're right-the ammo grind is hell. I live on a copper node and combining that with a run of the satellite arrays and lucky hole only gets about 1200 cartridges, which goes a lot faster than your think. 
---
Still an absurdly fun weapon to play with.
---
Agreed. It gets easier as you level up and get a better grasp on the game. OP was probably swayed by the negative reviews early on, made one of those posts we all hate asking if he she play it yet, jumped in super late, and is now upset he’s out-leveled. Just play the game and level up or quit, no post necessary
---
My Bloodied Explosive Bolt Pipe Pistol is my current go to weapon. I have 1 level of each Riflemen perk cards along with gun slinger maxed out damage is almost 600. With level 3 sneak I can clear White Springs before any of the ghouls wake up from nap time.
---
I want to role play, explore the world as guided by quests, and survive. I feel that the game has all but abandoned these in favor of poor imitations of other online games. Fallout 76 is a follower when it should be a leader. Soon after completing the main quest line, this has become more work than game.
---
in early levels, a machete, fireaxe, and sniper rifle were my best friends.
---
Soemthing something death is preferable something something.
---
Ok boss, so what about lvl 100 fog crawler? :D
---
That’s cool, I tried not to sound shitty - s’all fair game.
---
You guys forgot me :( i watched your stream and told ya about my ps4 camp, havent heard back
---
Then stick your head in a microwave and eat some feces before you sit down to play. Hell, tear off your fingernails and breathe in some ash instead of sitting in a comfortable chair slamming sodas and huffing cheeto dust. Go immerse yourself. Get immersed.
---
Ya I've seen the concept applied, but my camp building is non-condusive to an indoor grow op. I live in between two trees on a cliff face, not alot of dirt...
---
Ok so the world is separated into Cells. Or areas. And when someone arrives in that cell it populates the cell with loot. Then it removes loot that player has picked up recently.
---
So I will be farming lead and I go to Charlestown fire Dept. If I'm quick all the lead will have spawned in but I won't be able to pick it up. And it quickly disappears. This is because I've been server hopping and grabbing the shit.
---
If someone populates the cell before I get there and they didn't touch the lead then I can grab it.
---
I believe it resets after a day.
---
These are my onservations.
---
You need to attach something to update status of grid...when I attach laser turret fusion core generator starts worling
---
You just need some dirt with a hill, and a rug!
---
500hrs with a lvl 210, 103, 86, 81 and 42
---
been there ,but , are you in areas, well above your level and attempting quests that would be best to wait till higher level ?
---
NOT telling you what to do, just asking.
---
15 - 25 , this game can heat up ,real fast. Can work to your advantage as well.
---
And dailies. My beta char can't get any swamp dailies, And on savage divide only pumkin house daily is available
---
If you are on PS4 I could help you level up quick.
---
Ya, I've seen that too, but looks super trash in my opinion. I go to great lengths to make my camp look reasonably realistic.
---
You are far more generous than me. They would have got a warning shot across the bow, then a shit storm of bullets. I don’t take their stuff and would offer them some of the bounty though......
---
Totally forgot lol
---
Nah, true capitalism would be if he paid someone else 50 caps to acquire it for him.
---
ty
---
I hope you're wrong too and I've had much different results.  Got this quest while I had about 20 tech data in my stash, turned them all in and got three paint plans which I thought was really good (luck was at 8 with no perks).  Got the BoS resistant lining and since then I've turned in about 25 with no paint drops.  So now I'm not sure if they stopped dropping or if I was just extra lucky with that first 20.
---
I'm L98 (melee), and have only changed out a couple of perks since about L65.
---
Why continue?    Because there's so much to do (and so much I still haven't done.)
---
XB1
---
It's suggested to stay in the forest when you are low level like that. Explore there and don't be in a hurry to finish the quests. Some are not meant for a level 19 to be doing. If you're rushing the questline then expect higher enemies.
---
Hi there! I have 2 points in Endurance and Good Doggy takes up one of them, very underrated Perk imho.
---
From everything I’ve read and personally experienced, you get the primary, major then minor effects in order. I’ve never gotten a minor effect on a 1 or 2 star legendary.
---
But i need razorgrain for alcohol... and it floats all over the place :/ 
---
Thx for the tip tho
---
It's not even the lack of food and drink, like that stuff is abundant, I end up dropping a lot of mine as freebies next to my vending machines. It's just the near constant going in and out of my pip boy to cycle through the list and tap A a couple times.
---
Never found it to be much of a hindrance until the recent patch that's causing spoiled meat to now give me Diseases, even with the Carnivore Mutation, now I'm also burning through Antibiotics like crazy.
---
The quality (or health) of a crafted items is tied to int.
---
Whats better AAE or TSE
---
Great observation. In the meantime, feed the people is a great way to stock up on meat stews that give you 50% food and don't spoil.
---
Well I’m a level 125 and a level 243 took the Grafton Steel Yard from me by pretending to help defend against ghouls then peppering me with a mini gun *and claimed my death bag with 400 steel and a horde of other stuff.*
---
Joke’s on him, I was out of stash space and had nowhere to put that crap anyway. 
---
Thanks, friend!
---
I'm positive I have gotten tech data off of two different level 3 safes.  I know one was in the Pleasant Valley Cabin area and I thought the other was somewhere in White Springs.
---
Yes but they are currently not in the loot table until Beth reworks the effect on them. You occasionaly see People running around with explosive energy weapons, these are old though.
---
That seems like a lazy answer. Will you keep playing for very long after you have a TSE shotgun and Sentinel armor or whatever? What's the point without content?
---
Really?
---
Fallout 4 made an estimated 1.4 billion. Please explain why this should be "what it is" so it can be less successful.
---
Apparently, the Iguanas in Appalachia all reside in lunchboxes, eh?
---
Sorry. I figured it out and deleted this post but Reddit shut down for maintenance and it remained.
---
Speaking theoretically here, would this work? As you're essentially shooting a piping hot ball of energy there would be no way to case any sort of explosives within the round because they're is no shell.
---
Realistically the closest you could get and still be true to the working of the weapon would just be a plasma grenade launcher.
---
Worked for me yesterday.
---
I actually noticed I forgot that a few days after initially posting it a few weeks back and you're the first person to mention it. My bad for forgetting it, I know there was quite a negative reaction but for what it was I thought it was good.
---
exactly, they already have the models in place., just make them only accessible by the owner.
---
No Man's Soy: Actual Beef
---
They do not exist they never had the chance to spawn as explosives weapons
---
Never been any, it never came in the pool of legendaries that weapon had n then when it could Bethesda stopped all laser weaponry to have that prefix in a patch
---
Then simply don’t use your precious weapons when you know that you risk to die. If you walk with something precious in a post apocalyptic world do you expect people to smile and wave at you? Shit like this doesn’t even happen in real life, let alone in a wasteland. If it’s too hardcore for you then stick with adventure or play Sims.
---
Good Job kind Sir, 
---
I like finding Low level players with a Workshop, if they have a Mic, and don't run away, I will team up with them and build some Heavy Duty Defenses so the Raiders get an unexpected surprise when they come to steal.
---
WOW!!!
---
That's incredible!!!
---
Bethesda should have a Best Camp Contest that earns the winner the uber rare Architect Possum Badge!
---
this.
---
Not should be. It currently just is the game that it currently is. It’s not as popular, that’s not arguable, that’s a fact. If they wanted similar profit they should have made a similar game, you’re right. But for what it is, it’s actually super fun and enjoyable for a lot of people. Me included. Sure I loved 3, NV, and 4 with probably a combined 1000 hrs total between the three. But 76 has been more fun for me due to the player base and friendliness of the community. Plus you never know what to expect on a day to day basis. I could go on forever about why I like 76 more than the others, but having almost 1000hrs in 76 alone says it all for me. 
---
Should they have made it different for better sales, yes. But they didn’t and this is what we have.
---
Hey that was me last night!
---
Your welcome... :)
---
So I put player vending as my favorite thing but the reasons why didn't really line up with it and there was no option to enter my own answer. I chose "new locations" because I enjoy visiting other people's camps
---
You just keep repeating the same set of quests without questioning if/when some new DLC is going to show up.
---
Hmm, I just don’t understand what would be the tangible or visible (whatever) result of having higher or lower intelligence. With, say, strength and agility you can see the actual result of high or low. Thank you though.
---
Why don’t you just favorite a couple items that you have a lot of? I have purified water and canned dog food on my favorites and takes 10 secs to refill whenever.
---
This is a great bit of feedback mate, I'll be closing the survey in a few hours and posting the results so I'd say copy and paste this there. Beth' might see it then :)
---
But I can still equip those cards and they work.
---
Todd said the game is in a much better state now then when it launched... So it's ok.
---
Whats ur set up for it?
---
Stick to the forest there's plenty to do there and it's all pretty easy. If you want to level quickly take workshops and defend them. For maybe at the most 10 minutes tops you get +500xp, some aid loot and plans to boot. 76 isn't a quick game in any way, it's all about soaking up time.
---
You are 100% right about that.
---
I saw concept art for them in fallout 4 and I was so upset that they didn't make it. 76 would be great for them even if they have to retcon them in.
---
Sir - this is claiming with style. 
---
Kind of Gentleman like...
---
Have my up against the downvoting non readers.
---
Ammo works fine for me. What I'm wondering is if they silently took out it activating when making bulk junk because I haven't been able to get it to work for about two months now
---
Correct, just have a high enough INT to equip multi star perks
---
I always craft until it procs then back out of the wb and go back into crafting again to rinse/repeat. I found that for me, that reset my Super Duper and it was able to proc again.
---
Yes, which is good. A cap sink is supposed to get money out of the economy, now it does it even more and better. Works well and as intended. No need to fiddle with it.
---
Fo4 doubled the number of players by catering to consoles with a shooter instead of rpg. single player 76 if you will. 
---
Very little room for rpg in that game... To many its by a large margine the worst in the series.
---
But simple shooters works well with consoles. And many ppl are serious when they say they dont like online games... They don't play them. That much is obvious when they ask "why am i starting here' i quit in that building" and "will there be any loot left for me" and other stupid questions. So in short f04 was suposto be just like 76 but it ended up being Preston garvy in a over stuffed over simplified game.
---
I'm only lvl63 on this toon, but some lvl28 dude came at me trying to contest my workshop. I FT to it and gave him the thumbs up to let him know he could take it, dropped some extra plans, turned around and he shot me in the back as I walked away. It was very rude and slightly uncool.
---
good question. if you say eat food/drink- -something that increases your int ,-- what does it actually do ?
---
ie strenth.. well you can see your carry weight go up and the melee damage rise  - 
---
int, luck.........??????
---
Lol. Thanks.
---
The XP requirements are the same from 50-99 (7880 XP), and from 100-999 (15880 XP), and 1000 on (159880 XP), if I remember correctly.
---
This was from a post a couple of months back! May have changed slightly! (All credit to reaver_revolver)
---
It's working fine for me, ammo/chems/food/crafting. They muted the sounds when it procs in an earlier patch, and it now only shows the animation after you leave the bench. With server lag, it may not display the animation until well after you're done crafting.
---
Want to add a quote from a while ago which sums it up
---
**"...it's like going into a bookclub and brag about how you can outlift them."**
---
So you dont like the game, but you feel the need to complain about it...
---
Bye Felicia
---
I have purified water and glowing meat steaks on the quickwheel usually
---
The more money you have in circulation, the more money that things will cost. You think it’s bad now that people want 25k for legendaries? It’d be 200x worse if there wasn’t a Cap limit. So no, I don’t think everyone would agree that we should eliminate the limit.
---
Believe someone pulled the xp curve
---
When you run out of something you then have to reset it in the hotwheel again and I generally have a mix of stuff for the bonuses but due to the expiration rate on food/drinks there's no point of carrying them in bulk as I already have a tonne of spoiled material.
---
Roam around toxic valley, you will find lots of fallen trees/logs.
---
Clipboards (wood and a spring)
---
pencil (wood and lead)
---
 lots of scorched at wavy willards, steel from their weapons.
---
The morgantown airport event for more scorched and weapons to scrap ... and lots of first aid kits in the hangars.
---
At your camp, a small purifier, or the hand pump.  Make corn, razorgrain, or carrot soup, as those 3 provide both food and water.
---
Get the good doggy perk, and pick up canned dog food.
---
Props. . . If only others would do the same lol. I too used to leave my door to my bedroom and decon shower locked. But now with the camp rules, I see no harm in leaving everything available to anyone to use. Just kind of weird nowadays for someones entire base to be locked down. Really no reason for it, other than to invite trouble lol.
---
I havent even done 10% of the main questline. Lv28 character, and ive owned since christmas. there just isnt really anything in this game to keep me coming back.
---
On FO4 i loved having loads of different settlements that i could differentiate, dont get that with camp sadly
---
Also, hot. Tight. Spandex uniforms... Oh yeah baby, you ready to be disciplined by the brotherhood?
---
Yeah, it needs more eccentric robot characters.
---
Yeah... call me "civilian" in a condescending tone again baby!
---
Get this man an upvote!
---
currently I do not.. ive been waiting for another 2x XP event to start a second...
---
Chasing obscure legendaries, testing out new builds and optimizing current ones to your playstyle, developing trade strategies, helping other players, grinding for rare skins and fringe stat bonuses, gaining notoriety in the community, fucking around with friends and meeting new players, stockpiling supplies for future content.
---
If none of that appeals to you, at that point you should just find a different game.
---
Nah mate, thank you for sharing!
---
So what do i grind for then? Weapons im never gonna use? Or do i perhaps just camp whitesprings and spawn kill anyone with my tse laser hoping to get the best guns.
---
This is not Ark or rust, this is an rpg.
---
Is it fun that in a game with so broken pvp mechanics literally everyone would try to murder you to steal your guns.
---
And i have to ask? Do you have any super rare weapons and how long have you played? If you have, drop the best one or give it away. If you can't do it then why do you suggest that we would want that feature.
---
Oh damn. I am indeed a solo player. Any tips?
---
The gear you find and craft will have a bigger condition bar the higher the intelligence. And you get more mats and a higher chance to learn mods through scrapping with higher intelligence.
---
What are you on about?
---
civilized transactions like this would occur more often on PC if we had some sort of messaging mechanic
---
Do you know of carnivore boosts cannibal as well?
---
Hand over that toaster Civilian, it's too dangerous for your feeble mind.
---
^ this!!!!!!!!
---
I’ve already provided feedback to Bethesda two times about this!
---
Please people, ask for changes, examples:
---
- Option to always show the meters (so we don’t have to press buttons all the time)
---
- Option to automatically feed/eat (never gonna happen in our lifetime)
---
- Option to disable this super boring mechanism
---
This could be an opportunity, sell us some Atomic shop item that does things automatically or something.
---
But more important, deactivate this shit during combat!!!!!!!
---
If player is in combat
---
Deactivate hunger
---
Deactivate thrust
---
End if
---
PLEASE Bethesda! Thanks!
---
It's tragic they buried that since the settlements were a foundation of the attempted fallout 4 multiplayer component. I've spent countless hours building amazing settlements in FO4, not at all possible in 76
---
You do realize that just the base FO4 game was roughly **560 million** lines of code, right? Fo76 isn't going to be smaller.
---
That's a lot of Ctl+F for their 1 intern.
---
Make a thread here and post your console/pc and ask people to help you:)
---
Hey don't you guys have CAMP? Herbivore for me is the easiest, i always have a bunch of corn soup.
---
Ya I give away super low lvl Legendarys to them as my way of giving back. Gave a lvl 20 AAE Gatling gun away yesterday. Little guy seemed pretty pumped.
---
Right. Technically, I really only need 5 in intelligence so I can equip gunsmith or makeshift warrior. I’m not saying I want go that low, but one can do that without suffering major consequences, right?
---
It’s kill a “critter” while starving. Brahmin, beavers, squirrels etc. Critters are considered to be the animals that aren’t generally aggressive toward you. 
---
I used a Brahmin in Flatwoods.
---
Man that makes no sense. So dude and his friends level my camp because I fired back, and then he gets to sit in his base and I can't do anything back? That's not what survival was supposed to be! I wanted my revenge lol.
---
[Here’s an example. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/EHIsGYk) the shotty was found with 1 or 2 points in intelligence, the Buzzblade was found with 23 intelligence.
---
Faith in humanity restored. 
---
Life seems better not that the people who are feeling ...?... "aggressive" can go play Survivor mode
---
You can jump through a wall in the bunker under Whitesprings. There's a ledge under the map you can land on and look around or miss and fall, spawn, fall ect...
---
The maximum possible output within a single build is achieved usually mid70ties if you don't go with powerbuild in mind since level1.
---
But its just a single build. You can gain flexibility to change what yo use, you need about 20-30 levels for all crafting perks, you might want to respec your special which costs one level per point moved since you pass level 50.
---
Radstags work too.
---
Exactly. Also like endurance. *shrugs shoulders*
---
Nice. Good for you too.
---
The funny thing is they are so worried that we are going to do something bad with... build a building that is too tall or floats.. what does it matter.. If no one can't get in your base they can't get in.. ok.. but they keep messing up the camp system to enforce these rules that would not have a neg effect on game play for others.
---
Now stacking the concrete blocks. I get that. a few of my bases were fast travel into only. My last base was one of those mushrooms off the ground with a removable staircase. I was a big offender of that!
---
W/carnivore you *should* be able to eat meat that's a week old w/no problem.
---
I have the exploding plasma Gatling, exploding gauss, and Tesla so find it strange that the plasma rifle was left out. (My Fallout experience has always been with a Plasma Rifle!) Thanks for the input. 👍🏻
---
Ya, hate managing crops, critters ruin, now I eat critters.
---
You change one thing and it’s changes fifteen other things. Is it possible? Yes. Easy? Not by a long shot, but they can do it if they dedicate the time and resources to it.
---
I think they've probably done it as a design choice for moving faster increasing metabolism but it's not actually seen as a negative by Bethesda but rather a compromise
---
great idea!
---
It’s not just 556.  It’s any bullet or shell.  The market would suggest 1 cap each yet some sellers insist on selling them for 2 or more caps each.
---
Nice illustration !
---
10 mm round is good, but a wood scrap or fertilizer would be better for the [turf and twig ceremony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livery_of_seisin)
---
Ah nice discovery. 
---
If it’s listed as a positive effect is Class Freak boosting the +50% food/drink and causing our food/drink bar to lower even quicker?
---
*"immersion-breaking gimpy floating eyesores"*
---
lol we dont seem so crazy now do we? maybe now you will realize WHY some of us use those floating eyesores
---
I can ask a player to help you on doing that.
---
I just lucked up a random player ask me to help so I rad up to keep my health low because of healing factor mutation and jump of a house and he returned the favor by grenadine him self.
---
I also don’t remember switches giving off power radius.  But then, it’s not something that I paid attention to as I don’t have a setup that turns off lights.  But I agree that it should not give off a power radius.
---
The one switch that I have is to the garage door and that’s in parallel to pressure plates.  If it’s turned off, then the pressure plates are active.  If it’s turned on, then the garage door is kept open.
---
It seems to not make you not get sick from eating corpses and improves hunger recovery, hard to say on health tho.
---
I agree, this game might not be for you. 
---
It’s not a game to duck in and out of. Some missions take allot of time to complete. having to scavenge for materials is a basic premise of the game and also managing food and water. The story telling is expansive and I am a longtime fan. 76 brought me back to gaming after almost a ten tour break.
---
That hasn't happened yet by the time of Fallout 76 - no one knows where these iguana bits are coming from.
---
Is that why some of the condition bars are longer than others??? I didn’t know that.
---
I'm sorry that the game turned out not to be to your personal tastes. Obviously what the developers set out to create isn't something which is congruent with the types of games that you tend to enjoy. Not every game is going to be for everyone.
---
Well I’ve got lead belly to help with the rads, but better hunger recovery does sound nice but given that I eat all my enemies during gun fights I just need to know if it does heal more so I can switch over.
---
Awesome
---
Coolio
---
It needs the rads.
---
The Gun Runners Arsenal form FONV was the most useful dlc ever. It brought so many cool weapons to the game, and I really missed them in FO4 and 76. I know the combat rifle is a fake BAR, but it's weird there's not a garand/mosin/kar98 style rifle in game.
---
Have them be effected by one handed melee perks and let us make sneak attacks with them.  Done.
---
I use an instigating lever rifle as a stealth rifleman build and can one shot most things, for endgame stuff I also carry a two shot explosive handmade with a drum mag for the big baddies but mostly try to clear adds or do objective type stuff if there is any (like filling the feeders in the newest event) so other players can go to town with their bloodied builds.
---
Wholesome raid :)
---
This isn't Fallout 5. They weren't setting out to create another Fallout 4. They set out to create a different type of game with a different type of gameplay. They wanted to try something new and different. If that's not to your tastes, that's perfectly fair. There's other games out there.
---
At 22, roam around the toxic valley for a while.  The western side of the divide Palace of the wind is doable if no high levels have not been around - (enemies scale there).
---
Lots of XP to be had at Grafton steel and the prison.
---
From the toxic valley, you can go over to both Red rocket and the pumpkin house if no high levels have been around.  
---
If you value your life, do not go farther south than the pumpkin house. 
---
I did my first WS run @ L27.  I had a vampire melee weapon.  and lots of radx, radaway, and stimpacks. 
---
At 30, head towards the ash heap and pick up the excavator quest.
---
On the way, be sure visit riverside manor...and clear the mining HQ in Charleston.
---
Its more complicated. They limited maximum damage per tick of damage. This means that if you shoot from sniper rifle its maximum 190 damage per shot, but if you shoot from laser rifle with beam splitter mod (many 'projectiles'), then its maximum 190 per 'projectile'.
---
yea you have to go into the options and change it, sometimes it even reverts with out me knowing and I end up wanted at Queen fights lol.
---
Yep, 1 INT is fine imo as long as you are ok with buying mods instead of crafting them.
---
Weapon artisan and +50% durability is not a concern except for explosive ones to me, carry one extra ranged and melee and you’re good to go wherever for however long you want.
---
I am a very casual player as well, been paying since November and just hit level 41. I stuck to the forest area for the most part and did the main story up til I met Rose. At level 35 I finally went and started that back up. 
---
Gain experience by joining the events on the west side and just discovering locations. I’d say you can probably go as south as Camden Park and be fine. You should get some side quests you can do as well. 
---
But yea I’d just work on my camp design and go exploring to level up for quite awhile lol
---
Bring it!!  
---
I visited a camp last night by WS and some tool had his entire place locked up + punji boards all around it.  They were there too so I gave them like 20 thumbs down emotes.
---
It depends on what kind of player you are. If making sure that your math is 100% maximized I’m damage is most important, then you probably want to go for many of the single build suggestions that are here.
---
I enjoyed the option to do many different things, sometimes changing my entire set up based on what weapon I come across. It can be frustrating, and certainly when I am in situations where people are one shouting and I’m not, I’m aware of the gulf, but like you and like everybody else I play For my definition of fun
---
I'll give that a try. Thank you. 
---
In my native language it just says creature
---
Right!? I love that perk but if it closes out when you kill something how’s it gunna click to the next enemy. I hope they just means it’ll close out when you’ve killed the last enemy in range.
---
I have all the obscure legendaries I could ever need. I have the ultimate build for my play style. Trade is therefore meaningless. I play solo because cross platform play is not allowed and my friends can't afford high end gaming pc's. I always help other players who I never see again. Don't care about rare skins, paints, or whatever since I play first person. Can't stockpile because of stash limits.
---
Maybe try "The Forest" and I think Bethesda should too.
---
I liked Marcy.. "How were those Mirelurks? hmmm.."
---
"Well, that does not sound like fun...."
---
"I have another topic for my book.... Are you interested? This one is a simple one.... I want you to run up to a Scorched Beast and pet him, then I'm sure he would let you collect a scale sample...."
---
Could not agree with you more! ...and yes, ever since they let the whacko's run free in Survivor mode "our" world seems to have cleaned itself up.
---
Not even legacy versions?
---
Excellent work. More testing is undoubtedly needed but yeah I think you've probably got it worked out.
---
I like it :)
---
ah why do i have to be at work!&gt;!&gt;?!&gt;!&gt;!&gt;!
---
First time seeing this being recommended. Good suggestion, lol
---
Yes, all those things I mentioned and more are socialist policies. No, I did not say America is a socialist nation. But nice demonstration of willful ignorance, though.
---
Some lvl 10 bought some stuff at my store and I did 2 things for him:
---
- A super pump action shotgun
---
- A super Sniper, .38 receiver included
---
Funny thing is I had to chase him and do the “come” emote because he didn’t understand the gift one.
---
Until someone comes along and ceases your means of production back.
---
I have a mic but I prefer party chat so I can talk to people I know.
---
It's not new and different if it starts as fallout 4.5, then degenerates into Rust, PUBG, and Fortnite. It becomes less than any of the above.
---
I have a couple of good weapons, the best being a TSE Handmade I wouldn’t really want to loose. But for this exact reason you’re being encouraged to play much more carefully and tactically. Scout the area for dangers (both NPCs and players) and you calculate the approach you want to take. Is it really necessary for me to engage every mob Rambo style? If so can I do it with mediocre weapons I don’t mind losing? If not am I confident/safe enough to use the best gear? 
---
But of course, before implementing such harsh penalties there needs to be some changes like fixing crucial bugs (invisible enemies, slow loading time), you know those bugs that can kill you unfairly and wanted players must have higher bounties and losing that amount of caps when killed. So if someone loots your bag or kills you out of the blue they will become wanted with a bounty of +100 caps per crime to discourage them from doing what you stated above. And/or you can kill them back and take your stuff + theirs.
---
Most of the ones you pick up out in the world are irradiated, which is what the recipe calls for, and they are pretty plentiful out in the world, here are a few locations that should get you plenty each day;
---
* Flatwoods Church Steeple (3)
---
* Flatwoods Red Rocket Roof (2-3)
---
* White Springs Back Road near Presidential Cottage (4 in boxes along road) (2 on porches) (1-2 in Presidential Cottage)
---
* White Springs Laundry (1-2)
---
* White Springs Golf Club (2-3)
---
There are quite a few to be found in the Enclave Bunker, but they aren't the irradiated ones which makes sense for those concerned about Lore.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Yes. I’ll keep at least 5 for gunsmith and makeshift warrior, and, as a consequence, Weapons Artisan. I also need three more for batteries not included, so I can haul my 40 fusion cores around :)
---
great find, lets hope they read it! :)
---
Full unyeilding with 3 + strength pieces, shielded urban scout under armor with +3 strength, radicool, and I can't think of everything else right now.
---
The game started out to be exactly to my tastes, but some executive changed the direction.
---
Here are the voice actors
---

Instigating 50 crit
---
Why are you doing quests? The rewards scale to your level. Stop doing quests until level 50!
---
The one from FONV Old World Blues actually was.
---
Nope
---
Nope if they buff all the monsters and make the game harder people will just bitch and say Bethesda is doing it so you can go to the atom stop shop or some dumb shit like that
---
Think about it for a moment, the BOS tried to kill the SBQ before they buffed energy and heavy weapons. All of their laser/plasma/Gatlings broke mid-fight, they didn't have repair kits in world yet, and they were using VATS IN power armor, so their fusion cores all ran out. 
---
They got slaughtered.
---
If you don't care about events and challenges and loot grinding, then you're just playing the wrong game, since so much of what makes the game fun and engaging comes from those things. It's like telling me "I don't care about soccer balls, soccer nets or soccer teams. Tell me why I should want to play a soccer based game." The short answer is "You shouldn't. It's not for you." 
---
But the rest of us are enjoying it a great deal. I'm sorry that you wound up playing a game that turned out not to be to your personal tastes. 
---
Not everything is about you.
---
OP was not swayed by early reviews. In fact I bought it on release and defended it vehemently against the exact people you described. I just don’t think you should be out levelled by players that you aren’t partied with that happen to be in the vicinity.
---
According to this : [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)
---
Two Shot Explosive  - 1407.00 Damage per second
---
Furious explosvie - 1632.12 Damage per second (factoring max hits on enemy to boost up the furious)
---
In my opinion, furious is only worth it on fast fire rate or automatic weapons.
---
It’s easier to just remove all the cheesy perks we all use.
---
Remember when you started? Remember ghouls? Yeah that’s right.
---
lol
---
I feel the need to ask other players to request something more. Bye meme
---
I just want to play Fallout, I don’t want to talk to anyone.
---
That why you leave the game always in the way it was meant to be played, English.
---
Salutations from Portugal.
---
I wouldnt mind it if I could set up an eating and drinking priority so that it would auto consume what I want consumed, in the order I want it consumed automatically.  My job would be to make sure I have gathered food/water and consume it manually when desired. Shit, EQ had this feature back in 1999.
---
I don't believe that's correct.
---
Exactly. When I craft or mod I use Unyielding armor and eat a Betty mentats to boost the condition bar. And it’s nice to find legendary gear with a high condition bar.
---
I don’t think I’m in areas above my level. I’m following roses quests. This is where the story has lead me.
---
Is lead super desireable? How much does it sell for? 
---
Asking because my camp is build with a lead extractor, didnt realise it was valuable.
---
Lol.
---
Any possible conclusions drawn from your name aside, I could not disagree more whole-heartedly. The few jerks that i met before ruined my day. Being nice is ....well .... it's NICE to be nice! LOL There's too much crap in the world with everyone beating their chest saying "These people have to go or leave or they are wrong and bad because they don't pray to the same imaginary friend I do, or look the same etc etc etc ".... There is quite enough hate and messy sticky tar based cancer riddled bullshit leaving stains that are hard to wash off as it is. We don't need it here.
---
^ this
---
Not everyone enjoys that kind of build, I’m one of them, there’s other perks to enjoy.
---
I would level up to 50 and learn the mechanics of the game better, maybe even follow some higher levels around and tag legendary enemies. Also get you caps maxed out by selling random stuff to the vendor every day. Get some mutations to make you stronger. So many things you are just not seeing yet, same happened with me, im lvl 185 and still learning new stuff.
---
Out of curiosity, how much do you sell Royal Jelly for? I have a couple of spare and I'm not sure what a fair price is. I know it's rare and I should be setting the price higher than the default price, but not sure how high to go.
---
Sounds super, higher gives no benefit.
---
Agree.  Its needless fiddling.
---
Maybe it is bugged then, I'm only going by my personal findings regarding the behemoth so I figured it would be the same with the Queen, maybe I have killed her then but I guess I'll never know
---
If I happen to be in camp, and you buy something, I will thank you (area mic).
---
  Sometimes, you will benefit from an unadvertised sale, or even a 2 for 1 special, as I may have more of whatever you bought.   I'll ask you to wait a minute, then I'll paper bag drop more of whatever it was you just bought.
---
But -  I don't constantly monitor my camp and fast travel back every time someone stops by.  That's a bit intrusive to both the visiting player and my own gameplay.
---
✋ 🤷‍♂️, 🤦‍♂️👎.
---
True... however. Brain bombs require 3. So with all of the locations they have a static spawn you can only make 2 to 5 brain bombs and server going for world items like this doesnt work anymore. So it's still ridiculously hard to keep them on hand. There is no reason normal sugar bombs shouldn't work.
---
Ya it's a bummer, same thing happens with PA. But as unpleasant as it is, it kinda lends to the whole apocalyptic theme. Like that some places you might go to are just a full on bust. But I do understand ur frustration. My advice is to diversify, get a few other hot ticket items that are perhaps easier to obtain. Or don't worry so much about keeping a consistent stock. I personally find the discount legendary business to be rather lucrative.
---
This is dumb
---
Can traps really kill you in adventure more? Besides Catapults?
---
False. My PvP set is gathered for 20k. My main weapon is good, but was never the prime target for majority of the players. I use zero sentinel pieces. I formed a group and each of the members who joined me started with assassin sentinels and after playing with me sold their armors and switched to variations of what I play with. I play the game legitly and with accessible items and I still rock hard at PvP, with my group we can fight a good fight against anyone, including most notorious PvPers that get hackusated for their performance. 
---
What the game needs is its playerbase appreciating all the things that are in the game that are not assassin sentinel TSEs. Right now the 'path to greatness' for many people is to hate sentinel because you don't have it, then obtain it and learn that you still die, then complain the game is broken because they're behind the meta.
---
Get yourself a bloodied 1* automatic combat rifle, 1x regenerating, 1x assassin, 1x chameleon, 2x unyielding pieces. Go for sneaky commando build, and if you have access to better items try to get +50% vats crit on your rifle, and 3x AP Refresh +3x Harder to detect while sneaking armor. This will absolutely be enough to PvP with 1* items and correct build, AP refresh and sneak just makes it easier to 1v3 people. If items are the only barrier that stand between you and PvP even with all the items you'll still loose.
---
The candy is from an event called Monster Mash at the Watoga High School.
---
I'm the same with my Xbox One consoles (two in different rooms), so I'm thinking maybe I'll do the same, use an alt for storage, maybe try the Survival out.
---
I didn't know what I was expecting when I clicked on this post, but I'm so glad I did.
---
*Whispers in your ear* "Ad Victoriam Brother"
---
Super Duper is working fine on Ammo for me (on XB1), I made a few thousand rounds of Ultracite .50 &amp; .308 last night, I only see/hear it proc the 1st time, then again when I exit the crafting menu, but my crafted quantities suggest it procs a full 30% of the time.
---
Lack of materials is not my issue. Nor are the hunger/thirst mechanics. It’s enemies scaling up to unmanageable levels because of the presence of higher level players in the general vicinity that is the issue.
---
Yea idgaf the lgbt is everywhere as is don’t need it put in my face in fallout lore
---
Any free PC code?
---
Thanks. Sadly I can only see it happening via mods, assuming it's even possible.
---
You're right about the consolization of FO4, but the settlements were hardly well geared towards consoles as demonstrated by console vs pc settlement designs. My role playing was satisfied by majestic settlements that my console friends marvelled at.  Aside from that, I played the way I wanted to and am proud of the world I created. In 76, I feel like it's about collecting a certain number of things, killing a certain number of things, or grinding to find as specific legendary combo. Who cares.
---

Good luck
---
I wish bugs and balance were higher priorities...
---
I still have copies of them all; except for the hanging ribbons, I only ever found 1 of that.
---
They're pricy though, I have them for 2k+ at the moment.
---
I think I'm about 3-4 plans (damn you, disco ball) from having every camp plan in the game (including whitesprings, excluding Atom items).
---
hey at least you had a unique experience! and good on you for not raging on reddit!
---
sorry someone took your bag though
---
I made a big maze at whitesprings, but no traps, alot of people get on mic before running it to ask me if there are traps, it seems they too might have been "burned" before...
---
Ass victorium.
---
Correct, you should never get diseases from any meat, but since the last patch spoiled meat (my go to food source) frequently gives me diseases.
---
It was a joke this is said at least three times everyday on this sub. Bethesda already said they have plans to implement it.
---
Man, where were you two days ago when I needed this for the candy daily challenge. The wiki is woefully underinformed.
---
Gonna note this for the future.
---
I started three days after release and was already out levelled. The fact that I play 4-5 hours a week didn't help. Just do the events in the forest area, and run when you need to. Soon you'll cross 25 and then game will suddenly become immensely easy. I don't even have any specific build yet: just maxed out strength and not even all ranks of the 2-handed perk, and I can completely decimate high level ghouls and muties in 1-2 shots. I don't even use any bloodied or explosive or any other OP meta weapon, just the level 50 All Rise. Once you cross 20 the Savage Divide should be easy enough to take on. Also, don't be afraid to die. Keep stashing your junk and even if it takes 3 tries to kill a particularly strong Yao Guai, do it. 76 offers a much more realistic rendition of the Wasteland where you don't breeze through the game no matter what you do.
---
Buddy I can't even tell you why to continue living after 25 or so.
---
Now you can, gnome'sayin.
---
I think the laser pistol you get from the BoS is higher than 15, but I could be wrong.
---
I don't remember what level the laser snipers the mutants carry.
---
What other explanation is there for loving 100 hours into a game then everything else turning into bullet sponge grinding challenge achievement event nothingness?
---
Did you eat a body?
---
I wish bugs and balance were higher priorities..
---
Makes hacking easier, the higher your int the less wrong choices appear in the terminal.
---
Presented well. I thought I disagreed before I read all of your post.. then I voted up.
---
None of those. TS screws with aiming, and AA reduces DR by 50%, the problem is that explosive weapons are explosive not ballistic and are not calculated against DR.
---
AA25, BE, B25, B50, and certian QE /Q25 weapons are prime PvP choices.
---
I've got your back on that one
---
I would argue that the quests shouldn’t be available if you need to be that level to complete them.
---
Didnt think of that. Thanks boss! :)
---
Worked fine last night.
---
Just dont do the fetch quests, im grateful for something to do
---
Yes, I guess they can.  I didn't even think about it until it actually happened to me.  I'm in Adventure mode and Pacifist is on but they got me regardless.
---
I am the Op of that post , only update I got was a generic automated response about not being able to replace the item , and it’s being forwarded to the Devs
---
1) I am generally in a Team.  As such, the Audio setting for 'Auto' means my mic only works to communicate with people on My Team.  Opening the setting menu and changing this value to Area just to have a random conversation is not worth it.  Then when I am done chatting, I need to go manually swap back to Team/Auto?   No thank you.
---
2) This is what Text Chat channels should be utilized for.  Area Chat, Trade Chat, LFG, etc.
---
The ones at White Springs seem to re-spawn frequently, I pick them up all the time and seem to get 20 or more each few hours of game play. I make a lot of Sweet Rolls &amp; Brain Bombs.
---
That’s very true. I spend so little time hacking though. I noticed there is a LOT less hacking in this FO than in the past FOs.
---
Does the same principle apply to legendary items purchased from purveyor mmmumrumohmurph?
---
Probable hasn’t loaded in yet wait a bit.
---
NIIICEE !!
---
WHAT
---
Also, play the rest of the questing. I think it's the best part.
---
Of course! Good luck getting your back pack !
---
Thanks for your reply, do you think it's worth trading my Gauss for a Two Shot Explosive Gauss?
---
Sometimes I have to wait or server hop
---
I cut the value in half and sell that, everything is balanced that way and I still get to be greedy for coins :3
---
If you're on PC I'll come buy every .308 you have plus a bunch of 5.56.
---
ESO is not their (Bethesda Game Studios) game, and I’d argue that if they want to implement faction dynamics, they should be doing it within Adventure and Survival itself, and not creating a whole new mode for it if that’s what Nuclear Winter is about.
---
You should hold onto it next time! Sometimes there’s a daily where you have to eat candy
---
Sadly no, the Lore is spun around the point that you got your vaccine before ever getting to see a scorchebeast.
---
fo76 is not that kind of a game.
---
Done! How could you not have the option to NPCs? ;)
---
Radscorpions already hit that primal fear spot in my brain, along with yao guai
---
I'll buy all your .556 if you're on XB1, I even buy them at 2 caps each when at player camps below level 50.
---
I figure the low level guys need the caps more, so I don't mind helping them out a bit.
---
I got lucky yesterday and found a camp with 6k .556 rounds @ 1 per, bought em all.
---
No worries man! It was about 10 hours ago! I’m at work now to :(
---
Go right ahead!
---
I would definitely like to see more enemy variety.  Having them hit harder or have interesting attacks is way more interesting than buffing their hp.  I think by doing this is makes some builds more viable for certain situations.
---
I also think buffing specific creatures would help make the enemy specific perks and legendary effects much more valuable.  Bethesda really needs to look at the enemy damage cards and effects because they all need a buff.  There just isn't much of a reason to run exterminators, troubleshooters, hunters, etc at the moment.  They need to be buffed to 50 pct extra damage at a minimum.
---
Im Not sure but I would say no to that.
---
I am pc player. Name is LordVulpius. You can add me and visit my shop anytime. I'll put all ammo for sale for 1c when I arrive home from work.
---
Also, please, enjoy some free water, corps, milk, copper ore when you are there too.
---
I am not a greedy person. In a wasteland, I would be the first who die by tge raiders, lol... :)
---
Whats 25
---
Sadly I am PC player, but thanks :)
---
I am glad you had a sense of humor at least - Most people seem to get pretty upset. This was a fun read- thank you sir!
---
I kept it the second time. This guys pockets were busting at the seems with the stuff!
---
I wish you could hotkey the closest to spoiling next food item that provides nutrition but won't cause disease. It would keep pulling up the next item up the spoilage scale, that'd be great.
---
Wild crops are instanced, camp crops are not.
---
Good on you! It doesn’t spoil either so now you’re set!
---
Yep any “small animal spawn” creature will work :)
---
I like this event but the area is huge and hard to defend playing with only 1 or 2 people.  Bethesda needs to take a look at this one and do a bit of a rework in my opinion.
---
It was super fun for me, but not any more, because all their is left for me to do is what once already done 10 times. A few modders could give us 100 hours of new adventures.
---
Well you are making these things rare for others players.. I'm not banging you, just stating facts. What you are complaining about,  you are doing... 
---
I chose not to make this an issue for others.. so I won't do it.
---
Personally I don't server hop but I sell other things that sell well. that I can craft. Buy some plans and sell those items, then you can make tons of caps and not be a bunny rabbit hopping all the time.
---
Thank you! What does Fallout have to do with LGBT in the first place.
---
Don’t run trough lvls, don’t read too much, sooner than latter you won’t have content while being super OP as balls.
---
Enjoy friend!
---
Both worked like a charm for me. Critter is anything that doesn't attack you on sight. I killed a ragstad and felt terrible about it.
---
So you came into an obviously active subreddit dedicated to the game and assumed it was dead? It's insulting that you think anyone is stupid enough to believe that bullshit.
---
Make a ton of soup / stew as your primary food and water source, and drop it on your quick bar. I know it's not a perfect fix but having one item on your quick bar that you can easily just drop to constantly helps a lot.
---
Lol, thanks for that mate I’ll make sure I switch that over
---
What legendary effects?
---
I made a new character recently and was pleasantly surprised as to how difficult the early game can be, especially if you wander out of your range. I helped some other low levels defend a workshop near Grafton from anglers and it was a bloodbath! We were running for our lives, dropping mines, hiding in the plant, etc.
---
It's tough to replicate this feeling for high level players without making the mobs artificially tough, but I'd rather have artificially tough than one-shotting everything forever.
---
Man, I gotta know then... how the hell some of these CAMPs are so damn large and stuffed full of stuff.
---
I visited one last night in the Toxic Valley... 3 stories tall, approx. 5x5, doors... fully kitted out. Thing was MASSIVE... I can't build anything near that size, and if I do.. it ends up being empty.
---
This happened with me with the nukashine questline, with the house (not with the shop). I waited 2 days then they let me in.
---
Maybe a server hop solves it faster.
---
Yesterday this happened but I waited, and turned out to be a 3 star TSE lever. My best roll ever in 185 levels.
---
Canned dog food and put it on favorite along with purified water and that’s what I’ve done to get around the annoyance
---
They hardly ever respond to negative news.
---
In FO4 I installed as mod to keep Preston from giving me new random quests. Now I wish I could find Preston to give me random quests. I don't care if I ever kill the SBQ again. It just doesn't matter.
---
It worked for me last night, but I agree it should happen often given it’s high percentage.
---
No. I would only trade yours for an Anti-Armor or an Instigating. Otherwise I would stick with the Furious.
---
I totally thought you woulda fucked him up
---
What? No, I adore Rose. One of the best voice acted characters in this game IMO. Her quests are garbage, but that's not the fault of the voice actress.
---
Very nice! I don't comment much on camps' but I like this one..
---
Who cares about sights for the 10mm SMG when you've got sights for the paddle ball?
---
What kind of game is it? I would appreciate examples.
---
No. It wasn't in question.
---
Aqua Boy/Girl level 1
---
I don't mind playing with others but, I rarely use a mic because I tend to over talk sometimes lol.
---
For the zippy taste.
---
Cool, how about that server stability u/bethesdagamestudios_ ?
---
I would be more than happy to take your free fusion cells off your hands if you're on PS4 😊
---
Behemoths: Just a side note... in FO4, my agility/luck build could one shot those things with a stealth crit, every damn time.
---
Actually... that build could stealth crit everything in game with one shot.
---
Agreed, Instigating or AA would be ideal for a gauss
---
I agree with this just on the Deathclaw alone. Everything else would be great as well. I purposely stayed in the forest area thinking the other locations were too high level for me. Once I began exploring I realized they weren't as bad as I had thought. The map is broken up into sections based on enemy level so it should be harder to explore. Just my opinion.
---
My Vendor Characters are usually in bed, inside the locked building, if I have a lot of sales, I will go out to restock, and sometimes bring in my main, or another character to move caps, but otherwise don't generally interact with customers.
---
sounds like you are in the toxic part of the map. 
---
Forrest has clear water
---
A full set of unyielding armor, iron fists perk, solar powered, pretty much anything that improves strength like radicool. With radicool on you can lower your health with radiation to get the bloodied damage up. Then you need dmg resist perks as well. Good luck!
---
I know about living. I'm asking a question about a game.
---
Full Auto receivers don't reduce damage enough to justify making your gun a semi imho.
---
Full auto is more than capable of One shotting stuff with headshots using tap tap instead of hold down. Then you can also hold it down for big targets and really let the damage fly.
---
If he was over lvl 50... yes.
---
That means a lot to me. Thank you
---
It hasn't worked for bulk stuff for a long time. I don't think it was a stealth nerf though.
---
Well then you just dont like 76... Like i said that's cool but dont be bringing the hate to those who do.
---
I couldn't play fo4 past diamond city. Seriously 3 times i tried and i just hated the game. It was so bad. All the mechanics work so much better in multiplayer for me.
---
Go back and play what you enjoy and dont let crazies like fallout fans tell you whats good and whats not ☺
---
This is cringe worthy.
---
It should have a server wide notification but should also be level locked to 50. I cant tell you how many times I have seen it pop up just to go there and find out a level 16 has started it and is already failing miserably with no time left to salvage the run.
---
*owl mask of judgement intensifies*
---
True human compassion 😂 I like how you were real with him though.
---
I agree with this. Ironically, it was less noticeable when servers were less stable because they crashed more often and more new servers would spawn up more often, meaning that with a few hops you could usually find a server that was fresh. I tried to do this with a new character I was leveling and it was really rough. I think it took me 10 hops to find a server that had a relatively fresh noobie area.
---
The one funny side effect is that the less popular spots feel like gold mines when you hit them. Junk everywhere! All that wonderful aluminum, steel, lead,etc. But being a new player and not knowing how the mechanics work, it would really suck.
---
That would be confusing then wouldn’t it? Happy hunting!
---
random question, but why do you get packaged food instead of crafting food from creature meat?
---
Thank you! I thought iron fist only effected bare fist punches  but I suppose I am wrong. Thanks again!
---
Need about 40 health - the rest should be rads - radicool, iron fist x3 , nerd rage x3, bloody mess x3, adrenal reaction, talons, twisted muscles, martial artist x3, incisor x3, adrenaline x3, class freak x3
---
Just relax and enjoy the game.  I was much higher than your level when I attempted what you are doing.  I would have gotten frustrated, too. Explore the Forest, make a home in Morgantown, kill tons of scorched at the trainyard and airport, sell all their stuff, rinse and repeat, amass a small fortune, get some power armor, etc.  I love this game and highly recommend you not call it quits.  There is so much to do.  I'm level 223 and still find new stuff.
---
Does it protect against waterborne diseases?
---
Thanks!
---
Bloodied, +40% power attack damage, and +40% damage resistance while power attacking
---
And yes you need the Unyielding set as well! And you’re welcome
---
One time I rushed Grafton Steel on a level 200 player. I was 140 at the time.
---
He lost 2000 lead, and 300 acid.
---
TSE is still good but as previously mentioned those 25% extra damage decrease your accuracy, not that much of a problem if you stay close to your enemies or use it on bigger targets. AA is only good on powerful enemies as they have the armor your going to penetrate
---
Iron fist effects any melee weapon that will not work while in power armor. So dcg, meat hook, mmg, brass knuckles etc
---
You didn't use descriptive title and you are clickbaiting...
---
I put it on a crappy 2\* I had and it is still fine.  I'm not sure I would try it on a good 3\* as of right now.
---
Good to know about unyielding. I'm kinda new to the meta and this is a learning experience.
---
It's... been a while since you were sub-level 50, hasn't it?
---
The wasteland can still kick the piss out of a character... just not min/max uber-build characters.
---
I've said it before, I'll say it again... games like this have greater longevity if people would just put down the damn calculators and play the thing. If you start hunting for "synergy" and discussing how to max your build, and what the current "meta" is... well, yeah... you end up with everything being too simple. and then we end up here, with people wanting the game to cater to the meta builds.
---
Just my $0.02, worth what you paid for it. Goofball "character" builds are where the fun is. The game remains challenging, and it's a hell of a lot more fun than the cookie cutter run-through.
---
 I'm not going to spoil anything and mention where I go to find things, but I need plastic and concrete, etc all the time even as a level 302. I look around the map for what I need and if it's not there I check other areas. I never server hop to get what I need in those areas if another player has been there already. If you're looking on the internet for sweet loot spots, chances are many other players know about these spots as well. I find that if you play the game normally and pick up junk as you go you should have ~80% of what you need so long as you don't die and drop your junk along the way.
---
You can also always take various junk collectors on the map and stack up junk while you're adventuring.
---
I think, key words, it's fire sniper builds. The damage is much higher if you have all the perks, mutations, and equipment to go along with it. It's a whole build style and not just one weapon, armor.
---
I loved 76 until they stopped adding content. I am not bringing hate to anything. I just want more of what the game had at launch.
---
Ok cool!
---
You honed in on the fact that I said I'd server hop to fix this but that wasn't the point. I'm saying that's not a valid solution and it sucks, and I'm not focused on any specific "rare" loot beyond examples. I'm pretty disappointed when I enter somewhere new to me and I can tell someone has taken everything that wasn't nailed down. Not even because I want all the loot for myself, but because I can't see the area the way it was intended.
---
Yea its a life saver literally lol
---
No, this is not how things works.
---
The game doesnt  compute all -% or all +% as positif or negative effects.
---
Each effect is driven by conditions, with sub effect(s) attached, the 50% hunger simply doesnt have class freak condition in order to reduce it.
---
Lol. Couldn't just waste him. It wouldnt be right.
---
Packaged food doesnt expire
---
here is a good start. You can fill in others as you think best

bandolier so you can carry all of your ballistic ammo on you and not take up stash

concentrated fire for the VATS accuracy

Rifleman for the increase in rifle dmg

action boy &amp; marathoner to keep your AP up so you can use VATS more
---
bloody mess for the increase dmg
---
if you are going to be in a team, get inspirational ASAP for the XP increase
---
One thing to keep in mind, you can save perk points but you cannot get high level perks until you have spent the lower level perk points. For example, starch genes (which is a must if you are going to be mutated, which everyone is) but, starch genes you can get at level 30. If you turn level 30 and have 5 unspent perk points, you still cannot get starch genes until you have spent those 5 unspent perks points. What that means is you can only get starch genes 1 at 30 and starch genes 2 at 31.
---
It says creature in english too. But i guess that means non hostile in this game 😯
---
It is **not** a Role Playing Game, it is not in the same line as the Fallout series, especially 3 and 4; heck even those 2 games were not really RPG games (IMO).
---
It is a grinder-shooter.
---
Yeah the easiest item to farm.
---
Do you play in third-person?
---
I find this often happens if you play in third-person and do an emote at some point.  The markers on your compass will be all messed up.  The way I fix it is to go into first-person and back out.  It's been like this for months, unfortunately.  Given how Campfire Tales has that objective where you stand there and emote, immediately followed by using quest markers to find certain trees, you'd kind of think someone at Bethesda would have noticed by now, because that consistently causes the error for me.
---
It's not clickbait and you're being an ass. I'm sure you wont be getting any support from other users here.
---
This is the way I wish others handled workshops. I'll build them up and tend to them rarely and if a player contests it, I'll just let them have it. I take more pride in the building and having my creation live on through generations of players (hopefully)! What tends to happen to me though, is whomever takes the shop is part of a group, tracks me down on the map and comes kills me miles away from the actual workshop. Not sure why they're that dedicated but it seems to be the norm for me...
---
It's a confirmed bug and they are planning to address it in the next patch.
---
Are there certain perks and armor things I should be looking for then? I just want to make sure I get the best bang for my buck. I've been out of the loop for a while, before I got off it was all two shot explosive. I haven't played since the Nerf really.
---
you have to have the right perks and be below 20% health and you'll see how strong bloodied is.
---
One run through Big Bend and scrapping the weapons and junk on the other side and it’s like nothing ever happened.
---
Wait two minutes and repeat? This is why no one takes complaints about thirst and hunger like this seriously. Unless you're constantly spamming chems even with speed demon it takes upwards of 45 to 50 minutes for even the quicker draining thirst to go from hydrated to the first stage of dehydration.
---
I sit in my rocking chair next to my vendor because I'd consider selling most of the stuff on my character also. And I cant trust people to kill the mobs they spawn. Also I have a very interactive camp and I want to hangout and meet new people.
---
It wasn't at launch, I concede that it is now. It won't excel or profit at that.
---
That’s a really good idea, that might help with the server stability too.
---
Every time I play survival and I meet Someone I just get AK bullets straight to the chest .. I’m level 30 and I barely have enough time to play but it is what it is 😆
---
Exactly.
---
1. We are inoculated against the scorched blight. The responders were working on an inoculation program, but never finished it. As part of their quest, you finish their research and be come inoculated. 
---
2. I'd ask instead, why are so many players so bad at this game? How do you function doing so little dps? 99% of the time if I do a random SBQ nuke, I'll just sit and watch to see how much her health is dropping when I'm not attacking. It doesn't move, even with 5-10 others attacking usually. When I open up, she's dead in 3 minutes or less and you can see her health dropping the entire time.
---
I wish some one would offer to buy a workshop I had taken. Instead I get the cheese builds that insta-gib me.
---
are the buffs from food/tea/etc generally not worth the effort?
---
It's sounds great but isn't. It is basically a 1\* TwoShot Dragon. Faster Fire rate means nothing when the gun has to be reloaded after each shot. 15% faster crit rate also doesn't mean much since most of the time your not attacking with the gun repeatably to build a crit and the gun does enough damage by itself that the crit doesn't mean much.
---
I would sell it for 1.5k and if I couldn't unload it in a few days I would scrip it.
---
Looking forward to see the damage I do to the SBQ, seeing dmg should also be very useful to choose between guns/builds etc.
---
The more sensitivity options the better, I prefer everything slower, so don’t forget about people like me.
---
Still missing an option to always see hunger and thirst options.
---
This patch sounds great, thanks Bethesda!
---
I mean this is more of a little thing that Would be fairly easy to implement. A proper endgame would likely take a while, and even if it came out would most likely have a lot of bugs
---
Can i like it all? Something about a grind that i can work on in my own time at my own pace that is very satisfying. I never try to min max things so when i get that pop... Ahhhh success!
---
Okk thanks
---
Brain bombs give you +90hp and +300ap for 2 hours.
---
I recreated my IRL apartment so God save anyone who attacks my CAMP. ;)
---
Ok thanks
---
Yes haha
---
Yeah, the main quest will happily lead you into areas before you are ready.  Rose's quests are firmly in the Savage Divide, a region with the highest difficulty cap (which extends eastward too).  It's no place for a Lv. 19.  Heck, depending on your setup, it's no place for a Lv. 50 either.
---
The whole world is available to you from the start, but the idea is that you remain in the Forest and venture to the Toxic Valley, then the Ash Heap, and get your levels there before you head east.  You can get lucky going east and spawn enemies more appropriate to your level, if no one else has been there recently.  I started exploring there in the Lv. 30s and while it was quite tough (there are some things you simply *can't* deal with), it was thrilling at the same time.
---
25% faster fire rate
---
Thx
---
I farmed the PA spawn points and generators around the forest.
---
There are at least 12 PA spawns in the forest alone, and IDK how many generators.
---
On a good day, some of the spawn points  have up to 5 cores in the area.  
---
Arktos was one of my favorites, but I figure its probably picked over since the event started there.
---
On a good day, this little trip may get you up to 20 cores of varying charge levels:
---
&gt;!Do the event at Camden Amusement park, and fully explore the entire park while you are there.  !&lt;
---
&gt;!Then explore/clear the nuka cola plant. !&lt;
---
&gt;!Exit the plant and check Poseidon.  !&lt;
---
&gt;!If it is not owned, go there and check the table next to the processor.  There's usually a core and a plan on the table.!&lt;
---
&gt;!Explore/clear Wade airport.!&lt;
---
&gt;!Go across to the mining HQ building in Charleston - clear and explore.!&lt;
---
&gt;!In the ash heap, there's one spot with spawn points across the street from each other, and both may have 2 cores.  !&lt;
---
&gt;!If you go there from the back door of riverside manor, you'll pass another location that usually has a core.!&lt;
---
Get the batteries included perk if you don't already have it, this will cut the weight of cores from 3# to 0.3#.
---
Someone else said line on the sand event. True, but @33, not sure if you are ready for that event quite yet.
---
I think you missed his acknowledgement of that and the fact that he's poking fun at himself.... You are likely *really* fun to party with....
---
Sadly I am PC.
---
Could you post your build? I’ve been thinking of removing some points from my endurance.  Getting rid of ironclad and putting some of those points into agi. Thanks!
---
also no melee perks.........still carry both.
---
bastet great for bugs and rats....all rise great for hitting gouls on the head. (a/r at 147)
---
We ARE better than everyone else. Now piss off
---
Woah, woah, woah, this is the Brotherhood of Steel, not the Adeptus Mechanicus.
---
There it is....
---
If you exchange scrip for legendaries on your low level character what does the purveyor give you?  Is it all max level stuff or do you get items nearest your current level?
---
Where did you get it so cheap
---
That’s hot
---
Yessss

#LIBERT PRIME IS ONLINE
---
I'm not defending him, but teenage / college age Oxhorn was kind of a religious zealot extremist. I know a lot of people like that, living in a very religious area, and I can say 100% that these people are a product of their environment. Heck, I grew up with a religious, gay hating father, and it wasn't until I got out of the house that I really started to think for myself, because living with him meant I had to do everything I could to appease him, which included mirroring his views, unless I wanted my freedom taken away or to be physically harmed. 
---
Oxhorn never advocated for hate, but he certainly was morally opposed to that community. He was also very much against masturbation - he made a video about it. He claims that he's seen the error in his ways and has changed his views over time. I think he's sincere in this. IMO, when you do things that are wrong, all you can do is acknowledge that they were wrong and apologize, which he has done.
---
I find the best place to collect lead is my face
---
Your video was hilarious! I really love the succulents on your stairs and I need a pic of François! I think you should name the Flamingo  Ambrose!
---
Read this and thought of this movie scene lol
---
[https://youtu.be/KIk0abbYgXQ](https://youtu.be/KIk0abbYgXQ)
---
This would likely be an early bug that they would hopefully fix in some sort of testing. If not this could be an early problem.
---
Agree here, I'm not the gung-ho quester, but I like the stuff that comes with lol at level 337 and I still have one more overseer holo to find... 😂
---
That was my thought. I only use my power armor very occasionally, but I have 1-2 sets of every power armor in the game, with different paints, and they just sit in my stash.
---
I just can't bring myself to search for all the plans and such again so just  have a level 180 stealth/rifle/1H melee guy.
---
No. Bloodied is a broken fucking mechanic and exactly what I was talking about. You really think it's an intended mechanic to have people running around with 10% HP at all times? That's busted, and I won't participate in making it acceptable.
---
I am reserved in expecting any resolve to these issues since they keep pushing out broken crap. Yesterday’s server freeze during Cryptid was the last straw for me doing it ever again. The challenges have been in the back burner for too long if they cared. Just fixing the stuff they have in place would make many of us happy instead of more if the new crap.
---
I'm just messing around with you. I'm actually a double agent. Bos and Enclave. There are literally thousands of us
---
Ass for the ass god's!
---
My best advice is to pick a weapon type to specialize in and stick to it. If you try to be a jack of all trades you will severely handicap yourself in the mid to late game. Most weapon types are viable with the right build. Rifleman, commando, unarmed, two hand melee, and heavy weapons are all good. Pistols aren't great but they can be propped up with a VATS heavy build to get enough damage. Sneak is very powerful and will give a bunch more damage with sneak attacks.
---
Also, this game is not like previous Fallout games where you can hoard absolutely everything. You must remember the lessons of the Sierra Madre: "Finding it, though, that's not the hard part. It's letting go."
---
So I run a bloodied build. This is what I get for running at 20% health:
---
1) + 80% damage (bloodied)
---
2) +40% damage (adrenal reaction)
---
3) + 5 strength (Radicool)
---
4) + 40 DR, +20% damage, + 15% AP regen (Nerd Rage)
---
5) +15 Str, +15 Perc, +15 Cha, +15 Int, +15 Agi, +15 Luck (Unyielding armor)
---
On top of that I can run at stealth with my 30+ Agi and not be seen most of the time which totally counters the low health. However, if I get mobbed I will die.
---
Well if I were to get melee perks which one should I do one handed or two handed?
---
Ooo that's brilliant mate and you got noticed by Bethesda!
---
Thousands of double agents? Why dont you just kill the 6 people that arent double agents then? Lol.
---
The bugs are eating them. I've heard this is a rather common bug, but I don't pay enough attention to know if it happened to me. If we could bulk wrap ammo then it would probably fix it, as well as allowing more variety in pricing.
---
Ah!  Yeah that will do it.  If you don't want to PvP, that's the way to go.
---
That’s a great help, I usually play in first person but was in third person as I fancied a change and the error occurred just after waving at another player so that matches what you’ve said perfectly. 
---
Thanks for your help, that’s cleared it up perfectly.
---
Just want to say thank you all whom tried to help, Be it kind words or looking for corrupted files ,.. It is All of YOU who make this game great
---
My wife exclusively plays in third person and her compass never works.
---
No, not really. Not even in PvE if you want to be able to solo all content. Instead you should be asking "WHICH build can do everything in the game with ease?" - those builds do exist. A bloodied heavy gunner is very accessible, even to new players, and can do everything in the game, including soloing the silo and SBQ with ease, and doesn't require a ton of caps investment. That build can also swap in 2h melee perks and run melee for easier content to save ammo. My write up on it if you're interested:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76Guides/comments/blw1y6/the\_bloodied\_heavy\_weapons\_tank\_an\_end\_game\_pve/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76Guides/comments/blw1y6/the_bloodied_heavy_weapons_tank_an_end_game_pve/) 
---
Alternatively, once you have some gear, a bloodied rifleman build will absolutely wreck SBQ - even faster than the heavy gunner, with the right perks and the right playstyle / ideal conditions. THis does require ideal conditions happening though, and overall I think this character is weaker in other aspects of pve, though it has far more potential in pvp.
---
It's fixed
---
lol some people seems to be rather toxic here. Either he was expecting you to be a bad guy and was disappointed or Behemoth shoved a firehydrand weapon in his arse...
---
I usually do 1 *3 ranged weapon(100scrip) and 1 2* ranged weapon (50 scrip) on each character.
---
 It seems the weapons that can be near my lvl (pipe rifle, hunting rifle) will be my lvl.
---
 Guns that can't be a level 1 or 5 (handmade, plasma rifle, ect..) seem to be always max lvl
---
 I have not tested any armor yet from the purveyor.
---
You do realize that the ACTUAL bug that's been here since the game launched is that if you're spamming crafting the sound effect only triggers like once and the vault boy image only pops up after you exit no matter how many times the effect actually triggered.
---
What's this?
---
Oh look! Local wildlife....
---
Lol. He was trying to get some karma from other trolls.
---
Yet they cant fix their own robot or a water purifier themselves.
---
I think everyone should start with a clean slate and no jumping between modes.  
---
Survival should be capped at level 50 so you can't ever change specials around.  This would make every character have to pick one main style and stick with it.
---
Did you find out what the followups are for shotgun and gauntlet or unarmed?
---
This will certainly prevent people from buying weapon skins in the future.
---
God I wish we could message on PC
---
Two shot is garbage for pve content, and there are better prefixes for pvp. Furious is garbage on slow firing weapons. For max damage you'd want Bloodied. Junkies is also somewhat viable, though requires more upkeep, and you'd still want to be at 19% HP for adrenal reaction. For PvP Mutants, Assassins, or other stuff is also viable, though with a gauss rifle I'd think you'd want to run a 1 - 2 shot build, meaning bloodied.
---
I've read it in a whole difrent way... in my point of view he tryed to dismiss the fact that he lost all his farming items with a "I didnt need them any way"... poor escuse xD. Like saying a bad joke and when no one finds it funny you reply "well it wasnt meant to be funny anyway" ... its lame and sad.
---
Jesus Fucking Christ. What's worse than people complaining about secret nerfs after a patch? People deciding weeks after the last patch that Bethesda broke something and they're the only person to have figured it out.
---
Well some people spawn in enemies and dont bother clearing them out. Don't need my camp wrecked while someone's contemplating dropping 50 caps on bullets. 🤷
---
Yeah I always feel bad when I take a workshop just for the weekly/daily challenge but don’t actually want the workshop. I usually try to leave a message on the workshop letting people know I won’t defend if they take it from me, but messaging would be so simple.

My CAMP is literally just a rectangular wooden shack
---
The last sentence - I couldn't agree more. Every time they've adding new quests/events they're breaking other aspects of the game that worked good. I've changed to heavy gunner, because my melee had been broken (vats stopped working on flying enemies, making it irritating to try to hit bloatflies or other small enemies). They've fixes daily for Savage Divide, but still can't fix dailies for Mire (it's like that for months).
---
I'm almost positive I can craft them. I'll report back in 24 hours.
---
i have 2 dedicated merchant builds, i can only fit so much in my machines, so i have much much more on me at all times, I have a little area i stand at behind my bar, I will wait till someone is done shopping the vending machines, and then ill flash the "trade" emote to let them know i have more in stock on me
---
I dont follow them around though, im like the shop keeper, my place is behind the counter
---
I'm asking what kind of game you think it is. Borderlands? I've played every FO game and many others as I would if I were in the character's shoes aka RPG. Dungeon Master, Fallout, System Shock, whatever. FO76 was no different until the main quest ran out and all that has been left is repetition, grinding, achievements, yanking it.
---
76 survival? Fragmenting the player base. Sounds like nuclear winter will be another fragmentation into a battle Royale game so there will be three player bases from the shrinking one.
---
Fragmenting from core audience into imitations of other products is a recipe for failure.
---
Hmmm Ambrose as a name for a flamingo....interesting! Thanks for watching.
---
I'm sorry for your difficulties. I'm sure that once the game gets out of BETA and is ready for an actual release that these problems will be cleared up
---
In the middle of the map, almost literally xD
---
friendship is its own reward!
---
Well, I've looked it up, and following the fallout Wiki almost every NPC-entity counts as creature.
---
But you're absolutly right, just tried a brahmin, worked like a charm.
---
Thank you guys
---
You can definitely like it all if  that's what you enjoy. I wish I still could.
---
Lol I actually got down voted for this 😂 probably should have put /s at the end
---
that is how my step dad "convinced" me to marry his daughter
---
I think you have to be in the workshop now for pvp to activate if you have pacifist mode on.
---
Noob question, with unyielding armor and getting +15 stats, does that boost your damage?
---
The only thing I sell for more than 1c each is plasma rounds.  Those seem to be the rarest of ammo types so I sell them for 3 each.
---
I would tell him I take 70% of what he gets or I take it for my self, let the player know there is a food chain, or I tell the player to give me 200-300 caps for not taking the factory, that is also a good way to farm caps on servers, most players take the offer if you are 200+ level 
---
(A fun way to be a raider)
---
I always capture it if nobody else has it, and give food to anyone that lingers around as if they want the workshop.
---
Do you have any of those mutations that trigger PVP?
---
There would be stuff destroying their garden if it were an apocalypse
---
Defending workshops is actually the fastest way to level up, for mid and high level shops you get all the kill XP plus the 3-400ish xp for completing
---
If you set up turrets like crazy you don't actually have to defend it half the time, missile and mk2 turrets everywhere, kinda wasteful though
---
Also you have to go back at least every half hour to collect stuff anyway the extractors can't hold more than that
---
Join the enclave we actually dont care about people just mind the psychotic robot
---
Also do you stay below a constant 20% if so how?
---
Carnivore, then a quick trip to Flatwoods, and make some ribeye stake. I've also got 4 industrial water purifiers and have at least 100 purified water on me at all times. So along with the well fed perk, you get extra carry weight.
---
I wish that 100 player that took my workshop would've paid me... or shit, at least ask. Instead, he proceeded to "help" by defending against mole rats, immediately took the workshop and sniped me.
---
Ok fine. I'm only 25 or so at the time but kind of unnecessary to come to my camp nearby and shoot it up. So I vats and killed him (surprisingly!) He returns with all sorts of explosives and tears my camp down.
---
Not cool dude. Promptly server hopped after that.
---
That's super shitty..... however, it's really awesome for raider RP.
---
They're multiplicative. Say you start with a 100 armor target. AA brings it down to 50. Tank killer removes 33% of that, which brings it down to 33. Perforating magazine is.. I think 40%? So that brings it down to 19.8.
---
You shouldn't be downvoted. Your point is absolutely correct. No mention of bug fixes, no mention of server stability, no mention of anything in regards to the foundation.
---
But hey, here is a bunch of stuff noone asked for.
---
Well to be fair, its a verry good argument
---
I prefer to stay a faction less raider whi fig gt s anyone over lvl 50.
---
I think you misunderstood my point. I wasnt saying it's being confused as a positive effect because its +%.  
---
Imagine a table that has 2 columns, Positive Effects and Negative Effects. The +50% Hunger/Thirst is in the wrong column.
---
Yeah, I can guarantee I have killed a hermit crab and sbq  many, many times over. Yet challenges say I haven't
---
Very much yes
---
No, broadsider is crap, no matter the roll...
---
Cant be done anymore. Lol. Camps are invincible these days.
---
You posted this same thing 20 minutes ago
---
Night vision scopes are kind of pointless. They're super annoying to use during the day and nights aren't dark enough to warrant using them.
---
Yes with Lots of rads. That way when I pop a stim pack I don't over heal. If I feel I need more health I can also pop a diluted rad away.
---
[OP IRL](https://imgur.com/bVPaN4F)
---
It would boost your melee but not ranged.
---
Well isn't that why they keep them civilians around? Kinda like IRL,though civilians get more cake than the military doing the same thing as their military counterpart. And lets not forget the lone wonderer who fixed project purity in F03 and ended bangin the elders daughter ( at least i think thats what happened )
---
If they could fix this I'd be so happy. I have speed demon on one character, but opted out on my newest one cause I just can't keep up with the hunger and thirst. It's such a hassle the mutation isn't even worth it. I would love it because I like to use my TSE Gauss every so often!
---
Supposedly that's just a visual bug. When it pops up in the corner with "So-and-so bought your 5.56 rounds (11,000)", the number that it is showing is not representative of what they actually bought. I've heard someone say its the number that the buyer now has? or maybe it's how many you have left? But this should be easy to test. you most likely didn't get screwed out of caps though, luckily!
---
Str will increase melee damage, PER vats accuracy, AGI for stealth, chr for cap prices etc.
---
You keep your rads at 80% to help keep the health at 20, this also boosts STR via Radicool
---
Ok cool, super helpful
---
You're telling me that you are not also a double agent? Can you go to the fourth floor of the asylum? Can you get in the Enclave bunker?
---
I NEED TO UPVOTE THIS MORE!
---
I've noticed mine switched off twice, but I think both times I had started a new character so I assumed it was because of that.
---
Haha, I was just generalizing and giving you a hard time. But honestly, keep your head up and stick with it. That was part of the fun for me. I got help from higher level players while I was at low levels and then started returning the favor. You’ll remember this slog later and want to help others just getting started.
---
Same at west tek. If you run scrapper you het 19 steel per assault rifle
---
I know, but the game is more fun for the rest of the players as well, ones took 3 factories from 3 random people who then teamed up agains me to reclaim the factories and then when I tried to take them back again all the 3 players showed up, even tho I am not the good guy I made them team up agains a raider(:
---
I got shot at because i walked past a workshop the other day lol by some dude and 3 if his friends. I was just exploring and they followed me from tyler county dirt track to vault 76 lol. I play on peaceful so it wasnt really an issue, but it was super annoying.
---
I just take them and leave without building anything. It ends up overrun by enemies because I don't even go back to defend.
---
Maybe that’s it, because I did too.
---
Ya, this exactly. I'm mainly a melee bloodied. using hiding/sneaking/ninja and covert are a staple for me.
---
You can balance the build a little too. I see my gauntlet is putting out 2k+ damage so I decided to replace 2 unyielding armor pieces with bolstering to even out the damage output and taken damage. This helps with the death count. If you have 40% faster swing or faster reload on a gun, it also helps. 
---
It's the trade off, if you can sneak up and one shot a lvl 91 deathclaw with your melee weapon, you don't need to rly worry about dying from it.
---
I had to make my camp in the forest and surrounded my measly crop patch with turrets. It worked pretty well. On my other character I placed the crops on rugs and moved them into the 3rd story of my house. Not sure if they fixed this mechanic yet though.
---
You have to take into account that people pricing weapons that high are also idiots. No weapon is worth that much unless it's God rolled. People get a bloodied weapon with three stars and automatically decide they're going to make bank off of it even if those two extra stars are bash damage and speed while aiming.
---
True. I guess I just like repetition mixed with randomness and for that, 76 is perfectly fine for me.
---
We are a community of peaceful outgoing players who are always there to lend a hand, our goal is to make Appalachia a better place to live, we are farmers, traiders, Soilders, guids, medics, craftsmen and scavengers. If ever anyone is starving or unequiped for the new word they must enter in, we are there, We are the children born from the ashes of the battle at Huntersville where the brotherhood and responders put aside their differences to defeat the supermutant ravaging the lands, we carry on their legacy, we are the Peace keepers of Appalachia.
---
Sounds to me like you got a pretty good value out of your $60 purchase if you enjoyed a hundred hours worth of entertainment.
---
When did that change? This happened like 2 weeks ago lol. Seems/sounded like an explosive minigun or automatic rifle of some sort. Lots of my walls and generators were trashed. :( 
---
Didnt cost much to repair, but damn, just kill me! Not all my work.
---
all rise is 2, bastet is 1..............just to make life easy.
---
both do the job with out perks.unless you want to melee build.
---
I have the cards but cant be arsed swaping them.
---
go whitespring golf and try them out
---
Just sell/legendary scrap it. Hopefully your next weapon will be better
---
Or I posted just the opposite.
---
yeah i was hoping for faster swing speed instead of damage reduction while power attacking
---
OMG gold?! Wow thanks!
---
I've used this mechanic with great success in making it look very nice. You can find some ideas on youtube.
---
Nah. I have no loyalties at all. They just think I'm on their sides but really it's all about taking all the good stuff for myself. The BoS are having trouble fighting the scorched? Hmmm... if only someone was hoarding 50 suits of fully molded PA they could use.
---
Escuse me?
---
Oof
---
The system designed to stop them instead makes them easier a d more viable
---
Iv tester both, Iv gotta day 2 handed just hits harder. More direct damage. But the 1 handed has a faster swing so they semi even themselves out. I prefer 2handed just because I prefer 3 swings instead of 6
---
That doesn’t excuse blatantly false marketing. I am a strong defender of this game but even I have to admit that Bethesda kinda got what they deserved here.
---
If you use it just for a VATS critical shot against a tough enemy it might be pretty solid, but it would probably be easier to switch to another weapon for the rest of the battle. Could be fun, but I don't think it's super powerful. I think Vampire works better on fast firing weapons, because then you get it constantly. Give it a try and see how it feels.
---
Camps have been invincible for like a month a belive
---
Or even an "eat/drink now" option when you find something on the ground so you don't have to pick it up.
---
Yeah. Poor poor deathclaws. Such pushovers now.   I used to run away, now I just pop them in the belly with a sneak attack and watch then crash to the ground.
---
No, you deserve that. That was fucking hilarious.
---
They all just cancel each other out really.
---
I know what perk card im taking next time I level!  I knew it was helpful for steel, but didnt realize it was that much haha
---
I knew this is what would happen , but still ,.. at least take the time to write an apologetic email , not a generic response that makes your customer question any further future transactions,..
---
Also try the ice cream shop by the Ferris wheel! You spawn in the woods, walk to the street and turn right and you will head down a hill. You will see a turned over bus and one of the random spawns for the forest is right behind that. He seems to spawn there more for me.
---
Indeed upvote this yo
---
Damn, tell that to my scraps. For shits and giggles, imma unfriend one of my buddies and attempt to blow his shit up.
---
Not gonna do it to a rando, then I'm THAT asshole.
---
There's a farm on the west side of the map that has like 100 razorgrain plants. More than you can handle really. I recommend stopping in if you don't like having it in your camp.
---
They're both asking the opposite thing, but it still could've been one post. I definitely prefer actual quests over the dailies. Those to me are like glorified FO4 radiant quests, and while it's nice to have them, they're no substitute and they're all we've been getting for a while now.
---
I haven't crashed in fallout in ages, but play cod black ops 4 and I get kicked every 2 or 3 10 minute games, that's what I call instability
---
This is not true? I hear the water drop sound and the hunger ping from getting low probably every 10 minutes. Literally impossible to stay well fed and hydrated.
---
All I can do it take it and then server hop.... and end up on the same exact survival server. &lt;_&gt;
---
Try. It was in the patch 9 notes
---
I paid $200, got great value, but most importantly, wish I wanted to play 76 instead of going back to Skyrim, Oblivion, FO4, FO3/NV, or even Morrowind. 76 started great then jumped off of a cliff..
---
Honestly, there's better out there but this is free so lots of people are going to have it. For example you can get the same damage out of a puncturing modded power fist AND armor penetration for half as much carry weight.
---
WHEEEEERE ARE THE QUESTS FOR THE REST OF THE TROPHIES, WHEEEEEEEEEEREEEEEEE? T\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_T
---
More upvotes for quests, fyi.
---
I have Marsupial and Speed Demon, but I don't know if either one triggers PvP or not
---
I want my golden sword and crown!
---
its good for turning back in for scrip thats about it..
---
Quit Raiding my heart!
---
Wait...which workshop generates food?
---
You're very welcome and I'm glad you enjoyed the story of my scorching, brutal demise! Lol!
---
just give us pa displays like in one of those fallout 4 dlcs
---
yeah its been over a month now, this is kinda grinding my gears
---
they have stated they are "working on it" so maybe with the next patch
---
I run 2 accounts. I have:
---
1. Main - 385 heavy gunner with all power armor plans / working on getting every recipe / plan in the game. (main account)
---
2. 85 Heavy Gunner (main account) that I made because I hated losing 150+ caps per death in pvp on survival. Mostly serves as a mule now
---
3. 70 Blodied sniper (alt account), mostly serves as a mule now.
---
4. 125 heavy gunner (alt account) - this guy was made so that I'd have a viable character on my alt account that could solo all content in the game. I do a lot of dual boxing, playing both accounts on one computer at the same time (don't use any 3rd party software, just alt tab between). As an example, I'd take all 3 power plants on this character and have him afk on the server while my main nuked / repeatedly farmed whitesprings. When I left the game and reloaded to reset the mobs, I'd alt tab to this character and collect all the cores from workshops. This is how I had, at one point, over 1,000 fusion cores.
---
5. level 50+ mule
---
6. level 50+ mule
---
7. level 50+ mule - all of these mules are kitted out with weight reduction gear and full weight reduction perks. They can hold a ridiculous amount of junk, ammo, weapons, armor, aid, etc. I have them all parked at the legendary vendor - I xfer junk legendaries to them and use them to get additional rolls from the Purveyor each day if I've maxed out my scrip on my main.
---
8. level 15 shotgun character that I play when I get really bored.
---
9. level 10 auto rifle character that I'm trying to get to 100+ after getting him a BE handmade.
---
10. Spare slot
---
Get rid of it
---
Cannibal makes the eating part a lot easier.
---
Haha, awesome, I will definitely setup by this weekend!
---
Nice !
---
 You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  \* DN \*
---
There's no survival mode ethics. Anything goes. There's no point in playing survival unless you want a deathmatch.
---
At least it wasn't a cat :p
---
Found a possum up by Twin Lakes myself, but yeah, it worked fine for me. Took about an hour &amp; that was waiting for starvation to hit.
---
id say at least 2000 caps as its a 3 star, the 25% faster fire rate could boost it to 2500 or 3000
---
Game engine isn’t set up for it unfortunately.
---
I was the same way. Cool down for a bit after the quests. Let your hate subsite. Turn on Roesies Raider Radio or whatever its called. It's entertaining for a bit!
---
Try having plague walker and speed demon. I spend more time with parasites than without.
---
Im on my way out the door but if you look in my comments you'll see a long post about my current build :) i'll be home again in about  8 hours :)
---
I do a bloodied unarmed/ rifle combo. 
---
At 20% health with no drugs,  my death claw gauntlet does 1750 damage.
---
I also have four pieces of unyielding armor
---
if you are under L50, then whenever you level up, a point is assigned to the same Special as the card you select at the pick a perk card screen.  If the special stat for that card already has 15 points, it will not allow you to select a card from that category, as it is already at max.
---
You have to add a point to a non maxed category.  In order to add new cards to maxed categories, you have to select the category, unequip an existing card, then equip a different one.
---
To check points before selecting a card, at the screen that shows "pick a perk" (on PS4), hit the back button.  This shows all specials and assigned cards.  This is also where you can swap out and level up cards.
---
Decide where you want the point, hit Triangle to get back to the pick a card screen.
---
I love her, she makes me wish I was a robosexual.
---
sunshine meadows industrial farm
---
Still it is not how this works. There is no table.
---
As I said each effect have multiple activation conditions and modulators attached. the class freak one is missing 
---
you can check that on PC with xEdit
---
I must ask... Were they raised in a barn?  Are they trying to air condition the entire neighborhood?  Do they have ANY idea what that electricity bill costs?  Kids...
---
I’ve got a melee and stealth sniper. It’s nice cuz depending on my mood I can have completely different play styles and strategies if I start to get bored.
---
Isn't this post breaking the rules? Bethesda plz posts are banned.
---
I can't ask the same thing, since there isn't a poll feature. I loathed radiant quests. I used mods to stop them. Now I would pay $50 to get them in FO 76. Anything to send me to every location on the map looking for things, or things to kill.
---
We'll see but if a bunch of gun combat gets fixed and updated and I'm still swinging at the air I'm going to be furious
---
Would Mr Handy get effected by this?
---
I'd disagree. Lead, acid, and steel will always be needed for ammo. God rolls like 3 star BE, B25, B25, AAE, AA25, AA50, will always be trade only on PC unless you get very lucky. THe fact is, if you know how to farm them properly, you can max out an account on caps in 18 days. I can generate 25K caps per day with just vendoring stuff, and it only takes about 30 minutes to do.
---
Instigating Gauss is a one-shot machine for most enemies. Add in the stealth multiplier &amp; it starts adding up.
---
Stand up on West-Tek roof, let VATS do its thing, clear the front court yard in a matter of 20 seconds or so.
---
I'd like to try out a bloodied myself, but my character is pretty heavily spec'd for it. IE will definitely do until I find one.
---
Coward
---
downvoted, yet bethesda plz posts are also against the rules. Yet they always get upvoted.
---
Quick travel somewhere else and come back.  Hadn't loaded properly for me first time.  That fixed it.
---
Why make a post asking the same question you asked 30 mins ago in a slightly different way? Why not ask within the same post? Just curious
---
If you are using heavy guns, power armor is non negotiable for pve due to Stabilized. For pvp you'd want sentinel gear, so whichever you have for that.
---
Near Poseidon power plant in Charleston there is a corpse with a hole tape and that will start a quest called into the mystery
---
Id rather face the mirelurk queen cuz them fog crawlers be tanky yo...stay high up or keep an obstacle between you and them..theyre fast in a straight line but don't corner well...
---
The floating building is the only way to go if you plan on moving currently imo.
---
What?
---
yeah its impossible to hit flying enemies with VATS at all, sometimes ill attack, hear the sound of my weapon hitting an enemy, but no damage is done at all
---
I even get the "sneak attack damage" multiplier message on screen, but no damage to enemy! wth?!?!
---
Works for me, get out a piece of paper and a pencil, Record the amount of ammo before and after you do your ammo crafting. There is this thing called math, google it if you have to. You can easily see that it's working.
---
They all died in The Great Shishkabob War
---
Nope and I can post it on Reddit too
---
It is a positive effect..... for Bethesda.
---
The alpha one is the same...stay back and up...let the melee folks get wailed on.
---
The buzzsaw, sorry I assume it would also get effected by this build
---
Lol you have more than a few to go.
---
*Cries in has 3 steel*
---
Only problem anyone should ever have is cloth. With scrapper a single assault rifle turns into 20 steel, run through West Tek and you're set. As for acid a single snallygaster can drop upwards of 9 or more at a time.
---
I don't think he said *rolls eyes*, I think it was an action he performed. Since he established the context that it was performed, I imagined him doing it, and didn't think it needed to be quoted in my response.
---
You have 2 more groups of army guys, 1 group of separatists, a raider group, and all of the Overseers tapes. You have A LOT left.
---
Good luck. Great idea.
---
but they still will charge people for the skins.....  wth bethesda?
---
I could put my imposter Sheepsquatch outfit but I would look like trouble.
---
oh ......theres more. Just keep up the wandering, they'll find you.
---
if all youve had is lev 44.........oh yes.....theres more.
---
Sorry but Spiders are Elder Scrolls exclusive, they can't travel from Tamriel to the fallout universe :b
---
I just explained the cheapest PvP viable build. Its not the only one nor is team of four auto bloodied  sneakers meta.
---
*death stares*
---
Because I can't post a poll on reddit afaik, and wondered if people prefer quests vs the other things. Upvotes are the only metric available. 
---
Reddit should add polls if this isn't already possible.
---
i sold a 2 star exploding one for over 12000 caps 2 days ago, cant rememebr the 2nd perk though
---
I just put it in my vending machine before hopping off.
---
Power armor + a fire axe. Get the spike mod if you can (scrap them to learn). Power attack, get good at headshotting, you can literally 1-2 shot level 62 ghouls as a level 5 doing this. I was power leveling myself last night at whitesprings with this method.
---
So you're are saying.....
---
It is just another shitty legendary effect added to the loot pool to reduce your probability of getting a useful roll and extending the grind.
---
Thanks for confirming my suspicion.
---
At least everyone gets something out of it.
---
I mean we have Snallygasters. Those are creepy enough.
---
I mean... the reward is being able to nuke an area.
---
I'll try again next time I craft, but kinda giving up with it.
---
True......but it is vastly more accurate than the information that Bethesda shares with us.
---
wait, i thought this was common knowledge. I didnt even know people actually thought that budget increased by level. that would have been a stupid and unnecessary system to have if they did have it like that
---
I've noticed that fat man tends to be somewhat of a rare drop for enemies, and then I found two last night. If you're on ps4 i can come buy some mini nukes off of you.
---
Noice. I try to help others out and build stuff for them if they need it. Sometimes they have me craft and buy it off me for a low price.
---
I sell bottle cap mines so others learn the knowledge when they grab it.
---
Game changer for me with plastic was realizing laser rifles give 10 plastic (among other components) when scrapped if you have the Scrapper perk active (1 rank in Intelligence). Supermutants seem to drop these fairly regularly and you get XP and potentially some legendaries too if you hit up West Tek.
---
Disease cures don't work against the Scorched plague - their main opponents were a group of firefighters and paramedics who made it their mission to teach people how to make herbal cures. NPCs don't use legendary weapons, don't get perks, cannot advance their skills or gear: they are at a severe disadvantage when compared to a player character. Also: if you've ever been killed by a single Scorched infected animal or a scorchbeast you might have an answer already
---
I can't give them away at 0 zero caps, it's as if people think there is some exploit or catch to zero caps on my vending machine maybe it scares people.
---
I have an extra I’ll let go for 800. Psn is brm138
---
You used to get more damage resistance with armor if you over-repaired it too, but once the armor got close to breaking you would get less DR than what it should have.
---
It's the economy and I'm willing to get things done this way until I have two serum recipes for Marsupial and Healing factor.
---
Ad victoriam, mother fucker.
---
Did you run it again last night? I was on one server and there was a group of 30-80 range people the were working Alpha sight and nuked the queen....I immediately thought of this post.
---
Sadly I'm on PC and usually just drop them on the ground. I'd be fine selling them to a vendor bot for 5 caps each just to get rid of those rocks full of rads.
---
I think I’ve seen maybe 1 person use it the entire time this game has been out. Group of us all fighting the assaultron sheepsquatch. Whoever it was was super annoying with it and kept aiming at the people being the conduct or whatever it’s called.
---
Nah, no raging here.  Unfortunately I've wayyy too many IRL things I can rage about that I generally won't or don't do it over a game.
---
The loot was no worries.  I'm stuffed with stash, so I'm good.  I'm a serial junk hoarder and what I lost was/is easily replaced.
---
If it's not stealth, then do run a pistol build.
---
The weight makes it a non starter for me. I've seen people use them during queen fights, but I'm not sure how effective that is.
---
Yea my reply was along the lines of” you charged me for something that does not work , where I’m from that’s known as fraud”,.. waiting on response
---
Not sure what you mean, it could've been one topic if you just asked which people prefer.
---
I can see the effects at any camp. If I see a customer, I try to give them a bottle cap mine.
---
Ughhh, bummer. Yeah, I miss the single player days of being able to sell ammo to vendors. I was so rich in 3/NV/4.
---
Sneaky builds go hand in hand with unyielding armor due to how high you can get your agi / perception. This also makes them excellet for VATS, and by extension, vats crit builds. IMO your best option is to go with an unyielding bloodied sniper build that focuses on sneak attacks and crits. Ditch the PA. Really the only time you need to wear PA or hazmat is if you're farming flux / ghouls at whitesprings for mass / fluid. Even queen can be done outside of PA.
---
Now, if you WANT to run a power armor build, I'd suggest bloodied heavy weapons and go with the "hard and loud" approach that my main uses. [Build guide for that here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76Guides/comments/blw1y6/the_bloodied_heavy_weapons_tank_an_end_game_pve/)
---
Seriously? Of fucking course WELL fed and WELL hydrated are different, those require you to be over 90% each to get those bonuses and having to keep up on both of them is the tradeoff. 
---
The last time some idiot was running around here crying that Bethesda had secretly increased the thirst rate a bunch of us tested it out. With speed demon and without any thirst inducing chems going from 100% Well Hydrated to Thirsty takes about 45 minutes and full Dehydrated somewhere around 55.
---
Oof this scares the hell out of me. I love batteries included. My carry weight goes from 300 with it on to 900 without it. I am admittedly a fusion and plasma core hoarder though.
---
If you're a DPS build you might take it upon yourself to start dealing damage per second to your target rather than spending a few minutes sitting and wondering why inexperienced players, melee and support builds haven't followed your style of gameplay :~p
---
I just want to say that you really don't need a high end gaming PC to play FO76. Mine is +6 years old except for a better video card. I'd love a better rig but it's quite ok as it is.
---
It's fun as hell, the fat man, but that ammo weight is killer. Ordinance Express under str can bring em down by a huge % though.
---
For the Atomics challenge, craft 5 nukes, I had ammo smith &amp; super duper active. Immediately went 200 pounds over weight. Luckily had perk points saved up &amp; grabbed OE rank 3 then went out &amp; wrecked ghouls to get the 20 kills.
---
Was hitting around 1k damage with a stock fat man &amp; now explosive perks. Not tea bag.
---
Fallout 76 EOE *Eve Online Edition* with thousand online on one server at any one time... imagine the market, the activity and the battles. Even a few hundred, but &lt;24 what in God's name is wrong with this engine and/or servers to be so weak and feeble??
---
Wait does it really? Maybe I should add the firebases, missile silos and enclave bunker to my hunting checklists then
---
You definitely should
---
Sure, but the people claiming any ire about that bag are full of it and holding their feet to the fire because they can. 
---
Those people would have bought the same edition for the same price if they had used the word nylon instead.
---
In my experience this is pretty rare. There are 3 power plants as well. Try monogah or thunder mountain. People rarely take those.
---
That was fixed with Patch 9 nearly a month ago.
---
&gt; Workshop PVP: The following Adjustments have been made to the rules of Workshop PVP:
---
Workshop owners must now enter the bounds of the Workshop before they are placed in PVP with the contesting players.
---
That’s the thing.  Everyone knows about Whitesprings for farming legendaries or Watoga HS for farming plastic.  It’s really not much of a secret.  So there are times you have to server hop.
---
You need to get prime receiver plans for gatling laser.
---
blue peter badge for you, for finding someone daft enough to pay 12k
---
Now *this* is how you play Fallout 76!
---
Im a bit tired of people talking shit on single foundation CAMPS
---
the reality of whey we do this will become apparent if you ever try and move your CAMP
---
because its almost impossible if you DONT use the single foundation
---
so maybe stop and think a bit before you just spread negativity, we are trying to operate within the busted framework Bethesda has created for us
---
That sucks. I only just tried survival the other day to get the weapon and I did it all sneaking and unplugging my vending machines and logged out as soon as I completed the tasks. I’m not into PVP.
---
Follow the overseers quest.  It will keep you in more or less level appropriate areas and  teach you the lore.  Along the way, you will discover a number of other quest lines.
---
If you are looking at L44 type stuff, you are likely on Roses quest, which will quickly take you to areas you are not prepared to be.
---
At 17, you can roam around in the toxic valley - there's a couple of quests to pick up in there.
---
Recommend not venturing too far into the the center strip (savage divide) until L35, or east on the map until L45.
---
  There are areas that scale enemies to the highest level person around ( (lewiston, palace of the wind, Top Of The World),   
---
Go back later - the enemies will be easier.  
---
Lewiston is integral to a couple of different quest lines.  
---
Find Riverside manor to pick up another quest.
---
At L25, figure out how to do the Excavator quest.
---
Where you playing Survival mode?
---
Seems like it’s gotten worse since they worked on the servers the other day.
---
Hi! Thanks for your report. We're currently aware of this issue, but the latest information I have on this one is that it's a visual bug. Class Freak should still be suppressing Speed Demon's increased hunger/thirst effect, but the Effects menu in the Pip-Boy isn't updating correctly to match the decrease. 
---
It's on our radar and we'll let you know once we have more details to share about a fix.
---
You're the worst raider i've ever heard of..... But i have heard of you.
---
Possum Challenge for completing Lucky Strike is basically you buying 5 maps and going to that location to dig it up... not exactly a challenge or a quest...
---
[Hey kid, what u buying? ](https://imgur.com/gallery/i727qqf)
---
I know you said this five months ago, but morgantown high school is a great place for plastic. The cafeteria has TONS. I've also read Watoga high school is the same way.
---
I mean, everyone in this game is a dps build. There aren't "roles". Never have I seen a "healer", though you could make a build for that. I've seen a melee "tank", but that's one guy out of 10+, and I can face tank her myself while also doing great dps.
---
I also can't get enough of it! When you realize you can hit almost anywhere on the map, you start to see all the possibilities! =]]
---
First, I don't know why you're so mad about this. Second, this is untrue. It's about 10 minutes. I could easily go through 20 purified waters in a couple hours. Maybe more.
---
It is my understanding that they most people respond to reddit posts with an upvote or downvote, and only respond with a comment if they have something specific to add.
---
I was attempting a poll of upvotes
---
Bloodied is a way of life. Knocking on deaths door and delivering another soul.
---
You don't have to go all out of the build either to have phychotic damage either. I'm still running Wright reduction perks and still deal out 1400 plus on the unstoppable monster.
---
There's alot of room to play with bloodied, as far as armor and perks go there's soany different ways to set it up.
---
Once you get up above 600 or so damage you damn near 1 hitting most all enemies. I ran my super sledge at about 1k for a while and never thought twice and running up on an enemy.
---
Yeah but now I know.

---
Also have on super duper when crafting for that 30% chance to double your output.
---
I try to always have access to a fatman in my stash, or to keep a weightless or Daiseycutter onhand. The Guarantee (precious survival legendary) is a fantastic way to deal with mobs as any that haven't been removed from the game are suddenly laying on the floor or at best hobbling towards you
---
No you couldn't, you are not even considering labor or any other cost other than material here.
---
I thought it was a visual glitch until I sold a few thousand rounds &amp; got about 100 caps in my Pip-Boy screen.
---
If I didn't want the stash space back, I'd probably pull em from vending.
---
ahhaha Well... that's a great question! Now I wanna try it!!!!
---
From my understanding the items NOT in containers are generated based on whether the player to first enter the area has looted them in the past 20 (or maybe its 24?) hours. I got this based on advice I read on this subreddit that if you have 2 players working together (or 1 player with 2 accounts) you can workaround the cooldown by having 1 player join a server, go to the area you want to loot to verify the desired loot is there, then having the 2nd player join in and grab it. The 1st player then server hops and you repeat the process.
---
I haven't tried to utilize this process myself as I prefer to kill enemies that drop the resources I need rather than server hop, so I can't say definitively that it works, but maybe give that a try.
---
Havent touched survival yet. You think maybe because I killed him he hit  revenge or something, and gave him the ability to damage my stuff as well?
---
I used them in survival. Had a long set of stairs / locked doors leading up to my base inside of a satellite dish. To get to it people had to run over punji boards, nuke mines, spiked traps that would fling them off... and it was angled so they would have a sure death on their fall without bird bones. Good times.
---
You won't find Atom in the bottom of a bottle my friend..
---
I have been noting the numbers crafted and it doesn't work for ammo, at least not for me. Maybe my account is glitched somehow. I'll have to contact support but you can imagine the result of that...
---
Crickets...
---
Could you imagine the lag. Dear god...
---
I forgot all about that perk
---
Best character in the whole game :D
---
I do now and then just to goof off...usually only when solo’ing though. I’m not sure if it’s considered bad form when doing group stuff. I’m always in pacifist mode so I wouldn’t hurt anyone, but there’d probably be some loot lost from bodies launched into orbit. :)
---
SBQ would be a completely frozen lagged out mess. *shutters*
---
Part of the trick is that it's not that difficult to survive at 20% hp. Run Emergency Protocols in PA, or Serendipity out of PA. Throw in various combinations of Blocker, Dodgy and Lone Wanderer, or just use stealth. Because you kill stuff so quickly, you also get hit less.
---
The damage output is untouchable. At 20% hp you get 80% from Bloodied, 50% from Adrenal Reaction and 20% from Nerd Rage, all stacked multiplicatively for a 224% bonus. If you're a melee build then you'll also get bonuses from Unyielding and Radicool.
---
I stumbled across the machine. 🤷‍♀️
---
I have no loyalty to either of those factions either. That's why I call myself a double agent
---
Ah ok, was gonna ask about adrenal. I have a bloodied 10% pipe revolver, been meaning to look at the damage on it when fully modded with all perks. I suspect my BE handmade will still be far better for a vats crit stealth build though.
---
Just make a poll and link it if you really need one. Pretty sure upvotes and downvotes are supposed to be for whether it adds to the discussion or not, not yes or no, or even if you agree or disagree with something.
---
I agree that would be amazing and I really really hope it happens.
---
I don't know what's up with the servers, but before we do have 1000 people we need some major map expansions and they need to introduce instancing. If the servers can take it I do think we'd have enough space for like 50 as the map is now
---
How does one join
---
Um. Where? Do you remember?
---
Yeah that part is ridiculous. My guess is because they already made str so topheavy
---
I know, it really gets me all hot under the collar, I think we should just complain about their complaint on the FO76 reddit sub to make us feel superior in some way.
---
Don't forget the lube or you're e-peen may get sore!
---
It will NEVER happen.
---
These are the same players that always say "if it wasn't meant to be done, it wouldn't be able to be done" to justify exploits and stuff.
---
To this subset of players... it's all about maxing everything. Mats, loot, caps, dmg, gear.. server hopping, farming the same location 100 times a day... I guess they find it "fun"? and who am I to judge if it is or not for them. But it fucking sucks for everyone else.
---
Awesome build and a nice video - well done!
---
No. It’s one of the only things I immediately drop without trying to sell. They just weigh too much and no one uses them
---

---
There's my bloodied heavy weapons PA build. I never die. I do excellent damage. I face tank the queen. She dies in 3 mins or less. Other examples are stealth vats crit auto handmade rifle bloodied build with unyielding gear, or similar sniper / shotgun build.
---
&gt;!~~Soylent Green is~~ Iguana bits are made out of people!!!&lt;
---
Always have bird bones kids, and maxed adamantine Skelly.
---
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll give that a go next time I craft ammo :)
---
Nice! I appreciate people like you!
---
I'm getting really sick of getting killed by level 200+ players when I'm trying to use the ammo factory. It happened 3 times last night in 3 different servers and there's nothing my lvl 50 ass can do about it!
---
At least let me take the rest of my ammo and go on my way.
---
Why is this even a thing on the normal adventure servers? I could understand it on the survival mode but why on adventure?
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
I'm running an Intel 3000 series and GTX 1080, by no means current, but perhaps beyond the means or build capabilities of some console players like my friends. My systems are plenty old, but my concerns are not performance, but that I have friends on PS4, some on XBOX, and some on PC. Not enough to always have a team in one game.
---
that 2 shot 44 isnt. it out performs my 45 and handmade, and thats without any pistol perks.
---
I am a melee build with all associate perks.
---
I prefer 1H over 2H.  
---
2H generally carries more damage per hit, but fast 1H gets more hits in the same time frame.  In general, that=more damage.  
---
For example, my weapon of choice is a vampire serrated switchblade.  
---
Weighs less than a pound, hits 3 times @ 85 per hit in the same time it takes an 8# super sledge to make 1 hit, and regens health while its at it.
---
IDK if All Rise is AA, Blade of Bastet is.
---
Thanks, I have been checking the numbers crafted and I'm only getting the base crafting ammount with no extras.
---
There have been a few suggestions on this thread that I shall try out, maybe occasionally peoples accounts get stuck somehow? Who knows.
---
Outside of the Nuka cola plant if I’m thinking of the right machine. I haven’t done that badge requirement yet but it’s a machine that tells you where to dig and starts a quest. There are two or three different levels, going up in price and I assume in rewards.
---
I only really used one to complete the atomic possum badge, other than that I don't bother with them
---
I love this whole post. I wish I could go on a server modded just this way
---
Found marine dense last night at watoga train station. Just raider left. Haven't found a duplicate.
---
I don't hoard but if nothing sells in a week, I lower prices. I keep repeating until I feel it can't be lowered any more.
---
Grafton, Top of the World (ties in with the Missing Link), Hornright Industrial HQ in Charleston (leads to random Breach and Clear events in Ash), Missing Child in Toxic Valley....
---
The whole game's a gambling system: will this 3 star legendary drop something for my build, will the purveyor's legendaries lose a star or two, will this update make the CAMP system unuseable, will the ATOM shop item I purchased match what's in the photo advertising it/ruin the item it's attached to...  Fun times ^__^】
---
PC but it depends on what is considered popular.
---
No need for the sarcasm. If you read my OP you'd see I have been keeping track of the numbers with that thing you call math. I'm not getting extras regardless of the fancy audio FX or icon.
---
Well, for starters you the adrenal reaction mutation. Which boosts dmg the lower your health. Then you have armors geared towards being low helath - Bolstering. After that, you're mainly talking perks that boost dmg resistance when low health - Nerd Rage, Serendipity etc. . . At around 20% health my build provides me with approx. 605 DR &amp; 650 ER. Throw in Sentinel (of which I have on all 5 pieces of armor currently), and you're taking/avoiding A LOT of dmg overall. Take the 5 Bolstering Sentinel pieces, in theory that should give you ~ 175 extra DR &amp; ER total and an added bonus of a 75% chance to mitigate 75% of incoming dmg while standing still. Those are pretty solid numbers.
---
I agree and I had some high priced items give to me for helping them out or just chatting.
---
You know you get the backpack by shutting down the AI then completing the event right? Not sure if it’s common knowledge but that’s how you get it. And it’s not listed under the quest rewards but will say something like backpack skin unlocked in the top left of the screen. Lots of people have unlocked it without even realizing so it’s good to check at an armor station
---
Suggestion.
---
Make 1 post asking the question in the title with the word POLL.
---
IN the body, ask them to uovote the answer the agree with.
---
Make 2 comments in that post each with its own answer.
---
Poll on Reddit now posted. 😁 
---
Just keeps everything in 1 post and easier to keep track of in my opinion.
---
Why not all of it? This is a multiplayer game. You need something to do for high level players/timesink players. Quests are fine, but over if you done them. So, no more game for you after the quests are done. It's a good mixture which brings success, especially good events are fun and are promoting teamplay.
---
Well that's kind
---
I have been playing since day one of the Beta, over lvl 100, and I only just NOW find out there is a food producing facility at one of the workshops?!?!?
---
I knew about the ammo facility and the power core makers at the power plants, but NEVER knew there was a food maker. 
---
What other awesome stuff have i failed to learn about?!?!?
---
I'm just a Responder getting by.
---
I think its haunted. I have never had this issue.  Then again, ive been at same area since beta lol
---
pressure plate and powered door.
---
You should be given the option to destroy her, after the quest. Or during, given you would need an alternative ay to complete the quest.
---
Same is true for the Enclave. We all are essentially forced into it, willing or not.
---
*activates stealth boy*
---
Not on CCP's servers I'd imagine, on what we are on currently it would be 'Fallout 76 SSE' S*lideShow edition* O.o
---
i guess the thing is that bloodied is good for pvp as most players are optimized to one or two shot other players regardless of there health so you want to avoid hits anyways 
---
combined with serendipidy you also get a chance to avoid hits
---
furthermore people who use vats usually use armor sets that benefit from low health too
---
i personally dont like bloodied either but in case of raw damage output it simply proves to be the most effective legendary effect
---
Thanks. I've heard that but it sounds like even more monotonous work than server hopping solo, and then you have to have the other person to help.
---
No.  Not all iguana meat is human flesh.  Only the iguana meat from that stand in the original Fallout is human flesh.  Fallout 76 happens before Fallout - so this iguana meat isn't human flesh as far as we know.  So you don't know - because no one knows.  Literally no one.
---
But she may just sit there and actually let us kill her, may be fun.
---
Furious the Dragon kinda sucks. Anti armor laser rifle kinda sucks. Furious auto handmade can rock. Anti armor firerate handmade will rock aswell. Bloodied rocks, but bloodied tire iron sucks, it doesn't mean that bloodied sucks, furious sucks or antiarmor sucks - it all depends if the mods matches the use case of weapon.
---
Tire iron is an example of thing to make RNG worse.
---
Tested it extensively with video proof. Trust me, it’s most definitely not a visual bug. Sometimes it’ll be the correct amount of caps and will display correctly as well. But most of the time, you get about 1/10th or less of the cost for the ammo, not 90%. Wish they would address this.
---
That's good thinking. I don't use blueprints enough
---
Two on my main account, 133 bloodied melee &amp; 154 bloodied rifleman. Rifleman didn't start out bloodied but after making the melee character I couldn't resist the absurd damage output &amp; I had already adapted to the glass cannon playstyle. 
---
Second account has a level 15 mule that I may someday develop for others to play with when they're over, if so inclined.
---
Just buy all 3 maps, they’re called different things like miners map, excavator map and something else... it will place a circle ⭕️ on your map in the ash pit to go to and dig it up. Gives you a bunch of scrap and completes 1 of 5... do it 4 more times.
---
Ad victoriam, soldier.
---
&gt; doors that swing out
---
ask *The Dude* how that went.
---
Oh yikes, that's pretty terrible then D:
---
So have I, that's the weird thing, I never had this issue until now, I have a giant rock coming through the ground of my living room T_T
---
BoS, more like  PoS, amirite?
---
Noice. Really enjoyed the commentary in the video too :)
---
I use all the explosives. The AGL is surprisingly powerful against anything. I use my nukes with an instigating experimental MIRV, usually best against annoying things like glowing gulpers. A targeting missile launcher is really helpful for taking out scorchbeasts or cargobots. As long as you stay aimed down, the range of the lock-on is actually impressive
---
They make sense from a improvisation standpoint, but I'd rather spend an hour building something sensible that call a gimp fortress my home tbh
---
I like all of it.
---
I like a balance. Some of the events are fun.
---
This makes sense and we need help each other out times. I even give excess stuff if I feel they deserve it.
---
I use energy weapons almost exclusively with one of my characters... 
---
They seem fine to me. They get the job done, and they keep getting better as I progress.  I have noticed that energy resistance on enemies often seems higher than ballistic, though.
---
I do. I always have Daisycutter on me, so I'll launch a one when I see a group of enemies. Best without the MIRV and in VATS, preferably through a crit.
---
There's no paints for the combat helmet but you can either mod your combat armor to shadowed or Brotherhood of Steel for that darker look.
---
I think the fact that there are literally hundreds of thousands of objects that have unique values that are logged via databasing that be picked up edited and manipulated in a "single player" engine makes it more impressive that they got this to work with 24 to 32 people per server.
---
Tho I hope with future updates they create areas that can support more people such as special server worlds for like a massive cave system or city.
---
25% fire rate doesn't work on black powder and single action revolvers. Stalkers takes melee from a 95% hot chance to 100% at the cost  of 50% AP.
---
Quad is insanely awesome on black powder and Fatman launchers ...........wait......... nevermind Bethesda took time to ensure that you can't roll quad on a Fatman or a black powder.
---
That might have been my camp. If so, thank you.
---
I know sometimes I'll intentionally place an item to remove a boulder/tree/shrub, and the cheeky git will be back when I log in later. Kinda gave up on it.
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/U-Mine-It!\_vending\_machine](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/U-Mine-It!_vending_machine)

Well, its called a wasteland for a reason
---
Like the loading from the camera launch glitch all over again
---
Damn that sucks. I would love a camp update instead of a gun update
---
Everyone has their own system. It's not bad.
---
 This one ain't about me. It's about this friend... that I have... who is not me.
---
I just double-checked the patch notes and he was able to trash your camp because you retaliated against him.  Once you  VATS killed him, you became hostile to one another.  Per the Patch 9 notes:
---
&gt; C.A.M.P. objects and Structures no longer take damage from other players *as long as the defending player, and their C.A.M.P. defenses, are not hostile against their attackers.* 
---
(emphasis on the last half of the statement was mine)
---
Hell to nuh-uh bruh!  ;)
---
But its as per tradition that explosives always suck in fo games.
---
Can't say I'm surprised. I can't complete the Mistress of Mystery quest line because I lost the CRYPTOS login (no idea how a quest item gets dropped/lost) and was told essentially the same thing.
---
Handmade has the most kick. It doesn't have a recon scope tho.
---
Combat is the best vats-focused rifle. Also better handling than handame, my personal favorite and I have all godrolled handmades too.
---
Assault is the most reliable when you shoot an enemy far away and want to shoot them quick, it has an excellent recoil unmatched by other rifles. Kinda niche usage, for when range is longer than vats enables.
---
Radium has additional effect that goes through armor. Hard to mod.
---
Laser can trigger additional effects multiple times via beam splitter mod.
---
It's the standard point where people run into trouble though. The Mistress of Mysteries quests naturally drag you into Whitesprings at around level 20 if you don't get heavily sidetracked by events and workshops.
---
Consider it an early introduction to the endgame. Stop following the questlines for a bit, and bum around collecting stuff and doing events instead. Maybe have a look at the challenges.
---
I remember that scene. Still makes me chuckle.
---
Still there was something about the centaurs that's made me want to avoid them at all cost
---
Which in particular? I love this game but the events feel really uninspired to me
---
Looks like from those downvotes, you're the one who is lame and sad.
---
I tend to hang out at my camp more now. It's not a bad life style at times. I tend to have players take out the enemies and at rare chances they repair my stuff.
---
Agreed, agreed, and agreed the last one sucks. I personally think that in order to make legendaries feel less shitty each weapon should have only selected pool of possible mods and none of those should suck/be indisputably useless.
---
What if nuclear winter replaces survival? Not saying it will but it is a possibility
---
It boosts your range damage in an indirect way if you use critical VATS. PER for accuracy, AGI for AP, LCK for faster crit gain. With Gun-Fu, just hold both the fire button and crit button together and the game becomes a single turn rpg.
---
That's probably it. Or just forget to spec energy.
---
Honestly, these types of “Bethesda please” posts are the only ones that I upvote. Yeah a Vault-Tec lunchbox for dropped items would be cool, and so many other things, but the “hey, here’s a bug hindering lots of people’s progress and you should fix it” posts are much more wanted than other things.
---
I get some who clear out enemies or repair stuff at times.
---
Ad Victoriam brother.
---
There are very few junk items you actually NEED. Its trash you pick up and store for a project down the line that you are also pi king up more scrap for while you wait for said mysterious project. Than your stash is full of shit you dont need. Than you're on here bitching about how the stash needs to be expanded. 
---
It's just trash. I dont even bother chasing down my bag most of the time when I die. There's always more and more trash to pick up along the way.
---
Not a bad setup.
---
That's kind of what I was thinking. Plus, if I put 15 into Luck and take all the crit perks, I'm assuming you'd be stacking some big damage on headshots.
---
So many comments that explain the build really well. Just here to say consider switching to it. I went 700hrs as an all around melee build then switched to bloodied melee. It’s a world of difference. With the right perks you can avoid dying in a lot of situations (blocker, serendipity, mysterious savior, etc.). The sheer damage output is insane, I can kill Sheepsquatch myself in 2-5 hits (depending on health regen) without ever worry about dying. It’s definitely an OP build
---
Teamwork makes the dream work!
---
I sort of do that sometimes and I apologize if it has bothered anyone. I usually just hop on the roof and stand around if I'm there already as I like to be in the area in case someone has a question or wants to haggle.
---
The nuclear blast destroyed the land, not manners!
---
My husband can get it to work every time for everything. I’m lucky to get it to work even once.
---
That's makes sense because you want to assist them at times.
---
I thought only one other teammate was needed for Strange in Numbers to work? It's only a 1 star card also, so it's always maxed
---
Powered doors look shit and the whole set up takes a fair amount of budget
---
Had an issue that resulted in me not getting the token for my backpacker challenge, got told the same thing.
---
Works for me to. How many rounds you making a go. I find often super duper doesn't work on first couple of crafts. I think the probability is abit lower on 1st couple. Try mass production, like minimum 10 simultanious crafts and see if it triggers.
---
Wish they'd separate aid into a 3 tabs for food, drink and medicine. Also need more favorite slots; no room for food for me. The main reason I don't do Junky builds is no room for all the chems.
---
Actually I remember mobs being significantly easy to deal with until the mid 20s where gear/perks started to become more important due too tge sudden increase in bullet spongeyness
---
Drinking water straight from sources gives +15 rads a pop. Or down some toxic goo, that's +150 rads str8 to the dome lol. After awhile you get a feel for the sweet spot, as far as rads go. And like mentioned by many before, Radicool turns rads into a +, as by boosting your STR you get more carry weight too.
---
Damn gotta read the fine print on some of these more complex recipes!
---
Quest for the WIN
---
I was gonna say... is there *any* Broadsider worth keeping?  Probably not.  Not to mention the ridiculous weight of both the weapon and its one-off ammo.
---
Have you tried that recently? I got it placed like that from long ago but it wasn't working for my recently created alt, including campfire planting.
---
I like quests and random exploration in games.
---
I was playing a another game until I started FO76 recently. The other game has long, involved quests that will grab you emotionally. It has deep lore and well developed NPCs. I think the game is really well done.  I didn't exhaust all the existing content though and I'll probably go back to that game world in the future and try roleplaying another type of character. 
---
After finishing one of the possible main quest endings and doing more than half of the side quests (150 hours), I felt it would be good to move on and try a new game. I'm glad that there many good games out there.
---
What food factory workshop are you talking about?
---
There is a coming back to fallout section at the top of this sub, read it... Has all the information you're looking for.
---
It is definitely not the "last hit" scenario. Friend and I two manned the SBQ. Only two people there; neither of us got the credit for the kill.
---
I like Breach and Clear, One Violent Night is good for exp/legendary farming. Arktos Pharma is great if you get at least a few people. Theres another one I cant remember that ends with a missile strike from modus. 
---
Oh yeah and the Brahmim herding is good at the end.
---
I've build my camp near mole miners camp and almost everytime one of them has missile launcher. Now I have more than 100 missiles,  trying to find legendary launcher with some sweet abilities. However IMO even with maxed demolition expert launchers deal quite low damage and need some love.
---
Anyway until now I have seen maybe 3 ppl using fatman or launcher more frequently durring SBQ.
---
What game is this?
---
Here's the complication though: enemies with the ability to block.  High-level Super Mutants do it all the time.  To me, that's where the Medium and faster swing speed weapons started to pull ahead of anything two-handed.
---
I used to exclusively use Blade of Bastet, until I discovered a 1* Instigating Grognaks Axe. The speed is definitely slower but I usually 1 or 2 hit supermutants and below. With the right perks clearing Whitesprings Clubhouse takes 30 seconds.
---
To make it easier here is the link

I want giant spiders also , they web you in place and slow your attacks for a few moments. Teammates could hit you with fire to instantly remove webs , or just provide covering fire while you recover . Arachnids eats insects. Could be cool random encounters where you find giant spider weds with blood bugs stuck in them . You kill the blood bugs and piss off the giant mama spider whom now has nothing to feed her babies . Make framers and shishkabobs useful, not needed but a good choice.
---
have fun moving it!
---
Yes. Large. Much better. Yes. No.
---
yeah I noticed a place like that was thinking of moving right next to shore it had a mud flat I could build off of and where people could safely fast travel to
---
So I watched a couple of guys try to destroy my camp yesterday.  
---
I was in my camp crafting when two guys showed up and were running all around my camp, looking at the vending machines etc...
---
After I was done crafting, I ran over to another camp that was close by to see what they had for sale.  Then I heard gunshots coming from my camp direction, I went close enough to see that the two guys had aggro'd the whitesprings robots and were standing inside my building (2nd floor) and not fighting back.  I could see the robots shooting damaging my camp, the guys would just run around the camp to get the robots to shoot at them in different spots (hitting my camp instead)...  
---
Couple of a-holes....
---
I dont really think your seeing the purpose of the post, Im not trying to make enemies "uber" Im making them make sense I.E being able to punch a robot being more effective then explosives? I dont run a min/max build and the entire reason I have a bloodied/unyielding build is merely to have a chance of taking people out on survival pvp. This led me to the realization that survival shouldnt really be pvp. It should be a high stakes version where enemies become unique encounters instead of health points with different models. Also my changes just make sense. Why would a deathclaw roar when it gets the drop on you? Look up predator behavior tigers/gators other ambush predators dont let you know their about make you their meal. I feel like your criticising without actually reading what my post is about and are just complaining for the sake of it
---
I guess Bethesda is trying to be too realistic. It's a positive effect IRL if you want to stay skinny easily, but not a positive effect in a video game. :v
---
Quests, quests, quests, quests, I chant to the void.
---
Cool thanks for the info, I'll check those out. Don't think I'm high enough level yet for pharma
---
Sidenote: I spose I'de of been easier to say; people will spawn in dead center of your camp.
---
take my upvote lol
---
Mic is a great idea until you figure out half scream Russian into your ears and nearly the rest haven't figured out it's always on so you hear their entire life in the background... it's very few who use the mic for actual game things and that's sad.
---
Haha, thank you. I thought I was going crazy cause I couldn't find it. Is it supposed to be hidden until you mouse over it or is that just an issue with my browser? 
---
Appreciate it!
---
Oh man, where I come from that is not a tattoo you would want. You a regular there, in Goldshire, I mean? #MoonGuard'sNightLife
---
lol @ the downvotes!!!
---
all for me being smart enough to sell stuff on reddit marketplaces
---
It's all good man, still a great survey regardless.
---
&gt;It really comes down to trying to convince players to not spend all their time hopping server to server vacuuming up everything in sight so players on other servers have a chance to visit locations.
---
Sadly these things need to be considered with the game design. Convincing players to not take the most efficient route in farming (that being server hopping) isn't going to work. It's the flaw with this sort of server model, where you're connecting to a random instance of the game world every time you connect.
---
Yeah I feel you I still freak out when a radscorpion pops up behind me. But then I marsupial jump and realize they cant do anything. Thats why they should do stamina damage!
---
I mean your aren't wrong. I've met some really crappy people in the so called 'Brotherhood' social groups. I just act like the sole remaining member of my squad, purifying the wasteland on my own.
---
Bulk junk has had the 'BlockSuperDuperPerk' since B.E.T.A. along with the Mistress of Mystery weapons/clothing and for some reason the Orbital Strike Beacon and the blast mines.
---
Then along came the 'brewing' patch and they decided to add the keyword to those consumables too because reasons.
---
You can get into the bunker and the asylum fourth floor right? then you are a double agent.
---
I offered the Interloper the intestines used for fasnacht sausage...
---
Still waiting for my prayers to be answered with a God tier item at the Purveyor.
---
I like story quests. Ones what make you explore and find things. The Claptrap's secret hoard style quests can go bugger themselves.
---
No one's forcing them to buy things like this, so I think that's pretty sweet that it sold for that much. Congrats
---
Love the false Sheepsquatch
---
Of they are at my camp for a while, i like to message them to see of anything pops out. If theybare nice ill give them a DQ.
---
Because the land is a waste. It doesn't mean you get wasted every time you log in.
---
I just got the game last month and I spent way too long trying to figure out how to talk to people via text... I have a head set but I don't enjoy using it. I'd rather just type. I was kinda disappointed
---
I'd enjoy challenges and achievements if so many haven't been broken since BETA. That should be top of the list for next patch. Fix all the challenges that I've completed but haven't registered.
---
Well..... it was never easy to me lol
---
After lvl 50 though..... only a couple of enemies pose a threat, or maybe just the queen and some mobs.
---
The Asylum just responds to military, not Brotherhood specifically.  So I ain't them.  Similar to the bunker, the military ID got me in and MODUS/KOVAC gave me a commendation and a title, doesnt mean I'm a part of them at all.
---
I, too am also on Xbox and had the same issue happen TWICE. It crashed when I fast traveled and froze during mid-flight. Havent had issues like this in quite some time.
---
I would kindly take the losing side, you can keep the winner.
---
But as far as I know, the plasma gatling is slways worse then the laser gatling. If this is a rule of thumb  it should apply on TSE legacy versions too.
---
Omg lol
---
Might think about my sales strategy and target group then
---
Nada, that's the last one
---
I have both.
---
To me the laser feels like it shreds more but it has way less damage.
---
Also, the plasma breaks too fast
---
I'm new to the game like a level 23 and sometimes 300+ players will try to interact with me and I always run away because I'm scared... I guess I never figured they might be trying to help me..
---
Even my 3 year old has good ideas once in a while
---
That makes sense but theres no way I’m moving my camp again lol.
---
There are hardly any quests since the first release. Like an hour or two. A mixture is fine, but not this.
---
Cause youre an asshat
---
I agree I feel like with enemies having more distinct niches and weaknesses/strengths it would keep people from being able to one man army all the way across the map alone and make different weapons not as common more used like Broadsider(robots)/Harpoon gun(Mirelurks)/Flamer(ghouls/insects)
---
Thanks for the breakdown. I was curious about what the stats would be, approximately.
---
Ok so what was that game?????
---
New player, do I have to do something to make pacifist mode be on?
---
I just gave a 3* furious exploding 50cal to a dude the other day. There were a bunch of us hanging out at someone's camp by the Whitespring station, a few people needed the revive quest, so I volunteered to die and this level 35 dude was was saying he hadn't found any decent legendaries since level 15 or so, so I offered him the aforementioned gun. It happened to be level 35, so it seemed like the right thing to do.
---
Clearly your better off playing single player and rethinking how to get along with people online
---
Had a similar problem with my beta character, they told me to kick rocks essentially.
---
I *used* to have a 3* TSE Gatling Laser (Blame Bethesda for their apparent inability to program items that don't just disappear and cannot return lost items to players, they would owe me like thousands of pounds of gear).
---
With the charging barrels, the Gatling Laser could crank out high damage with a slow fire rate, which made it optimal for killing just about everything, but incredible with one-shotting low level enemies.
---
It really depends on your preference of whether or not you want high damage in a low fire rate or high DPS with a ridiculous fire rate.
---
Similar to the Minigun vs. Gatling Gun, really.
---
I use gunsmith for that reason. It’s actually amazing while using the Gatling plasma because it almost never breaks.
---
&gt;insert huzzah.jpeg
---
Not invincible to orbital strike beacons. ;)
---
I enjoy some events, but many are variations in the same thing like "protect the slow robot"  Protect missions are awful in every game. 
---
Even the events are unimaginative and shameful.
---
I took it off a little while ago because it said “reduces by 50%” but after having if back on it is a hell of a lot more than 50%!
---
I'm the same way exactly. But isn't it funny, how often you hear that texting is preferred to talking. I need a sociology professor to tell me why..
---
As long as I free to comment here, they are just a number.
---
See when I use 1 handed I get blocked easier. With 2 handed I bash the shit out of them and haven’t had a blocking issue. Maybe it’s dumb luck
---
This happens very rarely at my camp. Usually everyone spawns across the lake like I do. My original placement was on a rock that nobody, including myself, ever spawns on.
---
Probably situational though.
---
Cool thanks for the info!
---
Thats what you get for having a point of view.
---
He's a corporate raider. Buying out the Wasteland
---
Nope. I read it all.
---
So, to counter, since you think I am just "complaining for the sake of it".
---
I do NOT run a bloody/unyielding build... for any reason. 
---
I do find the wasteland a scary place. One that has the chance of kicking my ass at every turn. 
---
I do agree with some of your points, for sure. I should NOT be able to punch a robot into submission, however... energy weapons should trash it in seconds. Yeah, greater thought could be put into some of them... but, it is still a game, and with that, comes simplified behaviour and rules. 
---
It's the "bring danger BACK to the wasteland" thing I disagree with... it's there. But it's really easy to build that danger out of the game through player choice, *if you choose to do so*.
---
As for your "predator behaviour" comment... sure, some don't let  you know... and others 100% do.  it's a fucking genetically modified gecko for crying out loud... pretty sure there's no natural comparison we can make.
---
It does, but when you server hop solo you're relying on someone who has not looted what you're looking for having been in the area to spawn that loot, because otherwise the first time you pick it up you're starting the 20 or so hour cooldown for it to spawn for you again. That's probably why you're not able to find sought after things like royal jelly, which to my knowledge only have 2 spawn points in the entire map, doing this solo.
---
What Bethesda really ought to do is fix the whole issue of royal jelly, as currently there are 2 types, a junk item and an aid item. The aid item is needed for recipes and only has the 2 spawn points, the junk item is only worth its components when scrapped and can be dropped by honey beasts. If they made it so honey beasts dropped the aid version it would make it much more available.
---
Yes but not on a vertical level. It puts my visitors right below the original spot. Every time. (I put the camp module on an upper level of one of the skytrain pylons)
---
I mostly only do it in the nuke silo now but I’ve found it worthwhile to save an intelligence bobble and some brain bombs for these trips. I like to run them solo now and I prefer not to struggle through with my 7 intelligence on a lvl 3 hack
---
Where Jeff Lane failed we shall succeed! The Interloper will walk the earth!
---
I found leather dense plan in harpers ferry a few days ago. Im still looking for the others tho. I havent been server hopping like i was before but im still checking. 
---
  I also made about 50 combat chests and scrapped them. I did get one of the other mods i didnt have, but no dense yet. I plan on trying this some more later
---
Unfortunately some do and are telling new players that it does. Trying to prevent new players from receiving false info.
---
I went to buy some stuff from a player vending machine and the owner appeared and dropped a heap of stuff for free for me, waved and then left again. That was sweet as.
---
The one guy I have encountered this whole time who actually had a head set / mic to talk just... the whole time.. "WOW LOOK AT THIS DID YOU SEE THIS MAN THEY CHANGED THIS WHOLE SET OH MAN WOWEE WOW THIS IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT WOW DID YOU SEE THIS LOOK AT THIS" and I think it was my second day playing and I had no idea what he was talking about or anything and I just ran away.
---
I dont believe those do... but I just had the most amazing ideia now... thats for creating a new Death CAMP in my mind!
---
I was defending the Landfill when a level 120 dude came over to 'help' defend ( I'm level 140) During last wave he asks if he can take it so I emote yes. As soon as I'm checking reward lists he begins contesting and shooting me with an explosive gun. I ran popped a super stim got in PA and one Mini Nuke to the face solved his complaints. He then said I thought you said I could have it. People are weird
---
*"wadaya lookin' at da damn machine?! Arr ya gonna buy o'not - if not then off da potty - son of a Brahmin"*
---
I think this is why a lot of people liked the bloodied builds, walking around with literally 10% health knowing something can one shot you is a real fun rush, that on top of playing on a survival server gives the ultimate survival experience!...Sometimes
---
They need a categorized UI for the quick inventory so it’s easier to jump to aid
---
Events and workshops are a great way to get make sure you sleep in a bed every so often for XP bonus and there are perks that give bonus XP while in a team
---
There are worse bugs
---
Voice acting though, top notch. 
---
Love what the actor did, don't love the character itself.
---
I just think it's odd how the grass wasn't sticking out of it before, so why is it now?
---
Max rifleman perks and Max Commando perks.
---
The damage difference between a hardened combat rifle and powerful automatic is around 10% (in favor of the semi). VATs usage on the other hand is 50% less using an automatic receiver.
---
You will burn a lot more ammo using automatics. The temptation to just tap-tap-tap seems for me anyway, to always end up turning to burst burst burst.
---
I have ended up kinda bouncing between the two. For everything outside of BIG spongy fights like the SBQ, etc. I run as semi rifle. For the SBQ fights, I will often switch to Commando and an appropriate gun. Seeing as how I spent the first few hundred hours strictly semi-auto, I have a hard time internally justifying the ammo consumption.
---
I dont PvP so really have no opinion on it at all.
---
Can I ask where you began your adventure and how you're traversing the map? If you're travelling over to the right side frequently, or even through the middle (the savage divide) you're probably going to face some difficult battles, staying on the left side is the key to it really, I don't think main missions are a focus really, they're going to get completed at some time or another, just adventure at first, get yourself a set of armour that gives you a little extra resistance, take workshops, defend them, gain experience that way!! :) I started my journey by traveling straight down the map, searching everywhere, taking workshops, I managed to level up pretty quickly!! :) I'm now sat at level 165 with nothing that really challenges me anymore, I have everything I'd ever need really, I play more as a collector because of it, so yeah, if say enjoy the journey, and don't let the whole vendor fast traveling make you explore too fast, when I started we didn't have that so exploring was a case of walking everywhere, and it made it a whole lot more of an adventure!! :)) hope that helps!!
---
Do you think there were enough quests in fallout 4 to keep you playing on a daily basis for 6 months? 
---
There have been a bunch of new quests added, and recurring events since launch. And the challenges keep you busy in between. I'd say content wise, for the length of time the games been out, they've been pretty decent at balancing their new content.
---
People still play this game?
---
LOL. Corn Soup on a hot key. I farm about 15 corn at my place, take dirty water and boil it and make 20+ with Super Duper.
---
 Excellent food. ;)
---
I mean no offense by this but I know how loot works, the 20 hour timer, royal jelly locations, that kind of thing. That's not what the post was about. I agree about honey beasts, I think that they drop the junk version is a bug, but who knows.
---
you are in the zone we've all been in....too weak for the high level areas and too strong for the low level areas.  
---
The assaultron is there b/c a higher level player was there recently.
---
Leave the area and come back later, or server hop.  
---
The first several times I was at the HQ, it was mobs of L40+ super mutants; I never made it past the lobby.
---
On the 4th or so attempt, no mutants, just L6-15 scorched.  
---
I'd venture you still have the mysteries questline open.  
---
Try working on that one.
---
Have you done the Overseers quest segment in the ash heap?
---
I have a level 50 vampires grognakes axe but I can’t use it yet
---
I use a Bloodied Explosive Bolt action pipe pistol I get close to 600 damage. Pipe Revolvers and Bolt Action pistols can double dip on perk cards if you mod them with a rifle stock so Riflemen and Gun slinger both boost your damage. If your on PS4 I might still have a Explosive Pipe Pistol in my vending machine you can have.
---
lol...too much too soon :)
---
There should be plenty of side quests around, events give good xp and plan rewards.  Also consider claiming a work bench and defend mission for more xp and loot.
---
  You could also find somewhere with decent level critters like super mutants to farm.
---
  Finally try exploring, pick a different direction and head out.  Explore buildings and pois.  Finding new areas gives xp plus the stuff you kill while there.
---
We do live in a post-fact era after all.
---
I know roofs take up more room than floors so don't use roofs. I don't use turrets or any defense and have a 4 stories roughly 5*5 with all stations, food, 3 water purifiers, 4 vendors, tons of deco and still have roughly 8% budget left now (added more last night).
---
Dammit. I thought it was my day to post this demand!
---
Or was it my day to post the "place things on shelves" demand? I lose track, so many of them.
---
Is it weapon-specific? Are short melee weapons worse than longer ones?
---
There are health bars for each body part in VATS. That'll tell you when it's crippled (at 0%). She stays crippled for a relatively long time, but I'm not sure the exact length.
---
I can see how a mic would be nice for team play but OP is saying more ppl in general should use mics and it just doesn't make sense to me. If you are friends with someone it makes sense to want a mic just to chat about whatever or the game but why do all players in general need to have mics? If I'm not playing with someone I wouldn't need to talk to any player I encounter. So basically you only need a mic for team play which makes up little of this game since most players are solo. We don't need more mics we need more reasons to use one
---
The map is meant to simulate a paper map. Why would a paper map have a clock exactly?
---
I guess people just refuse to eat dog food.
---
 Yeah I loved that part of the leveling process. I may have played too much Stalker.
---
 Now I'm moderately god like and don't die much, its still great fun.
---
Level 15-30 was such a struggle. Now now I'm a high level god with numerous 3* death dealing firearms and as much materials and meds as I can stuff into my snazzy backpack. I'm still afraid of PVP tho....
---
If you say so.
---
Ground level.
---
It's always next to where you originally placed it not where you moved it after you built camp.
---
Moving it affects where you now spawn not visitors.
---
If it was bloodied that thing would have been a beast!!!
---
I built a museum in Sanctuary to show them off. I had been storing them in Red Rocket, just locked in the garage. never bothered to enlist settlers, build any defenses, or whatnot there.
---
I placed them all neatly, and enjoyed the view. Then supermutants attacked the settlement and I learned a valuable lesson about not storing them with a fusion core. Sanctuary is very well defended now.
---
This is not true at all. The spawn point at my camp is nowhere near where I first placed the camp mod
---
Each to their own, it’s usually the aid category that gets out of control for me.
---
That’s about 60 lb of batteries you’re lugging around *with* the perk by the way! You probably have tried it but maining the ultracite laser gatling in easier areas is a nice way to eat up a bit of your oversupply, mows down anything there at range very quickly.
---
Isn't enforcer a shotgun perk?
---
Oh yeah! I remember that one now. I need to add that back into my "check once a day" list, like the spot next to Hunter's Ridge.
---
One of the devs said they figured most people would do it at the encrypted event.
---
The "Lying Lowe" alone brought 7 quests into the game. Then there was the scout-quest, the brewing questline and the quest related to the camera. I would say, all new quests combined make up the biggest part of all the patches.
---
No one's noticed because its still working. Used it last night.
---
Got a mic?
---
Damage numbers is more worthy update than whole first DLC was, because this means we can actually see and test, what are weapons actually worth. This is going to be first time in a game, where you can somewhat actually say, that gear matters, because now we got feedback.
---
I'd say it's worth about 40 scrip.
---
If your using the dark theme... It's a bug that was just brought up in another post. Some things are hidden until hovering over it.
---
I think this is a good QOL piece. 
---
It would also be nice to be able to activate photomode while sitting down again - I have all these old piano-playing-in-a-shitstorm photos I’d like to start taking again
---
 I have a 1* TS Auto Grenade Launcher and I use it, but mostly on big ass enemies. So I like my 40mm. 
---
 Mini Nukes I leave where they are.
---
Agreed with your points except simplified behavior and the roar Why should it be simplified? the deathclaw roar! It serves no purpose except to alert players their in combat (already have combat music) and for them to get free shots. And yeah you can build your character to make it easy but thats part of why I suggest more variety in enemies and the way they intwract with the player. A maxed out melee build should at some point run into the wasteland it cant just punch away. A maxed out stealth sniper should at some point run into something that will get the jump on them first. A heavy gunner build at some point encounter a situation where he doesnt need a bigger gun but he needs more people with more guns. The goal is too add different strengths and weaknesses so that one play style doesnt dominate everything in game and in a way that makes sense immersion wise with unique behaviors and characteristics
---
I prefer the path that gives me the greatest power and wealth with the least effort.
---
Let me guess the third star was +1 perception lol!
---
not yet..looking into it.
---
All the same its vats orientated
---
Yup, it is. I meant tormentor. Edit for clarity.
---
Wow someone gave away daisycutter? That seems like the one you don’t want to give up
---
Level 175 or such. I dont care about the alpha but I'm down to play. Need both those plans so badly. I'll add you.
---
But now I feel like I know. 😂
---
Advice would be take the game slower than you are. I've found taking my time exploring each area of all that it has (lore/loot/etc.) before moving on leads to having fewer issues where you run into too higher level sorts of things.
---
Also, might have to do with how you play. It's not always a run and gun situation. Sometimes more tactics and finesse is required to make it through areas that are higher level than you are. Totally manageable if you're smart but can also overwhelm you.
---
The game isn't really that challenging if you don't rush it.
---
They don't benefit from armor pen perks or cards, and they do similar damage to their ballistic counterparts. So they're literally just 20-40% worse dps depending on the target.
---
 I took a Quad 2* off a Cave Cricket long ago and tried to hurt, something, anything and failed. ;)
---
 Sold it.
---
What spot next to hunters ridge?
---
As an endgame player I'd like quests, but what I really want are something in the vein to elder scrolls onlines trials - or just a lot of repeatable high level dungeons with a bunch of bosses that are instanced (which hopefully vault raids will be).
---
I would like to buy some butt drugs please Dr. Love.
---
I guess so. He gave me a bunch of one star weapons.
---
You're basically asking for a worse build than the stealth pistol one.
---
Lol.  Touche
---
Ad Victoriam
---
&gt;That's what you get for being a condescending dick
---
FTFY
---
Your username is not. Not one little bit at all.
---
Auto rifles are flat out better dps, especially with a crit build - you'll put out far more crits.
---
I keep redoing the world and daily events to level up.  Just exploring will get you misc. quest too.  I'm currently stuck on Minor Miracles too, but that's because I can't find any black titanium.  I'm level 35 right now and having trouble with the Cranberry Bog and the Mire, I believe that's what it's called.
---
It's not even just a PC thing.  I play on xbox and would definitely appreciate a world chatroom you could communicate with via written words rather than verbal communication.  You could make it not as annoying by hooking it up to the personal PC in your base.  Kinda like email within the game.  Would be very useful to post requests.
---
some one posted that this is what they got from the legendary vendor, and wasnt terribly happy with it.
---
replied back that I would be. 3days later a goul was persuaded to part with a 3\* one.
---
on balance, summerset is on par with it,but the damage resist is not to be scoffed at.

off the top of the head its 120, add 60% on top of that with perks.. oouuff. AND, the range is 204.
---
summerset special is about 75 but has 50% armour piercing.
---
10mm or 38.................not so much
---
Do all three need to survive?
---
4 gave me the diversion of building massive settlements, settlements that would encourage me to abandon my current activity to defend them, and for whatever reason I played that game for 600 hours or something. There were a lot more quests than in 76, I think 3 times more as far as I recall. There are no settlements now, my camp doesn't get attacked. In any case, I've spent the last 100 hours in 76 grinding and I'm just bored now.
---
Once I started hanging out with people who constantly sell legendaries I started getting really well equipped. It's dangerous to go alone!
---
THis happened to me last week. Dude had an AAE minigun up for 10K. I was transfering 2k caps from my alt to make the purchase when he left. Added him to friends list, haven't seen him since.
---
 The Blade is better. That said mine has not been used in months. I have sold All Rise maybe 3 times now. It used to show up at the Station Bot in Watoga. 
---
 A tip. Combat Knives are amazing.
---
My master spreadsheet says dense can’t unlock from scrapping
---
I love a8?;y
---
Says who?
---
You would buy a map eventually.
---
They feel worse than Fallout 4's version for certain, though with all things being equivalent, energy weapons do better with some enemies.
---
The downside is that there are fewer perk cards that boost the effectiveness of energy weapons.
---
Grinding repeatable/Daily Quests are a staple to all MMOs. You might not realize the amount of time and resource it takes to make 1-time quests. So its not a shocker they would make quests that are repeatable. It really comes down to execution.
---
As a long-time WoW player, the Timeless Isle (a small island filled with discovering, repeatables, and secrets) was a highlight for its franchise when we're talking in terms of questing/grinding.
---
Ooo Id like to see some sort of ensnare mechanic on a high tier enemy!
---
Well, my reply got deleted because I posted an amazon link.... 
---
My wife and I both have these. They work great, easy to shut off and were relatively inexpensive.
---
I bet you can figure out what to put in front of this.
---
/gp/product/B06XCKGLTP
---
Yeah I'm I'm the same boat as you. I'm hoping that they'll fix it with the new combat changes. But too often am I running up on an enemy or player and it stays 0%. But just yesterday I ran up on someone in survival and hit them multiple times and no health was taken off. Luckily I was quick enough to keep dodging but still took too no damage when my damage is sitting around 400.
---
Have you gone to Grafton yet? That's a side area for your level range. Explored all of the Ash heap? Done the Overseers Personal Logs missions that lead you up to the Ash Heap? FWIW, the mobs are scaled to your level pretty much everywhere. If there were high levle mobs, it's because a high levle was there before you.
---
It’s actually been identified in the very comprehensive community bug threads on this very sub. The fixes are identified for some things and there are a worthwhile number that are “keyword” issues . 
---
The Bethesda community managers have chimed in on them all. 
---
I understand being patient but not the deflection that they are not aware at all
---
I'd literally sell it for scrip.
---
Thats what i thought too! Someone in this post said they got it from scrapping.
---
Ah I figured that might be where I’m lacking, cheaped out on VRAM and only have 3 GB
---
Honestly, it was both. I was bummed about losing a dozen or so ballistic fiber but I really didn’t care about the steel. Easy to replace. I also knew there was absolutely nothing I could do about it because I am in no way built for PvP.
---
The kindest raider in all the land :)
---
It's important to explore the regions as you go, and improve your survival capabilities through gathering resources and gaining experience - everyone is dead - there's no rush to save the world.
---
Yea and like others have said survival should require a new character
---
Hopefully it'll be fixed, but I doubt before e3, seeing as the time before is the extreme crunch time for the developers - sucks for us melee builds :/
---
Showing the meters are one thing, but you've SERIOUSLY wasted even a second of the time of whatever poor soul reads Bethesda's feedback emails suggesting they either trivialize the entire mechanic by automating it or get rid of it all together?
---
I always built at the movie theate....I had a hall with them in it but I had settlers and defenses up. I wish we had more sets in FO76 I had a ton in FO4 now I don't see the point because they stay in the stash box. I keep Excavator and X01
---
wouldn't that be awesome! It feels like that should be the real purpose of that device. 
---
But I just don't know if Bethesda wants to get involved with the inevitable hate speech, offensive speech, all that crap that you know would happen about 2 minutes after the system was implemented.
---
I’ve noticed though if you do wait to long you get the infinite load circle and nothing drops also. I think since they took the servers off line a few days ago they re-introduced severe game breaking bugs again the games is running like crap at the moment . I’ve encountered constant crashing , visual artifacts and general instability through my play thru .
---
Raiders don't do property rights.
---
 The TS is invariably very inaccurate. I ran my Western Revolver till level 98 or so as its fun for trash. It hits around 100 and with a Long Barrel and Reflex Sight its very accurate to amazing distances.
---
 Now I don't use VATS and mainly kept it around so long as off handing trash is just cool.
---
Oh I see thanks
---
will check it out thanks man 👍
---
This is their final content to their DLC, so I hope they're wise enough to implement a server notification ASAP,
---
or else its not just a loss to us players but for the devs in the longrun.
---
FINALLY the answer to this riddle. THANK YOU!!!!
---
They're both fairly mediocre weapons (TSE is not ideal), but the gat plasma will win by a mile due to the higher damage per shot and same dps. I have a TSE gat plas as well. The only real use I have for it is to put the "shotgun" mod on the barrel and use it for pvp. It does wreck people in pvp. My B25 .50 cal does far more dps in pve though.
---
25-30 is a challenge - there are certain areas that are way higher level then 25 and the quest line if ran direct will take you through many of them. 
---
Pick a feasible section of the map and do quests / work on other mechanics to get levelled - you’ll find it’s more enjoyable then deathlooping quests
---
I originally put it up there, not on the ground level. I didn’t move it.
---
Is the problem that putting ANY ITEM that extends past the "border" of "tiles" (ie the edge of a single wall or foundation piece) causes this? I seem to remember early on that making a blueprint with no furniture, crafting benches, or decorations would let the camp be pretty portable. And possibly that centering objects within the confines of each square was okay. But as soon as something, uh, crossed a line, welp... It's like it's not the whole camp that support, but one or more of the items placed in it does. I haven't even bothered in a long time, though. Is anyone trying to move camps that are just empty buildings? Curious if that changes anything.
---
No problem!
---
If you are working Roses quest(s), it will take you to areas a 19 should not be.
---
@19, there's likely lots of places in the forest you have not discovered, and lots of places within the forest that are good for XP and leveling up.
---
  Go roam around in the toxic valley for a while.  
---
There are a couple quests in there that will occupy you.  
---
You can also start the mysteries questline, but it will also take you to areas where enemies scale. It is a multi-part quests.  I think I started that one about L30, and finished it about L54.  I didn't finish Roses main quest until about L55.
---
L98 now, and still not completed Roses follow on (re)quests.
---
Find camp mcclintock in the forest and start that questline.
---
Ta very much!
---
Do you have a job and/or a significant other? I find it hard to find time to play and I only one 165 level character. Thinking of starting over just to do the quests slower.
---
Ik I'm late but I play PC and the user so RyeMeraki. I'd love to help you with quests any time!
---
I had tons of junk materials so it dosent matter, but i think its a waste of time
---
Thanks for watching.
---
Only of we had a button to auto eat / drink if we found it in the world.
---
yeah for sure, ive spent so many hours on this game, compared to paying for one movie, the entertainment per dollar is amazing
---
Again, I prefer whatever gives me the most power and wealth the fastest.
---
I prefer grinding. So where do I go.
---
Not for the backpack no
---
We've  been running into the message do u own this game or app and it's really starting to piss us off. It's on both consoles and each there own version but often times when both are active one account will shoot to home with msg...
---
The added quests have provided few hours of adventuring vs tedium. Lying Lowe was like 30 minutes. Skyrim modders have added many hours of quests that rival the original content.
---
Bethesda could contract them.
---
The biggest part of the patches seem to be attempts to copy other multiplayer games.
---
if theres robots in the parking area (miner)....leave, hop till you find mole miners.
---
chances are there will be a ton of them, but they have titainium,...worth the fight. (and the xp)
---
that assaultron just ruins your day
---
Yeah I have a tse gatling laser and a fe plasma gat so I don't like the idea of running low on food for them :)
---
As of now, those who actually see and travel to the event, don't even care if the event fails, we just wait for the final boss to appear and kill that.
---
Originally Plasma Rifles were only able to drop as ONE star items and got patched when they removed explosive from energy weapon drops.
---
After that they dropped as 1-3 star items but the explosive was already removed from the possible effects in the lootpool at this point. thats why you cant have an explosive plasma rifle, but other energy weapons are possible like gatling plasma/laser, laser rifle, tesla, flamer, cryolator.
---
Id say enjoy this time, its the best time of the game
---
once you get leveled up, you will eventually get Op and one shot everything,m its not as fun...
---
so go slow, and enjoy the struggle while you can
---
This is not accurate at all.  Stop spreading misinformation.
---
Jump on it - it’s playable and fun
---
I hate her by proxy because the original Rose planned the ambushes for the Mistresses of Mystery.  If/when mods come, I'm going to scatter her parts across the wastes.
---
I use them. got bloodied AGL, fatman MIRV, and missile launcher
---
I killed a level 10 for the food shop. Then rebuilt it and made everything unlocked for the people.
---
Find mole miners, run the uranium event near whitesping every time it comes up and explore the ash heap. You need to scavange their suits, this is the easiest way to get it
---
I would welcome high level procedurally generated dungeons. I don't want to repeat what I've already done 10 times.
---
Exactly. I have strength to spare so I carry a set of T51. I wander around as Uncle Sam, and fight that way most of the time. In rad zones or big fights, I pop out the T51 with Patriot paint.  
---
I used to take excavator with me until I realized I was losing capacity that way. It weighs 10lbs, and my max capacity with it on is only about 7lbs better than with it off. 
---
With no display capability, why even own more than 2, at max?
---
Am on now and just friended. Let me know if you want to do some project paradise
---
Not true at all... 95%+ spawn in the water at my camp. My camp module isn’t even close to the water...
---
Its 30 bucks dont be a cheap fuck. I paid like 86
---
I work full time (40 hours per week). No SO - pretty much given up on that for many different reasons which are personal and I won't get into here. Also run a successful (15K subs) youtube channel and post videos weekly. I pride myself on being efficient. In the beta, while everyone else was slogging through quests, I was finding the best grinding spots and exploiting them, taking workshops and farming tons of resources. I hit 200+ in the first month, then I quit for a month out of disgust due to all the dupes. Came back when they started banning dupers. Been back ever since.
---
Ridiculous how long it's taking.
---
It's positive to show how to fix an issue that has been raised a few times. I made a post myself on the same topic yesterday! Live in hope!!
---
I was going to say, that's the way to do it.  Big Bend West to East, pick up everything including all guns even if you're overencumbered, when you get to the other side there's a set of stations outside the East tunnel you can scrap them all, I probably get 300-400 steel per run from that whenever I'm low.  
---
Get wood from Sylvie and Sons logging camp, and get plastic from the plastic pumpkins inside Morgantown High School (trick is to go through the back and you'll enter the gym, pumpkins, plastic plates, and golf balls everywhere).    
---
Those are all the stupid things I run out and then a quick run and you're stocked up.
---
There should be no more server wide notifications until they give us the option to opt out. 
---
That event can trigger every half hour. We don't need a notification for something that happens every half hour.
---
That's not a bad way to do things.
---
Can't argue with that logic!
---
Right... but my point was I was actually trying to find it without looking it up... there’s literally no clues whatsoever...
---
Such is life friend, I also had to read this.
---
Everything has a value even the spoiled food which can be made into fertilizer.
---
I seriously doubt that you are the only one shooting at her with a crippling perk equipped. "How much damage am I doing to the Queen" is a completely meaningless question when there are 12 other people shooting at her.
---
Wow that’s an amazing guide, thank you! I might have to try that out instead. 
---
For that sniper build you mentioned, what perks would you recommend I use?
---
Given that E3 is happening this weekend I think we are SoL
---
How would anyone know to buy it? Again, not looking it up at all...
---
Is it good for mostly a solo player? I love the atmosphere of the previous Fallout games. I don't really care that there's no humanoid NPCs in this game.
---
Posted on the FBs hopefully get more people to take poll. Good luck.
---
Bet them shareholders are freaking out.
---
I had a high lvl bodyguard too! :)
---
People have been propagating the rumor since B.E.TA.
---
It's rare to have that and it's good.
---
I am melee bloodied and that monster puts me to sleep from one hit when i am full health.
---
I agree that there need to be hints, but the link may help others.
---
That’s really interesting. So even low level turrets can really make a base a safe haven for players on pvp servers.
---
Just put a speech filter.  And dont make it a stupid speech filter either.  Or not since it's an M rated game.  Idk.  Either way it doesnt seem too difficult in the grand scheme of inputting a chat system like that.
---
I cant even get near whitespring, if its the area I'm thinking of.  Its always crawling with level 60 plus enemies.  And ironically enough, I can hardly find mole miners now.
---
I admit I finally looked it up and there was a small note about it. I remembered there was a mining machine at the Nuka Cola place and went there... sure enough once you buy and open the map it starts the quest! 
---
My point is that unless you look it up, there’s literally no clue, marker or way to start this quest.
---
*purchases lowest item and takes my leave to another shop*
---
Apparently not. I’ve had a TS reduced weight Fatman in my vendor at 100caps for three weeks. No takers.
---
Having people to help you is definitely FO 76 exclusive! 😄
---
Can you wear armor under the swimsuit
---
Thanks for the info! Are you sure about the combat helmet? This is what the Fandom wiki says:
---
“The combat armor helmet is a green helmet with leather padding. It offers no damage reduction properties and is only a cosmetic headpiece. It can have its paint color changed at a workbench.”
---
With the power user perk you get 1000 shots per core with the gatling laser. Compared to half that (I think) for the plasma.
---
Something to consider.
---
It's would help a lot to add your format. PC, Xbox or PS4?
---
Agreed! I had to look myself after trying to find it myself on my own. I’m just not sure how Bethesda in game drops a clue for this... like how would a player know that this was what they had to do?
---
hopefully something like this announced at E3
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1f253ff&amp;d=p02pp2e31cu0ir2a72an2ar2ao0a12lr2l12lt2lk2lv2a01c72sb0pd2pk2pl2&amp;w=pg2ph2pi2eu0a42s72ag2at1ah0ae2a32i92i44ib4ic4ij2i61i71ia0if2s12im0ik0i50iq2ie2in1ih2i30c50cr0eh2&amp;n=SBQ%20Melter%20SOLO&amp;m=2358bcf
---
Some of those players leave because you are shopping and they are already at the cap limit.
---
Fun for both! :D
---
Well you’re still young. You’ll be turning 18 soon and then you’ll be able to smoke and go to strip clubs and you’ll forget all about this game and the quests.
---
Yong Yea is.
---
\+1 PER
---
so far this has been the most friendly online world i've experienced.
---
lvl 13, not had anyone shoot at me yet. heck most are overly eager to search their wares to find something to give to me, without even asking.
---
worst i got was a thumbs down.  so thumbs up to the F76 community  :-)
---
i do wish more used mics though.. seems it's mainly just kids. *even at that; the kids are more mature/friendly than most adults in other communities i've encountered  ;-)
---
What happens in Goldshire, stays in Goldshire.
---
It has your weight,caps,atom points,and challenges why not a clock it would be easier on looking at the time as events and perks are based on what time of day it is. More usefull than seeing caps or weight.
---
Wait... how do they know where I am in the world? Just by scanning the map? I didn't know someone could engage PvP outside that green border.
---
I guess the simplest thing to do would be to mark them as an objective on the map if the quest is selected?
---
I think it has to do with the tax system. 
---
You sell an item for 2076 caps. The 10% tax comes to 207.6 caps. They round up to 208
---
I haven’t tested this, but what happens when you sell one round for one cap? The game can’t take 1/10 of a cap from you, so they take the whole cap and you get zero. 
---
Gonna test this after work
---
What platform are you on?
---
all i'm sayin is i feel like that kind of action is in the spirit of the game ;)
---
RIP teh fear
---
&gt;The downside is that there are fewer perk cards that boost the effectiveness of energy weapons.
---
Some of this  really seems more like a bug that Bethesda hasn't bothered to fix.  The Rifleman perk effects lasers, and it is a rifle perk. Tank killer is a rifle perk too, and has zero effect with laser rifles?  That makes no sense at all and, like I said, sounds more like an unaddressed bug.
---
Iop the reason it got more hate is because it not only came from a more respected studio which prior to this was legendary in the industry, but that from what I've seen, it was much more broken than anthem. There's also the argument that it wasn't essentially fallout 4 with multiplayer, but I think the backlash only got this bad bc of what I mentioned earlier.
---
No problem....hopefully it will be up soon
---
Didn't you know that Bob just found a holotape of a radio conversation from Appalachia that described selling people meat as "Iguana" to boost sales?
---
I agree, made a few friends.
---
Fair enough.  This is all in my own experience.  I've never had an issue with them.
---
Semantics, fellas. Administrative privileges are a bit set in a database. Identity takes place in the mind of the player. You can use the phrase "member of" to describe either, but that doesn't make them synonymous.
---
Slow vs Medium vs Fast. And whether my slow axe with a legendary speed boost does more damage than my medium claw does. These are the number i've always been curious about.
---
My apologies.  That is one of the 3 I have left to find.  I wasn't aware it wasn't in game. Also curious what platform you're on?
---
Iv seemingly collected my last log as theres no other marker for the next one but the mission is still open. Iv got the mysteries questline open,done the phantom part, trying to obtain the sword but thats at the springs which most of the time have higher level enemies. The assaultron has been there the past 3 times of me going there.
---
when i see one near my location i usually visit them and speek to them over the headset 
---
i tell them that i can help out when they come to my camp about half of them actually follows and i usually craft them a decent weapon as well as a set of armor appropriate for their level
---
sometimes its quite hard to communicate when i ask them yes/no questions about what they want but i always like to help them out
---
my shop is basically aimed towards low level or alt characters
---
No more of those challenges please!
---
Fallout has a long single player RPG history, and a lot of the neckbeard purists went apeshit went they heard it was going to be an MMO. Combine that with the stupid canvas bag controversy and a coordinated "Fallout 76 is trash" propaganda campaign, that was driven primarily by click revenue, and you get what we're looking at.
---
Controversy -&gt; clicks -&gt; ad revenue.
---
deal with it, remember when tse guns were broke for like 4 months
---
People were expecting fallout 5, they got fallout 76 instead.
---
Many issues at launch time (disclaimer, I've been luck, I've not had much problem with the game).
---
Leave it to Bethesda to take an mmo engine (netimmerse is what Morrowind was made on, then it was upgraded to gamebeyo), strip it of those features, then reuse the stripped engine for an mmo instead of a newer mmo engine
---
First I’d rather they turn the 105mm lens into one that actually makes a difference for the challenges. You can get a closer photo of a creature, but it won’t actually confirm/identify that creature for the challenge until you get as close as you’d have to with the normal lens. I had a vertibot practically parting my hair last night when it finally registered on the camera.
---
More than you know.
---
I can't fault you for that. Grinding is slow though.
---
When I hit your level I built myself a mobile assault platform. There were a lot of areas I couldn’t do on my own but I could get through using turrets on a support floor and a little cover.  I made it small so I could afford to toss it down and move it often. My husband built this blocky couple of stories base with turrets and walls we dubbed the ‘war machine’. It wasn’t as mobile but it kept us heavily armored in tougher areas.  It also saved us more than once when high level characters would wander thru and suddenly all the mobs were 20 or 30 levels higher.
---
I do explore alot i just put a marker to a place i havent been then head in that direction. Im limited to the middle and left hand side of the map which iv been to i dare say most places. Alas ill keep exploring, doing events and looking for good places to farm. Thanks for your input.
---
To be honest, it’s a somewhat silly question.   
---
The answer is always going to be subjective and biased.   Those who like the game are going to say “yep, it’s worth it”.  Those who dislike it are going to tell you that “it sucks”.  The truth usually lies in the middle. 
---
From a performance perspective, they have fixed a number of bugs, enabled you to play without broken PvP nonsense in Adventure Mode (if that’s your preference), and made improvements to gameplay.  That being said, I find that it still crashes and freezes every so often, but a lot less than it used to.   
---
Personally, I find the PS4 community to be friendly and helpful and it’s relatively easy to make friends and join teams. 
---
As for whether it’s worth it, it all boils down to whether you end up having fun playing the game.  And that’s something that only you can determine.
---
It's still buggy which makes it not very fun when you spend a large amount of time trying to get back into the event.  I've had several times I tried to go with a group only to have one or more of us unable to use the elevator or getting stuck upon loading in and so many other strange things.  You get glitched out and have to restart the game and then end up spending 10s of minutes trying to get back into the area.  It's a pretty interesting event when it works but like I said very buggy but you mileage may vary.
---
Haha for that survival challenge i crafted 72rockets. What a great times blowing scorched out of forest!
---
I like to hunt low level players too. 
---
I try to track them down and then I watch them for a couple of minutes. 
---
The I stab them, again, and again, and again. 
---
Sometimes I get on voice and just rob them of their food, but most times I just stab. 
---
I'm a rifle build but since they're low lvls I like to make it more personal.
---
I can see that argument, I just think a lot of 76 hate was over stated and blown out of proportion. 76 also fixed 95% of issues, while anthem hasn’t fixed anything yet
---
The road along the river there has random spawns for trapper's armor, grave with bone club, downed vertibot, responder corpse, or a suitcase that has a note directing you to a low level leather piece. Probably a few more but those are the ones I recall off the top of my head.
---
Well written my friend !!
---
I found a .44 ** pistol that gives a vanilla 89 damage without cards, AND has a 24 round capacity &amp; +10% damage when aiming. I carry it around for low level areas. I get to use up all those rounds of 44 ammo and save my good shit for elsewhere. Only 44 I've found worth keeping.
---
i dont know you, but i dont like you.  up your nose with a rubber hose.
---
Fallout 76 was much more broken than anthem? Are you serious?
---
Ahhh good to know
---
VIOLATION!
---
It has to be video if on PC, and must have an in-person eval if on PS4 or Xbox, but I'm pretty sure you'll find the experience... fulfilling.
---
I do and they run away a lot when I try to hook them up with loot.
---
yeah, i dont play like normal people, i dont even do the main quests usually, i just like exploring, watching the great environmental weather systems, and building my CAMP
---
Anthem didn't have as many t posing enemies and world clipping issues, so in terms of bugs, it definitely did better
---
Please submit a video tour to @HOAWasteland, and we are really trying to bring the show to PC very soon. $$$
---
Point being???? Believe it or not, people play raider characters........
---
I 100% agree with your assessment of the situation and just want to add that it really freaks me out that so many people bought in on it then, and continue to do so now.
---
I love Fallout 76 despite it's problems.  For me, it was worth it at $60, so yeah, I would definitely pick it up for 50 percent off.
---
Well, i am kinda stressed from people in real life. Is this next level of being introvert?
---
If you’re PS4 I’d love to do it with you sometime, I’m in the same boat
---
Grinding is the fastest path to wealth and power. Personally I enjoy it. Nothing more cathartic for me than putting on music and getting into a good grind.
---
Damn wish someone would pay me to leave a workshop instead of sneaking up to me and killing me with one hit while I'm trying to build turrets.  :/
---
It helps, and shows the HOA you love them...
---
...but for you, PM us and we'll set up an eval.
---
I hang around outside of the vault entrance or at the Overseer camp sometimes, but it gets frustrating. I can’t often use a mic and most people I’ve run into don’t seem to at all. Lowbies always seem to assume I’m there to squish them for their 7 caps, and either take off running or start shooting. Sometimes emotes are enough, and sometimes I just drop crap and hope they see it and take it.
---
I kind of like not having any kind of text capabilities in-game, but a more extensive set of emotes or an “I’m in pacifist mode and only eat ghouls” indicator of some sort next to my name might be nice. I imagine some twit would abuse that to gank the poor noobs though so that probably wouldn’t work.
---
Broken is not the same as overpowered.
---
Definitely, I used to be in staunch opposition of the game until I played it, it has so much more heart and character than it lets on
---
"Beta Tester"
---
Hasn't bandolier now come into account for minis and missiles my weight is drastically reduced if I have both...
---
Do you like to watch the light go out from their eyes?
---
Fyi, Super Duper/Ammosmith doesn’t work on ammo challenges, it count how many times you confirm the crafting not the yield
---
Yeah but that guy is doing this meal 100 or 200 years after fo76 happens.

Sometimes I'll put an item i DON'T want to part with at a really high price.... that way, i win either way. Also, some guns look great, till you kit it out, then it turns out to be useless. Like a .38*** explosive round vampire pipe rifle. Made it full auto, extra durability.... turns out it would completely break after about 6 clips or so. Sold it.... someone was probably pissed about that.
---
I would love to see more people in one server but what they have pulled off is pretty impressive given the pedigree of the code they are working with.
---
Overcoming the Atlas issue alone was a huge thing.
---
Good point because that's what i can't unterstand.
---
I dont understand why they are making it more difficult to build instead of easier. I have friends who straight up quit playing because building is so frustrating.
---
That's what I'm looking for! I'm not a huge PvP fan, so if I can minimize that, I'd be golden for this game!
---
I hardly think that comparing people who have a farming route with exploiters is fair.
---
Besides, most loot is on a timer, and server hopping to get the same things over and over just doesn't work for most things.  Anything of notable interest will not be available in the same spot for a number of hours after you've looted it.
---
Your issue isn't that people are hopping servers to get things, it's that some one person got there before you.
---
Agree 100%. As one of the few Fallout YouTubers that didn't jump on the bandwagon, I'm still pissed off at all of those who did. They grew exponentially for it though.
---
Hence why I never played wow. There are tens of thousands of games to play, so I prefer not to grind without purpose. Back in the mid eighties when I was playing Dungeon Master, there were times when I realized I had progressed too deep into the dungeon too fast, and stopped or backtracked to "train" aka practice and fight monsters to increase skills so I could keep playing without dying constantly.  The grinding in 76 isn't to further the questing, it is instead of questing. Right now there is nothing but.
---
He's only 28!!!!
---
He probably just spent the 300 caps on chems and alcohol.
---
I got it for $30 back in December and have loved it. Still buggy but so much better now
---
I play with my wife and we just ended up building our camps as close as we could to each other. Kind of lackluster, but it works. We just drop stuff in bags constantly.
---
They do drop them, though it is a 1% drop chance.  Legendary DC has a 20-25% chance.  I have gotten 1 hide off of a deathclaw in nuke zone in that pink forest area south of prime.  The other 2?  I bought them from a player, the same guy, who found 2 in a day and a half.  I've also had multiple confirmations that the green footlocker at Camp Adams (Campfire Tales area) in the tent that is to the left just above the spawn point will have it in there sometimes (the aforementioned guy found his second one there).  Go there, check contents and if it isn't what you're looking for server hop.  Just do not empty the contents or it'll be empty for a while no matter how many hops you do.
---
Wherever i see someone selling missiles, i know they haven't a clue what they're doing. Lol
---
This. I mean it'd just be so rude to up and leave if they are about to buy something.
---
As you were. There is infinite grinding for all.
---
 Depends if you need direction or not. I don't and tend to ignore quests.
---
"Comrad vault dweller"
---
I have tried to help them out and give them stuff but most run away without taking it. I don't attack them unless they attack me cuz that's njust being an asshole
---
Pretty sure its a serverside bug. Basically it seems like when the game loads in it loads the plants and area object then loads the building. But its not telling the system that you placed the object there, its just placing it there like it would with a rock.
---
Half the time when i relog theres trees sticking out of my foundations and other times it correctly removed them.
---
Because Bethesda hasn't nerfed it (rightfully) yet
---
Clarification
---
It places them on ground level. Won't place them on top of buildings or structures. So the game considers the camp to be placed on the ground and that's where visitors spawn.
---
Deathclaws do drop them, though it is a 1% drop chance.  Legendary DC has a 20-25% chance.  I have gotten 1 hide off of a deathclaw in nuke zone in that pink forest area south of prime.  The other 2?  I bought them from a player, the same guy, who found 2 in a day and a half.  I've also had multiple confirmations that the green footlocker at Camp Adams (Campfire Tales area) in the tent that is to the left just above the spawn point will have it in there sometimes (the aforementioned guy found his second one there).  Go there, check contents and if it isn't what you're looking for server hop.  Just do not empty the contents or it'll be empty for a while no matter how many hops you do.
---
Also, confirmed by some friends, Gulpers will drop them occasionally.  Had a friend who server hopped Gulper lagoon and got one after about 10 hops.
---
I had an issue with MoM where I couldn't progress the story.
---
In the end, the issue was the terminal had an extra blank screen that you had to click through before the quest would progress. Normally when you're met with a blank screen, you press the button to back out.
---
This. Simply this. Lmao
---
Pistols are only viable for killing ghouls, mutants, etc, and you'd need to do a bloodied stealth build even then. They aren't a viable dps option for SBQ or other bullet sponge enemies.
---
I did for the challenge but other than that I just keep in case I get bored.
---
17minutes waiting to get information about which system he is on. This is "coordinator" we don't deserve, but need.

 I love my knives but I never use VATS. They work so well.

 I dunno why you need Vault Assisted Targeting for something you are touching, I'm actually baffled by this. I melt ghoul hordes, start em' on purpose as then they come to me:) Stabby stabby FTW!
---
Players could hardly get into anthem without the entire game crashing. The instability was worse than what I have ever seen with 76. Not to mention the million loading screens to access any part of anthem. Disclaimer any one of these loading screens were almost guaranteed to crash the game. 
---
Besides all of that though getting into Anthem to actually play the game. You realize there is nothing to do and everything shown in the inital trailers were a lie. 
---
Anthem was a catastrophic failure, there is no player base left for the game.
---
That’s a neat idea. It could be fun to build a little mobile sniper’s nest with turrets at the bottom for when you aggro’d the rest of the group. I like it! :)
---
Been that way for a couple of updates now. Around the sheepsquatch updates if I’m not mistaken.
---
As someone that has not played since release and just jumped back in, a TON of new content was added.
---
I am finding quests I haven't encountered before, and I have a level 63 and 57 characters, as well as my newly minted level 21.
---
Could we use more content? Of course we could, but don't say nothing new was added. You want nothing new added since launch? Try Anthem. The game only had bug fixes and actually lost content since launch.
---
Yes? It's a bloodied deathclaw gautnlet with 40% PA damage. That's one of the best unyielding melee build weapons in the game.
---
Only 3 can be bought in a day. So there's a small artificial extension?
---
And yet Bethesda continues to think map markers are a good idea.
---
Yes Marcy did. But I have a strong belief that she was alway a bitch. And she using her loss as an excuse is what people like her do. It’s a terrible loss yes, but people don’t just turn into horrid bitches like that without already being one to start. 
---
Rose is a machine. And as much as it appears she has any human like behavior, she’s isn’t one. At least in 76 you get something out of doing her quests. In FO4 you just are stuck with her at some settlement constantly complaining if you get her and the rest from the museum. I’ve had many FO4 adventures where I never save the MM from the museum. 😆 
---
I guess in 76 you can’t avoid Rose. Some quest always brings you there I’ve found. So there’s that.
---
I always have the feeling when hunt down to a low level they run away scared as shit lol
---
At least the gift emote helps now a bit to ease the situation
---
Anthems problem was more content than bugs, not that it didn't have its share of bugs as well.  Anthem has so little content available that the number of bugs could never exceed what FO76 had due to just sheer lack of opportunity.  And thats what makes Anthem a far worse product and even to this day can't seem to figure out what it wants to be.
---
someone doesn't read patch notes.......
---
How do you scout out for invisible enemies that shoot silent invisible instakill lasers?
---
Hehe, "cap"italism...
---
My character are is named CRISIS
---
Lmao
---
Youre both an asshat and a shitty raider for firing a warning shot, also a couple sidenotes, i already made my point about you being a douche in my reply, secondly roleplaying as a raider is just a cop out for lacking social skills and treating fallout like an apocalyptic COD, just go play cod 4 you fuckin prick
---
I'll have to give that a shot later today, thanks!
---
The vault stole all the best and brightest. 😶
---
But you do understand that fallout 76 is not a hyper realistic post apocalyptic survival simulator and will never be?
---
Berry Mentats, targeting HUD, the higher the perception the wider the area they are shown on the compass map... there are plenty of ways
---
It was a Fallout title nobody expected to happen for 5 more years. So when they revealed it at E3 hype was masively "Fallout 5 online!" and Bethesda was saying " No....like fallout 4.5 , seriously this baby steps for us...we improved lighting, graphics, mapsize and added online + the c.a.m.p feature. It's not Fallout 5" and then youtube switched to " Fallout 76 is terrible. " Even pre B.E.T.A release.

how can you tell the difference between a legit low level player and a mule acct ?
---
Let's call it "Typhoid Mary".
---
well played
---
Yeah. It’s amazing.
---
They have removed the ability for other players to destroy your CAMP, restricted PvP for workshops to the workshop zone only (used to be anywhere on the map), and you can turn on Pacifist mode so you don’t accidentally harm other players and it protects from them. 
---
So, you can pretty much avoid PvP and ignore griefers now.
---
If only we had a a device to do such a thing! It could be like a board with lots of letters on it. You could press the letter and the letter would appear on the screen, then you could make sentences and communicate with other players! 
---
nah - sounds dumb, itll never catch on.

Equip the Endurance perk "Good Doggy" then throw on the luck perk "Can Do!" and do a lap around Whitesprings searching all the trash cans. Hit the main building, the clubhouse, the pool next door, then go into the Enclave area. There's so many trash cans that you'll have more dog food than you'll know what to do with. 
---
I bound 7 to dog food and 8 to purified water and I haven't run out of food or had to change the binds in months.
---
I found out today that if you join a defend the workshop event and player starts a take over everyone is marked as hostile.
---
 Fuck those duped tse laser rifles. It's the tse shotgun pre-nerf all over again.
---
I prefer the long-winded, earn-as-you-go-and-be-pleasantly-surprised -with-completion route. This goes with saying these mechanics only work in a game that has things to do while venturing along the path. So it'll require quests but rather repeatable daily quests and events with rare drops. This way there's a reason to keep doing those events and if there's a variety, it won't get bland fast.
---
As it is right now, there are a few daily quests that do reset and the 3 from the planner as well as at least one event going on. While I do these things, I'll keep an eye out for hot dogs and deathclaw hides. I'm busy and having fun with the variety but it won't be enough for too long. The other daily quests **need** to be fixed. Future content needs to maintain the allure of rarities. No matter how hard it is to obtain a sun mask.
---
lol...dumb ape..

I thought it was worth it for the 40$ I paid..

wood knot pay full price...

That isn't right, and we apologize. We should have gotten to you. Let your HOA make it up to you by making you first on the list during our Weekend CAMP Evalathon this weekend?
---
I had this issue once just keep moving around the statue taking pictures it eventually registered
---
I am going to start the first chapter of the NCR this far east. We will be mostly incompetent, out of our league and will ignore other peoples claims to land.

Who wants in? We have a cool flag!

DDFFGG
---
My level 3 alt has a level 1 bloodied explosive hunting rifle and a level 1 bloodied pipe. He rocks adrenal reaction and eagle eye and would kill you in one shot.
---
Be careful out there.
---
I think he’s pc based on his older posts
---
I do that too, although I've had a few run off and be really wary of me, I spent 10 mins pointing at the bag I dropped and doing the come here/gift gestures . I think the dude thigh the bag was a trick.
---
GET OFF MY LAWN!!!
---
that might have to be a different game all together. I don't think Fallout can be designed like that.
---
That's not true at all: we chose the roll we want to play, and most people only understand DPS. There are high-charisma medic builds, there are crippling/slowing/staggering builds, there are straight tanks in power armour and suppressor's weapons; DPS is the most common build as it's the easiest to understand and has the most amount of residual training from other games, but there are many rolls to play if you decide upon that playstyle. 
---
Certainly, every build should do damage: but not every player wants to be One Punch Man with an aae dragon :-p
---
I’ve always played solo but I thought teams could combine camps.
---
Thanks
---
A missile strike? That sounds like a blast! Where can I join?
---
Agree with everything you listed, however I think that just giving enemies more armor penetration(Deathclaws and Behemoths could have Incisor rank 3 for example) and adding a stacking bleed/poison/acid dot damage to certain creature attacks could be enough to make a meaningful change in difficulty.
---
If I go melee a lvl 91 Glowing Deathclaw with like 450 DR and max lvl Blocker it won't hit me for much , but if I go naked with 0 DR it will probably 1 or 2 shot me. Also idk how it works but the acid dot that Mirelurk Queens and Kings do with their attacks sometimes is barely noticeable but sometimes it's so strong that only a super-stim will keep me alive, other creatures like Snallygasters/Honeybeast/Radscorpions should have something similar.
---
If you can push to 40-50 some of the good perks open up.  Also maybe consider power armor.  Depending on your build it should make you tankier.
---
Dave...
---
Upvoted for wanting to kill Modus.  That voice is the polar opposite of Wallace.
---
They’re all called Vault Dwellers I believe
---
I don’t know where you saw that price but I bought mine online from the Walmart app for $16
---
Could be, I'd have to test it. I thought it was connected wires so I unwired everything and it still wouldn't place. I did have connectors on the outside of the house, obviously. It's just easier
---
heh...hot.
---
Not sure why you are getting downvotes like this.  What you said is true.
---
Yes. Also great to do this when you see workshop defense events at spots owned by low levels. Maybe help them set up an extractor, workbenches, etc and I usually build a good melee weapon to fit their level. If they have armor, I’ll pocket mod it. Usually I’m more involved and helpful if they have a mic or emote or something (leave a little, wait and see, leave a little more, ...). If they don’t at least emote thanks or even see the bag, I’m not spending 5-10 mins helping them up their gear too much- just drop some water and maybe ammo and bounce
---
This did not work for me, but when I stood at the spot you mentioned right next to the statue and then took a picture of the statue, I did get credit.
---
I like doing quests most but I do not mind the challenges as long as they don't seem impossible, like death claw hides (arrghhh) or Alien pictures.   Events are  easy so I do them when I feel like it.
---
I think you might be a bit salty, due to the fact that you suck balls at this game. Maybe you need a hug from your mom.........
---
Hopping worlds *is* an exploit, though, and you won't convince me otherwise.
---
Yes, FO76 has balance issues... but... leaving a world to quadruple your mats farmed by hopping servers is *absolutely* an exploit.
---
Sure, it's not duping, it's not griefing… but it *is* 100% abusing a nonp-game mechanic, to improve one's abilities in game.
---
if someone "got there before you" in game, in server... well, that's the way it goes. Limited amount of stuff in world at a time.
---
However, if players are hopping servers, well then... you're simply 
---
that guy" to other players now.
---
Load in, play the game, log off when you're done for the day. Honestly? It would solve almost every "economy issue" encountered in game, aside from the actual, traditional "exploiters/dupers".
---
Hopping servers is the video game equivalent of "lets just print more money" as a solution to  a failing economy.  it just makes shit worse.
---
Forgive my ignorance, but how do you run low on food?  Even if it wasn't everywhere, just pot shot some squirrels or radstags.
---
An AAE dragon is an absolutely horrible weapon to use on SBQ. Just saying.
---
I used to do that until the vending machines.
---
Now I just put spare plans up for sale.
---
It's honestly got worse since I started playing about 3 months ago. There's no need to make things worse
---
I think its mostly sort of following a trend. Good thing is - you just have to wait till the next game victim comes around the corner.
---
Tbh - the beta and start were pretty bad, beside some other issues like canvasgate/duffle keruffle or the plastic nuka dark thing too... But as it developed up to now Beth heading in a good direction. Two Steps forward, one back, slow but steady.
---
What game?
---
Must have missed that patch note. Want online for a while around sheepsquatch.
---
Good point. We have Nuclear and Chemical weapons, give us Captain Trips, Bethesda!
---
I can't and don't know a way to do it. I still dump stuff on those guys if they will take it. Most mules turn it all down from my experience.
---
You can get it at Gamestop for 20.
---
Why does leprosy get such a bad rap when cancer seems so much worse?
---
People can judge things, on their own merit, without there needing to be a "well wuttabout…" argument.
---
FO76 was a hot mess when it launched. Anthem has it's own issues. Let'skeep that shit discussed separately.
---
There's another spot in the MoM quest line that is completely fk'd. It requires loading a holotape and wouldn't load it after selecting the proper holotape.
---
You can try but if it doesn't work, I had to drop **ALL** of my droppable tapes (some can't because they're tied to quests) and then load it in.
---
Nope. People are spawning all over the place. Even I don’t spawn in that original spot when FTing back to camp.
---
No worries, none taken. It wasn't clear based on your OP that you already knew those things, but it did seem relevant to the post because those things could possibly account for why you aren't able to find what you're looking for consistently. But we all know how buggy this game can be, so who's really to say for certain.
---
There are several that it pops up at, cant remember the name but it's an enclave event.
---
You obviously don't fight players or flying things ya I dont use vats on most things but it helps quite a bit when swarmed by bugs and you also get a lunge with vats that is amazing in all situations
---
Yea what we really need is that next patch
---
Cool story, bro.
---
I priced all known plans at 10 caps and couldn't move them. Are people buying them from you?
---
No.  But a teammate can build stuff for another teammate.  For example, I’ve been helping a lower level and I built a fusion generator for his camp since he doesn’t have the plans yet.
---
This is one needed QoL!
---
Hell -  let me sit down while eat and drink or let me sit down and play a round wastelad while waiting till the guy at the station vendor got his sales done finally
---
Rude
---
His name is Jake. I tried to make him look like Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven but couldn't get him old and grizzled enough.
---
Must have missed that one.
---
Just bought one for $1k Caps yesterday. Bought it because I thought it was a good deal and with max rifleman, it has over 1k damage.
---
Took out a SB with it moments later in 4 shots, so that was cool.
---
I play almost exclusively solo, and hate pvp.  There are a few things that you have to 'join up' with other people to do, but it's mostly big bosses/events that people just show up to, no real grouping or coordination needed.  
---
I've got probably 500 hours in since January, so whatever the price, it would have been worth it.  I did get it at a discount ($40), but still that's what, less than 10c per hour?  Yeah, can't go wrong  there.
---
It has it's issues, but so does literally every other game, and honestly the problems are pretty trivial.
---
I'm talking about the glitch that made mobs unkillable
---
Woah... RADiation King is true to his name eh?
---
Op: *Makes post*
---
Everyone who only read the title: "You are the enemy of the people!"
---
Hmm.. Yea I can appreciate where you're coming from! Come to think of it, I hadn't really considered that fact, as mine are going on my 256GB NVMe boot-drive since that's where I opted to stick 76 for improved load times.
---
I could, in turn, use F12 since I launch with Steam to run with the Steam Overlay *(for less-performance-impact on having FPS displayed compared to other options)*. That'd save 'em to my 6TB drive then... Thanks for the idea :P Will have to simply deal with the fact that Camera photos will still end up on the SSD either way (to our "saves", aka configs, folder) when having to take pics for challenges.
---
You’ve seen the general guide, but to get specific: 
---
1. All versions are definitely better than at launch. On consoles, the PS4 Pro and XBox OneX definitely perform better. 
---
2. Cant speak to PS4 specifically, but all platforms seem to be largely friendly, worlds are full (though sparsely populated by design). 
---
3. PvP is still a mostly one sided, whoever gets the first shots wins ordeal. Fortunately, it’s now very limited in the main servers. If/when you want to get into it, jump to Survival for rapid fire death and murder. PvP is not a strong suit for the game, but it can be fun in the right circumstances and expectations. 
---
4. Your CAMP spot is yours unless you choose to move it. It disappears when you log off and reloads when you log in. If there’s a conflict—someone else has the same spot as you—you get the option to load in without a CAMP or find a new server. 
---
5. My understanding is that the physical versions are just the bare bones authorizations needed to download and play the game, so no, not any difference I can imagine.
---
PSA If you see a Ring on screen... Run!
---
The missions are annoying and I didn’t care for them. I’d get them done just to get them over with. But that voice is so grating and awful I want her dead. I want to clone her a new body to put her mind in just so I can torture it back to death and can feel what I do every time I accidentally hear her because I didn’t turn off my audio in time.
---
So you can build stuff in his camp and add to his build budget, but the original poster and fiancée would only be sharing one budget and couldn’t combine the two. Right?
---
An excellent response! 
---
While it's one thing to compare similar issues, and can be done objectively, comparing the Hate for a game is totally subjective, and just aims the shit at the fan(dom).
---
Here’s the particular patch note:
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1GzFRJ3M5wmdnunkTDcbHZ/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-9-notes-may-7-2019
---
Even if there were more quests, they were trash. FO4 quests were predictable, uninteresting, and cliche....
---
Help the sassy conspiracy hunting reporter topple the mayor....
---
Help the android with a quirky P.I. personality defeat a crime boss with a axe to grind....
---
Help the upstanding patriot rebuild the Minutemen....
---
Discover who kidnapped your son! Twist! It wasn't who you think it was!
---
Untangle fact from urban myth regarding a super secret technologically advanced organization! Are they trying to help Synths? Or use them for nefarious purposes!?!
---
Help the underground rebel like group!
---
Sigh......
---
Dog Meat
---
LOL. If I were to have access to , say, the Nazi headquarters, and I came and went as I pleased and did business with them as I liked, I would be considered a member of the Nazi party. Even if I was dealing them damage on the side like Shindler.
---
Just sayin'
---
I use them to store them at train stations. Same goes for missiles.
---
The game is Enderal.
---
I’ve been playing since launch and I’m just short of 800 hours in (although many were trading and building), my main character is 150+ and honestly I haven’t been bored or run out of things to do yet.
---
That’s an awful lot of entertainment for $30 in my opinion.
---
So I finally found a vendor at Whitespring with a half dozen hooks... scrapped them all in rapid succession and learned the mod.  Finally!
---
You make it into bulked fertilizer and sell it. Also it's used to fix, plant crops, or to make grenades. I keep making grenades.
---
i saw a whole lot of posts about this, i made a post about, seen a bunch more posts about it. funny how the bethesda community manager hasnt acknowledged a single one of these threads....  
---
(puts on tinfoil hat, takes out visa card) Could it be because if we can't earn atoms we have to spend real money on them?
---
This is just the reality of online games.  Really, you have to think of the situation as only you are really the Hero, everyone else is just a Vault Dweller (just like in FFXIV only *you* are the Warrior of Light and the other players are just Adventurers).  And beyond that, online games pretty much have to have linear narratives, otherwise keeping up with an ever evolving/expanding plotline with all of thsoe choices would bring content generation to a total standstill.  Anyways, the main story for FO76 isn't over since they stated there will be more MSQs in the fall.  Who knows what that will entail (though I'm guessing it won't bring the demise of any of the NPCs currently in the game).
---
Invisible enemies arent shown on the compass map. Atleast not on pc
---
Also berry mentats is no a solution, the solution is to fix invible enemies
---
T-pose emote added to Atomic Shop...
---
Right
---
DO IT ALREADY!!!
---
&gt;And with the added bonus of ~thinking~ knowing you're better than everyone else.
---
If you wanted to do the multilayer thing, then I’d recommend:
---
Free states bunker in the front,    
---
The Sunken Church,    
---
Maybe some buildings from Harper’s Ferry next,    
---
And finally Tanagra Town,    
---
And then in between each maybe having creatures like gulpers, fog crawlers, mirelurks, and/or strangler vines
---
Exactly! I've got a tse one and I rarely have to worry about ammo because it multiplies itself a lot.
---
System?
---
Herbivore and eating spoiled vegetables is the way to go. For real, I’m level 171 and I’ve been eating nothing but spoiled vegetables for months.
---
I never worry about what will spoil when or ever have to hunt on my aid list for different items. And, you only risk catching dysentery after popping radaway -which forces you to chug water anyways. 
---
As an added bonus, when you get in the habit of hoarding spoiled vegetables, it leaves you with plenty of materials to make fertilizer to fix broken plants at CAMP. 
---
Honestly, outside of eliminating hunger entirely, I couldn’t imagine a more efficient system.
---
Look at what happens to people vs me
---
Three enclave personnel raided my workshop. Those bastard raided their generals home. Fucking maggots.
---
Oh yeah, i despise the floating camps. Looks horrendous
---
Enderal
---
I'd be down for that one honestly.
---
This happens to me as well! My character is REALLY scary looking. Like if you see him you'd def run in the other direction. But people are always surprised when I just give them stuff like food, stimpacks etc.
---
Where is this?!?!
---
Yeah. I would prefer quests to tadpole&amp;possum garbages..
---
I’m eating everything from now on.
---
Sorry I was slow, but it's been a tough couple of work days....
---
Here ya go, hope this helps :)

Only in Whitespring is it considered a lawn. Then again you are tresspassing on their property. 😏

There's really a lot to learn about this game, especially if you haven't played any Fallout games before. 
---
You should build your C.A.M.P ASAP and preferabely place it near a train station.
---
Go to falloutbuilds.com and look up a build that matches what you aim for. 
---
Use V.A.T.S for targeting and aiming!
---
Don't choose crafting perks until you've reached lvl 50. 
---
Scrap junk, weapons and armor. Bulk and sell what's not used.
---
I'm okay with a mixture of them, especially given that this is an online game. But I do definitely prefer quests and think that a world this large ought to have more than it does.
---
I’ll be on around 6pm cst today. I’ll do it for free. Someone did the same for me one time for free while I was deleting my mule and he only asked if the situation arises to help someone the same to do it. If you still need it later my psn is the same as my user on here

---
* Cripples
---
* Does enough DPS to carry SBQ fight with a bloodied .50 cal. With a B25 .50 cal, melts her in 2-3 minutes, even with 8+ non contributors.
---
* Can easily tank SBQ with power armor and emergency protocols, gaining 50% DR while at less than 20% HP (which is all the time). Her melee hits do about 1-3% of your health per hit, which means you'll need to heal with a diluted stimpack every 30s or so. Typically I use one when I'm reloading, which happens every 25-35 seconds of sustained fire with a B25 .50 cal.
---
* Decreases her damage output
---
* Increases her damage taken.
---
* Run with an endangerol syringer to increase her damage taken by 25% more. 
---
* Mows down regular mobs in the blink of an eye - even big ones like hermit crabs, megasloths, Mirelurk Queens / Kings, etc.
---
* Lots of variants you can run for situational things (included those perk cards as well).
---
* Can swap to an unyielding bloodied melee build with a few card swaps very easily.
---
The only other two builds that are worth running in pve are a bloodied shotgun build, specifically if you want a "mega crippler" build for SBQ, or a stealth vats crit auto rifle build, which is glass cannon as hell but does more dps.
---
same experience with their customer support. lost the quest items for "An Ounce Of Prevention" and cant complete the main questline now because of this. first i get a walkthrough as a response, then i wait 2 weeks after complaining i finally speak to a human who tells me about a Quest Reset Tool thats not working right now but will be soon to then 3 days later tell me: nah its not gonna work anymore, hope for an update that fixes the quest. Case Closed.
---
No, people are downvoting because you're fucking immersed in a survival game.
---
The call?
---
*"yeah it's interloper pizza your order? - a big mirelurk bloodleaf pizza with extra mutfruit? No scorched guano - ok - and a small tato salad with crimson flux dressing. Got it. We deliver in about 30 minutes. Cheers!"*
---
I've only teamed up like once, and I've put my mic on a couple times during events but primarily I play alone. There are events that pop up that you definitely need other players but you can just join when others are there already. I like to play alone and it has worked for me, I've been playing since launch.
---
This needs to be the first response to every post like this from now on.
---
There is only so much you can eat.
---
I like all that except the grinding
---
Tank Killer should provide 30% Ballistic AND Energy DR reduction, yes.  And the Anti-Armor legendary mod either needs to affect both, or there should be a new mod added just for energy weapons that penetrates energy DR.
---
Right now, energy weapons are a strict downgrade for most cases;
---
They can't be silenced, so forget stealth options.  Even shotguns can get silencers.
---
DR penetration is only for ballistic.
---
Enemy ballistic and energy DRs are, for the most part, similar.
---
Fewer weapon types, by a lot (even if lasers and plasmas can be converted from pistol to rifle to shottie, it's one chassis that does it all); this means less representation in loot tables.
---
There's just no positives.  If energy DRs were across the board way lower than ballistic, that'd do a lot.
---
Well I’m gonna eat ALL OF IT until I die of dysentery and parasites and then I’ll respawn and EAT MORE.
---

People still troll this subreddit?

There are no shareholders, Bethesda/Zenimax are privately owned.
---
Really, that was my initial prejudgement.  "Fallout: *Vault 76*?  Not Fallout 5?  Does it take place entirely inside a vault?!"
---
Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised by the time the beta was released.
---
*runs after you but trips on a piece of wood from loss of strength vomits and dies from diseases*
---
Depends on the situation you find yourself in. *You notice the lights in the shop turns off around you*
---
I only have around a few hundred hours invested in this game I will get back to you in a few hundred more hours of play with my verdict.
---
How you feel is irrelevant (literally) in this situation, as it isn't server hopping that's causing you problems.  Even if it wasn't allowed, your problem will still be the same.
---
I'll give you an example out out my real life play - I 'farm' WS for a specific objects (actually dozens of them, they're all over).  If I log in and go gather them, they won't be back *for me* for several hours of in game time.  If I server hop, they won't appear for me, but other people will still be able to see them.  Server hopping literally makes no difference once I've looted the items.
---
Sometimes if you load into an area and try to take a photo too quickly, it doesn't register. You have to give time to load all the assets. Can take a minute or two.

*200 years have passed and wastelanders stumble upon a skeleton with a vault suit stretched beyond it's limits before looting the skeleton*
---
Yes, I sell a few at a time [PS4].   Every so often someone will buy a bunch at once.  But, I’m in the Mire so I usually get fewer players.   The bulk of my income comes from serums and 100% fusion cores.  I usually do about 1K to 2K per gaming session in sales.  
---
I sell recipes for 15 caps, building plans for 1/3 the game value (not the vendor price, most are 35 caps), and weapon/armor plans for 1/2 the game value (most are 50 caps).  The weapons/armor plans sell better than the building plans.  Especially the deep pocketed armor plans. 
---
That being said, I do a lot of events and take power plants so I get a lot of plans, including some of the less common ones.   So I usually have a selection of harder to find plans. 
---
I would love it if the developers could add a sales stats option that tracked what was selling.  Some might find it boring, but I would love to be able to see sales graphs based on category and a list of the top ten items sold over the last week.
---
If you feel the summons of The Interloper you will feel a magnetic like pull on your soul in the direction of The Lucky Hole Mine.
---
Same here and some keep coming back for more items from me. It's also a hub when they need stuff from me.
---
True, but I think the story behind it dates to just after the bombs fell or even pre-war military rations. I’m out on a golf course at the moment or I’d look it up lmao. I could also be totally full of shit, but just how I remember it.
---
FUUUCK. I leave more bags of steel in the wasteland than I do spoiled food
---
I cant get past the fact you type like a 40 year old single mum with all these space comma space, comma fullstop fullstop , i dont know why , but i find it ,.. Really ,.. Offputting .  
---
Anyway hopefully they fix the issue, must be irritating to lose out on the effects especially when you paid for the skins
---
Same. The craziest part was that since E3 Bethesda was pretty transparent about what it was going to be. Not an MMO, still very much a Fallout game, just online. And they delivered it, but people were upset because of bugs in Bethesda first online game, and because they hyped it up into something it wasn't going to be.
---
That's a good bit of advice but dog food doesn't improve my crits, xp gain, Luck, Strength, DR etc like Firecracker Juice, Scorchbeast meat and the like do.
---
I'm fine with going into the pipboy to feed myself I just think the frequency of it is a little high, and if Class Freak applied to Speed Demon this would be sorted.
---
Lol thought this was gonna be a tale of absolutely annihilating a low level's desire to play
---
Reviews, right?  It's easy to hate something that you haven't personally experienced and when asked why, you just say a review told you it was shit.  Some people get more enjoyment out of keeping track of and feeding into these shitstorms than actually forming a valid opinion.
---
What the fuck? How have I never noticed these machines before!?
---
*grows skin back in front of their eyes and awakes from my slumber, screams and runs toward the sunrise chasing a man who stole her spoiled food but it’s too late cause he died from dysentery and parasites*
---
What really stinks is if you are not near your camp and you hit the 25,000 cap, you can't shut off your store and people buy stuff and you do not get the caps. So all that legendary gear you've been saving and selling is wasted. I'm level 174, and I think this just broke the game for me...
---
I try to help them as soon as they exit fault 76. When they exit about 75% of them run away from after I drop things for them. There should be a text feature when your in the same area also instead of just voice.
---
Dang I should add glowing meat steaks to mine. I had like 37 the last time I checked.
---
Fallout 76 came out first, nobody was sure Anthem was going to be this bad and when it landed with all the grace of me bellyflopping into a kiddy pool most people just didn't care, it quickly became irrelevant. Abandon all hope ye who enter the realm of Anthem, its full of broken roadmaps and color filter expansions. Fallout 76 has been pretty consistently putting out fixes and new content, its improved and there is still hope it will improve more. 
---
Fallout 76 is still relevant and still got a playerbase while Anthem is all but dead. Few if anybody cares about Anthem anymore, not people that report on games and not players, its beating a dead horse to talk about it. The "click baiters" can't get any content out of it, streamers can't use it because nobody wants to watch, and players just don't want to play it. 
---
Its like asking why you see few people caring about Artifact. Its a game that died even faster then Anthem, even fewer people are playing and less development is going into it, taking a swing at it isn't beating a dead horse like Anthem but beating a pile of bones. 
---
TLdr, nobody cares about Anthem even enough to riff on it, people still care about 76 even if to hate.
---
Yeah ehm. Sell it. Right. Lets call it that way... Sometimes. *cough*
---
Oof it’s a troll, abort! Abort!
---
Back when mules were more relevant I have a guy named TheMulerReport
---
As an alternative if you build a camp by the alien blaster location a herd of radstag spawn on a regular basis.
---
Ever see 16 radstag fly through the air from a grenade explosion?
---
I dont sell crap weapkns or armor. I make sure they have at least a legendary affect
---
I try to do that occasionally. Usually he &lt;20 players run lol. I bought some food from a low level player this morning. He was busy fixing his weapons and armor, then laid down for a nap. So after my shopping I crafted him a chained all star baseball bat and dropped near his bed.
---
XD *they didn't know the man had died from old age*
---
I think you think that I don't get the concept of a caps sink :) I assure you that I do.
---
However, I also get the concept of economy, which is where this conversation is going wrong a bit.
---
Currency needs to move to keep any economy alive. If it's not moving, the marketplace dies. This is what we were heading towards before player vending.
---
It also needs to be non-punitive to do this. Spenders will accept a convenience cost up to a certain amount, and after that they will stop spending.
---
Player vending provided a great way for us to get rid of our caps, and I would point out that it introduced another caps sink - the 10% cut. I'd hate to see it underutilised because of prohibative costs to visit beautiful but remote camps.
---
An example: Camps on the far left of the map. There are amazing locations there to build, but I'll never see those camps because I exclusively hunt the right hand side, and I'm not paying 50 caps FT fees to find that someone is selling Marine Helmets at 1000 caps each.
---
To summarise, caps sinks ARE good. They're necessary. But they need to be balanced and limited also to preserve the feeling of gaining wealth and making progress.
---
How do you message people?
---
I keep the crops to grow beer and attract critters to eat.
---
Hahaha okay you win.  Take all this rotten food.
---
Yeah, this would be nice.  Currently, you can at least browse your map, challenges, settings, and social tabs, but being able to modify perks and equipment while sitting around would be a nice, little feature.
---
I have the maps but they do nothing, they aren’t actionable and lead nowhere.
---
here's the upcoming plants: https://imgur.com/a/yxvgzCw
---
Same here but if it's a unique weapon like a cryolator or the dragon, then I sell it
---
Eh
---
Well, there was that one time I ran into a player names xxPoonSlayer69xx. Maybe that is what we are supposed to be called.
---
I would like to see those stats too. The game dev's are probably looking over those stats to figure out what to put in the atom shop. 
---
I'm way up north on the cliffs west of the munitions factory so traffic to my location is pretty limited and those that would be up there probably don't need much.
---
34 minutes... Ya still waiting u/Mistiqe...?
---
Honestly, if we had a loot cave like Destiny had I would be there every day.
---
OP never asked about damage they were doing to SBQ they just wanted to know if there was a way to know when she was crippled seems like a good question to me.
---
Whitespring (where I'm assuming you're talking about for the sword quest) is the preferred grinding spot for most 50+ level players.  If they get there before you, the are will spawn mobs at that level.  If you go there first, they'll be your level.
---
That's a bit of a trick, since you don't know who was there before you (if any one).  If you can get the waypoint to the area, you can always pop in when you don't see anyone around, and check to see what level the mobs are (and if you aggro high level mobs, there, run them to the guards!). Or shadow a high level player clearing the area until you can grab the sword and run.
---
I did what you did when I was there - I ended up kiting around about a dozen high-level ghouls, slowly whittling away at their health while using up all my radaway and stimpacks, and breaking 3 weapons, before I got that stupid sword.  I fast traveled out and didn't go back there for another 20 levels :P
---
I hit the wings until she lands and then I start hitting all the legs. When she's completely crippled she doesn't move at all. No wing attack, no lunge attack. Nothing. She stays like that until regeneration. Then lather, rinse, repeat. I put away my Enforcer perk on one battle and it was a crap storm and we about never took her down.  So now I always make sure to do this. It also helps her land if you've drawn her aggro and are out in the open because she will try to land on you. If you're inside the fence or too close to a building, she won't land, even if crippled, unless she focuses aggro on someone who is out in the open. Sometimes she will cripple mid-air and will just hover in one spot, not attacking or moving around. Just flapping in one spot.
---
Entirely incorrect. Plasma gatling does several times the damage of the Laser gatling. The laser has much better range, and is hit scan.
---
So you really looked for 3* Zealot's Broadsider or 3* Mutant's laser rifle? Good for you ;).
---
This is just a solution that saves a shitload of time preventing starvation. If you use specific foods for bonuses that's different, but it changed my whole game when I stopped having to worry about killing and cooking to simply eat.
---
Yeah I wish they'd add an option to reset quests for a cost. Either make it cost caps or scrip.
---
Maybe the legendary player thing will give the option to reset quests?
---
Its just annoying knowing I could be going into my inventory that much less.  I'm one of those players who really loves different types of weapons.  I don't even have enough room on my wheel for everything I want let alone to start putting water and food there.  
---
That being said, the better inventory mod and perk load out mod are game changing, so that helps.  I wouldn't be surprised if modders make a global stash mod before Beth makes an official one.
---
*burp* Damnit Morty, mute your mic, you don't want these guinea *burp* guinea pigs to know we're gonna jump them for their Mentats
---
Why didn't they remove anti armor from the legendary pool of energy weapons while they were removing explosive?
---
I don't think the team is as incompetent as you believe they are. They have known since November of 2015 that anti armor doesn't work on energy weapons. It's still in the loot pool for the same reason that 25% fire rate rolls on black powder weapons. It's filler for the slot machine.
---
I’ve just started a new alt but no high lvl player seems to care. Maybe it’s my play style that unveils my experience in game.  A lvl 17 with a full modded handmade. Oh well..
---
they did fix it kind of, now PvP will not start until you return to your workshop and enter the green circle again if it is being contested, so it is better
---
I don't understand how yours goes so fast. I have Speed Demon and I chug Radaway like an addict.
---
I can still roam around exploring and fighting for hours without needing to constantly eat/drink. I only eat or drink when I get like below 50%.
---
Purified Water is everywhere and I have it on my wheel. Mutfruit and blackberries and boiled water are also everywhere.
---
I'll drink right after a Radaway, but otherwise I can go like 20 minutes or more before I *need* to eat and drink. Stop for 5 seconds,  fill both bars with whatever I have most of, continue on my way.
---
Don't have to scroll though a whole bunch. Save the good buff options for when you need them. Eat/drink lame stuff to just fill your hunger.
---
I'll try making a minimum of ten runs next time, I always get reticent to do more than about five as I feel I'm missing out :)
---
Fallout 76s issues were way too exaggerated from the beginning. 
---
I play on launch, from PS4, and had very few issues. The game was missing some features, and the server stability not being ideal meant you got kicked every few hours, but it was far from being "literally unplayable" like a lot of people made it seem.
---
You're picking up our poops.  I'll be sure to include some TP next time.
---
Have you moved your module since you started the camp?
---
Yeah I appreciate it man. I do run it on a melee/raider alt as I thought eating dog food was a weird raidery thing to do lol and the healing ain't no joke! Basically a Stimpack replacement.
---
I mean giving away something is also kind of...selling. With a brown bag. And toilet paper. And a bit lemonade.
---
If there isn't drama make drama. Basically the motto of most "content creators".
---
I took a workshop from a lvl 10 because they didn’t build a concrete extractor and then I added him to my team so he could keep his junk extractor.
---
That's why I watch them :)
---
There are three different bugs with Speed Demon:
---
1. Class Freak doesn't have an effect on it, because Class Freak only affects the spell magnitude, and the Speed Demon penalty doesn't use its spell magnitude. The spell just adds a perk that adjusts hunger/thirst spell magnitudes by a flat multiplier of 1.4x. Grounded had an identical bug before it was fixed a couple of patches back by writing the Class Freak effect explicitly into the Grounded perk.
---
2. The actual adjustment is 1.4x (or +40%), while the text and the spell magnitude are 50%.
---
3. The pip-boy text doesn't care about the spell magnitude, so it doesn't reduce to -12%.
---
4. The pip-boy text doesn't care about serum suppression.
---
Don't let the text bugs distract you from the real one.
---
I have so much glowing meat I had to start selling it because I was overencumbered. I don't even have the perk for double meat.
---
I'm going to have to upgrade from Windows XP, must be the reason, but I'm not sure I'll be able to live without the Search Puppy, it's so cuuuuttttteeeee!!!!!!!
---
Cheers dude appreciate that! Since I posted yesterday the replies have gone from about 380 to 1.5k+!
---
I think I'll leave it up for another day due to so many people replying, the more answers the better the data.
---
I do hope you realise that it's entirely impossible for *any* game dev studio to put out even haphazardly crafted content faster than players would consume it, yeah?
---
Look at all those chickens..
---
a total conversion mod of Bethesda Softworks' The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim developed by SureA?
---
Thanks for the heads up. MXR reported on a few other large quest mods that were amazing, but I'm glad to hear of this one.
---
So where do your visitors spawn?
---
I hope you post your info in r/dataisbeautiful
---
I never PvP but I'm building him out to go do some trolling.
---
I will remember to carry a machete so I look like wounded prey.
---
Yeah, i had my necklace vanish right after I found it on next logon, wrote a support ticket (thinking the option "quest item" will escalate something), got the exact same message.
---
Luckily on the next quest step i think it was gifted to me as a quest reward - Bethesda can't even get their bugs to work correctly i guess. 
---
I wonder what would happen if someone who is already lawyered up sues them and has proof of stuff vanishing. It's still bullshit for normal ingame things, but if you bought something with real money...
---
Resident iirc
---
True!
---
He's right though. Speed Demon's negative is bugged in at least four separate ways, and is indeed not working, but your guess is wrong. The text is actually unrelated to the real effect for most mutations, and often has its own bugs.
---
 I kill bugs, every damn thing with little trouble.That Molerat is right behind you. ;) I have thousands of hours playing Fallout 3D games and have never used VATS. It would just confuse me at this point.
---
 I have not done PvP seriously but I'll get to it.
---
I have a Ps4 Pro with a SSD I load in noticeably faster then my Brother and Cousin. They can fast travel ahead of me and I still load in first. My only complaint is a few times a month I get blue screened maybe it's because I swapped my hdd for a ssd but other then that it's great.
---
Get the ghost handeled employees only doors from the whitesprings, they close on their own, mostly when I'm abojt to leave.
---
I have two AAE laser that is a 1 or 2 shot kill on almost every regular enemy, but still only shows as 90dmg. Compared to my AAE handmade at 130 that takes 2 or 3 shots. I don’t get it.
---
It's 100% accurate in my game, visitors spawn in the exact same spot every time, behind one of my vending machines on a rock where I first placed the marker (and yes, I need to adjust my camp a bit to allow for that).
---
*I* tend to land at the edge of my camp circle east of the center, though lately I've noticed some inconsistencies in that, that I'm still trying to sort out.
---
Brahmin! Aw man, I ran around looking for a beaver or a squirrel; hoping servers and generally fearing for my life because I don’t play Survival and only wanted the weapon. Great information though. Thank you
---
*slides heartburn medication back into the cabinet
---
Honestly, I've considered starting a new character just for this, but it would be even better now that I'm equipped.
---
What else is there to do?
---
I get that, but it still looks ridiculous.
---
It's annoying as fuck. IMO. But the pool table room is kind of cool.
---
Need to be more Deathclaws in general.  I hardly see any these days besides the friendly one in the Lab.
---
Setting vsync to fast in my Nvidia game settings helped quite a bit. I dunno what the equivalent in the Radeon drivers is.
---
Unstoppable Monster
---
Youre using the shotgun rifle attachment right? It's bugged and broken as hell right now.
---
You on pc? Ill join this test as i have a bunch of ammo and ill save up some caps so we can go back and forth.
---
No it replaces your under armor
---
Heh
---
Makes perfect sense. You didnt have to check the notes for me, but much appreciated! :)
---
A little randomization can go a long way, but in any case, it took me years to complete Fallout 3, 4, Oblivion, and Skyrim. 76 has much less content than any of them.
---
Anyone else noticing serious issues at lucky hole mine? Tried for half hour to get in and it just crashed to desktop everytime I tried to enter...
---
I didn't realize I was taking advantage of an exploit when nobody has anything good for sale on my server, so I hop to another..
---
I also tried to give my man a Clint Eastwood vibe!
---
wow so i wont be able to get the benefits of shielded?
---
You have to quit and comeback
---
Pretty sure you’re thinking of “A Real Blast”
---
Yeah, there are two settings, but neither helped. I actually found it to perform worse with Chill turned on.
---
Thank you for the response! I decided to give it a shot after everything I've read. Downloading as we speak!
---
instead of full throttling your jetpack tap the jump button in a rhythm, also best used with marsupial
---
You just can’t jump servers you have to quit like switching characters and then join world
---
It falls under the casual category so if you’re able to craft the casual linings you can upgrade it
---
Ad Victorium, brother. Welcome to the brotherhood.
---
Brace yourself:
---
A unique named weapon that has a high chance to inflict diseases.  It doesn't really stack with the Plaguewalker buff, but it fits the theme well enough.
---
It's not a competition to not be the worst. Fallout 76 needs to be good not simply better than the worst. With that mind set, is it good/great/satisfactory?
---
It sounds like you want vindication. But you can't find that through the failure of someone else
---
The explosive effect makes it do full damage on literally every "pellet" of energy damage that hits.
---
Yes! Power Armor Scorched Please!
---
When my friend and I tested this, only the camp owner was affected by the replacement of the camp module. All visitors and teammates always spawned in the original placement location.
---
Or hold down a well defended base with AA guns from level 50 Scorchbeasts right outside of Watoga.
---
People actually use grenades and mines?
---
Fudgenug
---
I’ve got that too. I’ll give it a shot. Thanks
---
Check player vendors, if you're on xbox I've got 15 currently for sale at 27c apiece, at least 10 more that I didnt quite have STASH space for but are for sale if you want. 
---
Nearly every sentry bot spawns in the same place everytime, learn where a few are and farm them.
---
The power armor found randomly in the world always spawn in the same place and always have a fusion core and a few random pieces on them.  Remember a couple spawns and check them regularly, server hop and repeat if you're really in need.  One location in the northwest of the forest region at arnholdt(incorrect spelling) farm behind a low level lock in a shed.  There is a corpse with a key to the shed if you dont want to/cant pick the lock, I believe it's about 100m northeast of the shed by some beehives though my memory could be incorrect.
---
I live in power armor and use what I find; I only take powerplants to sell full cores.  The power user perk in intelligence also helps, not sure when that unlocks though.
---
Thats not bad for a first experience Lol
---
There's miners map machines in a few of the towns down in the ash heap. The town with the train station has a map machine just down the steps from the train station... like down the dirt hill just into the town area.
---
Don't worry, I was very wrong, several people confirmed dropping paint after getting the plans.  
---
 25 with no paint is not unusual, Getting 3 in 20 is :), I think your instinct is spot on, you were very lucky to start, now its catching up.  
---
 All told it roughly averages 1 paint in 20 submits, you have 3 in 45, so still ahead of the game.
---
What everyone else said.  Also read the posters in the train stations.
---
I have a Anti Armor Auto Grenade launcher I have not used it since Fasnacht I would make it rain grenades it was fun.
---
Solid advice. Upvote!
---
You filthy responder
---
I enjoy it all.
---
Yes for sure, level 3 safes drop tech data.
---
True.  That’s why I try to put higher end items, in addition to plans in my shop.  I expect most of my visitors will be high levels so I stock:
---
- canned dog food : 3 caps (always sells out)
---
- serums  : 275 caps (buyers can make money reselling them to vendors, I limit the quantity per day so I’m not having to farm flux all of the time)
---
- 100% fusion cores : 40 caps (takes up less weight than 50% fusion cores)
---
- Nuclear Key Cards : 100 caps
---
- Radshield : 35 caps
---
- Nuka Grenades
---
- Nuka Quantum Grenades
---
- 3* full modded weapons and armor as I find them.   I never put up the basic model that drops.  
---
- a wide selection of plans and recipes
---
I think what OP is on about was the countless, "Fk Fo76, I'm waiting for Anthem" posts. So seeing Anthem flop, he wants those people to eat their words. Vindication through the failure of Anthem.
---
Sometimes Justice warps into Vengeance. And that isn't healthy.
---
No. Speed Demon has explicit adjustments for Strange in Numbers. The speed boost increases from 20 to 25 and the reload boost from 30 to 40. It doesn't affect the penalty.
---
Grounded's penalty was screwed up for the same reason as Speed Demon (it doesn't use the spell magnitude, which is adjusted by Class Freak), but the OP's reason is incorrect. Speed Demon isn't actually applied as a negative value at all: It's a multiplier by 1.4.
---
Its your amd card
---
Huh. Good to know.
---
I do a little of this. I have a few points in S, E, C, and I and almost maxed out P, A, L. I'm primarily rifle. High P lets you switch between rifleman and commando perks for either semi or full auto play respectively. I throw on Enforcer in A to boost my shotgun when needed and could also throw on a couple shotgun perks in S to boost damage there at the expense of my carryweight perks. I can throw on Stabilized on I when I break out my heavy guns (at the expense of gunsmith or batteries included). I believe pistol perks are in A so I'm covered there as well and could drop action boy or some sneak perks. The only thing I'm not really able to do is Melee and that's fine with me. I hate being up close and personal with enemies. I need my space.
---
Ok, for your example: Fast travel to Vault 76 first, then to the camps on the left side of the map. Now it is just as cheap to check out these. 
---
You and me can arugue this ad infinitum, but 
---
* If people who build on left side of the map wont get any business, they will move if business is important to them.
---
* If the Devs notice people don't fast travel as much as they used to, they will change it.
---
Us saying it is one way or the other wont matter if the Devs see numbers that don't support our arguments, the only thinsg that can and will change this is if the Devs see a change in numbers. If it still works, they wont change it. If they see a change in travel patterns, they will change it.
---
It’s just like politics
---
But the linings for casual are bugged, can't get the 3rd tier which locks out the 4th tier (shielded) unless you get lucky, they were exploited and duped at some point.
---
ammunition sellers buy it like crazy. I sold 5k steel yesterday.
---
Other companies hold stakes in Zenimax. While not technically public owned and sold, there are owners.
---

---
Can you get crits (i.e. headshots) on a scorchbeast?
---
Sad... and true.
---
John Smith
---
That sucks
---
No, it needs proper damage scaling - the bloodied one-shot builds are the problem, if one can deal thousands of damage in one hit that's just too far away from the ~150-200 that my level 85 char can deal.
---
If they don't either nerf the current god-builds or buff other more traditional builds, all endgame enemies will be too strong and too weak at the same time.
---
I have my 3 star flamer on my wheel, I use it a decent amount.  Its my go to camp fire tales weapon alongside my tesla which is also on my quick wheel.  I use the flamer for more events as well to tag enemies and to just have fun with it.  
---
That being said, I haven't seen one other player use a flamer besides me(I'm sure the're our there somewhere).  It takes a lot of oil to make fuel, but i deal with that in a few ways.  The mines have good oil, the airport has 3 oils, and our group gives each other the ammo we need.
---
Oh, and it does seem fire owns bugs.
---
What makes a TS weapon inaccurate?
---
Yeah, but I figured if your going through the effort may as well get as much as possible. Plus 20 kills with fat man, plus some spare, i ended up with 28. Used em all.
---
For me it doesn't matter so much because you have to break down SO MANY to get all the mods, plus with Scrapper they're a good source of steel.
---
Can you elaborate? I do not have this issue on other games, only Fallout 76. Even Fallout 4 with 2k textures and a crapton of other mods runs at over 100 fps at 2k on ultra. As others have said before, it's the game. I am just curious if it will be addressed.
---
good points...I'd add doing away completely with leaderboards and showing anyone on the map. Make us all blind to one another..
---
Yes, but only the rare or expensive ones.  Chem recipes, weapons, event-specific items, etc.  Not common weapon and armor mods or the basic workshop/CAMP furniture.
---
I see way too many people with Single Action Revolver Ivory Grip plans in their vending machines.
---
Good gravy, who runs out of food in this game? I’m dropping steaks left and right after I defend my extractors. I sell a lot of food to the vendorbots too because it spoils and I hold on to the non-spoiling kind.
---
I'm going to offer quite an unpopular opinion here, but anyhow...
---
Remember that support staff are going through a lot of tickets. When I was CS in gaming, we had targets to close 120 tickets per shift, or about one every four minutes. We'd try to get an idea in 30 seconds what you were writing about, and if we didn't know by 60 seconds, we'd bucket you - i.e. put you into a popular response category. You'd probably get a canned response from this. The ones that got solved quickly (assuming we had the tools) were the really clear and concise ones, where we "got it" very quickly indeed.
---
Looking at your ticket from the perspective of my own experience, your written communication here is quite poor. Your punctuation is weird, you ramble, and I can't tell in a quick readthrough what your issue is. Please remember I am speaking as a CS rep now, not myself :P I do get it, I promise.
---
If I were you, I would write a new ticket. Just state what you had, what you did, and what happened. Just those. 3 sentences. e.g.
---
"I had a Bloodied Explosive Shotgun, I applied the responder paint, and the explosive effect disappeared. Can you investigate?".
---
Just some advice. Hope your issue gets resolved.
---
Well that's a /thread ender. wp
---
It's been brought up, but I don't think anyone has figured out how to do it yet.
---
Nuka grenades have a cool looking explosion, I like using them. Wish the Quantum grenades animation was better tho
---
Take my upvote, you deserve it
---
True that
---
And..if....the...person....in...question...is...a...40...year... old..single...mum, what...then...?
---
This is probably less exciting when the victim has Fireproof III and Healing Factor.
---
I got it taken care of but ill keep you in mind, im sure ill need to move something later. thank you.
---
Give it a try if you want a break from Fallout. It's free on Steam.
---
Very much, hopefully it gets addressed soooon cause I want that +3 CHR for selling crap
---
There's a bug that when you open a map the server lag can make it seem like nothing happened. Open your game map and scour the whole region you're in for a little yellow area marker dot. The dot is very dim (I just had a thought that it might be because my hud opacity is turned down). It's there somewhere I promise you. Once you find it you go there looking for a dirt pile (like with a treasure map) and dig it up. Then you get the quest completed prompt. I don't know if they purposefully left out a compass marker for this quest or what, but I don't get one and it makes finding the dig site difficult.
---
It's entirely possible for it to be a legacy recipe too.  Look at how they pulled serum recipes from the Scorchbeast Queen rewards table.  If they also pulled them from the Enclave Bunker vendors, the only people who'd be able to craft those would be people who learned or obtained the recipe before it was pulled.
---
Got it taken care of. thank you.
---
Also, the plasma breaks more often if my informations are correct.
---
Oh man, at this point I just grow plants, and have the Green Thumb perk. One cap per plant, two plants per stalk and as many plants as I can fit in my camp space. Plus purified water is 4 caps per unit, the purifiers pay for themelves pretty quick too. This is more for just griping about the economy.
---
Doesnt work. I have a tent setup that is everything but the floor. get the same problem. FYI.
---
You can take a photo. You just need space for the camera to spawn in. On an instrument, you just need the object placed where the camera can go. For chairs, if you sit in 3rd person, position the camera so nothing is behind and it should have enough space to spawn in.
---
I agree on all counts :) So no argument, buddy, and I hope you didn't take it that way - just an exchange of opinions, which is what Reddit is for :)
---
I observed something which doesn't sit right with me, and offered suggestions. I don't claim I'm right, and I don't claim I am the only valid perspective. I just wanted thoughts :)
---
&gt;Doesnt work. I have a tent setup that is everything but the floor. get the same problem. FYI.
---
Hmmm this is wildly tempting, even though I've got 2 PC copies already...
---
Wait.
---
Bottlecap mines?
---
I thought those weren't in 76?
---
This reminds me: I checked my guns to see if any stars disappeared. Everything was still 3*. Armor, Shotguns, Lever-Actions everything.
---
I did a couple of server hops just to see if anything would changed (which I doubted since I already did a ton of server-hops with the paint equipped the day before this issue arose), and it yielded the same result: nothing changed.
---
So I'm guessing either this issue doesn't affect everybody, or there's going on specifically for you
---
Aluminum scrap should sell for more because of how rare it is, in fact rubber sells for more even
---
Ps4 my friend. Lucky for me my roommate plays on ps4 also so it will be easy for us to test
---
I love the explosion and just watching the body fly off in the distance lol.
---
Those 2 people put good money into the game. They deserve to get what they paid for, especially for supporting a game that was publicly bombarded at launch.
---
Yet anthem is going up the same road as fallout 76, they’re keeping to themselves &amp; fixing things constantly and are releasing new content, yet here we are being a little unfair sh**ing on another game for the same problems 76 had
---
 I dunno, they just are.
---
/u/Valseek this is the comment you need to pass on.
---
Thanks for the info. After you’ve taken out the legs do you focus on her head or torso?
---
My reaction when I saw the title without reading, "What you peppered sprayed him with a tse?"
---
After reading," What is this civilized bullshit?!  Have the apocalypse taught you nothing man?
---
I use grenades.  I also craft Nuka and Nuka Quantum grenades.   But...   it’s too easy to farm grenades from the Top of the World area for me to waste resources on building them.  
---
They came in handy the most when spawns get stuck in the ground or in walls.   The blast radius, especially with a maxed out Explosive perk, seems to penetrate the ground enough to damage them.  
---
Also, they come in handy during the Encryptid event when all of the robot spawns are grouped.
---
You must be playing on console. I read "messaged him" and thought "wait what now?" Can't message people on PC
---
Then ,. ThEy.  Are typing  just , fine
---
Or Blackwater mine
---
Here’s a little known thing: if you have your camera out when sitting in a chair, you can still use the emote wheel. Your character won’t do the action, but the symbols still appear above their heads.
---
I haven't heard about it affecting XP.  I've only heard that it increases the durability of equipment you craft(kind of like how luck increases the durability of equipment you find).  Also, perks that reduce condition decay are INT-based, so unless you're running LUCK perks that repair condition randomly, your equipment will break incredibly fast.
---
Essentially, INT is all about making your equipment last longer.
---
Don't forget a plunger for the stubborn ones been using peoples camp toilets leaving raw cloth fertilizer and a plunger on seat...
---
👍👍👍
---
Some games dont get along with AMD.  Ive read posts in the past about it.  You have a way better system than me but i have no problems with FO76, its why i stay with NVIDIA.  I had the gtx 970 for the longest time and finally upgraded to the rtx 2070.  970 worked great though.
---
so it will benefit from casual shielded?
---
Grenades are so useful is PvP because so many people don't use them!!
---
There used to be one at the sludge hole u could gather 6-8 caps every log in toads usually set it off near the large purifier by the two red canisters not sure if it's still a spawn
---
The official title of the player character in 76 is Vault Resident. I guess resident because it's not as permanent as "dweller" and was chosen because our vault stay was meant to be temporary. Dweller is still correct, that's just the official name when referring to lore
---
Should be able to find it for half the price on amazon i got it brand new for £12.99
---
Like bots or players?
---
Wrong. They are not useful in pvp
---
Happy
---
Thought u massacred him.. Lmao
---
The only response needed.  😉
---
Bring your map screen up.
---
Press L1 
---
Go into game options.
---
Turn on pacifist mode.
---
Then enter back into game.
---
(Hopefully that's in the right order)
---
As far as I know but that other guy says they’re bugged so idk
---
Ammo and A: the inability to sell to vendors and B: the ammo they sell is expensive and in dinky quantities.
---
Not that I think you should be able to sell it - we melee don't need more bonuses - but it kind of goes to show why ammo bulking should be a thing.
---
I had to look up brain bombs, I don’t think they give 300 max AP for two hours. That’s a LOT of AP and just doesn’t sound right. The listing said they restore 90 hp and give 3 int for two hours.
---
You sir are not a raider anymore
---
Post your own fix so they can ban your account for using it, like the widescreen fiasco
---
How not?!
---
That would be cool if it could be similar to how you played cards on New Vegas but just at any in-game table, and you could see your character as well as rotate the camera. duuuuuuude
---
I do not currently. Considered it. For some reason I'm hesitating to install SFE.
---
If this is the camp I think it is, and I think it is, I ran past there while he was building it. Looked very welcoming until i noticed all the flamers being built. So much Nope. So much laughter. I suggested a sign saying "Hot Deals". Might have been the same guy, maybe a copycat or somebody with a similar idea. But it seems trap bases are here, and it can be a fun thing as long as people take it with a laugh.
---
Any luck, im looking into the same thing and want to know whats the best spot to set up in
---
Crits are different from headshots. You can certainly get vats crits, but I'm not sure if headshots do more damage on SB or SBQ.
---
Nope I placed mine off to the side of a road and I spawn inside the middle of the road every time and have to jump till I get out of the asphalt
---
I started playing at the end of may and even I want to smash things regularly when i can't respawn, items disappear, legendary enemies sink through the ground, the game freezes up when consuming an item or my junk bag floats 20m up in the air. The game is still fucking buggy, they even re-add bugs that were already fixed, no one seems to really playtest their builds, and tons of essential features are still missing. I can't even imagine what the players had to endure that joined up on launch...
---
Don't give credit to Bethesda just because others are able to fuck it up even more, that's not an accomplishment. The Fallout franchise has been on the decline since FONV, so of course they get shit for disappointing a huge crowd of die hard fans. Also they get shit for being incable of providing a modern and stable game experience.
---
Continues to happen to me as well.
---
You reckon it'll be liked over there? I just know 76 is a little controversial lol
---
Eventually, or if you find the plan/somebody who knows it, yes
---
players. I have one guy who will buy all I can get him and he still needs another 40k he said. that's just for his current orders. that will go up. offer to sell it on a thread. someone will buy it.
---
Emote that lets me freak out/twitch like a spastic like the ghouls in Fallout 4, do want
---
Data is beautiful. That is all I can say.
---

 [https://www.pcgamer.com/bethesda-on-fallout-76-mods-selling-non-cosmetic-items-and-community-feedback/](https://www.pcgamer.com/bethesda-on-fallout-76-mods-selling-non-cosmetic-items-and-community-feedback/)   
---
Highlight of what I mention:  
---
" 
---
Gardiner tells me there is a plan to address "a lot of these smaller concerns" that are more about quality of life issues, or "holistic" changes, as he puts it—the sort of things that modders have been working on fixes for since the game's release. And despite not officially supporting mods, Bethesda does keep an eye on what mods players are using.
---
"We're actually also actively looking at some of the more popular mods on PC which deal with inventory management," Gardiner says. "I'm just saying. We're aware."
---
"**We actually have our list of the top ten mods that are played**," says Mayer, "and we want to be very cognizant of that, because when players are using mods to play the game, that's a clear area where we can improve.""
---
Unless you are on a Survival server there is no reason to be afraid of other players anymore. They cannot even damage you until you hit them back, or at all if you have pacifist on. To turn that setting on you just have to go into the game play setting and swap it to on. ( I saw you had asked somewhere else)
---
Its all good bro. Ideas need to be bounced around. We all just want the game to be better after all.
---
See you in the Wasteland!
---
First I've even heard of it
---
Interesting! Thanks!
---
It packs a ton of DPS, especially at low health, which can grant up to an 80% damage boost with the Bloodied effect.  Add +40% power attack damage and a 40% cut to incoming damage while power attacking and you have a pretty beast melee weapon.
---
The only reason I'm selling mine is because:
---
1) I can easily get a few thousand caps for it eventually.
---
2) I already have a Deathclaw Gauntlet with AA and +STR, which I consider better effects that the 1st and 3rd of Unstoppable Monster.  The Anti-Armor effect means that I can enjoy the benefit of my full health while still reaping a higher-than-average DPS.  The number one complaint about Bloodied builds is that they're ridiculously squishy and can't take the same ridiculous DPS that they dish out.
---
3) The true OP effect would be Swing Speed, to the point that a Bloodied Swing Speed Deathclaw Gauntlet reward would probably tank the unarmed legendary market for a while.  Heck, I'd even drop several thousand caps on a Suppressor's SS Gauntlet until I find an AASS Gauntlet.
---
I had a normal ghouls explode on me about a week ago, scared the crap out of me and left me thoroughly confused
---
What amazes me is how hard people bash developers for bugs. It's like they've never tried their hand at coding, at all. 
---
I strongly believe that there should be quality control in the form of testing a patch before it goes live, to catch whatever bugs are found and iron them out.
---
However, some slip through the cracks in weird and non-obvious ways. It happens. But I think it's ignorant to say a dev isn't working fast enough, or that they have no intention of fixing the bugs. Again, it's like these people complaining have *never* coded anything in their lives.
---
Yup, fraid so.
---
Which means that West-Tek is still the place to be for legendary farming. 4-5 mins, server hop, do it again.
---
I have the knowledge and I can give to you too. Are you on PC? If you acquire one, you learn it.
---
Oh ok. I thought heard it mentioned it affected how the player gains experience. Also I thought LUCK improved equipment durability. I mean, I have the cards under intelligence to repair things to 200%, but.... sigh, I’m confused.
---
I put it in my generator room, off to the side of the shop, behind locked doors :p
---
Or one can just disable it via the build menu, that way you know it isn't getting turned on/off
---
Assisted suicide is a public service. Sometimes junk and curiosity can be a burden. Fine folks like you help the world move along.
---
no I run vanilla
---
In Fallout 4, you would be right, but replacing high INT with the Idiot Savant perk always yielded better results for me.
---
I think it is intentional
---
I would highly recommend these two video by AzkrielGaming,  on the bloodied build...

---
A mule or secondary will usually emote "No" to a gift.  A new player will stand there dumbfounded. X)
---
That's a good way of doing it; leaving a switch out in plain view is not lol...
---
I personally just delete a wire in the build menu and re-add it when I'm done.
---
Wait, did you say she's single?
---
You shut your mouth and don't touch my switches. I will advertise my wares when I want to.
---
Sounds like Capture the Flag.    I used to love CTF.      
---
They would have to give identical armor and weapons and all perks nullified so everyone is on a level playing field for it to be fun.  For example, everyone gets put into the same PA and given a laser rifle when the event starts.  Maybe there is extra gear that you can pick up in the area like a shotgun or sniper rifle and stimpaks. 
---
If they just plunked it in there using the current PvP model then it would just be another “whoever shoots first wins” contest.
---
Take workshops and/or build your camp near a fissure?
---
We (almost) all aim for *god builds and gear" so that's what this game can give everyone that's in for it. And in the meantime we all get better till we're maybe there. I'm far from this with my new char though at lvl 83, grinding for legendarys every day. But i want bigger challenges in my gaming, bigger and stronger enemies that challenges my tactical know-how and not only my DPS.
---
I don't bother with challenges. I like most quests. I'm an event junkie. I'll absolutely grind for a goal, including launching my own nukes tonget my own mats to make my various flux necessary items.
---
I'm trying on my current playthrough to hit things skipped over on the others. I still dont bother with most challenges.
---
Yeah way more logical 
---
I recall the first day I FT'd to a fellow dwellers CAMP and saw the switch right above the vendor. Thought noooo way can I actually turn yer stuff off? Blip gone from the map. Turned it back on and immediately realized I wouldn't do the same :p
---
As someone at level 30 helping my level 8 friend claim a workshop, and then got assaulted instead of joined by some high level asshole, I appreciate you
---
I like a little of everything but quests and events are my favorite parts of things, I just wish some events could level better with players who are doing it solo at low levels.
---
I list my unwanted ammo for 0 caps anyway. Wonder if I get taxed by giving it away. Haven't really thought to check it
---
The value of a weapon is soley based on a base value plus the mods attached. I have had normal assault rifles that we're worth more than my bloodied handmade.
---
That's why I let you guys get wailed on...they hurt! I run AA stuff or a VE railway against crawlers...gotta get through that exoskeleton lol.
---
All I'm saying is there's a better way to do that. (;
---
Doh!  I knew there was a door going out of the Gym but I never thought of going in that one.
---
Although sometimes the cafeteria has some plastic too.  And if you run the whole place you can scrap all those scorched weapons for a decent amount of steel.
---
Weird flex but okay.
---
Yay
---
Wait. The number we see on our screen in the parentheses is how much ammo is left in the BUYER’S inventory? That doesn’t make sense to me. Why would WE need to know that?
---
Dudes with radium rifles can catch you off guard if you run bloodied sometimes.
---
Good point! I checked the mod, seen it required SFE, and despite not knowing much what does it do, I seen in the conversations bethesda made some file changes that conflicted with that or something...
---
This happened to me once.  It recognized one piece of weight reduction armor, but didn't stack with the second, third, fourth, etc.
---
You just have to log out and log back in.
---
Oh yeah. Cool things happen there.
---
Ok. I’ll just let it go at that. Lol thanks
---
Ehh it was fun. Flex or not
---
I paid $35 for it and have well over 500 hours logged.  I'd say it was more than worth it.  I did eventually buy Atoms, which brings the total to $55, but that's cheap for how much enjoyment I get out of it.
---
I think about it from the context of Cities Skylines, which came out for about the same price and puts out $15 content packs a couple times a year.  The fact that Bethesda is giving out the major add-ons for free makes it a good value.
---
thanks for reply! Well I imagine it's the people with interest on text chat, but not using it, that are replying XD Because of course there is a lot of people not interested in it, because they use voice chat hehe
---
Assaultrons are part of the WS staff/guardians.  
---
As long as you don't smack them (or any other WS staff bot), they should leave you alone.  
---
That includes coincidental hits - like you go in with an automatic weapon and a stray shot hits (any) guard robot.  Hive mentality - hitting one will aggro all WS bots against you.  (I don't remember how long they stay aggro'ed)
---
You do not have to build excavator at the mining HQ site.  As long as you have the materials, you can build it anywhere that has a PA station.  However, you do have to go back to the HQ building to register the armor, which is when you get the reward for completing the quest.
---
Try this: 
---
Check WS and make sure it is not nuked.  If it is not, then FT there.  It will spawn you in the courtyard, which is protect by a number of bots, so it is unlikely anything will attack you.  Go straight through the door in front of you.  Find Artisans corner.  Build the excavator PA there.  Put it on, exit the same way you came in, go for the sword.  (Since you are in PA, your DR will be much higher than whatever armor you have on now, so will be easier.)   Then check the mining HQ.  If no high levels, FT there and register the suit.  The critter there must be randomized.  (For me, it was always a wendigo.)  
---
If it still the Assaultron, Do you have a "troubleshooter" weapon?  Those do additional damage to bots. 
---
Or an AP/AA weapon.  
---
Enjoy the reward.
---
I got it by standing right at the giant statue and taking a camera picture.
---
Buy it and find out
---
Yeah it seems like they had to make a work around after a patch or two ago, and SFE is required for the newest version of Perk Loadout Manager (I'm one version behind, still using the character planner method).
---
My first and only time on survival a level 7 yes 7 was in first place. I found him locked onto him in vats over 90% chance to hit not once did I hit him with a shot from my Bloodied Explosive Pipe Pistol I did end up killing both of us with an explosion. When I loaded back in I switch to my Bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet and found #3 I crouched with my Chameleon armor and kill #3 as he runs past me not even noticing I was there. Also I noticed in survival mode it was hard finding other players unless they were in the top 3.

At least thats what I do. 
---
I think a purified water farm can be a pretty easy way to hit 1400 as well.
---
I agree with the daily quests. This is ACTUAL content that we can't play because of bugs.
---
Thank you, that was so much of a faff!
---
West Tek and the National Satellite Array. Sell all the weapons the super mutants drop.
---
I'll preface this by saying I agree that a lot of the controversy was overblown bullshit and that I play FO76 daily and I really, truly enjoy it. Visiting Harper's Ferry (one of the few places in the game I've been to IRL) for the first time is one of my favorite gaming moments. So I'm not hater, but I'm also not going to pretend the game didn't deserve a lot of flack at launch.  
---
The game was buggy as hell at launch, despite feedback during the BETA. It deserved a lot of the criticism it got, and imo, a lot of it pushed Bethesda to turn it into the game we have now, half a year later. Just look at this [fan-compiled list of bugs from November](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a0lt2z/ive_compiled_a_list_of_all_known_bugs_in_fallout/) . Some of them are the kinds of things you'd expect from Bethesda (which is *not* an excuse), but it's an online game which meant previously inconvenient things were now a little infuriating and hard to overlook. 
---
Bugs/exploits could lead to server-side instability as well as client-side. This meant servers crashed quite regularly and because of how FO76 tracks quest progress, this meant you could lose significant quest progress if you hadn't reached a checkpoint. I didn't even start playing the game until December and it was *still* unstable and buggy as hell compared to today.   
---
Also, there were quite a lot of bugs introduced in FO4 that were patched by the community via plugins, but were still found to be present in FO76. Between that and the lack of addressing bugs found in the BETA by players, a lot of people felt like Bethesda didn't give a shit about their playerbase. And then the atom shop exists, so it felt even more like they were just trying to milk us for money without putting in the right amount of effort. Bethesda wasn't quite as communicative as people wanted, so that just added more fuel to the fire. So I understand why people were so pissed off about FO76 at launch.
---
But again, let me restate this, I think beyond the bugginess, a lot of things were overblown for the reasons you cited. The game has come a long way since launch. It's just a shame that Bethesda applied the "eh we'll fix it after launch" methodology of software development.
---
👍 good for you dude !!!
---
Did he?!?!
---
Got mine from the miner's Monument.
---
How to server hop like three times
---
Bad publicity, review bombs from single player nation and a buggy launch. There is a case study somewhere in here about how public perceptions mutate things like this.
---
Ok thank you. I usually set up extractors and such. Gather a few rounds and leave it unlocked for anyone to have at it.
---
Me as well, I use an automatic assault rifle for its aesthetic purposes. I'm not deadset on being bloodied adrenal reaction nerd rage 15 strength psychobuff twisted muscles maxed damage perks +5 strength from legendary armor man like some players

---
Are you thinking of the wolves in Free Range? I think those ones are buffed.
---
Personally, I feel like you wouldn't be able to contract Scorched in Power Armor. I guess you could catch the disease then get in a suit? I don't know, but I'd be fine if this never came to pass, or maybe if there was one boss where it was explained why they were Scorched with Power Armor.
---
I like it.
---
This is why you play in adventure mode to avoid griefers, and "raiders".
---
Speaking of which why don’t we have a way to gift workshops ?
---
np, at least you've got it now
---
yea I figured it had to be the server I was on, I was on it for a few hours and we did check ther. Back on the search tonight!
---
There are some people who are too afraid of losing gear to play Survival but still want to PvP.  Since Bethesda still considers workshops PvP areas, they'll typically pop up there when you claim a workshop or go to defend it.
---
The best reaction that doesn't feed into their behavior is to express your unwillingness to fight and completely take the wind out of their douchebag sails.  Store whatever junk you may not have dropped or drop it in a bush, unequip all armor so its condition doesn't degrade, and explain calmly that they aren't going to get anything worthwhile from this encounter with you.  The workshop might be lost anyway, but some PvPers will just slink off because even they realize how immature it is to repeatedly kill somebody in a non-competitive, non-threatening context.
---
I'll make my own raider club! With blackjack, and hookers!
---
depends on why you didn't think it was worth buying in the past.

---
Do you also bitch when people are server hopping and don't turn their machines off?
---
They've reduced it to one a day/week so I dont mind as much that they exist, just that they're really annoying to do solo
---
These comments have made my whole day 😂😂
---
Or make a new game mode where everything is Lvl 60 or higher. Making the Forest just as rough as the CB
---
FOR THE ENCLAVE
---
That would also be nice. For the vertibot I just took a workshop with one and got the pic while it was grounded
---
I need it too so if you or anyone else still needs it we can help each other
---
Aww, no 76 freebies? X)
---
You're a hero
---
I 100% agree with everything you've said here. Thanks for your input. I think it's hard for people to understand that you can simultaneously think the game is great, and also that it needs a lot of work.
---
I’m finding them constantly in containers instead of useful loot. Hell, I found three broken pro-snaps in the Agricultural Research Centre today. Two in the basement and one on the top floor.
---
ps4
---
Yeah, just checked nexus forums for both text chat mod and sfe, and looks like it broke on last / previous patch, and got fixed again. Still see lots of recent posts of people not being able to use it, so it doesnt look thaaat good after all xD  
---
Still think I am gonna take the risk, given Bethesda is soft confirming in that interview those UI mods are allowed.
---
Me too! Add me? I'm always alone T.T
---
Sorry not sure what you mean?
---
Did I post to the wrong area?
---
&gt; It's like they've never tried their hand at coding, at all
---
Well... isn't that obvious?
---
Hell yeah
---
I’m level 107 and am just as defenseless as a level 7. I refuse to engage. There been many times I have just stood there while some “bad ass” killed me. Congratulations Rambo. You just annihilated a middle-aged woman and took her fast travel point. Maybe you missed the lit up sign saying “team up and take all materials”.
---
yea but can you build a regular broken pro snap into a deluxe?
---
Hopefully you are not rocking the Grounded mutation by accident
---
It'd be super sad for an adult to try and find purpose in a video game only to decide to also be a loser in-game.
---
I don't really have an opinion on the game but I did pick up on all the shit and drama that happened at launch
---
If the main problem is hitching/frame loss try clearing out your friends list (accept or decline 100% of the pending invites) and also use the scan and repair option from the Bethesda launcher.  
---
Beyond that check your fov, if it's maxed out that will tax most systems.  
---
I was having similar problems and the friends list + scan repair fixed my issues and now it's smooth.
---
I'm going to say the game is definitely worth what it's going for now.
---
Was it worth $60-80 6 months ago? Hell no.
---
&gt;  I focus on one of the Queens wings pumping critical hits, try to keep her on the ground, and running some additional crowd control. It’s seems to be working 
---
He's speaking as if his targeting of the queen's wings are what's keeping her crippled. It isn't.  It's what he's doing combined with what probably half a dozen other people are doing.
---
Nah just paying it forward
---
Grinding is the lack of gameplay for the sake of adding hours of nothing to do. hate it with a passion
---
Haha got em
---
I'm downvoting a shitpost and snarky attitude ;)
---
I was being sarcastic but ok.
---
Oh well I haven’t had enough coffee this morning to have caught that.
---
I love when customer service systems or help forums allow **them** to mark something "closed" or "best answer" (the latter is a common 'issue' at Microsoft's forum). 
---
It's like... hello? lol *I'm* the one who has the problem here, soooo.... shouldn't ***I*** be the one to determine if it's indeed closed, or what you've said has resolved my problem and is the "best answer"?   
---
In terms of the latter, I've actually seen threads where the user said the multiple different attempts by the M$ person have not solved anything... and it's actually another USER who posts a solution which worked. So when you view the thread, now here's a "Best Answer" (which didn't help) from the M$ person, as well as a "User Selected Best Answer".... &gt;\_&gt; I find it rather cringe-worthy.
---
Granted, I get why they'd *consider* it closed in this case, but the reality is that it's not and shouldn't be swept under the rug like that. :\\ Something is broken on **their** side, and their automated fix *is also broken!* Nothing about that merits the ticket to be 'closed', particularly when you can't progress through *their* game. At that point it'd at least be nice for the ability to not 'reset' the quest, but completely REMOVE the quest from your character. The sucky side of it being an ultimately-Gamebryo-based (Creation Engine) game, but now having no console access AND the save files are hosted on the server where we can't fix it our self :(
---
Crazy to think it has been 6 months since the launch, all the drama about the game feels so recent
---
Not too much luck I'm afraid I've had mixed results, but I'll post my results below 
---
TMS TM-02 Pros: lots of deathclaw and ant meat for strength and carry capacity buffs, junk spot, diseased cranberries around, deathclaw gives good XP, can rarely spawn 3✨, Quarry X3 mirelurk queen in artillery range, horde events can be near by. Cons: no water source, if turrets are too close they can kill everything before they spawn in properly and you lose out on loot POSSIBLE WORKAROUND: place turrets further back and lure DC into them, use punji boards/tesla arcs rigged to pressure plates and tripwires to tag ants, have a buddy leave and rejoin while you sit in camp
---
Make gourd soup. Usually what i do and it gives 2 PER and only weighs half a pound
---
I have never, ever, had a blueprint work. I quit trying long ago.
---
More supplies to craft clothing.
---
&gt; I was just confused as to his reasoning.
---
It's probably a great credit to your personality that you don't understand the inner workings of an asshole's thought process.
---
I used it for awhile and then uninstalled it.
---
My complaint was there was no 'server' chat option.
---
You could chat Globally, with a clan, or Local. Local is like players within 100m or something incredibly small. Global was too populated and I stopped paying attention.
---
I'd be on-board again if there was an option to chat with only players on my server.
---
I think its random wherever u are? I think you just gotta be lucky. That's just from my experience
---
Wes T. Virginia
---
They can spawn anywhere
---
I see some people selling mutation serums to robot vendors as well.
---
If you move, you have to do a single foundation building. It is the only configuration that will move reliably.
---
Aww man
---
Because Bethesda has made good games before and the game came out like shit. I paid $60 for a game that ran, played, and worked like shit. It’s getting better which I’m happy about, but it should have come out good.
---
On her belly. I've heard that's the weak spot and it seems that way. Get down by her posterior end and shoot between her legs. If you're at the side, you're going to hit her wings too much which have a very high DR.
---
Yeah this is what really gets me, people had their own expectations. Meanwhile bethesda said this game was going to be an all online experimental game. Then people got upset because it wasn’t a grandmaster single player experience. It’s like they didn’t even listen to any of the presentations on the game
---
I do the same with some of my Vendor Characters (I have 5), but I'm running 2 Xboxes, and sometimes I'm to busy to keep an eye on things or interact, so I just feed them, water them and put them to bed or playing the piano.
---
Isn’t a Fallout game supposed to have choices?
---
"Hail Mothman!" *\*entire church t-poses at once\**
---
Just pick one location and server hop till it's there. No need for wasting caps
---
I believe there is an Event by vault 76 at the light house that you collect lightning bugs for and one appears at the end of the event.
---
I just sell chems I don't use. And like, assault rifles.
---
There is but I need one I can kill for the mothman wing :(
---
This was written on the go via cell phone, I think I was on my way to work hence a rushed explanation ,.... my apologies for hurting your delicate sensibility’s with my punctuation ,..and use of comms .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!!!!
---
Thanks, we've already seen some incredible CAMPs... Atom knows what we'll see this weekend on our CAMP Evalathon.
---
I used to hit West Tek.  
---
Excavator Armor helps. Farm Stupid Mutants, keep any Legendaries that drop. Hoard any weapons except sledge hammers and miniguns or rocket launchers. Clear the place and when you get overburdened, store the excess in a random container, preferably away from the entrance. When you're done, grab all the weapons till overburdened again, put Excavator Armor on again, and if still overburdened, scrap any and all pipe weapons, hunting rifles and then scrap or drop any weapons that are least valued in caps, working your way up through value till you can Fast Travel. 
---
I used to get rid anything under 100 caps because when I got to vendor I was only getting 30 or so caps with what my Charisma was back then without using Grape Mentats, beer or a sweetroll or anything. 
---
Fast travel to Whitespring, or a Train Station, put on Hard bargain, and sell.
---
Don't forget the outside and to search chem boxes and bathroom mirrors.
---
Purified water can help in there too as well as running around the witesprings inside, grabbing all the junk items, bulking (Morgantown HS, and AVR Cafeteria for Plastic) junk to sell.
---
Good info thanks! Just rechecked the mod, it has these channels:  
---
* Global Chat (All Servers)
---
* Trade Chat
---
* Group Chat
---
* Clan Chat
---
* Local Chat  
---
So yeah, looks like there are many channels, but not the one you say XD. Which could be quite useful, because sometimes you may want to "find people" for doing some stuff, and the global chat (all servers) can be perfect for that...other times you only wanna tell random people on your server, to come help you on a certain event, or ask if anybody has X on sale etc.  
---
I don't think the lack of that channel will stop me from using it, will have to rely on local which as you say is too short ranged, and the global one.
---
It was worth buying at launch in my opinon
---
Ah, I found one of the salty morons.
---
Calling people who expected a Fallout game to play like a Fallout game “neckbeard purists” is so presumptuous that it hurts.
---
Sometimes I can't respawn anywhere on my current world.
---
Honestly I came in expecting to get angry but you're a class act Jeff
---
It may just be me, but I find him a lot in the south end of the white springs golf course. Two days ago, I saw 2 of them within like 5 minutes back there.
---
I was one of the 'bandwagon-ers' who found much to mock about the game, until I played it and realized it's a lot of fun for what it is.
---
Fuck her right in the buzzblade.
---
Gulper lagoon Pros: lots of water and space for crops, 👑 Enemy always spawns, can semi rarely spawn a 2-3✨Enemy, lots of meat but not great buff, model home in artillery range spawns super mutants, mirelurk kings, hermit crabs etc., heart of swamp event can be near by but rare. Cons: enemies can sometimes disappear upon death reappearing in their starting locations usually hanging from trees they won't activate and can't be searched but I may have been unlucky, I had a scorch beast once.
---
It was a dumpster fire at launch, the negative reviews for fo76 and videos were 100% justified.  It's inexcusable for the game to have launched in the state that it did.  
---
To Bethesda's credit they have done a lot of work and the game has come a long, long way.  
---
All that said I've never played Anthem so I can't compare the 2.
---
Gary? Gaaaaaaaaaaaaary?
---
I have found the mothman most frequently by server hopping the two random event locations near Crevasse Dam.  The mothman frequently appears in the Forest between the two spots.  After spawning, take a right.  The random event spot 1 will be in front of you.  Immediately thereafter there is a road to the left that leads to Braxton’s medical supply.  Take the road and look for the mothman to the right of the first truck.  If you don’t see him, hop, rinse and repeat.
---
I did probably 100 hops of this spot for the Halloween plans and saw the mothman roughly 10 of them.  10% is the best I can offer you!
---
For me, the whole purpose of the mod would be things like:
---
"Anyone want to run a silo together?"
---
"Has anyone seen Grahm today?"
---
which are all server-side variables. I don't have much interest in chatting with the player-base globally, that's what Reddit is for.
---
Thx for the advice , my attempt was to give full information on the situation so as to not have to play “tag” with little questions about the incident . I can be a bit long winded I will take your advice to heart
---
Whitesprings. I'll be waiting for you.
---
I use it. For me, it's mostly useful to see if there's demand for a legendary I picked up or if I'd be better off scripping, but I've also used it to join someone dropping a nuke or whatever. Sometimes it can be a bit much, but most of the time even the global chat is used judiciously. I've only ever seen one n-bomb dropped, which seems like a minor miracle.
---
If you like, you can toggle the global channel on/off but you'd still be connected to the trading channel or any clan channel you join.
---
Its a date. :D
---
Autumn acre cabins Pros: easy kills, can rarely spawn a 3✨, a bobble head can spawn in cabin. Cons: mostly bugs could be good for stings and things but they're all low level, levelled ghouls and a wendigo can spawn but it's not often, I haven't tested this location as extensively though.
---
Wow. Well played!
---
I did workshops extensively and then they were nerfed, then they made it possible for people to challenge the workshops without getting near them, so I stopped. 
---
Scorchbeasts are bullet sponges with no reward so I don't know what the point would be. 
---
I used to enjoy moving my CAMP to the SBQ zone with missile launchers on a switch to pull when she was in range, but it's all repetitive now.
---
It shouldn't be up to the player to make the game interesting. If so, we could just be designing our own games. There are at least 100 members of this group that Bethesda should be hiring for ideas (myself not included).
---
Some of us who farm the Burrows prefer it to stay the way it is. There's plenty of mobs to kill in there, and there's no competition for them. Or are you not doing the robot part so are only complaining about half the dungeon? I've gotten 2 3* and 1 2* enemies on the same pull before
---
Well I’m pretty boring. I named mine “Kara” as I do in every game that has me name my character lol
---
I used to take over all the power plant workshops and farm fusion cores to sell to other players. You can get 7-9 cores every 15 minutes if you own all 3 plants.  Each generator can hold 3 cores maximum so be sure to check every 15 minutes.
---
Easy caps if you sell them for 50-75 caps in your vending machine.
---
Then hit up West Tek and Welch while you wait for your cores to generate or farm White Springs.
---
I only got one and I’m also a touch salty
---
Yes, I want it for similar thing xD.  
---
But can't you do the same questions, find some people interested in same, and no matter if they are in your server or another, add each other, join same server and do the task?
---
It is not the same and I would also like a server chat channel (I Imagine they didnt add it due to technical reasons?) but I think it still works that purpose.   
---
Until I really install it, find out the cross server channel is full of annoying spam, make a few attempts at this, fail and uninstall XD hope not!
---
There are a few things that didn't happen.  You can't just break camps without initiating pvp.  You can't drop more than 2 mines at a time.  It's a nice story though.
---
Best way to kind of force it to happen is to try to get one to spawn at the same random point that the Responder Vendor Bot does, I've gotten Mothman there before.
---
Though that one tends to fly off as soon as you hit him so...
---
Seconding the White Springs comment. I've seen him at the gate down the road from the Guardhouse (that has the ballistic fiber spawn) that's down the road from the Enclave Bunker entrance.
---
Ad Victorium
---
Love this.
---
Very good info thanks! Your answer really inclines me to download it and check it out!  
---
 As a non voice chat user lone wolf, I really need text chat to spice up my game xD
---
I’ve been apart of at least 10 queen fights and never got even one thing of any real use or value lol
---
In that case the article above should help.  It lays out the pros and cons of the game pretty fairly.
---
EX MACHINA
---
There is no more eloquent or artful way to express that which you have spoken.
---
Do one run around and through Whitespring Resort. Gather all the junk, chems, grenades and mines, even weapons and armor. Bulk the junk and sell everything you collected. You will get more than enough caps to move around the map a few times over (and have extra spending caps for player vendors) and the run takes maybe 20-30 minutes.
---
Jeez, I don’t understand why we need such a titan to run this game smoothly
---
stop looking in the mirror and get out more.
---
Hey, that legendary one star wood armor though!
---
got a bloodied 2 star fat man with 50% more damage
---
4 shots? nice! Wait thats like a 5 min fight.. XD
---
Good for you (and the little one) dude! And I say that with absolutely no snark or sarcasm, unlike some of the others. While I get some people play out their game time in ways they couldn't in real life. I also believe that to an extent, your true self shows through in your online demeanor. I mean, I wouldn't abuse an animal in real life just to hear it cry. So in turn, I don't play games like that generally either. I for one find it awesome that you did that, and would have gladly helped you kick that bag of #%cks around to  teach them some manners in defense of the kid. It'd be one thing if he wanted to play along, and encouraged it. But sounds as if it was not the case.
---
Pacifist mode is amazing btw. Unless you play survival
---
Believe in the brotherhood lizzyyyyyyy
---
Like gang busters that wood armor!
---
It happens if it's Wood Armor, which can't support more than one Legendary effect, but sometimes spawns with more than one (notably from the Purveyor).
---
Nicely done.
---
You got Bethesda's attention. Good job. Now go start another thread asking when they'll fix sliding enemies.
---
Only when you get a 3 * Wood armor from the Legendary vendor. . . It's a known bug with that armor set for whatever reason since the Purveyor was released.
---
It was initiated I just didn’t take the time to explain that as it’s fairly self evident.
---
You might be able to loot his body you can also try eating moth man eggs I heard vengeful moth man will come after you but I don't know if that's true.
---
The behemoth pond near Solomons pond Pros: plenty of water and space for crops, behemoth always spawns can be no star legendary and drops lots of stuff including ammo caps Weapons armour etc., Close to white springs and westek, Cons: behemoth can nearly one shot turrets and can often glitch out disappearing on death to reappear in pond Tposing or get back up and run away a short distance in both instances he can't be looted, again I haven't tested this location as thoroughly as I stopped after the glitchy instances.
---
This one has more choices than any of the previous ones because of having actual people in it. You can't really have it so you can make world changing decisions in an online game, but as far as dialog options, you're kind of unrestricted.
---
I don't know either. But there's like 100 comments on this thread agreeing it's way too fast so there's gotta be something to it. PvE is not horrible with it which is why I run with it on my shotgunner, but my PvP sniper? No way is it viable to eat and drink that much when you can't carry a stack of food with you cause you'll drop it upon death, and fast travel is very limited so by the time you get to somewhere you need to be you're out of food and starving.
---
IMO, I wouldn't unless you also dropped the price for them at the Enclave vendor.
---
Really, serum recipes are one of the few Cap sinks the game has by default.  If you are able to acquire them randomly some other way for completely free, it gets awkward.
---
The point of fallout 76 is to create your own adventure as it’s a multiplayer game, team up with others, role play, it is an rpg mmo after all
---
Thank you :) I don't have any issues making caps, but I wanted to offer a viewpoint on travel costs and how I'd prefer to spend my caps is all - i.e. to players :)
---
Multiplayer
---
You only find them in containers after you get the quest.
---
It's a nice feature but wish I could turn it off/on or only allow for whitelisted friends so randoms don't troll by hiding small things to takeup budget. Or whitelisting others to be allowed to move/store things.
---
As for a truly shared camps I dunno if that would ever be possible since it could be abused or basically encourage buying two accounts to double budget... but the distance feels way too strict currently. The circles could be nowhere near touching but still claim you're too close, so it'd be great if that was improved...
---
This is what works for me, as I’m more economical or “correct” ways exist:
---
Loot every bit of junk I can, with heavy focus on asbestos, fiber glass, and antiseptic. I mostly vendor stuff that sells for 2c at the trainstations, the rest I sell in mass (not bulk) on my traders. I try to lowball my number when I rotate through so much junk per session because it’s still money made. There’s no guarantee players will buy at any price so I appreciate the VAST amount of caps I get for pushing inventory so well. 
---
If you wanna cap out on NPC vendor caps, vendor off what you can’t sell to players, such as the massive amount of steel and rubber you acquired from scrapping weapons plus the 2c items above; OR kill high level enemies (at least lvl 40) and sell off all the gear to NPCs.
---
Quick note for you all with farms: mutfruit vendors for 2c each with the Charisma perk Hard Bargain Rank 2 or 3. Mixed with Green Thumb you have easily renewable vendor trash.
---
No part of my method is right or wrong, it just works for now as I learn more efficient ways to farm vendor trash.
---
You framerate snobs make me laugh. Just enjoy the game and stop looking at your framerates...
---
They only cost 18k at the enclave... seems reasonable
---
Its frustrating, thats what it is. i cant do anything about the issue and seeing as the customer service cant or want do anything about it as well is just...sad. sure some bugs are not easily fixed but giving me hope by saying: yes we have a quest reset tool thats just not working RIGHT NOW because our own patch broke our OWN tool but will be fixed soon and just days later saying: we have no idea what we are doing, take care and good luck!
---
Good for you\~ I will be doing the same with my new Melee build. About time these douche bags get some back!
---
Has there been any official statement made about this?
---
Server hop The Whitespring. The car right in front of where you load in.
---
Damn that’s a great price point! Let me sell my first born real quick.
---
Eh. They could downrate too because it’s a boring thing to brag about.
---
It's not about the framerates, it's about how sluggish and inconsistent the performance is. There is a huge impact if things are smooth and then suddenly you are hitching all over the place.
---
yeah i wish it was a skin for under armor that you could apply. Im using road leathers because it provides best boosts for my sneaky build, but it just looks like utter garbage.
---
true
---
To be fair, the other Vaults were probably higher priority for Vault-Tec, seeing as those held experiments and 76 was the only genuine Vault.
---
I started in December and the game was fine, maybe a few minor bugs but no reason to get so bent out of shape over.
---
There are places where you can find power cores on power armor or from generators. The Mount Blair Trainyard has 2 sets of power armor and 2 Power generators you can get cores from. The New River Gorge Bridge West behind the locked door has a fusion core in a power armor. Grafton Dam also has a power armor where you can get a fusion core from. 
---
Yeah, the power armor's cores are at 25 but they help out in a pinch when you're running low.
---
My idea of a Plague Walker build would have a Legendary prefix of some kind. It would do "X% of damage the more diseases you have" similar to the junkies prefix, there could be a passive where the Plague Walker mutation also adds an extra damage punch depending on what specific diseases you acquire. Maybe even have a perk card similar to class freak but for diseases as well.
---
Its not a t pose, obviously we’re... spreading our wings, like the Mothman! Yeah.
---
Any suggestions on what can be done? My SD seems to not work at ALL. I run so slowly, even with perks that assist in faster running. Super bummed too
---
Supply and demand, baby! Think about how many weapons those bots are getting every day vs. how many they sell.  :)
---
A blackberry farm with Hard Bargain was an early caps generator for me.
---
You'd think they'd want people to actually make it there in time though!
---
“It just works” and it totally didn’t, at all.
---
They sale for hella cheap at player vendors
---
Then Fallout shouldn’t be multiplayer if you can’t have a tangible change in the world
---
Great player base. 
---
Yes you can find a corner to call home. You may have to jump servers a couple times if you are in a really popular spot but it’s not bad.
---
Rest stop east of investigators cabin Pros: a random spawn occurs near the trees at the end of the road opposite the rest stop it will be either a lv80 1✨ Sheepsquatch or a lv91 deathclaw or a lv40something mega sloth or a pack of ghouls, a mob spawns in and around the rest stop and is either super mutants mostly or scorched or mole miners, the nuka fridge can have lots of quantum in it. Cons: stuff only spawns when you are near the cabin so you will need to spawn there and run to your camp, the mobs can easily destroy your turrets.
---
They know it's a thing, but it hasn't made it into a patch.
---
And while we'd like it to be fixed in Patch 10, their track record in cleaning up Legendary lists is appalling (see also: "Legendary" Drills and Syringers).
---
"I didn't know OP was nasty"
---
Kara Melissa Benoist, Kara Laura Vandervoot, or Kara Helen Slater?
---
Because, despite the game's overall enoyability, Bethesdha has pulled incredibly shitty moves that should have never even been thought about.
---
And there is a lot of straight up unacceptable issues both in and out of the game that are just as unacceptable.
---
The bag story was an actual scam, the 500 atoms to initially attempt to make up for it is demonstrative of a deep lack of understanding. And let's not forget the customer support tickets that used to be viewable by ANYONE, aka private information and credit card info potentially made available to people who could take advantage of it. This alone is entirely unacceptable.
---
The amount of bugs that are still present and from FO4 are not okay.
---
The adoption of "Release it knowing it's not in an okay state but it's okay because we'll fix it over several years" shows a heelturn in term of respect toward a playerbase.
---
The quick turnaround when it came to the atom shop policy of only containing cosmetics.
---
Any of these issues, even taken separately, are worth taking note and taking your money elsewhere if one would want, but these (and more) all have happened one after another.
---
The game is fun and slowly getting better, but there is an unquestionable amount of shit you have to dig through to get to that.
---
Eso does such a amazing balance of tons of pve and adding in activities to satisfy the endgame itch.
---
Had this happen to me this morning. . . Honestly not really a big deal. Just figured some salty ahole did it for the lulz. But in my defense (or whatever), my switch was actually meant for show as it sits next to my wired electric chair on which I sit atop my camp and. . .
---
 keep an eye out so that hoodlums such as your self aren't stuffing their knickers with my PsychoBuff. Damn little heathens took one too many rads to the head. Get off my damn lawn, or next time I promise you you're sweet milf of a mother will be picking my explosive 5mm rounds out yer arse with a rusty shishkebab.
---
Yes I am! Didnt know that was wondering why it took half a clip from a TS shotgun to down it
---
I completely forgot about pacifist mode lol. Thank you for reminding me about that!
---
I checked it out, thanks!
---
I’m somewhat casual with my build, adjusting it as I play. I assumed a bloodied build would require more END than that. I guess the dr perks, unyielding armor and serendipity take care of incoming damage at low health, to the extent you’re not dying very often?
---
How did you initiate pvp at their camps on their team?
---
You may not know that you can have 5 active characters at once; i.e. you can play toon 1, swap to toon 2, create room 3, go back to toon 1...
---
Best and brightest. Also: good cardiovascular skills
---
I've always got the Daisycutter fat man with the reduced weight legendary effect on hand. The ordinance express perk helps with the ammo but not much when I'm carrying &gt;20 mini nukes.
---
I think the whole burrows needs to be reworked.
---
Yeah, it's also a pretty bad piece so I wouldn't get your hopes too high.
---
**PLAGUE WAAAALKAAAAAA**
---
Fallout has humans in it that have AI behaviors based on RL humans.
---
Kara as in my name lol
---
I really wish we could sell them. I used to take them in FO4 because charisma was broken and I could sell them for fuckloads. I would sell them for cheap in my camp but that takes stash space which is already restrictive, and no one would buy them.
---
Fair enough. I can understand that. :)
---
Theres ballistic shock I think its called? Its a beer that gives 15% more damage with guns but your gun degrades 15% faster while under the effects. And theres a energy weapons one need to find the name though.
---
I dont know about that, Players will need a region they can fall back too when their getting punished by the more deadly high tier mobs or when they start running low on resources from getting their gear wrecked in more high threat areas. Although a CAMP can perform this role there are gonna be times where you might not be able to or want to hold a CAMP in more hostile zones ecspecially with the damage to durability buffs Im suggesting. Surviving will be more resource intense and it will be far less common for people to be sitting on stockpiles of 999 junk
---
I don't know if it was just luck, but I had to wait like 3 minutes before it actually registered me hitting the respawn button, so luckily I didn't have to reset.
---
Or on that gigantic watch we all carry around.
---
I don’t bother with the slow breaking perks and just use the over repairing and improved repair kits during SBQ fights as my Gatling Plasma always breaks halfway through bring her health down a second time. 
---
Frees up perks that are more valuable. You’re on the right path in your thinking. I don’t mind repairing my equipment.
---
Welch station Pros: a mob spawns on the road and around the houses consisting of super mutants or scorched or mole miners all low level so not much threat, a random spawn also appears near the houses fighting the mob this can be a lv50 1✨ Sheepsquatch or a lv30 sentry bot (easy fusion core) among other things, you can place your camp inside the houses and may be able to build inside too but I haven't tested that, a vendor and legendary machine are extremely close
---
Okay. Kara Zor-El then.
---
I left the team after marking their bases and attacked them outside the vault and started pvp b4 I went back to their bases
---
LAAAAGGGH
---
I'm always selling nades and mines, pick up so many in my travels.
---
if you are on PS4 come check out my merchant characters, 90% of my 3 star stuff is 999 caps or below
---
I still can’t finish the overseer’s quest
---
Why? Since when has that been a cornerstone of the game? Should it still be an isometric RPG too?
---
It should be very familiar in theme, controls, and design to anyone that played Fallout 4, and the studio said they wanted to try something new between fallout 4 and 5.
---
Most definitely, totally new to the whole "Selling Legendaries" so I'm glad you were able to correct my mistake. I thought the ammo reduction might be helpful to those who actually use ammo.
---
I'd think its a pretty safe one really. I could see them saying the glowing items/plans/bags is maybe advantageous, or the lock picking sweet spot one. 
---
I've been running mods since the get go basically and haven't really been worried. Maybe I should be, putting 600~ hours on the line for some QoL mods.
---
sorry to burst your bubble, but it really doesnt affect it unfortunately
---
Buy carnivore serum recipe. I know, its 18k, but that serum is easy to craft and you can sell 2 every day to the vendor bots for 1000 caps.... and some purified water for 400
---
I agree. I bought mine and it is a grind every time. It would suck if someone was gifted one just for beating the queen as I’ve killed her a hundred times and no recipe.
---
Lies from Todd over hyping the game, bad PR, shipped out full price buggy as fuck, over priced cash shop items, rampant glitches, ripping customers off, Todd admitting they put the game out half-baked and "didn't expect good reviews" amoung other things. This was a shit show.
---
This. Nice story. Didn't happen.
---
I just killed Vengeful Mothman at the foot of my steps.
---
It has to be the 6th or 7th time I have had to waste it.
---
I didn't know that. Thanks.
---
The serums yes. Recipes no.
---
It sure did hater
---
Ex*actly!* That would've been the proper way to go about it. 
---
Closing it on you can, honestly, only be interpreted as a "\*shrug\* Dunno what to tell you but, you're fucked. Sorry-not-sorry."
---
I think they need to issue a memo which highlights proper etiquette in these kind of situations. As you said, if they had ended it (closed it) on a "we had tools in place to prevent this kind of thing, however, shit went sideways and it broke after the recent patch, but we're working on it and it may be a few weeks or more; sincerely sorry" sort of note, it'd at least convey sympathy and that they're working on it... albeit slowly.
---
You've got *my* sympathies, though. Not that it counts for much :\ heh
---
That was the sound robots make before they self-destruct. Assaultron lasers sounds a bit different. Never seen this bug before, but I've heard of it. Occasionally some creatures out in the wild will explode like robots. Usually its from super mutants. first time I've heard of cricket pulling it.
---
Reduce, Recycle, and Boom
---
Braxton's medical supplies Pros: a mob spawns in the building usually super mutants but sometimes mole miners or scorched, a random spawn in the parking lot can be a lv80 1✨ Sheepsquatch or a mega sloth or a pack of mirelurk kings or anglers. Cons: the mob can hide in the building and shoot the turrets from there, most spawns have ranged attacks which is bad news for your turrets
---
As the storyteller you are responsible for getting across the relevant information that needs to be understood. Omitting that bit of info (when/how yo instigated pvp) makes it seem as if you're making this up to some readers, and you won't change people's minds througg belittling them by claiming that certain facts that are only known to you are "self evident"
---
Also I can only manage only lay 3 mines before they start exploding for me: how did you manage to get down so many?
---
If I had to guess there was a call to the vault before the nukes fell. Theres a couple vaults where the occupants were already inside when the bombs dropped
---
Bethesda is entirely incompetent or lazy when it comes to bugs. Does any other big name company have an actual reputation for how buggy their games are besides Bethesda? Modders usually have to fix their games 'cause Beths fixes end up breaking more things
---
You must be a serious exploiter. You dropped 2 map markers? Initiated PvP with teammates, or away from those teammates? If you really want to be a hero you submit these bugs in a ticket to Bethesda. However, it takes a special type of villain to lie about being a hero.
---
Y U delete?
---
Yes it is. It's built to be totally able to be played alone. I've managed to do the main story entirely alone save at the very end where someone helped me defend some robots before I could launch a nuke. I had all the materials and everything for it obtained alone. Other players feel more like a bonus, running into cool people and sometimes they give some old plans for armor/food you can use. 
---
TLDR: It's great for single player.
---
if anything, their clothes. on all my legit characters i end up wearing the vault suit and party hat for like 30 levels until i find a costume worth switching to, meanwhile mules are rolling around in red dresses and crazy masks
---
Remember when all guns were broke? Oh wait .....that didn't happen.
---
Oooh, I only play PVE.
---
It’s funny - the criticism the game gets is generally not-at-all focused on what’s actually wrong, frustrating to the real players or needs to be improved for new players.  
---
They focus on things like the canvas bag and “lack of NPCs” - while ignoring legitimate criticisms like that duping gets patched within hours but 3-4 legendary ‘de-star’ bugs persist for weeks at the expense of player time. 
---
As well sometimes there is frustrating vagueries in communication or the delayed aspects of the roadmap, removal of atom shop item functionality with no timeline for return (eg punch bowl), missing plans (kegs) etc. 
---
Just as a caveat to all this - i do understand that things at scale are harder then it seems from a surface-level &amp; full respect to the devs for what they’ve done and the good things they continue to put out. 
---
I just wish they would elaborate or touch on well-known issues / content timelines a bit more. 
---
All this being said - let’s see what Sunday brings at Bethesda’s E3
---
Seriously then you delete it? You are now tagged as a dishonest liar.
---
Vengeful jump scared me there last week.
---
Tses were broken
---
Im not going for hyper realistic in any sense, but its more along the lines of common sense like punching steel plated robots are probably gonna mess up your fist weapons if their not designed to puncture or being able to go toe to toe with a 50 foot mutated giant alone with a golf club etc. Different enemies should have different approaches that work best. For example why doesnt anybody use flamers? Well because any other weapon can do the same job better right? Thats a problem! We have all these different weapon variety that never gets touched in most cases. Why dont people lay down mines before they engage a death claw or behemoth to cripple them? Theres no need too because ofcmy previous stated reason. In a way currently a lot of weapons could be removed from the game and no one would really notice cause nobody uses them (Broadsider/Rocketlauncher/Fatman/Flamer/Grenadelaunchera)
---
While head shots do the most damage they also have the lowest percentage to hit. I play a sniper and my primary targets are legs.  Most of the time it’s the least armored high percentage shot,and if it’s not a kill shot it’s a high probability of crippling thee limb. Nothing like a mob of ghouls crawling and limping towards you at a snails pace to really put a smile on a your face. 
---
The other plus to crippling the leg assaultrons become far easier to handle when they are crawling on their belly vs running around crazy with their blender hand and face laser.
---
I’m on the market a lot and you dickheads downvote hurts my ability to trade with people
---
Officially a filthy liar.
---
They're a liar sooooo
---
Specific legendary weapons. Not all guns. The same issue occurs with a combat knife you pick up or a 3* legendary bat. Not the same thing at all.
---
But they're a liar.
---
Yup, 9 times out of 10 that's where I see people pop in at my camp. I'm right in front of Pleasant Valley Station, on the highway. So to split the difference of having enough flat buildable area + plenty of access to the water/dirt for resources, I put my C.A.M.P. right by the broken guardrails. And this is where people generally spawn into my camp. For me, for whatever reason it's about 70/30 that I spwan just North of my camp by the railroad tracks. No idea exactly why, but the other ~30% I spawn into the spot I first dropped it. I can imagine though that with some of the camp setups/locations that the spawns could get a little wonky. Probably the people that are griping that you're FoS, but who knows, lol.
---
Don't get too hopeful. They were lying.
---
If they would have communicated it like you did right now, we would not have this conversation and your sympathies do count, as well as all the complaints of other players with the same problem. shed some light on issues like this and maybe they will get fixed sooner rather then later.
---
This is what I do in a pinch to get my daily 1400
---
I had the same problem I hoped servers and searched everywhere and gave up next day looked up locations and went to think it's called battlefield cemetery but its center up north of the map cemetery beside where u can loot all the black powder weapons. First try there got the mission and camera.
---
Yes. I have "the Guarantee" from the survival challenge... Every once in a while, I have to nuke some stuff for fun to cut weight, but it's still super fun and the range is killer. (I run a HW Build with Bear Arms, but not Ordinance Express).   
---
I also use a Quad Instigating \*\*\* Missile Launcher with Targeting Computer, and a SICK \*\*\* Auto-Grenade Launcher (Instigating + Limb Damage + weight reduction).  The AG launcher is fantastic for groups, not so much for finding the bodies afterwards... and yes, I'm often slogging around over-encumbered. :)
---
It's more of a pain with all the new quests that spawn mob waves. Solo stuff isn't as big a deal
---
Who is a liar? Did I miss something? Lol.
---
Looks that way
---
Most of this games bad reviews came from anger and frustration for Bethesda. They seemed to handle a lot of issues very poorly back at launch. And then of course most people love to ride the hate trains, whether they have investment in it or not.
---
*the only other two DPS builds
---
Steel sells well at player vendors btw. Lots of bullets to be made
---
Can confirm.
---
It should really be on every screen instead of a sub menu. That always bugged me.
---
Not all heros wear capes.
---
i have a secret spot to farm plastic that this happens at. Its unmarked and still sort of secret to most so its not all the time but when i get there and its all gone i get kinda salty. 55ish plastic from a single room is pretty nice though
---
Anthem wasn't out yet. B)
---
Thanks for my medic explosive DB
---
:-)
---
Atom requires this farm . SMITE HIM!!!
---
Haha, I've been telling not buddies this for a long time. When you're writing up a support ticket, try to use key words. Make em clear. When they guys read the key words, it's faster for them to help. Faster for them in general. Win win.
---
Furious with fire rate lmgs, bloodied explosive is probably in the top 5 also
---
Thank you so much!!!
---
(Gets upset nobody walks into his Radiation death maze)
---
Btw, you can just sell junk and weapons anywhere in the region for the quest to count. Not just events 😁
---
the OP told a story with impossible mechanics in order for them to look like a hero. When they couldn't efficiently explain how they achieved it. they deleted the post. I would suggest tagging this person and avoid trading with them as this kind of makes OP seem like a dishonest person
---
I wish she gave out some sort of pvp daily to get tokens for exclusive nuka world gear.
---
Awesome! Thank you so much 😊
---
I had one of my light mysteriously glow as bright as the sun. Hadn't changed anything in my camp, fixed itself the next time I played.
---
Drugs and assault rifles. America in a nutshell.
---
Dude, everyone who heart emotes at me...my first thought;
---
Creepy.
---
Powered doors with keypads will close a few seconds after you enter the pass code
---
Did this ever get fixed? This was my favorite outfit to ballistic weave in FO4 and it sucks that you can’t use it like the rest of the outfits in 76.
---
Very interesting comment, as it seems you have a long experience using them in 76.
---
I agree the glowing mods give an advantage text chat mod doesnt, so it should be safe.
---
The perk manager mod in the other hand, while a needed QoL feature could be more in the grey line of "not giving an advantage"
---
Adrenal Reaction and Talons
---
I do have some repair kits saved up but have been hesitant to use them, I'm gonna make the changes. Thanks for the advice!
---
Aluminum isn’t rare if you mine the ore. There’s the cliff sides behind black water mine and if you run across the railroad bridge in Watoga there’s a path to the right, follow it around and up, jump down on the other side by the weird statue and look along the base of the cliffs. There’s cave with a bunch of aluminum ore in it. You can gather a couple hundred ore in minutes. 
---
It’s light so I keep it as ore unless I need the scrap. Then it’s 3 acid and 2 ore for 5 scrap. It’s pretty easy once you find it. 
---
I hear you on the pricing though, I just figured I’d say something about it being rare
---
Reclamator or "Best and brightest"
---
In my opinion, hell yeah. Been playing since launch and still has me eager to play. They have been doing a great job adding in and fixing stuff. And the community in game market stuff is really fun endgame.give it a shot, it’s cheap enough to take the chance on.
---
the only way I see pistols being useful is with adrenaline/gun fu/vats crits
---
I got it for free early on and it wasn't worth it. Fast forward to now and I've been playing it quite a bit. I'd bite at that price. 
---
Also, mostly a solo player and highly immersed. To answer your question from another response.
---
I can't say for sure if it was there from the start, but it has been around for a while. Just an odd interior space that doesn't have a connection to anything.
---
I went on google in search of how to take off eviction from my public records and most people on different forums kept talking about a professional . and how fast, affordable and reliable he is...I then went ahead, and told him my issues with my records. His response to my mails made me calm and optimistic about the whole thing. I made a down payment for the job and he cleaned my public records in 3 days. What a relief!...Now i don''t have to worry anymore and its so amazing. Fix your credit report by contacting him and by the time he''s done with your job, do not hesitate to spread words about his services to people in need of a professional hacker because i''m very sure you''d be glad you hired him for the job.

I live on the lead node north of Huntersville. Mothman has spawned 3 times there and the flatwoods monster once. Idk if that spot is a spawn point but I can't think of any other camp spot since beta that I've had this happen at all.
---
Maybe I should start selling cram, too. Fatty, kinda gross, not much nutritional value...
---
98 NAR regional Pros: close to white springs, a mod can be in one of the overturned train cars to the left of the sentry, and the sentry bot which is both a pro and a con drops a 75% fusion core and various ammo 5.56, .50, 5mm missiles, but it will tear your camp apart if you let it, laser turrets which the sentry is weak to and missile turrets will help but even with you helping out you'll suffer heavy losses here and end up doing more repairs than anything, I wouldn't recommend this spot unless you can destroy the bot in a few shots but if you can do that then a turret camp is redundant
---
Well at least you didnt just go up to him and blow his brains out.
---
Where at?  Anything good?
---
I honestly don't know since I don't play on them, but judging by the posts on the sub, I'm guessing yes.
---
Not effective vs the queen, but good againt its mobs.
---
How does one join this association? Is it platform specific? I play on Xbox.
---
The games are nothing alike but okay: They were both decent games but had significant technical and gameplay issues. 
---
Also, many Fallout fans consider 76 to be worse than 4, which in turn they consider to be worse than all previous FO games.
---
I pick it up and make bulk fertlizer to either sell in my vending machine or to a vendor.
---
I have a vending machine full of free stuff at my camp. It's intended for low level players, but of course the people who grab up the free .38 are all level 100+. Rassin' frassin'...
---
Anyway. Nobody touches the free mini nukes and missiles. I literally cannot give them away.
---
Alternatively, a lot of new players probably don't want a shit ton of loot and plans from the get-go because it might soil their experience of getting it on their own.
---
Yesssss!!!!
---
What do you mean "single"? All same-level foundation?
---
Yeah I really wish this would be fixed. It was my favorite outfit in FO4 but at least there we had ballistic weave. If you want to be a berserker just unequip your armor I don’t know why this would be like that.
---
Low level ghoul dungeon and in Morgan town first checkpoint for Back on the Beat.
---
Interesting. I find with pianos specifically I haven’t been able to despite trying to leave space but I’ll try tonight again and see if I can pull it off
---
You're the only salty one. FYI, Im setting up my vendors on 4 switches now. Try to figure out how to shut them all off. 😂🤣
---
Nope. Gonna keep mine on a switch. Tru to get to it. 😘
---
It's just like hating on call of duty was the cool thing years ago. Even now I see people who clearly have never played it or have no idea what the game's like shitting on it just because it's cool to do so. Just gotta ignore it and make sure you don't give clicks or attention to provide a further incentive to make money off it
---
Most of the bugs people complained about had nothing to do with it being an online game though.
---
Thanks for admitting that you're crying over it, so Is this game worth buying now lad?
---
No problem. Again, I hope your issue gets solved. Sounds like a really frustrating one :/
---
I was talking about anthem.
---
The Reclaimers
---
The Appalachian Wastelanders
---
The SeventySixers
---
All those are names I use to desribe the us, the Vault Dwellers from Vault 76. We few, we happy few. We band of brothers. For he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.
---
Nice!
---
Ill have to check it out, thanks
---
The entire brotherhood of steel were presumably murdered and turned into scorched but this seems weird?
---
Just have it be damaged or something. Maybe the eye lenses out.
---
I stay with a good location for weeks at a time. Itd just be great and as-expected to move the building and pop it right up elsewhere
---
That would completely eliminare all builds from the game.
---
If your gonna make melee suck against enemies then you also need to remove all melee perks and just vive them the 60% buff straight outta box.
---
If different enemies require different weapons that would mean that the player would have to have all perks and thats just not possible.
---
your gonna piss off a lot of people by making certain weapons required to beat certain enemies.
---
And also the whole weapon balanse is a mess, the most advanced guns in the game (laser rifles) are outperformed by scrap metal (pipe guns)
---
Just let her follow her dreams ffs
---
Interesting! I don't do explosives, so I am glad some people can use it. When I drop what I think is worthless, I'll try to put it out of the way so someone doesn't see a bag and get all exited.
---
To those that find my rotting meat bags at the train station in the future and don't want them: Sorry.  :D
---
To be fair, anthem has missed some original deadlines, but they put out content much faster than 76 does and the game is much much smoother. I like both but it’s hard to say 76 is doing much better in terms of post launch support.
---
Definitely worth it at that price. Get it. My wife got it for me for $40 on black Friday and no regrets.
---
&gt; Maybe even have a perk card similar to class freak but for diseases as well.
---
Diseases are all penalty, bro.
---
I don't mean to highjack the thread, but I don't want to create another just for this one question.  Can I build a pretty decent looking camp without spending in the atomic shop?  Are there looks like a log cabin, hardwood floors available, and if so, can I build in that style without the shop?  
---
Appreciate any help!

I wish the quantum grenade explosion radius was more than six inches. I spent months making and hoarding them for a rainy day, then one day I use them and find out they're garbage. At that point nukashine was a thing, so I just saw 70 wasted nukashines in my inventory
---
Yeah, I don't enjoy it much as an actual gameplay space.  It's a bit confusing to navigate and one Ghoul attack usually turns into a dozen pouring out from everywhere.
---
The BOS and Enclave are one in the same. We transport technical data and receive payment.
---
Speaking in terms of legendary effects? Bloody is on top with 80% under 20% health.  For weapons? Very build dependent.  Overall highest sustained damage is gonna be an LMG.  Automatic Vats/Crit build? Railway Rifle.  I don’t PvP, this is strictly pve here.
---
I feel that the Fatman gets a bad wrap. the Meta is that they suck, but in my experience they wipe out standard mobs with no problems. I have seen a single shot clear out a group of 6+ glowing ones in a nuked Whitesprings more than once.

The thorn and Forward station alpha (and the other missile bases) I tried these spots because I thought they'd be able to take down scorch beasts by combining the ASAMs with the camp turrets, this may still be possible but I died trying it solo so I can't offer much here, I did see a Sheepsquatch between the thorn and Forward station alpha it was near a herd of radstags alpha had a 3✨ Gutsy when I arrived and lots of ammo boxes explosive boxes medkits etc. If memory serves there is a small spot of water in a ditch close by, I need to try these again with a group for more thorough testing
---
RIP Punch bowl. Never got to Nukashine you.
---
You can add to your pile with all the “3star” wood arms I’ve pulled.
---
I have also capped every day on two chars and got nothing but garbage.
---
It got fixed for a little bit, but it's been back for a while now
---
It's funny when this first came out with the patch/update, I loaded the game at WS after my last play thru the day before and there the guy was sprawled on on the hood of the Chryslus I had no idea who or what it was all about. I almost walked by but was like this is new.
---
Melee would still be viable, there are plenty of enemies that you could still melee scorched, ghouls, bugs, mole rats, wolves/dogs, mutants, even the enemies I mentioned that would have a buff, like robots, if you mod your weapon to do puncturing damage it will negate their durability damage, also I'm not saying to nerf melee damage, there are people that can one shot a lot of mobs at the moment, and even with these changes people will STILL be able to melee these enemies. It's just going to be more difficult as it should be. If you manage to best a Deathclaw melee in single combat, now it's gonna feel x3 better knowing that it was actually a challengea nd not just another punching bag. and I did mention some of the changes would actually place Laser weapons above ballistic weapons in certain situations (Flame weakness for ghouls/insects) I remember the BoS mowing down ghouls with laser weapons, this would bring that back! Sure people are gonna get pissed off because of changes. But I mean... When are they NOT pissed off? xD
---
I’m convinced its left unaddressed to get back at all the shit talkers in this subreddit.
---
Yeah drove me nuts. I must’ve taken 20 pics before the one I top atop the statue counted
---
I can't believe being bothered by frame stuttering makes you a framerate snob
---
I'm on PC! What's your IGN?
---
Not Strange in Numbers. Class Freak. It strictly lessens the negatives of mutations. It's found in luck.
---
How did i know? I bought one at the nuka factory at low level and it gave me the quest.
---
Yeah I assumed the Holotape(s) and MODUS would explain that the Power Armour the Scorched has is the Brotherhoods Power Armour, it's broken but the scorched have figured out how to use it now. 
---
Showing that the hive-mind is not only intelligent but is also adapting new technology based on humanity's tech for its own use.
---
found the fair grounds is good for cloth drink cups all over
---
Aye
---
There's one in Welch, next to the building just down the hill from the train station. There's another at the Mount Blair trainyard next to one of the many outbuildings. It's one near a rock face I believe. They look just like the ammo and aid machines.
---
I server hopped at Willys about 6 times for Ansel to show up.
---
If he didn't, I went inside to take out frustration on the scorched.
---
Scored a bobblehead and a deathclaw hide at the green lockers by the wavepool :)
---
Please explain to me how I'm the salty one. I enjoy turning off the switches to stop people who do this from getting any visitors.
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
and your advice for the person with alt # 3?    They do not allow respec of points without spending 20 levels... 1-50 is faster than 250-270.   Such a lame system.
---
Damn! You sure showed me, buddy!
---
Sunrise field, I haven't tested this spot because I was solo again and got destroyed, but a mirelurk queen spawns there as well as mirelurk kings it's really close to watoga station so vendor and legendary machine but scorch beasts are common there too so be warned personally I think if you're going queen fishing try toxic valley or the mire instead it's safer, well maybe safer isn't the best word queenie will melt your turrets so you'll need to shield them
---
So so so so so so so so painful to get the mods I want for it. I crafted 20 of them, scrapped them all, and got 1 mod I didn't want.
---
Don't shoot them when they're mating. Bad juju.
---
Is that their typical response reasoning?
---
Very true. I am a long fan of fallout series but this is not bad ether. They wanted to try something new, said don't build up your expectations. Its a lot better then Diablo moving to mobile games, compared to that this could grow into something great.
---
I kinda hope we can Prestige our character and reset all our quests. Want to do the missions over again (and maybe wait until level 50 this time) but don't want to lose my unlocks (recipes, plans, etc) or my Stash.
---
Brahmin my man ha ha good times.
---
Fallout 4 had you changing the wasteland, it’s always been like that. Since forever has mattering in the wastes - having choices that mean something - been a cornerstone of the franchise.
---
I don't use any mods. As for the dev reaction, what they said in the start was basically that it's fine as long as it doesn't give you a clear advantage (I believe people got banned for one that instantly picked locks).
---
I just found out what you meant by this.
---
I created a twitter or rather discovered I already had one. Contacted the HOA and they are going to allow me to submit my video as The Scallywag now be in Davey Jones's Locker. But now I know how to upload videos to YouTube and reddit, you can be sure to see more of my builds.
---
Oh so thats what Lucky Strike is. Been watching Ash Heap events for that one to pop up. Thank You.
---
whats a cd? my 75 Pontiac has an 8 track with Neil diamond stuck in it  "[Song Sung Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_Sung_Blue)",
---
We are due my brother!
---
Bought my first map in B.E.T.A., was curious about what the machine sold.
---
It only happens when she realizes she is in West Virginia
---
There is either a terminal or a safe in there connected to the unmarked quest/note+keys trail for the Quantum Power Armor paint plans. I don't remember which, but I had to look up a walk through to do it correctly.
---
I was thinking explosive with furious gatling laser, explosive with bloodied or two shot laser guns, TSE 10 mill sub or bloodied. There is probably a sniper and shotgun build that could reach god their yea?
---
I love you.
---
I'm assuming it's more complicated to code then it let's on much like many of the bugged features.
---
Dealing with massive database pulls and reads through the code that made this game makes many things interconnected meaning one small "easy" change could cause a cascade of unwanted effects(example would be the glitch when you used emotes when holding a camera and were launched across the map). Coding is hard, especially when your essentially trying to code something that would be the equivalent of making a Honda civic cross the Atlantic ocean.
---
It's been there for at least a couple months. I fully explored it on my alt and that was a bit ago.
---
I haven't had an issue with my radium. It only does slightly less ballistic as my handmade but it's hardly noticeable in pve combat. The fire rate seems a little more noticeable though. I do however wish they would buff the radiation damage to at least 25 though.
---
Thank god I'm not the only one, I noticed a significant decrease in performance the last month. I'm having the exact same issue as you are. In some places fps is great, in other places it just drops like a brick. I tried all the "fixes" I found online but nothing is helping.
---
Going through the Whitesprings grounds and picking up all the Golf Clubs and Golf Balls can be a pretty good source of Plastic as well.
---
Which is salty. You answered your own question. 🤣
---
You're upset they make it easy for themselves to turn on and off.
---
So you turn them off to upset them and prevent them from making caps.
---
Salty or Greifer. Take your pick.
---
Hey man all of that was well said. Agree completely
---
Because both caps and guns are already obnoxiously easy to get in this game. Also please don't exaggerate it, you can get 40+ caps each without investing into charisma by selling some of the assault rifles from super mutants. A single run through west tek should get you 1000 caps just from selling their gear
---
US13-C bivouac Pros: close to westek, ammo boxes, a fusion core can spawn in one of the tents a 3✨ can spawn, you'll find super mutants, wolves, ghouls, bugs, and probably more, Cons: where I placed my camp which I thought was the best spot was too close and I suffered the killed to quick no loot for you curse the other spot though was down the hill so if you place there use a tall tower to get better visibility or camping behind the camp, where I was I'd suggest sitting there and having a buddy leave and rejoin to respawn enemies
---
There is a radio in the area that plays patriotic music next to one of the brick buildings.
---
I've been playing this game for some time, it's always been there, and I've never ever been able to find the source.
---
Yeah the first that I saw jump scared me too. Had to cook it with the flamer I was using.
---
Iv had several sqeekers call me a dirty ni***r... So they are not too concerned about it...
---
There's nothing in this game difficult enough to necessitate a full time healer or tank. I wish there were, but there isn't. Everything is easily soloable, and that includes queen and project paradise. An argument could be made for imposter sheepsquatch, but that requires 3 warm bodies, not specific builds.
---
Very true. It's like putting a new engine in an old car somewhere down the line and old part is going to break.
---
Nice one Rosyarus!  Keep up the good work :D
---
Nah, I just think you're pretty stupid if you leave a switch out in the open to turn off your machines. I will turn them off to punish you and hope you're smart enough to learn from your mistake.
---
Still, I have absolutely no clue why you think I'm salty... 
---
I don't think you understand what "salty" actually means.
---
As I said some ppl want to meet new ppl and make friends
---
The problem you have faith in RNGESUS. Come to the right side. The side of light. 
---
Praise be to L O O T C I F E R.
---
Ah forget the raiding bring on the hookers!
---
Might have been having a pregnancy thing.
---
Synths in Appalachia confirmed!
---
I use them on the big mamajammas like the SBQ and MLQ.  I have a two shot, very handy for cleaning trash mobs out of an area.
---
I bet someone with a lazer cutter/engraver would make a killing selling decorative Fo76 themed wood or metal discs to go in those cases, or just in general. Esp if they offer to customize it with your (used) game code.
---
Oh, and I'd add a bloodied melee build alongside as a glass cannon option. I expect we'll see a lot more of those in the next few weeks with the free GG legendary.
---
I've really enjoyed the game, but recently walked into a bug that ignores 3+ hours of questing and reverts you back to some form of earlier "save" with a lower level character. This was after I continued playing on in several more sessions, wasting 5+ hours of my time.
---
For me that's been the killer. I'm told I can get past that bug by playing the entire quest line in one go, redoing 3+ hours. Meh, I'm back to single player games after that.
---
A shame, because it turns out I've really enjoyed 76. But when you have limited play time those type of bugs aren't really excusable.
---
Sorry for the low price, I'm just low on caps but thank you though.
---
TMS TM-01 Pros: close to legendary vendor murmurgh or whatever her name is, a plan can spawn there, expect anglers gulpers bugs, i haven't tested it too much so other stuff may spawn, the anglers are great for adhesive though
---
I think the idea was to have this new under armor idea as the armored vault suit but per player tastes.
---
It would be nive to have it looks like the Fo3 version tho with it as an outfit. That and the leather armor from Fo3 as well. The road leathers just aren't cutting it for me. All the other armor pieces on top just hide the leather.
---
It wasn’t the only genuine vault
---
Not all events are timeable, honestly.
---
Like killing the SBQ for example.  A timer could say that there are 20 minutes left to kill her.  But a timer can't tell you that she's going to die 15 seconds from now because she's being massacred by high-level people with good builds.
---
Working around things like that is probably part of the holdup.  They have to figure out how to do it in a way that makes sense across the board, when Events are often a matter of "percentage completed" and "time left," not just one or the other.
---
If I remember correctly, the inhabitants of 76 entered a week or two before the bombs
---
I love that idea, but I would really love just a food and drink tab in the pipboy. I hate having to wade through all this other irrelevant nonesense when my character needs to eat or drink.
---
Mine is unmodded but sometimes Will grant me the plus 200
---
But eventually after alot of break downs you'll have a brand new carrrrrr
---
If I see a level 1 in the vault, I go to the Overseer's camp and drop a power armor chassis, a few power cores, a tricked out .44, a stack of ammo, armor, and a gas mask. Then go hide invisible and watch them find it all there.
---
That's a great idea.
---
I gave a 3* bloodied TS gauss to a lvl 40 yesterday. He was pumped and let me pull fusion cores from his mining rig.
---
I tried entering the burrows yesterday and it wouldn't let me in. Something about available at another time. Perhaps too crowded?
---
I've seen this as well at the central railyard multiple times with both Super Mutants and Scorched.
---
Havent seen eggs so maybe those bastard push out full grown bats
---
This is from the perspective of a player who paid full price for the game at launch and after everyhting they have done i would say its worth it at full price. Especially with the road map and stuff coming soon. 
---
If i knew nothing else was coming and they didnt fix anything i would say dont buy the game. 
---
But with all the fixes and everything coming up the game is worth the buy. Would i pay full price right now? No i would not since they have yet to release the new content. But if its on sale for 45 dollars or less i would say its worth it. 
---
I went above and beyond and joined a BOS roleplay group and the roleplay possabilities this game has are huge. Especially if they bring in rented servers and allow mods. 
---
But please do not pay full price for this game. I do not beleive a company deserves to get full price for a game if it has a crappy release.
---
and increase their level.
---
Empath mutation maybe?
---
Hey buddy I’ve got your back now, and in fact for the last week or so.  Go ahead, get a good roll.  I’ll cover for you.
---
Dildos for the Dildo throne!
---
Wait... Wrong god...
---
That's why they can get away with dragging their feet on the fix. You can still do a lot of fighting without batting it's just impossible for flying and hopping people
---
Was there an actual in-game message that blocked the screen? Or a notification on the top left?
---
So far no fix. Let's keep hoping.
---
I too adore it. I briefly played with the thought of recreating Cricket in 76 and scream through my mic with a coarse nasal voice: "C'mon, c'mon. Get your guns here. Small booms. Big booms. I got 'em all."
---
No mutations, no diseases..
---
Since my explosive shotgun got nerfed I may have to pick up the fatman again. My shotgun used to deal more damage than it
---
Yeah but making ballistic weapons overall good and melee suck against robots is just gonna make people not play melee.
---
Why play melee when you stil need the same ampunt of perk cards but you have to carry a rifle anyway but a rifle player doesnt need to carry a melee weapon.
---
And it will feel as good as the sense of pride and accomplishment when you unlocked darth vader in battlefront 2... as in, it wont.
---
It’s always been there
---
That's all I've got for now but there's probably many more locations like that, I'm going to try scouting along the highway, the train tracks, the waterways, and the various unmarked locations and resource deposits looking for more, I hope I've been of some help.
---
I think the ghoul part is intended. Ghouls always attack in a rush with numbers. That's what makes them viable as an opponent.
---
We think. At this point in time. VTU's actual experiment could be what happens when people emerge 25 years later and have to complete tasks given to them by a bunch of dead people. Your boss is a fuckin ninja (seriously sometimes it feels like you're only minutes behind the Overseer) she could be watching us from the hills... collecting data waiting for the right moment to reveal Vault-Tec's true motives for V76
---
Umm hello! I would love to learn this golden secret!
---
Worked for me 15 min ago. What is your luck?
---
Either way it's good to check on your camp.
---
Ad Victoriam, brother, cheers from the Wasteland.
---
I guess it depends on what you mean by choice. Bethesda games are a sandbox and you can adapt to your preferred play style in that sandbox.
---
In FO3 you could go with Megaton or the luxury tower. Outside of that is was a pure railroad in terms of the plot. You could choose to do "good" acts or "evil" acts.
---
FO4 let you choose the faction you support, which impacted the quest line you branched into and the end game "winner".
---
Actually dialogue and character choice are cosmetic. Be nice, be mean, be sarcastic or be neutral.
---
Most RPGs are actually the same once you remove the rose tinted glasses. Take Deus Ex - three endings depending upon what lever you pull. Nothing else matters. Choice was your actions in the game and alternations to reflect that.
---
Mass Effect - same quest with paragon or renegade choices. End cut scenes reflected your choices, at least in 2 I think. ME 3 was back to pull one of three levers - that's the ending.
---
Some do it better than others, but Bethesda is pretty much the same when it comes to choice - choose what play style you want as you go through the quests in a sandbox environment.
---
FO76 choice is perks, character build, and drops. Everyone has the same exact quests given through tapes and robot npcs. Nothing in the world changes based on your actions (aside from your workshop) because it'd impact everyone else.
---
That's why I only play in adventure mode with pacifist on
---
Ok....that's a lot for an inaccurate gun with an inaccurate primary effect and useless secondary /tertiary effects. The only thing this gun had going for it it the paper damage number and the number of stars it has.
---
I am guessing you exited and walked down to the left? 
---
To the right is a parking and the road that leads up to the Vault.
---
one foundation on the ground. One stair up from there. Everything else hung off that stair. Basically a house sitting on a pedestal.
---
You can almost always place that anywhere you want.
---
😂😂
---
If you're on xbox and experiencing this try uninstalling and reinstalling the game. A few of the game files may be fudged from updates. You should not lose any progress on any characters.
---
It works it isn't bugged.
---
 There is a bug where it gives you an extra carry weight boost a lot of the time.
---
One mans trash is another mans treasure!
---
Even though i have all the weapons i need atm, it would be nice with new ones 👍
---
Was you camp build budjet max?
---
I think The store inv resets after you move the store, all the items should be in your camp inv.
---
Going to lose karma here but no its not worth it purchasing, wait for it to be free to play. Im lvl 200+ and in my opinion not worth it at $30.
---
Drawbacks
---
\- Tons of bugs example newest dlc added a dungeon/event and upon entering I crashed every time and attempted 16 times in a row (Using Xbox X). 
---
\- Patches get undone randomly where it brings back old bugs
---
\- Major bugs are only found out by the best of the community that actually do the digging, example critical damage bonus from perks not working since day 1 was barely found out not to be working.
---
\- RNG system needs work, even with current increased chances thanks to legendary vendor the gear you want is nearly impossible to find unless you buy it from someone who has it 
---
\- Bethesda not known for fixing games in the long run, example play Fallout 4 has bugged they have fixed in Fallout 76 but Fallout 4 like Lever Action Rifle reload bug where you fire 1 bullet and need to reload 5 bullets.
---
\- Stash limit forces most senior players to make alts and if you transferring stuff you can lose it to the random server crashes and even lost my main gear because of it
---
Positives
---
\- If you into pvp this is the game for you with the next major dlc being battle royale and even has pvp servers
---
\- If you LOVE fallouts series its a must buy since I loved Fallout 3 and 4 so I bought the Tricentennial edition and nice to finally play with friends.
---
\- Camp system nice little system letting you build your base in most places of the world 
---
\- New content drops planned for all this year
---
\- Micro transactions are mostly cosmetic with exception of repair kits
---
\- Interesting stories but its all listening to holotapes and reading old notes/terminal entries
---
\- Bigger map then Fallout 4 (Map is actually even longer then whats allowed to travel in so we might see dlc where we get further access to the map)
---
\- Lots of easter eggs to find from classics related to movies to tv shows
---
In short if you ok with bugs and I mean LOTS of them but enjoy fallout enough to ignore them then even if they really negatively effect you then buy it but if you not okay with bugs then go buy a Triple A game heck even Metal Gear Survive is bug free.
---
They aren't.
---
Sorry bud This will not happen
---
As a nocturnal weapon user and sun kissed dependant player an easy way to tell time without having to dig through pip boy menus would be great.
---
Cool story bro
---
Right but this is not, and was never meant to be fallout 5. Hopefully that comes along some day, but this is it's own unique hybrid game. It sucks that you're bored but its kept many players going for a long time as well. When I get bored of a game I play something else for a while.
---
block, report, and move on.
---
Ever since I found out that you can craft fertilizer from spoiled food, I always pick up any I see. Free caps basically.
---
Honestly, just give me a more consistent and rewarding grind.
---
None of the game is rewarding enough right now.
---
They should honestly pull out all the quests and fix the locations, combat mechanics, and PvP, then work on grindable events. Then they can fix atom based challenges, then they can fix achievements, then they can fix storyline based questing.
---
The current state of grind in this game is deplorable.
---
I was grabbing my food at Genghis Grille when I read this post and burst out laughing, they thought I was crazy lol. You monopolized raider !!
---
&gt;I loved 76 until they stopped adding content.
---
Huh? They've been adding content on a constant and regular basis... how long has it been since you played? I'm honestly not trying to be rude, I just do not understand what you mean by that statement sure, some were just events like Fashnacht,  but others like imposter sheepsquatch/real sheepsquatch were both fun quests and good regular events...the scouts quests and events are wee bit on the lower level but still was fun and productive for the back packs and mods...Arkos is insanely chaotic yet a ton of fun if you know the group you are with and very profitable...the barrows can be fun and again certainly profitable. Biv  is funny and the daily quests can sometimes take you on unexpectedly fun romps A bunch of new random encounters added too that you just just don't see if you fast travel everywhere...in short they've added ton of content this year so far, all the while fixing bugs and add QOL and more to come.
---
I get FO76 is not for everyone and that's cool, if we all like the same things there wouldn't be enough for everyone and it would be boring. If you don't like, cool, move on. If you're on the fence and you'd like it so much more if it only did "X", then write it up, submit it and start advocating for it. Bethesda has been pretty good about listening to feedback and even implementing it fairly quickly, so find you X and evangelize it! 
---
Cheers
---
That could explain why the SB Queen is so surly
---
It doesn't require a mic, this dude is complaining about nothing
---
Go to the mothman museum, collect the eggs from the statue and from the "temple" down by the river. Cook them into omelettes and eat a bunch. I am guessing it is magic or ESP, but the vengeful frakker always turns up after I had a good fill with his babies. Purely anecdotal, but I have stopped eating mothman omelettes because of this constantly happening.
---
Each recipe should be on the wiki
---
Its so hilarious i almost dont want it fixed 😂
---
I think picking/eating mothman eggs can trigger a vengeful mothman to come after you, but it's neither guaranteed nor instant. I had one show up a good hour after I ate the eggs.
---
I'm not actually complaining about it at all, I also run it frequently. I'd just like a greater challenge with a greater chance of reward. My favorite part is when you get swarmed by ghouls. I wish the whole thing was like that.
---
Also, I wouldn't really call the two rooms at the end with a handful of gutsys half the dungeon...
---
No other big name company has made something as ambitious as Bethesda
---
Use that all the time. Ballistic bock. Corn soup is ap, wouldn't mind it doing 10% rifle.
---
I've tried this and still had it fail.  The only way these bugs will be fixed is when mods are allowed.  We can't rely on Bethesda to fix anything.
---
It happened to me as well, there were a few posts a while ago about it. I lost a few legendaries that were never going to sell, and a crapton of extra plans. It wasn't a huge loss but it is a pretty big oversight, especially for people who are Traders.
---
That's the best part about them.
---
I have seen a Deathclaw head mounted at a camp, so I guess it is in.
---
The bug is exiting the game while in the armor, when you reload into a world while wearing excavator armor you’re given an extra 100 carry weight until you die or exit the armor
---
I've gone up that side. It's still one, maybe two, steep flights of stairs between the parking lot and the vault.
---
don't know...but I do know the origin of the fucking bugle melody that chimes off every fucking 10 seconds during the tadpole exam.
---
Open your build menu, they are all there. The ones you don’t have yet will have a lock on them
---
I feel like OP was unaware of this and thought they always had the extra 100. So when they left the armor and lost it, or logged in without it on, that's the "most times" that they're referring to
---
No , you are making the game harder on yourself . Need to farm more ammo , aids and so on
---
I am aware of that I mean I want to know which ones can actually be obtained in the game
---
Any word yet if Nuclear Winter will force to play Battle Royale to unlock everything in the game?
---
O_O
---
And the wolf,owlet,wendigo also. Wolf and owlet come from unsolved quests and wendigo from a quest started by reading a paper at southern bell motel on a table near the downed robot
---
I'm assuming it was on PC, from your username. But post system so others can watch out as well.
---
You are doing the Lord's work with this post. I worked IT for Costco customers not the same but it was hell on Earth and can only imagine how things are over there. Bethesda got like 400 employees which is less then ppl at my highschool 15 years ago.
---
Gives the feeling like its not a single player game... Which is not. I hear ya but you might need a few diffrent plans for your play session.
---
If your logging in to do one very specific run or event and log off... Ya its going to seem like your always getting the shaft!
---
What clues lead you to it? I was just brought to it by other players
---
The 100 extra from complete set works fine, the +50 per calibrated leg works fine. But if you log in with a full set on you get an additonal 100 that is a bug. It stays until you exit the armor, and is gone if you reenter it. Has been around since launch, but since a lot of people are posting about this recently this little nice and useful bug is sure to be fixed any day now.
---
So no, it works fine, but we sometimes gets an extra 100 bugged to us on login that goes away when you exit the armor.
---
Gary!
---
It's just weird. I mean my Stash is a couple hundred pounds lighter, but I rather have the stuff.
---
Oh yes I forgot I do have those as well- thank you!
---
I max out vendor caps every day, mostly from drugs. Radaway, healing salve, mentats, and grape/orange mentats are easy. Flatwoods has almost all the ingredients in abundance, with a side trip to Slocum's Joe for firecaps. Lately I've been selling some serums, too, which are over 450 caps each to vendors. It's a nice way to go when you're not in the mood for a killfest.
---
I don't think I have this.. but want it
---
Did you ever figure it out? Having this problem now. Only lets me equip for my x-01 helmet
---
To be fair, at release and for months after this game was a total mess. I only came back a little over a month ago and have been blown away by what they have been doing, this is actually my go to game now. 
---
Anthem, however, is complete trash with 0 future as shown by Bioware and their corporate overlords EA.
---
I generally drop a bag of goodies at the 76 front door and let Fate run its course.
---
&gt;The game started out to be exactly to my tastes, but some executive changed the direction.
---
Can you elaborate on this? What they've done with the game is exactly what they said they were going to do and they are following their published road map that they put together before the game was even released.

I'm on PC, and the invisible/sliding ghouls are pretty hilarious at first ... until you die. When you fast travel to your Camp or someone else's Camp, its the same problem. The server takes ages to render structures or enemies, so you never know when you're going to end up in the foundations of a Camp or be mobbed by invisible ghouls.
---
Maybe they made a change (delay to rendering) to make the servers more stable when players load in to an area or its just a symptom of server lag. But they've screwed up the loading process, including losing players' inventory (luckily mine has been ok so far) and that needs to fixed asap.
---
Well said!

If he was yelling slurs, absolutely report him.

Something else that I think helped with the FO:76 vs Anthem debate was the following that comes with the Fallout name.  Yes, the game launched in a broken state and there were the controversies (overblown or not, we know they were at least a thing), but it still had the "Fallout" name branded at the top of the box.  Had it not had that, I'm wondering if we'd be seeing a different outcome at this point.
---
Report it to BGS but I'm assuming it's like my stuff, just gone forever. I think the line was "aware and looking into it". I don't put anything "good" in my vendor anymore, just in case. Sorry for your losses.
---
We need the option to have private servers

It wasn't last I looked. Not the ingredients.

I know marsupial takes crimson

Happens when people sit on top of buildings and the fence. Sooner of later they get the aggro, she tries to find pathing to them to attack. She can't, and follow the same procedure as all AI in the game: if they can't reach you to attack they instead runs away.
---
After me and my friends stopped getting on top of the fence and buildings this has never happened, not even once. Let her find a path to you and you are fine. It is not a bug, it is just the AI acting like it always do when it can't get to you.
---
That is all for now I'm pretty sure
---
I wish there was a terminal and you could select the level of difficulty.
---
How long did it take to play the imposter, real, and Arktos events combined?
---
Lots more with new Legendary vendor with people relogging and after getting some to see it be reduced in legendary effects.
---
Something something power armor screws you over when you die cause of weights. They know about it... We know about it. If you go to the webpage you can see all kinds of things that get brought up here and sometimes workarounds till a fix is released. (Like the new dungeon causeing ctd)

I truly, TRULY hate this 'NPC'.  Bethesda was clearly trying to make a Tiny Tina character with this and failed spectacularly.  Every line of dialog from her is obnoxious, and unlike holo tapes there's no way to shut it off early.  The issue is compounded by the severe lack of other quest-givers in the game.  With such a small sample size it's easy for the horrible one(s) to stand out.
---
...The voice acting is great though.
---
Danse liked that.
---
I use them the odd time just for some low damage tagging a bunch of mobs in an event, maybe if I pvped might use cryo more.
---
I don't like the poor imitations of other online grind games, Rust, PUBG, and Fortnite that are coming. They could be leading instead of following.
---
Did you get the recipe from biv I haven’t ever found a recipe only the beer
---
I lost out to the Assaultron Head weapon I bought from Purveyor losing stars on logout and received the same response. It’s disheartening, but it’s probably that they just don’t have any tools to fix a lot of these issues without developer intervention. Single player games don’t really need those sorts of tools, but devs need to make simple tools for support desk so they can help with band aid fixes and reimbursements while real fixes are implemented.
---
Which is good. If you allow vehicles to drive up to the door the door would get blocked by panicked citizens pretty darn quick. Not a single shelter here in my hometown that allows people to drive up to the doors either.
---
Lets be honest... you can litterally throw a rock from that parking lot and hit the damn door, if you can't jog that last distance you are not fit for the vault anyway.
---
yea, trying to get the Nuka paint for power armor is a great example. farmed to death.
---
You think it's bad with sugar bombs, try getting royal jelly that is usable.  Currently only 2 places you can find it per day.
---
You should look into the MAPpalachia post, there is maps for things like sugar bombs... all of which have been usable in my experience.
---
Farming bad in a "mmo" got it.
---
And 400 sounds like a massive team, right? Except when you compare it to the sales. The hardest job I worked was the release of SWTOR, where in the first weeks the ticket wait times got to 80 days. And we were 800.
---
The CS Reps are under incredible pressure, and the volume is unbelievbable. Make their life easy, your ticket is easy.

Someone else was asking last week, said they found him right away.
---
Nope. Doesn't help. You still die. Those fire traps burn through anything.
---
Kinda like you "joining people's teams" and destroying their camps? With your hundreds of mines strategically laid about, feeling like a badass because you killed a couple of guys that weren't wearing any armor?
---
You can boost it with Adrenal reaction mutation, Adrenaline perk, Nerd rage perk and a bloodied version of the gun, also if is explosive one you can add demolition expert perk.
---
 Mine is a BE pipe bolt-action with 3,3,3 rifle perks, 2,2,1 pistol perks, 3 nerd rage, 5 demo expert, 3 bloody mess, adrenal reaction mutation, with my health at 18% the gun does 1000+ dmg per shot then x2.5 from stealth perks.
---
Ooo this looks amazing thank you!
---
His sorry ass probably got smacked up in survival and thought killing you made him god tier smh
---
Yep, seeing how quickly they had to pull the support from Andromeda's single player, I just can't justify buying Anthem, as much as it saddens me as a BioWare junkie. Fallout 76, on the other hand, has grown on me and seems to keep improving steadily. Looking from the outside in, ESO gets frequent enough updates so I'm not too worried the content will dry up soon.
---
I've thought about this a few times. The one road to it is poorly placed. There's no real way to even get stuff in there. Having to climb all those stairs? I feel like there has to be a secret back entrance or something.
---
True. I guess I'm thinking about it more so in terms of Fallout 4. They barely made it to the vault from their own homes.
---
Quite a while because I actually do the quests, read the notes and terminals and I don't fast travel. I'm somewhere north of 800 hours since beta and I still haven't been to all the marked locations and certainly not all of the unmarked,  which there are as many as the marked. I didn't try to rush my playthrough I took it leisurely and actually paused long enough to absorb the story telling, both from tapes/notes and from the environmental story telling.  For a $60 investment I got a hell of a bargain for my entertainment dollar and there is more content being added constantly.  
---
I get that it's not for everyone,  but then why linger here? Move on with your gaming life and find something you do enjoy. Fallout 5 should be out in another 3 years or so...

What do you want? An award? Way to try and shove something so pointless into our faces. Let me guess . Your the friend that everyone finds annoying, right? Gtfo

How do you do the power attack on PC?

That’s your answer, the ones in the build menu

Nope. I've put every one I've gotten in my Shop and sold both Fat Boys I've gotten.

As cool as it is, I've never used a Fat Boy in any Fallout I've played.

I'm not sure how this clarifies. All I can say is that the last time I looked, the upvotes were 158 to 0 in favor of quests vs (grinding, events, challenge, and achievements).

Zero. Sorry if I broke etiquette, but that's fairly definitive.

Yeah... but 111 was fuck all of a vault, just there to experiment with cryo-tech really.

Thank you so much.

When she launched, I said to myself "Ist, I know the chances of a Suppressor's, Bash Damage,+1 Per Ultracite Pistol are low, but you have to just guild those loins and go for it."
---
Against my wildest hopes, I have received three.
---
Truly, I cannot thank you enough. Without you, I'd have gotten shit like bloodied explosive handmades or bloodied vats vats combat rifles. *spit*

THank you for soaking up all that shit. I &lt;3 you.
---
Ya I've sat and observed countless ppl spawn at multiple locations, same result nearly every time.
---
This has just happened to me too. I make the drinks. I out the drinks in the fermenter. They each have a condition bar that slowly goes down and then they disappear?
---
deal with it
---
Ok, I respect that
---
It was at the top left. Xbox
---
Forget even Fallout 5, there are way too many people that only want a Fallout New Vegas 2 because bethesda=bad and they'll loudly shit on anything that isn't that. They also tend to think Skyrim sucks, Morrowind was the pinnacle of gaming, and Outer Worlds is already a masterpiece.
---
Actually PS4. I play with an army buddy that only has a console, so that's what we play this on.
---
I'm discouraged by the fact that constructive criticism seems to be largely met with "move on" rather than discussion.
---
You can actually see far more than are actually obtainable in game - such as the scorchbeast Queen etc :)
---
I have no idea how it got turned off. I turned it back on now lol.
---
It was biv. I don't think it's a recipe, you learn it randomly doing the daily.
---
Oh, I did.
---
You did it the best way
---
Mirvs are great for tagging everything in a whole area too. So are the bug poison grenades.
---
Ya you spawn at your camp usually near edge of buildable area somewhere. OTHER players spawn near if not in center camp.
---
You shot gim back. You deserved it.
---
Its more fun when you can talk to ppl than you talking and they just emote you, but some ppl don't wanna talk and I don't blame them its their choice

I get so much fertilizer from regular looting that i dont need the spoiled food, so i just drop it.  I also dont craft many explosives, so ive got a surplus of fertilizer.  And ive got a brahmin, so i have fertilizer from that too
---
My friends and I went to the Nuka cola factory and we're shocked that all three of us could pick up several of the nuka colas. So once I picked it up it disappeared but they could still see it until they picked it up. If the servers weren't complete shit for a 2019 game they could implement stuff like this. How about an option for a private server that refreshes every 24 hours?
---
Possibly. 
---
But as a parent, I find it odd how some folks let their obviously very young kids play MA games. At least wait until they are 15+. This boy sounded pre teen.
---
They definitely changed something. I got instantly dropped by a level 21 legendary mole rate a few days ago. It's happened several times with multiple creatures with enemy level and my armor not making any difference.
---
3hours, I was never waiting, i don't want to die at that horrific event

Ye, I havn't tested EVERY type of location, so there may be exceptions. But I have tested a quite a few varied types of locations, often in awkward building zones, and it's rung true each time for me.

Ya, not sure, probably ppl who misunderstand and don't bother to read whole post or test themselves.

If fixing melee was a $25 dollar dlc, then I'd buy it

Huh, I guess I confused the animation trying to catch up with it working for bulk then
---
B4040 sounds like a workout program
---
Yeah, that's a good effect. Most people aren't gonna pay for ghoul slayer stuff though or if they do it won't be much. The enemy specific damage reductions aren't very popular overall. I'm not saying it's worthless, just temper your expectations. Personally, I'd probably turn it in for scrip because I'd rather have another roll at something better and I don't have inventory space to spare.
---
Effects to keep an eye out for are Unyielding, Chameleon, Bolstering, Vanguard, and Weightless. AP refresh, + strength, +perception, and +agility are probably the best secondary effects. Any of the weight reduction ones are great third effects but weapon weight is definitely the most sought after. Sentinel, cavalier, fall damage, and harder to detect are also very good.
---
Best to scrip it before it drops in value
---
I suggest going to play Dying Light. Fallout has never been a "run and slide into cover" game, and never will be. It was almost too much of a leap going from ISO to FP. Now you want a full on non stop action game?
---
Who says I don't think I'm better than everyone?
---
Grumbilda, she just wants to be loved.
---
I’ve seen them. They spawn in the center, they spawn in periphery, they spawn in my generator room (unlocked). It’s a crap shoot.

this is how i kill super high level assholes. hit em with the ol RADs and watch them cry
---
If your dumb enough 2 take a workshop, you should be killed for it

Lol, for reference, it's a Bloodied + 40% power attack damage + 40%less damage taken while power attacking Deathclaw Gauntlet. So yes, I'm sure I'll get a workout using this thing.

Great things about RPGs is, that you need to search for informations on internet, to be able to do something. Knowleage is biggest part of skill in this type of games.
---
Yeah thats a static spawn but i thought the wise Mothman is unkillable since it's about the wings
---
I'll relay my findings since you seem at least to be paying attention :P
---
Visitors = center, no issues.  Always see them there.
---
Me...it varies, one of 2 spots, no variations other than that.  North edge of the circle occasionally when I fast travel back to camp.  Not always, but sometimes.  Other times, I'm closer to the center, but to the west.  Always there when I log in, sometimes there when I fast travel, but sometimes the other place.  I Have yet to figure out what the reasoning is behind which one I'll end up at.
---
They're very noticeably different locations.  North is on the top of a hill, west is down in a narrow canyon.  The only thing that I can think *might* be related is I *think* I always end up west when there's someone else at my camp, but I haven't toyed with the idea enough to tell for sure.
---
A missile launcher with a targeting computer is lovely to help finish off a scorchbeast that won't settle its ass down and land.  
---
I love using explosive weapons in this game and regularly buy/craft the ammo.
---
Can you pick that one up if the toads don't set it off?
---
Yeah, but who would just wear leather armor?  They want the outwear to cover up the Combat Armor or Scout Armor.
---
you inferred all that and brought toxic negativity into this discussion based on THIS: **",.... it’s not"**

what the hell is wrong with you?

As far as I know you don't show up on the map, bit I've still been hunted down before which is annoying since most of the time people just quit out and I become 3rd by pure chance.

that is a very good point! PC, sorry about the confusion XD

(also, sorry, sorry! i posted the thing and went out to do a couple errands, i wasn't expecting folk to be so johnny on the spot!)
---
Asked the dude where he got it, but he bought it of a vendor, so he had no idea where to get this.
---
Here's an updated version. I think the Mothman can appear at the green dots, and maybe the red ones too.
---
Thanks but I'm on ps4 :(
---
I've got the unstoppable monster myself, I just find it odd how we've resorted to naming legendaries. I always liked using the prefixes from f4 (for example, two shot rapid weightless) instead of a bunch of letters and numbers thrown together
---
They are mammals after all...
---
They have been there since the game launched.
---
Which is dumb. Because if you don't help the event all the creatures will die in the first wave and the Alpha doesn't show up.
---
Well, I was in the top three, and the two other players were REALLY high level (my character was 11). I crouched and cleared the entire capitol building in Charleston using a silenced rifle. Never stood up once. Didn't catch a whiff of either player, and they weren't that far away. It just seemed like if I was glowing like a beacon, somebody would have come after me. The only ones who tried were a pair of lower level friends who happened to cross paths with me outside the building afterwards.
---
No, that link directs you to the Fallout Wiki page for mutations, which does not have the specific ingredients for each serum.
---
You can, however, follow the links on the above wiki page, which will direct you to each serums specific wiki page, which does have the ingredients...

I know. You just don't see/hear yourself. It's frustrating man. Trying to help but you are very stubborn.
---
You're welcome.

I really wish we had a dungeon or 5 along the same vein as ESO.

Yup, happens when you start a new character since they by default starts with pvp-protection until lvl 5 and pacifist off.

G2a is website to buy it from
---
They are hidden in some dungeon, on trees, and near the edge of a cliff. Once they stand up to run, they'll appear on the map.
---
Uranium Fever is a good option if the event is running. Kill all the mole miners, collect all their weapons, glowing meat, and junk items they have. Cook glowing meat, scrap all junk, then sell weapons, glowing meat steak, and black titanium. You should easily hit the daily limit.
---
Someone hasnt gotten their backpack yet.

The deathclaw head is only dev room it’s not out yet
---
i think it would an ok idea simply for the fact its about impossible to tell if it is is night or day as the nights are just as bright as the daytime, only way to tell is its a clear night and you can see the stars (or whip out for pipboy of course)
---
Here's a tip pay attention
---
I love to kill people over and over in attempt to recovery their paper bag filled with soiled foods.
---
Such a trash argument, if I buy a brand new car for transportation but due to a defect in the air conditioner it breaks in the first week I'm not entitled to go back and make them fix it since Im using it to move around?
---
They should just make Survival or even a new mode with a harder "difficulty". Easy to implement and adds so much to the game.
---
You do you, but I think it's fucking insane that people are taking a chance on multistar armor while that bug persists. At least on the weapon side of things there's like 60 different options, so the odds of getting a bugged assaultron head are pretty slim, but the odds of getting a piece of wood armor are what, 1 in 7?
---
Rngesus does not approve of the purveyor. The purveyor is a false idol , sent to deceive the faithful and weaken our resolve. Rngesus demands sacrifice. Once daily I make a run through the whitespring and hurl nuka grenades, never stopping to check a body. After this holy ritual is performed you must server hop and begin farming . All the bad loot is then collected and dumped in the tainted waters of the toxic valley . Do not be tempted with the currency of lootcifer, for you will be led astray. Only through sacrifice is Rngesus appeased, only the faithful shall reap rewards.
---
&gt;I'm discouraged by the fact that constructive criticism seems to be largely met with "move on" rather than discussion
---
I'm just not understanding that..  I wrote a couple of replies to you, rather lengthy ones, to which you responded with one liners of "FO76 is just copying RUST and PubG". 
---
For there to be a discussion both parties have to be engaged you do not appear to want to be engaged. Hence why I and others have said perhaps you should move on if that is your final point on the discussion.  
---
If, on the other hand, you'd like to go back and reread what I and others have said to you and respond civilly we can perhaps advance this discussion
---
Ya that all sounds like what I've observed at my camp, other than location. I usually spawn on a cliff edge north of camp, occasionally I'll be actually in my house. Visitors always spawn next to a square rock in middle of my camp where I first dropped my camp.
---
It's for trading purposes. When you're scanning trade listings on certain subreddits, it's much easier to recognize "oh, that guy is trading a B25 Handmade" than reading "Bloodied 25% Faster Fire Rate", and when you have a ton to trade, you end up with trade posts that are like "H: B25 HMR, BSS40 DCG, B50 HMR W: BE Gat Plas" etc. Those are much easier to read for traders, and you couldn't even list all of that out in a single title.
---
So you care to let people know you don't care about, seems like someones just trolling around attacking people who want what they paid for.
---
I dont see it as ballistic weapons good overall ecspecially since energy weapons are are straight downgrade currently this would balance out the weapons if you look at it, buffing energy weaponry and nerfing melee against certain opponents, right now melee weapons are better in every scaenario except SBQ in terms of damage
---
That I recall, I did not tweak the placement of my camp device.
---
The consistent spawn-in point for me is the corner of the first foundation piece I placed, which is on the edge of the camp "circle"...  
---
  My elevated building is centered above the camp device. 
---
I needed a foundation piece to place the stairs up to the 1st floor.   
---
Because of the height and line of sight angles involved, I do not see visitors when the spawn in, but I do sometimes hear them.   
---
  I run a full surround system on my console; based on the direction of the sound effects, they spawn in in the same location I do - corner of the first foundation piece.
---
Nah Im with you. At first i didnt understand the stupid checklist scout badges, but if you actually try and stick to whatever you want to do or unlock, chances are you will find another adventure along the way. As a pure quester, I can only hope you know what I'm talking about. Alot of unexpected things tend to happen in 76 when you're on a set path and destined not to be distracted. At least from what I've encountered since beta.
---
Thanks for the added details, I'll make sure this is taken into account as we continue to look into this.
---
Ive gotten 2 in those small green footlockers. Found one in the garage outside Grafton Dam, don't remember where I found the other
---
Might be the location your in, can't say I've tested EVERY location and location type, but I've tested several, and what I described happened every time.
---
That's a "You" problem, man. 100%.
---
Not Bethesda's fault.
---
Poop bombs!
---
LMAO... um ok dewd, not sure how you came to that conclusion, but more power to you
---
It is base game. I found it in the beta.
---
Xbox GT is Kasv0tVaxt, same as my reddit name. I've actually lowered pricing in the last week or so as the market has become flooded with plans. All recipes are 10, and most other things are priced at 20-25% of the list price.
---
I surely enjoy quest with an actual story over the endless grind although I do enjoy being able to jump in and do 5-6 events with my girl during the week each night. I believe we should have both and much more. The story is there its just not tied to the quest very good(Grab this, go here repeat.) I enjoy the lore that is in the terminals and the holo tapes but after working a 10 hr day I really don't feel like reading everything I encounter nor do I have the time.
---
Maybe just don't play the game then?
---
How is that Bethesdas fault?
---
Super Mutants not only drop caps, they drop materials/weapons and ammo (5.56/Shotgun) which sell for 1-2 caps each very easily to other players. The other option that's decent are Nuke Zones with Harvest Perks. Can easily harvest hundreds of Flora that sell for 2 caps at npc vendors, stable flux sells very fast to players, and that's on top of the normal drops like meat that can get you hundreds/thousands of caps every day.
---
Rudeness begets rudeness. My original point to which you so rudely responded still stands. Games are escapism, and shouldn't present immersive, life-quality struggles.
---
They don't change anything like that except in the major patches. I didn't die for days anyway, except once when I was tanking two pylons and the imposter backstabbed me.
---
If you run around in PA all the time, you may want to take it off, relog and put it back on. Lots of bugs like that, and as the PA damage reduction is invisible, it's hard to tell when it's working.
---
I can't even sell them for a cap. I just drop them. Throughly unbalanced weapons those.
---
Right just like how ghouls will say fuck that and sprint away after you’re on top of a car or something
---
Sure thing ;) PSN is Chobowan
---
you're going to defend the interface?  
---
AFTER you select an item, while you're setting prices your mouse can hover downwards and you will set the price on an item separate from the one you chose. 
---
That's a crappy interface dude.
---
You’re being pedantic. The link I shared, like you said yourself, takes you to all the recipe links. 
---
🙄
---
 The TS AGL puts the 2 'nades a long way apart, its almost like rain. 
---
The one shot goes about where you would think and the other usually drops about 20% short, so I shoot over their heads for good results. ;)
---
&lt;/3 no sympathy from the community I guess lol
---
Preview of the Cricketsquatch quest line.
---
Before Calvin van Lowe modified the assaultron into the imposter Sheepsquatch, he practiced by combining a Liberator and a Cave Cricket. 
---
Early bonus for you!
---
maybe it spawns another queen?
---
Well, that was an over reaction if i ever did see one but ok
---
Shame but unlikely to be fixed since they are considered different items entirely and we don't have multiple recipes for same thing.
---
I love to use grenades whenever I've got some. Mines, not so much.
---
Pay attention. You know its not perfect, but blaiming it for ur misclick?
---
Defiance can get you hundreds in minutes...
---
I made two posits, alli the other stuff vs quests, and quests vs the other stuff. Lots of discussion, but the net upvotes for grinding, achievements, events and challenges amounted to zero. The upvote count for quests vs the other stuff was 158 to 0.
---
if its anything like in fallout 4 it triggers as soon as its powered so you need to connect it to a pressuerplate or something to make it work 👍🏼
---
A sassy one i see
---
Niiice
---
No, it's actually very hard to do that.  The mothers usually round them up and chase you off.
---
While you're at it, you may want to fix Endangerol, as it currently buffs the armor penetration of the target rather than reducing its damage resistance. Amusing, and borderline exploitable, but a bit of a trap for players who don't read forums.
---
Any chance you had a server crash while transferring stuff? I know when I was transferring stuff I crashed and lost the items that I moved in the last 3 mins.
---
do you play PC with mouse? 
---
Judging by the amount of "your fault" immediate responses I think this may be specific to PC.
---
it's not a misclick, the click was on the proper item. mouse hover allows the item to change while you're setting prices.
---
I found one but accidentally scrapped it I think caus I can find them in boxes and stuff does that mean I have to find it off the tourists again
---
Well said. It is good to have both, and to be able to jump in and play in and out of story and lore.
---
It spaws a certain distance based on the current position of the module.
---
I think one of the quicker ways is to go to Blackwater mine and loot all the weapons from the mole men. It's a short walk back to Whitespring Station.  It's not as productive as West Tek but you don't have to walk nearly as far.
---
Mothman
---
His point was that you don't have to hit the same spots everyone else does. Find your own places that aren't farmed to death.  You want plastic? Equip Scrapper and go to places that are likely to have high level super mutants carrying laser rifles. General's Steak House, Crevasse Dam, and Pylon V-13 are 3 (of many) excellent locations that most people never visit.
---
I dont play PC but i know the system. You gotta look before u click
---
Also one must think that not everyone can understand or speak English, maybe they can understand it read or even written (the bad ones with google translate like I'm doing right now myself: P
---
I remember a case of one who by his accent and names might be Russian ... and they wanted to kindly ask me to create the bed that I had in my camp in his camp. Even then he had some difficulties because he wanted to thank me for paying him. First I try to speak to myself in my native language (he asked me before), then he spoke to me in English because I could do it in a better way. Even so, it cost you.
---
If I understand slightly I will answer with gestures or actions (some salesman has kindly requested that I do not have the weapons in his shop for example), but my English is not fluent enough to speak, much less when there are advanced concepts, roles , Accents or I'm waiting for purchases, notices, etc.
---
Summary: there are people who do not speak by microphone because they do not want, others do not have, can not speak because children sleep ... or simply, it is very difficult to understand and then answer properly and prefer to be limited to signs.
---
I would LOVE something as simple as being able to put a second icon with language flags, not of country, but of languages ​​... as I read the Australians and Japanese who share a server, imagine :/
---
I only scrap obvious junk that I don’t give two craps about, personally. That way I don’t feel so bad about it. Got get rid of all the weight. Can’t hold onto it all hoping they’ll fix it anytime soon.
---
I’m guessing you’re a child too. This wasn’t put on here to bitch about being killed, it’s about racism and the *child* speaking the way he was.
---
 I killed one in the Free Range thing. I had no idea what was going on.
---
  Anyway I don't use VATS and just pumped 'nades into his face till he died. About 14, just after the reload. There were 2 others but they were not in the way at all and were happily firing away too. ;)
---
Wait for Cowboy perk. Stack Pistol perks with it.
---
they always run away. probably doesn't help that im covered in bones and blood
---
You make the same mistake most pollers do which is to assume that whatever the topic is, the answer has to be mutually exclusive,  they almost never are. 
---
Secondly,  I never read your other post, only this one, so the whole poll becomes invalid. Not to mention that as you replied on messages , at least in this post, you polluted the results this making them invalid
---
the bridge by the moth man town
---
Normally, “block for session” will keep a player from seeing your location. How does that work with survival mode?
---
Yeah but she should be resetting after a period of time.
---
Disk? Which XBO model do you own? Did you game share?
---
Your not alone friend. Lets pop this thread higher and get Bethesda to notice.
---
I prefer Quests with actual consequence and story over anything else but i do also like the other stuff as they make for great supplemental things to do in between large quest chains.
---
Ah, you're right forgot about that. I still don't think there's any roads to Virginia though, which is strange but I could be wrong.
---
XB1, lvl 68: Honestly, I prefer events.  I have a ton of incomplete quests, but I totally prefer exploring new areas and finding cool stuff.  Fortunately, the quests will still be there whenever I decide to to them.
---
I added him. And when I get off work I’ll join him if he’s still on, and then proceed to report him as well. There is no room in this world for a racist or anyone degrading sexual preferences or orientation. I don’t play that shit it sets me off real quick fast
---
I had to bulk and sell some after clearing Defiance, lol.
---
Stuff like [https://www.reddit.com/r/FO76roleplay/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FO76roleplay/) has kept me interested. 
---
Regardless of whether you should have to design your own game, interacting with other players in ways beyond all standing around shooting at the scorchbeast queen is interesting. And some of these interactions can even be more interesting than any quest I expect to be launched in the future.
---
I'm not suggesting holding on to stuff, merely using your scrip on weapons until they fix the armor bug or remove that shit from the loot pool. If I have a choice between getting screwed 1/60 of the time or 1/7 of the time, I'm going with 1/60.
---
Is there somewhere to buy the 3rd Mole Miner claw or do I just need to farm them and keep scrapping them?
---
And after, apparently.  Click on item, adjust the price, check back to make sure what you clicked is still highlighted.
---
It's the only place I've seen this particular problem, and it is definitely an issue (albeit a pretty small one IF you're looking for it)
---
Yeah, it's a PC thing. It's incredibly annoying and should be fixed, but I'd still be surprised if anyone made more than the occasional mis-sell once they're used to the game.
---
I dashboard maybe around once every 10 hours of playtime. The most recent technical issue I experienced is a constant never ending audio loop during/after a large SBQ fight.
---
I have a barbed oak baseball bat
---
I don’t let my son play certain games either. Yeah that’s terrible parenting, and I’m guessing these *parents* don’t care that there kid is going to grow up a racist homophobe.
---
Again... What does Fallout have to do with anything LGBT related? As far as I know it's about a group of people trying to survive in a nuclear wasteland after a war almost wiped humanity out...
---
nice. didn't think about the possibility that a pipe gun could be usable. Could the alien blaster be built like that?
---
Your not alone, another redditor had same issue earlier but might be related to tax system but with all these current bugs that got added like melee not being able to use vats on flying enemies I don't see it being fixed soon.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bwi0ld/vending\_machines\_issue\_with\_selling\_ammo\_at\_1\_cap/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bwi0ld/vending_machines_issue_with_selling_ammo_at_1_cap/)
---
What are you talking about?
---
Don't mind ghoul attacks, but the whole map with the ghouls is a bit samey. Be nice if it was split into 3 or 4 distinct spaces. With differing enemies. They have enough ghoul like npc's. Needs a boss as well at the end. Can even be 1 star.
---
I do find amusement in building large settlement-type structures that are specific to workshops and then blueprinting them cuz lower level players who stumble upon them often seem to really like them. Although some people have amazingly impressive personal camps, I don't come across many workshops that already have interesting &amp; complex structures built by someone else.
---
that's not how it works lol
---
unless there's an actual bug with the engine, otherwise it's abstracted a whole lot
---
If you're going to make an argument it will help if you do it by stating coherent facts.
---
Someone is bound to need some.
---
We’re supposed to repopulate this land so I guess it’s sorta fitting
---
Xbox
---
Especially for someone who sounds 9-10 years old. This is pure garbage parenting.
---
&gt; A little randomization
---
ah yes, the radiant quests we all love
---
I have the same rifle, but only 30% in pistols and 2 ranks of demo.  At 18% health and no adrenaline I'm sure I've seen the damage up around 500, but never 1000.  Wow.
---
To the OPs question, I don't have full rank of gunslinger so I can't look at the screen and say.  But just to guess I would put the pipe revolver over 120, maybe 130.  I love the pipe revolver, so don't get me wrong, but take those points out of gunslinger and put them into stealth for 2.5x sneak damage and adrenaline.  Unless you have another pistol that is benefiting from those points.
---
I don't think this is even intentional, as it uses the armor scrap probabilities rather than the weapon ones. Standard problem though: Bethesda don't have a bug reporting system, so until someone manages to get a post out there with a few hundred upvotes, it won't get fixed.
---
I wasn't making an argument I was stating a fact.
---
You misspelled 'bugged'.
---
It's not supposed to benefit from 2 different weapon classifications.  I wouldn't be too surprised if they fixed it at some point.
---
*turns it into fertilizer, bulks it, and then sells it to the vendor bots. Walks home with pockets full of caps*
---
All in fun, have a nice day
---
That's how it works in the wasteland. Explosive shit.
---
We can only hope mate, I haven't seen anything mentioned with the new combat update hopefully I'm wrong
---
Nope have the old 500 and the new x and it keeps occurring on the new model. Happens alot on event quests like SBQ and other events that bog down server think it's a Bethesda issue...
---
Never got a Alien blaster to test...
---
Oh how I wish you were on xbox man. My buddy and I have been trying to teach players like this how to be better. If this was on xbox, we'd go in and nuke his base for you, but alas we cannot. I hope you don't run into this again, it makes the game unenjoyable. Best of luck, Vault Dweller!
---
But don't you see any tie-in between the challenges and the quests? Cuz I have, and I haven't been attempting to pay attention. 
---
Many of the challenges direct players to areas which have side quests which they might've missed, or events they might've missed because they aren't popular ones and/or are limited to specific times of day or situations. Or to unique locations which aren't marked with a location marker but are interesting all the same.
---
Yeah i dont mean anything by it, but thats how i see people like my mum type, just thought it was funny
---
Sometimes you gotta get up high and be patient in taking down enemies that are too tough for ya. This is how I killed my first lvl 32 wendigo at lvl like...20 lol. I got up in a tree and shot at it till it died.
---
That damage of mine is without Adrenaline too, not enought perk slots to use it...
---
That's the way of life nowadays. Everything has value somehow and someway.
---
No before I would just display that a bottle cap mine was present not sure if it's still an active spawn heard back in January they fixed it..
---
Yeah ever since that patch that rebalanced surgical trays/cans Defiance is beyond god tier for crafting supplies, caps and general farming.
---
Honestly not sure.
---
Though things stay for quite awhile after the orginal maker leaves. It's even better if they have some generators up
---
Just power thru bud. Always feel hard at the start but there’s no real penalty in dying. Just come back again and again till the deeds done and collect loot and move on.  It will get easier as u level up dude.
---
If anything throw a post out to find friends to grind with around your same level to help
---
r/PKOA
---
Absolutely! If I EVER heard my son speaking that way on his fornite game ...man I don’t know what I’d do but you can believe me when I say as long as he is under my roof he will NEVER play a online game again. Now I have walked by his room and heard him cuss before, just trying to sound cool in front of his online friends I suppose and I’ll lean my head in and look at him and he instantly mutes his mic and starts apologizing. He’s smart though because he doesn’t curse in public, or infront of anyone because he knows a bar of soap will go right in that mouth.
---
If the plant is 100% you are even luckier because the power box will energize the whole camp

https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3138fb&amp;d=ir2l71eu0a72s92ss2sg2se2aj2ar2ao0la2sf2cu1cm0i44lt2lu2am2a11p52&amp;w=&amp;n=Bloodied%20Unyielding%20DCG&amp;m=3cf28bhge9.  Similar to what my unarmed guys build is but slightly modified as you don’t need Adrenaline.  Glow sights is sorta worthless because you will one shot any current glowing mob, unless the arkos pharma bosses are glowing I don’t remember.  Let me know if you have any questions on anything. I am similar to you in that I main a heavy gunner Bloody Version and play around with an unyielding unarmed guy.
---
I didn't know it existed until a customer dropped it off. Glad I negotiated with them when they tried to take a workshop from me. It was the junk yard above Poseidon power plant. They wanted aluminum and I gave it to them. My old camp was down in the ravine.
---
Thanks.
---
I just checked the wiki, I don't believe it was specified where. It 
---
launched the nukes it was supposed to, then got damaged near Boston.
---
Two shot explosives made mobs unkillable??
---
It was , I’ve a very dry humor
---
I used a hammer early on.  Yes, I died but it also had more damage than a gun.....
---
The Alien Blaster will only benefit from pistol perks, as it has no stock mod that adds the WeaponTypeRifle perk.
---
The only weapons I've found that double-stack in the current patch are the Pipe Revolver Rifle and Pipe Bolt Action Rifle. I may have missed something though.
---
That’s not how this works.  That’s not how any of this works!
---
Those are the floating gimp factories I referenced. No thanks
---
Ya everything's powerd and running. Locks all over this house. I just sat and let the defenses wipe out any attacks... But my box is getting full amd i got to go.
---
Yes, for a long while the mobs would get down to zero health than regen
---
I play SP games with several hundreds of mods rather often, but here I won't touch any until there's official modding support.
---
I don’t remember this at all I’ve had tse weapons since Late November
---
Glad I'm not the only one trying to use terrain to my advantage, I ended up fighting a bunch of lvl 30 and higher when I drank some nuka shine. The o KY way I survived one fight was getting a glowing one stuck where it basically wouldn't come down the stairs to fight me!
---
Damage resistance, damage dealt. Everything seems a bit off to me. Vats crits also seem to not work properly half of the time. Whatever.
---
I wouldn't bar of soap, because I had that done to me when I was a kid lol. 
---
But a very long grounding would be in order, with no console, computer, tv, or phone. 
---
A PS4 is not a babysitter, and any parent that thinks otherwise should not be one.
---
Much better than the ninnies running socialist campaigns.
---
Same, the best comedy is when its delivered eith a dead serious expression
---
True but I have about 200 hours in and still havnt finished my quests.
---
My thoughts, as well. Both games had bad launches, and both games got crapped on for it. I think Anthem did get a little less backlash immediately after launch due to the fact that the game is pretty enjoyable until you finish the campaign and start the end game so it took some people longer to see the flaws.
---
When I’m down for pvp I like to go on the hunt, but I only go after higher level ppl to be fair. If I see a mark low level I’ll let em be unless they want to engage me.
---
Not being able to use VATS on bloodbugs has made my life considerably worse.
---
You were teamed, and your friend was still in the workshop area?
---
I've done that to, helping low level players by crafting them weapons.  Actually it was alot of fun.  They helped by furnishing me with their crafting items and I furnished them with weapons all tricked out for the level they were at.
---
It had an extremely bad and broken start which ofcourse became better over time but some people don't forgive it and don't want to retry it so they still hating for something that doesn't even exist
---
That is awesome!
---
Thanks, I did suspect it was just part of the grind but just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something blatantly obvious.
---
Ah thanks I was sooo confused
---
It only affects the spawn point of the non owners who arrive.
---
YES! Tired of Melee having all the fun!
---
I stupidly got rid of some decent melee weapons, I'll try and keep a look out for something!
---
One of my characters is meant to be "average dude" in the wasteland. He's still low level... only mid 20s, but it's working quite well. Just can't take a "Leroy Jenkins" approach to the game, is all.
---
Also keep this in mind...there's no shame in dying in this game lol and you really have nothing to lose if you don't carry all your junk on you all the time. So who cares if you get killed? Sure it's a punch to the ego but other than that it's no biggy. Just stash all your junk away when you get it. But you'll get there man. Keep your chin up!
---
I mean .. that's what I hear.
---
I think it how the mechanic of the game is setup to guide/force ppl to join into teams.  If solo work towards a stealth rifle headshot build to start.
---
Are you kidding? You must either A. Use power armor all the time already. Or B. Didnt build the lvl50 pack with +60 carry weight and kept the lvl10 one.
---
My dude sits around a 345 limit at half health with more damage resistance than my Excavator.. And I could cut the carry weight in half to tack on even MORE damage resistance? Yes please. Sorry about your boring backpack experience, Neuro.
---
I mean, I guess a backpack is kinda boring... But being able to actually carry shit without excavator or wasteful weight saving perks was well work taking pictures, reading the Exam answers off of a Google doc, and doing the Pioneer Dailies! 
---
Would it appeal to you more if we called it a shit-holder?
---
40 scrip all day
---
Ya they do great damage.  You can even get lucky and get one with low weight.  Mine was a super sledge which weighed 1 pound and does 700 damage @ it's max! I use it for the personal touch. When I'm surrounded by ghouls that want to go hands on with me!
---
That's a very good point - there's no way any regular glowing enemy would need glowsight to kill.
---
Barbarian is an excellent perk I hadn't thought of. How effective do you find the extra armor from perks to be for regular play? Also, have you taken your unarmed guy out to do SBQ? Curious if you've tried to use stealth on her and if you've found it to be worthwhile. I have a Uny Bloodied auto rifle build as well, and even he has a hard time staying in stealth from a distance on SBQ.
---
IMO they should make late game enemies do way more damage to player but not be bullet sponges themselves. Makes for more exciting and intense gameplay.
---
you could kill a SB with two hits using a bloodied handmade, js.
---
Or laser trip wire
---
Or you could just mind your own fuckhole!
---
Faux outrage? From what I saw, everyone I played with quit immediately after they were announced and didn't bother making several reddit threads for a lost cause... Personally, I would never buy a full priced game with micro transactions for non-cosmetic items. Bethesda made my favorite games and I enjoyed FO76 as well if I can ignore the fact that 90% of the game is tedium purposely implemented to extend play time. To even log in to FO76 again would be implying I accept their business practices and at this point I will not even buy the next Elder Scrolls if I can't trust the company. I never thought I could ever say I would skip an Elder Scrolls but at this point I wouldn't put it past them to ban modding in favor of their micro transaction shops.
---
You shouldn't be crafting guns: you should be scavenging ones at your level. I'm level 205ish and I don't believe I ever crafted a gun to use. I've crafted tons of guns to scrap for mods, and I've modded lots and lots, but I've crafted nary a one just to use. It's silly. Enemies you face and can defeat drop the weapons you should be using at your level. Pick up all of them. Use the one with the best condition bar, scrap the rest to learn the mods to make it better. Make it better. Repeat.
---
Also, the Forest and the Toxic Valley (North--Northwest) are relatively safe areas for lower levels because they are level locked. Try the events and workshops in these areas.
---
No singlerplayer planned and the game stutters a lot. I don't know if this is because of dupers or a game issue.
---
Do you like stalkers faster fire rate with bashing damage!?  You're in luck...we got just the thing.  (Google translated from murmmmgh)
---
Well they did, you might be able to look it up and find footage
---
&gt; It doesn't seem like he have to find the right words
---
he's a fucking robot, either it developed sapience and emotions to be an asshole and mess with us, or it is running on the same CPU as my potato
---
I've received several rifles and thought, "someone would love this, but not me."  Those I've put into my vendor, on the chance that one of the 20 people on this server wants it.  And there they sit, wasting space.  Can only think of one rifle that sold...a nocturnal explosive assault rifle. 
---
It doesn't cost anything to roll the dice so I'll keep at it.  But the gamble isn't what keeps me in the game.
---
This or... imagine being able to play Blast Radius or one of the other ingame board games with others!!
---
Radicool too! And some whiskey and the perks to double its effects.
---
Step 1. Collect underpants
---
Step 2. ???
---
Step 3. Profit!

"Why do people dislike Communism when Nazism was so much worse" Just because one thing was "worse" then another doesn't mean its good or even acceptable. If I shit on your floor is it okay because it wasn't on your bed? No.

Ok, is there any info for when fallout 76 comes to steam?

If you are top three you are on the map. Period. I am usually near the top and I sneak constantly and people are always coming for me.
---
The only time it's different is interiors. Then your icon is near the entrance to the interior. This is useful for baiting people into the burrows or west Tek. Then killing them when they are hunting you.
---
I have seen markers not show many times and I believe it is a bug. I have a few hundred hours of survival and my team mate and I are obsessed with details like that.
---
Yep I got that impression when I took some advice to get a backpack only to be stumped as soon as I saw the part that said to revive an ally.
---
You don’t have the poop perk card? Shame.
---
I just eat it. Combined with inert Flux, it's one of the most efficient food sources.

Hahahaha true, I preferred Muggy. I think it was the permanent existential crisis that I could relate to

Raider Inc.

*now under new supervision*
---
I remember seeing a post a couple months back saying it was coming this year. But that's all I know
---
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind. I assumed that crafting would probably be the way forward and have been scrapping more guns now for mods.
---
You say you liked dropping whatever you were  doing to defend a settlement? That's what workshops ARE. Build it up, someone might come along and challenge for it, so you get to defend it. It wasn't right before that you could just surround the workshop bench with stash boxes so no one could challenge for it.
---
I used to HATE when people came up to try and attack my CAMP. Now, since they covered the whole game in foam and bubblewrap, I actually miss defending my CAMP from people trying to destroy it. That aspect is actually worse than the old system. Yeah, it could get expensive rebuilding, but now there's almost no challenge in the game. 
---
Don't tell me to go to survival either. The servers there are in awful shape, and people can just build boxes and hide in them, surrounding themselves with turrets. You can't hurt their camp unless you get a shot in on them.
---
Yep. Blueprint the vendors and it saves the inventory.
---
imo physical game boxes are just a complete waste of resources, and then they're obsolete anyway, haven't had a PC with a CD-drive for a nearly a decade
---
Keeping scrapping, but keep one.
---
Watch out for the walkin' dude!
---
They can't replace anything. You can report a bug but that's all.
---
I don't care how many down votes I get. It just creeps me out seeing all these players in skimpy little dresses knowing that it's a straight guy in reality. 
---
Secondly, good luck. Since NV the character building has been watered down. Literally only speech checks now. You don't have to make sacrifices anymore you can just be good at everything 
---
If you're Role Playing have at it. But you'll be imagining all of this stuff. Luck outside of the perk cards doesn't really affect game play.
---
I do but I mostly hate it. It doesn't really do anything for me other than get in the way of inventory management. I never respond to anyone's trade offers, I've never had anyone respond to mine, and I never join events people say they're starting. When two people get into a conversation it just spams your screen with the text box. And I'm pretty sure it defaults to global chat so you have to change it to local every time you start the game if you want to use it for that.
---
I couldn't tell you why I haven't deleted it yet. 
---
Better Inventory and Perk Loadout Manager are about a billion times better.
---
I feel your pain.

Honestly,  couldn't you have been a handmade or even a combat rifle?  Even an assault rifle would've been a better roll.
---
I have also enjoyed some time in FO76, but I am glad that Beth has been receiving such fierce criticism because they can and should do better with their launches.
---
Devs/publishers really just need to stop making it so easy to create click-bate videos/articles. They should know better and stop trying to get away with so much BS. Plenty of games get released and receive high praise because they feel at least mostly finished at launch, and even better when they show some respect (even faked) for their players/customers (which mostly goes back to not launching unfinished buggy games).
---
I wish I had 15k caps so I could do this
---
Play survival?

The most difficult part of fighting the SBQ as a bloody unyielding melee is radiation management.  She puts off a lot of radiation, you’d never notice in PA.  There’s no comparison to bloody in and out of PA.  You are much, much, much squishier out of PA even with serendipity.  Extra DR/ER is nice, that’s why in that build I even tossed on scaly skin at the cost of only -12 AP.  You should have 400 AP so no real loss, also why Dodgy is there.  I promise you will only ever PA on the SBQ, Alpha bosses, sheep squatch and imposter.  Everything else including mire queens and SB are one shot with a normal attack, AP becomes an incredible defensive stat.  Also use the rad resist backpack, it helps.  The name of the game is radiation management outside of PA, one glowing ghoul boy hit is 40ish rads, enough to cause a rad away diluted use, also why I suggested healing factor.  You want weak drums and weak rad away diluted, it’s easier to manager, trust me.

I use pumpkin soup, for the PER.

I understand that part, that's why he was able to damage me at first. But, once I left the capture zone (and my friend/teammate was dead), why was he able to still damage me, even after he captured it fully? Did I misunderstand the recent change?
---
Search "worth" within this sub and read one of the other dozens of posts asking the same question and all the answers given.
---
Ultimately, no one can answer this for you. It's your preference. What do you like. How do you play.
---
Watch YouTube vids of gameplay and make a decision based on your opinion.
---
If you have a CAMP in the Divide you will often see one when you FT to your camp.
---
If they implemented these I hope they'd increase the rewards to something tangible as well.
---
I tried playing yesterday and the server was so shity I just popped the disk back out. I'm open-minded enough to accept this cookie-cutter 4th grade level game for it is. But, it can't even run like a AAA. Frankly the only good thing about this game is the remnants of what FO use to be and people addicted to legendary rolls of enemies and the Purveyor. Post story the game is empty any Faction existence is absent. What am I supposed to do, the same 10 fucking events every day?
---
I know what you mean, I too like the skinner box of finding better armor/weapons and I've got still a few perks to increase my damage. But while levelling I purpously postponed damage-cards, because I felt that the balance for my level was appropriate.
---
Of course this doesn't end as long as you can still equip better gear and perks, and that's ok. But I'm baffled at what a similar level guy with a meta build can dish out for damage. 
---
While I'm struggling he can one-shot the same enemy, the discrepancy is just too high. And hits for over 10000 are not endgame INHO, they're just plain broken.
---
Did your friend respawn at the workshop? Just wondering if it was possible because he was "still there".
---
I use them on my ts Fatman... 🤔
---
Haha. Reddit is funny at times. My ign is wellibootz if you want to have a go tomorrow. I'm in the gmt timezone.
---
I have both a furious explosive Gatling laser and a TSE Gatling plasma. The plasma wrecks house. The laser is very good, but not quite as good imo.
---

I’ll probably be on tonight after 8-8:30 Central. 
---
My base is located south east of Top of the World, off of 105, just to the left of the flower on the map. My wife’s store is just across from North Cutthroat Camp to the east.
---
I have a 1060 6Gb and I run on High settings. I get solid 60 like 90% of the time, occasional hitches here and there. However, during Scorched Earth the fps drops to 40 and sometimes even to 30, but it doesn't last long.
---
runs at 50-60 for me on a 6600k &amp; 1070, CPU being the bottleneck. Seems to run better than F4 did. May drop to high 40s inside whitesprings botspam.
---
I'm using mostly maxed or high-ish render distances but I've halved shadow resolution and some of the shadow configs to medium or so to compensate
---
done some other tweaks like removing DoF and their shitty myopia-simulating version of anti-aliasing, also capping fps at 57 instead of using v-synch, I never use v-synch
---
playing at 1440p though, might have to drop settings for 2k
---
I will take those mini nukes and 40mm grenades off your hands. My demo expert loves to see the big boom.
---
Awww.
---
That's awesome. 
---
As much as the gaming world loves to shit on "squeakers"... most of 'em are just trying to have fun.  
---
Remember folks, they're kids. Just be kind to them. You were one once, too.
---
Why is anyone surprised at this point
---
Well said.
---
Yeah instead of fixing it you can cancel reload now according to inside the Vault.
---
good fps make a game significantly more enjoyable, but if you like your cinematic experience then good for you I guess
---
For me it's just the concept. If you are going to send a nice box in a bundle, there should also be something to place in that bundle.
---
What was The Guatentee's modifiers?
---
I've done this but 10k. Feels good when you hear how happy they are to get some help. Ran with the kid for a while and helped him level up, get a few FT spots around the map and dropped some low level legendaries I was going to scrip. Kid was awe struck by the kindness.
---
I've been desperately trying to unlock the suppressor mod for it, but I'm beginning to think it doesn't exist... even though I've seen people selling radium rifles with suppressors. Sad days
---
Hah. Nice. Love it.
---
I love all this!!!
---
I would enjoy a more deadly wasteland
---
the best part of the game for me looking back were the moments i experienced at low level.... scared of everything, die a lot, cant one shot things, supplies run low, aid is scarce... etc etc
---
Sometimes she does, sometimes other AI does, sometimes they will keep running or try to stay hidden. I am guessing is that the main problem, the bug if you will, that she can't find a hiding spot large enough for her. Other enemies run in behind a tree, or a car or a wall, she is a flying monstrosity the size of a small building. Problem is most likely that she can't find a hiding spot so she just keeps running.
---
But as I mentioned, keep people away from the fence and buildings and you will be set.
---
This is a daily post. They really don't care. I've stopped playing just because I've had enough. I'm still in the forums waiting on news of some kind of fix.
---
Exactly!
---
Hmm, how about a camp with a huge pool! The possibilities are endless.
---
When one person is flagged for PVP, the rest of the team is. Even though he died and you ran away, your fight never ended with the attacker. Also, leaving the zone does not magically end the fight. If it did, people would just dance between the border to toggle invulnerability.
---
What I have noticed is, if you fast travel far away from someone, the duel will end. I had someone pick a fight recently at the Whitesprings station. When they sought revenge, they popped a stealth boy and ran at me. Being a Vats build, easily countered by said item, my only option was to retreat. He chased me all the way to the spoiler faction bunker. After I zoned, I fast traveled away and noted his location on the map which meant PVP was over.
---
I asked this same question on the Bethesda forums, and someone said that it still works in Survival.
---
Your time is coming I swear to you!!!
---
Been in the same boat until yesterday
---
Got me a urban scout ass/sent/AP refresh. Damn near shit myself.  I was more surprise the same rolls didn’t turn up on a wood piece lol
---
I'm on xbox.
---
There is a shotgun rifle attachment for a laser rifle?
---
They're not the same types of game either.  It's unfair to compare imho.  Judge them each by their own merits and their own faults. They both have plenty of each and it's just kinda disingenuous to skew hard in either direction. You can simultaneously love a game but recognize its faults and problems and expect or advocate for it to be better and get fixes.
---
I like my low hanging fruit where they are thank you. They're magnificent, just as they are.
---
Hmm, so I noticed healing factor increases the rads removed by radaway (not sure if this is intended, but it's quite a lot). I actually had to remove healing factor on my bloodied heavy gunner because of this - he kept overshooting the 20% mark by a lot when using diluted radaway with healing factor.
---
Any of the downsides of the various mutations I will mitigate by consuming new ones every hour. Yep, I'm that rich lol. My main heavy gunner is sitting on a mountain of .50 cal ultracite ammo and 100-400 of each flux.. and I consider that low, having just sold a bunch. So yeah, I should probably pick them all up mostly.
---
Rad management seems like a pain. I'll be running diluted rad-x and radshield of course, but yeah, dunno if that is enough.
---
I will concur the interface on pc sucks donkey balls.
---
Damn, that hurts dude.
---
What's your GT?
---
See my son doesn’t care if he’s grounded from all that. He still finds a way to have fun. And the point of a grounding to me is not having any fun. I probably wouldn’t do a bar of soap lol I had it done too, it sucked.
---
The fixer, from encrypted. Silenced rifle(combat?)
---
I had theories, like it was when they were fast traveling. But a bug sounds more in keeping with the game in general :)
---
I've had that happen several times at a specific spot down in Cranberry Bog, between Camp Alpha and Sunrise Field.  There's various ghouls or animals that behave like robots, including the sentry bot explosion when killed and a rocket flame coming out of their ass, like they were a Gutsy.

By carry over if you mean from a current version in to the tricentennial that you buy. ... no.
---
Pizza analogy. Bingo!!
---
What. A. Guy.
---
I use the same system for support tickets that I had to use when writing work emails, basically I want to the whole thing to be two sentences. 
---
As an example:
---
"Thing I am trying to explain, basic gist of thing, few details of thing with picture embedded if possible."
---
"What you should do about thing, any action you are expected to take regarding thing."
---
Worked really well for me over the years.
---
Came to say the same, great minds.  One woman's poop is another woman's treasure.
---
Yea it's no big loss for me, but it'd be terrible for someone who actually is a Trader in game, and not just casually selling excess loot like most of us. I was annoyed that I lost a perfectly preserved  pie though. But oh well
---
They have mentioned an offline mode actually but im sure its not high on priority
---
Congratulations on creating a plan to make the game even less fun
---
Both hands raised
---
Bethesda has been aware of this problem months ago but their response to the issue is no response. Complaining to them go unanswered. I  should know.
---
Yeah, I got a lot of that during my time in CS:GO trading. Stuff like "AK CH #661 IBP Holo" or "ST MW Kara BP" or "AWP redline 4x kato". It just seems a bit odd to use trading jargon here on a discussion sub
---
I put in a bug report with beth on this issue.  They just asked me tons of silly questions in lots of posts.  Never got any resolution.  I wouldn't hold my breath that they will ever fix this.
---
I can only ever get it to work when I'm standing on top of the statue.
---
Well here's a post... Up vote the shit out of it?
---
Am I supposed to set up a time through Twitter? They just told me Friday and Saturday then stopped replying when I asked what times were available
---
I’m pretty sure.. being that they all program for a living. They knew this long before you. Not everything is as simple as it sounds
---
Thank you 🙌
---
Ok, you and others maybe know more about how to maximize damage, wish i knew how to.  There's a lot to learn in this game. 10.000 dmg is sick. I just keep on do what l do and trying to get better every day. And that's what's driving me playing on. I'm having fun doing it in Appalachia and it's enough for me.
---
IMO, yes. It has transcended it's initial faceplant and the serious bugs have gotten reduced to workable. You still get some shenanigans, but they are very rare. If you've waited this long I'd wait for a sale or something and get it then.
---
*raised hand meekly* I’m just here to pick firecaps....
---
And in what should be a shock to no one one of the "journalists" at Kotaku was browsing reddit and is turning this news into their latest hit piece on the game.  Including such gems as literally not knowing that the edition of the game actually came with a bunch of shit other than the bag and acting as if people paid $200 explicitly for it.
---
Use? Absolutely? Make though...? Seems like such a waste. I throw away and sell so many of them.
---
I haven't done it enough to know for sure. I just know it happened to me the one time.
---
I’m by that camp and help new low level players too!
---
These are both ideas I've entertained. I know it'll turn back off with the pressure plate but I'm not too sure about how the laser works I'll have to try it. Thanks
---
I've lost a set of PA this way and yeah you can report it but they'll tell you they can't replace anything :-/
---
What happens if you try and respawn. Dumb question but hey
---
Isnt the Tricentennial stuff just downloaded from the PS Store?  If so it should work since you can just redownload it. It wasnt on the disc, I had to type a code to get mine
---
Flair checks out.
---
Not a joke, but have you tried a hard reset on your actual computer, keep it off a few minutes then re boot it all? Sometimes a “cool down” is needed if it’s on all the time
---
I’m not against valid critique but it seems that there’s a external / media focus on the more pedantic issues and not the legitimate ones that are out there
---
That description though
---
I really don’t understand what exactly you’re asking, but I’ve bought both. Vanilla digitally at release then tricentennial later. When I put in the digital code for the tricentennial swag, it just applied it to the profile I was already using. Got to keep all my other stuff, it was just like unlocking preorder stuff with a code. Hope that answers your question
---
Thats your opinion.
---
i toss  extra plans and aid in the Overseer's stash and message people directly. usually hide up the hill to see if they retrieve it
---
i wouldn't even bother tbh,  no one uses those skins
---
Your insinuating you dont enjoy the game as it is, can you offer constructive criticism as to why that is and how you'd improve that? Otherwise your comment doesn't really help
---
im sorry that happened to ya! and sorry for all the mean people here geez
---
its a "friendly community" until you say/do anything against the game not being "perfect: then they all turn on you ugh
---
Done that. Did that when I went to sleep.
---
I'm a synthetic. We ARE better than you!
---
So, you accept the second invite, then he asks (in team chat), if you can accept his team invite, so he can fast travel, instead of just fast travelling to you? And how did you accept the inivite after accepting it?  
---
Sorry, this smells like classic karma grab to me
---
I will never move my camp again.  It took me 3 days to build my existing structure.  I won't even touch the damn thing out of fear that I will blow up the entire structure.
---
I usually lug around Daisycutter so I can use them as I find them. I would not however craft them with the intent to use them as they are far too heavy and the weapon wears far too quick for it to be anything beyond an amusement.
---
It opens the map and let's me click on Vault 76 to respawn, but then says something like "Cannot respawn here" and since I have no other locations discovered, can't try anything else.
---
Ah the days of being afraid of the bigger fish!  *sheds manly tear*
---
I'm not insinuating that at all.  But the changes you propose would make the game markedly unfun, for no real benefit that I can perceive.  All it would serve to do is drive off even more players at low levels, already struggling.
---
I would love my motherboard back so I could play.
---
far from actually, i accepted his second party inv. from there he told me to accept a team inv so he may fast travel to me, which i had missed due to me being busy crafting.
---
I love how we can have a structure literally flying in the sky breaking all real world logic but I can't have a floor placed over a rock without the fucking game imploding.
---
It's the best worst game I've ever played. If it weren't for the Fallout sentiments or the legendary weapon grind I would have been out a long time ago.
---
I feel like a xp increase would be warranted ecspecially with the xp debuff on death! Maybe like survival xp?
---
While in bed too
---
If you are doing VATs you will probably end up doing a stealth/sneak as well. Powered (AP refresh), Harder to detect while sneaking, +1 AGI, +1 PER and +1 LCK are all going to be important for your build. Some of the sneakier armor effects that you could use though are weapon weight reduction, which will free up perk cards for weight reduction that can be used for offensive perks, and food, drink and chem weight reduction which would eliminate the need for both/either of traveling pharmacy and thru-hiker perks, letting you free up some STR to respect and some AGI to use for something like Gun Fu, Action Boy and Adrenaline. 
---
Maybe something along these lines:  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f235ef&amp;d=ic4l71lu2lt2lv2lk2l10s01pd2pk2pl2pp2p02ek1c71a04ao0an2a51a71a30&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=fc815](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f235ef&amp;d=ic4l71lu2lt2lv2lk2l10s01pd2pk2pl2pp2p02ek1c71a04ao0an2a51a71a30&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=fc815) 
---
Personally, I play around with the 1, 2 and 3 rank versions of cards like Four Leaf Clover, Psychopath, Grim Reapers Sprint and Critical Saavy based on whether or not I am using Rifleman or Commando perks at the moment, as I find that the Critical Saavy is more beneficial to me when I am using semi-auto and better able to make use of my crit cycle, whereas when I am full auto I find that I lean more heavily on Psychopath and Grim Reapers Sprint to keep my crits up.
---
I'll eat myself then.
---
I love you by the way ;)
---
By reinstalling, do you mean from a completely clean state? This sort of problem (lack of collisions, constantly falling through the ground and dying) is caused by invalid load orders in the config files. You say the game is unmodded, so it's not mods causing the issue, but it makes me think it's something to do with maybe your old configs from January being read-only or something and staying in that old state
---
Unyielding armor with +1 Perception?
---
Noobs are the solution to my overstuffed stash box issue. I’m always dropping gift bags for noobs (or for big spenders at my shop). Problem is, the lil baby noobies see my lvl 170 emote-spamming marsupial ass come roaring at them in my Barney-colored X01 jet pack, and I think it freaks them out because they run away half the time lmao. Like, I’m not here to grief, I just want to give away 50 stims and a hundred pounds’ worth of bulk junk!! Come baaaaack, my stash box is fullllll!!!
---
Same as here. Xbox
---
To clarify, I currently own the Tri on disc but want to go to the digital format.
---
Ah, i see. Then i'm sorry for the wrong  assumption
---
Exactly! The only bullet sponges ahould be the big boys! Not trash mobs. LOOKING AT YOU SCORCHED.
---
How can I delete those old configs? Do I delete the Fallout 76 folder, THEN reinstall? Cause before I just reinstalled.
---
I forgot there was a code. Sounds like I'll be OK. Thanks!
---
I’m not really sure how we should complete this even with a bunch of people. We had a level 91 full deathclaw at full health and the alpha sheepsquatch took it out in 3 hits and even while 7 of use just pelted it in the five constantly it still took a couple of minutes to kill it after we failed. That alpha is nuts!!!
---
Lol, I came across something similar there yesterday.  I unlocked the fusion core maker for passers by before signing out a short while later.
---
People already have, that link I shared where the dude 3d printed a FULL suit was only a few hundred bucks, including the metal frame underneath it.
---
no worries.
---
Try doing a clean install. Use an app removal tool like revo uninstaller. Will uninstall the game like normal, but will also find all connected files and registry keys.  A typical uninstall doesn't always remove all files. They tend to leave leftover files that can be the cause of your issues. 
---
Make sure you do a backup prior to this, just incase you delete something you shouldn't have. From my experience I've never had any problems and tends to fix a lot of application issues. (I used to work in IT desktop support).
---

---
Its gotten to the point where I just let people take my workbenches because 90% is some douche trying to PVP me that doesn't even care about taking the place. I'm 73 and will just collect junk at the landfill if no one else has claimed and three separate times I've had someone in 100s come try to grief me over it and then just leave. 
---
It's not worth my caps to bother with the headache most of the time.
---
Its a shame you can't point any details I'd like to hear facts instead of opinion otherwise your just complaining for the sake of it. Seems to me the majority of people agree with my ideas but hey different strokes 😁
---
Just dont let it happen again.
---
I've gotten the blow not once but over 4 times and I still don't have it marked. Also, I know I was the one who got the blow because 3 of those times, me and my friends were actually trying to see if having the final blow made it count. I was the only one who shot it until it died when it had barely any health left.
---
To be safe I would remove the skins from anything you applied them to. Just in case it removes the items and not just the skins.  But I would think its ok since its a download.
---
I mean, I would uninstall the game immediately. If I wanted to play Dark Souls I’d have bought Dark Souls.
---
The radio says there's some country roads about somewhere..... 😁
---
I'm really disappointed in energy weapons all together in the Waste, a plasma rifle should be way better than it is
---
This. We need this.
---
I briefly used some for the atomics possum badge.  I was more than happy to get rid of all that extra luggage when I was through.
---
There are people on here that will help. Look for high karma individuals
---
Me too. I’ve got a machine full of freebies like ammo and fully modded weapons and some recipes. The ammo keeps getting hovered up by level 100+ players, but what the hell.
---
thank you! =)
---
RNGeses? Is that you?
---
Sure, but much more risky. You can ask random strangers here or simply dump stuff in a container, make note of who's on that server. Log off, choose other character and rejoin that server and find stuff in container.
---
Obviously all have there risks... an actual friend is your best bet.
---
Trust your feelings Luke, you know it to be true!
---
Oh now I'm fucking triggered.
---
Equip the Good Doggie perk and you can wear it.
---
I think its worth a try test it a bit.
---
The only thing that makes a handmade better is the fact that you can make it ignore all armor when using the piercing receiver tank killer and AA prefix, Ide love a damage boost for plasma rifles but if they did some kind of mods to give it 20 or 30% ignore armor that'd be awesome!, Handmades have so many options. Hell even buffing laser rifles a bit would be sweet
---
The ballistic damage is low because it also has rad damage. This is the balance with the radium rifle.
---
Ok, thanks Just have to sit tight I guess.
---
I vaguely remembered it from around November, when I was doing the main questline stuff in the Ash Heap.  There's a machine outside Burning Mine.  I just went back there, bought a few maps, tracked down the dig site and spent more time in the Ash Heap than I had since game launch.  Got a couple interesting mid-level legendary weapons, as well.
---
Now if anyone can point out some good silver ore nodes, I'd be very happy.
---
Whaddya live in a barn!? (Uses barn template)
---
oh thats how it works! ... i killed a squirrel in the end out of frustration
---
I fucking love plasma rifles Hahah
---
Not like the good old days... lol
---
They ask bugs be reported [here](https://help.bethesda.net/app/home/?_ga=2.236159938.238782725.1559942689-744224138.1558558384)
---
you're letting in a draft!
---
I wish we had more different things to do WITH the other players. I want to set up a card table or an arcade at my camp. Play the board games. Play darts. Something.
---
Well that i have to agree on, melee weapons are superior to anything else when it comes to pure damage
---
Yeah, to be safe it's best to completely delete the folder and any additional files it saves under your documents, etc before reinstalling. If it sees those files there, it might not download the newer versions, especially if they are set to read only. Wouldn't hurt to also run the bethesda launcher as an admin so it isn't prevented from overwriting or creating anything
---
What are you talking about? 30 minutes? Lying Lowe was 7 quests, and i don't talk about the different stages of the "main" quest. It's not the fault of the game when you don't find the content. 
---
And the patches are a great combination of bugfixing, performance optimization and new content. Now they improve some combat mechanics, raids are coming soon. I have no idea what you want more? This game got more content in the first half a year then any other game i played. And it is coming in smaller packages, not a gigantic 2 year dlc which shifts the whole gameplay.
---
Sketch.
---
Ha this is great, I hope people use your services.
---
if you are on ps4, hit me up, ill stay on server while you do your switch, you can stay hidden on the map so i dont even know where you are so you can feel more secure
---
hope my karma is adequate :)
---
Until I yank your capacitor
---
Lmao she's nothing compared to Marcy. Fucking hate that dumb ho.
---
I currently run some good legendary gear that's mostly leather and metal armor. But I also don't play PvP so I'm not worried about top-tier gear. Leather and Metal has been more than enough to get me through any fight in PvE (except nuke zones obviously).
---
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.  Some raider you are!!!
---
Thanks for doing that.
---
I very much agree
---
I know right! I tried stocking it with low level legendaries once too, including a level 1 instigating rifle. Big mistake. Now I make sure to hand over low legendaries by hand.
---
Yes, it is, and you have yours. Curious how your opinion is concerned with what I should enjoy and how I should play. Just because I'm not interested in your conceptual, headache inducing version of a game which I currently enjoy doesn't mean you shouldn't consider other options for yourself.
---
Lolol
---
How can you deny reality so effing hard. I played F3, F4, FNV all with all dlc's in the last year. All completionist style. F76 is BY FAR the largest of the game. F3 took me 110 hours, FNV 130 hours and F4 150 hours. I hadn't even completed the whole map in F76 in 150 hours. And we are one third into the game.
---
Sex Box
---
The "Hot Deals" suggestion made me laugh, very clever.  The best is, it wouldn't sink in about the signs until after the flame throwers did their work.  Then they sit there a second and go, "ohhhhh..."
---
Thank ya kindly
---
How do you see anything out of a night vision scope?  It's worse than a normal scope in every situation.  At night, everything is just a green haze.  During the day, it's a brighter green haze.
---
The recon scope is pretty good, but I cannot find a medium version for either a pipe bolt action or hunting rifle.  After 224 levels, I don't think they exist.
---
You can have tangible change in the world. Power plants will power sections of the map. Nukes will change sections of the map.
---
I don't know why people hark on this so much when even new vegas didn't have anything that changed the world. You finish the story and get booted back to before you started the final quest.
---
I have no problems getting aluminum I’m just saying relatively it is rare
---
Me too, I just wish they did a tiny bit more per shot damage. They are top tier energy weapons after all, and more difficult to get than a Lazer by far
---
Yes.
---
Damn right I can.
---
Cloth is good for one thing in this game and thats molotov cocktails.
---
Yep. When I randomly went back into the terminal and started to notice the differences, I kept saying to myself, "this isn't right. It's not supposed to be like this! What's going on here!?"
---
Journals in the big bend tunnel says that the brotherhood had a team there to monitor who was coming and going into Appalachia and of course to monitor scorchbeasts too
---
Agreed!!
---
I think super mutants (FEV) were created by pre war U.S. at the Mariposa base where they tested on humans. Even after the bombs, vats containing FEV were released into the atmosphere mutating humans and wildlife. The Master and his army of super mutants soldiers were a later threat
---
Nice!!! If you only had a tse weapon to use in case  you were detected.
---
It's a survival game, you do not have to kill everything you come across. Sure that's the fun part but that's the reason why you level up. 
---
Learn to sneak better. Keep crouched, watch those brackets, the wider they get the better you're hidden. While creeping stop every once in a while to do a bracket check. If it fluctuates that means something is nearby. Unfortunately there are glitches that will freeze your danger status. If it seems like you should put of danger but aren't, vats scan the area. That still isn't a sure thing but you do what you can.
---
Instigating is actually better imo and some testing non explosive. I have a pump IE (instigating explosive) that says it does 300+ dmg but can't one shot most super mutants even with a sneak crit. But my 1* instigating combat shotgun says it does 206 dmg but one shots 95% of the time and has slightly better range.
---
You're letting the cows out!
---
I used to only claim workshops to harvest the sweet sweet plans, and then never go back except for defense, once again for plans.
---
Yep, if they decide not to add any anti armor mods to it they should up the damage to compensate or it would create a scenario where it's a tactical choice less armor penetration and more damage? Or go with handmade for full armor penetration?
---
Id prefer new content to be honest, just bring in bug fixes with it, they also have between now and when nuclear winter releases to just keep patching bugs
---
Yes. Faster fire rate and critical modifiers can compete with the explosive effect, you just have to tailor your build a bit.
---
True but they over nerfed it. As it is, it's a pvp weapon only.  Not suggesting a massive boost. Just healthy handful of points thrown on to the stats to make it viable for everything like the others are.
---
I put my unwanted items into containers in popular areas (like toolboxes or suitcases and so on) because I read on here that stuff stays in the containers longer of you log out.
---
I used Revo installer like Chaos said to, now It's installing again.
---
I bumped into one of these in the same spot, right by WS Train station. I had fast traveled in and his placement put you right in the trap room, so he triggered his traps immediately. I didn't even get to look at the vending, but as the room is consumed in flame I just crawled into the farthest corner I could and was able to fast travel away to the train station proper, must've been JUST on the edge of the fire damage.
---
I walked back over to check out the exterior and was talking to another person who had been killed and had his stuff taken, was able to see the walls/flamers reset. Checked the map and figured the owner was sneaking inside as there was no dot. As soon as I mention this to the other guy who got burned, the base evaporates into thin air.
---
I'm actually cool with this idea, but it feels weird to be defenseless to do anything if you roll pacifist normally (which is like...what 90% of everyone in Adventure?)...otherwise you could bust out of the door if you were quick enough. As-is it feels a little like an exploit since they don't (to my knowledge) accrue a bounty or anything...like the game devs didn't think it all the way through when they made the changes to CAMP invincibility and such.
---
Did what you said, installing it again right now. Hopefully it works.
---
Ha
---
It's called a shotgun mod and it fits any explosive gatling plasma?
---
Goodluck, fingers crossed.
---
I just go and stand there and let my mutations and diseases kill him.. does that make me a bad person? Absolutely!
---
Just hope your local fridge raider gang doesn't try to scrap you computer to bulk other junk office supplies to sell to scrap vendors to get more bottle caps.
---
If you got some free candy ill take some, starvin over here
---
Just wear leather armor
---
Stimpacks - When I first started a bloodied build I wondered how I was going to keep up with all the stimpacks I would need.  In practice, I'm selling stimpacks to get rid of the weight as I just don't use them that much.  Bloodied makes such a strong offense that defense isn't that important.  And when I see death coming, I generally just let it happen.  No point fighting the inevitable.  Respawn is free.
---
Now if I'm carrying valuable loot with my rads at 90% and group of tough enemies appears, I do think twice, and thrice....then generally engage, lol.  Where's the reward without a little risk, huh?!
---
So, I, a middle aged transgendered homosexual, said to someone in game chat on pc the other day, "YOU FA*G*T" and they were like "OH, yeah, that's the one word BETHESDA will ban you for" and I'm fully expecting to be banned now becuase I was mad at some jerks who were spawncamping at Watoga on survival and I just kept getting creamed over and over beacause i really needed to do something there. UGH whatever.
---
I dont wsnt to low ball but I wouldnt pay more than 2k-3k for it and Im a shotguns lover
---
Bladed. Machete was my best friend and still my go to.
---
It works. I crafted a ton of ammo yesterday (along with smelting ore). However, I did notice a couple of times on slightly laggy servers that it didn't proc. It seemed as if the game didn't recognize (yet) that you swapped SD in. I would exit out of the crafting screen, waited a couple seconds, then get back to it with SD working fine.
---
You can still complete the main quest line, just not that particular quest. The next quest begins at Charleston Fire Dept, and completing Ounce of Prevention isn't a prerequisite for starting it.
---
Definitely do a workshop if you haven't already. It unlocks a whole slew of defensive options for your camp.
---
Because most hate having a head set on for hours.
---
The items have been in there for a long while. Excess of a week with some having been in since the release of Player Vending and restocked periodically.
---
Yo is it just me or does voice chat on PC suck? I can’t hear anyone when they talk to me... my audio settings aren’t the issue.
---
Berserker is not a very sought after piece of equipment though it is explosive, that being said... 2-2.5k ish? To the right buyer,and could go for more if it was max level. What type of shotgun is it?
---
got the t-51 helmet plans \*yes not a mod, the helmet plans\* from a forest treasure map.
---
Shhhh, you'll kill my revenue stream!
---
Lol. Literal plague Walker
---
I run cannibal and carnivore so just about anything besides bots is edible - but like the others, I still carry various meats for stat bonuses (esp. grilled radstag or ribeye steaks for that sweeet carry weight boost)
---
nice.  i did something similar.  Had an even right next to a workshop, even ended and i started taking the work shop.  3 lvl 30 somethings show up and just stop lol it was pretty funny.  I got on the mic and confirmed that they could hear me and dropped a ton of purified water and stims for them.  They were very happy and grateful, plus they got to keep their workshop.  its nice to be nice sometimes....sometimes...
---
I'm apart of west korea. Ya know. Like north korea. But we launch our nukes. But whenever I take over munition center I get nukes xD cuz no one can find me xD
---
If you get kicked out of the raiders, ill vouch for you for the enclave!
---
(We only listen to mobius for the serums)
---
Your best bet is to sell it to a low-level and *politely* extort like 5-10K.
---
Been a long time since i was a child. He's clearly fussing about being killed.
---
DPS is not the default, it just seems to be all that most people talk about as a playstyle. Specific builds arent there just to keep you up and DP'ing: they're about playing in a particular style that suits the person playing it. DPS builds are easy and quickly satisfying, I cannot deny that in this game you can shoot your way through any situation and complex problem or moment that could also be solved with a different skillset :~p
---
This is why this game needs damage numbers. Do you have any active effects?
---
Lol. I can make all serums so if I join we wont need him anymore.
---
You are STILL going to get the most out of a VATS build at low health. VATS and Bloodied compliment each other because of the Unyielding armor effect. At low health these armor pieces grant you a +3 to ALL stats. And I believe they stack (at least they used to) which gives you a whopping +15 to EVERY SPECIAL STAT  (except Constitution) when your health is low. Think about this: 
---
Luck helps fill that crit meter and even makes items you find more durable, which results in less breakable weapons. 
---
Agility effects the amount of AP you have and your sneakiness (More sneak attack damage and less getting spotted and hit). 
---
Perception boosts your enemy detection and VATS accuracy. 
---
Strength makes your bash attacks hit harder if you need them and lets you carry more stuff, and with a +15 to Strength you hardly need any actual perk points in the stat, leaving you free to focus on VATS perk cards and the other cards you need to get the most out of your build. It mitigates the need to run Deep Pocketed or Light Weight mods on your armor, freeing you up to use VATS-enhancing mods instead like Ultra-Light, or a Dense mod on your chest to tell explosive damage to go piss up a rope. :) Maybe Asbestos for complete immunity to being set on fire...???
---
High Charisma and Intelligence never hurt anyone either.
---
So yeah, if you are bothering to be a VATS build, go Bloodied/Unyielding or go home. A Bloodied VATS build with Unyielding armor mops the floor with any other VATS build you can make to such a degree that it isn't worth making one that isn't. 
---
For armor you want: Unyielding/+AP regen/Whatever
---
Weapons benefist most from: Bloodied/Explosive/ 25% less VATS Action Point cost OR  Your VATS critical meter fills 15% faster 
---
Put all this together with the right serums and perk cards and it's GODLIKE.
---
I need to do the same badge, so I'll report back on what happens.
---
U buy plans or find mods. I dont know if u can get them for scraping
---
It's a pump action shotgun and with the shotguns expert it does like over 200 damage I'm pretty sure
---
Thats a real shame then, hope they are able to fix it and give it back like Fortnite did when a bug erased players items in certain situations
---
I might be in the minority here but I like it - I know someone's been there.
---
I've had this happen multiple times today.    
---
My camp is in the Mire and enemies often spawn nearby when visitors arrive to check out the vending. For whatever reason, multiple enemies have spawned today which say "legendary bloodbug" (even though they are typically not bloodbugs) and after killing them they explode like robots.   
---
I've been at my camp a decent amount over the week and today is the first day I've experienced this situation. I have mixed feelings about it though because so far they've all had legendary weapons... and although legendary enemies do spawn near my camp, it wasn't previously at the rate of nearly every time I go home.
---
~2k. Any less, you might as well scrap it.
---
That toaster called me the N-word
---
As in like status effects like diseases or alcohol and stuff? If that’s what you mean then No. what’s really kind of confusing me is that selecting that weapon is affecting other weapons. I took a video of it but couldn’t upload it here
---
while I do wish bugs and balance were higher priorities.. I dunno about a month...
---
Pressure plate.
---
I started playing fallout games at age 9 and turned out just fine and never insulted anyone online even when they were insulting me, just muted or ignored and moved on. Its not always parents fault for how kids act.
---
I'd really appreciate that, or at least having it more visible in the pip-boy.   
---
I've been trying to do the campfire tales quest. I've discovered it's quite annoying to try to do a quest which only spawns at night when I often can't look around and determine whether it's night vs day, sunset vs sunrise, etc.   
---
I mean, I just wish it'd be darker at night in general. I build my camps around interesting in-game locations partly because they can be the only places in the game that are actually dark. Colorful lights really look a lot better in the dark.
---
The Agility Perk Adrenaline could help you out if you want to stack a spree-killer build. Get a bunch of High fire rate DPS-based weapons and go to town with Instigator or Bloodied weapons.
---
Oh yeah you should be fine then
---
PS4 btw
---
It's simple, because people love fallout and a lot of people had the intention of playing this, it's a massively popular franchise. On the other hand, no one gives a shit about Anthem, it's new and doesn't have a following like this game does, it's no surprise that it fell from the limelight so fast while despite everything, this game manages to consistently stay in it good or bad all the same. Also knowing EA, they will likely just abandon Anthem entirely, whilst Bethesda is making strides on turning fo76 into something better.
---
I am sure we will see a rebalance or additional perk cards. Takes seconds to rebalance a gun.
---
Lmao!! That’s hilarious! I ran into a trap for the first time myself the other day. After browsing a kid’s vending machines, I wandered around a bit, checking out his CAMP (it was very nicely done). I noticed a quaint metal shed in the back yard lit up to high heaven with signs and arrows, so I thought to myself, “I should go in there!” 
---
I should not have gone in there. As the metal door slid shut behind me, I realized all too late that there was no exit. In fact, the room was almost completely bare, except for a dormant Tesla arc and a single powered speaker. Curious, I decided to fast-travel out and back in order to further investigate. Inside the house, I found his terminal which, to my good fortune, had been left left unlocked. 
---
THIS KID. THIS GENIUS. He hooked up the powered speaker to his terminal so that he could play random chromatic tones to his victims while zapping them with the Tesla arc. Just imagine: You’ve been trapped in darkness for hours - maybe even days, you have no way of knowing - and every time your eyes begin to droop, a bolt of electricity zaps you awake, while whatever remains of your sanity is gradually eroded by the incessant drone of C#. 
---
This kid is my hero. 
---
*TLDR: Some men just want to watch the world burn*
---
On Xbox it's risky I can put item in container leave the server  go to mule find a player you met a few mins ago and hop on to their game. If your lucky it's the same server and you retreive item from container.  But do at your own risk
---
Might just be visual. Have you tried killing stuff?
---
Is it just one character?  If you make a new one, does that happen too?  What if you make a character, then close game, then open game and make a new character, then close game, then open game and play 2nd character?
---
I'd be more inclined to use them if they didn't break before I finish a single magazine.
---
The endings to New Vegas changed depending on what you did, meaning you do in fact have a change in the world. I also prefer having no post-game content. Fallout 3 was like that before fans complained that you couldn’t play past the ending slides.
---
*clearly*? I see more talk about the ignorant kid than I do the fact he was killed over and over again. What the hell are you reading?
---
Lol. Damn straight I woulda paid that at level 35
---
Block him, go to a different server, and hire high levels if it persists.
---
Vault 111 was in the realms of Boston though, a major target, vault 76 is near....    Err..... Trees i guess
---
Yeah ok I got it
---
I played a lot with Instigating Weapons and it works perfect for me! Oneshot everything..
---
But sbq sheepsquatch? It’s hard to deal damage with ie Hunting rifle 
---
I’m looking for AA Assault rifle with VATS Crit damage and VATS cost less. Semi auto.
---
Any users of that type for weapons?
---
*But you might get bored of it...*
---
Wow..this your problem. And nothing to do with you being a girl. Claim a public source, open to PvP.
---
The Musician quest is definitely bugged, but I somehow managed to get another instrument to work recently. I already had every instrument at my camp for when I'm playing with other people and/or I get a lot of visitors at once, but playing some of them at my camp didn't work.   
---
I craft a lot of stuff at workshops so it's possible that I got it to work via playing an instrument I crafted in a workshop... I'm honestly not sure. I gave up out of frustration and then checked back to discover that one bugged instrument had suddenly changed its mind.
---
I hope so too! It's fun for all involved... well, maybe not those griefers ;)
---
I use a faster fire rate executioners Gatling Gun and its great
---
"Hire high levels" for what? She claimed and workshop and is whining.
---
Didnt yours come with a cardboard "disc" with your game code on it?
---
Seriously. Rose at least has some personality behind her intentional obnoxiousness.
---
Marcy went through some rough shit, but it doesn't justify her continued asshole behavior to everyone around her. I built this fricking place from scratch, you're protected and well-fed. Give me sass one more time and I'll march your ass back to where I found you.
---
Sounds like a fantastic idea, making Survival mode more attractive to PvPers since it could be both profitable and fun
---
Whats stopping you from going to a different server ?
---
when I do hear people, they usually sound ok, not great, but understandable..more a function of the mic I'd say
---
TSE was broken, but it made everyone equal. Everyone could 1 shot each other. You had to outsmart the opponent to win. Now it's just VATS melee that 1 shot teleport and sentinel/cavalier that is near impossible to counter because mainstream duping was patched and its increasingly rare to get it
---
Neandertal?
---
I once owned two workshops in the bog, and got free food from some of the creatures. I was lucky and managed to keep them for hours, until my game crashed.
---
GOTW - another settlement needs tour help.
---
Yes, but I'm talking about the glitch where they couldn't kill mobs
---
That wpuld be debella.
---
Make sure you delete Fallout76Custom.ini if it exists, default location:  %USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76\\
---
Yes. Took me 3 hits to kill a lvl 50 protectron with it. I can 2 hit the same thing with my anti armor switchblade that has 107 damage. I know the anti armor has a little to do with that but in theory that hook should be putting out an additional 143 damage right? So should at least be 2 hitting it like the switchblade if not 1 hit.
---
It'd be easy to make a "Power Armor Frame Statue" item that could be placed as a decoration and then collected pieces could be put onto it and kept there in Construction mode so that only camp owners could move it.
---
I mean that is one option anyway
---
Although I have not confirmed this myself, others on reddit have said that some of the bugged things which won't complete on one character will complete on a new character (exa: discovering locations).  
---
If that's accurate, Bethesda could be viewing this as "Well, they can always create another character, and that would also allow them to experiment with a different build!" or etc... &amp; thus lower hanging fruit since there would be a way to complete it in theory, just an arguably annoying way :P
---
Go to a different server.
---
I hate people always trying to turn things into a gender or race issue. 
---
Maybe they are being a douchbag for attacking repeatedly and trying to claim workshop, but it has nothing to do with her being a girl. It's  PvP area and will be subject to PvP regardless of who you are.
---
Omg please please please please PLEASE Bethesda can I have cacti??? I have the Atom Shop succulents, but I want some 6ft-tall saguaro spiky bois in my front lawn lol
---
Yea and no way its only a visual bug not admitting its been broken from the start is just annoying. 
---
And class freak interaction with speed demon has been like this since BETA. 
---
I know, most of the community knows and extensive testing has been done.
---
There is currently ZERO benefit of using class freak with speed demon. 
---
So stop telling us its just visual and fix it damnit. You think we care as much about visual bugs as actual mechanics not working? 
---
I facepalmed hard.
---
Pretty sure this is against the subs rules, also workshops are pvp areas.
---
Him killing you has nothing to do with the fact that you are a girl, you are in an open pvp area.
---
Did you not read the message about pvp when you claimed the workshop?
---
Not only am I not going to close your door, but I’m also going to turn off all your lights.
---
...and don't forget what I told ya
---
Just cuz ur right that don't mean I'm wrong 
---
Another shoulder to cry upon 
---
I don't wanna lose your love toniiiight
---
Didn't work. But I just got a reply from Bethesda, seemingly from a real human (shocking) and I'm trying what they've told me to do.
---
Ah screw the whole thing.
---
This actually has really held me back from messing around with my second character. My primary is a VATS-heavy sniper, but when I started attempting to use VATS for my new character I quickly realized that it was incredibly annoying. If I preferred to have a melee build from the onset &amp; also liked VATS, it'd probably drive me insane.
---
As long as content cant be completed we cant complain about lack of content. ;)
---
Delete this post.
---
Thanks! That's what I felt like they were trying to do last time, but I wasn't sure if I missed the point when they decided to change the leaderboard to be based on Survival Score.
---
  It's funny to me to, because if you really wanted more active, involved PvP in survival and can't find people who do, Hunter/Hunted radio is still a thing. I'm not sure if I've seen people tune into it since the first couple of weeks while playing survival, though.
---
 Having options for how you engage seems like a good thing, and allows for situations that aren't always kill on sight PvP.
---
Yes. Bloodied ffr assault rifle does a good job of melting stuff.
---
Yeah, i wish the servers were leveled
---
Let us know if it works and what they had you do. Might help someone else with the problem. Goodluck!
---
Berserker is -50% dmg at 50Dr, it also leaks to your other weapons but that is just visual as the dmg numbers turn normal when you unequip the weapon.
---
But yeah, basically if you have ANY armor on or any perks or mutations that give DR berserker loweres the weapons damage by -50%
---
I beat on mole miners.
---
Uh, sneak works very well against the SBQ, along with the sneak attack bonus. I've been running a bloodied unarmed build for a long time and it works. When I start hitting her while sneaking, under \[caution\], visible chunks come off her health bar. When detected, there is a noticeable decrease in damage, but still decent. This is the only build I find that sneak is worth it (haven't tried one handed, didn't see the point if you're unarmed)--all others will be quickly detected unless you are really far away.
---
Problem is, as you mentioned, is radiation management. You have to get out of there at some point. RadShield is very helpful.
---
REEEE!! Hens &amp; chickens, prickly pears, and saguaros, oh my!! And flower boxes!!!! Marian the Librarian, you have officially made my day 😍
---
Gotta keep those heavies fed.
---
^^Best comment in this sub today.
---
You have to press any button to start.
---
If nothing else I'd love to see the annoying mystery ghoul attacks fixed... When you are attacked by ghouls who are stuck in the laying down pose and/or invisible.
---
The problem is that there's no enticement in hunter/hunted. It isn't really explained that well and seems to be so so on its reward
---
Wonderful! Responding as I leave the office now. Shoot me a message on Xbox and I'll connect with you right when I get on!

Navigate to C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda.net Launcher\games\Fallout76\

Move the "Data" folder and the Fallout76 config file to your desktop.

Move both the Fallout76 and the Fallout76Prefs file to your desktop

I'll bet 10k caps you are really a dude
---
I had a moment like this with a team where I helped a really low level go out and explore the ash heap region, talking through party chat and working together.
---
That's not our way. Unless called for.
---
I was never going to buy Anthem regardless of what people said. Just not my type of game. Fallout is my favorite franchise and I was very disappointed at first. Things seem to be improving though. Also considering the fact that I am still playing the game I would say it was worth my 60$ despite all the bugs.
---
I always message people that their collectors are full when I swing by Hemlock to loot the nodes from below the extractors and less than half ever go collect. (I thought that was somewhat relevant from the post)
---
Yeah so those two things are totally different things. And again you are not accounting for labor at all.
---
"Why do people always try to turn things into a gender or race issue."
---
Well to be fair, you did by seemingly finding it necessary to add the fact that you are a girl to your post.
---
Don’t forget the roof!
---
Would definitely belp. I feel bad doing anything when everyone's under Level 50 (I'm 161) and can't stand those people who play 18 hours a day with their Level 800 Characters.
---
Why don't you ask them directly? It's not like we know more than you do.
---
Interesting, did the revo uninstaller not catch those? (Not sure how much attention you paid to list of files).
---
I would have thought those would be files captured by the tool and deleted for the clean install.
---
Well to be fair, OP did by seemingly finding it necessary to add the fact that they are a girl to their post.
---
Beam Splitter.
---
I believe it's a barrel called a splitter. It turns the gatling plas into a shotgun that shoots 9.1 times per second. Pretty nifty.
---
Players. If you’re on Xbox, I know a guy who will buy it from you.
---
That was patched relatively fast and the cause of it was known so it was easy to not get it, it wasnt that big of a deal.
---
Id hold on to it. You can sell it for around 5k to the right buyer that doesnt want to pvp. But after after the weekly reset it could be worth way more.
---
The answer to this question, and a lot of others, is that BGS is garbage.  Garbage sophomoric young idiots make garbage games, and this is a full on garbage game.  It will stay that way until they bring in some experienced, mature designers.
---
I don't think Revo got them. Tbh I was sketched out by Revo, looked like malware. I still used it tho.
---
Random thought... 
---
Why are all the rhododendrons so small? I’ve never seen a rhododendron in real life that was under 5-6 feet tall lol. Actually, now that I think about it, all the flowering plants are pretty tiny. Is there an explanation in the lore for this? Like, does radiation stunt growth? 
---
Omg. What if we could use fertilizer as Miracle-Gro and have fat flowers?? Fat flowers are happy flowers!! 🌺
---
I can see that. I wonder if it was integrated better into the game somehow, like through a Rose quest or something, and explained through dialogue in game, if it would be used more.
---
 It would be kind of cool if you could gain rep with the factions/lose it with others based on how you played and what quests you did. Maybe causing people in other factions to maybe get quests to hunt down people from other factions, kind of like dark souls PvP works. Make the flare guns faction based, and when like a low level responder player is getting jumped, or needs help with a quest, they can fire it off and send out an alert.
---
Yep, plasma rifles too.
---
I'm sorry. I was trying to be funny. 
---
Preston from f04 "another settlement..." 
---
Your post reminded me of this. 
---
Sorry for any confusion.
---
What exactly is enjoyable about snapping issues with camps, crashing when eating, enemies shooting through walls, players becoming invulnerable, audios issues where turrents/enemies never stop sound like their shooting, issues with inspecting items, legendarily items displaying wrong stats (ex. rad resist turning into disease resist) ? And so, so, so much more? Some of these bugs are new some of them existed since release and some have been patched just to come back. These bugs need to be eliminated for good.
---
i have perfected the dump-and-switch, thankfully.  it's too bad BGS are such garbage they won't do something for this though.
---
I've not seen a use for flare guns in such a long time, that would be amazing to see as a functional feature
---
Lol, i wish i could play all day
---
I can't tell if an open door has a lock on it until it's too late. I've locked myself inside on a few occasions. Not cool!
---
You're good! Quote went over my head for a second Haha, just excited to start making the wasteland a better place for all!
---
That's exactly why i made my comment bud... because OP made it a gender issue... 
---
I'm expanding on this guys comment. I'm agreeing with him that it has nothing to do with gender and questioning why people (OP) make it a gender or race issue.
---
he is talking about his own fruit is a ball pun.
---
Dang, that pie is a big one. It's like a trophy if you get one. Shit. That sucks. 
---
Try blueprinting your vendors and it should save the inventory should anything occur in the future. I don't think it needs blueprinted each time you change the inventory. Just once.
---
You have to take your armor off, dood. The less armor you wear the more damage the weapon does. The more armor you wear the less it does. Took me a while to figure that out too.
---
Usually applies to everything, lol.
---
A diplomatic approach
---
u/ladydevann Any thoughts from the team on this stuff?
---
u/Yabvone
---
Do though whe have perks to reduce pistols pistols there are no need for pistols in this game
---
More repeatable quests that refresh in less than 12 hours would be fun, especially stuff like Biv's quests (In my opinion)
---
Is your controller on?
---
Instigating, +50% limb damage, and faster reload.
---
I had no problems playing with my 6700k @ 4.9ghz / 1080ti playing on max 1440p settings. I have since upgraded to an 8086K @ 5.1ghz / 1080ti combo and noticed no difference in how the game runs. It sounds like it could be your video card. Time to switch over to team green.

Nor do their weight hit 24 when fully modded

I can confirm that decorations are definitely a complicating factor.   
---
Lately I've been spending a lot of time building complicated structures in workshops and attempting to understand the blueprinting system and its bizarre bugs. It's been especially annoying because either the servers or my ISP or both have been extremely unstable this week, so I kept getting disconnected constantly while in mid-build and then arriving on a new world to an empty workshop.   
---
After spending 3-4 hours tormenting myself by making blueprint after blueprint that refused to work for no reason that I could easily see / understand, I changed strategies. I split the building up into a bajillion individual blueprints -- one for the foundation and stairs, one for the main part of the building, one for the left side of the porch, one for the right side. And then separate blueprints for the interior decorations and furniture - one for the N side, S side, E side, W side, etc.   
---
In retrospect, I think that some of the furniture was clipping into the walls a tiiiiiny bit... not enough to be visually obvious to me at all, but enough to have the game view it as intersecting.   
---
This strategy doesn't really appeal to me, though, because in an ideal world I'd want to have blueprints for quite a few different structures. My initial concept was that I wanted to design interesting &amp; functional camps that were specific to the individual workshop and ideally didn't use many materials beyond wood &amp; steel, so that I could quickly throw them down when I arrived without using any of my own materials. It's been pretty rare that I've encountered anything built in a workshop which is a uniquely decorated camp vs basic protection of generators &amp; etc.   
---
But now that I've experienced how difficult it is to attempt to create something like that with a full interior set of decorations, it's not surprising to me that I rarely stumble across it :(   
---
In general though I would definitely recommend experimenting with this in workshops rather than your own camp, cuz for whatever reason I find it a lot less frustrating when a random structure won't blueprint vs my camp.
---
Ah, wasn't the first thing that came to my mind mb
---
My hand made weights like 30 with all my mods
---
At level 14 go north in the forest area near the Farris wheel there's a event called leader of the pack. Play that event you can get a couple of legendary stuff. I got a quad expolsive double barrel early on and was still using it at level 50.
---
yea I just wanted to tell you he wasnt talking about the bugs 😂
---
The brazier in the center courtyard needs to be lit first.
---
If you're on xbox I'll give you 1k for it.
---
No doubt. All my armor has weapon weight reduction perks but I’d love to be able to run around nuke zones in power armor again.
---
"Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads."

Eh, the return on crafting fertilizer with spoiled edibles is horrible from what I remember. You need like 10 of a type of spoiled food to craft raw fertilizer, and the developers didn't even have the decency to make it worth 4 or 5 fertilizer, no you only get a whopping single (1) unit of fertilizer.
---
Unless you're finding bag after bag of hundreds of spoiled food, I feel bad for you if that's your primary method of producing fertilizer.  The proper way would be hitting places like the  Vault-Tec Agricultural Research Center, and basically any other farm, or agricultural center that has bag of fertilizer around.

Same, I run 4 weapon weight armor, but would like to run FDC cause I could free up 6 (3 pharmacy, 3 tru hiker per cards) for potential 3 points for a reduced weight perk card for rifles
---
Lol np, im one of the moderators  for the group, and the one who started it lol, so if you join and have questions or need anything at all plesse fill free to ask.
---
Oddly when I take my armor off, my damage output still goes down from the new 150 to like 120.
---
Weird. Always worked for me. Surprised it didn't since those are the most common application folders, should have been first place to look. 
---
Lol yeah, can never be to careful when using applications you've never used or being recommended by strangers. Typically what i do is a quick google search on product, see if i find other sites with user reviews on it. If it's malware, their will be plenty people complaining about it.

We need it

Heard they're supposed to start shipping them next week.

You clearly aren't interested in bettering the game and are just a negative person who feeds off griefing others and making snarky comments as well as contradicting yourself so theres no point in wasting any more time on you! Hope you're not so miserable one day lol
---
Do you have mods installed?
---
(Or were there mods for installed and deleted ?)
---
Bro, this ain’t Minecraft. Maybe you’d be happier playing Minecraft?
---
Nope, I'm on Xbox
---
Gotcha, so my mutations are effecting it? So why is it showing 250 then until I equip it? Wouldn’t it be the same as anything else that is going off of what I am wearing? Like if I look at the weight of a purified water in my stash, it’s showing the weight if I was to grab it out with my current armor and such. So my 20% food and water weight reduction is already calculated. Wouldn’t that apply to this as well?
---
based OP
---
I do play Minecraft actually

I went down that road and found a spot near a junk pile but I'm not getting an option to build a junk extractor.
---
I live in the Savage Divide by Site Alpha and I’ve had him spawn at my CAMP a few times. Scared the crap out of me the first time it happened lol. He’s mostly pretty random, though. Hope it helps!
---
😂 I literally just lol’ed at this!
---
Floating camps do have another advantage. When vending arrived, I didn't have to change my build to avoid people getting stuck in the foundations. Players don't seem to spawn floating several stories in the air. ;)  
---
But there is an alternative if you hate the way they look -- placing the foundation underwater. It's not difficult to hide and makes it look like you have a regular house which just happens to be floating on the water. It can also be beneficial for people who are tired of repairing their camp. There are some areas where enemies don't spawn in the water, even when a bunch of people start visiting the vending station. Water also often has nearby plants which are useful in recipes &amp; can be aesthetically pleasing for the outdoor patio &amp; bar...

Harpers Ferry as well, the train tracks end in a blocked off tunnel.

I would love my paycheck to be higher so I can play it. Everything on low and still 40 fps.
---
You are the hero we need AND deserve
---
I keep hoping that at least is maybe tied into a later content add. Like the one after nuclear winter? I forget the name of the next one atm.
---
I think you're exaggerating how the changes would effect difficulty, my changes would actually decrease bullet sponginess making combat faster paced and fluid but you're entitled to your opinion. I just don't think you see what I'm going for, these enemies wouldn't suddenly become murder machines, they would have clear strengths and weaknesses
---
Yeah, I tried all of that, even reinstalling the game twice, but to no avail, sadly
---
Well it was made for singleplayer and then just ‘’upgraded’’ to multiplayer.
---
🧐 cynical me thinks you may have a point.
---
It needs to be crafted separately. Not applied like a mod. It works like an outfit not a weapon skin.
---
Sorry to hear that
---
Hopefully someone more knowledgeable will comment and resolve your problem
---
So you created that account so you could make this post every day?
---
I only recently began having this problem, happens when i turned in-game radio volume down.   i'd rather have no annoying radio music than hear other people anyway...
---
Some emotes have multiple options. Move over each emote and a few will give an option to Expand. That's where it places them. 
---
Activation from the shop defaults it to the top of the list but everything should be in the expanded list.
---
I love this type of humor and creativity. I have thought about doing something like that myself. It has also crossed my mind to place my vending machines on flooring hanging off a cliff, then server hop or move my camp just to see the outcome.
---
I would really enjoy this feature. When people visit my camp, I enjoy playing instruments for them or lounging on the couch nearby in a friendly way.   
---
But it's frustrating to sit there doing nothing when I could be going through my inventory for gifts I might like to offer them, eating/drinking, planning my next quest, etc.   
---
Standing up with the pip-boy open sometimes seems to communicate that I'm about to fast travel elsewhere and/or uninterested in interaction :/
---
Hopefully, thank you for your help though!
---
I eat all my spoiled food to pump myself up with diseases because I’m a filthy boy.
---
Will do
---
Seems like Bethesda could set all opened &amp; unlocked doors in the game to close after they had been open X minutes?
---
Maybe try nuking Spruce Knob?
---
I’m probably wrong, but I’m hoping it ties into the big content add following nuclear winter. Like possibly some closure on the overseer story somehow tying into the other vaults opening/possible NPCs getting added maybe? I know I’m probably being stupidly optimistic tho.
---
Do you use calibrated shocks? They add 50lbs to each leg so the other armors also get 100lbs. (Excavator gets 200+).
---

Well done!

It's the stealrhy hunched over ice skating zombies that concern me. Yet to actually die to one, but they're scary when you're bloodied.
---
Tbh I’d have to look but I know a few location discovery things especially, right off the top of my head. They did fix the frog habitat/badge thingy at least tho!
---
You want to hear..... facts...... about why the game isn't fun at low levels? 
---
Quit playing stupid. You know why.
---
Sorry I don't why don't you explain?
---
Jetpack dous it for me,but when farming escavator it is!
---
I love doing things like this for newbie characters 💜 I frequently make lvl 5 guns and drop them with ammo, food water, stims etc as people exit the fault. 😂
---
Nah, why don't you try playing the game, since clearly you don't.
---
Thanks for the constructive feed back!
---
he was probably bummed you spawned low lvl mobs too..
---
Thanks for being accepting of viewpoints that differ from your own!
---
Hope this helps as I have had the same issues on xbox. I cleared reserve space, launched 76 to home screen, closed 76 to xbox home. Held the button to prompt the Turn off console/controller/reset option and selected reset. Gave my xbox 2-3 mins after it shut down. Then started like normal. Seemed to work for me
---
Claws are unarmed. One handed are swords and knifes
---
Sorry what was that view point?
---
Alright, thanks, that's useful information to know. I just would have assumed the PvP toggle would be on a timer, like when you try to leave your Workshop or CAMP boundaries while trying to place an object, to prevent what you described.
---
No, he specifically respawned elsewhere since he also wanted no part in the PvP.
---
It is on the Pipboy. If you're using the actual view, you can see the little rotating numbers below the screen and to the right.
---
In Fallout 3/NV PA had specific stat changes depending on the suit and I think they should bring that back.
---
Yeah T-45d shouldn’t be as good over all compared to T-51b. But it should have something like +2 strength but -agility. Where as the T-51b should give a +1 to strength and agility. So for a real heavy weapon player it balances and gives more reason to try different types, not just ditch the old one because the new one is just plain better.
---
76 actually did something I liked here, 51b is overall the best but the T-60 is considerably cheaper to repair and maintain. So there is a pretty good trade off and reason to use different types.
---
Stop bringing the "singe player" argument.   
---
There was MUCH more than that.  
---
The game was a big buggy mess, poorly optimized (sometimes unplayable for some people who had big configurations...), unstable, and was a poor rpg, a poor looter and a poor survival game. It had way more bugs than previous Beth games, and even bugs coming from Fallout 4 that modders fixed and that Beth never, ever fixed. Also the "quests" all coming from holotapes are a joke people stopped caring about pretty fast.  
---
60$ for a such an unfinished product is outrageous. 
---
They even did a beta, but you had to pay for it and that fixed litteraly nothing (which is pretty normal since it was a beta that lasted a bunch of days a few weeks before the launch).  
---
So, all of this, well, you had the right to point out that added to all those bad points, they sacrificied the single player experience.  
---
And then Atomic Shop &amp; Canvas Bag scandal were just the icing on the cake.  
---
Now they worked hard to save fallout 76 and their reputation, the game is decent, more stable, less buggy (but still is), and gets better and better, but it 1000% deserved the backlash it got.  
---
For Anthem, it got a ton of backlash too, it took a bit more time for people to realize the joke it was tho (once they finished the story). But also, people gave up on it pretty fast too, after all, fans had lost their trust for Bioware already thanks to Andromeda, DA2 and Inquisition, and had even lower expectation for Anthem than people had for F76.
---
They're faster, you can probably squeeze in 3 hits versus 1 with a heavy 2h that kind of thing. 
---
On my melee I eventually spec'd into all of em just to have the option.
---
My argument: yeah, when it wasn't just everyone taking a turn at whoever's been alive the longest. You wanna PvP against people who aren't trying to actively engaged everyone they see, you should have to work for it.
---
 It would make raiding less about just going to grief the guy marked on the map, and have you planning on how to catch people slipping.
---
 Get killed trying to take down a mark, and now you really want him dead? Pay up the caps to see who's greedy enough to come try and get a cut of the action, letting more people engage in PvP organically.
---
In my experience the location has played a big role in sales, regardless of how I priced the items.   
---
Prior to vending being released, I wanted visitors at my camp cuz I spend a lot of time building camps. So I picked locations which I thought I could make fairly visible from other spots that seemed popular. My last camp was next to the train station by top of the world. It got a steady stream of visitors even before vending was released.   
---
I moved to the Mire just because I found a cool underground bunker that isn't a marked location and isn't part of any quest that I've discovered yet. I expected my sales to plummet because I was no longer near a train station &amp; not as easy for people to randomly stumble upon. But for whatever reason the messenger quest in the Mire frequently spawns nearly on top of my camp. It doesn't seem like as many people have camps in the Mire in general &amp; I think some people are using it as a fast travel point when they haven't discovered other locations yet.   
---
If I was less picky about always wanting to build around interesting in-game spots, I think building near the various challenge locations would likely bring in a lot of caps. For example, the camping quest where you collect insect parts always seems to direct people to the same location for bloatflies. It doesn't appear to be a marked location that can't be built around...
---
I'm in the middle of the map, if he wants high-levels he should go to the right side as the level system dictates. I was here first and he happened to spawn in behind shortly. A level 30 doesn't face level 68's yet a level 400 can face anything. He can go elsewhere if he doesn't like it.
---
That indeed worked, thank you very much!
---
made every one equal. Unless you didn't have TSE lmfao
---
your comments win the internet for me today
---
those springs though
---
It's our thanks for you cleaning up the waste(land).

Nah, the criticisms are totally warranted. It’s on you if you’re not paying attention to what you’re clicking on, it literally takes a few seconds to verify what you’ve done so you’re not selling the wrong item. Besides, this guy is pretty much the only person making a post about this, so the issue isn’t totally the interface, it’s predominantly operator error.
---
👀
---
Whitesprings spawn mobs from levels 22-68.
---
Yeah they are removed from the list. Can't expand them to select alternative emotes. When I go back into the the Atomic shop they are all unchecked, reset.
---
You're doing that wrong.
---
I wish it was as civil as that. Instead of other players sneaking up killing u then taking ur stuff and leaving the server
---
Sure, what's your platform and in game name?
---
I am going to need to be on your server damn. Just wondering the forest collection my goodies.
---
Oh, it happened.
---
I know what you mean, but in all honesty how often do you need to repair your pa ? Since getting my first set at level 25 I've repaired a total of 4 times if that. They take a pounding and rightly so but I think the repair cost is negligible. You don't need to repair them often enough to care about cost unless it was something ridiculous. Stat changes would be good though, it would make them more unique and in my opinion that's what they need.
---
Lol, are you dumb?
---
Yes!
---
Thirsty as fuck
---
Yeah one handed likely has higher damage per second output than most two handed weapons, but the number is bigger in the pipboy so people just ignore that.
---
No, just trying to help get people banned that are duping.
---
For research purposes?
---
Ok, if you equip a little known perk called Super Duper, you can sometimes create a duplicate boiled water. Might work with other things, dont know.

&gt;Get wood from Sylvie and Sons logging camp, and get plastic from the plastic pumpkins inside Morgantown High School (trick is to go through the back and you'll enter the gym, pumpkins, plastic plates, and golf balls everywhere).

Swap Action Girl in for Sneak when you're on a team; it doesn't add much when Lone Wanderer isn't in play i.e., you're on a team. If you don't want mutations, remove Starched Genes, set Four-Leaf Clover to 1 point, and get the 3 point version of Critical Savvy (to have a good chance to chain criticals.)

Yea I’m literally just looking for the fascnate fire pit plans more the.l anything . My other character I found the hanging ribbons cheap as hell .. do you have the fire plans ?
---
Yes I do on my excavator but not got them for my ultracite yet. But technically your still losing 100 carry weight, and 4x ore harvesting. I realise alot of people might not care much about ore but it's a no brainer for me. One run into the mountains where the savage divide meets the ash heep and I've got over 100 iron ore, 100 lead ore, and 150 copper and aluminium. When you smelt that down it's a lot of resources for 20 mins grind.
---
Alright I’ll add you later thank you sir
---
What’s your gamer tag sir ?
---
Haha. =)
---
Dang. That's the first I've heard of that one.
---
Nice. Thanks, dude.
---
Months ago huh? I got the game the day player vending came out. Was not even a month ago.
---
Quit with your bullshit!
---
Why does a handmade weight the same as a missle launcher? Why god why
---
You can change that yourself maybe you did that accidentally
---
You know what, you made a good argument. Can't fault that logic.

So I need caps then.

 First not my first rodeo well over 100 queen fights and second  I’m not a one shot Charlie I don’t just show up to collect , I participate fully from the beginning and help other players. I personally put 1000 plus rounds of explosive anti armor 5.56 and 4 orbital strikes into that biatch !so yeah... not the case at all . I see those clowns that show up and pump 3 shots into her before she dies and then skip , can’t stand those guys.
---
How would you even get to levels past 200-800
---
Until this arrives, I've been amusing myself via collaborating on structures in workshops with others &amp; then blueprinting them. It's the closest method to have a shared base in a consistent spot

It keeps the game fun between content releases. Maybe, someday, the game will be interesting enough to not get bored and build creative little Vault-tec experiments.
---
Absolutely, just step into the van.  
---
Say, does this rag smell like Chloroform to you?
---
Well shootin tootin, I didn't know that was a thing. Still, I would like something like that to be a lot more accessible like many of the melee boosters. Will definitely be doubling down on doing Biv stuff now though
---
Actually only 3x per day

I had someone come by my CAMP and buy about five of them. So...I'm assuming they use it for Scorchbeast attacks?

I just added ypu, im Masokissed97
---
Look if the brotherhood was involved, that level 28 would have been shot in the street, and factory taken for protection and tech.
---
The vault is rather close to Whitesprings, which is the in-game analogue of The Greenbriar, which also held a massive bunker designed to protect US govt officials. The existence of that bunker was a poorly kept secret, so you can bet that the area would have been a major target for a nuke.
---
No ... fuck those fucking fucks ... m rating ... i guess it could depend on the 'f' word but ...
---
I don't know how I lived without my backpack and weapon weight reducing armor tbh. The price you pay for being a stealth rifleman I suppose. 
---
But seriously Bethesda pls give us some perks to reduce rifle weights.
---
Exp breaks instigating. The explosion hits just before the bullet meaning the target isn't at full hp anymore.
---
Awsome my dude!
---
that too :)

This is normal and how I play most of the time.

How do I fix!

Nah, apes have highly developed social skills and don't need electronic assistance in communicating with other apes.

He's a dick but it's pretty common unfortunately. I personally try to take a good chunk of health off of each ghoul I see then let the lower level player take them out, but most people don't bother.

Thank you for spreading the truth sir

The last 4 trips I had no leg ghouls at all so Im glad to hear it's just my shit luck :)
---
Wild ass conspiracy theory: 
---
What we currently know as Appalachia is actually a simulation being run on the people in Vault 76 to find our what happens when you give nuke codes to random people. At some point, the simulation will end, our characters will "wake up", and we'll step out into the real Appalachia which will look much more devastated than what we're playing in now.
---
I love this &amp; submitted, but I'd really appreciate more "other" options. 
---
For example, for #5 - my favorite part of player vending isn't listed. It's that I can build around in-game locations (which I love) and still have some amount of people discover &amp; visit the camp.
---
Holy crap, you are so right on this.  Second server hop and found Sturdy Robot Legs!  Thanks!  One more Badge done!
---
Holy crap! That's it! Thank you I was wondering why it wasn't working out. Is it a bug or how it's intended? Should I report to Bethesda?
---
Exactly where I just found Sturdy Robot Legs after a second server hop!  Thanks!
---
Yup. This is happening for me constantly on PS4. I bought my first emote (Bye) and was very excited to use it, but having to continuously manually equip it over and over is really decreasing my enthusiasm about purchasing any more emotes.   
---
Also, one of the emotes ("No Way") doesn't show up period.

Lolol hold select and use the left thumb stick to move the cam. Make sure you do it out of your camp though.

"No one finds it funny" looks like you are objectively wrong here as pkenty of people found it amusing looks like. You =/= everyone

No idea if it's a bug or a feature.

That’s insane but I still don’t understand how

Hello, shit for brains, it came out in 2018!

I can see them saying that's intended which makes 0 sense. I will make a video and a post thank you for the info.

Gfit emote.
---
Great idea, although it'd be lovely if the flyer included the time / time zone. I assume this won't be a 24 hour live event?
---
Yeah absolutely. It’d be good is some suits had perks too like T-45d/60 made you better with heavy weapons, X01 was good with energy weapons etc.

I've heard switching servers fixes that

I'm talking about pre nerf TSE guns you noid. The legendary vendor wasnt a thing then. Brainlet

Why add cards to do that, just add weight reduction to the riflemam per cards.
---
Step 1: Accept death
---
 Combat Knives are the bomb. They are fast and if you run up Martial Artist almost very fast. Add Legendary 40% Speed effect and they are ridiculously fast. Mine both get into the 250+ real quick and just destroy hordes of ghouls.
---
 They are fun. ;)
---
Noice...noice. MUTINY! Im captain now!
---
Thank you! I had been getting total crap, saved up 400 scrip to try my luck. Decided to go 3 star to get the shit show over with quickly. First role, furious, faster fire rate, faster reload max level lever. I about shit my pants, might not be the god role, but pretty good for me, a rifle build. So tried my luck again, 3 star, cause I’m feeling great from last one. Bam, executioners explosive with 250dr on reload. Again, not a god role, but pretty damn good for me.
---
Next two went back to shit, pressed my luck and got junkies assaultron head and then a junkies Gatling gun.

This was a much better experience than I had. Lol me at level 20 I got repeatedly killed by a level 173 and messaged that I should never claim workshops unless I'm "good" enough to keep them. I told him I wasn't aware of the pvp  element because I had never and was continually harrassed for 20 mins with messages about how resources shouldn't be wasted on noobs.
---
Hey out of curiosity, what are the specific location names where you’re hitting the high level enemies and getting smacked down?
---
All I want is a user creation SDK for quest building.  When looking at older online games, this was one, fundamental thing that allowed the game to exist  and be highly active for a very long time.  It also pulls a LOT of development need away from the Developer and just let the players play.
---
I'm often doing that because I like to drop bags of free stuff for shoppers. If I just drop the bag and don't emote or hover over them or etc, they'll often fast travel out without ever noticing the bag.
---
I see that too. I choose at least 10 2\* weapons every time and often I see 2-3 in a row with either the same prefix or major. Jumping servers probably isn't worth it because you have no idea what, if anything, will change if you do that.
---
Tried that, you wouldn’t believe how many people don’t realize what it is. One of my buddies said they thought it was some kind of mine.
---
Plus, too close and they try to open the door without triggering it, too far and it slams shut in their face
---
If we are on at the same time, I’m in. PSN: Duke_Silver13
---
Ive consistently got about 100 pounds to spare for junk without power armor. I will probably never get the backpack because of how tedious getting the camera and doing the Scout challenges is. The only reason I want it at all is so I can throw the Medic skin on the backpack for cosmetic putposes.
---
I’m hoping the leaked mailbox datamined camp items are a step in that direction.  If you need someone to anchor a world while you dump and grab best bet is to have 2 characters in position and know what you are doing.  There’s no risk free way to do this, but stability has been better for me at least as of late.
---
Right thumb stick not left my bad
---
XP glitch from the early days
---
No.  Just reduce weapon weights across the board.
---
You do realize that was like the first 4-5 months after launch right
---
Didn't even know about this! Thank you so much!
---
I believe this game has more quests than 3 and maybe new vegas
---
It is tedious. But you can never have too much space.
---
Also it is to be noticed that the amount shown in top left corner is not ‘always’ how much YOU actually sold. But how much of that ammo type the BUYER has on him/her. 
---
So he could actually just have bought 100 rounds and it would tell you a couple of thousands maybe in the top left corner. 
---
Makes it confusing as hell as well. But yeah with the bug I’ve seen someone explain pretty thoroughly it makes it even harder to tell
---
you sound like a bitch, bitch.
---
Bullyhunters 2: The Sequel
---
Pardon my pessimism
---
Sounds like you need to put a tip jar / area for people to drop brown bags cuz they're in loooooooove with your camp
---
Will do the same - i give an update if ive had success!
---
Harvesting ore or crazy overencumbered is the only time I break out the Excavator. Jetpack life with cal shocks will break you out of the Excavator rut.
---
Instigating, followed by Executioner's combat knives with swing speed for second * are wonderful.
---
You sound like a fucking asshole.
---
Sure. But quests are probably the game element with the longest lead time, particularly if you want them to be high quality. You need to write them, build levels, and do localization on a substantial amount of voice acting. Plus, to be satisfying they should ideally be quite long - particularly since a lot of stuff that would ordinarily be turned into small side quests are turned into repeatable content (e.g. events) in this style of game.
---
There is new quest content coming down the pipeline (the roadmap references a new main quest for fall 2019). Until then there are plenty of other games out there with great quest content to keep you occupied.
---
I would waste a perk card on that due to my handmade hoarding issue.
---
Well I suppose it’s good to know that it’s not just me? Guess I’ll start trying to sell my excess ammo On the marketplace instead.
---
Hans Olo.
---
Thank you so much! I love taking photos in real life, its so good to be able to do it on my fave game too!

My GPU is a Geforce GTX 1060 3Gb w/ OC and yes I always play on ultra :)

Share them too if you can :D

So true! I'm always looking out for a good shot

I wouldn't risk it for getting stuff to a mule I'd use an in game box instead.

---
So by accident you bought a map...
---
Try playing with 0fps
---
I never use melee and don’t run bloodied. I put it in my vendor for 5k just to see what would happen—being a limited time unique weapon and all—and it sold in the first hour. 
---
As the week goes on more and more people will have them, so demand could go down. Or up, seeing as it won’t be available again. It’s super easy to get though, so I imagine it’ll be pretty commonly found.
---
I would recommend you actually play the game and decide if it's worth it then
---
It's a Possum challenge under Miner... I had no idea how to trigger it to start... not sure how you discover it if you didn't buy a map... go figure...
---
The middle of the map is the Savage Divide which mob levels go up to 99. You are not in the right here. He has just as much right to run through White Springs as you do.
---
Hands down an awsome thing for you to do. I applaude you good sir!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Sort of related - could you shorten the animations for sitting or getting into bed as well?
---
Nope and others I know who have players get caught under their wooden floors don't have it near them.
---
I tried. 
---
Breaks the immersion for me. I’m sticking with my first
---
I’m so glad I’m not the only one who tries to gift my workshop sometimes when I log out! It seems like a waste not to! Does anyone else do that?
---
The reload speed for speed demon also doesn’t work half the time either 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
If you open the map it will give you a warning saying using this map... you click yes and it puts a spot / marker on your map
---
I bought all 5 within 30 minutes...
---
Yea as my dumbass finds joy running with hunters, executioner, exterminator, mutant slayer, ghoul slayer troubleshooter, Zealots handmade on me 😭
---
If I find my doors left open one more time, I'm putting Punji Boards by my door when I leave. BI
---
You can still go in to craft, just enjoy having tetanus!
---
The best way to get all the stuff we are all looking for is to just keep playing. Hit nuked zones. Hit up player vendors. Sell stuff. Buy stuff. There aren’t really any shortcuts. It’s called grinding for a reason.
---
Survival mode needs team based events (not the typical full FO76 quests) to pit 2-4 groups (12 vs 12 or 4 squads of 6) against each other to meet an objective, or team elimination.
---
Whats the best armor?
---
Depends on your build and play style.
---
The general concept of workshops is similar to settlements in FO 4.  
---
The idea isn't that you spend half your life traveling back there constantly for long boring fights (unless you really need that specific enemy for a challenge or etc.)   
---
The concept is that you figure out how to build / arrange defenses which will adequately kill most or all enemies, blueprint them, and then just drop them down when you arrive and go about your other regular activities. (Hence part of the point of the Home Defense perk)  
---
If you do it that way, you can either show up at the very last minute and tag one enemy to get all the event rewards without much effort... or you can just ignore the workshop and use it as a free FT point.   
---
(Unless you need resources from an extractor, in which case you'll need to return more often.)   
---
Also, I have a generic camp-style blueprint which I use for many workshops. It's a floating camp with decorations &amp; the usual handy items &amp; turrets. For lower level workshops, I can often just drop that down, climb into the bed, and then take a break to go to the bathroom or get a snack. When I return, I'm well rested. Then I  head downstairs to take out the one lingering / stuck enemy in the workshop. I need to take periodic breaks anyway, so it's nice to collect some rewards during them without putting in much effort.
---
cry about it
---
Half of what you said is literally what I already said (buggy, unstable, etc.). I even specifically pointed to FO4 bugs being present in FO76 and you felt the need to say it again? You're entitled to your opinion of course, but I thoroughly enjoyed the holotape-based storytelling of the game. It's certainly very different from previous games and it's not something I want for future titles, but for what it is I really enjoyed it. It's an interesting mechanic that forced Bethesda to get creative with their story telling (holotapes, terminals, bots, radio dramas, visual story telling, etc.) and it helped give the game a creepy vibe til the very end of the story.
---
True. True. I was determined to do all the grindy bidness, but then server hopped about 15 times trying to find the camera and then just gave up. Grinding isnt so bad, but I having to server hop.
---
Been wondering myself how to get hold of these for my hunters cabin but cant find any information other than the ones i know how to get. But while play tonight i got the bloodbug mount from doing the repeatable pioneer scouts quest at dolly sods! Still unsure if its just a random reward or if you get all of them from there!!
---
I think they are working on it via the terminal thing in the atom shop, cause in its description says "something something comunicate with wastelanders."
---
Another.
---
"I was here first" yikes you sound entitled there my dude
---
I’ve lost a lot of items that way. Good luck
---
Look at your post history dear. You're not exactly a well-liked person in any sense. Might want to look at that attitude of yours.
---
Nukacrypt has them
---
I think this is a great idea. The more voluntary options for PvP, the better, in my book.
---
You can also put a post out offering to pay to have it modded. It will cost you less and you’ll just need mats
---
The first 4-5 months also had game balancing and QOL changes like stash size, push to talk, FOV sliders, etc, etc. Regardless the game still has game breaking bugs like crashing while eating, players becoming invincible via exploits and many more. That and old bugs coming back is what is making the game less enjoyable for me and I'm sure many others. Bethesda needs to spend time to deal with these instead of adding more content that could potentially be adding more bugs. This way they'll have more time to fix the bugs with the new content instead of piling on the list of bugs.
---
Try the Colonels Monument! Where I got mine.. Good luck! Smoooth sailing after that. Just 6 pictures, easy swimming and some agility tests that are easier than the Fire Breather's.
---
Yeah Ive got the Athlete badge already. Just running into a road block now because almost all the other ones require a camera.
---
In BoS faction. Pretty much how we run things. Shoot first, ask later. Why? Cause trust got us in trouble one too many times.
---
I just asked here as I had the same problem. I never sue my mic for various reasons and I’ve helped multiple people. I jump of something they revive me then we go out separate ways. I would help but am on PS4 :/ someone will help!
---
Me neither, I got reply on 12/12/2018 saying I’d been approved and to allow 4-6 months... well its been 6 months now and  no bag :(
---
I felt bad about doing this once. I was trying to get to a BoS firebase with a Scorchbeast and high level Scorched chasing me through Cranberry Bog when I hear Vertibots and missiles exploding behind me because I accidentally got close to a camp and the owner viciously dropped the hammer on my pursuers with his defenses and a laser minigun.
---
It's going to be odd going back to a fallout 4 type game without other players.
---
If this post doesn't yield results just keep your eyes peeled for Encrypted to pop up. People always die in that pond and you can tick two challenges at once.
---
I think it would be hilarious if we were in a simulation. In D.C. Take me hooooome country rooooaaaads!
---
Claws benefit from both one-handed and unarmed perks. It’s been tested by others and myself - try it! :)
---
Heavy Leather is some of the best limb armor in my opinion especially for silo runs
---
you have 100 karma for each year you have been on reddit...... plus you are crying about a video game.
---
Ty for the kind words my friend
---
Flatwoods has a possum spawn near the cooking stations that I use. But yeah, tons of Brahmin as well.
---
I'm not much for survival, but I logged in, went to Flatwoods. Crafted a machete and looted a bottle of beer and waited until I was starving. Killed a Bramin (kill a critter while starving), took the meat to the tents to cook where I killed a ghoul that always spawns there (kill human like enemy with melee). I drank the beer and cooked the Brahmin meat (cook a meal while intoxicated). Before I left, I took meat from the hanging Radstag and ate it (eat raw meat). From there, I made my way up the river to the food plant. Took it over to complete the final challenge (capture a workshop while mutated). All in all, it took maybe 5 minutes.
---
I thought only the meat hook benefits from both
---
Honestly, though! 76 really is something...unique
---
I stuff all my extra plans in my Shop for free.
---
had same thing happened while ago but we were both closer to the same leve. So I switched from gauntlet to rifle and just tapped then in the legs and he finished them off..
---
It's called working together..
---
Try it ya might like it.
---
Only if the add an armor pen perk for handguns. Honest I would love if they added both rifles weigh too much and without armor pen pistols dont do anything against anything larger than a blood bug.
---
Damn,just logged off, sorry. If you have no luck tonight add me IGN and I’ll help you another day
---
The reason why you are a negative karma seeking troll is because you had no positive affection from family as a child and that's why you insist on getting attention in anyway you can.
---
Well, i think i wrongly "replied" since i replied to NotMercy and not you (i actually thumbsed you up).  
---
I guess i was just pissed at the people who are denying the shitty state Fallout 76 was and are now laughing at people who yelled at the game back in the day.   
---
Anyway, since you summarized, everything yourself, my intervention is indeed pretty useless, but couldn't stop myself from writing my own shit lol.  Gonna remove it after you saw my answer.
---
Oh, true. Scorchbeasts really are the bane of Camp existences, but I guess it comes with the territory. At least it got taken care of and there wasn't too much damage to his camp?
---
You have to submit 7600 Ballistic Fiber to a special vendor bot in order to be put on the list. Good luck.
---
I would indeed use a box vs a dropped loot bag. The server would have to crash or reset for the box to reset. No telling on the loot bag. Back before player vending myself and many others ive seen would go to the overseers camp and store plans/ammo/ect in the overseers stash and any random player, mainly lower lvls would quest and be taken straight to the overseers camp where they could loot the stash. Ive seen loot i put in there still there hours later.
---
For me it triggered when I walked up near the middle of the structure, by the open courtyard with the brazier. If it didn't trigger, the event might be on cooldown in your server
---
Holy shit. You own the game. Just fucking reinstall it and find out for yourself.
---
I spaced. Thanks, edited. Sheesh
---
no, youre just a sensitive flower who takes words on the internet to heart. i can smell your vagina through my phine screen.
---
If you sell it in 1 or 2 hour then you have set the good price. Usually people which spent more than 1k for one item is rare so for an item lvl 35...
---
I think around 500 caps it is a good price.
---
They are a post yesterday on reddit which provides some tips to sell items. It is a must to read
---
Correct. We at the BoS are basically Globo Gym; we're better than you,  and we know it! XD
---
Aww :)
---
**Do not** use a bag. Find a quiet location and stash it in a world container.
---
The people that make the new content aren't the same people that fix bugs. Both can happen simultaneously, bug fixing is just a longer process. New content requires new models, textures, etc, but a bug fix requires isolating the bug, the source of the bug, fixing it, and then testing to ensure it doesn't create new bugs. In a game with a few dozen thousand lines of code, thats not an easy thing
---
That insult? Yes, yes it did
---
I got them at train station vendor at top of world. Think i did sack hood and a clothing that said raider.
---
In Appalachia, once you've found both the Ennui and the Egress, you may be done.
---
I need to give solo nuking a try... kinda intimidated but it’s a game (reminder to self).
---
Animals?
---
Road leathers and sack hood
---
I decided to keep mine, not a melee player at all but the damage it does without any perks is good enough to save me some ammo.
---
Not true...
---
 ***spoiler***
---
If you did the responders questline, you create the vaccine and broadcast for any survivors to come get vaccinated. Thus you only need to deal with preexisting scorched or those not vaccinated.
---
Good directions. To be clear to others, there is a camp at the fossils, with a campfire and tent. It also had three low level scorched for me as well.
---

Switching focus and hiring some additional temp coders to fix bugs would be appreciated.
---
Paddle ball or commie whacker.
---
I’m down to two now. When I had my Gatling gun hoarding issue, Bear Arms made it very manageable.
---
Yeah I thinks it's fine like that, at least for the current ruleset. However I do believe that there should be some aid item or device that can help locate players better. say a device that beeps when a player gets near and isn't crouched or camouflaged. it would encourage stealth builds whilst also offering a way to locate players better without straight up revealing them.
---

---
You have some great shots too! I wish I could take photos of my character as good as you take of yours, for now I'll just stick with landscapes x) 
---
I never photoshoped my pics since I play a lot with brightness &amp; contrast/saturation and filters in game
---
Yeah, I thought so lol.
---
Yep, you gotta walk kinda deep in there.
---
I don't bother with doors.
---
As a matter of fact, I am good. I just don’t see the point of bringing up skill in a post about robot companions. Don’t assume a person is bad just because of a wish.
---
Perfect thanks!
---
Reminds me a little of how I wish there was an option for whether you want bulk to be used in crafting. Like I happen to have 40+ bulk plastic in my inventory (it's kind of a long story) and tend to have a lot of free plastic on me as well. When I go to craft bulk units of other scrap types, it seems to choose which plastic it uses at random. It would be cool if there was a toggle for "don't consume bulk scrap to craft unless there isn't enough non-bulk scrap available."
---
No problem, top right side there is a key to narrow location types.
---
And another.
---
I would definitely recommend waiting for a while. Right now, your only audience is people unwilling to go into survival mode to get the weapon. Later, it will be anybody who missed it or decided they want it. I've personally been scouting around for weapons like the quick fix that I missed and could never find any in player stores.
---
Where do you find road leathers?
---
I'll die for ya after work, unfortunately I'm not sure when I'll get home. Somebody else may come along before then anyways :)
---
Hmm...maybe if the rules changes a bit. currently survival is only to kill eachothers and get better exp. I don't believe their is in incentive for the leader board to be honest....does it give any special items or bonuses if your top 3? I don't think it does.
---
Look for a place there are heaps of legendary enemies. Make that a daily go to grind and incorporate that with other grinding spots, so every time u log on u have a routine of grinding legendarys. Trade them into legendary machines everyday for scripts.
---
I mean I like balance most of all like fallout rn isn't BAD but it could be better if it was balanced I'd have more motivation to hop back in and grind after doing a few quests
---
When I started playing the game for the first time I had no idea what was going on. Two guys started slapping to get my attention me then pointing to the ground.
---
I had never played an online game before and thought they were challenging me to a fight so I slowly backed away and ran to the overseers camp where they ganged up on me again I tried to ignore their slapping and pointing while I was trying to get the handle on the controls and learn about the pip boy, meanwhile they are still punching and pointing. Clueless I ignored them as best I could.
---
I no longer try to give anything to people fresh from the vault. I wait until I see a level 10 and dump whatever I don't want on them.
---
You dont seem to understand. That's not going to happen. Sure theyll patch things here and there, but no big month of patching. Content needs to come out now. The game has been out, and people need content to play otherwise they'll just leave. This game already has numerous problems and they have limited man power. Content is the main problem out of everything. No content means no players. That's why everyone bailed after like a month, there was no end game shit to do.
---
Scan the map for low level players. Follow them around until they get themselves killed. Revive them.
---
Sorted.
---
A very polite raider. Might be a Canadian.
---
Wouldn't that also technically be losing as only Scorched (and Feral Ghouls, and Mole rats, and Robobrains, and etc) would be left, with no humans to stand against them?
---
Legendary drops and whatever the seller decides, 2k+
---
that would be epic!
---
Por que no los dos?
---
I hope they add apparel from fallout 3, especially the raider armor. Hell, that would be something worth to put in the atomic shop
---
If you get lucky by trading. Im selling one for 5k caps on xbox. They used to be worth a lot more before.
---
Your best bet is the market sub. Depending on the day you could get one for around 5k. Otherwise grind &amp; pray to RNGsus.
---
No u
---
&gt; 4 gave me the diversion of building massive settlements
---
Moving the goalposts.  You said:
---
&gt; Raise your hand if you prefer quests vs grinding, challenges, achievements, and events.
---
No mention of settlements.
