You're not alone, I stopped bothering with workshops for exactly that reason.
---
---
---
Hopefully we hear something soon.
---
You're the one who's ridiculous, because you're  claiming that you're not worrying over anything, and yet the proof of such is demonstrated by your taking the time to write such a lengthy response to my post. If you hadn't been worried then you would have done the sane thing and just ignored it and moved on, kind of like I'm doing with you now.
---
Yeah I mean might be nice but as long as they aren’t identical enemies and they change it every now and then/ random for each run I’d be cool with it.
---
Same
---
They have five demands.  That is only one of them
---
Where did you find the case?
---
Pvp isn't the same
---
Ive got a level 25 junkies ffr combat rifle ill sell
---
Soy infused?  Isn't that the insult /r/Sino throws at Westerners?
---
It basically boils down to workshops = target for PVP.
---

---
Since you cant turn off PVP in workshops (pacifist only prevents you from dealing damage), its best to stay away.
---
Or get in, set up resouces, and get out.  Building defenses is too much time wasted, just get your extractors set up and jet.
---
You don’t have to pvp if you don’t want to and it’s only unbalanced because you’re not built for it .
---
i have a lvl 40, 3 star troubleshooters death tambo that i love. it's got faster swing speed and plus 1 agility and it's still holding its own at lvl 90. it's not my primary, but it makes a great secondary option and weighs next to nothing to carry around. i tend to use it when I'm in lower level areas to save bullets i don't need to spend on sub-lvl 35 enemies.
---
Haha you said you were done, stop no life replying becuase you can't stand to not have the last word lmao
---
You have no logic at all, I don't have to worry over anything to write anything, I do what I want, and I want to show you you are ridiculous, that's it.
---
And if you are ignoring me you don't have to type all these, see how your logic backfires?
---
Huh. I just don't remember seeing it before.
---
Well, at least it isn't yellow :-P
---
At level 60 my build was slamming level 200s, its very easy to have a very capable build at lower levels
---
Oh ho, what's this I see... you said the word "also"? So, then you _are_ acknowledging that &gt;Atom Shop&lt; items can be used in Nuclear Winter? I'm not quite sure, since you didn't _actually_ admit that you were incorrect.
---
I know, it's just they are similar is a way.
---
Imagine Sierra Madre without losing all your shit, it would be ezpz.
---
I think in the end they should just give us it since the random 3 star sale was put off
---
There has been several times I've asked other players for help, they usually help and in my case refused pay.
---
There adding the underminer to the game? Awesome!
---
Lol none of us "raiders" are rocking tse
---
Dont want to be mean but this is why you dont build around whitesprings, at least in the area that is commonly nuked.
---
You must have a tough life if a couple of PVP players is enough to make you quit. Let's kick out all the PVPers so you can have your safe space. How dare they PVP you in the small 10% of the map dedicated to them.
---
If you want to build, build your CAMP. That is your safe space. Sell things at a vendor or do events for friendly interaction.
---
Yea it's a bit crazy , hangout at whitesprings station for an hour and somebody is GARUNTEED to shoot you in the face until you leave or hop severs and for Christ sake don't take the ammo factory or your practically begging for an asshole to trot along and fuck up your day
---
It's an overall problem with the "balance" of the game. They keep saying a change is coming but I have a feeling it's just some sort of PVP balance.
---
Thanks I will check when I get off work to see if I have the auto price reciever plan if not I might hit you up for some help
---
I claim workshops all the time and haven't been ganked.  I've been killed but I knew the risks.  It doesn't bother me much because what else are pvpers supposed to do?  I understand there is NW but I from what I hear that's gotten old.  I still think Bethseda should add an arena for pvp in adventure mode.  Goes with the raider style.
---
How so?   Didn't you have to go kill brown people to be English middle class?   As an Irish descendant, I find it pretty laughable to compare English middle class to American middle class.  We literally left by the millions to get out of that oppressive abusive system.
---
I've only encountered it about 8-10 times probably since the update rolled out, and I get excited for it so I could maybe level up my alt like I used to my main, but it isnt viable anymore. Every high level player shows up and rushes it for the 1 legendary at the end, when they could be making out with more. (I'm not enjoying the public event system either. Some servers there isn't a public event the whole time I'm on it, and then the next server I'm on there's literally an event back-to-back-to-back)
---
But it isnt that rare to join a server and see whitesprings nuked...
---
No it's an insult calling you a pathetic soyboy
---
Imagine thinking China is still communist
---
If I recall correctly a certain craftable alcohol has incendiary effects too.
---
Yay! Somebody understands the secret to that event! I'm totally with you! I dont even bother going anymore.
---
It's possible it either glitched out (I've watched mine as recently as yesterday glitch out) or, someone saw it and grabbed it before you spawned up.  I have noticed that if you're doing a certain kind of mission, that your loot doesn't always drop but you also don't lose it from your inventory.
---
You should ALWAYS assume that when you die you drop loot, so it's best to always make your way back there and find it.
---
Right? I mean expected/I wanted the 1/4 turf one to have a golf tee on it.
---
I'm putting my comment in the pool for someone who has wanted this since they've started playing.
---
Why do so many epic gamers think liberty prime is saying things they should agree with
---
Its a rare instance at the moment since most nukes are headed for Fissure Prime but people fairly often nuke whitesprings  for endgame material farming and exp. If there is even the slightest issue with the Scorched Earth event next patch your base will probably be perpetually nuked.
---
Normally do, but I like the quest marker to help me to find it easier though, with the mission missing, I don't have that.
---
Currently, yes
---
they need to make the PVP warning for claiming a workshop more obvious
---
I don't and I don't think anyone else does either, that's why I started the comment off with "I'm confused".
---
I don't even have a vault in my area to run too! Or any bunkers nearby, so I'm going to assume I'm going to be a part of the pre war people to die from the bombs :(
---
Every time it has and I was up there it gave me some disease...lol
---
I agree, it’s completely absurd—which is why every single player uses free Atoms to offset the cost of their purchases. No rational human being is spending real world money for anywhere close to all of their Atom Shop purchases. 
---
Why wouldn’t you use your free Atoms? The game practically throws them at you. If you’re only purchasing a single item there’s no way that you wouldn’t have a bunch banked to use towards it—unless you’ve already burned them on other things, in which case, that was your choice.
---
I was going to, but I was cleaning out my inventory and just wanted to get rid of the meat week stuff. Now all I have left is bloodied chef hats, 2 grill masters hats, and 3 tenderizers to get rid of
---
I server hop quite frequently in my farm for rare outfits westtek runs an events. I've only seem to find Tea Time an Distinguished Guest an Dogwood Die Off an the occasional Uranium Fever an Guided Meditation. Theres so many I've litterally only seen one time since the change. Makes farming the more elusive items terrible.
---
I always have a 10mm pistol an tesla I use at events for single tagging mobs so everyone gets a hit. I definitely feel you on people 1 shotting stuff I could if I wanted with my Bloodied build bit I never use my Handmade at events. I try to invite people to grps but normally people dont join. I dont blame them because griefing nonsense but it does help with tagging. 
---
Funny story some ass hat was 1 tapping the legendary at uranium fever event. So everyone else there ended up killing him. He had his passive off with the shocking mutation so his pvp was proced easily. Was hilarious to watch him keep getting downed. He never figured it out..
---
There is a couple in the Mire. Just follow the lines and you should find one.
---
Maybe make it a survival dungeon of sorts where you start with nothing and have to restart if you wipe. But make the rewards worth it.
---
How do u get the BoS paint???
---
Lol same here, now it just confuses me with my 2 characters because when I'm switching it'll say it's loading my 127, but I'm actually loading into my 44, and vice versa. I always think I might have pressed the wrong guy
---
Depends what you're looking for, DR, ER or both.
---
Scout when modified with polymer has more DR on the arms and legs than BOS heavy combat, but less ER.
---
The BOS heavy chest still edges out polymer Scout in both DR and ER though.
---
I'm currently running a full set of polymer Scout on two different toons (Urban and Forest) and like the look of it as an exposed set, so I give up some DR/ER on the chest in lieu of esthetics. To be honest though, once you reach a certain level the difference is minimal enough to not care in PVE.
---
One shot weapons that can only do 110 damage max will never deplete 325 hp. 1 shot x 110 = 110.
---
Not sure why you think a handmade fires 7.5 rounds per second either. I have a FFR handmade that doesn't empty a clip in under 4 seconds.
---
Always remain sneaking while at a workshop (sneaking hides you from the world map). Ignore NPC "Defend" events. NPC AI isn't processed when no players are around, so no damage will be done to your workshop objects. The "Defend" event will eventually time out, and be replaced by a private "Retake" quest, which provides the same rewards (and won't be broadcast on the world map).
---
Don't build up a workshop, as they're not safe at all (not safe from PVP, and not safe from the even more common *server disconnects*). Build at your own CAMP.
---
I've been taking out scorchbeasts and their hordes left and right. we better make it, I've got nearly max scrip saved up in preparation.
---
They are already doing this with the daily challenges. Some are as easy as pressing a few buttons.
---
Doing the Forbidden Knowledge quest (dropping off technical data at Camp Venture). It is RNG and needs to be repeated A LOT to get all of the plans. 
---
Are you on PC? Part of a BOS group?
---
I am
---
I just started my alt Durning meat week, and I'm already at max script. Yeah, I moved a few things over from my main, but not really alot. I'm already considering making a new alt just for legendary script and leveling it later on. Or having him as a pack mule for everything that's weighting my mains stash down.
---
1000 script total is too low too. Like, I do kinda get it. But on the other hand, I made my alt Durning meat week and he's level 44 now, and almost have max script. Given, yes, I'm going to blow it all on the sale and script everything that isn't good enough for me, but it's going to be the cycle all over again
---
Nicely done
---
Wish I had your optimism. I expect about 45 minutes of new content, some mediocre fetch quests and a broken state of release.
---
The "Unyielding" prefix appears on all armor with that attribute, regardless of second or third stars as far as I know.
---
As the name states, your armor gains SPeCIAL (no Endurance) +1, +2 or +3 to each as your health goes down. So, as your health diminishes, the armor does not yield, but rather improves its stats, "Unyielding" as it were.

I could go for a neon sign counter that we could hang at our CAMPs.  Show everyone how we dont have lives by the number of days on our counter.  "Username has 300 consecutive logins"
---
See, the problem is, I'm eyeing other games now that I have 2 characters, but the fear of missing out is messing with me heavily and I cant even pick up another game. With that said, I've been so excited for Outer World's to release except for the fact the Halloween event is taking place basically Durning the release, with wastelanders afterward, so I might not even get to play outer world's for alittle bit saddly. Plus, I'm so used to this games controls and how my controls are set up (Y being reload is one of them, when I play something like Destiny 2 I keep press Y and switching weapons instead, along with trying to use Vats in every other game I try to play)
---
That’s bolstering
---
I like to get stuff on my own but thx tho
---
All the info I get are from this sub, and Juicehead. So I try to make sure I scroll this sub once a day at least to make sure I'm not missing something new
---
Welcome to Appalachia
---
What about berserker with a set of broken armor?
---
*throaty gasp*
---
Its not that we need more caves... you just gotta know how to make your own HEH &gt;:)
---
Or a flip board like they have at the train stations displaying a subset of the stats they already track as Challenges. Hours played, kills in PVP or PVE, etc.
---
Once you get some power armor you should be good to handle things even if they are lv50
---
oh thank god I thought this was just me haha. its soo annoying.. makes me want to not even bother doing the queen. have to shut down the game and restart as its the only way it stops.. especially annoying if i have a couple workbench running to farm mats :(
---
Hell yeah, that would be even better.
---
This is an excellent idea. I feel like there are an infinite number of things they could offer that would not only be incentive for people to log on, but would also be an excellent bonus to those of us who play every day.
---
Wow, the douche comment comes with free DLC!  Fuck yea!

Narrow your gun choices first. You're going to end up having watered-down perks that leave you with a bunch of half-assed weapons. Focus your build around one weapon type, then throw everything into that weapon and the other perks that enhance your play style.
---
Aye, no problem at all!
---
Good to know. May explore slightly further away
---
Find someone who has all of the Serum recipes and buy some.

Honestly, there's a lot of things I want from ESO to be in fo76. One major one is the A button (on Xbox). I say this because you can jump with A, AND you can pick things up with the A button and would make it so I didn't have to remap some things. The others are only minor things like switching skills (perk loadouts coming soonish baybeee) ESO is a really fun game. I go back to it sometimes. I haven't since I got into 76, but it sits there every day before i load up 76. The story is pretty damn good. I'm hoping fo76 takes the same turn as ESO. I recommend it to everyone still
---
Guess I'm lucky then. My important bases are pretty inaccessible too.
---
Nah, we say that around here too. Sometimes spell it with a W though. It's probably just the dialect of English you were taught.
---
Thank you!
---
You got downvoted by people who tried to run the raid with a scoped lever action rifle and a brand new level 35 excavator PA set. I guarantee it.
---
The people on this subreddit are missing out so bad yet they continue the circlejerk. Their loss I guess :)
---
You mean you dont like getting 1* nocturnal pole hooks from lvl 68 glowing 3* monsters?
---
Yea without that quest marker it’s a bitch to find
---
I mean getting a 1* zealots pitchfork from the scorchbeast queen was a humbling experience so I’m sure I’ll miss it :(
---
Hodge podge, I’ve been everywhere. Kind of like German, if you go to a different state, sometimes your dialect is unintelligible lol.
---
The fact that you call the enemies 'bullet sponges' shows that you really are undergeared. You should be ignoring them, or 1shotting them if they block your way.  Improve, and try again later.
---
Maybe a special announcement from the Grafton Mayor?
---
Omfg I'm glad I looked into that mutation when I was starting out with them. I'm also a bloodied build and I just take out my regular gun to get some taps in but lately I've had to take my handmade out to steal kills. I feel bad, but usually my handmade is a 2 hit kill so il atleast get a tag in on SOMETHING. Or il lay out landmines so I get some sort of damage. 
---
Since the public event system took out I've seen Tea Time the MOST times out of any other event and it's frustrating because it's basically a..low level event. And even with project pharma, sometimes no one will go there and I cant do that whole event by myself, so it's a wasted opportunity to get a bear arm plan, which is the one plan I really want that I have left for legendary rolls.
---
Follow the road NW from Sunshine Meadows.
---
I like how some FPS games have some stats displayed on user profiles.  I just now realized we dont have this for FO76.  I think it would be really neat if somehow we could have a counter, billboard or something at our camps showing just some basic stuff.  Fav wpn, deaths, types of kills, stuff like that I think would be swell.
---
This has _absolutely nothing_ to do with my OP, because I was speaking about Atoms for the Atom Shop, not about items native to any particular game mode.
---
They won’t for essentially the same reason they made the level up atom challenge such a nuisance
---
They need to vote. We need to handle our own shit. My points still stands. If I kill someone in China and go to HK, China can't extradite me. Vice versa, if a crime is committed in HK and they flee to China, HK can't extradite. That doesn't work. Can we all agree on that? I really hope so. That needed to be fixed. Can we agree that China could abuse the fuck out of this ? YES. I don't think anyone is naïve about Chinas power abuses past or present. So the law was thrown out and they've still got this major problem of extradition laws. Isn't the only reason they tried getting this done, because it's letting rapists and murderers walk around freely? It seems like blowing this out of control benefits many countries agendas. Personally, I say fuck China but I understand that my online social media criticism means fuck all to them and does nothing to help anyone. As for demands, they gonna demand China supply them with a new military and the budget for defense ? There are serious ramifications for independence. Loss of protections, loss of financial backing and bailout, the sharing of resources would cease. Someone is thinking about that I bet. It's probably why there aren't hundreds of HK politicians marching and calling for votes.
---
Yeah the sheep sheepsquatch an pharma events need to be preplanned. I've never had anyone that understands show up or anyone at all. I had to buy my plans for the fixer. Still have never completed either event successfully. I can do a ton of dmg but I can't tank everything as bloodied. An the pharma event isnt possible to solo at all.
---
Any in the centre of the map?
---
It’s this way with all events, sadly.  
---
Doing a horde event today and a guy one shots the boss.  Campfire tales, guy with bloodied plasma Gatling just hogging it all.  Uranium Fever, same crap all the way through.  
---
I don’t really like to do events anymore.
---
Lmao amen to that. It would be different if 1 star enemy's could drop 3*weapons. What's the point of having different star tiers of enemy's. Just make them "legendary" monsters with a chance of 1-3* drops. It would make everyone stop complaining.
---
I don't see a lot of reason to be pessimistic. Bethesda has a good track record with story DLCs. Of course I also expect bugs, delays, and some controversial design decision that makes this sub unusable for a week. But assuming Wastelanders "will only be 45 minutes" and that it will completely suck seems less grounded in reality than my pragmatic optimism.
---
When did that ever happen?
---
Thing is that naw is like, chill bro, and nah is not even a problem ma’am.
---
bro 😎💪
---
*sigh*
---
what?
---
I can't comment on sound as I play on mute....
---
As for things to do (in NW anyway) find spawns of Orange Crates! Don't just spawn, loot, hide, run in front of fire, hide, loot, etc. In the new Morgantown Map I've found a couple of different routes that usually gives me 4 Orange Crates before I meet up with my team, let alone everything in between.
---
Another thing to do, go in Suicide Solo. The sole reason for this is to get better, you *want* to run into people; you *want* to run more than crouch, you *want* to kill. Over the course of 2 weeks I went from a level 7 to a now 39.
---
Not every match is great, but once you just accept your death before you spawn - it makes every match a lot more fun.
---
As for Adventure.... Can't comment - got bored and started doing NW until Wastelanders comes out.
---
I don’t remember when they changed it since I took a break about two months after release, but I remember the early days when 3 stars always dropped 3, 2 always dropped 2, and 1 always dropped 1
---
Awful idea that makes no sense. They give you more than enough atoms for free via challenges. If you logged in every day for a year you would have almost 2k atoms (plus whatever you get from challenges). The whole point of atoms is to make Bethesda money and support the continuation and development of the game while preventing subscription fees. If everything is free how will Bethesda make money? Premium DLC/expansion packs? Sub fees? Also, instead of atoms as an incentive to log in how about more and improved content?
---
I've learned to just not even try with workshops. Someone was selling a Bloodied explosive Lazer rifle, so I joined him. He messaged me and said he needed my help taking over Tyler county, I said alright, sounds good. Anything for that rifle. And I should have known it was fishy from that point. He got me to claim the workshop, and as soon as I did he killed me with it and messaged me "how did you like the rifle". That just pissed me off.
---
Not that I seen. I followed a bunch around for awhile.
---
Wow you're so cool I wish I could be as cool as you are
---
Probably because every dlc they've added to fallout 76 has been a massive disappointment. Around 20-30 minutes of content at best and quests that are hard to even call quests. If you stacked up all they added since launch it wouldn't take much more than a hour or so to run through.
---
I never remember them dropping right. Ive been here since beta lol
---
Haha I've been on board since the last person told me and I've been trying to spread the word but everyone wants to rush it. It just.. doesn't make sense to rush it. It's a 30 min event, and getting it done in 5 minutes means you're just cheating yourself out of xp and legendaries. And cheating me out of them..
---
At least someone gets it. This subreddit seems like bunch of morons (based off what gets upvoted the most such as this post)
---
GOLLUM!
---
Really? I’ve also been since beta and my friends and I all say we remember when 3s always dropped 3s etc.. hmm maybe I’m misremembering? Regardless I’d prefer it if the star indicated the drop, even if random 3 stars in the wild have to be toned down in frequency a bit
---
Nope, fuck that guy!
---
Ja, ich spreche ein bischen texasdeutch and the little German sayings I grew up with make 0 sense to a German speaker, but the old folks around here can eventually get a conversation going, though the Germans say it is sometimes hard to understand them.
---
Exactly, this is a pretty good example!
---
Emmm... Maybe I did not say it clearly. I mean HKers discriminate Mainlanders. He felt HKers are friendly purely because he is not a mainlander. I am from China Mainland. I saw the dramatic change of HK waitress's attitude when I stopped speaking Mandarin and used English.
---
Stopped doing this event.  It was so much better when nobody did it and i could toggle the jukebox on and off and keep it going and farm legendaries indefinitely.  Q.Q
---
So sad man..
---
Don't let this distract you from the fact that the curator at Prickett's Fort excavated a civil war soldier's remains. He's asked that you give the body a burial in Philippi Battlefield Cemetery.
---
Had this happen to me it was my only friend who played and talked to me on fallout 76 because bugthesda deleted his bloodied explosive Gatling plasma and half of his stash box so now just play alone 🥺
---
Is there any lore about Hong Kong in fallout?
---
I believe it stops at lvl 15 my bloodie build still gets it but my main 111 dosent.
---
I can be your friend. Unless you start locking your water purifiers. That's a Dick move. People need hydration.

---
I do think they could change the workshop mechanics so that building in them is actually feasible. I only build up things for fusion cores and that is quick and I’m gone.  If there were ways to save progress of builds at certain workshops, it would be kind of cool to build up some elaborate defenses and use that in pvp. As it stands now the building aspect of workshops is really lacking.  They could just as easily make a mode where you just have an arena area that auto enables pvp, which might be cool too.
---
Cuckold medal comes to mind.
---
Idk what everyone is talking about. Im level 30 and i take over hella benches. Ie posiedon plant, junkyards, etc. Sometimes all in one server. Ive been killed less than 1 percent of the time. Heres how to claim workbenches without dying for dummies:
---
Get in and get tf out ie build what you need quickly and leave. You dont need turrets. 
---
Crouch if you need to
---
Keep an eye on the map at all times
---
Stay near the border if you can so you can leave quick if someone shows up
---
DO NOT HANG OUT IN YOUR WORKSHOP (when i first started i would, still never died but now i dont even want to risk it plus theres no point in hanging out there)
---
Fast travel close by and then make ur way over
---
If someone contests that is higher level let them. They might not even take it just trying to get you to fight when they leave you can take it back. Be careful tho if they do take it and are still on the world
---
Get in and get tf out
---
I’d like to see that too, but it’s never been the case. It’s always been RNG, the more stars on the enemy. the more stars could possibly be on the item.
---
This is so sad
---

They do already when you go to claim a workshop, thats about as obvious as it gets
---
But what can you do about it 😫
---
Lmaoo I see what you mean. Make them temporarily essential and bulletproof or just make the area a "safe zone" where weapons can't be enabled.
---
They don't bother updating the tracker on weekends either so we're gonna be flying blind most of the remaining time. Not being able to see your effort paying off is demotivating to a lot of people. I'm gonna go hard but I have my doubts.

Will the "exclusive themed rewards" be based on what costume you're wearing?  Or do we just get them because we're wearing a costume at all?

I wanna know if scorchbeasts will be able to turn human npc's into scorched with that one attack.  I also want to know how npc's will react to nuke launches, either by being nuked or hearing it drop across the map if they'll be like "What the hell was that, an earthquake?"  I also hope we can loot outfits off of them, some of the ones in concept art looked cool as hell!

I was on a server where EVERYONE rushed to do the event, with one person playing the instrument (refusing to stop) and everyone else kept killing everything-- I couldn't even get a single tag in. It was so frustrating and really made me disappointed in the game in a way I've never felt before.
---
maybe for 76 days in a row.

I'm so excited to use a bow! I know it sounds super lame but if a game gives me the option to use a bow, you better believe I'm taking it.

No, it's a set amount per SB. My camp is right in the centre of Cranberry Bog, so fighting SBs is trivial to my Bloodied heavy gunner and it's a good way to kill scorched humans
---
I want to see 100 glowing mole rats with some kinda hord boss when you nuke mount blair.
---
I have the heavy chest plan in my vendor for 2k
---
Oh my. This conversation is becoming a confrontation.
---
As long as it's on disney+ and has those guys from nuka break in it, I'm ok with it. And Tom Servo.
---
Thanks, that worked this time now Bethesda Launcher doesn't matter, less steps too :)
---
Something something armor pen?
---
Running any perks for it? mags?
---
What about the scorched beasts in nuclear winter.. Pretty sure those are scorched..
---
Done
---
With Survival gone and NW being full of cheaters - contesting workshops is the new PvP. 
---
I would suggest avoiding workshops completely if you don't want to engage. People can even initiate PvP if you are in the zone of an unclaimed workshop.
---
Yes, that issue was fixed in [Patch 11](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6XdkW9ENbXzmFb0qDadc4D/fallout-76-patch-11-notes-july-16-2019).
---
You got insanely luckly - the dense combat mod plan drop rate 
---
 from Scorchbeasts is *astronomically* low.  If it's a "boss" version with a crown symbol in the name, it has a 10% chance for a random armor mod plan.  The dense plan is 1 of only 3 armor mods tied to corpses/certain other containers in Cranberry Bog, and if the roll lands on that plan, it still has another 97% chance of not dropping!
---
Huh. Did you server hop and see if they were there again? Because if so this could be something
---
a fine figure of a man!
---
Make new friends!! Check us out if you're on PC. 
---
I have you added on xbox bc I saw you were selling at your shop the plans were like 50 caps or something. Is that you
---
Sorry I'm on Xbox but would love to play with you guys
---
How can i get fusion cores at my camp?
---
There isn't even much PvP to balance unless it's the legacy weapons. They said they were going to change the cool down time, or that they did change it, and if they did I haven't noticed anything
---
Do you have a group on xbox
---
Yeah. A few weeks ago I cleared out all of my duplicate plans at 5c a piece
---
I did. I tried to reproduce it but could not. At least not yet.
---
Ahh. Yeah I saw you when I was looking in my freinds list
---
There's some good guys out there. I'll join some events where people will save the legendary and do the follow emote, and I do the same, which is a really nice gesture. But that isn't happening as much as the one shot people who seem to be popping out the walls lately
---
I just read that in the patch notes yesterday morning.  I made a terminal last night and powered through the quest in an hour.
---
I hardly ever use the launcher anymore. It may be needed to install new Bethesda updates to the game though? Not sure.
---
Switches???? WE NEED BUTTONS!!!!!!!
---
No more using the "foot switch" for timed door opener.
---
I was wondering the same thing. It happened to me last night.
---
It’s happened to me twice in the last hour
---
That was my whole plan too. Just get it half way at least and wait out the rest of the event and farm the legendaries. In it's prime, I used to get 7 from ghouls, plus the boss at the end. But lately it's maybe one, and not the boss because someone already killed it when it popped out. I wish more knew to farm it, and if I had a mic id be telling them also. I'm glad the one player stopped and messaged me and invited me to a group.
---
It is part of an event that you do to obtain the prototype hazmat suit I believe or it could just be part of the free states storyline
---
Sure I’ll take anything! Haha
---
See! Not all your friends quit!
---
*Quest not rvent
---
Same here, except instead of one person, it was 5 people playing something plus juke box, so the event was almost over by the time I got there and got 1 kill in. It's frustrating and saddening. That used to be my go-to to level up, now it's everyone's go to to rush
---
*event woops
---
I would like to play with you but have not yet
---
You have to do a certain amount of damage to her before you earn any rewards like the xp, fluxes, and body loot. I think it's around 2,000 damage you have to get or something like that.
---
Double dip with pipe guns........Wait, TRIPLE dip with explosive pipe guns!!!
---
Grinding is a possibility, but I don't think it was planned like that. Most of the time, unless you were farming the event, you would arrive with just five minutes before failing. Lots of people just do it for fun, no need to farm legendaries. I sit down and play the guitar, because that's the spirit of the event: music and ghouls.
---
I know but I’m not getting enough time to do the required damage
---
Weapons, I will pick an area that is close to a vendor and there are a lot of enemies, Weltch works well.  Go through kill all the mole miners and sell the weapons.  At lower levels the airport by Morgan town can be used the same way.  I stay close to a vendor because I am going to be over the carry weight limit and can slow walk back if need be.  Grafton works well too!
---
Also there is a perk card in charisma that will make the vendors pay you higher prices. 
---
Chems sell well and if you bulk your junk items you can sell them.
---
More cave camp locations would be nice.
---
[deleted]
---
Too cute &lt;3
---
Finally more quests to do.
---
Then that's why you're not getting loot...
---
I noticed this yesterday as well! I was walking around Clarksburg doing Mr Messenger and when I turned around 5 max level behemoths were behind me.
---
I know but what I’m asking is why is she dying within a minute?
---
My guess is it's a bunch of bloodied and junkies builds all running their try hard weapons. I run a bloodied commando build using my bloodied faster fire rate less vats handmade and I get to about 350 damage per shot but that only puts put about 100 per shot.
---
Probably collect 5 cans of paint laying around the event area, go to wall press the activate and watch it slowly fade in and appear on the wall as an art design, progress toward mischief level increased no go find the forks and go activate them in the specified areas of the lawn
---
Yeah I see that I just replied again with a different comment. Read your post wrong.
---
The same shit happened to me last night. I mean i got the plans and other stuff but no Legendary was like WTF.
---
It's apples and oranges. ESO is fully fleshed out and found its footing. Fo76 is still a baby trying to find what works. It has a long way to go.

Get better build and guns 🤷🏻‍♀️ can’t expect people to Ake you if you did enough damage or not. Me and my team Tun daily queens. Soon as she lands we kill it, stash flux, head back down for the next. 3 queens dead in 30-45min tops. Then encrypted. Hop server, do it all over again
---
I get lock ups when opening world map, but I actually get less crashes
---
No
---
technically you become a general in the military, which makes you an officer in the Enclave and grants you access to the upper echelons of the Enclave, after all you get an Enclave Officer uniform, not a general's uniform
---
I make approximately 100-200 atoms weekly due to my inability to play any amount of real game time by the time I’m able to finish a single daily it’s time for me to get off and go to work/ 1 out of 3 kids needs me or is tired of me playing already, or I need to do a multitude of other inane chores/activities that I just don’t have time to really even do much more than A part of a quest or 1 event/challenge if I’m lucky and am not already tied up with something else.
---
Love that there will be another new community event!
---
I would like to suggest that next year, instead of another meat week, we have a proper Octoberfest!
---
Biv would be a great host!
---
Just a thought.
---
I’m working on a bloodied commando build at the moment, I’m about half way done with it and my handmade does 79 damage
---
If you’re an actual sniper build only remove the shotgun and automatic perks. Waste of points as they don’t boost sniper dmg. Rifleman is what you want all of.
---
they could have sent out one or more recon teams that could have grown in ranks and then make a triumphant return to Appalachia
---
Yeah I can get that side too. But lately, it seems everyone from survival has shifted over to here and just like to take everyone else's kills, so even if the event is rushed, I still don't get joy out of the killing aspect and all. Especially if there are low levels there, like my alt, it takes away any xp
---
Hog wash!!
---
It’s should AFTER 23th October so next 4 weeks for SURE
---
i already got what i need thanks tho
---
who say's they aren't around?  written history is spotty, and since none from Appalachia yet exists who's to say what happened in the 200 years between this game and 4?
---
My primary weapon isn’t bad, my build does need improvement but even with a semi complete build and a really good gun I still can’t get the damage needed
---
Feel free to friend me on Xbox my gamertag is therealpyroland and me I got some friends and we'd be down to play
---
Im running with a 200 plus damage musket i mainly use it when sneaking the shotgun perks are for my explosive shotgun so i can deal with things that attack me before i can reload the flintlock ill probably drop the automatic for now though seeing as you mention that and im not using automatic weapons at the moment
---
If you’re using an explosive gun then there’s your problem. She laughs at explosive weapons. They are booty cheeks against her due to her high DR and all the buffs she has like damage mitigation/ignored
---
Awesome. What type if stuff do you guys do?
---
Ok ya if they will get out of cosmetics and into real quality of life game fixes/updates I will change my opinion but so far all I’ve seen are overpriced shop items and my own personal inability to have significant game time, even though I’ve played since day 1 of beta, due to server crashes/work/family life of wife and 3 kids so ya I’d like a reason to make sure and actually log in and do something EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.
---
There ya go. Drop the auto and get more semi and you’ll kill stuff faster :) try getting a lever or even hunting rifle. With proper perks it’s really good
---
Then how come every other player fighting her use explosive weapons and kill her within a minute?
---
All kinds of different stuff I have been trying to get to lvl 100 and I have a friend who keeps making different builds
---
IT IS THE ONE THING THAT UNITES US
---
#ANCHORAGE WILL BE LIBERATED
---
Conversely, we also find level 5 *** pipe weapons that are hot garbage worth 40 scrip...
---
Whether the remainder of scorched creatures are killed or not, we should still get the rewards, because of all the hype. Do you really believe that Bethesda would say, "Sorry, the required totals were not met, so that means no deep Purveyor discounts, no free cosmetic Atom Shop items, etc." How well do you think that would go over?
---
Therefore, I believe Bethesda will end up fudging the numbers and say, "Looks like the community came together and just squeaked by, killing off the required scorched, earning their tewards."
---
I'm level 86 right now and am trying to level up right now. I just started a power armour business yesterday. I also collect T-51 power armour. I am a 2 handed melle build but would like to make a heavy gunner build
---
i personally hope that some of the atom shop paint jobs for power armor also work in the event, ones like
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Black Rider, Plague Rider, War Rider, Pale Rider, Vault Mascot Helmet (with matching vault paint job, either blue or the free tan ones), Liberty Prime, and any others that alter the look of the PA
---
 Vacuums are for noobs, real players mop the shag
---
Wait, you've never successfully done either? Are you on Xbox? Most of the time, when I join in, they get completed. For Pharma, only ONCE have I been in an event where all 3 have passed the test and stayed alive. A couple of 2 left Alives, and majority 1s. But also had a fair share of fails as well, but lately there hasn't been many. With sheepsquach, there's been a few fails (I will not DARE touch pylons again as a bloodied build, especially with a bug where I kept taking damage all the time afterwards, but I've still never gotten the fixer plan. I had to buy that for 18 k. I cant even find a bear arm for less than 30k so I've been trying to do that event when I find it
---
Absolutely! The drop rate for HRF is garbage!
---
Perhaps just the Grafton monster. Otherwise, the  mutant hounds, ghouls, assaultrons, bloatflies, and glowing hounds are all the regular variety.
---
I am a heavy Gunner build and in the high 90s I have a bunch of different pa mods like a ultrasite jetpack if your looking for one
---
You have to press G to adjust the zoom in game.
---
There is an "exception" out there where she can be solo killed befpr she can even become legendary. So yeah a lot of issues with the ol girl right now.
---
Weird, my Gatling Plasma does ok on her even though it explodes. 🤔
---
Well my GT is Titan Atlas1991 if you wanna add me and join my server, about to nuke the queen.
---
Naw I'm on PC. Player base is like a quarter of the size right now. Most my friends quit the game completely an probably wont even come back to try wastelanders. I've tried teaming up through a few Discords but it's never worked out.
---
The vody, not the Curator!
---
Honestly I think the main issue is that there was a duping issue prior to the patch this week.  So we have a lot of guys running around with high powered legacy weapons now.
---
Nice. Dont worry you'll get there in time!
---
Oh SHIT!
---
Imagine if you could pickpocket other players too!!
---
My sniper build focusing on using an Instigating Lever Action.  You’ll 1-shot 99% of the mobs with this.  
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2e145ff&amp;d=sv1p00pd2pk2pp2pl2pr0c72ic4a72ar2an2lr2l71lt2lv2lk2li0a04ao0eo0&amp;w=c61cr0cd1ce0p10ag2at1lf0lm2&amp;m=051cfa&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
I dont have Ultracite but I can make it. I'm going to bed now but will add you and play tommorow. I get on around 4-5pm est
---
Most likely
---
It would’ve been easier if I started my build earlier than i did
---
A stealth sniper should really have two guns.  An Instigating Lever Action and a good Handmade.  You can mix in a Fixer if you prefer.  Unless you are a bloodied build, an Instigating Lever is required if you want to be efficient. See the build I posted too. Sniper is one of the bust builds in the game if done correctly.
---
Ok cool I should be on around then
---
Test out a non explosive handmade and then a explosive handmade. Like a BFFr and a BE. You’ll see the huge difference in damage actually dealt to her. I thought Explosives were best for queen too. Till I decided to try out my BFFr handmade on her. Haven’t looked back or used my BE primed Gatling plasma since then.
---
Very nice
---
Cool man glad that worked out
---
Sorry for the delayed response, had to take a break for RL Reasons and found myself flooded with an insane amount of messages I'm still catching up with.  
---
Added and submitted
---
Do they really all use weapons though? A true SBQ team has a few heavy gunners to cripple her and several melee builds chomping at her when she’s on the ground. Like I said, test for yourself. Get something like a BE handmade and a BFFr handmade. You’ll see the big difference in dmg dealt to her. I haven’t touched my BE primed Gatling plasma since I switched to FFr only
---
my GT is tanaas just msg me when you are done and ill invite you , sorry i can't really leave this server atm
---
My character stands with china
---
Awesome thanks for the reply
---
That's what I'm saying man! The prospect of that scares me but also excites me...
---
But don't put all of them behind the paywall!
---
Give the 'normal' people also something in the basegame which should've been in already anyway since most are assetflips from FO4 anyway
---
My thoughts are just this.. It is totally biased toward people who have played it from the start of the  introduction.. Levels are held so that new players are at the mercy of high ranking players.. I have spent so much time in the adventure game that now I just cant get interested in the daily grind so I went over and tried Nuclear winter.. if you have an ego check it at the door cause your gona get butt raped over and over again.. 68 year old male gamed since the inception of DOS..
---
I know she’s explosion resistant (I think 75%). That said, an Exploding Gatling Plasma can basically solo her. On my Rifleman I still use either my BE Handmade or Fixer because I don’t have a FFR one yet.  I know it’s sub-optimal, but I still do plenty of damage to get loot.  I’ve never not gotten loot unless I arrived too late.  
---
People who aren’t getting loot either need to upgrade gear or their build.  There’s no other option.
---
The worst feeling in the world is a 1* off the Scorchbeast Queen. What FeelsBadMan moment. 
---
It would really simplify the game if you got gear with the same number of stars as the enemy.
---
Probably the only thing that's worth spending atoms on right now 😷
---
Oh that was you? I was wondering who kicked my butt
---
Idk how they wouldnt that bugs existed since fallout 3 this is the first fallout game ive ever used them in becuz of it
---
Doubtful. Probably not until early November/near the end of Mischief Night at least if i had to guess
---
DC is just a couple hours drive from West Virginia. 
---
I understand the logic of the old retconbut something probably would ha e been brought up somewhere in Fallout 3 or 4
---
I don't really like edits if I can help it. Messes up the flow of the conversation
---
I was talking about the picture of the physical scope that was posted. You can’t press a button, but have to twist the lenses by hand.
---
It's always cool when online games give players an option to betray their teammates and take their stuff, but they can't, because of TROLLS!!
---
And I bet if they allowed that, people would just have huge pickpocket builds and take everyone's stuff. ;-;
---
If they found a way to make it fair though, like making you have to do some kid of unique mini-game and only being able to take one stack of junk or ammo (no guns or armors) from their inv, it might work.
---
I’d love to see you solo the queen with just the plasma and no other help.
---
And that’s literately what I said in the beginning. People who don’t get loot need to get better gear and build. Can’t expect everyone to stop and ask “okay everyone did you all get enough damage done to get loot?”🤷🏻‍♀️ OP knows this but probably just ticked off. He gonna hate it when loot turns into purely performance based lmao
---
I made a new character 1 hour later 1 level 70 and a 100 triing to force me into combat funny how that never happens on my level 200
---
Yeah because if someone could steal my legendary weapons I would never carry them around😂
---
Makes all the people parroting Brotherhood sayings a tad ironic
---
I use to pvp i now dont touch it since the pvp update so i approve
---
I don't hate the Chinese People, I hate the oppression of their government and I do not want to see Hong Kong fall under that opression - I admire the protestors fight for their freedom, that they say they are willing to die, for their freedom, as our (US) founding fathers were when they fought for our freedom from the British.  
---
So, while I don't hate the Chinese people, I feel like it is culturally insensitive for them to travel to Hong Kong at this time, ***unless, they make it clear they are 100% in support of the protest movement.***
---
A ton of people think that communism means state-controlled means of production, even though that's the definition of state capitalism.
---
Still dead in a second and I just got on tossed on a handmade and yep sure as shit 2.6 seconds on the stop watch to empty the clip so that is about 7.5 rounds a second I will concede on the the 1 shot but damn lets be real if you die in less than a second you may as well have been one shotted. Oh and that was not with FFR that was just a junk one I made at the bench.   
---
Maybe if I lived in power armor it would be a few seconds at least I could react however that would make this game horrible to force anyone that just wants a workshop to live in PA since someone will want to come along just to kill you and then hop servers to kill someone else or send you a voice message with garbled cockboi sounds which brings me back to all those that raid workshops to scav a few caps and grief a player are nothing but losers in real life trying to give themselves an ego boost knowing they will be nothing but a sad pathetic loser for life. The kind of kid that gets laughed at for making cat noises and doing naruto runs or that twice divorced drunken wife beater that no woman in the small town they are stuck in would fall for his shit anymore.   
---
Those kind of people.
---
Nothing prevents you from doing that while you look through the scope tho.
---
I’m not saying I can do it.  I’m old and not good enough of a player, but it’s supposedly been done.  I’d die from adds for sure.  I think a 2 man team could probably do it with one guy focusing on adds, and one on the Queen.  
---
I will say that the damage the legacy Gatling plasma can do to the Queen is obscene. My understanding is that she has zero resist to legacy explosions, but I can’t tell you if that’s true or not.  I’ve used BE and BFFR weapons against her before, and the legacy GP is next level damage. You are hitting her with multiple beams and multiple explosions per shot, so imagine a Minigun or LMG hitting five to ten times times faster and with and explosion on each one. There’s so much damage you can’t remotely read it all.  There’s a reason why it’s the most powerful weapon in the game, and I’m sure I’m the wrong guy to explain the exact mechanics why.
---
Happened to me also. But then he starts acting up down the line and then goes full scorched.
---
I sent a friend request
---
There should be some kind of level-based control set upon claiming the workshops. It's rarely ever going to be a fair conflict and it will always be a point of friction. If only, there were a rule where players could only initiate a claim if they were in a similar level the player holding the workshop. For instance, a lvl 5 player claims a workshop, someone only lvl 20 or below could initiate a claim on the workshop, so on up a scale to would fit with the player's level. Workshops could be a different color marker for where a similar level character had a claim, meanwhile lower level characters get a chance to benefit from the resources that are offered by the workshop. But also it provides the people who want to play PVP a destination where they can expect someone worth a challenge.
---
Just an idea that I had earlier after I saw your post.
---
Legendary Gatling plasmas don’t 100% ignore her amor. On my pip boy I do 400dmg with my BE Gatling plasma. But when I would fight her with it max I would get was a big cloud of 15’s right on her head since I sued beam splitter. Legacy energy weapons are treated by the game as ballistic due to the explosive perk. Hence why they are considered broken and and Explosive laser melts everything
---
Power armor isn't going to help. Perks. Use those.
---
The game has seemed laggy on Xbox quite often since the last update.
---
Mine did also.
---
Then he began attacking random stuff at my camp. He would make the attacking sound, but never do damage.
---
It became amusing again after he started messing with my junk bot...
---
Well? Life is a gamble. Haha
---
Having laser and plasma scorch combat challenges does not help. I'm sorry! I did try to avoid the areas that always spawn scorch
---
Torch the Scorch 2019 letsgooooooooo
---
So a legacy explosion is not calculated as an explosion, but as ballistic damage (different resists)?
---
I always remind people tk make sure everyone tags the legendary first b4 finishing off. Some pple r asshole though. Deliberate 1 shot
---
Agree though I held off for the exact reason:  base model and skins, not who knows how many base models.  It seems they keep trying new things with the atom shop trying to see what sticks.  I brought the bundle for the vaulting items a few weeks back, then they stopped doing vaulting bundles!  Wish they’d pick a pattern on the shop and stick with it.
---
Have you ever held a rifle with a scope? It’s a two handed weapon and very heavy. If you take your supporting hand off of the weapon it will drop forward from weight. It’s just not possible for an average person to hold and adjust that weapon.
---
Never mind I just got the jet pack the ultracite jet pack
---
Sadly this.
---
So the "up to +3 points to S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats(except END) the lower your health" is the effect of Unyielding. *Where* that word is in the armor's title, doesn't affect its efficacy. If it has the effect, it has the effect. And that particular modifier will almost always say it in the title. Here's a page to help define this stuff further: 
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_legendary\_effects](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects)
---
Oh, I see what you mean. But the discrimination I talked about has been there for more than ten years. It is not something new. 
---
And by the way, this time there is nothing to do with freedom. They were initially against a change of regulation, but for some reason they start to attack police, rob and burn stores. We against their violence but have no comment on anything related to freedom. Actually, to my surprise, there is no move from Beijing towards people in HK. (But the bans about NBA, south park, etc. are extremely stupid and funny in this age.)
---
My friends in HK are all very worried and they barely walk out in these days.
---
Not yet, I've been sticking around near the town that has the Mothman museum, my camp isn't far from it.
---
If they fly another country's flag (USA) because they see it as a symbol of freedom from a oppressive government, then Americans should take it as a compliment.
---
I’ve got a BE handmade and it does damage her just not enough
---
Ramona approves.
---
I feel for you I've had my fair share of people come and go in this game. Had 3 clan mates back in December that just went silent. Sat in the dark for a while and then joined up with a group. Now it's just me and a few others that just mess around now.
---
 Ramona approves.
---
This sounds suspiciously like crazy talk.
---
Mines 97 damage per shot with a drum mag and apparently it’s not enough
---
???
---
Thank you. Stay safe friend.
---
I'm not exactly an average person, so my experiences prolly are not applicable to most. In any case, I'll care about that level of realism when they add the ability to go prone and brace your weapon with a tripod or against the side of a tree. You know, like they do in hardcore milsim games like Arma. Which incidentally, lets you change magnification on that exact scope I linked, while you are aiming through it.
---
I probably can't because I've already gotten out of the Navy, but if they want me back after I've gotten out of shape... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
yes let me guess you did collision course recently?
---
Looks like Dr Eggman lol. Just give him a huge mustache and youre good to go.
---
I'm not sure. I've only been playing since FO4
---
I’d give it a thorough look when you find yourself out that way. 😉
---
Oh I definitely will! All I know is that the key to the bathroom is elsewhere, if I recall, it's somewhere on the other side of the map? I'm the type of gamer who, while I do enjoy adventures, really just taking in those lovely rendered brightly colored leaves and just kinda chill in nature, staying in one place...until a bunch of wild dogs attack my camp. Immersion destroyed.
---
Would be great to be able to build on top of more existing structures. FYI, try the savage divide mountains if you dig high (I have a camp there).
---
like I said, written history is spotty, references to other cities are rare, even ones close, and travel would be at a minimum so decades could easily go by with no word between communities just hours away.  point is they didn't really retcon much with this game, not as much as they have.  it's not like there was already Appalachian lore that they changed, they just added to the canon
---
pc
---
not if you do it the way I did...
---
That would be tight as hell if they would put stuff like that in!
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
lol affirmative ptfo!
---
Do you think it is?
---
sorta.  they're consumables (and they give my brain delicious knowledge)
---
Pretty recently, ya!
---
I spawned into gulper lagoon and fell over dead for no reason.  The map showed the death marker.  I respawn and there was no marker for my loot bag.  I did stumble upon it since I died at spawn the first time.  It was just difficult to see since the bag is brown.
---
I feel your pain.  Sometimes you get the quest marker and sometimes you don't. It just works...sometimes.
---
Don't forget all the amusement parks spawn scorched as well
---
Ehhh... maybe an alarm in the immediate area around it? Like a tornado siren maybe, but not a server wide thing
---
*yea thats whats causeing it ...not the normal goverment drops it's specifically doing that mission that causes it*
---
This story is a really cute way to say "I wasted weeks of my life looking for a plan until my friend bought one from a duper". Don't pretend for one second that a free plasma grenade plan is from a world drop. 
---
Remember the recent emergency maintenance to address an exploit? The exploit was a duping method and plasma grenade plans, BE 15%reload Fixers, and BE 15%reload gatling plasmas have been flooding the trade markets.
---
I'm not blaming you or your friends for this, I'm commenting on the reality of trading rare items in this game. It really takes away from the "act of kindness" aspect of the story when you realize it's a cheater giving away dupes. I've run into several "helpful" dupers, they happily give away dev room items and God roll legendaries to their friends. 
---
I've seen a guy bragging about having 10,000 stimpacks and junk items for 1 cap each in his vending machine and calling himself a hero for "sharing the wealth". 
---
Deal with those people with caution and have fun in the wasteland.
---
Afking in a bush and going on Reddit while a read this.
---
And then the U.S. invented micro fusion, and basically star trek style replicator technology, thus creating an end to the problem.
---
I've been seeing them show up randomly throughout the map for the last week or so.  I just figured people were calling them in and I happen to find one.
---
Just.. clip size... I mean...just...
---
We should be able to buy scrip with caps. Not a huge amount, and not cheap either. Just a way to blow off extra caps for the people tired of buying recall cards (the current best cap sink)
---
5.56 ammo and serums will make you rich....
---
100% it one shots a lvl 40 parasitic Grafton monster without running
---
I just had this and I was like WTH! If it happens 3 days in a row I'm gonna be really mad. May be dumb for some but this is kind of my end game, I don't want my challenges completed for me, much less with no reward.
---
You might want to post a link to explain your contest to those who might be interested.
---
Everything is subjective. 
---
So my subjective view, if you're buying, buy it. If you're selling, double it.
---
Yes. If I got that as a 1* drop I would put it in my vendor for 1500-2500.
---
Makes sense thanks for advice moose😄
---
Pax australia is in 2 days, maybe something there?
---
50 is when you stop applying points to SPECIAL, 55 or so to get the perks unlocked at 50. After that point it's pretty much moot.
---
Sweet I also buyed a furious faster vats junkies for 1500k what's that worth?
---
I would say anything under 1k is a bargain
---
This is a great idea
---
Oh alright thanks for ur input 👍
---
Sweet thanks for u comment 👍
---
I think you might have made a typo, furious and junkies cannot coexist I believe.
---
Ops my. Bad sorry didn't mean that junkies I type to fast I'll slow down for now on
---
So any idea what it's worth?
---
You're fine! What kind of weapon is it? It wasn't specified in the earlier comment
---
Oh sorry I'm dumb it's a Gatling gun
---
takes until the 80s for most builds to get all their cards leveled up
---
There is a Reddit post from 7 days ago explaining the contest.
---
Alright thank you for ur input 🌛
---
Lvl 27s dont belong in end game area's hence why the Mothman Evicted you.
---
Reddit is such a horseshit website
---
I'm sure everyone will be eager to search for it.
---
I did. 2 weeks ago. Not since.
---
Nah, you're not dumb!
---
Furious/FFR gatling gun should be worth 8,000-10,000+ caps in my opinion, depending on the market desire. +VATS is nice but I prefer 90% reduced weight on my heavy weapons. 
---
BTW I'm on PS4, my average prices may not be the same as yours.
---
I have none of the issues you are reporting here, but I don’t use Nuka grenades.
---
It’s where all the bodies being found at pricketts fort are coming from.
---
Ohhh alright thank you for ur time
---
Lots of things other then the bombs contributed to the landscape being ruined. For instance the entire city of Charleston was flooded by the raiders who broke the dam. The strangler vines from vault 94 ruined much of the land in the more. Scorchbeasts caused a lot of destruction in their stomping grounds of the cranberry bog. valley is heavily polluted due to mainly the chemicals and dust coming from Grafton steel.
---
I'm slightly concerned they are holding back just  incase they need to delay it. They have to get this right because if they nail it then that's the biggest come back since No Man's Sky. I'm just being cautious with excitement because it seems like a crazy task to overhaul the game this soon.
---
I cant remember the last time I disconnected. Been weeks.
---
😂
---
What’s your PSN?  I will gladly help out
---
Im fairly certain somewhere in the lore for 76 it states that it wasn’t the nukes that ravaged Appalachia, it was the environmental changes that the nukes caused that ruined the lancscape...floods from the dam in Summersville ruined Charleston, Earthquakes, etc
---
They were already running around before the war though. Says so in a loading screen. Didn't know about the second release though.
---
Yeah that's fair, I've read a decent amount of lore and don't remember Hong Kong being mentioned so it'd be pretty obscure if it exists
---
Highest level I’ve seen was ~845 on Xbox. If I had to consider a character “high level”, anyone over 250, though I have 5 characters with the lowest at 97 so that can be deceptive.
---
Well I get what you are saying, but you are not being called officer in game and record shows people were still called by their ranks in military or position in the government.
---
That's a really nice build! I would love to run that being a sniper myself but I have to have my strength at 15 because I'm a horder lol. Will definitely consider making some tweaks after view that so thanks for sharing ☺️
---
Yeah they do, I carry an anti armor one around for the "level up while using an instrument weapon" challenge because it weights so little.
---
Any ammo that goes in automatic guns sells well for me. .308, 5.56, 10mm, 5mm, .50 cal, plasma cores, shotgun shells, and even plasma rounds.
---
Plans you already know. I sell them cheap, 50-100 caps. I wouldn't bother with food recipes.
---
I'm not very concerned about decorating with magazines or bobbleheads, but they sell out fast for me. I sell them for 25-50 caps.
---
Unwanted two-star or three-star legendaries. 
---
Rare outfits. I sell the purple skiing outfit and BoS gear for 15 caps. 
---
Shielded under armors. Do those at 1,500 caps. 
---
Serums at 400 caps.
---
I craft chems like mad, so I sell spare ones at 5 to 15 caps. Grape Mentats and Berry Mentats move fast.
---
Things required for the Scouts badges or quests. Bug parts, for example. I sell them at 5 caps each and never keep up with demand.
---
Scrapped junk or mayne bulked. Lead, copper, plastic, and acid sells well for me.
---
Oh alright thank you for a wonderful comment take care of urself now
---
Shit, I am from Hong Kong and I never thought of using my character for this, I guess shame on me lol
---
I can still carry a lot with deep pockets and the high capacity backpack when necessary.  I think 315 lbs (375 with the backpack).  Also, remember you only really need to carry 2 weapons, maybe 3 if you want a Tesla for tagging mobs in events.
---
And a live grenade in my ha-
---
If u upgrade ur rad resistance in the perk tree u wouldent have any issues.
---
Hurr durr  Wake up ShEePle!! Lmao bro stop!
---
[removed]
---
*America looks around nervously*
---
The best advice I can give is don't be afraid to cut prices. It's not a real life buisiness so anything you don't need is better off selling rather than sitting there over priced taking up stash space. 
---
Visiting lots of other camps is a really good way to get an idea of pricing. You will learn what is the right/wrong prices. Half the RRP is a good starting point... 
---
There are some exceptions when you should be cautious, for eg - rare plans and god roll weapons and armor (late game). You can always visit a trade discord or even here for advice on those.  
---
Most importantly have fun and just go with your gut on what you think is right! 👊
---
It just works.
---
True Dat. Nihilistic butt hurt kid that can't look at his memes in peace.
---
Good, I’m glad I didn’t say much then. Enjoy the journey!
---
I have a route I run to farm legendary weapons. It doesn’t take long either. Sometimes it’s good for 5-8 legendary weapons if you get lucky, and several of them are 3* enemies. I hate to say this but I think it would make it too easy to max scrip for the day and take the novelty and status away from having a good 3* legendary.
---
I'd say anyone over 200 should be considered high level because most players I see are below 200.
---
Thanks m8
---
omg, really, Cap?!
---
https://gfycat.com/ru/distantparchedcivet
---
Great advice!
---
Lol what are you even talking about. That only addresses one of the four things: there’s still damage from invisible enemies, falling damage, and getting a disease because you spawn in water.
---
Alright very helpful thank you for ur help💙
---
If the the *same* scammer form last week who wants you to give him a thousand caps to "enter" his contest??
---
Now what could possibly go wrong with that??
---
Oh man, sorry you had to replace it
---
Avoid these 3 "Electrically charged, plague walker, and unstable isotope."
---
My loading screen pops me as lvl 1 aswell.
---
A perk which scales in level, so you can see where workbenches are. Nobody would use because internet.
---
And yet... here you are...
---
Not me! I'll join in for defenses and repair your turrets, too. A guy thanked me for not murdering him earlier.
---
It's all good. Stay safe friend.
---
I think it's in nuclear winter?
---
Yeah im aware but can u still get it?
---
 It's all good. Stay safe friend.
---
So you donr belive that "freedom is the soveriegn right of every american"?
---
He's all good right now, but I will vaccinate him in the future
---
Did you have to "old yeller" him?
---
Yes, don't be afraid to cut prices, but also don't be that guy that put on a JE LMG for 2k, or that guy that put on a BE25 Railway for 10k that I met.
---
I have to say I thank them very much.
---
Either a random triggered spawn, or could have been a horde event.  Sounds fun either way :)
---
Thats unusual for them to be there unless its further down the way near bills homestead.  Its usually just ghouls, bots, and animals by the flatwoods.
---
Haha, sounds funny
---
The fridge is crazy expensive imo. I love the stuff they add but jesus they pricing hurts. Wait for a sale if you already own the original.
---
Ok then, then explain why Pete Hines confirmed and said at quakecon and I quote “private servers are coming sooner than you think” and Todd Howard saying quote “Mod Support is a big thing in many Bethesda games and will definitely be in Fallout 76” just before the release of the game!!!
---
Never saw that. Cosmic rays affecting the server?
---
So we need to work some... BioWare magic.
---
Had a buddy put him down. The buddy had to put down my scorched Megasloth also.
---
I love the one star tire irons and walking sticks you get from her...
---
Will do, thank you very much for the support, we really need that.
---
Falling damage u can get less damage from eather having Bird bones mutation. Or goat legs in perks. As for invisable enemies. Its a bug they havent fixed. Diseases are easy to cure with meds. Tho i keep my diseases as it gives me more DPS.
---
Thats alright. Got s regular one. My scorched one was also diseased maybe he wasnt feeling well
---
That'd help with the lag on loading too. Depending on the server, time, and location sometimes I'm just stuck unable to move for a few seconds if I fast travel.
---
I had it happen a week ago. They would follow me when I fast traveled.
---
Ok, so let me get this straight.  You’re telling me that this 30 seconds of invincibility would not be useful because there are workaround methods by which you can mitigate the damages from the game fucking you over with it’s stupid mechanics? (Invisible enemies, spawning in water, spawning right off a cliff) 
---
That’s like me saying “hey local government, could you fix this big-ass pothole in the middle of the road?” And then you saying “well you can just drive around the hole, so what’s the big deal”.
---
Well considering Appalachia is close to DC, when all the nukes hit DC, there must be some sort of Earthquake. And there are the scorchbeasts, the Christmas Flood, raiders, monsters etc.
---
Unfortunately the queen of the hunt daily is bugged for me.. It is at load the tissue sample step every time I log in, and when I try to do it it clears the step but nothing happens. No complete and the quest title is still there with no more steps after waiting for results. I've tried to quit the quest but it resets at the same step every time I log in, turn in tissue sample. I read somewhere that someone got it to work by turning it in and running away very quickly, but that didn't work either.
---
HK is one of the most memorable places I've ever visited. I remember being on a boat on a foggy day. All I saw was water, and as we approached Fenwick Pier, I suddenly saw all the towering skyscrapers breaking through the fog and mist. I'll never forget that morning.
---
Haha totally true! Nothing beats a weekly wasteland black Friday sale 😂👊
---
U can also get zero fall damage if u live in power armor.
---
Why wouldn't be able to get it?
---
I'd say it's a good noob's weapon or for anyone that isn't using a bloodied build, so yeah, buy it if you want it.
---
Nice cherry picking
---
"Democracy is non negotiable", says the nuke throwing robot built by an imperialist fascist US government
---
&gt;It would be amazing if there was a lathe 
---
Yes.
---
&gt;for purchase in the atom shop
---
No.
---
&gt;that allows us to craft gears, screws, springs and similar stuff.
---
Its not uncommon to encounter random groups of scorched/mutants/etc once you leave the starter area, but Im kinda thinking somebody intentionally pulled them there.
---
What level were they?
---
Lol ok you’re either completely missing the point of what I’m saying or you’re just trolling me at this point. Have a good one bro
---
I was working with averages.
---
So I thought I dodged a bullet and dropped my server after my shoppers were buying up all my goodies and I maxed out....until I started looking tonight and realized I’m pretty sure Bethesda pocketed the caps for 2 3* Marine Armor pieces and a 3* Prime Gatling Laser! That hurts, lesson learned the hard way....
---
Also agreeable, its saying that people will have the right to choose and you cannot take that away from them, unless you support dictatorships of course
---
Are you factoring in fuel, are you paying or are they? What about insurance, maintanence and so on? Are you paying for all of that, are they, or is it split? That example dosn't fit the micro/transaction shop in the game where occasionally you get scraps thrown your way.  
---
I saw someone comment in this topic elsewhere that no real human would actual pay full price or outright pay for items when they could get 'free' credits, sorry, atoms. However, that is just wrong, many people will spend or have spent all their free atoms and buy an item for real money. There's no "price" offset, not entierly. Sure, some will actually do that the "smart" way, (imo, smart would actually just be NOT buying anything so you dont further the idea that they can get away with this), but many people will use them as a "cool, free thing/s that I would not have normally gotten. Now I want to buy some other shit." or "Ah, I already got the thing I wanted, but look, another thing I want! Shame I have to buy it now." or even "Hmmm, I'll buy what I want and get some free shit too." You can't just blanket everyone the same.  
---
Anyway, back to it, if an item costs $8, it's $8 right? What if you can only "buy" that money in packs, so you can only "buy" $5 for like, $6.50 or you can get $10 for; $9.99. WELL GOSH, you'd buy that $10 pack! WHAT A DEAL, only now, you have spent $2 more than you ever would have for that $8 item.  
---
Eh, not so bad right? Only $2. Let it build up. You ever been a smoker or heavy drinker? Prices go up a little bit every now and then, or just your general expenditure might increase because you want/need more. So you think, "Ah, I'm only spending $24.85 a week on ciggies." But you forgot! You have to buy lighters as well! So, every few weeks add in about $2.95 give or take a buck, for region. How much is that a month? $102.35. Damn, that's a lot. Assuming this is static and the price does not increase then you spend $1228.20 a year. WOW.  
---
Lets add an element, say, you get a discount because you always shop there or are buying a lot. Let's be generous and give 5% discount (typical employee discount where I live and work). $1166.79 is now what you pay. That's still a lot, even with the bone!  
---
Now suppose you have to pay to enter the shop for the first time, between $60 to $200, depending on level of access to the shop you want, if you want a shirt and hat for paying entry. Maybe a smokin' Joe mask! Cool. Ok, so now every other entry into the store is FREE, because they like to provide for their customers. So, you end up spending $1226.79 for that year, oh shit. That's ALMOST back to where it WAS before the discount! AND THAT'S THE LOW END IF YOU PAY ONLY $60! 
---
The customers are OUTRAGED, so the store drops the entry fee to $40 at the lower end a month later. But only for new customers, of course. Now new people only have to pay about $1206.79, assuming they have the same level of habit as you do.  
---
Is any of this getting through?
---
Thank you
---
Did you miss the "fascist" part?
---
Sorry for your losses
---
not a bad suggestion, I like the idea of a localised alarm. I would imagine a server wide thing would become tiresome pretty quickly unless you could silence alerts.
---
7 deaths to either glitches or the scorch plague
---
There has been a strange amount of behemoths around lately. Not sure what's up with that.
---
Lol good one
---
Whitesprings would also be nice. Asked someone where they got their Whitesprings palm carpet and never got an answer.
---
I could see that being a problem with scrip. Maybe limiting guaranteed 3*** to boss enemies would be good enough.
---
As for novelty.. the odds will still be astronomically low of getting the exact roll you want. First you have to roll 3*** then weapon, then the right weapon, then prefix, then 2nd Star, then 3rd, this would only affect the first part and I don’t think that’s too much of a change.
---
What's the point of a stretch goal then?
---
And also a guy that put up a BE Gatling Gun for 15k but I think this one did it on purpose because it's not only once I found good stuff from him.
---
I've had my MK for long while, he's my first pet
---
I didn't check, which I blame on my panic
---
Oh my innocent little friend
---
The griefers would abuse this immediately
---
I live the side eye he's giving you
---
There are two smaller nuke craters on the eastern side of the Divide, just north of the Monorail Elevator, so I guess the region was targeted with at least a couple tactical missiles.
---
Other than that, the fights that took place after the war, the environmental changes, pollution etc. did their part in destroying the place.
---
I haven't even seen it pop once since they did this whole public event bs.  :-(
---
It's exceptionally rare, on the "Outfit" table, so unless you got a Jumpsuit reward as well, you would never see the mask
---
I know it’s not labeled a skin, but imo...it is
---
Yup, sales are the best
---
I run 5 characters at the same time, so I have no idea if that has happened. Sometimes I celebrate because I find out I have like 300 when I expected to be close to Zero.
---
I wouldn’t call Whitesprings end game area. And I was walking towards Flatwoods 😉
---
The contest you set up sucks, but trying to scam people in a video games shows you're a waste of a space and even worse :)
---
I pumped this old cow for god armor.  Calling it a day I think though random fudgepacker.
---
I got fucked with 9 mirelurk kings today. Fukin 9 of them in the cranberry bog all on me at once.
---
If you're going to bring any semblence of who is behind these things you might aswell just say that democracy doesnt exist, instead just take things at face value since I'm sure if Honk Kong protesters said some liberty prime quotes the chinese would sit there and go "but um bum, the robot in that game was built by the government who in that game was actually quite evil therefore anything they say isnt true ahem ahem"  
---
Because lets face it, Trump was electred by the Russians, Putin was elected by himself and the KGB, the Chinese run a 1 party system who is elected by the previous leader and the Britshish Prime Minister wasnt elected at all
---
 Its free to enter how am I scamming anyone Mr Einstein?
---
Once I saw a meat pile in a goo pile, it looked like a fried egg.
---
 This guy is clearly handicapped
---
I'm a legit millionaire with over 200 trades in market 76 and you are a random dickweed.
---
Which pasty big titted crybaby taught you that word? If you have to tell us it is an insult, it might be the most effective insult, you angry little puddle of self hate.
---
Yeah we've just been running silos over and over launching at the SBQ. I'd say there's a few scorthed to kill
---
I removed the entry fee because otherwise people are allergic to a good time.  I suppose you forgot to read that
---
I can tell you're not a stealth player. PA absolutely dongs your stealth, even with the Stealth Boy mod, and it's not like a good stealth charrie is taking hits anyway.
---
Wiki says the plan might be called Plan: Revolver, try Whitesprings.
---
It's 30k with no strings attached
---
Wow, that's an Omega level oof
---
Were you in an event? Are you verifying you're missing your loot? 
---
I apologize for the remedial questions, it's just in the last patch or 2 they removed junk dropping if you die at events.
---
You know the fact that they are holding back information makes me feel like it's just going to be basic additions for an RPG game.
---
Remember the Burrows? Even the fucking thing got articles surrounding it from different websites, but wastelander has non.
---
Yea, like a general is a high tanking officer
---
Starting to wonder myself. I thought they would have at least started dripping info out by now. I stopped playing back in August and was planning to come back fresh for wastelanders so I'm hoping for some info soon.
---
Really analyze what I was trying to accomplish on this horseshit website, and the level of compensation isn't the issue.
---
That's little damage. I would go for a ski Sword (More damage) or a walking Cane (style). Find any onehanded legendary, people sell them cheap. In fact, I have an instigating plus fast swing plus reduced weight ski Sword which nobody seems to care about.
---
Riverside Manor is crawling with low level scorched inside and out
---
Are they going to ban Fallout in China now?..
---
Yay!
---
Maybe you can find a better website for this then.
---
Every fissure site
---
the intention, I believe, was to have it be like borderlands where you would constantly change your loadout, but there are only like a few combinations for each build that are even worth it and once you get them you won't be changing them.  I mean who changed their loadouts in any of the previous Fallout games?  I made a build and built it to be as efficient as possible, why change what works?  also this isn't a looter shooter, they really do need to fix the rng in this game, it's freaking ridiculous...
---
It's really not worth it to bother
---
Ik the game has other issues but this would be a cool thing to do and a way to interact with the players. It would be nice to add new music to the radio once a month
---
Then don't even bother starting this little campaign of yours.
---
none of that matters when you get a one star shovel from the friggin queen after spending much time, effort, and resources
---
I have experienced the CTD using consumables since release  but I have not noticed it being more common since the last patch.
---
I still can go several multiple-hour playing session without experiencing it ones.
---
Is irritating when it happens, it has been infuriating on a few of occasions, but is not something that happens consistently every time I play.
---
By far the quickest way for plastic, westek rinse and repeat with scrapper perk.
---
Much appreciated
---
Yes
---
Freinds, and not just the title lol
---
How about 3* can only drop 2 or 3?
---
You would get a lot more of 3 star rolls though, just not from the purveyor.
---
You would just run out of daily script faster, which is somewhat of a problem because it would devalue low level legendaries (why kill level 10 wolves if you are going to max out daily script with the Queen already?).
---
But outside of those, legendaries would become more common, player vendors would be plentiful of 3 stars and getting your godroll wouldn't be so impossible as it currently is. 
---
I think it would be way better. After all, you might want another godroll for your secondary weapon and your armor, that is 7 godrolls to optimize your build. Which currently is pretty much a nightmare.
---
This, because of armour penetration
---
yes, that is the point I was making.  if you listen to MODUS he says the military never integrated their ranking system with the Enclave, the only requirement to be a member is military enlistment, the only requirement to have access to the upper echelons is being a general in the military.
---
Sounds like we need some Lion Head masks to be added stat.  I want to get my Voltron on!
---
 Someone is going to get the money and have their day brightened, and you will continue to be angry and insecure.
---
that would not at all be lore friendly, as we all emerge hours apart
---
Both exterior areas and the interior of Big Bend Tunnel.
---
The Bog as a whole, namely the Fissure Sites and the ASAM stations during the respective events.
---
I think it's safe to say that lore friendly is less and less likely as this game progresses
---
Big Bend Tunnel and Point Pleasant are easy farms too
---
I wonder if we’ll be given fancy Ironlak or Montana Gold, or if BGS will stay old school and give us Krylon and Rusto?
---
Wet Look would put me over the moon.
---
I know it's better to drag it on but who the hell gets 3-4 level ups in 20 minutes!?!?!?!?
---
That dude totally released poisonous gas into the air destroying the toxic valley.
---
If you want fallout lore I suggest watching oxhorn on YouTube If I recall correctly he has a couple of videos explaining why Appalachia looks how it is and you can also find more fallout lore stuff on his channel like lore on the previous fallouts
---
I've got 2 of issue #4.
---
Only way is if they kill the budget in the camp... but they are to busy counting, and swimming in atom shop profits.
---
Define young and dumb.  The reason I am not in favor of Comunism, or of supposed Socialism which is in fact a thinly disguised Communism (as opposed to something more in line with attempts at actual Socialism constructed with safeguards against the pitfalls of instituting a Communist S/state) is much more to do with the fact that human nature inevitably causes individuals after their own interests to seize upon the power vacuum when each citizen is- at least when Communist theory is laid out on paper - equal.  As a purely intellectual exercise, it is in fact a very idyllic concept.  The failings of mankind make it difficult/untenable even on small scale, and a recipe for disaster when applied on the level of a Nation State.
---
TL:DR All animals are equal - but some animals are more equal than others.
---
Not in Fallout lol. Everyone went to war over scarce resources.
---
So what happens if no one your level tries to take it and you hold it all day?? What if others need or want that location?? Its easier to farm elsewhere and save yourself the heartache from pvp.
---
A cantaloupe.
---
Clearly
---
I found this story to be more akin to fo1 and 2... There is some campy stuff but a lot of it is real dark.
---
Heard story was kinda weak but not long after exploring it was pretty clear that was bogus.
---
Lmfao you're the epitome of a Reddit moment
---
Again just spit balling, doesn’t. have to come from the atomic shop but what’s more likely from Bethesda? They already added a fridge and a junk bot
---
Trader posts too are where I find it most prevalent. Always been laggy but this week has been way worse.
---
I don't deal enough dmg to the queen, it doesn't drop anything for me het :(
---
Already seen it back when it actually came out. Keep up soyboy
---
Must find way to relate argument with pop culture and favourite video games and movies.
---
Such is the way of the soyboy
---
You would rather have actual content hidden behind a paywall rather than optional clothing and weapon skins? Weird. To each their own...
---
I read everything you wrote. And your essay has nothing to do with the conversation at hand. Maybe you mean to be on a different thread.
---
Good. You agree with me then.
---
It’s extremely detailed.
---
Didn't play NV huh? That's sad.
---
Please do! It’s been almost 2 months I’ve had to store my JP torso. Extra 25 pounds just there. Smh
---
Point Pleasant has a lot and you can run through them quickly because they're low level. That's one of the areas I went to for those challenges and finished within a few hours. Good luck:)
---
&gt; anything critical of chinese government
---
I guess they'll have to just delete Fallout in general then
---
No. Bad Idea. I think new players are interested in playing the game the way it was designed.
---
sita alpha, bravo and charlie are usually full with schorched
---
if I remeber correctly I think I got it from Grahm
---
With my axe super mutants fall before the all mighty me lol nice I have a instagating explosive assault rifle is a beast in vats
---
We also have suits of power armor, hand held fusion power plants and weapons that shoot blobs of plasma. A scope that zooms seems like a hobbyist’s weekend project by comparison. 
---
I’m in full agreement.
---
That doesn't help.
---
Valley Galleria.
---
I can join if u guys want
---
Nope, The pipebolt and revolver can benefit from both. However the standard pipe can not.
---
Its part of the normal rewards for nuclear winter so it is not going away. Stuff like the VTU items like the tracksuit however were limited time.
---
I'd like a unique armor heavy metal piece from a challenge or something to be called Metallica 🤘 
---
Most of the unique weapon names are kind of stupid anyway...
---
I'm waiting for wastelanders as well, my vendors are full but there's nothing I want to buy with the caps earned. 
---
Might as well wait for something new to get.
---
Yeah I’m struggling to spend my caps and maxed out on 4 characters.
---
The White springs carpet was a limited atomic shop thing.
---
Gorilla and commando perks are for automatic weapons, bolt action is not aautomatic.
---
Excuse me but you sound stupid by asking.
---
Yes but it's not so useful imo
---
Does.the pipe bolt not have an automatic perk?
---
strongly agree with this one
---
Dude, go wiki what a bolt action means. This is really a stupid question.
---
Lemme guess, especially the "poorly optimized" part right lol
---
Like 13 Ultracite Leg plans for 200.
---
Like, geeze, thats 13 SBQ's minimum to get those, and clearly are not moving at 200....
---
I agree. There needs to be more enemies in certain places, enough that we should pause before engaging and ask ourselves “am I ready for this?” Nuke zones should also have more unique, and difficult bosses, just nuked Grafton? here’s a lvl 100 Grafton Abomination, Morgantown? lvl 100 Deathclaw Tyrant, every nuke zone should have a queen-like battle event that lets us feel like we accomplished something other than waste a nuke if it’s anywhere but prime or ws.
---
Now there’s the pot calling the kettle black...
---
...and now we’re at the Troll level with name calling.   
---
Man, where are these children’s parents?
---
Plus, borderlands weapons also have levels, so even if you get a bog standard shotgun chances are it's going to be nearly as good as the ultra rare you got ten levels ago
---
A pretty RED car... Get it? Eh?.. No....? :\[
---
I have 4 lol
---
yeah that too, especially how certain areas of the game can’t handle some settings on ‘very high’ and that’s been going on since launch, an example was morgantown, you’d get intense stuttering and even crashing if you had shadows on very high and still isn’t fixed, even though this is probably variable from what type of pc or console you are on, bethesda should still have optimised that area already.
---
Yes, even if we don't, I think they will say we did. This is just to keep us busy because they haven't fixed or added anything in almost a month.
---
Ok
---
Old wet and piping hot steaming garbage
---
Yeh it’s shitty to have stage one at 8 million, then find out that’s only a quarter of the second one. But hey, what did we expect. It’s Bethesda
---
You can test it yourself. I used to use plasma weapons on cliff watch where my base is, and unlooted goo piles don't de-spawn and stop that particular enemy from respawning. Regular meat piles don't stop respawning
---
Watch any captainoob video where he has to server jump when an area has its spawns squashed due to energy weapon use.  
---
Or play it yourself. Sometimes energy weapon corpses will turn into ash piles while you're looting them, and the ash piles will just have the infinite loading circle.  
---
This is why people who run WS nukes with energy weapons get shouted at.
---
Yeah saw lots of them tonight.

Nice, can I ask how?
---
Thanks for the detailed info. I rarely engage in PvP but am interested in what's going on behind the scenes.
---
Thank you friend :)
---
Sweet! Thank you.
---
Is healing factor widely used? Doesn't it impact drug use?
---
Some people aren't aware their weapon damage is crap against the queen because they have damage numbers off. Unless it is used with strangler heart set or for horde clearing, the explosive effect is barely contributing anything.
---
no, it's a common world spawn, worth 200 caps if someone want's to have it right away.
---
I like non power armor builds. Have a full set of marine sentinel+vanguard and love using the LMG. I have a Furious, Faster Fire Rate and Faster Reload LMG. I lean more towards the Damage Dealer role than anything else. I thank you for your detailed description and might go this route!
---
The LMG also has a different animation than the heavy minivans and 50cal which is totally lovely without PA!
---
I do recommend blueprinting a tower with 6x lvl 2 turrets for outside workshops; with Contractor perk it falls below workshop mat limit and will take care of most defense events sans high lvl supermutants. Saves a lot of time, if one takes workshops regularly.
---
The scorchbeast lore explains it. All the military research sites around Appalachia are the core of it. Basically, researchers created ultracite in a lab environment. Most likely a carbon ion with characteristics of glass. Seeing great military potential in it, they experimented with creating it in industrial amounts by detonating nukes in old coal mines, of which Virginia has a great many, converting coal deposits into ultracite. This caused geologic upheaval and also irradiated bats, possibly causing them to integrated ultracite into their genetic material. The more ultracite they absorb, the stronger they become. This is also a weakness for them since ultracite ammo does increased damage to them. 
---
This is at least the narrative I've formed in my head after reading lore in the Glassed Caverns and AMS headquarters etc.
---
I almost like they're based off a certain brand of ideology that's been known to only breed violence and hatred of others.
---
Look at it in terms of a single player game, that you pay full price for. You can buy Mothership Zeta for Fallout 3. Is that a "Paywall" in the sence that it is typically spoken about in the gaming community? No, because that's not content that could have been reasonably considered to be part of the base game.
---
So, being willing to pay for a DLC is not content hidden behind a paywall. Me not wanting to pay for clothing, armor, scrap-kits, guns and so forth, but INSTEAD would rather pay for a big, well made DLC full of things over scraps is not weird. It's weird that you think it's ok to have a shop inside your video game that you already paid for. Sure, it's online and they have to pay for the servers, but I'd also rather pay a fee to keep them going, than have a game cut into bits and sold to be part by part.  
---
Does no one here honestly remember "cosmetics" being free parts of the game that are actually important to, say, Role Playing Games? Where you can play a role, but in this case, pay more for shit that was in previous games AS PART OF ITS BASE GAME. Fallout 76 SELLS YOU THING that were IN FALLOUT 4 FOR FREE, sorry, not free, they were part of the damn game you paid for.
---
&gt; Say I have a car for sale. I tell you if you drive me to work every day for a month, you can have the car for free! If you want the car now and don’t want to drive me, you can pay me $20,000. 
---
This, is what I initially adressed in a tiny part of my initial post, sorry, I did go off on a tangent for most all of my post, that was a gripe about another comment that is, in a way, related. I may have not explained myself properly. But What I said, in other words, was;
---
The Car isn't free, that's not only time used up, but you would also charge for the privilage to be able to drive you to work (game entry fee, as in buying the game). Driving you to work, as you say, isn't free in that metaphor. Because I asked, who paid for the fuel, the insurance on another driver, the car insurance, maintanence etc. Besides, ignoring those petty nit-picks at the metaphor, if you were to make it more accurate, it would be that you require more and more rides with each chunk of value you are willing to take away from the car.  
---
Or better yet, if you owned a shop to sell cars and you said "Drive me to work every day for X days and a car of Y value is yours" But that was a one off, each time they wanted a car, or new tires, wheels, engine parts etc, they HAD to go through YOU and each time you would require more and more of their time, because you would "give" less value to them each time. (AKA Atoms slow down over time, thus eventually it comes to a crawl).  
---
Again, sorry for going off on a tangent, but I was trying to cover more than one issue in a post.
---
Better yet i say just add atoms into the loot drop tables for all public events with a flag for your account that makes it so you can only get that drop every so often to prevent constant farming. 
---
Like the low level events everyone mostly skips could only reward a very small amount of atoms on top of the normal loot. 
---
And the big high level events like SBQ, and fighting the Imposter Sheepsquatch could have a chance of dropping a large amount of atoms.  (when i say large i mean like between thirty to maybe fifty or sixty if you get blessed by RNGesus) 
---
Make it so you can only get one atom drop of each amount every whatever amount of days and boom you just made every event in the game much more attractive to every player.
---
My game freezes up like 1-2x a day while in my pip boy. Pretty sure it’s always while consuming food or drink. I have to force quit the game with task manager and restart.
---
I assumed it was related to the latest driver update I installed, because it started happening after that.

I'm new to the game, but if it's ANY scorched on the map, then I've done my small part. :) I've been farming a mine for Combat Shotgun and rifle parts while leveling up trying to hit 30. I hope we all hit it!

If you have yet to find it. It's Grafton town (Not Station) and Camden bots, not Charleston.

IIRC I think you can also go Whitesprings.

If she has a spare PC overseas with a decent internet connection and a MacBook Pro that has Ethernet, or for the new ones, dongle with it.

(WiFi works as-well, but it can get a bit laggy sometimes, so I’d recommend Ethernet)

Then...
---
There is a free program called “Parsec”. It lets you stream your PC screen to MacBook. It has a lot less latency than TeamViewer, because it is made directly for gaming. And has a controller support if you would need that.

I travel a bit, so this program is a great way to access my PC from any given location using Mac.

You do realize that communism is about worker owned means of production right? Also you know, following the principles of the labor theory of value, which kinda means sweatshops can't exist in communism.

That's actually a really cool idea!

Collision course event in Morgantown airport: procced by proximity, scorched, rare and expensive weapon plans as reward (walking cane mods, lead linen boxing glove etc)?

You can get the full plan for free without killi the queen so it’s not even worth 200 😂

Can you not read, i have already stated in a past commebt on this same chain that liberty prime does not ever mention capitalism, it mentions democracy which is compmetely different from capitalism.

If you fight for democracy you are fighting for peoples rights to choose a government and a way of life, if you fight for capitalism you are fighting for corporations and the rich
---
Lack of content. Nuke runs and the SBQ only go so far. I’m staying away until Wastelanders. In the meantime, I’m playing the new ghost recon and borderlands 3 right now.
---
Fully modified (with BoS mods) set of heavy combat armor gives you 226 DR and 266 ER. Fully modified scout set (with Polymer mods) gives you 260DR and around 180 ER (don't remember exact numbers). So it's your choice which to choose.

I wish they'd add the greenhouses like at the Vault-Tec agriculture place in Flatwoods as a wall/roof option, they already look like they're made to be part of the walls and roofs anyway!

What's the best roll/effects for a cryolator?
---
Nothing to do. Nothing to buy. No one else playing. I 've been following politics.
---
Ok thx . I was not sure
---
Cause they are mostly a massive ball ache. 
---
If you’re playing on X-box, let me know and I’ll hook you up for these type of challenges.
---
This would be far more doable if we could change swap perk sets easily. But until that happens, people are going to roll with specific weapons for nearly all occasions.
---
If the weapon has a bolt it stops being automatic and becomes semi auto, thus losing commando ability. If you wanna utilize both you need a fully auto pistol.
---
Liberty prime was right all along
---
Lol that sounds like fun.
---
Is ghost recon any good? Tempted to get it but cod out next week so thinking of saving my money.
---
I play lots off different times of the day and it’s busier in the day when you’d assume not as many ppl playing.
---
I'm using gunslinger x2 wtih Junkies (5 addictions) pistols and I always need my J Gatling Gun to handle big boys. my AAE .44 is subpar too.
---
But! from what I've heard pistols use a really low amount of AP so lads combine it with vats crits perks to have a crit-gunslinger build. I haven't tried that yet, but from what I've seen so far, pistols can be good sidearms/low level mob handlers but not your mains.
---
But! x2, I expect Beth to release a balance patch before WL to address myriad of problems along with OP builds and nerfed ones (former bloody latter shotties/pistols). so if I were you I'd not scrip my good pistols just yet
---
I actually quite like it when a 3* legendary drops me a 1* hunters rolling pin..
---
Don’t forget to mine that Ultracite Ore at Fissure Sites to get a wave of Scorched coming your way!
---
I don’t understand why people play things they hate, and which are a ridiculous, tedious grind, and then complain that it sucks.
---
Well the game is poorly optimized, try changing the shadows settings.
---
Nope but If to kill someone you get caps based on their level up to level 50
---
If you attack them or return fire it is possible. Also they can get some of your caps that way. Be sure to have pacifist enabled if you don't want to engage in PvP.
---
I think all power armor looks the same when it has a rider skin on. As for wallpaper does go on all the normal walls including metal, but special "walls" like powered doors cannot get wallpaper.
---
It’s an opinion... If you don’t want to fight others, turn Pacifist on, otherwise it will happen!
---
I’m finally getting round to playing We Happy Few while I wait for the Halloween mischief event week to begin
---
All challenges should  be completable without having to keep jumping servers.
---
Can confirm the PA answer. No idea on wallpaper.
---
I play first thing in the morning and yes you’re right best time to hit a lot of places. I’ve got dense plans coming out my ears as I know there rare but always at the vendor when I log on.
---
MATN's play through he did a vats crit pistol build that seemed powerful.
---
Are there any guaranteed junkie drops in the game? Dor a quest or something?
---
Hmm no I have it in Fullscreen. In borderless it sets it to constant 11 FPS.
---
Well yeah I was playing at medium settings but still I got sometimes about 40-60 FPS.
---
I guess I need to check those tweaks and NCP again, just can't be that it runs so bad. I wonder how those benchmarkers managed to get that good performance
---
Both perks?
---
Thx for the suggestion, i will check it out later
---
I know it's poorly optimized but I don't think changing shadow settings may increase CPU/GPU usage...Guess that brings me some more FPS at most
---
Well not end game to you fker but for us vets the enemies scale to our lvl except when a low lvl is in the area. Anyone can tell you that.
---
There is no need for pictures. It looks the same on all PA. It's just a skin.
---
nope not that I know of but I reckon lads sell 1*-2* junkies guns pretty cheaply
---
No, all Rider skins changes completely look of PA, NO MATTER on what PA type you apply it - my alt has Excavator for situations when I'm over encumbered and yesterday I've changed it's look to Black Rider - it looks exactly like on screens.
---
I can 1 hit 3* gouls when sneaking but can only do it with my mutated meat hook.
---
I have an enclave-themed rifleman / commando. I don't run junkies, mostly furious and almost all energy weapons. 
---
Will find a build link and post it. I don't want to do junkies there because of the thematics. An instigating gauss and a quad gauss take care of any pve generally. Teslas for tagging (have furious and two shot) and a plasma flamer for melting (furious).
---
Also have a quad cryo for tech needs, but rarely use it anymore. Plasma has limb damage secondary iirc.
---
Usually only about 1/10 things you see in concept art ever makes it to the final release.
---
Well the combat and pump shotgun have silencers they reduce the range but work.
---
Lol now I look like a chump but I did give you an upvote though
---
Probably try the market sub. But the ones you have are the most common, the other masks (sun, goblin, etc..) those are EXTREMELY rare and I have never seen one posted for sale, I’ve only seen screenshots of them 1 time on Xbox
---
I'll be on later man if you wanna play. I have a couple more spots I can show you and I have to make your build for you.
---
You must be new here.
---
Thanks man, we should privately text somewhere though.
---
Is it also tied to your character as I have seen players offering weapons and armour that have never dropped for me eg Sentinel.
---
I always seem to get suppressor stuff and as I am a bloodied build I do get some bloodied weapons but nothing to write home about and I get plenty of armour drops so I am thinking some players have a certain type of whatever ayyached to their build, would that be correct!!!
---
This is a multiplayer spinoff. I’m not reading all of that, sorry. 
---
If you actually read what you wrote (clearly you did not) you’ll see I think atom proves are to expensive. My point was we were having the wrong concesión. Now we REALLY are having the wrong conversation.

Yeah idk if it's a glitch or patched but pipe pistols have always bee. able to do this. Just no pipe bolt action or revolvers
---
Thanks, I cleared it out on my pc and it works fine now
---
Yeah I’ve been disconnected twice in the last 30 minutes.
---
I've got no idea what you're getting at. are you for or against 1 shotting legendarys?
---
Yes and the way this game did it in the early stages was totally ok, its meant to be slightly more casual so the slap damage ment that players have an option to run away or switch server or have pacifist on the only change i would have made would be make peoples camps immortal vs players when they are in pacifist - so then that keeps everyone happy but instead the snowflakes decided to ruin the game for players who want to approach this game differently. My most exciting experiences in the game was fighting and hunting some well known griefers, there wasn’t even many of them but they all left once the wanted system got removed and after the ass sent nerf now all i can do is kill people at workshops
---
It does the first time you apply it but then if you change it, it doesn’t remove everything.
---
Crack open a cold can of calcium boys
---
Against. Sorry thought the first paragraph implied that :) I’m against 1 shotting legendaries at events when there are many players there to participate. I am just against the idea some are trying to push letting everyone receive a legendary no matter what for the reasons I put
---
Check this out.. Built a wall. Added my pink wallpaper. Changed the wall to a window and now I got wooden wallpapering that I haven't purchased.
---
I was gonna do this myself one day. Looks pretty good, now we just need robot butler's.
---
Better dailies &gt; login chores.

ESO was ruined for me by the way the login rewards make it feel like a required task (and the fact that they penalize you if you miss a day, but that's a whole other discussion). I'd hate to see Fallout 76 go that same route.
---
That has some great shots so thank you. But that was on the X-01 not excavator thx anyway

I know, but people don't seem to like the BoS questline...

Pretty much anything a pistol can do, a rifle can do better.
---
No. What I’m saying is why would anyone bother doing anything if you’re guaranteed a legendary. XP isn’t anything to worry about. I have 97 unused levels and I have a small amount compared to some. Condition of weapons isn’t a big deal to most either. Why use any resources that you have if I can watch some level 5’s try to kill a 90+ sheepsquatch? It will be more entertainment watching them scream for help then helping to kill it. They die, fast travel away because it’s a lost cause for them and there’s the free junk and they have less of everything than when they started. Same with doing the SBQ, shit if you get rewards I’m going to put full chameleon on my level 1 and just chill there while I go get some lunch or what ever. Check back, collect my rewards and wait again.
---
Idk how much will really change besides robots going poof as humans take there place.
---
I don’t really understand the point of this post, is it to say people shouldn’t one shot legendaries, or is it to tell everyone how you like to let low levels die and take their junk? Seems like the latter
---
These will give "raiders" another story to play. Until raiders get overwhelming powerful n the game gets unplayable.
---
anyone who agrees with this is a racist chauvinist pig pushing state department propaganda for free

Possibly because I have more money than you.

It's looks exactly the same on every PA since its a model change and not a reskin
---
That is something to think about, I don't think there is any other way to install updates unless we can download an update package or something.
---
Just dont answer if u gonna be a bitch..
---
-1 shotting = BAD, not very nice
---
-Change implemented so everyone gets legendaries (solution to 1 shotting) = BAD not a fix to 1 shotting
---
-Everyone gets a legendary just for showing up = more greifing and posts here crying about it
---
-Low level players dying because they can’t handle the event level = stolen junk (because they typically carry everything they find) wasted aid, no ammo, etc.
---
Here are the cliff notes for you...
---
NW is not going away, survival mode is.
---
I'm sorta like this:
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4f758a7&amp;d=a72a04c72eh2lt2a80p02a30ep1ic4pd2pk2pl2pp2s12l71sg2ek1cu0lv0lr0sb0&amp;w=&amp;m=4cfa501&amp;nw=&amp;n=Jenniecide](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4f758a7&amp;d=a72a04c72eh2lt2a80p02a30ep1ic4pd2pk2pl2pp2s12l71sg2ek1cu0lv0lr0sb0&amp;w=&amp;m=4cfa501&amp;nw=&amp;n=Jenniecide)
---
At the queen, the tesla spam while mobs are around and then swapping to plasma gets very decent damage numbers ... use plenty of VATS, crit, sneak and headshot. You have enough points to move things around if you need ... and even go bloodied (that was my goal - I want my SPECIAL set up so I can switch). This means you can go Adrenaline 1 / Covert 3 if you choose.
---
Again, I'm using Furious Teslas (only use the two-shot for tagging at events), Furious Plasma Flamers and Gauss Rifles. I have others as I mentioned.
---
I don't run vanguard - but I do run all-scout armor Sentinel. I've got a near-full Troubleshooter set (face tank ISS FTW) but often run 1 chameleon, 1 regen. I find vanguard underwhelming ... when you need it most, it's weaker.
---
I go back and forth on healing factor, it's on right now and it's great but since I don't run Class Freak I have to watch it. I try to carry serums to offset the negative, but if you're not into that level of micromanagement, maybe not a good option. For this character I don't mind - I use psychotats and calmex quite a bit as well. 
---
============
---
For most powerful though, I do think Heavy / PA is easy button (Junkie). The addictions basically don't bother you at all.
---
I'm still probably 1/2 damage or 1/3 damage of my bloody commando though ... that thing is just a beast.
---
The Order of Mysteries plotline was one of the best of the entire Fallout series. Given the fact it was told *without* interacting with NPC's was all the more impressive.
---
There are many posts, just yesterday as a matter of fact, where people state that in an event, legendaries should drop loot everyone at the event. So yes there are posts wanting zero effort, what I said isn’t irrelevant.
---
What I’m saying here is before people wish for something they should remember what can happen. The first paragraph says from my option it is a dick move to 1 shot, and give nobody else a chance. 
---
As for your edit, I’m only writing text. You can read it in what ever tone you think is appropriate. I have done the same with yours and can also say you’re standoffish and ignorant yourself, if I read it the wrong way.
---
Officially playstation said they will accept crossplay but it needs to be programed into the game first. I think they released a statement about it a few days ago (?)
---
The best are people that don’t participate or fast travel in just to sprint to the legendary wendigo boss and one shot it while the rest of us burn up a bunch of ammo fighting off the mobs inside.  
---
Yeah eff those people.  And if I see you pull that crap you best guarantee I will be PvPing you the first chance I get.
---
Hopefully, I've heard nothing but problems with PC and the griefers/dupers and I was happy to be safe on the ps4 servers
---
But why post anything at all? Who are you trying to convince and what are you trying to convince them of? To stop complaining?
---
LOL eventually all players will reach Y2.... but by your argument NW also splits the comunity... just like survival... I actually think it is a good ideia sicne spliting the comunity seems to help stabilize server...
---
Wait for a double xp weekend and grind the shit out of it if you really dont like it focus on staying alive rather than killing everybody
---
Why not use railings?
---
Yet
---
Thank you.
---
Please revisit the last reply to you. 2nd paragraph 1st sentence. If you don’t know what it refers to please revisit original post, the last 2 paragraphs.
---
I’m pretty certain I’ll be hitting the enemy whether you choose to melee or not.  That’s what my non explosive vampire auto handmade with FFR is for. Perfect in tight spaces with lots of players around. 
---
And if you choose to be a tool and hog the XP and block others then I’ll simply switch over to my BE primed auto handmade and that will quickly resolve the issue.
---
Why do you enter if it’s locked? I don’t understand. What are you trying to say? What is the post even for?
---
Honestly I think it needs to get worse before Beth will even contemplate to make it better.
---
Until Beth decides to actually check for cheats and not just for a few memory tools, I stay away from NW.
---
Get Hard Bargain 3 - it almost doubles what vendors pay you
---
Drink a beer (gives +1 CHA) before selling (approx +10%)
---
Do a run through White Springs picking up everything. Or one of the other locations suggested.
---
Simpler way with less running around would be to get the Marine Helmet plan and craft “helmets” to sell to vendors (3 Rubber + 1 plastic + 1 glass  = 25-32 caps)
---
Or get the civil war top hat or civil war coat plans. 
---
(Don’t forget to use Super Duper perk when crafting)
---
Or, least time consuming option, save up and buy a mutation recepie at the bunker.  Craft 3-4 serums and sell to robot vendors for 400-500 each
---
You want people to stop complaining, right. But why even post?
---
Since I needed new freinds I thought was was a better way to make new freinds then join a clan. So now I'm in the Brotherhood of Steel
---
Just as I wrote on your post..Why even post what you did? I don’t understand what you mean? Was it a complaint? Why post anything...
---
l suppose it needs to be spelled out, apparently: to encourage gameplay; it's actually a basic marketing concept. 
---
Do you honestly believe that the community downed a _half million_ Scorchbeasts for the previous installment? Bethesda presents a goal so the community feels like they're contributing to the advancement of said goal, which means their motivation is to continue play. You'll likely continue playing the game even if there were no such challenge, but believing that your participation is crucial to "unlocking" certain rewards will keep you playing longer than if there were no motivations. It's essentially an extension of the daily/weekly challenges, which provide the same kind of motivation to continue play, especially for end-gamers. However, the daily/weekly challenges can generally be met, which is why their rewards are small. Does this concept  not make sense to you now?
---
Are you saying that all the armour models look identical with it &amp; you cannot actually tell who is wearing X-01 &amp; who is wearing Excavator? If so I'm going to dig a hole of stupid &amp; sit in it
---
You went back to my old, lighthearted post to make some condescending comment? Showed me good. I posted that because i wanted peoples thoughts on me finding ways into their bade, you posted this to put people down who don't like your playstyle. Whatever man, have fun
---
Go in the pipes under Mama Dolce, the ones the lead to the commie outpost, and hide there. It's a central enough place that often lets you survive the first few storms, plus if anyone should have the same idea as you the courtyard of VTU is full of containers so you can defend the place.
---
Won't someone please think of the ammo!? It doesn't want to be wasted.
---
I love this comment!
---
I play nearly every day.. xbox wouldn't mind someone to run with have and alt that lvl 42 and main is 200 and something. Gt same as here
---
They're just using an isolated case a chance to get a closer gripe at HK, I think you know your central government very well unless you're a commie supporter.
---
Thanks
---
Exactly
---
I'm at work, but I'm keen to see the video - I've done SBQ runs hundred of times, but you never know if you'll learn something new ;)
---
Say what you want about the gradually worsening server stability and microtransactions, but the lore, story and world design is the best I've seen in a Bethesda made Fallout!
---
The raider skin looks identical on all power armour, I use it on my excavator and (used to use it on)  t-60 and you would not be able to tell the difference.  
---
I’ll boot up the Xbox now and take some pics :)
---
Hit the middle button. Then left bumper a few times. Should be a thing that says looking for group. Just creat a post and people should be able to join off your profile
---
... okay, sure I hope people feel bad when I let them take a shot on an enemy? But you too, have fun playing
---
You can spend through 20 boiled waters and 100 .308s in literally no time at all. No new player would be forced to accept any gifts, I doubt many would refuse. Sounds like it would really suck to be your kids lol
---
If you die you pay them for it..is why I'm passive.
---
I feel like alot of people are imaging this as some huge invasive thing when it could only be like one little indicator at the top of the screen or something
---
Because its harmless and fun finding a way in, im trying to say that if you want to keep me out you shouldnt put interactable objects near windows, this post is a conversation piece /psa.
---
“Eventually all players will reach year 2”... except you know... new players who buy the game who will then join an empty world because everyone is on year 2. And nuclear winter is a bit different in the sense they are short matches that people will pop into and include a subset of players who are not interested in open world and only want NW. So yes it does split player base but much less so. I think survival and adventure is a better example and we see what happened to survival.
---
It works for Elder Scrolls Online, the daily/weekly rewards in 76 are so meager and often complex to pull off I don't even bother!
---
I did this quite early on but got fed up of the shit stairs placement. It’d be greater in FO4!
---
SBQ has 32k health, when she goes down to 16k, she regens, so you need tp deal about 48k total damage to kill her. Question is how much damage you deal per shot.
---
Yes, an empty world... Full of low levels... Like the Y1 should be... What a bad experience...
---
Seeing this is making me realise that I probably pissed a lot of players off, thanks for the info!
---
She used to take double damage if staggered in the sky, shame they patched that...
---
Do the Four Rider Power Armor skins count as costumes for the event?
---
Hey man it’s all a learning curve! Im sure one day someone will discover an even more efficient way to fight the queen that Outranks my guide. Glad I could help you out!
---
Let me know what you think! The video could have been made better but the information I present is as solid as it comes
---
Ive never used energy weapons seriously. But i know you can craft High Voltage Hefefe. Its beer so not a drug but it does boost your energy weapons.  There are also a few junk yard workshops you can claim and live in.
---
Thank you, I am now digging a hole... I await piccys :)
---
I am now digging the hole.... also you are lovely
---
Heavy guns almost useless against the queen? Well that's not true. And the guy using the handmade had the infinite AP glitch was able to vats forever. I'm pretty sure that was patched out too.
---
Awesome! Alcohol is technically a drug so that fits. I found a junk pile in the north west corner of the map that is like a small landfill/dump I've moved into. I'm more curious about perk cards and special build cause this whole thing works different now.
---
in 3-5 weeks?
---
In general a very useful guide and very well explained. 
---
 I disagree with some things however, that's mainly because I believe melee weapons belong in elder scrolls.
---
Considering it pretty much always takes longer to launch a nuke than kill the Queen I don't see much of a difference between a 2 minute fight and 10 minute fight in the grand scheme of things. 
---
Bloodied heavy weapons maxed out and in nerd rage with constant headshots can take out the Queen quickly, and I've never had a problem getting her to land using the perk to cripple her wings. my FFR 50 cal always had her health bar falling very nicely. 
---
Now I just use a bloodied primed handmade that's hitting for almost 200 damage a shot to the head, and aslong as there's a couple other people with semi decent weapons about its still a fast fight. 
---
I wouldn't be disappointed if someone turned up with a boring melee weapon and destroyed the Queen in 4 swipes, but also I enjoy the longer fights with everyone working together.
---
older Fallout games had low-int dialogue options, maybe something similar could be implemented for Super Human characters too?
---
when the door doesn't open for someone just have them get out of the cave and back in. This solves the issue everytime for us.
---
Can you use it on all characters on account at the same time, &amp; on all their armour sets (if they have more than one each)?
---
I won't probably rate it's 'artistic values', rather usability, so don't worry about the form. I'm not an expert, but across almost 550 levels on my 2 characters I've done quite a lot of fights, some really unusual (the funniest were when SBQ turned into green goo pile, before they've fixed that - to loot her some guy moved his camp and build high stairs that allowed players, one at a time, jump with jetpacks and loot her in the air).
---
It only works if you have enough low levels playing consistently. We hve no idea the dispersion of levels during any given time of day. Again, splitting the base makes the servers more and more sparse. 
---
Listen- I agree this would be awesome in an ideal world, where there are unlimited players and thousands joining daily. I just don’t think that’s realistic.
---
It takes me 15 minutes to launch a nuke, I do that for all three nukes and then hop servers and rinse and repeat, queens for me usually take 2 minutes if nobody shoots her in the air. 
---
I respect your opinion but trust what I say in the video
---
Saving up 1000 scrip, I will get a bloodied fixer in the 23 weapons 1150 scrip will get me surely 😂
---
I appreciate that, can I ask what you're farming for? What's the end goal? As for me, the rewards seem underwhelming.
---
Would be nice but loading screens sometimes take longer than that and you can be dead anyway!
---
That was me using the handmade, didn’t even realise I had the ap glitch when recording footage, was a bit of a happy coincidence lol
---
Trust me man compare a prime Gatling plasma to a prime non automatic handmade whilst sneak vatsing, as I said it was “pretty much” useless when compare to the better options - more so for the fact that it give you the audio glitches. Thanks for watching appreciate the feedback!
---
Jesus, am I the only fucker who is tired of all these 'warriors' who 'stand' with HK? Fuck man, go post on a news site or something. I for one, wish our Chinese overlords the best in their endeavors.
---
F'ing robot leg plans. 27 hrs later...
---
Yeah it happened to me yesterday. It's annoying but a very easy fix.
---
Fissure sites, The Glassed Cavern, Morgantown Airport all spring to mind.
---
The lag has gotten so much worse on PS4, the beta ran smoother than this!
---
Try to get your hands on a junkies laser gun. It gets more powerful the more withdrawl effects you have.  Also once you are a high enough level grab the chemist perk. Douple all drugs you craft. And im not sure if there is a better build but unyeilding might do you good.
---
The two amusement parks and Helvetia are pretty good. I mean, not 14 million good, but...
---
Im really just rolling the dice hoping to get good legendaries, but I farm the flux and repair kits so I can create prime ammo.... sounds pretty sad when you type it down lmao we need more end game content
---
Valley galaria
---
You also crash for trying to leave it!
---
They could build it like zombies for COD. Waves of mutants attacking as the world outside burns. Like the shop keeper from Underworld described in Fallout 3
---
A fight like that should drop multiple 3* legendary items.
---
That would get me interested in grinding it.
---
Yes, or at the very least a guaranteed three star
---
Uranium Feever is shit anyway, all I ever get is 1 lv 40 1star drop!
---
No survival mode so I'm taking a break. I'll dip back in for mischief night and wastelanders. I dont know if I'll stick around long though unless they add back some kind of open PVP.
---
Bend tunnel
---
I liked the curved metal walls from Fallout 4. They were sections of aircraft fuselage.
---
I have a "raider" PvP guy. I built my camp near the top of the world because there is a lot of debris around the outskirts, and I crafted random piles of appliances around to make it look like I'm some sort of scavenger as well. It's also a junkies/explosive heavy weapons build and I wreck pretty much anything I come across, and probably 85% of people I engage. People say rifle is the PvP meta, but I have pretty good luck with my heavy gunner. Rifles will be the way for you to go as of now though because you get the Laser Rifle, Plasma Rifle, Tesla Rifle, and Gauss Rifle. Pistols is a bit more limited and much weaker. Heavy gunners have Plasma Gatlings, Laser Gatlings, Cryolaters, and the Flamer. Whatever you choose will work well with 5 addictions if you have a junkies weapon.
---
I did this once, kitchen and everything, but i did it with warehouse walls. Very cool!
---
I get that ut has lore im just to lazy to read and listen to it. Probably just gonna watch oxhorn or something.
---
P.S. High Voltage Hefe will help pump out extra damage, as well as magazines, bobble heads, etc. Buy those from peoples vendors when you see a price you like.
---
As a fellow player pointed out in this thread:

Riverside Manor has a good number both inside and outside and every time you as much as sneeze in the general vicinity of the cell they respawn.
---
I took on a molerat horde in the Savage Divide once. Started the mission. Walked round a rock looking for the chief rat. Saw him. Shot him. Over in two seconds.
---
I feel that people who say or think this game has a bad story have just played other good games with a good story ex. Elder scrolls, other fallout games. The beef witth other people was lack of npcs, but we are getting them now so people really can bitch at this point.(Just my opinion)
---
We talking places you can build your camp or places you can walk through?
---
I made one in FO 4. I'd post a link but Im on mobile and it doesn't seem to want to let me. But you can check out my YouTube channel to see it. Same name.

I just recently got back in the game.....I had no clue that I shouldn't shoot the bitch in the air.

This is really spot on

Megaton House was best Fallout House
---
I will still use my ultracite gat laser,because i like it,it's fun,does the job,and i don't care if she dies in 2 seconds or 10 minutes.
---
Hey that’s what I’m here for, glad to pass the info along
---
Yeah i we get crossplay then i hope it is just between the two console versions as i definitely do not want it with PC due to m&amp;k, increased fps, different settings and the hackers/modders etc.
---
Maybe a stupid question but do we still have the whole monday or does it stop somewhere during the monday?
---
I play so I don’t have to follow politics. Sometimes total escapism is necessary.
---
site alpha, bravo and charlie are always full with them, at least everytime i visit one off them.
---
Use what you want mate, I only mentioned heavy weapons because of the audio glitch that they create. 
---
If you change your mind I’d be happy to show you how to be more effective in queen fights, because I’m guessing the people that launch the nukes do care if it takes 2 seconds or 10 minutes
---
wait, so you don't like getting 20 atoms to take a picture of a Flatwoods monster in the middle of a nuke zone while you are naked, starving, dehydrated, mutated, while engaged in PVP?
---
Ok thx man
---
I predict we get the rewards, regardless (or at the very least, a "consolation" prize). With all the hype, I don't believe Bethesda is going to purposely deny us the carrot they've been holding in front of us.
---
This and it’d be nice if the notes had a plain text version you could switch to like your pipboy. 
---

Fallout is a post-nuclear wasteland. The Sino-American was ended in nuclear fire in 2077. This game is set 25 years later. Hong Kong is likely rubble and ghouls.
---
Yea. I don't bother trying to fight the Queen around V9 anymore. It's just not worth people standing ontop of the bunker and messing things up. I'd rather nuke it in a way that V9 is in the zone and make it so the fight happens just north of the sundew forest down there by fissure site prime. Less trenches and a ton of flat terrain right down there too.
---
There's heaps of wave defence events, they just suck because they dont spawn enough enemies.
---
Tried crafting, still got nothing. even with the perk on
---
Thanks for all the tips i appreciate that
---
This sounds awesome. Taking about enclave. Who do you think is better for humanity? Brotherhood or Enclave?
---
Did you miss the part about how spontaneously building a window doesn't impact it tho
---
&gt;anti armor/executioner/vampire

---
sounds absolutely terrific. I’ve got so many decisions to make!
---
Pistols suck. Don't use those. Use the laser / plasma / telsa *rifles*. Automatic.

[Junkies commando build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f658b8&amp;d=sg2pg2pp2ph2pi2eg1e00c72a72a04lu2l71lt2a12i12es2cu0ic4po2&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=)
---
Here's a sample build.
---
* No stealth as you can't silence energy weapons.
---
* Vats didn't feel... flavorful so nothing in there.
---
* Obviously un-equip Chem Resistant when you're gaining your addictions. Then slot it in so you don't pick up any more that you don't want.
---
* Junkies stacks to five... so you have to pick 5x chems to be addicted to. Check out u/Yabone 's  [Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bclykn/yabs_junkie_guide_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) for an excellent overview of Junkies in general.
---
*  Gunsmith will stay equipped since energy weapons break so fast.
---
* Lot's of points dumped into survivability. No one likes to die.
---
* Get the BOS lab coat, or another one, and some coke bottle glasses.
---
I can't even imagine what I'd look like if mutations changed your appearance. I've got 8 of them.
---
Haha that i did not, maybe that one I’d attempt for fun bc it sounds fun, but i didn’t even get a backpack yet bc the collections weren’t triggering events right, i put the game down so as to come back refreshed later. With positivity, i love this game, and Bethesda for taking the shitstorm on to make like 3 whole people happy!
---
Good on them, keep up the community everyone!
---
Haha yes that damn knight Moreno! It’s all up to personal preference , I’ve launched everywhere on the fissure site prime so many times and I’ve found with all my testing v9 is the most consistent for her to land (when people aren’t fucking about shooting her lol)
---
Congratulations on reaching a whole 30fps.
---
I really would just liek more "Locations" open up more houses. Maybe do some more home bunkers that are smaller.   Locations to load into like under the Food Event. I just want more places.   Also more Horde enemies. Like larger groups that cant be taken down alone
---
Point pleasant has a great very effective number of 1 shot scorched.
---
Actually, the Scorchbeasts were created by the enclave, and deployed to increase the defcon level. But other than that, yeah, im pretty sure you're right.
---
Very hyped for it! I have the Mothman paint job on my PA so I might buy the Mothman mask for the events
---
Ok that took way longer than I thought it would [here’s ](https://imgur.com/a/8ZoVaGG) some pics, I did take a little video but it won’t download :(
---
You can use the skin on multiple armours at once and with each character, same as other atomic shop items :D
---
I agree, i was blown away by how in-depth the lore on all the various factions got, despite them all being extinct. I hope they do end up making it canon that we/the new settlers end up rebuilding some of these organizations, because I feel like it’d be such a waste for groups like the Responders to just die out forever.
---
What’s happening? Is it an event or something?
---
Sorry for the late follow up. But it's easier for me to show in game rather than providing links. And I saw that someone linked a video.
---
Is the bed that get you stuck still there?
---
Read the latest inside the vault ! :)
---
New halloween themed seasonal event. Coming sometime soon
---
Washout is a better acid farm
---
I have a powerline tower camp (in the forest), pretty much for the same reason.
---
The framework of the tower can get in the way of placing both walls and floors. 
---
If you want your first floor to be the same size as the width of the tower, be aware the closer you are to square with the tower, the easier it will be to place the floor.  (The build system will allow some overlap of the tower framework and a floor piece, but too much angle it'll deny placement.)  THis can be difficult to get right, as the first "tier" of the tower is 2 staircases + a 4' or so tall foundation to get up to the first tier of the tower.
---
  If your foundation piece is not square with the tower, then neither is your stairscase or the floor you want to build.  Took me several attempts to get this close enought to place the floor.
---
Since the tower frame angles inward as it rises, if your you want your floor to be the same width as the tower, placement of walls can be tricky, and a roof is amost impossible.
---
This is especailly true if the floors are too far off square with the tower itself.
---
Additionally, make sure the floor pieces are oriented the same direction (it will make life easier later)  
---
Once you place the first floor piece, you will not be able to move your staircase.
---
Even if you add a second set of staircases from the ground to the the first floor, you cannot remove the 1st set of stairs. You'll get the "no support" error
---
THre is a height limit.  effectively, 3 staircases + 1 wall; can't go higher than that
---
Thank you so much. I am buying, that is properly lovely
---
the rare fasnacht masks better be rewards.
---
I saw that house and didn't even realize that's what it was.
---
I have noticed this as well. I took a bit of a break from playing and have slow started coming back but definitely seems like the player numbers have dropped. 
---
Lack of content is probably part of it but i think the bigger issue is the recent changes.
---
First survival is gone which means all those   griefers are either going to move onto other games or start screwing with people in adventure. Im sure 
---
griefers have probably chased away a few new and  veteran players. Workshops always had its issues with trolls but now its not even worth it most of the time.  
---
Second the new event system has pretty much screwed up a lot of fan favorites. Uranium fever and one violent night especially. Its hard to enjoy the events when people either blaze through the event or one shot everything that moves. It was a problem before the new system but with the new system dragging in half the server to one event. Most the time its not even worth it.  
---
Iv just gotten to a point in the game where when i do play most of my enjoyment comes from helping lower level players.
---
This. You get way more XP for time spent alive than you do racking up kills. Just spend most of the game hiding in bushes and playing glorified hide and seek and only attack people when they’ve spotted you, that’s the way i do it.
---
I often mention during the SBQ fight in area chat that people need to stop shooting/staggering her in the air.  People don’t listen or care.  I just wait patiently and kill adds until she lands.  Not much you can do when people are purposely stupid.
---
New Vegas was my favorite, but I still don't  think that was a part of the lore. Also, New Vegas came from a different developer.
---
When he suggests that he’s talking to “I guess.... no one”, he couldn’t have known how true his words would ring.....
---
Why some players insist on making him talk over and over just to annoy the other dozen around is beyond my understanding. 
---
It’s the second most annoying thing in the game, just after the guy that sprints into the train station and immediately starts hitting you while you’re trying to sell a pile of junk.  
---
With survival being shut down, the influx of players that enjoy harassing others has become a legitimate problem in adventure. Not saying that all pvp folks are the same, only that a certain segment is having a hard time finding an outlet for their spazzy brand of antisocialism.
---
Says a lot when a post apocalyptic radioactive hellhole is a more enjoyable world than the nightmare we’re living in.
---
Nothing worse than people doing this on purpose !! That’s when you find there camp and send the next nuke towards them.... you know.... to experiment if it’s a good flux farming area....
---
Bloodied 50 cal I'm getting more damage than the handmade. My group gets between 100-180 damage per hit. Getting more damage and faster fire rate.
---
I think it would get annoying quick. The rewards would have to be really worth it. I would hate if I had to stop what I was doing just to ft to my camp to take out a few mobs then ft back to pick up where I left off. It would really be a problem if you were in vault 94 and come back to a trashed camp when you finished.
---
Lack of a new content tends to kill a playerbase. Not that the game is dying, it’s just in a slow period. The player count will likely come back up when Mischief Night drops, then probably slow down again until Wastelanders if I had to guess.
---
That’s some good damage output! But on a bffr handmade I can get 200 per shot and 300-400 vats sneak criticalls. It’s all personal preference I’m just presenting the information for everyone to interpret at their discretion
---
I’m hoping for new mischief night costumes weapons and camp items. Fasnacht is the Christmas event if I understand things properly
---
Looks like a good buidl going on.
---
For the swapouts, you might consider adding Fireproof 1. It will help when a SB launches a sonic attack at you.  
---
THe only time you need gunsmith is when crafting/repairing, consider swaping that out for other things that help during adventuring.    First aid and/or the rad reduction one come to mind.  Perhaps stabilized 1 (if you decide to grab a heavy weapon)
---
Ditto hard bargain.
---
If u really want to get alot of wood. Build a camp at the log camp near the moonshiners shack and place a wood extractor down. It will give u 40 wood a hr + you can collect all the wood around the surounding area.
---
When you're under level 100, it's only you killing ghouls, and you have a bloodied build w/ high intelligence for extra xp. Every ghoul is about 112 xp ish, use well rested bonus and beef stew for a little more xp, and usually the ghouls will herd every minute so you just farm it in sneak mode
---
Great video. Good advice. I'm always telling people to get off the bunker and/or clear the mobs. A lot of times I'll turn my gun away from the queen to clear them myself after she regenerates. 
---
Like other commenters I'm surprised that you consider the heavy guns worthless. I've never been able to get that kind of damage out of a rifle. I use lever actions, not handmades or gauss rifles. Always felt my heavy guns dropped her health bar faster. 
---
I'm familiar with the unarmed melee tactic. I've got a bloody swing speed +1 strength mole miner gauntlet. Taken down a couple queens with it. But I'm not a min-max build. I don't want to be one even if it let's me drop the queen in 2 seconds. 
---
I appreciate the build advice but I'm gonna stick with the heavy energy guns. People's ears be damned.
---
I understand but you cant just say that big guns are useless if you haven't fully tested them.
---
Bethesda has pissed me off a lot with the half-assed release of this game that I've been talking about since 2010 with my roommate while playing New Vegas on separate consoles.
---
But at least Bethesda will never cater to Nazis or China. I'll always be able to give them a point for that. Fuck fascism.
---
You sure you'll even have the costume unlocked by then?
---
I know, saddly. I still do it just for the xp for the event itself on my alt because it's just fast xp, but it'd be better to be able to farm it for the most xp
---
Agrees with pizaboy.
---
Thank for the tips.  Never knew I was making so many mistakes.
---
Well now I wanna start Fallout 3 again.
---
Defending our homes/bases while were away is why we place turrets.
---
Unfortunately. I think all the folks who’ve been saying ‘Fallout 76 is a simulation’ aren’t thinking big enough- it isn’t the game, it’s the entire world. We’re all in the Matrix, how else do you explain the insanity?
---
Doesn't work like that. The challenge does not check of against collecting wood itself, it just count up (1) each time you click E on a object with the option "Collect Wood", regardless of how much wood you collect. Wood scrap is not the point; clicking on wood sources is.
---
Mate I said they are “pretty much useless when compared to rifles and melee”.... because I have fully tested them. Let’s take a step back bro there’s no need to debate. As I said we all have our own preferences and in the video I said it’s a quality of life choice that you don’t have to follow. By all means feel free to use what you like, I’m just putting front and center the most effective tips and tricks to fight the queen
---
All that guy does is complain.
---
I made the same post back then also, but it still seems like everyone wants to just finish it fast. Apparently there's a rare outfit, but I mean, leveling up is nice too. Especially since the legendary perk system is rolling out for every 50 levels
---
They can make up any result they like. It’s not like their records have to stand up to scrutiny in court. Given that the stretch goal numbers appear to be created in reaction to our progress, it appears that we’re dealing with less of a judge and more of a dungeon master.
---
ah, I did read it wrong. I assumed the rewards would be "costumes found in the game, atom shop and even fasnacht masks", and not that those were the costumes we'd have to wear to the event.
---
I'm not the only one, though. they could've worded the article a bit better. suddenly the event is a lot less interesting, at least to me.
---
Thx so much m8 😜👍 cant waint
---
Idk maybe. Im pretty washed up nowadays anybody can kick my butt
---
Can you find some friends to team up with? It's honestly a \*lot\* more fun and easier with a full team using mics.
---
One other thing you missed, “Don’t walk directly in front of the guy shooting the SBQ in the head with their BE Gatling Plasma or other high fire rate exploding weapon.”
---
Im def ready for it as one of the things we all need to do is kill all the robots at whitesprings. Very fun tho i do that already. Its a good way to get fusion cores.
---
for sure not.
---
I was on this morning and man it was empty.  Good for taking shops but that gets old after a while too.
---
I like killing yanks with my trap base, fun reactions 😂🤣
---
The only thing im upset about is that it happens Durning outer world's so it's gonna push back me playing that for a few days. But I'm ready 👌
---
Again i really appreciate the tips
---
I get that challenge done every month not hard with woodchuck perk.
---
I’m hyped for PvP.  Better bring your popcorn.
---
Wait theirs outcast power armor?? I didn't know that, that's my favorite faction! Best tips is just hide the whole time.
---
It depends where u build it will happen automatically. I dont like the idea because I dont want to have to drop what I'm doing to make sure my stuff doesn't get destroyed. It would be nice to have some type of warning system that informs u that ur base is getting annihilated by a couple scorched beasts, that would be cool.
---
Ha, well im sure you can find something to wear when a comprehensive list of costumes is released. Maybe you can wear that bunny head that you seemed to like?
---
There are *theories* that many items in world will respawn after you've gathered a certain number of other items (the number 180 is thrown around a lot).  It's just speculation as far as I've heard, I haven't seen anything based on datamining or actual experimentation to back that up.
---
The counter-theory is that it's on a 20 or 24 hour timer, though personally I don't think that's correct (or there's more to it than a simple timer).  I'm certain that I've looked at specific drops over 24 hours later and not had them respawn, and it was during a time that I wasn't farming much.
---
It's possible that in-game time comes into play as well, and also that different 'drop types' have different mechanics.  It's really hard to say.
---
Your best bet is to find a number of locations with good drops and cycle through them, and keep an eye on when the first locations are back up again.  It may take 4 or 5 good locations to farm before you're ready to start back at the beginning again.
---
Get to watoga and farm every PA part and laser rifle and break them down with the scraper perk, ez 50 aluminum un less than 10 minutes if you know where to run.
---
The first powerplant also has a good number of scorched.
---
Although some will disagree, I'm of the opinion that we'll still get the rewards, regardless of the end totals. This event has been hyped in such a way that Bethesda's going to feel obligated to give the rewards, or risk disrupting their player base, as it's already balanced on a knife's edge. At the _very least_ they'll offer a "consolation prize", but I still believe we'll get the full rewards, with Bethesda saying something akin to, "Well, although it was a marked struggle, the community just managed to squeak by, in meeting the challenge". After all, Bethesda's plan is to generate interest, not kill it off. This event is only a distraction until Wastelanders, so they'll not do anything to alienate their customers.
---
they mention it towards the bottom of the post around the price mention.
---
If you like rifles,  I'm hunting a vamp plasma...rof on those is crazy, bound to keep you up.
---
sorry, not happening, first of all under level 100 doesn't matter, as far as I can tell there is no scaling, second killing super mutants is the best way to level up, third it's just not happening, one level, yes, multiple?  no, not happening, I have over 500 hours in this game on two characters, it's just not happening
---
This is the reason why people have 5 different characters...myself I don't have the time or desire to do so...I realise that I can't be a weapons or armor "collector" and only keep on me or in my stash things that I use or can trade or sell...somedays it's still a struggle but manageable
---
And a big heart shaped bed for the floor with a disco ball and a large collection of garden gnomes.
---
Yeah you get the outcast paint at level 60
---
Probably neither :) but this character is all thematic so i figure she likes both but thinks the BOS lacked conviction and staying power.
---
Thanks will do
---
Change your password! "This Account Connected From Another Device" could mean somebody else logged in your account and let your CAMP get destroyed
---
my bad, carry on
---
def!
---
I've started buying vendor plans with my spare caps. Last night I bought all the plans at Flatwoods. There are some atom challenges that are related to plans so you can earn atoms completing those.
---
any YouTuber but him.  don't support sexist pieces of shit.  he even fat shamed some girls, him, the fattest YouTuber, is guilty of fat shaming...
---
Learning a lot here too :)
---
this is literally the largest map they ever made...
---
totally understand that!
---
Common plans I dump at stations, and if i get junk legendaries,  they go for 50-100 caps a star each. Basically people want cheap scrip and things that can be annoying/tedious to get. Screw, Balistic Fiber, Lead, Steel, Acid, Gunpowder, and popular ammo are what keeps me with a constant flow of caps.
---
One question I have is about the "more people = higher stats for the queen". I've heard people saying this is how it used to be, but they changed it in a recent patch to make it so the queen has the same stats no matter how many people there are. Do you know for sure if this is how it works now?
---
Thanks! That really helps. My camp is on the golf course in white springs (by the lake that spawns mirelurks). I may move it to see if that helps. I appreciate the pointers!
---
Given its usually a high level area, and it would not be "right" to run an a hourly event   
---
 where lower levels could not participate, it's going to be interesting to see what they do for enemy scaling   (and nuking - you know someone is going to do it)
---
What’s a responded badge?
---
I think what there is could be considered some of the best in the series, especially storylines like the Order of Mysteries (like the Silver Shroud questline in 4, it stands out from the rest), but there are a lot of areas that are basically barren of anything worthwhile. Vault Tech university for example; a few tidbits, two pedestrian audio tapes, and all the 'good' lore being an info dump on one terminal and an additional twist on the Dean's PC. And some areas aren't even that deep. Given the distance between areas, and the resources (ammo, supplies, meds, repair bills) for combat, it's often not 'worth' exploring unless you know somewhere is going to be a little interesting. 
---
I played in the BETA, but after experiencing how broken the game was at first, I only bought it four months ago. I discovered since then that 'the game is full of story! Areas packed with holotapes and notes!' was a massive exaggeration. There is stuff of interest, no doubt, but a lot of it is loaded into areas you'll explore or pass near during the MQ. There are probably more holotapes and lines of dialog in Flatwoods than in the entire Toxic Valley region.
---
Good advice mate and pretty good video, I will certainly take your advice in regard to not standing on V9 or the fence but I am a bloodied PA heavy weapon build with a 50 cal bloodied and due to my weight limit while in PA I can't afford to get out of it because then I go encumbered. Thanks again.
---
Yes we have all tested it extensively and we are confident the Queen has higher stats with more than 8 people around. If you see in the video at 7:30 my friend hits her for 40k damage a few times and even 64k damage ...... she only has 32k health normally 
---
Wish I was wrong lol I’d rather her have the same hp all the time
---
Agrees with laptop coffee. Someone tried to ip hack me a few weeks back in attemps to steal my xbox account.
---
I play on XBox, and yesterday my quick select wheel became unresponsive.  It would open, but I couldn't select anything.  I tried fast traveling and that didn't fix it.  Had to log out and back in, which solved the problem.  I have had a few game freeze issues while inside the pip boy as well.  Once with aid items and the others related to inspecting weapons.
---
No worries mate! And feel free to use any gun you’d like I only mentioned heavy guns because of the audio glitch, glad I could help.
---
You mean the "Responders" badge next to my name?  Under the community options under the create post button, you can select your user flair.
---
That's a good location if you don't mind competing for it, could be worth staying a while. It could be worth collecting some choice junk for displaying too. I keep a couple of things in my machines for camp decoration like bird statues, house teapots, food dehydrators, plastic pumpkins etc. 
---
I have a machine full of around 100 lbs of preserved food and every once in a while someone will come buy large amount of that. Most of it sells for a couple of caps under the recommended amount. Can-do in luck is amazing especially at the Whitespring. Just dig round in the garbage cans for food.
---
Love the name, Stabitha.
---
And don't join teams with people you don't know and trust.
---
Thanks! Much appreciated
---
maybe actually read the terminals and notes and listen to the holotapes
---
Absolutely.  I get the Whitespring effect all over the map now and serious frame rate drops, even when there isn't a lot of action going on.  If there is fire anywhere, I just expect the game to stutter.  I have an excellent internet connection, so I am almost certain it isn't on my end.
---
I like knight Moreno! He's a hero and his voice is music to my ears. Ive learned that whole transmission by heart after hearing it so often. 
---
But I can see why hearing it all the time could get tiring. Not everyone wants to join the Moreno cult.
---
Wait, not a cult. Definitely not a cult.
---
there's literally holotapes everywhere, even in the toxic valley, maybe actually pay attention to your surroundings...
---
Ooooooo ok thanks
---
Thousands of people play this game and dont read this sub. Probably not gonna stop sadly.
---
I've been going through Camden Park, Point Pleasant, and Morgantown Airport (the Collision Course event spawns another 15-20 scorched) everytime I play.
---
I always wondered if people would buy the preserved foods. I’ll give it a whirl! I’ll also try to bulk some of the popular junks and throw it in there.
---
Well yeah, but I can jump on the mic and walk around saying whatever I want too. And why copyright?
---
The area was not irradiated but I think the smaller zone in the middle was
---
If I come across a camp selling large amounts of easy to find materials, like wood, steel, and concrete at one cap each I’ll buy all of it. The trick is having enough to attract anyone :)
---
Well yes, that’s true, but Bethesda said as part of the feedback for the first Fasnacht that they’d improve drop rates on those masks next Fasnacht so they aren’t nigh-impossible to obtain. It’s just more incentive to replay the event, which i don’t necessarily mind.
---
Anyway, we don’t know what the rewards are yet. No doubt we’ll find out from dataminers once Patch 14 hits.
---
They could make the radio station in the mire a workshop and whoever controls it controls the music and can do talk radio every few songs.
---
I watched it.  Thanks for the heads up.  
---
While I enjoy figuring a lot of this stuff out on my own.  I now at least I feel confident that if I wander over for the first time, I won't screw stuff up for the people that really know what the hell they are doing.
---
X to doubt
---
Glad I could help !
---
LOL you don't like free candy?
---
Yeah! That’s pretty much what I meant. But in my opinion, it shouldn’t be the kind of workshop another player can just take. I think once someone claims it it’s theirs as long as they’re there using it. That way they can focus on the talk show.
---
Very simple and great idea. I imagine a system like calling US g. Requisitions. You find it, load it, choose three songs.
---
I mean i would not ruin my reputation of my link accounts over some candy? plus i got people who can vouch that my giveaways are legit...
---
Lol. Poor you.
---
What are you talking about?
---
EL-7 is gold. As soon as we get some good BoS camp stuff I'll be making a memorial to Moreno and the rest of the heroes.
---
While I do agree the game needs some balance, remember that 450=50. Being hundreds of lvls higher doesn't mean much
---
I'm guessing their horror story equivalent in 76 is the lucky hole mine since it seems like it has a like the people who were down there started a whole cult
---
Putting aside the sillier Atomic Shop outfits, questionable voiceovers, and the kooky glitches, the overall *tone* of Fallout 76 is a welcome return to the darkness of the earlier games.  It's almost like by virtue of not having to show it, they felt they could get away with more.  The fate of Van Howe, for example - you could never show that.
---
Plus, they give you all the clues, but they rely on you to piece it together in your head.  Your imagination serves as the glue, and therefore ends up making things feel more personal and realistic.  Ford's holotape, for example - if you actually saw Ford get killed, you probably wouldn't think much of it.  But hearing him suddenly get cut-off and land in a heap makes it a lot more grisly.
---
New Vegas came from the *ooriginal* developer. Lol. 
---
And in one expansion you find out they had fucking replicators. Dead Money, I think it was called. Humanity's problems were solved, and China blew everything up. 
---
The war had been going on for decades, but nobody had been stupid enough to use nukes yet. Then China got stupid. Although that might have been the Zetans doing, it's kinda implied in Mothership Zeta.
---
Levels means shit in this game, it only shows (more or less) how long do you play. There always will be dicks in the game, no matter the restrictions and artificial rules - people who will to be dicks will find a way. There is Pacifist mode in the game for the reason and workshops were PvP zones from the beginning. And they still pointless, in my opinion...
---
Automatic láser guns are underrated. My commando carries one and it is as good as the Fixer in terms of killing. Expensive to make ammo, though. But you can buy it since.people donot use it.
---
Switching to wallpaper or to blank wall removes them. Likely because the items mount to a different point on each. But switching from one wallpaper to another doesn't remove everything. Or at least, it doesn't for me.
---
Whoa.  That's a hit of nostalgia I did not expect.
---
wE nEvEr FoUnD hIs BoDy!!!
---
Probably a noob question but how are you able to see your damage output like that? I’m on Xbox.
---
I wait to see your saltiness when you encounter a stealthboy using player using a Tesla. 
---
Legacies are pretty powerful, but at least they require you to actually aim.  Last Tesla I encountered had shots going clear across the screen in the wrong direction, but I was still getting hit.
---
Me during queen fights:
---
«Get off the fence/bunker!»
---
«Stop shooting her in the air, she won’t land!»
---
If it’s really bad, I just leave. Leave the excavator warriors to bot out on the fences.
---
I think nearly everything should be a "toggle-able" option, including Hunter V Hunter
---
If only I could upvote your comment more than once...
---
Not really. Most explosive laser rifles and gathling lasers have enough firerate and splash damage to kill players. So no aim skill is really needed.
---
I'm going to do this
---
Poseidon and they are all 1 shots.
---
Total n00b question.  Casual Level 32 player here. 
---
How are you getting so many caps that you hit a limit?  And do you want to throw any my way?  😀
---
Made me think of Betty from Rat Queens.
---
[https://imgur.com/wL2kzKG](https://imgur.com/wL2kzKG)
---
There is a ammo legendary effect. Quadruple i believe
---
Never ending was replaced with double and quad because of balance in PvP. Double was later removed.
---
Clearly you've never used a Tesla. 
---
With a laser you need to at least get close.  Tesla?  Lol. You can hit a mile away and still have it arc to your target, even if they're invisible.
---
I was dealing about 20-30 damage each shot with my TS FFR 50 cal. But no one else seemed to be helping
---
I’m so proud of whoever made that, and of you too for bringing that to my attention ❤️
---
My perception generally runs between 30 and 35 and berry mentats still don't work properly, they have been broken since nuclear winter dropped. They instituted a change to them in nuclear winter  and it carries over to other modes because they have hard time making the game mechanics differentiate between modes
---
Because if you place just 1 thing in the wrong order, trying to get railings to snap in this game is like trying to find purified water in Fallout 3, its possible, but itll probably get you and your dad killed.
---
I don't know how to explain to you how to read for comprehension so I'll just dumb down the conversation.
---
Them:
---
Liberty Prime is a satire of American "democracy" at gunpoint and Fallout overall is a satire of McCarthyism, capitalism, and America
---
You:
---
&gt;You are definitely looking into it too much
---
Me:
---
It doesn't take much to see the satire, it's in every game in the entire series
---
I know where to drop it. Just had a bunch of guys not helping I guess. I won’t drop it there anymore and just wait for others to drop it. Not worth my time to do it myself.
---
The world was full. Couldn’t even get my buddy In the world.
---
Yeah, they have the playlist that Bethesda already owns, and they pick the order it plays in between the talk show part. Other players could pay to advertise their Vendors and stuff or something like that. Just something to make the radio interesting again.
---
Note the significant support structure under the house.
---
Sorry I'm not done. My thoughts continue....
---
I think people grouping up with an empath mule is a bigger problem than almost everything else that routinely gets complained about regarding pvp balance.
---
I like this comment! I could introduce you to many people who literally think they are the ultimate PvP. When all the do is sit on a roof in their sent with their chameleon on the go and plug you with their 2 shot tesla. And then they want to know why you don't come back seeking revenge? Where is the PvP in being shot by an electric blue wire that can literally reach every corner of the screen at one time, by a dude who literally won't move from his spot right now because then you'll be able to see him and god forbid land a shot on his very expensive armor.
---
I don't PvP and I do have pacifist mode on so I'm not salty per say (I just don't like being followed over the map and having people constantly gun bash, melee or just be in my personal space to activate my mutations). I have played with people who do this type of sneak op sent build with 2 shots and all they seem to do is go from one person to the next trying to instigate and calling them bitches if they have pacifist. So toxic. But also after the first day i wonder is it not boring? 
---
I will say the only yt'er I dealt with was Ratty Star? (I think that's the name) he took the junkyard off me but emoted at me and gave me time to respond before he started firing. Which is extremely fair imo. Too bad I was new enough that I didn't understand the emotes and my partner called him a c-unit as he thought I was being bullied lol.

Caps get easy later in the game. Some tips, Super Mutants usually have a few caps each, go where they are. Bulk and sell junk you don't need to robot vendors, most junk you only need 50-100 of in stash once you're camp is built. When roaming, I pick up all chems and sell, if you have traveling pharmacy perk the weight is negligible. Pick up glowing meat from enemies and cook into glowing steaks, sell to vendors. If you don't need the steel scrap, sell weapons you pick up.
---
Not saying that I don’t like Knight Moreno. I love my wife more than anything that exists, but I couldn’t even listen to her repeat the same phrase for longer than a couple minutes without getting tired of it.
---
Just keeping it cheesy out here haha

Only children will fall for that.

The rest have bullets for those assholes.

Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by more people then you know what to do with

Your karma says you are nothing but a troll.

It’s the same on PC. It’s a crapshoot sending and accepting friend requests.

Think you making a fair point with your post. I encountered but explosive plasma and laser weapons. They are all nasty and makes a hugh off balance gameplay for those of us who don't wanna go online and pay real money for them.
---
Not that hard... there are 2 railings... a big and a small... small railing attacth to small floors and smaler side of platform and big railing only attach to big side of platform... If that is too much just place defences without snapping... will look even more apocalitic if you ask me...
---
Cry me a river lol
---
I for one am giving you an up vote. For I agree, see a lot of the same stuff every day
---
jesus you are really really angry. this is not a scam or a joke. seriously... why do people have so much hate....

Thank you lol

Well that's me corrected, and with such respect and thought behind it too, I'm honestly blown away. My hat off to you.

Excellent itinerary, wastelander! Motivates me to clear the map today! Thanks!

Did you even watch the video? Nobody told you to use melee, sounds like someone can’t breach 1k damage with a super sledge 😂😂

I don't use Reddit actually. Check my other pages. I am one of the top fallout 76 streamers every night on twitch. i doubt i am a troll..

Yea yea yea yea yea yea....BOI

But only 4 showed up. It was real weird. I’ll just not launch a nuke on the queen anymore and wait for others.

Well I like it

I can understand that.

No Never-Ending, just Quad for Quadruple magazine capacity. But that *can* spawn on the Double-Barrel Shotgun. 
---
Before you ask, Quad can't spawn on any Black Powder guns. Now *that* would have been something.

You played NW right before you looked at the map in adventure.

I believe that concentrated fire has a cap, but would love to be proven wrong.

Thanks!! &lt;3

I mean, I won't be mad if he finds his way back in Wastelanders. He shall be listed as MIA in the meantime.
---
My problem is that things that are connected might be on the otherside of the map of each other and you dont get them by order.... Quest should be made so i get a icon to the next holotape or terminal story.... also... terminals should have a voice over option... hate reading... skip them rigth away.
---
Same here. Thought I would try it myself but no go. Just four players that seemed to just stand there. May have been 5 when it failed. I quit shooting when we had 5min left and she was still around 80%. When to farm flux instead at that point.
---
Haha too cringe &lt;3
---
or does
---
What the fuck are you even going on about lmao. I think we can see the real troll here. Any logical adult knows making uneducated assumptions is idiotic...
---
needs some additional research but it looks like they can be gotten after finishing the part of the Biv quest line
---
Ya. I figured that
---
Just think about, you'll get it, eventually.
---
Paddle Ball mods are unobtainable. You can't get them by scrapping nor any other way.
---
Beam splitters on explosive energy weapons make them do way more explosive damage than intended. Something like 3x as much.
---
Bethesda couldn’t figure out a fix for it so they disabled them from dropping. This extended to all energy weapons, even those without be splitters.
---
Oh i got it. It was just really dumb.
---
Of course, and I'll add the Responders outfits as well, might as well be thorough
---
“What made you think we’re friends?”
---
😊
---
One should have not to "tweak" our own PC etc. In order to get the game to perform as intended. The fact is there is a huge bug that needs addressed ASAP. I have a core  i9, 32gb ram, and a rtx 2070 32gb... and it freezes as hell Evey time no matter what!
---
So yes fix it please and thank you all for the great feedback and tips!
---
Wow, almost exactly the same for me. Desk was for skill books for me though.

# Wel-come...to... Me-ga..ton!
---
My issue with getting a mule to hold on to scrip is that they don't have The Bear Arm Plan or the Fixer plan unlocked on my main, Yes I could just hold onto legendaries but I main already has more then enough legendaries for the daily limit.
---
Yeah, I’m not a stingy person so I always sell what I have for as little as possible. It all adds up over time anyway!
---
Damage you see are not always accurate, when sbq is engaged in combat sneak crit modifier will be rejected server side even tho you can see it on your screen.
---
My back hurts, my feet hurt, everything hurts
---
I pray that they recycle the halloween creation club skins. And dressing up isnt for everyone! I would just put on a costume for the 2× objective progress, and forget all about it when the event ends.
---
I’ll quit complaining when I have nothing left to complain about!
---
I'm a new player so like every fuggin mission is scorched related so I'm doing my small part for y'all who have access to the purveyor
---
I’ve played fo3 for hundreds of hours, and not once have I left megaton standing for longer than an hour.
---
The second one, yes, the defenses without snapping, would look fantastic.
---
Just trying to use the snappable railings on the inside of a build, gets frustrating. "ReQuIrEs SuPpOrT" Because, apparently, the second floor isnt deemed as supportive enough. It isnt an issue everytime we build, so we (the team I play with) assume it's due to build order.
---
This isn’t an isolated example, we have plenty of footage confirming. Also.

Even if you do that, there’s still a lot of potentially great locations that seemingly have no reason to exist. Sure, most locations have a few flavour notes and terminal entries, but a lot of times that’s *all* they have; apart from enemies, of course. Tanagra Town is one of the most glaring examples of this - a brilliant ascent up a vine, vehicle, and house construct, to find a single note at the top. Though it’s far from alone in the ranks of ‘oh, I guess that’s all there is.’ 
---
You may have no problem with the bulk of story being delivered via notes and terminals, but for a lot of us it creates no emotional investment. It’s far more difficult to ignore an NPC who might have an interesting story to tell, then read another set of terminal entries. People who miss a lot of the story aren’t at fault here, rather it’s the fault of FO76’s developers for not having the story meet players halfway and actually engage with them.
---
Okay thanks I will appreciate it
---
I’m not familiar with the creation club skins. I’m at work. Can I get a synopsis of what they are?

If you feel a suggestion has been done to death, petition to have it added to the list.
---
Personally I don't think any of those subjects are worthy of being removed (except maybe #4, and that is a bit political), but that's *my* opinion, you don't have to agree.
---
But yeah, I wish search was used more by people.
---
I found it somewhat irritating that some people claimed that no human NPCs meant there is no story. There have been plenty of quests with great stories in past Fallout games that had zero human interaction, and if you aren't willing to take the time to read a note or listen to a tape that's YOUR problem. Not all stories need to be spoonfed to you face-to-face by "Farmer" before he tells you to kill some raiders. The game isn't meant to be a constant run and gun from quest marker to quest marker, you're suppoused to explore.
---
I don’t know if her health scales or not, i was just talking about on screen dmg numbers those are very deceptive 😅
---
Junkies for ranged options, since some addictions lower strength for melee damage. Instigating is better for high damage slow firing weapons (like a sniper rifle) AA is better for tankier enemies. Two shot is a static boost but lowers durability if both pellets hit the target. Furious can be nice, but works better with faster firing weapons to hit the max boost quickly.
---
i personally love vampires on my faster firing weapons, best way to do damage is to not get smacked around like a bouncy ball
---
I have the entire costume if you’re interested. I’m on Xbox and is give you a fair price. I personally don’t like the costume too much.
---
Ohhh my bad lol
---
Upvoted! Amen! As for the one shotting, i try my best not to, but im not putting myself in true danger for others to get a shot in. Kill myself for you? Done it too many times lol, and can tell you i usually got my junk stolen before the patch. The idea is to have a end game build and im not carrying guns i dont use to eat up my weight for the convience of others. Figure out the game, maybe RPG isnt for you if you cant figure this one out. All the info you need is at yourfingertips and yet....😁
---
Well we don’t have Mr.Handys yet....
---
Unless you have 800 atoms.
---
Raiders are a part of fallout, any other game I would say it's harrassment but Raiders are toxic and we love that in fallout games. That's why it's funny seeing salty people like you complaining, expect anything in the wasteland. Rose would be so proud. 😂🤣
---
For real. The camp system is dying on its ass, and given the number of pre-existing building pieces Bethesda are sitting on, I have no idea why that is.
---
Can the sum of the explosive damage and each hit from the beam splitter exceed the **current** 110 damage cap? Again, serious question. Based on what I have experienced on the receiving end I do not believe that it can.
---
Instigating is the best if you can one-shot what you're fighting, so it's great for clear-speed, but it isn't going to give you much or any value against bosses (sheepsquatch/SBQ). 
---
Furious is the opposite. Very little value against mobs, but solid value against bosses. 
---
Therefore, my full-health rifleman carries one instigating rifle and one furious rifle. I also carry a quad railway rifle to diversify my ammo needs. I would switch the furious to AA if I had it since it would have slightly better flexibility. 
---
I used to use a TSE, but I really didn't like it. The explosive damage is really small, especially if you don't max out demolition expert. I have better places for my perks. The accuracy of the second bullet is really bad beyond point blank. It's fine for shotguns, or heavy guns in the enemy's face, but often misses at medium range, especially in VATS. TSEs also need very frequent repairs. 
---
Another solid affix that's not on your list is quad, which is especially valuable on small magazine guns, like railway rifles.   
---
I almost always prefer 25% faster fire as second and faster reload as third.
---
Well a visual bug on a purely visual effect is a problem... the only possible problem... and a huge one. Also I'm talking someone who is AFK standing, not sneaking around the wall. Don't know the exact build but at punching distance it shouldn't be effected. This happened the second I put the biocommmesh mod on my armor, and removing the mod didn't fix the problem. For the record with happens with monsters as well in west tek, where it never happened before.
---
He put out a video addressing all of this months ago and in it he never once acts like he did nothing wrong. He clearly explains what he was thinking at the time, aknowledges he was wrong for thinking tje way he did, apologizes and admits he was at fault, and says he has actually changed his mind on various things, and hopes to be better. Which is a lot better than the stock "i am sorry if what i said offended you" BS most people put out just to save face.
---
I'm all for not supporting people who are garbage but if we act like people who want to be better and improve themselves are still trash then we give no reason for people to ever try and change themselves for the better. I applaud Ox for owning up to his past mistakes and his desire to be a better person.
---
this post made me to return
---
This is a wild guess on my part, and completely out of character for the 76 devs, but I'm going to go with careless oversight.
---
I noticed a difference in them the other day when I put the BioCommMesh mod on my armor. The first time I popped them when I put that on they did nothing. When I took the mod off it works like 50% of the time, but out of the 50% of the time it works it only highlights the hands of the person which is impossible to really make out in a PvP situation.
---
I like this one the most couple dozens of scorched and easy straight path
---
Yeah, its hard if the others doesnt do significant damage, also you have to spend a lot of ammo to handle the adds. I usually spend 500-1000 bullets on a queen fight, with a primed B25 .50cal. depending on the people, but if im totally alone, i can spend 2000 easily.
---
Downvoted because :
---
1- You asked for it!
---
2- You actually wanted a Upvotes.
---
Use whatever weapon you want my friend, just keep in mind the person that actually launched the nuke probably does care if it lasts 2 seconds or 10 minutes...
---
I mean, I'm heavy weapon specced so....no. If people want to use a pistol to fight her, or a pool cue because that's their character more power to them.
---
I have the TS FFR prime 50. I spent 6k rounds before I called it quits to farm flux.
---
Ok thanks for telling me I didn't know what it was
---
Thank you! Going commando or heavy. What would be your type of weapon? Whatever is is the game? If survival returns. What would you go for PvP?
---
I'd help but I'm on xbox, I'm guessing you've just started and have to do the tadpole challenges? I completed Archery, Athletics and I think the one where you take pictures of animals (forgot the name) You need a handheld camera for those but it's pretty easy. Also you can find the challenges in the 'world' section not sure on that one someone will have to correct me, There's a few guides on how to complete those three on youtube so I'd suggest looking a few of those up.
---
I think a cool idea would to have an event the base owner can start whenever they want at their base and have it on a 3/6/12 hour or so cooldown whatever bethesda wants.     have it pop up so if people want to come help defend they can.    could even have a pvp variant of it if they wanted to.    pretty much have a "Horde mode"  where raiders/ghouls/Scorched/Super Mutants/radturkeys  you name it just start attacking your base for a set time limit.     if you survive you get some rewards of bethesda's choosing.       I think this would solve the problem to of a true random attack so your not in Vault 94 or off somewhere and you come back and your base is now a super mutant slaughterwhorehouse all of a sudden. Although having npc's attacking your base and taking it over only for it to trigger another event for you to take it back would be cool too but lets not get ahead of our selves.
---
I know I just respecced to make myself a lot more tankey in PvP situations and use a ton of Berry Mentats as well, even for PvE. I feel like somehow putting the BioCommMesh mod on my armor made the mentats bug out and taking off the mod didn't fix it so that's why I'm here askin. 
---
P.s. where are poeple getting these unlimited stealth boy supplies?
---
Lol exactly as me
---
Thought this was just me.
---
Ah, Seeing as i am more a Damage Dealer and not too keen on being a tank, Vampire's wouldn't be a good option. I've got a furious+FFR+FR LMG. Is the LMG the weapon with the highest ROF in the game?
---
Well first is going and taking the quizzes then choosing challenges you want to do I chose hunting, agility and cryptologist since hunting and hacking are easy and the courses for agility are very easy.
---
Once these are completed you get the basic backpack doing the possum ones gets you access to the mods but the are not easy.
---
Seriously 800 atoms is not a big deal. Just do your daily stuff.
---
Half your post was whining about being a victim and that is unnecessary. Make your argument and move on. All you end up doing is distracting from the point of your post.
---
That's what I'd put my money on too. I just respecced my junkies character for better PvP action and stocked up on berry mentats and ballistic bock and hefe. Both of those items are bugged and now I feel like I moved things around for no reason .
---
I mean, it doesn't. If you want to say it equals 65ish for a well planned build I'd agree, but there are several very good perks that aren't available until level 49 or 50 and therefore can't be maxed out until the mid-50s at the very earliest.
---
You're also completely discounting the time spent playing between 50 and 450 which will not only improve a player's skill but give them countless legendary rolls to improve their character.
---
So saying 450=50 is a pretty ludicrous statement.
---
Do people really want to take advice from someone who used exploits in the game? He has youtube videos (now patched) on how to exploit the game and he was banned before. This is just another youtuber looking for views.  Don't forget to like and subscribe.

I suggest taking over the munitions factory every time I have taken it over the defend event has always spawned at least one 3 star enemy  each time.

I have a quad double barrel. Things a beast with the perks on. Still under 300 but you get 8 fast shots so, I love it.
---
I can help ya if your on Xbox. I’ve done it for both my characters
---
I totally understand, probably i did the same thing in your place. Atleast now worth to use ultracite ammo. 360x(1,166) rounds for 1 violet is pretty good.
---
I don’t blame anyone for asking about farming. No one keeps the wikis accurate. Discussions here, even if they are repeat are the best wikis we can hope for.
---
Biggest number I've gotten so far was a crit shot to the fusion core of the Battle Bot from a sneaking rifleman w/ a bloodied prime railway
---
I could have totally worked it more by feeding Adrenaline first and Gun-Fu-ing off of someone or other adds (no  Calmex running at the time, no food) - but was still crazy huge numbers.
---
Love my bloodied damage ... but also enjoy running some non-bloodied folks.
---
My biggest problem is I feel the urge to move my gunslinger to bloodied just to have some way to amp the damage better. Even crits all day long is just not as awesome.
---
I’ve had this happen a lot. I’ve found that it happens when you die at the end of any event. When it isn’t a public event, and you can choose to respawn, you can wait it out and respawn a few minutes later. With a public event, you get stuck on an infinite loading screen.
---
What the fuck lol geez you really do love your heavy weapons enough to attempt to slander me. Run along back to your power armor little food build
---
I infinitely repaired a grenade bouquet, fucking sue me 😂 ignorance is bliss
---
Good for you I only became a general a level 60 (mostly due to dicking around)  :3
---
Thats impressive!  
---
I can only watch in thumbnal right now, but it looks like the builder got the floor/tower alignment perfect.   and has lots of budget to work with.
---
I'm PS4 as well - was thinking if you wanted to check out my elevated platform, or visualize what I tried to articulate.......but my camp can't hold a candle to the one in the video.
---
 challenges have allways been broke I still cant get credit for the queen that ive killed 1000 times
---
Doesn't change the fact that it's still $8 otherwise... which is still pretty overpriced compared to microtransactions in other games, and especially when you realize a DLC is around $25-30... a skin in Fo76 is backwash 1/3 of the price of a DLC and most definitely not 1/3 the value. Scam
---
don't die then.
---
Honestly, but been considering just putting it on my Camp with the neon letters to come here, so maybe it'll draw 1 or 2 people
---
Sad to tell you, but the berry Mentats are apparently screwed up right now too, so all three are bugged.
---
I cant upload the proof on here as it breaks rule 9 no witch hunting
---
Placing one random item should.make everything fall off the shelves.
---
From what I understand take a pic of the price of gas sign for this one.  Haven’t fully tested myself tho.
---
Tanagra Town is simply there as an Easter egg to the Star Trek: TNG episode Darmok. 😁
---
This happened yesterday, I was doing Free Range with about 8 other people when the event was over I threw up the PvP Emote and a question mark asking people if they want to PvP and immediately get shot by 2 level 200s so I put a thumbs up I run towards the woods take a shot at one of the people and PvP started instantly melted by a Energy gun after I respawn surprise surprise one of them is holding a QFFR Tesla and the other a AAE Gatling Plasma the kid with the Gatling starts shooting in my general direction I have Weightless Armor so I just stood still till they both were sprinting at me jumped up and killed one of the players the other one is shooting everywhere trying to get a hit on me I kept sneaking around till I was able to catch him in VATS and I put him down fairly quickly and one of them seeked revenge so I reposition and I see him in the distance and he saw me he starts tagging me I dropped down a rock hill and they’re both coming at me I didn’t even stand a Chance the Gatling Plasma sent me flying and I got turned to ash in mid air lol I respawned and one of the kids message me saying “lmao gay ass level 120 that can’t PvP” not saying I’m salty or anything since I was looking to PvP just don’t understand why people use the same 3 OP guns and get off to it people really are weird.
---
Wow. Talk about a really self-centred post.
---
&gt; Is this game better now? Should I buy it? 
---
If you care about the game and building up the player base, you want these kinds of posts. We should be encouraging it, not shitting on people for posting these. People are understandably anxious about buying/playing the game. Rightly so given its history.
---
&gt; High level players shouldn't one shot mobs. 
---
You should be directing your ire towards Bethesda on this one. Way I see it the order of responsibility is Bethesda -&gt; High level one-shotters -&gt; people who complain about one-shotters because they feel entitled to legendaries like children having turns hitting a pinata.
---
Use the SCROLL FUNCTION of your browser to skim past them.
---
Rule 9: NO WITCH HUNTING.
---
For commando, the best weapons are The Fixer, handmade, and railway. 
---
For heavy, the LMG has great DPS, but is hard to feed. The .308 ammo it uses is expensive to craft. The gatling is the cheapest effective gun to run, while the .50 cal is probably the best balance between power and ammo consumption. 
---
In commando or heavy, you can swap weapons (within that class) on the fly because they use the same perks. 
---
I don't do enough PvP to advise, but I suspect you'll want to look at a Quad automatic tesla rifle. Quad + faster fire is even better, but very hard to find (while simple quads are not that rare). I understand the railway had some popularity for its stagger probability, which can defeat sentinel armor.
---
Up voted because i def agree.
---
I have fought and survived against the cheese cannons (explosive plasmas and lazers) and actually own an AAE Gatling Plasma with FFR but I rarely use it.  Same thing with my Suppressors Ultracite (explosive) Laser. 
---
In my experience, it’s all about distance.  I have a few ranged rifles that can do pretty decent damage and with FFR and incoming dmg resistance I have been able to hold my own but it can’t be up close.  The splash damage is too much to absorb.  
---
My frustration are the FFR Tesla’s because they are so glitched and distance doesn’t seem to matter.   
---
By far my biggest complaint through is PvP should only include the player that initiated it with you, not their whole damn team.   I can typically hold my own 1:1 in just about any situation but you get multiples involved and it’s a death sentence as I don’t ever team up.
---
But 8 days of daily queating and its yours?
---
You have to really move around the red rocket station , take a picture, and check to see if it registered. Its a pain. Some worked inside for me, some by the gas pumps, and one up on the sign
---
This is correct. I got each one the first time by making sure the gas sign was in the shot.
---
I have been having luck taking a picture of the sign while standing on top of it, but I agree it’s annoying and it takes several pictures before it registers. Also not all the red rockets are on the list to count.
---
Good lord! Thank you!!
---
Yea i honestly didn't think id enjoy this game as much as i have

You: im gonna repeat what the other asshole said because, i too like to try and feel superior in some way
---
depends.  Vampire means you can fire away at the queen and (somehat) ignore the scorched trying to get to you, as hits from the vampire weapon partially restore the heath the scorched are taking.
---
Just set the challenge to notify you when you complete one of the tasks. There's a little pop up. No need to go into the menu to see if you got it
---
I want option for good weapon only or fixer only and then i will trade that for whatever i want 😅
---
i dont even get to the loading screen part of it once i die my camera just circles around my dead body no matter how many times i hit the button to respawn it wont let me until like 5 minutes later if it even lets me. happens most at encryptid and scorched earth sometimes at other places rather it be event or not.
---
Wow! And it's not even floating.

10/10.

From what I've seen from Reddit, there isn't a difference from 50-99. It's about 7000xp (appearntly) and then from 100-999 it's 13000 or something close to that number. From 1-49 I haven't really found much, or bothered to test it, but from making my new alt Durning second meat week, I've been able to blaze through 1-47 so far with only a few hours a day. It's just a drag to re do quest I literally did 1-3 months ago. And idk what happened then. I remember starting the event, by myself, and going thru it for the whole 30 minutes, it was just horde after horde of ghouls. Handful of super mutants when it started just hanging out at sons of Dane. I wish I could try to recreate it somehow but I haven't had a single One Violent Night without 5+ people there with me since the new system. Could have been a glitch, idk. I walked out with 7 legendaries, which was the most I've still gotten from one event, and 3 level ups. I guess I cant really explain how cause now I don't even know. I thought it was just cause of all that stacking.
---
No doubt about it.  It’s one thing to fight a decent player with decent gear but if their teammate or teammates (similarly equipped) join the fray you are pretty much screwed.  Had it happen at the munitions factory recently.  A player decided to PvP and I took them down and was fighting their teammate when a third teammate that was cloaked came out of nowhere and blasted me with their shredding mini gun and strangler PA set up.  It’s was lights out for me in a hurry as a solo player.
---
6. Posts complaining about other posts.
---
Don't get me wrong, I competing agree with you. I just think you've commited the same sin. Karma farmer (farma?).
---
It was mentioned in one of the Inside the Vault blogs.
---
I used that one for junk because crafting table next to it. The locker in the back first floor was gear and ammo.
---
In the challenges menu, you can set a bunch to track - these will show up on the front page of your map menu and pop up in the HUD when you fulfill one of the objectives. Look at the challenges and decide which ones are the easiest: for the Tadpole ones most people go with Archery, Athletics, and Swimming. Swimming just has an objective you need another player's help with.
---
If workshops persisted and actual teams could hold them for days, I think it would feel like that.
---
I'm guessing OP is referring to Rage Chronicles. I've only ever seen him use an explosive gatling plasma in his PvP videos.
---
I'll take issue with a few point you make (though overall I'm in agreement with you).
---
Furious catches up with instigating quickly (~4 shots on the same mob), so for quite a few mobs it's fine.  Not ghouls or (usually mutants, but anything bigger.  Plus, instigating is king from sneak, but it's really not worth a lot outside that.  My instigating handmade 1-2 shots muties when hidden, but if I'm not it takes a lot of rounds to kill them.
---
Junkie's is worth more than furious, but not always a ton.  But always some (if you're at 5 addictions of course).  And it catches instigating in 3 shots on the same mob (taking withdrawals into account).
---
Explosive sucks.  I don't care who likes it.  I'd rather have a lot of effects over that.  Needing 5 perk points to make it noticeable isn't worth it.  Though, on low damage/fast rate weapons on mobs with little armor, it can be effective.
---
Quad is great for emergencies, but it doesn't always amount to a lot of DPS (on faster reload weapons).  But I have one for times when I can't reload safely.
---
I also love -25% vats cost.  I *wish* my main handmade had -25% vats.  Some people seriously undervalue that effect (though I think it's a small crowd).  Assuming you use vats.  And you *should* use vats.
---
Watoga high school has a lot of plastics and aluminum trays
---
I use a bloodied commando handmade build for my queen fights. That said, I also roll 2 points of big guns and 3 points of one man army. Given that I have all the commando/tank killer perks, I do get the most DPS with the handmade. But I use a bloodied prime 50 cal to hit the queen herself because it’s super fun and it conserves my 556 ammo. DPS is slightly lower but it seems to be almost equally effective for me.
---
Sure, my username is DragenRanger1... 
---
I got a reply when asked about how she did it and I was told that there was a patch that changed something with some items' collisions. It's made it very hard to make builds like this one anymore. Tree houses are also nearly impossible to build anymore. It's quite disappointing. I think it's still possible to build in power pylons, but it is definitely a lot harder. I'm sorry I don't have a solution for me.
---
Hey, it could be worse, your choice could have been "Weapon" or "Armor", or in the worst case just "Item".
---
Well said. Maybe u got up on the wrong side of the bed. But the search function is oft ignored.
---
I have 3 railway rifles all auto - a bloodied, and a quad, and a vampire.  The quad does more dmg but the other two have FFR.  Good to stagger for sure.
---
👏
---
Lol in this last week alone i have got 3 3* legendary guns with explosive area damage on them. 1 3* blooded combat rifle that gives explosive area damage. 1 3* exicutoners mini gun with explosive area damage. 3 3* double barrel shotgun with explosive area damage. All from pervayer.
---
I’ve never had it happen to me outside of an event, it’s always been as the event has ended. Kind of annoying, but I don’t really care if I lose my junk and have to re-boot anymore either.
---
Line in the Sand is a lot of waiting around for me. Kill a wave, kill the SB and wait for the server to notice.
---
Great idea. Good weapons only from now on!!
---
Thanks that’s a good route. Completely forgot about the AVR place, there’s loads in there. I’ve just been going Morgan town airport and doing the events with scorched. Only got to kill scorched with a plasma left to do and earned loads of Atoms.
---
I'm just hopeful the Four Rider Power Armor skins count as costumes.
---
Take screenshots dog.
---
Not sure but I do know if you mention the other sub in a title the post will be removed - I think the mods have beef but not sure why exactly
---
Naw, I did expect a bad reaction. I used to post a lot early on. My first reaction now before posting a question is to search first. This forum has built up so many great answers over time that I think you can find just about anything about the game that way.
---
Check your storage on your PS4   all your pictures are still there. At least they were for me.   I had about 2 Gigs worth after doing all the possum and photo challenges.   take a look.
---
Well put.
---
I like those kind of camps: They are realistic...I'm sick of floating camps
---
Do data mining will be available until they have an update with it included. I believe.
---
It was a pack of orange Jack-O-Lantern and purple Bats skins for a bunch of weapons and armors. I'd be shocked if they didn't add them to the Atom Shop for Halloween.
---
Good man. We all have access to the purveyor, it's not level locked or anything. You just have to find it. It's in The Mire next to Harper's Ferry, East of The Whitespring
---
Agree with all of it. I hate the teslas. I have them on all my pvp characters, but they only come out when somebody else takes it to that level first. 
---
On one of my commandos I have to keep distance and use cover if they are in PA, hoping they will come to me so I can get them with my railway. Sometimes you get a smart opponent that learns not to come close. Then it becomes all about figuring out how to close the gap. 
---
My other commando has better long range weapons and I tend to follow what you have outlined.
---
Thats the damage you do, not what she takes though.
---
I reas somewhere that she has a 70% damage Reduction as well
---
would be nice however, the scorched on my servers, now know that were hunting them. and are in hiding. I got ONE scorched last night over 2 scorchedbeasts.
---
I guess I just mean at my level it's not as feasible to get to it and use it
---
Dude that joke is so old. Those challenges aren't even happening anymore for me. Haven't been around for months. Let it go. They fixed it.
---
Yes the damage number factors in all resistances and damage reduction, the damage number is accurate , or else there’d be no point in having it
---
For example when completely non maxed in the pip boy someone’s meat hook could say 140k damage and then they power attack swing with all the buffs and so on , they will only hit the queen for 45k more or less
---
When I tank all 3 pylons burn 50 stims and do 75 percent of the damage I want to loot the body
---
What platform are you on? I'll be playing on a few hours and have always fancied doing the vault mission just haven't bothered yet lol I'm on pc

MHW was the only non-f2p game I could think of that does this as well

Buddy, do your research on me honestly I encourage you to find as much information as possible before throwing words around your computer screen.... I promise you I have no crap to be called out on. I literally made this guide to help people like I don’t understand your logic??
---
Did you not pay attention to what i said? i said people like different things in the game.  You like Lore i like doing things.    You go to places and there is sometimes very little there. Especially in regard to enemies. Go to a place nothing maybe a few rats or roaches nothing. I can run straight for 30 secs and not see an enemy.  You are missing my point about what I like in this game and wanted more of.  I did not shit on you for you liking the Lore aspect of it. Yet here you are bitching at me because i like action and running around. Get your head out of your ass and be a normal person. You made a statement then i made a statement yet you want to take a dig at me because what i like in the game is not the Lore?  come on man get over yourself.

[Heres](https://imgur.com/a/FhJdgWh) a few I thought looked good on the loading screens.
---
I never used a mesh mod so you may be correct that there’s a connection. 
---
I’m also wondering if the afk player was the ghost of a player long gone. Were you still able to kill them?
---
I added you (I'm pc btw)
---
This game really has a great foundation. The atmosphere and visual story telling still surprise and enchant me, even at lvl 145. Sure, there's bugs and quirks and I get frustrated with them, but I really do think there's something special here. I hope this game has a long bright future. It definitely needs work to get there, but I plan to stick it out along the way.
---
You're right - people rarely search.  In most of these examples, people want to vent their personal feelings.  They don't want to read someone else's.  You're doing the same.  Love it or hate it, I'm glad this forum is a place where people can say their piece and others can read it or skip it.
---
Yeah, at a later date, not with wastelanders.
---
They also announced Private Test Servers for next year, not private servers.
---
Its just so people test the patch on a test realm before hitting the public one.

I'm pc too

These are fairly easy to do and the dailies give badges again so you also have that, check the planner terminal at your camp to see if it’s available for the day 👍🏽

Id say....mammoth
---
Damn. Thanks man😥
---
For a fair price I'm interested if they aren't.
---
its more common for events for me but i have had it happen outside of em its like a 3 out of 10 times it happens is outside an event. mostly bugs me since the only time i really do events anymore is to help others. loot the body if i can check it if its good ill give it away if its bad ill scrap it and hope to get something better from the purveyor
---
What would you offer for the full suit?
---
Yup, I guess they’ll do this to make some more atoms -.-
---
Sucks for us, we’re suckers
---
not verified !. ps4 stores your ingame 76 photos in a save file. you can backup your save files, to a usb. I think you can also move them to usb, and once there, you can do what you wish with them on PC.
---
Try morgantown airport, low level = less ammo spent
---
I like him a lot.
---
Yeah I’m definitely a sucker for the Atom shop. Half the stuff I’ve got I can’t use as my camp budget is maxed out.
---
Thank you for telling me how I need to play. See, the drawn out SBQ is what I go for. As long as she’s flying other enemies are spawning giving me more XP. Also the legendary drop is better on those creatures attacking. The flux is a bonus and don’t forget the ammo dropped by the scorched. Plus materials that those creatures drop. In the end I think a one shot kill to the SBQ is a waste. I really don’t know how I got 3 builds over a lvl 200 without this info.
---
wow a whole 30 seconds without seeing an enemy, have you ever played an open world RPG before?
---
Good point.
---
Where can I subscribe to your blog?
---
If they are crouching in sentinel, they don't know sh*t.

I'd like to get into PVP in this game, but it's so rare to find. I was playing adventure trying to get my armor set squared away (still have very few of the armor pieces I want) when they removed survival. Now I don't know how to find it reliably.
---
Look out for the civil war suit plan.  Once you have that it's a license to print money. It requires only gold and cloth. Use alcohol, drugs, sweet roll and Hard Bargain to improve prices. Mothman eggs are another easy way to good money. Since they aggregated the vending allowance in one place, it should not be hard to make the full 1400 caps a day.  On top of that having competitively priced goods in your own store will help.
---
 That’s cool. Well done
---
still a piece of shit
---
Are you on PC? If so, what’s your ign? I’d enjoy joining your for your adventures :)
---
This was a really sourrrr comment - drop that gt and show me how it’s done then?
---
You not willing to forgive and aknowledge when someone changes for the better makes you just as shitty
---
Nope, you are not wrong but not right, either.
---
Right: technically to say, just rolling in the game is the best way to experience the game.
---
So asking some obviously question just make the game become boring. That is your point.
---
Wrong:
---
Of course, playing a multiplayer game is basically a mini society. Everyone have their opinion.
---
As the game, game pace is pretty slow so they lose keen to play is easily understandable. And most of the obviously question was from newbie.
---
Help or not is your choice. Just rolling, my dude...
---
I’m on Xbox sorry to say!
---
I watched him once and thought what a moron, so I definitelly won't waste my time again. Thx for warning.
---
Yeah the budget is a joke and keeps a lot of people from spending more atoms. Guess I’m gonna stay with my boring fridge/collectron until the cool ‘skins’ (but not skin) models go on sale...
---
If I don't get time to finish this PA BEFORE the bombs drop, I BETTER be a ghoul! I will be very disappointed if the word doesn't go on. If I die, finish it for me? lol
---
hmmm got you but, they've been kind of scarce on the ground past few days. Where I would normally expect 10 , i've been getting 1 or none.
---
Darn, was wishing we could hang out. PC players are dropping like flies
---
good point, and there are perk card to help mitigate radiation either as you take it or reduce it over time
---
it does, but you can offset it with a few points in first aid.
---
when you are running bloodied,  you dont need a full stim to keep you in the fight, just use regular stims instead of dilluted and you are fine.
---
no I have a melee build and it owns, and OP does say "melee is the right way" more or less.  I do agree with the no shooting while it's hovering but to be fair I have seen them hover when no one is shooting them...
---
Thanks for this! It’s so cool to see people get so creative and reincorporating things from the older games into 76. So cool 👍🏽
---
smart ass piece of shit
---
You know how far you can go in 30 seconds of running?    Dude why are you still talking to me move on.  I have explained everything. Get the fuck away and move on with your life.
---
The scarcity of HRF led me to buying flux and using what drops from the queen.  I don't run a prime weapon, so now I have no real need for flux.
---
When you consider the ammunition investment required to run a silo and fight mobs of glowing ghouls or the queen, buying flux seems the easier option to me.  If you use prime ammunition all the time, you are cutting into your stockpile every time you fight something.  If you are going to harvest flux and stabilizing components, use a non-prime gun.
---
That's a very good thing! The double barrel I used to have was the loudest gun in the history of shotgun... I will keep an eye out for that mod. That might make things easier...
---
As long as you have legendary weapons you don't want or use, it's worth it to start building up scrip. Don't sell ledges to vendors, they're best off scripped
---
I will say that the search function is not always good.or helpful   Or a lot of folks don’t know how. I didn’t for a long time until someone posted how to. I didn’t post to ask because you get folks answering that make you feel stupid, rather than being genuinely helpful. There are a lot of toxic folks who think that just because they know all the answers that everyone else should as well.
---
YOU RESPONDED TO MY POST, fucking snowflake, and yes, the map is big and sometimes empty, JUST LIKE REAL LIFE, ffs there doesn't need to be an enemy every 3 seconds in the wild, jog on wanker
---
1st, who cares?
---
2nd, he openly admitted he believed some fucked up things like many of us maybe did before you know, knowing better.
---
3rd, who cares, again.
---
these are awesome! great job on that mushroom cloud, i've never gotten that one to work! :D
---
never claimed to have the moral high ground, but fuck that asshole, and fuck your smug ass too
---
I mean, I didn't pay real money for mine and neither does my friend who has quite the collection. It just takes trading skills.
---
I can't find my fixer plan anywhere in my inventory and now I'm fairly certain that I accidentally listed in my vendor for 400 caps. Can I please have it back?
---
Just kidding. Congrats on the awesome find. I always get excited to browse random vendors looking for deals but then I get frustrated and give up after about 5 filled with horrible values.
---
I'll pretty much upvote anyone brave enough to even post art lols
---
Yah I was looking for the stim diffuser plan and was getting quotes for 20k online, went and did project paradise and opened a trade menu w a dude after completing... he had the plan and after I requested it he sold it to me for 50 caps lol.
---
I still keep buying things knowing I might not use it, with the hope they will increase the limit. I can’t help myself sale or not. It actually reflects what I’m like in the real world, I have a real shopping problem.
---
Look I agree the price in the atom shop are kinda wacky. But they don’t really effect the game play. The repair kits are honestly a joke when you can repair it 200% past the normal condition in game already, the scraper kits are useless, the fridge is just something to help prevent the amount of spoiled food you have when you spawn, and the collector main purpose is to get higher level players to pick up camp once in a while. That being said you can unlock atom point in game if you know what you’re doing. 
---
I know people don’t like it but it’s keeping dlc free and as microtransactions go, they have been light handed on it over all.(look at rockstar with gta online and RDR 2 online for heavy handed) until they actually start to have high end items be stuck behind months of grinding when it’s only available for like 3 days or just a paywall I don’t criticize Bethesda for microtransactions.
---
Yes, thanks for the marketing lesson.

I don't think they're lying.

The watoga train station and vender bot Phoenix in watoga have T-60 mods for sale. I'd server hop there.

Hide. You get a decent amount of xp just for living as long as possible. I'm terrible at it too, but I've gotten 5th-2nd place 4/5 times times just by sneaking in bushes from circle to circle in 3rd person. I even won a game once because the last person just walked up to my hiding bush and I hit them once with a deathclaw gauntlet.
---
The quest will continue with the wastelanders update next month

What if I tell you you should be toxic against the environment, not the other players?

You are not playing a Raider, you are having fun at expense of other's fun.

That's very bad.

There is no way to complete this quest as of yet.  Who knows maybe we will get to meet her once Wastelanders drops.

You’ve got it backwards. The revolver and bolt action can double dip on perks as long as they have a rifle stock.

Regular pipe guns can only use rifle or pistol perks but not both.

How am i the snowflake your the one attacking me because i dont love running around reading. I just made a general statement about what i would like in the game.

 My char is in WS at the moment and I can't FT, so roam on by at your leisure.  I'm mic'ed, so I can at least answer questions from anywhere.

Yeah, I lucked into a Quad, FFR, FR from the purveyor some time ago. No complaints.
---
I’m not here to tell others how they need to play the game they paid for. I’ll leave that to you. Everyone plays differently and to say “ your doing it wrong” is crazy. I understand trying to help those who have never fought the SBQ but to say us higher lvls are not doing it right is funny. Some of us don’t like being told what to do in game. Again helping doesn’t start with “ your doing it wrong, let me show you how it’s done.”

The skiing outfit is very commonly found, so I wouldn't imagine that the plans were of any value.

I don't play bloody and found with the heavy perks my modded out zealots prime ultracite gatling laser gun does noticeable damage to that bitch when she lands and also to all the adds.  great guide though and i did take a pointer or two.  but like a lot in this game, some of this is just opinion, i like the fight taking 5 minutes or so with multiple rounds of adds.   i mean i get the whole get it over with for the loot but i also enjoy the battle.

The answers for points one and two change ( almost ) every time there is a patch. Rewards, features and mechanics are frequently adjusted, added, or removed so why shouldn't people be asking these questions frequently?
---
As for the rest, griping threads might be annoying, but this is one of them as well...
---
I completely agree. But youre complaining in a post about people complaining in posts.
---
Good to know...i dont see them much
---
Damn I need to play through fo3 again love that game
---
I agree.

Was walking somewhere and found 2 skeletons, one baby carriage, dead dog and mannequins.

Locations sometimes tells stories too.
---
Youtubers like Ragechronicles are just sad to watch and they think they are good. Bullying low level players, destroying their bases and they wonder why people who don't want to pvp are salty. Or they use stealth boys and quad teslas. They are the reason pvp gets nerfed
---
I’m not telling anyone how to play their game I’m merely offering a guide and providing tips on how to kill the Scorchbeast queen quicker, if you don’t like it then why waste your time commenting I will never understand this mentality.
---
And the comment about higher levels, I’ve seen level 30s wipe the floor with level 200s level doesn’t mean anything in this game there are some high levels that barely know how to play the game and it’s honestly fascinating
---
I'm more concerned about offensive drugs, like Psychobuff, are they affected?
---
Tunnels here we go.
---
Become a bush master, cling to the bushes as the circle gets smaller.
---
I'm not good at the killing players lark in NW either, i tend to hide in bushes n take out the ocational creature ( melee preferable to mask your location). The longer you last the more xp you receive.
---
I even became overseer once without even killing a player lol
---
I use Vault 76 as a free fast travel point.  Fast traveling to Deathclaw Island from there is cheap.   The first one is on the edge of the pit where the deathclaw itself spawns.   It's in the grass / weeds so it is a little hard to see unless you have the glowing caps stash mod (on PC).  
---
I don't recall a second one specifically, but if there was a second one I think it would be to the west (ish) of the first one.   I'll have to look again... one of those memory things of actually having it in front of me may help me confirm or reject this one.

Here's an interesting link:

---
I have never bought atoms for real money and I buy pretty much everything I want from the shop.
---
Those new PAs are gonna be a bit tricky, but Scorched challenges can help with that plus you help community ;)
---
Well thank you for the tips and a lvl 30 vs SBQ is totally different then a lvl 30 vs 200+. I personally don’t PvP so I don’t have that problem but I do see where your coming from. Thank you again.
---
Secret Agent + Stealth Boy Mark III + Unstoppable Monster + Unyelding Armor + Incisor 3 + Iron Fist 3 + Ninja 3 + Buffout/Fury/Psycho = 1,000+ damage per hit
---
And if in a nuke zone, just wear a hazmat suit and watch your health.
---
Netflix.
---
Dude... You CAN do it already. Just plug in an USB device and copy them from the PS4 folders, when not playing.
---
Wait? Where can I buy a Mr Handy? Did I miss that in the Atom Shop?

Thank you for understanding, we don’t need to be at each other’s throats over disagreements haha everything (like I said in the video) is a matter of opinion these are the tips I am providing

Thanks for the correction.
---
I've never seen the BOS plans at Whitesprings, and happened to come across that Responder Vendor Bot while out and about one day.
---
My bad, I must have forgot due to drinking Nukashine ;-)
---
Ok, I watched it and I'm confused to say at least. It's not true about health scaling for quite a few patches, it's not true about heavy weapons being useless during the fight - my Primed BE 50 cal do around 200 damage each bullets and it fires pretty quick. My BE LMG is also a beast with its firerate. I won't do as much damage as glitched Meat Hook, but calling heavies innefective is... Bullshit. And generally telling people to focus on adds when unarmed killing SBQ results only in their frustration, when it turns out they won't get any loot after the fight. And showing off with the record when for sure no one benefitted from 20 seconds fight is lame. So thumb down from me, sorry.
---
This. I feel like the literal final boss of the game deserves a guaranteed 3* drop. Not that I feel entitled to it. I just think it feels odd that I’m just as likely to get a 3* with a few minutes at white springs golf club as I am from the big bad mega boss fight.
---
I like how my explosive plasma gatling does it's job.
---
Consider:  as damage increases, anti-armor effects lose value. 
---
If you are running a heavy weapons build then you'll probably want to pick up a minigun.  They benefit strongly from AA due to typically having sub-100 damage per shot. 
---
I run an AA/+RoF minigun (the Big Fucc) and it shreds bosses. 
---
Once you break 100 damage per shot though, furious starts to really grow in value.  IIRC some number crunching we did a couple of months ago determined that furious stacks to 45%ish dmg increase per shot. 
---
As I recall, most enemies have &lt;200 dr both ballistic and energy, so once you're over that per shot AA is less valuable than raw damage. And the difference between furious, bloodied and junkies is small enough that the downsides of the latter two start to outweigh the downsides of furious.
---
Regardless of the main legendary effect you choose though, I highly recommend seeking out +RoF as the second effect.   Heavy builds like to make use of PA for the aa/accuracy perk and PA doesn't synergize well with VATS. You'll drain cores at an alarming rate every time you fire your weapon. 
---
Better to ads and preserve fusion core longevity.
---
Thank you I’ll check them out.
---
I'll add you when I get on, I'm about five hours ahead of you, so it'll be 50/50 if I'm online then as it'll be gone 4:30am here. It would seem that unless I get ideas for a powerline tower base, I can't build where I want it thanks to the damb updates, preventing some builds.
---
6. Posts I'm getting tired of seeing in this forum.
---
You are right. I am also pretty sick of anything that praises another player for dropping a bag of trash in front of them.
---
I'm a high-level player, but I use a Tesla weapon to Arc and hit multiple targets. I like to give the low levels and everybody else a chance to get a shot in. But yeah it does suck when somebody One-Shots the legendaries in an event without you getting hit.
---
No bad karma your way. Just do one thing across the wasteland.... Keep killing!
---
Did anyone nuked all the fissures before the prime one yet?
---
I have a question about instigating. Does it have a range? Like with vanguard armour you can have some rads before it starts to affect the effect. Is it the same with instigating? Or does it really have to be 100% full health does 95% or 98% no longer count for the effect?
---
What the fuck? People left the UK to go to the US because the system in the UK wasn't 'abusive' enough.
---
I found mine for 250 Caps
---
Yeah, destroying the fusion core of a sentry bot deals like 10x the damage to it. One of my characters has a bloodied combat rifle. Destroying that fusion core does about 15,000 damage to them.
---
I have been playing around with a TS FFR automatic Plasma pistol recently and it is obliterating enemies. The critical spam is melting level 80 sheepsquatches before they can even start regenerating health. Scorchbeasts die midair the moment they hit vats range. I wish I knew what the heck is going on. I suspect the Two Shot effect may be doubling my critical hits. It feels like vats weapons before they patched critical chaining. I hear it is not fixed with Railway rifles; maybe Plasma's avoided the nerf too.
---
I sell everything I have at a lower price than others. Not everyone can grind the game daily for caps, plans, and gear, and they shouldn't go broke over it either.
---
I'm also noticing a lack of lower level legendaries on the market, so I'm going to start listening them, instead of scriping.
---
Agree with all your points except I think furious and instigating take longer to converge. I don't think they converge until about shot 7. 
---
Take a theoretical 100-damage/shot. 
---
    **Instigating is:            Furious is:**

---
Is there something you think is off that logic or math? 
---
Of course the other critique of instigating is that it's abysmal if you're playing with friends. You're either taking all the kills, or getting no legendary benefit.
---
New event with a 1/1000000 rare drop rate? Yay!!
---
I sympathize with your points.  However, I don't see things changing. Given that explosive energy weapons have been legacy for quite some time and no attempt has been made to reduce their power in any way makes me believe that the devs are content to let them wither away organically.  (IE, people eventually stop playing, the weapons gather dust and slowly phase themselves out of the modern game.  That doesn't take duping into account, but that's an entirely different dragon to slay)  I'm not sure it's a wise decision to simply ignore the fact that they're far and away the most powerful weapons in the game, and seem to exist for sale online in suspiciously high numbers, but that appears to be their strategy.
---
My own experience with using a legacy weapon was borrowing a friend's TSE gatling plasma for a weekend.  I normally use a very nice B/FFR 50 cal, and I was surprised at how strong the plasma was even compared to that gun.  My two takeaways were that I could kill anything and everything much faster than normal, which seemed absurd, and I was the only thing on the map that could hurt me.  I can understand why my pal plays less and less frequently now.  It's probably dull at the top of the mountain once you've taken in the view, because the only way to go is back down.
---
My personal problem with legacies is from a PvE perspective.  When you participate in an SBQ or Encryptid with someone that has the combo of an explosive energy gun and strangler heart armor, it's just a nightmare for everyone.  I've never had my game crash or freeze up entirely, but you can tell that the server is starting to shake and glow red trying to keep up with whats happening.  I can also sympathize with more casually oriented players that just aren't able to land enough damage on the boss before it goes down, which can be less than a minute in some groups.  It's kind of a bummer hearing a middle aged woman ask why the queen had no loot for her, only to have someone explain in a roundabout way that her gear and build is not good enough to hang with the folks at that particular event.  If some kid starts whining I could give half a shit, but that woman just sounded so dejected that I went into my stash at Watoga and gave her an I/E 50cal that was just gathering dust.  I was hoping to trade/vend it, but I'd rather she get some loot when she shows up at an event and participates as hard as anyone else.
---
I like it when people come and ask if they should buy the game. Most people here not only bought it, but play every day or as much as possible. 
---
Yeah, you should buy the game. But if you don't like it as much as I do, well, that's a possibility.
---
I did t say it was useless... how many times do I have to state this, I merely said that it’s a viable option but rifles are a better option and the melee is better on top of it, it’s not opinion it’s the way it goes! You can hit 200 damage per shot with a heavy weapon or 4K with a gauss rifle or bloody 65k with a meat hook. It’s fact. Not opinion and as I said in the video use WHATEVER you want at your own discretion, this is merely a guide like for newer people to get properly familiar with queen battles, and I never told the rifle to spilt focus on adds, but I said someone has to do it! And if the world record holder doesn’t represent we know what we are talking about then what does?
---
Those are some interesting facts. I am going for heavy without PA using AN LMG. As the other weapons use the ‘heavy’ weapon animation while the LMG is the only one with a ‘light’ animation like the assault rifle animation.
---
What legendary prefix to go for LMG? I won’t be using PA.
---
Currently I’m doing junkie shotguns but I’ve been thinking of going over to my instigating and furious shotguns because I can’t share any perkcards with the side effects of junkies and I miss ten carry weight. 
---
I really like the 10% more damage while aiming bonus as a secondary effect.
---
With high charisma (think perk card plus low health if you have unyielding armor), plus grape mentats, you can knock down the price a bit. But it’s still going to cost you a pretty penny as it’s my understanding only robot vendors or graham sell this.
---
It never pops up for me anymore

Ahah. For AA, Furious, Vampire and TSE which one out of these would you pick if you had everything you needed for such a weapon? Perks and gear included.

Agree, but.. (looks at pile of 60k Ultracite .50 and 65k .50 ammo) sometimes Ammo needs to be wasted.

Haven't checked today's challenges, but haven't tried this the previous time the challenge was up. I'll try it the next time then.
---
I drop nukes so V9 is out of the rad zone and we can fight her in the field. Hubs and I use heavies and even with shooting her in the air, the only time we've had issues is when someone is standing on the fence. With my usual crew plus whoever shows up we can usually kill her in 5 mins or less. 
---
Since Bethesda nerfed the handmade mag and took any teeth that commando had out, I've switched to heavies and with my BE 50 cal I can watch her health drop steadily.  
---
Not everyone wants to play your way. There's no right or wrong, unless you're standing on the fucking fence. And honestly as long as she's killed, even with me being the one to drop it, I don't care how long it takes. More time equals more adds which equals more loot and xp for anyone wanting to level up more.
---
I take screen shots via xbox then transfer to my comp via cloud.

I think you mean a sex chandelier

I just stop playing when nw came out. Im not new. I played extensively before that

On ps4 the images you put in the photomode gallery in fo76 also go into your image gallery on the ps4.
---
Deleting them in photomode doesn't delete them in the ps4 image gallery.
---
It's a bit fiddly but you can put them from the image gallery onto a usb stick and put them on a pc to post them, from there you can  also put them on imgur and post them from your mobile if you have the app

Nah, I'll pass.

Should get a plethora of legendaries
---
Who cares about your world record when most people won't get loot from the fight? What's the difference if battle lasts 2-3 minutes longer? How trustfull is your guide when on the begining you say outdated information? And I played too many fights to know I can stand whenever I want - it doesn't mean shit untill I won't start shooting SBQ in the air. Someone has to kill adds - why don't you do it also? And rifle commando sneak build do more or less same damage as my heavy with Primed 50 cal or Primed LMG. And that rant at the begining of video is... pathetic.
---
...und das sowas von sowas kommt...😊
---
And that's perfectly fine if you think so.
---
However, given their track record of failing to deliver on promises (such as when they had said they would fix the "exiting PA" issue, or the "legendaries all having the 50%lim damage" stat, as well as a slew of other issues), I personally don't put a great deal of faith in what they say versus what they do. It's unfortunate of course,  but that's the impression they've cultivated.
---
Don't use that sub use the other one
---
When you press the button, your character should become super strong and athletic like the Hulk and immediately start running and leaping back to wherever your camp is. A much cooler solution in my opinion.
---
During the world record it was an entire server full of our members , we were all there for one reason lol nobody cared about loot that day.... the information isn’t outdatted lol, let me put it this way, the Queen has 32.7k health? Then why did scrubby bits hit it for 40k 3 times and then 64k and it still didn’t die? Because it gets more powerful if more than 8 people are there, lol drop that gt and show me how it’s done then since you clearly know more than me
---
You can't mention the main trading sub because the mods are butthurt
---
I’m going...to go find something else to do.  My Playstation Plus membership expires on October 30th, and I’m not renewing it just for this game.  Thanks Beth.  Fabulous timing.
---
Had I been better informed about the BETA period and it’s spotty opening and closing times (I didn’t look at the website, Twitter, or Reddit back in those days), I might have waited out signing up for Plus by a week or two.  
---
Well, enjoy it boys and girls.  I’ll be lying in the shallow grave at the battlefield cemetery.  The Grafton Mayor says Heeeellllllooooooo.
---
He looks like a man who needs a full eight hours and then a bathtub's worth of coffee...
---
yes it does it wont attack your camp anymore when you do that
---
if it was ballshit what exploit do you think they patched ????  lol because i can promise you that method dont work no more
---
Well good for you, you want less thing then me... Things are too expensive for the rate you can get atoms from... 50 atoms a day will take 16 days.... this if you can complete all daily challanges (forget the other as they are finite...) and in 16 days your item can be long gone because they add timers to everything.
---
Legacy lasers are no where near that good, handmades and gamma guns along with 50 cals shit on legacy lasers I should know I own one of each

The quickest way on Xbox is to view the pic in 76 full screen and drop out the UI and take a screenshot of that. Then use the Xbox app to save the pic to your photos. You can also use the app to upload video captures. After that just email or upload however you want.
---
Best town arround
---
Standing on V9 does nothing. Standing on the fence does. Explosives cause lag and she is immune, basically, to them. As far as placing nukes and the weapons that's all up to the person who drops it and to those who want to fight. And again this is all according to you who want the fight to be as quick as possible. So the title should be more like "How to kill the queen as fast as possible." Yes it may be more efficient your way but that doesn't make it the proper way. Have a good day.
---
Wrong
---
So glad I haven't seen people doing this since the events change. It's like the one bright spot in an otherwise poor update. Just sitting there waiting for ghouls is so mind numbingly boring I couldn't fucking take it. Get it over with so I can collect my scripware and move on to the next thing.
---
Will have to check, esp. on my crit fisher
---
I'm sorry, but do you move so often you don't remember where you left it? I'm not trying to be an ass. I just don't understand why this should be a thing...?
---
OP's type of post is the worst.
---
Yeah can’t datamine something that isn’t there yet. The Wastelanders will have to be downloaded in a patch and then info can be dug up but as of right now we are still 4-6 weeks away from getting it from what I’ve read
---
Well for the foreseeable future, DLC content is free. AND Some mmorpgs charge a monthly fee. So with the FO76 model, if you don't want to put extra money into the game, you don't have to, and you can still play all the latest content.

You can also simply turn off the turrets and the main robot boss guy then kill the robots without being lasered.
---
Hey thank you for watching and not being butt hurt about the loot OUR members didn’t get during that kill 😂 I respect it man! Thanks

For The feedback!

Simple: scroll past it. Practice some self control and don't read those posts.

Just kill them lol

Haha i nearly completed my first silo run would of succeeded if my hack skill was high enough for the terminal as psycho robots psycho robots everywhere and me without ammo im done lol will try again when i can get a group to go through with me

It’s really not that great, I just like the voice lines it has

Sweet! What would be the runner-up?

Live player DJ will never happen because some small percentage of players are jerks and would think it's hilarious to shout profanity, racial slurs, etc.  See also the [Greater Internet F-Wad Theory](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19).  Just not worth the exposure.  I'd love to see a DJ on the radio, as well as a couple dozen more songs, like everyone else.  But it'd have to be prerecorded and vetted.
---
Ok, downvoted since you asked.
---
Hes very optimistic, its about time someone has a good outlook for the franchise instead of all the hate.
---
I agree with his assessment, Wastelanders is going to bring us new life.
---
Saw Grahm toting them around during meat week. Have also seen them at the train station vendors as well, places like Watoga.
---
Price was 8700 caps when I was using my Unyielding armor and 3x Hard Bargain perk card, which may be about as low as they go from a robot vendor...
---
I do, doesn't mean I have to like it. So do the same, yea?
---
You shot 3,000 pounds of meat, but could only carry 25 of it back to camp.
---
If you like sitting afk at your camp for hours on end, only to come back to pick up your resource spots, it's for you.
---
Counting numbers and fixing bugs are two different things.
---
Oh god no not the two shot tesla... or the crouched sent!
---
You have no idea what you're talking about.

There's no one left alive to launch them.

I just create and sell serums for 500 a piece. ;)
---
Always loved the horror elements in the rest of the franchise. Totally agree!
---
I've seen it at the BoS vendor in Watoga, but it's not consistently there.  Everyone talking about the Atomic Shop is probably thinking of the Nixie Alarm Clock, which is different.
---
To be perfectly blunt, unless you're being a completionist, the lamp is not worth getting.  The bulb is completely whited out, so even though you're supposed to be able to change what it displays, you can't actually see it.  It's been this way for months (potentially since launch).
---
Well if they are dead then RIP sorry to hear it...but if they are private maybe someone will invite me wink wink
---
Dude I can't fricking see them can I? I'm assuming they are crouching for all I know they're pulling cart wheels and foot stomping. I don't PvP as I've said it doesn't mean that I haven't been glitched into it and sorry I'm not an immediate pro that can pinpoint this dudes stance and position from a distance. I know what I seen in his inventory which was a full set of sentinel, a full set of cavalier (for when they're running... Just so I don't get checked on that to) a few chameleon pieces I thought one was equipped. Making me assume he was sneaking as I sneak in my own chameleon for the effect. He may also be mutated or perhaps have had a stealth boy and may only have been selling the chameleon or just had it, who reallys knows. However does it matter if he's crouched, all he's doing is standing there blasting away? If you PvP answer honestly: is it exciting after the first one or 2 people? Just standing.. when do u guys switch to cavalier? Is it just for show? Or for pve? Like when one actual pvper comes up to another do you switch your game or are yous all just playing one really long game of hide and seek where nobody moves?
---
A short SBQ fight means less adds. Less adds means less XP, ammo, legendary drops, and flux components (if fighting in a nuke zone, which you specifically said not to do). Thanks for trying to help, but hard pass. I'll give you an upvote for posting useful information though.
---
Last I check we are at 21 mil I think we can get the remaining 14 mil these next three days🤘
---
I run leader of the pack every time I see it just so I have a handful of level 5-10 legendary things to give away to low level peeps. I tried selling them, but it's impossible to find a balance. If you price what they're "worth" it's too expensive for the noobs, but if price them too low high level players just buy them for scrip, so I just give the shit away.
---
Weird, I've almost exclusively seen people use heavy weapons since you're not going to get a chance to tag all the adds if you don't. Also just don't run with One Gun Army (which I don't when outside of a group sharing Bloody Mess) and you're good.
---
I only know FO76 market and FO76 filthy fee market dont know any others.
---
Exploding is not a thing ty to worry about in pvp as dense chest mod + fireproof perk mitigates all the explosive damage 
---
Only time its good us vs pa that can't have dense. 
---
As for weapons higher base damage to get to 110 or close per shot is best. 
---
Minigun has to low base damage.  Think more like railway, handmade, fixer, etc
---
Yeah I have been to 1080 and I got about 20-30 FPS more, so mostly around 100.
---
I've disabled VSync aswell and tried different tweaks suggested in some forums but none of them gave me a profit sadly.
---
it's really not as bad as y'all made it sound tbh
---
If you're using sentinel and know what you're doing you always stand, and a two shot tesla? it does literally nothing; it's bugged, no extra damage and I'm almost certain no extra arc. You made it sound like a killing machine, that would go to Q25/B25 teslas, not a two shot.
---
I think you need a break down of effects not me.
---
Can't be any worse than my drunken build, but sure sounds fun nothing a grown man likes more than being held by the hand through a dungeon full of scary robots haha
---
yea usually it's not an issue most creatures have a static spawn ...i hate when it's a radscorpion those have no guarenteed spawn
---
Lol ya careful holding my hand whilst I slice through them with my mole gauntlet. Likely to lose an important appendage by accident! Lol
---
Not a killing machine what I actually gave out about on the Tesla is how much it effects my screen. For me it creates like a literal blue wiring and I can't see through it.
---
It happened to me yesterday
---
that is where i am struggling to find right now. when i went to where it showed me to kill one, there were 2 dead by a snallygaster

Killing her in seconds is a dick move. It doesn’t matter if it is your nuke or not. Let people get their loot. No one cares that you can stack every buff with a bloodied meat hook.

You may of used it before or not. But it’s a great way to plan a build ahead of time with all the needed info
---
Def think your points are in good shape for a melee build, bloodied if u got the unyielding armour it seems.

Yeah, reloading that Dragon for 2 minutes woulda been something alright :)

I think Bethesda would agree too but they think it would be too much work.

Thanks to the new junk robot system, don't need junk pile now...
---
If you can get yourself a Tesla Rifle, follow higher level players to events and tag enemies with the weapon. This is how I leveled up my mule character really quick.
---
Also, do the Feed The People public event when you get a chance, it rewards you with a couple of cans of stew that increases XP gained by 5% and it doesn't spoil.
---
No but once I tell Daddy Todd Howard destroyer of worlds he’s bound to put it in the shop and let me see my children again...

Don't click on them. It's not difficult.
---
Thank you. I might end up starting over. It’s been really rough trying to keep this build going. I run up into battles with things like a sheepsquatch or a deathclaw and get knocked down in two hits but somehow only deal next to nothing
---
If you're going to remove crates and perks it might be better to switch progression style completely, for example to one with classes and set weapons/perks unlocks via level ups and mods for the guns unlocked via NW challenges with said weapons.
---
I don't play many games, but I really enjoyed this system in Call of Duty 4 when my brother forced me to play with him years ago. I think newer games have a money system that lets you buy stuff and ammo the more kills you do, that might also be a cool idea but I'm unfamiliar with it.
---
Personally I think Nuclear Winter could use a radical restyling, including making the mode free to play so it can try new things other than the BR and branch in new directions without losing playability due to lack of players.
---
its the plasmas that are deadly, not the lasers.  lasers are weak.
---
This is good information. And it’s always nice to see when someone tries to helpfully explain their understanding of the meta of the SBQ fight— this is information that is not (and likely never will be) considered common knowledge amongst those of us who take a slightly more relaxed approach to their gaming experience.
---
Hopefully others who are in-the-know will also take advantage of this general atmosphere of “sharing the knowledge” and make use of their mics to (calmly &amp; clearly) spread word of it to all the casual players they encounter during Scorched Earth. Rather than, y’know, doing the dum-dum thing and mutely swatting at the fence-sitters or trying to block the view of the folks shooting at the SBQ— those actions are even more useless than shooting her while she’s mid-air.
---
Thumbs up, dooderino
---
I dunno. I’m lvl 49 right now (Nuclear Winter helped boost it a bit) and don’t mind high levels in my world. I haven’t done a whole lot of high level stuff yet but the bit I have went smooth because there was plenty of high level vets there to help. Maybe I’m wrong but in my mind I’m thinking when I start doing the hard stuff it will be easier when there’s so many vets around.
---
Yep. I will definitely have mutation, I thank you for your thorough explanation and sharing the build with me, I really appreciate it!
---
Do you like melee?
---
With minimal changes to your SPECIAL, you can work something like this:

Run your 5x Unyielding Armor. Also, do what you can to get them to be Sentinel on the 3rd category as well. Work towards having at least 2 of those w/ Poison Resist on the middle tier.
---
Get the best punchy weapon you can - meat hook, deathclaw gauntlet, mole miner gauntlet, etc.
---
It's weird I get downvoted for linking that lol, maybe it's just cuz I am scorched
---
I prefer it without though :)

If I saw it on sale for 400 caps I'd be trying to contact the seller to give him more.
---
No idea. But it is nice!
---
Last few vids I watched he's preferentially using a furious handmade.
---
In my experience, frog legs doesn't help avoid explosion damage, just the nerfed Tesla Rifle (thank goodness), so I just run a more useful perk for my play style instead.
---
I do too, democracy &amp; human rights are a right not a luxury
---
Very good points! Thank you! I was thinking this was almost an elimination type version. Maybe an NW-lite? I have read so many complaints about the frog legs-launcher "combo", that my brain went to full other side and thought "remove everything".
---
Amen.
---
Shotguns, melee or heavy weapons would be the easiest choice. Since you are already above 50 I'd recommend picking the 1 point cards in whatever damage perk to get the 10% on each the leveling them after. What weapons do you like using?
---
Can I have your account?! Thanks /s

---
Your Specials are already perfect for a heavy weapons build dude! 9 points in Heavy gunner (STR), 3 points in Stabilized (INT), 3 points in Bloody mess (Luck). Grab a Gatling gun (even a nonlegendary one) and you'll deal some serious damage.
---
If there was a zero perk, zero crate version would you be interested? Maybe back on Flatwoods or another map?  Maybe it's just my mind in haywire mode due to the steroids, but I keep thinking of just a "plain" NW.

If I could reliably and safely give you my account I'd send it to you right now.

All i have left for Game Vendor Buy-able plans are Mutation Serums. Just finished getting all the Power Armor plans.
---
Now whenever i hit about 21k Caps i go the the Science Wing of the Bunker throw on Hard Bargain use an XCell pop some Grape Mentats and that drops the price to about 17K (they normally are 20K). With getting the 1.4K Caps back from the Purchase that leaves me with about 5K caps so i can still buy anything nice i find in player Vendors.
---
This right here
---
Lately, every time I play the servers have been bare with stuff to do. Like events not popping up, etc. So to be able to grind something out would make it less boring for me, instead of doing Tea Time and what not which seems to pop up instead of other events
---
Chiming in with others - I don't think your build is as bad as you think it is, at least when it comes to where you've spent your SPECIAL points. With 15 points in S, you should be able to find a good one or two-handed weapon build. I use the All Rise with all the two-handed perks, and that does pretty well for most encounters. You can probably drop down to 5 in Intelligence, just to make sure you can use all of the crafting perks.
---
The other thing you should do, now that you're higher-leveled - make sure you've ditched all of your survival and hoarding perks for combat ones. Like, if you can equip a backpack, and you have a good stockpile of stuff at your camp, perks you're using to reduce the weight of junk or weaponry are less important. Fallout can oddly be a game of will at some points - Yes, Item X is really valuable, but do you REALLY need it?

Hi jacking your post because it amazes me that people still don’t know that luckyhole mine has more lead in it than you’ll ever need and if you patrol around the Hornwright location by the mansions in the Ash Heap you’ll find more iron deposits than you’ll know what to do with. All the steel and lead you’ll ever need for making ammo.
---
Wait, what? You found enough videos on YouTube being POSITIVE about the game to buy it? That's a shock.
---
yes they should.. I disagree..
---
that said.. there ought to have been loadouts from the very beginning
---
It's been many a moon since I played that game

If you Goo or Ash them make sure you are fully looting them. If you leave the piles with Loot in them the piles dont despawn and new enemies wont spawn in.

That's what I suspect, but it's happened twice now in less than twenty-four hours and if they're going to gift/glitch me one, I'd prefer one that can't fly. I guess beggars can't be choosers though

Ah, I like rifleman gaming. Il have to watch this later to see what they all are. And idk, with the whole public event system either not having events show up for, what seems like, forever, or with just tea time and basic ones popping up, I'd feel like people would use it for grinding up a level or some legendaries to make some money/script. I am at max script, but I like to have a cache of legendaries for quick sells when I deplete my caps. Or to give out to others if they needed script
---
Honestly to me this is just a nit picky thing and it’s not that much of a hassle to just swap cards. I think the way they went about the skill tree is pretty good, especially for me who doesn’t usually do builds, but wanted to later.
---
Me too, I've searched a few times to see if someone had come up with a CAMP planner, this would be awesome.

Good idea.

Can I have your stuff?

Yup. Still doesn't change what I said, however.
---
I saw the plan on PC for 10000 caps. I took a long look at it, but finally passed.
---
I pretty much sell every single plan or item in my shop for 50 caps (with a few items at 100 or 250). I assume karma accumulation will eventually catch up to me, and I'll find a serum recipe and the Fixer plan for non-ridiculous prices.
---
I try and sell low but it really sucks to get cleaned out when you know they are just going to resell. Just last night had someone buy out all my 76 Cap Meat Week Flag Plans (7 of them). I priced them cheap(ish) so everyone could get a chance.

With 15 Str, you should do well as melee, especially with power attacks, or heavy weapons  
---
(I didn't learn about power attacks until about L70).  On a PS4, power attack is R1.
---
A lot of it depends on which perks you use to fill out those categories.  Since you are 120, you likely have lots of cards to pick from, and more to merge and level up
---
To that end, it may not be as bad or as difficult as you think - 
---
While you can only move 1 point between categories at each level up, you can swap out as many perks as you want at any time.  
---
So the first question is, between melee (1H or 2H weapon?) and heavy guns, which do you prefer?
---
If melee, in Str, max out incisor, martial artist, and gladiator.
---
If heavy guns, get bear arms, the one with a picture of a tank, and bandolier
---
Get fireproof for protection against grenades, exploding cars, and SB sonic attacks.
---
If you are mutated, starched genes2 and class freak1 in Luck.  Since you have 6 points there, bloodymess3.
---
Charisma: If you usually play solo, 3 is good - I use lone wanderer2 and tenderizer1
---
If heavy guns, Stabilized3 in Agility.  Actionboy/girl for faster AP regen.
---
Nuke zones:
---
Power armor helps greatly in nuke zones.  failing that, a hazmat suit.
---
Since you are mutated, use diluted radx/redaway.   Otherwise, your mutations are supressed.  If you health gets low in a nuke zone (and you are not running healing factor), clear your rads and pop a cherry nuka-cola.
---
Two perks: glowsight - extra damage against glowing enemies (in and out of nuke zones), and green thumb - twice the flora (great when harvesting flux)
---
Bethesda does want us to kill you off right now.   we have to murder you like 14million more times this weekend.
---
The main issue with that is with higher level player getting into the 300s, you could potentially have most of the perks active in the game, so it really isn’t balanced
---
Glad I'm not the only person who wonders this every time a new headgear cosmetic is released haha
---
Same here.
---
That would be interesting, but with the already small player base, at least on PC, it will just separate players. I hope they don't let us choose the map so that it doesn't separate players, I'm fine with the game choosing it for us.
---
What? How is that reliable and safe? I'm not going to grant another person access to an account that contains my personal information on a platform I don't know (or care) enough about to do the work of scrubbing it clean of my data, and still be unaware of vulnerabilities that I didn't even think of or don't yet exist.
---
I clicked on the link, wondering what did the Megaton House look like?  However, when I saw those photos, I was swept away as everything looked familiar instantly.  Amazing!
---
I don’t have issues but I kill a lot of scorched at the SBQ fights, then loot their bodies. I’ll also hang around afterwards and hunt a few spots where I know random enemies will spawn with occasional legendary enemies. Lots of scorched running around and the normal SBs keep spawning along with their scorched.
---
The hack or the bug? They tried to remove problem legacy explosive weapons, but people keep buying them.
---
Encountered the hack last night during Monster Mash. Guy was attacking me with SBQ acid and aoe scream attacks. He also could not die.
---
Before i even knew what it was i found it in a player vendor for 200. It was cheap enough i bought it just to see what it made. Likely my best Player Vendor Purchase ever. That and the High Capacity Backpack Plan for 1000 caps.
---
I saw a fixer for like 450 today (mine was free). Are these more expensive fixers somehow better than mine?
---
There’s a lot  of perks that should be automatic...
---
Well you aren't very nice at all
---
Clearly dino1 has no clue what his on about, there are multiple sources of proof out there just a google search away, this exploit had been used for months buy the ebayers like the polish raider clan.
---
It’s honestly not hard to see that the trade market has been flooded with top tier weapons, heck even eBay and a few other forum sites are flooded with the new wave of weapons.
---
It is more noticeable now than it was weeks ago because when the script got leaked more people done it to the mass, there was even one guy selling legacy weapons at 15k a pop.
---
But sorry dino1 your looking just to be a bit of a shit stir
---
True. Very true. On the other hand, if you're a piece of scrap, that means he likes you.
---
PC or console?
---
Maybe discord? You could always change the email/pass to a throw away possibly, I'll most likely use the account to transfer gear.. so if you wanted it back it would be urs
---
Youtube has backpack walkthrough guide videos. Order of the tadpole quest. Imho the backpack mod high capacity carry weight mod is stupid and a waste.
---
Mini backpack plan is easily found at morgantown airport in a steamer chest.
---
I like this idea.
---
Fuck yes that's cool
---
Thanks for the information!
---
I’m not liking the skull mask at all...  kinda makes the character look like they have giant rabbit buck teeth... lol
---
More like a 6 six pack and a handjob
---
Whatever, it is the subject here. I can obliterate the Golf Club in many ways, a knife is the most fun.
---
 I have experimented with all the melee weapons and the Combat Knife is the most deadly, mainly because of its speed. I have been here since the beta and watched things change and Bloodied is the only attribute I kinda despise. ;)
---
I know.. I read patch notes
---
thx for saying it for those who ignore them...
---
My camp is next to Sunnytop Ski resort and I am always checking there. I always see both of the ski outfits and hats
---
It's super easy to level up quickly when you're that low level, griefers can easily help them level up and then take their stuff/destroy their camp as soon as they turn level 5 (especially since pacifist is not on by default, and there's already been stories on here of people doing just that)
---
PC of course. Never encountered shit this bad in over a decade of console gaming.
---
I once found a TSE50 harpoon gun for 100 caps.
---
Yup! Every single time... I’ve never went to a circle area and had that creature there alive...lol
---
I was originally planning on doing this but the dapper roach house was too tempting to build onto
---
I hate that I have to worry about this. Some of my best times with 76 were joining random teams to explore the wastes. And now I don’t feel like I can do it. I like the idea of PVP for roleplay and things, so I hope they keep that. Base destruction is cool in concept, but no one wants all their stuff to be destroyed and their decontamination arch to be broken. Maybe exempt camps from PVP damage?
---
Code is account based so you’re good.
---
I have zero desire to play PvP in Fallout 76. I would go play DayZ if I wanted survival PvP and I do play DayZ. If I want straight up PvP I’ll play Planetside 2 or any number of other games focused on PvP. Arranging a bunch of cards and consuming a bunch of chems and food to stack damage bonuses to see who can exploit the system the best has absolutely no appeal to me. Playing Fallout 76 for PvP is like playing Minecraft for hardcore PvP to me. Useless and pointless.
---
Forest area anywhere on river...
---
Bring fixed perks back. If you want to be God, you have Fallout 4.
---
Oh no I was saying it sarcastically cause I feel like everything good in this game (PTS included) is coming in 2020😂 didn’t mean it to come off demeaning or anything
---
I'm on the forest side at the base of the mountain which marks the western edge of the Divide, between Monongah and the bottom of Top Of The World ski run.  Because of the proximity to the Divide, I do get the occasional high level flying thing,  sometimes a few super mutants. 
---
Most of the time, if anything meanders through, it's low level ghouls, scorched, mole rats, and dogs.
---
Near Morgantown Airport is the only other place in the forest I've seen an SB flying around.
---
Also a valid strategy. I have yet to get a serum recipe, so I don't have any experience there.
---
What's the apparels?
---
plus heavy gunnery mayhem is a blast, rocking a .50 cal on full auto into a group of ghouls who think you're an easy meal - oh boy, always satisfying on the verge of needing a smoke after the bodyparts stops raining down :-)
---
*LIBERTY PRIME WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION*
---
I have to say it seems overall that most the issues similar to this are all PC based.
---
Someone at Beth plz see this post. Just making the perk cost 0 is enough for these exploration perks. They are already locked behind levels anyway.
---
Bonus points if you have a mic and Moe Cronin sound board. Or if you just impersonate him.
---
Heavy Combat Armor Chest and Prisoner Collar
---
Dude, you can collect more scrap in 3 minutes by going to a red rocket
---
might be a survey elevation marker.  
---
If thats what it is, they exist IRL, and I've read about players finding them in game
---
Honestly I’ll be tickled pink if the legendary player system was just a glorified means of adding passive skills to your character full time.
---
Thanks for the pointers! Much appreciated!
---
You don’t lol I’m 166 and I log on once a day to scrip some weapons but that’s about it. You can grind silly things for Mr. Fuzzy tokens and shit but I can’t without getting super bored.
---
I have had more crashes (freezes) lately and laggier performance in general. I just have a 1070ti but it runs almost as badly as my dual 2GB 770s did before I upgraded. It’s kind of annoying. My system IS kind of old though; still on w7 with a FX 8350. Doesn’t have issues with anything else though.
---
I know your type.  You are elitist pricks.
---
I used to be your type, and tried to tell people how to play the game.
---
Then I grew up and realized that my way isnt always the best way.
---
Yours is the fastest.  But not the best.  Your way makes it impossible for some people that contribute to the fight from getting any loot.  This defeats the purpose of team events.  Hense this is not the proper way, its the elitist jerks way to make sure that they get theirs, and noone else does.
---
Does she know as much about queen killing as you, probably not.
---
But she sure as hell knows more about teams, ettiqute, and society.
---
They are talking about the crafting plan for the fixer. Not the weapon itself.
---
I get that, but the point is that it's still pay to win.
---
I know you're kidding but I could unironically incorporate a communist flag into a really cool camp display
---
Now this is a unique feature to use on the game. Kinda wish Bethesda would allow approved mods to be used in the game without having to use outside resources. That way, they know what is being used in the game. Skyrim was a good game that used that with the steam workshop.
---
Tac Helmet for the win. Between selling helmets to the bots, I always convert excess caps into serums that I pay an average of 300-400. Light weight way to carry currency past the 30k cap. Unfortunately you can’t cash them in all at once
---
I just want the BOS flag lol
---
Go heavy weapons, it is a bit of a pain with ammo but worth it
---
The trading community and player community in general, hell I even have people who come over to my camp just to hang out and talk, now that's a community. The rare stuff like plans keeps me actually playing, plus it's not cold enough to pop in Skyrim VR.
---
So really it goes: trading, friends, rare event rewards/legendaries
---
Also try inside the Valley Galleria. The scorched aren’t low level and they do swarm a bit...but it’s smallish open area so you won’t have to spend a lot of time hunting them down. 
---
(Unless you want to spend the time hunting the down the stragglers in all the rooms.)
---
How the f did you get to 52 in a week?
---
I sort of disagree (give me a sec)
---
I feel hacking and lock picking once you unlock the skills you should be able to unlock or hack anything of that rank BUT I think the perk card should lower the difficulty where as not slotting it just gives you the ability to lock pick it at full difficulty 
---
As for things like chemist / hard bargain / super duper / ammo crafting / the crafting and construction perks -  I do think they should just be on after you get them as they are non combat and don't effect the game other then to annoy you 
---
I feel this would be a even balance as those who slot lockpick would of course be able to get through a door much faster and easier then those who don't
---
Are you looking for specific ones or just something for the atom challenges? Pastor vestments count for that and can be found in most churches or Bespoke in the Whitespring.
---
Otherwise, you get them from the Responders quest line. Paramedic jump suit, police uniform, fire breathers outfit, etc.
---
I pick fights until I run into crews that decide they aren't gonna leave me alone. You don't need survival. Just go kill enough PvErs that you get noticed and BAM. It is like survival came to you. 
---
You might need to talk some sh*t and back it up a little tho.
---
The only time I witnessed console hacking was well after a games lifespan. Went back to Modern Warfare 1 after years for some nostalgic feelings and everyone was a hacker. I ran into actual hackers 0-1 time in every console games natural lifespan. This is far too easy to do on PC.
---
I’m pretty end game and wanted to just find one in the world. I don’t think I can do the quest line again. I just wanted them to spice up my character.
---
True that, I guess I can't imagine what it's like to have a penis that fucking small, that someone would do all that for a few low level keks
---
This game is complete trash. I'm waiting for wastelanders before I spend anymore time with this game. I have several other games that I'd rather play right now
---
Agreed, it's kind of crap when compared to the other raider based skull gas-mask and helmet/gas-mask that is out now
---
Cool idea, crap execution...
---
I'm hyped over here, Boss
---
Try Greedfall, might be what you want? OuterWorlds soon also. RDR2, etc....end of year might be better all in all.
---
It is probably a visual glitch
---
especially when you have been doing the event for 10 minutes and they show up at the last second to kill it before you get the chance to tag it.
---
Ironically, Blizzard were just being good capitalists. The Chinese government holds the keys to the largest market in the world, so who cares if they're authoritarians, right?
---
I have the terminal at my camp and have never used it. I only added it cause I thought it looked cool.
---
Especially if it's one violent night and they show up and start making ruckus when they shouldn't be when it trying to farm it and milk it to the last 3 minutes
---
This has happened to me before. Just enjoy the extra stash space lol
---
Its something to grind for lol
---
Do you want to risk it?
---
You have my axe
---
Phoenix usually sells it, as does Graham
---
It's not a hassle, but my problem is I don't remember to swap until I'm either mid-barter or whathaveyou or immediately afterward.
---
Never really encountered a bug on PC...I mean besides an enemy acting funny for like 3 seconds once in a blue moon.
---
I miss fixed perks. Felt like it really locked you into your character type.
---
True. I tend to just keep those perks on and even though it’s not the best built or whatever, eh... I don’t mind
---
oh I hate when you have been doing one violent night and trying to farm legendaries and then a random just hops on an instrument or starts the jukebox to finish the event 15 minutes early
---
I was hoping this would be more about the things we should not have to ask Beth for. Bug fixes that are still not fixed(never ending gunfire noise), ect.
---
Another thing I would do is travel to Aaronholt homestead and pick some cranberries.  If you have the recipe for the cranberry relish, you can eat that to get a +10% XP bonus.  After that, I agree with the previous commenter.  Turn on pacifist mode, and grab yourself a Tesla Rifle.
---
Sorry that this post is long but I think I got all the valuable info on there. PM me if you wanna to vault 94 together on PS4.
---
PS4 Name is Aengul! Cya around!!
---
Sneak criticals are separate from vats criticals though, and you can get sneak critical multiplier outside of vats using heavy guns. I found that if I hide inside V9 (or in the trees nearby) and the queen is landed out front I can stay in caution and do about 300 damage per shot with a bloodied LMG (which fires faster than a FFR handmade).
---
I've also been doing this with my B10 combat rifle on my commando character because it has less damage drop off from range if I leave the suppressor off. I got a second rifle with the 90%RW just to prime and set up like that for the queen.
---
Things like this where you're swapping in a card to complete just one action should just be passive. It's not a hassle but it's just common sense. Its just unnecessary
---
My recommendation is 
---
Speed run nuke solo by RifleGaming on YouTube.
---
It got me the path, and tricks to do it easy
---
How did you clear it up?
---
Did you have food rot in stash?  Perhaps the spoiled weighs more than the main item so it boosts up.  Mine goes over 800 on rare occasion, just take out some ammo if you are that concerned, or sell junk
---
I get that, but idk where you draw the line between cards that should be selected vs passive. Like what about glow sighted? That has very situational utility. Should that be passive of selected? Or any of the rifleman perks. Those are situational on you using rifles.
---
Happened to me before when the weights of some items I had in my stash changed between patches...
---
It eventually resolved itself by staying overweight until I used enough things to bring it back down to 800 which took a few days. I couldn't put anything new in during that time, but it also didn't make anything disappear while being over-stashed.
---
Xbox? I have one that you can have for free.
---
I agree with this. Perk cards just make it so you don't have to focus so much on a specific build when you can just change out stats willy nilly. But I doubt that will ever happen
---
I’m so pumped! My normal getup is a witch hat and vampire costume. When I found the witch dress a while back I decided to save it for special occasions, and this is the most special of all in my book!
---
I think I’m most excited for Halloween decorations, I’ve wanted them in my camp since day one.
---
And a mute point that is. You aren't paying to win anything when you can collect more scrap in a fraction of the time it would take the robot to collect 13 items by fast traveling to and from a gas station. That's including loading times. It's negligible at worst. The outrage over this shitty little robot is.. well, outrageous.
---
I don't think you heard me. It isn't a matter of which messaging service I use to give you access to my account. The issue is access to my account in the first place. I'm not familiar enough with the BGS account ecosystem, and I don't care enough to be become familiar, to feel confident that I could scrub my data from the account. And I can't scrub data that I don't even think about deleting, or that I dont know BGS is keeping.
---
My response to you was about 90% just an excuse to take another jab at BGS, and about 10% legitimate willingness to give away my account. But I can't give away my account because I'm not granting anybody access to a platform that contains my personal data. That's BGS's job (another quick jab).
---
I like this sort of compromise approach with one small thing to add;
---
In Fallout 4 maxing out Lockpick and Hacker basically made it so you could skip the minigame (your picks never broke and you never got locked out). What if this is the sort of effect the cards gave you?
---
That is to say just unlocking the perk card lets you hack/pick that level of terminal/lock but having the card equipped lets you just open it outright. So if you have the first level of lockpick equipped you can just open level 1 locks like any other door/container. If you have it unlocked but not equipped you do the minigame.
---
Community and loot grind in a beloved setting. Workshops are also still PvP hotspots, but you have to get into a server with people who are looking for workshop PvP since a lot of people just avoid workshops entirely.
---
Is not about not remembering where is it, but rather dragging the cursor across the map, only to hit fast travel and the game decides not to fast travel, you get in to the map again and here we go again.
---
Ok. Thanks. As soon as someone visits my vendor it should clear up I guess.
---
I try to run out the front and let them die. It's sad when you see a really high level just trying to get it done. Like they got something better to do. Lol
---
I’d say you would need to either choose stealth commando or stealth rifleman. You can get some good damage from sneak shots and u have good bonus damages from choosing either perk path. For weapons I’d recommend faster fire rate weapons paired with anti armor or vampires but I would recommended anti armor the most.
---
Mr houses casino is best house
---
I saw a rumor a ways back about a possible deathmatch mode/map coming with Wastelanders, which probably contributed to these thoughts as well. I'd rather the map be chosen for us as well, even though I usually suck.
---
No I checked. I don't usually store food because it goes bad so fast. I removed stuff to bring it to 799. Now my char is overweight ☺
---
is just qol, open the map, click, fast traveling
---
been so many times when I wanna do something else while the game loads that I stop pay attention, only to realize I just move my custom destination because I miss my camp icon, or send a team invite to someone in my camp.
---
As far back as Diablo II I forced myself to accept that I could either price gouge and be an asshole, or price low and accept that people are going to flip my sales for profit.
---
Way I figure it is that as long as I help out some new person with a good deal, it balances the jerks who resell.
---
I also hate posts like this.
---
I can see where your coming from. It may be small, but it's still there. For someone like me who can only hop on for a tiny bit every week with no disposable income, things like the fridge and collectron begin to look unfair. It let's those who can buy get that advantage, no matter how small.
---
The thing that sucks about that house is the number of load screens you have to go to get to it
---
For whatever reason BGS decided it would be more fun to litter the Wastelands with unmovable, unkillable collectrons after the owner leaves the server.
---
They just sit, motionless, wherever they took their last step, on the ground, on a platform, whatever.
---
Most I've found in one place was 6 (5 frozen, 1 active) in the fields by the Beanstalk event. I'm guessing the same user was jumping in and out of the server for trades, muling inventory.
---
what platform are you on?
---
I think a good compromise would be allowing those sorts of perks to be "in the background" once you reach a SPECIAL point threshold.  8 points of charisma and you get hard bargain all the time, for example.
---
"I'm tired of new people playing" is a great attitude for a dying game.
---
Guerrilla you mean. There are three pipe weapons, the Pipe Pistol has a high fire rate and can be semi-auto or auto and have a stock placed upon it, but it will only benefit from one of the Perk trees, Commando if it is auto with a stock, Guerrilla if it is Auto w/o stock, Rifleman if it is Semi-auto with a stock OR Gunslinger if it is Semi-auto w/o a stock.
---
The Pipe Bolt-action and the Pipe Revolver cannot be automatic, their fire rates are around 3-6, They can benefit from Gunslinger AND Rifleman if you add a stock to them.
---
I did this for the first time yesterday after getting a 30% damage to ghoul..50 cal. I normal play sneaky sniper but this was even more fun ☺️
---
I'd see what I could swap out for pharma farmer and lockpick. If there's an important lock you can just swap in the lockpick cards as needed. I've mostly given up on picking locks in general play.
---
If you're on PC get Ratmonkey's sort mod. 
---

---
People have to use common sense and not do stupid trades ... I bought many things but was an average buyer and didn't do dumb stuff like handing over a explosive on trust which never works anyway .. seems silly to shut it down over that.
---
Don’t forget Travel Agent!
---
Think of it less as a passive effect and more of it automatically applying those perks any time you use them. They already want to give us all the perk cards with only a limit on special points. If it's a perk that you only use when interacting with a workbench, lock, terminal, vendor or in your own camp it should be passive. If it affects your damage, damage resists, health, special or environmental effects it shouldn't be passive. In a battle or such, swapping out cards for those perks would be a disadvantage for you because you're giving enemies chances to attack. But in your camp, or picking locks or hacking terminals, most of the time you're not at that same disadvantage so all it is is an extra step for no reason. Perhaps they could even limit these passive effects when you're in combat so unless you change them manually you can't use them.
---
It does look better if you darken your characters face and use the smudge option also so with mask it looks like just the mask and you can’t see face.
---
Rocket league: 10 bucks gets you Rocket Pass which basically gives 100+ items that you earn just from playing the game. $10 in Fo76 would get me maybe 2 items.
---
\[PC\] I have one for sale in my player vendor store. Same name as my Reddit. For sale cheap, too. (under 100 caps)
---
Had this happen with something else, didnt have enough components for it to show
---
too much qol, too many mutations.. not enough damage
---
Where do you see the counter?
---
294, I farm the SBQ and do a junk run every day or two.
---
The game is growing and improving for sure! I’ve started new characters running the quests again!
---
the game, you can do this in the launcher
---
Agreed. Micro transactions shouldn't affect gameplay.
---
The original trading community has a blacklist, multiple active mods, and is really good at tracking down alt accounts of banned players. No other trading community has anything like that
---
I agree with the sentiment, but not "as long as we have perk points...".
---
You should still have to obtain the perk card.  
---
But once you have it, it should slide right into your "Passive" deck that's always on, and you never have to manage.
---
They've confirmed they are working on load outs which should basically solve this for us.
---
Where are the best places to get aluminum?
---
I suspect it has, though in fairness America isnt painted in the best of colours in FO
---
Liberty Prime is the one of the best NPCs imo, not just because of the anti-communism stuff
---
Ps4
---
Man, this has been really bad for me as well. My endgame is also being a merchant and managing the vending machines is becoming very very tedious. I have to click items multiple times before it even registers and it takes forever to scroll through my inventory. The robot vendors have been really slow too. 
---
I think your idea is simple and very much needed for some good ole quality of life.
---
I’ve seen a decent change as well. Anytime I would go to do the SBQ 9/10 my audio would just drop all together or have the infinite loop of weapon noise. I haven’t encountered it since.
---
I like different builds and options, so I have
---
* 220 First character - rifle/commando - few mutations, etc. Was my learner, now my BOS / Enclave "themed" - energy weapons mostly
---
* 198 Pistol / low armor - shifting to berserker
---
* 130 Melee / Heavy ... responder themed, also junkie
---
* 145 Bloody commando - stripped down, pure utility - was survival char (low chems, ammo required was pretty much only steel for railway, etc.)
---
* Bloody melee - just starting
---
Gearing them all and improving them all keeps me busy. They also have different camps, and if you enjoy that you can play a bit there.
---
I also have personal challenges - like soloing content, etc. I can face-tank the ImposterSS now on a few, and that's fun. I'm working on super-amping queen damage on a few, etc.
---
I’d go 3* with class freak and get rid of good with salt. This will help you with all your mutations and you’ll see a huge difference right away with a quick change of cards.
---
I don't think they have static spawns in the world aside from the pastor vestments. They do have a chance to drop from Forest and Toxic Valley events though.
---
Probably easier to just roll alts and do Thirst Things First and Second Helpings though. You can do them in about 10 minutes from the character creation screen if you run to Flatwoods and I'm pretty sure you're guaranteed to get at least one outfit.
---
So thats why all the high level players get mad when I try to complete the event. More legendaries spawn the more time goes on?
---
Was going to suggest the Xbox app myself!
---
I find new things to collect..
---
Oh, that's basically what I meant. You still have to get the perk card
---
I wish we had our own scorch kill counter to see how much we’ve done.
---
Considering the picture painted of prewar U.S.A., Id say China gets off pretty light.
---
It depends how their loud outs work. If it's a case of just "Loadout 1" "Loadout 2" etc and you still have to manually switch between them then that's better but still not the same as what I'm suggesting
---
Yes. If you do it properly you can get a bunch of items and lot of encounters with legendary ghouls. You can farm it all the way up until 5 minutes left, but make sure you have the meter almost all the way filled.sometimes it gets bugged to the point where you have to go out front of the barn and sit there and wait for it to reset sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. For 90% of the time if you know what you're doing it's very rewarding.
---
Passive perks could be good thing and a good features for future dlcs this is a online game that we hope Will be built upon as time goes forward
---
I’m not a PvPer, but you make a good point.  
---
I just avoid those places.
---
The new VATS is waaaaay better than in Fallout 4. Requires faster decisions and actions without the slow-mo, a bit more challenging, but it feels far more "natural", so to speak.
---
The map and environment are beautifully designed, all of the different regions with equally grand visuals. The open landscape in the Bog, where a Scorchbeast can swoop down any second as much as the dark woods and constant feeling of danger in the Mire and more peaceful, less dense forests in the, well, Forest.
---
And, although a small thing, the gorgeous Blackbird paints for Power Armors and Hunting Rifles. Atoms well spent.
---
My bad! It read to me like "once you have enough stat points..."  
---
All good thogh!
---
So Edgy !
---
On what platform?  PS4 I will admit is better than b4 but I still get at least 1 Blue screen or complete lock up every time I play and often several lockup’s and a blue screen.  Load times are extremely long but I’ll take that if the stability is there.  But yes positively better than it was when the power armor issue was around.
---
I think im leaving because im not sure if this game is better now because nobody will tell me where to farm lead or if I should buy it...in fact I hate this game and Im keaving because i got one shot by this guy and I dont know why he killed me after he took over my workshop.
---
yeah i love the new vats as well it makes the game fell much more fast paced
---
I've got a 2070 running at 1440p and my frame rate drops into the 20s if I'm in a camp built near white springs. I think it's caused by the unoptimized polygons that are created by user built camps.
---
hmmmmmmmmmmmm 🤔should I take the bait, or not? 🤔
---
Clearly you have not seen the vote count of this shotpost - everyone knows it's B.S.
---
Nice alt account though !
---
Give it a month and people will forget like they do every single time.
---
Don't think it has, i know Bethesda has created a fallout shelter 2 specifically for the Chinese market

---
america isn't a dictatorship tho, you can criticize the governments so theres that
---
No. You just want it easier and easier and more convenient. I understand, but disagree that its a good idea. ;)
---
Honestly if they cut their prices way cheaper and made everything in Atom Shop more easily attainable through regular gameplay, I'd agree. But that's the problem. It is overpriced when compared to DLC prices, and it is over priced when compared to other games. 
---
$10 in Rocket League for 'Rocket Pass' can earn me literally 100+ items, plus you even earn the ability to buy them next Rocket Pass for free, and all items are strictly cosmetic. 
---
So when you look at what $10 gets you in Fo76, it's obvious how the microtransaction system is setup in a way to encourage gamers to purchase Atoms with real money based on how inconvenient it would be to earn Atoms otherwise. They even further their odds by adding discounts to items to increase impulse buys. It feels very predatory, and it's disappointing. 
---
There are better ways to "keep DLC free". Other games like Rocket League seem to have a decent system (they're also doing away with loot boxes by the end of this year).
---
I gave you an upvote, it's annoying when you get downvoted for the wrong reasons.
---
The addition of the player system really elevated the game. I've lost track of the number of times I was delighted to find some rare item that I needed to complete a challenge or improve my character in a player's vending machine.
---
Also the lore and voice acting is really well done. I found myself rushing through things but you can really get an appreciation for the lore by watching someone like oxhorn put the pieces together.
---
The game has performed so much better than what it did in summer. With that being said I had a glitch today where I was exiting powerarmor and my game did freeze. I’ve enjoyed my time with this game hopefully when wastelanders comes out the game will be more stable. Hoping for the best. Enjoy the wasteland fellow vault dwellers.
---
No - they're not.  I put in a level 50 fixer - no legendaries  - in my store for a *week* at $250 and it wouldn't sell.  People have super inflated ideas of what their stuff is worth.
---
I waited 15 minutes (no joke) to load in yesterday and then the game froze on me so no I don't notice it.
---
very cool!
---
The game has been out a year now and people are still complaining about getting killed in what ha always been clearly stated as a PvP zone smh.
---
Its simple don't want PvP don't do the the stuff that CLEARLY says you can be attacked.
---
It's not about money.  It's about value.  It's not good value.  I would spend money on this game if I actually got good bang for my buck but I'm not going to get nickel and dimed on a game I spent full price for.
---
*Todd Howard wants to know your location*
---
My favourite characters are those who keep fixed perks. They are more real and alive, they can't do certain things and that defines them.
---
💰💰Atom Shop💰💰
---
No, you are missing the point.  What I am saying is buying atoms is a total fucking scam.
---
Well rested, Canned meat stew as Zomg said(cranberry relish as substitute), if you can get it when it pops the lighthouse mothman event give you 5% xp that stacks with other xp buffs for one hour, leadership(might be wrong on this) bobblehead also, and just hard to argue they are correct surf around public events and just tag stuff, try to be in a team with inspirational max level if you can, if you do that you'll be amazed at how fast you can level, my main is level 260 and my buddy had a fresh alt and one month of doing this here and there every day with all those factors and his alt is now level 300+ im like what? lol
---
Yeah! It also tells you when biv is available for his beer run quest, grinding him to get the Rad ant lager has been quite the task 😅
---
According to the pipboy, no. Just the amount of food bar given.
---
My issue is more with the predatory pricing structure that encourages real money purchase due to the significant inconvenience and extreme length of time it requires to actually earn Atoms in game, add in the time sensitive items and discounts to encourage impulse buys.
---
No, reading the plans opens up for a chance to get its legendary version at the purveyor.
---
Nope, you only get double the food from it and you cant get sick from meat.
---
and then he smokes and entire pack of marlboro reds....filterless.
---
I used to do the lucky hole but the acid requirement was eating me alive (heh).  Now I have four to six places that I can go to for lead weights and in 20 minutes time I can have well over 200 lead scrap - no acid needed.
---
ok cool, thanks for your replies!
---
I do use my free atoms.  It's all I use.  My point is I'm not going to spend a cent on the atom shop so long as the amount of atoms I get means power armor would cost me $11.67.  That's not a good price for atoms.  They should reduce the prices for atoms or give more atoms because the prices they charge for atoms and the amount they give is way too low for how many atoms items cost.  Spending money on atoms is a scam.
---
I doubt their current engine would support something like that for multiplayer. The game plays awful on a high performance PC and crashes regularly.
---
No it doesn't.  That's completely false.
---
No. It only boosts the amount of hunger 'cured' by eating raw food.
---
If you eat cooked food there won't even be any benefit. Proof is raw glowing meat is 40% hunger, glowing meat stake is 30%.
---
I can agree, but now they need to fix the travel bug again... Seems like they can't do both.
---
Wow
---
Think it's the hair but I instantly thought of Johnny Cash when I saw this for some reason.
---
I'm on PC maybe it's just more stable on PC....
---
Furious 10mm is the way to go automatic pistol
---
Oh, thanks man
---
I think that's a lottery.
---
Followed my a cram sammich with an new red River ale
---
Same answer.
---
&gt;laughs in PC fast travel mod
---
These are great builds, and I'd recommend either/both, for sure. Take note!
---
Given that the Mystery Pick was bugged and flat out didn't work, burning a bunch of people you'd think they'd make the 50% sale a bit easier to get or at least only a minor jump up in difficulty. I agree it does seem to be deliberately out of reach, but it's hard to think of any justifiable motive. It's not like they're giving away money or Atoms, it's just a sale on legendary items, why deny us that? 
---
Also given that I can't actively track the event, it's hard to say if it's even worth doing. I don't want to be grinding out on the last day only to find out we came up 4-5 million short, something I can't personally do anything about. The lack of personal reward combined with the severely distant community reward makes it really hard for me to put Borderlands 3 aside to put in some Fallout time.
---
As long as the electorate is not bound to vote as their constituents want, it's also not a real democracy .)
---
Fallout3 and NV both had perfectly good working systems. Why they changed it to a stupid card system is anyones guess.
---
I prefer the sink more than the lucky 18
---
You could swap out pharma farma in luck for bloody mess to start - extra damage is always helpful.
---
What about mutations? Since you have starched genes I'm assuming you already have a few. Speed demon and marsupial are useful in any build. Twisted muscles will be great for melee, and the gun accuracy penalty probably won't affect you too much.
---
Challenges (almost all done) and raid.
---
Hyped and ready!  Costume will depend on what they consider a costume... If nothing else, I have my Silver Shroud outfit.
---
I agree with you. 
---
I personally am questioning their motives. The player base is shrinking, and fast. The market is laughable at what people are trading and expect for items. My question is, wouldnt it be wise to have a half off sale? At least then people could have a chance, a slim one at that, at getting an item they really want or at the very least something to trade with. 
---
People are flocking to Borderlands and there are a few reasons, more than I'll mention. 1: it doesnt crash but maybe very rarely. 2: it throws legendaries and great gear at you to the point that you have too much. 
---
After a year and still no real end game, besides the raids, people really play for the loot. The raids need a serious overhaul as the timer mixed with laggy servers puts a serious hindrance on completing them. 
---
I still enjoy and play this game every day but I really am questioning how they expect to keep people. Sure Wastelanders is coming but I cringe at what will break when that gets here, and again where is the end game for us who have been playing the whole time?
---
I have been playing with the same crew of guys since December. We kill the SBQ we do the sheepbot and recently the vaults. It's really the friends I have made in the game.
---
Oh understand, yes I've done that a few times, cheers!
---
Vendor bot says...
---
Nothing. Cuz he doesn’t spawn there anymore ;)
---
This. Also depends what outfit you’re using it with. I wear mine with the Imposter Sheepsquatch outfit and it gives me the desired extremely sinister effect

I love that things don't look plastic like most games do. I don't like game's where walls, cars, and people's skin look like plastic. 
---
And I love that we can share, and trade things with each other.
---
And the game chat is so good it sounds like party chat, when it's working right. (PS4)
---
Feck off
---
Try to only tag the edge of the fissure with the nuke, so she can be kited out of the radiation. Don't waste ammo on her when she is in the air. When she's in the air, clear adds. When she lands, clear adds, then cripple her limbs while melee focus on DPS. Keep clearing adds. Cryolators will keep her on the ground longer.
---
You should add another to the list: “Posts I’m tired of seeing”
---
I'm fairly confident what you're looking for is basically impossible. If you're unwilling to go bloodied it's going to take more than one magazine from a 10mm to kill tanky enemies. You're also unwilling to use VATS for extra crit and Gun Fu damage. You also want to use *three* different weapon classes, pistols, rifles, and automatic rifles which makes it impossible to get all nine damage ranks in anything.
---
I guess on the bright side you didn't refuse to use stealth so at least you can get some bonus damage from sneak attacks but that perk isn't even available until level 20.
---
Best of luck to you, bud.
---
I’m lvl 293, I do speed runs in the silos, I can launch a nuke in about 20 minutes solo. I also spend alot of time looking for random spawns, found a few that are fun and interesting. Also look for plans I don’t have yet. Mess around with different park cards and setups. Sometimes I just wander around aimlessly and see what I find.
---
This. And you can bet Wastelanders is gonna be a hot mess. But it’ll be a *hot* mess too, so I’ll forgive it.
---
L143 : there are quests and events I have not yet done, and a few sites I have discovered, but have yet to explore...and one or two places on my map which are marked (via tower survey), but I have not yet visited.
---
At least a ping system in NW would be really good.
---
That’s the thing. There were only 4 that showed up to help. Zero mele people or cryo. Just a big waste tbh.
---
For xbox, go to your photo gallery within F076 and make the pic you want to export full screen.  There is a menu at the bottom that tells you what button to press to hide the UI (can't remember which one).  Press that button and then tap the round, X-box logo button in the middle of your controller.  Once that brings up a menu, press Y to take a screenshot.  Once a screenshot is saved start right-bumpering over until you see "recent captures".  Then you can select the capture, choose "Share" and decided whether you want to share it to Onedrive, etc.
---
When's it dropping? I thought that was meant to happen about a month or so ago
---
Since the most recent update AA is better to have, plus with TS your weapon breaks super fast. Best rifle for PvP in my opinion would be AA FF explosive.
---
Stealth-Junky?
---
Yea, I understand you, and now that you mentioned, I have been thinking to return to Skyrim, I think I have some quests from the DLCs and achievements pending from my last character and I think also I need to play more its survival variation, which was added later. I'm surprised by the longevity of that game, which I consider Bethesda best game.
---
I think I'm not much interested in the social aspect of FO76, outside of the PvP needs (NW). And I think that obtaining rare weapons through trading in Adventure is not my cup of tea right now, because I'm not feel the motivation to obtain best equipment, for what challenge ?, I cannot use those in NW against other players (obviously) and the actual PvE enemies are so easy with my actual weapons.
---
From the primary source that is Bethesda. These are SPECIFICALLY for new content weapons like the sheepsquatch staff. 
---
Calm TF down.
---
I want to know if she will keep that chipper smile five minutes after her first workshop PVP interaction.
---
That should upset her. Unless... She wins and gets a taste for the bloodlust...
---
Come back when Wastelanders releases, might feel like there's more to do
---
Where are the dmg perk cards 😂
---
Cool. I have over 2000 acid and can get 400+ lead scrap in 5 minutes from lucky hole.
---
Thanks!
---
Thanks for the explanation
---
I feel it's a on/off situation depending on server.... sometimes it runs great then there are times it locks up or disconnects. Most of the time it disconnects me, i'm usually at the train station trying to sell/trade and get an error CE-34878-0.
---
I've made that suggestion awhile ago.
---
For free aim, you may be happier with the AAE. TS seems to greatly increase recoil and the second projectile has terrible spread. I have a TS FFR plasma pistol and it would be a nightmare to use without vats.
---

---
You'd love the one I saw yesterday.  It was built on the radio tower outside Whitesprings.  
---
The stairs were all bear pelts, the floor Deathclaw pelts.
---
No idea.  Hopefully its right after this last push of clean Appalachia
---

---
Bulk your lead and aluminum it weighs less bulked.  Otherwise I’d recommend cutting non-fav junk to 50 max, and the rest to as much as you can find.
---
Fav recommendation:  screws, ballistic fiber, adhesive, springs for sure, others depend on your playstyle and what you use.
---
To reiterate: it's only for post launch items like the sheepsquatch club or the fixer.
---
I mean, imagine how stupid it would be if you only got items for plans you read. That would destroy the random intent of the purveyor. I could just start a new character and read only plans of weapons and armor types I want.
---
Distant Thunder is a good one, can sometimes ruin the whole group with a Fat Man and then move right on to Bug Bend Tunnel
---
Can’t have ff and explo on the same roll.
---
The Fixer, Bear Arm, Shepherd' s Crook, Sheepsquatch Club, and Sheepsquatch Staff all have condition checks that no other weapon has. If the player hasn't learned the crafting plans for those, they will not drop from the Purveyor.
---
Also they’re just gas bombs, I was hoping for actually destroyed areas.
---
You'll have that sometimes. Timing could be a factor, or server population, all kinds of reasons. Decidedly frustrating when no one shows up for the party.
---
Seeing as they wanna add pay to win aspects to the game I do t see why they wouldn't.
---
Yeah that's the conundrum. The other option is to sell low level legendaries that would be good for a high level player to use to level up their alt characters. So if you get low level 3\* especially with any of the weight reduction perks, price it high and sit on it.
---
Word.  I am so sick of clicking on a fast travel destination, only to get dropped out of the map screen.
---
Love the cheap camp finds it’s like a Christmas present
---
There use to be challenges to take pictures at them. I know where 3 or 4 are.
---
Aside from trade bugs or fast travel bugs, the game has been pretty smooth for me.
---
I’m not really sure. Probably just crafted some ammo and weight went down.
---
I would be happy already, if I would just need to press ONCE and not 5 times to travel somewhere.
---
I am approaching level 300 on my main and still feel like I have a lot to accomplish because of the goals I set for myself to complete. My goals are:   
---
1) Obtain all crafting plans and recipes   
---
2) Complete all game content (quests, modes, events, raids)   
---
3) Completely Min/Max a build  
---
If your goals are loftier and you generally enjoy working towards them then those hours and usually levels start to add up over time. My goals are definitely on the grindy side of things so I completely understand if people get bored of the game a lot earlier on, your mileage will definitely vary. Some things still are challenging to me because I often have to solo content that was created for groups of people to complete like raids, encryptid, SBQ fights, and Project Paradise in order to work towards my goals above. I don't really care for PvP in this game because I feel as though it is lackluster at best experience. I say this because with all the bugs, server lag, different types of gear,  consumables, perks, and such it can be impossible to understand why you lost a fight with someone and how to improve. I tend to have my PvP  fun in other games because it is a bit more consistent. Survival didn't really do anything for me because it wasn't a real survival mode and it was to spread out to be a decent deathmatch mode. What I think they should add:  
---
**New Survival:**  
---
\- Fresh characters only  
---
\- No legendary armor or weapons  
---
\- No mutations  
---
\- No PvP restrictions except around Vault 76 and inside Whitesprings  
---
\- No tracking players (seriously hated this)  
---
\- On Death: drop some ammo, chems, caps, and all junk (% based with a cap)  
---
\- Greatly reduced drops so that resources are a major driving force of surviving (Do I walk up to that dude and ask for water or do I kill him and loot him?)   
---
\- Make disease and injuries harder to deal with  
---
\- Hunger and Thirst are more important (not drain faster, but if you are severely dehydrated you aren't going to be sprinting around)  
---
\- Sleep is a necessity not a buff (not asking for people to have to watch their character sleep for 30 mins) /Last location rested is a respawn point  
---
\- No Fast Travel  
---
I would easily dump a ton of hours into this.  
---
**Deathmatch:** (they have had deathmatch mode partially completed since around launch)   
---
\- Team and Solo submodes  
---
\- Rewards like nuclear winter  
---
\- Ranking system  
---
\- Ton of indoor and outdoor locations to keep it interesting  
---
\- Gear and characters from adventure mode are used (otherwise it would be too similar to NW and gives something for PvPers to grind for on their characters)  
---
\- Weapons and armor condition do not degrade  
---
I feel like NW and Old Survival really are too slow a paced for people that just want to go around killing people, this would be a bit more focused action.
---
Ok... then don’t buy them? I don’t buy them either and am able to buy anything I want from the shop lol. If people stop buying them they will adjust prices.
---
I've been running that alot last week or so, if I'm lucky I get 1 legendary enemy. I just got bad luck on the RNG.
---
Agreed.  It used to be many times a session.  The last couple of weeks have been stable.
---
I like finding and trading for top-end gear myself. It keeps me plenty busy. It seems like there’s always a piece of armor or a weapon that’s just a little better than what I have, and I find that hunt enjoyable.
---
I also like to challenge myself with solo attempts at content designed for groups, using the gear I worked hard to find.
---
If soloing SBQ or Encryptid is trivially easy for you, you’re a way better gamer than I am. Getting through either with 19% health or less and not dying requires all of my focus.
---
Ahh I didn’t know that, then I suppose AA FFR TS would be the best but the repairs suck.
---
It's probably a survey marker. If you fast travel to Top of the World you should end up on one.
---
An easy solution is giving multiple loadouts.  An extra 1 or 2 loadouts would mean I could swap out to crafting or lockpick/hacking and then back to my regular build.  It could also be used for those who have multiple weapons and builds they use.  Make it so you can go into the perk screen and cycle them so it'd be quicker than individually swapping them out.  Would be a better solution I think.
---
If it is, they should read the terminal secret from FO4...
---
6. I keep getting disconnected Server no Responding, even after 543968734098475094837 patch notes saying it is improved, like today, Charleston Capitol Bldg + lvl 30
---
I think there should be a button that comes up when you have over ANY player to "ft to camp" of that person. say someone helped you out and you want to see if they're selling something you could buy just to be nice. or if they're done up in a cool costume and you want to see what they built.
---
25000?! Hell even 10000 would have been excessive. I find it honestly insulting that people expect you to pay that much? Like do they think that it must be *soo* great just because they're selling it? To further make it worse, if you did buy it, it'd essentially delete caps equal to how many they had at the time, due to the 25k cap, something which presumably they overlooked in their greed...
---
You probably also dont know that ballistic weapons weren't affected by the AA buff, it was just for energy weapons. Qnd it wasnt really a buff, they fixed them because the AA perk had no effect on energy damage.
---
The house unmourned is the best house
---
What does Queen of the Hunt provide? Curious because I run it a lot but I’m not grinding it for anything....yet
---
Yea, sometimes I feel that due to my Bethesda fanboyism I was suffering of Stockholm syndrome with this particular game and trying to find the same longevity and virtues other of their main titles had.
---
Yes, I had a blast while it lasted (my play time on survival) and for the 50% discount I got the game I think the trip was worth it.
---
And I know, this is more a multiplayer game and their other games were single player. But why is lacking too much from the PvP aspect when in any multiplayer game this is a fundamental option ?.
---
I really think FO76 suffer for not offer all the virtues that a single player game have, and neither the virtues that in any other multiplayer game seem obvious.
---
Lvl 188 Daily routine: complete daily/weekly Atom challenges. Perform equipment maintenance and  craft ammunition. Sell various items to game vendors. Farm legendaries (off and on). Participate in the occasional world events, such as SBQ. After all that's out of the way, play in NW for the remainder, as it's dynamic and never the same thing twice.
---
Last time I played the VATS system was so broken I couldn't even use it... I'm assuming it's better now?
---
dont fight back, he cant kill you if you dont attack him back.
---
I would’ve thought so, but even the atom shop is acting like it has no new content!
---
Nearly 400 here. Going for those last few rare plans/outfits/god-roll weapons I don't have. Playing with my friends. Building multiple characters designed for different weapon and armor sets. Making interesting themed CAMPS (I have a melee specialist character who lives in an actual fucking Viking long house and uses a Bloodied Swing Speed Grognak's Axe as his primary weapon. Long blond hair and beard, face paint and scars, the works.).
---
AA and TS can’t happen on the same either. They’re both major modifiers. There’s a list somewhere that explains them all.
---
I had a junkies ff 90% reduced go for 40k recently. Was told that’s one meta for pvp nowadays. I’m not sure if +10% while aiming can be a 3rd roll on that, but imo that would be good.
---
It was at a workshop. I couldn’t stop it.
---
Hahaha yay ok cool!
---
Honestly with what’s going on in China right now, we could use some liberty prime
---
God I hope they have suggestion QA to weed out troll posts like this lol. Tbh I would pay real money to be able to upgrade perk cards I already know to the animated version. So you did produce a good idea OP, and I'm not kidding at all
---
All three were alive for me today.
---
Usually I just start the quest, then accidentally complete it over the next few days.
---
That sounds like an issue on your end if it took 15 minutes to load into advwnture...
---
I did and the water is fine
---
Rule 1:  Dont hang out in workshops if you dont want to be killed
---
Rule 2: dont carry all your junk, put it in the stash box
---
Rule 3: dont seek revenge, it keeps you in PVP
---
Rule 4: Dont hang out in workshops if you dont want to be killed
---
don't know when you were playing but it was fine since i started(e3 this year)
---
Idk if they fixed that yet. If I have a workshop and they try to take it in pvp active. Even when I respawn I get blasted without trying to reclaim. I got killed like 8 times in a row at thunder mountain and had to run away for it to stop. I think it's a bug idk
---
I’m with you on that.it feels server specific. Yesterday i was with a friend for sever hours and i got dc’d 4 times.. we moved server and hey presto, no more dc’s...
---
Fast travel and loading took about the same time. The menu also took about 10 seconds to open. Every other game I own runs fine except that one. It's odd and it might just need a fresh install or something, but it also shouldn't be happening either way.
---
Junkie’s is probably the way to go for what you’re looking for.
---
Honestly, pistols are better suited for VATS unless you’re using TSE. Even then, you’re going to be spending a lot of ammo because you’re going to lose a lot of Damage-per-shot without Concentrated Fire in VATS (In terms of PvE). 
---
For PvP, Crackshot will help on Guerrilla/Gunslinger.
---
Damage is capped, so whatever you can hit with is what you want to use...
---
Lol you hold a grudge whining kiddo?
---
I have a (IIRC) paramedics outfit which I renamed "responder gear" for use in such named challenges. Can't recall where i picked it up however, as it was ages ago.
---
AAE is the better option.  The TS breaks faster, and is less accurate.
---
Also, with AAE, you can ditch the peircing mag and go with higher capacity.
---
What is IIRC?
---
It is a stupid question, or maybe you should come first and answer him so I don't need to.
---
It’s a lot more stable, but there are also fewer players...
---
None of the perks that players are asking to work seperately or passively impact combat.  So letting them be sperate and passive won't affect pvp balance.
---
Junk is the one thing you shouldn’t keep on you since it’s the only thing dropped when you die
---
Confirmed in the ESM. Only affects non-heavy ballistic (or energy for hefe) weapons. Also to note that hefe doesn't affect weapons with the keyword Plasma or Laser either. So not sure what that leaves that it works on. Will submit a ticket to either fix or clarify.
---
I have easily 300+ hours and never had an issue until yesterday. It was odd.
---
If people are buying them... they clearly think the pricing is fine. You think people don’t realize how much money they spend on the game and what they get in return? Lol
---
Sandman, I watch your videos and see you use power armor a lot. Have you considered using the new strangler power armor? Its pretty damn good.
---
Lol what a bundle of laughs you are, clearly you have not done the research, you are just as wrong about this post as you are thinking this guy is me lol People like you are the reason this world is fucked as it is, Allow me to tell you to get fucked cuck and welcome to the block list.
---
Good for flux!
---
... I've completely moved my camp while drunk only to have sober me not know where it is.
---
Last time i had it as far northeast as possible.
---
Ah okay.  I just remember drum being 90 😥
---
I mentioned yesterday during conversation that Strangler with an Explosive Gatling Plasma and the right cards would be viable in PVP as the ability to stack the acid damage would be pretty good.
---
That 25k vendor was a moron. Serves them right for over-inflating the price. Much like anyone that thinks paying more than 300-400 caps for a serum is fair.
---
It's on the road map now
---
It is okay to have some weight reduction cards are to put them on when in a pickle. but to run them all the time is kinda pointless especially if you want to pvp. I try to help everyone out I can I'll show anyone my build, weapons, armor. but some people don't want help it seems like they like run cards that don't help them and they pvp and get murder. and also keep your stash clean so you can store juck so people don't take it and if you claim a workshop please know someone can take it and engage pvp
---
This is so true. I have been playing on a level 25 character and PvPing with up 120 players and when I kill them they get mad and call me a cheat or say I'm hacking. Most the time the fight happens it's a higher level shotting me.
---
Someone was selling it according to some else you can get it from forbidden knowledge
---
Love him or hate sandman, he spitting straight facts.
---
You can learn a lot here, I don't play melee so no clue.

---
It's also worth emphasizing here that pacifist mode is a thing.  Nobody should ever come out of pacifist mode,engage in pvp, OR seek revenge if they are not comfortable with the consequences.  I dont like rebuilding my base, so I'm never out of pacifist mode near my CAMP.  When I have forgot, and had to rebuild...that's MY bad.  GGs to those who caught me slipping.  
---
Same logic applies to claiming workshops, and installing a kill switch for your vending machines.  If you claim a workshop, the wasteland isnt your only threat.  Roll the dice, chances are you'll have control for awhile but you should know what your risking.  If people are taking your workshop and wrecking your CAMP, make your CAMP hidden by not having your Vending machines on.
---
Long story short - YOU have responsibility for your play style.  Pvpers are not to BLAME for playing the game a different way than you might.  It's not griefing to initiate pvp at a workshop, and it's not trolling when you hit back out of pacifist and you know you have bulk junk on you that you've been farming.  Does it suck? Sure.  But your playing fallout and not Sims 4.
---
Are you on Xbox 1
---
There is no such thing as *advantage* over other players in a game that isn't really PVP. Having your food last 50% longer is less than Good With Salt achieves and farming junk with a robot is just about the second worst way to farm junk short of accidentally picking it up. You're paying for the aesthetic of the fridge and it just so happens to have a very minor function. My food still constantly expires in or out of the fridge. Your paying for the robot to roam around and say quirky things and he also happens to have a very minor function.
---
Is there just no place to get it in the world? I walk around Flatwoods and everyone has responded gear. But I can’t loot them.
---
This already happens, you've never seen them?
---
FYI this week's raid is a bore. You basically run around finding 50 red cards.
---
Also the raids are very difficult, team based, end game content. They can be alit of fun. But can also be quite frustrating if you do not know what you're doing
---
When my teammate Don started playing with us, we used him multiple times as bait. Easiest way to get free caps.
---
What vault 94?
---
Agreed. It also doesn't make sense to have cards like 'bodyguards' and 'lone wanderer' on at the same time. Adjust to situation.
---
Yes, the raids rotate weekly. With 3 different raids. Right now we are on melt down, then wash out, then dead in the water
---
thank you for taking the time out to look up &amp; attach link!  unfortunately, im a simple ps4 console peasant
---
Faster swing speed +1 str is the best roll you can get.
---
You're welcome. It didn't take much I use that mod myself.
---
AMEN took me till level 198 to figure out I was doing it all wrong I’m at 211 or so now and still working , but I’m tanker than most and can hold my own , PVP changes this game to what it should be , I was almost ready to quit because I had collected everything I wanted and was tired of the queen , someone would attack me I would try to fight back and die even with the mass amount of weapons and armor I had collected and trades for , now when someone attacks I don’t know what will happen they may win I may win but it’s going to be a battle unlike any you will get from PVE
---
I don't use 1 handed. But I use a BFSS +1 Str DCG and Grogs axe(for power armor situations)
---
Big bend tunnel!!
---
not talking about pvp. survival isn't a thing anymore. I don't understand why camps are still destructible. pvp should only be at workstations. or put another game mode back in.
---
There was a glitch that let you build bottomless greenhouses in other people's camps, but not ones with foundations.
---
Faster Swing Speed and either +1str or 40% Power Attack.
---
Ps4 myself
---
what is this "teem" is it a chem?
---
100% agreed.
---
This makes low level pvp so unfair!
---
It’s nice to see a reasonable, thoughtful approach to explaining the PvP process. Appreciate the teams videos and have particularly found the recent one from Joe on his build helpful. Keep it up Talisman.
---
Debatable
---
Thank you, a reason to keep doing forbidden knowledge.
---
I'm level 107 and barely touched any of the quests apart from the ones to get the backpack and excavator armour. Just love killing 3 stars and trading
---
Here, some more info I gathered (builds are now kinda obsolete, but I tried to keep the tips and tricks updated):

👍
---
I wanted to get it as clean as possible and explain it as much as I could. I unfortunately can't put links or I would showcase todays vid, etc.
---
&gt; You think people don’t realize how much money they spend on the game and what they get in return?
---
Obviously given some of the other comments.
---
Idk if it's banned, but playing defiantly will make you loose social credits there.
---
My Grognaks bloodied axe has 40% faster swing and +1 agility is that any good??
---
I downloaded the xbox app on my PC and can save directly from there :) I just screenshot each one from the photo album with the UI hidden. BUT that being said I will pass that feedback along!

Maybe next year, no news and no announcement to get excited means nothing good

Hard bargain should not be passive as switching the cards are sometimes necessary to get an item to an appropriate price-if the game would let us sell an item that may be worth more than what the vendor has it’d be with you as the need to get a specific value for an item would be unnecessary
---
Some people say yes some people say no I wish I had an answer
---
I got blapped by a level 240 against my 81, could ONLY respawn at Vault 76, then the game crashed entirely, so no chance to get back to my death loot doggy bag.
---
One day Bethesda will make a stable game. But it is not this day.
---
Like the clean red one you buy at the toy store? It's a toy. Why would it work properly? 
---
Why don't you just use the real Firebreathers helmet?
---
Lol what a funny guy, Im currently just having fun reading your post history, looks like you have a ego complex always have to be right and feel like what you say matters, You my friend are what we in the uk call entertainment, its easy to sit behind a pc and say random things thats been proven your even more proof of that, though I do feel alittle sorry for you most people who act this way have had a horrid childhood for that you have my condolences.  
---
 
---
Think I join the guy above though and give you a block for now, I honestly really do mean this when i say go get some hope and I wish you well
---
Yea, you can't loot them off of corpses.
---
I bought fallout 76 for my gameboy. 
---
Who needs life insurance, right?
---
TALISMAN!!!!!   Lol.
---
Alternatively, I’m waiting for bethesda to release some cool responders outfits on the atom store. But they only seem interested in raiders
---
Niice
---
I see them in low level vendors a lot. Find a level under 10 with armor in their shop. It'll probably be in there
---
The Rider skins especially should count, since you are basically parading around as one of the 4  horseman.
---
My main is a quality of life weight reduction food build. It has damage effects and defensive effects but not for pvp. I dont engage in pvp with this character and am currently working on a strick pvp character. My main still takes workshops I just dont carry any junk on me. Very good post very informative thanks
---
It’s a myth that a CAMP stops him from spawning.  I’ve even seen another player spawn him and he was hanging out in my CAMP.

Thanks for the tip! And that’s a great way to help out new bees.

Well at least u spent time to try and help for that I thank you
---
The nostalgia...
---
P2W then though you guise
---
it took me about that time
---
This, the Firebreathers Helmet is a gas mask.  
---
I used this outfit/helmet for the first 60 levels, just because of the gas mask (then I built my X-01 and never looked back)
---
The fireman outfit and hat is a rare drop. Otherwise, roll a new character or check player vendors. People sell the quest line outfits all the time.
---
I used to display my 5 PA sets on PA stations along the far wall. ....
---
Why cant our PA stations still do that?
---
pretty sure they said it was coming in november
---
I’d keep it for sure.
---
Not to be that guy &amp; down vote away but... I play more than two hours a day &amp; I've been here since closed B.E.T.A; you know, back when the game deleted itself and attempted to re-download at less than ONE kbps. Many of us took off work to play on launch and we didn't even have the ability to access the servers for the entire first day. Since then we've been met with nothing but bitter disappointment (aside from maybe one or two patches: Nuclear Winter &amp; Project Paradise). Nuclear Winter, which brought a resurgence of players who are now all gone, has half-empty lobbies and a ton of hackers on PC. It's practically unplayable now. And up until a few days ago there was a couple week span where Project Paradise straight up didn't work. **Let's not even talk about the raid (if you can even call it that) where players items have been getting deleted for months now.** Tons of game break bugs still exists and bugs that were patched out have returned. To be quite honest, aside from Wastelander's there's really nothing to be excited about for Fallout 76. What's coming December? Or 2020 (aside from more delayed content)...? Why do they deserve ANY sort of praise from their fans again? But right on queue, Tuesday hits and they add over $40 in atomic shop items to their in-game store. There is little urgency with Bethesda and it's quite alarming to be honest. I'm starting to think they like the way their own farts smell. If Wastelanders is met with more disappointment it will be time to leave the Fallout series to the newer generation of fans who have far lower expectations.
---
Very good well written
---
Or maybe.... other people... can decide how they want to spend their money. Anyway this conversation is going nowhere. Good day
---
I got it for 400 RIGHT before they announced it was going to come to the perveyor. yeah, some folks don't even sell anything below 5k. I don't have anything listed as high as 5k.
---
Yep, that was a few patches ago
---
Got both a DCG with FSS+STR and the Unstoppable Monster.
---
Since we are working on lore driven stretch goals to clean up the wasteland, it may be sooner than you think.  
---
They may be keeping quiet to prevent all the theory crafters trying to datamine and figure out the expansion before it ever launches.   The probably dont want people trying to publish false information that may change before the actual release. 
---
This is actually a smart move by Beth.  I would do the same if I was going to launch a new product.
---
Ah, nice!
---
Like the way you call this a sandbox. Cause that’s exactly what it is. You got to create your own thing and do it. I mean made me a bar so I can fill up one of my vending machines with alcohol, nuka colas, meds, drugs ect. And I really don’t care what people think things are worth. If there a drop in game, no mater how rare there still obtainable free, so I know exactly what I’m willing to pay. And if my inventory is maxed I sell stuff so cheap that the buyer can make a profit from in game vendors and I usually empty there caps in the first 30min of game anyway. Don’t like buying plans that are obtainable unless it’s relevant to my game play at the moment. Like yesterday I bought an automatic .38 combat rifle receiver just to waste my .38 in my troubleshooters combat rifle. I mean it was basically a three shot on robots any way. What I do ask a lot for are weapons and armor but still like half the price of what people are asking for.
---
Thank you. It was my biggest problem with power armor
---
I personally don’t think it does but I go full unyielding for the hell of it
---
Regarding the username - you know who deserves to have their bulk taken?!?!?  Vendors who sell fusion cores that are at 2%.  :)
---
But what weapons? Like the sledge, ski sword and DCG?
---
Did you say you are on PS4? I can throw you a paramedics jumpsuit. 
---
I have a Responders cop character. We'll call it recruiting for the faction. 
---
I'm on my way to visit my mom though. It'll be 4 or 5 hours probably.
---
You learn the mod by scrapping the mod... Not the weapon. Didn't know this for months.
---
and picklock and hacker perks have to go to my perks every time I need to get one item from a suitcase
---
I do not believe it to be P2W since it is more a case of making sure all "costumes" are tagged equally. The upcoming patch is suppose to make sure plenty of free in game items are tagged to count as well.
---
Would also sort of explain why when I loaded into the game the second time, I still had walls left over from the previous camp. Thing is that those went away and I had nothing left over, then I came back to my camp later on the same server, and, poof, levitating collectron.
---
I just did there and there was loads more than anywhere else I’ve done.
---
We already have this on PC with a mod. It's great, but it's not the solution most players are asking for.
---
well, that is weird and not at all intuitive.
---
The videos of that are funny 😂😂 and when I first started watching you guys.
---
Are you talking about Bethesda? The same that teased the marine assault mask playable in the burrows with a new weapon that never happened??
---
It's all speculation but maybe wastelanders isn't as big or as promising as we expect
---
Um... no. Unstoppables costumes count. Are you saying that is P2W? Lol
---
For 2 handers: Super Sledge, Grognaks, or Bone Hammer.
---
For 1 handers: Combat Knife, 
---
For Unarmed: DCG, Power Fist
---
For Unarmed/1hander: Meat Hook (it benefits from both perk sets)
---
I've seen this firsthand unfortunately.
---
Damn that looks nice babycakes
---
BROOOOO you don't remember the health bonus when they came out?? They were p2w for a week! Should have used the Vampire costume as an example for this facetious p2w argument but not a lot of people remember that outfit
---
This is exactly it.  
---
The last time they tried to give us too much info about an upcoming addition, people made a bunch of assumptions that were not true, and since YouTube rumors tend to be taken as fact, people were pissed that what they thought was coming didnt.
---
Idk how to PM you, but sounds alright to me. I’d appreciate it.
---
No, your luck SPECIAL doesn't change how often Super Duper procs. 
---
The Super Duper perk card (at level 3) says 30%. I've approximated that value on high and low luck characters, and don't have fantastic results merely due to the +15 from unyielding armor.
---
Hahaha alright man
---
I bought the Black Rider too. 
---
Put it on my Ultracite, because it was feeling naked as my only PA without a skin.
---
I love it.

Screenshot or lies.
---
Okay got
---
It
---
I don’t think that is right
---
Remember, Doom eternal was officially delayed to polish it before launch, but from Fo76 we haven't heard anything
---
They will add this soon, and I agree it's enough
---
And me a couple of days ago
---
Stated November since QuakeCon panel. 
---
https://youtu.be/gLbWx61Xo6A
---
I agree with all of this. Just wish that other strats were viable, like melee.
---
look i agree with all the problems that you listed and there are tons more. i have lost the count of times when an npc t-posed towards me. or how many times I've seen floating objects or recently one of my toons lost her head when she came out of the power armor.
---
i just think it would be nice for us as a community to give some positive feedback from time to time so that they can be built upon.
---
and honestly i think Bethesda is under a lot of pressure from the investors who i think own more than 45% of the company and that they're recent behavior (since 2015) is caused by that and not by them loving the smell of their farts.
---
Ah, sweet! I’d prefer the DCG than. The power fist has this annoying hissing noise. I’d go bone hammer or groknaks as well. Thanks buddy!
---
I dont think so, i crafted tons of ammo, with variable luck, and at the end, always got around 16.6667% more rounds, with super duper.
---
Having no life frees up time for hobbies lol
---
Lol. Nobody cared about that beyond youtubers who didn’t actually play the game. The mistress of mysteries outfit also counted and was not in the shop.
---
They tgave us a breif intro at E3.
---
Which is what most games get before launch. 
---
Bethesda has always been more willing to give out too much info before a launch.   
---
We got a glimpse at E3, be happy we got that.  Some games we dont even get that much.  Remember the horrid launch of No Man's Sky with all the release promises that were not there causing 99% of the people to buy it to return it, even steam allowed money back, and they dont do that.
---
I only started about 3 months ago and I'm a lvl130, so I think u mean lvl 200 and up. I have yet to complete all the quest or play in all the events. I personally love trading and the making of things to sell. Been playing alot with vending actually bought a second ps4 to be able to have more vending machines and more characters for storage. So personally I have a long way to go before I get bored. I am currently working on a character just for pvp then I will work on a character for taking down the SBQ. Yeah a lot to do, to me it is a great game.
---
Just hit me up with a friend request. 
---
My psn is HRockit
---
I believe so I've left junk in a suitcase and when I jumped a team mate was able to access the junk, I can't confirm it's only from memory and I've thought nothing of it. I server jump often and if anyone needs anything that I know I've dumped in their world I'll direct them usually to the suitcase. Perhaps it's only while online I have no idea, perhaps it was erased as soon as I jumped and my team mate just never mentioned it wasn't there. I will actually test this as I'm playing now and let you know lol.
---
I vender them on alts for 450, no way Id sell for less than that I have plenty of alts just for this.
---
Nice
---
I don't know if you realize I was being facetious. But there would be people who say "this is getting closer and closer to p2w." Like they did with the refrigerators, which also are not p2w
---
I've never heard of that? Have you actually done it or are you just regurgitating something someone said one time?
---
I’ve been away from the game for a while. I didn’t realize power armor could be stolen :o
---
How did that happen? Did you dump the frame and they took all the pieces off it?
---
I didn't know other players could take your PA. Because I get out of it all the time and just leave it and it comes right back in my inventory.
---
You missed the most important use of vats. It is not just about easy aim for bad players. Critical hits chunk through assassins sentinel armor making it the superior counter to any damage mitigation builds. Pistols have no stagger chance meaning critical vats builds are mandatory.
---
I carry a DCG and a Bone Hammer.  I havent found Bloodied knife I like yet, so no 1 handers just yet.
---
But also thanks for the heads up, I won't be doing that anymore.
---
personally I'd just give players a general perk slot with points per a certain level range - something like 3 to start +1 per 10 lvls up to 50 this would give 8 points total at 50
---
Supposed to be getting it then, yes. That's one of the reasons why this month has filler-challenge events
---
the acid doesn't stack infinitely just so you know. and it's crashing people, mostly on PC but PS4 too.
---
Tested jumping world's and the the stuff stays. I'll jump back myself and check them too just be to sure lol.
---
Clearly I missed our sarcasm lol. The unstoppables thing was the biggest faux rage thing haha. I had completely forgot about it until you brought it up.
---
I don't use prime ammo, I just need yellow cake flux for making serums. That and a just in case my decom shower breaks that I have enough to fix it. :)
---
Did you "drop" your power armor instead of placing it down?
---
Where do you get the mods? Any static spawn?
---
If your crafting your PA on a power armor station, they can just nab the pieces of by unequiping it.
---
This can only happen if you drop it.
---
You didnt set it out to equip it, you dropped it using the drop function from your inventory. 
---
If you just activated it, they wouldnt have been able to take it. 
---
Be more careful with your gear.  You cannot steal someones power armor unless they drop it.
---
well fallout 4 is also a solo game so the unstoppable hacker / lockpicker in that wouldn't be great in 76 
---
personally I enjoy the lockpick and hacking I do however wish more quests would let me use them - I remember back in fallout 1 and 2 when litterly you could sneak around main boss fights or just talk them down (the final boss of 1 could be talked down and most of fallout 2 boss could) and I feel they should really add more styles of missions rather then just shoot it all repeat
---
He stole it while I was crafting it.
---
Yea I noticed that my T60 and Raider pieces were all off their frames. Unfortunately I didn't have any frames in my inventory so I ended up throwing away the Raider pieces. I guess it's buggy.
---
They can't take it while its laying out, but when your crafting it at a station they can unequip the pieces and take them.
---
I found a level 250+ selling radshield for 800 caps each yesterday. Makes me wish  we had a karma system in game or the ability to cause CAMP damage sometimes. Pure price gouging.
---
Nice,
---
No he stole it off my power armor rack while crafting it and unequiped the pieces
---
Weirdly you learn it from scrapping the "mod box" and not the weapon. It is possibly a bug as probably not intended to work like that
---
Oh I see, sorry that someone took it from you. Its horrible what some people will do to get things.
---
This is where I went back when I was going the kill x scorch challenges
---
The most fucked up part is the fact he's gonna end up dropping the pieces because he's overencumbered
---
How many does Large hold Stinging is Armor piercing and 35 rounds.
---
I was modding the helmet when he came to my camp and snatched the pieces off.
---
I hope not, if we've learned anything from Bethesda it's that everything they do with fo76 is rushed and riddled with bugs and glitches. I really really hope they push it back until next summer or something so it doesnt break the fuck out of the servers and constantly crash the game more than it already does.
---
You mentioned being mindful of what legendary effects your using.  As in, "instigating" works way better with a melee build engaged in pve because there is no damage cap and your usually hitting for huge numbers - but "instigating" is pretty much a waste with someone who's using an automatic weapon because that bonus wont apply after the first hit.  What are some of the least valid legendary combos you see that perhaps people aren't doing the math on correctly when they choose to use them or price a weapon for sell?
---
Where can I find those?
---
It is BS how much they nerfed it.
---
I'm sure the game has improved overall, but it's still not the quality of experience I'd expect from a game with a triple-A price tag (on purchase) and a cash shop.
---
I'm still hoping Bethesda will release a harder difficulty mode, as that would bring me back for the general gameplay alone, like exploration and stuff. And as far as community, I agree the people have always been nice, but without text chat I can't really enjoy that either. :/
---
These are just more ways that the game is really behind the times. I still think they can fix these issues but it seems like they're in a slog.
---
Try all the different weapons and armor and make it a point to visit places you don't normally go. Prime your guns, launch nukes and farm special mats and flux. I like to burn extra mats building at the airport.
---
They are RNG in some robot vendors under mods. Raider vendors are the best bet
---
Probably going to scrap it for like 10 steel.
---
What's funny is that those skins came out before the ones you're complaining about lol
---
Someone give my boy an award upvoted and saved post absolute facts.
---
I’ve never had this problem, and I’ve never heard of it happening. Not that I’m some kind of power armor expert. You are placing the frame down and not dumping it from your inventory, correct?
---
@OP how did you leave off "scrapper" from your mock foodbuild example....shame shame lol
---
This is what is needed things explained without making people feel bad.  Play your style that is awesome but this and the video on the tubes of you help so much to educate and show maybe doing things  little better to make your game play much better.  Even if you hate pvp this advice holds good for pve aswell and can vastly improve your pve battles.
---
Stay safe guys......really no scrapper!!!
---
Damn, now you're making me feel even worse!
---
It's not don't worry
---
I've never really been a PVP player in this game or some of the others I've played like Division 2, I always preferred to explore craft &amp; such. However that being said, I appreciate the time you took to write your post &amp; provide some insight into the type of gear that would be useful to better prepare my character for a possible encounter. I generally avoid workshops &amp; have pacifist mode on, but I try to look at the world that Bethesda created in the manner it was made to be looked at. In a wasteland environment not every one is going to be a "nice" person &amp;  not try to kill another player &amp; loot their gear. PVP does have a place in the game. After all, in that situation it would be more like the survival of the fittest. I've been taken down a couple of times, but when I have been, the person that did didn't loot my junk &amp; in fact left me a nice 3 star legendary, weapons I still have. It's all part of the game, &amp; frankly it doesnt occur all that often &amp; is easily avoided in most cases.
---
I've been looking at some of the armor sets &amp; gear you mentioned &amp; have been saving up cards &amp; perks to transfer my build around. Any other tips you have will certainly be helpful to me &amp; many others I'm sure. Thanks for the post!
---
I expressly wrote that I was sticking around for Wastelanders, so no you can't, because I need the stuff and anyway I'm not in the habit of giving things to lazy internet illiterates.  ;)
---
240 here. I run around doing some daily and weekly challenges, get daily caps from vendors, and constantly look for better gear without using trade forums. I have so many weapons on my main that I can’t name all of them. Currently looking for better armour. My build allows for a lot of flexibility in PvE so it doesn’t feel as repetitive
---
I'm not even mad? I was just taking a poke at the whole collectron mess....
---
Yea I was modding it in the crafting bench.
---
Agreed.  Or even an easier way to respec your build to adapt to patch changes.  I was a strength build and I'm still trying to move points around just so I can be viable.
---
It can be even more frustrating when you know what your doing, run through just fine, and then lag out before you get your rewards. All in all not worth the time, effort, or resources.
---
Well, he doesn't want full meta builds and if he is willing to swap out perk cards he can run more damage for a particular type of weapon.
---
Sounds like you dropped it, then went to mod the helmet.  Or he wouldnt have been able to take your peices
---
Bloodied is the prefix

My quad explosive handmade keeps me happy. PVE and PVP.

I’m confused.  How am I being stupid?

The top end AP mag is 20 rnds.
---
Another commentor said the same and suggested it was a bug. In case no one knows how you normally gain mods, this is not how it works usually even if it does in this one instance. You scrap items to gain its mods

He stole the helmet too.

Scrap = more junk.  Conflicts with weight reduction.  Plus they got enough steel anyway. :)
---
It can't, unless you drop it.
---
You might need to refresh yourself on the details of the question. If you're _not_ playing the game, because it "isn't good" as you say, then obviously the question did not apply to you, hence your answer was irrelevant.
---
Impossible.
---
I just hope they see this post and update the darn numbers. Come on guys.
---
&gt; ... but I don’t run a successful AAA game studio.
---
Neither does Bethesda.
---
I consider myself a pver as I don't pvp as often as I did prior to the assassin/sentinel nerf and even I despise food builds. why on earth would ever pick, say, strong back over 5% more damage?
---
maximize your build's potential, not your carry weight. things like batteries included are understandable, PA builds with GLs often carry dozens of cores. but if you're trading damage for weight then there's clearly something wrong.
---
Tuning into the youtube channel and twitch streams is very educational as well.  That, plus the crowds pretty cool too.
---
Whole lot of straws you're grasping at there, buddy.  
---
You can go ahead and say the truth. You don't want to hear any opinions you disagree with. Go reread the question yourself.
---
Okay ty
---
Well, it's not actually "new" (as I've had that when it was first released), but glad you like it.
---
The Rider skins should count, but I dunno if the other power armor skins are really costumes. They did see that costume headgear + Power Armor would still count though.
---
I suppose you could submit a support ticket to Bethesda with his user name and explain the situation, how did you know his age?
---
Only carry them back if I have the spare capacity. At the prices I have them for they generally disappear within 20 minutes or less. I don't really care about the money value of it, moreso that it's worth something to someone else.
---
I know it's cliche, but I am in love with the witch outfit still.  :)

---
Why grind the scorchbeast queen for useful camp items, were you can buy them at the atomic shop for the low price of 7 dollars. Heres a perfectly functional fridge and scaveging station for any end game player. 
---
(The sad thing about this joke, is that you are right there should be bettwr camp items, but we will most likely have 2 pay for them).
---
Sell them for what you can if you can. You do you. 
---
You'll just get outsold by the people that sell for 350, 300 (more commonly). They're not that hard to find. Even seen them sold as low as 175.
---
It's laughable that people were pushing 500 caps as a baseline price for serums.
---
Yeah, you're right. One of these days I'll go all out on my food build ;-)
---
Been wanting this for sometime as well. Bethesda said there will be an implementation of this in early 2020.
---
I run three accounts, and I don’t have space to sell them. 🤷‍♂️
---
I don’t know what platform you play on, but I’m on PC.
---
I can either press E in my pip boy to “place” a frame down, or press R to drop it from my inventory. E is my interact key and R is my drop/reload key in case you play on console.
---
“Placing” it keeps the frame and anything attached bound to me individually, and it cannot be interacted with by other players in any way, under any circumstances. Dropping the frame unbinds it to my character, and others can take or add anything they want to it. It’s the same as throwing away unwanted stuff in a paper baggie.
---
Barring some undiscovered glitch, I’m 99% sure you dumped the frame on the ground while crafting. Not that it was cool for some rando to steal your stuff, but you basically left the keys in the ignition and someone drove off with your new sports car. I’m bummed for you, but hopefully a lesson was learned.
---
If you’re on PC, I’ll make you a new suit for free.
---
Even if you are not into PvP, putting aside how you have become used to running your character today and taking an honest fresh look at your build can lead to significant improvement in PvE as well.  Consider it a stepping stone to building more confidence and being open to doing better at PvP down the road.  Go to [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) and set up your current build, and play around.
---
Ok but where do you get acid?

I didn't mean to insinuate that you were mad, I just meant the community should only get mad when that happens. Though I don't believe the collection or the fridge is a mess.
---
How are peeps buffing with the Syringer?   [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Rose%27s\_syringer](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Rose%27s_syringer) works in PVP?
---
I’m willing to swap cards when necessary
---
🤣 only one or two at a time, which is all I have space for. But because my camp is south of the canyon bridge that goes to wade airport you can quite often hear them being used on a Grafton monster, scorched pack, and/or supermutants occupying the apartment complex almost instantly.
---
Just a thought what if you have three perk cards of every level adjust accordingly? Like having a level 1,2 and 3 commando and want to balance it with 1,2 and 3 man and make a even ish combo? It’s a good way to get rid of those extra points right away once you settle on a build but if you want to spec again it kinda is pointless. but perhaps only focusing on the damage cards just so you have them but it cost a average 6 points so I guess it’s up to the player if anything just thought it might make getting that compromise a bit easier
---
I love churches with a shot ton of guns downstairs.
---
Insult bot would be proud.
---
I have hundreds of hours logged in the game and I've never built one. I keep Sunkissed rank 1 up almost all the tim3 and just passively get rid of rads.
---
Protectron Scrapper is more more useful lol
---
Seemed like the best thing to hide in the basement haha :)
---
Any ___pass type thing is like that, but even the ones that have those passes also tend to have a bunch of overpriced cosmetics as well.
---
The pricing really isn't that bad in 76, considering you have the ability to get that currency by playing, regardless of how long it can take to get. Most games with microtransactions don't give that option at all.
---
Do you know for sure this is a child, and not a younger sounding adult?
---
I'm 20 and I've been told I sound like a young boy. (Hits your ego really hard when you're an adult woman)
---
Unsure as to what exactly you were getting at but I can say that if we use commando as an example... it makes more sense to use Commando 1, Expert Commando 1, and Master Commando 1 for the 3 available points, as this will be 30% damage as opposed to running an individual card to max (i.e. Commando 3) which will be 20% damage.
---
I see this as a common mistake in many people's builds.
---
Let it be. Some people just sound like they're drunk by the way they talk but they're not drunk. Set and age limit no old or young people
---
We knew he was young, just from the sound of his voice, but as we discussed things with him he was in a "over sharing" mode where he talked about his schooling, and that he'll be 12 soon.  We wondered if he was just trolling us, but I've been a designated driver enough to know how a conversation with a drunk goes, and this was spot on.  Fixating on stupid things, randomly over-sharing, switching emotions quickly, occasional slurring of speech, etc.
---
Ppl usually refers this "blueprint" as a loadout of cards. And yeah this has been one of the most asked features for console players since PC has their own 3rd party thing.
---
I kill all the mole miners in Blackwater mine, and scrap all the breathers. I'm pretty sure the breathers have aluminum, something on mole miners does. And ski poles.

Although the word you are looking for is 'definitely' the use of 'defiantly' in that sentence is oddly fitting ;)

Use the Luck perk to press y (on xbox) to search for meat. Will work on creatures that you haven't personally killed.

FLUX IT!
---
Apparently West Virginia had a lot of  (NPC) communist sympathizers, because I see red stars on buildings everywhere.
---
Tried that. I also tried adding the cards for putting advanced power armor mods on power armor.
---
TBH I kind of want to do a food build now because I never considered bucking all character potency for maximum convenience.
---
If ya ever see a spare plasma grenade plan let me know
---
&gt;The reset happens 20hrs after you sold the first item.
---
☝️ this is the correct answer.
---
There were two mods for New Vegas I never played without. Signature Weapon and Signature Armor. As you leveled up so did the weapon and armor you marked as "signature" and could truly turn them into some straight beast mode items as you accumulated more and more XP with them.
---
Might be a little difficult to balance, but it'd really be something fantastic to see in game.
---
Cards play a huge part in this game it’s a struggle to get right if you are used to previous fallout games like many of us are. Starting out I went into it like any other fallout game at around level 150 when survival mode came out I realized I had it all wrong. I started over and focused on agility and perception and read all the cards before choosing. I’m at 177 with that character now and still feel like I can move things around and points around. After watching pretty much all of the rage videos I’ve noticed how your cards have changed. Weight cards are useful when you need them but I realized I don’t need to carry around every single type of ammo I find if I’m only using 3 weapons and I don’t need to carry around 40 fusion cores if I’m only using pa in a nuke or gathering lead. Same thing with the stash sure you found some good gear but your not using it. Why should I let it sit in my stash for months just taking up weight sell it trade it give it away.
---
There’s some things I wanted to ask you about builds mainly it’s about quantum’s and cola but,Why u only run 3 points of commando, what kinda stims you prefer, and if you run auto stim pieces. 
---
The other question is how you feel about the possibility of cross platform becoming a thing as there are many hackers on pc and the advantage pc players have over players with a controller.
---
What I meant was having each rank of a card and getting a optimal rank to get what you need without much sacrifice like having sufficient heavy gunner while having lighter armor as a example
---
I missed you.   Ill look out for you this weekend.  Thanks!
---
You know what would be perfect in the basement? A cult of mothman shrine

Not your typical "Foodbuild" here but I agree 100% with all you said. My build is a bit different from most other foodies as I'm a bloodied/stealth build.  I'm trying to ween myself off being a damn hoarder (all types of junk) so in order to combat this, I'm going with armor pieces with the weight reductions.Little by little getting off cards like strong back, etc..  Sort of a meeting halfway between foodie/PVPer.  I used to love to play survival for the extra xp and the nervous rush of watching/listening to a team of killers run/jump right past me, as I'm in a bush with chameleon on, clueless to the 1000 lead, 300+ pieces of ballistic fiber (Harboru can testify to that) that was right in their faces. To my foodie brethren, stay out of the workshops if you don't want to pvp and don't complain if/when they kill you. YOU made that choice to own it even after the warning. Stay in your lane or try to modify your play style as I'm doing. Hopefully I'll be ready when the tax collector or Appalachian PD come thru.  :)
---
The paramedic jumpsuit drops from Responder events too
---
I think the max scrip should stay at 1000, but when we get a 3 star let's say for 100 scrip, we should be able to have a rejection button to reject it for 40 scrip back not affecting our daily scrip total in the machines.
---
I'm still waiting for the dual SMGs we see in the live action trailer.

Hey OP look I took your idea and made it better!

---
Understood. I use 3 because I've had access to 3 and I don't want to move and level up too much and then the meta change again. 
---
I believe PC players would put console at a huge disadvantage with how hacked up it is and the fact Mouse has a better aim than thumbsticks do.
---
There are multiple methods of syringer buff but that is one method that is being used to kill idle players. If you still have Rose's Syringer... shoot a friend and wait about 2 minutes. You will see them stagger and lose about 1/3 of their life. If they are bloody builds, you may very well see them die. There are other syringers that are being used as well.
---
I don't understand
---
Jesus no. I don't want them to add any new features until they fix EVERYTHING that's been plaguing the game since it launched. Much less animated perk cards (which are already in the game. Why sell us a feature that's already there?)
---
Yah, I stuck one in my machine for 1000 caps. Sold pretty quickly.
---
Can't see a reason to charge more than that.

I was thinking about switching over to rifles later on when I get the mods but I've never really liked automatic weapons in any game. I usually pick enemies off from a distance with a lower fire rate weapon then switch to a semi auto one up close and use VATS cause I like crits. I used that class builder some of yall have posted tho and came up with this. What do yall think?

---
The perk cards, you get 1 animated card, sometimes more. I think we could buy a fully animated pack in the atom shop. To keep it non p2w, it could be cards we already own just animated versions
---
Because I want all of my cards animated
---
You can't save every kid, or even any kids.  The best thing you can do is raise your own well and be the best example you can.
---
Thank you for the feedback. There are plenty of tricks that players use in this game, including some I may not even be familiar with but thinking outside the box definitely helps. Any specific questions on your build, you can always ask. 1 thing I will say that I see frequently for example is people running a single damage card on 3 instead of 3 individual damage cards on 1 (i.e. running COMMANDO 3 for 20% damage using 3 points, instead of running COMMANDO 1, EXPERT COMMANDO 1, MASTER COMMANDO 1 for 30% damage using the same 3 points)
---
Things like that are what I would point out and suggest players double check for.
---
Yeah that looks glitched. Also, stop trying to sell it you scum!
---
Okay I won’t try to sell it lol removing the post now haha
---
You could be right about everything you said but those are assumptions. Just be aware that that is what you are doing, don’t treat it as fact. In an age of internet and online trolling, and the fact that there are adults out there who sound much much younger than they are, and even speech impediments out there that can make a person sound under the influence, and/or many people talk abnormally. Anyway, Occam's razor, I’d say you’ll have to let it go. Lots of people out there in bad situations that could use help, but what can you do here? You can’t take on the problems of the internet world especially with protective privacy policies in place.
---
You already have a chance to get an animated version of each card with each perk card pack. If I saw this in the atom shop I would feel more disenfranchised than I already do about the game. It already reminds me of one of those greedy little Facebook games from back in the day.
---
food buffs give +95% damage and +3 str without using any perks. not sure why anyone would skip those if they are minmaxxing enough to use stealth boy mark 3's. and you forgot the most essential perk for sneaking, Escape Artist. You might wanna rethink your perks
---
Yeah, I camped there for a long time when I was level 20ish, and I spawned him a few times even with my camp right there. I’ve heard mixed things, but maybe it’s an issue of him being so rare to begin with
---
Helping my troops keeps me pretty busy.
---
I’ll lower my health to near death, take two shots then toss two grenades. By repeating this fifty times i will turn my vanilla rifle into a Bloodied TSE 👌
---
LOL Someone had posted that to me on here and I wanted to share that as well.
---
But yes, keeping in mind damage and defensive mitigation can definitely assist in PvE as well for sure. Its why some people at the Queen can't do it and why others show up and absolutely melt the Queen. Focused builds work.
---
100% this is how you get that mod. Don't down vote me.. Go buy one and scrap it. Takes 3 mins.

Sweet find dude!!! The guy wanting 25K for it is gonna be kicking himself in the ass, has his head in the clouds.
---
I will admit that I made the mistake of buying my Medic Handmade from a random guy for 12K, he wanted 17 but didn't have the cap space. Afterwards I could still hear him and his buddy talking about it saying how I got a good deal and blah blah blah.... Ya sure there bud I feel like I got ripped off
---
I want a sulpher fountain just like in whitesprings.
---
you said you kill adds until she lands. there are no adds until *after* she lands...
---
Haha
---
Junkies, AA, Furious... FFR being the top for second perk and explosive being second for handmades, rifles, and overall ranged weapons. Swing Speed for melee with same kind of line up.
---
In terms of pricing, everything is everywhere. I've found Quad teslas for sale in people's vending machines for 400 caps, or 20,000 caps. LOL I can't dictate the market, only explain what I know to those who may want to know.
---
15k?
---
And I would honor that request if Bethesda didn't give off the vibe that they have forgotten about their hardcore fans; the players that mod their games and got them to where they are today. I understand the importance of pleasing your investors (even if that investor may be Providence Equity) but at what point is it considered selling your soul...?  There's a Fallout Shelter 2 which is a China exclusive (the irony). I'll hold my praise until I see Wastelanders...
---
Yes I know that but it stacks enough in PVP to be viable I'm sure. It probably crashes players who use it on an enemy with a ton of life, like the Queen, etc.
---
I don't think it would be as big of an issue in PVP.
---
This post was very long as is. I can't cover everything but yes you're right. Crits cut thru armor mitigation, and using Concentrated fire with headshots guarantees crits for the most part.
---
I too am a humble man
---
You think this game can limp on without a major update for another 6 months? That's very optimistic of you. 
---
They definitely need to ensure updates are polished, but that doesn't mean they can just slow those updates to a snail's pace. A dev and management team that is actually good at their job can do both of these things... there's not need to pick. And if the FO76 team is one that can't handle both, then changes need to be made because this game needs serious help if Bethesda want to protect the Fallout brand and even their own.
---
I've seen someone use it and be viable... it stops being viable however the instance someone is using chameleon or stealthboy as the inability to vats pretty much negates the usage of melee.
---
That was my exact thought. I used to game on pc only and got sick of the high price point to upgrade every other year so went to Xbox. Honestly would be stoked to play in game with all the rage team tho. Y’all are funny as shit and it’s refreshing to see people have fun with it.  
---
You mentioned junkies weapons becoming more used. I traded a piece with a guys the other day that had a JE laser and damage was showing over 200 on his build. Basically bloodied damage number at full health with small amounts of stat loss.  
---
Also started carrying grounded serums to suppress the negative effects so that my energy damage doesn’t get needed at all. I usually only use super stims that matched with first aid at 3 and field medic seems to allow me to take a lot more damage
---
There are some like one britt named ESO i been fallowing for yrs that talks more positive about the games. I also watch Kevduit who has also been positive.and InnovSurvivalist.and gamerMOMover. Thease have alwase been positive with 76
---
A lot of creatures/mobs have a built in explosive resistance. It's part of their DR. That's a big part of why Faster Fire Rate weapons perform better than explosive weapons. The bigger and "tougher" the creature, the more explosive damage they can resist. I'm not sure why it's that way; it might have something to do with their own use of explosives, as an effort to prevent then from killing each other too frequently. I don't rightly know.
---
Yeah. That all sounds right. I know the XBOX guys are big on Cola Nut as a backup substitute stim kinda deal. Its viable as well. There's plenty of tactics and approaches in this game.
---
Chinese people are good, communism is good, "communist" government is bad very very bad.
---
I'm not buying it...
---
OP would have had to intentionally dropped it instead of deploying it.
---
A nefarious player would then have to come along, then remove all the pieces off the frame because they're unable to enter the suit. They would have likely waddled away completely encumbered.
---
OP's fault, congrats to the lvl5.
---
The guys selling the 2% fusion/plasma cores are actually quite handy to have around if they're selling them dirt cheap. You can use them as crafting components for ultracite fusion/plasma cores that will get refilled to max capacity after being crafted. It's basically ultra ammo for free.
---
You get bulk ammo scraps in great quantity in the raid and they are simply amazing because each has a lot of materials for just 1 weight.
---

Don't downvote me then! Hypocrites on Reddit I swear smh. lol nah for real I didn't downvote, just reiterated that if it does work then it doesn't work like that my guy
---
Well that's awesome, I'ma have to do that then
---
There’s some very sneaky level 5 running around 😂
---
The only prestige perk I could want is the ability to fast travel while overencumbered. You could put it on a cool down so it could only be used once every 2 hours or something. As I food build I need all that crap that I have hoarded and I refuse to give up my precious.
---
My thought is go on Twitter and ask PlayStation Support what can be done.
---
I'm at the end-game with my second character. If there's no serious content added soon, I'll be playing something else by summer.
---
Do you drop it for crafting because of the timer that pops it back into your inventory? Because that timer doesn't start until you stop interacting with it. You can place it, and then use a workbench to modify it and no one can touch it.
---
I'm with everyone else. It sou ds like you dropped it on accident, or dropped it thinking it would pop back into your inventory while you were modding it, which it wouldn't.
---
It was in the latest bug report for that "atn raw?" Guy. He digs thru the code. Had a convo with him about it. Seriously i just found out less then a month ago.
---
Why 5 months?
---
I like that hairstyle
---
Even if a player typically uses weight reduction perks for everyday casual questing, it’s not hard to swap them all out to maximize offense/defense for events and in preparation of difficult fights. Between the nuke launch alert and detonation, you have a couple minutes to fast travel, swap perks, eat food buffs, read a magazine and make sure all your weapons are repaired before the SBQ pops her head out of the ground. Even if you’re overencumbered by swapping off weight cards, you can still move normally until AP runs out and guns don’t care if you weigh 800lbs. I guess Dodgy takes a bit of a hit, and VATS isn’t operating at peak performance, but you’re shooting at a bat the size of a barn, so hipfire should be more than adequate on most guns.
---
I swap out 5-6 offensive perks for healing related cards during Encryptid, and eat a bunch of radaway to go from bloody to full health. That way I can grab all three pylons, hide on top of the cabin and potshot the Impostor while using a stimpak periodically. DPS and aggro magnets are in no short supply as participants join, but finding someone willing to act as a single conduit, let alone all three, is pretty rare. I just figured out how to do it efficiently by myself and the event is always a breeze.  Once the event is over I just swap back to my bloodied build cards while standing waist deep in toxic water and I’m back to my regular questing layout. No piles of nuka cola needed. I average about ten stimpaks per event, sometimes less if a strong bloody build is laying the hammer down.
---
Strangler Whaler ftw.
---
Yes, just like the rewards for the last event.
---
Yes they usually show up in the next atom shop update after success.
---
Haha, I hadn't even considered that. But that would save me the 10lb of Excavator I carry around for those instances.
---
This game has no PVP.
---
1. There is aimbot.
---
2. There is refreshable stealth mechanic that does not brake when you fire / take damage.
---
3. There are weapons that you don´t have to aim with, and if you miss you actually do more damage. ( Teslas )
---
4. There are so much broken shit in this game that pretending to be PVP player just makes me cry blood. PVP has to be competitive. No way to be competitive in a game where duped gear took over. Or do you want to tell me all your sentinel gear with perfect rolls is farmed?
---
I play since beta and going for PVP was my goal. After they announced survival i was hyped and theorycrafted builds that i would use. They fucked up thought. 
---
First thing they failed to do was that they enabled adventure characters to play survival. This was right after the duping started. Now me playing this game 12 hours a day thanks to my surgery watching my friends get Best in slot gear from random player for 100 caps made me completely stop thinking about ever touching survival again. The competitive aspect of this game died the day duping hapened. You could at least say you spent alot of time to get the gear and you worked for it. This completely eliminated everything survival could ever give you. Right before they added damage caps to survival everyone was running around with quad tesla and stealthboy. We are playing FPS with RPG elements but the diversity of weapons / armors / builds is non-existant. As a competitive player that reached top rankings during my prime age playing World of warcraft ( s1-s6 gladiator ) and League of legends ( peak Challenger 700lp+ EUW) I can say that this game has no PvP scene until major rework and wipe comes, maybe if they add higher level gear they dont have to wipe but still, this game will never be competitive and pretending to be a PRO in this game and insulting casuals with food builds is just insane. Just imagine screeching on someone 15 years older then you. I watched some of your videos, these are funny but sometimes you and your friends just act too highly, Insulting other players becouse of their builds and griefing them. Thats not PVP. Ganking some 40 year old dude in workshop that has a 1-2 hours of game time per week makes him angry. You try to defend your community saying : You can't fault PVP players for taking the time out to figure these approaches out. But when i watch your videos all i see is abusing those mechanics to start PVP. I cant imagine being casual farming junk i need for several hours just to get invited into a group pretending that they need help just to get oneshotted and being klepto´d. What a shame.
---
Good to know!  Never thought about that.
---
Here is a 411 for you all. Parrents do allow there children to Drink as long as they stay home. Fuck when i was 5yo thats when my parrents got my lil brother and i started.
---
I hear it doesn't but I swear it feels like it does but have absolutely no proof!
---
Simple, you dont
---
For PVP, what cards are useful under Charisma,  if any? Runnin' solo
---
Please no. On behalf of myself and anyone else who works in a customer service environment, I dont want October through December to be songs about mothers kissing Santa in this game too.
---
I definitely kill stuff on the ground when she’s flying. 🤷‍♂️
---
They honestly ruined two-shot. They didn't nerf it, they destroyed it as an option. Terrbile accuracy, and I mean like you're blindfolded with no aim, breaks after just a few fights, and not to mention the drum mag nerf on the handmade... they destroyed the TSE Handmade. Get the AAE. In fact, get a faster fire rate instead so you don't have to use 5 perk points to do very slightly more damage than ffr.
---
Tenderizer, Suppressor, Lone Wanderer, Bodyguards... there are a few but it would depend on playstyle IMO.
---
That's ok, you dont need to play fallout constantly. Would you rather play with new content that runs smoothly or watch the game crash every 15 minutes because the servers cant handle everyone interacting with the npcs at once.
---
And to PSN they would have his local jurisdiction for a welfare check.
---
Yeah but the decontamination arch doesn’t require atom
---
PVP can be a lot of fun with the right people battling for workshops. I have also had some really fun matches in nuclear winter.
---
Happened to me when raw flux turned inert 🤮
---
That's great speculation
---
Eh, remember when we all thought Charleston in the trailer was a nuked area with dynamically generated rubble? Instead we have an orange filter.
---
Liberty Prime online!
---
Same answer
---
I would hope they would work out the use cases to avoid such simple abuse. It could be a calculation that includes the variety of targets, over a period of time, and the total damage inflicted or absorbed/deflected, plus whatever other criteria might be useful.  Of course, excluding things a player could do to self-inflict.  The biggest way to avoid that, however, is the "over time" -- I would personally include in-game and real-life time factors.  Even somebody grinding for a week straight shouldn't be able to get a 3-start whatever.
---
Next tuesday

Thank you I did not know that

Same for Dragon bayonet?

Add me

I like a mix of lone wanderer and suppressor when playing by myself

The main story line, starting with the Overseer and the Responders, will lead you through the areas in order of difficulty and have you join all the major factions. The Forest -&gt; The Toxic Valley -&gt; The Ash Heap -&gt; Savage Divide -&gt; The Mire -&gt; Cranberry Bog.
---
*Don't* just steam through the main quest line, you'll find yourself under-leveled for the area you're sent to. Explore and do events. There's a lot of unmarked locations to discover. Build &amp; rebuilding your camp and crafting stuff also gives XP. 
---
Taking Workshops gives some XP and quest rewards (including camp item plans) but it opens you up for PvP. If you don't like to PvP, you can drop the workshop ownership by hopping servers (leave the world &amp; it'll put you in another {usually} when you enter again). 
---
Don't worry about farming legendaries early, they will just be useless weigh taking up Stash space until you can use them. There are machines at the stations to trade in legendaries you don't want for Scrip currency. The Purveyor at Berkley station will give you a random legendary for Scrip.
---
Weight management partly depends on your play style, but keep health aids at about 30-50 of each (stims, rad away, rad X, purified water) and food. It's up to you if you want to carry mostly crafted food that can spoil or "preserved" food that doesn't. Try not to carry ammo that you're not currently using. Also, Missiles &amp; mini nukes are heavy, dangerous to yourself, and not very effective against enemies. The overseer cache in Morgantown Airport gives plans for a small backpack for a bit of carry weight boost. Bigger bags are earned w/ the Pioneer Scouts.
---
Scrap &amp; stash junk often, but keep an eye on what you're hording. Sell  or drop some of what you have too much of.
---
Exactly.  Meat week events were great for acid but this guys statements are "suspicious" to say the least.  Firstly you can not get 400 ore in lucky hole in 5 minutes. 300 in 20 minutes is closer to reality.  Also you don;t get lead scrap from lucky hole - you get "ore".
---
So I don;t have a high confidence level in that post.
---
the fireman helmet is the better match for the responder fireman outfit.
---
and the point being if a gas mask doesn't work it shouldn't remove the working one you already have on.
---
The *best* answer !
---
Daves not here man
---
Insult bot dies by my meat hook alot.
---
Passive perks too. I know they're bringing out a Loadout manager (even though the one on the nexus is perfect) I'd much rather not have to change out my damage buffs and shit to pick a lock or hack a terminal.
---
LOL I was eager to help this dude repair his camp that got destroyed by trolls the other day. Launch nukes, trade stuff, collect, explore, help people, fight greifers.
---
Well the real challenge is for the system to figure out your play style then try to award you an effect. Most of those effects can’t be mimicked no matter how you use your weapon. If i keep firing at tough enemies do i get furious? But people keep firing at it until it’s dead anyways. Then how do you mimic 1.25 shot, ghoul slayers, etc.
---
If you also use a stealthboy, it can work when they aren’t expecting it. If they are.... Likely Tesla’d into the ground. 
---
If I was able to, I’d use the Nuka Dark and Psychobuff to boost by endurance to 19 (And strength to 29, but damage cap), then go in with that. Might take them down, maybe. 
---
I’ve tried to PVP with melee, but as it is now, it’s just not viable.
---
Yeah I love Innov, and gamerMOM. Juicehead has some great vids as does Rifle, although he seems to have moved over to Borderlands 3 now. Hope he makes more vids when Wastelanders comes out. I'll have to look up Kevduit, thanks for the tip.
---
I have a mac and I play on xbox, plz help me &lt;3
---
I have carnivore mutation witch goes awsome with cannable. No need to cook eat as you kill.
---
Wow, thanks for the info and I will keep in mind all the things that you mentioned, also can you just inform me about the new DLC Wastelanders? Thanks again
---
The inventor and biggest sponsor of communism also owns the federal reserve, Wall Street, and prints the dollar, everyone is perfectly fine with it. What’s so wrong about displaying a Chinese flag.
---
Considering a regular bandanna functions as a gas mask i think the "toy" one should as well.
---
Thanks. Yeah, that will be for the people trying to transition into defending themselves to figure out, depending on their builds.
---
Best I would say is use stagger, armor ignore kinds of cards first before going into damage cards (tank killer, stabilized, one gun army, enforcer, whatever) and then put into damage by the individual cards first.  
---
My goal with the post was not to force players to change their entire builds and move all their points around to min\\max themselves, but to consider that their damage and defense may not be optimal but could possibly be adjusted on the fly without damaging their current builds.
---
Straight up just haggle. Hell if I'm at my camp and you buy enough, I'll give you some cool shit. Plans you may not have or whatever you need.
---
1. Intense Training, so we can have more specials.
---
2. A perk that turns all QOL and crafting perks passive
---
3. A perk that lowers perk cost, for example, it could reduce the cost of all weapon damage perks to 1.
---
4. A perk that doubles base carrying weight
---
5. Paralysing Palm
---
6. Ranger Takedown
---
7. A perk that reduces perk sharing requirements
---
8. A perk that turns you to a ghoul
---
9. A perk that turns you to a Super Mutant
---
10. A perk that prevents all addictions, diseases, poison, bleeding, and burning effects
---
Btw I think you'd only get 2 points because from what I remember you'd get 1 prestige point per 50 level AFTER level 50, so level 50 doesn't count.
---
LOL Nice and thats whats up.
---
I just tested this with my freind, because I was a little worried it could happen to me or anyone else for that matter. And it seems everyone is right my friend could not do anything with it when I would exit it normally or even while I was working on it at a power station. Only when I dropped it could he take it and remove pieces off the frame. So OP you had to have dropped it from your inventory.
---
If they don't choose sides but soon they'll be force to accept the outcome. Whichever ways, good luck to them.
---
And this is what I'm stating. Instead of it being for Queen, it can be for PVP... it should be thought of like this though, where cards can be swapped instead of simply stating 'this is too OP. I don't like this'  
---
Killing Scorched is easy. Killing smart players, not so much.
---
I only have one annoying bug left on my game: the enemies regenerating after I used a Tesla rifle; beside this one, the game is pretty bug free (except for some minor graphical bugs).
---
Maybe legendary is not the right term, it should be something in addition to the legendary effects.
---
Its an extremely valuable plan that only drops from a very difficult quest. I haven't been able to finish it myself with the one friend i have to play with
---
I found someone that was selling 5 Tenderizer for 1000 caps. Quickest purchase I've made in this game
---
Heck I'd be perfectly happy if every 50 levels we got to pick a special to increase by 1 across all current and future characters that existed outside the normal special limit.
---
Second choice...every 50 levels we get to pick one rank of a perk card that is always active when not equipped that effects all current and future characters. You can legendary rank up cards every 50 levels if you wanted to in order to passively have the higher ranks available.
---
Third choice....what we're most likely getting...a bunch of legendary perks with kinda off the wall abilities that may not be balanced well. It would be interesting of they brought in perks from the former games to be the legendary ones. Like the perception perk feom FO4 that lets you vat enemies through cover.
---
He was talking about the Firebreather one going with the Firebreather gear. I feel like you're arguing with the wrong guy lol
---
It takes **7,880** XP to get from level 99 to to 100. It takes **15,880** XP to get from 100 to 101. After level 1,000, it takes **159,880** to level up. That's where the XP curve flattens out.
---
So, at level 90, with 112 XP per kill, it takes 70 kills to level up. With double XP, that's only 35 could per level. Easily possible.
---
Source: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Level
---
If you're still skeptical, I'd be happy to pull the curve table straight from the current game files.
---
Same Answer
---
Young, wrong
---
Boy, wrong
---
Sad story lol
---
What do you mean one star cards? None of the cards have stars?
---
lmao i never considered the irony of fallout shelter 2 being china exclusive
---
but you do have a point and hopefully the wastelanders wont suck
---
Well wastelanders will pretty much change the map and its pretty plausible that they make something about Ohio, China or Space.
---
Coming this winter; all your holiday favorites voiced by Graham and special guest BFF Tabitha
---
Debatable which one is easier or harder to obtain.
---
The man mask? It also pairs well with the amusement park worker outfit
---
This would be a really nice addition
---
Well you're just obstinately obtuse.
---
On a side note; Beth make a camp snow machine--after all, we already have the mothman fogger
---
That would be insanely expensive. Christmas songs from the same era as most of the music featured in the game are still licensed at obscene prices because corporations use them to tickle nostalgia bones during holiday shopping. Bongo, Bongo, Bongo by the Andrews Sisters was probably dirt cheap because it's borderline politically incorrect, but their version of Jingle Bells with Bing Crosby would probably cost half a year's worth of content updates.
---
Easiest way would probably just be manually checking in the crafting sections what you have the opportunity to craft.
---
What system are you on? If xbox would you like to join a random encounter farming group for rare plan drops or rare vendors?
---
Ah, so it starts at Lvl 100? Do you recall where it say that by chance? Your 1-3 would all be awesome for just having more perks equipped, I would be suprised if at least 1 of those wasn't implemented.
---
Glowing ones are terrible It seems like they buffed them recently I’d bet on them against a death claw haha
---
Yeah, it's rotated for the time being. I say rotated but we don't know if there is a rotation, that's my word usage. I'm thinking because it's still in beta for now we won't be able to pick maps. Maybe later we will have the option, but they didn't want people to have a problem of finding a game. Which many people already have issues of finding full ones
---
This is most likely why they pushed back bot companions. Imagine seeing those not just in popular camp locations, but everywhere
---
Pick up everything, sell everything you can, explore every places, do every quest, join events to leech occasionally.
---
As for legendaries, wait after you get to level 50.
---
The damage cap was only for Survival...
---
I had the bloodied builds in mind when I built one. I have it at the front door of my home, but all of my workbenches and vendors are in a separate front part of my CAMP. The shower is always on, but you won't get fucked unless you actually walk through it.
---
Bethseda don't mention anything atm about fixing 250DR. They don't even acknowledge the problem anymore.
---
Months ago, they did and said they would pass it on to the devs etc.
---
So no new info on fixing it. ( not fixed now )
---
I think you are probably right on the third one. As much as I want to believe otherwise, I feel like for game balance we are going to see a lot of perks that most people skip and a few that everyone takes.
---
Edit to add: I'd accept just the 4 Rider skins yes. They are meant to be costumes of the 4 horsemen after all.
---
I was under the impression the plan only drops from a wolf in sheeps clothing. Just double checked the wiki too
---
I actually saw it on Reddit but with Bethesda releasing so little information anything could be possible.
---
Yeah, I could see them transferring over the swiss army perks from NW and calling it a day.
---
PC. Otherwise, yes, that’s exactly what I’m looking for.
---
That's great to hear.
---
That would be cool, but personally I'd prefer them not be prestige and just be basic perks.
---
Watching you empty out that minigun just to destroy a camp makes my caps tin cry.  Also I've worked out that it takes roughly 40 - 50 caps worth of ammo to take out a player with a Tesla and other guns cost more, never mind the the stealthboy / stimpak costs.  From an economic standpoint PVP looks to be a caps drain.  How are you getting so much mats to be able to afford this?
---
Nice, looks like I'm getting a preloaded debit card to get a 2nd copy of FO76 for cheap to run on my GF's xbox.
---
It’s crazy what is &amp; isn’t classified as a “gas mask”. So confusing
---
I don’t put much stock in players that dismiss things that are foreign to them, or are too stubborn to make changes that will improve their experience in combat. 
---
I think it’s totally fine to hoard and place value on weight reduction perks and gear if that’s what brings joy to someone’s gaming session, but it’s absurd for them to go online and complain that something is OP or too hard when they’re not utilizing offensive/defensive perks to their full potential.
---
I’m more enthusiastic about PvE and cooperative play, and it’s still a little disheartening to see someone get annihilated by a pack of ghouls over and over in the golf club parking lot, when I know a simple three rank Blocker card and sucking down a radshield beforehand will make a significant difference towards their success.
---
Well if you see me crouched over like a 80 year old grandpa shooting big guns mind your business iykyk haha!
---
I was trying to mule that plan over to my other character. Can I have it back please? 🤥
---
We are 24 mil now, it's not over yet
---
We're making progress, 24 mil
---
They apply a multiplier for damage. This includes the critical hit portion of the damage. I recently discovered this while trying to test base weapon multiplier. So critical a head for double damage bypassed.
---
My advice / strategy then..
---
Instead of server hopping 50 times to get a rare encounter. Get 10 like minded individuals you can communicate well with. Individually server hop to different worlds. When one person finds a worth wild encounter (Halloween trick r treater, civilwar reenacter, responder vendor bot, ectect) they announce it to the group and log into that world.
---
Turns 50 server hops into 5...or less
---
They should fix that bug instead of adding something else to not work right lol
---
That doesn’t mean that an 11 year old SHOULD be drinking
---
Maybe a separate channel with some Bing Crosby and Nat King Cole.
---
Rank 3 gives 30% chance to cripple, and that's per pellet with a shotgun.
---
I don't run a shotgun build but I definitely use to stop tougher vlcreatures in their tracks to take my time head shotting them to death.
---
For sure, and if I was the parent I would take action. All I'm saying is it doesn't necessarily need to be dramatised.
---
Shotgun builds are pretty MVP at Queens. Gets her down because there's only damage drop off, the pellets still cripple. Who needs baited meat?
---
Great post, and that's coming from somebody who goes out of their way to avoid PvP. Because of that, I certainly can't disagree with any of the points you've made, and I appreciate the amount of effort you've put in to it.
---
It's too bad that "food build" has increasingly become a derogatory term, because I admire the planning, synergizing, etc. that PvP players put into their builds. I know I carry too much stuff, and I can't bring myself to swap cards every time I want to ___, but that doesn't make me a shitty player in general. I just stay out of workshops, keep pacifist on, and hope for the best. Sorry, that has nothing to do with your post in general, but it's something that bothers me.
---
In any case, thanks for your post, and I hope it helps people understand why they're getting their asses kicked (and should also stay out of PvP unless they're willing to change their playstyle).
---
I second this
---
Think I’m around 150, I’ve gotten every trophy except the one to get your character to level 25 lol.
---
I usually get on and go to some usual spots and kill enemies and sell the assault rifles or whatever I get from them then go to camps and look for stuff to buy.
---
I know plenty of people have build, I’m actually thinking of working on a new character and working on
---
a build. Find it amazing how you can have a character 1 shot the toughest enemies or solo SBQs
---
I have both a Decon shower and a radiation emitter at my camp. It’s nice to offer amenities for people of all shapes and sizes.
---
Scooping up gallons of filthy pond water is still my typical method of irradiation. I never really need to bloody myself back down at home.
---
The vast majority of visitors use the rad shower, but the players who use the emitter seem to appreciate it a lot more. I usually get a thumbs up, salute or heart from other likeminded ghouls if I’m home.
---
I’d just like an advanced power connectors 2 or something :)
---
I want more perk points so I can have a backup weapon set without having to go bare bones because all my points are for my primary build. 
---
Like give us an extra perk point for every 10 or 20 levels after 100.  These legendary perk points do not have to increase your special stats (so the stat balance is still there), but allow the stats to accept more perk cards.
---
For example, you are level 200 so you have 5 legendary perk points.  Your Agility is normally 5, but you slot all 5 of your legendary points into Agility, allowing you to slot 10 points of cards.    But your agility base is still 5 for syncronizing with stuff like Evasive.
---
This way it gives the high level legendary players the ability to slot more perk cards in their lesser used SPECIAL stats, but not increase the value of the stat itself
---
It sounds like you did enough reading to get to the end, so thank you!
---
Not everyone mey agree with what a child should or should not be doing. But in the united states the Law allows it as long as there gardiens allow it. And have fun down voteing the hell out of me. As it just shows you all cant comprehend facts tossed in ur face.
---
Unless something has changed, you’re guaranteed to get the shower plan after completing the main quest line, launching a nuke on Fissure Prime and completing Scorched Earth.
---
Have you seen the buffs food / Nuka Cola / booze gives?  With Cola Nut and Party Boy you can get some ridiculous buffs even getting above 500 hp with regeneration.  Plus no stimpak animation with Nuka Colas.  Looks like actual Food Builds are viable lol.
---
Interesting, time to collect and scrap these then, I saw another poster saying the death claw was not learnable at the moment, I wonder if maybe scraping the mod will learn it? I have a few so I’ll test it out, won’t be too bummed if it’s not the case 👍🏽
---
Really?
---
I just want some torn, faded wallpaper. My immersion doesn’t believe in all this shiny brand new stuff.
---
Nice.
---
I thought PVP died with Survival.
---
But that wouldn't make any sense lore-wise and would be totally immersion breaking, every player character would have to have some sort of personal computer device on them at all times with some sort of augmented reality overlay system that cou- ohhhhhhh. Oh no. This should already be a thing.
---
anyone got like, a data mined list of all the stuff and how the event is going to go down so i can prepare for it and get the most of?
---
I’m around that level and I think I’m a noob. I got no builds or anything. How tough is the vault?
---
blizzard wants to know your location
---
I mentioned this in passing in OP but yeah I'm familiar with this.
---
That is beautiful. Idk why but I have to go all out to my house in game. Not fallout 3 but 76. 
---
I don't care about my house that much in 3. Mine is just at the end of a river in the Savage divide with an industrial sized water purifier because I can't hold on to pure water for a long time....
---
I can give leeway to some things, but I completely agree that we need the option to have each of them weathered as well.
---
It never really even lived with Survival tbh
---
Key with launchers is two shot. It still works like old TS. In that instead of 2 68% shots its actually 2 100% shots.
---
Like the other guy said everything in the game has a huge resist prob due to when they buffed queen and nerfed explosive legendary effect. They are both governed by the demo card sadly.
---
I would love to see demo go pre nerf and explosive just be a flat add on. It would make the guns complete with ffr again and allow real damage for launchers.
---
The bandanas work as gas masks? Really?
---
Someone hit the pot just a wee bit too hard me thinks lol.
---
coming soon to an atom shop near you. and yes i will pay for this feature
---
Super cool!
---
They’re testing to see what we’d swallow up, releasing all the shit stuff first and then the better stuff after
---
I definitely did
---
I can agree with this. I'm not stating everyone has to change their builds. I'm just showcasing WHY people who don't or are stacked like this would lose and how they could do something about it.
---
Um, the law in the United States prohibits the consumption of alchohol by anyone under the age of 21.
---
If you are party to a minor drinking, you go to jail.
---
There is no such law that allows minors under 21 to consume alchohol in any circumstance.  
---
Even our soldiers who can enlist at 18 cannot drink in the USA until they reach the legal age of consumption that is 21 (I know this from personal experience, I can die for my country, but not have a beer)
---
Okay, I get what you're saying. It would be cool to get an extra perk slot per prestige point. I want to say they mentioned that it was every 50 levels though.
---
So strange, I end up in lobbies with the same people every damn night I’m starting to think Bethesda is grouping us together like this on purpose
---
At this point, all mules are 30k caps. Its less for caps and more for the fun of engagement\content.
---
You mean the Mistress veil? That's not a toy. Its sophisticated tech. 
---
If you are talking about the toy fire helmet than no, it shouldn't just work. 
---
My kid has a couple helmets just like that. I'm not running into a smoke cloud with it. 
---
Because it's not a SCBA. It's a toy.
---
Yes. Both sets are at Watago train station in my current session
---
lets get this bread
---
Yea I mean I get passes are a better deal, I'm not saying the micros are great but in my experience non random chance micros are around 10 or more dollars.
---
Its probably not a good idea to brag about your parents breaking the law in a public forum. 
---
Big Brother is always watching.
---
My take is that the playerbase seemed to think Survival was Fallout Deathmatch. In reality, it should have just been harder to survive. Harsher Food/Hunger penalties, harsher deal penalties, and yes, player threats. I would have started a new character for a harder experience, but if I wanted deathmatch, I'd play something else more designed for it.
---
No, the active playerbase is just steadily dwindling down. That's why they removed survival: it wasn't to focus resources on Wastelanders. It was because you could log in and there would only be maybe 5 other people tops, and it was always the same 5 people. That let players know that there weren't as many other active players as they thought.
---
The only camp amenity that I can imagine using and investing in would be a device that cures diseases, fabricated disease cures/antibiotics, or grows blood leaf, snap tail and fire caps to make disease cures from.
---
Everything else is convenient enough to just visit elsewhere and conserve limited camp budget.
---
Ill take every 50 levels.
---
If by reading you mean not reading... Yes
---
No any plain ol Bandana works.
---

😂😂 that explains so much Floops Flooglies.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Look, I maybe jump on for three to five hours a week max.
---
I have never spent a penny on this game outside of the initial purchase. And I've made all sorts of atomic shop purchases. Including the dumb robot who thinks used toilet paper should be cherished. You just have to do events and stuff.
---
There was another thread posted today with the same issue. 
---
So this may be a new thing.
---
Yep no perception loss either.
---
the raider in me wants to be adversary and use plasma weapons, but my bloodied raider character needs a new bloodied weapon
---
I feel like anyone who trades on Reddit or fb knows how to price stuff in their vending machines, give or take a few caps. But players who only use the in game mechanics to trade are the ones who give us the best deals! 
---
Lucky you! Hope I can find a deal like that.
---
PS4
---
Not sure, it’s just strange because I’ve played NW since it released and everybody knows everybody at this point, even after the servers went worldwide lol
---
I'm always running around bloodied with a mix of bolstering and unyielding armor.
---
I've got the perk loadout manager mod for PC, so I can switch to a PvP build (perk cards wise at least) in about 2 seconds if I need to.
---
But should I even bother defending my workshops?  Best I have for a PvP weapon is a bloodied, faster fire rate gamma gun.  Other alternatives I have are a bloodied LMG and bloodied .50 cal MG.
---
I guess theoretically I could spam some radaway and stimpaks and unbloody myself before I do the workshop defense.
---
I've got like 28K caps I would spend on a non bloodied PvP weapon on account of having not much else to spend it on.
---
Ah, thanks! I'm a couple days behind on my thread reading, I should have checked before I posted!
---
Google his gamer tag, it should lead to one of his other social media profiles.  From there find his Facebook and you will be able to contact his parents/school.   If he doesn't have Facebook, reverse search some photos until you find one that his parents posted to a social network.

\#weallovershare
---
Scroll over to the Radio tab, click off of Rose’s Raider Radio. No more Rose.
---
Haha my perspective is you are debt free and have all you basic needs met, spending isn’t a ‘problem’ if you know what I mean
---
They should just make it possible to “level up” a max level card with an animated one you have. It should have been like that for the start
---
I got one of those bare cases. The bobble it comes with is random. Series one bobbles fit loose in the holder, where the newer series bobbles (like the one mine came with) are too large
---
More or less need to use DBl-sided tape or glue them down
---
Suggestion:  &lt;insert a suggestion that has been suggested a million times before&gt;

Lmao...I'll bet not 1 in 100 will get that reference! Sadly, I'm old enough to remember Cheech and Chong when they were new...😂
---
Ya, the server went world wide to eliminate the long queue times, and to try and diversify the player base. As the population dwindles though. It will be the same 50 or so people playing.
---
I'm pretty sure when companies list "active players" it's pretty loose. I know EAs definition is anyone that logs in once a week for an hour. I would say actual daily FO76 players might be 1,000-1,500 across all platforms. I know on PS4 I constantly just see the same names over and over.
---
They said there will be more maps and eventual rotation.
---
im getting sick and tired of the prejudice comments and downvotes given to raiders on this sub reddit
---
Yeah, Communism is an economy, Dictatorships are a government lol :(
---
I have toxic goo in my inventory at all times, I try not to use radaways and I keep a cow for its milk.
---
No need to launch it yourself, it's guaranteed every time you kill the Queen, if you have not yet learned the recipe!
---
I stand behind them while they play an instrument and allow the ghouls to rip them to death.
---
I think I’m basically echoing your points from a PvE perspective. There’s a lot of people that have legit trouble taking out a few strong AI enemies at once. I mean, my builds are fully optimized in terms of perks, and things have gotten hairy a few times when I get spotted by a pair of radscorpions in the middle of Scorched Earth. I’m in danger until every enemy is dead, so it gets tense.
---
Those are people joining the server. It shows you there as you load into the world.
---
Probably a display bug. That's the dead center of the map so sometimes things are incorrectly displayed there. Happens with events like Uranium Fever all the time. Either that or they have a camp under the map but if that were the case you should be able to see some evidence of it in the area.

1. This comment is 12 days old

2. I want her removed fromt he game
---
About 2-3 hours south east of Morgantown.  Come get me.
---
Turn of pacifist mode now in the settings.
---
Focus on leveling to 50 before doing quest lines. 
---
Save scrip until you are level 50+. 
---
Supermutants are probably the best thing to kill to level quickly.
---
Don’t sell normal (non-legendary) weapons/armor in your vendor. 
---
Sell extra ammo you have in your vendor for 1 cap each. 
---
Get mutation serums to use once you have starched genes 2 perk cards (level 32). 
---
Have fun!
---
I knew about them adding maps, like there's the Watoga map. Didn't know about rotation being mentioned. Thanks for that, I think there should be one for every township haha
---
When did the 250 dr while reloading thing happen? I have an AA black powder rifle with 250 while reloading that I use on lower level characters to level them up. Works fine for me regardless of situation, I even checked my armor numbers just to be sure. Between that and the full set of vangaurd armor, my lower guys can take hits from pretty much anything.
---
as much as I love bing crosby, I really hate his christmas music.
---
you get lots of Adventure Mode xp and Caps from playing NW as well, if all else fails
---
Also any tips on items for the aesthetic?
---

---
I'm level 205 and no noob either I'm also in the uk time zone and will be on tomorrow if you've got a mic I would be happy to tag along, PSN: Bloodied_Legacy
---
This is the best looking PA skin in the game to me.
---
Well that's why you'd have a cap and just have lvl ups past that count for caps or atoms
---
Since I loose my rads when the sun is up, my shower just sits there until someone powers it up and uses it.  As far as I've seen, I haven't seen it used once in the five months I've had it.  I put in a switch and don't have it in a passageway though, so people can use at their own convenience.
---
Lol i like that you said Ohio China or Space and not Ohio pennsylvania or virginia
---
I work in a shopping centre so hear Michael Buble, Mariah Carrey etc throughout xmas but I'd be down for a playlist of Crosby, Nat King Cole and that. The good thing about 50s xmas music is it sounds the same as the rest of it, whereas you can always tell when a more modern song is meant to be festive.
---
Cool, same. I haven't played in a couple months but if I get back on I'll look you up
---
Oh ok, thanks for the clarification.
---
The toy store one is actually part of the Pre-War Firefighter's Outfit set.  They just failed to add the outfit into the game as well even though it was in like every trailer leading up to release.
---
Entirely possible.
---
But unarmed weapons are already the meta?
---
Thanks for the info! Great idea
---
&gt;except maybe #4, and that is a bit political), 
---
Wait...why is that political?? I'm not trying to obtuse, I really don't get it...I fail to see the reason people feel the need to go on Reddit, go to a sub dedicated to the game and then proclaim they hate it and they're quitting. Exactly who has such low self worth that they need validation for quitting a game??
---
¡But pAy2PlAy!
---
It's actually a 0.15% chance :)
---
I am not the best but I've learned to do lots of events. They can get u caps, stimpacks, radaway, recipes, blueprints, and more. Also only carry what u need to survive
---
Stealth/vats crit Instigating Lever Action build is one of the strongest in the game.  It will 1-shot nearly every enemy in the game (up to a 3* level 68 Supermutant). It’s not optimal for long fights like the SBQ, but otherwise this is basically a “god” build. Full health, no addictions, and is basically walking death.
---
I was carrying goo for a while, but filthy ponds are everywhere and I don’t have to carry them in my inventory. Goo is much quicker, but I kinda like the fine touch of exactly 19% you can get with scooping up water. 
---
I use a diluted radaway when I start getting into the 10% health or less zone. That secondary heartbeat is usually my cue. A diluted radaway will put me around 25% health or so, and I’ll usually just crouch in a stream and top off food/drink until nerd rage kicks in. I try not to be too anal about it while questing around normally, because a bloodied hunting rifle will kill just about anything on the map with one shot even without nerd rage.
---
it be the dudes who patreon to a literal nobody twitch streamer youtuber who hate on the atom shop items. id patreon the fo76 dev team a dollar a month if it meant less bugs
---
I know this is an EXTREEEEEMELY long shot, any chance you’ve still got one to trade?
---
Instigating Lever Action is the best non-bloodied Rifleman build, and one of the most powerful and efficient  builds in the game.  Commando is stronger on long fights though.
---
The Responder Fireman Uniform is a different outfit, and has a matching white helmet. Both are *extremely* rare drops. The Fireman Helmet matches the set really well, though. I have a video that explains the differences here:
---
[Fallout 76 Apparel Comparison - Fire Breather Uniform, Fireman Helmet, Responder Fireman Uniform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2vthauLOVM)
---
Speaking of weird things I ran into a camp on the cliff above Whitesprings and it wasnt on the map. Even had vendors but no marker at all.
---
Check the fandom wiki, it has a list of quest stages, and the files for the rewards have not been added as of yet
---
Why do you have to be so negative? Why not say something productive like the guy you replied to? OP can run the raids himself, and then decide whether he thinks it's worth doing.
---
Also, with a decent build the raid doesn't take time, effort or resources. That one really is on you.
---
Oh I forgot about instigating! I had an ie Lever and it destroyed everything and u don’t need to be at high health. Great addition!
---
What little bit we know was all in the QuakeCon Fallout 76 panel. I think the official clip of it is in the Bethesda Softworks youtube channel. Should be out by the end of the year. They said November, but sometimes stuff gets pushed back.
---
Good luck with that. 👍🏻
---
Turn pacifist off or on?
---
On, sorry for the typo.
---
My camp is in a really high traffic area, so the shower has been left on about 75% of the time when I come home. Water conservation was clearly not an issue in Vault 76. 99.9% of the time every door in my house is left wide open. I’m glad I don’t have to pay for utilities, either.  I could build one of those pressure plate doors, I suppose.
---
Yeah... this is your own fault, buddy.
---
Does the Gamma Gun bypass the % reduction perks or the sentinel assasin effects?
---
Same.  Mine is right across the street from the Flatwoods Red Rocket, so I get a lot of LL players rolling through.  I have it there in case some of them might not have a lot of Radaway on them.
---
What are your thoughts about people complaining about explosive energy weapons and the tesla/sb? I know many of the top PvP guys hate the tesla and explosive energy weapons but wondered what your honest thought were on that.
---
I almost exclusively played survival and we always had fun fights over there until the farmers complained and everything got nerfed. I mostly play NW (joepescilaughing is my psn usually play with VeePapa) due to the survival nerf/demise.
---
The Bloodied LMG is good for PvP. Just do 60% health instead of full health. When I'm on my heavybuild that is what I use for the SBQ and PvP in between so I don't have to change alts constantly.
---
honestly intense training would be the best thing to add because it would allow for different weapon builds on one character. some raider themed perks would be cool, like bonus to stats when you are wanted, intimidating perks to add damage towards players. the home wrecked perk is like the most useless perk now so im hoping that PVP/raider gameplay will be in this games future
---
Super duper absolutely does work with ammosmith.  It pops all the time when I'm using it.  And my character has a 3 luck.
---
&gt; i was 5yo thats when my parrents got my lil brother and i started.
---
This explains the absolute terrible spelling and grammar, not to mention the severe lack of knowledge on alcohol consumption in the USA.
---
Had two server crashes during Scorched Earth last night. It was fun.
---
No problem, just checking
---
Just jumped on to do some cleaning 🤘
---
I know. I said Firebreathers. Literally everybody has it.
---
NICE! Amazing job!
---
Its sold at a toy store. Is there anywhere else to get it? I'm assuming it's a toy
---
Pick one weapon type to focus your build around. If you try to spread your perks among multiple times you will feel very underpowered and will probably get frustrated. Some people will tell you to only take the first rank of each weapon type damage perks (Commando, Expert Commando, Master Commando, for example), I would not recommend that. I used to think that too but you will definitely be better off taking all nine ranks for +60% damage, especially when it comes to the tanky late game enemies.
---
Sneak is crazy good and I would highly recommend it if you want to punch above your weight. You'll be able to easily dispatch max level super mutants at half their level which is excellent for xp and leveling up. If you try to take them on without sneak they will absolutely destroy you.
---
Try to limit yourself to one, maybe two, weight reduction perks at most. They're noob traps and will make you less effective in combat and would probably get frustrated again. Food and water is everywhere, you don't need to carry a ton of it on you.
---
Check out nukesdragons.com to plan your build so you don't waste levels willy nilly. But don't freak out if you make a mistake, you can make changes to your Special stats after level 50.
---
But mostly just have fun. Pretty much every weapon type is viable with the right build so pick whatever appeals to you and go to town.
---
My "trader" is a melee food build. Melee alows me to do "enough" damage, all those Qol cards with my excavator calibrated shocks or high cap backpack, if I see it I pick it up! Cool change of pace. Still learning the wisdom laid out here, but have to say PvP takes alot more thought to build a competitive build then pve, even endgame mastery.
---
Are you sure? 
---
I'll check it out, but that sounds like an oversight to me. 
---
Though for smoke alone, a bandana actually isn't that bad of protection if it is wet
---
I wouldn't know - I've only done the event a handful of times because my frame rate gets tanked by the dozens upon dozens upon dozens of meat piles.
---
If you unplug your vendors it takes the camp off the map.
---
Thanks for the advice.
---
I've been thinking of using guns that either use 5.56 or .45.
---
Can you just give me a few examples of weapons that use that type of ammo? Thanks
---
I'm saying is it doesn't double the new amount when ammo Smith is equipped. It will still double the amount of ammo crafted but only the base. So let's say you make some .45 rounds and have a base of 21 per craft. Ammo Smith will double it to 42 but super duper will still only craft 21 when it activates not what ammo Smith says.
---
It's one thing to be tired of hearing things like that (I know I am), but to start removing posts like that will look at lot like the mods are scrubbing any negative info about the game.  The optics on something like that are just a little iffy to really put into policy.
---
It's a bit like the ban on the trad e sub that can't be named...I understand the reasoning behind it, even if I don't agree with it, and it really looks pretty banal and political from the outside.  I'd argue that it is both personally, but hey I'm not in charge, so not my call.
---
All the helmets/hats that are sold at the toy store fit adults, and there's a small fire department on the grounds of The Whitespring.  I feel like you could argue he just got them from there.  Not to mention way weirder things have the same functionality as a gas mask.
