well said

Dude, Bethesda bans people for making their game better. They delay shit that actually might improve the game while wasting no time in pushing out new monetization methods.
---

---
Bethesda has jumped the shark. Time to jump ship.
---
or you know you could contact customer service to get an answer vs farming for internet points. but ya know to each their own.
---
Well. I see your point, but I think the analogy is a bit too extreme. Anyway! 
---
Bethesdas anti cheat is to be quite frank, 110% useless. Not difficult to get around at all. Now, I'm no hacker or anything fancy, heck, I can barely code, but! I know there's literally a way to ban other players characters in game by flagging them as cheaters. True, this uses a third party thing and is Not intended but, if their security is so bad so things like this can be found on accident by pretty much amateurs, there's some serious problems on their side. This only goes to show what a skilled person with I'll intent could actually accomplish. 
---
Now, I'm not supposed to find this, but there are seriously the security similar to security of a house without a security system or a lock. All their anti cheat really does is scan for certain "names" of programs on your pc. It will flag you as a cheater if it detects any programs with such names running. I think it also recalls corrupt characters or such but not sure. My point being, security is horrible. I might be wrong on some of this, because, as I said, I'm Not good at any of this, but! 
---
The massive security risks. If people report such bugs, maybe they should be banned, but they won't if they get banned. Suspend them and actually thank them for pointing it out at max. Give them an actual human written comment on the situation and give updates. Bethesdas customer support is the worst, and if the people is working with community managers, suspend them at most and actually talk to them. 
---
You have a valid point, but I'm guessing you won't but your money in the bank if said bank has open vaults where people can just walk in and take money, and only thing preventing them from is a sign that says "Taking money from vault is against the banks terms of service". The game needs security. If Bethesda can't provide it, we as a community need to. But if we get banned for reporting such stuff, no one wants to do it. Especially not with Bethesdas horrible costumer service. 
---
Anyway. Maybe not the fancy answer you want, but I think it's important info. This will likely receive some hate for what it is,but ey.ask me whatever if you have questions Cx
---
Bullshit
---
If they can, I am 100% in. I asked for a refund a week in once I realized “oh this isn’t rough, it’s an alpha”. 
---
BGS told me to eat shit. Would be great to return the favor.
---
r/murderedbywords
---
why? the dude is just trying to at least talk to somebody about his problems since the company he dedicated his time to has completely forsaken him. And it doesn't sound like he wants anyone's sympathy, he just wants others that help Bethesda with bugs and exploits to know they can be permanently banned if they test bugs and exploits whatsoever.
---
I just wish that the build limits were squares instead of circles.
---
If you have to use bugs to counter a playstyle, that immediately makes you a trash pvper.
---
Your account was problably hijacked

For pvp first aid is good if you run with the healing mutation and even if you do not, however, this is more so for pvp and not pve. In Pvp it will be more useful when combined with Field Surgeon. The reason for this is because of the strange way these two cards work together. Field Surgeon will not give faster healing for the added % that first aid offers instead, it will burst heal for a normal Stim Pack worth of healing and then do a normal steady healing for the additional 45%. This comes in handy with pvp builds, as the burst healing will replace sudden drops of hp when combined with auto stem armor, revive armor, and Born survivor while the additional healing will steadily tick hp up along with Healing factor (provided you can get to an optimal range or break combat for healing factor to burst heal you even more.) 
---
In pve the added healing is only good if you are dealing with poison or have a limited supply of stimpacks. 
---
Additionally, Superstim packs become over powered heals for sudden drops in hp for yourself in both pvp and pve.
---
^
---
Things that are not going to happen.
---
You're allowed to like what you like. Nobody's saying that. The whole point I'm making is that Bethesda has made their prerogative very clear and it seems like some people are kind of in denial about it.
---
I find it very useful in pvp combined with born survivor and field surgeon
---
It's Fallout. Power Armor or bust.
---
Currently using a two shot 10% weight and stacking damage minigun #reks with the heavy gunner and heavy weapon perks but havent min maxed to be completely op yet. Switched over from a rifleman build because it just wasn't cutting it for me
---
I replied to the ticket, and haven't received any sort of answer. This is my first post anywhere about it, so I'm not trying to farm for any sort of internet points.
---
I see, That makes me fear a bit I wont be able to do it with my current character. (swift/stealth build) I might be wrong but it really feels like the vaults were designed with only power armor tank builds in mind.
---
Yeah, it just takes longer
---
no hes not a hero, no shit. He doesn't put out fires, he doesn't arrest criminals, he doesn't drive an ambulance, what he does is take his free time to help fix a fully launched game that is ruined by people that will never see a single warning, and for doing that he has been removed from bethesda's game with no response, no apologies, no explanation whatsoever or anything.   
---
It reminds me of my friends mother who was paralyzed for life from the waist down by the special needs child that she was looking after. Sure its terrible that it happened but the blame is hard to direct at either parties.
---
Usually doesn't but it absolutely affects this one.
---
I hadn't received any sort of notice prior to the suspension from bethesda since I first set up my account and purchased the game.
---
Blatant copy/paste of my answer but thank you for the input as well. 
---
That makes me fear a bit I wont be able to do it with my current character. (swift/stealth build) I might be wrong but it really feels like the vaults were designed with only power armor tank builds in mind.

[removed]
---
Yeah dude it's a real bummer. I suggested they just auto give you the legendary item after the kill like during events. But someone was bitching about not wanting extra weight if that happens.... you mean you can't save 15lbs for a Lego incase it's a fucking ffr explosive handmade?
---
Commando is the way to go with that weapon. If you’re normally bloodied, then it’ll be more of a backup weapon, but if you try it you’ll see it’ll get the job done just fine.
---
And did you find something anything strange during your time playing, like someone dropping legacy weapons, or an exploit allowing you to dupe items (for exemple) ? Also, did you mess with your game files (With installing mods, or even doing anything on your PC that could alterate your game files) ? 
---
Also, when did you recieve the suspension message ?
---
Hell yeah, go nuts! :)
---
Let's take the wasteland with our armada of ships!
---
Sounds like server lag. Was there perhaps some big public event going on while you did this? Or maybe the server was just on its last legs anyway...
---
The workaround is to server hop until you find a better server.
---
That reminds of the ‘Chronus eating his son’ painting
---
No! 3 less people to kill. Bwahahaha whiny brat.
---
Noticed this too as well. I think because the game classifies those crops as building material? It won't take those specifically, so not sure how it got put in there, only click triangle to scrap all and store anyway. But it sent a Tarberry in mine, razorgrain, tato, got no idea how it happens or what causes it. Guess I could mess around with it a little and test it... Anyway guess we finally got our fridges :(
---
I mean, when Bethesda display's a predictable pattern of behavior, *predicting* that people will predict it isn't exactly rocket surgery.
---
But I'm betting Maid4'76 still feels nice and warm inside for being able to be so clever.  
---
That was a kind thing you did, Undefined.  That was nice of you.
---
If a doctor gave you syphilis, it would be a great idea never to see them again.
---
Bethesda doesn't owe you anything either. You're not their employee, you're just another player. Player who went digging in their gamefiles with 3rd party software for hours on end (or an entire day) and then went to bed leaving it unreported and the next day left it unreported as well.
---
I fail to see how in any way they could've distinguished you from a malevolent person digging up in the files. You had as little permission to do so as any other player. You're kinda anthropomorphizing their general customer support in all the talk about how you're disappointed how they didn't reply to you because it's you, the great helper they should recognize in your opinion (ignoring the fact that customer support for companies this big almost always suck, either giving players cookiecutter copy paste replies or nothing at all. Cases go unsolved all the time. Or get "solved" and closed after some nonsensical boiler plate reply.)   
---
Or how they "didn't appreciate all you've done for them". There just isn't any no one person or a group of few people who could have come to know you behind those systems, it's just the system that flags you based on actions done in the game. Actions that you did and are something they're trying to crack on. Actions players shouldn't do.
---
Though sure, if I drop the entirely objective talk; *I* personally tip my hat to your findings and work, your community tools, as well as your good intentions in fixing the game. *I* understand it. I applaud it.  
---
But with reason, it looks you're not without your feelings of entitlement when thinking you should've had exceptional treatment from their support.   
---
(Though I suppose you'll clarify that you'd want them to treat everyone that way... but that's unrealistic and I think it would be evident if they shared the data about how many support tickets they get per hour or day. Not to mention the amount of people writing them after being banned how they "didn't do anything" or were just trying to find exploits or \[insert a thousand different excuses here\]. Likely your one sincere reason got lost among a mountain of pleading innocence and demands for an unban.)   
---
It is true they don't "want" your community tools. They don't "need" them. They don't "dislike" them or "hate" them either. People have wants, Bethesda does not. Bethesda is a company. It doesn't have a good or bad impression of you. (Even if their community managers might bullshit people into thinking they're a living feeling entity as a company, they are not. No company is. Companies have policies, not feelings.)  
---
You aren't a part of Bethesda in any way and your tools aren't a part of the game and that is the extent of Bethesda's responsibility.   
---
With that said, it was always the community that loved your tools, not the company consisting of a thousand moving parts, none of whose opinion is the consensus of "Bethesda's opinion"   
---
Like you said; "Bethesda might not find your contribution to their game nearly as important as the community does.". Exactly.
---
If you wish to work on the game, you should either:   
---
a) Try to get employed by Bethesda, as only then you could get recognition of your expertise from them and could truely affect the game and it's future.  
---
Then you would have all the reason to be upset if the company treated you poorly.  
---
(Now all you have to do is wonder if they treated you according to their terms of service.)
---
b) Do it for the community (Especially if your only motivation for dropping it is to teach Bethesda a lesson of loss or .. how invaluable you were to the community.)  
---
Using this as some sort of a power move to "hit them back" will not affect Bethesda. There's no one entity at Bethesda who will hear your displeasure and feel like you've given them their due revenge. That is why the douchey reply to you from earlier; It's more of a kick in the teeth for whatever community is still left, than a lesson for the cold dead emotionless corporates up Bethesdas ladder. Sure, it angers people against Bethesda further. But that's it. The feelings it causes are felt by PEOPLE, not "Bethesda".
---
Or quit **because you feel like it.** You won't owe anyone even an explanation or a reply, interview or a statement, lesson to be learned - anything. If you don't wanna, you don't wanna. 
---
What does amaze me though is how you're in communication with their Community Managers and they have absolutely no power at all to get you unbanned if and when they welcome the voluntary work?  
---
Would've thought they could at least ask for someone to be unbanned when they know something's been done for the benefit of the game... assuming you communicated this to them when doing it and/or shortly after.
---
Well if they got through then wouldn't they technically have been ready, regardless of time?
---
Mine was free🤷‍♂️
---
Oh, there was a nuke at whitespring.
---
That makes sense. Thx
---
You're not investing in the games development lmao? Is that a joke? You're investing in all the money Zenimax is busy trying to pay back it's investors?? 
---
Why are people so uninformed or naive to seriously think that all the money they spend on a game goes towards it???
---
there was a couple of instances earlier this fall when some guy got his characters deleted and he shared all the support messages here on reddit. It took a while, but they eventually rolled back the entire account to the last save he had before they got his account. He had come back after a time and found all his characters deleted.
---
Stuff your sour shit in a sack bro. Fuck the atom store and fuck the bugs. Can you spell, ASSume?
---
There is no harm, but what does farming in a HS have to do with it?
---
I got a raider flag!
---
If I log out in the nuke zone most enemies don't respawn
---
I didn't interact with any other players during the time I played, never crafted anything, just went around checking locations. I didn't do anything to any game files or try to install any mods.
---
I received the suspension message on November 13th, Wednesday.
---
That explains the 2500 I saw in a dudes vending machine lol.
---
If you call "trying" doing everything possible to put their grubby little hands in your wallet and pull out your cash then yeah they're trying really hard lmao.
---
I agree that a CAMP should absolutely overrule a TENT, and that I don't really understand why the TENT has such an enormous radius to begin with.
---
It costs nothing to move the TENT somewhere, and most CAMPs will have the functionality of a TENT anyway.
---
Your time is much better spent getting caps and buying the mutations you want.
---
I'm getting bashing single action revolvers, troubleshooting pool cues and mutants leather legs, so basically same for me as it's always been. Everybody talking about getting bloodied this and TSE that and I'm over here sitting on 8 hunters pipe pistols.
---
They're not private servers. They're just private instances. 
---
The game was also marketed as being totally playable and enjoyable solo.
---
Just, walk it off bro. Omg. 🤦‍♂️
---
Most people did.
---
I think if you scrap food at your camp it goes in the scrap box.
---
Has anyone else seen the dog by harpers ferry! That is not infected. Im a lv 107 and its the first dog i have seen that is not infected. Its protecting 2 dead bodies...
---
Railway rifle was in fallout 3 and returned in 4 so I don't think it was railroad only to begin with.
---
People liking garbage is okay. 
---
People liking garbage which then gives the company the idea they can keep making garbage and heavily monetize it and sheep will eat it right up and therefore ruins games for everyone is not okay.
---
I’m typically armor less. So having the chameleon mutation is helpful to me.
---
Only thing is, the guy who reports the method of "robbing" said bank gets life.  
---
The people robbing banks before and after them get slaps on the wrist. (NW hackers)  
---
Bethesda needs better community and player interactions, to have trusted members in the community they can rely on to fix their games for them.
---
Many software companies give you money if you can find and report a vulnerability with "cheat apps" or without them, because they are thankful you report them instead of using it to hurt them financially or otherwise. There is a code of ethics, you shouldn't exploit the vulnerability other than to demonstrate it exists and you shouldn't sell it to others. Map guy here mostly followed that, didn't give himself advantages or made the game worse for others. There was no harm done to Bethesda or other players. Yet he was banned and Bethesda's incompetence in actually correctly determining who is a white hat and black hat hacker or their TOS are reason enough to conclude they don't deserve blame?
---
Well, I have a hard time understanding this point of view.
---
Thanks for contributing to the continued decline of the "AAA" industry what a jerk jeez.
---
What is, "Legendary Weapons" for 500 Alex
---
Uninstall the game and reinstall ...rebuild data base if ps4
---
But the trees! So many trees!
---
Good for you?
---
Well idk man. I have hopped hundreds of times from directly in front of the golf club and it respawns them every time. 
---
And I see I get downvoted every time I say something about this. There has not been a single instance, after the entire area is cleared of hostiles (like, *all of them*), that loading back in, in the blast zone, doesn’t respawn them. 
---
You and everyone else wants to summon the whole crowd when you keep leaving stragglers behind lol. 
---
But if you *actually* played the game *enough*, you would know this...
---
That'll take forever with my internet connection but I am on ps4 so I guess I'll give that a try if I can't come up with another idea
---
Bethesda IS almost just as bad as EA and Activision and the like? And 76 IS a perfect example of whats wrong with "AAA" gaming??
---
so not everyone paid for the game. People who continue to pay for the game are the real winners. If you’re not 1st you’re last.
---
Yeah, it's awesome. Sometimes, if I missed one, he's walking right past me while I loot his buddies, screaming something stupid like "A NOICE!" And i mean the part of the perk where you can become hidden again when found, if you stand and crouch again.
---
Thanks for contributing to the decline of their games and the "AAA" industry you're extremely selfish jesus. 
---
It's so sad people settle for the bare minimum and don't have enough self respect to want something to be better, especially something they claim to love.
---
 At least yours landed my game crashed as son as it touched the ground
---
Will have to check stable flux
---
Yes I know that but that's not how it works in private worlds. You launch a nuke and everything is dead. If you are in the nuke zone and log out they will still be dead, you need to go out of the nuke zone to log out so they respawn.
---
Can you provide any proof to backup your claim that people have lied about the games issues?
---
Do you realize the game has been out a year?
---
Excellent work by Claudia Christian.
---
Map76.
---
true, sorry about that. Was uncalled for. Will make sure to maintain a moral compass next time.
---
Your nuke killed everything there. As others have suggested, log out and back in to your private server. Or have a friend join your server and go there to spawn more enemies.
---
So you fuckers have infiltrated reddit from twitter too.
---
Why are you typically armorless?
---
No because there are no consequences to death in this game
---
I like cheese
---
But you should be trying other games is all I'm saying. There is so many things that others do better, and so few good things about fall out 76.
---
Sucks to be you then lol. It just works... for me.
---
We're all Americans.  We came out of a vault in the US.  There are no other nationalities in the game.
---
Well you are lucky to be the only person who can do that
---
If you're on pc I'll give you whatever weapon you want for it assuming it's max level and such
---
I don’t have Twitter, so I don’t know what you’re talking about.
---
Yup i've had it since the Beta. But I also have a job and its not the only game I play.
---
25.. You can stack them too. Drop them all. Milk another one at 100%, pick up the stack and they'll be 100 condition again.
---
So you're arguing that those who didn't pay for the game suck, and those that do and continue to do so don't?
---
Any you didn't initially pay for the game.
---
Hmmm...
---
This, I can confirm that. You have to plant crops, then scrap those, and they land in your scrapbox. And also correct, they don't spoil. I put in 20 corn and razorgrain in there to be able to brew enough beer for the daily challenge whenever it comes up.
---
Also, and I think nobody has mentioned this before, I have 5 units of purified water in my scrapbox, apparently from when I scrapped my water purifiers...
---
Same
---
I noticed they don't stay if you decline or log off
---
I would laugh at you but people who don't throw money at Todd are sane enough to know that it's impolite to laugh at the mentally challenged.
---
Or maybe use the scrips and donate those like 10 scrips per , 0.00000005% of progress and watch west Virginia rebuild slowly over time
---
dosent happen with fo1st
---
Yeah shadows only move when I move for some reason
---
I have no issue with bush hiding. Just if your neat to a teammate and say a stray grenade or what ever gets them and it's clear to revive them. Feel like if your in a team you should. Plus its free xp
---
That might be inviting some unwanted griefing. I only bring it up because I distinctly remember some savage hostility toward Brazillians back when I was playing Battlefield 3 and 4. 
---
Anyone with a Brazillian dog tag or BR anywhere in their name was the target of unwarranted teamkilling and other forms of grief.
---
You need at least 3 people for the pylons you can only hold 2 for a hamd ful of seconds. Hope this helps
---
I don't think you're supposed to solo it, get some friends that know what they're doing
---
Same thing happened to me. I found that if you wait awhile they will spawn. Travel somewhere else for a while, ten minutes or so, then come back.
---
I'm sorry, you mean the only country flag, cause they have that one :)
---
You shouldn't have been cheating to begin with, and  you're dragging this out to make money off what little popularity you did have at the expense of the game. Stop it.
---
I'd like a way to store (or even drop) perk cards. I have many of them repeated (cause bad luck in the card packages). It make a muddle while I'm changing perks.
---
This is why I left this subreddit. Nothing but people complaining about the atom shop. The game itself or what they want in they personally want in the game and it’s fucking annoying seeing people bitch about it. If you don’t like it. Stop fucking playing
---
Absolutely if the coast is clear!
---
That's what testing is. Why report something if it's just one in a million thing? I know Bethesda isn't sure what testing is but repetition when you think you found something is pretty key to replicate it.
---
Did you have on dodgy, blocker, suppressor, and born survivor perks? And serendipity. Also try power armor with kinetic dynamo which works nicely with dodgy. And if you vats, have on grim reaper sprint to get those action points back up. Make sure to be well fed and hydrated, and play that tuba or other instrument for faster ap regen too
---
Level 250 is not really that high. I've seen people over level 700 in adventure and over 200 in nuclear winter.
---
Eventually they'll have to drop the old Xbox and PS4. 343i is hitting the memory ceiling on the OG X1 with Reach. I give it 2 years for Xbox, and 3 for Playstation.
---
Expect for the fact that people ARE being banned for this and burying your head in the sand about it won't change that.
---
Comon Bathesda, you (were) better than this.
---
I've done it myself several times holding all three pylons. Junkies build, used born survivor field surgeon level 3 first aid and an autostim chest piece using superstims only.
---
But obviously its easier in a group where the pylons are shared
---
I mean with his interactions, I know the score, grey hat here loool. If I had been the one investigating I would have messaged them first then started the investigation. Not that Beth is in the right here, I think their behaviour over recent months has been despicable. Totally screwed their previously avid community
---
I look at it the same way. 
---
I picked up the game on a whim after not playing a fallout game since 3 with all the DLC. Just never got around to New Vegas or 4. Wasn't playing at all at the time.
---
I can plainly see how much of a money grab it is for them. They think it's printing them money. But even if it is, it will probably be short lived. And what that revenue if funding? I have no idea. Hopefully something big and redeeming by the devs, but I can only hope.
---
That's why I don't buy in to the playing experience. I picked up the game on a whim, and with that I play pretty casually. I don't like the direction the game took, but I stay away from purchases and subscriptions.
---
Classic Bethesda.  Turns a classically solo game into a mmo, makes all the end game activities group based despite knowing most people play solo.
---
It's such a damn shame too. Everyone here loves this game, they are passionate, loyal, fans who want this game to be the best it can be. This company has pull more shit in the last year than most do in their lifetimes. It pisses me off to see so much goodwill and loyalty just get spit on. Many companies would kill for a playerbase like this, and Bethesda never passes up the opportunity to show nothing less than contempt, in return.
---
I'd love to see the cited source info on where the $$ is going. If there's something reputable out there saying they reinvest the money into further development.
---
If the Wastelanders update is anything like the latest godforsaken update.
---
Then RIP Fallout 76.
---
&gt;go live in your   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;settlement  
---
&gt; C.A.M.P. if you saved them.
---
Make them move to a different location? I do not expect that kind of alteration to the gameworld from this team. That would actually be cool, so I have no doubt that it won't be in the game.
---
Cut back a few chunks and release it later as DLC. Quicker release, more $$. Seems obvious, sadly. Monitized and modular.
---
Dude, a single modder made Falskaar for Skyrim. An entire continent of content, and Bethesda even passed on hiring the guy, who was later picked up by Bungie.
---
16 times the detail.
---
Id ditch makeshift and take dodgy.  Also id max blocker and incisor at the cost of some slugger ranks.
---
Level 5 legendaries   lol
---
It just works.
---
Lol
---
Your account was stolen.  Better get on that asap.
---
Oh sweet dude! Thanks!
---
Serendipity doesn't work in pa and this is a pa build.
---
Except Canada.  We want to be annexed!   FOToronto  haha
---
I had enough fun with thistles, thank you very much.
---
Check out my two different builds and two different approaches to imposter one is duo but i hold 3 pylons, second one is totally solo.
---
https://youtu.be/AZEoffL4wDw

https://youtu.be/F9OmHxl-hEs
---
Yes  haha
---
Multiple small camps would be cool.
---
Up vote if you agree? Lmao are you 12?
---
they do excel at creating really cute scenes with teddy bears though. there is one where they're all set up like they making a movie. funny as heck.
---
Ok thanks I wasted 56 caps
---
Is it really a mystery why you’re getting downvoted?
---
If you actually posted to the subreddit enough you would know this
---
Deal
---
I nuked Morgantown out of pressure when completing my first silo run.
---
Same here. I rock white hair and a combover for this very reason.
---
a good run for me is 15 minutes but that's only if I don't stop to loot. which means its about 30 minutes usually.
---
also a big time save is having the mainframe cores repaired and prepped already. I don't do that because then it cuts into my circuit junk profit.
---
Well congratulations are in order huzzah !
---
Oh my god...this is true -_-
---
When you equip the hazmat you unequip your armor.
---
At least that game JUST WORKED..........still looks better graphically and has better gameplay  than 76 too imo.
---
It doesn't seem to work for at least ferns. I'm not sure if any of the others don't work but I edited my original reply on some I tested and know work. I have a video showing the challenge working for both bloodleaf and thistle and also it not working for the ferns.
---
I made myself a throne with the junk I got by raiding people's workshops.
---
I have kept all power plants fully repaired during 70% of my playtime. been playing since beta probably 1500 hours of free electricity that I have been providing to surrounding workshops. that they never use /facepalm. for example I repaired posiden. and I saw a level 40 take sunshine. I thought yeah that guy gets it he has free power so he can fire the food maker right up and save mats. and I went over after awhile and he had built all the generators to power the food machine.
---
This. Ill wait as long as I half to for food to be cooked. Granted I would like to have it done when it was delivered but I would rather not rush it if the cooks are trying to cook it and need more time.
---
I disagree. I'd take 76 over that abomination any day.
---
I don't think the 'shilling' is as big of an influence as you think it is. Some people can enjoy the game despite its flaws. Not wanting to see contrary opinions is a narrow minded approach.
---
I cant deny this is the best reply for the game. Good one!
---
I do all three and still kill it easily. I have an insanely high DR and ER so Damage is next to nill even with the extreme blast. That and a Vampires Explosive with armor to stim as necessary make me invincible. It’s just who can whittle the other down first. Of course only one of us can heal more than once
---
Darn bush chickens
---
personally I am pissed that the 10% taxes we pay on all sales to the faction robots has produced 0 results. infrastructure is still down roads look like poo water still sucks.
---
I mean that’s not exactly classic but the other part isn’t quite untrue
---
I stopped playing the day of FOF release.  Keep waiting for the "sorry, we blew it" post.  Isn't coming.  Oh well.  Honestly, All they had to do to make me happy was give the stash box to all players.  More than half of my playtime was figuring out what to throw away to manage my weight.  I LOVED playing the game, right up till I couldnt walk or fast travel.  It really would have been that simple, but I refuse to pay a monthly sub to be able to actually play the game without moving in slowmo...
---
This probably.   
---
I'd say just toss it on the rest of the pile labeled "stuff they lied about before launch" sadly.
---
Or they could have a tiered priority system with a separate monthly fee.  $5/mo is bronze, $10/mo silver, $20/mo gold.  Priority player replaces current occupants camp/tent and a pile of boxes is placed just outside the area containing all the "lower class" player's items.  Could have some all caps red sharpie writing on the boxes too like "hope she was worth it" or something (you know, like you're getting kicked to the curb).
---
If two players of the same level are in the same spot it starts an immediate bidding war.  Players are made immune during this time and brought to their bank's website so they can keep an eye on their funds during the bidding process.  After 3 minutes the person who big the most of the spot wins, but both players still pay what they bid because Bethesda needs to pay for the bidding servers somehow and the winnings alone won't cover it.
---
That brings me to the next somewhat related idea.  You could pay $7 a month for "disconnect insurance" which gives you a 50% chance of returning you to the last server you were on after a disconnect.  Maximum of twice a day because storing all that data costs money.  But if that wasn't enough you also get A FREE PLAYER ICON!
---
Except he was authorised by the CMs. So, to use your analogy, it would be like the Police Department informing you that it is fine to step in.
---
I’m not heading out of town again until February, so savor this double XP! And thank you for the silver!
---
It’s not like atoms are expensive. Any kid with an allowance can buy thousands of atoms. But why do it when the game is constantly giving them to you, 40 at a time.
---
&gt; Would you like your costumers try to lockpick it "
---
I would if I asked them to. As the CMs did.
---
I got 1 too from queen last night. ;)
---
Just had that happen at Whitesprings. Was being chased by 8 bloated glowing ghouls, one a level 3 legendary, after I killed them all the legendary disappeared and the rest remained. What a rip-off.
---
Absolutely right especially to those who took over your workshop
---
I think you've missed the point of this post.
---
Holy moly, you just described my experience at venture to a Tee! I'm trying to earn the backpack on my second character and it took abt 7 tries to finish the cursed Venture course...and then it awarded me the rewards 2x 2 min apart, but didn't register on the Character or wherever category they hide in...but then they did register..and basically I swore at my TV. A LOT! And eff Bethesda....
---
Oh really? Then explain to me how people who tried to help get permanent Ban while Cheaters/Hackers get 72 hours suspension and are still doing it despite being reported by gamers? Bethesda doesn’t care.
---
Many huzzah!!!
---
So... what?  We're not allowed to have group-oriented events in a multiplayer game?
---
Battling online propaganda... oh you mean the game? I made a Bistro and cook the scorchbeasts. It's a scorchbisrto
---
I didn't think the Auto-Stim effect used Super Stimpacks?  I thought it was super literal - ordinary Stimpacks only.
---
You need to put points in agility, sneak, stealth, covert ops. Even with an instigating or anti-armor rifle, your damage will come from being hidden and taking advantage from those multipliers. A rifle might say '120' damage on your Pipboy but hit for 1200.
---
Most of us are selling at 300-400 caps max
---
I stopped supporting greedy tone deaf companies by cutting off my wallet and playing time.
---
Everyone trying to perform a citizens arrest out here.  LOL
---
Like literally what do you guys expect. People keep expecting certain things from this game and then come on the Reddit and get all surprised that it's screwing them over. What do you expect from this game? It's a piece of crap it's always going to screw you over.  Either you're going to play it and deal with those things or walk away from the game like many people. I don't understand where the surprise comes in?
---
I have zero pity for people when they know exactly what they're going to get from this game.
---
Actually, I think you missed the point of my comment.
---
I had 27 pumpkins in there after scrapping my Halloween decorations.
---
you do realize the program they are using is called "cheat engine" its not something that he made, its free to download and use by anyone for any game that runs on PC.  Its main function it to display/read/write memory addresses.  Its a great too to see what a game is doing at a deeper level.   They where using this to examine bugs.
---
Oh ok..i was wondering how i got my pumpkins..
---
What propaganda?
---
I purify bog water, and make inappropriate theatre out of whitesprings busts.  It's honest work.
---
Dude, let's be honest. You don't want people to discuss this with, you want people to validate your opinion.
---
Look at your responses. It's clear as day.
---
If you want to have an actual discussion, let me know.
---
I guess they should have made sure the game was good before dropping it😅 I don’t know I’m just waiting for wastelanders.
---
Gunslinger. A good revolver, gun fun and headshots for everyone.
---
do you have an exact location? i would love to check it out
---
At lvl 423 I use a bloodied swing speed combat knife and no armour at all... just a knife and my underwear. Lots of stealth perks... I die a fair bit but it adds a bit of interest.
---
You never know lol could happen to bethesda as well if they keep fucking up this bad. I can see a future where they have to sell the elder scrolls and fallout franchises.
---
Yet still bother to browse and respond on the subreddit.
---
Nah you should admit defeat here bro
---
You're welcome man. I saw reviews saying it was bad and some saying it was decent. So far, it's pretty funny and good. The control is weird, even on the default low x and y settings it feels too sensitive to look around.
---
Not at all, but it would be stupidly OP if it worked that way.
---
Good old fallout
---
Havent gotten a single plan from turning in tech data.  Maybe its just bad rng for me but the rewards have been something akin to ammo/rad x/ rad away/ stims
---
yeah its all about the rifle for you at this point man. shop hunt in your apprpriate difficulty level areas and chill till you will get a really good rifle eventually you'll be ok. I recommend having some spare levels to swap perks around for when you do find that really good gun so you can spec to it.
---
on my alt I ran a antiarmor sniper rifle for a bit and it was pretty darn good then I ran mutant and it seemed about the same over all. tried unyielding but it was gimmicky and unreliable. if you don't mind dying occasionally for no apparent reason its the best damage.  
---
lots of peeps recommend unyielding builds but I liked junkies way better. the damage was almost as good and when things went sideways I actually had health. for sniping junkies hand down is my favorite build type and for that you need to make sure you get hooked on the right drugs. you'll have to google the guide ( I cant remember where the listing is) 
---
at the end of the day I main a heavy gunner. the sniper is fun but things always end up mobbing you in big groups. its a lot of work compared to just blasting everything with my heavy gunner.
---
I haven't had one in a while but I believe you still do. Also sometime people sell them. I brought elder and another one once. Though people tend to want a lot for them. (I was lucky and got them at base price xD)
---
Yeah, play the game long enough until it starts to make sense!
---
you rock brotha
---
Defeat?... its Reddit...
---
I sell toilet paper.
---
Yes. I’ve been farming them recently. It took about 80 tries to get them all. I just need to get the BOS jumpsuit and I’m done with that quest forever!
---
That quest contributed to my deep hatred of the raider gangs. Between the Order and the Christmas Flood, I took a great deal of joy in killing David Thorpe during the raider quests.
---
&gt;It just works
---
Thanks Todd
---
Thanks!
---
Why are you booing him, he's right.
---
It uses super stims and regular stims. It will use regular stims first and if they are empty then will switch to using supers. For pvp and situations like this I put regular stims away
---
Initiate isn’t dropped anymore. So, 5 total now I think.
---
So true, when people go on strike in the real world it’s not like you see them hanging around their job site sharing messages about their displeasure with the company.
---
Easy. TS armor and super stims. Boom. Dead
---
Yes I finally got elder paint after 2200 hours and like 1000 tech data turn ins
---
If you can rather easily farm sb, I recommend just cook a lot of sb food what with carnivore mutation gives 400hp each works rather slowly and you can eat 10 at once for 4k healing over like 30 sec or something.
---
I'd rather see the enemies that are attacking me load in before I die.
---
If you shoot at them while they are flying they’re less likely to land ive noticed.
---
Because Bethesda.
---
Bos jumpsuit does not come from that quest it comes from savage divide quests and dailies
---
Yeah, I know. But a two-headed bear is so cool. And they made the Ranger Armor outfit available via Fallout 1st.
---
Built a small town with an inn, saloon, clinic, donut shop, garage and weapons shop so six buildings total... It was pretty legit
---
Hopefully he means the anti-f76 propaganda and he's not one of the poor souls who thinks there's pro-f76 propaganda
---
🦀🦀🦀 devs won't respond 🦀🦀🦀
---
🦀🦀🦀 $11🦀🦀🦀
---
Are you on PC? I feel like I’ve been there.
---
I made a small settlement near Grafton. Right now the only inhabitants are a cow, a robot, a toad, and I. We're still growing though.
---
I have two of the BOS paints in over 80 runs of Forbidden Knowledge. No Shielded BOS Underlayer plan yet. So pretty low drop rate, I guess.
---
Fast travel to Harper's Ferry, turn 180°, get to the top of the cliffs. There's a path way around and up on the right side at the end of the bridge.
---
I agree, this game is still not ready for release and should've been delayed since it still isn't even stable enough to actually play.
---
nah the point analgesic is making is its yet another complaint / trash talk post by someone who doesnt even play. what rational person would buy a game play it for 5 hours then go through the process of creating an account on a subreddit for a game he doesnt even play. no rational person would do that. the op is full of shit. just making drama.
---
PS4, but I post it to Reddit a lot. Got kinda popular for a little while. But now it's just four buildings and a little tent for rest because I switched to concrete foundations and that takes more budget for some reason. That's Conkreat baybey!
---
LARPers and those caught up in parroting them. Russians playing Americans dispersing fabricated opinions on our social media. https://i.imgur.com/4xKPNqS.jpg  
---
They manipulate and abuse sites like this one by using vast amounts of profiles to skew votes, push narratives and fake news, attempt to get subs banned.. shit like this https://i.imgur.com/oWLu8ar.jpg They talk about how there should be a civil war/race war any day now.. lot of terrible shit. Trying to get us to turn on each other.
---
bullshit
---
I don’t think there is propaganda on any side.
---
Hmmm. I’ve done it several times on a private server with no issues.
---
Good to know.  I don’t feel like I do a lot in the savage divide.  Need to focus there more. Thanks
---
Wait, really? Any reviews to get a general idea? I was thinking of buying it.
---
There are better ways of going for it if you want a 3 star item. The queen is just for fun, players getting together and shit like that. You get some ultracite, some flux, some plans. 
---
In my opinion, the queen should drop a shitton of ultracite (really irradiated creature), acid, nuclear waste, bones, meat. Hardened mass, glowing shit.
---
Chinese people: 😓
---
yeah I agree with all the other posters who are saying to just go buy the damn things. your're spend a dollars worth of time to save a dime. average price is about 400 but I have seen them as low as 180
---
What are you on? I was able to 2 man it with a level 40 on xbox, I DPS'd the shit out of it and mutated it within the first minute of the event, then killed it in the next 2 dps phases
---
I never noticed that.
---
Thanks for that comment, its good I made this account over a year ago to make this one post and just to be called full of shit, and that I'm making drama. 
---
Honestly though even if I don't play the game, I did pay for it, and I'm not here to make drama. I'd rather share that my account was suspended without being told why, than just let the suspension hang over the game that I spent money on.
---
Stable flux works. Thats how i minimize on crafting materials weight.
---
I just don’t get it. Why don’t the others disappear?! Why ONLY the legendary ones?
---
Lmao
---
Just remember, you have 5 character slots.  Easy to get ten Thistle with just 2 characters.
---
Easy but time consuming to get Fever Blossoms.
---
Also, Thistle appears to spawn for the server, in the same manner that an Alarm clock does. Only one player can pick it up.
---
Fever blossom is like Soot flowers, everyone can harvest same plant.
---
Where do you get these signs!? I cant find anything on them!
---
Congrats, dumbest idea Ive ever seen on this sub and thats saying something
---
If you are on Ps4 I can give you one. It's been in my vendor for weeks. Max level, one star. You can pay with 40mm grenades and missiles.
---
Communist propaganda
---
I dont think its common. I have been playing since beta. 
---
I was over weight in a silo in power armor and the server crashed and I lost all my junk and a fully upgraded x-01 power suit. thats a jet pack and 2 calibrated leg mods just gone. those take about 4 hours a peice to make for me by grinding nuke drops and picking flowers getting high rad fluid etc. so that made me have a fit of nerd rage. 
---
The second time I lost all of my stuff was in one of those dead zones where you just walk in and die for no reason. I spammed stim packs and managed to loot everything from the first death and then the server crashed. 
---
thats the only two really hard hits I have had to take in the lose crap department and I have around 1500 to 2000 hours (its been awhile since I checked) 
---
now I always have a spare x-01 suit rdy to go lol.
---
They were in the atom shop for a while. They’re no longer available.
---
You throw a nuke into a resort and expect things to be alive.
---
What.
---
Oh actual propaganda. Nice job my guy keep it going. It's important to out them and keep them down
---
I erased one recently. I just saved some of his nice items (instigating + faster swing baseball bat) and treasure maps, screws...
---
You dropped a nuke on them, of course they’re dead. 
---
/s
---
yeah. totally don't believe a word of what you're saying man. you're welcome to keep talking though.
---
I sell them for 250 caps in my vendor and they always move. Some people don't want to server hop to find them and some don't know you can get them from WS.
---
Yup . L O S E R
---
He told us he was using cheat engine to make it so people could get weapons from the purveyor without using script, instead using caps. This is an exploitative bug that would effect the economy as a whole. 
---
While hacking and cheating in nw is very much not so. It is bad and against tos, but most rewards are account bound, and have very little effect on overall economy.
---
So you're just under the mindset that everything anyone says against this game is just made up? 
---
There are times when things go wrong with a game that you like, and you should probably just accept that.
---
Well I mean you are entitled to your opinion but what makes it good outside of a community?
---
unyeilding players drink it so that they get precise dosages of radiation is the only thing I can think of. if you had two perks of lead belly you could drink it like water i imagine.
---
Drink it. Thats what I do
---
Never saw it before lol and I am level 634
---
Oh don’t be so goddamn dramatic. Whether or not I like 76 has zero bearing on how good ES 6 is gonna be. They already know everybody hates them, it’s not like more hatred is gonna change a single thing.
---
I don't know about favorite but I've got about 150 hours into it so that must say something haha
---
I just like how relaxing it is. Just roam around, grind, craft, etc. Almost at lvl 100.
---
no no I just think you in particular are full of crap. the rest is just you continuing your attempt at trolling.
---
Can't say you werent warned. lol
---
Ok thanks.
---
Gargle.
---
Drink it
---
Xbox
---
It was a great game from the beginning. I have maybe 800 hours in it and that's usually about when I quit a game, but this one I keep playing.
---
And add the cage armor!
---
You didn't answer the question. Are you assuming CM works while in a HS, it dosn't?
---
Why not just block them and move servers?
---
This would get me to play the game again, if only for another week or so.
---
But then again they'll lock it behind F1st and forbid placing atom items in them so maybe not even.
---
Make sure you record the footage as the evidence. It's probably the only way to protect yourself in the wasteland.
---
*japanese flag users left the convo
---
Well, you don't seem like someone that would listen to reason, or believe any sort of actual evidence, so fine, believe whatever you want. Have fun assuming the worst of people.
---
Works while unarmored and stationary
---
On PC if the game launcher does not shut down properly it will make you log in at the game start, and since that patch, it always fails.
---
 I just kill it off with task manager and it works properly after it starts up. It might log you in the launcher but that will work.
---
 I dunno how a console would kill off the launcher, so that's up to you.
---
1. research how pvp mechanics work. 
---
2. research how private servers work.
---
3. learn to server hop.
---
4. if in the case you did have passive engaged and you owned no workshops and you were not part of a team. they were cheating or hacking and you should definitely report them to Bethesda.
---
So they ruined the game by not giving away free stuff quick enough. Entitled much?
---
no no you're doing it again. just you man just you.
---
don't worry i did. i will send link to post soon
---
I did don't worry
---
My brother suggested I try setting down my system and unplugging it for a bit and that should shut down everything as long as I leave it unplugged long enough for the capacitors to drain completely
---
LOL yes . funny how many little things your high level can do that you just take for granted.
---
Still a problem on my main. Works fine on my alts too just like you. No progress yet.
---
naah what happened is they attacked my friend and killed him multiple times then they attacked my camp and became wanted and you should be able to figure out the rest
---
Funny.  All complaining.  All still here.
---
Great as a lubricant when it comes to making sweet love to a dead Responder. But hey, you can drink it too. It weighs less than water.
---
Yea, because that's what you do when you genuinely care about an IP. You hang around in hopes that it will eventually turn around. I mean heck, look at my screen name, despite everything reddit has to offer, the only reason I made an account was for this game (likewise why i couldn't care less about the downvotes. Since that's not what the voting system is intended for, each downvote is basically the equivalent of a teper tantrum from those who are mad i dont agree with them). But at the same time I'm not gonna have Stockholm syndrome like many of you here.  
---
Be offended as you must at my answer (you dont need to take it personally, unless you're actually a dev at home, in which case I would say your time is more better spent on a coding bootcamp because your abilities suck), but I gave an honest reply to the question. It's not like I created one of those whining "I quit" threads like so many of the people who get bent out of shape about it.  
---
Sorry that this is how interaction works. It's not always going to be an echo chamber of people who share your opinion.
---
Nope.
---
This is 100% it.
---
They ran the math, got their RoR, and are just trying to squeeze the rest of the money out with as little effort as possible.
---
What does them being Fallout 1st subscribers have to do with your encounter?  You never mentioned how you knew that were all Fallout 1st and further more, you never mentioned that they bullied you because they were Fallout 1st and you were not. No mention of this at all.
---
They use Cheat engine to find root of the bugs/exploits so Bethesda Game Studios can have easier time to patch up and send out fixes in short amount of time. But Customer Support seems to be out of touch with other department so they punishing those who help/report and let those who does it to ruin it are getting slap on the wrist. Bethesda are the one to blame here for not getting this sorted out. The term “Don't hate the player, hate the game” seems to apply here.
---
i want to go on a date with rose
---
Arguing with a mod WCGW
---
I had some legendaries disappear on me too.until i ran to where they spawn and look around.found couple of them in their little meatpile.with bugs flying around it.so do what i do and figure their spawnpoint and look.good luck.
---
so your friend had pvp enabled and engaged in pvp with them and got your camp blasted. is he a friend friend or just a rando you were teamed with. sounds like the typical faceguy for the griefers joins your team then commits you to pvp so his buddies can murder you routine. I got farmed once or twice daily from the same guy for 2 weeks because my "friend" was serving as his eyes ears and bridge to my server. anyway an empty friend list is a happy friendlist for me. (well not completely empty but only very few very trusted peeps.)
---
Yeah, an update that likely will never ever arrive. Pick a different hill to die on
---
I nuked a few places, does that count as rebuilding :)
---
Yeah. You can say that all you want but the reality is I still can’t claim a ladder and characters look/feel like they have rigormortis.
---
No one would be complaining if the engine didn’t suck, but it does. And yeah, part of that is legacy issues.
---
r/hailcorporate

You’re the second person I’ve heard that from, I’ll definitely have to try do that! Thank you

I'm guessing this is for the weekly challenge?

Even a broken clock is right twice a day.

Drink it. It's a good water source and has some disease resist.
---
I have speed demon and complete all of these with a lot of time to spare. I didn’t even consider that. I don’t have nearly that much lag though, maybe a second here or there, never 5-15
---
I've said this to my uncle while playing with him. We're from Australia and I like having flags in my camp builds. I use the Raider and meat week flags becuase the American flag is pretty lacking but if we could have our own countries flag would be nice. I'd buy it from the atomic store. No one can say this would be lore breaking as there's NCR armour in the game now

I mean skyrim on the PlayStation 3 suffered due to how that system handled random access memory
---
it looks like an clean version of the Spacesuit that u can find in the crashed spacestation and thats the clue. the clean suit is a little bit tricky to find but if ya know it its just a 'timechallenge' :D
---
It ended up being server lag. I hopped a few times and tried again and it was smooth. 
---
Nukes turn the servers to shit it seems
---
I was on a public server yesterday where someone nuked Whitespring. The nuke didn't kill any of the enemies that were there when it dropped, and they didn't drop any nuked loot either. Eventually they did respawn as bloated ones.
---
Of filthy casuals? Yeah, I know. Those fragile little fucks cry every time someone points out basic facts about this game.
---
It’s better for everyone if they stay on their self enforced day care though.
---
Are you seriously taking trolls so seriously that you believe the Russians are impacting the fallout 76 sub?😂 You sir won boomer of the year award
---
yup. i’ve never had to repair my power armour once since i crafted both my excavator and X-01, not a bad thing though imo
---
I ran riflemen till like level 120 and then was like, hey let's try auto. And even a single trigger pull with the auto was nearly the same effect as the semi. So I went full auto. The biggest benefit is being able to spray when your being overrun.
---
I donno how your doing with ammo but I've crafted and traded my way to 60k+ 556. Ammos not much if a worry.
---
I'd ship him with the art teacher at Watoga High.
---
They should do what Rockstar did with Max Payne 3 cheaters.  
---
  
---
They should just force all cheaters to only be able to play against other cheaters and nobody else.  
---
This way, all the people that want to play (those not cheating) can have a fair fight against other players and not be 360 no-scoped from across the map by a hacker.
---
How did you reach level 600+ ? 🤯
---
Nope it doesn't. Mine disappeared after a while. However, if you "store" it in your camp budget it does stay there without rotting away at all but keep in mind there's no real benefit to that.
---
Welcome out of cult brother. We’ve been waiting. It’s ok to be angry.
---
Its roleplay. Jesus christ.
---
Multiple game modes would seriously bring life back to this game
---
Cool.
---
Except activision will sneak in very predatory MTX’s a month or so after launch like last years CoD game
---
🤨
---
He just confuses the ghouls, who don't even try to attack him, but follow him around Morgantown in unison, like rad rats following the Pied Piper bot.
---
Okay
---
Judging on your posts online you quit about 3 months ago
---
Either by playing nonstop w/ xp boosts or utilizing xp glitches.
---
Well, the problem is your friend who kept instigating PvP.
---
The whole pro-1st/anti-1st thing is just the latest excuse from our self-proclaimed "Raiders" to troll and grief others.  If you fight back, you give them *exactly* what they want, and therefore they will keep doing it.  This is how their brains are wired.  Instead, you should pretend they don't exist.  Block them, mute them, let them waste their time.  After all, the more time they spend futilely trying to goad you into attacking, the less they are targeting some low-level somewhere.
---
Just guessing, there can be some Enclave update or expansion, so they could add this weapon to purveyor roll or we can acquire them through some quest or events.. Not sure but we are still Defcon Level 1 of 5.. We will see what will happen. :)
---
Hey...Im a raider, my character sees things more like to tame the animal of the wasteland you must be one, so I only attack and kill things I know can fight back.."IE no trolling low lvls or anyone really that dosent want to scrap, there is no fun in that."....Well I would really be Enclave. But its more like Enclave&gt;BOS&gt;Raider&gt;Settlers&gt;Responders. Yet I feel you can only really show off raider/responder gear with BOS and Enclave being kinda on the low end of representation IE cosmetics/camp stuff. But I encourage building of the wasteland, so I can burn things...cuz....the cycle and crap
---
Interesting, so it just ignores the Diluted ones.  That's good to know.
---
Given BGS track record with this game, I’m pretty sure the idea that they are “doing it right not rushing” and acting in the games long term back interest are *exactly* arguing the exception.
---
Lets hope that they expand on the enclave in wastelanders
---
PA/Heavy. I walk through the fire while spiting my own.
---
Good thing is that any uncollected loots get fallen into your path so that you can collect them as well
---
Correct the diluteds are the red headed step child of the stim family
---
Power Armor takes a *very* long time to decay.  That's just how it is.
---
I had a level 14 one shotting me while had a tanky build equipped the other day. I thought I was going crazy and just not seeing his level right. Came back a few times due to confusion, my base ended up getting destroyed. I'm level 117, I'm accustomed to PVP, on the ps4.
---
Hard to find a live one these days
---
Actually not sure about it.. I guess there will be seperated expansion for that. Bye who knows, Bethesda likes to surprise us! Hehe.
---
It sure would and this is one way we can make do with now.
---
I see what you did there.  That's funny as hell.
---
If only they did that in this game. Then your comment would be relevant.
---
Lv195, went full auto on my handmade BE and got a Instigating MG42/LMG from the perverted, never had so much fun, but yes, you do need a lot of ammo, lol
---
The sound of the MG42 / LMG is sick, even the SBQ is yelling "retreat" now  :D
---
Nah
---
I am level 360 something. been playing since beta. I am a PA laser gat guy. I rock a full set of X-01 with jet packs 99.9 % of the time. I am the laziest player I know. 
---
pvp is a big nope. its pretty much a show up and die suit for pvp. in pve I can tank the entire bog at once. 
---
if you like to craft getting in and out of  PA is an annoying bitch. I only exit the power armor now to craft mutation serums every ten queen kills or so. My entire playstyle revolves around not crafting, not swapping a lot of perk cards, and not getting in and out of power armor. my typical loop is me going out and killing / looting stuff. putting stuff on vendors scrapping and storing the rest. discarding the trash rinse repeat. 
---
my laser gats lets me farm ammo passively without crafting. with private server I can get 18 cores per hour which is 18,000 shots for me. also its nice for go juice with the PA 
---
I hate having a bunch of clutter in inventory.my battleload to go to a queen fight my load out is at 55 pounds. 
---
I do not use bear arms or traveling pharmacy instead I have bullet sheild and blocker. combine that with lone wanderer perk and a vampiric ultracite laser gatling nothing in the pve world can hurt me. 
---
the mutation for regeneration is my other go to mutation for being lazy. I kill all the things combat drops I get topped off in health for free. 
---
1 stim pack in case someone near me goes down. that one guy gets a stim . everyone else is screwed. without traveling pharmacy stim packs weigh 1 pound each. I rarely use it but its nice to poke someone from time to time :P  
---
3 superstims in case my vamp laser gat breaks while I am getting gangbanged by a pack of horny radscorpions. when that happens I engage jetpacks while cursing and spamming my super stims. that rarely happens but it happens enough that I always carry three. 
---
10 radaway incase I feel a strange urge to farm high rad fluids or something in the rad zone. I only carry so little because I have one point in the perk called sunkissed. it removes radiation in the daylight. I am thinking of dropping that to 5 radaways . I rarely use them and when I restock my self I always seem to be at 6 or higher. 
---
Melons for food and water in one click without cooking. supported by green thumb perk, good with salt, herbivore mutation, and thru hiker for weight. thats a lot of perks to avoid cooking but all my damage and defensive perks are maxed for being a power armor user. yeah yeah "dog food build!" no because you have to carry water as well as dog food and dog food is a pain to get sometimes. melons regrow fast. Melons are almost always avaidible, food and water one button. dog food can go straight to h.... my vendor for 5 caps per come on by ! enjoy my awesome dogfood everyone should run dog food build !. I also sell purified water to go with the dog food for only 1 per and I have free purifiers out side of my shop. 
---
Oh and back on topic jump jets plus marsupial plus bird bones means going a lot of places no one else can. it is the best most conveniant mobility in the game. 
---
Yes PA is awesome for end game in my opinion,
---
Is doing it in group an absolute must or would one stand a chance alone as well?
---
You know it’ll happen
---
Laser rifles use fusion cells. Gatling lasers use fusion cores. Plasma gatlings use plasma cores. Gauss uses 2mm rounds and plasma rifles use plasma cells. Ultracite variants use the same ammo as above with a natural bonus to scorched but if you put a prime receiver on a non ultracite weapon it than requires ultracite ammo which will than make it shoot green lasers if its a laser variant.
---
Just playing and doing lots of queens daily I do around 9 queens a day
---
Weren’t transfers in ark on PS4 disabled temporarily due to an exploit?
---
it is possible to solo it, (there is a video of a guy doing this weeks expert solo, a more recent person did a standard solo guide).  i do heavily advise against it though just because of the mats/stim burn.
---
Sigh.  This is the same shit that was going on before 1st came out.
---
Yup. A few months back i didnt see bethesda's true form. Now i do. And as a bonus you wont get the extra caps. They disappear into the ether, just as all my junk did. They still havent restored my items but they "fixed" the glitch. Sure just as they fixed so many bugs that either have been here since launch or return after the next patch. Me losing my junk was the last straw  ive defended this game through its worst, but this went too far.
---
Sometimes all you have to do is make a statement
---
It's entirely different teams.  
---
Bethesda Maryland is the team that makes the mainline titles for The Elder Scrolls and Fallout, they made TES: 1-5, FO3 and FO4, and are currently working on Starfield a brand new space RPG and TES6.  
---
FO76 is made by Bethesda AUSTIN a very small dev team, that got some help during main development but as far as anyone can tell have been entirely solo on the ground since launch, they have very little resources and not much experience as FO76 is their first actual game. (previously they made the multiplayer for Doom 2016 but that's about it)
---
Each peice procs individually and has it's own cooldown
---
&gt;And a class of gameplay that was both rewarding, engaging and creative.
---
It's called "fun" and the community is literally the main aspect of the game. Hence it being a "Multiplayer" experience. Without the community that fo76 has, It's an empty experience.
---
Yeah... I really didn't think I had to specify this was sarcastic when I threw in the 50% chance for the insurance to even work and free player icon part.
---
Or maybe the sub has seen too many sarcastic "bethesda cash grab" posts and they're tired of it.
---
/R/UnexpectedRunescape
---
The fact that you guys banned people for working with your community managers in digging into these exploits, finding out how they worked, and reported the exact details so that your dev teams can expedite the process says a lot to the contrary. Sorry, but I never have bought Fallout 76, and I never will.
---
Because we don't make up stories?
---
This isint made up i was just playing and this happened.
---
You must be on a PC, none of this happens to me on XB1, games run fine on XB. Not saying I don't see lag from time to time, I do, but in the most part runs just fine.
---
they make fallout 152 and its set in east virginia, which if you didnt know was the opposite of west virginia
---
and its a racing game
---
Well, how often do you use them? For me, only when dealing with a scorchbeast or the queen derivative. So usually not very often at all.
---
Of course? Are you slow or something? If a company does something bad thats profitable for one product why on earth would they not then try doing that in their other products??? Of course more backlash has the potential to change things? If no one bought or supported the crap to begin with do you think they'd be in the game? 
---
And no you have no self respect because you just take whatever scraps you're given rather than wanting something to be better, both for yourself and the sake of the thing. 
---
It's so sad to see some people are such ignorant sheep who are happy to ruin games for others just because they're happy with anything.
---
Yea I’m on pc. Not suggesting the game always plays this bad but this was my experience jumping back in for the first time in months.
---
Im a masochist. So i met this guy online and he films me playing 76 and than he threatens to show it to all my friends and family if i dont do what he wants. Which is to usually help him do quests and queen fights. The thought of people i know finding out i play 76 and that i sometimes play it as a female character is such a rush but hopefully they never find out.
---
Good info, thanks.
---
I read a few threads where certain PC players experience extreme slowness so this would suck, but in general that's why I always liked the console I don't generally have to deal with those types of issues, but I hear you, it would suck if this happened.
---
Riveting tale, chap.
---
Y'all are full of shit.
---
If the date is successful, the Robobrain should develop a similar drinking habit and become tamable as an eligable pet.
---
It was addressed in the patch notes recently as a bug, so don’t expect is to last much longer
---
You sound like a dick.
---
Absolutely
---
If enough people think its garbage they wont buy ig. I dont think its garbage at this point
---
=\] At least the polymer works, scout is good stuff too.

Totally agree.

This is a different trashcan than the one from 6 months ago. I know because I used to stick lettering on mine that said 'stash'.

Well, I've had dogs stuck under some floors and stuff when defending workshops etc, but I use grenades to finish them off. Have had some ctd's. I'm kinda used to this from Bethesda having played their other games. I still enjoy it
---
Oh no a bug in a game wow I’ve never seen that before this is a whole new world lemme go rage online about it
---
Cashed in today, got a troubleshooters fixer. 5th fixer from murg. I have a qe handmade, ended up in storage after some test runs. It's kind of average on everything.

---
damn i f\*\*ing hate them, espacualy if they "grab" you of the air  :D   
---
beside that, iam feel nearly the same
---
Sorry, let me be more serious with my reply this time...  There absolutely is a cost to the tent.
---
I'm pretty sure the main point to having a tent somewhere is to eliminate the travel fees and have a quick place to sleep/play/stash stuff.  Why should your camp take priority over anyone else's stuff?  That tent is just as important to them as your camp is to you.
---
What happens when you log off?  Now the player has lost their tent location and they have to pay caps to get as close as they can to place their tent again.  So **there is a cost to replace it** as well as all the potential caps you've 'taken' from them by taking their free travel point.  I'm just playing devils advocate to illustrate the other side of the coin you're not seeing.
---
If the tent radius isn't smaller than a camp then I absolutely agree with you on that, but I have no idea if that's the case.  I'm pretty sure I've seen some tents pretty dang close to each-other but I honestly don't see them much.
---
Which brings me to my final point, how often does this really happen?  I can't remember the last time I logged on to a server and my camp location was already taken.  Maybe you need to place your stuff in less popular locations.  The map is massive, if you're in a popular location just move it a little further away.  Placing your camp or tent in a popular area is a choice you're making and as frustrating as it is, if you keep it there you're choosing to deal with that annoyance every time you log in.
---
Except everyone has played the game the same since beta and now it makes people who don’t have it either find a new server or live without anything because someone else has paid to get a few extra caps in their pocket
---
Cool story bro.
---
nice push on the astroturf narrative but thats bullshit. exploiting the crap out of bugs then getting caught because one of your friends reports you is what gets you banned,
---
Shame on you fools. Game was an obvious cash grab, released broken buggy and unfinished, not supported and had anyone trying to help the community shit on.
---
Call it Mechanical Matchmaker.
---
ah, the day 1 request that never came through.
---
How’s the bandwagon? Must be cold riding it this time of year.
---
honestly it sounds like your higher brain functions have been paralyzed by an inability to mate and an excess of testerone. PVErs are like marathoners in a race. everyone kind of runs at their own pace and encourages each other. pvpers are more like a football team, competitive, driven, craving battle. why beth thought they could mix the two is beyond me.
---
What gives you this "hunch"? Not having to pay for any content update so yet?

Easy as pie.

Fire station in Charleston, workout room.

Right next door, AVS Medical also workout room.

Then hit one or two silos. All of them have a workout room in the very beginning.

I actually his the silos first, cause the station has a bunch of benches in it for crafting.

---
Okay so let me get this straight, working with community managers **to directly report bugs/exploits to devs** instead of submitting tickets *(that never get responded to like everyone else's)* is Bethesda **NOT AUTHORIZING YOU TO ASSIST IN BUG SPOTTING.** 
---
Strange, its almost like your analogy was wrong from the start. 
---
Its more like a mall cop being arrested for attempting to arrest someone who was clearly breaking the law because they happened to cross a prohibited section chasing down the suspect who got away scott-free. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;  because YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE DOING ON THE SERVER'S SIDE 
---
Honestly the data miners probably have a better lay of the land then Bethesda does. Lets not forget the sentry bot gun sound thats been "fixed" 4 times already.
---
FYI the cripple perk card is called "One Gun Army" in LUCK, "Stabilized" in INT is the ignore armor perk.
---
A great community in a shit game still leaves you with a shit game Bethesda shill.
---
What? How does that work?
---
It's a known issue, will happen in Non-Private Servers and if memory serves popped up in Fallout 4 (rarely) as well, fast travel to a location and everything is either dead or falls over dead.  
---
Bethesda originally called it a non-issue (someone killed them before you...) but with the Advent of Private servers we've proven it's an issue.
---
Have it documented on this page.

Now just gotta wait till UK implements this in. What a flop of a game.
---
Full melee is the strongest build while staying in the boundaries of "balanced". The most damage potential is in melee, the most comparable to legendary effect damage you can get is with melee, for straight damage melee is the way to go. I run tank melee, but I've heard sneak is pretty good too.
---
Woah shit, I didn't know you worked for Bethesda and had access to the logs! It's very rare we get someone from Bethesda to actually have a discussion in the comments here!
---
I haven't played in many patches but I do recall collecting all the tapes and finishing all known tasks/locations.  No way to complete it at that point and it was epicly annoying tryi g to clean up quest log. 
---
Not surprised it's still unfinished or broke MANY months later.
---
Some days after logging it wouldn't be in the log, other days it would, just with no way to progress/ complete it.
---
The one inside goes into the Whitesprings Bunker if I’m not mistaken and the cottages I’m not sure
---
I agree but instead we are stuck with this pile of horse shit
---
The fact that the most updated posts here are workaround or stupid shit people shouldn't be doing on a so called AAA game is a joke.
---
Then shouldnt u be on an outer worlds subreddit?
---
Honestly just go off cosmetics. Damage resistance past 100 means so little in 99% of situations you might as well wear whatever
---
The hand scanning pads next to the cottage doors were likely part of a cut quest called "Room Service".
---
That's the Ultracite Gatling Laser
---
Its sad because this community of players is obviously one of the best Ive ever seen in a game.
---
No. They already know.
---
Yep but I finished it so back to Appalachia
---
Great though, the Fallout 1st Tent is flawed in several ways, including the footprint the size of a standard C.A.M.P., this would partially solve the issue..

"I made a fresh character so i could pretend like it was my first time and went in again. Immediately the game ran very poorly but setting it to fullscreen instead of borderless fixed this for the most part."
---
You are trying to play on a potato or your lying. I have been playing since beta my gaming rig is getting older and the graphics have always been decent. 
---
"After arriving at the first town the event started. I went towards the event and 1 of the robots were stuck in a tree. "
---
I have done the agricultural mission hundreds of time and never seen this. beginning to think you're full of crap.
---
"Eventually i was able to bait it out by having it attempt to attack me and was able to kill it. Throughout the event robots were no being dealt damage when I hit them with melee attacks."
---
did you have a weapon equipped? cause a board with spikes and a level 5 guy in leather armor and 0 str points will one and two shot those fuckers, done it hundreds of times. no problem. the melee attack bug you're mindlessly parroting don't happen in low level characters. you cant replicate the melee damage bug without some high level effort. 
---
"After completing the event I went back to town to do main quest things and as I was leaving town the game crashed so bad I had to restart my pc."
---
actually plausible, if you're playing on a potato its more likely, if you are on shitty internet its more likely. If a douchebag duper is doing his duping thing then he can crash a server, but I suspect you're full of crap already at this point so I am not inclined to believe you."
---
"In all seriousness how are you people still playing and actively supporting the game. Its been over a year and this is still going on, alongside all the current controvers"
---
because I havent experienced a portion of the crap you talk about and I have actually been playing the game. I ignore the controversy because I know you're full of crap or you have a really shitty PC or connection. 
---
The term that describes what you and all the anti bethers are doing by posting here with loads of bullshit is called "astroturfing" I would tell you to look it up but you already know what it means and are actively engaged in the process. 
---
the term that best describes why all the hate from you tubers is called "click baiting." rage videos get click. pure and simple. those dumb fucks complain about games for a living. only a dumber fuck actually listens to them. 
---
For all of those lurking to just read these forums to feel out the game just be aware its not that bad. buggy sometimes. yes its had its issues but it runs good most of the time and the player base is growing,
---
I've literally seen NOTHING good come out of this sub so the fact ppl are STILL complaining, yet still playing, baffles me.
---
Ah I love when ignorant fools realize they have no other option but to resort to being condescending and dismissive. Glad we can both agree you have no argument and you're just being selfish and small minded 👍🏻

Little over 230 hours, I've ever launched a nuke before, be fun to give it a go.  I love server-hopping and farming for ledgies, though.

ooh dude a tip for you ! If the dogs get clipped into a wall and you cant kill them with regular grenades nuka grenades will get them. I always have three just for that reason. that wont work for going through the ground though. if they glitch below ground I just fast travel far out of the cell and then back to get them to respawn.

---
oh thanks!
---
ew.
---
I wouldn’t say the fallout 76 community is the best I mean they are loyal but that’s not good
---
Apples and oranges.
---
I’m not saying there isn’t some prioritization issues on Bethesda’s end. The problem lies with willful admissions and accusations....
---
When you are reporting a bug (That you have used yourself) involving the use of a cheat engine or exploit, you are admitting that you used those methods to the organization you’re reporting to. This is an admission of guilt, regardless if the purpose of the report is to prevent this exploit from being used by the community at large.
---
When you are reporting someone you suspect is using cheats, you are accusing someone based on evidence that seems burdening. The disconnect from the previous scenario is the absence of an admission of guilt from the suspect. While all of the player’s movements and behaviors seem to be the result of a cheat engine or exploit, there can be other reasons for it.
---
For example, if I see someone snorting white powder in public, it doesn’t mean they are necessarily doing cocaine - it could be some really good powdered sugar. However, if this behavior is a disturbance to the public, they can be removed from the area.
---
Not attacking you, just trying to clear up the confusion!
---
Lemme grab my copy/paste so you can see all the content updates. This won't include changes or quality of life additions, just the content updates
---
Kinda sounds familiar doesn’t it?
---
Gonna give you a list of things you missed. This is a copy paste message and may not be applicable to the questions asked. Reply and I'll go into detail on things if you want
---
March is when they actually started improving the game, from Nov-Feb it was only bug fixes and a boring world. Not listing things in any order, you missed:
---
three weeklong holiday events with camp and cosmetic rewards (minor addition)
---
alcohol crafting with daily quests (minor addition) 
---
a camera for taking quicker pictures (minor addition)
---
New faction and questline with backpack reward (large addition)
---
Sheepsquatch questline with unique weapon reward and side quests, two repeatable events (major addition)
---
Small dungeon with quest (small addition)
---
Large dungeon with repeatable event (large addition)
---
Player Vending Machines (small addition)
---
Nuclear Winter game mode with 51 other players in a battle Royale scenario with special cosmetic rewards (major addition)
---
Special vendor that gives random Legendaries in exchange for other Legendaries (small addition)
---
Vault Raid which gives guaranteed armor rewards with unique set bonuses (major addition)
---
Display cases for your camp which allows you to place items so visitors can view them (minor addition)
---
Basically I put either small, large, or major for what these updates added to the game. However, that's only in terms of content. For example I would say player vending and the legendary vendor were bigger adds than say vault raids or the Arktos Pharma dungeon. Still a buggy game though, but that's what Bethesda is. Wastelanders will be like a chapter 2 with a supposedly different feel but it's coming out early next year
---
LOL one of my gamer friends at work gave me an "ew 76" comment when he asked what I was playing now days. his current game is battlefield 5. I asked him if 5 was as bad as everyone said. "no" "neither is 76."
---
Remember everyone, 2020 is an election year so get out there and vote!
---
So *busy*.
---
I love this idea! u/LadyDevann I hope you pass it on to the moneti- uh dev team!
---
The ranger armor isn't necessarily NCR specific. It is riot gear, so it can be from really anywhere. So it doesn't break lore. An NCR flag would.
---
I use my power Armor constantly switching between X-01 and Excavator, I’ve only ever had to repair it once when I had level 25 pieces. I’m level 91 now and still have yet to decay at all
---
Only at every democrat strong hold. out here in my County our roads are nice infrastructure is top tier water services are tip top. Mostly a republican constituency. We all got guns, politicians listen better when their constituents are all potentially violent and armed.
---
Yeah my friend said the same thing to me too
---
Good point.
---
bye o/
---
Stop giving them ideas, they'll just end up selling them back to you.
---
I honestly can't fathom why ANYONE still supports this game. And that is coming from someone who played it for a  good while. The handling of this product has been absolutely abysmal and appalling. . Its horrible. You people should all come to r/Starfield where we talk about what will hopefully be a game that Bethesda actually cares about and isn't some corporate mandated bullshit.
---
Yes please I will so not procrastinate on the next red rocket bundle and make a pimpin red rocket if we can display PA
---
Wah wah wah. A fool and his money are soon parted.
---
Thanks for the reminder! Also, you are suffering from Bone Worms.
---
8pm EST
---
Okay...that’s fair logic, but also going by that then when Wastelanders is released it should be perfectly flawless. A single DLC created by a AAA company for over a year should be beyond reproach... but it won’t be. It’ll be buggy and glitchy and break most of the game like every other update. It’s not opinion, it’s their own pattern.
---
I think its reviewing generally well but for me the world felt surface-level and I was just left feeling a bit, "why do i care about this?"
---

For me much better - I can finally go to private server and farm all three fusion core generators without feeling like I am hogging all the resources and I don't have to worry about pvpers. I have a pve build and I have never like being forced to be the sacrificial lamb for pvpers. Ironically fusion cores are for my vamp ultra laser gatling which is awesome for pve but I was forced to be vulnerable to pvpers to get my ammo. fuck them, fuck that. I am out in private land for ammo farming now days.For the first time since beta I can actually completely avoid pvp now. I prefer public servers for the people and what not for most of my game play so what I do is go private and farm up a week or twos worth of fusion cores and then I go back to normal play on public servers. the rest of the game is great and floop will be giving a lot of details on that I see lol.
---
"It just works"
---
I haven't played 76 in a while due to all the drama I've been hearing about it and out of distaste for what it's become, but if it's true that there is NCR armor in-game, we're already past the point of breaking lore.
---
Isn’t it because super mutants and scorched are already irradiated? They eat uranium for breakfast
---
Yes, definitely.  We had them in 4, they've been built into the game mechanics as they have one in the lab at Garrahan Mining Headquarters, tucked away in the corner.... Got soooo excited thinking it may be one of the quest rewards but alas..... Oh, also, normal armor stands. I wanna show of my outfit collection, dang it....
---
super mutants have never glowed in any of the other stories. robots are not biological creatures but they do glow from thruster's and heat exchanges and lasers. scorched are scorched already mutated from both radiation and the scorched plague. this is the dumbest attempt at lambasting Bethesda I have seen today. congrats you win.
---
Because they weren't in Fallout 4
---
Its definitely better but its still lackluster
---
Wtf is this an why do we get them randomly (or seemingly randomly).?
---
messenger is always concidered savage divide no matter where it spawns just to let you know
---
Ah my precious. just know if you ever go Vamp/junk/or Unyeilding build with an ultracite laser gatling you will never be happy with anything else. good for shooting at range/ up close, impressing the girls, (well just my wife really she was impressed enough to reroll an alt specifically to fire a vamp ultra laser gat she went right out and bought after trying out my character.) 
---
the others have already posted all the pertinate data concerning every thing else related.
---
The only friend I have that had 1st told me she tried reloading the server and her nuke spot disappeared. Kinda wish they explained more details on the private server
---
if your name is lazarus in game (pc)  we have been to the same queen fights multiple times.
---
Ultracite gives a flat damage boost against everything, Zeolots is the one prefix that is better for scorched only and prime is good against everything but you have to make ultracite fusion cores which gets very expensive very quickly.
---
Is it just me or has this sub turned from a fallout 76 sub to a sub that doesn’t like the game?

Look at this clown.

---
Don't you have Call of Duty or Blizzard to be outraged about?
---
Yeah for real BGS, cash out on this idea!
---
That armor is introduced in Fallout: New Vages, but in the lore it’s just riot/raid armor like a swat team would have. It’s used more out West one might assume but it’s should be theoretical obtainable any where riot police or swat teams might be deployed.

On the other, it is set in Appalachia &amp; I doubt every second home would be owned by foreigners. And the ones that were would do the decent thing &amp; display the flag of their adopted country the USA. 
---
Well that's how I am when I've lived overseas. Integrate &amp; show respect to the locals for allowing me into their community
---
" Have I seriously just wasted the last hour going through a bunker to nuke the Whitespring for absolutely nothing? " Looks like it. an hour ?? why so slow? 
---
 "Have I seriously wasted my money on your bugged as absolute FUCK shitty game? " If you feel that way I guess so. but if you're high enough level to launch a nuke you got your moneys worth pipe down already. 
---
" Please for the love of God, focus on fixing this fucking game. " Agreed I would rather them squash bugs than release new content. - but if they don't make money the investors get pissed - if they dont push wastelanders they will be accused of lying about releasing new content - so yeah its ok they will get to it when they can I am sure.
---
You can use light boxes (that's how they called I think?) to create your own flag with terminal and also there are neon signs. Ta-da!
---
Maybe a communist China flag from Mama Dulce’s? There is a 50 states flag so antique flags from real world nations from around the 1950s could be cool? The lore has put world and the world of fallout separating in that decade I think
---
There could be pride for our ancestors perhaps?
---
Haha this is added to your inventory when someone in the map completes the death blossoms event.
---
I seem to get them added when I stand still to long
---
If you managed to get a few dozen kaleidopore flowers from Project Arktos and need more Ash Roses than are available in Lewisburg you can find more at Abandoned Mine Shaft 1.
---
Wired connection with 100+ down. Rtf 2080 i9 9900. Like i said the FPS issue was only when playing borderless, that was not meant to be the big takeaway.
---
Shoulda bought fallout 1st premium
---
I like how this was kept but oh God let's remove feed the people!!!
---
One reason Beth can "get away" with this and that is there is no direct competition. Another game doesn't exist that is like 76.
---
Actually that's false the ranger armor wasnt NCR armor it was used by them originally the ranger armor was riot armor for the LAPD and was just used by the rangers the armor in game actually represents this as nine of the skins have the NCR insignia on them
---
Y'all need to stop thinking anyone criticizing the game is making it up. I started a new character a while back and had a similar bad experience.
---
That sounds like communism. Better dead than red!
---
Yep. The bombs fell on October 23. A lot seem to forget this. I remember seeing posts in the past asking why with all the Halloween stuff in the games.
---
Bethesda bans you for "testing" and then not reporting bugs if that's what you mean sure
---
Wow there are still people supporting Bethesda and this game? FO76 and you all are made for each other.
---
Not sure on the gat lasers, but on laser rifles/pistols they actually do less damage, in exchange for a higher rate of fire.
---
Sadly no grenades at that time, this character was fresh out of the vault at this point.
---
Less bugs, more qol, bit more content added.
---
I left because i got bored. I came back and am doing a new build. Once i hit end game ill probably quit again
---
Oh so it increased 5 to 1. Oh okey got it, thanks for inform. Totally understand.
---
Yeah that would be nice huh.
---
&gt;When wastelanders was delayed it felt like a punch in the gut 
---
Stop being so over-dramatic, man. Games get delayed all the time to be worked on. It's like you're looking for reasons to be upset. 
---
'When wastelanders was delayed it was a minor irritation.'
---
Speaking of plants how and the hell do I get my last one. The swamp plant? I've harvested those swamp blooms at night and never get any...
---
Rad-X suppresses mutations. All your mutations get turned off which can be bad for bloodied builds.
---
Pretty sure I usually just sold it to vendors if I need to max out my daily limit, otherwise I just drink it like a mad man
---
Sounds like a connection problem tbh.
---
Was a nuke going on? That can lag the servers.
---
Or you could stop playing it? At some point you have to blame yourself. You see these issues yet you continue to support it by playing. Save yourself the frustration and let go of it
---
This all day. Ni e to get your scrap and everything without interrupt.
---
Wastelanders.. if it lives up to how it's  sounding. A complete overhaul I will start from scratch and use my main to help my new char through.
---
Idk why we don't see scorched super mutants tho.
---
I've managed to get them down to like 17500. YMMV.
---
Maybe don’t nuke the White spring clown
---
I am loving it most right now actually.
---
I don't want to wait four months for it.
---
Unsure, again was just in the starting town. Connection problems would make sense but it was not my end
---
He’s playing on a private server. Wouldn’t that mean he has it?
---
"ThIs PeRsOn DoEsN't LiKe A gAmE I LiKe. BeSt Be An AsS aBoUt It."
---
I thought we were bantering :( you can handle a little bit meanness I'm certain of it!
---
Way to much. You can get them pretty regularly for 7.5k from players on the trading sub
---
It's not BGS working on this game, it's Bethesda Austin. Do your research.
---
Lol this guy
---
Bantering is fun. Talking to you isn't.
---
It's funny, but we can stick PA frames in to display cases. No PA pieces appear on it, though. I'd love it if they let us display power armor at our camps, but only after increasing the budget, because I can't build anything else.
---
This is a beautiful play on acronyms
---
Pretty sure ultacite laser weapons do not give bounse damage to schorched. They have a higher rof bit less base dmg than normal lasers but both use standerd fusion cells.
---
One you prime either of them they gain. Ounse dmg to schorched and use ultacite fusion ces
---
Raising fov would tank fps.
---
Go check out borderlands. I can pin my fps lower than 15 in that game if i want
---
I wouldn't say they strived.
---
They limped out 15 updates on 12 months.
---
Ok. Trying to find a Grounded Serum Recipe in a rush.  Lmk if you anyone that has one available.  Hoping to not have to buy it from a vendor...
---
There’s a solo mode?
---
Sure thing pardner🌝🌝🌝
---
I dont give a shit if you think I am a shill or not. you're full of crap. whatever verbal explanations and walk backs you offer at this point are just bouncing off the walls of a made up mind sir. I know you're expected to at least make effort for whoever is paying you for your services so its ok if you keep making the effort. I will just keep disputing you and calling out the BS you can ride the clock and go home youre super will be happy.
---
&gt;get lucky.
---
That's a ...different emote.
---
Welcome to Reddit: Nobody listens to any of us fucks on here. In many cases, wisely.
---
17500, which is the lowest price they sell for.
---
Ouch.
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀 Fallout 1st buyer olds the L🦀🦀🦀🦀🌟
---
It's still an ouch price, but way better than the 23/24k. Although when you max out on caps they are a great way of making room for more!
---
You think someone is paying me to make a Reddit post about my negative experience with a game? Never mind you’re not a shill, too stupid to be one. Just delusional.
---
Hey guys look dae atom shop im very funny and original!
---
Gat lasers base damage no modifiers is 17 
---
gat ultracite laser base damage no modifiers is 19
---
It is a noticable difference with maxed out gunner perks and stabilized anti armor effect. 
---
my one star laser gat made me tanky as heck but I always felt like it took to long to kill things. the ultracite is much faster.
---
I hide all match... but I also cover my teammates. The absolute shit storm you can unleash when your team gets into a firefight and the opposing team takes cover from them but not you is hilarious. I soloed a four man team once because by the time they realized where I was, three of them were down and the last one standing had a shotgun vs my lever action at high range.
---
Responsible snipers do what snipers *should* do, and cover their mates. You go get that power armor and LMG, I'll light them up if they get near, and all I ask is your spare .45 once we're safe again.
---
good job billy keep it up we may make you the next employee of the month!
---
We'll see who's laughing when Wastelanders drops.
---
Ah bum bummer then.
---
I came back recently and its been better. Not Perfect but far from when i last played.
---
!remindme 3 months
---
I’m actually curious now, who do you think is paying me? Who has motive to have some random make a post on the fo76 sub talking about their negative experience?
---
Maybe i was just unlucky. Just wanted to try again since double do weekend. Figured it might make it easier to rush through and be able to play some late game areas.
---
Good to see another person realise they're being duped. Sorry about your experience mate.
---
Thanks
---
Dude we’ve been farming the hell out of WS on private servers, but it takes more than one person. We make a circle, someone dashboards and rejoins, everything respawns, another circle, rinse, repeat.
---
I dont know why you guys waste your time. I'm not trying 2 be a dick I just hate seeing my fellow gamers get screwed.
---
Damn. Thanks!
---
I still mostly see them at a single star though which in my play experience still has whitesprings being most rewarding.  Tried farming scorched beasts multiple times now but I’ve seen maybe two that were 3 *, just not worth it to me.  Come out way better doing my normal path thru the map hitting up locations I’ve see. Legendaries at on a single sever before hopping. 
---
But it’s at least nice to have them being possibly 2-3 star which will draw me to them if spotted, ones I just pass on.
---
Yep, happens literally every single time for me too.
---
Holy hell that looks terrifying.  I have issues as it is with level 65 Super Mutants and I'm level 113? (been a few weeks since I have been able to play, cant remember)
---
Mine also a few days ago
---
They did you a favor
---
Not sure if RuneScape or Fallout.
---
Both game developers are scummy bags of dog shit.
---
Yeah, I get it.  Unfortunately this is only the beginning of the "pay to win" content for Bethesda.  Or rather "pay for a better quality of life."
---
They've been ramping it up since the repair kits.  We got scrap kits, collectrons, refrigerators, unlimited scrap storage and the tent.  If you don't pay for Fallout 1st you're gonna be a second class citizen in this game and that's not going to change.  Hopefully enough folks keep to their "I'm only doing one month" idea to send a message these micro-transactions are out of hand, but I doubt it.
---
And what's worse is I easily have the means to pay for Fallout 1st, and I likely will if they continue adding quality of life improvements to it.  Which just makes it worse for those who can't afford it.  But at the end of the day this game gives me a reprieve from my daily stresses and as long as I'm having fun with it I consider it a better alternative to spending (*as much of*) that money on alcohol/pot/etc...
---
\*\*whispers\*\* *^(Don't tell anyone at Bethesda but while I've cancelled my auto-renewal, I'm going to sign back up for it shortly after the beginning of December (most likely) since I get paid once a month and would rather have it taken out at the beginning of the month instead of the end.  But as far as they know I'm totally making a stand and not renewing it.)*
---
Something, something, FEV grants immunity. IDK
---
Bring on Them Battle Cattles boys. yeeeeehaaa.
---
They haven't decided how many atoms to charge for it yet
---
Sarcasm aside that's a good point.
---
Had the same thing happen to me and my 2 buddies.  we were all"WTF!!", then they started to respawn normally. The bug seems to be the initial spawn , but after the usual reset the mobs come back normally as you'd expect.  It's the usual fuck up sort a thing they do.
---
They better offer some better handies and ball play if they expect people to keep renewing the First membership.
---
She took to long, you get 5 minutes to get back into the server if you get disconnected. That limit applies to people trying to reset as well.
---
Sorry to hear she lost the nuke.
---
Then it could have just been an aol style chat room if the quality of the game doesn’t matter.
---
At least then it would have worked more than half the time.
---
Only clown we see is you. Go to the Filthy Casuals daycare with the other simps.
---
That would be fun, I might have flew off the handle a little, Sorry if l was too uncivil, But l enjoyed the game, It's not often you get a multiplayer open world rpg lol
---
"16 times the detail"
---
smdh
---
I haven’t played since nuclear winter, that was this summer, i didn’t play for a few months; not 5 years. The whole point of events like double xp weekends is to get people to play, which is why i decided to try the game again today. If that idea really is absurd to you, feel free to check my Reddit history. I know for a fact i have a post about 76 at launch and how it’s running better than the beta, I’m sure there are comments you can find as well.
---
I don’t know what to tell you about all the bugs i described happening at one time. That’s what happened, i gain nothing from lying. That’s why i Don’t understand the “anti shill” (i guess?) accusation. If people were seriously hiring people to spread negative news and opinion, a single person posting something on Reddit with no one else aiding the post would not be the way to go about it. 
---
Now aside from me and this post... not to be rude but the idea that rockstar had a negative marketing campaign against fallout 76 to help rdr2’s sales is just an absurd idea. I don’t even know how to tackle it.
---
While I’ve personally not played the game i can only assume the glowing reviews were because it was generally considered a good game. They aren’t even direct competition. Rdr2 is a single player third person shooter western. Fallout 76 is a multiplayer post apocalyptic first person shooter/rpg with survival elements. Is any game that gets good reviews while another that releases at a similar time and gets bad reviews a case of a negative marketing campaign? Again that idea is just absurd.
---
My secondary toon has one. I run batteries included 3 for weight reduction, and power user 2/3 for the additional ammo per core. If you can keep up with the flux needs, prime is the way to go. Buy up cheap, nearly empty cores from player vending, and run ammosmith + super duper: 2 depleted cores become 3 full ultracite cores, possibly 4 if SD procs.
---
Is that really true it for items and how do I make the enemies scale to my level
---
It was the day she got it, just testing out the server cause we heard different things about how they worked. Someone mentioned that they weren’t the same servers and I told her to nuke a certain pointless area, leaving and joining back to see if it was the same. I remember it being decently quick but it may have taken her longer to load back in or something. I’ve thought about trying it out for a month but I’d like to know a bit more about the private servers before I do (Mainly a solo player unless one of the two FO76 friends I have are online, the only one that has 1st works hospital nights so not too often).
---
all our arguing in the other thread aside I am curious if a nuka cola grenade would clip through a tree. the spawn at monongah powerplant sometimes appear inside the concrete walls. I know nuka grenades will go through those. At dolly sods I had a dog get stuck under the dirt however and the nuka grenades would not kill it.
---
The smaller footprint I agree with.  I do not agree with prioritizing camps over tents though.  First come first serve is a good compromise and has worked so far in Fallout 76.  If they can add a warning when you join for both camps and tents you can decide if you want to keep searching servers or just deal with it for the session.
---
Once you begin to prioritize things like this you start drawing lines in the sand which will cause a divide in your player base.  "Why is your camp more important than my tent?!  Rabble rabble rabble rabble!  Dey took er campin lercation!  Raaaaable rabble rabble rabble!"  Fallout 1st was a much more drastic line in the sand but any prioritization can snowball to unexpected levels.
---
Hell, I've only posted on Reddit like 10 times.  I don't even know why I posted on this one.  Honestly don't feel that strongly about this issue the more I think about it because I truly don't think it would impact me much (if at all) in either case..  So I guess take all this feedback with that in mind ;)
---
Iv won many of games after my teammates try to run and gun early game and I’m here sneaking around behind the last 2 people waiting for them to drop their gaurd and open up a crate boom down one then wait for the other to revive boom lol
---
Are you really surprised though?
---
Actually, you can get them at 17500 at less than 20 chr.  
---
I'm at 3.  +1 for armour piece.  +5 for Grape Mentats.  +2 for bobblehead. +1 for alchohol.   So at about 12 chr you hit the minimum price they will sell them for. 
---
One tip, make sure that you have used up your daily cap limit for the day before buying them.  The vendor will completely refill the limit after you buy it and you can get another 1400 caps by selling stuff back to the vendor.
---
What. They only made that change for PC? I thought they did it for all platforms.
---
Do you also not have a Depth of Field toggle too?
---
Better than launch (but that's not really saying much) but worse than at its peak.
---
Yes, please
---
just empty the shops, or delete the wire powering your shops.
---
Yep, because there’s nothing as fun as cutting a wire, then rewriting my walls to try to place that wire again, or trying to relist 120 items at exact prices. That’s definitely fun and in no way an annoyance when there is a simple solution, but glitches and all around shoddy work prevent that from being viable
---
Yeah, you're right, a little challenge must remain.
---
&gt;The company that strived to improve a universally hated game 
---
Let's not try to whitewash history. 
---
Bethesda is the company that launched an incomplete game far too early against the advice from their own community and have spent most of the time since then having to recover not only from that mistake but for every unforced error since then.
---
I think 5-10 mins away from your private server resets it also heard grabbing a certain amount of items like junk resets it after awhile even when there’s theories
---
Nice! Wil defenitly switch to brahmin milk. This works with most things tho, I do this all the time with my cooked meat.
---
No, it needs farming
---
They do, theyre max level is 35 though. So unless your rolling for them at the purveyor with a lower level character, your odds of getting one are slim. The only place you can find spawns that low consistently is uranium fever
---
Why don't you place a connection to the outside of the wall and then to the vendors. I understand that you've done some of the tricks that would make that difficult to rewire. It's a pretty simple solution though.
---
Remove door put in a solid wall
---
OK, thank you.
---
You posted during a time of day that is notorious for heavily downvoting almost any post, without rhyme or reason.
---
But sure, if it makes you feel better, it's the shills.
---
Can this joined the pinned posts along with the method to refund the game?
---
It is but it shouldn’t be the only way. The walls are covered with shit and a rewire would end up forcing most of it off just to allow it to pass from one point to the next. Literally anything that sticks out further than a connector will block the wiring. I’m sick and tired of starting to get into it just for the game to either break or someone else to break the game to try and annoy me. I play this game to relax but I swear I want to fucking kill myself over the shit I’ve experienced in this game at times. I’m sick and tired of having to ask for basic functionality in a fucking year old game
---
And that helps how? Unless the player could only glitch in through the doorway, then how will a solid wall prevent a player from getting in when a locked door can’t?
---
Not sure why this got downvoted It really isn’t that hard to believe at this point
---
Because this sub is full of Bethesda shills. Even though Bethesa keeps spitting in out faces they keep supporting them for some reason. Must be skme form of Stockholm Syndrome or cuckoldry, idk.
---
Doors can be picked. Solid wall with no doors or windows can’t.  How I have to shut up my shop. People like to pick locks.  And it’s easy to swap out to reopen your shop when needed just put same piece with door back on
---
When doors are picked the door becomes unlocked and the player is wanted. Neither of those happened. I understand fundamental game mechanics, not the fundamental game physics
---
Yup, they should have fixed both. This one is still a bother.
---
$5 from the atomic shop. You know it, I know it. Stop giving them ideas they'll just sell back to us.
---
Assuming DLC is ever released... The cake is a lie.
---
I am not sure where the 5 years popped into my mind from. I am trying to stay awake at 3 am at work and I am tired. apologies. 
---
Any of those bugs could have happened but all at once is something I haven't seen the whole time I have been playing. if you are telling the truth I just don't believe it. 
---
If you are in fact an antishill (lol yeah we will stick with that it just works.;P) then you wouldnt be a single person posting you would be one of several accounts spreading negative imagery in order to dissuade potential new buyers from considering the product. 
---
I am not accusing rock star I have no proof . but the idea is far from absurd. consider how long most players play a game when they get hooked during the initial game play. I myself have a year of nothing but fallout 76. I have not spent a dime on other games. by the time I grow bored with 76 RD2 will be far far beyond being a sellable product to me. an out dated old game. by losing me just one customer to 76 rockstar is missing out on my subscription fee and the occassional atom shop buys I make not just for this past year but most likely for the marketable life of RD2 I will most likely be playing this single game for years to come. now multiply me times 100000 other players. thats a shit ton of money rockstar is losing out on sales. a negative ad campaign to dissuade even a few thousand would be worth the effort. 
---
because gamers are such addictive odd creatures the pool of customers is fairly small which means EVERY new release game is in direct competition for a small pool of customers regardless of genre. I am not saying any games that get bad reviews are being targeted by a negative marketting campaign. I am saying judging from my own experiences with 76 every review I have seen out about the game have been largely misleading. they paint a picture that just logging into the game is just hell and there is nothing good about it at all. thats just not true. yep the bugs are there. nope not nearly as bad as its made out to be. 
---
If you can imagine a coropration hiring shills to boost their market value
---
you have to acknowledge that hiring antishills to attack competition to lower theirs would also make sense.
---
 https://www.ign.com/wikis/red-dead-redemption-2/Known_Glitches_and_Bugs if you exercise any  intellectual integrity you have to at least have a little suspicion that despite having bugs the volume of hate for RD2 was almsot completely absent while every one was just  bagging the shit out of 76.
---
Theres honestly no point in trying to argue with him, he automatically assumes the worst of people, and that anyone saying something could go wrong with the game are immediately liars. It wouldn't matter if you had proof, since the second your post didn't hype up the game to be better than it actually was, his mind was made up, and for some reason he feels like he has to drag others down to whatever petty level he's on.
---
Yeaah and there are also the mutant hounds, the Grafton Monster and the Snallygaster that can go scorched. Maybe mutants kill those that become Scorched as soon as they realize it, but just cant kill some of them: The hounds because they run too fast, the Behemoths because they are too strong, and the Snallygasters and Grafton Monster because they don't care.
---
You thought the game is perfect when you bought fallout 1st? Oh man
---
No
---
Look in the mirror champ
---
A few months ago I would have believed you, now I know that player QA testers get banned :(
---
Its a bug, relog to reset spawn
---
They don’t exist. There were some players that were trying to do a good thing by providing Bethesda with free QA labour, but they were promptly banned after testing and reporting some bugs and then ignored even after making a big post about it.
---
Ehm, no? Remember invisible npcs, just to mention one.
---
no no only exploiters who get caught then claim to be qa testing. even though they don't work for the company. lets not get it twisted. map maker was hacking he got caught because his friend reported him. you cant spin this into beth being assholes. that was the mapmaker being a douche. the fact that he had a nice map site is completely irrelevent. I cha;lenge you Dareal to go use the same logic at any nearby bank. please go test their security right now then tell them you were just trying to help improve it when they catch you. go apply your "logic" please I am begging you go help a local bank improve their security.
---
I farmed nuked whitespring by relogging after I’ve done done one lap clearing the area. Worked all the time
---
They're used to make Super Stims
---
A few patches ago it required the pin and then I think they changed it so the owner doesn't need the pin and I suppose it's bugged.
---
Yeah will do man
---
idk how people can hide the WHOLE match. It's not possible...with all the hackers...and the lack of good hiding spots...trust me...I know. The first map was so much better for hiding.
---
The reason I don't solo is because it just adds 3 more people out to kill me. No thanks.
---
and a lot of this shit in the vault 94
---
&gt; For example, if I see someone snorting white powder in public, it  doesn’t mean they are necessarily doing cocaine - it could be some  really good powdered sugar. However, if this behavior is a disturbance  to the public, they can be removed from the area. 
---
He didn't get a "thing he didn't know" from a "random person"  
---
He got "cocaine" (cheat engine) from a "pusher"(forum or place specialized in such) and did "try it"(experimented with it for literally 12 hours as his own self admission). 
---
If a policeman is seeing you used cocaine, it doesn't matter whether you reported the pusher. You used cocaine.
---
the people who think 76 is dead forever are morons. 
---
of course wastelanders will change a lot of things. some for the worst I imagine hopefully for the best over all I hope. 
---
I disagree with your opinion about the "real 76" beginning with wastelanders. the "real" 76 started on launch day a year ago. 
---
of course we have to wait and see. 
---
no one but a sub section of this subsection is doom and gloom about the fate of 76. as a long time player who actually plays the game things have been more way more active since fallout first got released. nukes droppin like crazy. crowded servers. so many new faces and young players. the astroturf campaign to undermine 76 is failing miserably.
---
Please read what I said.
---
If you report someone using an exploit to enter a bank account, and used that exploit yourself, the bank obviously can't trust you didn't take anything or sold it to anyone.  
---
He tried that exploit for a lot of time, as his own self-admission, instead of just reporting it. So there are traces he used that, and in a world where the worst serial killers can fit in the general populace and have a really positive image, they obviously can't trust he didn't sell it to no one and didn't use it as a cheat engine and not to experiment.
---
Thank you for commenting.  I was always interested in finding out.
---
Could you please elaborate...  if 2 pieces are equipped, would they both activate when HP threshold is passed? or so they activate one at a time?
---
For example, if you HP were taken down to 10% by a hit - proccing autostim.  The HP may take 1-2 second to reach 20%+.  Would the 2nd autostim activate during this time ?
---
Why Runescape? I‘ve never played it but i remember people only praising it in the past.
---
yup cashed in 100 scrip the other day and got one of them. was trying for a new rifle for the wife but got nothing but poop weapons.
---
Or whether or not it should be a fallout 1st exclusive.
---
crap I meant to test this serndipity in PA thing and forgot
---
needs more lasers... jk :P
---
I moved my CAMP from The Forest to the Savage Divide and it did make a difference in what I got back.. Way more scrap now than before
---
It could depend on location as well - i moved from just south of summersville to around Site Alpha and now quite quickly get tonnes of scrap
---
Alright! Big thank you for this! I also played in Beta but had like a year break from the game. Returning now and trying to figure out how things have changed.
---
The super basic gist of it is that tones of people get banned and they don't even bother to try to help unless they are a streamer with tonnes of followers.
---
So they just ban their playerbase for no reason? Seems like the game is coming to an end after all these years. Thanks for the answer.
---
Vault 94, open vault door, in the security room is a caps stash, pick up, leave vault, re-enter vault, pick up stash. 
---
Just rinse and repeat
---
I hardly think bringing awareness to an issue publically is farming for internet points.
---
Which one are you referring to?
---
Especially if the latest leaks about fallout first are true
---
The guy who makes a video every day to trash Bethesda
---
Agreed
---
It was the company that launched with display name in game = account name. 
---
Lack of 2fa just gets added on top. Kinda doesn't invite spending money on the game.
---
Crap stranding? 
---
I bet you didn't even play it yourself.
---
I don’t know who you’re talking about but Bethesda deserves to be trashed. Hell we should be the ones suing them. They’ve done all sorts of horrible things. I paid $23 for a month of the sub only to have all my junk deleted, which still hasn’t been replaced.
---
nexus was way over hyped for fallout 4 in my opinion. the modders broke as much as they fixed.
---
Yes you've wasted your money. And hopefully you don't get banned for reporting the bug 😂
---
It's popular to make Fallout 76 hate videos. All for the views.
---
Visually didn't look half bad when Todd was emphasizing x16 the detail...  
---
...untill you realize that almost everything was reclycled Fallout 4 textures that were low-res to begin with...
---
This was their fix to the friend list bug that existed for months. The request can now be accepted, but get hidden. Sometimes, if you remove some random friend, it will reload the list and show the hidden requests. But not always. Restarting the game does not make the hidden ones show again. The removal of a friend is currently the only workaround, and it is not 100% effective.
---
Quit while you only wasted an hour of your life, don't waste any more seconds on this garbage and do something productive with your life.
---
I think he is more trashing the fact that Bethesda have shot themselves in the foot every chance they get.
---
Just to be sure - you are crouching/sneaking when shooting? Because that’s the whole thing.
---
I’ve never seen these videos, but in any case, a company can’t be defamed, only a person can be. Making videos about a company is free speech.
---
instancing again!
---
Somebody had been through there before you.
---
That shouldn't be happening. I a locked door that I, or teammates, can open without removing the lock. Goes back to locked after I close it...sounds like a bug.
---
I lost a complete unyielding armor set together with under-armor about a week ago after a crash. Bethesda support said "tough luck" so it's still common.
---
However you want to word it, he cheated and got banned, there is nothing to defend here. He is not a Bethesda employee or associated with Bethesda, he is a normal player like everyone else. 
---
He can get his subscription canceled at any time but not refunded.
---
Thanks guys, seems like you are playing a completely different game! .. I might give it a try, keep your eyes peeled for a corpse named chridsmith appearing near you soon
---
In third person, maintain the touchpad and push down with your left stick. You need to stay still while doing this.
---
Yeah... This shouldn't be necessary. Period. It's reasonable to be pissed, so don't downplay it.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
Yeah, that's definitely a bug I'm afraid. A locked door is only locked for others, not the owner of the camp.
---
Hmm interesting, will try again next time Im on
---
Not to hate on the company, but if they continue their current trend wastelanders will probably be good but they will likely do something stupid and cause another controversy.
---
"I knew the world didn’t have much depth but as socially awkward as everyone was I still enjoyed the interactions with the people I had met." the world has a ton of enviromental story telling and  some pretty in depth lore. you have to find the holotapes and notes to find it. it doesnt hold your hand . 
---
"I had already heard about all the bad things Bethesda has done to this game" yeah funny how everyone brings that up but never addresses all the good stuff. the list of improvements and new features is incredibly long. most of the peeps trash talking the game don't even play it. 
---
"but I believed I could still have fun with it despite Bethesda’s behavior but I was wrong. "If you cant find ways to have fun in the  bethesda has nothing to do with it. I have played since beta for many many hours and still enjoy the enviroment and gameplay. 
---
"When wastelanders was delayed it felt like a punch in the gut" why? for all the broken promises crap the naysayers keep bitching about the fact of the matter is its an online game. by default the gameplay experience will vary. thats what onlines game do . they change. they made a plan, the ran into crap they didnt forsee, they changed the plan. 
---
 "not to mention the notorious fallout first that had been Bethesda’s way of spitting on their community. " no most of the players like it. just a loud vocal and obnoxious part of this community didnt like the fallout first. in the actual game. where I actually play, I see tons of scrap boxes and protectrons and survival camps. that whole "class war" bullshit is played out and it never even happened. all just drama queens and astroturfers being morons. 
---
"So now like a lot of other people I’m in a sort of limbo state where seeing the potential for this game makes me hopeful for the future of this game but it also makes me dread how Bethesda is going to mess it up." 
---
guide to overcoming the dread of bethesda fucking up your game. 
---
1. go to every youtuber youre subscribed to. look at all their videos, if they all talk shit about every single game and are mostly negative. hit that big old unsubscribe button. they're morons, they know hate and negativity gets more attention than good articles and specifically trash games to get views. they are NOT gamers they are video producers. their opinions dont matter they never play anything to actually know what the fuck they're talking about. might as well take legal advice from brittany spears. 
---
2. log out of this sub reddit and go play the damn game.
---
Never seen two go off at once, can’t say for certain though
---
When you’re hp is that low, tend to be paying attention elsewhere, lol
---
Ok )
---
Thank you for the info.  I will do some experimenting
---
Poor Biv xD
---
Players are going to run around and try to exploit this game. Some of us enjoy experimenting with game mechanics and finding holes. If Beth takes a hard black and white stand on it, it is not going to stop people from looking for exploits, hackers are going to hack. Beth not supporting them is only going to stop them from reporting what they find, at least to Beth, but it will not stop them from doing it.
---
You get more rewards for nuking Scorchbeast queen.
---
You call it an opinion but it sounds like a wish because little of what you've said is predicated on facts or evidence.
---
The real Fallout 76 started when the real Fallout 76 launched over a year ago.
---
What makes you think many other updates will come in 2020? Very little has been said about 2020 updates and the 76 devs have a track record of constantly delaying or not at all delivering on what they'd committed to e.g. they delivered slightly over half of what was promised in their 2019 roadmap.
---
"The fallout brand will not end like this" you say. I hope that is the case but the track record is a downward slide since Fallout 4. It's just wishful thinking on my part, much like your whole post.
---
I’m sure they have had to test that bans work so I imagine some employees were banned while testing their ban mechanisms
---
Fast travel xD
---
Bad post
---
That's because solo isn't solo, it's just recycled empty servers that are in whatever state they are in.
---
This! There was a cut event.
---
It was at that moment u/SmileCharms knew... they fucked up
---
Yes. I did this a week ago. You drop one pick it up fast travel will que the quest turn in. Than server hop. Repeat till all turned in.
---
I got today a junkies explosive rw fixer and a bloodied explosive lever but lost my scrap
---
I'll be curious to see if you get a lower upvote percentage when brought up the idea of shutting down the servers like it worked out for Final Fantasy XIV.
---
The target is 9%.
---
Well that’s what happens when one pays for first knowing Bethesda is lying and breaking promises for a profit here. This is why people needed to not buy first, but guess what a bunch of people did lol.
---
The F.E.V. they’re evolved from is a virus based on the Pan Immunity Virion Project, ergo they’re immune to everything, which includes the scorched infection
---
My instigating fixer kills almost all whit one shot
---
I think you have missed my statement, It's not them rising up, It's them sitting down, Improving a game plagued by bugs, I think you may have misread what l said lol, And I'm not trying to "Whitewash" anything. I hate many of their games, I liked Fallout 76 because it was fun, You're right, It was released too early, but it is an enjoyable experience, Travelling the wastelands with friends and backing each-other up with better weapons, It's a game of grinding, and trial and error. I like that, You're allowed to have your own opinion, but you're fundamentally misunderstanding mine, It's an interesting take, And one I'll look more into, But l did enjoy it, And that's really all l was intending to say... Thanks!
---
what do we do now? we exist, we keep surviving, we make our own fun as always. I have been playing since beta and I still dont have enough time in my life to do everything thats on my plate in the game currently. Turner my man its this simple if you are bored grinding the same locations...dont. there are spots to go to get optimal gears screws and springs. but if you are bored because you always go there. just dont. try alternate methods. look for different places. 
---
if you are bored nuking the queen - dont - I got burnt out on nuke launching for awhile - decided to try selling nuke launch codes for income instead. worked out pretty damn good actually. so I stuck them on my vendor for 100 caps a peice and when peeps bought them often they would go do the silo right away. so basically I would get 100 caps for the card and then get a queen kill without ever touching the silo. which was the part I was burnt out on at the time.  the quests for summoning the cargo bot with the codes respawns every 15 minutes. so I began to look for ways to pad that activity. 
---
I adjusted my build to add bobble head finder magazine finder and treasure finder. when I went to shoot down the drones and get the cards I would explore the places around the kill site. I found ALOT of mags and bobs that werent even on the interactive maps. I saw places I hadnt even seen before. every scenerio was a bit random and I converted my general purpose vendors into a bobs n mags vendor.the mags n bobs bit failed...horribly. the only way to sell the crap was to price it very low. BUT I wasnt bored. the magazne stands looked great for awhile. 
---
so I after I ran the magazine / bobs store I decided to move and try to maximize water farming. that was fairly lucrative after a couple weeks of that I changed again.
---
Now I run a pharmaceuticals store. mostly healing stuff and chems but I am also making serums. thats lucrative as fuck. at a minimum if you get over stocked you can distribute them to your alts and really stream line getting all cap stash limit on all 5 characters. currently I could barely play for 2 days and only log in to sell and get cap stash limit on all characters in less than 20 minutes just by selling whats already in their inventory. 
---
to make the serums I am back to killing the queen. I dont care about legendaries much and sell them all on my vendor. I dont even scrip them. my current goal is to unlock the rest of all the mutation serums and have one of everything all the time on my vendor for 400 caps each. I love those type shops when i play alts. now I will have one. 
---
now if and when I ever get bored with that I have an Idea for a deployable "airship" with turrets for shop defense. I think I could make it look cool. I am saving up scrap and the next time I am in a "buildy" mood and I am bored with pharma farming I will try out some ideas in that department.,
---
Yeah, it's just about finding the right server lol
---
I got disconnect  when we almost kill the queen. Down vote for Bethesda

---
Keeping discussion open and fair is a key principle to hold onto regardless of one's stance on the game/company.
---
I have no issue with Nuclear Winter getting more game modes to spice it up, I personally would like to see a manhunt and team deathmatch come to it but I want to see Wastelanders become the best standard of this game first
---
I could imagine biv asking us to get the local ghouls/scorched/super mutants drunk so that he has a larger sample size to test some new beverages on.
---
In before some fanboy with more money than sense disagrees. They haven't listened for years.
---
dude that is a false narrative. they banned a guy who was exploiting and got screwed over when his friend reported him. his defense was "I was trying to help" NO he was exploiting period. go try and help your local bank by breaking into it. go ahead apply the logic this narrative expects you to beleive. and no I dont give a shit if the guy made a map. he was exploiting pure and simple he just got caught.
---
I ended up getting 100% after like six tries and it still said I failed
---
I guess if your aren’t into collecting or classic RPGs, you won’t want to replay outer worlds. But being able to roll new different builds has been very satisfying on replay; and everyone responds different to every little thing. I haven’t found a bug yet.
---
The server only creates a new instance when there is not an empty one available that's how the crappy private instances work...I mean even GTAV Online private instances are fired up fresh when you create it and that's free.
---
It’s a photoshopped image, and the wiki even states all variations of the super mutant in the game from data mining.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Huntersville_super_mutant
---
Simple solution: log out ... log back in ... all mobs respawn 
---
You can do this multiple times
---
Been mentioned many time on this subreddit
---
Any idea what the damage threshold is?
---
Remember all the hype about the burrows? Know anyone who goes into the burrows? Wastelanders might be a larger dlc, but is made by the same people who thought the burrows would make the game better.
---
Nope. They are impacting my social media sites. Not this sub. What goes on in this sub is pure marketing. People getting paid to both praise and shit on the game. Derp.
---
Fo76 is not dead, have a strong player base and you can be sure that if they don’t mess up wastelanders big time, there will be even more active players
---
Have you copy pasted a link to someone from your launcher? If so they might’ve gotten into your account that way and messed with your account
---
Does starsiege tribes not count? People are STILL playing that game.
---
Enemies do respawn, you know.  And relatively quickly, at that.  lol
---
Remember when people on this sub were saying that there was no way this was going to happen?
---
What you mean the update that finally let me farm fusion cores in peace for my PVE weapon on my PVE character without having to be gutted like a lamb at slaughter for the amusement of PVP douche bags? that horrible patch? 
---
the horrible patch that gave me unlimited junk storage? that saves me from the hell of micromanaging 20 stacks of junk every 20 minutes? peeps think its pay to win because its unlimited storage. no. its pay to win because I never have to press R slide the bar left and confirm a drop 20 times in a row. thats the super power of the junk box. its easy to get 100 of every thing with regular stash and no one really needs more than that except maybe lead and steel. like glass for example, you cant sell it unless you bulk it, no one needs 800 glass. but I have 800 glass. and I never have to go through the bullshit of sliding that stupid bar to drop it again. fuck yes. pay to win powers activate! is that the horrible patch you're talking about? 
---
oh no wait you mean the horrible patch that lets me plop down a badass little tent anywhere on the map as a secondary survival camp. rest bonus junk storage all that jazz, That horrible patch? 
---
the only people who didnt like the subscription update  were  broke entitled players demanding free shit that beth doesnt need as a customer anyway. I am great with giving beth sub money, I am great if they lose a large portion of their free to play whine and bitch community. goodbye good sirs don't let the gold plated door hit you in the ass on the way out o/ come back when you got some money and we can do some bizness.
---
They do not have QA testers. They may have employees with titles that say QA tester in them, but they are blatantly unqualified if they do. 2 of the past few updates were rolled back during the update because they found that their fixes didn't actually work (PA fix and recent exploit fix). This indicates the only testing they have takes place during the 5 hr update deployment window, which is why it takes 5 hours in the first place.
---
I'll be laughing! With joy and excitement over wastelanders which I don't believe will suck
---
1 set since beta ? I would consider that fucked up. but rare not common. 1 set per week I would consider common.
---
“My computer is hot garbage”
---
“This game is trash”
---
Or... Fo76 had been dying for a while, has a weaker player base than it did and you can be pretty sure they'll mess up Wasterlanders, given the multitude of previous fuck ups, so even though some players will come back to check it out, many won't and the game will continue its sad decline.
---
Ultracite variants of the laser gun and gatling laser do not have any passive damage bonus against scorched. Ultracite gatling laser does a flat 10% more against everything. The ultracite laser gun has a higher firerate but lower dmg per hit and actually ends up doing less DPS...
---
Awww. Add me and I’ll help you. I’m level 150+ PSN: experimenta_l
---
Why the Anti-Brazilian hate?  Was it a global thing or just South American rivalry, or just a weird meme like situation where people don’t even know why they did it?
---
I disagree, I think l'll delete this thread now, people are starting to get hostile, And thats not what l'm into, So thanks for you're opinion, But they tried, And l like the game, And that's really it.
---
Don't feel bad. Yesterday I was in the middle of a chaotic SB fight in the mire and I saw this van so I took cover. An excellent tactic I might add, right up until I realized I was not alone in the van rofl. (About 2 seconds hehe) I survived but it was definitely one of those "OK this game is cool" moments.
---
All the time. Sometimes I am not doing anything at all like just walking from one map marker to another with no encounters going off at all.
---
I need to find the picture I snapped before I crashed.. it appeared to be a scorchbeast corpse glitched out in the sky around Welch. It was rapidly turning and spinning and I was like that ain't right and snapped a pic, moments later crashed to desktop. Saw the same in the Mire with one caught in a tree but had no time to take a picture on that one. Will find that other in Welch and post today if anyone thinks that would be helpful somehow.
---
I'll address my point but for the moment, why you do keep misspelling Bethesda as Bathesda?
---
I agree with you that people need to trust bathesda. The problem however, is that said players potentially detect a bug (which is fine), but instead of reporting it, they went on to actually try and trigger it.  
---
The problem is certainly not that they want to help - any help this game could get would be appreciated, but that instead of reporting bugs, so that bathesda could test it on a seperate environment, they decided they had to "make sure".  
---
But why they would even want to do this is beyond me. It's free to report a bug, and "making sure" won't make bathesda fix it any sooner. They won't even take your word anyway, because they don't know who you are, they will test it themselves anyway. More than that, bathesda actually has diagnostic tools and access to the game's logs, so they can more easily test it than us.
---
I did not know that. I'll have to remember it if I start another character, thanks.
---
&gt;But they tried
---
Good to see that you're being a little more factual now. 
---
They tried. No reasonable person would argue against that. They just didn't try very hard to make a good game, as you tried to claim.
---
MUHAHAHAHAHAHA YOU THINK THIS SUBREDDIT IS ACTUALLY IMPORTANT HAHAHAHAHA. 
---
this is only a very small portion of the actual 76 gaming community. I read one dude said it was estimated to be 10% or less. reddits competitors are people like face book, discord, etc. the reddit forums in general have a reputation of being cunts. so the vast majority of the internet population at large avoid them like the plague. I am only here because I am at work and cannot be playing. I would never even bother with this except for the fact I cant watch stuff in an office space an this is the only 76 related outlet to pass time at work I have. 
---
the rest of the player base is happily chugging along happily playing the game. they dont even have a reddit account. out of this sub reddit most of the poster here like the game, I would say the pop is split about 70 30 like to dislike ratio. 
---
and obviously you dont understand what a patch note is dont worry papa g is gonna teach so have a seat little billy and listen. 
---
this is a copy of one of many "patch" notes. devs put them out to tell us what they did to make the game better. 
---
its called a "hot fix" 
---
# FALLOUT 76: HOTFIX NOTES – NOVEMBER 14, 2019

---
 See billy they do fix their game. over time sometimes small fast fixes sometimes big ones. to see what they do you have to go read the patch notes. and remember little billy its a sin to tell a lie.
---
...... Got to move my camp now haven't I!!
---
There's one in a bedroom upstairs in a building in Helvita. It's on a small shelf to the left after waking through the door to the bedroom. There's also one in one of the cabins next to the New River Gorge bridge. I don't remember which one though.
---
Well, I get you mate, but "enjoying experimenting with the game" might seriously damage it, without you even realizing it. It's not a game you run on your local machine so you can try and hack it, it's an online game, with everyone being dependant on the servers.  
---
Bathesda cannot allow you to "have fun" hacking an online game.
---
And if people are going to hack it "anyway", they should all be banned like cheaters are supposed to be.
---
All you have to do is leave and immediately re join and if will put you back on your same server and everything will spawn.
---
Well, first of all, the analogy of hacking the game to help, is very much valid. You, rightly, claim that hacking a game is not equivilant to shooting someone. But you fail to see that, also being banned is not equivilant to jail time. 
---
Had I claimed - "Hacking a game is just like shooting", the comparsion would have, indeed, been flawed. However, the analogy is centered around "trying to be a vigilante", NOT around comparing video games and death. You simply are reading it wrong.
---
Further more - you claim that denying players hacking the game is:
---
"fundamentally an unreasonable expectation for an open-world sandbox game"
---
Please read the game's terms and conditions to understand why it's wrong.
---
What may seem unreasonable to you is clearly a violation of rules. You say my arguments are weak, but base your whole argument on hacking a game being "reasonable".
---
All the time when I'm dropping nukes man.
---
2 "Any charge" Fusion Cores, with 1 Violet Flux will give 2 100% Ultracite Fusion Cores (3 with lvl2 Ammo Perk), then add in Super Duper.
---
With INT 23, my Ultracite FC's are coming in with 120% Charge. Add in Power User lvl 3, then you're getting 1200 shots per 120% core, rather than the normal 500 from an un-power user 100% Core.
---
So without Perks, you'll get 1000 shots.
---
With the High INT and perks it will be 3600 shots.
---
I’m with you. Doesn’t matter if you don’t play anymore, you might want to return for Wastelanders or for another reason.  The point is if you’re banned you can’t and who buys a game knowing they can only play once.
---
Literally just crashed on me after I launched a nuke, just before I finished off the queen and didn't make it back in time to get any rewards from her.
---
You seem to be forgetting about private servers. They cannot stop you from having fun hacking the game. They can only ban you if they know what you are doing. They will only know what you are doing if you tell them. This only prevents people from reporting exploits, not doing them. I know of at least 30+ major exploits, and how to perform them, actively being used in this game. I have tested them, and will not report them because Bethesda does not know about them currently. The second I report them, they will, and I will probably get the accounts that I used to test them banned. So what incentive do I have to report them? None.
---
Oh I know about that as I wore that in F4 and saw it on the shop, is it still there?
---
Same here but no one is there
---
I think they’ve taken it off but it’ll be back at some point.
---
This would be Sisyphean
---
Nope, they're relatively new to the legendary list. And quad explosive is a very good roll.
---
My farm takes up like 30-40% of my budget as I constantly farm adhesive with corn, tatos, and mutfruit.
---
He nuked, don't the enemies die by the nuke itself. In public worlds other players often reset the enemies which won't happen in a solo private world.
---
I've had late loot spawns and when I kill enemies, there is a 1-5 second delay of my round connecting to their skulls.
---
Omfg yessss, that happened to me too
---
Ah damn any other dark clothing?
---
Most people maybe but I have a job, a family, Bill's and responsibilities so I do know the cost of gaming and no i don't begrudge profits as it's the business but atom shop bullshit is something that has appeared in games recently and that is the part where i see them as greedy as with repair kits and botched menu systems that force you to use it or the belief a game should be completely, yes bugs are bugs, useable from day one and not have the same bugs that have existed since they first used this janky engine , bugs from oblivion and skyrim as well as fallout 3 and 4. The same things we have winged about since beta here. But it's a service so it should be fixed and made right like the canvas bags (laugh) but it isn't. That's why Australians are getting refunds that you can't elsewhere because of their consumer protections against fraudulent products like this.
---
Where abouts can I get that?
---
What platform you on mate?
---
I like all rise super sledge from mayor for a day, always did well,I loaded up on 2 handed melee peeks also.
---
Depends on like 5 diff factors | vendors
---
There are a lot of variables. I know a bloodied build would deal amazing damage for any weapon if its bloodied. Stats on melee weapons matter along with builds. I know meat hooks have the highest amount of damage to deal in the game. I ran a fireaxe build for melee. For 2 handers... strive for getting a nice fire axe or bloodied sledge.
---
Ah, so you really are a bad faith actor? Understood. No need to continue discussing anything further.
---
yeah because typing in 3 words on google is hard...oh wait it really is for some people
---
Wait, it takes you an hour to go through a silo!? What level are you with what weapons
---
There's a difference with trying to make a profit and profiteering. 
---
Given that there are now 3 monetisation schemes for a game that Bethesda has done poorly in delivering even on what they themselves have said they'd commit to, it very much seems to be more the latter than the former.
---
DDOS
---
But you have to understand that they are managing their risks.
---
By permitting anyone to try and exploit the game, they are allowing for two things:
---
1. They are allowing potentially clueless, self crowned "data miners" to mess their game up legitimately.
---
2. They make it harder to distinguish between the good guys and the bad guys. Anyone who cheats could simply claim he did it for good after he got cought. And even if you report the bug before them catching you, how are you gonna proove you did it for the greater good? Maybe you just got scared and told them. Maybe not. One may be telling the truth, the other may be lying. There's no end to this, and Bethesda doesn't want to put themselves in that situation in the first place.
---
Looks good :)  👍👌
---
What kind of look are you going for?
---
What guilt? This isn't doing drugs or robbing banks. Its a video game, and these people were working with Fallout 76 community managers. Working with community managers essentially means they were greenlit by Bethesda for their activities, they were invited in, white hat hackers. The problem lies in the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing, the left hand being customer support and the right hand being the community managers.
---
Presumably the glitch hunters discard any of the things they receive by exploring glitches to find out how they function and reporting that to Bethesda. There is no injury.
---
If they were working with community managers and have evidence of such, they could actually take this to small claims court and demand a refund for breaking the contracts between the two parties. It just wouldn't be worth the time and effort unless they spend hundreds on atoms on the accounts they were using to hunt for bugs.
---
Me and another player actually won a match cause I hid the entire time.
---
You are assuming Bethesda would fix a bug sooner if it's tested. But it's simply not necessarily right.
---
By the way, I could argue that reporting the bug as early as possible is more helpful, since they will test it again anyway, and by the time you wasted testing it youself they would have gotten to it themselves anyway.
---
So, the right algorithm would be:
---
1. Report, blindly.
---
2. Test it to make sure.
---
3. Report again but with evidence.
---
Yeah, I know.
---
Are we talking quest rewards or random legendary drops?
---
So why not discuss further?
---
I got a 3*suppresors , reflect damage, +1 strength ripper 
---
I think it was from the purveyor but it’s only level 40
---
Yeah, you've been outted, Todd. Get the fuck outta here and fix the game!
---
So why ever report exploits. Exploits will remain in the game forever. How would Bethesda ever discover exploits being done on the servers? Besides the ones they know about, you think they have people combing through accounts looking for suspicious activity or just spying on random people playing the game in hopes of finding someone using exploits? You think they'll actually pay people to do that? There is a lot of training that would go into it, people looking for exploits would have to know what is actually possible in the game in the first place.
---
Having their players report bugs and exploits is waaaay cheaper. Except they are losing that because they are banning people for reporting exploits.
---
Why?
---
That's his claim and Bethesda has yet to actually deny that claim.
---
You nuked something and you're surprised everything there is dead...
---
/s sorry couldn't help myself 😄

Start from my first post in the comment chain here and try again. [First result is you.](https://i.imgur.com/Bem6K1w.png) You were seriously insulting other people's intelligence earlier? lmao
---
Halloween witch costume can be great if you've got good headwear to go with it.
---
How do you know Bethesda are not looking for bugs themselves? There could be thousands of bugs that got fixed you'll never hear about.
---
And still. You are not refering at all to my point that people could unintentionally damage the game.
---
I'm sure you're happy giving Bethesda money over a game that still shits itself into a crash with just a funny look.
---
Remember when they fixed that bug that causes Tesla Rifles to just break all your ranged damage until you reset? That was sure a pa- *oh wait that's been in the game since launch and has never been fixed*.
---
That depends on a lot of factors, your build, and the type of melee weapon you want to use.
---
Super Sledge, Blade of Bastet, Deathclaw Gauntlet are generally the best weapons from each category.
---
Legendary prefixes also are also a no-brainer. The first prefix most sought are Bloodied, Anti-Armour, Furious, Junkies And sometimes even Vampires. The secondary most sought prefixes are swing speed and limb damage and then the third are +1 Strength or reduced weight.
---
Oh come on. Give me a big fat break. That's his claim? Really? You expect me to take it for granted?
---
Bethesda doesn't have to justify a player's ban in front all the community as audience. If he was really in the right, he could at least make his conversation with Bethesda, where they allowed him to use cheat engines, public.
---
If he does, one day, consider me convinced that he's in the right. But until then Im going to assume he's just butt-hurt.
---
Responder Vendor-bot, rare chance to spawn and even rarer to find in his inventory
---
Tenderizer is only good at base level. 
---
Go LW 2 tenderizer 1
---
1) This is a proper interpretation of what the results of supporting this kind of player banning will end up being.
---
2) Bethesda is banning people who have been greenlit by Bethesda do this sort of thing. They didn't deny that the banned accounts in question were from people who were working with community managers. They just said if you do an exploit hundreds of times you'll get banned.
---
If Bethesda wants to convince anyone reasonable in this controversy, they would deny that the banned users had been working with the community managers to hunt for bugs. Or point out that these supposedly white hats were actually using the results of their bug hunts and not destroying the items.
---
Ok cheers
---
Yeah, I'm not a fan of the dress look lol
---
Black lol basically an outfit that's the opposite of what I used to wear which was the Arktos coat
---
How is that relevant to the discussion anyway?
---
I have already explained that searching for bugs by using hacking tools is what I clearly meant.
---
You are yet to counter it.
---
That’s rather awesome, I love a good go at home building
---
You should leave everything unlocked just in case. The junk bot, the resource collector and all that.
---
As a vendor, I never lock anything but just wondering what that guys "play" was
---
That will be $10
---
PS4
---
Probably in a Wastelanders part 2? “War Never Changes” where factions return
---
Actually, we first gotta assume Bethesda actually fixes bugs 😂😂😂
---
That aside, I'm just saying that reporting stuff without testing it will result in a flood of useless reports,which Bethesdas customer support likely won't be able to handle.
---
I have been to Whitespring after a Nuke and everything is dead.
---
I am just about to leave and cross paths with another gamer,or two and an army of bloated Ghouls   
---
suddenly appears. from Zero to 50 +.
---
Not sure why this sometimes happens
---
They go for like 3-4k but I have a spare, Add BOUJEEE-BILL when you get the chance. I'll sort you one for free
---
Ah, I see, cheers for the reply.
---
Oh that's really nice of you, mate, I can add you via the app and I'll be on in around 4 and a half hours as I'm at work currently
---
Haha, I guessed that much 😂 as far as long coats go there’s the drifter outfit, traveling leather coat &amp; leather coat. They’re all brown though. The hunters long coat which is a blue/black. 
---
In the atomic shop there was a stalkers outfit &amp; the shroud costume. 
---
 There’s the ranger outfit with FO1st &amp; there were a couple of limited outfits with atom bundles.
---
Probably go wanted, hit the guy until his electric charge mutation goes off or he fights back - now he is in PvP with them and they can destroy his camp.
---
Or you know you could think that bringing awareness to an issue in a game that is 99,9% an issues is a good thing for once. 
---
Geez.....
---
Cheers bud I'll have to have a look lol
---
If there's only non-first players in the private world when you jump out, they've got 20 minutes to do the same before the world shuts down. 
---
Logic suggests that this same timer applies when the world is empty as well as Bethesda is likely to just reuse the same timer.
---
No problem, drop me a message when your online :)
---
Will do, mate, thanks again :) I should have something you want in storage or Vendor lol
---
I removed some Squatters from Watoga.
---
Now the Quest Spawns every time i log in.Replacing The Buried with honor quest that once spawned.bwhaaaaaaa
---
To be fair it is different locations around Watoga.
---
Were they all dead?
---
Non PA: bloodied deathclaw gauntlet with extra claw is my favorite
---
PA: bloodied sledgehammer with emergency protocols on the PA. 
---
Replace prefixes with “instigating” if you go full health.
---
Removing the discussion from here will only move it elsewhere, and not only if the subreddit is closed it becomes one less avenue for fair discussion or holding Bethesda accountable
---
Funny how you’re getting downvoted. The strain with small additions to the servers is already bad.
---
Yes your nuke killed everything, as they do. But to get them to re spawn you need to leave your server then come back in, it will put you in the same private session. its so when players enter a new area there is less chance of everything being dead when they arrive.
---
Dumb idea is dumb
---
If the camp is not persisting, would you mind explaining what would happen If one of the group disconnects? Or just leaves? And I doubt that you are going to login/logout together the whole time.
---
I’m from America, but I’ve met Aussies, New Zealanders, and Canadians.
---
Bruh we just need all possible emotes and full VR tracking. It’s time to live in the wasteland.
---
Like Im saying this community is pure gold when
---
It comes to ideas
---
Khajit has coin if you have legendary...
---
Whoa calm down.  All you needed to do was log back in to your server.
---
always loved that location easily the best piece of flat land in the game.
---
I'm surprised after everything you've seen this year you had the genius idea of spending a bunch of money on this game.
---
Just wait until Bethesda starts selling support tickets in the Atom shop. Want a response? Gotta pay for it.
---
I don’t know if it’s of any help, but what I’ve been doing to work around this on private servers, even when solo is to leave, and right away go back to a private game. It’ll put you back in the same one and force respawns as if you are a new player.
---
Wouldn’t be of much help in non-private games though :/
---
The people who were banned used 3rd party software to find said bugs/exploits.
---
That sucks but thanks for highlighting the issue.  My team &amp; I have had good &amp; bad issues with private servers.  I think we’ve agreed to only nuke in public as we’re confident it benefits the chance of legendary spawns.
---
I’m not the most educated on this topic, but aren’t the executives also to blame here? I’m not sure if the bugs and glitches were the result of shitty developers or rushed development and short deadlines, but I know that this fallout first fiasco and the atom shop were executive decisions. Same with the canvas bag situation. Maybe even the four-times-the-size-of-fallout-4-but-everything-is-really-spread-out thing was an executive demand because it looks good in advertising. Now once again I could be completely wrong here, but if the executives are indeed the ones that screwed this game up, I think things are looking grim.
---
Youre clueless. Please actually read up on this. 
---
The CMs were in contact with the group and had no issue with them doing this and reporting it.
---
They had a direct line to the CMs to report.
---
The CMs were/are trying to get the group ynbanned but the support team, as always, are not allowing this to happen.
---
Please go read up on this.
---
I came here to look for reasons to pick it back up.
---
once players pick your locks, they become wanted and i believe pvp is then enabled, meaning they can do damage to your base
---
 https://lmgtfy.com/?q=How+to+uninstall+fallout+76
---
Because it’s like the only place hostiles don’t spawn
---
Hmm. These claims are, in fact, NOT true, because players absolutely ARE being banned for exactly this. Here's an example:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lItVXcEFcvs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lItVXcEFcvs) 
---
That's so weird. What motivation could they have to lie about this?
---
I used to sell mine to vendors.
---
Bethesda could fuck up bottling water right now.  Seriously give them a 2 litre bottle and point them to a tap, the bottle would end up half filled, leaking and the top would be glued on.   They'd sell a top in the Atom store which is pointless because they glued on the top on the bottle, so they'd then sell a bottle in the store but only supply dirty water from their included taps.
---
Finally they'd announce a premium bottled water service for £11 a month, which would deliver you great bottled water.
---
And deliver empty bottles because they forgot to fill them.
---
The lighting actually did look different back during beta, but they changed it after people apparently complained about the nights being too dark or something.  It definitely used to look better.
---
Real-time VATs with concentrated fire and gun fu is just too damn satisfying. In patch versions where VATs is working properly it is a strong appeal over other fallouts
---
we did this as a group, one of us had to relog for them to spawn.
---
You can get tons of them in vault 94.  Jump in on novice mode and knock like 3-4 different flowers off the challenge.  Pick up some vault steel while you’re at it.
---
Oh right so America doesn't have and immigrants now 🤣🤣
---
I rolled a new character yesterday and it took 5 minutes out of the vault to have someone give me a lvl5 troubleshooters walking cane haha, it was nice.
---
And that is fine, but they have to understand, if they go that route, no one is going to report anything and exploits are going to run rampant right under their noses. I personally would want people to have incentive to report exploits they know so they can be fixed, but my concern, if I was Beth, would be to try to fix the exploits, not to punish those who do them.
---
They exist but are few and far between. Possibly were pulled to do other games and the company won't hire more. 
---
When Skyrim was being made they had 30 core QA and a group of around 20 or more play testers. This game probably has 4 or 5 if that.
---
The company, like so many nowadays, see the player as a tester with it out having to pay them and a lot slips through. 
---
The problem is the industry needs to go back to how it was before but the corporations want the money  without spending it on quality.
---
You cannot initiate PvP with someone simply by becoming wanted, the other player must attack you, or if you have the electrically charged mutation they can hit you until it goes off and inflicts damage on them which the game assumes is you attacking the wanted player back and therefore initiates the PvP
---
Happened to me tonight. I launched a nuke,went down to the queen, got two hits on her and crashed. It took so long to reload back in that I missed the whole event.
---
That is also due to the fact there is more content in one expansion of ESO than all of fo76, and ESO+ gives you access to how many of those expansions?
---
It’s pretty much just as good as purified water and doesn’t sell for as many caps
---
OK but that'll be all of your camp budget for one, and you have to place the armor pieces into your stash seperatly to max out your stash budget too!
---
Yeah you pretty much took what I wanted to say right out of my mind. I feel even worse about my decision in buying the game initially because I looked at the bugs and the problems at launch, went "it's Bethesda, it'll be a rough start, but there's a diamond here", and sold a few friends on it. I kept pointing to Wastelanders as the big turnaround, and Wild Appalachia helped hint that I was right. Who knows, when Wastelanders finally releases it may actually turn the game around, and honestly I hope it does finally reveal that diamond that so many of us thought was there, but for now at least I'm done.  I'm not holding out extra hope that Bethesda is going to pull this one out of the gutter when they seem determined to shove it down into it with every move.
---
On my original character I have a furious faster swing grognaks axe, thing is awesome.
---
You didn’t waste your time. You had an ADVENTURE along the way.
---
Meat hook benefits from one handed and unarmed perks so with the right legendary effects can make it the best DPS melee weapon.
---
I usually play solo, but love when I get invited to a group. I don’t have a headset so that tends to make things a little harder.  But the inspirational perk is nice to use. 
---
One day I’m going to need to pay people to walk me through I am become death LOL.  I hate fighting robots.
---
What makes you think they wouldn't do that? Did you forget about all the fake 5 star reviews for Nuka dark that were posted before it was even released? They have already been caught doing it in the recent past.
---
I dunno, man. My top karma-farma posts have all been criticisms of this game. If you think this sub is just a love-in for Bethesda, I think you’ve been spending your time on an entirely different subreddit.
---
The problem comes when you realize this game is set in some style of the Cold War. What if you have a player from one of the newer countries out there like South Sudan?
---
&gt;	Just imagine someone wanting to “test if they can access their DB”, and run an update query that fucks up the entire database by mistake. Changing primary/foreign keys for example. Altering the schema. If you are a developer,
---
How, what, why would anything public facing have that kind of access?
---
Surely they are running microservices and then isolating nosql database rights on an internal only microservice. This is a scalable solution you'd be insane to use SQL.
---
My system gets all sorts of bad data coming at it. If that causes dB issues that's my fault.
---
Just looked this up on youtube thanks didn't even known about this

BFFR
---
I would bother Brazilian players as payback from mid 2000s free-to-play games.
---
As a game I enjoy the fact that time doesn't stop when I'm checking my pip boy or reading a note or terminal. I also LOVE the setting and could explore for hours and hours. I love the gameplay loop of scrounge, maintain, build stuff, grind. I like that I can make my own fun out of it and get cosmetic things or craft things to give to other people or use myself. I'm getting a lot of mileage out of making fasnacht donuts and giving or selling them to people. I really like the storyline, too - not just the main quest but the side missions are great. I enjoy the dailies and keep discovering new things despite being level like 250+. I really enjoy trying out new weapons and builds and things too, trying to see if I can make a build work. 
---
The biggest draw is the people and the friends I've made along the way
---
Not sure why the downvotes. There is no way this game could handle that.
---
Interacting with other players is the main. Highlight for me. Building my base so others can visit and buy stuff and I can show off my fancy collections is so satisfying. Helping people complete the raid and end game bosses is very fun as well. Collecting loot and getting a great drop once in a blue moon can be frustrating, but definitely worth it when you get your hands on that fancy piece. Especially when it’s something that applies to the above instances.
---
I wish the perverted would give me one of those lol
---
I have my own little prioritization matrix when I decide to play a game, some things include:
---
* How much play time can I get out of the game, is there any value in replaying it?
---
* How easy is it to make my own ”fun”?
---
* How much can I play solo? how much can I accomplish with just one friend? How much do I need a group for?
---
* Does the game cater to my whims of min/maxing or challenge builds?
---
* Does the game have player housing or it’s equivalent
---
* Does the game have survival elements?
---
There are also some things I strictly don’t want:
---
* Does the game take place in the ”real world”?
---
* Does the game not include any type of customization options?
---
* Does the game require me to be in a group to make basic progress?
---
This is just a few of the things that’s on my lists. Ultimately, Fallout 76 hits high enough on many categories. See, I don’t see Fallout 76 as a Roleplaying Game, I can’t compare it to the previous Fallout Titles because its not the same type of game.  To me, FO76 is more like 7 Days to Die, Minecraft, or other survival style games but without the forced PVP you might see in some of them (like Rust).  
---
The play cycle is go out, find materials, bring them back to my camp and upgrade my camp to make it more efficient/nice looking within my camp budget.  You either go out and get the legendary you want, or collect scrip to get the legendary you want, eventually with a set of gear for you to try one of the bosses or raids. 
---
Even within a set stat build there are a ton of different builds I can try, from combat focused builds, to builds focused on exploring the world and gathering supplies/Caps. The FO universe is not our real world, so that’s perfect - unlike a game like Green Hell.  And I don’t need to group in order to do most things (a couple of raids withstanding but those can be done in a duo with the right gear or I can suck it up and actually find a full group)
---
TL;DR: I like Fallout 76 because it hits all the things I was looking for in a survival-esque game while still retaining some RPG elements, and I can’t really compare it to previous titles because it’s a different genre of game in my opinion.  You can’t compare this game to Outerworlds for the same reason
---
Indeed, although it is amusing to picture a super mutant spotting it and running away...
---
She might cut something off.
---
Hey did you end up getting? I like it my own server have my friends on it we all get the same workshop ha dont have to worry randoms the soapbox is just for junk so it's not as bad as I thought and not going to lie the outfit is the shit lol and before everyone starts to cry over it is the exact same thing as an eso subscription unlimited crafting bag ? Wtf people it literally copy and paste 1650 crowns nd 1650 atoms haha so really what r u complaining about that too ?
---
Depends on your build. A stealth build won't care about tenderizer (you're gonna one shot most everything anyway). A minigun or gatling laser might see slightly faster kill times. Anything over level 1 is a waste.
---
BFFR. Explosive is too dangerous in mob situations unless running a dense torso or Fireproof 3.
---
So you are saying their quality assurance caught a bug before it was released? Sounds like QA working to me.
---
I think you mean .38 ammo. And yes, there are. Check your local vendors, such as Camden Park or Watoga. They should have a plan or two.
---
In the past month I have had two crashes: Once when I was running towards WS during the Halloween event (I had just heard a car explode).  Another when I was heading towards Posiden to do the workshop/powering quest - again, I had just heard the car near the land mines explode.  Weather the cars exploding is the catalyst for me or not, not sure it’s the only thing I see common between the two.  Otherwise I don’t crash very often, and since earlier this year when they did some stability fixes, I don’t get disconnected from the server very often either.  It’s been a very stable experience for me on adventure mode, as well as on private (which I split about 50/50 so I can sell legendaries on my vendor)
---
I play on PS4,
---
.38 is a downgrade from a .45 anyways whats .38 good for anyways at high lvl?
---
No............yes.
---
Yep it’s why most people already lost interest in outer worlds 😐
---
*it just works*
---
Basically botting is a big problem and is punishable by perm bans.They have bot detection systems that give 'false-positives' and innocent players can get banned indefinitely without appeal. RS has no customer service so the only way to bring up the issue is posting on the subreddit and getting 5k+ upvotes so it gets noticed by a mod.
---
hey man leave the serve real quick then re-enter it. youll keep the same server and you can do it multiple times.
---
I don’t know, I’m pretty hooked, can’t say I was into fallout 76 this much at any point.
---
the same could be said of Space Invaders also...
---
Why not just use turrets? Pinpoint the typical spawn points of mobs, and have a few defended turrets pointed that way, a few punji boards to help defend around them (or walls to block some bullets). Higher levels of home defense will help too - Rocket launchers will take down scorchbeasts attacking your camp.
---
That’s just not gonna happen
---
Trash mobs or if you just want to tap something  to tag it in a group setting
---
Oh ok I understand you accidentally posted on wrong subreddit, just want to let you know it’s fo76 subreddit;)
---
*OH SHIT NIBBA*
---
The fact that it has EPIC in it's name kinda feels like this shouldn't be spawning outside of NW, could be wrong though...
---
Right - thx a lot!
---
Overall looks nice, I think some wall decorations are needed - posters, clocks, whatever.  Some floor decoration would be nice too.  
---
But overall looks great.
---
i use my .38 ammo for my modded auto pipe pistol, it works good enough to wipe smaller monsters
---
What a find! Hopefully I get so lucky one day!
---
Doesn't work when you're building multi-level camps that aren't just a block. Mobs hide in the turret blind spots and destroy your shit while you're away.
---
I’m torn. Reddit is/was a great way to get a wide variety of rapid-fire media specifically tailored to my interests. It’s a landslide of content I’m looking for. Unfortunately, the upvote/downvote buttons that are supposed to decide if posts/comments are appropriate for the current sub or topic, have been replaced with support/unsupport buttons. This hurts the site twofold buy removing good conversation and guiding you into an echo chamber that ends up manipulating your opinions toward the most vocal members (with toxic and negative members being the most vocal). This guides you into a more toxic and negative mindset.    
---
I like the game and am satisfied with the dollar-to-entertainment exchange of both the original full price purchase and FO1st. 1st is $8 a month if you the buy the cheapest version. I can enhance the game for hours of play for less that the cost of a decent whiskey at a bar. How many people complain about a cost that equals cents/hour when they spend more than a month’s subscription on an hour drinking or a pack of smokes.    
---
The hate here is illogical, self-propagating, and usually supported by misinformation or outright blatant lies. It’s just a game. You pay for the privilege to enjoy someone else’s work. If you don’t like it, don’t pay for it. While there have been bugs and some shortcomings, the game is pretty much exactly what I expected. If I didn’t enjoy it, losing the money is my fault. We’ve all bought games we didn’t enjoy (Anthem, anyone?). We’ve all paid to see movies we didn’t enjoy.  It’s how art works. Sometimes you like it, sometimes you don’t. This whole “crucify the artist because I don’t like it and angry internet people agree” mentality is going to hurt the gaming industry ten times worse than people buying subscriptions (an MMO industry standard) at a lower monthly rate than other MMOs (like some of the extreme zealots like to insist). Subscriptions for full priced games are not new. If they ruined the industry, it has already been ruined since EverQuest came out with its bugs and imbalance in 1999.
---
They might already be working. I put up a scarecrow in my crops, and haven’t had a single attack by crows.
---
When you first build excavator it it’s at around 150%. PA breaks very slowly in this game so it will last a long time.
---
Im starting to believe all these “complaints” posts are fabricated just for the easy upvotes. I play daily and never experience any of these issues. However if they are legit then I can understand the frustration.
---
I dunno man, I feel... funny about romances with robobrains since my “encounter” with that one in Far Harbor. 
---
Setting Biv up on a date is likely to give me flashbacks.
---
It's actually just riot armor and the trench coat. There are no NCR references on it. It's a little serendipitous that random vault dwellers and the desert rangers would choose to add a longcoat to it, but not lore breaking.
---
On the morgantown map just hide in the grafton lake with aquaboy equipped. The water is too murky to see anyone without vatsing

Pastors outfit.

I like grinding and the RNG roll on loot. I used to play Diablo 2 and Korean MMORPGs so it kind of runs on my blood.
---
BTW please don't downvote OP for asking a legit question, thank you.
---
Just log out and log back in, it's the same as public servers.
---
himself to blame? bro its one thing for you to stop playing, its another to go around telling others to stop lol
---
You're correct in some ways, but theres one very very large thing I want to make clear. Bethesda IS making these decisions. Yes, they're very heavily influenced by zenimax. Ultimately they're the cause. But Bethesda is still agreeing to it. Bethesda is not guilt free in any way, and I urge everyone to not think they're innocent.
---
Also, bethesda and zenimax have a very good relationship. Bethesda would not want to give up zenimax anytime soon.
---
It most certainly can work just fine, even with multi-level camps.  
---
Mobs spawn in the same way they did in FO4, they have spawn locations around the area (or sometimes in the area depending on your exact camp location), and some areas have spawns more frequently than others (for example, my Camp in the forest over two extraction points barely ever gets attacked, and if it does, it’s from the south west.  I have a few turrets standing on stash boxes in defense towers pointing that direction.  The spawns are weak enough that they are dead before they get to my camp.  It doesn’t hamper my enjoyment of the camp.
---
On the flip side, my mire camp has radtoads and the occasional scorchbeast spawn.  I have rocket launchers pointed directly in that direction from a high ground. While the occasional scorchbeast can take out the turrets, the radtoads never stand a chance. I haven’t had to repair anything in that camp for quite some time. 
---
The first thing you should do when selecting a camp spot is to understand the attack patterns (if any) in that area and then build your camp to accommodate that.
---
I agree. Bethesda is not guilt free. Tbh the real enemy is greed.
---
Zenimax is nothing without Bethesda though, so that's never going to happen.
---
It's an odd relationship though.  Because, on one hand, I don't doubt that this Providence Equity is trying to milk it for all its worth.  And yet, at the same time, it's hard to look at Bethesda's upcoming roster of games and believe that any of them outside of Doom: Eternal, Starfield, or TES6 would be a massive success.  Deathloop and Ghostwire come across like the same quirky stuff they were doing in 2016-2017.
---
can anyone explain this? i was playing piano at camp and went for a smoke.  when i got back i was dead, piano and a bunch of other things at my camp were destroyed.  (i did have a locked room)
---
You don't get it. My endgame while I wait for Wastelanders to drop is building creative camps on/around existing structures. Static turrets aren't able to defend these types of camps, especially when you use max budget making things look good.
---
The only reason people inflate it so is because no one is running Imposter anymore. For a time everyone had the drops and plans.

The layout looks better than the inside. The walls look a bit bare. A pop of color here and there would really feng shui it.

Delaying something does not equate to it being worked on.
---
You miss the point. It does'nt matter if its "your fault". End of the day, someone messes you up with bad data you cannot handle, your application suffers.Accessing the DB is just one of millions of ways people could interfere with your application.
---
By the way - according to what you say, if any company should just accept users doing whatever they want, DEFYING THE TERMS OF USAGE, and if it hurts the application they should simply say it's their own fault. If so, there would be no such thing as "cyber". Every hack is essensially a design flaw or a weakness of given application. According to you, people sending you bad data you can't handle is entierly your fault, and they should never be responsible even if they did so by purpose.

But that's exactly why companies are defining the terms of service. To NOT allow that to happen intentionally. That's what cyber protection rules are all about - if someone intentionally messes up things agains the terms of service, they are accountable.
---
I mean, there are a number of possible explanations for this.
---
It could have been a Scorchbeast or some other enemy type.  If you were on a team, a teammate may have become hostile to attackers, or run a workshop that made you vulnerable.
---
So uhh, Overwatch is everything that fallout 76 is not right?
---
I regret paying £10 for this "game".
---
So, where's your source?
---
You are just saying more of the same -  repeating what the players themselves claim.
---
Maybe they are just REALLY resistant to the Scorched plague? That might explain why Hounds and other FEV creatures got infected.
---
I definitely think some poison resist consumable would be great.  For this week’s raid, the first legendary mini boss does an unholy amount of poison damage.  You really have to be prepared for it with a finger on the stimpak button or it will melt you in a second and a half at full health, literally.  Aside from one issue of Backwoodsman, there is no defense when wearing power armor.
---
Last time it crashed on me was during the Hallowwen event. 
---
I missed out on the rewards, but meh. Que sera, sera.
---
I've heard that Tenderizer doesn't even work in the first place.  I'd see how well you do without it.  Some of these effects are very placebo.  I used to think that Suppressor was an integral part of my survivability, but it turns out that Blocker was shouldering most of this burden.
---
People would spam scarecrows and build bases on very dangerous areas... 
---
There is a large base for abuse here.
---
Depends what you are looking for. It’s not multiplayer. It doesn’t have completely free movement (but also not ridged stuck on rails). It doesn’t have camps, crafting or plans. It’s bit more like Fallout 3.  Like FO76 it does have weapons and armour with mod upgrades, hacking and lock picking. It has skills and perks and level ups. Unlike FO76 it has companions and it is VERY dialogue intensive with factions. It has a good story where moral choices really do affect out comes.
---
I like the randomness of FO76 and the fact you really can go/do anything. I play solo but enjoy shopping at others vendors and joining events when I want to.  I’m hoping wastelanders brings a bit more interactivity as I have been everywhere, read every terminal entry and do kind of find it bit boring just farming caps/legendaries everyday.  
---
I like you can have multiple save points to go back to on Outerworlds. I like the different dialogues with the dozens of NPCs depending on which companions you go around with (and what reputation you have).  My concern is that when it’s done (I’m almost finished after a couple of weeks casual play) there isn’t anything more except play through taking different choices/builds.  At least with FO76 it will always be there and they do try to add free content fairly regularly.
---
Hope it helps? I enjoy both don’t think you have to choose one or the other...
---
I've heard some people suggest that Scarecrows actually do the complete opposite, which makes me wonder if there was an attempt to do this, but they just implemented it backwards.
---
Without actual datamining, it's not possible to verify how true that is.
---
In Canada my grandfather flew a st George cross and  Canadian flag.  We also had many Germans here who fly their national flag alongside Canada's.  Unfortunately flags seem to have gone out of style these days, at least where I am now.
---
There’s a .38 receiver mode for the combat rifle that switches the receiver from .45 to .38 I switch them out depending on which ammo I have an abundance of. I run rifle man single shot so not sure how it’ll affect commando but no real difference in stopping power in my build
---
ten
---
Ten?
---
Do you think it would have been better that Zenimax should have taken the company public like EA? Wondering what everyone’s take on this idea might be.
---
I have noticed a quota on lights in your camp.  I wonder how that might affect this idea.  I might try it though.  Thanks   oh yeah, I have neon lights spelling out my current province.
---
Not entirely sure what you mean there.
---
I think the general consensus, as far as damage goes, is the Bloodied Swing Speed Meat Hook.  As others have said, it benefits from Iron Fist and Gladiator perks, but more importantly, food buffs seem to apply differently as well.  If you put in the legwork to cook up a bunch of melee-boosting food beforehand, the Meat Hook is the best.  On its own, it lags behind the others.
---
A lot of this is overkill, though.
---
Tried to launch 3 encrypted last week, the only people joining were a lvl15 and a lvl86 that shows at the end of the event when I was out of healing items..
---
I know eh.  It's good.
---
What irritates me is when I finally decide it might be worth it to claim a workshop, I do. I get it all set up with resources and signs telling people about my free water and resources. All decorated! Then I go and start doing the power plant quest to get more power to the place, get 30 minutes into it, get killed with all my salvaged junk....try to respawn and.... 
---
BAM
---
"Controls have been temporarily disabled"
---
\&gt; come back to sync with server to find myself dead again
---
\&gt; "Unknown Error" -&gt; Login screen
---
i would really like a ghoul character
---
If you use a rifle as a secondary it's good for crippling ennemies. You don't care about damage in this case, you just want to criple SB with the 10k .38 you saved since lvl 10 and eat too much space in your stash.
---
Also not in a camp or workshop. You have to tap the touchpad and stick while inside a camp.
---
stimpacks have an animation unless you are in power armor
---
How’s it feel being so angry and reactionary to a low effort post
---
I think this is true only if you spend a bunch of special points boosting its unimpressive base damage. It would be 12 strength points to get the best out of it, which I feel is too costly a tradeoff. I think it's better to start with a weapon that has a higher base damage so that you can spend those special points on more beneficial perks. I have tried all variations of melee and weapons and by far the strongest for me has been unarmed with the right combo of weapons. It takes just 3 special points to max it out. Then I use instigating, and I have a power fist and deathclaw gauntlet both with 40% power attack damage. In sneak, in the right circumstances, I can get over 5000+ per hit. I also have an instigating swing-speed mole miner gauntlet that is brilliant at killing high level swarming mobs very quickly, especially coupled with the anti-armour and swing-speed perks in Strength.
---
That is the goal
---
Also know that you can't stack drugs in this game like you could in FO4. Only one could be active at a time.
---
I don't see why they wouldn't.
---
The problem is really just the size of the melee field.  There are only a handful of really good melee weapons, like the Power Fist, the two Gauntlets, the Super Sledge, etc.  And to get one, you have to fight the odds against dozens of lousy melee weapons like Walking Canes, Pool Cues, Pitchforks, etc.
---
That's cool.   It has crossed my mind to talk to one of my high level friends and give them a little stash to pass off to my low level player.  Might work.
---
According to venturebeat.com
---
“ZeniMax Media said today it has raised $150 million in investment from Providence Private Equity Partners.”
---
To my understanding, Zenimax needed capital(money) to grow and expand( I cannot see them doing this with titles every 5 or so years) like any reasonable company. Instead of working with to PPEP for money, do you think that going public with the company  would have been a better route to their growth?
---
Gotta pay $80 for enemies.
---
Sorry for the inconvenience.
---
Wait, this is well past cold war.  Lol.  This is a very friendly game overall.  It would work.
---
So you aren’t willing to sacrifice any form for function.  
---
I get it.  I don’t sympathize though in this particular instance.  You could still build a creative camp, that includes defenses that look good, but it requires planning beyond just “how can I make this area look neat”, it has to be “I want to make this area look neat but I don’t want it destroyed, where do the mobs spawn from and what type of mobs are typically encountered” - from there you can build your plan.  You take some time before building too much to see where the spawns are.  Take advantage of the fact certain structures are invincible to the mobs and exploit that.  Trick their AI with bad pathing and putting focus on the wrong things (most mobs zip by other things to target the Scrapbot for example).  
---
Defenses has to be a part of your plan for it to work.  Even if they gave the collection and Brahmin the ability to fight back, depending on the type of common spawns (e.g. Ghouls vs. Mole rats vs. Super Mutants) it might not help - ghouls would swarm the Brahmin and potentially kill it with Rads anyways, mole rats may just dig away and target areas outside of the range of the Bot/Brahmin, and super Mutants may just fire from a distance and destroy the camp from the safety of range.  
---
This could potentially be an issue even if you had Partol bots.  The solution has to be more than “give them the ability to fight back” (also if they gave the collection weapons they’d need to allow it to be destroyed itself then)
---
The coolest gun I have is definitely a BE laser rifle(only use for the rare pvp encounter). Downside is it cant be suppressed and I'm a sneak build
---
The best gun I have is a BE25% primed auto handmade rifle (only really use for Sierra bravos). Literally costs 0 ap per shot in vats!
---
The gun I use most often is a bloodied, vats crit damage, faster reload, lever action rifle just because the ammo is easy to find and I one shot almost everything
---
..is the # of the community guideline this post violates
---
Good point i just run .45 aae fixer with a fury .50 50k plus ammo for both i just stach all amo thats not used on bank toon
---
Yes!
---
Nah gimme a ghoul mask that works let's go ahead and bang out some p2w shits
---
The Collectron does get destroyed. Look at my recent posts for the kind of build I'm talking about, I don't mean "Look at my fancy brick walls." The enemies spawn inside the camp, turrets don't help when they hide in blind spots like I said.
---
I like survival games and this one is far friendlier than any other survival game. I like other Fallouts for RPG purposes, but soon 76 will have that and if it's any good then I think it could blow any of the others out of the water. The only thing this game is missing is character interaction like choices and actual dialogue
---
Got a legit HAH out of me, good show kind sir
---
Not on Xbox either. This game feels like I'm playing on 50 FOV when most games are at 70.
---
/r/twentycharacterlimit
---
Buds do event prob 2-3 with 100% clear by one of us dropping a nuke on area and another starting encrypted.
---
 Nuke kills imposter and ppl in area, but if you are at event you get completion.
---
Another good set of tips is to bring a bunch of stims and good gear(troubleshooters, emg prot on pow armor) along with a high rate of fire vampire weapon. With that and good use of chems you can usually handle 2 sometimes 3 pylons, so the pylon shy ppl are not wasting ammo on an invuln imposter.
---
1st is 8 a month for cheapest? How do you mean?
---
Not a bug they just die from the Nuke and then respawn when you go more into the resort part. I had the same issue though and it was really annoying trying to get the materials from them for pure flux
---
Reminds me of the CS:GO pro scene. Better not mention hacks or scripts though, otherwise fans and sympathisers will pitch fork you.
---
Wouldn't be surprised if they did that
---
Honestly, it’s your fault for continuing to play that terrible game
---
I actually bumped my CHA to 5 so I could use LW 3* and Tenderizer 1*. 
---
It doesn't really provide much use for solo play, but I want to believe it's useful for group content (SBQ).
---
Electrically charge is a legend. It NEVER activates PVP.
---
I'm able to tank the 3 pylons for many minutes but I'm not yet stuffed enough to go head to head with the Imposter while tanking the pylons.
---
And yet Feed the People doesn’t feed the people anymore...
---
I’d gladly take 5 cans of +5% XP for 1 hour over something that usually ends up spoiling in my inventory.
---
my hope lies within the wastelanders update, but there is definitely a lot of potential with npc, i still enjoy the game but at some point it's just repetitive stuff 
---
if they fix performance, cheaters and content then gg
---
The issue is that bugs exist (every game has them), new bugs (some huge) come with every patch.  Content is slow and Bethesda has screwed up priorities.
---
It's been a year and people still say the game has potential.
---
Other than that, when the game works it can be very fun.
---
Dont think I've seen that, where can you get it?
---
There's market... You know
---
My buddy and I have had this conversation.  They fucked up a staggering amount of things in the game but ultimately we logged well over 100 hours each over the year so it was certainly worth what we paid for it.
---
happened to me yesterday but the ghouls from the houses respawned only the golf club ones never did.
---
i would try to go to the golf club first (the door wasn't even opened and all the golf club outfits were there) to check if maybe they need to spawn normally and then would nuke to.see what happened
---
Oof sounds like a bug. Even to know it tells me to pick the lock, the door still opens right up without me picking it.
---
I'm betting it comes back during 2020
---
You'll probably see a new campaign enticing returning players long before any serious attempt to fix shit:
---
"Exciting new rewards for returning players, you will receive 500 Atoms and a new Photo Frame!"
---
Yip...pee
---
Try the church at Kanawha County Cemetery or the other church in the Mire.
---
If they don’t, they will have at least laid the groundwork. It’d be a missed opportunity for Bethesda to ignore BoS/Enclave missions with NPC’s coming back.
---
I never thought before about how the electrically charged mutation reacts to other players’ attacks. That would explain why some players keep attacking me when I obviously have passive mode enabled. Fortunately, I don’t have that mutation.
---
...and airborne Blight, with a mask on.....
---
of course its not that bad.. but that doesnt get clicks and views
---
Overthinking things we can’t control. 😐
---
Oh, it has potential.  The idea always had potential.
---
But I have my doubts that this group will ever reach it.  There is potential that has been unmet for over a year.  I hope that Wastelanders will change my mind, but their continued refusal to provide more details about it, in spite of its delay, makes me really dubious.
---
By “one-handed and unarmed perks” do you mean gladiator AND iron fist?
---
Oops I accidentally deleted this buggy test game, my bad, good concept however whenever it gets out of pre-alpha.
---
if patches break previously working things, which is pretty par for the course for bethesda, then it's pretty obviously whatever regression testing, if any, they are doing is insufficient.
---
Yeah but the rate they are right now they're going to just put all their effort into the next eso
---
Can't have an advantage unless you pay for it my friend.
---
What walls are those?
---
I've spent the last couple days with a new toon on my private server. Every 5 levels or so I switch to my main, build new armor/weapons  and leave in a container at the train station for my low level, leave, swap to low level, rejoin to same world and pick up new stuff. It works everytime
---
!remindme 2 months ?
---
Oh man...mine always crashed in the BETA with the DMV mission...and you have to do it all in one go, or you start all over...
---
Thank you for the reply.  I'm kinda in a rut, I'm done selling items as I have 7 characters full on caps. Ive been donating 5k to random players as I play my two main characters so that's my fun at the moment. Over the past couple weeks I've been finding posts wanting to buy armor and I've been just giving away a lot of items. I think that is my fun now
---
From my (admittedly anecdotal and unprofessional) experience they already seem to take precedence over crops for animal agro, but maybe I'm nuts
---
If you include all the re-skinners etc, maybe.  However there are a number of well vetted (not by bethesda) mods that not only restored cut content but fixed longstanding bugs that bethesda thought we could live with
---
In regards to the crab emojis, devs don't care, and $11 thing, RuneScape has been the exact same way. RS3 in particular has been overtaken with predatory, pay to win MTX and increased membership costs (now $11 a month as well), and the developers have shown absolutely no interest in changing any of these practices. This is all while the playerbase for RS3 is at an all time low, and constantly dropping because of the predatory MTX and large decrease in game updates and their quality over the past couple years.
---
I think it's usually just sitting around.
---
What are you talking about?
---
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't FO76 made by the B team in Bethesda? Isn't that like a small branch? Not the actual people who make Skyrim or FO4?
---
Looks pretty good in 4k.
---
P2W killed this game.   I'm constantly dropping stuff I want because my stash box is too small.   I'm not going to play a game that purposely makes it more difficult for half the players.
---
"tune" not "toon" and the idiom is "whistling" or "singing"  a "new tune"
---
I think them going public might be better for us look at ea when there stocks drop they change course
---
Well every few days i cap out at max caps so i will go POH shopping spend maybe 10 to 12k get max again and repeat you tend to find some good stuff had a kid sell 3* for face value (price on item allready)
---
Your title is kinda a clickbait.
---
I mean, it implies you were about to bring something that is happening, not something being duggested by you... because it's naive think that suggest something here would change something.
---
I've explained my reasons why I consider TOW to be terrible. I don't think there's a need to say them again here, if you want to re-read my post, do it.
---
Well what i do is max caps then go poh shopping every week or so. Maybe spend 10 to 12k at a time.
---
Why is instigating any good? I've always trashed anything with the prefix
---
Bffr has more dps. But I think explosive is fun to play with
---
Nope. ESO is too valuable.
---
BRILLIANT VIDEO.
---
Loved the AD, is this PC or Console I wanna get my free treat!
---
What ways for you use to make caps? I gotta be honest I'm a pretty casual play with some crap RNG so I just sell water and chems when I can.
---
Getthe all rise. Its a great weapon for a fresh level 50 who hasnt gptten a good legendary drop
---
No probs, if you're on Xbox I find them all the time if you have trouble.
---
I got kicked out trying to do the Halloween thing they had going on and couldn't get it to happen again. Even worse I never got to participate again after that
---
i would probably change me, im way too antisocial and need more firends (pc, ricksanchez70)
---
It will be like 3 or 4 npcs at first. Especially if they follow theyre current dlc releases
---
I finished it last night. While I plan to replay it in the future, I felt very done with it. I had a few bugs, most minor, but overall it was a very complete game.
---
I was playing it on Games Pass, so I'll clear the SSD space for something else and revisit it in the future.
---
I'm still playing 76 with friends, one or two nights a week.
---
That is reflective of the real Helvetica
---
I like flags
---
My culture is not your costume!
---
Um. What? Like I've been around since we had 400lb stash boxes. I'm really confused with everything you're saying. Like you can easily store items you dont use on other characters or just sell it to a robot vendor. What really confuses me is your whole perk weapons being sold thing? Like where did that come from?
---
PA is the only item in the game (I think) that has stats effected by it's condition, even if it's not broken or even nearly broken, repairing it will yield higher damage resistance.
---
Indeed
---
I have another idea. This doesn't come from any dislike or hatred of Bethesda or their fallout titles, just a fraction of my ideas about copyright and intellectual property.
---
We have seen what Bethesda sees Fallout as, and what they like to with it. So they can keep 76 is they like since it's an ongoing project and all that, but for the next installment I'd love to see someone else's take on the franchise. I'm not even talking obsidian and the original team, although I do love Fallout 1,2 and NV.
---
Someone completely new, to provide a breath of fresh air to the series, both in software terms and storytelling terms. Even if it's just for one non necessarily canonical title, I'm not advocating to rip intellectual property from the hands of its rightful owner. But a little bit of sharing wouldn't hurt imo.
---
That is AMAZING
---
Speaking hypothetically a way around that would be a keypad entry &amp; no windows would it not? ......or not? :)
---
QA should find bugs before release, not during a deployment. I doubt that was QA. From my experience with deployments, if the bug is found during a deployment, it is the people deploying it that found it.
---
The scrapbot does have weapons and will attack, they are just ineffective. I’m pretty sure I’ve heard mine say, “kill, kill, kill” too, but it’s been a while since I’ve seen him attack.
---
A player can go wanted with something else, and still go to you and hit you. It doesn't have to be your lock.
---
Thought about that but can't see where in my build I can give up a point
---
My commando uses a .38 fixer. You would never guess it is a 38. It kills everything.
---
Good thing all my ammo was saved from start xD
---
The owner doesn't (normally) need to do what you are doing. You should be able to open &amp; close it as if there is no lock. The lock should only stop other people opening it unless they break in by picking it or are on your team.
---
You are experiencing a bug.
---
It's sad that u need to ask ppl not to downvote :(, but right now people are so angry.  Not me...no matter what they've done or what they do to this game, it's more than paid for itself.
---
Its a buy event i take it where you need to buy x item for it. Not a lot of people have done it im lvl 140 and seen it  2 times when i was in my mid 50s. Got KOed with no items for little dmg
---
How would they do that? I thought that would make you safe
---
Shit. Game.
---
"pc master race"
---
Many fear they will bring weapons and perk loadouts to the atomic store. I personally never see that happening, but I have been suprised before. 
---
All we can really do is wait and see at this point.
---
I really hope they give up the Oblivion franchise to someone else.  They will ruin it.  I know they will.
---
you realize that does happen, and those people do often get hired buy companies for cyber related jobs right?..... *rolls eyes*  You people need to stop making excuses for Bethesda's shitty decisions.
---
His story is that he was searching for the exploits to help out but in the end he didn't report them. That's reason enough for me to understand why Bethesda employees banned him in the first place. Beyond that, I have no evidence to support a conclusion about either party, so I make none. As I mentioned I think the ban seems a bit harsh but it's not my job to make judgements based on a fluff reddit post.
---
If you want to make conclusions about Bethesda based on hearsay and a near total lack of hard evidence or insight into their processes, you go ahead. I have a hard time understanding *that* point of view.
---
Maybe they were trying to get their turrets to attack them and that made the entire CAMP valid for being attacked?
---
Doesn't slap damage still hit you in pacifist mode, you just can't damage back to activate full PvP and wouldn't that apply to damage to your CAMP structures? Seems like a griefer wouldn't mind spending the ammo or melee swing time to destroy a CAMP for shits and giggles. Maybe picking a lock to make the turrets fire just makes it faster and cheaper.
---
Are griefers still using Survival tactics? Saw someone last Meat Week near the Meat Cook location with a drop trap vending machine three or four stories up with a camouflaged floor and a sign in the walled pit that said "YOURE MY PET NOW." I'm assuming they didn't realize it costs 0 caps to fast travel to their CAMP in Adventure to get out of that setup if they're using a powered vending machine as bait.
---
Thank you very much 😃 I’m on PS4 😊
---
I play FO76 like every minute will be my last. Sometimes I'm right and sometimes I'm surprised.
---
Looks like its working now - removed the locks and readded then and all ok now 👍
---
Thank you 😊
---
They go to some other guy's camp, pick a lock and go wanted, then go to you and hit you. If you have electrically charged mutation and it hits them, you will be in PvP with them.
---
Last time I hopped on was for the scout badges and backpack. Many of the ghouls in Whitespings wouldn't animate so youd have the model of a sleeping ghoul going for your ankles at mach speed that you could barely shoot.
---
Scarecrows but dresses in power armor pieces???
---
lol, yea. Atleast you could see them, even jf not at first lol
---
Would appear it was a one time glitch with me which resolved itself
---
My psn is:GestapoCOB
---
Hahaha 
---
I’m sorry!! 😂
---
Damn I have like 3 of those, do they really go that high?
---
People play this game?
---
Could be related to not having the pacifist setting enabled in Adventure mode. Slap attack mechanics?
---
Not a crash, but I frequently have the bug that prevents shooting from an heavy weapon... in Nuclear Winter. Realy frustruating
---
Wait... your Gemini games?
---
my QE harpoon even though im not a heavy build.  for the same reasons as your railway minus the toot toot
---
I’ve got a video of a normal behemoth turning into a scorched behemoth but I’m not sure how to upload it
---
Sounds like a lot of fear mongering. If the game isn't enjoyable to you, dont play it. But dont always believe silly stupid rumors or listen to the hate filled bs youtubers throw at this game. 
---
I've got 2401 hours into the game and it's still incredibly enjoyable for me.
---
Har har....move along
---
Pretty sure I'm knocking on 1k, and whule I'm struggling to find something to do currently. I would say a vast majority of my experience with it has been positive.
---
Hunter's long coat and black prospector's hat?
---
What if it only had a small diameter that would make sense.
---
That’s a great gun! I mean, you still need to make ammo, right? But it only requires one component. :)
---
The Whisperers are crazy really need negan to bosh beta with Lucille
---
Then that's all the matters. But at this current time, its grind session as folks wait for more content. Go try some new games for a while.
---
Nice! Where’s it by? I’m also PS4
---
I seem to collect more spikes than I fire, started at 100 spikes and dumped a load when I got to 400.
---
I watched your videos on the asylum runs and got addicted from there 😀
---
Get off this fucking FALLOUT 76 subreddit if you have nothing half fucking decent to say
---
I have been. Played outerworlds for awhile. I take very regular breaks from 76 sometimes spanning a month or so. Events tend to bring me back, just wrapping up to 1k script rn for the next purveyor sale before I take my next break.
---
I am not a bloodied build but I drink it and jump into my rad shower.  I will give it to another bloodied character too.  Overall it's not useful for much, but as often as I get thirsty at camp....it has helped, lol. Stay filthy!
---
Out of all the fallout games it has the best world , locations and stories (not maim stories but sub stories) i also love building camps and taking down enemies as a team
---
Another imaginative masterpiece from you...... And a hilarious video. 😂😂😂
---
Slap damage was removed and being pacifist doesnt effect damage you take.  
---
Pacifist mode stops you from being able to retaliate (so you dont get fooled into accidently initiating combat with someone)
---
Landed myself a BE fixer today.... it’s taken the top spot 😂
---
That’s true. I forgot you could just retrieve them from the corpses. 👍
---
Its like Gatorade but more radioactive
---
Any structure with a pot belly stoves, like cabins. Most have caps boxes or bobby pins.
---
everyone who loved this game had the same sentiment at launch, stick around long enough and you’ll see why everyone else rags on the game
---
I tried to set a nuke off and it crashed when I got to the actual launch bunker. Had to repeat this 5 times. I just quit eventually
---
I think the nuke is not intended to do alone (altough you can with workarounds). This is not a bug.
---
Were those bugs released? No?
---
This would make the most logical sense. Enemies attack us and would confuse a scarecrow for us.
---
As cheaters continue to run rampant, content continues to be delayed, and monetization becomes more aggressive.
---
Yeah. High priority.
---
Also if you break through the banks security then tell them how you did it, they're generally greatful. It's called white hat hacking.
---
Probably but it will take them a year after seeing this to implement it because of 'limitations'
---
Yeah, another player said he has one for me
---
Ah, I'm on PS4
---
Items outside of containers and their respawn timers are shared among all players and spawn when a player enters the cell. If you server hop to a server where someone has already entered the cell, picked it up and left but the respawn timer hasn't reset, it won't spawn again until the timer has reset, the cell is empty and someone enters it.
---
Map76.com or are you simply not actually aware of what's going on?
---
If it’s empty, it means someone took it
---
Can you explain to me the significance of the crabs? I played osrs years ago and I don't remember anything about crabs of all things lol
---
you dont get any more until you spend some.. they just spin off into the nether when you pick them up or sell something
---
any caps gained at that point just vanish
---
on screen it will say max + x(caps) and you dont get them
---
Wonder if it was me. I sold a fixer plan for cheap yesterday I think. I pretty much sell everything cheap bc I don’t want to hoard everything for eternity and I like making folks happy.
---
Oh I know this one. 
---
If someone picks a lock at your camp it will make you hostile to each other. It’s a glitch that’s been around for a couple months at this point.
---
Ah yes its 2shot, so even tgough it only takes 1 ammo from yiu you get 2 back from the corpse
---
Your caps will say "Max" instead of a number, and any caps you receive while maxed you don't get.
---
Nice!
---
Right?! I have some "junk" in my vendor for 25k just so I won't scrap it. Before display cases I kept accidentally scrapping my teddy bears and models.
---
Perhaps having a locked area is their targeting criteria. It is pretty easy to kite enemies and let them attach a base. Availability depends on the location.
---
But what if I server hop the asylum exclusively? I mean, how could somebody have taken it in the 30 - 45 seconds it takes to run from the gates of the asylum to the 3rd floor locations? Especially if there is nobody there.
---
That's alright, I appreciate al you guys' input.
---
Here is your medal for unoriginality.🥇
---
Some items are instanced, and some are not. I believe the asylum dresses are not. So, each server already has a decision on if the dresses are spawned, and what color they are. Yes, if someone else raids it first, they won't be there until server reset, but they may be there again on a different server. However, once you loot them, you can't loot another one on any server until reset.
---
That's the best way I know how to explain it, if anyone else knows a better way feel free to jump in!
---
Exactly.. I used to see people do this in their vendors.. and at first I thought they were trynna be funny, but now even I do it and have junk in my vendor for 20K so no one touches it! We shouldn’t have to do a workaround like this for a feature that should exist already!
---
I have a BE railway rifle that I feel the same about. Make if full auto and use Commando perks, you won't be sorry. It's  a VATS beast!!
---
What he said. A close second would be my VE Gatling gun, lets me tank most things with little trouble.
---
How big is this cell? Also, how can the respawn timer be shared among players? If you’ve picked up the dress from, say, one of the bunk beds why would that affect me and my timer?
---
Only if it wasn't limited to 'vermin' class enemies. Radroaches, radrats etc. Maybe you could have another type of item to fool more intelligent enemies. Camo netting maybe?
---
Tha ks
---
There is a cooldown from when it was looted last.
---
Ah, ok. That makes a bit of sense. Thank you. :)
---
You win the game
---
Set up shop near a popular area. Whitesprings is where my camp is. Make a decent looking camp - there are lots of great YouTube videos for inspiration. Mine looks like a gas station with the vendor machines where the gas pumps would be. Set your prices reasonable. No one is going to buy your stimpaks for 50c, Karen. You might have a want to set them higher - don’t. Set them what you are willing to pay. All my recipes are 5c. All plans are 10c. use a set price for legendaries (20c/edit: scrip - not star- will clean out my supply every few days). Also, people like junk. Those chess pieces and jarred heads in Morgantown are big sellers at 20c each. 
---
That’s what I do and I’m max capped every few days.
---
The particular ones that they stopped the release for? No. But that is 2 times they managed to stop bugs being released during deployment VS the dozens of new bugs that do get released on every update. If that is evidence of them having a QA team, then it is only evindence of them having an incompetent one.
---
If you have the electrically charged mutation, whenever it pops it'll do damage to you.
---
Another person mentioned a cool down period, which seems to jive with what you’re saying. I wonder if people on private servers stand a better chance to get good dress rolls, since they’re the only ones tapping the source.
---
Cool thanks for the input!
---
Anyway it wouldn't stop enemies attacking the rest of your camp, they'd just skip the crops and go for other structures.
---
I agree with this, a point out of each slugger for max Incisor and Blocker. 
---
If you run in T-60 Power Patcher is not needed AT ALL. 
---
Power User is only worth it if running Gatling Lasers. 
---
Drop points from Makeshift/INT and run with Travel Agent and Lone Wander CHA 5. If in a team you can swap out Lone.
---
I’m not commenting on the quality. All I am saying is of course they have a QA team. It would be impossible to function without one and the fact that they have delayed patches because of bugs they found ahead of their release is evidence of their existence.
---
Also you have no idea what other bugs have been stopped before release. Generally people only see bugs that manage to make it through QA, not what was blocked.
---
CAMPs can be locked to prevent access to any storage, sleeping, cooking or workbenches.
---
And wouldn't the CAMP of a non-subscriber not have a scrapbox? Can non-subscribers build scrapboxes even if they can't use them? That would be an issue for TENT owners.
---
This is a good question, I've often wondered the same thing. I've fairly consistently seen at least one person in Defiance in nearly every server I've been in before private servers, but sometimes there are items there, sometimes not, even when others are there. Usually if the top floor is missing items or has open doors, its a good indication someone has already looted the good stuff.
---
No I don't have that mutation. Also that has no effect when you're in passive mode. I've even tested this against one of my alts.
---
Same. Still it would only protect crops, not anything else.
---
Completely changed my build to use it lol!
---
*Camp Auto-Doc as a quest reward
---
No it does, its listed as one of the downsides of the mutations.
---
You are literally repeating what I just said back at me like it is some new information.
---
^ I would like this very much, but not very realistic as things arw going Im afraid.
---
Eh, not really. The "private servers" are just private instances. There have been reports of people's servers having been looted already in some areas, or people feeling like other invisible players are around (such as what happened when the vault raids first started)
---
Haha 
---
I already won the game THANKS
---
Exterior cells are pretty big. Most interior cells only involve the structure you can move around after going through the loading screen unless the loading screen was moving you between exterior cells (i.e., roof access elevators in Watoga).
---
Interior cells aren't instanced per player, they have a set of attributes shared for everyone. Item spawns and their respawn timers are part of the world data stored server-side that you're accessing when you join a world, same way you can load into a world where a nuke zone is already active. There's a flag that when you enter the cell, the item won't spawn if it's already been looted and the respawn timer hasn't cleared the flag.
---
Totally. I’ve seen players just kind of loitering for long periods on that map location. I thought that they might be waiting around for dresses to just materialize. I mean, does that even happen? Lol
---
Thank you very much
---
That’s sells for 15k!?!? I literally have been giving them to people after all my encryptid runs, I’ve gotten the plans at least 7-8 times now
---
I’m dumb
---
Keep or sell. I'd buy it
---
Keep it. With the right perks, the 10mm is super fun to gat on fools. I rolled with a JE for a while and it's definitely not as good as a handmade, but it's a nice change of pace.
---
Sell it. Should still be a market for TSEs
---
I think it depends on the weapon. The first shot is the only one that carries the bonus, so if all you need is one shot it's great. My Instigating pipe revolver is very deadly. On a machine gun? I'd scrip it or sell it.
---
Someone explain it to him.
---
For me it's all about building up my camp. I've spent hours just fucking around building what I consider cool camps. 
---
Settling Appalachia was my main goal camp building was my end game. Probably why I keep playing none of the other issues affect me.
---
Story wise I'd choose any other other fallout game but for me 76 is just a wasteland camp builder simulation.
---
...yes :))
---
I get it, its hard to have a good looking creative base **and** a well defended fortress. One usually takes away from the other. If I'm building a farm, fishing pier, church of atom, whatever, the only thing that usually stands out as awkward is the 10 turrets, so I drop them down to 2 maybe 3 and try to hide them. If you build in the forest in certain parts the spawns are really light, and I've found two places, not sure if it's glitched or not, where they haven't spawned at all. Would be cool to have a scraptron that defends himself though, but mine is currently behind my bar so he's all good.
---
Honestly I would just pay atoms for it to work, it’s not like am going to have a serious advantage over anyone else and if they did I couldn’t care less
---
It can be really frustrating. I have a couple of very high damage builds that can melt her pretty quickly, but they are bloody and die easily.  With a PUG this is nearly impossible. Even if like 10 people show up. I have failed it so many times.  
---
However, when a single competent person shows up- its cake. For example- when my wife plays with me she just activates all three pylons, jumps onto the shack and pops stims while I melt the imposter.
---
What level?
---
Worthless two shot 10% damage while aiming osnt sought after
---
Also cant supress 10mm smg
---
Isn't 10% damage while aiming a 2nd perk? It's a 2nd perk on my Bloodied .50cal, which should also be a 2nd on your 10mm SMG; that means it would miss out on the Explosive perk which is also a 2nd.
---
Also 10mm SMG does not have a Suppressor.
---
I hope someone responds here. I’m on Xbox, otherwise I would help.
---
My quad auto railgun might be my fave out of the whole game. ROF is insane, damage is good, ammo becomes worry free, plus I get a little **whooo whooo** that never fails to make me smile.
---
It literally cannot be tse AND have the 10% damage while aiming perk.
---
No. Do not sell things at 20 caps a star. They go for 20 caps a scrip. It is such a waste to put a three star weapon at 60 when it would easily go for 800-1000.
---
The surprising thing is that there are many people who started to play at launch and are still playing the game one year and 1000+ hours later.
---
Frequently , it’s those same people complaining.  And that makes sense for at least 2 reasons:
---
- it’s hard for any game to hold a player’s attention for a year or more;
---
- these players have more in-game experience than the Developers - and that’s why Bethesda should listen to what these gamers say.
---
Personally, it’s still my “go-to” game and will be for a while even if there is no new content
---
I am not judgemental. For some reason when you've read that for the first time you saw I am being a hater, even YongYea's mindless drone, but that is on you. You can see that if you take a deep breath, clear your mind a bit and then read my comment trying to point out some part where I am judging you. Then you will find out there is none. I am stating you will continue doing something you have just said yourself you are already doing. Nothing else.
---
Exactly. It's literally impossible to be tse, and 10% damage while aiming.
---
Im well aware of this, but Im sorry, this is not a source. This is someone claiming he got permission.
---
By source, I mean a proof that he was authorized. Something more real than "he says so".
---
It's just the same as me saying "The president gave me permission to drive on red light". Yeah right, tell that to the judge. Unless I would present something like a phone call, mail conversation or other kind of paper you wouldn't assume I really got permission to do something strictly forbidden, right?
---
This guy is very passionate about hating bethesda. If he really was actually autorized, he would have quoted the mail\\conversation where they formaly autorized him. He would have cooked some delicious arguments with that conversation. But he doesn't have that.
---
He goes into much deatil and quotes everything bethesda told him, except for that part. This is not a coincidence, he simply doesn't have anything to show here. He thought he was doing good, got banned, and now he plays the victim and exaggerates the circumstances.Its an unfortunate situation, but he's gotta face that even with the best intentions, he plain and simply broke the rules.
---
Lost his motivation? took down his project? That's perfectly fine, and understandable. Maybe I would have done the same. But there's a difference between feeling that you are right, and actually being right.  
---
I went into detail in various comments here about how people could unknowingly cause errors in the game by naively "searching for bugs". Please refer to these comments if you wanna read more. Bottom line, bethesda doesn't want to risk people damaging the game, even if that's "just to help".
---
Makes sense I have a level 3 super mutant that really hates corn and would periodically show up outside my camp to attack my corn.
---
Can attest to this. It would be cool if enemies attacked it first though so like you had that as a buffer. But I do feel it works.
---
😁 thx
---
I usually see them for 10k on PC. You need to learn the plan to get the fixer from the purveyor so demand is up for them.
---
I went up there, no dead body. Now at the very bottom of the bridge there was a body of a woman and up to the top, but not at the top of the cliffs there was a dead man by the antenna. Maybe its a random event?
---
Its a fallout gane with other people, or more basically, its fallout, i have enjoyed every fallout i have played, this one is no different.  
---
I always wanted a multiplayer fallout although this is not how i would have done it, but ill take what i can get
---
Hate it when people get two shot without explosive they call it TSE
---
Do you eat burnt food too?  Wear clothing that’s too small?  Drink out of a broken glass?  Why not?  Because you bought doesn’t make it right. These folks are right, “bait and switch” baby. ex. Ever since the BETA the trade glitch where it crashes during a trade or will not let you has not been addressed. But whoa! That was mentioned on posts over a year ago when most of the world had not even been explored. I could go on and on but you will not listen to protest. Shut up.
---
I've never seen mine even attempt to fight back. He just stands there babbling about how much he loves scrap while enemies trash his little hut.
---
😁
---
I'm lvl 130 and havnt run it yet either. I probably won't be on today because of work but if you add me id be down to run it sometime when I'm playing next. My psn is : Thereal-Danimal
---
I'll add you when I'm home later.
---
I just wish i could loot the imposter sheepsquatch. Getting Fixer plans would be a plus.
---
More than a year, then. The first time that has been proposed was more than a year ago.
---
Okay.   I have 3 ranks of hard bargain.   So my calculations are off. 
---
So it would be 3 + 9 [hard bargain] + 1 [armour with chr bonus] + 1 [alcohol] + 5 [grape mentats] + 2 [Bobblehead] = 21
---
So I am getting to the max discount at about 20 chr.  Plus you mention that Grape Msntats give you a 10% better prices. I missed that as well. 
---
Personally, because of the perks, etc. and I dont do much in teams, I only spent 3 points on the character SPECIAL.  
---
The point is that you dont need to build it up to get better prices, etc.   You really only need to do it if you are playing teams and want to share full rank PERK cards.
---
Thanks for the video. I didn't know much about the Solar armor before, but now I'm interested in a set.
---
Nope, every behemoth has a chance to spawn as Epic, Glowing, or Ancient.

"I am proposing a split needs to happen that seperates Zen and Beth"
---
And you're proposing this to a bunch of nerdy gamers.... why? xD   
---
Dude, we're not shareholders or CEOs over here.
---
I've started hiding my fourth vendor unplugged in a separate room that says not for sale with everything I want to save at crazy high prices.
---
To me, the worst thing is the lack of new content and updates, we need more, its a live service game with no interaction from bethesda, i dont think they anticipated how quickly we can get through anything they add, and since theres no mods to keep us busy, we are demanding that they are adding the content that would usually have been filled with mods.  
---
I dont know if i can narrow down a best thing, its fallout i guess, its kinda what i expected
---
Old man melee. I'm collecting swing speed golf clubs and walking canes.
---
Completely true
---
Ooops. Yes, you’re right I sell them per scrip not star.
---
Still hunting
---
Ha I thought that when I read it.
---
Not really, you can que solo though if you can't want a team
---
i did it yesterday for the first time with a friend in novice, holly shit we were like an entire 1hour down there and fixed more pipes than mario in all his life xd
---
the 2 things that i learned as a noob were: armor that tanks mireluks damages are really good, plus with a melee one that has %30 vs them while the other can go power armor with a ghoul killer build.
---
I've done it twice recently, and everything went normally. 🤔
---
While a private world won't have the concern of other players clearing out the asylum before you get there, it's a bit harder to server hop private worlds because if you leave and come back it will put you in the same world. So you basically have to leave a private world, wait a number of minutes (15?) then log on. It's probably more efficient to just to server hop public worlds until you find one that hasn't been looted recently.
---
True but my point really is if your not going to help them at all and every just watch them die nest to you them you should stop being a dick
---
Depends f you are in PA or not, and f you use performance enhancing chems, foods, etc. (I generally do not)
---
For me, most of the 2H weapons are too slow, and i end up dying when faced with a mob.
---
In PA, my goto is a 1\* vampire switchblade.  Been my main for almost 100 levels.  Think I got it aS a loot drop in WS.
---
out of PA, I use a vampire DCG/extra claw  or (Instigating) meathook.
---
I keep an AA LMG and a Troubleshooters gatling for dealing with things that fly.  Also used the troublehooters gatling to clear the silo.
---
Heals addictions? No thanks! *takes another hit of Psychobuff and waves Junkie's combat knife menacingly*
---
You're reply has absolutely NOTHING to do with me saying that its your OPINION. But thanks for showing you're an idiot that can't understand simple things. Go be stupid somewhere else.
---
That’s a good point. I didn’t realize that.
---
It shows your level on the character selector, and at the top of the friends list thing, when you are actually playing, and at the end of each match. Honestly they could probably do better with showing it. 🤔
---
Ahh I’m so glad u asked this. I wondered the same thing
---
was it rad damage you were taking? and are you sure it was a homemade? 
---
right now rads are being abused to bypass the pvp mechanics.
---
were you wanted? from lockpicking into the camp?
---
Not that I’m aware of. You can only see your progress bar towards the next level once you finish or get eliminated from a game, but that’s only a bar and no actual number with a number to go towards next level.
---
Actually you're right about that mutation, I tested it again just now, and although you can't attack the player hitting you, it still does some damage to yourself when it triggers (about 50-75HP each time).
---
But the build I was using doesn't have that mutation. I double checked, and there is no way I could have done any damage at all.
---
Again, you're clueless.
---
What about the emails sent to YongYea? What about all of the group coming to him separately around the same time corroborating the story?
---
Oh, no that's no legit story.
---
Beth make a post to refute his specific claims yet fail to refute he had permission to do so.
---
I have a JE railway and it's awesome. Put the auto piston mod on it and empty clips into things using VATS.
---
&gt;started firing at me
---
i really doubt it was from a mutation if it was straight gunfire
---
They're prob already stealing the idea tbh.
---
There are so many games out, there are other games I like too.   So...
---
Nope, explosive bait does ***not*** work on scorchbeasts.  If you aggro one and there's an open area nearby, it will land every time. 
---
Only creatures on [this list](https://imgur.com/a/DMc6AkY) are attracted to explosive bait.
---
It’s often that way for me. Think it’s hit or miss
---
All I asked you was the source. You got mails? cool, link them. I'll read them. Maybe I'll change my mind.
---
But go on, call me clueless again and again without ever sourcing your claims. What a perfect way to win an argument.
---
With the Marine wetsuit and shadowed combat armor you can get a pretty decent looking all black outfit, or if you like BOS you can do BOS paint which is also black but has the insignia on it.
---
It's not random, it's always there. It's past the antenna.
---
Oh cool, hello 👋 😊
---
Just next time the miners monument 😊
---
Who?
---
The "friendly" ones are random encounters, and they will not land unless you aggro them by doing enough damage to make them hostile.
---
Hahaha thank you very much, I’m glad you enjoyed it 😄
---
Definitely not rad damage. No change to rads, that I could notice, just my HP. The player was definitely firing a rifle at me. It was silenced and makes the same sound as my handmade does.
---
I had just loaded up the game, was not wanted, did not own a workshop, had not lockpicked anything. I can't explain what happened unless it was a hack or exploit.
---
I think the building and crafting system should only be able to use scrap, and not be aloud to break down anything. 😡
---
Remember funny joke in game, this guy's INT 15!
---
(PS4) I did a solo silo run over the weekend.  
---
Was my first; given the number of stories here about death after launch, I was very paranoid entering the code.
---
Launched successfully, then ran the nuke zone For flux.  No issues At all.  
---
IIRC, the entire play session lasted about 4-1/2 hrs, no hitch, No glitch, and no crash,
---
You mean bring their "scream" attacks back to constantly filling your entire screen for the entire fight? No, thanks.
---
Ah well, that's fine! :)
---
Fallout 2nd $109.99/yr
---
Ignoring your incessant need to ask for sources when nothing has refuted the sources you do not deem worthy. 
---
This team consists of DM/modders who worked on FO4 to make some amazing mods. (Fo76s code is almost carbon as a skeleton to fo4) F076 map guy also used the code written by hundreds of people (not true) to make the map. Therefore, your baseless attempt to write off their understanding just proves how much of a shill you are and that your mind will never be changed.
---
Enjoy your Fallout 2nd servers.
---
There are a couple of armor pieces which provide poison resistance.  IIRC, The ones I had were trappers.
---
I mean. I've sourced you two. 
---
Research is your best friend, my man.
---
They have a 30% chance to be 1-star, 10% for 2-star, and 5% for 3-star. I think it's a pretty good balance, considering how easy they are to kill with endgame gear.
---
That’s why I want to destroy camps when I see gunpowder for 10c ea, treasure maps for 500, etc. I get that everyone wants to make caps, but no one needs a chem bench for 1k.  I guess that could be funny, but whatever.
---
Oooh good shout I'll try that
---
PA is very durable.  I’m in PA almost 100% of the time, and I dont remember the last time I had to repair any of mine.
---
Start a new toon!
---
My instigating super sledge faster swing swing speed oh my lorrrrddd. (Btw how would you abbreviate that, I’m new to this lingo)
---
Also, my husband is a bloodied build and I found him in a vendor bloodied 3* super sledge max level
---
Drink it.
---
  bonus: its lighter than purified water
---
Once you get to the antennae at the top, turn around and head in the direction of Harper's Ferry, up over the rocks. The 2 dead bodies are in lawn chairs literally facing Harper's Ferry. They are down a little from the top. Dog is always there...great place for a base if you want a permanent pet. 👍
---
Is this not already the case? Enemies always seem to target my scarecrows, I have to fix them pretty much every time I fend off an attack.
---
I am pretty sure most people who criticise them for greed actually know how basic economy work.
---
This is one of those persistent issues that hasn't been addressed in the game.  
---
It's a lot like the repeating gun sounds that they have been trying to fix since release.  I think that I've still encountered the repeating gun sounds in other locations but they might have finally fixed it for Whitesprings.
---
Probably gonna get downvoted for this, but I would really love someone to explain to me why, after all this time, you continue playing this game? There are so many new releases from other developers that are objectively better made games. And if you do play any other games what games do you play?
---
I don't crash. But I did get a server disconnect immediately after launching my first ever nuke.. Solo.
---
Ya, that's a great score! I recently sold one for 15k. I really didn't think anyone would buy it and was hoping someone woukd make me a trade offer. Then all at once, while I was at 22k, they bought a 5k weapon and then the plan. They paid 15k, I got 3k. And so I quickly left the server. Sorry to you, random dude who probably fell to your death. I did it for money.
---
I always find them full the first time in each location.  I think that there are 3 locations where the event can spawn.    
---
If I do it a second time in the same location within the same 20 hours, then they are empty.  Think of it like your cap or script limits.
---
Why don't you just play a different game??? There's lots of great games out there. Guess what Bethesda doesn't give a fuck that you posted on reddit, the only way you can speak to them is with your wallet
---
oh ok thanks for that :)
---
 U on ps4 i would buy
---
I like roleplaying a junkie murder hobo and killing literally everything I see. 76 is the best fallout since 2.
---
It is reddit afterall, the go to place to complain and argue for no better reason 🤣✊
---
Yeah, she finally hooked me up
---
I've noticed this once before after fast traveling to an SBQ battle.  It was very disorienting.  There was a dead Scorchbeast ragdoll on the ground that kept trying to flap its wings, and the sound effect from that kept playing.
---
You notice this on things like Radrat tails too.  Sometimes, they don't stop moving.  I'd also include insects, but I don't know if their wings physically flap, or if it's just a texture effect that doesn't stop.
---
Amazing job. But why were you tea bagging the guy that needed CPR?
---
When my console doesn't blue screen multiple times a day then I'm game :)
---
People giving Bethesda money every month are expecting the spot where they placed their TENT to have a STASH, scrapbox, bed and cooking station. Overriding CAMPs can potentially deny access to these with locked doors (or simply an outright lack of built structures aside from the CAMP unit itself if people just want to grief popular TENT locations).
---
This is also assuming the CAMP replacing the TENT has a powered vending machine. Not only would it be removing a free fast travel point for the subscriber either way, it would be removing any fast travel point if there were no vending machine.
---
Nice man,i finally got a B Ffr Handmade from her couple months ago.changed to a bloodied build and never went back lol
---
I could be wrong, but I think they sporadically drop from Ghouls.
---
I've been doing these events for the past two months with no problems.  I've been trying to get the Plasma grenade plan that drops in the ash heap. I wonder if its platform related.  I'm on the PS4
---
For me this is happening with strangler blooms.  They used to always be there during the Heart of the Swamp event.  Now its random for me.
---
I killed a snallygaster earlier, except it kept pacing around in a circle like a dog does when it's getting ready to lay down on it's bed.
---
It would've been cute...but it's a snallygaster
---
I don't think the prevalence of video game addiction is understood. Game makers understand it, tho.
---
They are unethically praying on a demographic incapable of making rational wallet choices.
---
 If Washington and/or lawmakers gave a fuck, "early access" should either be illegal or have some kind of oversight/rules a la guaranteed refunds, etc.

Edit: I realize my comment might come off as out of context, misplaced, half baked, or whatever, BUT YOU DONT HAVE TO BE A HELICOPTER PILOT TO KNOW SOMEONE FUCKED UP WHEN YOU SEE A HELICOPTER IN A TREE!
---
It seems like 3~ patches ago they started showing up in containers way more frequently. Pretty often I'll find a stack of 6. End up listing them in my vendor but nobody buys em, so I drop em at stations.
---
My instigating low vats cost higher accuracy Western revolver. Real stopping power.
---
Incredible camp, very cool!
---
I rolled an instigating explosive railway at the purveyor, it's my new favorite gun.
---
Love the train whistle sound when reloading
---
Not only that, but invisible mobs that could attack and kill us. 
---
Or flat out invulnerable ones.
---
I’m also on PS4 also running for plasma grenade plans, and funny you mention strangler blooms as I usually farm them once a day, since the latest hot fix I’ve yet to see a single bloom, probably just bad luck?
---
I can’t do guns. Ammo is scarce and I just like being up close and personal with my enemies when I kill them
---
Are you built near his swamp?
---
Exactly it has potential. Every game has potential, but as it stands it's an unfinished mess. Imagine you paid full price and the game is an order of magnitude buggier then it is now, wold you still enjoy it?
---
Add Bethesda employees to atom shop to play the game for me making it easier so more fun
---
There's a suicider mutant outside west tek who always seems to drop one. You'll also be able to find them regularly in a brown paper bag at my camp
---
Last 3 SBQ fights the server crashed right in the middle of the fight. Last time was because someone was wearing the stupid Strangler heart armor so I’m not sure the whole server died but I locked up and crashed because of it....
---
I prefer ffr personally, better dps. And the rapid, suppressed sneak critical sound is so satisfying
---
It’s not just them, I have seen other creatures do it too....
---
Most likely
---
It’s obvious, they could care less...They haven’t listened to this community for a long time now.....
---
Considering the number of people playing regularly (like myself) we can say it is flawed, but highly addictive and satisfying in its own sick way.
---
Why were you rolling melee weapons if trying for a new rifle?
---
Don't stress. It also does this on PC and XBONE. There is no discrimination or preference.
---
The game hates us all equally.
---
Be honest, would you be happy if they were on the atomic store?
---
Bethesda will take interest in this idea and than put it on the atomic shop for only 500 atoms.
---
Dont scarecrows already do this to some extent? I put them on all three sides of my crops. Every time i come back to my base, the enemies are attacking my scarecrows and nothing else.
---
I feel like there’s an extra mechanic in place in price servers to replicate the effect of other people looting for rarer items (plans, magazines, rare costumes). Even if I haven’t been to a place ever on the private server and I’m the only one there these items aren’t always there when I visit.
---
Last two times ive done the event ive glitched and couldnt respawn and had to close the game on ps4, thus losing out. Its been super frustrating.
---
Drink it, it weighs a lot less than water....
---
Seems like you are the one trolling. Because you are deciding to argue against my view. Because you want a reaction. 
---
And your point doesn't seem to make much sense about saving scrap time. 
---
The point is. If you are giving things away for free, in a manner that is basically leaving them lying about for people, you don't have much say over who takes the free stuff. If it means that much, spend some time in Flatwoods and hand it to lowbies. 
---
So stop trolling because you want attention.
---
Nah, it was passed on to B team after the whole controversy that happened, and main team began to focus on starfield
---
There are not any crows in this game.
---
Just about to finish Feed the People. Nope, crash. Found two legendary scorchbeasts, they were about to die. Crashed.
---
Brilliant, love the build.
---
If someone did it on that server already then they don't respawn
---
I really don’t have this issue.. sometimes I come across complete empty servers.. where most things seems to be taken altogether.. but I am constantly hopping servers for magazines and for me 95% of the time I have no issues.. 
---
I’ve been magazine farming since before PS.. And it’s made my life so much easier!
---
Edit: I guess I can’t really comment on the dresses.. I don’t farm them specifically.. but I am constantly farming magazines and other in game spawns.
---
Were is this spot?
---
Yeah they're server specific, so if someone already got there then they're gone
---
I found one for 150 caps just before the half price sale. Gold. Then a day later I got one from Encryptid so I paid it forward and have it to a player that needed it.
---
This ^
---
They're tied to the server I believe, not character so if someone hit those already then they're gone until server reset. Will have to test this on a private server
---
*laughs in Australian*
---
New game or been playing for a while?
---
Playing for awhile
---
You expect stuff to survive a nuke??? /s
---
Most people just think TSE means Two Shot lol
---
Pastor vestments and black prospector hat for a kung lao vibe.
---
Have them be unaffected, but give them a few funny one liners
---
This isn't a free-to-play game.  Most people paid Bethesda a lot more than $12 to buy the game originally.  🤷‍♂️
---
I have 1st and I frankly *do not care* if your CAMP overrules my TENT.  In fact, I'd kind of welcome it, because then I could put my TENT in a high-traffic area without worrying that I'm going to block someone else.  It's why I put it to the west of Watoga Station rather than *at* Watoga Station.
---
The simple fact of the matter is that it's far easier to replace the TENT than it is to move a CAMP.  It doesn't even cost Caps to do so.
---
I don't worry about someone trying to "grief" with CAMP placement.  Is there some remote chance that a Lv. 20 could be off in unexplored territory, plop down a TENT, and become inconvenienced because they didn't visit any of the surrounding locations for fast travel?  Yeah, I guess.  But that's how the game has been, sans TENT, for almost a year, and no one complained.
---
Yeah just need to find it lol
---
I don't think that's true. It just makes you wanted as far as I know.
---
Same, in the end, I have to carry 3 pylons in a 10 player event, and carry by using like 100 stimpaks
---
What did it cost?
---
Because clearly that E and the end couldn't possibly mean anything lol.
---
 I love my Combat Knives, but I really like my Western Revolver. All my knives are +40 Speed etc etc but my Western Revolver is vanilla. ;)
---
[PC]  never had those problems
---
Would make some of the quests easier - tripped up so many times trying to complete the Stings &amp; Things quest by accidentally scrapping / cooking the required items!
---
So watcha gonna do with all the fame - retire?
---
Damn. Well whatever, I killed everyone else so until next time I guess.
---
You can technically already do this by tagging the junk as something you're looking for to make a craftable item, but it only works for junk that's an ingredient for a craftable item and would involve you dropping it for a second since it won't tag an item you have in your possession.
---
So until they add teddy bear armor crafted from teddy bears and adhesive, you're just gonna have to keep finding those teddy bears again when you accidentally scrap them.
---
I haven't seen them for a couple patches.
---
They were always on the rare side when they started showing up, but I might find one every other day or so.  Now, it's been a month.
---
Maybe a crop protecting scarecrow in the shop could add this functionality for 1800 atoms
---
Is that really fun? The endgame is the loot so if you're cheesing the loot where's the actual game?
---
This is great!
---
What’s fixer
---
😂
---
/mo ftfy
---
If people are interested I will be open for business later this afternoon. I am still doing research on what I can sell things for to expand my buy list to more items, my character is low level so I do not really have access to enough research on flux or other such materials to come up with prices yet. A lot of time the price will be discovered by offering at my vendor at various price points and seeing when it actually gets sold. 
---
I have other ideas for features like wholesale prices for crafting partners and maybe at some point I will find out how to calculate the profit to do the first in game IPO (assuming it makes any profit). I am assuming unless something wild and crazy happens I will probably just drum up enough trade to make it so I can easily hit my vendor bot cap during the week when I can only play an hour or so per day, but probably not make nearly as many caps as the dedicated farmers, grinders, or legendary vendors. 
---
In the other post I mentioned possibly acting as a go between for trades, but I think it will take a long time to plan out how that will work. The stuff so far is based simply on game mechanics and arbitrage.
---
You can get 4 shots off really quick but it takes a long time to reload.
---
I'm not a heavy power armor user but I still use it.  A lot depends on your build.  I run stealth commando or sniper so I find substantially more benefits from regular legendary armor.  I use my excavator to harvest ore since it increases the yield by 4x.  I also use it to fast travel if I become overweight.  I will also use it or my ultracite power armor if I'm with a group in a nuke zone to be tanker so everyone can get their hits in.  If I'm running solo in a nuke zone I usually just use a hazmat suit.  I still use my regular legendary armor for queen fights as long as the queen isn't in the blast zone.
---
I have a couple neat ones I'm holding onto hoping they get a little buff.
---
I saw dense raider at lewisberg just the other day (thurs night) so they’re still out there.
---
I regularly do this event.  Never had an issue.  Are you missing the hornwright executive keys?  There are a few 'special' boxes.
---
The last big patch is when I last got one.
---
I did the first 120 or levels solo and had a lot of fun.  Since then I've been teaming up with folks and have a regular group to play with now.  I was honestly surprised by how much more fun the game is by being on a team.  Sometimes we are all just doing our own thing but still able to talk or psn text to each other.  Other times we will just spontaneously decide to do events or launch nukes together.  I highly recommend trying it out.
---
And life
---
collect the animated perk cards you get after 100
---
tbh I did that so long ago that I can't exactly remember. After it was done I did not dare take it apart again :P 
---
I'm pretty sure it was with half walls and the slanted half walls though. I think the roof snaps onto those.
---
Bad isn't even the right word, the game is a total meme.
---
Those are already harvested, so you can’t increase the yield.
---
How much do dense plans typically sell for?
---
&gt;I’ve gotten the plans at least 7-8 times now
---
I'm not jealous. *cries in a corner*
---
Seriously though, last time I played the event, I died right at the end and couldn't respawn and no one bothered to revive me even though I was running around doing all the quest points they were ignoring. After that, I gave up trying.
---
With perks, beer and grape mentats 907c.
---
Wish this was on Xbox. Good luck man hope it all works out for yoh
---
I’ve never seen them there before. Thought it was only Watoga.
---
Best thing is a pretty large world and lots of stuff to loot. Playing with other people is generally fun. Worst thing is some decisions make the world feel empty and grinding, and the crafting so far seems less essential than farming gear.
---
But if u attacked the wanted, they can destroy your base
---
I check watoga daily. Same, haven't seen one in a month.
---
Have you played the game? I have over 600 hours in the game, I more than I have gotten my money’s worth. You really think switching to a model where revenue is 100% dependent on micro transactions is a good thing? No thanks.
---
You mean as in sell on. Combat is 10-15k or more and the rest 8-10k.
---
/reads title
---
I bet this is gonna be a rant... and I was right.
---
What exactly is so special about Dense plans? I always see them worth tons of caps but never understood why.
---
So you work 8 hours, game 12 hours, and sleep 4 hours?
---
Man, I'm not in need of caps so it's not a problem for me to TP everywhere. I also have the perk called "Travel Agent".
---
- The first thing I do when I log in for the first time each day, is going to Welch St. and killing/looting everything in Welch. Equip the perk "Hard Bargain" and sell the weapons and drugs. One run is usually between 500-700 caps, meaning I'll only have to relog 2-3 times, sometimes a special enemy will spawn aswell (deathclaw, legendary sheepsquash or legendary scorchbeast) - PLUS the xp is also great and you get a lot of black titanium scrappings too! :)
---
It’s honestly a good game, has so much potential, and overall a great idea, just under bad management.
---
Yes. /s means sarcasm.
---
Why not to fix all this mess before trying shady practices? Look at Path of Exile for example - honest mtx system, regular content drops, and game is free to play
---
yeah the ghouls were a problem since they can flank you and almost all my stimpanks gone that way lol but my buddy one shot them fast. 
---
i didn't have problem with poison but my exterminator chest has 25 poison resistance..still i didn't try to fight the mirelurk queen so dunno... i almost one shot any non ghouls with fury and power fist build xd
---
but that plant above the door in the end almost fk up this melerl build.. too much radiation for me xd
---
Very nice!
---
Yeah there supposed to be quite rare and I felt lucky that I always found them. Had that many I put them in my vendors instead of trading and they’d go instantly.
---
I haven't looted a dress in several days,  and in a private server,  when I load in,  there are one or know dresses. As much as Bethesda has stated the servers are not recycled,  I am beginning to believe they are adventure servers that have been recycled
---
Congratulations. How was your experience with cheaters? Curious to see if I should give NW a second try, I'm on PC as well.
---
I don't remember them ever saying they weren't recycled servers?
---
Think it’s because they’re meant to be hard to find. I have dense on my armor and a Scorchbeast doesn’t seem to touch me when it’s doing it’s blast. Really good mod.
---
I just bought a fixer plan for 90c.
---
I honestly couldn't believe my eyes.
---
Cool, I think I'll hang on to it for the moment and have an experiment with it.
---
I would also like to see the salvaged assaultron head and .44 placed into blue chests. They're just not on the same level as other weapons in that box. I'd much rather see a 10m pistol than either of those.
---
Certain guns need a nerfed spawn rate. The grenade launcher and the .44. They'll be times I open 7 boxes and 5 out of the 7 will be a .44 or a grenade launcher.
---
Also, plasma and pulse grenades shouldn't be in blue boxes, or yellow. Orange only. They're the highest powered grenade you can pull from a box, they should be in the highest available box.
---
"Bugged as absolute fuck"
---
Stop playing!  It's been out a year, as you stated, so it isn't going to suddenly fix itself.  Stop fucking playing the damn thing.
---
All these salty people in here wasting their garbage words..
---
Idk man, I just gave my opinion. Why not to fix the "mess" (as you say)? 
---
Well they try to but doesn't seem like they know how to do it, although that the game goes pretty well for me.
---
Sadly I can't talk to much about things that doesn't happen to me, like game breaking bugs.
---
Sorry.
---
im a trust fund baby
---
not as bad as people make them out to be
---
there are a lot of really good  players on this game that might seem like they are cheating
---
Because with a Dense mod combined with Fireproof perk make you immune to explosive blast damage 👍🏻
---
I love the game.  Yes, it's got issues and I scream when it disconnects me but I've played it a ton and will continue to do so.
---
Put the gauss and both laser rifle and pistols in yellow crates, they’re not top tier weapons, put the grenade launcher in Epic crates - we need less of these in the game - it’s too powerful and with demo expert way OP and kills people too fasf
---
I have been playing since beta, I love this game and just yesterday I saw a scorched up in a tree, so it's possible
---
What was your price?
---
They sell for 500c at robot vendors
---
300 caps
---
They're selling them to a vendor to make a profit off of your low pricing.
---
It's good to have interesting stuff in your vendors. As a buyer it's always great to stumble across the unexpected. A few months back I found someone selling Fasnacht plans for dirt cheap. I bought the bonfire for 50 caps and some of the wall decorations for similar. I'm so glad I found them and not someone who would've just resold them. I was very happy to add them to my camp as I was going for a Wicker Man vibe!
---
"It's been a long, hard road and we're still not outta hell."
---
Except you could pull over or turn off at any point.
---
I farm Morgantown everyday there's always 10 around there
---
yeah i do the same, but i sell mine
---
Huh wow.. interesting. I think thats about the going rate. Maybe they (falsely) believed they could flip for higher.
---
I still can't believe how many people are willing to pay for the price of the game every month just for 1st!! Bethesda must be thinking they've died and gone to heaven.
---
Maxed out hard bargain sells to non-player vendors for 450 each.
---
No idea. Just know that that there is one. I have gotten disconnected, reconnected and continued to hit the Queen towards the end of the fight and couldn’t loot the body.
---
Yep real men hide under the toxic water at Grafton Dam
---
Your google doc links don't seem to work.
---
Oh fair enough! Wasnt even thinkin non player
---
lol
---
Vanguard's armor? What do ya mean by unstoppable
---
that's sounds pretty greedy if you ask me...
---
NPC Docs on the way?
---
Although I have to admit that Fallout 1st is definitely worth its money to most people playing F76, I want to make an emphasis on why is that happening. And that is what makes me dislike Fallout 1st so much. You know, when car service is offering to fix your flat tire for 50% of work's regular price, that is definitely worth its money too, but when you've seen them knife your good tire a minute ago to make it flat, that deal does suddenly leave a bad taste in your mouth. And that is exactly what Bethesda is doing with their Fallout 1st.  
---
The singleplayer mode had been taken away from a fallout game or the first time in its franchise history. It is given to you back (given badly, I have to say, but it is at least something), but for a price. Limited stash was a huge blow to every hoarder out there when F76 came. When the first replies came from Pete having "I was not aware of any stash limits" in them, people have asked for unlimited junk and ammo because those can be stored in any capacity with no issues to server stability. It was an easy fix, could be easily done before the launch itself, yet we see it now as a paid feature in Fallout 1st.  
---
Those two and tent also do go against my view on how MTX should work in a game. Even worse, in a B2P game. B2P Game's MTX (IMO) should be optional, as in "have no effect on the game". I don't want people in same group to have the dialog of "hey, we've been playing for an hour, I need some time to manage my stash now" - "well, I do not, because I play $10/month more than you". You wanna look different, have different emotes or selfie poses? Sure, go for it in the MTX shop. But when you are forced to go there if you want to make your game more convenient to you, that is the developer saying: I know what you guys are struggling with our initial design of some of the game sides, but instead of just changing it for everyone so you could all enjoy a better game, we are going to make you pay for that if you want it. Else, you will have to continue your struggle. We do it just to make some cash, there is literally not a single another purpose for that. Indeed we made the game worse than it should be to make you pay additional money to improve the game for you. A game you've bought for $60. And we think that is totally acceptable to do so.
---
I would say it is not acceptable.
---
Stop giving the devs ideas on monetizing this game, it should be an update to the existing scarecrows like you were saying but knowing how Bethesda has takenideas from posts exactly like and put them in the atomic shop so care what you wish for I guess
---
Cram burgers on the menu?
---
Can I ask where you’ve been finding them in the wild? I know you can the mods but didn’t know you could find the plans.
---
Scrap is so easy to find. I never understand what the problem is. The junk bot is worth it though.
---
I like my food build a lot, going to various areas and getting food and cooking it. I like chems too but I don't do drugs except maybe buffout to carry food back to camp
---
That’s what I think! They need funds and sales r low, community is love/hate and now they have to overwork employees during holiday season to churn out wastelanders which is already laborious enough without adding the holiday element to it. All that being said I bought fallout 1st and not just because I wanted to support them but because I was about to spend $10 on atoms anyways so why not spend $3 more and get more atoms + more features. It was a no brainer
---
Amen buddy
---
It totally is, even more coming from Bethesda, something really strange/bad. But thinking about that this will help to fix the game, (and if it doesn't Bethesda knows what will happen) I'm ok with it.
---
Worth having at all or upgrading from 2* ?
---
I was talking about the mods. Sorry for the confusion
---
Great feedback! I find personal experiences like this to be a great source to make inferences from
---
It's hilarious seeing "please add" or "please fix" posts still being made after so much has (or hasn't) been done by Beth. If anything does get added it'll be to Fallout 1st or, let's be real, Fallout 1st Prime. You guys are funny.
---
Like yourself?
---
I've got a friend that's running the M79 build. It is indeed wickedly OP. Between Demo Expert, Bloody Mess, and Grenadier we can mop up entire squads.  Single hits can deal over 200 damage.  I'll use thrown grenades and automatic rifle fire to force them into cover. They frequently bunch up behind the same cover, making it very easy for him to take them out en masse with the M79.
---
I want the responder stuff. I'm not sure why they don't capitalize on these things people are begging for.
---
Hard bargin 3 and unyielding armour will max your trade prices which will be 500 a serum at vendor very profitable.
---
I can see this happening and would be surprised if it doesn’t down the road
---
Broken, same with the endurance bonus on armour
---
F2P just attracts squeakers and dickholes. No thanks.
---
People do have to pay for water, its not included with the purchase of a house, and it costs more than $12 a month.
---
Side note:  you MUST kill him before he goes ka-boom if you want the mini-nuke.
---
I am sorry, but there is some weird delusion with thinking you paying for fallout 1st would help fixing the game.
---
Could you please give me any other example where you'd pay additional money for bad service in hopes it is going to help fix it? For example, if my ISP starts disconnecting me 10 times a day, I would soon (in a matter of days) change it for some other ISP or stop paying for it completely until they fix that. If  I am getting you right, you would send them additional money hoping that would help them fixing their problems. Would you really do so, or am I getting your idea wrong?
---
In Watoga, north, on top of a building. There are two Vertibirds, the one that's closest to the west has one. Edit: not in Phoenix vendor area, it's northwest from the crashed vertibird in the middle of Watoga.
---
Anyway your best bet is finding a suicide mutant spawn, as if you log out and log back in he will spawn again, unlike mininukes on the ground that could be gone. Man I miss Farsnatch, the last part full of super mutant suiciders was really fun and yielded a bunch of mininukes.
---
I really don’t understand how comments like this are getting downvoted with little to no replies, like these are facts people you may not like it but Bethesda has shown us time and time again they are willing to blatantly take suggestions from the community and go and charge money for it.
---
Wait. How would you know whether or not endurance on armor (or weapons, for that matter) was working? Like, with agility on armor you get 10 extra ap points per piece. So there is tangible proof there.
---
don't take gun fights unless necessary
---
have a dedicated terminal hacker and support
---
explosives are op
---
use tenderizer
---
resell. This is why I have infinite caps
---
Have you tested this?
---
Oh I think I didn't explain myself, for me a great problem with the game is the lack of content, not the bugs (mostly because I don't experience that much bugs).
---
So with fixing, I meant the lack of content problem. Paying for microtransactions helps the devs to keep DLCs free for years to come.
---
Sorry my English isn't so good, so maybe I didn't explain myself well.
---
Not sure what are you afraid of. Do you mean like you thought they would provide you free singleplayer mode with free mods and now you have started to doubt that?
---
You might have corrupted game files. Go to the Bethesda.net launcher and repair your game files to see if that makes any difference.
---
This post needs to be upvotes more
---
You can buy it on amazon, sometimes the physical (key on paper disc) is cheaper than the digital download.
---
Hit points don't increase. Also a nitpick, tangible means 'able to be touched'. So maybe you mean verifiable
---
But is that the only place to play it, you have to use the Bethesda launcher?
---
Did you ever find it?
---
This is incorrect. It will work only if you're NOT in passive.
---
Plenty of times
---
Or Grape Mentats.
---
Or “observable” :)
---
Works whether you’re passive or not, I’ve done it multiple times
---
That’d be so cool, I’d just farm whitesprings for a horde then bring it to the usual whitesprings station vendor camp
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
You still use the Bethesda launcher and download it from Bethesda.  It is literally just the code on a paper disc in a dvd box, silly as crap.  Currently, it is full price, but recently I got a copy for 16
---
Thank you almighty one. You have blessed me with your knowledge!
---
Totally agree! More love for every weapon! I got a cool little Anti-Armor, Faster Swing Speed, 90% Reduced Weight Switchblade that I love to bits.
---
I really hope this isn't the case. The problem with doing that is modders can't experiment, and design iteratively, because they'd have to submit their mod for approval. Considering how much BGS had talked about the importance of the mod community, I can't imagine anyone being shortsighted enough to alienate their community by.... Okay, well I can imagine it, but still really think they won't. Especially on pc, because they just won't get people modding, and that's a loss on their part
---
Havent had any issues. Might have to look at reinstalling. 
---
How longs it been going on, have you. It been able to play at all or just simetimes.
---
Open a ticket with Bethesda if reinstall doesnt work.
---
Nah, I'm sweet.
---
Scarecrow: *exists*
---
Deathclaw: oh shit
---
That’s ok. Thought you knew some secret place and was hoping you’d share it.
---
I'll believe it when I see it.  I do it frequently as well and it never works on people in Pacifist mode. A friend uses a ripper and I use a drill because they activate the mutations quickly and it has never made anyone in passive hostile. 
---
It's fun to do at the WS though. If a bot is close enough it'll make them hostile, and hilarity ensues. Even had an assaultron breaking a guys base, lol.
---
Highest is 290, then 156, 138, mule at 27, and then a newbie at 17. Not including the 15 other characters I deleted on averagely around level 50.
---
You might have gotten the infinite ammo capacity glitch. Does your ammo counter go up with every shell and can you stop the animation by pressing the fire button?
---
Granted. You can only play with 15fps.
---
I just buy em all out for my alts and to help people out
---
Aren't those bound to the toon?
---
It does.  I got killed by a griefer at my camp  couple weeks ago doing the lock/elec charged thing.
---
Well, can't argue with that, MTX is how they are making money to keep DLCs free. That is the only way for them to get any money from F76 now that it has such terrible reviews and such low prices.

It goes along with the "live service" idea of the game pretty well, I actually did want to explain all of that in a big post, but in short, everything they do falls into "done because this is a live service" category, and new content, new events, and Atom Shop items instead of bugs fixing is one of those.   
---
So, yeah, rejoice, if you enjoy the game, just keep on paying for MTX and you and your fellas will get additional content for years. On the other hand, as long as you do it, spending any considerable time on fixing bugs and gameplay issues is a waste of time and money for Bethesda.
---
Ok
---
Ah dang, I will hop on and fix that, sorry.
---
Same. Last time is was in my Alt and could reach the very top boxes.
---
I used to sell them at 250 but it meant I was always running out of flux, as players would buy them all. I’ve upped it now to 300 and can keep up with demand. It’s an easy way to get rid of caps if you’re nearly at max as you can sell them to a vendor for about 500 and they don’t weigh much in your stash.
---
I can’t find anyone selling Marsupial-PS4
---
No, they used to be rare spawns at watoga and harpers Ferry.  I haven't seen one in ages
---
Well atoms can't be exchanged so there's no larger economy to crash. A lack of a cap limits means 1 hacker could crash the entire market by mass dumping.
---
Also, if you're nearing max caps take your vendors offline.
---
We’re mainly doing it for flux making stuff.
---
From the purveyor
---
Omg I’d love this. Even if it was just for a few days on the run up to Christmas Day.
---
And if no one complained about anything for a week? Oh yeah, I forgot. It would have the same affect. Hell let them eat letters, gives the common folk sumthing to do. Bitch away!!!!
---
I also just got it a couple days ago. It took me months ever since the game mode came out because I do not have much free time to grind like this.
---
The fact that I like the game mode made it much easier to get.
---
The funny thing is that I actually got it at overseer level 101 because my game crashed during the match that I reached level 100.
---
Tried that one yesterday, but it didn't help. But thanks for the reply.
---
I really miss when they told us what they were working on. Basically radio silence since FO1st backlash.....
---
There are websites selling F76 used (stolen?) accounts for $1.5 with a lifetime warranty, like if you lose your account you get a replacement. Not sure if you'd wanna mess with those tho, sometimes that could be a good idea if you are willing to try out how it runs on your PC or how it feels playing, etc.Could be most useful with F76 because the game is not so much loved on average so chances are high you are not going to like it that much and chances are low for some guy trying to retrieve that account back to back to F76 which could lead to you losing all your progress.  
---
P.s. It might be an option to find a free account of one of your friends who are done with the game.  
---
For example, I'd have given my account to any of my friends who'd want to try it, although I'd beg them not to try it at all even if they would somewhy want to do it.
---
It used to be 25, now it's 30. It has always had a limit, you screwed yourself by not paying attention.
---
I’ve never had that happen. I turn my vendors off. 😂
---
I thought so. My easy cap maker has come to an end😭
---
They resell them at robot vendors for something like 450c apiece.  If you price yours well below that, they'll take advantage of you.
---
Doing Encryptid.
---
Links repaired, it was doing some url encoding funkiness.
---
You didnt get it close to right unfortunately. No-one said anything about stopping reporting people who use exploits. 
---
He's asking people to not report exploits to bethesda as bethesda will ban you for it even though all you've done is try to help them. Bethesdas decision to ban the account was insane and unprecedented. I dread to think what a company who treats fans like this is doing to the elder scrolls right now.
---
Which really isnt the best way to make money. If you did this daily, you're essentially making your cap vendor pool down to 450 instead of 1400.
---
Yes to both. Endless supply of scrap and no worries about stash limit. As for the bot, well it’s been finding me coal and ballistic fibre and that’s such a pain to look for.
---
No, I just sold my third high capacity mod for 1,500 serums
---
Oh that’s cool!
---
Ive never had 20k+ caps before
---
To become extra invisible?
---
I can't get them to land reliably so I still tend to avoing them. Very bullet spongy
---
including the Queen's echo attack
---
They are absolutely not recycled servers. Bethesda has definitively stated that they spin up a new server on AWS when someone selects private world, and everything I've seen supports them on this - for example, the door to the purveyor's train station is *always* closed, something that's rare on a public server. The rumors about recycled servers have been started by people who don't understand how enemy/item spawning works, or by people who just want to badmouth 76.
---
&gt; Players have also expressed concern that their private servers have appeared already looted, but Bethesda clarified that this is most likely not an issue. Instead, private worlds behave like Fallout 76's public worlds do. "When a Fallout 1st member starts a Private World, a dedicated World is launched on an AWS server," Bethesda said. "Players who have seen looted containers upon login may be experiencing the expected behavior upon log out and log in. Loot is instanced for each player in containers. As Fallout 76 players know, if you loot a container on one server, and then log out and log back into another server, the container remains in a looted state for a period of time."

---
I didn’t know if it made your sneak better
---
I want to rewamp your camp! Blahhhh 🦇🦇🦇
---
I love those athletic courses. Probably my favorite challenges in Ever Upwards.  Sounds like lag was going on.
---
I sell my extra plans for pennies. I just sort of goop the slider over, no real reason for 37 or 45 caps, it just hit there.
---
I gave the guys who started the last Encrypted event I did (2nd one ever) 80 stimpacks and diluted stimpacks. What's funny is on my second run I got the mascot outfit on my second run ever and one of the other players hadn't had it drop after 15 runs.
---
Why buy a fixer plan when you can just buy a fixer? My executioner's fixer was around 450 caps, and I'm selling my old regular fixer for just a smidge less than that.   
---
I really have no concept of what most of the stuff is actually really worth tbh. It seems like people just Jack up the prices insanely just on the off chance that *someone* will come by and get it.
---
It does stack, from what I remember it improves your stealth (harder to detect) and increases the amount of movement you can do before the invisibility breaks.
---
captainoob's done a few videos with 5 pieces of chameleon armor showing how the effect works.
---
Ah I see thats good to hear. Thank you for the info!
---
It’s very fun to use, don’t scrip it. The best roll would be fast firing and faster reload, but any quad crossbow is good. You can start firing before you load all four arrows.
---
I was born in 78 also.  want a new adopted brother?
---
I sell some of my materials at below vendor bot prices to encourage people to buy them up and sell to the vendor bots for me. I usually cap my vendor bots anyway so anything I do not need to trade is just less labor for me.
---
If people do not want to grind to hit their daily cap on vendor bot they can do it with these, however the margin you buy out makes a difference as you are tying up a lot of money. My credit union strategy is basically the same concept in micro, I buy junk from players at low prices and turn it into quick vendor bot caps. I can grind for the junk but I want to play only an hour or so on weekdays (have a fulltime job and my own indie game under development) so storing up a bunch of vendor bait for wuick sale later fits my play style. 
---
That way I jump on for an hour, quickly hit my vendor cap, and them just go clear out an event or town, shopping at camps I see along the way.
---
gratz bro that's awesome
---
Yes Bethesda is having cheating problems on pc with NW turns out when there engine is free to mod people hack it easily
---
It’ll be back in its usual place when you hop servers. Unless of course, someone else is already in that spot.
---
If they are at 250 caps or less, I will buy all your serums too.  That’s my number.
---
Oh sorry, typo, I meant next to not next time lol. I have a PlayStation community page Gemini Games, if u want to join 😊
---
Yes, cheating is big in nuclear winter on pc
---
500 maxed.
---
Of course 😉
---
That’s a nice roll, best fixer I’ve got so far is a VE. Gotta keep scripping and murmrghing.
---
never attack the first enemy you see.  3 more are always waiting a few seconds behind.  kinda like how a buck sends out the doe to the clearing before they stick their head out.
---
I can sell you one if you want
---
I wanted to make a joke about PC master race players just being so much better than console peasants, but that is no laughing matter tbh.   
---
Cheating in NW is not a problem at all, if you want to cheat there, you just cheat all you want.
---
That’s +200 caps profit at 500c to the vendor. 
---
I’m so they someone’s buying them out on yah but I’d raise your prices to prevent that from happening
---
If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.
---
We'll get snow, but it will be in an exclusive bundle-only particle snow machine
---
It's honestly kind of stupid. Even if the mutation serums are cheap, say 200 caps each, and you are selling three of them at 1400 to max your vendor cash for the day, you just reduced your vendor cash to 800 for that day. I guess if you just want something easy and don't care about throwing away potential caps, it's an ok strategy, but I'd rather extract the full 1400.
---
Those spikes are heavy, I don’t know if there’s anything wrong with my perks but they seem to be a lot heavier than other ammo types. Also do you pick up spikes every time you hit the target? To me it’s a hit or miss, I can barely maintain 100 when I started with 100 spikes.
---
scrap box is fixed. Personally I’m not impressed with the look of the bland base robot - especially because the colours are not changeable - and waiting for the raider or liberator versions
---
Okay, thank you
---
Look for other perks to tank like Blocker, Dodgy, Serendipity, etc. Wear Sentinel Armor or PowerArmor. Use Vampires weapons. It’s non-traditional, but it’s as good as you’ll get.
---
Did SBQ three times on the weekend, crashed right at the end of TWO of them.  So silo time + fight time wasted.  That unable-to-respawn thing is getting really old and is a hard stop on me buying FO 1st.   They \*must\* fix that and the fast travel bug before they get into my wallet again.
---
You mean you don't like the patented extra spoopy effect in forests and the texture on dogwood trees that looks like portals to infinity?
---
You may also like the instigating revolver, just as good 👌
---
Why not though? Russians practiced for years on 4chan. Neckbeards are easy to manipulate socially, so it'd be easy to find out the easiest ways to manipulate through their hobbying interests
---
A eye twitch emote would be so great for so many reasons
---
Theres no benefit to having more than one.
---
Congrats, first time is a rush =)
---
This. I’ve fallen for it too many times.
---
I'm not specced for pistols. Do you mean the pipe rifle version?
---
You must be on PC?
---
Yea pipe revolver with rifle stock
---
After having a gulper drop on me unexpectedly - I could see a section of the mire being home to some giant spiders that rappel down on you and attempt to “bind” you with silk. 
---
Deep into their territory there would be a dugout ground web cave with a legendary queen sized one and her brood.
---
Absolutely not.
---
Nope, ps4
---
This only happens when trying to view the map, right?
---
Have you tried using a map mod?
---
Also, have you attempted to launch a nuke? The targeting computer uses a different map. See if you can load that one.
---
I know it can be tricky to travel without a map, but you can ask a friend to help you out since you can open the friends list without going to your map by pressing Ctr+Tab.
---
I mean i dont mind it honestly lol just figured they would have fixed it by now.
---
Found 10 in a ammo crate yesterday.
---
76 got so much hate from influencers it’s sad
---
Right on man thanks
---
*laughs in Russian* this one thinks they are original no? Should let them carry on while another game already has that
---
Exactly. I wasn't trying to be a downer. It's a fact that everything the community suggests gets monetized in some sort of way, shape or form. I just don't think it's fair for a player to pay full price for the game, pay for the subscription AND pay for features that should be in the game for free.
---
This is not ok.
---
Not since the scarecrows scared them all away anyway
---
Turns out your Gerald buddy
---
You have to say " I will pay you money Bethesda!!!11" and it just might
---
Instead of acknowledging defeat  - request what’s fair.
---
if you have any other questions let me know
---
Its very bad rn you should wait for wastelanders
---
This how you expand the selection wheel for other options. It is a bit cumbersome using.
---
A small price to pay to stop the ghouls at the clubhouse destroying my camp when a level 12 runs there with level 50-62 ghouls behind them lol.
---
(Not complaining and no I won’t pay money to basically have my camp on god mode).
---
Hey what are you implying. Just for the record I have not heard "Allstar" at anytime in my lake/swamp base just East of the Devil's Backbone....
---
If I see someone selling serums at 200 caps, I'll buy them all. With Max charisma I sell 2 a day for 500 caps each. That gives me a profit of 300 caps for literally doing nothing. The last 400 are extracted from the vendor over the course of the day using miscellaneous items. This allows me to obtain the max caps per day at the cost of stash space, and since I transfer all my heavy crap (or excess junk) to an alt the space it takes up is almost negligible. Passive caps for little work? Hardly seems stupid to me.
---
So am I.  I'd have thought they'd be consistent, I've not noticed those problems at all.   Definitely nothing I'd describe as loading into buildings twice.  Because PS4/XBONE are standardised, if you're having problems that are unique to your self, I'd start by looking at your net connection.  First, if you're on wifi, get off it.  Run a cable or even just to test, move the PS4 to the router and use a short cable and test.  For Wifi, use 5GHz.  If you can't because of a weak signal then you just answered your own question.  FO76 doesn't need a very fast net connection but it does not like packet loss or latency.  I've played using my 4G phone connection before and it was fine, but when our cable was playing up FO76 was unplayable.   Anyway just some ideas, good luck
---
Somebody once told me
---
Forgot to tell you this, but Nuclear Winter also uses a different map, so you can check if this only happens with the adventure mode map by simply joining a Nuclear Winter lobby and opening the map before the match even starts.
---
Why are things a thing, thing about it
---
I will say that I don't think it's needed to stack them, one really does the trick 99% of the time in my opinion (I run 4x vanguard and 1x chameleon), but if you walk on walking around in crowded situations trying to avoid detection, it may help.  I just kill things, so there's rarely a time where I need to escape.
---
This can happen on all armor and weapons. Certain mods will increase the durability bar more than others. For example on most rifles increasing bashing will add to the bar.
---
Of course, taking down a scorchbeast can be a bit slower for a melee build than a heavy or stealth sniper build.  Use any shotgun with the enforcer perk to cripple the wings, and stand in an open area. Stop shooting after they're crippled to prevent the staggering effect from canceling their landing.
---
You transfer them to an alt with help from a friend and start collecting more.
---
What platform?
---
PC
---
No problem! I also just realised you're the channel who made the video about the Asylum dresses! I managed to get forest dress from your video! Im going to give you a sub!
---
Serendipity can only do so much for my 1 endurance bloody pistol build.
---
At least I can one shot legendary scorch beasts with any further buffs.
---
Eventually it will be like 4. Lots of hate from people who don’t play it until something new comes along to hate on. Now the FO4 subreddit is a nice place to be with people who really play the game.
---
Are you playing a Bloodied build?  Protocols is usually a bloodied thing.
---
On PC - would be happy to take a plan off anyone's hand for &lt;3k....
---
Buy serums from players selling at a low price, and then sell them to the vendorbots for 400c-500c with decent charisma or chems. I've got my main toon I play on, and the others are just cap mules.
---
Awesome, ill try it
---
Yeah, you're 'getting' max caps per day, but you're spending 600 (at OPs price) of those 1400 to do it. You are making far less caps than someone who doesn't pay 40% as overhead on their vendor items. If you are looking for minimum effort caps, that's fine, but a single run through West Tek (or whatever you prefer) takes just a few minutes..
---
Sometimes you'll find other players selling them in their machines for 200ish, it's an easy flip for you to make profit.
---
No, no you're right, I'll go ahead and remove this post until after the game is fixed lol
---
It’s always fun and games in a scorchbeast Queen fight when I’m sneaking around firing my bloody pipe pistol/rifle into her and three vans appear out of nowhere around me.
---
That would be awesome of you
---
I've had a lot of people do it. Sometimes it's people who won't run Class Freak (you'll know these cause they're buying lots of Empath, Adrenal, etc).  Others are just looking to flip, either to the bots or in their own vending machines. Honestly I don't care as long as stock moves and I make money. 
---
Had one guy buy 50k worth one day. Spent near max on one character, and I hurriedly shuffled caps while he came in on another to do the same.
---
Thx.  and yes, it was indeed a rush :)
---
Not my problem of they don't understand or don't care about that. I made my profit.  How they wish to make theirs is their business alone. The only time I've ever intervened in this behavior is with friends.
---
Lol you got downvoted, looks like people really do care about caps.
---
I have never bought a Serum for more than 400 caps (they are usually listed for 300 in vendors), which has been crazy helpful. I never understood why people sell them cheaper than what you get from robot npcs, but thanks to that I have been able to get lots of mutations I wanted.
---
Sure I could just buy them and then sell them for more caps but that doesn't sit right with me. I like how affordable so many player vendors are, it really makes the game more enjoyable for me. 
---
I'm really thankful for all the 300 caps serums I bought, and to people who sells missiles and grenade ammo for 1 cap each. I don't know how people do it but it really helps me a lot.
---
Well at least in my experience I get it to work. If I get bored and find someone with the mutation I go for it and even when they’re passive the mutation damages me and hostility initiates
---
Also no need to downvote lol we’re just having a convo here
---
They're not "taking advantage of you" they are in fact letting you have part of their daily vendor limit. It's actually good for you as you're making a sale you otherwise wouldn't have.
---
Perhaps not the armor itself but the types/levels of enemies you are fighting?
---
stronger armor, lets Do the mire instead of the ash heap....
---
that sort of thing ?
---
changing weapon may do it, too.  If I switch to all rise instead of my trusty switchblade, then I will die When I face the golf clubhouse mob.  Back to the switchblade, I survive.
---
Never had it work on someone in passive, and it's kinda douchey to assume I'm the one who downvoted you.  I'm not.
---
I understand the point you're making, but given recent events within the game, you could say I'm more of a casual player now. The game isn't worth it to spend any more time than absolutely necessary to achieve my goal, even if im diluting my overall cap return. Not to mention I'm at Max caps on all my characters. Time to spend more I guess.
---
The problem with it not being cosmetic is that Bethesda told everyone they could that the game would be cosmetic only. Zenimax launched ESO so they knew what they were getting into, and rather than err on the side of caution by saying "it's our intention to keep it cosmetic only", they coveted good press which ended up being misleading.
---
So sick was I of having a low weight build, I bought 1st on the weekend just to store junk. I free up enough space to move from excavator with the 200lb bonus, to ultracite with far superior damage resistance. The tent allows players to scrap junk at will, so it's not p2w, but it's pay to remove inconvenience. Not to mention, if I am PvPing, being in better armour is unquestionably an advantage.
---
This was requested often in the past and is the reason why we have display cases now.
---
Free placing junk will likely never happen on Adventure Mode, but may happen eventually on private worlds.
---
That’s why you look at Sentinel and Cavalier. Along side potentially “Slayer” armour
---
Oh my PC can def run it. I originally got it on PS4 and it runs like poo. Was thinking of picking it up again recently but I don’t think I can deal with the PS4 performance again and was thinking of going for the PC version. Do they have official ultra wide support? Also don’t think I want a sketchy key. Thought the game was cheap why is it still $40 on PC?
---
Not sure if I have the Pic anymore. But it's slightly east of mothman town. Right below marigold pavilion
---
If they bought a lot, I don't know if you'd get a refund. I've heard, but not been told by Bethesda myself, that you can't "unlearn" Atom Shop plans. If there were a lot of them I doubt they'll refund the atoms. 
---
Regardless, you should change your password ASAP. It shouldn't be one you use elsewhere either. If it's compromised on one platform, it then becomes compromised on all the others that use it.
---
I also agree there needs to be some added protection when an account signs in from an unusual IP.
---
I really just save up all of my chems and food and sell it at like 5 caps a piece
---
Exactly
---
Then their doing their job :3
---
Hahaha we are going places people mc Donald's drive thru it looks absolutely amazing good job
---
Because they do not have starched genes2....
---
or 
---
i Have to swap out cards when I craft.  If...  no... when I forget to reequip starched genes2, the pop a diluted radaway i lose a mutation.    
---
I should know better,  but it happens.    
---
   
---
for That reason, I try to keep several on hand.
---
So then have a membership program that rewards players awesome cosmetics and is centred around keeping the game thriving, rather than panhandling and disadvantaging the balance of the game for people who don't pay
---
I use a Bloodied powerfist  40% more power attack with coils on it and some unyielding and get about 2-3k damage, no food or drugs. I like it better than my Bloodied Supersledge with 40%. Costs less cards too for only about 400 less damage.
---
How about 100 atoms instead?
---
I sometimes use a crossbow in crowded open areas to tag and not kill enemies.
---
i usually have a good sniper in my team so they are usually free kills
---
To quote Rohand, King of Ragers
---
&gt;This is a good fucking game!
---
I’m speaking to everyone in general with the downvotes. The ones who downvote but don’t input their own opinion lol
---
Not the plan, but yesterday I picked up a marine dense chest mod in the same room you drop tech data, and found some other type dense mod looting in top of the world....
---
So don't. Play something else or find another hobby.
---
My PC could def run it too, but it ran like poo. ~~Bioware~~ Bethesda Magic. But not everyone had that issue so it might just be me and it would run well on your PC.   
---
I have no info about official decent ultra-wide support at this point, and as for not wanting a sketchy key, yeah, that could be a good idea too. My point was to give you an additional option of how to try this (or another) game out for cheap, at a cost of a few downvotes for myself, no intention to encourage you on doing so.  
---
Why is this still $40 on PC? For that I have no answer :)
---
I’d keep it for a bit, test it out, and decide based on its performance.
---
Better to store them or lock them up. Others can still use them even if they're powered off. Adding power only makes them appear on the map.
---
Not many chicken farmers around here....;)
---
This is a complete load of shit
---
Depends on ur charisma but yeah
---
If you're not on the map you're not likely to get traffic. If they're just behind a locked door people can still clip to them when the base is loading in piece by piece.
---
Also it just kinda wastes people's time to show up to your camp for the vendors only to be blocked from them.
---
Aw thank you very much! Also I’m so glad I could help u get a dress 😃
---
I would prefer if it was on Steam that’s where my version of ESO is. I’ll probably wait for another sake or something if my only option is really to get it on the Bethesda store, seems to also be $40 at stores for the PC version as well.
---
Hahaha thank you very much 😄
---
Really depends on your locale. My old camp spot got lots of foot traffic that was just passing by. They weren't fast traveling directly to me, but a very close by travel location. 
---
Obviously locking them up is in addition to removing yourself from the map.
---
Except the person who got banned A) got banned for using exploits multiple times, and B) never actually reported the exploits he was using, so Bethesda's decision to ban the account was not only totally 100% beyond a shadow of a doubt justified, but also following the exact terms of use policy that you agreed to when you install the game. You can try to argue otherwise, but that makes you the insane one.
---
Ok Boomster
---
SomeBODY...
---
Great, now we are gonna have hordes of furries running around in teddy bear outfits thanks to your joke
---
The world was gonna roll me
---
Scarecrow with turret arms.
---
You can borrow my Fat Man and 50 mini nukes if you want :p
---
Because the scarecrows work. You're welcome
---
Bonus points if we can mod it to kick mole rats in the face.
---
I mean it's just like rain, but slower and different looking
---
Damnit u/gemmagemini now my daughter wants cheeseburgers AND she wants to ride the kitty ride AND she wants a teddy. THANKS.   
---
(I love your build, great job and fun video).
---
Last time I saw the "F76 on steam" discussion was a lot of people having high doubts of Fallout 76 coming to steam at all at any point. There is no info about 76 coming to steam and no F76 page on steam either. An average conclusion was "steam wants nothing to do with this shit", but people might as well be wrong.
---
Although personally I'd indeed say the best time to play Fallout 76 is when it most likely comes to steam (never), you might want to do it anyway.
---
I honestly haven’t had a crash since i came back to the game two weeks ago.
---
Started a new character who is level 70ish now (and I wasn’t power levelling).
---
Touch wood my luck continues BUT it is so much more stable and polished than it was at release.  (As it should be!)
---
Not if u only log in for 10 mins a day and cant be bothered to farm stuff to sell or if u  have alt chars u barely play
---
Not since July.
---
I dont risk it anymore.
---
After wasting money on it I would kill myself if we at least didn't get like a free month of the subscription or something. However yeah, I think it would be a good idea.
---
Because you can't get a Fixer roll from the Purveyor without knowing the plan.
---
That's the only dog type I've ever seem there...
---
Yeah, I think players who bought it should get 60 dollars worth of subscription or something
---
No idea how to do it. But that sounds like an awesome idea
---
You're mad because you're bad at math?
---
They are around.  I’ve only found one person doing it though.  Most seem to have everything else.
---
As someone who owns the PA edition on PC and PS4, I might be a little salty about it as far as Adventure World goes. Might be a good thing for NW though. Pretty much a madhouse (pc) over there anyway.
---
I find them in suitcases at train stations often, check there
---
No I don’t think they will nor they should. Christmas is around the corner and with wastelanders over head they stand to gain a lot in sales and so looking past that when could they switch to free-to-play without receiving a hailstorm of flak. That’d be a risky business move
---
Hahahaha brilliant, I hope she gets them all 😂😂😂
---
Hell
---
thanks.... it works great
---
Ps4?
---
Yes, it will give an increase in the player base and MTX earnings.
---
There will be a deafening roar of those who'd paid a full price for that which could ruin a company's reputation, but Bethesda would not worry about that for what is dead may never die.
---
Yes
---
Not sure why there are multiple threads on this topic suddenly, but anyway, it is unlikely to happen in the near future. At most there will be occasional free weekends, and free subscription weeks, similarly to ESO. And if somehow the game did end up going F2P, I do not think that would necessarily be good, first, the monetization would most likely be increased further (lunchboxes), second, banned dupers and cheaters could just create another account for free and continue duping or cheating.
---
This is a terrible idea. You think Bethesda is a pariah now...
---
Which part of this game hasn't sucked till now?
---
Contact support and see what they say
---
Good point it should be Fallout 1st exclusive.
---
Most of my experiences with it, personally. The world, the storyline, the crafting loops, the side quests and locations, the sense of scale and danger, the fact that almost every interaction with another person is unique, my experience with how the game runs has been really smooth recently.
---
Also the people and friends I met
---
have them think its a person and get them to yell at it to come out and fight
---
They would have to give paying customers a good amount of stuff and not just atoms.
---
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed...
---
"It look like human, but don't smell like human...!"
---
You gonna buy out their share or what? Like you said, Bethesda gets very bad press so I doubt anyone is willing to pay much to buy zenimax out of their ownership.
---
haters gonna hate, ain'ters gonna ain't.
---
Excellent summary!
---
Upvote
---
Dailies, weeklies, Ammo run, occasional SBQ, wondering why there's not interesting content for solo players when the whole game to that point allowed me to solo.
---
Wouldn't it be great if it went all Jeepers Creepers on their lizard ass...
---
It's all that double stitching with each pocket that's added.
---
Ever see a pair of tight pants tear at the pockets? Me neither.
---
It never crashes when I am NOT doing something important.
---
The Bethesda launcher its not on steam or epic if that’s what you were hopieng
---
As I said before, this is a scam. There is zero insurance against you getting robbed &amp; zero ramifications for anyone that might scam you.
---
You're a fool who deserves to be robbed if you buy into this.
---
Have you duped your camp? (Accidentally)
---
Check the stored bar when you go to build node
---
This game literally has two side quests, both of whoch are fetch quests. True, the writing in the MoM quest is good, but the one with the lost kid is terrible.
---
I've played this game from launch too. You truly believe that Fallout 76 is a perfect game, that has excellent gameplay and and is bug free?
---
If you are max caps, you may use serums frequently to eliminate negative effects (empath, herd mentality)
---
They are taking your stuff and selling it for a higher price
---
Vault raids if you haven’t already. If you don’t have the armor from these then you still have A LOT of grinding left.
---
Didnt know that was a thing, I'll check when I'm done smoking. I'm seriously frustrated right now. Thank you!
---
How's your budget? Do you have any camps items in stock?
---
No. The gloves come off for unethical monetization when a game is free. It’s already going too far.
---
The Blueprint budget says %58. I'm not sure what you mean by "in stock", but its all built I just tried to move it. Thanks for any help.
---
If you want to be tanky, you'd prefer combining "reduce x% damage from y" and damage/energy resistance instead of just maxing the resistance.
---
She was looking kinda dumb
---
Fallout 4 is a way better game than 76.
---
Yo, anyone need loot, I have all legendarys 150caps no matter the star, plans at most 10 caps , my gamertag is Major Mittens S
---
It's no good people whining about Bethesda charging us for our ideas...if we didn't put them out there the game would never improve! Yes I totally agree we should not be charged for functional stuff and they should include it in game and ONLY sell skins in the Atomic Shop. But trying to discourage people with great ideas from posting them isn't gonna help the game become better.
---
I'm at 800+ mostly play nuclear winter now
---
Kinda because it deserved it
---
outer worlds was good but way too short took me less than 20 hours to play every mission and side mission from the day of release
---
Just run around the zone for awhile, collect some flora, they start spawning.
---
Honestly I am astonished no Fallout game so far has had the option of a Ghoul player character. I guess it has never made sense with the origin stories, but that would be an easy fix every time.
---
It literally has more than two though?
---
Fairly far from perfect, I wouldn't call it that. Theres a bunch of stuff I'd change. Passable if not good gameplay. My melee hits don't land sometimes which totally blows but it works most of the time and I'm ok with that. It's FULL of bugs, thankfully not too game breaking on my part these days so nothin to stress about
---
My girlfriend is a way better companion then any in fallout 4.
---
This, i've done 20+ nukes on private so far and it's always just a matter of running around inside the zone for a while.
---
It just seems that if there's more people on the server, the spawner is more aggressive and fills the area faster.
---
No. The base game has two side quests.
---
Wild Appalachia added a few more which are just "go here, kill ghouls, pick up that note".
---
Most of the events are also very underwhelming. Some like Encryptid are challenging but get boring again because Bethesda has no sense of balancing.
---
With her finger and her thumb
---
The game uses AWS so you will only ever see flags from your home country unless you get invited to group by someone who lives far away.
---
In the shape of an L
---
I log in, check other player's camps and raid workshops for like half an hour and then I go play other games.
---
I don't think I've tried jumping on one. Can you ride it around?  :-)
---
Seems everyone missed your /s somehow.
---
You are one lucky SOB 
---
I’ve done it probably 5 times in last 2 weeks and nothing.
---
Same on Xbox.
---
If you have 58% and your building is already built, then adding another 58% will go over the build limit.
---
The only way to move your camp is to spawn on a server where someone has his camp on the same place. Otherwise you need to stock or delete the entire camp after you registered it as a blueprint (be sure you selected everything).
---
**Thank You!** I was trying to build with a blueprint not the stored selection. Once I used the stored selection it worked.
---
How does that make 76 a better game? I didn't even talk about companions. The core gameplay of 76 sucks. If your argument for playing 76 is that it allows you to talk to your girlfriend, then just talk to her IRL? Why do I need an overpriced chatroom skin for that?
---
Yeah most youtube'rs not put more that a couple hours into the game and like to talk shit for clicks, one I was watching was only level 9 one year later, I like the game even with it's faults now at level 168
---
I do this when at full caps
---
Great question. I guess when you actually say it out loud it sounds dumb: dailies, junk runs, buy plans, perpetually decorate and remove your camp. SBQ, endevour to level up all the perk cards
---
But it’s more fun than it sounds in the moment I guess. Also the thought of wastelanders does linger in the back of our brains
---
Guessing I just suck then? 😅
---
I figured it out Thank you for your help.
---
No one with a camp near WS train station prices their shit reasonable. It’s the worst kept secret in FO76
---
Vault raids
---
2000+ hours in over here, challenges are a thing to do, main quests, side quests, and daily/regional events.
---
My girlfriend is a buggy mess but I still love her
---
Donate to the poor... me...
---
Id agree at launch but it’s constantly gotten compounded hate even after vast improvements
---
Fallout 76 and Anthem are two games that gave so much entertainment despite the fact that I never paid for them.
---
Seriously, every next article related to any of those games is more hilarious than previous one.
---
IS the fun never gonna end ? :D
---
It has a lot in it.
---
It just seems empty because there is no life anywhere but enemies.
---
...sort of like fallout 3 and fallout 4 actually.
---
3 just felt so empty to me compared to elder scrolls games.  The settlements were so lack lustre.
---
4 wasn’t as bad as 3 in that regard in hindsight.
---
It had diamond city, the institute, the BoS, a few small farms, and the atom cats.
---
76 is just even emptier.  I’m all for exploring but they need to break it up a bit.
---
I get player camps were/are meant to do that, and to some point they do how since there is a reason to go to them...but they are still lifeless.
---
I have my Quad auto railway up for sale.  Why?  I also have a Vampire and Bloodied (both auto) with FFR.  Almost as fun as my Quad explosive fletchettes harpoon gun.
---
Also want to mention I’m a solo player without a mic (at the moment). The raids look fun. I’ve only done the first one. Wastelanders isn’t going to come out when they said it would so there goes that pipe dream for now.
---
I'll agree that the balancing is kinda whacko
---
Fetch quests aren't great
---
I enjoyed the side quests to build excavator armour and the stuff with the motherlode. The quest to become mayor of watoga was pretty cool, and I still haven't got through the free states tracking unknowns side quest
---
If you are changing your password and somebody is still logging into the account then there's something else going on, like you have a keylogger on your computer sending all the information somewhere. Because that's just not possible.  Something is amiss here
---
Ticks already bug me.  :-)
---
I wouldn't stop playing if they added them, but I REALLY don't like spiders.
---
The Mayor for a Day quest is *also* a fetch quest!
---
You had to many turrets maybe?  Blueprint from a resource?
---
What do you need? What’s your build? I’m not opposed to being generous but I am putting the god roll legendaries for sale on GameFlip to pay for 1st.
---
Who doesn't want to be a junkie murder hobo, I can get with that.
---
haha, thanks for testing this sorta thing out man. Issue is it'll most likely change again like it did in the first months the game was released. Bethesda really doesn't like people knowing the exact stats of the gear they're crafting.
---
Good to know, thank you.
---
Play Death Stranding.
---
Well
---
You're assuming that I wouldn't instagib some poor fool with my Unstoppable Monster.
---
If you have already been there and it did not trigger you might be able to make another character and walk there ( fast traveling to a friend can break it). It may or may not work since these challenges are still pretty buggy, especially beckley.
---
I have the same issue (PC) maybe the game is prejudice against people with the word Heretic in their name 🤔 🤘
---
It's lore in the sense that Bethesda owns the IP, and what they say goes. I don't know about purchasable or unlockable cosmetics, like the Liberty Prime PA skin, or the Atom Cats missile launcher skin.
---
Why hello there! I haven’t seen any other heretics before...
---
more like the 10% and all of their friends  so basically 60% + of all people who still play the game
---
Must be.  I've found them a few times but it could be more random now.
---
More content from skyrim? No thanks.
---
regardless of why this sounds more fun then playing through the whole game again at this point i have made 5 toons and completed it with each one
---
Their Player icons and outfits
---
The years start coming and they don't stop coming
---
cos they have analisies from PRO MARKETING TEAMS!!!
---
If  you look at my link to the evidence you can clearly see the "Ranger" player icon lol
---
even before the fight they continuously attacked my camp.
---
Probably for 1200 atoms
---
nope
---
Bloodied swing speed +1 strength meat hook is the best weapon. Down side goodluck on finding it or have a lot of caps, 556 and/or trades😅
---
Deathclaw gauntlet or death tambo. Both have their strengths and weaknesses. Scorched generally have death tambo. For the deathclaw gauntlet you will need plans to craft.
---
already have
---
I'll take a McCramburger and a nuka cola and a tatoe fries
---
Main game? Yes its canon. Atom shop items are not. I dont know about Vault 51 and its rewards (Hellfire Armor etc).
---
Unless a future work directly says it isn't, 76 is canon.
---
Well... I never use mods, I play solo, so I don't have any in-game friends.
---
I'll try to check NW map and see what happens.
---
Nukashine, always Nukashine
---
The main quest is longer and has more dialog in 76, workshop defenses are more exciting then settlement defenses because your base can actually be destroyed, and public events are more fun and varied then radiant quests. Monster mash with random players trying to kill you is legit more intense and exciting then anything in 4.
---
Nuclear winter mode, sure. Make that free, i dont care.
---
But everything else? Adventure mode? Survival mode (if it ever comes back)? Hell no.
---
Main quest is longer? Are you insane? It feels longer because it needs way more grind. It's waaaaay shorter than 4.
---
i got the outcast paint and more :p
---
Exactly my point yup 👍🏻
---
The most skilled can fly
---
Nah its to late for that, seems like Bethesda have no clear direction for this game from the start
---
I got my backpack large capacity plan way back in April. I recently started grinding for all the badges and I have had a great time. Brought me back to many old locales.  I like digging treasure maps once in awhile too.
---
Thanks, I'll go check them out
---
Very Good.
---
For sure, but if you’re maxed it’s 500.
---
Why would their be a cap on atoms? You don’t need to worry about inflation on atoms.
---
I've only done three solo in private server but plan to do more.   I abandoned the server too soon in frustration once.  But like we both said, they will spawn eventually. And you can tag/ loot every single one of them because you are likely the only one there.  It's great for farming materials to stabilize flux with.
---
How about trapdoor spiders that pop out of the ground and try to snatch you up when you walk by lol
---
Those are not melee weapons. They are unarmed. The Combat Knife is the best melee weapon in the game. As for location they are everywhere and you want a +40% speed one. ;)
---
You absolutely can get BOS PA paint from turning in technical data. Not a myth.
---
Lmao nice one. Keep it up!
---
Oof you got a long way to go man. The fixer is bis for Rifle. The event the plans drop from no one does it anymore so people have jacked the price up. Some reason its more rare then the scout mask if you try to buy. And scout mask is a 0.01% drop
---
They could do what wow did and make it so that you could play the first x levels free.
---
Could also make it so that anyone who subscribed to f1 would get the game itself free to promote f1 subscriptions.
---
I like the collectrons monotone jokes but I can't talk myself into buying it. Still bugs me the put it in the atom shop. Not bashing anyone that did though.  I honestly would have bought it even if it didn't collect junk. It would be nice having a pal at camp. Kinda hoping you can soon buy pets for your camp. Need a dog!
---
On passive it doesn't work. I have idiots try and attack me and it does nothing. Off passive possibly.
---
Lol just reinstall fo4, use the wake me up mod and change the game around. Lol
---
Fallout 4's main story has several different endings. You can do all that in less time to do than 76? Also, you can run to the Enclave quest in 76 and get it done in a few hours and beat the game. 76 has a bigger map, that's why it takes longer to explore.
---
See if you can trade or buy an Unstoppable Moster from someone on the mark et. There are plenty of them since it was a weekly reward. It’s a bloodied power attack DCG. If you don’t like bloodied, go for inst or aa.
---
I usually do a Run on Blackwater Mine and collect all the Shotguns/Missile Launchers from the Mole Miners to sell at the Station using Hard Bargain 2 Perk Card. 1100 Caps for 20 minutes work.Unless someone hit it just before me.Easy money.
---
Intentional spreading of misinformation. Embarrassing.
---
Wait for Wastelanders to come out
---
I understand the precautions. I was mainly pointing it out in case you didn't know... I still visit camps I find that aren't on the map
---
It not only extends the durability 'as far as it will go', it also makes the armor indestructible.
---
I thought it had been patched, I guess it has been reintroduced.
---
This is not the same as the current bug that prevents armor degradation, this is something that it was in the game since beta.
---
The greed for money is steering this game down a road that is bad for the franchise and Bethesda.  If they would work on making a superb product before monetizing every last little thing, I think FO76 would be in a much better place. This game has an insane amount of potential and it frustrates us who love it to see things going this route.
---
There's already a sheep outfit and the Mr. Fuzzy head.
---
And armor made out of a bunch of post-apocalyptically salvaged teddy bears glued together would be more unnerving than fetishistic. Especially if it were just the heads.
---
I know Bethesda and their brand ambassadors really are these days.
---
To be honest of I had it I'd use it in those fights xD But I'd only take a few shots then jump out and in the suit now and then.
---
I simply can not complete the Challenges for this.
---
No idea why.
---
I have completed 92 % of the Game.
---
I activate the Tadpole challenges there is nothing ever showing on my Map.I travel to the locations,nothing.
---
The only thing i can do is the daily repeatable Stings and things.
---
Any ideas ?.
---
Thanks in advance.
---
I have done all the Computer exams.
---
Damn I thought I got a deal buying it for 3k lol.
---
I've thought this for months, getting groups of level 50's in game can cost you all your Stimpacks, armour and ammo if they have no damage and die easily 
---
I joined a SBQ event with ten+ level 50's and they couldn't even get it's health to 75% in 24 mins, and died more than I've had hot dinners
---
His Gemini games?
---
...there ya go
---
It's a private SESSION. I want private SERVERS with permanent co-op camp.
---
To me it's not worth it even with the atoms.
---
lol eww
---
Yes it is canon
---
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
---
It is a unique Combat Rifle.
---
"Where's the dip? Or am I looking at him...?"
---
No, trying to be a tank, so all maxed on offense/defense with big guns.  I got the impression EP is like auto-stimpack in a way, without the actual stimming, but it'd give me another second to bash H.  That's what's sort of funny, before I'd hear me go deaf a little, I'd be at maybe 20%, and know to hit H, ... now I go almost totally deaf, am at like 5% if that, and it's sudden.  So sounds like yeah, I'm just misusing it.
---
you can beat fallout 4 in a little over an hour, so a few hours is still longer.
---
You should really consider using mods, especially QOL ones. Some of them may even make you question how you've been playing without them.
---
Definitely wasn’t talking to you so when you wanna be a dick do it right and say “his Gemini games?”
---
While this is a cool concept I doubt it will ever happen.  All it would take is one troll, filling his camp with junk to cap, and then throwing a grenade causing a physics lag fest and crashing the server.
---
It could be, I doubt anyone really knows the exact algorithms on how they level, and people being somewhere before you throws it all crazy (especially at WS), so maybe they're just a little higher and I'm not aware of it.  It just seemed too coincidental that this started when I switched armors, and more than once.  I'm going back to using Excavator for a bit and see what happens.
---
Also I hate to say I prefer it, the T-51 is just so meh after all these years of it, and is ugly without paint or whatever (I didn't have enough atoms at the time for the horsemen skins).  The Excavator is a very new design and interesting... but you're also a giant metal banana, so that works against it.
---
I feel like I remember discussion about being able to play as a ghoul in the time leading up to the Fallout New Vegas launch. But I also remember something about drivable vehicles so maybe I’m fabricating memories lol.
---
Edit: found a link for [why you can’t play as a ghoul in NV.](https://www.quartertothree.com/fp/2017/09/13/came-close-playing-ghoul-super-mutant-fallout-new-vegas/)
---
As much as I want the scap box I'm not paying a subscription for such a basic feature
---
not our problem?
---
Cram everything you can into that box for the next month.  Then, live the easy life of not "needing" to farm for mats for a few months.
---
I'll definitely take that into consideration, thanks a lot :)
---
Ok, legitimately could probably find a Chinese flag in the secret base, but with what China is doing in meatspace, I wouldn't encourage Bethesda to do anything that isn't purely denigrating to the Chinese government.
---
Hey, I got a dc while I got a bloodied laser and a mutant's fixer from purveyor so I lost both. Support won't even refund me the scrip.
---
Those challenges don't give you quest markers. You have to find and do the challenges. You can track them though!
---
Does your box just disappear when your subscription ends? If so wouldn't it just eat the scrap with it?
---
They fixed it like 2 months ago.
---
Brain gets smart, but your head gets dumb
---
I have done it everytime it shows up on my screen, and have never gotten a badge. Some people do, some dont. RNG is usually against my favor in this game...
---
i wear it because it raises my non min maxed damage.  as long as you dont go complete ape shit with a minigun or autoshotty its not bad if it happens at all.
---
source: my raid group(s) have 6 people with full sets, laying on stacks. the only weapon causing lag is my friends TSmini.  even myself going apeshit with a semi combat shotgun does not cause it
---
Check under the world challenges. Each of them are them are tracked individually in that section.
---
cheers man
---
I feel you, I had it gifted to me for the month because I'd really like to have that ranger outfit lol. The scrapbox I believe should be available to everybody after another month so technically the first players did in fact get it first lol
---
I wonder what price they'll sell this at in the atom shop...
---
yeah i used to get em pretty consistantly bud now i havnt and some times i dont even get caps
---
That's an any% speedrun, you moron, using glitches.
---
Glitches in 76 makes quests unbeatable, mostly in the Free States line. So by your logic. 76 has infinite quest time?
---
Also, your stats come from howlongtobeat, which uses times posted by users. Fallout 4 has been out for 4 years, and people have found ways to optimize the gameplay time. 76 has been out for a year, and the glitches and crashes make it impossible to play the game smoothly. Also where did you pull the stat about 76 having more dialogue? Have you even played Fallout 4? The game has sooo much replayability, even outside the questlines. And 4 has many, many more sidequests than 76. It has waaaay fewer glitches than 76 and most of them can be modded out, unlike 76. 4 is just objectively better, and your blind love for Fallout 76 doesn't change anything. Every critic score disproves your claim. And just because a game is longer, doesn't make it better. 76 again artificially pads out game play time by level locking quests and items. Eg. Miner Miracles cannot be completed before level 25, which requires meaningless grinding. Quests have no level scaling, meaning unless you grind for days for better weapons, you cannot complete the game without the help of others. The entire game is artificially made long, without any actual, meaningful gameplay being involved. A game doesn't need to be long for it to be considered good, games such as Fallout 1 and The Outer Worlds are shining examples of that.
---
You can withdraw from it, not add after the sub ends.
---
My understanding is that your scrap box, after you do not renew, becomes a one way street. Whatever you put in is there, but you can not put anything else in. Withdraw only.
---
Maybe it's just coincidence, but i used to never have a scarecrow, and my crops were always targeted, and then after I built one, my crops were destroyed less frequently.
---
I quite like collecting scrap when I need it. There's no rush to play this game. Take it easy, save ya money.  😊
---
Every freaking time I've played that damn Sheapsqush impostor event...im so ticked off I didnt even bother to look up the actual event name! I bought the key card, got my team together, and right before we beat it I get a blue screen! A BLUE SCREEN! right before we kill it. So I get NOTHING. This has happened so many times. The only time it didnt is when someone else started the event and I cought the last of it. ☹
---
I have never gotten any from my many runs of Campfire Tales.
---
I wouldn't even mind paying a one off $20 for the scrap box everything else from first don't interest me
---
And here I was just about to find a group to do Vault 94 with for the first time to start my journey to get that set.
---
Seems to be fast fire explosive guns cause the issue.  Each hit causes a small puff of poison damage.  When raining down thousands of round per minute the single puffs become a cloud.
---
10$ fucker 🥴
---
I've run it everytime I see it, never got a single one.
---
It stacks. Captainoob did a piece on it, but it’s in a random weapon review. With 4 or 5 pieces equipped, he could saunter through Wes Tek and the muties would literally bump into him and wander away.
---
But that's how Reddit works, people downvoting conversations between two people etc. Your presumption that I wanted to be a dick indicates to me that you're easily offended at punctuation and spelling jokes. Try discovering what a comma is used for.
---
With Stings and Things and Operation Tidy you wont get a on screen notification of the badge. After they fixed it i got 3 badges (the last 3 i needed) from those two events but i had to check it on a scout vendor (the pipboy sometimes doesnt display them either).
---
I've done camp fire tales a bunch of times since patch 14 and got nothing from it
---
They might come back though, Fallout and Bethesda hate still makes those $$$
---
It's 1h melee and unarmed...
---
Ya know it causes lag for the person using it too
---
ty is it hte same with campfire?
---
neather its kinda suss
---
Don't Know. Sorry haven't ran Campfire in a long long time.
---
It could well be.
---
 A Meat Hook is an unarmed weapon. Not a melee weapon.
---
Bethesda are listening to the community so this will be comming as a fallout first exclusive perk soon.
---
all good
---
It is affected by 1h melee perks as well as unarmed, therefore it is both
---
I do those guys daily, and have also never gotten a badge. My PitBoy always says 0 for me. I wouldnt be surprised if it is bugged out for me. The whole quest was bugged for me, why wouldnt the rewards.
---
how bout the dailies?
---
actually not usually. Most are arrested. Others are said "work with us or we'll arrest you".  
---
Source: I'm in computer science.
---
The Scrapbox genuinely changes the overarching game loop for the better, and although they probably won't, I'm of the opinion that it should be given to everyone simply because of this.
---
Also, I thought I had been managing my Junk reasonably well, but even I shaved off a good 200 WT.
---
So much to do
---
thats so poor on beths part people need them badges and thats the only decent way to get em
---
I mean I don't blame the Beth Devs, I blame the people in charge.
---
Ive gotten 4 from the less than 10 runs ive done since the patch.
---
I received one a few weeks ago.
---
Bethesda are listening to your feedback. Expect this to be a fallout first exclusive perk soon.
---
The dailies are great, I run both everyday. Sometimes I get nothing from either. Sometimes they both hit, other times, just one.
---
It's fixed. I've gotten em from campfire tales and the dailies in the last two weeks. It's just on par with rare rewards it's not a guarantee
---
Im only a level 69 but my other hobbies have taken over. I feel like the subreddit could benefit the community and filter out all the drama that blocks my feed.
---
ill run the dailies more and do the event and see what happens i guess
---
thanks heaps i appreciate it
---
What's your cap farming method?
---
It does sometimes take awhile to get added. So I generally update the count by hopping in the machine after the event is over.
---
Just did it and got a badge. No onscreen notification.
---
i guess its just rarer now or something
---
I wish I was special... but I'm a creep... I'm a weirdooo...
---
aaah cheers for the info thats annoying
---
ill trie that for sure cheers
---
I appreciate the grind (I’ll wear my glowing skeleton forever), but I leave events if I see them there.
---
 Yes it is. It is classified as Unarmed though.
---
 I don't like Bloodied much and the Hook is strong but shares the same problem nearly all weapons have , when compared to my knives, they are too slow.  
---
 With a knife that goes out at 200, becomes 300+ almost immediately and hits maybe 3 to 4 times a sec, I can melt Ghoul Hordes. They will kill me with anything else as they are just everywhere around me and I can't hit them fast enough. My knives can kill them all.
---
This was acknowledged by the community manager about a week ago. Hopefully in the next patch update. I cant use it either and it bums me lol
---
What is crazy, is that this is for all 6 characters across 2 accounts that are bugged.
---
Ive played 2.3k hours without the mods, so I dont really need them I guess... but it would be cool to see what they're about. Id like to have the option. I do work on the badges a little bit every time I play, but it would be nice to do something easy to get one.
---
Sell guns and chems
---
I made a   when posting. here is the other version:
---
Bethesda**, I thought you were special. I thought you weren't like EA, that you cared about the people who played your game, but you don't.**
---
locking private worlds and potential modding behind paywalls? banning players for the stupidest reasons? there are bugs that were in the game when it came out, and they still haven't been [fixed.you](https://fixed.you) don't listen to the community, and all you care about is money. Bethesda is a soulless joke of a company,TODD HOWARD. think about that and make a change.
---
Because bethesda doesnt know how to make a game
---
GTA V does it and they sell a lot of shark cards, you should listen Todd
---
Vault raids...
---
I thought that's what the display cases were for. That's what I've been using them for.
---
i agree i havnt been doing it in a bit as they goofed it i was looking to do it again if it was fixed but idk
---
i never read that, i might have missed it somewhere. What i read was that his account that he tested bugs on as well as other people who tested bugs to report him, a white hat group, was perma banned through an investigation that is still ongoing. What i read was that he never used any cheating programs with the account that was banned. So maybe they banned his other accounts too? idk he hasn't stated anything like that, all we know is that this goes beyond using a cheat engine and its actual moderators targeting this person as they knew what account he was using and that he had tools to find bugs. It's interesting because he also states he knows bethesda mods and reaches out to them with information regarding new exploits and bugs. And i highly doubt he created map76 to do anything other than give people a resource to find items that they needed in a game where literally everything on the map can be looted all at once.
---
Why can't you loot it?
---
Sorry. Have been very busy lately. My name on on there is Aveyinc
---
If you want to bump into mine I’m across from the Nuka Cola plant usually. Looks like a converted warehouse with a bunch of clutter around it/in it. 😏
---
Why not just do the Possum challenges? I did all of them except for the chemist, only because the plasma grenade plans are impossible to get. WickedyChikady has some great video on how to do them if you get stuck.
---
It's canon, but I think we generally agree on the idea that Atomic Shop stuff isn't.  As are any specific meta elements of the game... like bombing Fissure Site Prime a million times over. 😂
---
There really isn't a whole lot that contradicts canon either.  It was clearly written with an eye toward that.
---
The game should be free. In fact, I’m tired of buying a new pc/console every few years. Want more space? That’ll cost you extra. Lag? Performance issues? We’ve got components that will fix that, but you gotta pay. These companies should all say they’re sorry and give me a hug.
---
I've gotten them since they fixed it, but it's not a very probable drop (I think it's only 15-20%).  The ideal way to get the Possum Badges is to do the other two Repeatables (the toxic waste cleanup and the insect part gathering) in addition to Campfire Tales.  Each one has a chance to reward badges.  To stay on top of the dailies, consider building a Personal Terminal in your CAMP, which will tell you when they are available.
---
Oh god damn it. Just when I was starting to think about returning to 76, yet *another* controversy happens.
---
I guess I'll go play a game that the devs *care* about.
---
I hate seeing stuff like this because it makes me want to destroy my current camp and start over. So many ideas of things to do. I may need to start a 4th character just to focus on camp building!
---
ah i see thanks for info
---
I wouldn’t consider any of that canon, just things actually found in game.
---
add me on psn: Owl_No
---
So much to see
---
I have a year membership but I really think everyone should get the scrap box and camp. I’m really in it for the atoms and private server. I can’t stand the emotes and not really a fan of the NCR outfit. If my $100.00 makes an awesome Wastelanders, I’m fine with that.
---
just bad graphics..
---
Sometimes I find I have to mash E on the Scout Leader to get him to advance the dialog, because otherwise, he just speaks in a loop.  This seems like a new bug that was introduced at the same time they did the Public Event overhaul.
---
I know that feeling, many interesting camps are lost to the ages by doing something new.
---
The 2nd account is helpful since I have all 5 characters with a different base, built using my main
---
Need to shoot it down, so rifles are the only effective way to go. If you get lucky it will hover in place long enough to get a few bursts into it, otherwise you're left chasing the damn thing around taking pot shots at it. My preference is to hunt these on public servers so others can help take it down. Once it's down everyone has the opportunity to pull the Nuclear Card (and some other loot) from it before it goes boom.
---
I've seen a number of folks who sell the Nuclear Card in their vendors as well, so it's always an option to just buy one and be done with it
---
Bought the plan from a player vendor for 1000 caps.
---
Did you happen to use a character from last years beta?
---
Oh that’s smart
---
That's an awesome build. Thanks for that.
---
😊👍😍
---
If I see cheap serums, I buy them and give them to low levels for free just to try out and mess with. I tell them how to get starched genes and to have fun 👍🏼
---
Try leveling up again
---
Yeah it's those people reporting on the anti consumerism who are bad and not Bethesda
---
I would say the core game story, characters and locations are canon, but you can leave the video game stuff, like many of the skins and references out.
---
This is usually true for any video game canon really.
---
Thanks for the advice, I hit level 105 and no luck yet :(
---
Not sure about a white-out, but the sentry bots around Whitespring or maybe the assaultrons are always causing explosions / exploding themselves in a way that I always describe as some sort of EMP: house interiors go dark, contrast goes WAY up, lasts for about 20 seconds. Totally annoying during fights with local ghoul life.
---
An actual nuclear winter without it being radioactive.... Maybe... Something the boys in the Mojave 200 years from now would want
---
Hilarious.  Your stupid link *does not work*, whereas the one I gave does.
---
Please continue to beclown yourself in public.
---
Thanks for the advice, I didn’t start playing until late August this year :(
---
1000 steps of appalachia
---
I don’t know if a permanent fix but doing as I wrote above fixes it for the current session for us each time.
---
Wake me up mod? What’s that?

I mean Start Me Up****—— here is the link

"Has fallout 76 crashed for you while doing something important?"
---
Well, no.  It's a game, nothing is "important".
---
Sorry to hear about you losing your job.  Welcome to the hobo jungle.
---
If you have Concentrated Fire, take out the boosters to slow it down. Troubleshooter weapons get a 30 percent damage boost on that little bastard too.
---
Yeah, I have seen people use those, it looks fun but I've never gotten a decent one myself. My melee guy uses power fists, DCGs and a junkies meathook
---
Ah, content drought, happens in every game, unfortunately. I recommend trying something else while you wait for another itching desire to play the game, or until new content drops. I'd recommend No Man's Sky as a similar Sandbox experience, and Warframe (Free to Play btw) if you need a new Action-RPG to try
---
Great idea except bethesda dosent care
---
Mashing E always yielded the same opening dialogue for me. I usually talk once and then loot the cabins and come back to talk again and it usually triggers the daily.
---
Sometimes it takes several minutes for the objectives to pop up on the map/compass
---
The list of excuses is endless: "I'm a melee bloodied build "I am a non-PA sniper build" and so on.  If you're not taking the pylons you're a parasite.
---
I stopped my 2nd character deals too little damage for any legendary drops at level 42
