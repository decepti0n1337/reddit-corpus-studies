A lot of people just collect them for display. I farm and sell them for fun.

---
When u can jump onto a bus to avoid being maul. Thats the beauty of this mutation
---
Interesting.  I was attacked some weeks back outside that station by a enthusiastic PvP player with a chainsaw.  I could not fast travel away because of the 'taking damage' message.  Is this a known bug peculiar to Whitesprings' Station?
---
Yep, two in a row is a good start and I agree it should be interesting to see what the ITV's have to share in early 2020.
---
Endurance and charisma are the least useful perks IMO. Here‚Äôs my heavy/explosive junkies build. Took me till about 120 to finalize it.

---
It‚Äôs only available on PC because someone pulled it out of the dev room. Once you scrap the helmet you automatically learn how to craft it so it spread around like wildfire.
---
Bethesda has already stated that they‚Äôre not going to ban people who have it because it‚Äôs so prevalent.
---
They aren‚Äôt going to fully release it in its current state because it has DR. Bethesda wants people to buy their cosmetics so they don‚Äôt want clothing and helmets to provide any stat bonuses. (With the one weird exception being the green mistress of mysteries dress)
---
Sure but then sentinels or cavs doesn't work when crouched.
---
I get that message when i am severely dehydrated.  Wasn‚Äôt terribly helpful!
---
Junkies exploding LMG and quad gamma is all I use. The LMG shreds everyone that initiates PVP with me.
---
I know which one you‚Äôre talking about and I don‚Äôt have either, sorry to get your hopes up man
---
I killed a Flatwoods monster, and he was carrying a fork.  
---
Suspiciously, I looked for a copy of ‚ÄúHow to serve Humans.‚Äù
---
No, this is a terrible idea. It's not at all like adding those previous weapons.
---
Perfect Storm is already a legendary, the others weren't. With the exception of The Fixer, they are all also completely new weapons. The Fixer also has a different look than just a regular combat rifle.
---
On top of that, why stop there then? Are you trying to say that literally every unique quest weapon should be in the Purveyor? That's even more stupid.
---
Good suggestions but you are giving too much credit to Bethesda to think that they are going to have dialogue choices and skill tests in 76. Ain't happening.
---
That and the scamming was rampant. Once the mods bailed on the sub there was nobody banning scammers so it lost its credibility.
---
I use Bobbleheads   Particularly the Big Guns and Charisma.  I use a 50 cal on the Queen so I'll sometime use it then.  I use the Charisma one for buying serum recipes and getting the max discount.  I've also had nice results from using the Luck Bobblehead at the Purveyor. 
---
I hardly ever use magazines.   They tend to be more useless.   There is one that gives you less ammo usage for big guns, but I can make a ton of 50 cal ammo.
---
It's alright and I wasnt let down! Thanks for checking!
---
Np man
---
All great ideas. Itd be a great combo with comic book store
---
A simple thing id like to see done is drop the requirement of hunter/hunted from 4 players to 2 so the pvp crowd gets a little attention too. Since they kind of got shafted on survival. 
---
Reference. I dont pvp and i hate it. But other people do and it might cut down on the attempts to grief a bit. I dont know. I do think its time to give a nod to that crowd though. Because for whatever reason they mostly hate Nuclear Winter. 
---
I enjoy NW personally. But i understand why it doesnt meet their wishes. 
---
Id also like to see sone new NW maps. Or at least a constant and consistent rotation between the two. Im no code genius by any means. But i cant imagine it being rocket surgery to do.
---
Junkies exploding everything!
---
Only 1000 rounds? That's just a Tuesday for me and my flamer.
---
Well Im sure xD
---
It seems like the Devs did an opsie... :P Live earlier than intended. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Edit: Just read the comments uh... Well if this is hackers' work, then it's best not to pick it up if you see it :0
---
I need the mods too!
---
Im going to do that! Ive got to craft my excavator armor and get calibrated shocks for it. Gotta carry EVERYTHING.
---
Thank you, I appreciate the price references!
---
And Itll send you to the moon too!
---
Next week is the update, but don't know when all this stuff actually releases
---
Ahh typos :)
---
You're looking for consistency? This is a Bethesda game.
---
 Just hotkey corn soup and your troubles are over. ;)
---
If you havent played in a while, id just start a new build. Theres been so many changes, youre gonna wind up somewhere really weird ond overweight. Lpl. I know someone else already mentioned it, but i wanted to add this. 
---
I recently started over on Xbox 1 myself. I almost deleted it but i figured id give it a shot because i did what you were talking about. I championed everything as soon as it came out so it felt like i was in a perpetual state of broken content. 
---
Starting over now, about two weeks in, only lvl 15 or so. I dont have much time to play between everything else i play for weekly requirements. But im having a ball. Its a ton of fun. And way more streamlined than the first walkthrough. It plays like a totally different game now. 
---
OP, youre making an awesome choice to start over. If i was on PS, id be more than willing to help out anytime, but alas, im on xbox.
---
I just meant clothes/apparel in general
---
Damn it I need a Satnatron!!!! I've been saving my Atoms like a good boy doing the mundane daily and weekly challenges. I've got 6420 dam it I want something to spend them on lol SANTATRONNNNNNNNN
---
Santatron is free
---
You had hours of entertainment, free items from the atomic store, seasonal quests/rewards and many other things that new players won‚Äôt have the chance to get. That‚Äôs your compensation... you don‚Äôt need to be rewarded for buying the game anymore than you‚Äôve been
---
Unless you were a Fallout 1st member and sent a ticket about losing your junk.
---
Are the Scout armors any easier to get?
---
Well that's good and bad then. Are they coming out with another Christmas bundle? I missed last year's. And when's all that awesome Commie stuff coming out man. I feel like I should save for that.
---
I wanted a robot killer. Got a pipe pistol 40% to bots plus some other shit. Wish there were more perks
---
Didn't we blow up the oil rig in FO2?
---
hah.
---
It will also make you immortal on the long run if you run ghoulish XD
---
Nah, im a super mutant, not a ghoul. 
---
I drink the green stuff, and hang out with my buddies at WestTek.
---
Oh I don‚Äôt use the atomic shop anymore since I ran out of free atoms. Must have missed it if it went back up
---
It is impossible to get to 1000+ in so little time . I have about 3000 hours , played every day lot of hours and I am level 469
---
Ohh I see. I agree. I wish bomber jacket had normal looking clothes vs the stank bos pilot uniform
---
I just want dogmeat back. I don't care what else happens I want my little buddy back on my travels. Every time I go somewhere and there's a dog house and little dog bowl I die a little on the inside. DOGMEAT PLEASE!!!!!
---
Man now I want 10 different rifles üòÇ
---
Low health with unyielding alone gives a massive strength boost
---
PA is pretty fragile in so many situations. I have a full Combat Knife build and my Bos Haevy Combat does a much better job keeping me alive, anywhere outside of a nuke zone.
---
 Still its fun to pull out the X-01 and my tiny knives and just wreck the place. I avoid populated events as I kill stuff so fast, people get upset. ;)
---
Haven't seen them move in awhile. I sold a speed demon today, haven't seen marsupial sell like it used to. It's all luck on getting new players. I like to keep adrenal, electric charge, chameleon, healing factor, marsupial, speed demon, unstable isotope, twisted muscles, and talons. Melee will buy the twisted
---
Very good point... I had never thought of that. Perhaps I should look into something like Instigating then.
---
Sad indeed...
---
Westtek is fine and all, but ghouls live far more luxuriously. I mean think about it. In F3 they got Tempeny Tower and in this game they got the Whitesrpings. The way I see it, ghouls be living the high life.
---
Does the bait grenade still bring them down? I havent fought a scorchedbeast in months. Lol.
---
For real! It's almost as if the developers almost dont see it. They need guys like the community to be theyre ear. I mean the things people come up with is insane.
---
We pretty much have to get an increase at some point.  I know that I'm going to quit buying things if I can't use them in the game.  There has to be a reasonable solution.
---
Well it's been several months since I've been on. So it's been awhile.
---
Some people said they were getting Xmas presents early. This is supposed to be a reward for Christmas event
---
Zugzwang: The only move is to delete. 
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zugzwang
---
It's got its shining moments for sure!
---
Was fighting her the other day and we actually beat her! Although right after she died I died and the game wouldn‚Äôt let me respawn so I had to close app. Didn‚Äôt get any of the loot. Still pissed.
---
It doesn't gain it's health back if not legendary. You can kill it but even with my bloodied, thx to the damage registration bug, it goes away D:
---
What weapon are you using for that?
---
oh really?  that is a much better explanation than some devroom stuff.  i guess i probably jumped the gun spending 1k caps on it but what can ya do
---
so how do i get in on these early gifts lol
---
All the help section of bethesda.net says is to wait for it to arrive at your camp before disconnecting, and that tamed animals wont respawn. Now if thats talking about death or logging out or both, im not sure. Thats the best info i can give you at the moment. Ill keep looking.
---
Yeah, the scouts are 10 steel each, so 50 total
---
Thanks!
---
Oh you mean you ran into an exploiter
---
What's that Bethesda saying? It's not a bug it's a feature.
---
B2525 Handmade. I've only had success with that. You have to be close enough so damage drop-off doesn't screw things up and you have to be accurate as you can't use VATS.
---
Yea. It has its shining moments though.. Imma hold onto it. I like the stress relief of getting lost in music and game.
---
Nice
---
I do roulette two whisky and 8 nukashine so far only one person has gotten the whisky.
---
I hate that glitch too. Its upsetting especially when you have a lot of junk.
---
Meee!
---
Lmao it prolly is.
---
If you bought it from the Atom Store it was just a skin. Go to your armor workbench and see if backpacks are listed. If not, you gotta do the proper scout quests.
---
Yes the pioneer scouts do hunter archer and athlete theyre the easiest imo
---
Haha. Thats a good idea too.
---
Find a santa scorched
---
so i just bought a Plan: mounted fox from a guys vendor, i hear this is one of the prizes you can get from a holiday box?  does that mean theyre showing up early, or that guy got em from a duper?  i learned it and crafted one in my camp, im sure thats not something they would ban for... there are plenty of other people doing egregious shit and they arent getting banned
---
Festive! I don't remember adding decapitated animal's head to my Christmas list.
---
I love when I waste ammo on a queen and it doesn't even give me loot.
---
Meh this one is a real bullet sponge. Thanks for the information :)
---
I've been wanting something like this so I can make my camp feel like a home not just a oversized shed. Also different sized mats for different sized items or just a junk tab where you could make the items or pull them straight from your stash and place them would be nice and even having the ability to place the ingredients you get from the junk being scraped like leather or hides like in fo4. But I'm sure that would make servers lag a bit more than they already do. Oh well c'est la vie.
---
I'm guessing that is the case.  :)
---
Nah that's the Presidential T-60
---
are they out there?  i thought that wasnt starting yet...
---
Christmas as well in several spots
---
They don‚Äôt survive. No player had ever initiated combat with me and survived my initial barrage. Because, person initiating is at a huge disadvantage, they do zero damage until I fire back. JE LMG has a very high DPS and they‚Äôre dead before they realize it. I wait a few seconds, give the confused emote and the other player always drops their guard and re-loads or starts walking away. That‚Äôs when I strike. There‚Äôs a few second window that allows me to fire back when its advantageous for me. I have one piece chameleon armor, so I take up a firing position and can usually get them a second time too. They can re-spawn and can get me back, but in my experience it‚Äôs always explosive handmades. Haven‚Äôt faced a quad Tesla yet.
---
My game crashed on me twice at the scorched earth event. I was able to rejoin the same server once but the second time I got kicked from the server I wasn't able to rejoin because it said it was full. I was finally able to get back in after the event was complete, but I wasn't able to retrieve any loot from the queen or the other legendary scorchbeast. 
---
I don't know if it was a hardware issue on my end that kept making my game crash or what, but it was still some bullshit.
---
As someone who has tamed MANY creatures, I urge you to not get too excited. Every single tamed I've had, has died within a week or so. Even moved to the Forest so they'd live longer, and my deathclaw still ended up dying. Unless you're there 24/7 to protect them from everything that spawns, they're gonna die. 
---
Tips to get them to live longer include, not being a vendor camp. Every time someone FTs to your base, mobs respawn, and many players don't stick around to defend your CAMP and creatures. Don't ever log out when you're at your CAMP, as it can cause your Tamed to just disappear. No matter what you do, however, it's probably going to die pretty fast. 
---
I've heard some people say they've had theirs for weeks, but unless you have it locked in your fortress (which they often spawn outside of) and are super lucky, it's just sad watching them die over and over.
---
Me too.
---
Glad I could help. With the limited number of special points we get you really have to be careful what you invest in and how. That‚Äôs also an excellent site for planning out your build and will even guide you as you level.
---
Two items a faster fire rate vampires fixer. Vampires laser Gatling gun with +50% dr wile aiming. Both on the last day but today I got a quad faster fire rate hunting rifle.
---
I agree. My internet any time over cast happens goes out for a little bit. It doesn't help the rage.
---
No you didn't?
---
And why insult me? I'm criticizing your idea, not you. Talk about immaturity.
---
Pick one class of weapons and maximize it. Trust me, you‚Äôll appreciate it later
---
They're coming as rewards for the Christmas event, apart from the SB and SBQ taxidermies
---
This ^
---
Water filter could at least make purified water in benches, and are affected with Super Duper.
---
Tons of bleached dogwood would go along well with it to make tons of purified water.
---
So basically, what im finding out is that sometimes it does, sometimes it doesnt. Nobody really seems to know what does or does not make them stay. 
---
Its roulette style. Maybe as long as your camp is in the same place it stays? Im not sure. But i believe its supposed to stay. Ive found that having the pet there does increase your spent budget. Because people were having issues with the pets dissapearing and the budget not getting fixed. But that was back in april or so. 
---
Im so Sorry i couldnt help you out more. 
---
Id say if the pet takes up budget, then its registered to the camp. That makes the most sense to me. 
---
Sometimes people have seen the pet die and were able to log out fast enough to log back in and have it be alive. 
---
So there really doesnt seem to be any rhyme or reason why it does or doesnt do something. Ive found people saying moving your actual camp kit around your camp will migrate the pet around the camp as well. 
---
I also found that deathclaws, scorchedbeasts, ans mega sloths can no longer be pets as they arent classified as animals in game anymore.
---
Gotta admit, I went into this ITV expecting to be a little disappointed, but I came out pretty hopeful. The collectron was a nice bonus
---
Welcome to Appalachia ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Guess i gotta grind harder now. Need th3m all.
---
I agree, just anticipating the inevitable shitstorm that would follow that kind of move
---
That helmet should have been released a long time ago on consoles
---
Exactly
---
It could just be because a lot of new players might not be aware of the wastelands delay.
---
yes it was novice.  So that's only on novice.. that makes sense.  ok thanks for telling me :)
---
that is a lot of can traps
---
That was it!  Yes I think my friend killed some honey beasts, I think I was still getting cricketted
---
Quad explosive wepons. My favorite is the harpoon gun absolute god mode.
---
Nice. 
---
I just love blasting through ammo, and the crazy noise, the lag, the gliching I encounter, and yea my game has crashed before too. Fun.
---
Lag is even better when you die cuz you couldn't kill the enemy you don't see.
---
When I fought the Scorchbeast queen one day, we killed it with about 7 seconds to spare but the game was still counting down after her death and we failed -_-
---
Fix your damn game Bethesda! I'm still waiting for Winter wasteland
---
If anyone is stupid enough to pvp with me I usually melt them with my Executioners Handmade and then I just leave the area to avoid the never ending loop
---
It does not work as a collectron unless you already own the collectron they answered that above.
---
I‚Äôve got a vampires faster fire rate fixer if you are looking for one.
---
The holiday gifts were duped by the thousands and left for people to pick up.
---
I run a bloodied build especially for Yao Guai. If I can kill it in one hit, it won't be able to put me in a constant stagger and kick my ass.
---
you lost today, kid. Doesn't mean you have to like it.
---
How much are you lookin for?
---
The issue that bothered me the most was, taking the workshops and building them up just to be disconnected from the server. The straw that broke the camel's back is when this happened to me five times within a 15-minute window. However this was several months ago so perhaps now it's more stable.
---
My favorite is when there‚Äôs no loot on her afterwards!
---
[removed]
---
[PC] I‚Äôm actually a collector of dev-room items, unobtainables, outfits, glitched items, legacies, and armor sets
---
I run a museum of sorts at my camp if you or anyone else wants to stop by and have a quick tour of all the weird and wacky stuff the devs let slip over this past year.
---
Most of these items are harmless but some in particular do offer massive advantages, these I opt out of using for fairness‚Äô sake.
---
Edit: Almost forgot! There is a gift shop so you can take a little something back yourself if you so desire, nothing unfair or game changing, mostly cosmetics or collectibles.
---
GT: Topmongo I‚Äôm around now if you need anything transferred
---
Please ask the devs to add some rare "junk" into the santatron, that people can use on their displays in addition to scrapping them (nuka-cola dishes, robot models, etc)
---
I like that idea
---
Only CDPR, GGG and No Man's Sky developer deserve positive cover nowadays... Or at least it seems so. Hell, there were some reports of MTX for Cyberpunk and the clickbait youtubers valiantly rode to CDPR defense. Bleh...
---
We got it!! Lol
---
Yeah I guess it's a random encounter, it's super cool, just learned about it a couple of weeks ago
---
If you already bought the backpack, it can crafted at an armor bench once the plan is learned or unlocked. Otherwise you have to go through the scout quest line.  Mod plans must be bought with badges.
---
So what's the meta for it nowadays? Iirc back when they first came out people were spamming bloodied tesla rifles or be weapons. I remember stealth being reported as just not working but then some people saying it worked. I also remember people used to go to survival servers to do raids since they're still """instanced""" but less laggy, is this still a thing?
---
i dont know if i believe that... seems awfully conspiratorial to me
---
id sooner believe that beth messed something up than that there are still enough trolls dedicating their time to this game that theres an army of them distributing items around all the servers they can get on...
---
Be glad they melt thru everything almost like all the armor and perks dont work really
---
How about when she‚Äôs finally down, you can‚Äôt look her body. It‚Äôs pretty tight.
---
is there a list of items that will be in the holiday gifts?
---
Im gonna do that on my next character..
---
We do if we want to run 3 in a row. We all do a silo at the same time then 1 drop then next person will fast travel back and drop another. Most of the time though we do it on public servers. We also nuke the entire site.
---
Banned
---
Might I ask where exactly you know me from? I rarely post here nowadays, and don't even post anywhere else too frequently
---
That makes me mad too. Especially when solo.
---
Radical man.
---
Or when it disappears entirely.
---
She's holding out on us!
---
&gt; This game needs a legit war on hackers and dupers.
---
duping is the only reason people have the firepower to do encryptid and sbq
---
5 SBQ fights last night and 4 failed to load loot :/
---
Yes!
---
IGN: FapsterOne
---
My mule is in ur world now The Bremlin he is over by the overseer camp
---
I do!!!!
---
duping is the sole reason people are still doing SBQ
---
At least death stranding didn't launch with 1m gamebreaking bugs.
---
Id love to have a CB radio in my camp. The orange one you see at like ranger stations. Obviously it would do nothing but id like it to make my camp look like an operating base of some kind
---
Second this ^
---
My character is a dude but I‚Äôll get a golf skirt from the golf course and rock that
---
*it's no use*
---
It's a Sony thing, not bethesda.
---
Yes, that quest was in the code at launch but was never released for whatever reason. Weren‚Äôt there also presidential tokens?
---
Very helpful, thank you!
---
I feel you. My two friends and my brother stop playing long time ago. So it was only me for the longest of time. Might give it another shot when the Q1 2020 DLC comes out. However I am not a fan of the "Pay to Win" mechanics that they're selling. But that's a whole nother can of worms.
---
Well then, I'll let sony fuck a duck as well.
---
Unfortunate but thank you
---
thats why you use duped weapons to end it in 5 minutes
---
It‚Äôs not Bethesda putting the game behind a ps plus paywall, that makes no sense.
---
I've had a few conduits disappear. Just placed them, went back to connect a wire and poof! Gone. Stored the wall/roof pieces cuz maybe they were just hiding. Nope, just disappeared from my camp completely lol
---
Lmao bro this goes for a lot of games Not just fo76. Most games u buy u need a ps plus to play online
---
Sure but counterpoint: toys do not contain rare junk like Ballistic Fiber, Ultracite, or antiseptic
---
You also need an Internet connection. You have to pay for that as well. 
---
And you need electricity. Need to pay for that as well. 
---
Out of ALL the things that are Bethesda‚Äôs fault... you needing PS Plus to access the game on PlayStation isn‚Äôt one of them.
---
If you‚Äôre going to gripe, make it about something that‚Äôs relevant.
---
I once got a flooring foundation stuck underwater.... twice... two different locations... Couldn't remove it or select it. Had to move my camp completely to get it back.
---
Destiny doesn't. Why can fo76 be like destiny with it's online shit.
---
You too. Don't be discouraged there is a lot of assholes but theres a lot of good folks to. Hopefully Bethesda will get it on track and they will bring survivor back when wastelanders hits and player count picks up.
---
Yeah I know. But Sony would have contacted Bethesda or something to make sure it's ok to do so.
---
You should definitely save for that
---
Its not fo76 fault? Bro thats the point of ps plus to play games online? Most games are like that
---
Now give us a free Scrap box and i will return to be active again :D
---
And what about fortnite?? That's an online only game you can play without pa Plus
---
A flat lie isn't an opinion lol, its lazy reporting.
---
Are they any good?
---
I've said this since it launched as well, for the same reasons many others have stated here. No point in repeating it. 
---
Either give novice a chance for the plans to drop or rethink the 'difficulty' aspect of the raids. This game being a fallout game, the best part of dungeons in all these games was exploring vast underground complexes together. Timers ruin this, laggy/technical issues aside. Moreover, timers are just such a lazy difficulty mechanic. I completely disagree with anyone who claims the timer is needed to keep this game interesting for the non-casuals. 
---
Want to keep the difficulty bethesda and force people to have groups? Actually introduce mechanics to your raid that will require a group to complete it. You even have a nice example in your game already - the imposter sheepsquatch. Then you increase difficulty by making the damage #'s ever higher, forcing people to use chems/crafting 'potions' to reduce/increase damage. Bethesda could even introduce crafting within the vaults that serve a specific purpose. Go wild bethesda. 
---
As it is right now, it's just beating the timer (and let's be honest, a decent amount of RNG). Most people I have come across end up soloing it anyway in some form by just skipping all the mobs and having that 'perfect build,' making the whole 'team' thing moot. There's very few groups I'd wager who play the raid as was meant to be - and even if they do, the timer doesn't make this end-game group activity enjoyable or challenging it all. It just makes it tedious. I'd love to lose to a sound difficult mechanic. I will never agree a timer preventing say, what, 75%+ of this community from acquiring premium gear or joining in on fun times in a vault dungeon is the way to go with 'hardcore' end-game content to keep the casuals out.

---
Or when you claim three workshops and put it to work for 4 hours and the game decides to crash
---
Thats literally one of the only games. Most games still need ps plus to play online. You can keep naming games that might work but most games still need ps plus.
---
F2P online games don't need PS+, it's Sony's policy.
---
Then get Fallout 4, its better than 76 in every single way and does not need ps plus
---
They have the same stats as scout. And get 3 random legendary effects 
---
Thorn adds bleed dmg to melee attacks as well as a bleed aoe from you and makes you harder to detect while sneaking
---
Solar gives you and nearby team mates (believe it was about 30 yards) healing while you are above 60% health. The heal was about the rate of a diluted stim
---
I personly found solar to be the best, as the pieces can not roll unyielding.
---
I have it and I've beat it several times. Same with all the others.
---
It‚Äôs not too late to do that, I‚Äôm 159 and have yet to finish the main quest line. Last mission is just sitting there, waiting for me. I farm good locations for experience. Those Watoga robots are aplenty, and you get quite a bit of Exp each time you mow through them. Also, you can assemble either a T45, 51, or 60 PA set from the 4 PA spans there...
---
Protip: shoot it till it's dead.
---
Ye
---
Hey man just cause he is scorched don't mean he forgot his manners here. He was carrying a fork because he never knew when his next meal would show up and it would be rude to eat it bare handed.
---
You‚Äôll never get far trying to understand game design mechanics
---
Yeah!
---
No idea how people got them, I just know some people found presents.
---
Huh, I might have to try the Solar one. Although I think the acid damage from the SH PA is just broken - but the grind is too much.
---
Everyone, this guy is the real deal. The reason I still play this game. Thank you topmongo!
---
The acid damage is nothing outside of pvp. You cna kind of see it on scorched, but everything just dies to quickly anyway for it to matter. And on the Queen it tends to piss people off so I just switch to my t51b for her
---
Yeah. Im anxious to even consider buying it.
---
I mean, It sounds like you should‚Äôve had pacifist on if ‚Äúhundreds of hours of work‚Äù and all this time you‚Äôve spent playing have been ruined irreparably in seconds
---
i really doubt that you could get banned for buying a plan ( any plan ) in a vendor machine .  Just seems very unlikely  -  think about the mass duped plasma grenade plans -  a lot of players would have been banned if that was a thing
---
that is sweet
---
You always needed PS Plus dawg...
---
You get the chance of 3 spawning at camp Adams, and 3 at sons of Dane, 1 in port a Pottys at fairgrounds
---
The comment about "Wastelanders" makes me think of one thing, do we get new map areas? O.o
---
Man you don‚Äôt even know. :)
---
Not gunna say you shouldn‚Äôt not be able to loot people‚Äôs inventories, just that it ain‚Äôt as safe as ya think. Atleast on PC that is.
---
I don't really care if someone has a mask they aren't "supposed" to have. If they enjoy it, that's what counts. Now if you're dupping millions of grenades and causing server problems, those people suck. Otherwise? Why care?
---
I think the appalachia ones are smaller too.  Maybe it's a east-coast variant that is different :)
---
That's the way it's supposed to work, man, where you been?
---
To add on to the ‚Äòlock up your crops‚Äô... don‚Äôt use a door. Use a wall. You can ‚Äòreplace‚Äô a solid wall with a wall with a doorway in Build Mode and back again.
---
One of my alts has their camp set up as a walled enclosure around a resource node and a bunch of crops. No doorways at all. The crafting stations are all still accessible to visitors.
---
I use a bloodied gatling gun in power armor. Even at 20% health i rarely die.
---
Your getting that info from a data mine that said nothing about a christmas event.
---
Not sure that's breaking the rules.  The rule is YOU can't travel, not that you can't be spawned.
---
Havent left the shelter yet.
---
Same here but I saw another post today about someone getting an early present
---
Wait... is this a complaint based on real world logic?
---
I had one kick me right after she had died and I was a couple feet from looting her. Then yesterday I had one completely screw me. I was in the fight against the queen the whole time, but when she died the game acted like I didn't lay a single bullet on her. I didn't get the quest completion rewards and I received no loot from her.
---
YYYYYAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS,
---
Holy cow. Sucks man.
---
That's cool, and I'm not going to say you shouldn't. But you have good intentions. Someone who didn't could very easily do a lot of harm. And often, they do. You also run the risk of being banned because Beth isn't sending a clear message about what will and won't get you banned. Unclear rules also cause a huge amount of harm, because of this. Good people get banned, while idiots don't. That's why clear rules, consistent (standard) enforcement of them, and known consequences are important. It keeps good persons out of the way of arbitrary punishment. I hope you don't end up shit on because of this problem.
---
OK, that' got me. :D

I already own it. Although I regret the pre-order.

I've enjoyed all the other Fallout games. I got me self hooked back on Fallout 3. So I blindly jumped on the bandwagon thinking what could go wrong. Boy was I mistaken.
---
They really gotta let us redeem our tickets for cosmetics if we dont want to but cards or have em all.

---
Depends on your game play.  If you're a melee player, it's not always a bad idea to have one CQS type weapon that can some lead out in case of multiple enemies.  
---
I'm a bit of an all around player, I have one sniper rifle, a spiked axe and a machine gun always handy.  Just depends on the kind of mission I'm in.  A 2\* lvl 50 submachine gun could work wonders on some scorched if you dont want to waste your time with melee or sniping.
---
As for selling it, I don't know.  I honestly take every \*'ed weapon I find to the legendary vendor and exchange it.
---
Yeah you got a point.
---
Woot! Let‚Äôs get out pitch forks and torches ready!! Raid this shiz
---
Because clear and consistent rules are important. It prevents "tyranny of the individual". I'm not here to advocate for anything but an active set of guidelines from Beth. Just give us a stand so I know whether I can expect to get a year's worth of progress deleted over a triviality or it's OK to buy that expensive dev-room collectible because I won't be punished.

This is my next characters build

I've found one, one time only every other time it is never there. RNG ??

I meant the "FIRST" membership. Im lvl 130.
---
They never fixed the bug that you start losing 80% healing effectiveness once you start moving with it on
---
Ready to nut....text ding....from someone you cannot ignore....
---
The correct term is "shopping"
---
And it could make snappy remarks when a purchase was/wasn‚Äôt made. I‚Äôm all for more life at CAMPs.
---
Lmao
---
It's a nice mutation unfortunately all the game breaking bugs with it makes it the worst mutation to use
---
A level 37 probably shouldn‚Äôt be doing SBQ‚Äôs. Sure you can, but you‚Äôre way under leveled not just for the fight but the entire area.
---
Nice find.  I would think it‚Äôs worth around 15k+.
---
Since you are already a bloody build you could simply add the demolition perk if you want to test it out to see if you like it.
---
Not a problem when you dont play the broken game  and move on to actual working titles more worthy of your time :)
---
Yeah, I had to force myself to not break something.
---
Been playing since beta and nu league winter is the only thing worth playing. Its such a well done mode too bad it's not 60fps tho on co solos. But ya it need to stay.
---
Thats a power move if I ever seen one.
---
Im sure.
---
Off topic but enjoy.

I'm jealous I have a bloodied faster firerate that's collecting dust because I only run into tesla
---
Maybe some people dont care about flux and just want to do scortched earth outside of a nuke zone.
---
It's vague. Collectrons are abstracted functions / objects, so BGS probably added a switcher to the entire class, rather than adding subclasses, &amp;c which might cause complications that break the build. If it's easier, that's what they'll do.
---
The absence of negative PR pays for itself. And paywalling a feature off the Christmas skin is some Ebenezer Scrooge shit.
---
I'll check it out and get back
---
Thank you!
---
The truth is, the game rigged from the start.
---
Aww man, you retracted the most upvotes prize, I was winning üòÄ
---
Adventure mode should long ago have been no pvp unless both players had pacifist off.  
---
LLLLOOOONNNNGGGG ago, otherwise, what was the FFFing point of survival mode.
---
Correct
---
I can tank teslas ez, you just needa perfect ur build
---
The event can be completed outside the nuke zone even with hitting the plants for flux. You can have your cake and eat it too in this case.
---
Some advice, do 3 points in charisma, can still do lone wanderer x2. Ditch quack surgeon.  Put those two points elsewhere, perhaps class freak if you want a lot of mutations. You going bloodied melee?
---
What's your IGN?  I'd like to see your museum!  I'm AlmaxMere.
---
POIDH.
---
I sell all of my known recipes and plans for 1 cap at my camp. I am making a killing and helping new players out at the same time
---
I have dodgy and a full set of sentinal assassin with 3 pieces of powered and 2 pieces sneak bonus in leather and I use quantum and cola nut for AP regeneration I I die before I even get 10 shots out of my executioners faster fire rate handmade
---
Place your nukes wherever you want and I‚Äôll place mine where I like. Personally, I don‚Äôt like fighting the queen inside the nuke zone.  As far as high rad fluid, we use a bloatfly syringer for that.  Just my opinion.
---
From my personal experience, items you can trade are always safe. As in you won‚Äôt get banned for holding an item. They can and often do get simply removed in patches, but you won‚Äôt ever be banned for simply holding or owning an item; that much is clear to me.
---
What will get you banned:
---
Hacking for PvP- immunity hacks, OPK, and high damage hacks in particular 
---
NPC weapon mods, again this is a hack of cheat engine
---
Going into the dev cell will get the account banned
---
Using script to try and do the turret dupe or the purveyor scrip to cap method 
---
Forcing server shutdown using hacks
---
Basically it‚Äôs just hacks and going into the dev room.
---
I run a few Bloodied builds, including a melee guy, with power armor. My melee guy is only in PA in nuke zones tho.
---
I dont know how you guys do it. This game frustrated me too much. I play games for joy, not frustration. Especially after so much time spent trying to do one thing just for the game to kick you out. Sticking around this sub in the hopes the game actually improves :(
---
I started again after leaving in March.  I spawned at my base, but with my PA in pieces.  Took 5 minutes to sort it, and I was off.  
---
Welcome back.
---
There are no more survival servers.  They were an option because they were generally less populated and so there was usually less lag. Nowadayas you have to either server hop for a stable server or if a friend has 1st go on a private server.
---
I don't know where you heard that people were running bloodied builds in there, most everyone I've spoken to that play bloodied don't like the raids because they specifically are punishing to these builds. 
---
As for the meta for the raid I don't know that there really is a specific build that people use for the missions but in my experience any full health setup with decent weapons does fine. 
---
Explosive weapons in general are nice to have down there for sure, as the enemies tend to clump up thanks to being almost all melee except but all that matters is the ability to kill quickly.  I have a character with a ffr handmade that works just fine, for example.
---
Stealth is generally kind of rough down there, maybe you could make it work with massive AGI and/or a lot of armor with legendary bonus to stealth.
---
But the true key is just having 3 or 4 solid players who know the objectives and have decent gear.  You really and truly don't need anything special.  it's more about teamwork and coordination than DPS.
---
Dm‚Äôd
---
Yeah whatever you said I just know that the dev said above that it Does not do scrap or junk but if you already own the Collectron you can set it to do scrap or junk.
---
People can drop their nukes where ever they want . If you don't like the drop location don't go to it
---
This is the most underrated track of 2020.
---
Except in online coop or pvp play.
---
Nah I‚Äôll keep nuking the same spot so I don‚Äôt need to hop in PA just to fight the queen, I‚Äôm good.
---
You can always launch your own nuke instead of telling other people how to launch theirs.
---
Cool, Fallout 76 didn‚Äôt have 1m game breaking bugs either... Thanks for proving my point about people being biased. 
---
Here‚Äôs a game breaking bug from launch. Seems like they can‚Äôt get the main game mechanics right:
---
https://youtu.be/QVxxma3liq4
---
Lol damn are you a sensitive little thing.
---
Did you copy this from the top comment on the other post?
---
What do you mean high rad fluid you use a bloat fly syringer for that?
---
I‚Äôm kind of the same, I tote a combat shotgun, a western revolver (both bloodied), and my instigating ss. 
---
I hope mama murgles has been kind to you.
---
I usually just do random things. I work fulltime and it destresses especially when with music. I just mess around. I used to get frustrated at cod too, but I finally came to my sense that theyre just games and that its not THAT important. I agree though. I like to enjoy most games. Thats why I downloaded angry birds on the phone lol.
---
Awesome, always looking for one of those I haven't seen. I like the sloth mommy defending her young from the two guys.
---
Stoked for SANTATRON
---
Thanks for the info! Fortunately I had 4 available points to pump into demolition, so I‚Äôll give it a whirl.
---
I just keep V9 out of it a little ways and were good. I agree I always like to get flux and it's a bummer when it's so deep they miss the forest.
---
bethesda/todd: it works! it just works!
---
I don't mind the fight taking place outside the nukes one as much, but not hitting the forest is a huge bummer
---
Can't do anything but give a little chuckle and move on. Was in a server yesterday and saw someone nuke whitesprings...just white spring they missed the golf course lol.
---
Agreed
---
Yeah I'll Never buy the FO1st Game mechanics should be offered to everyone that owns the game. Skins for your items should be the only thing you can spend real money on. That's my personal opinion and take on microtransactions. My main was lvl 97.
---
Just like my hot wheels car with one bent tire works. It just works.
---
Fortnite needs xbox live to play so they do the same thing that bethesda is idoing for playstation, just on xbox.  Destiny 2 is half xbox live half free.,...just arbitrarily.
---
Companies suck like that and the reddit never wants to hear about it because their attitude is either pay and play or don't and don't.
---
Scrap pipe syringers to learn the bloat fly mod.  Shoot any enemy once with a bloat fly syringer.  Now switch weapons and kill the enemy.  Upon its death a bloat fly will spawn.  Now shoot the bloat fly with the syringer before killing it.  You now have an endless loop of enemies that have a chance to spawn high road fluids, hardened mass, etc.  
---
Pro tip:  if you have two people shoot each bloatfly with a syringer, the dead fly will spawn two more.  At this rate they increase in number pretty fast.  Don‚Äôt use the syringer more than twice on a fly or it seems to not spawn at all.  Obviously this works best as a team effort but can be done alone.
---
I saw someone nuke a mountaintop with nothing on it. Lmao
---
You don't have to but there were a lot of PC bans today for having holiday gifts in your inventory
---
I agree. With that too. Especially since it was promised to begin with. If i had been around since the beginning Im sure id be in the same suit as you.
---
Why do you think so many of us stopped playing?
---
Agreed, every radio station to be playing it.
---
Lol Remember those days when couldn't put a dent in it.. Nowdays it's like this with no chems [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUU6MT2tRcM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUU6MT2tRcM)
---
Yeah stuff clips like that. You'll see it in the crystal cavern too with the sb, he flys through the walls.
---
I did enjoy fo76 at release but it had a lot of bugs.  
---
Btw this video exist:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6HdBplLmuU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6HdBplLmuU)
---
The lockpick perk is useless to have on all the time. Only equip it when you actually have a lock you want to pick.
---
demo expert is useless. you're better off speccing in the proper tree.
---
is it a .45 or a 10mm smg? they don't go for much but you could make a stealth commando build with a tommy gun. although it wouldn't be as effective as a fixer or a handmade, it's still a powerful build regardless.
---
Oh i like it better when you dont get any rewards from her or the mission completed after waiting through freezing screens
---
You can set mines off at will by tossing out a 3rd mine, setting off the first.
---
Screws are not that rare. In 231 lvl's I have only had A screw shortage A few times. Probably due to me not picking up items to conserve weight. I have done this with several items. Start collecting them again when I run out. But at higher lvl it gets easier to do because you know where to farm.
---
Fairly new to reddit and not sure what the upvote is but thanks to who ever did that
---
Low key this post got me more feedback then I imagined. Kinda suprised me. I was trying to regain 6 karma I lost when I was at 32. Now in 7 hours i am at 480. Holy cow.
---
Too many people crying about NW rewards already. There should be rewards solely for # of wins, # of kills, weapon type kills.
---
Highly visible rewards that the AFK'ers will never get.
---
10 mm. I have few perks for guns other than heavy, so I‚Äôd have to do some serious re-speccing.
---
LOL I‚Äôm 40 years old....And the couple times it happened I didn‚Äôt have enough resources to rebuild it which pissed me off even more. I believe I‚Äôd probably loaded a bowl or rolled one, got blazed and vegged out for the night
---
Oh yes.
---
Sounds like you need to be dropping more nukes.
---
So they‚Äôre going to release a free version of something so many people have already paid for with atoms? Do I have that right?
---
Seems kinda like a kick in the gut tbh
---
No just marsupial mut. But ill check out something in perception lol
---
This is the best reply. Haha

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Are you reporting everyone you see with duped items? If not, well, that's how you solve your problem.
---
I hate when I do a silo run as soon as the lights turn on and I‚Äôm headed toward the nkc panel ‚Äúserver disconnected‚Äù ü§™
---
Ohh yeah. That's rough.
---
A mr handy that just roams your camp saying stuff pls
---
Another thing that bother me was the Battle Royale. To me, it didn't fit with the Fallout lore. It felt more like they were trying to cater to the fortnite crowd to pole in more players.  But that's just my personal opinion on it. I'm sure there are those that feel that it fits perfectly into the game.
---
I agree with that as well
---
Hey alex said the 65k hotdog parties were guys.. And it was guys.
---
NPC rage quit
---
Yeah. You get a lot of people looking at you, that's the big bounse haha. But I don't think it's really worth the grind. I loved doing the raids and I live in pa so it was worth it for me. But it's really not a huge game changer unless you love pvp.
---
For most people t51b is all you'll ever need. Also modding the Stangler is a bitch since you have to get plans from the queen. Took me almost 2 month of grinding and posting a few times a day on the market to get my hud plan
---
The Santatron only gives candy, coal, or toys. If you own a  Collectron, you can set the Santatron to collect the things  it normally does. Toys are high tier because most of those have screws, but imo Collectron is still super useful because of Ballistic Fiber, Ultracite or other rare stuff
---
Had that happen to me this morning
---
Sorry to bother you but how do you get that pioneer scout next to your name
---
He could pick up any bags people leave lying around! Good idea my guy. Nice talking to you frogo
---
You can collect A ton of candy by doing Monster Mash event at Watoga High. 90% of the time meds and ammo or vending machine items are the only thing I pick up.
---
Ohh, ok. Thanks for clearing that up for me!
---
Maybe try triggering the bucket in first person. It's been good on pc.
---
I recently helped kill her and as soon as she died, I died from something and was then stuck in a respawn screen without any means of escaping. Had to relog and couldn‚Äôt get whatever her loot was
---
eh. it's a very, *very* niche gun. you could probably find someone interested in it, so don't lowball yourself. but viability-wise it's not very good. I'd take a 1\* bloodied handmade over it, for one. the lack of a suppressor really hurts it.
---
Does it have ‚Äúbutcher Pete‚Äù ?
---
I just want him to annoy people at my camp tbh
---
I've clocked in about 30 hours of BF V now since their Pacific DLC and the game hasn't crashed on me once. 
---
Not once. 
---
I'll get back to you fo76
---
If you are in the Reddit app, go to main page for FO76 sub and click ‚Äú...‚Äù at to top right corner and select‚Äù change user flair‚Äù
---
Every upward!
---
I don't think so.. Do you like butcher pete?
---
The literal worst!
---
Aw shame, I like that one
---
Stealing the stuff they drop seems annoying. Make a trap base and have him collect their junk. Man we have good ideas
---
Why what is it? Survival mode coming back?
---
I'd like that
---
I'm having the same problem.
---
No, I don't unless they are being disruptive or damaging. I leave everything else up to the Devs.
---
I mean I can add it. I just get flashbacks of fo4 and it playing often as possible lol.
---
I love fallout music. Will definitely give it a listen. Thanks!!
---
Lol yeah so many people have ptsd with that song
---
+ karma Awesome thanks
---
I like the john denver version. Maybe add ghostbusters
---
If you are on pc I will sell it for 3,500 caps. I don‚Äôt need it but I won‚Äôt be on until probably tomorrow at like 6:30.
---
I do like how they did the skills. Compared to the previous Fallout games where your skills were set in stone (more or less) The perk cards allowed you to switch on the Fly. That was a change for the better.
---
Alright and youre welcome! There are a few classics I havent added but if there needs any suggestions Im open arms. I used avenged sevenfold covers of runaway and god only knows. I dont know how well they mesh yet.
---
That ^
---
But if you own both you can switch it from junk to collector. No need to build both. At least that's the impression I got.
---
Do you ask storekeepers if you can have something free from their store after it's been looted in a riot? You act like everyone on PC has access to developer content. I've never seen a marine armor helmet on anybody or in anybody's vendor on PC so don't act like we all have it you're entitled to it just because a few cheaters have got their hands on it.
---
I see the same NW hackers over and over. There was an initial wave of bans, then nothing for the last few months.
---
Also, thanks for the observations!
---
I added that one and I dont know. I thought about it. I tried to stay 50s to 60s as possible unless it was a cover. Im going to expirament for sure.
---
Thanks man... thought I was on market
---
\#notallpcusers
---
You‚Äôll want more rifle damage perks too. Max those out.
---
I have a bicycle at my camp.
---
Yeah I like it. I sometimes find it tedious but hey. Its better than permanently having you skills set. You can build it however you want! Kinda like legos.
---
Chill. I'm not saying you all Raided the dev room but you now have access to it since you can trade with other people for it. Console players don't have access to that stuff. Also I'm not acting entitled I'm just suggesting and idea.
---
Tried that both 1st and 3rd person, also tried it just after doing another daily event within the park like zoe and the hotdogs or the dross toss, but no result I'm afraid.
---
I have all the mods already, but for 8 badges I can get a high capacity mod and sell that for 25k caps. Which I do....a lot.
---
I never said All Pc players I just said Pc players that could imply 2-Infinite
---
Theres no santa but theres murrmph
---
Good luck.  Probably a 1,500 Atom Idea by Bethesda now.
---
Haha, yeah kind of like Legos. If they added presets that you can save. That would remove Some of That tedious swapping every time you want a lockpick or hack something. Or swap your solo / group builds.
---
Yeah undoubtedly.
---
That's a great idea! Even fasten it to your favorites wheel/hotkeys.
---
buck if i know, trucker.
---
Up voting for luck not having an effect. That's a recipe for disaster.
---
"Ever upwards"
---
explain?
---
Can you expand on that?
---
All free to play games on ps4 do not need ps plus, learn the basic facts before bitching.
---
A pet/robot system that is initially cosmetic only but can play a role in gameplay with perk investments.
---
That moment when you realize you were thinking of the first time you attacked a giant in Skyrim and went flying.
---
Oops, wrong game.
---
They removed the DR at least six months ago (shortly after someone gave me one).
---
To be fair, they really set the bar low...
---
DM‚Äôd you
---
Santabot. Of course, naughty boys and girls may get a lot of coal.
---
But because you own them both could be him just saying to people who've bought the original, "you still have the capacity to access what you paid for" because it is just a skin for the protectron. Where the protectron itself has itself just been giving an extra ability, that is searching for a new set of items.
---
That's why I said Vague. Also the other CM said something about the issue which is slightly different to what this one has
---
That‚Äôs why I moved over to melee. Then the melee folk get to strong and people start bitching when the queen goes down to quick. Stupid cycle.
---
I found a fox head plan in a bag last night. Took it and learned it. Hope I don't get banned lol
---
I will do.
---
I can solo SBQ and I can tank all the damage that the Imposter throws at me. Never once have I needed a duped item, and I‚Äôm basically a casual scrub.
---
*doesnt understand either of you two in Powerfist*
---
It may have been. I meant for a shooting game lol
---
At level 37 you might not be doing enough damage to the Queen to actually get loot from her. Depends on your build, but I think if you had damage numbers on you might be suprised to see how little damage you're doing. Could be wrong and it's been bugged but it's something to consider.
---
Oh definitely In a perfect world there would be all the junk placeable and no lag I just thought coming in with a different thought process might be a little better we know they have faced issues with the game and developing it so I wanted to use something that's already present and expand upon that :) but it would be awesome I love building and I love the world space we have been given I just hope the tools we get will keep expanding as the game does
---
It's so tempting.
---
You shouldn't call your partner that, I'm sure they are really nice!
---
Not sure I would put them on a floor, just in case you're unable to place that floor. I just disconnect the power to the machines, and pack them outside to sit on bare ground, then yeah, if you just pack up the entire camp, they'll get packed up individually, including their contents, and any decorations or labels you've put on them.
---
Hope so, we got serums to make for you kids to buy from us
---
I saw a YT video of someone who made it to the tippy top of the Fort Defiance spire. I think they glitched up there though.
---
I feel that also
---
Im 18 agi, 2 points on stealth 
---
They feel me in 1sec even im at their back
---
Died 10 times in west tek
---
Will overweight make you more visable?
---
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cp89ak/world_record_fastest_legit_sbq_kill_5_seconds/) is the video a guy made with it
---
right?! What the shit is that about, also no I don‚Äôt think so
---
I didn't know people put anything else in them. It's all I ever put in mine with a 'Free trip' sign above it
---
Doubt it
---
Also [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwPfgVOt3k0)
---
If we didn't bash and trash on Bethesda, then they wouldn't work really hard to fix their game the right way.
---
I agree. They have to hear it. As their consumers it's our right! How can one improve if no criticism is received.
---
The glitch I've had lately is when you die after the queen goes down and go to up your dropped loot, the stable flux just disappears.
---
So it's a very expensive outfit with an added search category for the junkbot.
---
Seems expensive when you explain it that plainly.
---
I have a feeling we might get some wastelands stuff considering the wait for it. They even mentioned waster landers in itv for some reason
---
I mean without and food or chem buffs I run around at around 1100-1300 base damage on my power fist. I also have healing factor and sell 95% of the meds I pick up.
---
FYI chameleon armor does not increase your stealth value. There was a post last week I believe that explained all of the current stealth mechanics. Chameleon makes you less visible with each pierce, not more stealthy.
---
Always been this way. You cant sprint or stand while crouching
---
I don't think "for once" is fair. They've been working steadily all year
---
Weird I sweet the effect are there cause I die before the lightning even appears if I dont have armor
---
I know a guy that can spawn in plenty of stuff, atom shop stuff in particular. From there it‚Äôs as easy as picking it up and loving it.
---
MRD1997
---
Nope
---
Mrd1997 add me !
---
Weird
---
Why Chemist though? If that affects gunpowder crafting I'm gonna kick myself. I haven't used it for gunpowder once and I've crafted 100,000+ rounds
---
People have reported that the Tesla ignores assassins sentinels after the bounce. The lightning is only reduced by ER. Teslas are broke as a joke
---
I‚Äôve had this problem pop up a few times on Xbox. If you‚Äôre on console, I‚Äôd recommend power-cycling your system, to start. If that fails, I‚Äôd simply suggest you put in a ticket with Bethesda, they can possibly reset that daily for you.
---
How do you get mutation recipes?
---
Pretty sure they canceled it with no plans on going back.
---
Yeah, I have a bit of a hard time with the mirelurk kings and queens, but I‚Äôve just been trying to get through as quick as possible, but I‚Äôve been flying through ammo.
---
Mrd1997 ! Add me !
---
Then I will be completely and utterly shocked. Nothing they've done to date would indicate that they're making any kind of concerted effort to fix the game.
---
I can sum it for you: none.
---
Wondering why this didn't become a thing earlier than the dev room invasions then....still much left to fix for Bethesda
---
 I got this game with my friend because he's been a fanboy of the Fallout saga since EVER, and we were looking for a multiplayer game we could play together.
---
This is my first Fallout game ever played. I HATE IT.
---
I don't want to sound like an asshole, but i'm mad. Mad because the potential of this game is SO MUCH MORE than what they did here. 
---
No night goes by without either one of us raging about something that this game does wrong and that could be awesome. 
---
IN THIS EXACT MOMENT i'm here writing this because my friend encountered another shitty mission that's either bugged or the server is YET AGAIN lagging like crazy. 
---
We're still playing becase at this point it's kind of a meme and we have fun by ripping this game apart. 
---
But what makes me sad is seeing my friend's favorite series letting him down, and making him rage. He went from defending this game like an absolute fanboy to being sad and angry about it.
---
There, he disconnected, logged back in, got the mission pop-up. All's good... EXCEPT! Server downtime! Hah, again...
---
Will they fix the horrible performance? The lagg? The bugs?  Or will they fix an "exploit", a "server side thingy", a cosmetic item?
---
Right they say that people playing the trial won‚Äôt be able to access wastelanders when the trial only lasts 4 days I think and it starts on December 12
---
Yep. Quad Faster Fire Tesla and Stealthboys.  Devolves into an electrocution match.
---
These are all valid comments.
---
They never said they were going to bring it back after Wastelanders; they ssid they'd look at ways to improve/expand PvP in the core game.
---
i refuse to play fo76 again, but if you wanna play minecraft or something else, my GT is dommo1003. hit me up anytime
---
Honestly, I just want pvp fixes in general. Can I get some balancing changes and faction pvp when Wastelanders releases!
---
If we are ever on at the same time, I'm happy to help in the future: Emerald Kingdom
---
Exactly. It was fucked 7 months ago and it still is. I‚Äôm am beyond infuriated as I spent so long creating this precisely, so many people came to check it out, complimented it, and now it‚Äôs gone to shit. Like thanks for the good 4 hours of it actually being a camp, Bethesda. After the effort I put in, I‚Äôm surprised I even make camps anymore. So sick of it.
---
The pipe revolver can be converted to a rifle and use all rifle AND pistol perks. I have a TSE 15% FR that rivals my TS 50% crit 15% FC Fixer. Sometimes it's hard to decide which one to use.  My agility isn't high enough to fully exploit the pistol perks but I am thinking of the 2x XP weekend as a time to build a character around that gun.
---
I swear I‚Äôve packed up like normal and of course they got packed up with everything else when I moved camps, went to place then and they were empty...they may not of gotten blue printed I guess. I guess blue printing them is the important part
---
Getting stored erases the contents but getting blue printed keeps the contents? Correct
---
The nature of the Fallout series does not mesh well with timers. We love to soak in all the details of the world, especially new content like a raid, but it becomes an adderall fueled race to pick up items and smash heads, all the while trying to defeat the real raid boss: lag. 
---
I‚Äôve done two raids and am done, don‚Äôt have much of a clue as to why or what I was doing because it was a chaotic rush to beat the timer. 
---
I get it, they need to make it challenging. But make more waves of creatures, make bigger, badder enemies. Just make it fun, not frustrating. Plus the loot sucks anyways.
---
Why wouldn't we be? People that keep paying for this type of crap are paving the way towards making things worse.
---
Yeah... I would love an extra 20%, could make due with 10%, might be able to make 5% work.  More importantly though, I need 2 more vending machines.
---
Even if I could afford the budget to have signs reminding me to change perk cards (which I don't), I feel that EVEN WITH the signs, I'll still forget and be halfway across the map before I realise I still have Super Duper on.
---
Or better yet, she flies off the map and nobody gets loot.
---
Eh, bloodied isn‚Äôt optimal, but it‚Äôs damn close. With the right buffs and a semi decent group you won‚Äôt die. I think I did twice and that was while learning it.
---
Me and my friend are constantly saying F&amp;#k I had those perks off the whole time.
---
The majority of these *badass PVPers* aren't looking for an actual fight, they just want to gank people. Sad.
---
Sounds like someone has too good of an aim.üòã
---
Fire extinguishers too
---
Just saying, the gaming community in general should have thrown that hissy a long time before F76
---
It's not the damage. It's free exp. Use the  free workshop resources to repair the pad then shoot down your own vertibird for exp, it used to be incredibly fast and give 800 exp per kill but they nerfed the exp and added a cool down so you can't spam it. It's still a bit of easy exp tho
---
Those vertibirds are worth exp for anyone, even the workshop owner. You can repair the pad with the free workshop resources then shoot it down for easy exp. That's what OP is doing.
---
Or everyone else is too under leveled and you run out of time. Scorchbeast queen flies away as you look at how much ammo you wasted
---
I appreciate that
---
That is the way
---
Very cool!
---
oof
---
I would assume he either means that people are still looking for certain drops and SBQ is a good way to find them (for example junkie just became widely popular so god roll junkies are fairly rare, at least on console), or that all of the duped weapons means that the event actually has a fairly high completion rate now.
---
I remember the first few Scorched Earths I went to where some players where still using just anything they had found up until that point. The only way to complete the event sometimes was to have multiple full teams on a single server. Now I feel comfortable dropping a nuke on just about any server I‚Äôm on and having a good chance of killing the queen.
---
theyve been working hella hard throughout the year, i played in the beta tests and stopped playing due to the state of the game and picked back up a few months ago and i feel like things have improved greatly.
---
I agree and dont agree at the same time. Yes, they need to work on it some more, but the idea that they should take all the time they want may mean that it could be pushed back way far further than we think. There will be bugs like all new releases. Some things have to be worked out as they go instead of delaying and delaying.
---
Survival mode servers were repurposed for fallout 1st private servers.
---
Lol check that recent player list.
---
Still haven‚Äôt seen those plasma made plans...
---
There are some reshade mods on nexusmods for a sharper looking game
---
Wait, what, speed demon makes it harder to heal yourself?  It's glitched?
---
Silenced explosive 10mm with +30 damage to super mutants, o'yeah!
---
Nice pic. Whose your friend?
---
There is a bug that occasionally pops up where you‚Äôre just automatically detected everywhere. Relogging always fixes it for me.
---
I agree.
---
As a counter point, one of my characters can do both of those things at the same time. It is possible. 
---
I run a bloody meat hook build with a full set of zealots str+1 harder to detect while sneaking trapper armor.
---
I can sit at 15% health and deal massive damage while soloing the queen and tank all the adds.
---
At the queen, I am an immortal God that punches scorched into a fine bloody mist.
---
Anywhere else, a full set of harder to detect while sneaking makes me an undetectable ninja that one shots everything
---
Ammo production, inventory management, and it paired with the deployable tent make it extremely useful even beyond repairing weapons and armor
---
What would be example of a junk item that you wouldn't want to scrap? Last I checked, they don't have it set up to automatically scrap junk used for crafting like deathclaw hands, baseballs, beer bottles, etc
---
Once you buy it you will understand. Between unlimited junk and the ease to transfer legendaries between mules is totally worth it.
---
I have my vendor at the top of the world train station and all my serums are at 199. They sell like crazy to all the newish lvl 20 players following the main quest.
---
Did the SBQ the other day plus a legendary scorchbeast and got no loot from either.  Just to rub it in everytime I fast travelled for the next 2 hours a SB would fall out of the sky on my head... what a feature!
---
Red Star Pin, for example.
---
Oh crap. My bad. I thought the we were talking about gauss... Dumb me. Sorry mate
---
Dude I want a pet scorchbeast to fall on my head too!! Lucky.
---
I assume you meant "Nade". I got a drop from Lode Baring. Course, I have done that damn event probably 1,000 times, only to have it happen once, and it dropped several months ago...
---
So if you are able to save lock this junk, are you hoping to be able to set it in your camp as a decoration or just have it stay in your inventory indefinitely?
---
I did. I‚Äôm very hopeful I can get it in a present. Because it‚Äôs my last badge, and that‚Äôs the one thing I have left.
---
Either or both, its more about letting us decide what gets auto scrapped and what doesnt.
---
Died by energy weapon. Most often happens with legacy. Everything happens too fast and the game screws up on respawn.
---
Re log and it will go away.
---
Those things are inside of me? I'm crafting like 500 disease cures IDC if I'm overencumbered.
---
Yeah let me find it real quick
---
It was a joke, implying you have shit vision if you think the game's graphics are lacking.
---
that happed to me the other day and as i was gathering resources some chick in powerarmor looted my corpse, i wish that would make people wanted
---
I did but I was fighting solo against 4. I couldn't remember the others to rejoin. That's a really dumb glitch honestly
---
When a legendary dies that you've gotten a hit on, it should smoke like the artillery grenades
---
I believe it, but who cares if you have junk when you can buy repair kits, why make us pay for both?
---
Agreed if my wife didn't have it I would
---
It just happens. Played a lot of survival with non legacy lasers and made it happen. Only time it's a problem is when the guy knows he can't be killed and doesn't re log. Sometimes you couldn't fast travel either so if they walk across the map to come back you know you got dirtbag.
---
Kinda pathetic.
---
K
---
I was actually upset when i tried to play a holotape game on it because of *aesthetic* but I was let down
---
I hear u on that. I think I‚Äôd potentially skip out on it too if I had a person to piggyback off of like it was a community Netflix account
---
Why not buy 1st. Then with the atoms you get, buy your repair kits? If you are gonna buy them anyway that it.
---
Repair kits do nothing for ammo production, which is whyni use my scapbox for mainly steel and lead - upto about 20k ea so far.
---
Did you hit her for over 1500 damage in total?
---
?
---
Junk is for more than just repairing weapons and armor.
---
Repair kits don't build floors, walls, or turrets.  Repair kits don't supply the components for mods.  Repair kits don't provide the ingredients necessary to make ammo.  Repair kits don't generate hundreds of stable fluxes that you can hold onto for when you want/need them.
---
Right, makes my high horse pretty comfortable
---
It just works.
---
This happened to me tonight I ran back to whitespring, hunted down a cargobot then went back 30 minutes later and it was still cleared. Just ran through and launched.
---
I believe there is now a limited amount of damage you must do to the Queen during the fight to get rewards.
---
It put a stop to low level players travelling down, hitting her once and then hiding for the rest of the fight.
---
I am sure I remember reading this somewhere but I'm not 100% on it so ill wait on someone else to chime in.
---
I would say this would be a bug way low on the list as one, it would seem to require alot of things happening in play to occur, and most time when you're mulling with a private world, you won't be jumping in the air to drop a bag. You can just place the items in a suitcase or container, leave world(dont close app) come in on new character to grab gear.
---
FO1 is an advantage, sorry if I seemed to say otherwise
---
Hahaha that‚Äôs the funniest thing I‚Äôve heard all night
---
My point was that folks who want to spend money already didn't care about junk storage, they buy repair kits
---
I spend $10 minimum a week and I personally have never bought a repair kit or a scrap kit. But I know my experience is different from everyone else's. I understand what you are saying tho. I hear they are popular to buy.
---
Just told the truth
---
Your right my bad
---
It is those damn bundles that get me lol
---
Man you're just going apeshit with your posting today
---
&gt;  you won't be jumping in the air to drop a bag.
---
Not from today, that's for sure!   
---
&gt; You can just place the items in a suitcase or container
---
Yes, we know we should trade items via trading UI or to use containers, but sometimes for convenience or for speed we end using bags‚Ä¶ btw, I've read here some fellas had problems with the containers tech. just saying‚Ä¶
---
Sure this a weird bug and very situational. I don't even expect this bug gets fixed. But it can cause immense losts to someone non expecting it. It's fot that I reported it...
---
Double XP event is coming up! 
---
Inspirational perk, Well Rested, Cranberry Relish, INT boosting aid items.
---
Which is good and everything, not downing it all. Just saying this won't be considered a huge bug to the dev's what's so ever. Most people from my personal experience, just wait a second and step back. But that's just how we use to do it. I havent played in the last couple of weeks cause after 2400+ hours I finally got burnt out.
---
Wait, how does it help you transfer between mules?  I thought the Priv-Worlds disappear when you log off a character?
---
Its not about throwing a hissy fit. It's about voting with your wallet. If you choose to keep buying these macro transactions even though bethasda is walking all over you, you are a fool
---
I think she's supposed to be an allegory for trans characters but let's not talk about that
---
 *sips tea*
---
Yes, you are taking (0) damage. If you have Dodgy on, you will also lose your AP to help reduce all of that 0 damage you're taking.
---
Im sorry.
---
You mean to say you have absolutelyu zero perks of Stealth?  Umm... yeah...  you need that.
---
This has been a good vent for me. Ive literally never had reddit before then my one post got like 560 upvotes in one day.
---
I use the Scorchbeast to find people hiding under the water and reward them with a plasma grenade execution.
---
Also, I can still shoot you underwater :)
---
Tell you what. I have a spare. And because I'm a completionist and know how it feels, get hold of me and I'll give you that spare plasma nade plan for free. If you see one of the things I'm looking for in this post:

IGN: mcchuggernaut
---
I doubt we will see 4 or 5 star legendaries, we've already seen the power of just 3 star legendaries so I don't want to imagine the power of 4 or 5 star
---
Noop, full stealth perks except escape artist
---
What sucks is that the size of the active players inversely reflects how nice players are
---
But she's a woman. Cant you tell?
---
Wait 76 has bugs still?
---
I‚Äôd personally prefer the last 2 stars be very mild, and customization via player crafting.  Don‚Äôt see the game‚Äôs allure in pushing the limit two more stars as it‚Äôs enough of a statistical improbability to get what you want as-is.
---
Who knew!?
---
Not useless; simply a convenience decision. I‚Äôm also not always killing things, and since everything dies in one hit anyway more damage is useless most of the time.
---
I love Fallout and one of my first experiences was using everything I had to repair those fusion core generators after fixing the power plant or whatever. Then a scorchbeast comes and I run, hide, shoot, repeat for so long due to my lack of ammo at the time in anything but weak guns. I finally kill it and am basking in victory. 
---
5-ish minutes later, another spawns and destroys the thing and it all goes to shit. I felt so defeated and deflated. I had no way of making it so I left with nothing. 
---
It was a fucking bummer.
---
&gt;  after 2400+ hours I finally got burnt out.
---
wow, not a bad record, eh! 
---
Commerce (can do it while working) and collecting saved the end-game for me. But I understand that those activities are not everyone's kind of fun, normal that veterans keep quitting until new content comes.
---
I miss the DLCs, like in other Fallouts. I think they were a good excuse for those who left, to go back to the game for some time‚Ä¶
---
December 2019 - found the marked Registrar and searched it heavily in the back near the safe.  Any other ideas. It keeps driving me to the DmV door but the bot said go to the courthouse. Any help would be appreciated.
---
I‚Äôll PM you
---
Commerce and legendaries kept me going the last 400 and so hours, but it's just boring, nothing presents too much of a challenge and I lost interest with vault raids when I saw they were timed events. I dont mind using tons of materials and ammo in dungeons, I just dont want to be rushed. I also do t have the greatest internet, so lag in public servers is horrible for me and playing on private got boring.
---
There just isn't anything to chase after anymore.
---
If every duped item was 100% removed from game then 3/4 of the player base would lose their most valued items.
---
That would be cool too! May make a server lag though.
---
You have to deal at least 10% of her total HP in damage to get rewards, you are too low level to be doing SBQ, its just an ammo dump at that point.
---
You must be proud of being so bad you need to use a glitch to succeed :)
---
Wondering the same thing... if that‚Äôs true: I‚Äôm a damn fool
---
They need to do something. There was talk of some legacy system awhile back frankly the fact that no matter how high you level up youre still a lvl 50 is beyond old at this point.
---
Me to.
---
This would be especially helpful for items needed to fulfill active quests (tick blood sack, blodbug proboscis, etc).  Accidentally this this to myself - twice - tonight. üòê
---
It would nice of the free trial included trophies being added.
---
Screw the plebs with average PCs I need more clutter in my camp dammit!!!
---
In saying that, I'm a pleb with an average PC üò≠
---
PvP desperately needs a major overhaul.
---
Just an observation
---
LOL... I blew his left leg off and he froze (glitched) like that!
---
Sadly I was under the impression that's what Vault 94 was for, so if there's not four and five stars there what use is that vault
---
Ever get 3 .50 cal machine guns with alot of ammo and keep firing on it till your guns break. Thanks Bethesda for durability on guns. Now I have to weigh a ton to actually kill one on my own.
---
Once your high level it doesn‚Äôt matter cause you can just keep earning perks. I‚Äôm high enough now I even have woodchucker and other silly things. 
---
You‚Äôll also want your crafting perks like pharmacist and first aid. And damage multipliers like covert ops and tenderizer.
---
I think there's fertile soil for a game design that explores a more nuanced enemy morale system. See a guy with trash gear struggling to kill ghouls? Let's get him! See a guy rocking a full set of unyielding armor who just one-shot a scorchbeast? Run.
---
Play NW
---
with high scores from other players, so you can go to other camps and try to beat them all :P
---
What they need to do is work with Elinora and the OCDecorator creator for FO4 and figure out a way to make all junk place-able. There's no real need to limit where we can put stuff. I understand the limit to how many things, but considering how close to your base things stop loading, I think we could get away with a little bit more junk placing.
---
It depends what kind of build you want to play. Melee, Sniper, Big Weapons? With or without PA? For me, the increased sneak damage cards are most important. (I play automatic handmade and deathclaw for the queen).
---
It's happened where I've spend hundreds of rounds, and don't get any loot. And that's with all the rifleman perks and a 2 shot gauss and 2 shot handmade.
---
Eh, it is not hard to deal with the food/Thirst, it is wort the faster movement and reloads.  Most of the Mutations need a bit more cost honestly with Classfreak maxed, the loss is trivial outside of the 5 perk points.
---
Degenerates like you belong on a cross
---
I have 2 characters, level 3xx and level 2xx. After reaching level 250ish the xp seems to slow to a crawl. Leveling up for the purpose of respec is useless after level 250. Starting a new character is better than respec an old one.
---
I do not envy high level characters. They have limited choices ....but maybe if Bethesda implemented PRESTIGE! Then you would be sitting on a gold mine?
---
But you only get the 50 special points to distribute right?
---
I don't want to put say 8 into luck then find out I needed 12 or put 10 into strength and find I really only need 6
---
Theres a guy on PS4 that has one like that. I've been there twice. Not banned yet.
---
Hahahah
---
I dont need duped weapons to kill her solo in five minutes.
---
Agreed. I think the server should kick you to the main menu with 0 XP earned if you go idle for more than 120 seconds. It should then switch you to Team Fill Off by default.
---
Either that or a bunch of bouncing fucks with guns that kill in about a second even with the damage cap in a game with a built-in aimbot.
---
I didn't ask for PvP, and boy do I hate what I got from it. Starting to think the awful PvP mechanics are purposefully there to help sell Fallout 1st private server access. Remember when we saw the trailer for the game and the PvP appeared to consist of heated firefights ducking in and out of cover and coordinating with teammates to close on enemies through a hail of gunfire and carnage?
---
I get that people enjoy the given PvP system but holy shit is it not what was advertised. If you're having fun in it it's because you're focusing on it and likely griefing people who don't want any part of it as a side effect of looking for your gameplay. Instead of wasteland warfare, berserker beatdowns, rush-and-retreat skirmishes, and waking tank mayhem...
---
...well...*BOING* *RATATATATAT* *ded*
---
Rinse, repeat, try to shoot before they do this time. Or just bring a tesla/stealth boy. Dropped out of it and subbed to Fallout 1st so I could get away from it. Never seen PvP this faceroll in a game before...and have a community of players actually involved in it.
---
You guys do you, I don't judge you, I just don't understand how this is what people want.
---
To troll the people farming. The only purpose is to keep the bot from spawning
---
I just enjoy having an enemy that isn't 100% simulated and scripted to act a certain way because none of the enemies are dynamic and they all die in like 5 to 7 shots for me so having access to living breathing players where I can test strategies and different magazines agianst
---
Are you on Xbox? My base is like that and I have a sign that says play the bass.
---
I have a little town with four different shops for each of my vendors. I built it next to the ship and it looks like it's the natural end of that little road. It is also one of my best builds
---
Again, the bot has a *very* low chance of spawning there. There's other spots you can get it to spawn at, Charleston station has the lowest chance of it spawning. No one is camped there to troll, chill out and go farm it somewhere else
---
There were four high-level people I managed to take half their health down but couldn't kill them
---
I have 3 characters and I ditched my original character long ago, but recently came back to him and started rebuilding him.
---
You stop gain AP and health after 50 so it comes down to there gear and perks they choose not there level.
---
I assume you mean Halloween candy from Monster Mash? This will most likely be gumdrops and other stuff like we saw at mischief night. It's actually good for dailys that require you to eat candy and also normally counts as pre-war food.
---
Those Candies generally work as pre-war food for dailies too. Which is nice. I had a ton from mischief night.
---
Yeah, I used to leave them inside, move, and of course everything would get packed up and blueprinted. 99% of the time, my camps have something in them that won't let me just put them back down again, so I'd have to store everything to start over, and that would reset the vendors. At least if they're outside, by themselves, they're blueprinted apart from everything else, so they should remain even if you need to start the rest of the base over.
---
It doesn't work with pa.  They should really change the text on the card
---
Fuck
---
That sounds like stuff people said the first week, before anyone really had figured out the missions.  There's no RNG, there's just a ton of locations bits you need to complete the missions can potentially spawn.
---
Once you know most of the locations and the tasks inside and out it's just a matter of teamwork and cooperation.
---
 I have played with the Meat Hook and although it can one shot most anything, its so slow compared to my knives. The DPS an excited Combat Knife can put down is insane, and I can keep that up till my mouse breaks. We are talking 300+ at maybe 4 times a second.
---
HAHAHA, LET ME SHOW YOU ITS FEATURES!
---
LMFAOüòÇ
---
I feel your pain ‚úäüèº
---
from what i know the weight of your armor makes a difference
---
heavy armor seems to make quite a big difference compared to light armor wich shouldnt be a problem if you have like 20-30 agility but with only 11 that could very well be worth a look
---
You could, but digging bullets back out of bodies gets messy.
---
Once you stack up on improved repair kits, durability and repairing weapons is irrelevant üëç
---
We just need a big list of all the things in our camp where we can just delete anything from the list without selecting it with the pointer
---
Just start a new one. It will be nice once you hit 50 on your new character and then pick up 2 more lvls on your old one for those sweet scrip weapons.
---
Uh, the Christmas update isn't out until next Tuesday? How can you say how it looks, a couple pics on the website?
---
I am on PC, but I did the Halloween event dozens of times, and had a great time.
---
having the camp be underground makes no difference in a nuke drop, also you still take radiation while underground, while not the outcome i wanted it's still informative....
---
btw the couch was the easiest to break into the underground
---
This comments needs more recognition

Except in 76 you're all supposed to be hand-picked cream of the crop, best of the best, people that will rebuild the wasteland. For those people to, fight each other, makes no sense. Part of why I say PvP was implemented horribly.
---
How the fuck is this still an issue lmao
---
Except when in every case in history when you take an small isolated group cliques for lines get drawn and fights break out always happen some people just want the bigger stick
---
My stealth commando was my second character (first was melee power armor). Leveling him was nightmarish. My damage was so low and my ammo costs were so high. It's just a slog and I'm sorry for everyone who goes through it.
---
Try to defray costs by getting your 1400 a day from vendors, selling food, outfits (farm the asylum for those uniforms) and chems you don't need. Also events, workshops and their attacks, any non ammo intensive way to farm exp.
---
Dunno what your build is but for a few thousand caps you can have a full unyielding set and a bloodied gun by the time you hit 50, 45 if it's that kinda weapon.
---
Past 50 with the right gear gun builds become cheesy as hell. But it's so hard to level before that.
---
What weapons, perks and buffs do you use?
---
Last time that happened my body was laying there and camera spinning not able to respawn, 
---
I actually waited about 5 min in disbelief just venting about the game and eventually respawned back in the game and it counted as dying before the sbq cause i still got the rewards since the death was prior to event end and my body did stay in the event all along.
---
Idk if it works all the time but i will do that everytime instead of quiting and reloading game
---
That's why 76's narrative makes no sense. If fighting is inevitable, then a group of survivors rebuilding the wasteland is impossible. Except it isn't because every Fallout game before 76 had towns and villages where people are getting along and surviving just fine.
---
PvP exists in this game as a marketing ploy. That's all. Something to try to bring more players in. Like us being able to launch nukes. Why would you further irradiate and destroy the world you're tasked with rebuilding?
---
I'm confused as fuck that the top thread for today wasn't someone screaming about how Bethesda giving everyone a santatron for free is somehow ripping them off for having spent atoms on the regular one.
---
Because you as a person has a choice your not wrapped into a forced narrative where your the chosen one to save all of mankind from a magic space dragon . all the fallouts have been about choice regardless how polarising theyve been. And saying groups have been living peacefully is horse dung named a settlement in any game that is an actually Eden with no problems with factions or threat from the outside
---
The existing Fallout lore would indicate that there are no surviving elements of the Appalachian division of the Enclave by the time of the destruction of the Oil Rig. The ZAX unit that became self-aware and assumed the identity of President John Henry Eden did so only after the death of the existing Enclave President. Had the Appalachian division had its own claim to the Presidency, Eden would not have been able to assert his leadership claim, which he acknowledged was illegitimate but necessary.
---
You're missing my point. I'm not saying you should be tied to a narrative. Especially not in a Fallout game. I'm saying that the narrative shouldn't be written in such a way, that breaking said narrative breaks the integrity of the world you're in.
---
I don't personally care about PvP in Fallout, but I'm not against it being a feature. So long as the game narrative supports it. I'm 76, it doesn't. It makes no sense, in this world, to PvP each other or launch nukes. If the narrative allowed those things to make sense, I'd be fine with them.
---
And no, no prior settlements have been perfect. But they exist. They're, mostly, functional societies. 76 doesn't even have that. It's just a bunch of people with gravity defying bases that are only out for themselves.
---
Yeah, sure.
---
You need to have 5 in Intelligence to use all the crafting/repair/science cards.  If you play alone 4 in Charisma is enough for Lone Wanderer, can swap it out for QOL stuff like Hard Bargain and travel agent.   If you have mutations you almost NEED 5 for starched genes and class freak.  Endurance the only essential I'd say is aqua boy/girl; the rest of your points will likely end up in S, A, P and it just depends on your build or goal.
---
What happen when you take over a hundred people who know there the top of their field and you lock them undergroumd for 25 years
---
Great idea. Numerical camp budget would also be nice.
---
Nothing happened. According to 76, they lived in the Vault for the 25 and then went out, with the intention to rebuild the wasteland. That narrative right there, makes PvP and launching nukes not make sense.
---
Take Vault 51 for example. The story of Vault 51, which leads to Nuclear Winter, makes sense. It makes sense why we're killing each other, to become the next Overseer of Vault 51. That narrative is perfectly understandable and I'm on board with it, even though the game mode itself is boring to me. Story-wise, it makes sense why we're fighting.
---
You're talking about an exploit that tricks the game into thinking you're above the water, walking around. I agree, that's an exploit. That's not what I'm talking about. You can fire weapons underwater while swimming. No special tricks or exploits required. It just works.
---
Or you finally kill it and then you don‚Äôt get any loot?
---
True, it's nice to see that in the future there's still those assholes who put their Christmas sit up in October!
---
What weapons? Because you shouldn't be able to do it with a handmade.
---
Ok so 1. we are gonna apply a soft science here egos play a big role in redevelopment after a disaster
---
2. Vaults where social experiments with few exceptions every exception contains a geck.
---
3. I dont want to sound mean but the biggest factor here is human nature and unfortunatly humans are greedy individuals with only a handle of kind moments.
---
Just kill the guy with Godmode. It's easier than ever now.
---
Blueprinting a CAMP and trying to move it has always been ill-advised, bud. Sorry you experienced this.
---
That's fine. Write the narrative to support human nature then. Don't tell me we're going to go out and rebuild, if that isn't going to happen. Again, for example, if we all came from Vault 51, I completely understand and accept why we'd be killing each other. But coming from Vault 76, no, there's no reason for us to fight.
---
It's been in the game from the start.
---
That's what I do too! It's amazing.
---
Omg god so many times.
---
Except for the fact when has anyone ever done something they where told to do by a group of people with no authority over them. When have people tasked with a major job never deviated from it and why is it hard to understand that factions with there own agendas would form over 25 years or do you actually believe that every one was 100 percent sane when those doors opened and didn't completely lose it or lets just take it another direction incredibly intelligent people have issue distinguish right from wrong all the time. What if some people supported the ideology of the enclave who are all about searching out the genetically pure or they decide that the brotherhood make the better choices or even the responders. My point is simple conflict arises when people have different opinions when there is know law its whoever has the bigger stick
---
Nevermind man, you aren't getting my point. You're arguing a different point. Have a nice day.
---
Wish the dupers were still among us , i miss them
---
No I get your point your saying you dont like PvP and it dosent make sense because no vault has ever had an ultierer motive vaults 1 to 111 with the exeption of 101 being a control vault and I think 2 others. Just remeber vault etc always lied never take what they say as gospel
---
Ahh ok, then you‚Äôre incorrect. The game doesn‚Äôt look very good in 1080p, and my vision is perfectly fine thank you.
---
I run vampires and they cant kill me if I'm constantly at max hp
---
That's not my point. I don't mind PvP. So long as it makes sense in the story. Vault 76 is a control vault intended to rebuild society. So the narrative makes PvP not make sense.
---
In non-control vaults, it's just average people. So they can and will do whatever they want. Story-wise, if control vaults just end up fighting like all other vaults, then what's even the point of control vaults?
---
are these dropping more now? I went months without seeing one and I've gotten like 7 or 8 in the past couple of nights
---
So your saying its not possible for the cream of the crop to not follow basic human behaviors and mindlessly obey there orders and carry out the reclamation of the wasteland as an unstopible unified army of supermen?
---
It is possible. If the story is written that way. 76's story is not. 76's story has us rebuilding society. Period. That is what we do. Except we don't do that, with no narrative reason why we wouldn't. Other than, we're assholes.
---
I call bullshit. Hundreds of hours of work wiped out? How, exactly? The CAMP repair option takes 3 seconds, so it can't be that. And you certainly didn't spend hundreds of hours building your CAMP.
---
The obvious fact is that you weren't in pacifist, you DID fight back, and you lost. PvP requires a handshake. Even if it didn't, welcome to the apocalypse, buddy. A lot of us had to live through mandatory PvP and CAMP destruction early in the game. We didn't take to Reddit to tell stories that are so clearly fictitious that it would take an idiot to fall for it.
---
No its story is having us go out and start rebuilding. Nothing else we get no indication from other dwellers except for the overseer who was given a mission and even states we where lied to by vault etc about ever thing if you dont believe me go collect all the over seer logs they tasked her with locking down the nukes and going against what was left of the government if they where still active.
---
Oh, I feel you. Get a load of this. She was almost dead, and I died. But guess what. I couldn't respawn. The camera just spun around my body as I watched my comrades finish her off, with nothing but a "Press A to Respawn" at the bottom. I couldn't even bring up the start menu. So I thought maybe if I'm quick, I can quit the game, come back, and get a hit on her before she dies. Nope. She dies while the game is booting back up. I rejoin the world and get no credit, no quest reward, no loot. Thirty minutes of my time, gone. Poof.
---
I've already collected all her logs. Like I said, you're missing my point and arguing a different point. Have a nice day.
---
What is your point in confused are you basing it of how it was marketed or how the annoucer portrayed the game cause thats 2 different thing all the trailers protrayed it as a romp thru the wastes with friends as you blasted your ways thru badies the only time rebuilding is actually mentioned is ingame and even that can be a bit of a stretch
---
Been posts asking for this for a while now. Along with usable board games and caravan cards. Hope Bethesda eventually picks up on this as mini games can add a lot of value to player interaction or even just get people to stay logged on for extended time
---
Good to know all the bugs that existed on release are fixed...
---
/s
---
Actually I just reliezed you dont have a point you just didnt get the fallout story you expected and thats the point
---
That's not it either. I actually got more or less what I expected, despite Bethesda's unwillingness to explain exactly what this game was leading up to launch. I just expected it (the story and narrative) to make sense.
---
Ooorrrrr you can do the exact same thing at the soft serve, and have a higher change of getting it to spawn, and not be mad at level 5s that don't know better.
---
It's an incredibly popular game mode for everyone except PC players and people who thrive on complaining about how boring it is to hide in a bush for hours at a time (as if this wasn't obvious). If it's boring, don't do it!
---
My favorite part of the whole game!
---
Oh now that‚Äôs annoying. I have a floor sticking out the back of my house that I just can‚Äôt store or delete.
---
How are ppl still playing this game
---
aw man why not make it a predetermined place/time event? I really want to grab the new stuff but don't want to "play" the game, I afked the whole halloween event and was super happy :( dunno man this is sad
---
Console peasants. haha
---
That's easy to fix. Post a screenshot of the floor in question and everything connected to it or near it.
---
Hi mate. Yes, it wouldn't let me post a photo. 
---
The other nerd rage effects kick in - AP regen &amp; damage resist - but the 20% damage is missing... 
---
Is there a mutation or other perk which cancels it out? ie adrenal reaction mut?
---
For the Rebellion!
---
Hi mate, I'm ps4 &amp; yea, I had the width of a baw hairs health bar. A stiff breeze would have killed mu character on the health he had.
---
Thd other 2 effects from nerd rage kick in... AP &amp; dmg resist.
---
They're launching nukes to try and kill the Scorched. It's a player choice.
---
They're attacking each other because humans are imperfect and fight over resources. Again, it's a player choice.
---
The narrative supports all of these options.
---
literally ANYTHING gain related would be great additions to camps
---
I can't do it with a handmade. I don't exploit.
---
I‚Äôm not on now. But I think it‚Äôs got something to do with the stairs that‚Äôs attached to the floor next to it. I couldn‚Äôt place the stairs without this extra floor piece being there. So I built my house and it took hours and then later realised this floor was still there. I will post a screenshot in a few hours. If you can solve it you‚Äôll be my hero.
---
&gt; If you play alone 4 in Charisma is enough for Lone Wanderer, 
---
I'd say you need CHA 5, Lone Wander and Travel Agent, unless you are willing to swap in and out everytime you FT, which will get tedious fast.
---
If you're using ANY kind of rifle then PER 7, 3/6 ranks for damage cards a 1 for the Vats card.
---
LCK 5 is a solid point. Starched Genes for 2, then 3 Points for Class Freak, Bloody Mess and Super Duper as needed.
---
AGL 4 at a minimum. Action Boy3 and 1 rank of Adrenalin.
---
LOL!
---
Me too!
---
Here's the scoop. As far as the standard build rules are concerned, your base cannot be floating. Your base must be anchored to the ground somewhere. That annoying floor piece is currently your anchor. You need a new anchor, and THEN you can remove that floor piece.
---
well said. fuck the haters. all i have seen all year is every 12 year old , trolling sack of crap, still living in his grandmothers basement, hate on this game. NO game is perfect. funny, all these so called 'issues' people are having,i have not had 1 issue since launch. not one.  then again i have a decent pc, and decent internet, and know how to configure my router correctly. My personal favorite is all the threads related to ' hackers ' in nuclear winter. havent seen one yet. been playing for a while now. just because someone is better than you in a game, and beats you, does NOT make them a hacker. or a cheater. the other bullshit comments i read, is people trolling others, and hating on them, for using tesla rifles in nuclear winter,and stealth boys.  so fucking what?  stealth boys are easy to detect. open your eyes. and, who gives a shit WHAT weapon they use? git gud. lose the ego. practice. stop acting like a spoiled brat not getting his own way. its poor sportsmanship. people just dont like to lose. well, diddums. all part of life. sure, every tantruming 12 year old kid will downvote this post i am sure. because the truth hurts. but hey. cant beat the facts. if you want easy gameplay where you always win, stick to creative mode on minecraft. leave the real gaming to the big boys.
---
Outside Scorched, that should be enough (I had AGL 15, but still)
---
However, Scorched? AGL 33, Sneak 3, Fixer - Still getting spotted if I fire more than 3 times a minute at medium range.
---
It‚Äôs not floating it‚Äôs on the 2nd floor. It wouldn‚Äôt let me put a roof on either without this piece. It doesn‚Äôt hold anything up, it‚Äôs just sticking out like I was going to make my camp bigger. I send a pic so you can see it.
---
My thought has been Q1 2020, doesn't really mean Jan 2020. I wouldn't be surprised if we get a release date during the free to play period. It's just odd where they mentioned it, why say anything?
---
I played the Halloween event quite a lot, on Xbox, and only suffered a single crash/disconnect. This tells me that the problems were more to do with people‚Äôs own connections than the servers.
---
I would totally build an old school arcade.

At least it is just the SB Queen for you. :|

Hmm

I remember being your level and confused as fuck about the Nuke etc lol

Best advice is shoot at other things and hit the queen a few times, you still get the xp and credit for it and still get some decent end game resources
---
Thanks everyone :))

I find it amusing that you think someone who can afford such a low fee per month is a ‚Äúwhale‚Äù.

I would start a new one. With double XP coming up soon you will level up nicely.

Weird, I did the Halloween event about thirty times on the PS4 and never had a single crash. Oh well.

Hiya! Im a female who also hates pvp but i wanted that pink armor soo bad! So, i went in and you know, its not that bad after all. Okay, i play it a bit different than most, i bought camo under armor and some headwear to hide my bright pink hair. The wood armor is very good to hide in a bushes, i have seen guys run just past me without knowing im there. (Dont wear that blue vault suit!) So, it happens that im hiding and let people do their thing. If you get to the top 10, it gives more xp. Also, i use melee or silenced guns (crossbow) to kill ai enemies so people cant hear where im at. Team work is also good, i have few amazing friends in NW. Im our team medic. :D (i think this is my first message here, but just had to cause i loved how you wrote things about your wife)
---
This.. so after level 50, when you level up you can either pick a new perk or shift 1 special attribute around.
---
Can't be personal internet issue UNLESS you have slow internet speeds. I play on Xbox One and my console is wired to the internet which I get over 400mbps. I didn't play the event alot and had a couple of crashes I believe due to the server not being able to handle all the explosions. I also don't do many events due to the issues I have read about.
---
I just started, but‚Ä¶
---
I feel like Lead Belly is really important early on. Maybe later when you can bath in Radaway or the sun heals your rads you don‚Äôt need it anymore. But I feel I hardly find Radaway so far, and on the other hand I eat a lot to heal up. So this would give me a hard time otherwise‚Ä¶
---
Also, Green Thumb is really neat. Not only can I make some easy extra caps harvesting the crops in my CAMP and selling them to a vendorbot, but one hike along the river from Flatwoods to Morgantown gives me ingredients for enough healing cream for a few ‚Äúmissions‚Äù. So it‚Äôs just half the grind‚Ä¶
---
I for one would love a Powered Door that was in Metal or plain concrete, on both sides.  
---
For that matter, I really really want a proper Vault-Tec tileset for building.  Walls, doors, wallpaper, roofs, grates and floors.
---
Great additions to my idea
---
We've already had 4-star legendaries.
---
I run Bloodied, I use Unyielding armor mixed with couple of Chameleon. I only wear PA when I need the extra carry weight (extra 200 lbs) and or running through a Nuked area.
---
There is an unmarked bar on the hill top north west of Grafton. A tent, a bar, a piano and a few tables and chairs.
---
The place spawns a shotgun (behind the counter as always) a .44 and knife. Lots of beer bottle and a few wild dogs every now and then.
---
The place even has a light.
---
Could be a fun place to build ;)
---
Keep the character you currently have, and go ahead and create a new one. Just to refresh your memory and also so you don't lose whatever is on your main!
---
I think I get the intent of your rant but in all fairness I don‚Äôt think a ‚Äú12 year old still living in his grandmother‚Äôs basement‚Äù has much recourse to improve his situation.
---
I have a lot of success running an empath tank, heavy weapons, Power armor, with first aid/team medic and sharing the rad sponge perk.
---
It‚Äôs my favourite feature, alongside the scorchbeast queens health not decreasing at all because there‚Äôs just a load of low levels running round for the loot
---
I really regret not picking up the Free States pick-up truck when they first came around. I've been living out of the bungalow for a while now, and the truck would have been nice to stick around it as if it had towed it into place before being partial dismantled.

That‚Äôs a nice gun. I love mine. Absolutely can wreck. Take it to Heart of the Swamp ;)
---
You should start a new commando character
---
For me, it's digestive goo for making psycho and psycho-derived chems. I accidentally scrap that all the time after running down to pick up a fresh supply from the Bog.

Thumbs up for doing the right thing an restarting. Not everyone does that.

The daily quest give a big chunk of XP and they are usually pretty quick to complete

What's your weapon of choice for that? Bleed out syringer?

Not on PCs; all sorts of weapons being used (has to do probably with lot of folks skilled in free aiming via mouse)...
---
Wait does chemist affect anything made on the chemists workbench like lead and gunpowder?
---
Cos with all the bugs n crashes. Its not worth paying the full price. Lolz wish i waited a bit longer to get the game

Too slow.

Welcome to my Dross Toss troubles...
---
Ah, so you don't have an answer.
---
Man, playing this on PC must be wild. I‚Äôve never seen this stuff on PS4
---
This would be a great alternative.
---
thats called "missing"
---
I don‚Äôt know if it was intentional or not but after this weeks‚Äô update I got plasma grenade and mine plans both drop very quickly and frequently from Super Mutants. After update I went to Grafton, cleared it of Super Mutants and 75% of them dropped one of those plans. Thought it might be a glitch but could be a correction, I‚Äôm high level BTW over 200 in case that‚Äôs a factor.
---
I don't plan on giving away any of my long-held secrets. There are 3 core methods of killing a Godmode player. The Bleedout Syringer uses 1 of these methods, but it's far too slow to be effective.
---
Wait, really? I got them off of OP, but that‚Äôs quite odd.
---
Basically yes. I have a .50 Cal TSE and it only works for casual PvP'ers. You can replace the Tesla with other guns IMHO but the stealth boys are very important.  
---
Also, do not underestimate the power of the gamma gun. Even a lot of dedicated PvP builds have a weakness for radiation.
---
Oof. Whatever you need to feel superior
---
Read before posting shit - it's just one of many spots Responders bot spawns on the map.
---
That is a really nice camp. I like the style and placement of items. Really feels like a home, well done!  
---
What is even worse is that you can create structures that are impossible to remove afterwards. Had to rebuild some camps because of it.
---
Am I supposed to spoonfeed this to you? I figured it out in my own. Feel free to do your own work.
---
No, he's right. This is a bug.
---
Yes, this is a bug.
---
Where are these spawn rates located?
---
You are the one that made the suggestion to kill godmode players faster and now you want to taunt someone asking what you mean by that?
---
That's a pretty toxic. go bait arguments somewhere else.
---
I'd say the main thing is to think about what your playstyle is and what weapons you like. Melee/swords/etc have perks under strength, rifles have perks under perception and pistols have perks under agility. The damage boosts from these perks are definitely worth it and while you can move points around after level 50 it's a pain if you need to level up 10 times to sort your points out :) (Trust me - I had one character at level 120 that I decided to change completely to a heavy weapons build!)
---
It's definitely worth putting in general perks for damage too - bloody mess in luck for example gives a flat increase across all weapons.
---
The character builder on nukes and dragons is great to have a play with the different cards and have a look at what you might want to aim for.
---
You'd have to do a search in this reddit, all I know is that someone made a comment about it a bit recently
---
LOL. missing is NOT a bug. its called missing due to lag. it may have LOOKED like he hit, but he didnt. lag is NOT a bug.
---
Yep it will be like this for a while Tesla's should be fixed to arc off of players not the ground and quantums need a cooldown
---
He doesn't have to guess whether he missed or not. When you turn hit markers on, it tells you how much damage you're doing to another player. When you miss, you don't get a hit marker. When you hit another player, you do get a hit marker. With the Gauss Rifle in NW, you will occasional get a hit marker of 0, meaning you actually did hit the other player, but you caused 0 damage. It only happens with the Gauss Rifle, and is a common issue in NW.
---
Agreed, I played on Xbox one X and only had 1 disconnect. Got all the outfits and plans, really quite enjoyed it and looking forward to the new one.
---
Everything you said in your last post was either outright false or an incorrect assumption. I can't have a discussion with someone who doesn't live in reality.
---
This is why you see so many floating camps. Those guys just need to place one foundation, then drop their monstrosities onto the one piece as a blueprint.
---
Source?
---
Not even exp exploit will save them after 1000 tho. If some posts from long ago are right,after 999 it takes something like 200k exp to level up.
---
Who hurt you?
---
The resources required to ‚Äúkeep up with them‚Äù would be very taxing on any company and would likely prove futile.  You just have to accept cheating will happen.
---
Direkt gemacht vielen Dank dir :D
---
To clarify, it's not an exploit related to pacifist mode. It's radiation causing damage to everyone. All radiation in the game causes damage, and it's unlikely that the community managers are going to get the devs to find the competence to fix that without removing the radiation aspect of these mines.
---
Some mutations are an attack. They don't cause damage to enemies by asking nicely.
---
Try getting a VPN, a DDNS account and linking the console to a specific port, manually. It‚Äôs worked better for me since figuring it out. Although,  I do occasionally need to re-start the console for it to work. Good luck!

What do you mean? PvP in a post apocalyptic world makes the most sense sense. Having only duels like right now is what makes no sense lore-wise.

My favorite is when she just flys off the map.

Fuck that.

O...okay? No need to be aggressive

The highest what i saw was around 970 but that guy was fishy as fuck and im still debating if i report him or not (got a video and screenshots), he had a flamer that visually shot bullets ...

So check it out. You can make embarrassing attempts to insult, make wild assumptions, and generally make a fool of yourself. I get it. That's your style. I don't have anything to prove to you. I'm smarter than you. Your petty goading isn't going to fool me into giving you what you want.
---
If you want to use a Bleedout Syringer, be my guest. If you want a better way, man up and put the work in. You don't get a handout.
---
&gt;it makes no sense lore-wise.

They need to apply the NW Tesla and Noob Boy nerfs to Adventure PvP. The Tesla has a very small arc radius that makes it so that you can't just stare at your feet and pretend that qualifies as mad skillz. The Noob Boy nerf in NW makes you lose your invisibility as soon as you attack.
---
For me the three easier badges were Archery, Herpetology and Athlete.

This is a bug it honestly use to be even worse if you ever tried using a gauss rifle for pvp when the game first came out

You're the one saying spawn rates vary by location.

Unique walls for inside buildings? Like wallpaper?

Just scrip. Nothing good at all.

Try crafting a new set of excavator parts and see if you can get back the base +100 bonus with a mixture. It would indicate which part the paint killed irreversibly. It is possible all old parts are now dead so I suggest reporting this bug to Beth:  [https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)

And I said you can look it up, cause it was a comment I saw a few days ago or, and I'm not obligated to provide you with every single answer. You want the proof or straight answers? You can look it up yourself, it's not on me
---
With every new patch the game consumes more memory. How much RAM do you have? 8 GB on medium 1080p doesn't cut it anymore and 16 GB on high 1080p is struggling too. Also consider installing the game to an SSD.
---
Blueprinting is wonky. Why were you moving it?
---
I would rise Tank Killer to *** after lowering Charisma. Get rid of Travel Agent, you will have enough money flodding once you start selling some legendary goodies.
---
So much grind to be able to shot in shooter RPG. I call it bad game design.
---
never happened to me. what you are describing is lag. means u actually missed when you do 0 damage.
---
How do you fist queen? She have radiation aura O.o
---
Sad truths...
---
Gear: zealots trapper with harder to detect and str. Radiation backpack
---
Perks: important ones are stealth perks, ninja and covert ops, ghoulish so radiation heals me, and blocker
---
Buffs: 8 food buffs, there are 4 that give +10% melee dmg and 3 that give +15%, and deathclaw wellington for 3str. Whiskey and fury and radshield and bobblehead, magazine, and nukashine if you want.
---
Basically with the zealots gear and high radiation resist plus level 3 ghoulish, I'm taking very tiny amounts of damage when I get hit, and ghoulish immediately heals it back. I'm sneaking for the entire fight and I just clear adds and wait for the queen to land. With maximum buffs and the stars align, I'm hitting for 10k, but on average I'm hitting for 5k when in caution, depending how many buffs I'm on.
---
I feel like spitoon sounds better, lol
---
Is the camp device in your "stored" tab? That is what would happen to say a workbench...
---
Legendary Explosive weapons or Gatlings are what most folk tend to use SBQ needs a high DPS. No problem doing this at 37 I run a bloodied build and still die plenty at 100+ and the higher levels will be looking out if you stay close. Just remember its a team event.
---
Do you know if the western outfit with chaps is also a Christmas reward? I just got this today, and have never seen it before.
---
"This content is too difficult for my build and/or skill level, therefore it should be made easier."
---
What the fuck is this mentality even? Entitled little brats.
---
You want the best armor in the game? Work for it. That's how life works.
---
Then practice and get crazy good at it??? That's how life works?
---
What the fuck is this mentality lmfao
---
SSD
---
This.
---
bloody mess,adrenaline,demolition expert,nerd rage ,blocker ,lone wanderer ,starched genes
---
Man honestly if be playing on pc if there wernt so many more hacks available on there
---
Ok yes I forgot to put PM. So I‚Äôll be on at 6:30 PM and my gamer tag is Mrdeathray607.
---
I have a full set of unyielding sentinel and a full set of vanguard cavalier but the everyday armor i use is a mix, i am a level 178 and im not a pvp player and when i have killed the queen it has always been in x01 pa. My current build is full health melee because i think bullets are a waste of resources. When i fight the queen i use my AAE primed plasma gatling, primed AAE 50cal and zealots LMG and i switch to heavy gunner perks. The only reason i use all thise weapons is because i will swtch instead of reloading.
---
But i get what ur saying thanks
---
I would follow the main questline, overseers camp, flatwoods,organtiwn airport, Charleston hospital, fire Dept. Then start taking workshops, just claim,. Defend, then leave.  If you have teammate(s) tag high lvl enemies and let them finish the job. Well rested always, canned meat stew, or cranbery products( juice, cobbler, Relish).
---
The meta was, and still is, a 40% HP Bloodied (unarmed) melee build.
---
3 sentinel pieces, 2 cavalier pieces, 2 poisoner pieces. You can completely ignore mobs while accessing a terminal for example
---
How are they trashing it exactly? They cant destroy anything unless you initiate pvp.
---
I put all my stuff I wanna transfer into a blue suitcase or container because it holds more. Then log out and switch to my other characters. I spawn into my same private world I left and pick up all my stuff. No more asking people to move stuff. That alone is worth it. Me and my buddy are sharing the payment so this month I pay. We both fill up each other's junk during the month.
---
We were all friend in the vault, there were no violence. Why are you suddenly trying to kill me. Was it the indecent? I thought we got past that.  I sorry I man I don't feel the same about you, that you feel about me. I forgive you for trying to kiss me. But I like girls.
---

---
ü§î
---
I don‚Äôt think so but not sure. I think that‚Äôs a rare drop.
---
I'm pretty sure you do become wanted for attacking a camp right? Did this change?
---
Even if you did become wanted you still arent destroying anything until the owner initiates pvp.
---
He's just trolling and doesn't have any friends
---
I want prostitutes at my camp.
---
Isn‚Äôt it discontinued during beta?
---
Do hope the Santatron isn't limited time only
---
Repair kits are free. I have probably a couple hundred between two characters just from the queen alone. I never use junk to repair anything.
---
Actually the collectron has an advantage over junk nodes -- as far as I know junk nodes don't give you ballistic fibre, but the collectron does.
---
And he tells jokes...
---
Omg is this still a thing üòÇ
---
I don‚Äôt pvp enough (at all). That is evident in the fact I don‚Äôt know what any of these acronyms or jargon means, lol.
---
downvoters. git gud
---
Dude just go back to fallout 4, clearly you wasn't meant for online games.
---
Lol upvote for you.
---
When is the next double xp? I was thinking about starting a new one.
---
Were there any talk on this subject? I really liked the survival mode :(
---
Dude! Why are you trying to move a building that size?! Blueprints works great for modules and modular buildings! Not a full fleshed fully decorated CAMP!
---
You think the developers decide what goes into the game?
---
I've never saw someone post as much as you in one day lol. You just found the internet didnt you.
---
I carried around like 10 at one point placed them on a sleeping raider and unfortunately didn‚Äôt die. (Fallout 4)
---
I have a feeling you may not actually be playing FO76 for your information is incorrect.
---
I think you should use whatever is available. I use and get wrecked by Sbs and I use Vats because I suck at aiming. I'm just trying to survive lol
---
It's not like that. You can do more damage and get nothing or just tag her and get juicy loot. I think it is server bugging or something. It happens to me often.
---
I feel you man, I dumped all my points in agility, and don‚Äôt have a lot of gun perks.
---
next week, [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7MJVLws9DRhH6OpzAXfLde/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-update-16-highlights](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7MJVLws9DRhH6OpzAXfLde/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-update-16-highlights)
---
How many times have you killed the SBQ? Have you really changed anything?
---
I hope they add something for pvp in adventure mode, a small pvp zone would be nice. Of course there will be an uproar bc it will be someones mole rat farming spot. As if the game isn't 95 percent pve already lol. I like pve too, but I'm not spending my end game having fashion week with people trading clothes and admiring them.
---
Is this like the nuke mines. My bloody guy has been killed a few times by people placing nuke mines by me while at the vendor. No pvp is needed with those.
---
yw
---
Nuke mines can kill you without pvp
---
Change lock and load to a heavy gunner card.
---
I know you like the weight perks but I wouldn't use portable power. A power armor chassis with all the parts weighs exactly the same as an empty power armor chassis. You probably only really use one power armor. So that is basically 3 perk cards to reduce your weight with 7.5 units... Even if you carry two chassis on you, it is still a 15 units weight reduction for 3 perk cards. Both situations seem like a waste of perk points. If you carry 3 chassis with you, why?
---
Yea I do have hit markers on but when I‚Äôm using a different weapon it hits just fine
---
If you got something locked, people can unlock it to get a bounty and trash your camp afterwards.. it's so stupid
---
Just don‚Äôt use scrap all. That easy
---
Yeah, but we're talking about camp destruction.
---
Gauss rifle was my go to in adventure and survival
---
NW is atrocious in that regard, but I have to yet meet a blatant cheater in adventure.
---
I don't understand that part at all lol
---
That's my take on it as well.
---
You can see addictions under effects tab in the pip boy. Your damage should be different when comparing a junkies and instigating. Junkies should be 50percent higher if they‚Äôre the same weapon
---
Don't care about teslas, but if somebody produces explo laser + stealthboy, I will do the same - but really only as a counterattack, as I do find them cheesy as hell.
---
Nice ty
---
Whatever you can do. I always used to get shot in the back of the head by bloodied builds. I started doing little things like look behind me and stock up on berry mentats. Really for me it comes down to making people think the WS is wide open when it‚Äôs not.
---
And does that show when inspecting the weapon ?
---
Yeah the damage on e lasers is nasty.
---
Yes
---
Its all quite simple and it has happened to me  several times player lobs a mine shoots it I die pvp or no pvp
---
I heard about that recently and tried it. Out of habit/muscle memory, I just smelted the ore really fast and turned around and rapidly made ammo, so I never did the actual math to see if it worked. Anecdotally (and that's all it is), it did seem like I was able to produce a lot more ammo and ended up with a lot of lead scrap to spare. Not a very good answer, but yeah, maybe?
---
Its not about pvp if they lob a mine and shoot it you WILL take damage if not die
---
Do you tho?
---
Any confirmation on that?
---
Video Game.
---
I must be doing something wrong then. All addictions active, inspect instigating Gatling plasma and Junkies plasma both have the same base damage, really want to sort this out
---
No, looked there too :(
---
Can‚Äôt, won‚Äôt let me place it as is, as I have stuff on different levels in a river.. argh
---
You have to equip the item for the damage increase to display. Additionally none junkies weapons will also show an increase in damage but that‚Äôs just a visual bug.
---
The constant back to back stagger attacks are just lame, I've been caught for my entire health more then once, unable to even move.
---
What are you chatting about? I wasnt giving information I was sharing my experience of what has happened to me in game???
---
If they make the stash box free I will demand my money back lol
---
I also love when you see a 3 star legendary glowing ghoul at whitesprings, you enter the house and your game crashes, when you restart your game you have lost all your junk :D
---
Is that right? I‚Äôd like to know
---
you, you, muuurderer, hahahahah  üòÇüòÇüòÅ
---
Yeah people sell them for 10-20k ish :p
---
Yet you're the one making a ranting post on Reddit, and here we are. Sigh.
---
Not really. It's probably been the best thing to keep Fallout 76 alive, frankly.  It's given them a decent cash infusion.  Would you prefer they keep it on life support with 1-2 devs and eventually kill it off?  Nothing is free, and the one-time purchase of a product doesn't actually fund the ongoing running of servers.
---
Oh, cool!
---
Seriously? I bought a few off a level 20s vendor for 50 caps each. Does the price change between forest and urban?
---
A lot of the tricks in building won't let a blueprint work. Like flipping half walls to get things in tighter and positioning paintings where they can't go. You can remove everything around what you want to place then place the blueprint, re-do any tricks.
---
It used to be things snapped into place, but after an update it changed. Like you can blueprint a wall, but if you attach a floor item in the blueprint, the floor item can move now in the placement, doesn't snap. Experiment around to see what works if you want it moved in sections. Try blueprints in sections with the foundation, it keeps position this way.
---
Anyways that looked so nice. 6 hours is nothing! Last time lost camp it was, don't even know but it was more than 6 hours! I keep a couple blueprints of the rad shower and vendors to restore, that's about it.
---
I just can't wait for all the duped stealthboys and quantums to run out. It's no longer a contest of skill, it's just a war of attrition.
---
Dang lucky you :D nah I think they're the same.. they're rare now only from event drops
---
This one is the happiest death in all the wasteland haha :)
---
If I remember correctly it was a limited time atom shop thing.
---
That's what I thought, thanks.
---
Truly so?
---
Yeah it was an atomic shop item a month back or so. Not available anymore.
---
That's a shame, is there anything even relatively close to that?
---
Is the glasses cavern the best/only place to get ultracite or are there other places?
---
Yeah it's one of the main perks of 1st #nopresentsforpeasants
---
#NoPresentsForPeasants
---
Not really, considering some things you place in your stash will still get scrapped if you are not careful. 
---
Whats really "that easy" is a toggle similar to the magnifying glass for sought after items...
---
My response is passive aggressive? Didn't mean it that way, thaldoras really is skilled *shrugs*
---
yeah man I want stuff
---
Harsh but you are probably right I havent enjoyed it since reaching level 100 anyway. Time to load Red Dead..
---
Yeah, a wooden shack.
---
Last couple wanted guys killed, couldn't vats them and they were running.
---
Not unless you got the greenhouses which were also in the atomic shop. I‚Äôd say those are the closest thing and that‚Äôs a stretch.
---
Puke at the pvp guy. I like that lol. Made my think of the guard in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, "I fart in your general direction"
---
Although we believe it is, supposedly you can actually EXTRACT Ultracite! Although the downside is it's rather slow to extract. Near the fissure site is where you can extract from is also the problem. But if you want to get ahold of Ultracite, Scorchbeast are a big help.
---
Nope, missed those as well lol. Maybe I should pay attention when these thing are released
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be a true Bethesda game without that.
---
Where is this please?
---
Ignore the cards. Turn on dmg numbers
---
I ran uranium fever a few weeks ago and the urban and forest scout mask dropped. Along with three jumpsuits.   
---
I‚Äôve been told that the savage divide is the best place to get them. 
---
Just keep grinding those events and it‚Äôll drop!
---
Favorite day one problem is that disconnect from queen fight. Really wish they would of fixed it already.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Responder%27s_plea  ‚ÄúThe tape is found on a dead Responder inside the fridge in the kitchen of the tavern in Flatwoods‚Äù
---
I have trust issues now.
---
I can open a wall in the back so you can get your junk, nothing to fear haha :)
---
They come back from time to time. I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much.
---
One might be forgive, if they think it's part of the game.
---
I'd like to know who has all these sbs lol. I've never saw this fabled hoard. I dont doubt it was duped possibly, but I've yet to seen that any of those are left.
---
Hey man ive gotten a forest camo jumpsuit, scout masks and a PA plan from these situations so just be happy we actually get loot now. The problem with your proposition is that it would only wprk for events that end on a timer. Most of them require an action to be completed before the timer runs out so there isnt really any set time you could program an event to not apear.
---
In F4 there is a location with gas bottles set up un a ramp. If you shoot to valves you can launch them like rockets.
---
I don‚Äôt think it works that way...
---
There are usually veins of ultracite around the fissure sites, and I think they also appear in nuke zones. But glassed caverns is the most abundant source
---
I've seen it work but not tried myself
---
Bit off topic but used to be a bug way back, you'd see the animation on you if someone in the area had it. It was common to see the serendipity animation at the queen non-stop xD I'm pretty sure it worked with pa too, back then everyone had on pa or rad suits.
---
Cant enclave events only. Its a 0.01% drop
---
I tip my hat to you sir. That is just damned fine construction.
---
Also "Working for the Company" (don't remember if that's the correct name" by Willy Moon would be a great addition to 76.
---
Are you sayin it can‚Äôt drop from uranium fever?  It most definitely did.
---
I also have daddy issues.
---
It used to be 8pm EST but it was changed to 7pm EST if I'm not mistaken. I believe this was because of daylight savings. Biv's daily quest and the scout leader dailies are on the same timer as the raids. You can use the personal terminal from the atom shop to keep track of their reset times (assuming you ran the dailies the previous day).
---
Gerne. Bin im Spiel Frischmix. CAMP unterhalb der Nuka-Fabrik.
---
glass caverns has by far the largest concentration.
---
Also found in limited quantity near the edges of fissures. 
---
Some iron veins in nuke zones turn to ultracite.  Be aware in either near fissures or nuked veins,  soon as you mine it, a pack of scorched will descend upon you.  IIRC, its usually about 12.
---
scrapped scorchbeast bones and wings.
---
Skyrim was fine until you came along! Empire was nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you I'd have stolen that horse and been halfway to Hammerfell.
---
Yeah, and previously you had to pay caps to get there!
---
Sure you can.  Just make everyone wait while that one guy has his moment.
---
Yeah i do admit that for me hackers/modders etc is one of the reasons why i prefer console gaming.
---
Show must go on. And will go on and on and on.....
---
The stairs are bugged too (the ones built into a grated floor). They don't seem to count as stairs properly.
---
For example I use those stairs to build an upstairs. While building that upstairs I accidentally put on an extra floor going outside the building. I'm now stuck with that because it apparently can't be removed or something would not be accessible... it actually doesn't understand where the stairs are, so it doesn't allow you to remove any flooring. I say that because you can add a proper set of stairs elsewhere and it then lets you remove the extra floor piece now. Because it knows the way up is via the new stairs. But... you can't remove the new stairs you've added because that's the only way up... despite the bloody original grated stairs being there the entire time but not being acknowledged as stairs. They also don't seem to properly count as a floor piece either.
---
You need to plan so far ahead when you're making complicated build using those stairs! That could do with fixing. Hopefully just a tick in a box somewhere in the geck.
---
Yes.  It's the American Dream.
---
Nope its a enclave item look it up...
---
Thankyou for your help, much appreciated
---
I don‚Äôt have to look it up.  I saw it with my own eyes. 
---
It dropped from uranium fever.  Troll.
---
Just never get off the Mr Fuzzy ride and you'll be fine.  Fiiiine.
---
Santatron will remove his Santa outfit and stand revealed as Fisto:  fastest fist in the southwest.
---
Savage Divide events aren't just the best place to get them, they're the only one. For 0.01% drop chance levels of "get them". They do not drop from Enclave events because that would make too much sense, apparently.
---
(Ps4) I ran the halloween event many times... had a couple laggy moments on some sessions, but never crashed/froze, etc.  Might be b/c after each run, I generally quit the game. took care of IRL stuff, logged back in 30 min later for the next iteration.  Lather, rinse, and repeat.
---
How am i trolling? Dude i have over 700 hrs playing this game enclave events drop scout gear unless you get it from a legendary. Some drops are by certen events. Enclave evets are events with the tag enclave next to it.. theres no way you got one from UF
---
np :)
---
Man, that is so messed up, and so wonderfully creative! Top stuff!
---
Yeaaaaah, after I got a really good 3\* legendary super sledge (Anti Armor, 90% weight red., 40% some other affix) from a SBQ I decided that was it, no more SBQ. Getting the remaining ultracite plans wasn't worth it with all of the issues with SBQ. When I was playing I just ran silos and nuke other areas now. Over a year later and the game still can't handle this lol
---
&gt;The sense of futility
---
I gotta admit, I stopped playing this game for a good 8 months because it started getting depressing to me.  I wish Bethesda would amp up the wackyness a bit.
---
So 700 hours makes you a pro on every thing.  Just cause I got it from uranium fever and you say I didn‚Äôt, that doesn‚Äôt make you right.     
---
And I didn‚Äôt get one.  I got two.  Believe it or not, Mr 700 hour pro idiot.
---
Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries.
---
You're such a drama queen. Shit happens in video games and life
---
Solid junk farm.
---
Very true haha :)
---
&lt;3
---
I got mine from doing One Violent Night. I actually got two at the same time as well as two jumpsuits. So based on the post above, something tells me those drops were probably a glitch.
---
And who do you think had the final say on whether or not something online can be accessed by a Sony PlayStation... hmm... I wonder. 
---
Regardless of what Bethesda said, only Sony had the ability of authority to enable that function.
---
Not how that works. They have to be in PvP with you, getting a bounty is just the first step to do that.
---
I'm still patiently waiting for the pointing and laughing emoji.
---
Exactly! thats what I have been trying to get across but some people arnt getting it. Ive been at my camp minding my own buisiness when a player decides to lay a few mines and shoot. Even tho I have pacifist I die and my camp gets destroyed. Even better as its an indirect attack the other player gets away with it.
---
They cost a TON of materials to run and almost no one drops any junk. No one is profiting from traps, this one is a minimum of 35 copper, 35 circuits, 50 steel, 18 screws, 18 aluminum, and a bunch of wood to set it off once :)
---
Blocker.. I like taking happy go lucky over lone wanderer, but stealth guy. On team rad sponge and inspirational. Perception is all damage/tank killer and 3 points to swap in cards like green thumb, the picklocks, concentrated fire. Grenadier is good too if you use explosives. Int at 5, can use weight reduction perks like portable power and batteries not included. Demolition for explosives or early on gunsmith keeps you from repairing much. Bloody mess, tormentor, class freak, starched genes.. So much you can swap in there. Good to have ammo smith and super duper for making ammo. Weapons artisan, fix it good, white knight.
---
Late game you don't need gunsmith imo, should be rolling in stuff. Commando is something you might like too.
---
Thank God air is still free...
---
You really don't know what you are talking about.
---

---

---
You rank the level 1 cards up to make them 2/3.  You should have those cards by lvl 150. Look at the bottom of your cards. There a a rank up button. Or there will be a x2 under them. That means you have more than one and can rank them
---
Had something like this happen a few nights ago. 
---
Did two SBQ runs back to back, My loot after both runs was 20 Harpoons and then 18 Harpoons on the following run. 
---
It was weird, You usually either get the normal loot or get nothing at all... I got Harpoons. Nothing else, Literally just Harpoons. Weird.
---
I wouldn't go so far as to say it's not viable for melee. You can't use unarmed weapons but radicool perk still gives a nice strength boost when radiated. With a bloodied weapon you're still doing a ton of damage, more than enough to quickly kill most things in the game.
---
I would think the build independent always equipped must haves are, at minimum:
---
glowsight, starched genes, class freak, green thumb, fireproof.  first aid, pharmacist, Lone wanderer (if you usually play solo), actiongirl/boy.  If you have the points, bloody mess.
---
Usually in PA: batteries included, power user
---
energy weapons: batteries included
---
heavy weapons: bare arms, stabilized, the Str one with the picture of a tank
---
melee: incisor, martial artist, gladiator
---
Swap out as needed:  ammosmith, gunsmith, armorsmith, makeshift warrior, fix it good, science, hacker, lockpick, hard bargain
---
It didn‚Äôt work for me either. This player was attacking me at my camp trying to pvp with me and I wasn‚Äôt biting. So he then lockpicks my acid extractor right in front and gets a bounty. He then starts shooting at me and objects at my camp with his explosive weapon and nothing. Nothing damaged. Dude is just wasting ammo. He tries for another 10 minutes and then gives up
---
I think next year they need to work with more modders they are so lucky to have some incredibly talented people on there platftom
---
Somehow ive got to level 180 blissfully ignorant of the game mechanics then. Perhaps you could enlighten us?
---
Each solution was faulty though, that's part of the problem.  
---
K-52 got something like a B+ if memory serves. These were submissions by grad students, these protocol weren't really meant to be implemented, probably because everyone assumed it wouldn't matter. Yes, Vault-Tec is notoriously cruel to the Dwellers, but this just smacks of neglect, not cruelty. Hell, much like the Vault beneath VTU, this was likely just among the test program for graduates. In the long run, they likely would've had engineers design something that actually worked.  
---
Hell, maybe they did in other Vaults and that's why we've never really bumped into it before.  
---
I forget the protocol for Meltdown, but what always stuck with me was the grade for Washout: F.  
---
Someone submitted a procedure so outright terrible it got a failing grade (and experience would indicate that grade was correct.) But it's implemented because they had no other submissions, with the hope that next semester would offer up something better.  
---
But there's the issue isn't it? Hope.  
---
They hoped there'd be another semester. They likely hoped these would really matter. Hell, the residents of Vault 94 hoped to meet and help survivors. The guys who shot up the GECK probably either hoped they'd find something of value within the Vault, or hoped they were protecting what they cared about by opening up a fucking Minigun on a piece of hardware they didn't understand.  
---
Everyone hoped to see tomorrow.  
---
We're tomorrow.   
---
And maybe we hope to do better than they did.
---
Oh gotcha. Well at least a solid schadenfreude farm.
---
Not really. There was an inside the vault and they said it was done 1 Oct or something.
---
I do like transferring my items to my mule in the private world as well.
---
Duncan donuts dunkin turbo
---
Yeah same... In pacifist and still get nuke mined while selling stuff to the vendor. Happens every time.
---
I‚Äôve been saying this since FO3! It‚Äôs not hard especially now!
---
I just jump around with my Explosive Gatling plasma
---
Don't understand what they get out of it. It's not like I have anything to drop and they don't get any caps since we are not in pvp.
---
Or she falls into an ultra cute pit
---
Sorry for the confusion. I have some perks with multiple levels and I have ranked them up. I use level 5 gunsmith for weapon building and level 3 tank killer for example.
---
I do know that I can manually select the weapon skills. I just choose to use level 1 of each of the 3 different rifleman perks. But I am wondering if anyone hasn't gotten weapon skills from the random card pack that include the stick of gum?
---

---
, amazing work man, I've started doing a little bit to my Camp to show off the exploding red rocket sign as most people have never seen it actually explode. The look on their face when they think that they've just entered PVP for destroying something in my Camp is insane.
---
How much does it cost to repair that every time you Set It Off?
---
Maybe it got fix so people couldn't grief :) nice to know
---
FEVex raider couriers.
---
A hardened raider version of Fedex, mostly black with purple highlights.
---
Sorry, I didn't see you had already posted how much it took. Do you put contractor level 2 on before you repair it?
---
don't duel meat hooks, they cant fight back, it's not fair!
---
Very nice, in borats voice lol.
---
Again, why are you comparing the two? This is a multiplayer game compared to a single player one, ofc the single player one is going to be more stable.
---
Lol yeah I've fought some of those. Whatever works man.
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
I feel like melee is pretty much strong enough, especially meat hooks with the double-dip in perks.  Pistol really need the buff of dual-wielding.  A SHield would be interesting, especially if they also worked with pistols.
---
Dude I wish! Survival was the best.
---
It's a great weapon, I still have one of them and every time I find a level 51 I purchased to give to somebody. Really fun for burning up 10 ammo in the forest regions.
---
i just run a combat shotgun/harpoon+strangler heart,  i may die because im a "dirty food build" or something, but at least the acid stacking makes them eventually rage quit.  cheese as fuck but it sends the message im not wasting much time pvping you.
---
You need legendary armor with poison resist for mirelurk kings and queens. Just two pieces will make a big difference against how fast those can melt someone.
---
Haha I promise it‚Äôs not ;)
---
It doesn‚Äôt collect junk unless you own both.
---
What really grinds my gears is when a scorch beast queen goes out of it's way to attack me, and I start to fight it, use tons of ammo, and once it gets to a quarter of it's health... the bitch flies off. Pure rage sets in.
---
I use low level characters for all my traps, this one is a level 17 :) so if I have it I use it and friends share it with me. I think it doesn‚Äôt lower the cost on most/all the traps because they are all at 1 per to repair, but I could be wrong. Thankfully I have a big group of friends and a lot of people donate materials to me :)

Trade glitch
---
Hmm I read that at least 3 times as a "Sanitron" and thought, WTH is this? Robot cleaner?
---
I dont have a lot of experience with heavy weapon builds, and neither with Power armor builds which usually go hand in hand with heavy weapons, but i do have a good amount of experience with hybrid and rifle builds.
---
First of all you have to concider that a hybrid build will always dramatically underperform compared to a "pure" build, because you spend a lot of perk points hybriding that you cant spend on these valuable specialization perks that make or break a "good" build. So with a hybrid rifle/heavy build you will be an "okay" rifleman and an "okay" heavy weapon gunner but you will not be good in either, dragging out your fights as well as costing more ammo overall because you lack specialization damage.
---
With that out of the way, 100% necessary perks would be bloody mess as well as nerd rage. You might also want to pick up radicool because a bloodied build will always have a lot of rads on them, hence boosting your strength by a good bit. It would only be mandatory on a bloodied melee build tho.
---
The rocket is a pretty fun one! I used it for my second funhouse and built a bunch of silly stuff with it at Billing‚Äôs Homestead :) Peoples reactions are the best part! Most people I run into come back and heart at me haha
---
You're right about the server issue but it IS also a client issue.  The client has to load in all of those objects as well and it can be taxing on older system and consoles.
---
Lol
---
It's already on an ssd and running 32gb RAM. It was absolutely fine before the last update. Also I might need to clarify, it's making ALL my storage drives run havok.
---
I honestly haven't played in a few weeks I've been so frustrated with this game... yes I assumed it was Halloween Candy, my b.
---
Yeh, I saw this during my playing. Amazing guide, thank you so much!
---
sometimes I wish these things would happen to me so I wouldnt have to feel like people were full of shit when I see these posts...
---
Ah to me (UK time) that was yesterday! Guess its not rolled over yet. Really appreciate the response though. Wish there was somewhere online I could check it !!! Hint hint anyone with website skills.
---
That Rad Ant Challenge took forever. Server hopping the Deathclaw substation place and trying to beat the Claw to the ants.  Jeez. Resorted to running straight in with a flamer to do broad damage, even then the ants were usually dead before i got there. Not worth 10 atoms but then i had nothing better to do lol.
---
You know we don‚Äôt use those here right?
---
Someone stole something and since they can trade their stolen goods you want access to the place where the goods were stolen from so you can pick a few free items for yourself because you aren't able to benefit from the robbery. That sounds like someone acting entitled to me.
---

---
* One thing to keep in mind is that power armor has a bonus damage reduction (not shown) when worn, so even if you have a higher DR than power armor, that hidden bonus is something else. 
---
* Part of the damage from Mirelurk queens is their spit, which you need poison resist for, thankfully isn't a primary effect
---
* I would slot unyielding gear until at least you cap out all of your DR perks.  
---
* I personally would move some of the END over to AGI and take Dodgy and Action Boy.  Even just 4 points (dropping life giver)
---
* Sentinels can be a good additional legendary effect, anything else to reduce damage 
---
* Convince your team mates if you're going to tank they should all have empath.
---
Same!
---
&gt; Toys are, in fact, some of the most valuable junk in the game, because many of the toys contain screws... 
---
Screws, pah.  I always end up selling them.
---
&gt;  screws are required to repair armor.
---
Which I hardly ever need to do.  Most of my armor repairs also need ballistic fibre, which I can get from the collectron but not the santatron.
---
Although I suppose you'd slowly go insane.

Hi. Here‚Äôs some screenshots of my camp.
---
id suggest switching evasive with dodgy 
---
other than that, tankiness mostly comes from your legendary effects on your armor
---
your build is fine i dont see a problem there but you probably should look out vor vanguard/sentinal pieces youll see a big difference pretty soon
---
the thing is that a lot of enemies seem to use attacks that bypass armor similar to the Anti armor legendary effect (exspecially gutsy robots are known to melt through your healthbar)
---
if you have effects or perks that reduce damage by a flat percentage youll get way tankier
---
Honestly dont remember, but I just think you got unlucky.
---
200+ perk cards ingame.
---
you've gotten around 30 packs at lvl 150 = 120 perk cards
---
and since you can get duplicates, Im guessing bad luck.
---
Umm....you said you "played it for quite some time" 
---
That means you had paid for and were maintaining PS+ at some point.  
---
  Don't know why you stopped playing, don't know why you let your PS+ subscription lapse, but that you no longer have PS+ is not BGS fault.
---
That does not mean I don't understand your annoyance.   When I bought 76, I did not have PS+, and it wasn't mentioned in any ad copy as a requirement.  When I found out it was, I was probably about as mad as you seem to be at the moment.
---
The code for the card specifically checks if you're using power armor, so it's definitely intended.
---
They just need to give everybody marsupial and bird bones (or 2x if you already do), and then negative speed effects, and you can simulate the moon.
---
Fisto made his way to appalacia
---
LMAO!
---
I'm sorry bro I just really want to wear your skull
---
I am so, so sorry.  I've had that happen twice or three times now and it's such a discouraging feeling.  Take a break if you have to.
---
But I really commented to tell you how beautiful your camp was.  The interior decor was so well put together, and your really used the wallpapers to your advantage.
---
Put a turret on it as naval defence ü§£ Seriously though that‚Äôs annoying - when you want to do it you can‚Äôt and when you don‚Äôt you get it regardless
---
Sounds way too powerful if you ask me dual wielding should be used for pistols because they are weak
---
Well the dailies change 3 pm (UK time), so no change yet. It used to be 4, but pesky daylight savings screw that. So if you wait a bit and still in work, I will post you an image.
---
Ammo becomes the limiting factor in this game once you hit lvl 40 and start having access to serious DPS. It's the most bullshit way to balance a game I've ever seen.
---
Put a turret on it as naval defence ü§£ Seriously though that‚Äôs annoying - when you want to do it you can‚Äôt and when you don‚Äôt you get it regardless üòï
---
If you hop servers it stays.
---
I hear it in my sleep now ahah
---
But you already used it for so many days, right? Plus you get your "free" Atoms and "premium" outfits and emotes and your very own private world? So are you admitting that the scrapbox IS the most pay to win part of the subscription? Then why do people like you defend Bethesda when others got mad when the game came out and demanded refunds for the game?
---
You still have to pay to fast travel to events unless it's a public one
---
If your holding a junkies weapon all cards will show junkies numbers. Make sure your not holding anything when looking at non junkies
---
I know I have received them in the packs. You need to ‚Äúpick‚Äù those perk cards when you level up. They are in your cards, you just have to choose them.   I noticed the other day I didn‚Äôt have a card someone was talking about. When I scroll at bottom, it‚Äôs not there. But when I leveled up, (not getting a new pack yet), I could choose the card. Does that make sense?
---
If the last time you played was like 3-4 months ago, apart from the Halloween things and Atom Shop items, you haven't missed anything at all.
---
That thing is so annoying.
---
Okaaay thanks

He better also shoot missiles at everyone for being on the naughty list.

I played 450 hours on pc so far and had only 1 crash, guess most crashes are hardware related ?
---
The biggest problem I have these days is when she gets insta-glitch killed before most people can get registered tags on her (you have to do a certain amount of damage to get credit for queen kills).  Happens often enough on PC, there's some players using an exploit that kills her instantly.  Other times, she still gets killed too quickly anyways because what we have today can kill her off too quickly...  its Uranium Fever woes happening at Scorched Earth instead with people not sharing.
---
I thought about that but need the millions of lights instead, can‚Äôt waste budget on something useful like a turret.
---
I only have about 160 dr and I wreck scorchedbeast and queens no buf I am lvl 100

I already have 9 in int but will probably move a point or two later as I got cards to craft and dont really need 9 points.
---
Not sure if I should add to luck.  I was thing four leave clover and grim reaper perk cards
---
Melee is already the best DPS in the game with the right perks and gear.
---
 Let's try to balance out the rest of the weapons 1st.
---
No offense dude but this is what‚Äôs wrong with F076 
---
There are bugs everywhere in standard gameplay (floating ghouls at WS) and nerfs to weapons and damage galore but spending 6 hours on a camp?   Seriously? 
---
They need a FO76 SIMS version for those that just want to farm and build shit.  I just want to shoot and blows stuff up including other players.
---
Any recommendation to farm steel? I‚Äôm farming the can charms atm 9 steel per charm per serverhop with 2 locations it‚Äôs about 250 ish per 10
---
I still watch Futurama every single night.. Still my favorite show of all time.
---
What's your hardware and your settings so? Jesus, help me, because with good hardware and standard setting it just crash every day, should discover a secret set for play finally good this game XD
---
&gt;philis401 
---
Good still doing this?
---
right... but I don't want to hop servers :)   I'm saying, I want that behavior, but I want it on the server I stayed on, later.
---
Honestly the rate you are going is really good. I cant think of anything that can beat that rate of productivity right now. But ill let you know if i find something.
---
You'll have a limited amount of time to get it from the shop, and when the Christmas event is over, it won't collect presents anymore, but it will continue to produce candy and toys.
---
So, it doesn't entirely replicate the function of the Collectron.
---
This.  I have a bloodied gamma gun with FFR and a bloodied radium with FFR and both are sneaky good because of rad damage.  Also do not underestimate nuka or pumpkin grenades.  Same deal with rad damage.
---
I have a bloodied auto railway rifle with FFR and next to my quad explosive harpoon gun it might be the most entertaining weapon in the game.
---
Well what was the correct reaction in your eyes? Just go "oh, I just lost hours of work due to an almost irreparably broken system, but it's ok, shit happens lmao"?
---
It sounds like you will be able to switch what santa will collect thru the terminal but the junk/scrap option will only be available to those who own the OG collectron. Can't have two robots walking around at the same time but the one robot will be able to do both jobs. He just can't multitask. It would be nice though if santa collected scrap while collecting toys and candy so we didn't have to turn off scrap mode during the event. Guess I'm going to have to go find a junk node to camp on until New year's.
---
Use what?
---
You know
---
Your mistletoe is no match for my T.O.W. Missile.
---
Can you tell me then, im a bit confused since they changed it.....I see events with the exclamation mark on the map. If the event i want (say tea time) doesnt appear as a (!) - do i need to go to the area to trigger it as i used to? Will it trigger anytime? 
---
Sometimes the daily is to follow the robot policeman around morgantown but i can never get the quest to start.
---
I have no idea what you're talking about
---
You can receive any perk in the game (excluding NW specials) in the perk packs.  
---
For example on my nuclear winter character I received rifleman and expert rifleman from perk cards without choosing them. I also currently have 3 concentrated fire perks rank 1. First level was from a perk pack, I manually choose the second one, because I wanted to go rank 2 and received golden (animated) one from a pack. Also not counting the many heavy and melee weapon perks that I got.  
---
Furthermore I vaguely remember that Godd Howard mentioned the RNG is skewed to perks in your lower S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats, which should be taken with a grain of salt ofc. It was to encourage discovering new paths and playstyles.
---
If you can run West-Tek, do so.. Use the scrapper card and scrap all the weapons.. You can find a chemist station inside, but to optimize just do all the mutants outside (and behind the building) and then fast travel to the town directly south ( forget name but its also full of orcs).. It has a scrap station in a trailer.. Just cycle, server hop and repeat... For a bonus you run the chance of getting a legendary enemy at both locations.
---
Oh! Go to West-Tek, kill super mutants, take their weapons, scrap with the Scrapper perk.
---
They're two different objects that do two different things. The paid one does things the free one can't
---
Cool ty guys, well all‚Äôs good. Now just gonna spend an eternity trying to get someone to part with a JE handmade, think my inventory will take a big hit!
---
I think it's not as much about older systems, just load times.  The more custom stuff in an area means it takes longer to pull data down from the server to your client, means slower loads.
---
In addition to what's already mentioned, I've seen ultracite veins in the lode barring event.
---
You would stand no chance against my B25 FFR primed handmade.  I took down multiple players this morning including someone with what i believe was a VE LMG with FFR and it couldn‚Äôt keep up with the handmade.  My BE printed auto handmade is also pretty effective but not as good as the B25 FFR. 
---
I have a Quad auto Tesla with FFR and like my AAE Gatling Plasma and AAE Gatling Laser they are such cheese cannons I just don‚Äôt like using them. 
---
Now, my bloodied gamma gun with FFR and blooded auto railway rifle with FFR are a different matter.  Two of the more underrated weapons in the games
---
Seeing as it's pulling teeth to get a "Rejoin Last Server" option without having a friend on the server to anchor it, I wouldn't hold my breath on this, but if/when they ever add that, at least it will be easier to relog.
---
Thats what I was thinking at first but i didn't get to test it yet. Lol. Plus he will get great XP bonuses with it too! üëç‚ù§üëç‚ù§

Nah, I experience this on four different PCs that are in two different countries.
---
Is not hardware related, is one of this 'is not me, is you' kind of situations.
---
Can also happen in Xbox and PS4.
---
It can also happen in FO4.
---
This bug is... a veteran of the franchise.
---
They have this option for Elder Scrolls Online so I would have thought they would use the same system for this game as well. But I agree I have accidently scrapped items that I didn't want to. I keep losing Jangles and had to be careful not to scrap my toy alien for lead or my vault tec alarm clock for springs, I have since put them on display because I was sick of checking.
---
Yup!
---
Please don‚Äôt use emojis here buddy
---
Wait...Fallout has more than 1 dev?
---
Please don‚Äôt use emojis here buddy not cool
---
No like interior walls with wallpaper on both sides
---
Thanks. RNG gonna RNG I guess. Just seems weird that I could possibly miss entirely all 20+ types of weapon damage perks after that many attempts, but definitely could happen. I'll just have to manually select them when I finally decide to switch things around. My plan was to switch my main weapon type to whichever damage perks I got the most of randomly, so none in my case. Rifleman for 150 levels and I'll just have to choose my next weapon myself I guess.
---
As others have noted, having just one piece of Poison Resist armor will at least give you a shot to Stimpack yourself and counteract poison damage from the Mirelurk royals.  Two nerfs them altogether.
---
DR/ER has diminishing returns.  I used to run a high-health Vanguard setup, but once I ended up going Unyielding/Bloodied and taking those damage mitigation perks, I found I was arguably *more* survivable than with Vanguard alone.
---
No need for emojis nerd

With the recent change, Public events (with !) are on a list with rotation, so RNGesus or server jumps can help there. Tea time is always with exclemation mark, since it was in the rotation for public events.

I don't have a male character to try this on, but it wouldn't surprise me.  The Nuka-Girl costume used to have similar problems with the exposed skin looking low-res or misaligned.
---
Cool keep that in mind for when you build one
---
Sounds good!
---
Except zoidberg he gets a pogo stick.
---
3 points (3 cards @10%) in rifleman is enough to one shot everything up to and including sgt. Gutsy's with a lever action. No need for more. No reason to extra kill stuff. Spend the rest on hw for the big guys that need more than 1 shot.
---
Right. But you used to pay for all of them.
---
Just seeing something rare doesn't mean it's Duped.  Sorry, it's confirmation bias.
---
I had the Plasma Grenade plan drop on me.  I've been debating what to do with it.  If I bring it out for trade, will I be labeled as a duper?
---
The problem is auto rifle perks are really on perception and intelligence and luck.   Not so much on strength as you would a heavy weapon or melee or shotgun build.  
---
To me, the auto rifle build is most versatile because of weapon categories and ability to maximize fire rate and dmg.  Railway and combat rifles.  Obviously handmades.  Fixers.  I believe Gauss and Tesla and maybe pipes benefit from the rifle perks as well.
---
this has really helped me fine tune my build, and understand how certain effects work.
---
No probably a good healthcare system no wars and a clean invironment you live in. Ah and you should get a checkup you can get leprosy 20 years after you got infected. Better safe than sorry
---
I went from rifleman to heavy. If you go into heavy I wouldn‚Äôt recommend bloodied. I went from bloodied sneak rifleman to bloodied heavy, so from hiding and shooting to being the target, and I went down a lot at first. You should shoot for something like junkies or even just AAE. More depends on what you like playing, but I‚Äôve loved the decision to move to heavy.
---
Just to let you know you being there upscales the Scorchbeast Queen, she gets harder for every person there, and you not able to pull your own weight (even with the adds(since you can't even use a max rank level 45 or 50 weapon)) really makes it tougher on everyone else
---
Mirelurk Kings might be toughest enemy to defeat because their poison ability can take you out in a hurry and their dmg resistance is pretty decent.
---
Ok
---
I thought that correlation might not equate causation, thank you for clarifying.
---
You have to personal deal enough damage to the queen for the loot to drop
---
It can be done, but need to do a little trick with using back to back doorways and changing wall type- but I agree with you there.
---
Nope. If you had multiples of it a couple months ago you would have been. But now? With so many of them on the market? Nobody can tell.
---
Hehe was thinking exactly this
---
I run a bloodied melee / heavy gunner with no PA unless I‚Äôm in a SBQ fight and I don‚Äôt go down often.  It‚Äôs all in the gear.  I‚Äôve used a full set of unyeilding, a full set of bolstering, and neither of them takes care of me as well as my current set up.  Right now, I have one piece each equipped of Zealots, exterminator, troubleshooter, ghoul slayer, and mutant slayer.  Each of these pieces also has the sentinel perk, so as long as I‚Äôm standing still, I get a 90% damage reduction 75% of the time, no matter what type of enemy I‚Äôm fighting.  Add on serendipity and dodgy, and I‚Äôm like Neo from the matrix, everything goes right by me.
---
  Perhaps the bigger issue is ( I would bet ) the vast majority of the player base has no idea if an item they find in a vendor is duped (or not).
---
This forum is only a tiny portion of the player base, and while I participate here, I could not repeat a list of item that are Legacy/NLA, be they weapons or plans, nor do I know point of origin for every weapon, plan, or outfit.
---
For example:
---
  I know there's a large number of taxidermy heads in game.   I know some taxidermy heads are event rewards.  I know I haven't completed every event there is. 
---
I know I can kill a fox in game, so if I find a fox head plan in a vendor....how am I supposed to know it shouldn't be in game (yet)?    I just figure the seller has done an event I haven't, or done it enough that a 'rarer' plan has dropped.  I buy it, I learn the plan, and put the head on my wall.  
---
Since I now know the plan, I can craft the head at will, so I put the plan in my vendor.  Someone else buys it.  rinse and repeat.
---
Does that make me (or subsequent buyers) guilty of being dupers?  I don't think so.  The "responsibility" of knowing with 100% certainty whether an item is legit (or not) cannot be transferred to the player, and as such, simple possession cannot be grounds for banning.
---
Happened to me just now, I don't wanna live anymore üôÉ
---
Oh yeah. Has happened to me several times.
---
F
---
Damage and accuracy on explosive lasers is crazy.   Almost impossible to beat someone with a legacy auto explosive laser or auto Tesla with FFR which is why I don‚Äôt engage people with them. 
---
I can more than hold my own as I‚Äôve got several god tier bloodied auto rifles but someone pulls out one of those cheese cannons and it‚Äôs tough to defeat them unless you have numbers
---
You do realize that they released an unfinished broken game. Then removed basic features from the game to sell it back to you later. Then they changed the settings of the games to make it more grindy and then they sold you the solution. Now they are taking it to a whole new level with fallout first where they are selling you "new" features that the community has been asking for (for free). A monthly membership that costs more than a regular game subscription from a different provider. 
---
This isn't just a regular game with microtransactions. They are trying to milk every penny out of this game and it seems like it's working. Based on all the fanboyism I see on these type of threads. You deserve to be walked all over by Bethasda because you keep bending over no matter what they do.
---
Well, congrats!

Good luck, lets hope bethesda doesnt noticeüòâ

Enjoy your exclusivity
---
I‚Äôve got a POS laptop from Walmart, and I don‚Äôt have these issues. I think the game crashed once in the last month for me.
---
I've gotten to where I just chase them. Like "nah. Not today."
---
I have one of each, although I like both I'd say the Heavy is way more fun. And you don't have to plan anything or be cautious. Just walk up to the mobs, squeeze the trigger and hose the general area at chest height until nothing moves, total carnage, bodies and parts of bodies flying, cars exploding. Its like your own mini Mischief event. You'll need an umbrella for the raining blood, and a pack of smokes for later because its almost that satisfying to mow down the ghoul golfers ;-)
---
They are sort of rare but not that rare. I even scrapped a few when i saw I had several in stash and didn‚Äôt remember where they came from.
---
Ohh yeah. I made a post about that too. It sucks. It literally takes some one shot to kill em. I could do It, but Im not an *ass*.
---
You can‚Äôt fit a hole camp in one blueprint but can make blueprints to stack together. No able to get the camp placed somewhere else I think it‚Äôs all about the wiring. If any of it goes threw another object than it‚Äôs all to bits and many hours of rebuilding . I‚Äôve done my camp som many times cause I forgot to switch solid walls to doorways or had wires go threw window frames. I Don‚Äôt use the tubing that goes threw walls. So when I relocate I take down some wires just I case. And I think you have to have home defense/science  perks on if you have turrets
---
Lmao Ive done it too but then I ran into the edge of the map.
---
Thank you

.ini custom settings?
---
How toxic is this sub dude? Lol. Ask a simple question concerning how the game has changed in recent months and people downvote. So petty
---
do whatever the hell you want
---
Yeah, to my knowledge "Halloween" candy only comes from Monster Mash. All the other candy is just general year round type candy. I spammed the hell out of the trick or treat bowls during mischief night specifically due to the "eat X amount of candy/cakes/pies" or combo there of I'd seen come up earlier in the year. That's also how I discovered it counts as a pre-war food, And it's so light. I ended up giving a lot to friends when those challenges have come up since.
---
Quickest I've managed to do it was 44ish hours - But I didn't do much in between so it might be the 180 item count
---
Once again, this is top tier stuff. Where is this camp located so that I may give it a spin?
---
Of course. Lol
---
That's right.

The UwU pit of doom.
---
Maybe you have missed the legendary scorchedbeasts ? Or the purveyor to trade in legendaries ?
---
You surely missed the "1st" thing and the tents and recycle boxes flourishing everywhere ;)
---
Oh god, dude I'd be so mad
---
Ik! It's kinda ridiculous.
---
It was mildly infuriating, yes.
---
You can beat them easily actually. Just wear leather use insulated backpack and a few other things. I know this bc in full damage spec and me and my buddy were owned by a guy with huge er resistance. Didnt have my other guns st the time. Just couldn't do enough damage to him.
---
You're right, all mirelurks should be given pogo sticks.
---
Ill add it!
---
Finger guns
---
There's been plenty of player suggestions they implemented for free, player vending, vault raids, legendary recycling vendor... They didn't have to add any of that shit, the fact that they work to improve the game based on player suggestions makes me happy to play. Also no one knows if the Collectronbot, which I assume to be what you refer to when you say they "then removed basic features from the game to sell it back to you later" was ever going to be free. It could be like the lunchboxes, which were removed after people were upset the atomic shop wasn't cosmetic-only. The game is meant to be grindy, it's a survival game, even with their "solutions" the game is still grindy
---
It seem so, what do you think about overlapped sounds processing? Could be a reason? For example some light bugs were just a translation bugs (more difficult to find I think)
---
They‚Äôre just being clear in advance of the usual trolls
---
Right?
---
Go back a little earlier.  The first multi-user video game on the internet is Netrek.  It was  build by computer wizes at CMU, Berkeley, MIT and other universities.  The first time you ever saw online video gaming forming leagues and running tournaments was around 1993 ~ 1994 (i'd have to go lookup things to be sure).
---
The term 'Ogg' game from Netrek (you may have seen it in the open-source audio format ogg).
---
The problem is, smart people, access to source code, yeah, cheating became a problem.  You saw the first bots come out then, and what was cool, was you also saw smart people tackling the problem.
---
You have some powerful solutions that came from that period.  The protocol was UDP, and originally unencrypted.  The first step was just to encrypt the protocol and require privately distributed keys to the selected server admins.
---
Regardless, you can actually build stuff that is hard to circumvent, but it requires a platform to support it as well, and coders who know/care.
---
If I were doing it now, I'd use a cascading crypto system (yeah, this stuff has been around for decades, it's nothing new with crypto currency) -- all the way from the boot level on down.  If the image signatures don't match, it won't run.  Then require it runs in a protected memory space that disallows introspection, etc.  The packets have to include a level of crypto that is signed not only matching the release version key, but also the OS's boot key, etc.
---
If/when it becomes a big enough deal for them to want to fix it, they can.  The problem is, that really is driven by "does it hurt our profits" -- and frankly, cheaters pay just as much as others, so ... no, it doesn't.
---
It‚Äôs right beside white spring station, have to keep that traffic up haha. I‚Äôm building on a different character now, so it should be around for awhile :)
---
Not sure but I would try the perk to resist fire/explosion damage and in the current case of mirelurk Kings, wendigoes and scorchedbeast, the sonic damage.
---
Yes this and junk we don‚Äôt need. Just spamming the take button threw the wasteland, lol
---
Oh yeah. I hate that as well. Itd really suck cuz I FINALLY got a one shotter. Id be livid.
---
I run a bloodied rifle build with a full unyeilding set. That's +15 to everything but END when my health is low. But it absolutely doesn't work in RAD zones or heavy combat.
---
I've got a suit of X-01 with Emergency Protocols for that. And man, what a difference it makes.
---
I went to whitesprings in my unyielding - I have to avoid close combat with the ghouls because I'll die in basically one hit. I put on my X01, and I was able to let myself get surrounded, have a teammate hit me with a fat man, and then tank another 7-8 ghouls with my bloodied pick axe. Without dying. From 20% health.
---
The PA causes a huge drop in specials, but I think it's absolutely necessary for survival in certain situations. If I'm going to have to ditch the unyielding anyways in a nuke zone, I'd rather don PA than a hazmat suit.
---
Ive not had social media besides facebook for a year. The instant replies doesnt help my craving for interaction either.

Many redditors already noticed this sentence. It was all over the ITV related posts and while I can agree it's odd wording, we have only a straw to hang on. So perhaps wait and see.

Not really.  See my other post in this thread.  Follow the root motivations.  Stopping cheaters doesn't make them more money.  But if there was a reason that did connect to the budgets, then they would.

Ive had it happen a few other times too, but sbq is like getting blue balls.
---
Thats true but if i go auto rifle and put points into commando then i cant use my gauss without switching back to rifleman
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll def try it out there. And I might just have to start a new alt. For 200 some levels I was getting the same kinds of drops, but now I‚Äôm starting to get handmades and heavy guns and all sorts of interesting gear.
---
Good occupier for me.

What?

It's simply THE BEST.

No offense never heard that. And they're all over even this thread... buddy

Yeah it just works now.

Oh yeah. Ive had that happen before. Luckily a buddy was in already.
---
we know how to harvest SBs, i can get like 40/day if i needed to.
---
I honestly don't know.
---
As opposed to other bugs present in the game that I both understand and know how to fix (the ones that pertain to 'the language of the engine' if you will) this one seems to me pertains to the engine itself - given that I have previously experienced it in FO4 and is, as opposed to gameplay *wink wink nudge nudge* cross platform - therefore located in that faraway land where ASM, C# etc live and I dare not visit ;)
---
I've played since BETA and the same thing happened to me over the summer and I haven't picked the game up since nor will I.
---
Do you have some sort of game bar, shadow play, or other recording stuff running? 
---
Maybe try disabling you storage drives in device manager , see what happens?
---
Lol yes.
---
I like what you're doing here but you should do more testing, especially since this is the most well known source to get 600-700 steel in about 15 mins.
---
I assumed it was just idiot proofing the announcement
---
Ok no offense never heard that. And btw they're all over every thread I see, even this one lol...
---
I figured it is for people who haven‚Äôt played and assumed that next free play would be when wastelanders is released. Basically it‚Äôs them saying ‚Äúnope... not yet‚Äù
---
About 1000 years
---
The NW crossbow would be nice.  I would love to find a mid level quad to hang on to for alts doing the tadpole archery.
---
It‚Äôs why I stopped playing. Spent half my ammo and two guns trying to take one down by myself and right when it was 2-3 hits away it crashed
---
Not true at all, you don't need the best gear in the game to do either of these events.
---
They make videos on youtube of fallout 76.
---
how else would we "lock in the flavor"?!
---
Np brother. I just thought it was funny.
---
More "basic" building items. Like the glass/greenhouse walls and ceiling from fo4. More carpets and floor mats. Curtains. And bungalow camper skins&lt;3
---
Anyone using tap water??
---
You should put up a ‚Äúride or die ‚Äúsign
---
Oh.
---
It's just a waste of time at that point
---
My group was talking about this last night and are running theory is because the people that don't regularly play that would be trying the free trial, they probably don't know that wastelanders got delayed so they want to be specific that wastelanders will not be in for the trial
---
Load times are the most easily noticeable effect, but once the game has loaded the 1000's of items into the computer's memory, the graphic system has to 1) keep track of the location of each item in relation to the player camera (their 'eyes') as the player moves or looks around, and 2) render all those objects, in spacial relation to each other, in as close to real time as it can manage.
---
Load times, from the server to the PC, as well as from disk cache to the graphic system, and even from computer memory to GPU memory, are effected by object density as well as memory limits and transfer speeds.
---
Most game/system combos are capable of doing both with reasonable speed.  But the more it has to keep track of (# of polys, and the graphics/maps of each of them combined with the lighting and other effects), the more it has to work.  Throw in enough item density and your system starts to have too many things to keep track of.  Then multiply ALL that by draw distance, and throw in mobs and players popping in and out all the time...it's a lot to deal with.
---
So it is really a combination of things, any of which can cause slowdowns.
---
Wait...so poison bypasses all my defense? GTFO you solved my issue if this is true because even SBQ im ok with
---
Damn dude! My catapult camp and your Carousel of death would be fantastic.
---
Was he sitting on a mountain top contemplating life or chasing ghouls like the rest of us? üôèüèª
---
Awesome haha and perfect song choice
---
Hah. In theory, at least to help get wastelanders out yeah :)  If you do some guesses and back of the napkin maths... I heard a fairly reliable source that said across all three platforms there is around 100k active players.  If you say 30% tried out 1 month of 1st, and 15% bought a year (I suspect the #'s are higher, but..)  Then, take 50% off the top for the various market's overhead (PSN/XBox), that means in one month after 1st came out they probably had around $1mil in profit.   So... yeah, it helped them to focus more than 1 dev on things -- at least for wastelanders :)
---
Yea man. I can deal with the stealth boys, or teslas, but when someone's using both it's like ok now let's try to have *some* skills here. The problem is people hit boxes are so fucking small its almost impossible to hit someone with a regular gun without VATs. Eliminating VATs in PvP would be cool but they would have to increase people hit boxes a little I think.
---
If you inspect it should say the value on the bottom of the description.
---
This is incredible
---
Also, scrapper and running uranium fever event gives you a lot.

I like that one! I started with ‚Äúfun fun fun‚Äù but needed a bit of budget haha

Tell me about it dude. Me and my bro try to pick fights with people all the time and many times out of no where word got out to a pvp group and 10 people show up with stealth boys and teslas. Yes, lemme just get my ass handed to me repeatedly by people you can't see who have guns they don't need to aim....

I tend to see them from 3,000 and up.

The Responder Vendor Bot isn't the easiest thing to find, and it's also extremely vulnerable.  The chance of it having a Long Coat at all, while re-rolled every time you log in, isn't guaranteed.

Sorry I don't know what this is?
---
also the legendaries I get will help but it looked like unyielding increases all BUT END so how does that help make me tankier?  
---
Sentinels is great but I haven't found ANY yet
---
I'm starting to think the poison might be my issue
---
and people actually still play? kinda sad that people are still grasping onto hope that‚Äôs literally nonexistent it seems
---
It'd be nice if they gave us more "used" walls and wall papers.
---
My opinion is that hacking a terminal should not give away your cover at all. That's a pain.... I can sneak past anything in power armor carrying a bag full of "whistle and bells" junk and as soon as I hit the Enter key of the terminal  all mobs from the building know exactly where I am... it is like mirelurks and such all have a degree in computer science :/
---
I sell mine in the vendor for about 3k. I've seen between 2.5 and 5k
---
Bravo! These are some serious build skills on display here!
---
Yea I'm thinking this is they way to go. I originally didn't like that serendipity only worked when I'm almost dead in the first place but there is not better luck perk for tanks.
---
Many have brought up dodgy. I'll incorporate that with some stat fixes coming up. Thanks
---
Its the melee that wrecks me, which I would think is odd b/c I have the blocker perk (-45%). Anyway, I think the poison people are pointing out is on to something I had no idea about.
---
We are now inside the original release time that wastlanders was scheduled. This ITV features the Christmas events. These must have been programmed a while ago (would not be smart to talk about something not ready), and maybe was mostly written at that time.  So it could be a timed holdover from before it was delayed.
---
But what else may this imply?
---
If they cold have blocked wastlanders for the free trial, that most likely means it will be another separate game mode.
---
I have a really great stealth sniper that I love to play, but I have a huge amount of trouble in the reactor section of V94 raids because of this.  I‚Äôm usually trying to use my phone to take a photo of the instructions, because I don‚Äôt have time to read anything.  Lately I‚Äôve been bringing a shotgun along just to kneecap everything into immobility.  It feels kinda lame.
---
you bet your shiny metal ass!
---
I try not to link video here as much as possible but you should look at my old Atomic Rollers and the mobile Brahmn launcher videos, they have great springboard traps :)
---
I think in general the springboards are the most fun and cost effective trap :) all these Tesla arcs are fun but they cost a ton. Atomic Rollers throws you into my friends Camp off a giant cliff, it has a Brahmn dispenser too haha
---
3 triple-scorch beast attacks on your camp.
---
2 hour community manager response time on a post about a camp that players are using to kill people with showing positive praise, zero response on any of the posts that have been up for months about duping and hackers and the various ways these things are hurting the game.   
---
Bethesda you can do better, please do better.
---
* Empath is a mutation that makes you take 33% more damage, but your teammates take 25% less.  So if you're up front tanking and at least one has empath, you'll be taking less damage.  
---
* Unyielding as you go down in HP will give you a bonus to your other specials, which means you'll start getting a bonus with perks like Barbarian - basically it would be a similar effect to the Bolstering armor.    It will also give you a higher AP pool so that you can use Dodgy
---
Another great spot with slightly less menacing enemies is Pleasant Valley Cabins near Top of the World. Either Miners, Scorched or Super Mutants, usually in the 14-22 lvl range. This is where I make my steel runs if I just wanna run it and not really have to pay attention to what I'm doing
---
I have three questions. 
---
1) Do you sell everything in your C.A.M.P. vendor for the value listed on the item description? 
---
2) If so, are you on Xbox? 
---
3) If yes on Xbox, can I buy all your legendaries and rare uniforms?
---
Thank you! I‚Äôm just trying to be the best random encounter I can haha :)
---
I jumped servers and 6 times in a row everyone was over 100. It's faster to fast travel to event spawns than server hop.  I could hit 2 spots instead of one if people wouldn't camp there. And you know its on purpose because they attach their camp to she shack. It's just people being toxic.
---
You can be killed with nuke mines but they will not hurt your camp? Are you sure you are on pacifist? Or did they hit your camp with an actual nuke, cause that would do the trick.
---
Well Hell's Bells! Played around with this a bit and sure enough Crits proc on every 3rd or so round. Now I just need to retrain my fingers to hit the right button at the right time... Thanks again for the input!
---
Maybe this ITV was written before the delay and they just uploaded it with correcting.
---
Why don't you want to server hop? It's not like you find out after you've been in for a bit...I'm honestly just curious.
---
But instead of server hopping I can hit 3 event spots then hop if I dont find him. It's faster to fast travel than server hop. Server hopping loads slow as hell
---
I'm just going to throw this out there but whenever you "drop" items there is a slight delay in when the bag appears. When the bag does appear it will be wherever your character was at the time. Example: If you drop items and then run forward, the bag will not be where you dropped the items, it will be somewhere along where you were running. It's possible the bag exists and is stuck in the air. The "drop another bag" trick likely doesn't work because the game considers the other bag too far away (it will typically re-use/combine bags if they're close enough together).
---
in the fallout universe, PvP style encounters were always pit fights because any idiot could headshot you easily with guns, so it boiled down to melee and thrown weapons only.  the lore of the world was always single player until fo4, so the concept of PvP itself never applied. 
---
fallout tactics failed for a reason.
---
So maxing out those rifleman perks really doesnt do that much extra?
---
2k is a good price, but people are willing to pay up to 5k for it.
---
Okay so, you play not so much time, with most of funny functions disabled in a op gpu... I can understand why you never experienced any crash or bug; I can disable explosions on my custom.ini and anymore crash, but... it doesn't mean that those bugs don't exist and haven't to be fixed, and is it the same game without explosions on my weapons? Am I wrong thinking we shouldn't disable all for stop crash and bugs in a normal gpu like a 1080?
---
Hahaha glorious!
---
It‚Äôs easier to server hope Fort Defiance for ants. As soon as you go in if you hear mole rats then exit. Usually 2 or 3 ants with the bugs if there‚Äôs no rats.
---
Someone just gave me one in The Whitespring several months ago.  Just walked up, dropped a bag and shot at it.  Hunters Long Coat.  
---
Thanks, random stranger!  I still have it and still wear it on occasion.
---
The prima strategy guide has a rarity set for each of the perk cards - Concentrated fire is considered common, while rifleman is rare.  Though it doesn't clearly state it in the guide, I took that as the rarity of the cards from the pack (since it doesn't make sense otherwise, since you pick the cards).
---
Damn, a little deep there, Socrates.
---
Thanks the mutation sounds good but I'm sure that will be a tough sell as my team plays alot solo.
---
Unyielding points I want to ask some questions about:
---
For the stat increase I'm already at max for barbarian (80) with base 15STR. I don't think this will help. The AP bonus helps sure I can see that. Lastly I just though about luck, does that increase the odds that my perks will work for the reductions/dodges? If so do those two alone outweight the DR? I think they might
---
It's not about "wrecking" I'm trying to straight up absorb damage. I'm sure you do the damage so its a different role entirely. I want to run in while my sneak/rifle friends sit back and kill the things.
---
I really think we need a whole patch for camps where they could give us lots of quality of life changes from building (seriously if the object is green let me place it..) to function of certain objects ( perhaps add a receipt to terminals of all our venders transaction over the secession). Also they could add some new additions ( so I can build neon signs, venders, high quality leather chairs but why is the toilet and bathtub we have looked like we found them in junkyard.) Is there even a sink option? Also I would like signs to have a reduced budget.
---
It is.
---
I like the company
---
i think thats a clear indication of a game balance problem, not a need for pvp.
---
Omg that‚Äôs amazing.
---
There were actually fights. I think it's on the Overseers computer but not sure. She talks about how they would have to occassionally lock people in their rooms as punishment. 
---
Besides, that was all with a sense of law and order breathing down your neck. Once any semblance of order has been taken away, all of that forced friendship will go away fast. 
---
Remember, we are all the best and brightest. That probably means most of us would be the kind of person that accumulates 4 or 5 doctorships over their life. I know a few people like this. I wouldn't trust a single one of them to start a fire, or hunt an animal. Hell, half of them I wouldn't trust to be able to pitch a tent.
---
New weapons will be coming with the Wastelanders update. The only one I can remember is the bow and arrow
---
Hahaha, this made me chuckle!
---
I made a video of this bug, but I can't remember which hard drive I stored it on. It almost got me killed.
---
What do you men?
---
What do you enjoy about rifles? Sniping or mid range combat?
---
A power armor heavy/rifleman build is what I have been running for the past few months.  I have a bloodied, fire rate prime LMG and an instigating, +10% dmg gauss rifle.  I liked being able to snipe from a distance and then shred them when they got close, however i always felt like i was wasting valuable perk points filling out two separate trees of weapons... 
---
Then momma murmur blessed me with an instigating, explosive harpoon gun.  Now i get the best of both worlds, sniping and shredding all from heavy weapons perks.  If you like rifles for sniping then i highly recommend getting your hands on one of these.  With the flechets mod, at 20% health with nerd rage, adrenal reaction, and emergency protocols, it hits for 1700 dmg, before any adrenaline perks kick in (which would add up to 60% more).  On top of that you can get sneak attacks for x2 dmg and the instigating effect for another x2. Things start to get crazy.
---
Just to clear things up, you all are defending toxic players that are actively ruining aspects of the game for people. Apparently it's ok to ruin experiences just to sell a coat for a higher price ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yes, like all the teddy bears I was collecting...how are they not flagged anyway?
---
Any progress made towards trophies will be saved if you decide to purchase the game later. If you do anything that completes a trophy during the free trial (i.e. killing 100 scorched) you'd just have to do one more of that item to get the trophy to trigger after (In that example you'd kill one more scorched and it would pop!). Or for example, leaving the vault you'd have to make a new character and just leave the vault again.
---
The first star is worth 10% the next 2 are only 5% each. So best bang for the point is 3 level 1 cards. Adding more points does increase damage, however I find that with rifleman, most of it is just overkill. 
---
I use gutsy's as my test. If I can one shot it, I have enough points.  That is still a bit high, you could use super mutants also as a good enough range. The key here is to be just able to take out stuff with a single bullet. 
---
I could do more damage on the large creatures by adding more points to rifleman, but dps of rifles is not very good. Save rifles for those single shot kills. I'm much better off spending those points on heavys, they are much more effective against the large guys.
---
Considering Bethesda's community manager job is to lie constantly, they're actually just shitting on your work fam.
---
In Hawkes refuge, you can farm the tin can charms while getting Legendaries and earn like 72 steel per run. It is a very small cave to the east of the Purveyor‚Äôs station. It also is great for lead. I am literally sitting on 50 pounds of lead in my stash.
---
Ueah i have an ie harpoon as well with flechettes. But that doesnt really work from a distance no? Im really only keeping my rifleman perks to use my tse gauss and v25 tesla
---
Amazing!
---
Supposebly there is a new guass rifle, guass minigun and I think guass pistol and a new plasma weapon that was from the original fallout games
---
Still, a nice gesture, as I was having to fast travel everywhere to collect sweets for my AP build. I can see myself having a nice resource factory full of bot workers soon
---
I've had the aid/freeze bug happen to me twice, both times (if I remember correctly) were drinking ballistic bock.  I *think* I remember that there's an audio cue when you drink those, but I can't remember for sure.  Both times were during or just at the start of an SBQ fight.
---
If it turns out to be a bug related to the audio part, that's a great find!
---
A few others were shown and I believe datamined.
---
mi l sugi?
---
reminds me... i'm relatively new to level 50, and it over the forest. could not loot it because i could not get to the corpse. it was stuck above the trees.  at least i got the event rewards
---
Sadly it is impossible to fully idiot proof anything.  Where there is an idiot there is a way.
---
If he drops a futurama line I will drop the atoms for him

The plasma caster I think

As promised [https://i.imgur.com/WMJ2Qeh.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/WMJ2Qeh.jpg) .
---
Thank you.
---
Nuking also makes the critters higher level  - and very agitated :)
---
As others stated, whitesprings and site 9 are regularly nuked, mainly for the queen and different types of flux.
---
I wouldn't stress over it too much - 
---
  I've been playing for 11 months.  For the other areas of the map, I can count on one hand (per area) the number of times I've seen them get nuked.
---
As a low level player, you probably should not build in the center or right sides of the map (critters are always high level, making your life more difficult than it needs to be right now).
---
Yep, think of poison damage as anti-armor damage. Regular DR can mitigate it some, but like a Xenomorph with acid blood, it'll wreak havoc regardless without some kind of resistance.
---
Geneziza youre a Legend(ary).
---
Much appreciated !
---
Lee
---
Shouldn't be your, our work fix problems... Should be dev's work and people should support who test and ticket every day for free, trying to be listened and get better this game without manage blur, shadows, field of view, filters( with F I just play minecraft XD). Of course your thread help so much, especially who's not able to manage custom.ini files, but my thread is a bug report/discussion :)
---
It could be a tough sell, but if even one person takes it, it can be huge (I keep it on my shotgun support character.)
---
Do you have other bonuses to STR?  Barbarian is +4 DR per point of STR.  15 * 4 = 60, so you can have up to 5 more points of STR to get an additional 20.  Then with Evasive under AGI, with your current AGI you only get a 24 bonus.  With unyielding you could get an extra 6 (from two pieces) and that would give up to 18 extra DR.  So two pieces of unyielding (based on your current stats) would give you a +38 DR.  This is less than two bolstering pieces, but the other bonuses could offset that (since your DR is so high anyways)
---
It was just a thought, if you are taking on specific enemies (such as mirelurk) Exterminators could be better than either since it's a flat damage reduction.
---
Unfortunately not, Bethesda said you can only have one. But if you do own both then Santa can collect junk for you too
---
Ive sold 2 in my vendor. One for 5k and the other for 5.5k. I typically see them listed for about 5k when I do see them
---
3 points for 30%, 6 more points for another 30%.  Diminishing returns.

I still use all of them, but I run commando, so not going for a single shot kill most of the time (though it still does for a lot of mobs, especially with an instigating gun).  Personally I like sneak commando with concentrated fire and gun-fu using a 0 AP handmade, but for bigger fights (think SBQ, imposter sheepsquatch, or anything big and tanky) you'll really want the sustained DPS of a heavy build.
---
So your saying consoles shouldn't have access to the dev room at all and that the pc market should be the one with all the goods? That is also Entitlement. Console player's don't have it easy like you pc folk do.
---
Not sure why the downvotes for a correct, albeit sarcastic, answer.
---
all those frozen statues you see everywhere? those are players that are stuck from over-looting the SBQ.
---
Ok I guess I didn't realize my math was off with the barbarian. I assumed 15 str was the max for you. So it does seem like Unyielding works for up to 2 pieces to max those DRs thanks. I think maybe a combination then.
---
Thank you! still learning a lot here,

Craft ammo 50, kill a legendary, kill a yao guai wearing a Mr Fuzzy hat, scrap a board game, NW pick locks 4.

Level up while, 76 or higher, workshop under level 20, wearing sleepwear, full clown suit, in caves and mines, in nuked region, well tuned or well rested, using an axe, diseased, in PvP, intoxicated.
---
You‚Äôre joking right?
---
My junkies heavy gunner uses a junkies lever action and if I vats a headshot not in sneak with a crit it hits for like 450. Honestly if you get yourself a bloody lever action and no perks for rifleman you'll still have fun and do a bunch of damage. I've been leaving the group of "the higher to damage the better" crowd lately because I pvp. If you can kill something just as easily but do less damage and spend points into other things why wouldnt you. Hitting a super mutant for 3k damage is cool, but they only have like 600 health.
---
Here's a tip, dont dupe
---
he's free :)
---
1 long turd. Honestly though it's so common maybe 4k caps.
---
I've sold a few, I usually ask 4K and they don't last terribly long.
---
FWIW, the 1400/day is really what you're seeing only for newer players, or people that haven't progressed far into end game yet (which is still a lot of people, but fewer and fewer over time).  That's an OK approach to slightly spendy items like the long coat, but adjust that a *lot* when you start looking at pricier items.  If you're selling items that a level 300 might realistically want, those people can earn 10x that most days without a lot of effort.
---
Just because he has duped gear does not mean he duped himself - shoot anyone w 500+ hrs has bound to run into a duped legendary at one point unless completely avoiding player vending and other players altogether
---
I don't dupe, dumb dumb. I guarantee you have duped items too. 90% of players do.
---
Oh, read the post wrong I did not see the "the" in the post
---
Heres a tip, dont accuse people.
---
Scorched are gonna be dressed with holiday gear. The ones that are donning Christmas attire, 2ill drop special "presents" that could anything from rare gear, to a literal piece of coal
---
You can get plenty of Lead by going through Lucky Hole Mine with an Excavator power armor on.
---
You don't need that location. Let the idiots fight over it and don't be an idiot with them.
---
Finally. If you insist on remaining there. Take all the locks off all the stuff. They pick a lock which initiates pvp and lets them destroy your camp. Don't leave any ways for them to initiate pvp and they won't be able to destroy your camp.
---
I stand by my original plan.. move.. there's more lead to be had elsewhere stop letting others ruin your experience over a single vein of lead when there are other veins and other ways to get literal tons of lead for minimal effort and with zero headache.
---
I'm not trying to be an ass but sometimes you need someone to come along and remind you that YOU HAVE ALL THE POWER you can walk away and they can't stop you from walking away. You chose to stay in that situation and honestly, I don't feel bad for you. Move your camp. Pay for Fallout 1st and play on a private world. Or you know. Be an idiot playing the "I need this lead deposit herpaderp" game with the other idiots.
---
Don't be an idiot there's literally a dozen ways to get lead that don't involve getting your camp destroyed by idiots who don't realize there's a dozen ways to get lead.
---
Absolutely everyone does. Build looks good man. A damage no qol perks.
---
100% agreed
---
What weapons do you run?
---
New scrap toy item: pogo stick, gives one spring, one steel, and one rubber. Can be found by killing mirelurks.
---
Disclaimer: stealing a mirelurk's pogo stick puts you on the naughty list and santatron will only ever give you coal
---
I thought it said "I famously duped"
---
We just need a lock toggle for all types of items that make it impossible to drop, scrap, or sell while it is locked.
---
Almost every online game in existence has this basic functionality.
---
Yeah it's very unfortunate...don't know how many times I have collected all the instruments only to look later and have only 1 left, lol.  The only consolation is that they are still out there in the world and I will be able to get them again when/if QoL changes hit.
---
Exactly!
---
All good, upvotes you to counter the hate lol.
---
I ran one in game for months using terminals, hosted tournaments and everything! Lately I have been thinking about kicking that off again.
---
Thx
---
Caravan cards would be great
---
I run 3 cards each of heavy, rifle, and commando. It is so much more fun being able to pull out all the guns. There are lots of other cards with a higher return than 5% damage.
---
Well done, Sir, well done!
---
If you have the terminal in a camp, then cant you upload your own holo deck games to play?
---
In my 16 years of gaming I have never found a game with a  programed intelligence that didnt become predictable eventually. People normally arnt but in this case there the same as the ai lose get butt hurt pull out tesla melt you your camp your armor and such
---
I understand your point and I'd love to see every faction get the same treatment.
---
You can't bring up we have more than raiders though raiders literally have their own armor and power armor and clothes you can get in game for free that's a bit more than free states gets.
---
Thanks for the confirmation. I assumed they are possible to receive, but it just seemed weird that I had randomly not hit on so many available perk types (Shotgun, Heavy, 1H, 2H, Rifle, Commando, Pistol, Guerilla and all 3 separate base, exp and master tiers).
---
I wish I knew the rank 1 only ones were going to be excluded. I sure would have selected a lot more of those at low levels when nothing else good was available.
---
The town south of West-Tek is Huntersville.
---
Strongly agree, I like to pick a style for camps like 'wastelander', 'raider', 'brotherhood' etc and none of the current ones really match any of them apart from maybe the wooden ones, but even then they're not makeshift enough for my taste.
---
I agree, not sure why we need to keep reinventing the wheel..just take all the great ideas from every game we'bve ever had and keep improving.  
---
Just imagine how far we WOULDN'T be if we didn't build off of each others accomplishments/failures over all of humanities generations...

Just the junk in the mine will give you about 300 steel. Weapons should net you another 200-300, depending on what spawns.
---
I would pay it in a heartbeat of they released them
---
My problem is I almost never see the little suckers in the bog, which is where I almost exclusively stay!
---
Mains are the explosive laser rifle ( how can you beat the range) and an aa ffr fr handmade and a side of quad gamma gun. I also dabble with my aa ffr fr railway, radium, and plasma rifles just to switch it up sometimes.
---
The scorchbeast queen goes down fine with heavy gunner and my furious 50 cal mg. If people need duped weapons to play the game they need to reevaluate their skills.
---
Hardened masses from nuked enemies also scrap down into ultracite. I often find myself with extra after I make stable flux. A good nuke zone run could get you a bunch of those.
---
It does not stack (AFAIK), it's better in a team where everyone is benefiting from the 7%.  That said, 1 point in it for 5% increased damage can be good.
---
each badge has a number of sub requirements.  The exam is only part of earning the badge.

open the map, hit (on PS4) L1 to display challenges.  Scroll down to World.  from the submenu, scroll to Tadpole.  Select the badge.  Checked items are complete, unchecked are not.  
---
You can hit (triangle) to Track progress - whenever you complete an objective, you will get a popup.
---
Once you have earned the 3 badges, displayed scout values, etc, you have to return to (the scout leader in dolly sods).  He will make a speech, promote you to possum, and award the standard backpack.
---
 Then you can start on the Possum badges :)
---
I think it's worse when you waste a 1000 rounds and end up with a 1* exterminators board like I did last night.
---
I believe that the base durability is partially random and adjusted by your luck.
---
Thanks.
---
For sniping I use an Instigating Lever Action Rifle, it is superb! For semi-auto I've got a nice AAE Handmade, also superb.
---
Instigating for sure, unless ofc you're a bloodied build, then bloodied
---
two-shot not really worth it, only 25% extra damage iirc, and weapon degrades faster, plus aiming is alot harder on two-shots
---
To be honest people just hate what they lose too, so really there is no line. If you have a good PvP build, people will drew the line there.
---
I have a 2 shot handmade(3 star dont remember the others off hand) what does aae mean?
---
Agreed.  I was amazed at how much armor penetrating mods add towards a weapon.  I was playing my slugger character yesterday, and noticed my anti-armor pole hook with a puncturing mod was doing a little better than a super sledge against a couple scorchbeasts.  The super sledge does way more damage on paper, but lacks an armor piercing mod.
---
The same with a hunting rifle.  With a perforating mag and prime receiver, a bloody/aim version can kill a scorchbeast with one headshot.  The same lever gun can‚Äôt.  On paper the lever gun is better, but it has no magazine mods and armor penetration isn‚Äôt factored in.
---
Bigger bars if you have high luck for found loot, bigger bars if you have high INT for crafted loot
---
Yes when an item is created through the ring table(I.E. you kill a legendary and spawn a legendary drop) your luck has a part in the durability the weapon spawns with. Higher luck means better durability. Hope this helps!
---
it goes even faster with my strangler heart pa + b/ex gatling plasma
---
Can you also send 2 screenshots of your CAMP build area perimeter from the top of your CAMP, looking down at the "left" and "rear" of the camp (using your existing Outside screenshot as a point of reference for "left" in this case). I need to see the build area (green circle surrounding your CAMP) to see what we have to work with.
---
I do see the problem. It doesn't look like you are bound by the legacy build restrictions, so this should be solvable. I've helped friends with similar problems. They also thought they were permanently screwed, but I showed them how to methodically use the build rules to undo the damage :) hopefully we can do the same here! :) 
---
Also, which platform are you on? PC?
---
use 1 point, thats worth it imo
---
Usually best on fast weapons, so if you're 1-shotting everything, tenderizer is useless
---
AAE Plasma
---
This is similar to how loot is done in Lord of the rings online, which is a great way to handle it. I would love this.
---
Wow. That is Fn beautiful. Not to Monday Morning QB it but I don't know why you ever attempted to move it. I'd have locked that thing down forever. Damn I need to redo my camp. Anyway, back to your issue...this reminds me of back in the day when you'd write an awesome school paper and your 3.5" floppy disc would become corrupt and you lost your file. Yes, I'm old(ish). Deal with it. Anyway, it'd suck but sometimes better work comes out of having to redo it...though time consuming and still rage inducing. Get back out there and build!
---
With the right mods on a -25 VATS gun, you can build it so it's not the *best* weapon on paper, but consumes no AP to fire.
---
[Here's where I got the details](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/dt01xr/whos_running_a_non_bloodied_vats_rifle_build/f6tqlc2/)
---
I've only tested it on handmades.  I'd assume it works for fixers and pipe bolt actions and pipe revolvers, but I'm not sure what mods are available on those.  Might work on some other guns, but I haven't checked to see - [here's a post talking about the subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dccclo/video_you_can_reduce_vats_ap_costs_to_zero_on/).
---
For legacy, VE Gatling Plasma.  For conventional ballistic weapons, I‚Äôd pick an LMG.  It makes the ammo much more efficient to make, and it‚Äôs one of the highest damage weapons in the game.
---
Sounds similar to the "resource here" dots in the hud from previous iterations of fallout. 
---
I like it.  Doesn't need to be that complex as you outlined, just the this direction dot would be sufficient AFA I'm  concerned.
---
Two shot is a mediocre prefix at best.  Instigating is a top-3 prefix.  It‚Äôs a pretty obvious choice.
---
Just curious what your carry weight is , I VE Ben trying to make a pvp build myself but run 5 in Str (3blocker 1 ammo redux 1 chems redux ) and still find myself having to drop/sell items so I can use my sprint
---
I think the annual pass is 40% less than the monthly. So you guys aren't really saving much. You're each saving 50% (if you each buy 6 months)
---
I don't want to put you out, but would you have a moment to elaborate on the steps to take? With wallpaper I have this issue where one of my interior walls has an exterior look and it bothers me to look at now. Are you saying I should put walls back to back at a floor "seam" so the exterior appearances are against each other and the interior is...well, interior to each side of the wall? Then, I put a door on one but not the other and just have a larger threshold between rooms?
---
What would help I a better notification option.  Most events I only notice by looking for them. The notice either never popped up or did so quickly I didn't notice.  I get many Don't want to be disturbed. It could be a setting. I can't believe I am the only one who gets there late because they didn't see the start and there is no sound effect when it launches.  Maybe a sound effect when the event is 80% done would help?
---
I have it equipped.  
---
Normally run solo, and only have 3 points in Charisma.  Lone Wanderer2 and Tenderizer1.  Don't know how much it helps, but I try to dish out all the damage I can :)
---
I have been running a furious explosive for a while. I have been wanting to try a TSE handmade to compare, but not worth the price. I like furious over instigating just because you can take down higher level enemies with less shots. I'm all about saving ammo.
---
5-7K on the PC.

this is a great bunch of words. TLDR

I was using an example that normal people can understand, without using a block of technojargon, that most gamers wont understand.

Tailor your message to the audience. about 1% of 1% of users here will understand this.

When communicating on the internet, its best to tailor your examples around something everyone can relate to, or understand.

Going back a little earlier, you are reffering to I assume Marathon, which noone remembers.   Everyone remembers the Diablo craze of 1996.

You need some pepper to go with that salt? üòÇ
---
I‚Äôve got two bloodied auto primed handmades and one Vampire auto FFR combat rifle that‚Äôs primed and they make a difference.

For heavy weapons, perhaps the 50 cal or LMG?  Gatling Plasma (primed) cores are easy to make as well.

I love it as well

Nah, they still keep ignoring them. But hey, at least some bugs finally got acknowledged and we were told that some of the more annoying ones will be fixed with Wastelanders.

I saw a level 900 player just this week
---
Thanks!  I played LOTRO for a few years along with quite a few other MMOs.  I've never really liked the 'have to click on it' loot system.
---
No problem Steamy
---
I play a lot too and currently at 276.  Seems like once I hit 250 the level ups slow down significantly
---
Instigating not good for SBQ except for shot number one MAYBE.
---
I sure as hell hope so, lol
---
I use the Pharma Farma perk and runs through Morgantown Airport and Flatwoods to stock up on Stimpaks when running low.  
---
I wonder if anyone uses the more ammo card and   spots on the map with a lot of ammo boxes to do the same thing.  If nothing else, it might reduce the grind.  
---
However, if you are a sniper or a shotgun build then there is plenty of ammo.   It's only when you use automatic weapons all of the time that you need to grind for ammo. 
---
The biggest bullet sinks are the Queen and the Cryptid events.
---
I use a 1 tend and 1 suppressor in most my builds, it helps when you are in a pinch and if you have 3 cha you can share one while running group activities
---
Its not horrible, what do i know tho' 
---
Anyone want to pvp, ps4
---
I run Medic explosive faster cats fill Pump and it‚Äôs awesome. With Enforcer you cripple all mobs which also helps your team from getting swarmed.
---
Lmaoooooooo
---
As a side note, dunno how's ps4 in that regard, but on PC people start up stealthboys the moment when opponent uses vats/crit. I know I do...
---
And then the other day I saw a camp with the large water purifiers that are meant to be placed in water - on dry land. Fantastic.
---
Make a ticket and explain the situation. But it's still beneficial to have the Collectron. Santatron only has full junk gathering options if you have Collectron unlocked

What do you mean come back?

Is one of them the griefer with Boston accent..?

Yeah, I primed my FE, burned through all of my ammo, and changed my mind. haha

Thank you all for replying. I did join the event, I didn't know that you had to had a damage limit on the Queen.

I'll use my higher level melee when doing the event to see if it works.

Fuck mean to say explosive energy weapons XD
---
I use a Prime Zealots 50 Cal and I love it.

They're still in the drop pool.

All good! I thought they took out all explosive weapons from dropping üòÇüòÇ

There's an entire mode for that.

These ate life choices, okay? I could quite hoarding 25 desk fans and other assorted junk anytime I want to

Let me know when you can post those additional screenshots. I have an idea of an easy way to get rid of that floating floor board, but we may need to go another route if your build area won't allow for it.
---
Lol agreed, would be cool

personally, i login to servers by joining friends.  whoever logs in first has their base built.

My camp is pretty close to the top of the world - it would be so funny if my companion would complain about how loud Rose is to me.

Nothing of substance.  Wait for Wastelanders

I wish they would do the same kind of thing they do with the brahmin where you put down the hay and you have the brahmin but instead the dog house /  cat bowl to have dogmeat or a cat.
---
It sucks, but legacy explosive weapons are worse. Apparently the explosion is energy damage, so it ignores Fireproof and Dense. It can also bug you out and make you invincible to all damage.
---
*You're* incredible!
---
Mister Fuzzy is your friend, Mister Fuzzy loves to play!
---
Mister Fuzzy never ends, Mister Fuzzy's in your head!
---
Hard to beat gatling guns both energy and ballistic. If carry weight is an issue I'd go with the 5mm as fusion/plasma cores get heavy even with weight reduction. If you are running rifle 556 and 308 both craft considerably higher numbers for ultracite if you use ammosmith and super duper.
---
Bro, I'm one of the top 10 players on Xbox lol. If I thought the OP was trash, I would be right there agreeing with you. He's not wrong though. I've experienced this twice myself, as have most of the other top players on the Xbox platform. Despite the Gauss Rifle being pretty damn ideal, we use it as a weapon of last resort specifically because a weapon that frequently fails to output damage is useless.
---
&gt;I ran an instigating hunting rifle for dozens of levels (1*), and it was more than enough to 1 shot most regular mobs with a head shot.
---
Same, I still have mine and if you want it u/the_stealth_boy and are on PS4 let me know. I have a 3* LA and a 3* Gauss that I primary now and the idea that a 1* isn't great will explode like a super mutant's head if they use a 1* instigating rifle
---
This is as good as the Deathclaw Maze camp
---
Its the one time I can say having a junk limit ingame is a good thing. :)
---
Sarcastic answers are literally my favorite answers.
---
Energy weapons are viable. The DPS on my Junkie's plasma flamer is insane. The legacies were a stupid idea in the first place and the duping of them ruined the game economy so they should be removed entirely or made obsolete by the addition of higher-tier weapons.
---
Duped explosive legacy and assassins/sentinel, that is pretty cookie cutter PVP there. Any honest PVPer will have an uphill battle against you. You can probably dump fireproof as all the other PVPers with your exact same items will be ignoring explosive resist anyways (apparently legacy explosions are energy damage). They really need to either remove all legacies or fix the explosive effect. It may actually be fair if fireproof and dense chest mods worked.
---
Or one, at least.  It can't co-exist with the Collectron.  But if you own the Collectron, you can set up the Santatron to do the Collectron's routines.
---
Sadly I'm on xbox or else I'd take you up in a heartbeat üò•
---
Gauss iant legacy
---
Not sure but if you ever need a instigating explosive weapon i have a lever action rifle
---
Agreed. I usually give people a warning that they are in Godmode, which is not their fault (usually). However, I also tell them that they need to restart to go back to normal and that knowingly continuing to PvP is a bannable exploit. Despite not intentionally being in Godmode, wilfully using it to your advantage changes it from an accident to an exploit as defined by the Terms of Service. Most people continue to stay in Godmode and grief others, so I fight them long enough to get the video clips I need to get them banned. I'm all for fair PvP, but players who can't win without an exploit need to find another game.
---
The logic behind removing them was they ruined the mechanics and concept of the weapons. Lasers and plasma balls don't explode, streams of fire don't turn into little explosive balls, a stream of cryogenic fluid can't have an explosive effect. If you've ever used any of these with an explosive effect, then you understand what I mean. I totally support the decision, and I hope it stays that way. Making them explosive again won't magically make them viable, it ruins the concept of the weapon. They need to have their own set of perks, that would be the best way to add a little balance to the equation.
---
I would recommend that you Prime whatever Heavy weapon you want to fight the queen with. 
---
Prime heavy weapons are too expensive to feed for normal day to day all around use.
---
It happens all the time when I first load in lol.
---
It doesnt matter what you use, it just ends when Godmode gets activated on someone for me.
---
If you use vats two shot isn't particularly good as accuracy becomes a problem. It us more accurate if you aim down the sights. Instigating is great for one shot kills on most mobs. You can get some high numbers with sneak perks. I'd look for a second rifle for tanky targets that require multiple shots as instigating loses it punch after any damage has been done.
---
Same as you, Xbox is usually fine for me but I get the occasional bug.
---
No, it doesnt affect lead and gunpowder. 
---
Chemist gives you more of certain things made at the Chemist bench, but not everything.   I always enable it while crafting ammo because I usually craft diluted stimpaks and radaway at the same time, which are affected by it.
---
Great, I will be on in about 3 hours.
---
Guass is a legacy.
---
I sort of agree but to be honest most of the time I get into pvp it's a group of 2-4 people trying to kill me at once. The tela and stealth bus come in handy to even the odd. Also the hard counter to a stealth boy is a Tesla so it's good to keep one around for that anyways. Tesla involves getting pretty close for it to work as well. Depending on what other people use it could be hard to close that distance to get within range. I use an auto B25 handmade for range and an auto B25 Tesla for close range.
---
I dont tell anyone how to life their life as long as i get to keep my heads in a jar.
---
In particular, imo, they need a silencer-type mod.  The game considers them quite noisy.  Laser pistols are one of those things I can't even make do with, despite having a build that should use them well.
---
Depends but yeah it happens quite often
---
Unless you pay real money for unlimited junk storage.
---
Amazing!!! Love it!
---
Ahh okay I didn‚Äôt know that, thanks for the heads ups!
---
I only need it for a month. I don't intend to keep using it. Just wanna overload my stash so I won't need junk for months to come.
---
Now with the mating? \*Fry gestures wildly\* Third date!!
---
I feel you...   I have a two-shot, faster fire rate, 25% less VATS....
---
I think that would be nice as well. I know you can display hats / masks in the current display cases but I would like the addition of mannequins alot. 1. Because they're creepy. 2. So I can add my creepy outfits to them and make them worse.
---
If you can..get a legacy laser and mod it with the beam dplitter and auto barrel
---
I won't need to pick up junk for quite a while when this month runs out. In just a week I've collected 20k steel, close to 10k lead and acid. That was just the first week.
---
I can see your argument to this and I agree with it somewhat. However I hate to be that person but fallout is just a game. Yes I hate to be that guy, but there‚Äôs a lot of things in fallout that don‚Äôt make sense. For example fusion powered cars. Things along that nature. Sure streams of plasma and lasers wouldn‚Äôt make sense to just explode, but at the same time does it really break the immersion? I also do agree that we really do need perks towards energy weapons that make them useable. Or a whole new Major or minor prefix for them. I might have been wrong when I said they aren‚Äôt viable however most could agree the explosive minor prefix on it makes it extremely useful.
---
[deleted]
---
Good idea....is there any perks to boost energy weapons or do they just fall under heavy, rifle or pistol?
---
At a certain point, these posts have to be considered troll posts.
---
I just acquired both western outfits and have all the jumpsuits. And I'm now thinking about how creepy an Asylum dress mannequin room would be.
---
Mama mumbles gave me a bloodied .50 cal and I adore it. I tried it out at Heart of the Swamp, and on a separate 3* mirelurk Queen and it just kicked so much ass. It‚Äôs great for the SBQ also, even without being primed.
---
Fair enough. I was under the impression they'd be paying a set rate for a set amount of servers, and they wouldn't go over that. If that's not the case well that's good to know, and I'd be more informed. (don't mind being wrong lol)
---
I am not 100% sure, but I think ore veins are instanced to the player (or at least I hope they are, and I do not recall running into issues with them being already mined by other players), but they reset only once per day, similarly to the vendors and scrip machines. Not that the ~1500 lead you can potentially get from Lucky Hole Mine should not normally last for that time.
---
Or just a "loot all" that allows you to loot all your corpses within a certain range. Then you can discard what you don't want.
---
Seems like you think it could be better. How so?
---
Assuming you have a few extra caps lying around, if you spend some quality time shopping, you should be able to find a vendor selling one that won't break the bank.  Anything without any of the 'meta' legendaries (explosive, bloodied, junkies, FFR, etc.) are usually found pretty cheap.  
---
Hunting rifle, lever action, or the fixer with instigating (anything else is bonus) will work well, though the fixer is probably pricier than the others.  Hell, even if you can find an instigating regular combat rifle for cheap, grab it and see how it works after you mod it up.
---
Hunting rifle is great as you can mod it to .50 cal (and .50 cal is easy to make).  The fixer adds to stealth, but that's not a huge deal with the right perks anyway.
---
On Xbox I see in in vendors for 5k most of the time.
---
Haha no stop
---
Meanwhile Bethesda releases brand-spanking-new looking wallpapers that somehow are supposed to fit into a post-apocalyptic world. I want weathered, horrid looking "children of atom" level props and wallpapers fried by radiation and aged by the devastation. We should work hard to make our camps look clean, not the other way around.
---
I want to die this way!  Not on PC though right?
---
They arent
---
As a rifleman build myself, my prefixes of choice in order of usefullness are as follows.  I use lever action rifles, the preferred weapon of rifleman snipers.
---
Keep in mind this is my personal opinion, and not necessarily game law, as your builds might favor another setup.  I run bloodied.
---
Bloodied - AA - Instigating - Executioners - Vampires - Mutants - Slayers (all types) - Two Shot - Furious - Nocturnal - Stalkers - Berzerkers 
---
A breif explaination on why I chose this order. 
---
\*Bloodied is first, because I am bloodied, and if you are bloodied the highest damage output is with a bloodied weapon.  This is my primary
---
\*AA is next instead of instigating, because instigating only affects the first shot.  AA is more dependable for longer fights or spongey enemies.   
---
\*Instigating is next because it one shot drops alot of things.  If you are not bloodied you may need a second shot
---
\*Executioners is next because it does a crap ton of damage to damaged enemies.  I use this as a backup to my Bloodied
---
\*Vampires helps you survive.  This is a better effect on auto rifles, but still useful on single shots.
---
\*Mutants has a base 10% increase flat.  no special circumstances
---
\*Slayers are behind mutants because they are situational.  Great damage against preferreed enemies, but base against everything else.
---
\*Two shot has a negative modifier to accuracy, and I have noticed that when something is at range, the second shot tends to miss, which gimps the damage.  
---
\*Furious is so far down the list because rifleman dont fire full auto, so the effects of the prefix are lost for a hard single hitting rifleman build, as to become viable, furious needs to land more than a few hits on something.  With a rifleman build you should be 1-3 shotting almost everything.
---
\*Nocturnal, stalkers and berzerkers take up the rear, because lets be honest, they are pretty useless.
---
I did not mention Medics because very few people use medic builds, and this is a build specific prefix,  Useless if you are not a medic build.
---
There's probably more explosive plasmas and lasers than any other weapon as they were heavily duped, so Bethesda taking them out the game actually added more in.
---
I say bring them back so there's a level playing field for everyone, or remove them totally, maybe make them 250lbs like the paintball gun.
---
Anything that takes more than about 3 shots, instigating isn't ideal on.  Hence the 'regular mobs' comment.
---
Even when I was pure sniper, I carried a .50 cal or a minigun to the queen fights and never even fired the hunting rifle at her.
---
It's also *BARELY* enough time for a bloodied build to navigate the pip boy and put power armor on. Though I run a lead-lined backpack and lead lined to nuke zones
---
Okay why aren‚Äôt they? When is the last time youve had a friend pick up and explosive Guass or when is the last time you‚Äôve got one from a legendary enemy?
---
This was asked after launch and it was pointed out that these animations don't work out well in a multiplayer game, since it ties up the creature in an animation making them easy prey for other players while they are busy animating.
---
You could add a 4th choice - Loot All.  Not a bad idea.  
---
There would be instances where that would be very handy, but with large numbers of corpses and inventory being painful at times to sort through, I'd like to have options.
---
From what I've seen, I'd say XBox and older PS consoles have more issues on average.  PCs are very touchy, but most people on PC don't have a lot of issues.  But if you have a bad combination of hardware and drivers, and especially on older, lower and systems, PCs can absolutely be a nightmare.
---
I run what I'd call a mid-level gaming PC from about 3 years ago (not upgraded since it was new), and I have run into very very few problems in about 1200 hours of gameplay.  And the majority of those were game problems (like the power armor exiting bug), and not problems with the PC itself.
---
Thanks! I appreciate you! I will give this a go!
---
Yes. It creates an artificial player gap and a lot of newcomers want them.
---
So do small arms ammunition really explode since we are talking about mechanics and concepts.
---
On xbox I personally feel as though the Hitboxes are fine (except melee jesus christ that does suck for pvp). VATs for sure just need to be disabled and honestly. NW has PvP stealthboy effects right if you fire your gun you should lose stealth.
---
I've used them all and prefer furious.
---
A very silent hill-esque camp would be interesting - Asylum outfits with the surgical masks? Oh yes~ 
---
And I have teh western outfits for when I'm feelin rootin tootin - I don't really care for the jumpsuits tho and I am not a super completionist - I just kind of collect the ones I like. The Whitesprings jumpsuit is too similar to the mechanic one for me to care about trying to obtain it. I do want the travelling leather coat - I have the regular leather coat so the travelling one would be nice to have too.
---
Couldn't agree more. The scrapbox is a total game changer, it should be available to all players regardless of their monetary investment in the game. At least some version of it anyway, if they wanted to give out a scrapbox with a sizable but still capped capacity to non-subscribers, I think that would be a fair compromise. Maybe like 2 tons of total weight, or a maximum number of each item in the list (2,500? 5,000?)
---
Super dope!!
---
Very well done
---
We don't need more OP weapons, we need the ones we have balanced.  Reintroducing those would throw things further off kilter than they are now.
---
IMO they should strip the existing ones of their explosive effects.  If for no other reason than to prevent them from being duped into oblivion.  But I removing them would be a pretty bitter pill to swallow, so I don't know that that's the best move from a PR perspective.
---
Already tried even went the extra mile and got them in sentinal assassin
---
Actually dosent register as either damage type as a damage value there isn't files in the game anymore for calculating there value
---
Ohh that's cool a Bethesda employee and an awesome camp
---
A junkies explosive railway rifle is killer.
---
Excellent idea. I would settle for this if I couldn't have a dynamic dogmeat that followed me on my travels.
---
Same here, this would be a huge improvement
---
Can I add you? I want to see this
---
The power armor arm mods are intended to be just that.
---
This should legitimately be a thing.
---
3 poses! Standing, sitting/crouching, and T-pose Silent Hill Asylum Mire camp.
---
Whatever this is, it can't kill me. I've got fast reflexes and always take precautions when visiting camps.
---
Ive never had issue with close range or short range and have never seen the need for a tesla I'm not sure how long youve used them but there damage output has been wonky since survival was introduced before hand they wernt viable. Also on a side note apparently when the bolt bounces it ignore s defensive values to
---
So even energy resist doesn‚Äôt help?
---
The holotapes from the FO:76 version of the PipBoy are larger than those used in FO:3 or FO:4. I bought the Wand Co. model but haven't assembled it yet &lt;sigh&gt; however the holotape is 76mm long by 47mm wide and 10mm deep...
---
Unless people are playing on all three platforms regularly, using the same build of FO76 - you can't expect an accurate comparison.  This is largely an opinion poll.
---
Also "Stuck Scorch screaming" pose
---
Xbox. Not really buggy.
---
You really need to put points in Perception, especially if you're relying on VATS. Concentrated Fire 2-3 gives you the increasing accuracy with each bullet and allows you to consistently get headshots to take down enemies fast, Tank Killer 3 effectively adds about 25% damage, and having just 1 of each of the Commando perks (10% each) is enough until you've got your sneak and mutations (adrenal reaction, marsupial, speed demon) sorted out.
---
Ive got like 30 ultracite fusion cores.. Rly easy to get them, ammosmith + super duper, turns 2 normal cores into 3 ultracite and like 33% chance to get 6 instead.
---
The game is pretty stable atm but my problem is that when they finally get it running well, I feel content drought. Then, they release new content and stability drops.
---
I do hope they will bring Dogmeat in with the Wastelanders update but if not I'm ok with camp Dogmeat instead.
---
Power armor could be so much cooler
---
Well since BSW sees a spike in people buying "atoms" whenever they bring anything back I can't imagine anything being gone forever! ;-)
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
There are explosive ballistic rounds IRL...
---
I think 2 or 3 free atomic shop mannequins with poses and then having other poses cost Atoms would be fair. Like 1-300a per pose.
---
Laser rifles can be either rifleman or commando depending on if its auto or not or gunslinger if they are modded for pistol grips
---
Wouldnt mind a two shot explosive pistol with + 30 damage to ghouls. Fuck those things.
---
Its for wastelanders.  The code is currently 0000
---
Something akin to the GAU-19 would be a fantastic PA only ballistic weapon. 50BMG minigun typically used as vehicle mounted weapon.
---
No. I don‚Äôt want anyone else to have my medics explosive ultracite pistol. :). I don‚Äôt even use it.
---
There are perks which assist with staggering in PA, and perks to assist firing a Heavy Weapon while in PA .  I have a Heavy gunner character built for T51b PA, and a heavy gunner character built for Vanguard Sentinel armor.  I need to do some vault raids to allow the T51b PA heavy gunner more variety.
---
Agreed on their removal, but energy weapons need another effect to balance them with weapons them with explosive weapons
---
I do hope they buff PA a bit, I dont really care how, just some way. PA was the turning point for conflict with Chinese, the pinacle of defensive tech but a set of my legendary patch-work metal armor is just as good if not better? I'd love more reason to use PA
---
Doesnt ring a bell, curous. Have an upvote.
---
Thanks that worked and now I‚Äôm in an elavater going to vault 79
---
I think they have back when clown was still on PS4. Was watching some rage videos from a while ago and I saw clowns PS4 name pop up. Very uneventful, I don't think either one new who the other was.
---
Oh definitely this. I would be okay if they did like basic mannequin pose for free - like the standard ones we have in world right now. 
---
Or they could tie in our photomode poses for the mannequins even? Because we already have the poses really - so if we could use them fro the mannequins that would be fun.
---
Are you able to start your own private server?
---
That's exactly why I don't use my laser rifles. I've got some great ones that gather dust in my stash cause every time they fire they alert an entire county. Hope they add someway to silence those in the future, at least the laser rifles
---
Basically when you get to late game armour rating is pointless and what actually matters is the legendary effects and what weapons you get them on as 76 endgame is all just legendary farming and killing the queen
---
Yes I was able to. I haven't been charged either so I'm not sure what's going on.
---
It was up for like a month or two.
---
It honestly kills me so quick not even dodgy and quatnums help
---
I believe the only that is lost if you do not renew membership is the ability to start a private server, claim new 1st skins/outfits, and be able to deposit into the scrapbox. You keep any skins/outfits/icons that have already been unlocked.
---
That‚Äôs why you use a napkin. .. We‚Äôre talking about eating them, yes?
---
I thought it would be nice to be able to attach a weapon like the mole-miner claws to PA. If the raiders can add all the extra cagey stuff to their armor- why not more weapons.
---
I‚Äôm also on xbox and I have the same thing happening to me. I haven‚Äôt been charged to renew the subscription and I also haven‚Äôt received monthly atomic points. I know the outfits and emotes stay but that was supposed to be it, it‚Äôs probably another issue they need to fix.
---
Did you actually unsubscribe? If you didn't they will keep charging you per month, might want to look into that.
---
I thought the PowerFist, by definition, was usable in Power Armor.
---
Nope.
---
Correct - but I was able to claim the new out / continue using my scrap box (adding as well as taking out) and open my own private server still. And I haven't been charged again as I only purchased the 1month sub option that did not have a recurring payment.
---
I just removed tenderizer one as it does absolutely nothing. Tested it and damage numbers are always the same.
---
Lever-Action.
---
PS4 :(
---
I mean sure we recognize the turret in the foreground but they didnt have any questions about some of the objects in the picture?
---
I have to say it's pretty funny to watch you act so sure of yourself when you are 100% wrong. Even when people tell you that they have eyes on personal proof, you tell them they are the ones that are wrong. 
---
Hilarious!
---
Just write something in the request please :)
---
I only bought 1 month - on Xbox you can buy 1 month only option or the 12 month thing. I haven't been charged for a second month.
---
How would that work if half the body of water isn't in the nuke zone? Or would it just eliminate all the water outside the zone too?
---
Most likely, maybe they didn't actually straighten out how to restrict certain things - since you're supposed to still be able to have these things placed but not be able to really use them?
---
To further back up my argument in the files of FO76 the guass rifle is even coded as an ‚Äúenergy weapon‚Äù!
---
Well lucky you I guess
---
Well that‚Äôs definitely a unique gun XD. Seems more of a collectors weapon if anything :D
---
I‚Äôll try to help. The game WILL start out slow. You won‚Äôt be able to sprint more than 10 meters without getting tired and your weapons will be terrible. This is why you need to research how builds work, like weapon or armor builds, and start accumulating those cards when you level up. Also try to get the stamina perks when you unlock them... trust me. Just stick with the game long enough and the game will be so fun to explore and find new enemies
---
I mean, Rust can handle 250 concurrent players, bases and electrical systems.  Conan Exiles up until this past week can have unlimited NPC thralls, now 50 per player. 
---
We‚Äôd only hope that a AAA studio could find a way to do what two independent small studios have done. Given they‚Äôre all different engines, but making occupied towns was my favourite part of FO4.
---
But why?  Why would you do that?
---
Drill Arms?
---
Commando
---
Still can. Rust official servers typically are 250 concurrent.
---
Really. Are you talking about a true exploding bullet or a projectile designed to fragment on impact.
---
There's no open world PvP anymore though, most of the options mentioned are matched based.
---
Outside of legacy weapons a Fixer or Handmade.
---
I don't know if I agree with that logic for cap cost based on level/timed played/rich players. A billionaire doesn't order a Big Mac and pay 3x what common folk do just cause he's worth more. I'm not going to charge a level 300 3x more than I'd charge a level 30, just cause the 300 probably has more. We need a steady, stable currency and value to keep the market consistent and fair. Caps have been extremely de-valued for a number of reasons, and I think this is one that adds to it, market inconsistency.
---
haha yeah thats sandman
---
Just dive in
---
Meh. I just wish I could get the caps back when I claim a workshop and that "Controls temporarily disabled" pops up before the game crashes...
---
Can't fault a technically true answer, that is the *true* value. It's just became hyper-inflated due to demand or other factors.
---
Personally, I think it's more efficient farm for legendaries and use the purveyor where I know I will get a 3* weapon or armor.
---
i love helping low lvl players out with gear and gameplay mechanics.
---
grinding low lvl rewards with them like hoarde events or the wolfthingy that name i just forgot, camp plans n stuff like that
---
but there is a difference between a low lvl player and a second char player.
---
i usually can figure out after 10 minutes of watching them play or so if they re green or just 2nd char (i see loads of lvl 15-25 w double barrel explo sg for some reason thats a dead giveaway)
---
i guess the demanding one was 2nd or 3rd etc char of soneone. :)
---
They need a nerf, and then it's fine to let them back in.
---
Yeah I agree. I just think it'd add reason to go to vendors and give people another way to get legendaries
---
I just want legendary power armor pieces.
---
What about 2 short turds? What is the turd conversion? Is it based on length, girth or weight? Is it like a diamond scale, does cut, color and quality matter? These are absolutely questions I need answered.
---
Happened to me lots of times, but if you wait (about 4-5 minutes) the game allows you to respawn and get your reward too. Afterwards you should be able to go back and loot the SBQ (if you got past the damage cap), or fast travel to Watoga Station and have her body spawn next to you.
---
Why would they need a nerf? imo Explosive energy weapons are far from overpowered. Sure an explosive Gat plasma with the splitter mod can do a lot of damage over a wide area but definitely is not overpowered.
---
Jackhammer arms. Give your enemies a good pounding.
---
I got mine for 20k, and that was pretty cheap. Although I‚Äôm on Xbox.
---
Is high level players start following you around doing the gift emote then they're probably trying to give you something. This shouldn't have to be said but I can't tell you how many people run away from me when I'm just trying to give them a starter pack of stims/weapons/outfits etc 
---
Tips tho - try to stay in the forest and the toxic valley while you are low level because higher level players will spawn higher level enemies. So you'll be level 6 and a level 50+ enemy could spawn just because a higher level player is there. So just be mindful of where you're wandering to on the map. 
---
When you pick perks that say they give you a chance at additional items from containers (such as Can Do) - you must hit the "search" option for this to happen - it doesn't do it automatically. 
---
Don't worry about setting up your camp right at the start- the game will prompt you to but you can really just put down a shit shack with the basics. Just don't dump your resources into it early on because you're guaranteed to move.
---
People dont give the 10mm SMG enough love. Thing can tear with the right Legendary Combos. My Anti-Armor 10mm SMG does more damage to the SB than my AAE Fixer in most situations.
---
I know thnx! But u know I've probably been doing those 6 months and still don't get why it says 2/2 but seems only uses 1?? Even goes down to 1/2...
---
You can't pick your customers, so you don't price *everything* like they're all rich.  You're right, a big mac is priced the way it is to sell units.  But you don't think about pricing a yacht based on how many hours at minimum wage it would take to pay for it.
---
If you have a bloodied FFR handmade, you don't calculate how many days it would take at 1400 caps to afford it  You say 'fuck it, anyone looking for one of these has tons of cash, so it's going up for max caps'.
---
You're not wrong, at all, I'm just talking about looking at a different market in a different way.
---
One other possibility is that Wastelanders will drop much sooner than the general consensus and they want to preemptively make it clear.
---
'Going' might be an optimistic word there.  You're in it, but you're not going anywhere (not yet anyway).
---
It's the best feeling when you can watch your art grow as you learn new things. Nice job!
---
That's just how BGS rolls...half-ass everything.
---
Use nukesdragons.com to plan and optimize your build from the start. Think about what kind of build you want (bloodied unyielding, etc.)
---
Scrap junk before storing it in your stash.
---
Turn pacifist on at level 5 and don't retaliate if someone attacks you, or else you will engage PVP. Don't take workshops unless you want PVP.
---
Build and scrap boards early on to learn mods for it. Same with any weapon/armor really.
---
Don't rush the story. If you want max level quest rewards, you'll have to be level 50 or higher. Given that heavy Raider plans can only drop from Signal Strength quest that can only be done once per character, complete it at level 25.
---
Build a camp and plant crops and set up purifiers for food as soon as you can.
---
I‚Äôve never tried any of these are they actually effective?
---
They definitely are. I use an original Xbox One, not S and not X. I crash at *least* once every 2-3 hours of consistent game play. Lots of different triggers can cause a crash, but I've found time to be the biggest culprit (maybe a memory issue for Xbox?). Queen fights have been a big cause. The halloween Mischief event? I literally could not complete it a single time without at least one crash. I would get lucky sometimes and be able to re-join before it ended but yeah, crash reports are definitely not exaggerated. I have tons of videos I've taken on my Xbox of different crashes/causes.
---
Love it! &lt;3
---
North of 10,000 caps, easily.
---
Or you pay to travel and in that time the event has ended! So annoying!
---
I think that'd be really cool. It makes no sense that they don't, honestly.
---
Play melee, It's the games easy mode
---
What do you women?
---
But only once you reach 30, right?
---
Some solid points you raise there. Moving isnt a bad plan im just being lazy as I dont do the whole camp building thing. I also forgot about lock picking initiating PVP so thank for the heads up.
---
I also have it on Xbox and the only two options I had was 1 month recurring or 1 year. I'd honestly double check bud. There was no 1 month only option. Also my 2nd month payment came out my account nearly 5 weeks after I initially signed up.
---
But it's perfectly logical to shoot something in the face with a .50 caliber bullet and have them walk off like it's nothing? I don't think they where thinking logic, they where thinking OP. And because they removed these "legacy weapons" the game has turned pay to win, and not because of the ATOM shop, but because of Ebay. Spend 10-50$ and get a super good, broken weapon that is no longer obtainable. Also makes caps have no value, as people only want to trade good weapons / armor for legacy now a days.
---
LMGs are very efficient if you can keep a supply of Fluorescent flux
---
Bravo! üëè
---
Agreed. Increasing the cap pool exponentially(multiple characters/accounts) has also contributed to this. The cap is next to worthless now. And one character players are either forced to add more characters or have to get lucky with legendary drops/high value items.
---
Shhh. Do you want to get sued? 
---
Do you want to get sued by Games Workshop? Because that‚Äôs how you get sued by Games Workshop.
---
Don‚Äôt stress too much over ‚Äòdoing the game right‚Äô at the start. 
---
I agree about high level players gifting you items. It happens a lot and sometimes new players run off instead of picking up the dozen stimpacks I dropped them. This game has a very chill, supportive community (generally), so don‚Äôt be afraid to interact with others. (When I started, I thought it would be like a Battle Royale free-for-all, But was pleasantly surprised).
---
At the start, focus on some good melee weapons- way better than always running out of ammo. And make sure to keep food and water on hand- you‚Äôll need it. To heal, the cheapest way at the beginning it to sleep in a bed- no stimpacks required (save those for mid-fight heals)
---
Do a few of the first few missions in town, then go wandering off and find cool spots around the map. Exploration is lots of fun- there‚Äôs loads of stuff scattered around to find, including side missions accessible from just finding some interesting spot. 
---
Most of the rest you‚Äôll figure out as you get going. Enjoy :)
---
But if I started playing again it would be easy so I might one day
---
‚ÄúOh no Todd, people aren‚Äôt being nice in the post apocalyptic multiplayer game?‚Äù ‚ÄúI thought the community was supposed to be nice!‚Äù
---
I've got an instigating HR primed and with all the rifleman perks, bloody mess, covert ops, and glow sight I can do around 2500 on an opener without a headshot. For most enemies that's good enough for a one shot. Mirelurk Kings are obnoxiously tanky so I switch to my EE Handmade for them
---
Absolutely not.  I pay more so I should get more.
---
Using multipme weapon types same time.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for it at all
---
there are 2 different arm mods for different playstyles 
---
Optimized bracers, which give faster AP regen (allowing for more frequent power attacks)
---
and
---
hydraulic bracers, provide for higher unarmed damage when using things like the powerfist.
---
I have one of each type on my PA sets.
---
I think one of the arm mods also gives a Str boost.
---
Also, if you do the motion assist servos mod on the chest, you get a +2 Str bump, which helps melee damage, carry weight, and wielding heavy weapons.
---
Serums sell for only around 300 caps from player vendors. If you are taking about the serum recipes, I get caps by selling legendaries I farm or get from purveyor.
---
I‚Äôd say you‚Äôd be missing out haha ;) I always have a lot of stash boxes around
---
Hmm I suppose you have trouble reading. As I said, this is not a complaint against the troller, it is a suggestion for a fix
---
This is good advice. Armor penetration from tank killer scales better than raw damage.
---
They ruined a camp space to make it.
---
That‚Äôs why I went there I wanted to build a cave base :(
---
What exactly did you suggest?
---
This just kills me man ! ! ! ! 
---
Awesome build Kaz.
---
That doesnt sound like a problem at all. That's just part of the game
---
Not entirely sure I get what you're asking.
---
I typically run around 35 percent with bloodied gear. Main is shotgun or heavy depending on how I'm feeling today and side weapon is commando, all bloodied gear. Run adrenal reaction with unyeilding armor. That is my sweet spot where I feel I get good enough damage with just enough health reserve to be able to take damage and be able to survive.
---
I do have all the perks needed though and occasionally will switch to a full on bloodied build with all the relevant perks and play that way for a day or two.  Full on bloodied is great but I really prefer playing in that "sweet spot". It's nice doing the crazy damage but I like not worrying about death quite a bit.
---
Even without nerd rage, at that 35-40 percent range most things are dead in 1-5 shots depending on what weapon I have out
---
I run a hybrid Rifleman/Commando and Heavy buiild.

When I run heavies I drop gunsmith for Stabalized 3 and First Aid 2 in Int.  And in Agi I drop all of it for Dodgy 3, Action Boy 3, Thru Hiker 3 (because PA gimps my unyeilding str)
---
Im still coming to the conslusion of which luck perks work best, so my luck perks are still a work in progress.
---
I have no problems at all competing with endgame damage builds.  Its not optimal, but its close.  This build will one shot everything in the game thats not a Sheepsquatch, Behemoth or Legendary Scorchbeast with rifles.  And they heavy output on the queen is ridiculous.   Hybrids are very viable for a bloodied build.
---
For fun :) people come back for another go, bring their friends, send hearts and gift materials, it‚Äôs a pretty unique experience to have in the game :)
---
If your low on healing items just remember all the ingredients to make healing salves are right next to the overseer camp. River has bloodleaf and water and the blue flowers grow all over there.
---
I had a decent camp there before. I accidentally moved it a few months back, which led me to make a few more bases.
---
I would like to see wall decor that are boarded-up windows, sheets of plywood, riveted metal plates, etc. It would break up some of the monotony on the interior or exterior walls.
---
B2525* is bloodied ffr and less vats cost, explosive weapons are legendaries, they can drop at any level.
---
Ammo is easy, use ammo smith and super duper and go mining in the "lucky hole mine" its full of lead
---
There are different ways they could approach fixing this IE making the bag a physical object that players cannot stand inside and prevent others from grabbing
---
It'll be because you're giving out misinformation. Items respawn once you have collected 180 other items first. And the switching servers thing you mentioned isn't true either.
---
You‚Äôre right the Level 50 Colonel Gutsys are a nightmare, but I can usually outrun them. The bears are really fast.
---
What platform are you on?
---
You can only have one or the other so just scrap the collectron for now. And you can make Santatron find junk and collectron find toys if you have them both
---
For sure, for sure! Been obsessed with trap bases and trolling vids the past few days myself, it's hilarious content in an otherwise.. "tame" environment of 76? Love the game, but it's pretty "safe" lol.
---
Been watching a lot of Lorespade specifically, and ofc Clown Daddy xD Anyway, keep up the great work &lt;3
---
Bud, read the full post if you‚Äôre going to keep commenting haha I said I didn‚Äôt have anything of value to me in my bag that was that important. This is a suggestion for future instances when other players may lose out on stuff they want. You see what I mean?
---
I'm just hoping he can bring me enough candy to keep the vending machines full.
---
Yah i try to avoid it these days but sometimes i need certain materials so i need a workshop i use to enjoy pvp but since the damage cap its hard to do much i use to use black powder weapons and do decently enough not anymore
---
Incorrect, I just signed up for it last week, it was a 1 month subscription, or a one year. You have to manually unsubscribe if you went the one month route.
---
How dare you? How. Fucking. Dare. You?
---
False. I literally just did it myself, you're wrong. The monthly version doesn't repeat.
---
It's really not the same... My Two Shot Prime Utlracite Gat Laser is great for Scorch Queen, but when I want to make sure to tag everything, or clear a room, my TS-E Gat Laser is insanely good. I can't think of a better weapon, specially when it's got a thousand round mag with the correct perks. Could it be that you don't think they are OP because you've never used one?
---
Your logic makes sense but that‚Äôs not why they were removed.
---
Laser weapons with beam splitters make the explosive effect do 8x the intended damage. It‚Äôs broken as fuck and that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs still such a high demand for them.
---
Bethesda never said that the change was permanent. They were supposed to fix the weapon damage and then reintroduce them to the game.
---
Explosive laser rifles with a splitter do good damage, but they break way too fast to actually be a reasonable option. You might get a minute or two of steady use out of them before you have to stop and repair it again.
---
The price shot up just because they stopped the guaranteed spawn and made it a random occurrence. Unfortunately, they could do this with literally anything in the game to produce an artificial need and prices would skyrocket. 
---
Responder Paramedic Jumpsuit? 5 caps maybe. *Psuedo-Legacy no longer Auto-rewarded/spawned* Responder Paramedic Jumpsuit? 10k caps. You could replace this jumpsuit example with any item, black glasses, greaser jacket, etc, and create an artificial demand due to a perceived rarity. It's the same principle behind "vaulting" atom shop items. People might not want something until they know they cant have it anymore. They did it with the masks which by all accounts were given away or scrapped prior to that update. Then, boom, 20k overnight.
---
For that. there is a forgotten event called Monster Mash lol. Walk out of that mother with 500 candy every time.
---
I just did it last night lol, please tell me more
---
You are running some unnecessary perks. Super duper??? Even when fighting?
---
Take a break until Wastelanders. Nobody is expected to play one game without breaks. You'll have more fun once it releases if you come back off of a break than if you just keep playing bored waiting for something else to do. This is what I'm doing.
---
Super duper isn‚Äôt on my primary actually. Are there any other perks you think are unnecessary?
---
You did the switching servers last night?
---
Weighs nothing, too!
---
You can‚Äôt use a power fist in power armor, which is the point of the OP.  Aside from optimized bracers on a melee build, none of the arm mods are useful at all.
---
Motion assist servos are pretty weak.  You‚Äôre gaining +10 carry weight and a few extra points of damage.  Tesla coils assuredly provide much more of a damage boost with the constant zaps and hold aggro like nothing else, emergency protocols will keep you alive and are must-have if you go bloody, and a kinetic dynamo helps mitigate so much damage when coupled with the Dodgy perk.  If you‚Äôre in V94, your AP is constantly rocketing back and forth as you take hits and block damage.
---
Yep, 425 bulk sold
---
It‚Äôs bullshit in my opinion I could honestly have more kills if it wasn‚Äôt for the bug and I love the gauss rifle so it‚Äôs disappointing
---
Xbox
---
So, either this OP really doesnt like people running bloodied, or he just wanted an entire thread to downvote. 
---
Dont ask for advice, and then downvote everyone who gave you what you asked for.  Thats bad form dude.
---
Being found at a station suitcase is your red flag. If they were in a random container they would be a bug.
---
Most people have left and are waiting for Wastelanders. You should join us.
---
The two best effects are FFR - for ranged weapons, and FSS - for melee weapons. 
---
It‚Äôs all about hitting your enemy as quickly and as often as you can with the highest dmg amount per hit. 
---
You can‚Äôt have a weapon that has FFR and explosive.  It‚Äôs one or the other.
---
I‚Äôm sure someone will argue against me, but marine armor is not ideal on the typical unarmed build.  If you go bloody, which is the typical build, stealth is your biggest defensive asset.  Marine armor can‚Äôt be shadowed, so you‚Äôre losing some stealth capability.  I wear light/sturdy combat, metal, scout and leather, because I want to max out stealth.
---
If you have an idea for a high health vanguard suit, marine is a good choice.  I‚Äôm pretty sure heavy combat or scout will give you higher defense, but I don‚Äôt know off the top of my head.
---
Yep on my second subscription on PS4 and had to subscribe twice
---
We've all got our butts kicked by someone before. Move on like a healthy human being. I don't think video games are for you if you can't. And you tried to steal my resources, so I hit you with nuke mines. None of which actually killed you. You also don't seem to understand that just because I pointed out some game flaws that probably need patched, that doesn't mean I'm not going to use them to mess with someone who is clearly trying to fuck with me. The devs will take care of it once it gets known if they want to. Hell, if you hadn't built your shithole of a house in the forest safe-zone, I would have just dropped a nuke on you. And being somewhat known in the gaming community doesn't mean I have to be nice to assholes, or held to some kind of impossibly high standard because you suck. I will run into people I don't like occasionally, and I will do my best to shit on them just like you tried and failed to do to me. I won't be replying any more, but I advise you get off your victim horse and out of your safe space and learn a little about how to handle it when shit doesn't go your way.
---
Grief and pillage and stir the pot as much as possible.  Specifically shoot people at their camps or vendors and spread the raider love!
---
I'm commenting on the no pa set up.  I would say move three from endurance to agility,  1 from charisma to luck, 3 from intelligence to agility and luck.  you need class freak, more agility for sneak, dodgy maybe secret agent.  I have a bloodied melee character that one taps every enemy except the queen.  Unyielding armor for sure, maybe a life saving or auto stim piece too.
---
Thanks for this
---
I saw a player camp with display cases and vendors full of clean toilet paper and signage too
---
I get the idea you're talking about. My thought on the time/cap example though is basing the value on a constant, consistent variable. So your example of a BFFR handmade, you *kind of* would calculate how many days it would take you to get, along with the other factors you are talking about, so if the drop rate for that particular gun in 1/5000 or whatever, and you are re-rolling multiple legendaries a day/week, and also getting multiple legendaries a day, all those factors add in. Yes, I might get that particular gun first roll, or get it on the 10,000th roll. 
---
The other economic factor in play is this: unlike in real life, we have no real upkeep/maintenance/cost associated with living. Let's say we make 50,000 a year. Of that 50,000, I'd spend 40 to 45k just living: housing, food, clothing, utilities, etc. We don't have any of that kind of percent of loss in F076. Most players make 1,400 a day off vendors guarunteed, but only spend 200 or 400 on fast travel. No one really buys food, ammo or chems at NPC vendors. That is a huge margin over time since after 1 month of doing that and that alone you'd be max caps and wouldn't care about spending caps on an overpriced item. 
---
All that said, not saying you're wrong, it's just saying I hope they address the economy in a way that stabilises it and provides a semi-constant value to halt this rapid inflation. I'm not sure exactly how to do that, but putting out heads together to figure it out can't hurt.
---
"My opinion is that hacking a terminal should not give away your cover at all."  
---
Unless you mess-up the hacking, then the computer should make a loud beeping noise or play some hideous midi track while you're locked out.  Letting all the ghouls know you're stealing their werez.
---
Wear excavator armor for much more ore.
---
fireproof doesn't help with the sonic scream.  Refractor does. Its energy damage.  also your mutations arent set up right for bloodied melee.
---
* Beat the Grognak holotape game if you haven't
---
* Level up a challenge build (Try going mostly INT)
---
* Get on Mic and roleplay your character - fun to watch the reactions
---
* Take a break
---
I could stop at any moment.
---
If I wanted. I just don't want to.
---
You are high.  Legacy gat plasmas a op as fuck. They deal more damage than any non legacy by a lot. 
---
Outside of that beam splitter on any legacy makes them a flat dmg upgrade to other weapons in their class, often by a large amount. 
---
Bring them online with other weapons via a nerf then let them drop or just change explosive to something else specific to energy weapons that isn't op.
---
im assuming its a bug, or was overlooked.  an unyielding drop on thorns would actually make it be competitive with solar for the standard armors.
---
 right now for bloodied there isnt much point to solar/thorns over an unyielding set, that most bloodied already have.  for the full HP builds there is no upside that thorns has over solar.
---
I have 4 toons.  One bloodied melee/commando/rifle/heavy gun utility level 202.  One bloodied unarmed meat hook build level 107.  A Vanguard/cavalier pvp commando level 182 and my newest build is a level 70 charisma/luck/empath commando pvp build.  Also three cap mules level 2 all maxed for caps. Maybe I am just played out.....LOL
---
LOVE my AA 10mm SMG
---
Recently tried Rage 2, its fun but not as engaging as Fallout 76 at the start.  I play modern warfare and destiny 2 sometimes as well.  Maybe its all the subconscious dopamine hits they programmed into Fallout76 that keep me coming back....
---
Since you've already started and leveled up some new characters, maybe it's just time to go and play something else for a bit.
---
I stay of the horse thanks.

Post writer set up. Sneak Bld. Unarm/rifle build. All unyeld. And bld weapons.
---
The most OP tank build is going to be a full Heavy PA build running Blocker, Bullet Shield, Fireproof, Adamantine Skeleton, Dodgy, Action Boy, Serendipity, and I probably forgot 1 or 2 defensive things.
---
The most OP damage build is bloodied melee meat hook using both 1hand melee perks and Iron Fist, Talons and Twisted muscles.
---
I was not aware powerfist didn't work in PA, and 
---
on reflection, right, there are no PA exclusive weapons that I have found, melee or otherwise 
---
My primary melee weapon in PA is a vampire switchblade....does the job most of the time, and I have options for when it doesn't.
---
Unfortunately, I haven't acquired legendary armor that can match the DR of my PA, so I'm in it more than I'm out of it.
---
There already is a text chat mod. You won't get banned for using it.
---
probably the right idea.
---
Nice. I really appreciate the answer! Although i am curious as to what specific gear i would be wearing with my tank, which one of the power armors and what weapon to use with it?
---
It would be the only way a bloodied build would even look at these armors. 
---
No bloodied build in their right mind would drop their unyeilding set for a stupidly difficult to get situational gimmick armor set.
---
So many times I wanted to say something but you have to use emojis. I would like to say, does anyone have a nuke card? Or a thank you, but I'm stuck with yes or no.
---
Isn't it from Fort Defiance BOS quest?
---
We all do. It's hard to get killed in Fallout 76. Most of the time I need a Mirelurk Queen.
---
Yes, after thinking about it, I came to the same realization. Not sure what their goal was as the presents just disappeared.
---
Team, area, and party chat aught to cover it.
---
Personally, I cant type fast enough on the console onscreen keypad, especially in a combat situation.

Oh, what‚Äôs wrong with the mutations?

Another way to get it free, you can easily find one at fort defiance.

  I like the alien preparing to dine upon a deathclaw egg. Knife and fork in one hand, napkin tucked in....(near the really tall monorail tower)
---
I primed my explosive handmade after painting it black. It feels right.
---
It just doesn't work.
---
I didn't know that you could cheat either. Sure I die often but I often forget to use my chems. Likely that they are just using the proper perk cards.
---
No, that god level heavy gun is crap.  trade it in for a pipe rifle. 
---
With a statement like that, This feels like a troll thread.  Removing my comments, and letting you fend for yourself. 
---
You obviously dont need advice since you downvoted all of my posts.
---
That where the two hours comes in lol. I normally dont server hop since i know/do the whole map, but since it was a huge order i had to in order to save time. I normally can get around 300 bulk from 1 server including double hitting at the 2 hour mark. Im not hitting each little area at that mark, just the weight areas and acid,the real important stuff. I only server hop if im farming lucky hole, other wise i absolutly have no need to hop. Ive gone in and picked up just the ore and left just like everyone else i play with lol. Either way he got his answer. Not saying your wrong, but im giving my actual experience out there with time. I had no idea about this 180 item theory lol, i just know 2 hours for most things timing it myself without leaving the server, obviously server hopping for others. Ive been junking since i started this game,1600 hours, most being junking lol...i could probably make a fortune in ammo but hey, everyone needs junk üòÅ
---
You tried to transport a complicated full blueprint of a base? I'm sorry.
---
You gotta make a blueprint of just the skeleton, so the walls and ceilings and floors. Then move it and redecorate.
---
No its not
---
A lot of people will suggest scrapping all of your junk items to reduce their carry weight.  This is a good thing to do - but remember if you don‚Äôt scrap junk almost everything you pick up can be sold to a robot bender for 1 or more caps.  This was the best way for me to make caps early game.
---
If you going to use a laser as your main better learn to tank Tesla‚Äôs
---
I wish we could just pick out our legendaries from the purveyor rather than grinding for some 3 star wood or leather that I have to immediately return. I have okay luck with weapons but I *always* get shit armor from her.
---
Scrap Box, Tent, Emotes, Outfit ,Private Server.
---
  
---
That is what it included in order of value for me personally. Its really only worth if you are a long time/committed player otherwise just enjoy the game as is.
---
Isn't all character progress saved online with your bethesda account though? If I sign in on PC I should just have all my characters shouldn't I?
---
Great! Thank you.
---
Tenderizer doesn‚Äôt work with pvp
---
Is that a thing you buy at the park or does it spawn somewhere?
---
The way she goes.
---
I've put some time in. At lvl 35 right now. I feel like I'd have more fun once I'm at lvl 50 and can wander around with better gear. Just hard getting ballistic fibers and screws in those zones that require you to be able to dish out damage and deal with mobs.
---
IMHO, lever action is too slow for the WS golf club mob.  Need a semi or full auto there.
---
Or 
---
fireproof and some frag mines/grenades.  Draw them to the door, toss a mine on the staircase going down, and another just to the left of the staircase.
---
Wait intil you see them charging you, backpedal out the door while dropping a couple of more frag mines.  Jump onto the canopy (you'll need marsupial) then drop either mines or grenades over the edge.  
---
Watch the bodies fly.
---
Trick I learned during Mischief night: You can do something similar on cottage row.  The one across from the firestation - Go to the door to draw them out. Run to the firestation and jump to the roof, turn and shoot.  They get bored and run back to the cottage rather quickly, so its kinda cat and mouse, but it works.   Additionally, you can snipe the ones in the parking lot of the laundry area from the firestation roof.
---
Bonus:  From the same roof, aggro (whatever critter is) patrolling the area around the gazebo.  You can also get the same critter from the top of the presidential cottage.
---
Private worlds and however much stash space you use for junk is saved, about 100-150lbs maybe? Plus the unlimited junk space helps stockpile components. Oh and a tent too which has cooking station and scrapbox (unlimited junk pot).
---
Take a silver!

From one Appalachian camp builder to another this is beyond amazing and you deserve it!

A random non-hostile Super Mutant who was standing in the middle of a field around The Mire with nothing but some undies on. He never moved or said a word, so I took a picture of him with the camera from the quest and now it‚Äôs been my favorite loading screen. Hope I get to see you out there again some day, may the god rays keep shining down upon you.
---
I haven't tried the armor. But being aloud to pick your legendaries would completely destroy the economy and make pretty much all legendaries worthless. You'd never farm for legendaries because you'd already have what you want. Then there'd be no reason to play because there'd be nothing to grind towards
---
You can camp in one across from the pumpkin house, just mind the neighbors down at the fissure site  :-D

What I plan to do when I hit my next wall is start really exploring all the places I've found. There are hundreds of locations, and most I only marked on my map in passing and never really came back to. Now almost lvl 200, I still have a surprising number of spots I haven't ever taken a closer look at, and loads of terminal entries I never read.
---
Thanks. Seems quite dumb, seen as you can do this in other online games.
---
I am not an economist by any means, but I think I disagree with your definition of ‚Äútrue value‚Äù. 
---
Bethesda assigning a cap number of 800 is not the value of that outfit. It is the in-game price. 
---
‚ÄúThe most important distinction between price and value is the fact that price is arbitrary and value is fundamental. For example, consider a person selling gold bars for $5 a piece. The price of those gold bars is, in this instance, $5. It‚Äôs an arbitrary amount chosen by the seller for reasons known only to them. Yet, in spite of the fact that those gold bars are priced at $5, their value is so much more.‚Äù - Forbes https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2018/01/04/the-important-differences-between-price-and-value/
---
The price of that outfit is an arbitrary 800 caps. The value is clearly much higher for several players.
---
You can also transfer legendaries, aid, and junk between characters. Making mules way easier to use.
---
The one in the center-ish spot with the queen in the water.
---
Yeah once you are over level 50 and geared up well the stash box really shines for  those hard to come by items. Without it your forced to manage inventories of scrap for weight. As it stands now I have hundreds of screws and ballistic fiber and it doesn't cost me inventory space. For me the sub is worth it, but i'm basically a lifelong fallout fan and I really enjoy 76.
---
I usually only get weapons from her and what I don't want I sell to afford better weapons and good armor. I find it much easier to find good armor to buy rather than good weapons because not everyone wants the same legendaries for armor, but pretty much everyone wants the same legendaries for weapons
---
If it can be traded it will be no matter if it‚Äôs a on a platform or not , I‚Äôm just wondering since so many have it now and some traded a lot of High value things if Bethesda is going to chance making people mad by taking it
---
Good post, I like when people post info that's backed with data from a source. True enough, I misspoke. Should have said that is the true price, not the true value.

Here is my unarmed melee bloody build...You can swap out a couple slots from endurance to strength for the slugger cards...............IMHO you need more in Luck....you need max level class freak and you need the mutations for the build...get rid of photowhatever and solar powered, lifegiver, admat skeleton and rejuvenated are much better cards to use here.....you do not need 5 in makeshift warrior, I run none and use repair kits and repair whenever i go to my base....Put in 1 of glowsight in perception, just a dead card to eat space for this build.....You are missing action boy, dodgy and evasive from agility which are crucial to this build....Need to make some changes for sure

I don't think a Power Armor display frame is unreasonable either!

HeHe we're definitely both Junkyard dogs! Cheers bud, I'm not totally sure how long a cell takes to refresh if no other player enters it. But sounds like we're both kinda on the same page. And the outcomes are the same for both of us! Shit loads of materials. Have a good weekend captain!

She has been stressed with all the sales work. It isn‚Äôt easy being self employed for your own business. Think of the tax work she need to do later.

Thanks a lot
---
Ah okay. I missed that info, thanks!
---
Game was released very close but just prior to the ADA video game laws went into place. Do a quick search on it for full details.
---
So in effect they have no obligation to implement text. Lame and pretty crappy but i doubt they will ever spend time or money to add chat.

Yeah. It is a lot to write off.. No wonder there's a 150 limit. I should think more about her instead of my own needs. Being trapped in that mining suit and all.

This is my whole argument with the inflation in the housing market and why it makes me frustrated as hell. Selling a house/property to someone for higher than it's worth *shouldnt* increase it's value. Or, it's value shouldn't increase due to arbitrary factors like those house make over shows, guy with a tv show flips a house lists it 10% higher than it should be because his name is attached. His name doesn't add any tangible value like say a new bathroom would, or a new roof. That bothers the hell out of me. I rant to my wife all the time about that.

---
same was happening to me. 4 turrets, only one doing it. i heard it popping off and ran around looking for intruders, especially cuz i saw my brahmin dead, then after the 3rd time realized it was that rogue turret. i was basically done with the session so i just quit. hopefully it won't happen again when i log back on.
---
I use light and sturdy armor, and between blocker, serendipity and dodgy, those perks provide more defense than any armor in the game.  I could care less what my armor actually provides outside of a sentinel legendary effect.
---
A flat % to cancel or reduce damage is always going to beat any DR that current armors can provide.  It‚Äôs a problem with many games, not just 76.  
---
If you can max out two perks and block 75% of a Yao guai swipe, that‚Äôs going to beat any DR boosting perks.  If you supplement perks with T-51 DR, plus AP regenerating mods and healing perks, you can make yourself extremely hard to kill.  The lack of poison resistance is the only weakness for power armor, just as heavy radiation is for conventional legendary armor.
---
Nice, man that's impressive! Good job on the grind. I always just sell my maps

I have no idea what the cause is, I'm not that big of a techie to understand all that stuff. I know my laptop (bare bones model) experiences a lot of the same crash/lag/stutter with games and that its a definite cpu issue that I simply don't care enough to address. So maybe CPU? But I have no idea.
---
I'm just saying there are already multiple options for communicating to other players, built into both the game itself and the hardware on which it is being played.
---
IMHO, generating /reading text messages within a live action game is awkward at best; I don't have the dexterity to be actively defending myself against say...the imposter and a couple of gutsies, while simultaneously typing a message to give directions to another player. 
---
Consoles ship with a cheap mic.  If, like me, you can't find it, then they are easy acquired at your local walmart.

I am kinda XP addicted, and between all my toons I have gained over 800lvl. Of course there is a huge difference in gaining lvl 1 7or 8 times, ending up with 5 toons from 250 down to 96, and actually hitting 800. So maybe 500 to 600 if I went all in on one toon? I also play alot, but have missed a couple double xp events, and only started lvling in survival at the end ( for that sweet Xtra 20%).

\^\^ Cheater confirmed!
---
Hell yeah
---
because the whole thread felt like a trolling excersize, and you downvoted all of my comments. 
---
So you can learn on your own.
---
Prioritize stealth. The ghouls (and other enemies) should never know you are there. If your sneak breaks, back off and regain it.
---
Sneak damage bonuses and vats criticals are our bread and butter
---
Powe Armor " base" jumping off the hornwright mansion down in the ash heap feels like a high point.
---
If you wear power armor with medic pump and run cards field surgeon and first aid, it‚Äôs impossible to die as long as you have stimpaks. At least for PVE. I don‚Äôt care about PVP.
---
That strictly covers the tank portion. I‚Äôm not sure about getting the high damage in there. 
---
I‚Äôve heard the junkie‚Äôs build allows for high damage with high health. Haven‚Äôt tried it.
---
Dammit mupawa beat me to that joke!
---
 I have a plain scoped lever and a 1\* 2 shot lever.  At about 110 dmg, neither will one shot anything in the divide or eastward.  Sniping is different.  It is more than adequate for that function.
---
Given there are at least 15 critters that swarm you in the golf club, I'd die reloading it, even in PA and with speed demon.    Ergo, it is too slow.
---
How do you deploy the tent? I just got fallout 1st and am just completely missing how to do that.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 and want to unload duplicate plans let me know.  Have only completed t51 with 2-3 missing on other sets.
---
Send me a message, gather all the boys PVP ganertags and we will wreak havok on all of them
---
the teddy bears are always good
---
Ye, but like I'm below lv 100 so I'm not gonna be all that strong
---
Lol bro after level 60 your the same as every other level I was level 78 and killed a team of 3 230+ players all about the perks armor and weapons setup!
---
Yeah, I did mean the junk version. It's for collecting not really scrapping. I have plenty of aid version but I can't find a consistent spawn for honey beasts. 
---
I didn't know about morgantown gym, that's perfect, thank you, I'll check it out.
---
u/RIVA5150
---
That is correct. Morgantown isbetter suited for Lower levels. Watoga is better for higher levels. I would have answered but I am at work until 10 pm. And i just got on break. XD
---
That has got me curious. I can stand next to robots and scorched with my dcg and not be detected. I've never tried the boxing glove though.
---
This is the way.
---
The private server is actually my least used feature in 1st. The scrap box and survival tent being the most invaluable. It‚Äôs almost a no-brainer for anyone who cares about vending/trading/building and the annual fee gets you just over 50% off the atoms
---
One could only hope, but I'm not holding my breathe.
---
Only have full t-51b, missing some t-60 parts and 45, raider like 1 of each xd. Savage looks like maps. Thanks for this post it's awesome!
---
Agreed, doesn‚Äôt fit the stuck-in-the-cold-war aesthetic of the fallout universe at all
---
Truthfully, if they just started dropping Power Armor with legendary effects, it'd probably bring about some nice PA builds beyond just the standard heavy weapon builds that rely on stabilized.
---
I do t have enough experience with melee to answer this question.  But I will mention I‚Äôve also noticed that some melee weapons are more easily detected than others.   My instigating board, for instance, has a great reach and must be completely silent because it doesn‚Äôt seem to get detected.  Other weapons I can‚Äôt stay hidden at all.  Seem to recall the death tambo, despite being a musical instrument, was able to maintain stealth.
---
Get an instigating...I had a one star that I carried from level 45 until I started a second character and passed it on at level 250 or more.... When I ran a bloodied rifle build I was putting out over 500 base dmg and 800 with adrenaline, add in sneak, crits, drugs and easily doing over 2500 per shot. Could shoot a scorchbeast out of the sky in 1 or 2 shots.
---
Yes sir! Lol! Its relaxing to me, and just comes natural in other games, so why not put it to good use in this one. But yeah, everytime I do a private run for someone, give them theirs, fix my gear, put the rest up for sale and dont have to do anything again for a bit unless i feel like it. Junk hasnt failed me yet, supplied and geared all my creations. Even being a junker i always try to help out where i can tho for people with questions about it. Cant tell you how many random low levels ive showed easy supply routes to lol. But before i start rambling more, you as well, dont do anything i wouldnt do in the wastes....and thats a very blurry line üòÇ
---
They were going to have it, but Sony said no. Only Sony said no.
---
The Outer Worlds, Red Dead Redemption 2 with dashes of Apex, Fortnight and PUbG that should get you to Cyberpunk 2077.  After that check back here and see if any of the requests from 12 months ago are finally in the game.   At least Wastelanders should be live by then...
---
I dunno why they wouldn't include the mt fuzzy costume hat. Been like this though.
---
TBH, I used to think the same thing.  Was play solo, didn't need it.   
---
2 months later, when I started teaming up w/ someone i know IRL, I found out what a PITA it was to not have one.  You're right, Most of the time, I can't figure out the emotes, either.   
---
So I got a mic.
---
Well that stinks. I assumed it would. I only briefly played one of the holo games. My camp started getting shot at, and since then I left them alone.
---
I would be satisfied with "Loot All". Sure, you would pick up some stuff you don't want, but you could drop it at your leisure.
---
You're right: The Cranberry Bog is the worst, especially during a SBQ fight. You're too busy to loot your kills right away, and when the fight is over, many of the meat piles have disappeared or can't be found. Get a hit on a legendary? Loot all. Sort through everything later.
---
I was surprised, picked up a aa power fist, it doesn't even affect stealth.
---
Im new to the game just recently, so i dont fully understand how this is achieved. But i guess i should stay away from other peoples camps lol?
---
Will have to check it out. Thanks!
---
I take every last possible perk to boost damage when it makes sense.  I‚Äôll use one rank of tenderizer, but an additional 2% damage for the three rank card is silly.
---
If you‚Äôre not using serendipity, dodgy and blocker, use those.  With stealth builds, I invest nothing else in defense and have no problem staying alive during SBQ with less than 20% health.  Maxing out stealth ability is 95% of my defense.
---
My non stealth power armor guy goes for max damage with a couple furious machine guns and uses perks like First Aid and Born Survivor to supplement defense for soloing the vault raids.  The only danger in there is the poison from mirelurks.  With dodgy and blocker, the ghouls barely hurt at all.  If he can get through V94 without issue, everything else is little league.
---
I‚Äôm of the opinion that high DPS is the best defense.  Dead enemies pose 0 danger.
---
Fireproof and dense does work
---
That‚Äôs a great price.  I was thankful to buy the plan for 10K.   Two weeks later, during the last 25%off sale, I pulled a TSE Fixer.  I‚Äôm guessing the plan paid for itself in my case.  Hope it treats you as well!!!
---
Shame they're worthless
---
I‚Äôve been thinking I should start doing this and you‚Äôve convinced me üëç
---
Well, I've been trying to get one of my characters to a more tanky role. If you have any advice I would appreciate it myself.
---
The thirsty emote is pretty good. I play without sound so I'm kind of caught by surprise a lot lol The communist salute is good too.
---
Why this game doesn't have chat is beyond me.
---
Just write something about Reddit or something  in the request please :)
---
Confirming this analysis, I also prefer unarmed when non-Pa as you can free up the space in strength to add blocker and iron fist  and the talons mutation.
---
Luck should be class freak, starched genes and serendipity- all maxed.
---
Serendipity, blocker, nerd rage and lone wanderer make most attacks do absolutely nothing, and the less than 50% of attacks that do go through just hit your absurd armor rating brought to you by ironclad, evasive and barbarian.
---
The sweet damage is mostly from the mutations and Radicool, which is an insane boost for 1 point. Think of how much impact your points are having when building, compared to the 5point crafting perks in your build they‚Äôre eating up a lot of your available spaces when you could just swap in to them when you plan to use them
---
I got the sub mainly for the Scrapbox and the Private World. They didn't disappoint! Both handy for gathering materials, I wouldn't say it's an advantage as you still need to put the time in collecting stuff. You can hoard stuff, but again, you still need to collect the junk. I'm a crafter so I'm always using up materials to craft and sell items, not much point hoarding if you ain't gonna use it! HeHe.
---
-
---
If you're needing a bud on Xbox gimme a shout, or even a mess around in a Private World before you decide if you're gonna sub yourself! Cheers!
---
This hat is one of the things I point out to new players as a ‚Äúmust grab while we‚Äôre here‚Äù when helping them power level.  It‚Äôs a pain to get on the day of the challenge.
---
Nah, interact with him and all junk in your inventory is replaced with coal
---
Wow, ok then
---
She gives me script, then gets me from the back.
---
Why would using a different gun mean I don't need to tank a tesla?
---
You sir are an idiot. Congratz on 700 hours your mother must be proud.
---
That dudes a joker. Apparently honest pvp players use bad weapons and don't know how anything works
---
Because a laser is cheesier than a Tesla , no one is going to use a handmade to fight a laser is all
---
I got about an extra week of 1st benefits beyond the one month I paid for. The cancellation went through, I wasn't charged for a second month, I didn't get another allowance of atoms--I just continued to have access to the scrap box+private servers+tent for a while longer than I should have. If you've made sure your sub was cancelled, you're probably fine. Enjoy it while it lasts!
---
I‚Äôm glad you came out happy! ;) I try to make it worth it haha. I‚Äôll always let ppl try to get their bag if they come back :)
---
Hahahahaha you‚Äôre so mad and for what?!
---
I'm on PC, I bring up the weapon wheel, then press T.
---
If you haven't played Fallout: New Vegas, you should. I am currently playing it to remind myself what a great Fallout game looks like.
---
Otherwise, find another game to enjoy. Jump into 76 occasionally to complete some challenges or participate in an event, but get some distance from the game. This first year has been hard on us, the players who (want to?) believe Fallout 76 is worth sticking around for.
---
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-explosive\_incendiary/armor-piercing\_ammunition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-explosive_incendiary/armor-piercing_ammunition)
---
Thats odd cause for me a message pops up saying your survival tent could not be placed...maybe its a glitch that happenes from time to time but regardless it does need to be addressed and fixed
---
Awesome! Thank you!!
---
Nice one captain! Aye I find it very relaxing and enjoy gathering. I'm a crafter and run a PA Garage, selling sets and modding. Exploring is great. I remember the first time I found that room at the top of the building in Abandoned Big Town. "This is the place", I'd use that workshop every session, collect all the items around. Great. How things have progressed in my routes since then!
---
You can actually place your own tent within your camp. If you get a friend (or just luck upon it) who‚Äôs in your spot then leaves, place your tent in a spot that‚Äôs within your limits but you know is clear. Hop servers. When there‚Äôs an open spot both will load in
---
Best spots I've found for honeybeasts is Middle Mountain Cabins and the Freakshow. Not guaranteed spawns but a decent chance and if they do you'll get 3-4 from each location.
---
I've used over 400 maps, best I got was a stimpack!
---
It's a guaranteed drip I think. Everytime I've done it I've gotten a fedora
---
I had a guy shoot the floor next to me with an explosive gatling gun. It did zero damage. I had him to the same with an explosive gatling plasma. It did capped damage. I have both Fireproof and Dense.
---
I'm getting a lot of conflicting claims. From my observation, being on the receiving end, both Fireproof and Dense don't seem so useful against legacy explosive weapons. If you can link me to something more concrete, cybervirus, I'd like to see it.
---
Sort of, but it has a higher base damage. It uses the same weapons mods but not the same skins. It's weird how they have it.
---
Have you ever used an old mechanical keyboard? There is nothing stealthy about them. I used to tease my friend in chat about his "angry typing" because of how loud and fast he was with one. Thing was over 20 years old and still worked flawlessly, but damn it sounded like he was typing with a wooden hammer.
---

---
I hate to say this, but bloodied works better than Instigating. I looove instigating. 
---
If your rifleman is going to stealth, bloodied beats instigating beats anti-armor beats stalker.
---
I don't play Junkie's.
---
I did not know that. Never tried to put my own tent in a campsite area because well its kind of pointless i think
---
You PVP a lot or nah?
---
It‚Äôs very pointless. Makes a decent decoration piece though
---
No but I mean, its profitable so I would
---
Xbox? Next time I run into that pesky traveling vendor bot I'll see if he has some TLC for ya.
---
Down in the Cranberry Bog there‚Äôs the pit mine filled with water following the main road headed north out of Watoga.  It‚Äôs called Quarry X3.  A mirelurk queen jumps out of the manmade lake.  Facing north and looking across the water towards the Quonset hut, there‚Äôs two port-a-potties to the left.  Inside one is a Mr Fuzzy hardhat.
---
If it‚Äôs not laying next to the seat, someone else took it and the cell hasn‚Äôt reset yet.  Hop until you find an unlooted server.  It‚Äôs a static spawn and always appears unless you‚Äôve looted it in the past 20 hours.
---
Put on your new hard hat, fast travel to Dolly Sods and collect some easy atoms.
---
I draw the line when I see ‚Äúunder attack‚Äù on my screen. There‚Äôs too many shithead design choices that‚Äôll end up with 3 guys wrecking my camp in 5 seconds then hopping in place with Tesla‚Äôs when I return fire on the one douchebag that can‚Äôt wait two minutes for me to read through all the effects on the trash legendaries in a WS noobs vendor without emoting and firing explosives in front of me to hurry me up.
---
Interesting. I doubt they can make any other caliber like that since it would be very difficult to put the explosive in smaller arms ammo.
---
Sweet well we can teach you a bunch of stuff, take a tour around to workshops and blow some bases up, talk perks ect. Add me and we'll blow shit up, check my captures lol
---
Thank you. Where is the freakshow at? Not sure I'm familiar with it
---
üëå
---
Play a diffetent game , i was away 8 months .
---
Returned for 1 month ago , but now im hitting the wall again , there is just not enough content for us  non explorers - non traders
---
Thanks! Surprisingly traps aren‚Äôt very common at all :)
---
Had a tse lever that dropped. Ended up selling it in vendor, the tse handmade is better imo all the way around. Instigating lever has it's uses, but carry a dragon instead for one hit and switch back. I still haven't played with a ie lever though. I have a ie handmade that sits in storage because the explosion messes up damage on mobs around the target.
---
Some of the armor plans (Deep Pocketed, Leaded etc) always sell pretty well in my Vendor for 100-300c. Free money. Worth the effort alone!
---
I‚Äôd be happy to add you and hop on private and leave you to your business anytime. GT same as u/
---
I've noticed something weird like that before with the box gloving versus meat hook/power fist, something does feel different about the boxing glove and I'm not sure what it is.
---
Return it.
---
The challenge has always been this way.
---
I'm in the exact same boat as you. Xbox by any chance?
---
Yeah, private server is too limiting at the moment. I'd love the option to open it up if we wanted, or have it somehow persist past our logout. 
---
I mainly use it when I want to farm mats from workshops, in peace.
---
The plan is to charge rental fees for those servers indefinitely rather than pay employees to develop weapons and challenges for them
---
I'm hearing from some that after about a week or 2 of not resubscribing, the scrap box stops working for you, as well as other 1st perks.
---
To be honest, the only thing that stealths the fuck out of me is shadowed light combat armor. I become invisible even with 12 agility at midday. Something is broken and God knows what it might be. 
---
Some enemies will detect you because bugs.
---
exactly how i feel... like im playing fallout lite.
---
Heavy Missile Jet Pack - It's a Jet pack... and it also fires homing missile (occasionally)
---
Someone hire Tony Stark now!
---
You're a much better explainerer than I am XD
---
He killed the queen and then normal scorchbeasts in the mire
---
thats true and i also got some nice weapon plans like gattling plasma too. The huge amount of psychotats is also nice because it's not craftable.
---
Easy ways around this.  Off the top of my head a completely undetectable method of aimbotting that uses the vga or hdmi output or whatever. No code access needed.  You‚Äôll never stop it and the harder companies try to make it the more it attracts hacks.  You can‚Äôt really fault Bethesda,  I‚Äôve seen companies try to stop it and it‚Äôs pointless.  When u play a FPS you‚Äôll always be left wondering
---
Just tested Dense and fireproof AGAIN with no RNG involved and same armor stats (serendipity and sent/ass etc.) and sure enough Dense makes a big difference along with fireproof helping a bit, if you were dying for a point or two you could run FP rank 1 but I imagine against max dmg BE laser you want all the dmg reduction you can get.
---
For your build I would defo only use Rank 1 Tenderiser as you are spending two points for a mere 2 % dmg bonus and some bonus time but you can just hit the enemy again to reset timer, spend one of those points maxing nerd rage instead and the other elsewhere. Quickly tested Tenderiser again too as people keep making me doubt myself spreading misinformation en mass without testing and it seems to work just fine.
---
its balanced when you arent staring a minigun in the face.
---
Ha yeah.. Reddit is full of that kind of stuff. Still, maybe someone that could use the help. Fack em xD
---
I'd like to know if its True random or pseudo random, though. 7 gamma guns in 30 item pulls doesn't seem very random :D
---
Because you're a peasant. Maybe if you payed for Fallout 1st, though...
---
Cool story and all but there still needs to be a text chat in game for people like me that don't use Mics.
---
Pretty much this. If you‚Äôre the type to plan your build ahead of time, place all your INT perks first so you‚Äôll start leveling up naturally fastest. 
---
You can also do the event at land view lighthouse whenever it pops up for an xp boost, get well rested, take bobblehead:leader and eat cranberry relish. That would be the highest amount of stackable xp bonuses you can have at once. Then spend an hour event hopping or doing queen fights and profit
---
I think that's all that's going on. Still gonna double check when I get home tho &lt;3
---
How much a ride?
---
All the quests are complete.  The only things left are back pack ( grindy, dont care ) and Strangler Heart PA ( grindy,don't care )
---
Oh yes! Kaching, HeHe. I was mainly doing them for the PA Plans, but also breaking down all the guns and armor for scrap. Was just too handy for ammo crafting too.
---
They all need protection bonuses, anyone can rack up damage with perks and legendary effects, PA or not. What they really lack in is protection, especially in PvP. Something that could reduce damage in percentages like legendary armors would help it out a lot, or maybe they add up the resistances of any armor you‚Äôre wearing( or at least half of it) so Anti armor effect, armor piercing mods, and perk cards won‚Äôt be as devastating to it as it is in its current state.(though I don‚Äôt know how well that would balance with PvE) but I get what you‚Äôre saying. Lorewise, T-51 is the most protective of the sets at the current time period since the Enclave PA is still in prototype. Maybe that suit could have something like reduce all damage by 20% since it‚Äôs the most protective. Enclave could have reduce all energy damage by 20% cause it offers the best energy resistance and Ultracite can have reduce all ballistic damage by 20% and so on
---
That's a old trick. Actually back when you could pk people in adventure that was a thing. Stand on top of their bag and browse through it, they can't pick it up.
---
The outer worlds doesnt interest me, RDR2 is in the rotation, APEX -- nothanks, PUBG---2000 matches played....trying to hit Rage 2 now
---
I have a hard time going backwards to old dated games and I hate the old vats.  It kills me.
---
Pc
---
If they're going to rot, does anyone know how long I have after collection?
---
I tend to agree.  I may be just done with the game for now.
---
Those exist as well
---
Use perk Good with salt
---
A little southwest of Huntersville or almost directly south of Devil's Backbone. If you go there and start making your way to Watoga you should see the compass marker pretty quickly.
---
I've sold so many wedding rings from off of that dapper little fellow!
---
Junkies will give you +50% damage assuming you have 5 additions. Each addiction will have a negative side effect of reducing a SPECIAL stat point (or two, or more) or AP or DR associated with it. You can spread the impact across multiple stats based on what you're addicted to. Addictions don't go away unless you take Addictol or eat a Radscorpion Egg Omelet. Taking the same chem you are addicted to will suppress the addiction, but also reduces the damage by 10% as you're no longer addicted to that particular thing. Need to choose what you want to get addicted to based on your play style.
---
It's a fun build and can deliver some good damage while staying at full health. It's not as much damage as Bloodied, but it gets the job done.
---

If you're on the Filthy sub here, some of us are planning a Treasure Hunt Workshop for lower levels, or anyone really. Showing folks the routes and rewards etc, swapping plans. Just a fun weekend really, different times, different hosts. It'll be in Jan, just after the New Year.
---
They have earned some of the trashing. I defend the game, paid full price, got hours of fun, but... 
---
They have earned some of the trashing. Don't know if they are trying hard, but sometimes, more than a year after release, the game still feels heavily and surprisingly bugged. 
---
When the 250 DR bug ruins a weapon and the game works better on private premium servers... They have to shut up and take the trashing. It's part of the deal because the fan base has been reeeaaally tolerant.
---
it's not rocket science.  Wastelanders was supposed to have been released already but was delayed.  There are a lot of people that will take advantage of the free week that probably know about wastelanders (because of the NPC's) but they might not know it hasn't dropped yet.
---
Once you get those nuked materials, you have to go to a chemistry workshop and use materials like Hugh radiation fluids, obtained from enemies killed in nuke zones, and it will have the option for nuked flora, craft what you need, otherwise other people can build them for you
---
I was hanging out at the bottom of a lake chillin waiting on the last of the circle to close in. This motherfucker walked on the damn lake bed. About 20 feet deep water, and right up to me. He then shot me and walked out of the water. Wtf...since when was there a perk for that? This was also on xbox too.
---
Seen a guy hovering, not flying but suspended in the long fall animation, spamming grenades on people he wasnt taking damage either. Also on xbox. 
---
Since when was this a thing on consols?
---
Short answer yes.
---
No way lol
---
Unless someone put them there, they only drop from the Encryptid event.
---
Sheeeeet. Good luck on the hunt. This is the way.
---
Items don't spoil when you're not logged in. This fortunately isn't Metal Gear Solid 3. 
---
The Good With Salt perk in Luck and/or the Refrigerated mod for backpacks reduces the rate at which your stuff spoils, by a significant amount. There's also a refrigerator you can get in the Atom Shop, but it's kinda lousy.
---
You remembered to grab High-Radiation Fluids, Glowing Mass, and Hardened Mass right? They drop from enemies in nuke zones and are required for refining your raw flux into stable flux, which is what you craft with.
---
They won‚Äôt rot while your at work...
---
Or is that actually a thing?
---
I thought time only passed when you where logged into the server.
---
I never had a problem wit it,nor have I ever heard of things rotting away cause you hadn‚Äôt logged on in a bit.
---
yeah google is hard for some people
---
Free of course :)
---
How the hell did you get that many maps?
---
FYI - there is an option in the settings menu to do just that. I think it's called 'Damage by the Numbers" or something.  Just turn it on.
---
Yes. Same as the LMG, Gatling gun and maybe the Gatling laser I think)
---
Thanks ya all
---
I would tag along too.  Been trying to score the fixer plan, keep getting common items
---
PSN is Woodchuck
---
I smell a catch...
---
True. The servers have problems as it is.
---
This is why the settlements need your help
---
I mean, _could_ work, but the perk cars descriptions don't say as much or the numbers when crafting do t change before you do it. Needs testing
---
It is? DESTORY IT!
---
Oh, you didn't know Unicorns eat Halloween cats? üòï
---
You may not need 7345 units of fiberglass now and maybe you have never needed them... but... Maybe you WILL need them later.
---
Nice.  I had found mine for 400 caps and I knew that was a deal, didn't think I would be able to beat that price.. until last night... found one for 35 caps! LOL.  Couldn't believe it.
---
Hey! You'll need to Stabilize them before you can use them, with other materials found on enemies only in Nuke zones. They won't degrade once you do.
---
They won't degrade while you're at work, only when you're in game. It's not MGS3: Snake Eater (what a game by the way!).
---
You can prolong their condition if you have Good with Salt Perk Card, Refrigerator Backpack or the Camp Refrigerator. The Camp fridge is better than Good Salt Perk 1*, not amazing, I like it for storing, 15 items per fridge.
---
I think the Backpack mod is the best, or Good with Salt 3*. I have neither. Sad face. I have three fridges though. Happy face and wink.
---
What is the 180 item rule?
---
It should be. I also dislike being able to run while wielding an axe with a puny 1 strength skinny malnourished character. 
---
Weapons and armor should have min/max requirements.
---
I found the same thing just today!  Code is 00000 and it leads to an elevator which will take you to vault 79 when it opens in the wastelander update.
---
By any chance it is from Wolf's cache at Hornwrights estate ?
---
And the wrapped cap which I love.
---
Some melee weapons have a loud "sound" that accompany them. These things are left for us to figure out ourselves and sometimes dont make much sense
---
Yes, but I had collected much cobalt flux two days ago and I believe it all spoiled. I'll get that perk before I try again. Thank you very much.
---
The best source is one violent night. The boss ghouls have a high drop chance for treasure maps (like every boss). General's Steakhouse for example has a boss supermutant and a chest which also has a good chance for a treasure map. I also managed to buy alot but they are hard to find because so many guys sell gunpowder or inactive flux wich is also under "misc" (you look at the map and some guy has 200 misc -&gt; fasttravel -&gt; 200 gunpowder yeah..)
---
PA is weak.  Tesla bracers are useless. rusty knuckles are useless, jet packs are glitchy and broken...power armor should be amazing but.....wearing cavaliers AP refresh, using a bloodied 10mm prime smg and born survivor I stomp on teams of power armor users like they're toys.
---
I just tested it Dense helps a lot in reducing the splash explosion dmg from a explosive legacy along with Fireproof helping a bit.

I am not 100% sure but from what I can gather ballistic damage is the main damage source in the game and obviously has been on past games, energy damage works in a odd way by adding a spell onto weapons and armor and doing damage that way which obviously causes problems with other things as we have seen in the past with Energy damage not being affected by Anti-Armor since that refers to the "official" means of damage which is ballistic.
---
Energy damage is iffy as as far as the game is concerned as it was not fully implemented in the proper way like ballistic damage is which breaks other things that try to mess with it like perks, and somewhere along the line we get explosive energy weapons which work funny as they are energy(iffy) and also explosive then explosive changes the projectile to do splash damage which should be ballistic... you can see where this is going, a more experienced modder could explain this much better as I could be incorrect somewhere but you get the point.
---
In my opinion though Dense/FP for BALLISTIC damage is op as it effectively makes splash damage do literally nothing unless you do insane base damage, in a perfect world energy explosive should be a tiny tad less as if you know what you're doing you drop faster from a handmade than a laser and Ballistic explosive weapons should actually help some cause right now it's all bout fire rate.
---
Well for one of you cheat you get all the bad ass rewards without without even trying. So there's that.
---
For sure
---
Uh oh.. Stinky!
---
Spawns there for me every time
---
I remember a vending machine full of road leathers, corn, batons, handcuffs, oil, toilet paper, soap, etc. Red lights, etc. A private room with magazines and more. 
---
Really, a sex-shop. Awesome place. Bought handcuffs for the wife.
---
In other news, water is wet.
---
FWIW I concentrate on collecting the high radiation fluids and the hardened and glowing masses in the nuke zones.  None of those items degrade, so you can collect and store those for later.
---
Gathering flora in nuke zones  is easily done as an afterthought.  You can even attend a SBQ event and just walk the outer edges of the battle zone for flux.  The Green Thumb perk applies to nuked flora.
---
Nah, it removes all wall decor when you add Wallpaper. Check your Stored Tab. Cat should be there so you can replace it. ;)
---
I need to see proof of this half-naked Supermutant in the Mire.
---
I have some fedoras. Like... Fifty of them. No plans.
---
Christ does Bethesda like making things a grind.
---
If I can figure out how to transfer my screenshots from PS4 I‚Äôll probably end up posting it on here some day.
---
Better get brewin' those 'shines!!
---
Not the correct picture, also this has already been posted here
---
Pa needs some good defensive perks to make up for being slower and bulkier than regular armor 3 Star pa with maybe some AP refresh and less damage % taken would be amazing similar to assassin's
---
It should also destroy buildings but here we are.
---
I'd at least have two purifiers out -- One for you, and one for them. Doesn't hurt to be neighborly.
---
If my buddy wants to kill her I will message you! Same psn name?
---
I didn‚Äôt downvote you at all? Whoever did that now drags me into it ;(
---
i really do appreciate the answer. I see no reason why someone would downvote you.
---
They're probably alts for scrip
---
I run it with groups instead of Lone Wanderer.
---
Perfect. Appreciate the help, thanks
---
That had to be the most tacticool mall ninja weapon I have seen in a long time. 
---
I will be happy if they just give me explosive, acid, burning or freezing bolts.
---
In the words of the mimicking Assaultron....
---
*baaa*
---
There are a lot of items in this picture that arent in the game, the wider barn door, the red letters, and the weird paint thing over the door
---
You can bash them to make it better. Feel it.
---
You'll see a lot of down-votes from the 'haters'. Don't let them get to you, and enjoy the game for what it is.
---
He's one of the naked lvl 2s get him
---
Id probably agree thats where i keep my alts all level 2-4 easier to transfer
---
PSA: On PS4 it's weapon wheel then triangle.
---
All of my characters are level 30+
---
I didn‚Äôt downvote u/SmakzMS . Whoever did now makes me  look bad.  What a jerk.  I really appreciate everyone answering qnd  i  have  no  reason  to  downvote  anyone.  I don‚Äôt use the  upvote/downvote system.  I  do  +karma.
---
Finally ill have motivation to push for my final 12 levels lol
---
All builds can benefit from serendipity, bloody mess and action boy.
---
Incorrect. Scrapbox stays even after sub ends. You can still take scrap out but not put more in.
---
I never downvoted u/SmakzMS ,  to  clear  my  name.  Whoever  did  is  a  jerk  and  should  post  as  to  why  someone  get‚Äôs  a  downvote.
---
No you dont need to mule. You can place scrapbox in private and adventure and access all your scrap from either. PS: the scrapbox auto-scraps junk so no need to trek around for a workbench either.
---
Congrats, I'm missing 1 45 piece (Right Leg) and 3 Raider pieces (Both legs, Left Arm) and have gotten extras of other pieces.
---
That's kinda my point though, the free trial was announced on ITV, so if for some reason you follow ITV  but don't have the game, you should already know that Wastelanders was delayed. 
---
Hell even without following ITV the delay of Wastelanders was all over YouTube, Kotaku, IGN etc.  
---
So I find it hard to believe that some random person would be like "Fuck Yea, free Fallout trial and there's supposed to be NPCs now right?" So I don't understand the point of putting it in there.
---
Nope just very high chance
---
Oh yeah!
---
I'm trying to grind this too, any tips?
---
Again, someone saw logic, then made an argument against the weapons being logical. Try actually reading what I wrote! What a novel idea...
---
I was explaining the developer's logic for removing the explosive effect from guns, not the logic of the guns themselves. Very few things in the game are actually logical, it's a video game after all. The explosive effect does ruin the intended mechanics of energy weapons though, and that's why it was removed.
---
I would be surprised if they did. The way to pass it isn't really a glitch. It's the same way you pass an entire set of any power armour. A lot of players aren't as in the know as the reddit dudes.
---
I love that this crazy trap CAMP sits exactly where my CAMP is located.
---
Stay Inside The Forest Region(1-14), then slowly Move Down Into The Ash Heap (15-24), Next Head Up To The Top Of The Map To Venture Around The Toxic Valley(25-34), Then Head Right To The Mire And Grind The Inhabitants For A While (35-49), Then Finally Go Down To The Cranberry Bog, (50+), The Numbers In Parentheses Are Suggested Levels For That Region Of The Map, You Can Always Backtrack For Questing And Base Building. (ESPECIALLY THANKS TO NUKES)
---
Fortunately for us all (sort of), the properties of fresh water make it largely unaffected by a surface or air burst nuclear detonation. The evaporation effect you are talking about wouldn't really happen. An underwater explosion in a deeper body of water, like the ocean, does leave some residual water vapor in the air, but we're fresh out of oceans here in Appalachia.
---
So basically useless though.
---
you guys are fucking retarded
---
enjoy your non-cosmetics
---
Yeah. It was Sony that turned them down for cross-platform play
---
That's a very cool camp. I haven't seen those wall panels before the light brown and blue? Hmmm gotta go see if I can get me those, get my joe building on this weekend ;)
---
Looting from instanced containers. If you take the loot out of box"a", the loot in that box (vein, ect) will not respawn until you have looted 180, something's. I am  totally not clear if it is different containers or different items. Functionally if you  loot only one area ( westek for example) you will find alot of empties. If you take stuff from many sources, you run into way less empties.
---
Or they're just mules transferring stuff around.
---
Xbox?
---
Why not link to the offical site instead, where it was posted 2 days ago?

"cosmetics-only" - Bethesda's launch promise
---
You said it much better than I did lol.
---
You can't take damage from other players outside of PvP, and neither can your CAMP. You should know that.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong here, but you cannot use nuked flora for crafting a decon shower until you stabilize it first.

Don‚Äôt know how to do the spoiler stuff on mobile or I could tell you what it is. It‚Äôs interesting
---
Okay, okay. I was just asking.
---
That's always been like that. Follow the wires.
---
Couldn't be arsed
---
You mess with my boy Elundis and I‚Äôll whoop yo ass
---
No worries :)
---
Also, this isn't how physics works in real life! There's a lot more to a nuclear detonation than thermal radiation! It's not like boiling water.
---
It‚Äôs so nice just roaming around all by your lonesome gathering materials and putting it in a nice box that‚Äôs infinite. 
---
Then heading over to uranium fever, taking your time whistlin‚Äô dixie. Not worrying about having your legendaries one shot killed. 
---
Hell, I even got up to get a beer during uranium fever.
---
What a stupid question!
---
- Bethesda fucks up again
---
- people talk about Bethesda's fuck ups
---
/u/anticlocklock you guys only talk bad about Bethesda and I don't like it hurrdurr
---
Posting in case others don't know, but Fallout 76 has the same hacking mechanic as previous Fallout games, where if you find groups of special characters on the same line in a column (Examples: () &lt;&gt; [] ) even if they have other stuff between them, you can highlight them and they'll either: remove a dud password, or reset your tries. If you're dealing with a particularly tough terminal, start with those. :)
---
If you're giving her script, you're doing it wrong.
---
Frisbee with the disc? Got to be the most frustration free fun you can have with it.

JefferyLewbowski on PSN

There are other caves you can place a camp in. One really cool one hidden south of Vault 96. It's almost impossible to find the entrance - you sort of have to find an odd hole in the cliff face first, then explore to the left. Another one exists near Vault 76... I can't remember the specific location, but there's a pond nearby. Once you find the pond, look for an archery target. There's a small crack in the floor near it, which leads into the "cave." There are a lot of underground tunnels in the Cranberry Bog as well.
---
It would be unfair to people who bought it not knowing, kinda like they would only remove dupes and leave you with 1 item.
---
Stealth is jacked, always has been, always will be.
---
If your worried about weight use lvl 2 or max bear arms. Helps a lot
---
If you traded for the power armor there's no way you didn't know it was an exploit when they started going through the motions of the exploit. As for removing dupes, they do only take away duplicate items and leave you with one. But imo the Power Armor should be removed completely from those who didn't craft it
---
Wait, this isn't a problem at all. You can use melee weapons and bashing to move other players. Switch to Pacifist Mode if you don't want to risk them retaliating.
---
Free trial is coming up, give it a try then and decide.
---
There is a fix already - see my other post.
---
What else am i supposed to do with it?
---
I usually play em when farming fusion cores on a friend's private.
---
Yeah I don't much care for your exploit gang lol but it's good you guys are close
---
I play on Core i3-4030U (1.9GHz 2 cores+HT), 2GB DDR3 GF840M (it's like a half of 750Ti). I understand, maybe some play on Intel HD... But it's already WAY below the game "minimal" specs. NO PROBLEMS with proper .ini.
---
So, "a client PC has to display" is a bad and ridiculous excuse. After all - my stands are inside a house - no "endless open space" rendering required.
---
Free trial next week and the game will be half off digitally if you decide it's for you.
---
You son of a bitch, I'm in.
---
This makes me happy.
---
oh of course you need to be patient, it took me several months  to get this large amount of maps. And prepare to be over encumbered ;)
---
I don't think you're supposed to do anything with script.
---
The purveyor takes scrip, not script.

"Note: With¬†Patch 9, Deathclaws, Mega Sloths, Mirelurks, and Scorchbeasts are no longer able to be pacified as they are not classified as animals.¬†"
---
What do you kids?
---
Oh my God. Thanks. Ive been doing it all wrong.
---
True...powerfist they hear , dcg they dont
---
Thank you, I didn't consider an intermediary step.
---
OK thanks very much for that, tend to get disheartened after nearly 20 server jumps, just unlucky. I'll keep trying.
---
So far I keep getting cat bowels in the left hand loo üòí I don't pick anything up so fingers crossed.
---
Lots of games break promises, Bethesda has been breaking promises since Oblivion, they've never followed through on the things they say, not even with Morrowind. Pretty sure if the game was gonna be a failure it would do it right around the one year mark. But it hasn't yet and that makes the people on the hate train seethe lol
---
Just want to complete the challenge, kind of gets under my skin and need to get it done üòé
---
Another good spot for yao is just outside the Alpha Silo shack. Might roam to the other side of the pond but I seem to always encounter one there.
---
‚ÄúThe state of the game ‚Äú ??? Go elsewhere, troll 
---
For a serious answer, there‚Äôs a half off sale coming up with the free weekend
---
I jus done a SBQ at lv43 and boy was it fun I didn't die either and only went there to get nuked flora still it prob helps this being my second time through so I was well prepared
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
Do you like fallout exploration and have dumped 1000s of hours into playing and modding fallout 4? If the answer is yes, it's worth 10 bucks.
---
Aha, that makes sense!
---
Nothing wrong with that. Nuka cola is more iconic to us Fallout players than real world sodas
---
Ok, makes sense!
---
Ok, cool, thanks
---
They had a similar mechanic in Thief. You could sneak and pick locks, but if you broke a lock pick they would hear you and investigate.
---
Can confirm it's there. Are you on PC? I can lend you one to complete the challenge and you can obtain one for yourself when it's not in high demand.
---
Yeah. I like to actually drink coke and play when I can afford it. I usually have to use sam's but i imagine nuka cola doesnt have a specific flavor because it doesnt exist!
---
Plus, if you were going to dupe stuff, I'd think you'd want to do it where the *least* amount of people would have a chance of running into you.  Berkley is the opposite of that.
---
ooohh, thanks for the tips!
---
no offense intended! i just see alot of critics heavily criticizing the game for some of the choices the devs are making. like i said i haven't played in a hot minute, would love to see what's changed!
---
Yeah, I see underwear and I jump to conclusions.  Hell they were probably just wrasslin around, like boys do.
---
What challenge is this?
---
You can get glass bottles of Nuka from their Bethesda store and I can share the official Nuka Cola resippie from the Fallout Recipe Book if you want OP
---
You might already know it but you can get PA plans from the event distant thunder. I got all my T-60 plans and some of the T-51b from this event. I always thought it only can drop T-60 and T-51b but 2 weeks ago i got my one and only (got the other ones from tresure maps) T-45 plan. The drop chance is maybe around 10-20 events for a PA plan but most of the time you will get the T-60 motion assist servo plan.
---
It would be neat, but Gamebryo, ops, Creation Engine can only do so much, and I don't think it could do this sort of thing in a reliable way, to be honest. A smoke effect on the SBQ when someone is using a Strangler Heart power armor is enough to crash the game to half the server, imagine a whole lake or river drying down and then refilling up while all the visual effects of a blast zone are happening with a dozen of players blasting their plasmas and lasers, my Xbox would explode as hard as the nuke itself, lol.
---
The funniest thing that happened to me in this game wasn't from the game 'per se', but it has to be the two kids with open mics arguing about something that had happened on their previous game on Roblox while browsing my vendor, but considering just things from the game, the random encounters are hands down my favorites, like seeing the Mr. Squeeze with his stand right in front of the SBQ in a fight, or the Insult Bot appearing just when I was about to enter the Vault 94 and this sort of things...
---
Well you're not wrong, but for certain weapons and builds, the 3rd effect can make a huge difference.
---
It's not for every build, but it can important.
---
Typically I am the same way, but 3* weapons lead to 40 return scrip compared to 15 scrip if it's a bad roll. Therefore you get more back for more attempts.
---
lol
---
Kill a bear while wearing the hat, I just jumped server again, and as I approached the toilet saw the yellow hat was on on the seat, before I could pick it up it disappeared. 
---
I'm going to throw my PC out of the window and drink alcohol. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
- Keanu Reeves.
---
Thanks, very kind, are these Challenges the same for everyone, I'd not thought about that, could be that everyone is grinding for this damn hat.
---
Recipe*  +1 for effort though
---
Just to add onto OP's post, armor rolls should ALWAYS be 3* rolls
---
framerate issues like what you speak of can be caused by a variety of things. 
---
The first and most common thing that causes this is poor internet infrastructure.  When a system cant communicate with the host it causes the game to be a bit jumpy, or laggy,
---
You could have a dirty heatsink in your xbox, causing overheating on the vid processor, which can cause framerate issues.   Do you have pets, or smoke?
---
When was the last time you hard reset your system (hard hold the center controler button and select restart system).  This will clear your current data cache, allowing your game to function more efficiently.  If your data cache is full, it causes latency issues while the system is deciding which old data to discard to store the new game data from your current connection.    
---
When was the last time to freed up space on your XBox.  If you are running out of HD space, delete some games you arnt playing right now to allow more space for fallout 76 to cache data in.
---
It's more fun to say resippie and if you notice I spelled it correctly the second time I said Recipe lol
---
It's for everyone. That's why the hard hat is in high demand currently.
---
Pretty sure the karma dart from Rosy does the same thing. It also can proc pvp on people.
---
lol, im pretty sure thats a joke like my listing is also ment as a joke and im on PS4. The Forrest was a huge dissapointment except the huge amount of addictol.
---
It's just the way the game runs. I play on an X and I have these stutters from time to time, and even on PCs these things can happen.
---
I thought this has been the meta for a while now
---
 Depends. My BoS Heavy is somewhat better than my Excavator except in Rads.
---
There is a flyer in the agricultural place near flatwoods, but it might be for the teapot. ü§î Upstairs on a counter or table tward the front.
---
Just run them on an alt and have a buddy help you transfer them.
---
I had this same problem on xbox i fixed it by closing the application and restarting the game.
---
Yet fo76 flatout requires purchasers to engage in a Sony subscription service, a considerable source of income for Sony.  I doubt that narrative.
---
Not sure about a flyer but for me just discovering the location of the park itself added a quest to investigate the park.  If you have already been to the park is the quest just turned off possibly?
---
:-)
---
Just go to the ash heap and it‚Äôll pop up
---
You always could, you just can‚Äôt make new ones... :(
---
So the Legendary Exchange system is intentionally designed like the money system in the old coal mining towns.  You earn scrip, but it's not much.  If you can scrimp and save all the scrip, you can turn it in to the Purveyor (aka the company store) and you'll get something.  Maybe something good, but probably nothing you want.  Try to sell that back to the system and it has instantly lost value.  All of your scrip that took a week to earn can disappear in ten minutes.  
---
You load sixteen scrips and what do you get?  Another day older and deeper and debt.
---
And a awesome camp spot it was. Was pissed when I got booted out.
---
dont forget 25% less vats cost.   That is the sought after 3rd for vats builds.
---
I would like to just have a fun fight in my private server kinda like a free for all
---
It's the game not your xbox trust me I play on an xbox one s. O and a heads up besides frame drops, lag, and crashes every now and then your xbox will just shut off but no worries "it just works" lol no but for real the only reason this game works is because of the awesome community which makes all the bugs and glitches worth it to me
---
I'm on PS4 Pro and have frame rate issues since the last patch
---
I tend to treat it like a slot machine, if I have the scrip, I go for the money shot (three star items)...and just like slot machines, come out a loser. Lol Maybe I'll try the two star method!!!
---
I have a blade of bastet lvl 25 u can have if your okay to wait till tomorow or the day after. I can up the level if you want too
---
Maybe it‚Äôs a really long elevator
---
Game crashes or she fly's away is bs
---
Something that i really enjoy is my "name- your- own -price thriftshop. Instead of trading through vendors i invite people to trade with me and request up to 5 items. They decide the price over which we  never discuss. 
---
The money i get is used for new stock. Also my other characters that do trade for profit contribute with excess junk, aid, armor and weapons. 
---
Have had great conversations, met Nice people, met  greedy people who took max advantage and met  generous  people who payd 100 times more then the value they took.
---
An example of the first institute teleportation experiments. Lol.
