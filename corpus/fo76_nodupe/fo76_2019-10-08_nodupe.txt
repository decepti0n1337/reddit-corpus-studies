Thanks!

Ah, makes sense. Guess I’ll be going back next time I play
---
[removed]
---
This has been happening ever since Bethesda claimed they “fixed” it in a patch. Ever since the patch that “fixed” melee hit detection it still happens, but it happens less frequently. 
---

---
Now since the last two patches it’s been happening even more frequently. I’ve also noticed a tremendous amount of lag spikes and server lag. Maybe the two are related. 
---
This game needs serious optimization. Any new player picking it up is going to notice the severe performance issues.
---
There was an update removing all power armor from your stash and inventory, separate from the chassis. The chassis should be in your stash. Apparently there was a bug causing massive issues and "Ghost" chassis so this was the only fix and caused us players a minor inconvenience. It should have placed you at a train Station to make it easy to restash your armor.
---
I don't understand the complaint here... it isn't "just" a flat damage bonus.  You're still literally firing two shots it's just that the second shot is only 1/4 as powerful.  If you fire at the side of a wall, or especially when using a TSE, you can still clearly see two impacts per shot.
---
Thats actually pretty smart. Raiding for flags is way easier.
---
You’re right, Travaro. Bethesda never fully fixed this melee hit detection issue. 
---
Just like when they claimed they patched the damage bug. It’s more rare, but it still happens.
---
Dont feed the yao gui
---
sure, but the person you whacked might not love it
---
Bloodied isnt OP.  If you have ever played it you would realize how stupid asking for a nerf to bloodied is.
---
Yes it does disgusting damage.  But at lvl 200+ radroaches are still scary, because they can also kill you before you realize they are there.
---
Big damage.   Dies from sneazing.
---
  
---
Based on your writeup, you have never tried it.  In conclusion, you dont understand the danger you put yourself in with the build, nor the skill and attention it takes to actually use it regularly.
---
listing a quest reward is not a spoiler
---
That is the right question.
---
These guys want to play hello kitty island adventure. :(
---
yeah, honestly I would settle for better uniques, as it is they are all obsoleted by any 2 or 3 star legendary
---
Factions, better and more PvP (eg: Structured optional factional pvp events such as CTF, TD etc could make everyone same level in these events to make it fair. Optional faction based zones where pvp always occurs regardless of levels these areas would need to be made to even out risk vs reward etc), more endgame content besides legendary farming, faction based settlements, more content and events and quests (gotta keep things fresh), text chat (not sure how you dont have that bethesda)
---
Beth stated from the get go that it was gonna be low key survival.  If you want Rust, go play Rust.
---
My friend briefly tried a melee build in NW but has set the game aside because he was so frustrated at how few of his within-range swings actually made contact.
---
can I have your stuff?
---
I just want them to buff flamers and fix the laser trip for camps please
---
welcome back
---
Or even faction flags so raiders cant raid raiders and bos cant raid bos idk sometimes simple is better
---
50% would still be way too powerful.  TS weapons retain their damage bonus against ALL enemy types and the only penalty is to their accuracy which can be mitigated with perks or vats.  Most other legendary effect out there may be stronger than the current TS effect but come with far more severe downsides.
---
You're right, I haven't played with bloodied. My apologies.
---
I still think that the damage is a bit much. I'm not asking for a drastic nerf, just not as much as is possible now. From my *limited* understanding, sentinel and cavaliers make it much more survivable, so this isn't always the case.  
---
And, it's just a suggestion. Simple as that.
---
damn, I'd buy that
---
Looked like a pipe pistol with 1 dmg
---
Your CAMP stays built if you stay. The ability to check camp location before your loaded to the world has been discussed greatly in this forum. What it boils down to is that the camp is loaded from your files once it logs you on a server.
---
I was simply pointing out how they could change survival to make it more like the other games. I'm not asking for it to be a survival game like rust. Just asking for it to be more of a challenge to play, like previous installments.
---
That’s actually a great idea and I agree!.... that ain’t happenin’.
---
It’s a shame they don’t have leopard print speedos. That would be the new impostor outfit for every gauntlet build.
---
There are rules to this game and everyone abides by them, correct? Now let me ask you this if you feel like the rules should be interpreted in a certain way does that change how the rules actually function? If you walk in a combined PvP and PvE zone for exp and die to a player whose fault is it? Tell me this what does a workshop have that you cant get somewhere else? you can get exp and junk anywhere...
---
It doesn’t matter if they wanted it they have consented to pvp its literally signing a contract. I kill people for materials and caps if you want to continue to feel like a workshop is a pve zone feel free I will keep killing you and taking your caps and materials. If you want to feel this is a coop game fine but can you engage in pvp ? So does that still mean its only a coop game?
---
Cool in not sure I'll be up for it today as I was trying to situate my weight currently, but I'll be around.
---
Why aren’t there legendary Scorchbeasts? I mean the Queen, but doesn’t it seem appropriate that there should be legendary Scorchbeasts if there are legendary ants and shit?
---
Bro making a new character would be stupid leave it as is you probably don't even PvP ans are over here suggesting thing
---
this.  It's a 1 time hassle but you should be able to reassemble your PA sets and stash them back at their old 10 lbs weight.  
---
You may also wind up with more PA parts than you left off with, as the old patch restored lost PA pieces/frames.  So if you have ascess you don't need just drop it in the world and maybe some other player will find a use for it.
---
Head due west to the angler-guarded disposal pit, there’s one there.
---
I think the problem lies in that Beth tried too hard to appeal to a mass audience rather than the diehard fans and screwed everything up in the process
---
Yeah, in a good game i do 4-6 terminals reveal enemies around 3-4 times. Would like xp to even out the time i could be killing or at lease an assisted kill for team while enemies r shown
---
Not sure about the .38. I know both the regular semi auto and auto prime receivers change the ammo from .45 to .44 as an fyi.
---
No, I don't PVP. In my opinion, I think that survival should be more like other games survival mode - not *just* about PVP. Make it more fun for all players, not just hardcore PVP fans. As it was, it was fun for PVP, but if you just wanted a challenge, it wasn't really there.
---
No worries, you are most welcome
---
While I like the deadlier enimies. The new character implementation is good for about two weeks tops. There is always someone who will play more than you and get better drops. 
---
And the bloodied build thing is pretty null my guy. The damage cap is 110 for everything PvP wise. 
---
Faster food and water drain? Ok. Just carry more food and water. 
---
Edit: missing words.
---
/r/iamverybadass
---
Are you on Xbox? If so I can build almost all the mods for most weapons, I can do yours for free if you provide the materials. Or I'm sure I have a decent cheap legendary gun for you :) Will be weds evening though.
---
There is also one similar to this on the pleasant valley athletic course that launches a ghoul at you.
---
Plans: High tech lights, dense xxx armor torso(4k caps), lawn flamingos 
---
unyielding shadowed buttressed dense deep pocketed armor, shielded marine wetsuits(rare i believe. 800 caps)
---
bloodied or junkies or instigating ranged weapons(screw everything else)
---
Bobbleheads and magazines
---
Rare plans are cool. Buy the small underarmor plans in the whitespring robot vendors and learn them straight away. Then in events the big shielded plans will drop as rewards.
---
I'm not necessarily talking about PVP, I'm talking more PVE. Damage cap at 110, to my understanding, is only for PVP, not PVE.
---
Did you guys all have an orgy or something cause you've all got crabs literally everywhere.
---
Yeah I read it over after the post and saw how someone could misinterpret it. It's been edited.
---
But what I hear you saying is bloodied needs a PvE nerf then?
---
What’s going on with spiked boards initiating PvP? How does it happen?
---
Not going to argue with that. :)  
---
Totally agree. Fallout was never really about PVP, but it can fit, if balanced and done right. Hopefully, Bethesda can take feedback and work in to make a game for a wider audience, while still catering to the diehard fans.
---
Been a bug since f03, perhaps earlier as well

Just for what is supposed to be a harder difficulty. Makes the enemies take more hits, makes them a bit more of a threat.  
---
I don't think bloodied needs to neutered, but I think it needs to be lowered so tanky enemies are, well, tanky.
---
No issues with xbox, unless the battery is dying
---
Thank you, I’m excited to catch up on what I missed :)
---
If I see a plan I don't know, you'd better believe I'm buying it regardless of the price.
---
Well, people are wanting to nuke him, feels pretty safe to say we will have a new Mayor..
---
....Mayor Garvey!
---
I have extra recipe if needes
---
Every once in a while my ambient sounds go 100% louder
---
What are the Grafton residency requirements for voting, though? It might be too late to register!
---
What are repair kits?
---
I’ll try this.. could be the fix we need. Guess I can put the case beside my bed out of the way
---
Laser musket
---
It was pretty nice of you to give it back! Nice job!
---
It was there just not exaggerated bro plus we that like PvP would use that so people in adventure mode wouldn't cry I just dont understand why y'all always trying to change things for others when you clearly don't like to PvP or whatever I get the harder aspect but why male it to y'alls choosing all the time
---
Repair kits come in two versions: Atomic shop Repair Kit and Improved Repair Kit. The atomic shop version is only bought with atoms, and the Improved Repair Kit is from Hard events like the Scorchbeast Queen fight. They repair weapons fully, and the Improved Repair Kit repairs to 150%.
---
You don't PVP yet you are suggesting a nerf to bloodied build components whatever they may be, weapons and all the low health perks? I'm bloodied and if I make a mistake I don't use more ammo and take a stim, I die fast then spawn back with health over 20% again and have to adjust my health back down. Bloodied builds are a job of work to maintain, it's not just *throw on power armor* and go murder some small animals.
---
What are you even thinking? Why no ask for the east side of the map to be made truly scary by a **major BUFF** to all the NPCs, animal and humaniod creatures, now that I could go along with. Real consequences for travelling to the bad lands.
---
Hold up. Why would a shotgun be meant for pistol users. Especially the worst shotgun in the gun
---
 I realized I basically missed the majority of the game by playing this way.
---
Why can’t I just repair my weapons and armor the normal way though?
---
I sell magazines for 10 caps. That's mostly a service to other players rather than an attempt to make money. Sometimes stimpaks. I have a "Sale" machine that sells 2 of each Serum I have for 250 caps. The machine next to it has many more for 350 caps and a note to check the sale machine lol. The marketing logic should be clear there. Everyone loves a sale. I have really good weapons for cheap but most people don't give them the time of day as they are searching for very specific ones. Then you'll get some guy come along and see them for the bargains they are and buy three...
---
Buy, on the other hand is easy to talk about. Pure Flux, Glowing blood, Ultracite and anything that's clearly under priced I will buy. I bought 150 antiseptic the other day just because they were crazy cheap. Ended up recycling a bunch to a robot vendor.
---
Because it takes effects from pistol perks. Not shotgun ones.
---
You can, press repair/modify and it will tell you what to press at the bottom of the screen. Repair kits are only an option, but they did a shady thing by putting the menu ahead of the normal repair feature.
---
I usually run solo but am always looking for cool women to kick ass with as well GT MinerThreatDC -- see you out there ladies and congrats on the SB ✌🏽
---
*The greater good*
---
But then that will affect the whole map, I'd say they should push up the strength of everything east on the map and leave low health perks weapons alone so low level players can try the build in western areas first.
---
Hmmmm yeah, definitely would be on par with previous survival in other fallout games. Like i said stronger enimies would be great. 
---
But I'm more on the buff side of things. Let's buff junkies, berserkers, mutants, nocturnal and what have you. That gives people more options to play with rather than the bloodied or the fire rate meta. Then add DR/ER, health pool, damage output of enimies in the survival mode to make them more deadly. Whichever adds a quicker TTK making the gameplay more tactical would be neat IMO.
---
1) I'm talking more PVE than PVP. My original post might not have made that clear.
---
2) Adjusting your health... Isn't that simply just standing in a spot of radiation? 
---
3) Not sure what not doing PVP has to do with suggesting a change to a build.  
---
I do think that a buff to the harder regions (in survival) wouldn't be a bad idea, at all.
---
I've helped out countless lower level players because... I dunno. Just seems like the right thing to do. I don't expect anything in return but it's great when they seem happy and excited. Emotes is all you need.
---
Do you have a mic?
---
Ok I thought I had to pay to repair for a second I’m just out of steel lol thanks for the help buddy
---
Hi just out of steel lol thanks for the help buddy, I'm dad.
---
Those places in The Forest area are Summerville and New Gad, good exp for lower levels. You can even find a 3 star legendary mutie in New Gad.
---
Found a way to fix it take any headwear off get in power armor then equip the helmet and exit power armor
---
I'm alright with that too. Other builds (that benefit from legendaries) would be great to see around. Most of what I saw in survival was automatics.. It'd be nice to see other things going around, for PVP and otherwise.
---
That's news to me. Where did you see that? I like to keep up to date.
---
PS4 here!  Matt-chew82
---
Someone actually did think they had to pay for repairs, and bought tons of kits all the time until they found out. It's not bad they added them, it's bad they pushed them up front.
---
If you have any more questions let me know!
---
If you are trying to say that people had to make their own fun, I agree. Bethesda screwed up so the players had to get creative in order to get some value for their money. Although, it really comes down to what kind of person you are. Can’t say I agree with the people that intentionally crash a server with 24 clueless people in it, just so they can dupe a million grenades...And I definitely don’t think this is the worst Fallout. It is just the one with the most bugs. Can’t really compare this game to any other Fallout.
---
I doubt theyll need to fudge them. What's more likely is that they set the goals at a level they always knew was achievable. They already know how many scorched we kill on over an average 2 week period. The top goal is likely set at only a little higher than that. The initial goal and all the other stretch goals were set deliberately low as motivation.
---
$13 gets you legendary horse armor!
---
Thank God somebody knows. You're the first to get it right.
---
Also, I'm pretty sure you were in supermutant infested Huntersville. The popup is a Perception window about looting a corpse (Walter? William?) in the intersection for a key I believe.
---
Fo4. Was that a question?
---
Well you can combine some of those but depends on your play style people like melee or bloodied junkie AA + sneak rifle or heavy PA
---
No
---
I mean I play the game with the mechanics that are in the game. If I’m able to steal work shops and take peoples loot then I’ll do it. It sucks when it happens to me but I don’t take it seriously because it is a game and that part keeps me playing because the damn story and quest line is dry af. But the social aspect and teaming up and running with squads against other squads is a lot of fun. I wouldn’t say I’m a greifer because there are many much better then I and playing since day one I have gone around the block once or twice so I guess you could say if I’m playing a raider that replaces the npcs from previous games then sure
---
W00t, glad to clear that up!
---
Hi able to steal work shops and take peoples loot then i’ll do it. it sucks when it happens to me but i don’t take it seriously because it is a game and that part keeps me playing because the damn story and quest line is dry af. but the social aspect and teaming up and running with squads against other squads is a lot of fun. i wouldn’t say , I'm dad.
---
Helvetia has a lot of space that could be renovated to have some NPCs take over the town. It would also be great to have them around to help celebrate Faschnat.
---
yeah, Summersville is one of the ones I was thinking of, didn't know about New Gad, the other one I was referencing is the lumber mill in the NW of the map, forget the name
---
I got locked in a load loop. Had to alt f4
---
I'm still searching for the quest that explains a basement scientist quickily putting something together to reverse time to before the bombs drop, but instead he accidentally caused the whole area of Appalachia to repeat the same 3 days after the bombs. It's been October 23-26 2077 for the past 25 years. Only people with mental functions higher than a Super Mutant can hold onto their memories and keep going while the rest keep resetting.
---
We'll see, they said private servers would be moddable, which means you kinda need access to them. I imagine it being something like Conan Exiles maybe?
---
Not really no, Nuclear Winter is fun but not worth buying the whole game if that’s all you want...it’s just a perk for those of us that like 76 and already play it
---
I don't think this game is for you :/ the only pvp is really in nuclear winter.
---
I don’t know what nuclear winter is
---
I’m currently melee, I want to keep my same character because I’m attached to her (lol), but I maybe want to be a heavy build or something with junkie...?
---
Not at all.  Literally any game with PvP is a better choice.
---
Sorry, it’s the Battle Royal mode in 76.
---
Hmmm Groundhog Day... I like it!
---
I think that actually makes it worse. The pistol perks are as good as the shotgun perks
---
Melee you can still combine with a junkie and bloody
---
They sent a rep to poison my water.
---
Damn I sorta like the post apocalyptic style open world thing. Oh well, thank you !
---
Participate in Grafton Day at least 25 times.
---
I mean sure. Until you also put in the weight reduction and movement speed pistol perks.
---
As you get close to learning all the plans, they stop dropping every completion.
---
There's 16 total plans, I have 2 characters that know all of them.  On each character the last 2-3 plans probably took maybe 12-15 completions on standard or expert to learn maybe a bit more.
---
My best advise to speed it up is nail down expert and then run it in addition to standard.
---
It works in real life too!
---
 Unless you really enjoy standing perfectly still and spamming a tesla rifle
---
The text box is related to Rose's quest. It's something to do with a body that's rigged with explosives and there's a PER check for you to notice it and GTFO before it explodes. So if you end up looting that body just have a care lol.
---
This is the appropriate response to all of the rage quit posts.
---
It’ll finally be tomorrow...
---
Yeah, you were seeing the automatics in survival because of the fire rate meta. The faster you can do that 110 damage the better chance you have of winning the engagement. Survival was more about the PvP aspect. 
---
It would be nice to see differentish meta than the legendary weps and armor being used. Seeing that buff mentioned above would be great for PvE. But PvP is another story. By making other weapons legendary weapons do more damage it's nullified by the damage cap. If you lower the cap even more then fire rate becomes even more valuable. If you raise the cap the damage becomes more valuable. It's about that sweet spot inbetween the two. This would require a boatload of nerfs and buffs to damage and fire rate across the board. 
---
But then we have legendary weapons and armor and perks. Which would also need to be balanced. While I would love to see it, as I thoroughly enjoy this game, I doubt there will be a day where there isn't a meta weapon(s) on the PvP side of things. There is too many variables.
---
it's not coming back...  too many of you misread their words, they want to improve PvP in adventure, not make a new server for it
---
I knew the plan apparently, it is definitely a decent match for the scout armor, thanks.  Now if they would just make the headlamp work.  Do it, Todd, do it!
---
I have had no luck of late. But I do agree
---
Thanks dad.
---
That one train tunnel near Harpers Ferry. Right now, all that’s there is radiation. They have endless possibilities to open that up. Remove the rad barrels, and make it a Raider/Freestates/BOS/Enclave hub.
---
Is there a PC group as well?
---
Same. I'm in Arizona do it's 6:12 currently. I work in construction so I'm not always able to play.
---
Guys, Guys, Guys!!!
---
Nuking Grafton should FREE THE MAYOR!!
---
A Giant Multi-Armed Mecha promising to stop trying to kill us if we'd just ignore the evidence it's inep and corrupt and vote for him anyway.
---
Just an idea.
---
bloatfly syringer, if you shoot a bloatfly it will spawn a bloatfly and so on for ever and ever
---
Oh please, the fiends weren’t any better than other raiders, what made them scary? That they raped and burned people? That’s like raider 101, they were nothing more than psychos that tried to emulate the borderlands ones, the raiders in fallout were literally having turf wars because of how large their empires got and the ones in 76 were giving 3 other factions a run for their money and indirectly caused the deaths of almost everyone in Appalachia, I find it crazy how you don’t think the mindless and dull drug addicts are the dumbed down raiders
---
Hey that’s not... oh, wait your right about the education system.
---
No one expects the Spanish Radscorp!
---
You hit the mark with that one, Buddy.
---
Yes! That's awesome. I haven't found any level 3 safes in the Toxic valley as of yet, but I can keep searching. Now I gotta figure out what I dont have yet.
---
what platform?
---
I see serums for 300-400c all the time on PC
---
Easy fix. Just re-equip them on the chassis.
---
Honestly, for the most part, that's me, too. I play on weekdays but it's just a little time here and there. Not the hours I can dedicate on weekends.
---
If you're on PC I'd be more than happy to help you through some of the quest areas. Just let me know (Friendlist adding can only be done from main menu right now but feel free to send a request)
---
Ah yes, now that makes sense why I haven't found pole hook or Chinese officer sword plans in the hundreds I've opened yet. Gonna triple check all the toxic valley safes, gotta have a level 3 somewhere there.
---
Ah man I wish. I'm on PS4. Maybe cross play soon
---
Ooh, that's unfortunate. Level 1 and 2 safes both have only a 3% chance to contain plans, as opposed to the 20% chance in level 3 safes.  If you find one you're missing from the Toxic Valley list, let me know and I'll see where else it might drop!
---
Its even better when you server hop to find events to run!
---
I'll dig around in the penetentary again. I think that's the only interior cell in the TV.
---
There’s a blunderbuss?
---
oh shit wait...
---
lol
---
There's either a terminal entry or Mr Handy dialogue as you leave it that says the vault was pre-programmed to lock from the inside and shut down completely once we all we left. There's probably a corporate override to open the door but not even the Overseer knew it and there's no one left at Vault-Tec to ask. 
---
We're only a control in that there was no experiment on us during our stay in the vault. Our experiment began once we left, though it probably wasn't planned that way. It's pretty clear that Vault-Tec was overly optimistic about what state the world would be left in after a nuclear war, but it's hard to blame them for that. 
---
Had it not been for Eckhart releasing the scorchbeasts, things would have been going fairly well in Appalachia,considering the circumstances. Had the scorched not become a problem the BoS would have finished wiping the super mutants out then likely have started in on the raiders. They had a comfortable truce with the Responders that only deteriorated because the BoS became desperate for supplies to fight the scorched and started simply taking them. The biggest remaining threat would have been the Enclave, at least with Eckhart leading it. Had Santiago's coup been successful before the scorchbeasts been released (and had they not tried to destroy MODUS as part of it) they likely would become allies instead of enemies.
---
Same on PS4
---
I've pretty much got my next few builds covered in terms of mutation needs
---
I used to have one but I gave it to a friend and I'm pretty sure they sold it. (I'm a heavy guns/tank build)
---
Yes
---
I really like the player vendors. Best way to find/trade good gear. Would never happen in a single player game. Sure the servers crash and I’ve lost weapons in the process. It’s the price we pay to play online... I also enjoy random encounters with griefers to be honest. It keeps me on my toes and lets me murder wanted players.
---
controller ... r u on console?
---
Nice try "again" Todd ;)
---
Personally would just be happy if we could trade them and they made them nonatomic shop related.
---
d'oh, if you were on PC, I could help you out.
---
Suppressor
---
Med scope
---
Stabilized long barrel 
---
Hardened receiver 
---
Forceful stock.
---
Shhh
---
I’ve seen them as low as 150 each. I buy them to resell, hell the robot vendors pay about 400 each. Even at 300-350 per, you still make 50-100 caps just for being a middleman.
---
LOL :D
---
Coolio, same time-zone. I'm in BC, Canada. I work in the restaurant industry, start at 3pm or 4pm most nights. So I'm usually on around noon.
---
That's so Negan
---
I used to sell mine for 200-250, but people would wipe out my inv. to resell to vendor bots for profit. I had to start bumping them up to 350 just to keep some in stock.
---
Just spam collect at a steam Luke everyone else.
---
Added a link this to my post too.
---
No? Ah well.
---
I built my camp well outside of Watoga, with a view of the city as well as Fissure Prime. I enjoy watching the fireworks from a comfortable distance.
---
Tell NO ONE
---
I know what you. There are benefits to the game being online based, but what I meant to for the future single player game would be to make features  for either if you are playing online or solo/co-op
---
Can we get a BoS outcast power armor skin? Or introduce spray paint so we can make our own custom skins?
---
Basically a sort of a private server for friends. (Posted too early)
---
The movement speed perk was the only one where i thought hey thats actually pretty good and then i remembered enforcer and that thought went away
---
Yea I know that but like a water pump would take that away. I mean its utterly useless in it's current state lol.
---
My primary lone wanderer weapon is an Instigating Explosive lever usually. Hardened receiver with the suppressor to get the max damage from the instigating effect while staying sneak
---
It would be problematic with people glitching/duping in solo &amp; co-op then going online. It prob has to be all one way or the other without a hybrid.
---
The gause gatling gun ❤️
---
I’m on Xbox. I’d love to be able to play during the weekdays after work, but I know I’d get drawn into it and not go to sleep
---
Yup. I feel iffy about bloody, it makes me anxious to always be at such low health lol
---
Lol yeah it would be cool if it did. I bet the forest scout mask looks better with the dark helmet, want to get that next. Glad to help hope u enjoy it like I do
---
While your up there I hear there is a soldier that needs to be buried.
---
It was very popular until Bethesda started nerfing it patch after patch
---
Alright thank you
---
Buy a Ps4 problem solved sorry if it's not the answer your looking for.
---
Well for me I have a torture room with and it is decorated with "happy" paintings , unicorn wallpaper a campfire in front of an electric chair,body parts,body parts, flamethrowers and rad emitters set to trap triggers ,and the main door is locked but if you really want in you can get in I make sure to entice people by having do not enter signs and go away and no trespassing just to that one room with the locked door, I am now up to 14 dead players that have all messaged with something along the lines of WTH that was cool or just laughing.   
---
Also out back is a giant checkers board with plushies to play with friends.
---
But to be a bit more serious, yes, looks like some Russian has been able to or have used some kind of tool to inject a item id when a container is being generated, not sure how it's don and don't really want to know.
---
I will love those weapons when they are actually released, but not stolen and made available in the game out of context :/ , that just ruins the fun...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Think this stuff is meant for Wastlander..
---
&gt;Raiders are just the Fallout equivalent of outlaws who follow their own codes outside the ones of "civilized" settlements that are modeled after pre-war society. 
---
I mean... that's simply not true in any Fallout, particularly not in the Beth games. There are groups who raid who aren't raiders per-say (like the Great Khans), but the typical FO3 raider is just a murder-hobo.
---
That is just the keyword cypher. If you want to launch without looking up the actual code you need all the pieces and then you need to decrypt them using that keyword cypher.
---
To be fair, explain the practical difference between that and a raider from FO3.
---
Ohhhh okay much needed thank you sir
---
Instigating 25% faster fire rate with 33% vats I believe. I put a hardened reciever with a silencer and green dot.
---
They sell to the vendor for 325 so I sell to players for 350 as an incentive to not sell to the vendor lol
---
Lord, yes. Imagine that - roleplaying in a roleplaying game.
---
Over-encumbered bloody build  is the real survival mode.
---
Seriously, why does the camo shotgun skin not apply to the combat SHOTGUN. FFS
---
Same issue here I built under a bridge and it’s somewhere in the wall.  I really don’t want to risk moving camp to relocate it I’m sure it will screw up everything.
---
It’s annoying because most of my camp is almost destroyed and you can’t repair until it’s gone.

Yeah it did... 9am pdt it was over.

This is not starting this week, right? I've already completed most of those challenges a while ago.
---
I don't remember fo3 too much honestly, it's been SO long since I played, only certain parts of it stick out to me now
---
My primary camp is strategically placed for great photos (it’s at the top of the highest peak in the savage divide). Your welcome to stop by if you’re on PS4!
---
Well the open world is amazing. It’s just not great if you want PVP. The battle royale is fun but I wouldn’t buy the game just for that.
---
Ok ty
---
Chassis disappeared my dear friend that’s the issue
---
Pistols have their own version of enforcer in either perception or strength. Also if you are using only pistols then weight reduction is amazing. I got a .44 down to less than a pound. Also the speed increase combined with speed demon is amazing.
---
Perks, decent modded armor and decent modded weapons will make this game much easier for you. After level 50 it becomes pretty darn easy in most areas. There is practically no consequence to dying. Team up with people also if you need help.
---
Grahm sells the chinese officer sword plan if you can find him.
---
you have to earn it in the game that is just a skin
---
Dont be sorry Todd :)
---
I like one of both. Well actually i carry three automatic handmades and one combat rifle at all times. One furious exploding prime, one bloody and one that can stay in vats forever. I use the combat rifle for stealthy kills and is bloody too.  
---
Kinda helps to use one type as your main and craft ammo for it and use the other to conserve ammo. .45 drop alot so i use it to shoot any i find and usually keep like 1;000 that way.
---
I SAID DONT TELL ANYONE!
---
Oppsss, hahaha
---
Have you done the tadpole quests yet?

I think you have an inflated sense of self worth and the fact you expected them to respond to your post is hilarious, sounds like your living in a fantasy land where your opinion actually matters, here in the real world no one gives a shit especially Bethesda.
---
I literally use it to just get rid of branches or trees I don't like in my area.
---
Conversely I generally wait until level 50 before proceeding with the story. Trying to maximize rewards. 
---
Of course my playstyle is reminiscent of what your complaining about. I would just grind eastern penitentiary and Grafton. Both locations have multiple events for xp and the pen is a trove of materials. I would end up selling the majorityof weapons and junk at either train station, Grafton or Morgantown. When in Morgantown, a quick swing through the airport for collision course and stimpac resupply. I used to level up 3 times a day doing this. Not WhiteSprings level xp but a lot less dying. 
---
At level 30 you should unlock a lot of powerful cards. You're almost there.
---
Lol not a bad reason to use it.
---
Those can also spawn as world items.  Here's the Mappalachia map of plans and recipes: https://i.imgur.com/BP1HWgG.jpg
---
Note that the region borders aren't always where they appear to be.  For instance, the weapon plan spawn near Grafton Station may or may not actually be part of The Forest.
---
I really love this idea and it’s good to see I’m not alone in loving the soundtracks (except for country roads which just does not fit at all). I keep listening the the songs over and over and I would love to hear a dj as well
---
Look into trying to get fixer. Its basically a black combat rifle with a extra legendary effect and higher damage. Legendaries are availble but pricy.
---
On the off chance the disc is haunted, removing it from your Xbox at night and storing it inside a salt circle should prevent the ghosts from *boo*ting it up a 3 am
---
Thank Mothman I have my Executioner's shovel on me!
---
Somone is salty. get a life man.
---
Apparently I've said something right
---
You mean 'silent' him?
---
Wastelanders is right around the corner? I think not.
---
Too true
---
I’d love to see some of the faction places set up as hubs for faction dailies and traders that are set with faction specific items and plans would make the game a lot more fun having stuff to do
---
Just north of Cobbleton Farm. West end of Toxic Valley. Travel to the farm (check for a bobblehead on the barn roof) and head downhill through the crops. You'll come to a plateau of sorts that ends in a point. Look east and you will see the entire Toxic Valley. Great view including:
---
The workshop
---
The dinosaur
---
The space station could be hard to see.  It should be lined  up with one of the high voltage power line towers. Scope in or binos for a better look. Gots ta keep an eye out for dem Wastelanders...
---
Bonus if you put a chair on the point facing east.  Launch a nuke into the Valley.  FT back, sit in chair, take a sequence of shots with the inbound missle and various stages of mushroom cloud.  Kind of a "Miller Time" picture if you're old enough to understand the reference.
---
The valley's liquids also turn a glowing orange at night giving a great contrast to the night time ground.  Think blurred headlights on a busy road at night.
---
I'd show the pics, but Patch 11 ate them...I'm still bitter.
---
Inoculation, vaccination, and immunization recipes would be helpful. Make then expensive like serums (not as expensive). The shots could last like 48 hours or something. Diseases are so annoying.
---
I recommend Archer, Hunter and Mamalogist or Swimming
---
Good odea
---
yeah, i fee those skin's should have worked on the new small backpack that is easy to get, but they don't, you need the real backpack from  the Tadpole quest..
---
That's a super nice find. 👍
---
I see garbage legendaries still selling when priced 20-25 caps per scrip.  I think you can raise those prices and still get sales.
---
I love it I can 1 shot most enemies
---
I don’t care about updates tod just make him shut up
---
A person that play runescape is a person of culture.
---
I have a 1* instigating myself and love it. I'd sell my deathclaw for yours though. 🤣
---
Play whatever is the most fun for you. You'll enjoy the game more, and you'll play longer.
---
My main started as a stealth VATS build, changed to a bloodied sniper, then a bloodied rifleman, and now a utilitarian rifleman/commando depending on what I feel like running.
---
I also have a heavy alt, full commando, and a weenie pistol build.
---
I too know this feeling.
---
athlete is easier than hunter
---
I play PC and xbox on fallout, never have this problems anymore.
---
Even if you have good fiber and a good known ISP with a good router, do long ping test, DNS test or other good testes you can find, you might get surprised,,
---
You might have small drops, and fallout 76 doesn't like them much :(
---
&gt; The game itself identifies Raiders as being "Blood thirsty Psychopaths" who preyed on anyone weaker than them. Raiding caravans where they stole what they could and you KNOW they didn't just send everyone home crying. No, they killed everyone! The people that are trying to rebuild society get slaughtered by the Raiders and we think it's cool to emulate that? 
---
This is just revisionist history.
---
Yes, there are some examples of raiders that entirely fit the way you characterise them. However, there are also Raiders that are more akin to highwaymen, thieves, thugs who aren't necessarily interested in killing everyone. This is as plain as day if you follow through Rose's quest line. 
---
Don't try and justify griefing as a lore thing. If you're going to be a griefer, just own it. Don't hide behind raiders because, as the game shows, not all raiders are bloodthirsty murderers.
---
Curses! I'm only level 15 and still learning a lot. I didn't realize it was a reskin of a quest item :(
---
F that we need the Ultracite jet pack
---
Its literally the same code and same engine dumbass
---
In the beginning of my first and only character, I was a random build ig, I just used anything handed to me (mostly rifles and pistols) and then I started discovering how advanced other players were, and ofc I want to be like that so I moved onto melee (which I love). I’ve especially thrived with it cause I knew I wouldn’t do well (personally) at higher level places without it. But now, I’m still melee...but I’m getting more interested in PVP and I’ve been asked to be in a big fight so I don’t think melee will work out that well lol. I also dread the idea of making another character.
---
SBC drop I think
---
Correct and another fall damage piece would make you immune without goat legs
---
Goat legs should be 50/100
---
I’ve always sought dual fall damage reduction pieces for my gear, with no luck :/
---
Oh yeah? how's this for possible Lore...
---
from the wiki on the Enclave:
---
*"The* ***Enclave*** *used* ***Project Safehouse*** *and the* ***Vault-Tec Industries*** *network of underground shelters for a grand social experiment, to test the occupants in unique circumstances.  Vault monitoring and research was conducted under the* ***Vault Behavioral Project****. In order to monitor the populations being experimented upon, the Enclave's oil rig possessed a great deal of equipment that allowed them to observe and control the vaults. For example, the Enclave sent the all clear signal to Vault 8 shortly after the War, prompting them to leave their vault and build their city. These monitoring tools also let the Enclave see that the population of Vault 13 was largely intact, although this wouldn't become important until much later. "*
---
What if....WHAT IF we weren't exactly just chosen from the best and brightest to leave the vaults in 25 years to "reclaim ~~the wasteland~~ America" or whatever. What if we were chosen from the best and brightest because that's the type of people the Enclave would want joining them once they established a hold of the wa...America...after the bombs dropped.
---
We were groomed to know that the vault would be opening up on "Reclamation Day". We lived our lives, had children, taught them to be just as good as us, stayed healthy. The Overseer was told that every life inside this vault is important. No casualties. Keep us working together, but also competing against each other (to breed future leaders and officers for the Enclave). We expected everything to just be okay. Perhaps we simply weren't told that the whole plan was for the Enclave to recruit us once we're out. The Overseer had a secret mission to reclaim the 3 Silos (the ones that Enclave would want control of).
---
The Appalachian "branch" of the Enclave was actually recruiting people from Appalachia to fill their ranks (even Responders, with some brainwashing) to keep their numbers up while waiting us But they kind of hit a snag with the whole "president" Eckhart thing. That probably wasn't part of the plan, which eventually lead to the release of the Scorchbeasts, and the damage to MODUS which lead to the death of every Enclave member present (most if not all of them).
---
Here we come along, right on schedule, to find that the Enclave is kind of no more, but are recruited instead by MODUS to continue the plan (his programming is kind of messed up because of the damage you can see in his server room)...and we basically revive the Enclave with us eventually become a General. We will eventually fulfill the wishes of the Enclave to get control of those silos. Sure, we'll use it to bomb the scorchbeasts because phat lewtz, but eventually...
---
What if we collectively become the ancestors of the Enclave in Fallout 3 (150ish years later)? At least some of us. Some of might go on to rebuild the Appalachian branch of the Brotherhood. Some us might end up as Responders, taking care of the new Wastelanders coming back soon.
---
Here's a shower thought. What is your character? Were they from pre-vault, or one of the Vault Babies? Were they military, tech, teachers, engineers, etc? Were they one of the world's best cooks picked to give the best food to the best vault people? Were they not one of the chosen, but are you part of the security team? (the vault was made uninhabitable within 24 hours, so these guys were released with us). Maintenance? How old are you? I mean, technically, if we weren't born in the vault, we're older than 40-50. Those chosen for Vault 76 were " all were highly accomplished before the war". They'd have to be at least in their 30s, right? I mean, unless these "best and brightest" were chosen right out of high school, how many are seniors citizens when they left? 
---
Another scorchbeast? I'm getting too old for this @\^\*%...
---
(sidenote: Vault 76 had 500 occupants. That's probably how many players are left...)
---
Exactly how I make my money. Buy for 175 to 200, sell for 350 in my vendor. Sell whatever is left to the robots for 423 per. Don't mind taking a hit on profit as we are capped per day from robot sales.
---
You will get there 💪🏽
---
That's fair.
---
'Raiders' vary from game to game. In New Vegas they can be distinct factions (Power Gangers, Great Khans, etc), but in FO3 they're just... mobs. Like robots, stray dogs or any other no-background mob.
---
Thanks mate
---
I know, think it's stated in the picture, probably with small lettering, lol
---
If you are lv15 you should be able to do it, but try to get you the camera first, you can start that quest on you personal computer in your camp now, think it's called "find a supisus person" or something close to that.
---
when you get to "swimmer" and need someone to revive in water send a msg, i am on both xbox and pc ;)
---
 Archer , Swimming and  athlete is easy..
---
The pipboy issue happens to me when I open it before the world has a chance to fully load in. I've never dealt with loading screens that long and haven't had a DC in months.

Can you explain what a food build is?

We are now in the second week of the challenge
---
It did wow
---
I rocked that for a few days 😂
---
I don’t see it on fallout gamepidia
---
Good call :)
---
Mole miner gauntlet plans at any price are likely there just to make it look like the shop has more plans when viewed from the map.
---
That happens outside of the raid too, maybe you just got unlucky with the usual bug. Thanks for trying!
---
I could be wrong
---
Ah makes sense. I remember new Vegas having those factions and coming across powder gangers for the first time and them hating me because I didn't wear their clothes or something like that. I've been wanting to go back to play fo3, but it's just.. fallout has sprint now and just walking everywhere was a drag and slow.
---
It means, specifically, that your way of playing is to MAKE OTHER PEOPLES GAMEPLAY LESS ENJOYABLE. WHICH MAKES YOU A PIECE OF SHIT. How the fuck do you not get such a simple concepts, how the fuck were you not raised right?!?
---
Ima leave all the doors open now. Ima go and open doors that dont even need opening just so i can leave them open too. Yw
---
Does it affect your team as well?
---
Thanks for trying!
---
It has been delayed until early next year due to wastelanders being the teams main focus at the moment
---
itll be here eventually they just delayed it again
---
I really really want to go give this game a chance but I can't because it won't let me
---
I honestly had hoped survival was like a hardcore mode start at level one and when you die that is that, and you drop everything on your person.
---
Did todd or fallout devs actually try to blend into reddit to find out how they were being hacked?
---
Beyond that we're totally done here and you're getting the block. I don't need to keep entertaining and asshole, especially one who doesn't understand basic social niceties.
---
Who knows ima going to do some digging to see if it exists
---
Could you imagine a furious chainsaw?
---
Pity but expected. thanks for testing!
---
Let me know what you find
---
I'll try a hot spot tether
---
Damn you been selling dense for 4k here I am being stupid sell those just at labeled cost.
---
Oh damn, I’ll probably have to just start a new character.
---
Ya not there https://s2tp.co/fallout-76-list-of-every-plan-in-the-game/

[Saved for future reference] Thank you so much. Checklists like this make everything so much easier. I wish more information about this game was out there, but this is a huge step.

It is a good cap farm, as the bloatflies can drop glowing meat, which, when cooked, is quite profitable.

---
I heard someone say this is the companion feature showing up early from waste landers. But I don’t know for sure.
---
Plans mostly as I farm a lot and tend to get rarer plans or spare weapon plans. Normal plans I sell for 10% of their labeled cost so 10-35 for camp (small letters I sell for 250 though) and 23-50c for armor mod plans. Straight weapon and armor plans I sell for higher or if i know the market bears a higher price on X plan. I also bought a ton of plans from grahm marquees, metal picnic, rad emitters so on and have had success selling them for 1k each I still have 15-20 of each and started with around 50.  
---
I also have 1 machine 30/30 devoted to selling combat armor helms for 100 caps each since they can be a pain to find.
---
I do what ju pay
---
And atom shop skins
---
mostly plans more than anything. But hard to get rid of most of them now as most people have alot of them. dropped most of my plans to 10-50 caps just to get rid of the damned things. i don't wanna just drop them just in case i have something some poor bugger has been looking for that i just happen to have.
---
I buy .308, fusion cells, and fuel all the time. I really should sell my .45 and 5.56. I have so much and use neither.
---
It is out damages the combat rifle and handmade.  It is not just combat rifle, there is a reason it is in demand.
---
I mean. A giant robot that got it's data currupted and now trys to scrap people still could exist in game
---
Recipes for 350? That's crazy. I can see some price less than the minimum Enclave price, but 350 is lower than you'll ever find from me.
---
At least it didn’t completely delete itself from your console like it did to me
---
Or power armor skins
---
Fast travel was one of the things that made survival silly, because people camped at train stations and knew the specific spawn spots. That and a cursor on your head. 
---
New characters are a must.
---
I'm not exactly high level. Hell, I'm basement but I do a lot of exploring and yeah I'm in a lower level area (I think).
---
I sell more ammo than anything but people love my 5c stimpaks!
---
I head canoned  that the two shot is really just a misfired round and that is why it is less powerful and can go wide otherwise I would be sad too.
---
The thing with 44 is that you can find a decent amount of it on your  own and don't need to use too much of it even when using one. Its not a weapon you really burn through ammo wise. I've generally kept 300-450 just with what I find, and if I have extra lead and and making ammo I'll go ahead and make just a couple of more batches because why not.
---
Nice. Anyone have one for armor plans?
---
The purveyor gave me a level 45 instigating explosive -25 VATS AP cost, which I modded with: 
---
* Hardened Receiver
---
* Aligned Long Barrel
---
* Aligned Stock
---
* Glow Sights and 
---
* Suppressor
---
I don't know if that's the best set of mods or even if I have them all unlocked, but it works wonders as a mid-range VATS sniper rifle.
---
The town is Huntersville, and the quest is to retrieve a "key fragment" from a dead Raider group leader. 
---
His corpse is at the crossroads, and if your Perception is high enough, you'll get a text message as you approach the body . . .
---
I generally don't post spoilers, but you may want to exercise some caution when you attempt to search him  🤔
---
Pics please!
---
100% yeah it should, tired of trading in solid Legendaries and getting Single Action Revolvers for the same Scrip price on trade!
---
Keep looking because having teammates follow you off cliffs to their death is hilarious !
---
Exactly, 1 or 2 more at the least
---
Same!
---
are you using the “quick boot” feature? if so, use the power conservation mode. it will take longer to boot but perhaps it will help.
---
I will say this.  I switch between of Bloodied PA heavy weapon and Bloodied unarmed(no PA). The switch is pretty easy for me. My special seems to be an exact fit
---
What I’m saying is don’t get bogged down with one build to rule them all.  I took a slow progression into unarmed. Eventually thinking my unarmed was better than heavy.  Then I got a God roll .50 cal machine gun. Luckily my builds I can switch In and out quick.  So I use both builds depending on situation. 
---
The armors come slowly. Unless you have 30k caps on deck.(even that’s not enough sometimes, my armor set id sell for 50k, it’s so nice for what I need.)It’s hard to get the exact armors you want right away.  It took me many hours and many upgrades.  It’s a process.  But that makes it more fun in the end.
---
You just gotta be patient and wait for the plans to drop  😀
---
nope
---
This term was started by one of the YouTubers, basically it meant any build that’s not optimised for combat and including a lot of carry weight/utility perks.
---
Agreed. This isn't  cod this is fallout. It's all about the random occasional wackiness
---
Nice, thanks!
---
Of you open task Manager (Control-Shift-Escape) you can click on the performance tab.  
---
Once there, right click and select GPU and GPU Engine.  
---
Load the game fully and see which GPU you show it running one.  
---
Once done open Device Manager, scroll down to "Display Adapters" and see what is listed.
---
So as in, they are food for PvP orientated players?

Wait, how have I not heard of this? so by prestige...you mean, we’re going to be able to keep everything we have but just reset our level? Like a New Game+?! I’ve been wanting to nuke my Perk build for months, this is perfect!
---
You never know
---
I do run into this problem from time to time. I just keep hopping till I find one. Unless im joining a friend, then I use their house.
---
They should auto close if left open for over two minutes or so
---
Maybe i don’t know i didn’t made this term
---
I think you can get that as a skin if you play NW. I believe I got one.
---
Funny. I got em for 350 and never sold one
---
I’ve thought the game was fun even without the npc’s! Gets a lot of hate but hey to each their own. There’s still a lot of people playing and a lot to do especially for a new player. If it won’t hurt your pocket i would definitely recommend givin it a try
---
Pfft, please... Not only will I leave the door open, I'm gonna take your crops and shoot your Brahmin. I might even lead some nasty critters to your place to do some damage.
---
Your base in the video is awesome no doubt, but that pic of your engine just strikes me - that’s really good stuff. Putting the plushies in the power lines is just freaking awesome
---
That universe must not have developed it. You might ask over in r/falloutlore.
---
I heard there are a ton of roleplay communities for this game? No idea how that works though... any ideas?
---
You mean in the supports? The power lines are only in the upper section for the giant lamp
---
What about granade spawns?
---
Why do they refuse to give bug grenade plans?
---
Thank you!
---
There is no ultracite jet pack what about that
---
I just looked up photos. That thing is huge lol.
---
Ohhhh yah that makes a lot of sense. I couldn't find anything on it doing searches and it's been so long since I played the other FOs that it didn't look familiar. Thanks friend :D
---
Yup meant supports, not power lines.
---
All the cool kids are setting up a seperate vendor that says "scrip" and just putting cheap legendaries in it for people to buy just to recycle.
---
It works great, you get some caps and don't have to be overencumbered, and they get that last item to max out their scrip for the day.
---
Goatlegs is 80% less fall damage when its maxes so you need the piece of armor also
---
really nice post with some interesting ideas!
---
bullet spongey enemies i'm not so sure about; i prefer the survival dmg from fo4 (u hit harder, but so do the enemies).  this would also need resources to be more scarce 
---
more diseases, more cures, more recipes, yes please!  + aforementioned scarcity, makes cooking/crafting that antibiotic or herbal tea much more *survival.*  add'ly, having to compete for resources (if there was only one workshop that produced the cure for \[disease affecting some/all?\]) there might be more conflict.  the fallout crowd seems to be more man vs. nature than man vs man, so hopefully beth will incorporate more actual surviving.  instead of, as you say, the pvp being the focus.  these raider types forget that you can't raid if you're starving
---
itd be super cool if they did survival by seasons (and characters in survival live for that season) w/ some vague objective/benchmarks as seasonal goals and rewards.  in dead rising, ur character had to hunt down a dose of zombrex every day or game over.  likewise in eso, they have "campaigns" in which the different factions vie for control of cyrodiil, (hell you can even be crowned emperor).  iirc they are 7day, 30day, &amp; 6 month campaigns.
---
as for perks/loadouts, like if there were only a few perks/specials and no legendaries in this new survival mode.  very little "magic under the hood" that will make weird firefights where someone with a pointy glove eviscerates a power armored rocket launcher dude.  likewise, i'll have to disagree on the legendaries and/or mutations as i feel they pull away from that survival concept and trends towards the power fantasy.
---
nevertheless, i enjoyed sharing my ideas and look forward to any feedback or opinions you have to offer.
---
Yeah it looks sick haha.
---
Don't let this distract you from the fact that the curator at Prickett's Fort excavated a civil war soldier's remains. He's asked that you give the body a burial in Philippi Battlefield Cemetery.
---
It really does but it’ll be hard to pass off as a auto-rifle 😂
---
I'm in hell.
---
Come on you know you want that level 5 10 mm pistol for 37 caps.
---
Oooh and some NCR stuff! I love the two headed bear flag.
---
Not too rare, I see lots for sale in vendors, I got about 5 of them during this last week of bbq, you won’t make a lot on it, usually see them around 500 caps
---
Wait? Fertile Soil 2: Revenge of the Supervisors!
---
These are cool. I got the clear green one.
---
Yeah most big guns have a very rapid fire rate though, this one has been semi-auto in the past. It's size is due to it's industrial use for melting cars pre-War and it's trade off was being less accurate than a Plasma Rifle in NV I believe.
---
Was Grahm a dream....?  And Chally?  No!  Chally's real, and she's lives in the hearts of our dreams and memories and.... (gas released) nnnn....y mi tia....murmurgh....
---
Never seen one and I was surprised this didn’t end with, and they I died when he blew up while I was looting him.
---
The main reason I only build CAMPs near water streams or lakes...
---
I think there can be anti-cheat systems, but perhaps they can be less annoying to players that aren't cheating?
---
How do I get the personal computer? Lol I would love someone to play with. Haven't convinced my buddies that it's worth getting yet!
---
Add ultracite jet pack
---
With hard bargin, grape mentats, a beer, etc they sell for 500 each
---
I really loved the glow in the dark ground we had for a while. I know it was wrong but it was pretty lol
---
Yea and I got a spot with a junk extractor and a lead spot no water near me tho that isn't toxic. Water pump rework needs to be done lol
---
New Gad is located SW of Summersville, actually they're really close to each other, you can get a decent chunk of exp clearing these two areas while being low level. By any chance the lumber mill you're talking about is the one called WV Lumber Co.?
---
Yeah but swimming requires you to "revive someone in water" so maybe archer, hunter, athlete.
---
for 30 cad you cant really go wrong. if you like the game then thats great, you got a pretty good deal. And if you dont like it 30 bucks isnt that much (and if its a physical copy you can always sell it)
---
I actually prefer my doors be open
---
He did explode afterward, thankfully I've died that way enough to know that I need to loot &amp; scoot on Leg* bots
---
What piece do you have? 1000K caps? I'll trade with you as well. I only have 1K left
---
Thanks man I've been hoping I'd find a list like this so I can make sure my collection of plans is complete
---
They should  make these guys drop legendary Tenderizers.
---
Crabs have been around for a while now.... some lotion should sort it out
---
I have had one in my vending machine for a while at 500 caps but no sale...
---
why did my mind immediately go to "herbivore mutation" ... or maybe more appropriately, "Bovine mutation".
---
don't talk heresy!! LOL
---
I miss the old main screen music prior to Nuclear Winter
---
I bought the marsupial serum from someone for 450ish caps and I am eternally grateful. I had been trying to get it again after I got level two starched genes.
---
YEs. It is a pain in the ass to use it and needs fixing.
---
I know every time I try I feel broken, but some people are doing them regularly so they can't be that bad?
---
^.^
---
My Instigating one has the following mods, some based on Captainoob's advice. He knows his stuff and demonstrates the advantages on his channel. 
---
* True Long Barrel (hip-fire for VATS)
---
* True Stock (hip-fire for VATS)
---
* Glow Sights (for VATS - reduces cost)
---
Unlike the Grafton Mayor, at least we don’t have to worry about Sanjay coming back in Wastelanders since he was killed by the scorched.
---
I dont think the issue is with bloodied i think its more of a lack of unusable builds
---
I fell for the sake and spent all my legendary points to get weapons and armor that I will never even use.   I put them into my stash because it sucks to put them right back in the legendary machine and get less than half my return.  Next time Bethesda advertises a legendary sale, I know not to trust them.  Fuck!!!
---
I am exactly where you are
---
What platform do you play on?
---
I would love someone to play with as well.
---
This is one of the reasons I keep my legendary anti armor shovel with me at all times.
---
Or a mankini. 😁
---
Lol rip.
---
No, they said "every 50 levels you get to add a legendary perk to one special attribute" I'm guessing they are just adding new cards that you get every 50 levels.
---
You have to build it in your camp. I don't remember what tab it's under, but I would look around until you see a tall blue/gray(?) looking terminal. Once you build it, you can check for quests on there.
---
My favorite build would best be known as a tactician, mid-high INT, mid STR, mid-high END and AGL and mid CHA with a smidge of luck. This opens up a couple paths for how you want to play
---
It'll be worth more in a month presuming we don't have another Meat Week.
---
A higher level player was there before you.
---
You are awesome.  Many thanks
---
At over 1000 hours in I guess I have to say it's worth $30 lol
---
So the first person to visit an area spawns the enemies? Do they ever deshawn unless killed?
---
I’ve never decrypted a nuke before honestly, I just google what the code is
---
maybe you haven't seen my more recent content then
---
Yes, you can get a jump start by killing all the fireflies in the area before the event even begins
---
I literally only complain when it costs money. I wish Beth would add every Fo4 outfit in 76, but as free quest/challenge rewards not for additional money. Is that really that unreasonable?
---
The Overseer in the trailer just said "It's been some time". Bethesda is calling it Year Two, so I'm going on the assumption that it's only been about a year since Vault 76 opened. 
---
It makes sense, really. They want to preserve the old main quest while introducing the new one, so a lot of areas won't have significant changes. Which would mean humans would have had only a little time to start rebuilding before the story of Wastelanders begins...
---
What is the invalid part?
---
I don’t have a mic anymore gotta get a new one, but I love helping out new players, add me and I’ll help as best I can when I’m on, I’m western US time and typically play on weekends or late once I’m off work around 1:00am
---
Deadweightboy
---
Happy trails
---
I really wish we could trade and sell our perk cards
---
coz they don't know how to kill bugs?
---
ba dum tss
---
You have to be careful with berserker build. I sneak around and usually one shot easier enemies, however scorch beasts do take anything from 6 shots to 20 shots, depending on sneak bonus and adrenaline boost. It's harder to level up, you give up on many bonuses from armour and under armour and your best buddy is a hazmat suit.
---
I think there's a timed component to that question, but I'm unsure what it is.
---
Like lets say a lvl 10 is at whitesprings then a lvl 100 travles there at the same time. Everything for the vet will be to that lvl 10's lvl enemy wise.
---
Then let's hope someone answers lol
---
I think this is the best vats sniper lever! Nice!
---
That's kinda an awful system
---
Although I could see it being that way to prevent boosting
---
Thank you for making your videos, they have been very helpful!
---
100caps are nothing though... you get 200 from doing 1 queen via silo run
---
Tell me about it... Got the freebie small back pack. Thre black shovel skin won't work... 4 hours later and a lot of cursing, have regular back pack with the skin. Good motivator to just do it already.
---
I try to delay leaving the server if I have a customer.  Usually.   But yes, very annoying.
---
Lol it’s something when it’s literally over nothing....im just tired of spawning into camps that aren’t there
---
I really like the set with the 3 pack. But I also got the pink pegicorn one.
---
Engine can probably handle it, was done with mods in New Vegas even power armor with different vision modes.
---
Do it.
---
Not true. NW is the reason survival was ended. Bethesda put a lot into making NW but it has been dying fast, with queue times becoming outrageously long. Last month they merged the regional servers into one global server. A lot more lag, but you can actually get a 50 person match now. But that wasn't enough, they axed survival mode to try to push more people into NW but personally I don't like it and I want better workshop pvp. Just add a timer before you can start attacking an owned workshop so the defender doesn't get instant claim ambushed.
---
Yeah it’s annoying. Not really an issue though as I literally go around to vendors to try to get rid of caps. I’m happy to see them leave 😂 means I can turn MY vendors back on hahaha
---
I have 2 pieces of amror that got 50% no fall damage. I can jump from any height and not get any damage.
---
Damn, wish I had that problem...too many caps? Lmao come visit my camp! I spend too much.
---
Do this. Rename corpse as Grafton Mayor. Satisfy petty life.
---
Sadly not much they can do about it. Not like the game can tell when someone about to leave, crash, or disconnect lol
---
I'm very much looking forward to the gauss weapons, hope they take 2mmEC so I have a reason to burn off my stock of the stuff
---
They fixed that pretty quickly after release. You wont lose your character now
---
Although, have you not came across camps that won’t let you travel to them? Or is that just my game lagging? I’ve witnessed it a few times and I just assumed they built in a buffer system....when that happens, within 30 seconds that particular camp is gone off the map
---
I was in a similar situation not long ago.  Whay helped me was to search YouTube for "Fallout 76 X Patch" and replace X with the numbers for every patch since I played last.
---
I see it the opposite way. I want NW to die so survival mode can get fixed. There simply is not a big enough fallout pvp community to support 50 man matches without absurd queue times. I don't want the old survival back, I want something different.
---
If there is an experiment involved with Vault 76, I'd say it's on the Overseer herself. She alone was given the task to not only herd a group of hyper-competitive geniuses through the post-apocalypse, but to secure Appalachia's heavily guarded nuclear silos for Vault-Tec. She herself says they would have had to know she couldn't do it alone...
---
Convincing us, the residents of 76 to work together and use the bombs responsibly is a monumental task for one person. Regardless, we drop them wherever we feel like anyway. And the Overseer feels used by Vault-Tec because of it. 
---
It's pretty clear they had ulterior motives for 76, but since the Overseer was their test subject, they couldn't keep any record of it within the vault...
---
You happen to know what number the patch was that added the backpacks? Lol
---
I am still salty that we can't learn to craft wood armor, or raider armor, or scout armor, or most of the outfits and accessories in the game. 
---
It just makes no sense at all that i can whip up a full suit of T-60 power armor from scratch in my shitty little dirt patch of a compound but i am somehow incapable of learning how to make a pretty dress, or strap some bark on my titties.
---
Does that include wrp9ns and armor?
---
Nope, I have had where it shows no camp owner name and no items either
---
Any of these guys on PC? I'm trying to not pay 17k caps for serum recipes
---
Maybe I’m just lagging, wouldn’t surprise me. Giving Beth too much credit on that one lmao
---
Yeah Beth said its totally fixed as far as the game breaking bullshit goes. No losing characters or gear. 
---
Also supposedly in order to lose your character before you had to keep dashboarding or altf4-ing at a specific point in the raid and had to do it several times. So I guess it isnt most people would have encountered anyways. This is what I heard from around the sub so dont quote me on it
---
Suppressor, true long barrel, dot sight, hardened receiver, and whichever stock gives bash damage bonus. I don't use it for the bash damage but it makes durability much higher.
---
If you laid out all the rules for adventure mode and survival mode at my feet and told me where to assign them. I damn sure wouldn't put "weekly weapon challenges" or "global 20% exp bonus" in survival mode. 
---
I find it baffling that "adventure" mode gives less exp for questing and more caps for pvping than in survival mode.  It simply doesn't mesh. Let the survival servers be entirely pvp oriented and the adventure servers be for adventuring.
---
This is 100% the reason my camp is always near water. If the pump gave us dirty water just as quickly I'd be able to build in so many more locations
---
Yeah it's annoying but I only go to vendors if they have a lot of stuff and are of higher level (or really really low and near the vault or whitespring because those are usually alts). Since I dont go to as many I guess this doesnt happen as often to me.
---
Also imo if I'm gonna get upset over the lost 100 to 200 caps, I prob didnt have enough to be spending at a vendor to begin with.
---
Who is Preston Garvey??
---
I just hate wasting caps on general...maybe I’m a cheap skate....I spend a lot so caps are crucial
---
&gt;I am still salty that we can't learn to craft wood armor, or **raider armor**, or scout armor, or most of the outfits and accessories in the game.
---
Uhm, we can craft raider armor.
---
I usually look around and see what level they are. Also how many plans they're selling. It would be cooooooooool if we could see legendary items either by total stars, or as a separate category
---
No one cares
---
at least separate clothes and armor for Todd's sake.
---
auction house when
---
Definitely needs to be done
---
Yea exactly I mean shit itd make more since if the water pump was more efficient then walking up to a damn stream and going SQUARE SQUARE SQUARE over and over.
---
raider themed paintings would be a good idea, also throw in todd howard's portrait and knife objects to put over the faces of the paintings
---
I stand corrected, i have never seen raider armor plans before but i looked it up on the wiki and son of a bitch they do actually exist. 
---
Still salty about the other stuff though.
---
Not much game changing stuff has happened. If you had good gear then, it's still just as good now. They *balanced* some drop tables and stuff since then I think. 
---
They added raids which I actually haven't done as the rewards are mostly power armour related and non tradable. 
---
They made some changes to the fortnite game mode. Removed survival this past week so now all the asshats from there are in adventure...just remember to keep pacifist on and dont claim workshops if you aren't ready to fight a stealth boy tesla.
---
Most of the additions to the game have been to the atomic shop unfortunately.
---
Idk if this was before or after your time but you can scrap legendary gear into script at train stations and use the script to get other random legendary gear. 
---
Player vending. Cant think of much else
---
Go educate yourself and learn to read lmao. And while at it, learn to develop human social communication skill. 
---
Nobody was arguing about how the game needs balancing. It's about how not everything is supposed to be turned into overpowerd broken fucks. Which is the exact same point you're trying to make but somehow you felt the need to add the vitriol.
---
i miss when the wiki was filled with everything the game has. even cut content
---
Really?  Considering how often people are bitching about legendary spawns and drops no one cares about how knowing to wait a few fucking seconds can mean the difference between getting a possibly great three star drop or getting a guaranteed one star that goes straight into the grinder or getting no drop at all?
---
As I understand it anything has a chance of spawning legendary.
---
Gotta spend em on something lol might as well be the fast travel gods
---
r/graftonsmayormemes
---
Thanks for all the info
---
Shame to here about all the sweaty try hards now in adventure mode
---
I play on PC with every setting at minimum and ini tweaks to push the game below minimum. (no depth of field, no grass, etc etc). My graphics card is a gtx 1060 and strangler armor locks my pc up for a few seconds (literally 3-5 seconds completely locked up) every time I look at the SBQ when the poison stacks are active.
---
For the love, that would be so awesome
---
People are selfish internet is full of selfish jerks just like online gaming dont expect others to be consideration.  You cant teach arrogant people anything as that is the typical response if you say it polietly if you toned it wrong then expect such responses.
---
I guess I don't understand sciping a legendary you thought was worth modding, why not put it in your vendor or trade it?
---
Hey OP, that was me :D I heard shots coming from Huntersville so I figured I'd come poke around. At one point the both of us were on the second floor in one of the wrecked out houses shooting upward. The scorchbeast fell down onto a tree, right along a fence, and my lazy bones decided to jump a few times to loot the thing instead of walking around the fence like you did lol. Eventually, we both walked out to the edge of town, you had thanked me (I didn't have a mic on so it took me a few seconds to respond), we exchanged a few words and went on our separate ways. You had mentioned you would server hop whenever you came across one, so I'm glad I helped you in taking down your first one :) Cheers!
---
it shows as a bullbarrel in the picture but doesn't appear on the gun itself.
---
My best advice is to be patient and mention some of the basics in area chat.  I always make sure people going Uranium Fever know that everyone has to “tag” the Supervisor.
---
Tell us about your faction. What system is it on? Are you a faction for good, or pillage?
---
This is false information. An enemy can still be glowing and give you a 3 star item.
---
I don't get this shit either. Why can't people understand basic things like this.
---
They aren't that bad. At least, I haven't encountered many. Granted I'm level 198 so that might discourage them compared to a lower level. Oh one big change was they messed the good events up! Certain events now run on a circuit and will only pop up one at a time as "public events"
---
You can click on the public event on the map and it tells you info about it and when it started and how many people are there which is great and I absolutely love that part (also public events are free fast travel now).
---
 The problem is that you cant trigger the events on your own anymore and they happen way too infrequently. Uranium fever pops up once or twice in a 3 hour session and literally 6 or more people go to it and it's a clusterfuck. Same with one violent night. 
---
I have noticed a huge improvement in stability though and haven't had a problem staying on the same server for 6+ hours. If I'm on it enough I'll be the only one left and can safely go cap workshops and shit which is nice
---
But it's against their own benefit, too. They are also losing out on potential 3\* legendaries.
---
Do you run around with a Tesla loop firing nonstop too? There are plenty of annoying broken items in this game and the decent players avoid them. 
---
I really like my quad Tesla but it gets sound glitched to everyone around me all the time, I can't hear it myself but I still avoid the gun for the sake of other people. I play with a big discord group and you would immediately get asked to take off the strangler armor if you showed up to an event with it.
---
I don't think anything has really changed since backpacks.
---
I kind of started doing this thing where I'll either stare at them through binoculars until they wake up, or (or if they dont wake up before I get bored) I'll strip down to my underware, jump on them, them leave a bag containing cream and raw rubber to make it look like I was spanking it while I watched them sleep.
---
It's the little things that keep me playing when I reached those higher levels and stopped finding things to do...
---
And I wouldn't. If we stop using items because they steal messed up then no one will complain and Bethesda will never fix them.
---
If you’ve got unyielding with weapon weight reduction as a set, I’d be interested.  Tell me what you want for it  👍
---
And that's how you lose friends :) enjoy your solo experience, loser
---
Well thanks because im one of those higher levels that did not know. Sort of like not knowing until a month ago the queen doesnt land when someone is standing on the tank.. A lot of this shit isnt that easy to figure out Lol
---
There are two different police uniforms the red stripe is a higher ranking officer.
---
Yea that's the one I got with the responders
---
Mainly for good it’s Xbox based but we also could have some pc or ps4 players to
---
Agree with the OP.    when it comes to faction picking in wastelanders.     i'm sending every goddamn raider to hell.    Vault 94 will have it's revenge too.
---
I’ve got many instigating Levers on my many accounts if anyone is looking for one.
---
That’s how I do mine, other than the glow sight.
---
If you mean the standard backpacks, I believe that was patch nine.  If you mean the more recent small backpacks, that was patch thirteen, if I'm not mistaken.
---
People will play how they like to.  I tried urianium fever earlier the event was busy and people wede being incredibly selfish standing in front of shots to go after an enemy one person was trying to kills leg. and succeeded before anyone else could get a shot in.  I jusf left it.  People want to be dicms about something I dont need to stand around for it plenty else to do without getting frustrated over these kind of players.
---
I play with my wife and a group of people who arent cry babies over someone else using the equipment theyve earned. Read rule for and stop acting like a self righteous manchild. 👍

Usually most evenings around 7 pm CET or early in weekends from 6 am CET and online for a couple of hours

Gotta pay the troll toll
---
Yah the originals, I'll check out updates starting at 9 see where it leads me
---
The only problem with that is that often people are selling on alts.    
---
I would love to know the average level of the items being sold and star quality.
---
Lmao I’m from WV, you’re right....can’t travel without paying the damn toll
---
Some people are certainly dicks.
---
&gt;🦀🦀🦀Bethesda still won't respond I love how in contact they are with the community🦀🦀🦀  
---
No cow launcher, not interested
---
That's the real problem, that the kits are toon locked.
---
If the whole song the same descending motif as the opening phrases, and didn’t bring in the bit from the Fallout theme, I’d like this one better. But it goes from a tense, suspenseful atmosphere to a heroic one and that’s just not fun. I do miss the main theme, tho.
---
You are the self righteous one that thinks you earned the right to wear your buggy armor everywhere you go. Have fun in your eternal zone of lag and loneliness.
---
Would you prefer the outfits be free and everyone pay for dlc?
---
Those responses I provided were people 100% bullshitting.  They just fucked themselves and everyone else out of a three star spawn so they cover their asses by trying to play it cool and claim they never cared in the first place or that you're the one that's wrong... kind of like some of the responses in this thread.
---
Wait! That’s illegal!
---
You don't seem like you have many friends yourself. Nothing wring with using the gear at your disposal.
---
In my experience most people are.  Its difficult finding anyone with manners and good integrity.
---
Enemies spawn is affected by 2 things. Who was in the area before you, and the average level of the server player. Someone might have been there before hand and messed the levels for you, or it might be the server itself. If you are not sure how well you can take some enemies, Bethesda implemented some level cap certain areas. I know top of the world surroundings are level cap at 16 or 26. 
---
I'd also invest time into looking up builds of your preferred weapon type, as opposed to carry weight builds as it can really make the difference against enemies.
---
Doors? I don't even have walls.
---
Tents and concrete foundations for my camps. Open community property for all to utilize and shop.
---
Best builds are probably 
---
1. Bloodied meat hook build
---
2. Bloodied Heavy 
---
3. Bloodied Rifleman or Capommandp
---
4. Instigating Sniper
---
5. Bloodied Shotgun
---
Then repeat the above list and use the 2nd best modifier Junkies.
---
Just seen [this on the front page](https://preview.redd.it/db7o1kvs08r31.jpg?width=832&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=592acfcb1f8bd1bc605d8424ecb7e45722edac72)
---
Hang on. Bethesda makes am armor that the only way to wear it is literally to earn it and your implying that somehow people who have it don't have the right to wear it? You're not a clown you're the whole circus. Also you should work on your reading comprehension, like I said I play with my wife and a bunch of others who don't cry over people using the gear they want. I hope you get a life buddy.
---
Oh I noticed it was just changed but i jut really loved the original
---
Bethesda/Atom Shop:  \*heavy breathing\*
---
really constructive and imaginative!  any thought to how legendary skill should play out?  i really like the stove idea, so that investing in producing unique (multiple effect/increase cond) food would create some gameplay for making "the best deathclaw steaks in the land"
---
I've seen a cow launcher
---
Bethesda: Makes armor you have to earn the right to wear.
---
Guy: Earns the right to wear it.
---
You: YOu DoNT HaVE tHe rIgHT tO WeAR ThAT.
---
Sometimes it's worth it, I got a responder fireman outfit for 0 caps from one
---
Ahjjhh dam guess what.... Nobody cares
---
I get that it would be pointless to waste resources by modding something I have no intention of keeping but since it’s a different currency, investing into your product should increase the value of it
---
I literally just said I play on a large discord server with my friends. It's really sad seeing people defend using gear that ruins the experience of others. I have the best melee weapon and melee armor setup possible, I can easily solo the queen in a few seconds and not let anyone else get their hits in before I've annihilated her. Do I do that when there's 15 people at the queen having fun? No, because I'm not an asshole. Now I have to ask, do you play with any friends? Do you understand the concept of not being an asshole?
---
That’s a very good gun, and one I’d buy if you’re interested.  If you are, pm me and I’ll try to find if I have a great gun for you to trade it for, or I can just pay caps.  Your call. 👍
---
Its awfull and is the main reason high lvls hate seeing low levels there because it hurts us.
---
If it's glowing and already at three stars.  This is a simple game in many regards and drop tables are one of them.  If a legendary enemy dies and it only has one star the game draws from the one star loot table, it's not going to simulate whether or not it could have mutated to two or three stars after it was already dead.  Even three star enemies can drop absolutely nothing if they're killed too soon after spawning, I've lost track of how many times I've been collecting sludge for Project Paradise and ended up instantly killing a glowing three star molerat before it was even fully out of the ground and having nothing inside but some meat.
---
I way up north near Vault 51 and there is no water source anywhere.   i hope they do change it.   if anything they don't even have to change it much but just give me more water say like 4 or 5   a handle press.
---
It's really too bad theres no letter d in there because he's damn sure daft.
---
&gt; There simply is not a big enough fallout pvp community 
---
This I can agree with, the issues I had with PvPers have been revolving around the same names cropping up randomly in adventure mode, if there was a huge player base the odds are I would have never seen thee people more then once, but Ive seen their names come up at least twice when they have used the workshop trick to randomly engage us (this was a while back when you could engage anywhere on the map)  
---
And ive also seen their name crop up in a youtube video about survival mode, so out of the "millions" of players Bethesda keeps saying about, Ive seen the same PvPers name come up 3 times in my extremely limited PvP knowledge of the game
---
I'm sure everyone understands it's not your fault that their game is lagging out (it is). It totally doesn't make you an asshole (it does).
---
oh man, so much this!  private servers would be so great for the role-playing community too.
---
I think you need to buy this computer from atom shop, luckily it costs 0 atoms ;)
---
Many level 200s nowadays are fairly new players who have power-leveled. I know a guy who started playing at about the time the Free States bundle came out, and the guy is level 280 something and will still come to me for basic modding needs. It’s a bit surreal.
---
Sums it up. Fuck off with the lag field gear since you know it makes lag. The only reason to keep using it is to show off how small your dick is.
---
Three Dog and Mr. New Vegas are still reasons why I occasionally go back and play those games.
---
I just transfer excess ammo to characters that need them. Pistol ammo to my gunslinger, heavy weapon ammo to my merchant mule. Any energy ammo sells for one cap each.
---
oh right, on the dried up lake, and yeah that's it
---
Country Roads specifically mentions West Virginia. Kinda the most fitting song in the game. For me the one that sucks I'd the shitty non-Johnny Cash version of Ring of Fire.
---
\#JusticeForSammy   we didn't forget Grahm!

Its time to introduce mounts we need different motorcycles, slightly faster than normal travel, uses fusion cores as fuel, but they come with saddlebags that has say a 150 weight limit, or slightly better carry weight than the Excavator pa.
---
Can't be used when wearing power armour.
---
WW2 era german motorcycle with sidecar so you can drive a buddy around could be something too. Maybe mod them out with gatling guns or something, get a little road war going mad max style.
---
 Would give us not wanting to wear excavator armor all the time for the weight limit increase, or  people not wanting to wear PA in general some luve.
---
Bloodied itself isn't OP. There is nothing OP about getting sneazed on and die while doing high damage. Cavalier can be either OP or not depending on how you look at it and it's chance based and not very reliable a lot of times. The real gauranteed garbage the cancer that is perma stealth. THAT is the actual overpowered garbage. 
---
Stealth has been in online game for like two decades and beth does everything wrong with it. EVERYTHING.
---
dude lmfao!
---
Because each model uses different, unique texture map. It's probably the same reason why we can't dye stuff. Those things need dedicated "skin channel" which I am 99.99999% sure doesnt exist.
---
i have plenty of the different Halloween costume plans ready for sale
---
I think it is bugged. Otherwise try near the various other fissure sites.
---
peeps stillllll care aboot this..
---
well.. maybe..
---
Ok. While I agree with your point about legendaries...
---
The whole "BGS hasn't responded to me personally! That must mean they don't pay attention to feedback or suggestions! Just ignore the many QoL changes they've made that have often been community driven!"
---
You're not the only person who has expressed this thought. You're not even the only person on this sub who has expressed this concern. If I dug through comments of recent posts? You're likely not even the only person on this sub in the last half day to express this concern. So the bit about BGS not responding? They don't need to respond to every person regarding every suggestion.... That's unrealistic.
---
Try hopping at toxic Larry’s.  I’ve seen a scorched snally there before, but I do believe it’s bugged.
---
I personally found the novelty of Three Dog to wear thin after returning to 3. 
---
Loved him back innthe day. Just wasn't as great as I thought I remembered.
---
Any bloodied build is by a huge margin the best. With the right mutations, perks, armor, and weapons (in pve at least) you'll rarely die and deal absurd amounts of damage. Its probably the most overpowered thing I've seen in video games.
---
And people thought tse's were overpowered back in the day LOL.
---
I care, thanks for sharing.
---
I'm not saying they need to respond to me specifically but I hardly see the community managers on this shit I probably spend more time here then they do
---
It's hard, because waiting a second means the bloodied unarmed scorched ultra mandigo will kill it before I can tag it.
---
The tabletop RPG point is perfect. 
---
A good player/DM who can effectively play "bad" characters are few and far between (It's a difficult task) 
---
Because you're not just trying to screw over the party/rest of the party. You're trying to create interesting stories. Your actions may be counter to a party's goals, or challenge them on unexpected ways....
---
But the goal is to do so in a way that increases the fun. Makes a memorable story. Drives plots. Creates tension.
---
mine is named Fisto ..and i have a mirelurk king named Steve they are my best friends in the wasteland
---
Take all of the upvotes. 76 will become the spawn child of Minecraft and redfaction.
---
Has to be done inside the building
---
Yeah - I'd like to know this also.
---
Terry Pratchett put it best;
---
"Hit a man too hard and you can only rob him once; hit him just hard enough and you can rob him every week"
---
I like the Grafton mayor.
---
I freaking loved Fisto tbh. 
---
But steve, honestly what better name for a king.
---
The issue is that while many assholes explain away being greifers under the guise of assholes....
---
Many pansies also explain away any actions by other players, actions they don't like, as greifing.
---
What's the theory behind that? ( the tank )
---
Well, it's never as good as you remember when you go back for nostalgia, but I still like him.
---
If you're on PC, I have a full stock of most popular serums @350c ea.
---
What the hell is with the crabs?
---
You're mistaking the journey to becoming the creatures able to work together and rule the planet with the end result.
---
Sure our ability to co-operate as a species is eventually what lead to our infestation of the planet.....
---
But there was a lot of time before that....
---
Thanks but I am at the other side of the pond. One of my buddies already helped me transfer the gun to my main char so I'm scrapping stuff nd hopefully will get the stock mod today.
---
I'm cool with that shit make it where rads build up quicker but can be reduced with radx or something litterly anything more then what already is there.
---
Thank you haha if only they went into a little more detail lol
---
Yes, very true. And what we know of those times isn't pretty, and wouldn't in my opinion really be called being in control of our environment.
---
Has it worked for you? Or haven’t you done it
---
Base Raider armor plans can only be gotten from Signal Strength, which can only be completed once per character. 
---
Below level 15, light plans can drop, below level 25, light and sturdy plans can drop, and level 25 and above, heavy, sturdy, and light plans can drop. This means it's a grind, and the odds get tougher. You can also get all Raider underarmor plans from this quest, as well as Raider armor mod plans. No plan is guaranteed, and none may drop at all upon finishing Signal Strength.
---
I was always selling mine for 350. One day when I decided to lower the price to 299, someone came and cleared my entire stock putting me over the limit before I realized what happened. Now I never put more than 2 of each serum in my vendor...
---
A trick I learned from runescape
---
So? 
---
This sub isn't the be all and end all of the community. It's not even the only sub that actively discusses 76. And that's just Reddit. 
---
There's a whole bunch of other parts of the community ..... On different platforms..... 
---
You and this sub think you're way a way more important partnof the player base than you are.
---
I've killed scorched creatures in various spots with no luck.
---
&gt; You tried to 'nuke mine' someone? LOL Weaksauce. You can't nuke mine, or fatman people.
---
Au contraire, sir. You can actually kill people in pacifist with the rads a nuke or nuke grenades leaves hanging around when it blows up if they're suffering from enough rads. Like so: https://youtu.be/kDI8fdYG0s0?t=482
---
They gotta be pretty much AFK for it to happen, though.
---
Can I have your screws and fiber?
---
I have been doing that since release. Some of my characters are second generation.
---
They need more stuff do do
---
I'd imagine that the server has a certain amount of time ticking on a mob before it despawns when no players are around. Simply to save CPU cycles and ram or other server resources. This information is not generally public tho.
---
Haha I love it!
---
Wait so if you can only do the quest once and you don't get all the plans from it 100% of the time, then how do you get the rest of the plans?
---
On the other hand, some players get upset when you don't sell them for less than 400 caps. I have mine at 600 (all 19 serums) because I can't sustain the flux requirements if I make them any cheaper. So don't get upset at me just because I don't want to spend all my time nuking whitesprings and farming flux just for your convenience.
---
Try stealth commando build. With the right perks and weapons you're fast and deadly and your dps  is high enough to kill everything within seconds.
---
He talks mad shit about your choices...... And has a bug where he spoils the end of the game.
---
Glowing ones are gouls that recived hi rads from nuke zones
---
Yes the tradable ones are  legacies and incredibly expensive as collectors items
---
How do you know they were removed?  Just curious.
---
I sell anything that is worth buying. Script the rest. I dont script antiarmour or bloodied stuff I'll either sell it or give it away if it's not great
---
Then there was me, always leaving my doors open unless I was inside wishing to be alone. 
---
Grumbling whenever I'd return to camp and have to reopen every door and shutter. ;p
---
Check gameflip etc there price has sky rocketed, also I’m sure there’s something in the patches
---
Have you already done all the armor and weapons repair challenges? I started doing these recently with almost every piece of gear I find with less than 100% cnd. Twas kinda refreshing getting some atoms besides the dailies since atom influx dried out almost completely long ago.
---
Cool thanks. Yeah I was really happy to pick one up when I did.
---
Update: found .308 casing in the dried lake by small rock, a teddy fear and a note, south of Summerville docks not quite to the dam.
---
I didn't know this, I'm 130.  Thanks for the info.  I mostly find people blow up legendaries before can tag them so I always try hard to land 1 hit first.  Is there some place in game that it teaches you this?
---
I don't remember seeing it but it should be taught by the game itself to new players.
---
I’m still on the course of leveling up this character since I started fresh on PC just the other day (I know that isn’t helping my gun issue) But I’ll look into the perk set ups as they become available to me
---
I kept making temp characters to grind signal strength and got all of my underarmor and light Raider plans.
---
Actually, for sturdy plans, there are different quests that can drop the plans, but for heavy base Raider plans, that's back to signal strength.
---
It's not ideal, but maybe they will make plans more readily available at train stations or other dailies in the future.
---
What perks are you using to get 440 damage?
---
Agreed, I need this to complete my Raider look!
---
Needs to say it in the top right when you’re taking the image 
---
Right near the bridge you load in for your fast travel, should get it
---
Pink unicorn.
---
Yeah it stacks addictively so you can get to 100% with 2 pieces of armour or with goat legs 2 and one piece of armour. I take no damage from any height with 2 pieces of reduced fall damage on
---
I am now somehow more upset than i was when i thought the plans were just not in the game at all. 
---
Who the fuck thought that that kind of system was okay? 
---
Raider armor isn't even good armor, why the hell is it so hard to get?
---
I have 200 because I fight queens on my melee character but spend most of my playtime on my commando character, I really wish I could transfer them
---
After 4hrs of waiting you might get one other person to tune in. 
---
Then the game crashes
---
+Karma
---
then come on in the waters fine
---
You can't use repair kits for the archery challenge to repair crossbows, you sure it works for the other challenges?
---
I went inside the DMV and snapped a shot of a player doing their quest. So inside is my best guess.
---
Go inside. I know it says “at”, but went in the door on the roof and worked immediately.
---
Melee users have it easier in the early game, since that's where ammo management is tighter and repairing guns usually costs more materials. Plus melee weapons usually have much fewer mods to learn, compared to learning the desired mods for your guns.
---
But they have a little less potential in the late game. They still have some overpowered builds (Bloodied melee gets great numbers because of the STR boost from Unyielding armor), but guns are more versatile.
---
anyone wanna do it in 5-7 hours? oh and I have some vintage booze for sale if you're down for that too!
---
can we have something else other than raiders pls :(
---
maybe for NW mode to increase player count?
---
I would say close the doors leading outside.  I have a bathroom door and a guest room door and it's polite to leave them open if your not in there to show they aren't in use.
---
350? Ouch. Usually see them for 200 at most. Either way once you learn to bulk and sell most of your junk that you’ll never use caps are endless.  Then you hit the end game of stash vs getting rid of caps.
---
That seems low for a full set of the best armor in the game.
---
saved! beautiful work my man!
---
That’s a great list and thx for all the effort! I would like to see a list of rarest to least rare plans obtainable.
---
I get my dirty water from the river because you can spam it ten times faster than a pump
---
Yea but this is for like if the water pump was made to be like that wouldn't it make more sense cause it's a camp item and not just a manual thing like collect from stream
---
Yeah I got very lucky. I love having that thing in my camp
---
I would say just as anecdotal evidence that I disagree that NW is dying. I play NW almost exclusively after having problems with legendaries I the main game ( not dropping a legendary thing half the time, and their bodies falling through their map), and I would say since the last map dropped I have seen so many more new low level characters. The new map is infinitely better than the last one and the lag decreased, at least for me. The only negative thing I have since the update is that the glass rifle shouldn’t be in a red crate and is utterly trash.
---
Also, ripper max level is 40 for some reason. I really wish they would make rippers and buzz blades viable again
---
Damn I hope people actually role play wjth the new update.
---
Wow really yikes, I dont mind earning them but i figure maybe someone has the opposite issue i have.  I appreciate the response.  No paint plans yet but good to know you need to learn em in order.
---
Seems like i do it four times then wait a while to go back as it doesnt do any drops if you just keep going.
---
I saw someone with the paint in their pa and it looked awesome so hopefully when i get one itll be the first one so i can actually use it lol.
---
Looks/seems like a modified assult gas mask
---
If you could kindly point them out for me I would gladly take a look
---
I had 3 different camps leave when I was in their machines yesterday. :(
---
It's expensive as hell to buy the recipes, then you need to go to nuke sites and get flora, hardened &amp; glowing masses, and hi rad fluids to make the stable fluxes, then whatever else it takes for the recipe. I refuse to accept less than 500 caps for that much investment. I don't blame anyone for buying cheaper elsewhere, but I'm not going to sell them dirt cheap when the train station vendors will buy them for 500, then turn around and resell them for 2000. If I'm the buyer,  I'm also fine with paying that amount rather than cling to a couple hundred measly caps until I find a vendor who sells them cheaper.
---
Why is that? I bought FO4 after playing 76 for a while, but couldn’t like it more than 76. The multiplayer feel is simply better in an open world imho. Also the graphics and atmosphere are much improved.
---
I suggest sage smudging the disk, as well.
---
I have a prime aa 50 limb dmg 50 dmg resist, when I made it prime, scorchedbeasts don’t live long. Ultracite Gatling laser is a good weapon easy to feed
---
Yup.
---
🦀🦀 MTX 🦀🦀
---
🦀 $11 🦀

🦀🦀🦀 crab 🦀🦀🦀
---
I actually read that, and his voice was in my head. Ugh.
---
For me Fallout games are about exploration, and loot. If you're level 25, have you fully explored the Forest and Toxic Valley areas?   
---
Tag the items you need to upgrade and fix stuff, so when you see the junk that contains the scrap in the wild, you will automatically pick it up. You don't need to pick up everything.   
---
 If you don't enjoy the loot grind, you might not enjoy this game, though. Pretty much what everyone does is look for what they need and farm exp.
---
Do you want some retcon, post hoc bullshit?
---
Well, you now have to make a mismatched set... like a Raider.
---
Protip: I was out of ammo a f completed the kill 76 with a plasma weapon by beating scorched to death with the gun. LOL
---
So those 3 star that are still glowing are mutating into my 5* bloodied instigating furious explosive FFR handmade! Ahhh yeah! Don’t shoot 🤣
---
Totally worth it, even without the human NPCs.
---
No problem, the numbers come in really handy for me.
---
I sell for 500 each, if u sell for less I will buy them all up and either resell in my machines or sell to bots even if I profit only a single cap. As soon as I hit a server that's the first thing I do is buy all the serums from player vendors, this way i can set the price on that server. It's easier than farming the ingredients and i profit everytime all the time so thanks.
---
I would love if Watoga became hopping again.
---
I have the normal backpack but where do you get the small backpack plan?
---
Yeah that'd be sweet.
---
Saw it a couple of weeks ago! Didn't get anything decent, just a 2* cryolator https://imgur.com/a/vp2ptHN
---
idea is cool, but not on the atom shop. skins for it im coo with it, but tha actual fountain NNNNNOOOOOOOOO
---
Two shot is actually working as described. The amount of damage per pellet is split by the amount of pellets this is also how every single weapon in the game works, shotguns, shotgun type mods, mirv as examples. Be glad it gives you ANY damage bonus at all
---
One of you wonderful players saved me about a month of grinding recently buy selling them for $350. I wish I remembered your name kind stranger.
---
Same glitch here.
---
That's why I made a mod for pc to make the main workbench menu like it used to be lol
---
If another dataminer doesn't answer you in the next 8 hours I'll look in the files
---
"sAnJaY hErE!"
---
Level doesn't effect which paints drop. Paints drop in order with the first being knight officer I think.
---
The dense armor torso plans.
---
The actual serums.
---
Nothing special? That’s Ohio on the other side of the bridge
---
There’s multiple kinds of the fixer?
---
You managed to get initiate before it was pulled from the loot pool!
---
You can apply mods, but you can't trade them IIRC.
---
Ikr, my camp has a bunch of small rooms separated by doors just for the aesthetics, hate it when every time I come back to my camp I have to open all the doors again. Rather not sit through a slow laggy animation every time I wanna do anything
---
LEAVE BLOODIED BUILDS ALONE! If u are mad to start a new character in survival and grind out to run a bloodied build it should shit do as much damage pve as it dose now its not even that broken just easy mode
---
It required some crazy set of circumstances to lose gear in the first place.  I've been running them since day 1 without losing a single item.
---
Oh I found those last week which was a nice find for sure.  I have the bos officer linning and was debating on switching it up but i believe they have the same benefits just different looks.
---
Damn.. there goes my new role play idea, running around as the wasteland Oprah. “A FREE HC BACKPACK FOR YOU! A FREE ARMOR BACKPACK FOR YOU!”
---
I guess we would have to agree to disagree.
---
Oh... Learning something everyday haha
---
Officer as in black suit?
---
Got to be honest. I felt bad for you. Meh they each got thier own problems but fo4 was 76 grind with the worst voice acting put to a game in 20 years. I'll take sliding ghouls every 20 hrs over hearing Any of that shit again.
---
Interesting....
---
So if u equip a second piece of JWR armour, do you get a further 20% off the remaining 17% weight?
---
Yes.
---
The red dress can be found at random clothing spawns for free. And the blue batting helmet can be found at random hat spawns around the white springs grounds.
---
No, the 2nd piece of JWR armor seems to do nothing as if the game were following the 90% weight reduction cap even though the above calculations show we are not even close to the 90% cap.  The formulas they use to reduce actual weight vs the cap must be different which is silly because they should follow the same model.
---
Great... ok so i do need. Jwr piece as well then....
---
Hell. Yes. I didn’t even know that was in 76
---
Yeah, because I carry a lot of weapons, I wear 4 x WWR and 1 x JWR armor.
---
I have been a huge fallout fan since fallout 3 and I know people will hate on this but fallout 4 was my favorite with the whole building thing so cool. I was hesitant on getting FO76 because of multi player and was not one for player interaction. I started a little of 2 months ago and think u are right this is a great game with incredible potential. I enjoy the interaction with other players, love to sell and buy and enjoy pvp as well as pve. Has there been problems, from what I read yes not to mention the big price decrease from 60.00 to 15.00 which sucks for those player, but at the same time I am jealous wish I had started at the beginning good or bad. Either way I see this game lasting a long time and hope to be apart of it.
---
In parts, yes. But the part you are asking after and are interested in, has been rewritten.
---
Don't listen to youtuber that never played fo76, sheep.
---
Farm grenades, frags sell for about 7 caps each I think? You can also sell everything you pick up
---
I also play heavy gunner and I see no reason to get all mutations - what's the point in talons, twisted muscles when you plan heavy guns? Even with 3\* Class Freak it still pointless, in my opinion.
---
Sir why don’t you have a seat for a second...tell us why you’re here
---
Depends on tour build.. Some of the mutations negatively affect strength, so if you are a melee character then they wont help tour DMG output...
---
It's a reason to open a ticket with Beth.  [Bethesda Support](https://help.bethesda.net/app/account/overview)
---
Im playing a heavy gunner only using melee for ghouls in nuke zones
---
Preserved food, junk, cheap stimpaks. Anything Bloody.
---
No ammo reduction?
---
No ammo reduction piece?
---
I would have kept it and made him pay me for the bullets and stims I used defending it. Maybe hung it on my wall as a trophy. I bet he has thought twice about trying to take another workshop lol I've seen it happen when killing the SBQ I actually stood by the weapon til the owner came back it sucks loosing a good weapon and hate to have it happen.
---
I completely agree for new content. There are so many other things that they could explore and it seems like they're just rehashing or releasing the same content with different colors schemes which comes off as cheap money-grabbing techniques. I just want more options.
---
It was an complete outfit in F04 instead of a separate mask.
---
Or to replace the super mutants voices/phrases
---
The magazine poster art is fucking outrageous! These little bits are among the only things i liked i. Fo4 and it really shines in 76.
---
Ill take a subway sized poster if acceptable overkill. That would be my jam!
---
I have Bandolier 2 equipped so there's the 90% cap.
---
Oh I never got it in my play through, was it dlc?
---
Heavy Gunner with
---
* bird bones (STR -4)
---
* egg head (STR -3)
---
* twisted muscles (Gun accu -50%)
---
??
---
Why not just kill the toon right now?
---
I agree but this outfit is already in the game files and can easily be added by Bethesda. 
---
Bethesda should release cosmetics from F04 instead of putting them in the atom store. Sounds a bit cheap to sell re-used assets
---
Idk, I'm a playstation player
---
I thought that you can't dupe weapons currently?
---
Those are the people complaining about their dead Brahmin.
---
&gt; How the fuck is it a myth
---
Learn the difference between a fact and an opinion.
---
I have never lost any caps fast travlin to top of the world and ended up in watoga... Never. But it is also so small and such a small chance i never bought it up.
---
Do you want 500 caps so you fell ok? I'll supply them.
---
Damn, those are gone? I have been gone a long time.
---
Another player (Camera picture, not photomode), inside the building (can be in the lobby).
---
Just look around for the ones that boost your toons damage/survivability, they sell for 500 caps each at every second vendor
---
Why bother with all the side effects... When you get no benefit? Thats like me being junkie and using AA weapons or bloodied.
---
If you're tryin to min max go for the power house perks of your build.
---
After 2 or 3 mutations class freek is still a waste of perks
---
It's a known bug, it only looks ok if you'll equip it.
---
I sell them for 200-250 usually .-.
---
They are rare legacy, but of extremely niche interest. Basically about 5 people have them and 6 want them.
---
Maybe I'll add a scar, but I don't think the steady diet of dog food and inert flux will age me that much in a year. :p
---
Yea but those 6 will pay big which is the good thing
---
couple weeks ago stumbled across someones camp up on a cliff overlooking watoga in the far distance and  all serums for 100 caps flat....just my luck I was on my low level alt who is always broke and could only pick up one
---
What level? I feel like everything in there is super low level?
---
I’m still waiting for legendary versions of the commie wacker, chainsaw and drill
---
Practically everywhere lol I've taken SO MANY pictures.
---
100% preach that. There’s people with castle sized bases with 6000 rocket turrets firing off in all directions and I’m here with a shack in the woods with my 12 magazines and a single bed and my game is like... “one more grognak and we’re done here boi”
---
Just bury it, you get legendary script for completing daily quests.
---
From what I remember everyone was killed by Olivia River, the daughter of the orders founder. She even killed her own parents just to be betrayed by her raider 'friends'. Seriously I hate her and it felt good knowing that she has been betrayed the moment after she killed her mother.
---
I for one love Goddrays.
---
what challenge do we have to complete for bethesda devs to put in a pressure plate like in minecraft ....but thinking about it and [Murder death hotel someone made](https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/7/20903297/fallout-76-love-hotel-trap-church-brahmin-death-bethesda) I think that would just make trap houses easier to make
---
Ghoul slayer gamma gun inside a blast?! Madman.
---
Also on Deathclaw Island
---
I don't doubt that. People collect weirder things than gold-plated miniguns.
---
"In"
---
It's borked. :(
---
At this point I'm pretty sure beth is trying to release all fancy and cool atomic shop stuff with wastelanders as it is effectively a relaunch of the game, but I believe this waiting game is taking its toll on the playerbase. Everyone is at their camps now, no ones doing anything, and even the atomic shop has been stale too.
---
Smart money is on beth releasing BoS/Responder content November, just before or during WL (can we use this for wastelnders? its a goddamn long word to type every single time) launch.
---
It was very popular until people tryed it...
---
My experience: Joined the game and there was a guy with 1000 caps bounty. So I thought nice, lets flank him and take the easy money. Oh was I wrong, he tanked maybe 100 hits from furious minigun like it was nothing. His health was just rubberbanding - my guess is assasin/sentinel ... And than he and his friend who suddenly appeared killed me like nothing with same explosive weapon. Even tho I was in PA. I'm sure they didn't dupe it...
---
It was the last time I attempted to play pvp in this game. Day 2 after survival release...
---
And I know its has been rebalanced since that time, but I'm not going to look for new gear and remake my build to be a little bit competetive in pvp.
---
Look for that golden number. What that mumber is you decide from expiernce but... 17 is too much and 3 is too low. Seems kinda hugr spread but i dont go to anyone ouside if these numbers and i get burned about 3 in 17...
---
I have a character that looks like Preston Garvey, wears the same Clothes as Preston Garvey and Talks like Preston Garvey. People hate me. It's wonderful!
---
500 per serum or bp??
---
If i’s 500 per serum i would buy them
---
They both count as responder gear if you need it for a quest.
---
With maxed out selling stats, you can sell them to robot venders for 500 caps each.
---
They took my time... So broken!
---
It looks so out of place and in place at the same time lol
---
I’ve sold two at 100.  Also sold two bloody chefs hats and a grill master hat for 100.  I have ton of them, it’s all I got basically during my 20-30 runs during meat week.  They may go up in price if they don’t do another meat week for a few months...but they were such a common drop I think you have to wait for a wave of new players to start playing to get any value out of it
---
No dog.. Drop your shit off to the nearest player they will keep it safe for you?
---
Is this a troll or are people really this stupid?
---
no they all should stay, I still have mines and I have opened them dome like 100 of times.
---
That strategy doesn’t work if they lose players with every update, as new games come out less will stick with them so it doesn’t make sense for them to hold out so long, and the handmade skin sucks it’s literally just paints 40% of the gun white, I’m starting to genuinely think either Bethesda doesn’t know what the people want and are horrible with creativity or some of the higher ups demand what gets released and are so out of touch with the community
---
This became very apparent when they released a fucking recolor of the alien blaster
---
Unfortunately I’m already growing tired of it lol. I’m not sure why maybe the color lighting makes me start to dread walking by it. The bot is also about to get kicked out. I wish you could mute him. I might figure out a way to eject him from the space ship by catapult or something.

fo76 is server hopping!!!!!
---
Hello there, do you still have them?
---
Really? .44 thought was only revolvers...
---
I went back to play FO4 after 76 and couldn't help but notice a few things I like more in 76. I like the settlement size in FO4, but the menu to build is better optimized in 76. I also really missed marsupial too. Vats and chems in FO4 were more fun and practical though.
---
Reshade works in most games since its just an overlay, its not bannable, ife been using it for months now.
---
Its a nice weapon after all,  dps wise its weaker then the .50, LMG and GP, but pretty cheap to make ultracite cores if you prime it.
---
Praise be to Atom
---
Hit me up. Getmyshotgunson. Ps4
---
Then you probably haven't logged in for a few weeks...
---
There is a lot u could do, at lvl 11 stick to the forest and level up killing all the scorched and ghouls in Morgantown. Once u get to lvl 50 try out whitesprings there are plenty info on tactics to clear whitesprings. My personal favorite is the golf club house, I jump on the back awning with my mole miner gauntlet and start killing them as the ghouls try to go through the windows it's so funny seeing them climb over the heap of bodies I've already killed. Lvl 100 try west tech, I'm only a lvl 126 and find it to be unchallenging and I have good armor and weapons. If u want to gain extra xp always be well rested, eat cranberry relish, cobbler or I believe canned beef stew I think. Well rested is an easy one takes about a minute to do and ur good for awhile. You could get away with out having a camp and just use other players camps be a true nomad. There are some good points to having a camp but u dont have to have one. There is a lot more to the game then just leveling up but I understand the hurry to. You can find a lot of info on here just do a search and u will find tons.
---
I ran into a level 3 alt account by 76 selling 675 plans for a ridiculous prices. All I could think was they wasted the time transferring plans for them to not sell on that character too lmao.
---
i hate vats, bearly use it. I find it faster for me if I dont use vats
---
True, I stay trying to spend them before I hit limit and have to close my vendors.
---
Ooh, thanks for that list! I'd very much appreciate a complete list, too.
---
Why take the chance get all five pieces.
---
Lmfao at least plans are quick since they all group together and you can just drop em. They prob have 2 accounts goin at the same time
---
I like the wood paneling wallpaper that comes in the free pack. I paired it with the dark wood floor being vaulted today.
---
Pretty sure you can. I have people I’ve added and if they add you back their name becomes yellow. You can fast travel to each other even if you’re not on a team
---
I sure hope they have two Xbox's running the game, cus I know they're wasting time sitting on those plans.
---
I fucking hate when I see like a vats costs 25% less and just all vats stuff and there selling it for 5,000 plus like it's such a bad legendary and it's the same with everything I sell all mine besides actually good ones for under 1,000 it's always so horrible like do people really buy like a bloodied ski sword for 2,500??
---
Exactly. These past few days I had to buy 2 serum plans from white springs. I also bought every whitespring camp plan so I could build nice things for my friend to decorate her camp with. Next is gonna be excavator calibrated shock plan but I'm down to 13k still after the last serum plan I bought
---
Adrenal Reaction, Twisted Muscles, Carnivore.
---
Yes but the angler pit is right next to the Philippi graveyard so no fast travel needed
---
Also one in Flatwoods in the garden behind red rocket.
---
I would rather just drop the plans for people than make an alt about it lol
---
It depends on the situation, I've watched someone get killed trying to clear whitesprings non nuked and get killed watched over their stuff to only have them run over grab it and leave not so much as a thumbs up now that is a dick move if I had known I would have jacked it. Come across junk in the middle of nowhere well that's up for grabs, PCP up for grabs SBQ then u leave it or watch over it so no dink takes it. Otherwise dont show up.
---
Imagine going from Vault Tek educated person who was probably born in vault to some of the "Americas brightest" to boodthirsty canibal wearing scrap armor in just one day.
---
You can't do it manually, but he changes color if you place/remove/place again and after server hops.
---
Per serum, never seen the blueprints in player vendors
---
Hop around to camps with lots of aids and chems etc for sale and you will find them, also lots of people with the plans will make them free of you provide the stuff
---
There is Free States skin for combat shotgun.
---
Preston Garvey aka the most annoying helpless Minuteman from Fallout 4. He is mostly hated do to being the quest giver for countless "A Settlement need our (your) help". He is also a pontential companion for The Sole Survivor
---
Surprised there's no "Microfusion breeder" legendary effect for laser weapons. There could also be a tonne of ammunition type mods, especially for shotguns (incendiary shells, slugs, caps/coin shot, etc.). 
---
It'd be a relatively easy way to add a lot more fun to the game.
---
same here -.- ...  
---
but last week i thought for me it is enough to see my collection only some times in the loadingscreen.
---
so i took a nice screenshot of my bobble head collection and then sell or use them.  
---
i will do the same with the magazines.
---
The reason why they are sold for so cheap in player vending is because certain players easily max out their robot cap limit every day.
---
It's more profitable to sell 1,400 worth of goods to robot vendors and anything sold through your own personal is extra. If people are constantly buying your mutation serums in order to be sold at robot vendors then you can make so many more caps per day.
---
In first game  Plasma Caster was  a beast. I'm glad that Bethesda decided to bring back these classic iconic weapons.
---
Now you do!
---
Were did you find it??
---
Cool thanks :) I’ll have to play around with that
---
I exchanged with someone long ago.
---
Thank’s for tip pal, im gonna hop around players camps and hopefully ill find one or two who sell serums when ill come home
---
Its getting to the point were ill have all my displays, 1 vendor and my stash box thats it, no walls just floor :(
---
If you're on ps4 i sell all my serums for 250 caps
---
Employee of the year
---
I also had this non-ending nukashine trip twice and I found out that you dont have to restart your game, you can stop it by drinking an other sort of Alkohol... if you are fast enough to open your pip-boy before next fasttravel starts ;) hope that is helpful
---
I had my camp really close to Vault 76 so people can fast travel there for free and take a small walk to my base.  
---
But out of the 14 buyers to my store only 2 fast traveled on the vault.
---
Here is my stealth bloodied rifleman build:
---

---
Give me my God damn gauss pistol already
---
You need a good internet connection.
---
Thanks alot for offer but i sadly own pc copy of fo76
---
Don't stop shooting... never... stop shooting..
---
My bloodied, unyielding, stealth, with a simple bloodied handmade needs somewhere between 5-15 vats-Headshots, depending on the level.
---
I'm on PS4 and sell mine for 200. If you want them done in bulk, I will make them for supplies plus 50 caps each.
---
PSN: Pippin__Dreadful
---
What is your build?
---
Generally wait for them to land and shoot them in the head. Equip Fireproof to counter their scream. Max perks for your gun should be quite economic. By best kill was with 10 rounds of 5mm on an Executioner's Explosive Gatling Gun dishing out 300-450 damage per headshots while I was pumped on 60% Adrenaline, 55% Heavy gunner and 5% Bloody mess.
---
With a stealth commando build and a furious handmade you can take them down without even reloading
---
I’m always buying flux off friends or vendors for cheap then make a ton for my mules vending machine and always put em at 250 for people to resell or do whatever they want I make a lil bit off them but I’m happy either way🙂
---
Can you do this for explosive crate? We need to settle down the plasma nade debate.
---
Can anyone confrim that it works on excavation pa?
---
I wonder if they will completely do away with the scorchbeasts and scorch. I wonder if they will replace the use for nukes for something else entirely.
---
Fuck your door
---
Ah no worries, happy hunting!
---
I am currently level 61 and I am mainly built for carry weight at the moment but I have plenty of heavy weapon and explosive perk cards I can swap in. Also plenty of meds to increase damage but even with all this I can burn through all heavy weapon ammo I own just killing one
---
Thats my non bloodied really good working rifle build.
---
The only real answer to this question is that there are loads of ways to kill them you just need a great build and weapon and then it’s easy. A lot of people are saying commando vats handmades etc. I have a junky character with a 50cal that shreds them, and a bloodied gauss character that also does.
---
So just work on becoming a good build and it’ll come!
---
Some people think their special and deserve the exact convenience that works for them. Some think they can come up with the best ways things should work when they’ve never created a game their entire life
---
I came across 3 of them together yesterday I decided to just run lol
---
If you have not tried, port forwarding might help, it helped me with disconnection issues in multiple games.
---
It’s a fun process to try at least once
---
Depends. A good commando can take down pretty quick. Or wait to land and melee
---
1. .50 cal machinegun, because it is ammo efficient (ammo can be made in large batches to counter usage) and powerful
---
2. Equip weapon related crippling perks, cripple and melee, shotguns work the best
---
If you use rifles then just shoot it with handmade or Gauss or whatsoever you have best in your arsenal, you don't have a choice.
---
Also effective
---
Can't say that I've noticed a legendary still mutating so can't comment to killing them before they do, but can 100% say that waiting for the mob to regenerate is not required for a 3\* drop.  I fast traveled to Crevasse Dam about an hour or so ago and saw a flaming 3\* SM soon as I loaded in. I immediately pumped it full of spikes from my RR and pulled an Exterminators, power attack, reduced weight War Drum from it. 3\* no regeneration allowed.
---
There's a soldier that needs your help.  I'll mark him on your map.
---
So far i have Knight, Sergeant and Officer. My my oh my i am fed up of seeing that little red post box!!
---
I'll say about half of them were good plans, and 5% were rare plans, but they had even common plans listed twice face value, for that alone I'll pass on a rare plan, not enabling them.
---
I shot em with my tse lever action until they land and I can destroy then with my bloodied melee build.
---
I hope they're coded npcs that move on their own like in Skyrim
---
Hahaha thought I was the only one to get pissed at this
---
Ultracite 50 cal. Down in about 5 seconds flat.
---
Grounded. Negative is to shooting accuracy. Positive is plus 100 to energy damage so you can live thru some robots.
---
What has that got to do with camp budget? But yes i agree
---
Sometimes these lower level vendors sell stuff for cheap that they don't realize is worth more. I've gotten good plans and cheap junk from vendors I'd usually not fast travel to.
---
I shoot when there in the air but use meelee when grounded.
---
They go down with a few VATS shots from a BE lever. Maxed stealth, rifle, armor penetration and nerd rage perks.
---
What's your time zone?
---
Don't mix carnivore and herbivore. No food will help you at all
---
Nothing, just my hopes on the NPC part of the post. I doubt they'll remove them from the camp budget, but we can hope.
---
If it's that much of an issue with servers just make displays show all the items, even if you don't have them. If you move a display with an item assigned you can hear it clunking around as you move it, so they're clearly not optimised.
---
What I usually do on XB1 is go to the main menu and then look at their profile and hit "join game". If I dont do it that way it will fail 10/10 times.
---
The general answer that pretty much sums all the comments in this thread up is:  
---
&gt;Try to hit them as hard as you can.
---
Scorchbeasts are just massive flying bullet sponges (Lvl 80 Scorchbeasts have 3900 HP). If you want to take them down you need something with a high damage output. You achive this either by a good planed build with the right weapons or by simply getting something super overpowered like a legendary The Dragon. Ultracite ammo also helps as it does extra damage to all scorched creatures.
---
Can u share the discord link pls? Also, are they on PC?
---
Top of the World most definitely. The cabins cover a lot of area and it's extremely well designed, feels like more of a city than Diamond City imo.
---
No theyre considered mole rats.
---
Use your Dragonrend shout to bring it to the ground.
---
Kelston Garvey i hope they add Prestons great great great grandfather, and he has a few missions he has for us
---
Talons too on top of what the others have said, if you are unharmed. And Scaly skin also helps.
---
Oh, I forgot to say that I am on PC. It's great that you've found a workaround on XB1 though :)
---
My mistake or poor game balance?
---
Because if I'm paper in fucking Power Armor, I would say it's poor game balance.
---
High Agility and Perception, cal .50 sniper rifle, sneak perks, VATS. Their soundwave attack will still hit you, but that's nothing a good armour and a couple stimpaks won't help with.
---
Ohhh shutttt itttt
---
I have friends in the social tab from "way back" but unfortunately these are the only ones that will show.  
---
\- I forgot to say that I'm on PC.
---
That’s one of the few bugs I haven’t encountered before
---
Love it! Some more ideas:
---
"we heard some raiders running a scam, pretending to be friends with people and then putting a target on their backs"
---
"apparently some of the dwellers were intentionally making themselves irradiated, claiming it gave them some sort of power?"
---
"word on the street is that some people out there use ammunition as currency!"
---
"Some of the dwellers were using energy weapons to kill the wasteland creatures. But they didn't clean up the goo they left! They're leaving it in a worse condition then it was before they arrived!" 
---
"I'm off the chems I swear! Why won't anyone believe me about the floating house?"
---
Yes I admit people don’t want me to do what I’m doing and its insensitive but its by far the most efficient way to collect materials at the end of the day its just a game so you really shouldn’t be getting THAT upset about it and honestly grown adults be be able to handle a little setback in a video game...  if you want to look at it from a roleaying perspective we are the raiders of appalachia which bethesda didn’t put in so you should be grateful for the extra immersion.
---
That’s unnecessary we are having a good discussion, I understand niceities I just choose to ignore them in this instance because its a game!
---
I heard you can still eat omelette's as they aren't considered meat or vegetable. I'm sure there are other things you could eat as well. What would sugar bombs be classed as for example?
---
Diabetes
---
Thanks :)
---
Congrats! (even if it's just a joke character, it's an awesome drop)
---
I got the camo jumpsuit like that too.
---
Thanks for the advice everyone I'm gonna go hunting now
---
Just wanna know when they'll add the portal gun, it's just not portal without a portal gun
---
Correct, with Excavator PA to boot.
---
I have no issue admitting that I fall into this category. I also stay away from PvP situations, so it's not a problem.
---
This is exactly it. I always have enough bulk junk and unwanted meds to immediately hit the vendor limit every day when i get on. I buy cheap flux and use super duper to make a ton of serums then sell them for 250 caps. I used to sell for 350-400 but i find people are much more likely to buy several of each one if they're cheaper. I'm nearly always climbing towards my caps limit after a few hours playing, at which point I'll go and buy another recipe. 
---
Not quite sure what I'm going to do once i own all the recipes though....
---
I mean, it clearly says "with a plasma weapon". Doesnt say anything about SHOOTING :,D
---
Holding the gun in your hand and chucking grenades at them works too apparently.
---
Please don't. Low levels without many caps are losing out on serums because people are reselling them. They are there to help players, not so you guys can come in and take advantage of their generosity.
---
^this
---
Throw in bloodied as a prefix and get extremely OP on PVE
---
The only useful one is birdbones for the extra ap. But the rest is completly useless.
---
Pretty sure that negative is for talons. Ground negative is reduced energy damage
---
A Gatling gun is efficient on the ammo and quite effective [Four Scorch Beasts](https://i.imgur.com/OlYFSwZ.png)
---
That last one would be a decent lampshade tbh. Some camps make me wonder if I'm on something
---
Replayed New Vegas recently. I know the feeling, multiplied by twenty.
---
I don’t think he’s actually alive at the time 76 takes place... but I miss him, too.
---
The factions could give bonus currency for completing missions certain ways, for example: BoS should give bonus commendation points for using energy weapons and/or power armor while completing their events.
---
This would reward role-playing.
---
For a heavy gunner you should use: Scaly skin, grounded, Speed demon, marsupial, carnivore, Adrenal reaction(Not necessary) and maybe birdbones for some extra ap. And definetly class freak on 3. But melee mutations are pretty useless since they only decrease stats unnecessarily. And with a proper heavy gunner build you dont even need melee for the ghouls.
---
&gt; Cop a Squatter pops up once a day when I join a server. But if I don't get it done before I leave that server it will disappear until the next reset. Once in a blue moon it bugs out where there is nothing to kill or you kill the targets and it doesn't finish. 
---
Cop a squatter sometimes completes on its own.  I guess if something (or somebody?) else kills the squatters?
---
Correct. Been killing them while still glowing since launch and still get 1, 2 and 3 star drops.
---
The only reason i use melee is cuz of ammo, i have bunch of two shot heavy guns and one explosive minigun but im running out of ammo very very fast
---
You're right. Don't want to upset anyone but i can sell at the vendor for 500 caps so why would i bother going on the market and looking for buyers when it's like 2 clicks away? Good for people that sell them cheap, i just don't think it's worth the effort to sell that low.
---
Care to share your username? I’ve been looking for a few serums. :o
---
Whitepowder jumpsuit and moonshine momma maskot head. Both have the same light blue on them and the headwear is hilarious
---
Ok are you in power armor? if yes talons is useless.
---
Sure! it's VvT
---
Pure bullshit
---
Yeah, I did that for a fatman challenge once, ha ha
---
Yup x-01 for nuke zones and excavation for scavanging but i almost always use excavation cuz of my huge carry weight
---
Yea then twisted muscles should do you good. Or try a gatling gun for bullet efficiency.
---
I used to be afraid of scorchbeasts, that is till I got my hands on an AA Gauss rifle. 
---
Mine takes down lvl 50 Scorchbeasts in 4 headshots
---
Damnit! Please don’t tell me it’s a legacy weapon. Was hoping to find one. :(
---
can be done ,relitivly easy with nothing more than a hunting rifle, and no other cards in play save the rifle and tank perks.key is armour penetration. mod what ever you use to full penetration. They have a higher damage resistance in the air, but pick your shot until it lands, then swap to something with a higher fire rate. 308 rifle l50 S/B, typically, less than 25 rounds (that hit). Or, find a sam site, and let it do most of the work. note- avoid vats while its hovering, vats will target it thru its scream. once you get a few, one tends to not panic, then you can activly go hunting them.
---
Oh, another thing , dont let it out your sight or fly to far away. Its got stimpak's as well.
---
Mine is the same as here, I’ll look you up after I get off work today!
---
Sure am! My stash is almost overflowing, don’t know how I’m going to get through the next couple of weeks. lol
---
Yeah the friends tab can definitely use some work. The only way they show for me is a mutual friendship, this is on Xbox so not sure if it’s different for you? I haven’t actually added anyone recently either so I don’t know if something happened since
---
Let me guess, you think it would be better because your character is speced into commando and not heavy gunner? 
---
It's a heavy gun. The plasma rifle is already there for commando/rifleman
---
That sounds like a good idea to me
---
Oou you just gave me an idea for Halloween. Trick or Treat!!!
---
The body that drops that plan can sometimes be found at the random spot north of Prickett fort FYI. 
---
And thankfully we get a reminder to go to Prickett fairly often. Die mayor die.
---
I wonder if the drop chance is influenced by character level, wouldn't be the first time &gt;.&gt;
---
I hand a few out to friends as they never sell in my vender, the madman somehow sells them for 750caps and people actually pay it!
---
Yeah this would be super cool and doable if the game worked properly and didn't require an update for each new comment added.
---
Why would the Tenderizer get legendary variants added?  It's an event specific item.  There is no way to get it outside of Meat Week so it isn't like you could farm for it.
---
These are really good suggestions.
---
Some of the faction rewards seem a bit OP, but otherwise great ideas.
---
Of course, People can play however they want, just like I will.  They purchased the game as well and have different experiences and maybe their legendaries don't mutate.  I've played since day 1 beta, never once saw a legendary mutate or gain stars and drop a 3 star anything. 90% of the enemies in the game glow for me, they don't change. Could it be my fast internet?  possibly.
---
Nobody is in charge of anything in this game
---
Good suggestions but I don't think this idea would work out well either, it would just be an endless loop of getting diseases and dying without anything fun and still with the clunky movement and bugs
---
Harper's ferry! By far one of my favorite locations. I know the main stuff will be about raiders v settlers, but I really want a smaller questline where I can fight alongside new free states members and use Harper's ferry as a new base. It has such a cool atmosphere.
---
You would need to set them to 500 if you want to avoid me / a\*\*holes buying them all and selling them to the Bot vendors for roughly 500 caps each. 
---
Yesterday a lvl 120+ "bought" my few .38 rounds for 0  caps a piece. You will never be able to completely avoid this type of player.
---
Yep, I started a new character with my friend and this level 180-something was constantly following us to mess with this system. By the time we reached The Top of The World quests, every scorched, super mutant and mole miner was about 40 levels higher than us. Needless to say we got fucked as soon as we got *near* the Savage Divide...
---
Oh yeah! I really want to see Harper's ferry come back anyway, so that would be an awesome new area. Maybe we will find out that some of the free states had gone underground and will re-emerge for wastelanders. I visited Harper's ferry irl a little while ago and was disappointed when you couldn't go in there in game. IIRC it's the tunnel where John Henry beat the machine.
---
All the end-game nps are mutated kangaroos.
---
The promise of "Only Cosmetics" is broken, which is exactly what my post is about. D'OH
---
i personally have thought about this for a while now and while i would agree with nearly everything you said, i would remove legendaries from surival all together, instead making legendary enemies drop mid-high tier plans, more scrap and aid. this would honestly make the game so much harder because as soon as you pass lvl 50 and have a semi-decent setup of all 3\* legendaries the game becomes incredibly easy, now imagine having to take down a scorchbeast without your bloodied explosive minigun but instead with a standard combat rifle... yea, exactly.
---
maybe weapon drops would be significantly reduced too so the crafting of your own \*better\* quality items would be viable
---
yup, in the Atom shop, a tall thingy with a screen :)
---
And yes, it's free...
---
Extra action points come from agility, not intelligence!
---
You're not making any sense, bro. Improved repair kits are not purchaseable, and there's zero justification from taking them away. Your argument ONLY makes sense IF they take them away, and as I stated, there's zero reason to.
---
IIRC the laser musket was snuck into the dev room recently, if they were in at launch everyone would have one by now
---
Also kinda funny people can still get in the dev room
---
Yeah. I need one.
---
I always sell my stuff reasonably and im always second guessing if im still overpricing. Im tryna help people not gouge them. People are like have this bloodied rock for 18000
---
Wood armor is a blessing from the Wise Mothman. Do you think wooden armor crafted by mere humans would be able to slow down a bullet?
---
I am obviously not gonna make any sense to you.
---
I'll add you right away then -)
---
the thing is that bloodied is just objectivly leagues above any other effect, missing only half your health you will still get around 50% dmg increase, thats as much as a fully stacked furious effect or junkies with 5 addictions, not to mention the target specific stuff that only give 30% or dare i say berserker. this only gets amplified further with adrenal reactions and it quickly spirals into the best of the best effect. i would love it if bloodied would get a small nerf even while being a bloodied user myself but if anything they should balance the other effects to bring them up to useable standards.
---
I rarely die on my bloodied unarmed. 
---
I'm pretty sure a bloodied rifle build cannot take the perks I use. OP armor is a must (poisoners sure helps) and it's taken me a long time to put together a set because I prefer to run what I earn. 
---
I don't care about doing 20K damage as we always kill the SBQ/Imposter/etc. I remember failing the SBQ after the buff on her and people stopped nuking her for long time. 
---
I also run my heavy gunner bloodied sometimes but it's a bit harder.
---
I hope BGS does not nerf blooded as it's very enjoyable to play this build . The adrenalin rush from being close to death beats being a drug addict.
---
I never get the Mayor shouting shit at me whenever I log in, am I lucky or did I not trigger his bs yet?
---
The song is actually about western Virginia, not West Virginia which is misleading. In addition, the audio quality is completely different compared to the rest of the songs; the same is true for “wouldn’t it be nice” but at least it’s the original artist,  and the song was released in the mid 60s, which is a little more believable.
---
I don't know what "be a nice", means, but I don't plan on being evil to other players, that's for sure. I like being cool with people.
---
Be a nice was a typo lol
---
With my melee characters I would just get to an open area so they would land otherwise I ignored them. Granted with power armor and some rad x or diluted rad x you can survive a long time especially with a couple of points in fireproof.  Once they land it’s just a few power attacks and melee swings and dead scorchbeast. I used to kill ever one that I could between lvl50 and lvl80 (they started not to spawn and ignored me after level 80 for some reason) back in the day with just my trusty all rise and T60 power armor my best was 4 swings.
---
I used to chug radaway at the SBQ on my bloodied unarmed but found that popping a rad shield and a glowing blood pack really helped manage rad intake. 
---
I don't run my HP that low as I'll get there fast enough during the fight.
---
Two main quests.
---
A proper burial at that.
---
Is it fun? Hmmm...only played 1200 hrs. I'll get back to you at 1500 hrs and let you know. Seriously though, I was a big fan of the series but I wasn't sure I would buy this game because of the multiplayer aspect. I've now found some of those aspects to be the most compelling aspects of the game like, being able to co-op with my son in the Fallout universe, player vendors, the spectacle of the SBQ fight, random encounters with other players,  etc.
---
I read it in marios voice .thank you for this.
---
With you here dude, rifle class will be getting new additions anyway. Plenty to go around.
---
Be careful what you ask for. 
---
If modding increased scrip, then applying mods would merely become a necessary part of the grind. It would start as a neat piece of game-design chrome, but it would end as a chore.
---
Just messing with ya. But no I don't plan on being an evil douchebag. I have GTAV for that.
---
Mutated Kangaroos that yield TSE Fixers and infinite ammo quad rocket launchers, are permanently stealthed, have 100,000 HP and can server hop and follow you to every server because you know, they are kangaroos.
---
And if you talk shit about that idea they will come and raid your private server once we got that. IF we get that.
---
I wish I could find a death camp as I've yet to fall victim to one. I found a few but they were poorly designed and obvious.
---
I'm sure many would disagree but it does add an edge when visiting camps.
---
I can’t tell you how many events I’ve ended up with nothing due to an OP jackhole one-shotting the legendaries.
---
There is! I wish I remembered his name, but he's level 500+ (which narrows it way down) and sells serum recipes for 10K. PA mod plans were also waaaaaaaaay below face value. Guessing he buys high and sells low to burn caps. I lucked up and caught him a couple of days ago.
---
I was trying to find some serums yesterday to safely dump Eagle Eye and Egg Head without losing my melee mutations, but all the med vendors I kept fast traveling to were actually selling normal meds except one jackass who was selling serums for more than MODUS charges you with Hard Bargain and Party Boy/Girl buffing a high CHA.
---
Image? It'd be nice to see the work you are praising.
---
This is great.  Another hidden bethesda thingy.  Thanks for the info. 😊😊😊
---
300 is my sweet spot. Lower than that and you have douches tnat buy everything to resell at a markup, and higher than that puts them out of reach of low-level players whose days I'm trying to improve.
---
Wha-whaaat? I am just here visiting my friend who is over 18! I don't know who that girl is!
---
Happened twice to me. Last time I was able to record it, gonna be in the next bug-video on YT.
---
Did you drink nukashine before you started the related quest?   
---
I got some shine as a low level from a friend, and have been wondering if this error has something to do with that.
---
Right ? It’s a rare outfit but it’s bugged and people don’t really wanna trade it
---
I believe I dont even have a weapon that does less than 300 dmg per shot without multipliers. Just go with dmg buffing perk cards and you are fine.
---
For reference:

---
Lol that gave me a laugh.
---
How about the Bowler and Bowler Hat. They look identical but are marked differently?
---
You are doing Mothman's work. Blessed be.
---
There are legendary blunderbuses, got one recently from Queen if I recall correctly. Also you can get tenderizer, fixer and those bear-head fist weapons as legendaries from purveyor if you have plans to craft them, but that means they're very rare.
---
This would be awesome, along with x2 wood scraps if you have an axe and gather wood!
---
Buying a serum recipe cost nearly 20k caps so buying a serum for under 1k caps is a deal.  Plus you have to gather all the rudy ingredients to make which is a pain.
---
Player DJs would be cool, give people a wide communication range like the PA in DayZ
---
Huh, so bloodied builds are the Children of Atom.
---
Just a heads up, you can put two walls back to back to make an interior wall with the ‘inner’ side on both sides.
---
You place a doorframe version of the wall you want, then place the wall version in that same spot with the ‘outer’ sides facing each other. Then just modify the door frame version to be a normal wall. 
---
The only issue is the corners still don’t mesh together.
---
Like 23-40.
---
Thank you for this!  I'll probably have to sacrifice a turret or two to make room for the extra walls, but it will be well worth it!
---
"Careful who you join up with. Most folks are nice, but some just want to fuck your camp."
---
I saw a vendor with one listed at 12k caps. That man could have been insane, but people do tend to splurge on rare items in this game.
---
Yes, I'd love to see this.
---
Ore 2x w/ pick. Wood 2x w/ axe. Resource nodes 2x w/ shovel.
---
MAKE HARD LABOR GREAT AGAIN
---
Ah ok.  Thank you
---
Wow. Might put it in mine for 10k. Nothing to lose ;)
---
Yes! Definately, I've though about this before aswell, not sure how it slipped my mind here.
---
Apparently the interactions with settlers and raiders will take place in instanced interior cells (loading screen transitions), so other players won't know who you sided with. Unless there'll be new faction outfits and stuff that shows which side you're on.
---
Me too. Have them complain about the 150 dmg cap as they beat you and you get both!
---
Dad bot
---
Did you just use  fuckin emojis
---
There are some factions that roleplay heavily. I've run into them ingame and they're impressive to see. If you want to join them, I'd check the faction boards at /r/FactionBoard76 or /r/fo76factionshub.
---
Crafted it and matured it to vintage. Had already done the quest.
---
&gt;I enjoyed it a lot for the first 3 months it came out only because I abused the living hell out of duplication and various other exploits.
---
So you're one of the selfish asshats who used to crash the server and ruin everyone elses fun. 
---
Get bent no one will miss you.
---
Well, thanks to this video I'll now have to go through each CAMP I see and make sure I left all the doors opened
---
I'll leave it open just for you ;)
---
I have been looking all over for the following:
---
-Heavy Metal Armour Plans
---
-Sturdy Metal Armour Plans
---
I've come to peace with Raider plans being locked behind that meta grind, but I'd like to be able to craft the metal armour.
---
Are there any exceedingly rare outfit/armour plans that are accessible? I'm the sort of guy to not stop until I fill my entire virtual wardrobe.
---
“I seen one of those Vault dwellers jump 15 feet in the air! I’m not crazy damnit!”
---
Yeeesh, are there any specific quests in the Divide that  drop the sturdy variety; or is it all just total luck on the loot tables?
---
I've been enjoying the hell out of FO76 but I wouldn't call it the best. It's good though.
---
For sure. It almost feels like the raider colony in Nuka-World.
---
(tangentially, I can't wait for a Nuclear Winter map around that zone)
---
I'm a shotgunner build, I piss them off enough for them to land then take the wings out, the focus on the head!
---
Yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with the Responders, Free States, and so on.
---
3rd one should sell you ammo for caps, just for the infuriating heck of it!
---
&gt;     One Particular Build Needs Nerfing.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I'm talking about bloodied builds. I have nothing against the players that use the build, but one-shotting every enemy, and doing thousands of points of damage at fast speeds... Not exactly balanced. I can't and won't speak from a PVP standpoint, because I'm not engaged in it and don't know about it. But being able to do that much damage to enemies so fast... It either needs to be nerfed in survival, or the legendaries and cards that enable it to be so strong be nerfed.
---
&gt; You're right, I haven't played with bloodied. My apologies.
---
Go try it.
---
So who come that there was a picture thread a few days back showing a bunch og dev room item in a Russian players inventory ? :/
---
It look'd like he / here actually had the item's on them...
---
Que?
---
thx for reply, I guess that's not it then.
---
Depending on your charisma i can get 493 a piece to the robot vendor
---
Agreed. It's the slowest revolver in the game, and damn if it doesn't want to *feel* like the strongest with those sound effects.
---
Pistols in general deserve a buff, and the Single-Action IMO should be a similar power level to the Lever-Action Rifle.
---
Lazy just lazy
---
Yeah with 3 charisma, hard bargain 3, and grape mentats mine sell for 470
---
Some bugs can be caused a few different ways, so it is still possible. It is one of the things that makes them so hard to quantify and fix.
---
Yep! And at 77 damage that's exactly where it would be.
---
“I ain’t never seen one of those vault dweller’s bodies. I swear I seen em’ die, but they’re right back up the next day!”
---
Oh that's amazing, so I could definitely Max my caps a day on all vendors and make a good profit
---
heavy and sturdy metal plans can drop from battle bots, so I assume most ash hep events, and they can also drop from some savage divide events. they are very rare though.
---
The answer is probably not. Its cheaper to farm the materials and make them yourself than to have a distributer. Now, if you were going to sell them for 100 a piece to in-game sellers, that leaves meat on the bone to invest and be profitable. Again people probably still wont invest because you are more profitable when you make them yourself. Theres no profit in buying for 300 and selling for 300
---
Doesn't work, I've tried and he refuses to die! Then again hes a machine so hes immune to radiation damage unlike pets.
---
I see them in vending around the 10k mark, but I also see perfectly preserved  pie, insult bot notes, and other randomly occurring items up that high.  My thought was this is a throwback to before display cases as a way to flex that you have something presumably rare.  You can show it off, and if someone is willing to buy it at an absurd price, great.
---
Yeah, that’s what I thought too
---
On the list of player workshops that I wouldn't being becoming NPC settlements, Red Rocket Highway Megastop is certainly up there. Dolly Sods Campground is also one of the least resource-rich workshops, so I don't think anyone would miss that one if it became a settlement.
---
Sorry I just turned in my last Troubleshooter’s spear last night. None of them were good... unless you’re into legendary rolling pins.
---
"We've been listening to the community and have decided to include a much requested feature in the next patch; Gathering water from natural sources will now output the same amount as doing it from a Water Pump. No need for lakes &amp; streams anymore!"
---
Oh ok. Thanks for the info
---
Yea I currently run an instigating, vats crit,reduce weight western and switch to an AA,vats crit vats cost western for high armor/life monsters after shooting with the instigation.  I have a prime,instigating,ffr,faster reload single action i play around with but I struggles . It can't kill a 68 super mutant with a sneak vats headshot. If I sneak +crit +headshot it will though. The western on the other hand doesn't need the crit it flat out kills them if sneaking. If not sneaking they take 2-3 hits to the head.
---
If you actually want PvP rather than just looking for victioms to blindside, how about you log in to Hunter/ Hunter?
---
That last one is awesome!
---
I thought with encyclopaedia you meant an ingame place to look up where things grow and where enemies spawn? 
---
Because that is IMO something that is missing. I shouldn’t have to look up online where to find a certain plant I should be able to get an area in game. Or add a botanist that sells all the plants or let us farm everything.
---
Just for curiousity, are you a console player?
---
the other stuff is cool... BUT THE RADIO!!!! I would love it so hard
---
Facts
---
Like some of your suggestions! Personally, my hope is that when we get private servers, we can set custom rules. Fast travel on/off, players showing on map on/off, hunger and thirst rates, enemy damage and health etc .
---
I really enjoyed survival mode in fallout, the threat and the need for food and drink forced you to focus a lot more on the environment, and made it a great alternative way to play the game, definitely agree that there should be a similar incarnation for 76 :D
---
Not forgetting +20% XP for everything.
---
500 is the max.
---
Lol no.
---
Trb 2* Armour is what I'm mainly looking for, if you continue to be blessed. (Xbox)
---
Is ballistic bock a automatically learned plan? Or is it a biv drop? (it's not on ur list either)
---
I am under Hunter/Hunted ALL the time I am online. I hate the sound and have turned off radio volume to 0%. Last time it started was three months ago. This is not a valid solution.
---
Each time PvPer sees an unhelpful and accusing in tone comment like this, they think if they should share the toxicity with some workshop owners. If you don't want to help stop the circle of insults and pretensions, don't, but please refrain from helping up spinning it further.
---
Good idea, does that horde include the couple legendaries? If it's a stairwell maybe set a couple of mines on your way back up?
---
This is not PvP, this is harrasment using unintended consequences of other features, I want less of this in the game.
---
Cool ideas, I like the idea of player farms! Maybe you have a crop covered in a camo tarp for the more discerning wastelanders? :P
---
This belongs to a friend of mine, I didn’t get it: [https://ibb.co/MfHdpSb](https://ibb.co/MfHdpSb)
---
My buddy and I were there at the same time, and the bathrobe appeared in the vendor for him, but not for me. Maybe he had higher CHA?
---
I had a mental breakdown once due to this bug lmao. Had to scrap and replace every single piece of my camp for a stupid stair.
---
Better around "You vault dwellers all look alike! Yesterday I saw one of your friend, but I'd swear I saw his body last week..."
---
They have an extra leading space in the name, so when I got the sorted list they were in top of the list.
---
&gt; Polar Bears are adorable.
---
and delicious
---
This, but make it so that you need to know the plans to be able to get legendary versions of them. This is so we can avoid bad weapons from taking place in the legendary pool.
---
Does mommy know you're using the downstairs computer to try to fight people on the internet?
---
It literally has the same stats as the black powder pistol, except rage.
---
That first one actually sounds like a raider gang you might really run into in a game.
---
I'll take a look at the alcohols and get back to you.
---
H/H is not a solution. You have to either resign from hearing the radio alltogether, switch settings each time you want to use it, or endure terrible audio spam that could continue for hours just because the matchmaking service put you on a server where there's literally nobody interested.
---
Again, you're trying to smuggle an insult with your post, doubting honest intentions just because it is PvP that is concerned. I am trying to build a tool that would make finding WILLING opponents easier, and you come here and blabber on how badly designed feature that I have turned ON all the time should satisfy all my needs, and if it don't, then it probably means that I'm actually looking for chance to grief somebody.
---
This is ridiculous, toxic, and stupid. I won't be talking with you anymore until you take the insult back.
---
&gt; stealth boy and a tesla
---
If anything needs a rebalance, it's that combination.  If I am PvP'ing, when I see that combo come out, I disengage.  They aren't getting their EZ killz lulz at my expense from that.
---
Love the mole miner gauntlet. Got a bloodied swing speed +1 strength version that I bought forever ago.
---
It's my "I want to kill everything in one hit" weapon.
---
But aren't there different vendors for different factions that have their own caps seperate from the white springs ones
---
The skiing outfit plan is in the list.
---
I'd easily pay 150 scrips for more specific 3 star categories.
---
Every thing is a grind. Not much has changed.
---
Serum recipies are 17k or so, and only found at the MODUS vendor.
---
I've never seen the recipie proper in a player vending machine.
---
What effort? I can buy stable flux for 100c each in quantity and make 200-250 profit each even with the % house take on player vending.
---
The biggest problem i have with the whole thing is occasionally running out of a few of the bottom tier crafting requirements like ultracite or coal.
---
I'm not sure if there is even the top limit, for sure I played a 6/4 match once. Starting from 2 would be pretty nice.
---
I’m a survivalist.. if it moves I kill it...
---
I use one of my small rugs.  A lot of times it will clip into the ground and you can hardly even tell it's there
---
freddy's fear house of scares
---
btw i couldn't remember the exact location so I google'd "witch costume fo76" and this was the first result :)
---
I sell on my vending machine for 275c
---
Anyone have a link they can share?
---
Saaaame 😤
---
yeah, an option that opens another layer of the wheel with your selected poses. that'd be nifty
---
Dude awrsome big fan been a sub for a year
---
I’ve always suggested two modes, one with full on everything enabled, no damage caps, aimbot one-shot each other all you like, the other is real survival with no legendary effects nor aimbot, just like NW expanded to the whole map. Guess which mode will be more popular.
---
Both the skeleton and witch outfit can only be gotten by finding the plans on dead trick or treaters at random encounters or getting it from another player who has the plans. If you're on PS4 I can make you an outfit for free to give to your friend.
---
Freddy Fear's House of Scares has both the Witch and Skeleton hats.  
---
The Skeleton outfit can be found at North Mountain lookout.  
---
The Witch outfit can only be crafted with the plan (On the a corpse of a Trick-or-Treater, it's a random encounter. Look it up online for the exact locations.) or bought from the Vendor Bot Responder (Also a random encounter.)  
---
If you're on PC I can just give them to you for free.
---
I can recall paying like 2k caps back in the day for marsupial and was thrilled.  And stealth boy for PA - plan was like 1500 caps.
---
lmao, 100%
---
This is sad. A lot of other stuff from the Nuka World DLC made it into the game. Why not the Bull Barrel??
---
Thanks. Much appreciated.
---
I set them at 285 and my sale notifications ring up like a slot machine every time i replenish them.
---
This whole thing is 76's version of FO 4's water farming. Endgame is cap sinking.
---
Good drop. Prime that bad boy up and head down to a queen fight. You want be disappointed. 
---
Just make sure you've got the power user perk maxed out.
---
Server hop Crevasse Dam location....when you spawn in look to the right and down the street you should see a random encounter where the witch and skeleton outfits can be found on a dead trick-or-treater
---
alright, cheers.
---
"Claim this bounty on the Mayor of Grafton to shut him up once and for all!"
---
I'm gonna have to look into this
---
They would have to make a new model for every single combination of every single item. I would bet there are less grains of sand on earth than that
---
Player vending. Sell legendaries, buy ammo, repeat.  I only craft about 25% of my ammo now.  There are also new armor legendaries, like weapon, aid, or ammo weight reduction. Legendary vendor, turn in legendaried for scrip, no more tossing junk ones on the ground. A few new events, and raids no one not in some clan ever do.
---
Also raiders are groups; if you're alone, you're just a scab not a raider.
---
NW is doing great without those gimmicks. In fact FO is the only game that encourages aimbot, almost mandatory for several weapons. It’s not ‘combat’ it’s outright cheating.
---
Garage doors &amp; security doors are one sided. 
---
You can also use a keypad on the security door worth the code written above it. scorched don’t read.
---
Hell I can't see anything at night
---
INT increases earned EXP and Class Freak makes these all -1 stats / -12% accuracy which is totally fine.
---
They need to hurry up and let us put buckets on our head so the shovel knight cosplays can begin...
---
Well many of them spent real world money on those duped shenanigans, i can understand the screaming.
---
No I don't have iron clad maxed out I am working on that however.
---
😮
---
Damage and energy resist and the look, heavy is alot bulkier
---
What kind of barbarian cooks on electric? Why would you do that to perfectly good food?!
---
Omg!  I was hoping you were on reddit to see my second thank you lol. It was so much fun taking it down. If I remember correctly I was wearing power armor and thank god for that because I never wear it. But I had just found one at the mines. I don’t have a lot of level 50 guns witch the exception of a couple shot guns- I need to start choosing the gun perks and find plans. For the first 40 levels I primarily stayed in the forest taking over workshops. I just recently started doing quests and exploring other zones. 
---
Thanks again!  I’m still bragging about it to my friends who really don’t know what I’m talking about nor do they give a shit
---
Also fix the rewards for vault 94. The strangler heat power armor literally freezes the game because of the acid damage.
---
BGS is probs worse of the swords.. I remember pre eoc they dropped to like 2mil and I was like OMFG HDHHNDHLGEUJKSSYIJXUOTWVI MY FIRST GOD SWORD
---
Wait theres npcs now? Like human ones?
---
No offense dude, but you clearly stated you don’t PvP so some of the suggestions don’t make much sense.  
---
People rail on bloodied builds and sent or cav armors but there’s a counter for everything and sorry that doesn’t mean nerfing the shit out of gear or weapons. 
---
I also completely disagree with new characters only.  I’ve busted my ass to get to lvl 248 and have zero interest in starting all over again.  Besides, people will simply find ways to acquire (buy) god tier weapons and armor so it’s a moot point. 
---
Bethesda had it right the first time minus the highlighted top 3 on the map and the damage caps.  I actually was OK losing or gaining caps based on level. 
---
Sometimes less is more
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwYFw0DflE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwYFw0DflE)
---
Looks great thanks for the post
---
I like checking out what people do at the same location.
---
don't pay more than 300 caps each.
---
Quite a few people will sell the recipes at reasonable prices nowadays.  They were used as cap sinks.  A small loss isn't a problem when they would have been over the cap limit so many times if they weren't spending it all on serum recipes.  And now there's things worth buying (bear arms, fixers, etc).
---
Soon.
---
Speaking of maths, the modes i suggested doesn’t need any new math nor constant nerfing/balancing. The unicorn mode uses directly the math from adventure, and survival mode uses NW.
---
The heavy versions are bigger and bulkier and with better defensives on them
---
 [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vjmNeGVGI4CFg92Fge1jI3vYE\_Dc6iC5e5MKmsugXE4/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vjmNeGVGI4CFg92Fge1jI3vYE_Dc6iC5e5MKmsugXE4/edit#gid=0)
---
honestly there is little to no point in pvp so I really couldn't care less
---
I personally think they should have a new server thats actually about survival not pvp - it should be same pvp rule set as adventure but with enemies right out the vault at lvl 40 and end game creatures at lvl 100 with a minimum join level of lvl50 for a character 
---
this would give a challenge mode for high levels to keep pushing and remove some of the mega levels from rotation from adventure mode letting more new people be in the same worlds as such they could more likely make friends of their levels
---
It's bad. Buy individual serums to suit your build.
---
You're the hero we need.
---
This is what would happen:
---
The NW based math but on whole map would lure lone wanderers and more casual players, mostly deserting the full everything enabled survival servers. This would mean that anybody who remains on legendary survival is able to handle it. It means that people looking for prepared legendary opponents would know they are there, and would join it more.
---
Paradoxically splitting the game into more modes will help people play the mode they want with the people who want this same experience, and would benefit the playerbase on all the modes. Right now we're all packed together into single basket, and this makes noone happy.
---
I'm totally in favour of two modes, and would use the legendary bonkers survival for gang vs gang, and the nonlegendary noVATS survival for solo gameplay.
---
What if that level 120+ has a Explosive pipe rifle you’ve just give him free ammo for.. don’t complain when someone high level takes your free stuff.. you’ve left it free it’s first come first serve..
---
Yeah I primed my combat rifle after I got the semi auto plan from the queen to go with my primed lever action.  I also got the prime auto out of player vending and it was .44 too. I'm not sure if was a bug on Bethesda's part or if was intended.  I already had a prime pistol plan so I already knew how to make the prime .44 ammo.
---
The guy I found, I friended. Husband wanted Marsupial? I waited until that guy came on. It's funny how people remember. When he's online, I go check out what he's selling. Just to try and help him the way he helped me.
---
oo, thats nice
---
I did the afk thing at the cookout a few times and played the drums all night. Ended up with two of them.
---
Agreed. I have a large collection of very small boxes for the funerals too.
---
They got buffed though! Special attack used to cost 65% energy, and it got reduced to 50%.
---
Lost it at the 20k caps! Some of you dwellers need to get real on your prices. No one is gonna by that 2* raider right arm for 20k because one of the perks is Bolstering, and no one is gonna drop a couple thousand on a level 35 rifle. 
---
People selling ammo are real bad too. No one is ever going to spend 5 caps per round on ammo. Seriously, if I see people doing that with ammo I don’t buy a thing from their shop. Would love to see an NPC comment on this.
---
Honestly I’ve always seen pistols as an early to mid game tier of weaponry, not late game. By then it’s about rifles, shotguns, heavies etc.
---
Agreed, I think we already have all the pieces in the game and all thats required to solve this issue is to rearrange them.
---
You, sir are *psychic*.
---
For proof of this mans mental abilities to predict the future, please reference all the threads of the player base asking for usable refrigerators.
---
Damn I've never been rewarded any medal on Reddit! But thanks anyways kind stranger. :')
---
Aye. I’m using the nukashine power armour but while it looks good, the sound is annoying.
---
OP wrote "and recipes" which is why I asked.
---
Ahh that decent! It’s spec always was kinda bad.. it’s nice you can use it twice now!
---
yeah not to mention the quests they hand out 
---
I mean lets just toss out the core quest for a moment as a example - if I know on day 1 everyone is headed to the vault overseers camp then all I have to do is stand there 
---
that said there was very little real reason to play survival other then the option to gank people - they really should have made a high level pve zone 
---
then they should make workshops into the main pvp focus - since the entire game doesn't have to be pvp balanced anymore they could focus on making them fun challenging and into something more then a foot note
---
Seeing as a key narrative motif of the story is that the factions lost to the Scorched because they refused to work together, I could see the original characters coming back as a cohesive group. Abbie would definitely be the Scribe/scientist/medic.
---
“I swear I didn’t kill him! He was just trying to connect this wire and he launched into the roof!”
---
I've noticed this lately. Even to the point I bring up the control panel and then the issue seems to resolve itself.
---
I don't remember it happening before the last week or two.
---
Left. I'll make my own bloodied rock. Just pick one up and hit someone with it. That's an easy 18k!
---
Jokes aside, I did the same thing. Is it not selling because no one wants it? Or maybe I priced too high. Maybe I'll switch it out with this other random thing. Lather, rinse, repeat. Sometimes I wonder if people get anxiety from this...
---
Oh well, I expected something... different xD Thank you really much, now I dont have to be sad about it anymore :)
---
I can't remember the cure for that, but if you google "fallout 76 +ryzen" you'll see that you are not alone.
---
Haha you and me both :)
---
I will simply purchase the Atom Shop "Server Disconnect" costume for 1,800 caps and walk around dressed as a blue screen.

“Why in the sam hell does that Vaulter keep his Workbenches and decorations on top of his bungalow?”
---
how are you not a zombie right now lol.  i saw you guys online at like 10pm, id be tired as shit, especially if your at work
---
I would die for the cause!
---
I'm going to venture a guess and say that standing on objects while the queen has aggro on you messes with the pathing and landing mechanic. She needs to find a spot she can land, screech, and start meleeing you from but cant figure out where.  Enemies behave very oddly when you are inaccessible.
---
Something that is perhaps not obvious is when you apply wallpaper you lose what is on the wall inside AND outside. So you may find your lose your electrical connections and wiring. The game warns you but I thought it just meant inside.  My advice is to wait for more wallpaper options, as none really look great at the moment.
---
Handguns in general need a buff but you're right - especially the single action.
---
In FNV I routinely used the 44 magnum to exploring since you walked so much faster with a one-handed weapon. I tried the single action and western in FO76 but they're just useless. Much better off with an instigating lever action or something.
---
Did the witch outfit drop change? I've never found the plan or bought one, but have had one forever- picked up at Freddy Fears.
---
I just started my first alt and genuinely thought it was broken. She can't jump! Oh, wait...
---
I had very similar thoughts about ES6. Also, boots of blinding speed, anyone?
---
I am at work lol yea we were up till 2am if you can believe it trying to finish that expert. Server instability, bugs and crashes kept us up and we didnt even get to finish it. Ran it atleast 6 times, I'm kinda glad DitW is over now lmao
---
Went to one the other day full of rolling pins and dirty asylum dresses, with a giant FU sign. at least I laughed.
---
what we need is new items 
---
1. Rain catcher - collects 5 dirty water doesn't need dirt to be placed 
---
2. Powered Rain Catcher - collects 5 Boiled water 
---
3. Basic Water Pump - Collects 10 boiled water but has to be placed in a source of water 
---
This would fix the problem without to much work as they could just use some barrels as the rain catcher then a barrel with a burner next to it for the powered rain catcher and so on.
---
also would let people build camps in locations they normally don't want to cause of no water access
---
It will return eventually.
---
Lvl 62 shotgun build...
---
Most recently I used a shotgun w 50 extra limb damage, then that broke and I used a combat knife, then that broke and I used my fists...
---
things people do when they dont have girlfriends, huh? pretend to masterbate on people?  dude, you have @#$@##%@ issues
---
I ran the cookout about 30 times.  
---
Got the flag plan the first time, and again on run 28 or29.
---
Yay Bethesda!
---
The survival mode failed because they tried to compromise everything and please everyone with a single mode. Those legendary stuff end up doing tickles, but before they figured out they could use a damage cap they nerfed weapons several times, which really sucked for those who aren’t into pvp. The constant attempts to balance the game is a real mess. Just separate the modes and most people will be happy. COD has way more than 2 modes which is what we now have in FO.
---
YES!!!!
---
I was just this weekend admiring all the magazine artwork, they had some great and talented people make these, i agree it would be great to have bigger version to hang up!
---
great idea!
---
I had a whole camp I had to restart because I accidently deleted a stair case. It wouldn't let me put the stair case back, and wouldn't let me delete anything that was connected to the staircase before I deleted it. So bummed.
---
one time I realized a guy had messed up his vendor his stimpacks were 500 caps each and his marsupial was 2 caps each I walked over to him and said hey your vendor price - SHUT UP NOOB IF YOU DONT LIKE IT DONT BUY IT PRICES ARE FINAL - ok (walks over grabs 20 marsupial serums and walks off)
---
the salt when he realized what had happened....... he followed me around screaming at me to give them back
---
the funny thing is if he would just been nice from beginning I would have warned him
---
Yeah I thought it was supposed to give you more ballistic plus the addition of BoS type.
---
You found the Witch outfit at Freddy Fear's? Not entirely sure, I never found one there nor I can find any mention of it. Map76 also doesn't have any set spawns for the Witch costume.  
---
So all I can think of is that it's either an extremely rare random spawn or they indeed changed it and you could get it there a long time ago but not anymore.
---
I was doing a heavy gunner with power armor build but I recently got the back pack and deep pocketed mods so I rather have 360 carry weight than 280
---
i had the same issues yesterday as well, i didnt even bother finishing any of them.  i ran 1 novice to the halfway point just to get that last kill in.  (crashed maybe 8 times trying to run it)
---
It does this to me on PC as well.
---
Lika a wasteland survival guide
---
1. Give it some .50 receivers.
---
2. Give it a buntline barrel. And a few other barrel options.
---
3. Leave the long reload like it is.
---
4. No optics either.
---
I think what your asking is whether or not the BoS mod scales with the underlying armor.  It doesn't.  The difference between Light/Sturdy/Heavy sets the initial DR/ER, and BoS is a flat addition on top of that.
---
Agreed it shouldn't be all put into singlr mode.
---
But now I am beyond waiting for Bethesda to allow us what we need, I'm gonna work on buikding external service to handle that need.
---
Had it pretty much since launch. That's why i was wondering if they changed the drop- i know i've found many there before.
---
Omg a bruntline barrel would be halrious....."excuse me while I whip this out" (in my best impersonation of Bart from blazing saddles...)
---
B I G I R O N.
---
Hide in the bushes and watch Netflix.
---
I can agree with this
---
In Fallout 4 mod weight impacted vats cost. Is that true of Fallout 76?
---
Going to have to display mine now. Knew they were rare, just didnt know legacy rare. Glad I snagged it from someones vending machine when I did.
---
I guess the thing there really is Fallout 76 doesn't have player factions or really facilitate anything in the design of the game for the purpose of being a raider outside your ability to actually roleplay. Abusing something like workshop glitches to kill people repeatedly doesn't fill that gap for instance, that is just being a griefer. Punching someone repeatedly to see if they have pacifist off and if you can trigger "electrically charged" to initiate two way pvp for a free kill is borderline griefing, though you could try to say exploiting a game mechanic is something a raider would do but it's really just what it is, exploiting a game mechanic so you can kill someone that has no idea what's going on. Using homophobic slurs over the mic or private messages isn't being a raider and is worse than griefing. The line between griefer and raider is partly because the game doesn't actually provide tools or gameplay design around it, so people try to find their own versions and many of them are terrible.
---
Maybe they could also poke fun at some bugs or things the community talks about.
---
"ran into a dweller yesterday. hopped into his power armor and stood there for a few minutes, then disappeared"
---
"tried building a home yesterday. built it on solid ground but it still needs support"
---
"tried removing my stairs, but then my second floor would be inaccessible"
---
"entered vault 94 yesterday. Woke up today with all my stuff gone"
---
"why do you guys jump all the time with a wire in your hand?"
---
"I heard rumors that you didn't really kill the scorchbeast queen. She just flew south and never came back"
---
"now what's a glowing mutated deathclaw needing a drill for?"
---
"which one of you fixed that light at grafton high?"
---
Not a bad idea! Most of my gripe about workshop PvP is how limited it feels once you are used to fighting anywhere anytime on the map like survival mode. I loved being hunted and chased through big areas like watoga or Harper's or whitesprings. Lots of variety to be had whether it's open field or close quarters combat. This sounds like it might capture some of the surprise PvP while playing the rest of the game element that I found very satisfying about survival.
---
"Cannot place, item is floating"  Mofo! its half buried in the ground!
---
I'ma re name my character to the Arizona Ranger now and listen to some Marty Robbins. Now it's gunna be stuck in my head for the rest of the day lmao.
---
I just want the NPCs to randomly take damage while they're walking around.
---
#6 for sure. I can't tell you how many times I went to trade on the other sub where someone has listed the thing as a western and you meet in game and it's a single action lol.
---
Did you ask them? How do you know they can't read? Maybe they're just being polite! 😄
---
You have to give it a little time between hopping worlds. If you leave and join back in immediately you'll find it puts you back in the same world.
---
I have also noticed that if a friend is in a world it puts me in with them, even if it was the same world I was in when I left the team or if we weren't teamed up to begin with. I don't know if that is location based or? I know I've played on the same servers as a lot of people I'm not friends with.
---
Oh, that's a good one! Maybe that's why he's so obnoxious. The npcs will put a bounty on him!
---
Na man, why should a whole class of weapons not be just as viable as the others. It's what creates diversity in builds. It's boring AF when everyone seems and runs around with the same shit. Not to mention handguns have kicked ass in older fallouts. Excuse my while my pool cue does 3x the damage as a 44 mag to your face.....lol
---
Already in the game.powered doors wired to a floor pad switch. They open automatically when you step on the pad and then shut behind you.
---
Just because putting down a pad and a couple of wires is too difficult for *you* doesn't mean it's not already in the game. But yeah, good luck with your camp 
---

---
Even your fellow vault sweepers? 😢
---
This is how good anime begins.
---
Personally, I hope it doesn't come to that.
---
You’re still in this? No it’s not but I’m done with you.  Stop!
---
“Fellow” vault dweller? What’s a vault? I went to sleep in my bed, woke up in a fridge, and was very confused...
---
I've had to start over so many times doing the stair case stack
---
I knew that the BoS was an add-on to the armor defense but in my game I made heavy combat armor just to realize that the ballistic defence was the exact same as normal combat armor. I don't know if it's glitched, but there's no difference for me.
---
I don't think they're wrong to romanticize it. I'm actually glad to see that as the Fallout games have progressed they've put more thought into raiders and their stories instead of them just being a generic group of bad guys you can shoot at. I think what they need to do is give player raiders purpose and add design elements to the game that support that. Raider-only towns. Raider gladiator matches. Raider-only events where you can rob caravans. Raider cannibal perks. Bonuses for wearing spiked raider armour. Raider-only camp objects. Basically events, locations and rewards that give you a reason to dress like a raider, hang around raider places and participate in raider activities. If you take on the identity it should be worth doing.  
---
You can still be a raider and it not be toxic grief fest but I think when left to their own devices people have varying ideas of how to play a raider and not a lot of available in-game options.
---
Nice. Do you have this list somewhere ? Would love to check this out !
---
It's disappointing how alot of the new weapons for 76 released with are hot garbage:
---
Single Action Revolver - well, y'know...
---
Crossbow - shit damage, shit reload speed, ain't even silent
---
Light Machine Gun - goodbye precious .308 ammo
---
Chainsaw - plz buff
---
They're few and far between, at least on xbox. I don't think I've actually come across someone else's yet. Alternatively, you could make your own! If you make it an interesting roleplay experience people will gladly walk straight into it! Send me a vid if you do :p
---
You're in luck! This gets asked a few times every day, so there is a wealth of advice to be found.
---
one punch
---
What you suggested is essentially a legendary mode NW, which would be a totally fun addition to the current NW. Because the weapons have to be looted based on RNG, the trained characters won’t be able to get the most out of their builds. I think there’s the need for build-based non-RNG modes. Quite similar to other shooting games such as COD. You use your build and weapons, with or without legendary effects depending on the mode you play, and bring your supplies, of course and the ability to loot new supplies and weapons. When you kill you’re rewarded by the system not the dead. You don’t drop supplies and junk when you die. However you drop a copy of your weapon (you still have it), so others can pick it up and use it until they die or log off. That will give people the opportunity to try out each others’ exotic toys.

The doors on barns are never just open

I use an Auto VE pipe as my off weapon.  Handy thing for clearing trash and quick healing.

I don't want anything in the game to remind me I'm playing a game, no NPC should ever mention the endgame loop
---
Ok thanks
---
I miss Skyrim. No mining ore without a pickaxe.

unpopular opinion: these are not fun nor meta and should be addressed! :(

---
In the time it took you to do this you could have made a bunch of automatically closing powered doors...
---
The game is as bugged as before, if not buggier. The new wastelanders dlc coming soon might brings something more interresting things to do than just log to server, kill super mutants, realm hop. There are few new additions to the game like purveyor where you can buy legendaries with special currency but they haven't done anything to address the real problems with the game. Just as boring as it ever was, which is a shame for a game that has (had) so much potential.
---
SOunds like minecraft... But what if Im using a pickaxe while IN excavator PA
---
Sadly I’m fully expecting NPCS dialogue to be “My back hurts, my feet hurt, everything hurts” “You know farming isn’t easy living” “Need to get back to diamond city one of these days, biggest city I’ve ever seen”
---
  You are almost at a point where it gets easier.  Right now, you likely feel overpowered for the forest and underpowered for the divide and eastward.
---
@25, the toxic valley and parts of the ash heap are good places to roam.  
---
If you haven't alread done so, work on the BoS quest (starts at camp McClintock), the Mysteries Quest (Starts at Riverside Manor), Firebreathers (starts in Charleston), and whatever parts or Roses quest (starts at Top Of The World)  you can before it takes you to the Divide and Mire. Each of the cited quests are multi-part, and will take some time to complete.
---
Within the next 5 levels, if you have a fairly good weapon, you should be able to do WS when it is not nuked.  It will be difficult solo, but it is doable.   (I soloed it at L27 with a vampire machete.)  
---
At about L30, head to the left of the ash heap near the end of the RR tracks and pick up the excavator quest.
---
All that should keep you occupied and entertained well beyond L50 :)
---
YES!!! my rifle build character has been suffering lately, VATS says 95% but it takes me 3-4 hits to even hit an enemy!

Technically they might not all be, there is a few of them, even major ones, that we do not find the bodies from, they might return with the settlers.

---
Cameron Mitchell is that you?
---
That’s how you get a bullet In your cerebellum from 300m away,

I also believe this. think about mines and such... just makes sense
---
I like NW sometimes, I think the non legendaries work really well in that format. 
---
But I do think there's a place for PVP with our gear in this game too. I want my opponents to have legendaries, even if they have better gear than I do. I want to try to outsmart well geared players. It's a way to PvP that really lets strategy shine. Other games do it, it's considered endgame to be able to fight it out with all your stuff you've collected and learned how to use effectively. The idea of PVP in an RPG or looter shooter or whatever with the gear you've collected is not a new idea, it fits in well with fallout. It's not going to satisfy everyone, but variety is the spice of life.
---
Both styles have a place in this game and the serve different purposes. If you don't like vats and legendaries in PVP then play the PVP mode that doesn't have em.
---
Heavy Gunner doesn't have anything to do with strength other than the attribute points needed to slot perks
---
The strength loss from the mutations wouldn't do anything for using heavy guns other than make them slightly harder to haul around

I'm wondering if I never actually completed the process.  If I remember correctly I did it all from the xbox.  The email I had from back in November is one which wanted me to verify my email address and was actually marked as unread. I don't have any other emails from them.
---
 Yet the game signs me in to bethesda.net every time I play so maybe I'm missing something here.
---
If it were up to me, 4x buff is the limit. The effects wouldn't stack.

Read the post again... it’s a suggestion... it’s not an in game mechanic
---
So after posting this comment yesterday I hopped on my game, and ten minutes later it was Grafton Day AND the Protest March at the same time. It's not difficult at high level, but it was still fairly insane.
---
There's a color one with the mask that was datamined a while back. It even was in a picture in the atomic shop.
---
I often end up shooting my first loaded round in a panic, putting me right back into the reload animation. I have to remember using my lever to let it fully reload before unloading
---
Oh you’re right.  I misread.  Still I would have appreciated a more kind sounding correction.  Especially coming from someone with way more karma than me.   Name calling is unkind.
---
I'm for shifting Modern Renegade into Perception, but I wouldn't completely change the effects of the perk; in that case, just make a new perk.
---
I'm not opposed to Tank Killer working for pistols, but either way pistols still fall behind rifles in raw damage, and that's what's holding them back more than perks.
---
and ignorance is bliss.
---
Delay it a month.
---
With the right perk set, you can be successful with just about any build. 
---
  In previous iterations of FO, I hated melee, so I was always a gunner - my favorite was the Thompson with exploding bullets.
---
In 76, I started thinking perks and such would work like previous versions, didn't  know anyhing about specific builds, not understanding the limited not-always-active perks (as opposed to older versions where they were always active), etc.
---
Picked perks that worked for the weapon that was working the best at the time I could pick the perk.
---
Ended up as a melee primary/sniper secondary.
---
Along the way, I discovered I actually do like melee.   Made it to L142 so far, so must be doing something right :)

Defensive mutations don't trigger PvP. I've tried it many, many times, it doesn't work.
---
I know it's hard, but try to drop your biases and realize that there are many of us that didn't do any of that. Some of us just really enjoyed grinding and hunting down cool gear. There will always be players who have better gear, I don't really care how they got it.
---
I’ll upvote this every time. The camp building restrictions are just terrible. Also, if nothing (even tire walls) will clip into the ground *at all* then they should have put more flat areas on the map. 
---
It’s hard to even find a flat paved road.
---
Also if you contact customer support they won't be any help either. I had a fermenter stuck in a bridge (my CAMP is under a bridge), and contacted costumer service to delete it and [I got this bullshit.](https://i.imgur.com/2EcnVvt.png)
---
Apparently they don't have the tools to delete anything for you. I had to rebuild a CAMP because I also had isolated floating stairs at one point. They can delete duplicated items and characters but if its in our CAMP then we can go fuck ourselves I guess.
---
but, there is one big advantage.. one at your camp, one at every workshop you own
---
Oh that’s cool, i remember in fo4 I played with whatever was given to me. Now I’m mostly melee and I take the occasional chem, but I’m thinking of being bloodied (despite me saying I wouldn’t LOL).
---
Is that the only other option?
---
The frame is pretty underwhelming fyi
---
Thanks for the schadenfreude.
---
I'm level 60. I just started playing NW. It's a major grind and takes forever but it's kinda fun. Plus I want the level 50 reward.

Thanks! Those suckers must be terrifically rare drops, though. I’ll just have to put my nose to the grindstone until they appear
---
Pistols are a lot stronger than what anyone here chooses to fully build for. Under agility there are 15 points that spec beautifully for a full gunslinger loadout. All 3 star gunslinger cards 3 star gun-fu and 3 star adrenaline and any pistol in the game can do wonderful damage. That’s without taking orange mentats to increase accuracy in vats and perception or overdrive to increase damage and Crit Damage numbers. The thing most people don’t know is that pistols like smg’s have a lover action point cost when using VATS than any other weapon group making it important that one uses the auto target for repeated shots on soft enemy targeted spots. I have spect into gunslinger before and can tell u that aside from the range penalty to pistols they are definitely endgame capable.
---
Well the suggested   is a new perk, just using the name cause it's fitting. In its current state modern renegade is about pointless. The cripple isn't nearly enough for anything other than auto pistols, and pistol hip fire is pretty good without any perks.
---
Pistols lag in raw damage, but they should. And this is coming from a fella who uses a gunslinger as a main. Creating more of an emphasis on vats use and strategy is synonymous with pistols. If you can get consistent hits to vital areas, and lay down crits you can perform well. The AP and stagger will help low damage pistols do more damage between crits and let them stagger enemies to help keep their distances and not take hits.
---
Real reason that survival was deleted was that Stranger PA sets allowed to OHKO majority of the people on maximum distance, while needing two hits to kill people specifically prepared against them. They have their focus set on Wastelanders, and as soon as Strangler PA would gain enough users, there would be an backlash that they implemented OHKO mechanic that made previous gear irrelevant. They decided to shelf the project instead of fixing it now, for the sake of Wastelanders - as a fellow PvP who misses the survival deeply, I think its actually a sane decision.

My main is a gunslinger and does well. I posted yesterday in another post about this.,.yes a handgun can be viable and kill endgame but when you start comparing it's not even close . Here's the thing ,I keep seeing people handguns take less AP... No they don't. Western is 35, 10mm is 28..... Lever gun is 26..... Combat rifle I believe is 30...
---
So the lever gun. Can use 3 ranks of rifleman,3 concentrated fire, 3 into tank killer than in agility they can take ...3 sneak, 3 covert ops, 3 gunfu, 1 adranaline. Better critical and crit savy aswell. So it does more damage than any revolver, will not break sneak, gets a 2.5 sneak modifiers, costs less AP and will crit just as often as the pistols. All without giving up a single damage perk. Let's not even get started on auto rifles....

Alright , thanks

I cannot relate to the comments anymore, the paIN

I think that’s the Camo Underarmor and if I’m correct is either leaving the shop soon or it left already. Check should be at the Apparel section at the bottom
---
The arbitrary C.A.M.P. Building restrictions are the worst aspect of building in 76. If you came from Fallout 4, and like to build cool structures, this bug alone is enough to make you quit the game for a long while. 
---
When new players run into stuff like this they likely just give up. I’m not sure what Bethesda was thinking. We can still build floating structures. How do they justify these C.A.M.P. restrictions?

Also make sure you have a nuclear keycard.  You need both the deciphered code and a keycard to launch.

The worst is how you have to build stairs first if you want to build upper floors.
---
Yeah mine are at 200 but I don't sell many. I figured low level players don't know about serum reselling and older players already make their own
---
Ah.  I've only fought the queen 3-4 times; plans for the decon arch the first time, no plans or recipies for the others.
---
It was patched out a while ago.
---
is hiding in the bushes a valid strategy or you guys just messing around? I want Hellfire but no way I'm grinding like that, even if I actually liked BRs.
---
I really don't mind cheesing my way up.
---
Nah. They were in survival because survival was actually a challenge. There's already way too many free handouts in the easy mode
---
The Class Freak perk can minimize some of the downsides, although I think one or two of them are still bugged in that respect.
---
That said, even with Class Freak, you're still taking some unnecessary hits for the mutations that don't benefit you.  I'd recommend saving up and buying serums off player vendors (they're getting pretty cheap) and just get the handful you actually want.
---
I don't know if the queen is different, but flying mobs still rely on the ground for pathing and they get confused if you are standing on something that they can't reach, even if it seems like they should be able to.
---
Free pack?
---
I remember saying that to my Brother and best friend during the B.E.T.A.
---
We even thought the were using the B.E.T.A. to fix bugs for launch. How naive of us. 
---
Still I wouldn’t take back the last 10 months or so of gameplay. Even if it still feels like this game just isn’t quite finished in terms of features, weapon balance, bugs, UI, and performance.
---
FUS ROH DAH!
---
Oh man, I have the 3-star Instigating MM gauntlet, faster swing speed and +1 agility...it kicks ass. Still does nowhere near the damage of the Unstoppable Monster, though...that thing is a killer
---
Finally, a gamer that uses the word “meta” correctly.
---
Throw a beer in there too and it will go up. (mine is 493 with 5 charm hard bargain 3, grape mentats and a beer) Sweet roll will push it higher but I find it a waste of time to gather all the mats to make rolls.
---
Lol at Mandingo, that's clever 😁
---
Post a pic.
---
I did the Charlie one and since it was my first time I forgot you needed to decipher the code and I'm pretty sure it doesnt give back your keycard so I had to get another one. Do you know any ways of how to decipher it?
---
The amusing thing is...I actually understand exactly what is happening.  It has to do with Anchoring Hierarchy.  The pieces are all getting placed "In Order", as in each piece has a sub-property of "Pieces attached to me".  Or rather each non-foundation piece has a "Parent" slot.
---
For pieces not allowed to exist without a parent (which is, sadly, a lot of them)...if you try to delete the parent piece it will stop you because then the child piece will be "floating".
---
Which piece is the parent of a particular piece is NOT always obvious, particularly when dealing with walls and roofing (ran into this SO MANY TIMES).  I actually frequently would have a problem with not being able to close half-wall holes.  That's obnoxious actually.  It tried to snap, but wouldn't allow placement because it would overlap, even though it was perfectly flush.  That's the one I get annoyed with more often.
---
Anyway, the point is that you basically need an engine rebuild to separate "placement" versus "existance".  Pieces need to be allowed to exist without a parent, even if they cannot be placed without one.  Conversely, pieces need to be allowed to be deleted even though it would leave other pieces floating...and the best way to do this in the current engine is to delete the entire dependency chain.  If it would leave a piece floating, send the "floating" piece or pieces directly to storage.  That'll be just as frustrating really, but a the same time will stop you from getting that floating piece message.
---
&gt; "word on the street is that some people out there use ammunition as currency!"
---
Maybe you should start a post about this. So the community can work out actual rates. And we start working with cents. Capcents. Like a .38 can be 10 cent or something. A .50 is 2 caps. Like a €2 euro piece. And then everything in between.
---
You have caps and loot and I want it. That's what it is. It's a video game and if you're that hurt by someone's actions then maybe you shouldn't play the game. Furthermore a long PvP battle is much more fun than an enemy who doesn't do anything you don't suspect. I've never had a super mutant attack me and when I fight back one comes up behind me and shoots me in the back while I'm distracted. That is actually fun and unpredictable.
---
So now I'm on the alpha since it said the word was complete and my word is  lavished
---
I'm wondering why it doesn't even have the attach points for legendary mods. The Mr. Handy Buzz Blade and Ripper are similar weapons and they work fine with legemdsry effects.
---
They remove/change a lot of things that get reverted back again (like the limb damage melee weapons they needed to fix...again).
---
Dude. Just place your camp fown again. It puts everything away. And you can either put your place down a little to the left to finish or you can break the blueprint down and replace everything. No scraping needed.
---
RE: some of the concerns here, all you'd need is a checkbox for "prefer server with CAMP availability"
---
My real question is if this is even possible. Have devs hinted one way or another? Is there no way to, before load-in, check a) your camp's location and b) if that's free in the server?
---
Seems like it would reduce server load with fewer constant load ins

Why though? I know "that's what Beth said", but there is clearly a very large demographic of Fallout fans that want the extreme pve challenge. That's why mods like Frost, Dust, and Horizon are so incredibly popular for Fallout 4 and New Vegas. Hell, I basically made a successful YouTube channel with 15K subs almost solely from playing those mods.   
---
I just don't see a point to having "easy" survival mode.

With hard bargain lvl 3, grape mentats and a beer the best I can get is $470

Its not DLC, its a FREE update for everyone.   
---
All we know is they are adding more missions to the main questline and that they are adding some instanced areas so that you can travel / do missions with companions.
---
Enforcer, drops 'em reliably (to the extent that anything in the game is reliable). Incisor, Blade of Bastet, Gladiator and high strength.
---
I sometimes sell that stuff for low levels. Keep legendaries in stock too tho
---
The reason this happens in other games is the developers have build version numbers; they're not all working on the same version. They bundle these up as an update, and sometimes things get overwritten or missed. Thus giving us repeating issues that have been fixed before.
---
When I agree that depleting first round of health and waiting for the legendary to heal up before killing for better legendaries is a myth, I've seen the other in action many many times. Uranium fever seems to get this the most, you'll see it spawn without legendary status yet it still glows, but there is a delay in adding the legendary status to the miner along with it's stars. You can watch it happen. If you kill it before it gets it's legendary status and stars you get no legendary drop. I've seen it too many times to chalk it up to being a myth.
---
No. No they aren't. They aren't even glitches.
---
You have no idea what you are talking about.
---
Yep. Everything in the building runs upstairs. Bodies can get lost or disappear in the pile however.
---
Overtax and overregulate scorchbeast related industry, causing widespread recession and unemployment among scorchbeasts, driving most of the scorchbeast populace into opiod addiction and death.
---
I dont have an answer for you, but i assume it comes down to mass appeal and casual gamers.
---
Hiding in bushes is a completely legitimate strategy, in-between fights it is highly recommended. The longer you stay alive the more XP you get from the mode. Unless you are really good at PVP, hiding and avoiding the fight as long as you can will net you the best results. If you get lucky the other teams can wipe each other out and you can get Overseer with 0 kills.
---
Buff pistols in general
---
It's like herding kittens!
---
thats 6 my man
---
It would be a real slow way to do it. I'd recommend teaming up with some people who can communicate well. Then you just have to kill and don't be killed. The more you play the better you'll get and find a perk loadout that works for you. You may have to adjust specials.

Yeah I know that😁 but they are not automatic closers and before anyone mentions them pressure plates are a very clever but absurd looking workaround    
---
In an immersive sense a pressure plate or pin code with the number above is the last thing you would want even Grahm could do the pin code and a mole rat could activate a pressure switch 😂
---
Are they even out yet?
---
I've been using this website.  
---
https://nukacrypt.com/
---
They figure out the codes every week.  Also I think the codes should be expiring sometime today as an fyi.  I don't actually take the time to find all the pieces and do the decipher myself.  There are some posts on this reddit that explain how to do it and some good videos on youtube too.
---
Probably using ghoulish and looking for a nuke briefcase
---
Not especially unique (recently found a whole ass player faction who have it as their uniform!!) but I love the fasnacht owl mask + ritual outfit combo. 
---
Been wearing it for the last ~140 levels; before that, the union uniform and field scribe hat were top-notch :D
---
The sons of Dane are alive I say!  They went north to hold a big BBQ!

Are we sure toxic Larry is dead?  That’s a character I certainly want to meat (ha).

I don’t believe we ever found Abby’s body.  As you noted same with melody.  If we rebuild factions I really hope they both are in charge.

I have tried Hunter hunted for months. I got it to work once.

Then survival came out and we all had fun there. But now it's gone.
---
Why do you guys think PVP = greifing? Those are completely different things. The people like OP want to play a game WITH other willing players. The people you refer to are not into PVP they are assholes.
---
Yes, I just want to make something cool, and unique that ties together in a believable way but these restrictions often get in my way too.
---
Love it!!

ammo is not worth 1 cap each. We need options to sell bulk ammo, so I can sell a pack of 100 for like 20 caps or something. Give us that and every ammo type can be sold.

Or why, for that matter, it's locked at Lv. 25 or something silly like that.

We have a free states one. What I want is a combat rifle paint. Or for the combat shotgun to work on the combat rifle

SPOILERS: 
---
I think we were meant to assume that the Overseer died from her final recording but she might have survived. 
---
Other than her I can’t remember which characters left dead bodies and which did not. The main quest was ages ago for me. 
---
Come to think of it though, Evan may have survived if his body just saying ‘Scorched’ was a clue.
---
I recall some flyers from a ghoul that wasn’t quite feral talking about the mall in the more so maybe a ghoul faction
---
&gt; If you kill it before it gets it's legendary status and stars you get no legendary drop. I've seen it too many times to chalk it up to being a myth.
---
Why has there been no reliable source posting a video showing that effect.  It wouldn't be difficult - just do U-fever ten times and post video clips of the drop results in each end case.
---
People like to believe things they see on forums without any sort of proof - not criticizing *you* here just talking in general.  Respectfully there is a thing called "confirmation bias" where essentially you start to see something you basically expect to see.  I think that goes on a *lot* in forums such as these.  And of course there's just the good old attention seekers making things up in order to be "helpful"
---
I'm open minded - I just need a bit more proof than someone's anecdote without any real (video) proof
---
Pretty racist and dick jokey but sure, it's totally clever
---
The crossbow counts as a supressed weapon since it works with mr sandman. The lightmachine gun isnt bad at all anymore since the buff. And the chainsaw used to be beautiful with the overrepair damage increase before they fixed it.
---
lol I have no bias, I knew what’s going on when I came across players at their bases telling me they have cool stuff on ebay and some other websites. I went to check it out and saw the records showed they already sold a bunch. I remember seeing an anti-armor explosive auto shotty for $80 and some sent-ass armor for 100 a chest piece. And the item description would say ‘only 3 left’. I totally believe they didn’t dupe them 😂
---
Thanks and I hope they dont expire I just got them all last night and went to sleep now I'm at work haha. But thanks for the help
---
Hiding in bushes is a great strategy, I've managed to get into the top 3 and sometimes a win just hiding.
---
One match I didn't kill anyone and still won lol
---
I believe you have to take a picture of someone in powerarmor.
---
... I can see why you would be surprised! And so very confused... Welcome to the wastes, you poor confused soul!
---
Definitely. The thing is so slow it’s obnoxious. I used to use it to get dirty water since my CAMP is nowhere near water, but then I realized it’s ten times faster to just fast travel to Vault 76 and harvest as much water as you need from the pond down by the lumber mill.
---
I spent an hour server hopping the 65 location last night. No luck :(
---
So those 3 codes that are there are those the ones I put into the keypad?
---
If the drill makes certain atom shop item free, they will fix it yesterday morning.
---
Yeah I did, would go off outside, went inside the building and it went off.
---
Thanks though
---
this, but i like the idea of a more passive mode that give 30-60 minutes of workshop ownership where the owner cannot take pvp damage. it would be a bit of a pain for players to find a server with an open workshop but that would be for them to figure out.
---
No. Nobody will love it. Your idea is terrible. Removing legendary effects would make the game useless. Why bother grinding. Why play? What motivations would I have to continue playing?
---
It's funny.  With all the tears people shed when it first disappeared; when the Blackbird skin was reintroduced for a limited time I saw no uptick in the number of Blackbird sightings in game.  Could be people just didn't apply it after purchase but I figured there would be hundreds of Blackbirds running around with all the posts begging for it to come back.
---
I did a BoS roleplay once, brought some new characters with my decked out toon for a "patrol" in survival mode during double exp weekend. Outfitted them with basic gear for their level and we basically just went around clearing out high level areas. Called it "live fire combat training". They would tag max level mobs and I would take them down with my bloodied heavy weapons character. We ran into a bunch of raiders and had some spectacular fire fights. Surprisingly we won more than we lost, even though we were all pve / new character builds facing off against ass/sent geared pvp builds.
---
I actually think pistols would be fairly viable with a Sneak/Covert Operative/Escape Artist setup.  I intend to toss the rest into 1x of each Gunslinger, 2x Action Girl, and Dodgy.
---
Minding posting your gunslinger build? I main one too.
---
Oh, I guess that part went over my head. I'm just a sucker for puns.
---
In NW, I'm almost Pacifist until I'm left with no choice.

What's the pun? 
---
Unless you are specifically talking about the Mandingo tribe in Africa, it's been a racist term for like 200 years
---
"Oh crap, its one of those freaks from 76, everybodyrunforyourlives!"
---
I've noticed this during moments when a lot of stuff is happening, like an SBQ battle, but not consistently.
---
I agree but I guess there’s just limitations
---
If Bethesda isn't making a SHITLOAD of hilarious/hatable/quirky/respectable/backwards NPCs then I'm going to fucking take over their company
---
I think this is a thing already?
---
I initially got that impression too, but considering the Overseer did the voice over for the Wastelanders trailer, I’d like to think that’s a pretty clear implication that she’s alive. After all, why would they have a dead character talk about the return of settlers to Appalachia?
---
Sure!

This is the current one. You can swap out lvl 3 grim reapers to a lvl 1 and pickup class freak if you so choose.

Isn't travel agent the travel reduce perk
---
It's really not so much an opinion as it is confirmation bias based on pure anecdotal evidence
---
The shopping mall in the Mire. That would make a really cool settlement and trading hub for late game.
---
Good luck. I created an account 3 years ago we mods came to console. Never received my email, but apparently my email is known in the system. I've clicked forgot password three times now on three separate days and they havent sent me that email yet either. Searched Bethesda in my gmail and nothing of the sort in 3 years. There website and account info is just as messed up as their engine and games..
---
"Have you heard?  I think they're reforming the Dawnguard"
---
Not sure how i missed it... thanks
---
Yup
---
I mean TSE's WERE overpowered. More than bloodied. Bloodied is like a 65% damage boost at most. TSE was double damage + double aoe damage. So you'd have a 100 damage weapon doing 100 base + 100 explosive x2 for 400 damage per shot. Add in Demo Expert and the explosive portion goes from 200 to 320, for 520 damage per shot, or a 520% damage increase. That's JUST from the weapon and base perks. Add in adrenal reaction, 2.3x stealth bonus, nerd rage, and now you're looking at truly absurd damage.
---
No my friend, Bloodied weapons are only a shadow of the power that TSE weapons were pre nerf. Pre-Nerf TSE was several orders of magnitude more powerful. A full adrenal build with all modifiers, chems, correct perks, running a TSE would demolish a SBQ in seconds, not several minutes.
---
I'll check it out!
---
Legendary creatures never, and I mean literally never, transform from a 1 star to a 3 star. You may get a 1 star from a 3 star creature but that was always going to be there
---
I have this same problem, I can’t remove a third floor half wall so I can replace with a full wall
---
I like the idea, tho I'd probably not have the chance bit in. You know... like the charisma perk travel agent for instance
---
You didn't use bane and inimical correctly
---
Good news! We already have throwable weapons. Now we just need those pictures...
---
That's exactly why I tried it.
---
&gt;With the amount of damage it does
---
Seems about right for a katana
---
oh man i lol'd on dsiconnectd! hahaha
---
I appreciate the help!  I think my problem was that I never actually verified my account initially
---
This absolutely needs to happen. It would be fantastic. Then every so often, switch a new piece of dialogue in, like "Happy Fasnacht", or something about meat. I would love it.
---
Right? Where's that stupendous smokey flavour we've learned to love? Maybe the electricity reacts poorly with the radiation that's in, well, everything!
---
Definitely the shopping mall in the Mire, that’d make a really cool settlement and/or trading hub
---
I use a 3* Bloodied Mole Miner Gauntlet as my daily driver.  I have things that do more damage, but the MMG is my favorite weapon simply because of how badass it looks.
---
I've done that,  and even crafted a completely new network with a full factory reset.
---
This would be excellent! When they're feeling abandoned, they get salty and start chasing people around to insult them!
---
Wow, that hurts. When that happens unplugging to from the wall usually fixes it
---
Idk man. Usually I agree that a lot of that word of mouth theories like that amount to little more then rumors or superstition at best. But It happened so often, I wish I had the foresight to take video. I'm still going to insist that I know what Ive seen, but also that you are smart to not take my word for it. Maybe you'll come across it yourself someday and decide for yourself. But it's at least worth it to wait a sec if you see a legendary spawn like that.
---
I mean, yeah? The laser musket has the highest base damage of any energy weapon(180), and energy weapons apply base damage to the DR calculation. Add two shot to that and you get something that can actually match the ER of tanky enemies.
---
That I didn't know and was wondering if it was the case.
---
But by all accounts, thats a problem with the game generally.
---
Definitely the shopping mall in the Mire, I think that’d make a really cool settlement
---
Carpets help with that (some).
---
The lack of Radium Rifle support is galling. Screw you Bethesda.
---
The torch light doesn't do it.
---
I had serious rubberbanding for the first time ever (since beta) the other day.  Luckily it went away after switching servers.  Sorry yours is persisting.
---
It's not a bug, you have to connect the 'inaccessible structure' to a temporary fundation, using stairs and floor as tools. Once it's connected you can scrap it all the way back.
---
Because some people decide to blow it up and it takes a lot of resources to fix
---
I don't play PvP, but I hope you get good results for your efforts. PvPers need a way to enjoy this game just as much as the rest of us. Keep organizing.
---
You dont want IE Lever just Instigating
---
They literally can. If you know that an event guarantees a three star legendary and you have the patience to not instantly kill whatever spawns you can literally sit there while it glows and watch the name updating from the standard name through each legendary tier. It's a bug caused by the server lagging while the enemy's tags are getting updated but it still happens. I literally watched it happen almost half a dozen times yesterday alone.
---
I'm actually a bit relieved. If you have this problem then it's not my system. I've got an overclocked 4690k, 1070ti, 32gb ram, and an M.2, so if you have this problem, I can hold off on an upgrade for just a leeeetle bit longer.
---
It must be their servers, then. I noticed someone else here saying they had the problem on PS4, so I guess we wait for Bethesda to sort it out...
---
Yeah, I wouldn't mind seing some known people coming back to Appalachia. I think the raider faction looks interesting but the "settlers" seem like one of the most uninspired faction they could have come up with.
---
I mean what are settlers even supposed to be? Isn't everybody a settler? they might aswell be called "some dudes".
---
Your bias isn't that duping exists, it's painting all of us who PvP with the same brush. Idgaf about those guys. I've never duped, never will because I actually enjoy the grind and hunt for gear. Acting like dupers were the only ones pvping in survival mode with any success is just flat out wrong. But idk, I guess because you saw some loudmouth dupers one time then obviously everyone does it.
---
We should rename the build Children of Atom build rather than Bloodied. 
---
If you think about it, it makes more sense because really only one item in the build has the Bloodied prefix, all the others have Unyielding, and you use Nerd Rage, Serendipity and Adrenal Reaction. But, you can't get any of that to work without the power of Atom. So why call it "bloodied build" if that's only one part out of many, when massive radiation makes it possible?
---
That’s a real bummer. I have had it drop me from the server two queens in a row in one day. Usually it will do that when people use a lot of laser weapons and explosive weapons. It seems like the server can’t handle all the animation. Keep your head up and try again launching nukes is fun!
---
I love the chainsaw... But at level 20 max with no legendary stars it's going to get you killed fast. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE Bethesda give the chainsaw some love!! You already gave it a flaming bow bar... Now all it needs is level 50 3* drops.... and perk card support of course.
---
I also noticed horrible servers and rubber banding, not/poor hit registration this weekend, im on ps4
---
Thanks for sharing, will try it out later
---
I've seen a couple of camps with inaccessible workbenches. I don't get why they would lock them away. I always make my workbenches, beds, and instruments as accessible as my vending machines.
---
How is it my fucking opinion that an enemy only drops items from the pool it's actually tagged to draw from? That's the basis for how every drop in this fucking game works.
---
It's all good. I'm not here to SJW. Its not like the n word in that it is automatically considered bad. 
---
And while I do doubt the dude originally used it with specifically racist intent, it was probably based on a misunderstanding of the phrase and its racist connotations and origin. 
---
It's like "1,2,3,4, catch a tiger by the toe". You don't get mad at a kid for that. They don't know better. 
---
But he in no way meant man-wendigo- which you are totally right would be really clever if it wasn't already a pejorative word.
---
LMG ain't too bad. It could do with some variety in attachments though. Same for Xbow and SAA.
---
*Especially* semi-autos.
---
First, play the damn game! The lack of NPCS is the story! You have to fix the problem that drew NPCs out! Once finished they will return (Wastelanders). Second, Nuclear winter, the lvl means nothing ... there are no mutations... only perk cards that are RNG.
---
Buy another game or stop your crying. Old news keep it moving
---
How can you do that?....... really tell me......
---
this is a good idea, congratulations
---
It's a subtle way to say you got screwed by the RNG.
---
Don’t touch my tools
---
Do what?  Keep people from blowing up my workshop?
---
Go west young man.
---
Why would you build in a Workshop?! He was talking about CAMPs...
---
The problem is that all revolvers are underpowered. 
---
Buffing the single-action like this would still make it inferior to the western. Since the western revolver isn’t a viable end game gun, this definitely won’t be.
---
I took off my mask when getting my photo taken for the Enclave and at the DMV. I just thought it would be that way in real life, so why nto there too. It's also the only time my character has been without his mask/helmet/something covering the face.
---
You cant destroy other people CAMPs unless you are in PVP...
---
It can be fixed
---
When going into nuclear winter all equipment, mutations, everything is taken away
---
You can get mutations in nuclear winter they're really common, just need to find radiation
---
"Third person peeking" everyone can do it, it's a classic component of games like pubg
---
Solo vs teams, I play solo almost every match and get 7th or higher, if you want a team don't turn off fill team
---
No, the workshop area of my CAMP.  Where I keep my weapons bench, armor bench...etc
---
thats, unfortunately, what she said
---
"Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter."
---
You can shoot down buildings!?
---
hello can u read my post and read what u said, DO U even notice what u said? u know what is balance?
---
If you're on xbox come and find me. I have marsupial and most of the other good ones for 250. GT is the same as my reddit name.
---
Yes I do realize that, I've managed to get a few legendary fixers in my 400 levels of playing. Also there are no legendary blunderbuss
---
so what? i cant have same mutations like high jump just after 1 minute, i need spend time for haveing that, but at the same time i play agains ppl who ACTUALLY have that.
---
so third person peeking its something normal then? ah i thought its pvp mode where skill mean everything for win. but no, u need have cancer way of play to win, its just peeking from rock or tree or anything else. seriously?
---
aha so playing solo against teams is also something normal? Im as new, fight with team of 4 ppl agains lonely me, its some kind of problem.
---
I was seeing this a lot a while back, and it was much more than 3-5 seconds, the last one I played, I was killed by 2 players in PA using Gatling guns as soon as I loaded, and before I was even able to move, I heard them run up and start shooting me while still looking at a black screen, I haven't been back since.
---
I'm on XBL (Xbox One X) and have a High Speed Fiber Optic Internet connection.
---
'What, this 50 Cal on my back? That's just my two shot explosive armor piercing assassin's increased VATS accuracy 5 star shotgun. (whatever VATS is) I keep it in case any of you vault dwellers try anything funny. *laughs* Not that I'll use it! I'll be using this default hunting rifle. But they'll find it on my body!
---
in·im·i·cal
---
/iˈnimək(ə)l/
---
adjective
---
tending to obstruct or harm.
---
"actions inimical to our interests"
---
So yeah, take your incorrect understanding of basic English and shove it right up your keister. Little guy.
---
I do this. I know it seriously slows me down for when I need to FT, but I think it's basic customer service to try and supply as many amenities as you can!
---
Except they still can. 
---
Notice that I don’t touch anyone in this clip, but am still killed. https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/mctrustypants/video/79366945
---
Most frustrating thing I’ve run into is items I place actually being placed underground to were I can’t reach them to delete them and they still take up camp budget. Had to move my camp from the rocks above the ammo factory  to Whitesprings just to delete those pesky objects and start fresh. And for the love of God the floating objects are disgusting in this game. I’m one of the people who’s super OCD about my CAMP even more so then I am about my IRL house, I can stand going to plant a simple melon without half the roots floating above the ground!
---
Im on PS4 and can make both
---
If anyone wants me to- KoreyAllen  and MoirasBioticPee 
---
Im on most days in the evening PST.
---
I'm on Xbox and I know the plan for both the witch and skeleton outfit. I'm planning on crafting a few to sell in a vending machine for Halloween. I'm not usually on until evening CST but shoot me a direct message and I can try to help you out sometime.
---
Have fun in the wastelands. Remember not all assholes are bad people, they’re just asshole
---
Also in the future you can just get a keycard and use the code from nukacrpyt.  You don't actually need to gather the code pieces to be able to launch.
---
Because I don't want strangers in my house?
---
I want an explosive blunderbuss SO badly
---
&gt;It is a fair Mode seing that frog legs is the only breaking card and it has been nerfed to hell... Also I repeat Perk cards are RNG you can find a lvl 300 with worse perks then you.
---
again. i recommend you read my post completely
---
Yes, you can have marsupial within a minute, just like anyone else can
---
It's just part of the game, again you can do it too, not something worth even having feelings about
---
And yeah, hide, hunt, take out a person and disappear, like you're The Predator, you can even get an invisibility mutation
---
I did my share of this, yes, but it was because of trying to avoid the personal 3-hour cooldown. Obviously, when you're doing high volume SBQ runs, the 3 hour cooldown per silo gets in the way, that's why having friends do them was important. I still group with friends and we "take turns" on the weekend.
---
Season 11 of Fortnite is starting any day now. Just make sure you make a post about leaving and how bad the game is or we might never know you left.
---
It's one more thing they can sell that people will buy off of their love of the old DLCS/Characters. Not everybody, maybe not 25% of the community but it's something that some people are gonna buy and they need those some peoples money to get all the money they can to make good free DLCs
---
I love stories like this
---
I have, you are still conplaining about frog legs being a mutation and how unfair it is that a High level player has it and you dont... Still you can get it on lvl 2.
---
Would love a comment about how many caps dwellers just carry around with them
---
Simply not true. 
---
Automatic weapons have much lower VATS cost. Furthermore, the gatling uses roughly the same amount of AP as the western revolver (with the same damage and 5x the fire rate)
---
Damn, been trying that. Guess I'll keep trying.
---
Yeah, but then you're burning 3 perk points for class freak.
---
Tbh I love the scorch beast for doing that but that time it was the Grafton monster that did it lol
---
I know because I saw it maul the person from the Bush I was hiding in
---
Okay thanks alot bro really helped since I spent a total of two days on trying to decrypt it. The words were wrong yadda yadda
---
I cant post a picture on this sub
---
I don’t really like raider stuff, but I’m loving the waster armor for my scavenger themed character.
---
That's a good point but I probably tried about 100 servers over the last few days.  That may have played a role in some of them.
---
does it work on excavation armor?
---
You might be reading a little too far into it. If you think Bethesda is romanticizing Raiders too much, just wait till you see what they've done regarding encouraging the use of nuclear weapons
---
I think you have to stand on top of it
---
ROFLMAO!!!
---
Are you or anyone around you using the raid Power Armor?
---
Except you can prove it because these enemies aren't spawning as legendary enemies in the first place. Everyone claims that a legendary spawns as a specific tier of legendary and that's it, not seeing the stars yet is just a visual glitch and it always has the three star loot pool. Except if you kill an enemy while it's glowing but hasn't gained a single star yet what do you get? Nothing, because it wasn't tagged as a legendary enemy yet. The same logic goes for mutating through the tiers. If a glowing legendary only has one star when you kill it then at that instant it is only tagged to draw from the one star pool, if you wait and let all three stars update then you draw from the three star pool. People don't notice shit like this because even at 1000 hours when you see a legendary what do you do? You kill it asap. Waiting for the boss at AWOL to update to three stars can take a good 30 seconds at least because of the lag.
---
I’m logging on now, I’ll check fast.
---
It's not as fast/weak as the minigun, but it does feel like it does too little for the ammo. My favourite heavies are the harpoon and the gatling gun. LMG is third up.
---
&gt;especially considering how expensive .308 ammo is to make.
---
Yeah. The ammo crafting costs are all over the damn place. I use .50 on my hunting rifle and barely use my LMG because of .308 costs. It's wack.
---
Me too.  50/50 fiber link.  Its not speed internet speed and its not my computer.  Something is amiss.
---
Liberal application of high explosives and lead
---
Yep, it works on all versions of PA. I have it on my Excavator (run a mix/match with waster, scabbar, and red paint).
---
Yeah because I can go entire days without any issues then when I hit certain areas with people around an I see they are wearing the armor an the acid dmg starts procing immediately start rubber banding. Check the map when it happens if you see people near you its probably the issue. Does it happen a lot or just at random times?
---
Thanks alot man, i still have 11 mins for the bone raider sale if it wont work on excavation
---
I wish I could give this post an award. I know that camp restrictions have been the bane of players and I also know that a few patches back, Bethesda did actually relax some restrictions specific to foundations but a couple of days ago, I too had to tear down and start over because of some illogical bullshit I got myself into after replacing a floor piece and stairs.
---
pubg have 1 pesrson mode and have option for solo, duo or squad. in f76 cancer 3person and solo players  playing against team players, best game eva.
---
Wait, you put a recipe for jet, but there isn't? Or did their used to be one before the lore break of jet
---
Glad that there's not much new stuff. Means I can save up more atoms for the inevitable Halloween items.
---
I live in New York.  A five second delay for routers to release me would cause so much lag to play.  I wonder if this is another cheating program.  It overides servers release time.  Hmm.
---
I have a sneaky suspicion that op is either trolling or just doesn't know what he's on about
---
Thank you good sir
---
 At level 111 I do not carry a pistol. I did till about level 90 odd. Now as all I see are max level whatevers, and they are not impressed by my 100 odd hit Revolver. Its just weight now.
---
 Wes Tek I do with a Combat Knife, its so much fun.
---
ofc 3rd person and solo vs teams is very balanced.
---
I've seen people selling for 100 caps lately, but I've also been hesitant on all these 100-150 cap mutations because of all the duping. If you're on Xbox, go to the club section and looking for group, and usually there's 20 people selling serums dirt cheap.
---
He bought the game recently and started playing with a grudge... This is the result... He is one of the die Hard haters that bought the game... He is still complaining about NPCs FFS... I bet he is a lvl 5
---
&gt; Wes Tek I do with a Combat Knife, its so much fun. 
---
Ye. I have a BSS combat knife ninja. It's bit boring though. Stealth so broken.
---
That’s not the last tape. She gets attacked and runs out of stims
---
Hope he finds a game that makes him happy, he's not enjoying 76
---
Hell yea good idea 
---
Like city guards from skyrim
---
i have about 40 ant kills lmao, that ones gonna take years imo.
---
best i have found is 3 rad ants at the start of washouts residential, right out the door on your way up the steps
---
I have 2 of them aswell..
---
Yep. The wiki for FO3 and NV was so good. Detailed lore and locations for any item in the game. Even bug workarounds.
---
The 76 wiki is super lacking and mostly copy and paste work from FO4.
---
This is a problem with agile development and very common
---
Yeah it seems the only new items are the free ones
---
If I recall, Governor Evans went missing after the bombs dropped- not confirmed to be dead.
---
Because is unlock-able via kills in Nuclear winter.
---
*acid effect
---
Convert caps to 5.56 ammo. That seems to be how many people bypass the cap limits that are high end traders.
---
Same here but this whole thread is about the water pump being below par. Something crafted shouldn't be less efficient then without it.
---
Y E S
---
That would be a great side quest “Secret of the Ooze.” 
---
“Find the source of the mysterious slime.”
---
Anyone can do 3rd person so I don’t really understand your point. Seeing as anyone can freely switch between 1st and 3rd person... yes is balanced. And again you choose if you want to play solo or on a team. I have won on both. Solo may be a little more challenging, but it depends on your play style.
---
Honest answer at least for me; I have a full set of T-60 painted in it but as my main set is what I wear most and it's in BoS colours, I just forget to swap for others I have in my stash. 🤷🏻‍♀️ If I do remember I go for the Blackbird set as I was resigned to it being gone forever so it was nice it returned. Plus black and red are such a great combo not too different from my Paladin colours. 
---
Sometimes there is such a thing as too much choice.
---
I like how the pa skins resemble the four horsemen
---
Btw I am so glad you created this account yesterday just to post this
---
It's not easy to get kills in NW too. You don't kill dozens of player in NW, only very skilled players consistently get kills. It just shows that most people are bad at NW as well, as they are in the base game.
---
I like how they made the PA skins resemble the four horsemen
---
I highly agree, but Bethesda already commented on display cases and camp budget saying they have to do it that way. It was one of the inside the vaults and was passive agressive lol I'm hoping they increase budget maybe
---
Equip the Scrapper perk, and maximize your INT value with food, chem, and even mutation items. 
---
High INT improves plan discovery while scrapping, and Durability when crafting.
---
I just want one to say, "I don't remember eating any corn."
---
I have the same issue.
---
I made this big 2 story house that even had a little Hotel type room in it. Ran out of budget space so tore down the 2nd floor. But because of that restriction I have a set of stairs that won't go away and it's really annoying. I tried to place somewhere else with no luck
---
&gt; with a grudge
---
pfff with grudge? all what i feel iыs rofling on blind and dump ppl who dont see obvious problems. and even protect such things. (I don’t hint at anyone, all coincidences are random.)
---
“I used to be a vault dweller like you, then I took a crossbow bolt to the knee.”
---
Yea true water pump is supposed to be a pain and i agree with the buffed new water production ideas. Itd still be considered a water pump buff because the point of buffing the water pump is to get dirty water without the hassle of going to a stream.
---
It's also a subtle way for Todd Howard to get his daily laugh.
---
Haha, yep, been doing that too
---
Yeah
---
With a lot of new items being temporary, and so many items leaving, they're really getting down to bare bones right now.
---
I just chalk it up to lag and connection speeds.  Some people have just have better internet.
---
Agreed on the Horsemen,I been wonderin for awhile if they where gonna re-release em...
---
As I wasn’t playing when they did the first time,
---
I’ll probably spend actual RL money for the Atoms too buy em,I just dig em.
---
Yes ^^^^^^
---
"Some  dwellers speak of a giant monster and that they killed it to and have been tracking it for months hmmm... they called it sheep.... sheep something  i don't really know"
---
You dont point the obvious problems... Like atomic shop utilities, glitchs and lack of events... You point hater problems like lack of NPCS and NW in general...
---
Yeah they released them way back in the day but I can't remember if they were bundles or not
---
Just do what I do and decorate with the skeletons from your victims. Makes for a great spooky decor! 😁
---
Nuclear Winter is well-balanced. As in, the guys that do the NW balancing should be in charge of the overall balancing.
---
I am level 92.  Almost 100.  2 hours a day.  Hide, hit and run.  Dont stay in one spot.  I play 100% sniper.  Usually make it to end, but depends on final location of circle and how many teams are left.
---
I have 3 lvls in NW and even I managed a positive KD in NW.
---
I'm level 94 currently and have been playing since the mode launched but have seen players well over level 200, which is just insane to me. 
---
If you're not so good but on a good team, they can help carry you into the top ten, even to overseer status. Always hug the edge of the map and alwayd expect players to be just around the corner. Also, always be near cover or try to maintain the high ground. If you can, build a good blueprint in adventure mode that you can camp in and wait it out until the end. Sometimes I would use my camp as bait. I would build my blueprint over a steep ledge, (this is where floating camps come in handy), and as soon as I see players enter the structure I would move my camp and watch them fall to their death. You don't get XP for downing them, but it's pretty funny to watch. 
---
If you want to reach level 100, take full advantage  of any double XP events Bethesda offers and grind the NW game mode. Also choose a perk layout that compliments your playstyle. I play master commando with tank killer and ground pounder, and I also have demolition expert with frog legs and bloody mess. Every perk I have equipped allows me to do as much damage as possible with my weapon of choice. Plus I throw on lifegiver for an extra 45 HP. If I want to go full explosives, I'll take off ground pounder for grenadier. Chems are also good buffs if you remember to take them.
---
What type of hard drive is your game on?
---
Turn on pacifist.
---
Opening the map, and quickly closing it at the black screen before loading can sometimes let you start  immediately.
---
Stay tuned. On thursday they'll talk about their Halloween seasonal event, which will no doubt include a bunch of camp decorations, costumes, and atom shop content.
---
I got it without needing to stand on it.
---
How many days
---
Minding your own business and one shotting you? I don't think so! That's not how PvP works, and if it's the mutations starting PvP then that's your problem right there. 
---
Bloodied builds already have many bugs to inconvenience us, like having no respawn points causing loss of loot bags. Taking our rads won't solve your problem because we use Toxic Goo for 125 instantly. If you have issues with Bloodied builds in PvP, use executioners or Gamma guns.
---
I was just on the ground looking up at it.
---
Ye standing next to can work as well
---
Months.
---
Odd. Definitely tried that. Might not have been on top enough. Will try again and delete thread if needed after.
---
Noticed this playing side by side with my brother. I thought it was because I have a newer one S and he has the previous model..?
---
Mule GT ? On PC ?
---
I agree with the assultron head, but as one of the three sniper builds on Xbox over level 100, I have every perk for rifles, rifleman, bloodymess, tank killer, and I have killed I think only one person with thrnguass rifle, now say if it’s the scoped lever I can easily drop 10 plus kills with it (most I have gotten with it is 15), the scoped lever does more damage and shoots faster due to the lack of charging
---
Who are you to dictate who is welcome to post on the Sub.  You are not a moderator. 
---
All I see from your post is crying that you got ganked in NW.  Well, thats part of the game.   You want mutations and gear, in NW you  have to find it.  You dont get to start with everything you want.  thats the part of NW people like you dont get.  You are not disadvantaged other than you havent been playing it since it launched so may not know where all the gear stashes are, or hiding places.   
---
Pissed off that people use 3rd person to peak around corners.   Guess what, you can do that too.  You just choose not to.
---
also in NW, you get placed in a team of 4.  OMG random team that you dont know.   Maybe try to be social and meet some friends so you dont have to be solo all the time.  I know its hard sometimes for people to actually talk to other people, its not your normal since there is no screen, you actually have to use words from your mouth.
---
We are truely sorry that Fallout 76 is not PuBG and plays differently, with different rules.  Who would have thought that a different game had different rules.   
---
Go back to PuBG.
---
I smell some buuuuullll shit
---
Lol yeah I understand having too many choices fully.  I only carry one PA and loathe to use it even though I'm hvy weapons. But I have 6 skins I really like and swap out on that frame nightly even if I only pull out the PA for the queen and ISS maybe every other or every third night.  Just figured there would've been a fotm fashion show at the queen when Blackburd came back around like when Liberty Prime came out.  🤷‍♂️
---
I like the Waster since it does work on all PA pieces so if you like to mix and match you can still have a set. I have the Bone one too I like the helmet haha
---
I thought this was patched.  Can someone second this?
---
Not your what?
---
They were released one at a time. When one’s timer expired, the next one was up the following day.
---
1/1000 is also a positive number. What's your point?
---
In the more recent games including 76, plasma is half ballistic and half energy. I forgot about the harpoon and broadsider, they're kind of outliers. There is no semi-auto big gun grenade launcher, and the missile launcher and auto-grenade launcher are affected by the explosive perk not big guns. The big gun perk description even says it's for non-explosive big guns. The plasma rifles from Fo1/Fo2 are not the plasma rifles we see now, they're different. The Fo1 plasma rifle was originally going to be called plasma caster anyway. When they brought it back in NV they went with that name because there was another plasma rifle by then but the model of the NV/76 plasma caster looks very similar to the Fo1/2 plasma rifle, it's the same weapon if we're talking about lore.
---
Perhaps.
---
Based on your thread title I thought you meant for NPCs to use bloodied melee builds and one-shot players.
---
So because we like something different than you do, we have no taste?
---
I can say the same about you.
---
Yet another Vaulting sale and two pages worth this time. So annoying.
---
If you're not a bloodied build, you may want to avoid dodgy if you're going stealth. First off,if you got a silencer ,high agility , and sneak perks you probably won't need the survivability of  dodgy. And if you're sneak does fail,depending on your enemies around you ,dodgy can drain your AP so friggin fast . Being a vats heavy build it's going to really nullify your damage you can do and you're going to have to beat feet and try to get the drop on them again if they don't kill ya first. I learned the hard way lol.
---
Looks like we need horses now.
---
If you that explaining then I can’t help you.
---
im more and more convinced that f76 players cant use own brains. ok i will explain. problem of 3rd person is that u have a big advantage because of PEEKING u dont need be face to face to ur enemy because u can simply hide behind tree and just use ur 3rd person to find ur enemy when at same time ur enemy will not even know that u hide behind tree, is it so hard to understand? and that's can be easily fixed by first person camera only. and then everyone will be in the same conditions. this is the balance.
---
oh yea i can choose play team or solo, but if i choose play solo i will still play again players who will be in teams.
---
This is still bugged after all this time, the video is broken and they hardly do any damage at all
---
They've been emptying the vault for almost two months now. It's the longest and slowest vault sale I've ever seen.
---
When are they gonna bring back things? The vault tec bomber jacket has been absent since May.
---
Oh yeah, I'm pretty boring when it comes to my PA paint choices but outfits and camp items are where I use my Atoms even although I wear PA almost all the time for one character and the other one I have, she will only wear it for blast zones. I have my favourites in PA paint and tend to stick to those. I won't really buy them unless they do wow me.
---
I’m guessing some Halloween gear is gonna hit next week or the following one, but the earlier they can add it the better!
---
They are still in the game. People hoard stuff from the dev room
---
I'm not a huge fan of the AS but I'll buy the hell out of some placable pumpkins
---
Just remove the requirement for a foundation - or just use FO4 coding.
---
Though I dont agree with the sentiment of why because if I dont want to PvP I just turn on pacifist. I do like the sound of a blood transfusion syringer. I think it's under utilized and has all sorts of great potential. It could be used on healers or even like the OP stated in PvP situations to push bloodied builds out of their damage threshold. Almost like a twist on suppressor.
---
Yeah they should be slowly adding them since they only seem to wana add a few things at a time. If they start next week that means the Halloween items will litterally only be truly relevant for a little over 2 weeks.. just seems odd to me.
---
None. I don't  rider or raider.
---
What are these things you speak of lol
---
I didn't get loot from my own first Queen either, but I had joined some other Scorched Earth events before and got loot from a couple of those.
---
Same problem for me, the game pretty much froze when everyone started shooting (though I blame my potato PC and bad internet connection), so I didn't get a bullet in during the last phase. Staying away from the immediate battle and sniping her from a distance helped a lot, though.
---
There's always another nuke and another Queen.
---
Irradiate or burn! No electrics!
---
The link doesn't work for me (mobile app)
---
Also have excavator highlight ore like targeting hud
---
PC!
---
omg so toxic community, get well.
---
Weird? Works for me?  [https://imgur.com/gallery/wgRcLMe](https://imgur.com/gallery/wgRcLMe)
---
That would only work if Bethesda allowed a trade system that allows direct trade of items. Like it was in fallout 3 and 4. It is stupid you have can only trade items for a cap price.
---
Brilliant, thank you!
---
Madigan is currently unknown. They recently updated the body at Top of the World - the body no longer belongs to Madigan. I suspect he has been brought back to life.
---
Strange..
---
 Also heard that if you accidentally find the dev room, that shouldn't be possible anymore, your character and your penni..... is auto changed / shrunke'd to a lv1 and corrupted ?  :D
---
new stimpack stronger than supers confirmed?
---
Just lure a scorchbeast over and it'll open the door for ya
---
How do you have an advantage by using 3rd person if your opponent also can use 3rd person? Lol
---
Other then finding the plans on the truck or treaters the witch outfit can be bought from the randomly spawning Responder Vendor Bot.  The skeleton outfit can spawn in the lookout tower with all of the Halloween decoration.l and it can also spawn the hats... sorry I don’t remember the name of it.
---
I was also hoping the they would actually include some of the Halloween stuff earned through in game not atom shop. Seeing as supposed to be an event. They really should be including some stuff through in game as well as atom shop.
---
Why would Mountainside be the last tape and not Nuke Launch?
---
It happens alot on xbox1 aswell
---
I have no idea... but it is
---
nope sorry
---
I love the weapon. But boy, it is only good for 5 enemies or less. My gunslinger carries a baseball bat and high strength because reloading Is not an option. 
---
If I ever find a quad anti-armor, I will store my instigating limb damage reduced weight western revolver. Good firearm.
---
Sorry, maybe you’re right. I’ll just turn on pacifist.
---
The thing is that people keep attacking and claiming my workshops and don’t even use them. I can’t really avoid them because my turrets attack when they do. I can’t fast travel, I can’t really run away since I have a hoarder build. Anyway thanks
---
War Rider &lt;3 just because I'm a T-45 fanboy and love the look of it
---
What did you expect.  You came in here toxic, bashing the game we all love. 
---
Did you think we would welcome you with open arms and give you our firstborn daughters?
---
If you walk into a church and start telling people Jesus is an asshole and they were all going to hell, do  you think they would be nice to you?
---
Thanks, I'll give it a go!
---
Works for me. Love it!
---
your link needs a slash at the end, then it works :)
---
I would to see the Prydwen get bombed XD
---
It might be honestly.
---
I load into the game fine.  See trees and bushes, for about 3 to 4 seconds.  I hear movement and my hard drive does not cycle.  Its just that my controls are not released.   I hear the vault overseer talking to me.  When he finishes, i am released.
---
Do you have proof for that? I don't think it makes much sense that Mountainside is the last tape, it'd make much more sense if she recorded it shortly before or after discovering Site Charlie, definitely prior to Nuke Launch. And she didn't seem particularly weakened or hurt in any of these.
---
Yea I think there was an influx of people running the raids since it was the last day. Oh well here's to better luck for this week and hopefully a patch sooner than later!
---
Some items can be built, some are not permitted. Usually all atom shop items cannot be built on another camp, unless Bethesda made a mistake. And sometimes they do. For example the garden domes.
---

---
While I'm glad I have the 3 that I have, I no longer use any of them. Just make sure that's legitimate disposable income if you're going to drop the 18x4
---
I got that achievement by killing three random people who went wanted after doing something stupid, and then the other 17 times, I killed my friend, all in the space of about 10 minutes.
---
Why is it always raider stuff? I just want some cool responder outfits!
---
It very much matters where you stand, if it doesn't take move around and get a different perspective,  here are a couple of examples. One is next to the Giant Tea Pot, the other is at Big B's Rest Stop ( where the Super Duper Mart is in the Mire) [https://imgur.com/a/15PAAwy](https://imgur.com/a/15PAAwy)
---
Well, Workshops are PvP beacons on purpose. Pacifist mode does not protect you at a workshop, and you won't be able to fight back. Honestly workshops have medium amounts of resources, and it's better to farm.
---
If you like hoarding I suggest finding good farming locations rather than PvP workshops. There comes a point when you need to rebuild your character's inventory and find out how to stash everything. Maybe extra characters?
---
Can you wear a hat with the Skull Mask?
---
Works for me. And I love that we can see the art and better visualize the voices. Keep up the good work!
---
Yup. That's why I just said stand on top. If the picture itself has no value. Like urs are done nicely. I just did it for the challenge so just stood on top
---
Could be but I didn't mean it like that. To be honest. Now I remember I have that game in my library yet when I had it gifted by my brother my system couldn't handle it. But I do have a new system now. I really got to check that game out. I just kinda forgot about it.
---
Are we even getting Halloween items? It's already Oct. 8. I'm ready, man. &lt;/3
---
Just changed the link since Imgur is having issues. Check it now. :)
---
Play with random teammates, and use emotes to ensure everyone stays together. A teambuilder if you will. If you find a teamate with a mic (or even a good teamplayer without one) send them friend requests so you can team up again in the future. You'll have a team of 4 people in no-time, and you will win games. Practice will ensure you get 6+ kills per game which gives even more XP. This way, you get the most XP and won't burn out by hiding in a bush (which is boring and cowardly af imo).
---
When they have their vendors outside, but crafting benches locked up, that's an instant skip for me. I'm supposed to buy stuff from you given complete lack of hospitality? Forget it.
---
Its the only skin I have for my excavator armor. And the only one I need.
---
If anyone wants to check out the podcast this art is based on, you can check it out here:  [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLad-H\_JGTzL6y3Bz0yjosrXTGk9QPo7Sv](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLad-H_JGTzL6y3Bz0yjosrXTGk9QPo7Sv)
---
Ahh yeah that one is working, nice art indeed!
---
Another one for Bethesda please.
---
110 pvp damage cap. 
---
I don't need bloodied to hit that cap and that cap can't one shot you if you have full health.
---
I think he got sick of hearing Rose's voice all day.
---
I don't understand locked anything. My camp, collectors, and purifiers are always unlocked and I always get plenty from them while still sharing.
---
I think "Just stand on top" though could confuse some people though, I found having a wider angle shot that got most of the station in the picture was more likely to succeed. 
---
That said your post did make me realize it was a matter of positioning so thanks for posting!
---
how do they know how it was at beta if they bought it now?
---
Yeah this espesically sucks when your trying to create a house that uses the landscape. However if one little tree branch or log is in the way your outta luck. 
---
Get rid of camp restrictions!
---
I DRINK IT!!
---
You are missing something, the fact that this company does not care enough about their consumers. 
---
Seriously, they don't give a shit. And if any employee would to speak out about this shitty game, then they would get fired. Because in america, you only have free speech as far as your wallet.
---
The super mutants that regularly spawn at Creekside sundew grove can sometimes have a legendary, so I just lured it to the nearby fissure site close enough.
---
Well atleast if you start reloading it now, your grad kids would be there when you finally finish...
---
I would say 5c is good price and 10c for those really in need of it
---
I finally moved away from a water source to fully build a raider camp and it's so inconvenient. Now whenever I need to make ballistic bock I goto the farm workshop, claim it, set up cooking and crafting stations and do it there. So annoying.
---
oh dont worry, the dupers are making sure everyone has strangler armor and a BE gatling plasma. I see them constantly nowadays. 76 is really slipping, Dev room items are widespread and duping has returned AGAIN since meat week.
---
Hell yes. I already rebuild and moved my camp to make it halloween themed and I need some things that other people don't already have!
---
i wasnt toxic from my topic, i point obvious problems of this game, but not for u and this community who come here and with foam in the mouth they try to prove to me anything in defense of this “game” without having any normal argument.
---
I see to npc venders for 6 caps per.
---
What sucks is when they change these rules months after you've built something. For example i have a foundation base from back in the day. However now i can't remove any of the foundations because all of them are floating. So now im stuck with my mistakes and have to incorporate them into the build. 
---
We really need a destroy feature that ignores rules.
---
Do they all work for excavator (only PA i use) or just one?
---
Rubberbanding is not the only issue.
---
I launched into orbit last night on SBQ.  I jumped up and hit my jetpack for a moment to clear the edge of D9.  Instead of floating effortlessly onto the top of the bunker, I launched into orbit.   It rocketed me so high i stopped seeing players.
---
Took me a good 10 seconds to fall back down.  It was pretty freaky.
---
How about a toxic goo stronger mod to give them more rads. Bloodied builds are usually pretty low health from rads already so any weapon that adds more rads is going to be pretty effective against them. I think 125 rads would be a bit high though so maybe cut it down to 50 rads or so with no other damage
---
I would assume is reduces your Total but could be wrong.
---
I saw someone selling a bunch for 150 each and bought all the ones I use just in case I get a bad mutation and have to purge or if accidentally lose one.
---
I was trying to upload a picture. But ye I was saying Stand on the gas signage. I edit it to say stand by or near. Hope it helps
---
Thanks for the heads up.
---
Oops, not everyone has the same interests as you, what a shame. 
---
My flower wallpaper will look great with my princess bed &lt;3
---
Thank you.
---
Disappointing offerings (IMO), was really hoping for Halloween theme items, but thankful for the update.
---
The only time I sold mine was 6c per cherry. But now I would rather use cola nut and tank the pylons on Encryptid.
---
One of my favorite skins is the WV skin.  Haven't seen it on a other player yet and it's really kinda dope especially on the xo1 and T51.  Their screenshots in the atomic shop really do it no favors.  I got it cause I wanted a hideous skin but the jokes on me lol
---
Nah there's just nothing you can pick up. Place looks cool though
---
Cool! I get to save my atoms for another week.
---
I don't use a Bloodied build, so many disadvantages. I like to summon the entire horde at the Golf Club as its quicker than chasing them around, and knife em' all. That costs about 1/3 of my health. ;)
---
Bro, you are a life saver thanks
---
With the right combinations it's possible to get an INT value around 40, but that includes the Egghead mutation (+6) and various 3* armor pieces that provide a +1 INT 
---
Remember that taking more than one Chem cancels the previous effect, so just use Daddy-O (+3) instead of Mentats (+2), and a food item like Brain Bombs (+3), along with an INT Bobblehead (+2) 🤔
---
Can vouch easy to build floating camps, Bethesda went the middle route to try and appease everyone but failed. Remove restrictions so we can build right!
---
So the recipe for jet? Where is this in the game because I don’t believe it is/should be
---
That's what happens when you drink Nukashine at Silva Homestead.
---
Yea foundation are the worse!
---
The atomic shop skull mask? Yes.  But sadly you can't wear it with a bandanna around your mouth.
---
kek man, are u really dont see obvious things and i should explain everything for u on fingers as for kid? okay no problemo.
---
u comeing from border of zone to center of zone for example, i was luck enough and next zone drops on me and i right in center, then i thought, oh nice i will hide near that big tree and use third person for find ppl to kill, and right at that moment u come and u cant hide because border is close, and 3rd person will not help u to know that im hiding behind that tree what just in front of u.
---
Was worse in beta lol. Literally added roof last because it would throw my power armor station on top of my roof.
---
get dark underarmor like the black fisherman's outfit and a black cover like the black trucker hat
---
I want princess bed ;( 
---
And pink heart wallpaper.
---
 My Handmade and of course my Lever Action. My Handmade is Explosive among other things and the Lever Action instigates.
---
 Now it starts, I think with 3 more than the base but I don't see that as being enough to use one. The other buffs at least are useful to some people.
---
We will more than likely get them next week, or the week before Halloween saddly. Which is a terrible time to add them. I've been seeing Halloween stuff in stores for the last 2 months. We should have atleast a few items by now
---
Haha, raiders with marsupial bouncing around.
---
I'd be down for this.
---
Are these camera photos or photo mode?
---
need...pumpkin head helmet....its spooky time soon!
---
So true! This needs to be done!
---
I hope so! Halloween is a full month event in same parts!!
---
5-10 caps seems to be a good sweet spot for sales
---
Is there a link to this info somewhere?
---
Same with the heart wall paper! Also, I'm fairly certain the yellow flower wallpaper has been in Helvetia homes since day one lol. It's nothing new.
---
Roving bands of Marsupial Men hopping around like idiots across the wasteland. I like it.
---
What thumbs up emote, there's a new one?
---
Glad I could be of some assistance
---
No one wants you smelly rift raft rummaging through their stuff. 🤢
---
To clarify:. When you say you share the camp; do you mean share an account, or one of you doesn't have a camp?  Atomshop items almost always can't be built outside account owners base.
---
Hopefully it's a sign that there will be a lot of new things added next week, I'm just about raidered out at this point.
---
That explains how I randomly found a sturdy raider limb plan in my inventory. Distinguished Guests is the only event I did that day.
---
It is not available. Thank you for the catch. I'll fix the list.
---
"I saw a man in a clown costume down 7 feral ghouls with a rocket powered sledgehammer! and he walked off like nothing happened!"
---
"Lemme tell yah, i never thought i'd see the day where a man has tamed a deathclaw sitting right outside the door to his bar, what kind of crazy is able to do that?"
---
"These other groups dont seem to have an official heirarchy, everyone is wearing that damn brotherhood elder garb!"
---
"(Military survivor) wasnt the T-60 only distributed to the boston area?"
---
Just imagine enemies with the electrically charged and unstable isotope mutations messing you up when you melee them.  Or even having chameleon snipers 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Omfg you just saved Bethesda thousands of dollars in scrip-writing. They'd be fools not to implement this!
---
The last line of last week's [Inside the Vault](https://bethesda.net/en/article/4QeLrJadNmlc5kduJiBGy8/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-project-clean-appalachia-updates): *"Our next big update, Patch 14, is coming to the Fallout 76 later this month. Stay tuned for more details on what’s in store with the patch, including a mischief-filled new Seasonal Event."*
---
That’s messed up and I approve lmao.
---
I know I won’t convince you, but ever since I first heard this come up several months ago, I began to one-shot every legendary I saw while it was still glowing green. I wanted to see if the story was true. I only did this if no one else was present. 
---
Twice at Uranium fever, once at AWOL and once at the NAR repair yard, I got three star items. Every time, the legendary was still glowing brightly when I killed it. 
---
In my opinion the myth is busted.
---
....later this month... :(
---
About 6 months ago I built a CAMP with a branch going through a window.  It added character to the CAMP.   I then accidentally moved it.   
---
I tried rebuilding in the same spot but it won't let me place the window with the branch going through it.  So somewhere they added more collisions with the surrounding terrain making it harder to build complex CAMPs.
---
Its frustrating for those of us who like to build.
---
RIGHT?
---
Also just either get rid of the timer or triple the time we have to complete rooms
---
Yeah, it is sad. We could have legendary game, but we have atleast common game.
---
problem is that game was released in statement what it is now, because its empty world without interesting story where u should find things to do by urself, its like u pay money and implement things to do by urself kek, understand man? u get scammed.
---
and another one problem is ppl like u who bought such game, play in that and even blind enough for protect such products, because of players like u we have games like last Ghost Recon and so on.
---
You think it makes more sense that she almost dies... then suddenly, without any explanation, is perfectly fine afterward?
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/3Zqzt1A](https://imgur.com/a/3Zqzt1A) 
---
these are the 4th and 5th star legendaries for weapons and armor
---
I use the Grape version with Cola-nut. I forget the exact numbers, but something like 400 health and 1200 rads removed at full perk rank?  Only have to carry a few at a time.
---
Really want that BOS Flag
---
press ctrl + tab to open the social menu while loading in. Then when the screen goes black. Press escape.   
---
This has been around since the start. It allowed players to start even faster than those pressing escape twice.  
---
Bethesda know about it and hopefully they won't take months to remove this exploit.
---
Still no Nuka Cola fridge, I shall remain fridgeless then.
---
It’s an easy set up with the pumpkin house and Freddy fear’s house of scares near each other — a quest or event that links the two would be sick.
---
Lol because it is every Youtubers opinion
---
You dont have the game dont you?
---
Really? I have a shotgun build, and this has not been my experience. Tell me about your shotgun(s)? And which perks wprl6best for you?
---
You aren’t making any sense. If both people hve access to 3rd person... it’s balanced. Just because you apparently aren’t very good at the mode doesn’t mean it’s unbalanced lol. Learn to use 3rd person effectively like everyone else.
---
Int doesnt give extra experience anymore from what I heard
---
A Fixer with the same legendary effects will always outdamage a handmade.  The handmades only advantage is a larger capacity stinging mag. .45 also weighs less.  I love my BE and B33  handmade, but Fixers are pretty sweet, just much harder to aquire.
---
Camera, and the name of the creature(s) has to pop up in the top right corner before you take the picture. Dead or alive!
---
I got one floor piece backward in my one-piece-wide hallway, and it won't even let me rotate it because of the inaccessible structure rule.
---
I think it’s just random, another time you could get it and him not 😊
---
That's determination! Oh yeah? Then I'll PUNCH you to death, you big screaming bat thing, you!
---
i wish there was a plan for the flamer mod for the chainsaw
---
.50 cal seems to do the trick. Took a couple down with relative ease
---
That was my first thought, as well. Although Dragonrend would be more effective, I suppose. But few things are more spectacular than watching someone fly through space...
---
Back in the day when I played Asheron's Call, the dev's used to run events where they controlled the mobs and attacked populated area's. Many of us recieved special drops from the mobs and the dev's signed them for us. 
---
Was a blast attacking 10 story tall cyclops and super fast rabbits.
---
They haven’t released a raider bundle though. They brought out the 4 horseman PA skins again as well as a few other items.
---
Since it's pc only it's probably to deal with some dev room stuff ;)
---
This one I love. How f’n deep does it have to go in the ground!!!?!??!?
---
I notice a lot of delays with interacting with objects, like terminals. Takes a second or so for the terminal entry to load, or the object to react (was really noticable last night when I was doing Motherload quest on my alt).
---
Sad thing is there are existing plans for the flamer and long bow bar, but none are made available to drop.
---
So much about the constant nuking
---
Bloodied benefits from low health.  Rads are just a way to get health to a set level.  
---
If you heal rads but not health, it does exactly jack shit to the damage output of a bloodied build.  If the other guy had 18% health before you heal his rads, he still has 18% after and his damage is unchanged.  
---
Meanwhile you could have KILLED him with 1 shot from a decent weapon, because bloodied is amazingly vulnerable.
---
They are probably dealing with it now :)
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/df30p9/a_bit_of_down_time_in_about_45_mins/
---
Hell yeah!
---
Nice! I don’t have a printer so I’m saving it for quick reference. Thanks for the work guys!
---
I agree. That’s what I’m saying. My point is is that it should be better because as it stands it’s useless comparatively.
---
While I do sell things cheap, I can absolutely see where you're coming from. If you don't want this game to become your very own personal business sim, looking for good stock is a pain in the was.
---
The whole system is just broken😂
---
I had to move my CAMP because there were three wall pieces on top of each other just floating in the air next to my actual building. They were from the first building I built there. Took down everything else, but those pieces would not delete.
---
No problem, glad it helps you.
---
No problem.
---
Yes the 3rd mission has some even at the last room fight.
---
They just announced maintenance at 2 pm.
---
Hilarious he just admitted he doesn’t even own the game
---
They should let us plant pumpkins finally, not just gourds. Then on top of that maybe let us set down every one of the carved pumpkins from the Pumpkin house as lightable decorations. Maybe some spooky vault boy and girl cut outs of vampires, werewolves, and commies oh my! On top of that it would be nice to see maybe some harvest festival items, like wagons of produce, bundles of corn and razor grain, etc.
---
Or the ivory handle plan? I forget what it's actually called. I get so pissed every time I see it that I don't get past "ivory". I put it on one pistol once. Cackled like an idiot, and then sold that crap.
---
Some drinks do not have an individual plan, so what you do/have learn(ed) is made available by completing the quest. Separate actual plans are still listed here.
---
Nuke grenades/mines, fatman, or pacifist. I would say gamma gun but if you cant hit me with your tse whatever, a different gun isnt gonna help
---
Me and my friends were fighting each other cuz we kept thinking the other was fucking around while the whole time we were all in main menu. The social tab just didn’t update.
---
I like "Item cannot be placed in water", myself, because it's so random.  I'll have half my base built at the edge of a pond or something and then it will suddenly decide that I can't add another foundation piece next to the one that's already IN THE DAMN WATER.
---
Yeah :(
---
Hell yes! Where do I get in line? 😂
---
There’s a patch coming in a couple weeks and the Halloween event likely won’t start until the last week of the month- my guess is they’ll be added with patch 14 and released into the atom store either afterwards or during the event week.
---
All skins work for all PA, but change the model to the PA it’s designed after (ex. Plague rider has an X0-1 model, using it on excavator changes it to look like X0-1 with the paint)
---
yut on PC and I can't have friends either. it sucks
---
dude same exact thing here
---
Whitesprings def need updated to show the damage.
---
Quad, Vampire
---
There are 51 total mods for the Radium. Some just have plans to learn it immediately.
---
I'd buy them from you for 10, I'm probably not the only one who wants them.
---
i don’t sell them... i use them and i tend to go to Whitesprings to buy the rare ones from the vendor bot in there.
---
Faster fire rate and explosive are always good second abilities on weapons. 
---
Unyielding, Vanguard, Assassins and Bolstering go for a pretty penny when coupled with An Refresh and Sentinel or Cavalier. 
---
Also there's a difference in defenses of the weights of armors. 
---
There's Light, Sturdy and Heavy. Of course heavy usually goes for the most money. 
---
A quick footnote too, the legendary scrip vendor never drops heavy armor, only light and sturdy. 
---
So, if you had an Assassins, AP Refresh, Sentinel piece of combat armor that was heavy, you could get upwards of 20k for one piece. 
---
A heavy piece of combat limb armor is 20/20 on the energy/ballistic scale with no modifications. There's a whole graph that you might want to look up to tell the weight differences of the other pieces.
---
But why not? They can't hurt anything unless they decide to break structures. And if they decide to break structures, the locked door is not going to help anything.
---
Oh ok. I was wondering because I farm recipes from biv and someone was asking if he rewards ballistic bock.
---
Well what ones do you use?
---
Think i have a pink unicorn wallpaper, pretty cool :D lol
---
I lock up my generator JIC and also because it gives a space where you can do drop trades safely.
---
They can still blow it up if it is locked. The locked door will do nothing to stop them from hurting it that way.
---
This is amazing. Google is not very helpful when looking for this stuff. Thank you mister.
---
Explain to me why NW is doing fine while there were only five players per continent in ‘survival’ which eventually lead to its termination? That’s why i suggested two pvp modes, one untouched math from adventure, the other true survival like NW with effects and aimbot removed.
---
Executioner is good too
---
You do release there is a big new content drop coming next month right? That hasn’t changed...
---
The chemistry bench kills me. I am in the forest, so I get a lot of level 5 shoppers. I pick up those plans and put 'em up for a couple caps. Literally a couple. Five tops, and that's if I'm running low. So imahone , y surprise wandering into a camp and seeing someone trying to see them at full price. Uh, buddy, you can scoop this up for nothing at several train stations...
---
Also some weapons, even though they have a "good" ability aren't the best for that weapon. 
---
Like a single shot black powder weapon doesn't benefit from Faster Fire Rate. 
---
And on the opposite end of the spectrum, full-auto weapons give better bonuses on Vampires legendary effects than single shot weapons.
---
I have quantums that saw 400 HP without cola nut, so with rank one that would be like 800 HP over how many seconds? Seems like if I had a super stim and and a quantum going with cola nut and the biomesh lining on I'd be impossible to kill.
---
Any good weapon that you recommend? My main weapons are a gatling gun, sniper and tesla rifle. Decent for PvE but not for PvP
---
I know something about the difficulty of attaining all the Radium Rifle mods. Screw you Bethesda.
---
Yeah, this ones great too. I mean you have floating crops that can’t be placed in water that are further upland than your houses foundation. BTW would be cool to plant crops on top of your roof
---
I've noticed increases lag and horrible sounds during Queens for the last 2 weeks.  Sounds like everyone has ultracite gatlings at max speed.  It gets choppy and drops to about 2 fps.
---
I was there a few days ago and it had his name but only when I was on the quest.  Before that he wasn't named.
---
Scorched BoS Paladin flying around with Jet Pack Ultracite Arms spraying down the Bog with his BE 50cal.
---
Raiders popping SB and charging at you with a Tesla Rifle.
---
Settler shooting you with Bloatfly syringe to farm Bloatfly glands.
---
I'm also on PC. Sometimes one squeaks in. I've had a couple of people manage to friend me. I don't know what sort of crazy voodoo/witchcraft they had to do, but it worked! That said, when I try, the game doesn't even pretend it sent the request I asked it to...
---
For regular or all types?
---
Depends what weapon it's on. Furious is awful on something like a black powder rifle with slow fire rate. Instigating is awful on stuff like the MG42 with low damage per shot high fire rate. 
---
Bloodied or antiarmour are always the best. Anything explosive sells for way more caps than it's worth as well. Two shot weapons sell for more than they are worth. 
---
Certain weapons suck no matter what like black powder weapons with any legendary will be cheaper than a handmade or combat rifle with the same legendary effects. 
---
Anything nocturnal is auto script since it gets weaker during the day. Stalkers weapons and cloaking armour are useless effects as well. 
---
Move faster while aiming and +1 endurance both do nothing (speed boosts dont stack and the endurance doesnt change your hp at all)
---
I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going o.O
---
I keep only one of four water purifiers locked to guarantee some source for purified water. Otherwise, all benches, purifiers and crops are open to any visitors. Also have a bed close to my vending machines, in case anyone needs a quick rest. Very few aesthetic items, though; mostly a practical build.
---
Hmmm... so what’s the strategy there?
---
There's a 90% chance this was caused by someone who is at the queen fight wearing the Vault Raid Power Armor set.  The acid effect offered by the set bonus cause insane lag for everyone besides the user.
---
What do you do with the rare ones?
---
And not a single F was given that day. lol At least that person KNEW they were being an ass.
---
Npc says server discon......
---
So what did i get recently? Maybe it was pistol then, but I think it was blunderbuss. Had terrible effects though, so I scripped it.
---
I was looking forward to getting home and seeing new atom shop items, but if it's just more raider/PA garbage I'll pass.
---
For the regular Nuka Cola or all types? (Cherry, Quantum, etc)
---
&gt;!I thought we found melody's body?  Inside or outside of big bend tunnel?  I guess I am remembering wrong.!&lt;
---
This is the best thing I read on this subreddit. Good job on the story.
---
Been looking for metal picnic table. Any specific vendors or locations where it can be?
---
If anyone wants to do raids with me, I'm on ps4, we almost finished the challenge but half of my team disappeared.
---
The pumpkin scarecrow variant is the closest we can get for now
---
Thanks! I'll take a look at my router!
---
May the great Mothman bless you.
---
released in May I believe or early June - got some of them then.
---
There is no special effects or anything if someone was curious. just skins
---
non-existent
---
Grahm is the only way right now.
---
I am at work rn. Thank you for doing gods work.
---
That's good....thats really good....
---
Even though frog legs is pretty op, it takes 9 agility points so I had to choose between that or my action points card. I can Juno high now, but only run for like 10 seconds tops. After three jumps you jump normal too, not to broken compared to when it first dropped imo.
---
Take damage
---
Drink Nuka Cola
---
???
---
Profit
---
Sorry, couldnt help myself lol.  With perks nuka cola can be used on the fly in conjunction with stim packs to make tanking (activating) up to 3 pylons in the ISS event a joke.  It's kind of impressive to see even when you know how the magic trick works.
---
Cloaking is only good for pure sneak builds...aka almost useless like you said haha. 
---
Like, vanguard cloaking is okay because you turn invisible while sneaking giving you almost a guaranteed 2.0x sneak damage even in complete sight.
---
i got a VTU hat from doing collision course to kill the scorch
---
I have three doors on my camp that used to get left open all the time, I locked two of them and put an open sign infront of the door. People still message me mad that they are "locked out" even though they really aren't. Is what it is, I'd rather have one door left open that my whole base looking like I was raised in a barn.
---
Yeah Bloodied is not thing I will do. The Handmade does out-handle all other rifles but you are probably right. We are talking like, less than 5 though so ...
---
Yes, I have one for sale in my vendor.
---
It's funny - now they've vaulted so much stuff that the pretty much the only things in the shop are things I already own - aside from wallpapers and fridge.
---
I can't imagine that's good for their bottomline when the diehards / mega-fans can't even 'window shop'.
---
The things that I maybe might have blown atoms on in the 'droughts' *(aka periods like right now)* are totally MIA and one can only reasonably buy the same raider assets so many times . . .
---
Except it wasn’t a “truthful observation” 
---
It was you (a moron) taking a random jab at the imagery “evil socialists” because people don’t like shit games
---
Bethesda doesn’t need you advertising microtransactions for them.
---
Well, shopping at player vendors is still one of my favorite FO76 activities, so that sounds good to me!! Hope to see yours soon!
---
sure, why not.  Take an updoot.
---
^^^ Yesssss all the things!   Id like a pumpkin mascot head!
---
I agree with making Tank Killer apply pistols, but it's a bit late to make the other changes you are suggesting, consider what they did by changing the Demolition Expert Card, it now requires 5 levels to achieve the same Buff most other cards get with 3 levels, and there is no simple way to fix it unless they rework the Card, delete the DE cards from everyone's build and give them back the same number of picks that they deleted (sounds complicated &amp; unlikely to happen).
---
Moving any Card to a different Tree could cause all sorts of issues, as could adding a similarly functioning card. with the proper build &amp; Perk selection most Pistols seem to be properly powered to me, though a couple could use a little buff.
---
Wanted players cannot do damage to you unless you shoot them first. They’re open to taking damage, but not dealing it until someone hits them first.
---
Aside from the other “my shotgun heals people” bugs that makes them mostly useless.
---
Plague rider because it looks like the normal flat green paint from the enclave vendor until you get close and see the boils and sores, my favorite biblical plague.
---
Once you built your Excavator did you go back to Garrahan Mining HQ and register it?  If it's not registered, you don't get the full mining functionality
---
You drink them. Massive hp regen.
---
Still laughing @ "floating house".  Thank you for that!
---
She is the narrator for wastelanders though which implies she lives.
---
It’s more raider shit?
---
People asked for Raider items for a long time. Now we get nothing but Raider items..
---
I can't send photos without imgur or anything, which I don't have.
---
It’s my character’s camp and we team up every time we play, allowing her to build most things on my camp. 
---
Looks like that excludes atom shop items, unfortunately.
---
None because they are 14$ each..
---
Correct. And I am sure they will explain then how she survived. I’m just saying with existing lore all we know is she was injured badly
---
Correct, just the few that slipped by.
---
"It was nice of you vault dwellers to sell all your garbage to our vendor bots and never buy anything. We really appreciate having to clean all that spoiled meat out."
---
Thank you for your kind approach - you wouldn't believe how many toxicity us PvPers sometimes get for even mentioning the concept - feels great to know that some people on the "other side" understand that we're connected vessels and satisfaftion (or its lack) from one side influences the other.
---
Nice suggestions on top of OP’s!
---
It was a dupe with a script
---
well, people aren't exactly nice as it is, plenty of complaining about "griefers" on this sub so making raiders joinable will at least make it more of an RP type of deal :P
---
You're camp is immune to damage unless you and the other player are hostile against one another.  They could shoot mini nukes at your walls all day long and not do a bit of damage.
---
Wow your a happy guy. Based off your comment history your just a little ray of sunshine when it comes to fallout 76.
---
fucking hate this game...... never has a game with such potential been bungled so horribly
---
I wish you had half stairs at least so you could place flooring at the same height of the half walls.
---
Didn’t know that re. no heavy combat armour drop from the Purveyor... upvote..! 👍🏻
---
DAMN IT! MY BACKPACK!
---
It's very frustrating! I got a god roll combat chest from her and it's only sturdy :(
---
Again. learn the difference between opinion and fact.  Come back at me when you have a fact with evidence other than just your word here.
---
We're a good 200 years to early for the Children of Atom. I think we should have a new name.
---
Lmao besides the fact that reading this shit is giving me a headache (I’m reading all of your posts in a Russian accent by default so maybe English isn’t your first language), what your saying has no value. Your obviously hating on people for knowing how to interact with each other. It’s literally the whole point of the game and everyone KNEW there wouldn’t be any NPCs in the first place! So why cry now? And as far as NW, did you think you were going to take your level 1 character in and start wrecking people? I mean this game is good you just have to put hours into it they aren’t just going to give you a crazy OP character right out of the gate because you bought the game. And before you say it, yes I read your post!
---
I know there’s content coming but I’m referring to base cosmetics in a sense of Halloween decorations or a bundle
---
\&gt;assasins  
---
\&gt;nocturnal  
---
\&gt;stalkers are auto script. 
---
Bloodied, Junkies, AA, Exec and sometimes berserker almost always worth more.   
---
Instigating is good for hunting/bp rifle for example, vampire is ok for minigun. 
---
as a rule of thumb, weapons with "rifle" in its name tend to be more valuable.
---
I thought I wouldn't either, or commando for that matter.  Then I lost my AAE handmade and rolled a Bloodied one and here I am.  I die a lot, but it is fun mowing through most enemies, things feel so less bullet spongy and I feel risk again, but SQB fights are a bitch to stay alive in for me.
---
Imposter sheep squatch quest
---
Nope, cloaking isnt chameleon. Cloaking turns you invisible when you get hit with melee once every 30 seconds. Literally fuckin useless since it wont make you lose the enemies. Chameleon is what you're thinking of and that has its uses if you are a high health sneak build (for low health your better off with unyielding for sneak). Also chameleon is very nice for pvp
---
Something like this is a good starter build.   
---
The Bloodied build in this thread is more of an "advanced" build as you need specific gear for it to work.  For a new player just getting established a build that doesn't rely on gear is better.  Later on down the road you can always convert to something else.
---
I’m sure there are a few examples.
---
Have you even played it?
---
Than you for the info!
---
I just started selling it too, all at 1 cap each and it consistently sells. 
---
My Camp is in the Forest, and I put the .38 up for 0 caps. I had a lower level player stop by the other day, "buy" 100 .38s and leave the rest for the next person. He also bought some fusion cells.
---
Or they could just do a double XP event for a week and people could level up like crazy to get the 3 points back  if they were to be that worried about loosing a few perk points. I'd be willing to bet if the suggested changed was made, not many would be upset they dropped 3 points into the "old version".  But you're right I prolly won't ever happen. Maybe the legendary perks will make the difference who knows.
---
Just saved for reference 👍
---
so if I find a lets say 1 or 2\* heavy armor with a good first prefix, would it worth something my man?
---
its in the challenges, came out when vaults dropped with the other vault challenges
---
challenges -&gt; combat tab -&gt; secure vault 94
---
You know all you have to do is put ‘allow team fill’ on right? Then you get dropped onto a random team. So that’s not a problem with the game it’s a lack of reading simple directions.
---
I missed a few words there dealing with my 2 year old, I apologize. 
---
Cloaking is only good for melee-sneak builds for losing the enemy to get a random sneak 2.0x sneak attack while under melee damage.
---
And I agree. Chameleon is way better but Cloaking is good if it's the ONLY thing you can find for free/cheap.
---
Assuming it’s bugged at the moment.
---
I wouldn't mind something similar to the easter eggs and bunny head
---
I never thought about that tbh. I'm quite new to the game and tried to build my camp aestheticly pleasing for myself. That includes having my crafting room. On the other hand... When I decide to visit a camp I only check vending machines because just using a strangers equipment feels like bad manners for me. OK so i will at least put a stash box out. Not selling anything so I don't think a lot of people will visit.
---
Lol all good. In my experience unless you get far away, you wont lose danger from enemies. Doesnt help that they all telepathically communicate about your exact location...
---
Yes sir! Everyone needs to start somewhere so say... A 1* Unyield combat chest would go for a couple thousand... 2-3 I would assume, I'd it was heavy of course. 
---
Then an Unyield, Sentinel heavy piece will garnish upwards of 10k.
---
First magazine my Alt picked up was the last one of Astoundingly Awesome Tales that my Main Chr had spent months searching for.
---
Which was surprisingly easy to zombie solo. Took me about four deaths. Grab the conduits and go nuts until you die, rinse, repeat. Shame it costs flux to redo.
---
Ooo god, that means the power armor display will have to effect budget also...
---
What?
---
Yes this exactly please
---
Encryptid is the only event with a solid cap sink. Once I got most of the things I wanted ... on one character I’m just saving and buying serum plans ... and the others buy recall circuit boards.
---
Arktos needs a similar cap-sink ticket and be off the timer.
---
It’d be cool if after the FIRST nuke, you could buy keycards from MODUS.
---
=========
---
I’d love other cap sinks as well. Player vending should be a 20% or higher tax.
---
We need a mail option, also w/ a tax / mail-cost per-item mailed based on value of item or a set several hundred cap price.
---
I’d love to see atom challenges on learning plan sets ... then you could incent people to either spend caps or hunt for plans to get the set, and thus ... atoms ... and if they buy them, caps are out of the economy.
---
Same w/ the magazine / bobble head challenges - need to be on “use” not “collect” and that would drive economy and maybe even their price up.
---
What what?
---
Having a 1/1000 kd isn't positive
---
Yeah I’m assuming it might be
---
But then all current floating camps would lock their users into build mode until they delete the whole structure, or place a lot of stairs.
---
And also no keg :s
---
I am the playerbase
---
These are great ideas! Any objection to my incorporating them into the original post?
---
Im just hoping we get enemy human NPCs, not just human NPCs that give missions.
---
Right, lol. Damn hiveminds.
---
are you unfamiliar with the Gamma gun? it does 125 rads per shot with the deep dish mod. I have a quad gamma and its amazing against players.
---
I used to sell mutations at 250 caps, but these days I'm just selling the flux. They sell better and will help me collect all the recipes sooner. Once I have all of them I'll go back to selling serums.
---
You do raise a point and it would probably cause backlash but the floating camps probably weren’t intended by Bethesda. Most of them are close to cliffs so they could just use a valet glitch or make a bridge to the cliff.
---
Let them use legendary weapons
---
Let’s expand on this idea a little beyond just bloodied builds.  There needs to be a Rad X syringer.  Hits suppress all mutations for 10 minutes.
---
It's so cringe that even the menus have bugs.
---
Sources? Any degree of less vague info? 
---
More specifically, is it the strangler armor?
---
Shit if you ask me they balanced the hell out of NW and maybe neglected adventure mode tbh. This dude is a chode and he just called us toxic on this hater ass troll post! Sheesh... there is something wrong with people.
---
for months I played that game with a  close friend.
---
You will still need to stash everything you get and put them back into the scrip machine each day until they are all gone, so doesn't really make any difference.
---
If u can glitch under ground or under the map why wouldn't u be able to glitch a building, unlike the purveyors place where u could see or in Morgantown terminal that one room all boarder up I'm wondering if anyone has tried glitching into a building that allows u to build ur camp next to. Not sure if this helps u out. I thought I was explaining best I could not computer whiz.
---
*yes I drink them*, I sometimes sell them for low ranked people who want to display them in their display cases &amp; don't know where to buy them.
---
nice to know I'm not the only one who thought the alpine horn was a good idea
---
I'm not saying you didn't see what you saw :) - just that I need more to see it for myself.  i appreciate though the manner in which you chose to express your opinion :)
---
workshops are the last few pvp zones in the game. always expect to be attacked at a workshop. it doesnt matter if it hasnt happened before, because survival mode is gone so workshop pvp more popular now.
---
Y'all need to take math lessons in school.
---
If your on PC during working hours (US) - come find me....
---
There are alot of people playing.....I have been enjoying it since launch....the players online are very friendly and help out newbies
---
Oh I got you. Yes you absolutely can if it let's you build your camp there. The only issue is what's on the other side. Sometimes the other side has ground that elevates quickly but not quick enough to do the glitch thru. Other times you can just do it thru the building then again thru the ground. And other times it works perfect and nothing is on the other side
---
One of my buddies was able to glitch into the garage next to the crazy cat lady house. He put his generator in there. I think they patched it out though...
---
Nope go ahead
---
All, 5 for regular, 10 for some of the special ones
---
Olay sorry I guess I didnt explain it well enough sorry about that. Think it's cool haven't done it myself but always wondered if they had more interior space we dont know about that will be used at later dates. Thanks for the info very cool
---
As others have said, the gamma gun is the best counter to a bloodied build. 
---
Of course you’ll get smoked before you can pull it out, but when you respawn, it’s your best chance at revenge.
---
I registered it as part of the quest!
---
Well not promising thats it but the script did leak a few days ago and it cant be a coincidence but just google fallout 76 dupe script and look for within 1 week posted  im not linking cheats and getting in trouble
---
Sent you a request. I’m still trying to get comfortable playing with strangers but it’s boring out here on my own!
---
Armor, clever and mines dupes are all over, I’m surprised we don’t see a ton of that armor out and about now.
---
looks liek the combo fo Combat heavy BOS chest and Robot heavy polished limbs is a good all around protection build
---
I remember being so freaking excited. I thought: "Bethesda is a AAA studio. I'm confident they won't disappoint." Such a fool.
---
I meant mandinga, which is the devil in some Cultures. I am from Argentina and my mobile has both dictionaries working at the same time.
---
Thank you :-)
---
Totally believe that.
---
No problem haha if your on xbox I can show you how
---
Yeah i don't like Raider stuff at all they look very bad i didn't get a single raider themed item, still waiting for enclave or other factions stuff.
---
This happened to me as well a few days ago. I wasn't the one who launched the nuke though.
---
I just assumed it was because I had pushed the graphics to Ultra and my machine couldn't handle it when coupled with half the server jumping around and shooting at the same time.
---
what level are you
---
Yup found it already. Thanks.
---
49
---
I intend to be Bloodied as part of this, but we'll see how generally survivable I am without it.  Part of what inspired this character was getting a Bloodied Explosive Pipe Pistol on my main.
---
Atomic shop purchases are for that account holder only and can’t be built outside of their camp. They also can’t make and sell or drop costumes or armor paints.
---
I have an idea! A Carboard cutout that you can use to go to the atom shop!
---
Yeah that sucks I'm on ps4 thanks tho and thanks for the info very cool
---
You find many dead firebreathers the only named ones (through notes) are the guys that have the passwords forthe scorched killer schematics. Other than that it's all generic masked firebreathers.
---
When talking about a k/d ratio anything below a 1 would be negative.
---
Wish I knew I put them 6 a pop for plain and the won’t move.
---
I have about 150 of them!
---
100
---
85% PVEers and 15% PVPers.
---
It should be noted that it clips through the vast majority of headwear, in case that bothers you.
---
Well in Bethesda's defense, it does say that the servers would be shutting down at 2pm EST.
---
okay mate its obvious that u have nothing to say that's why u point ur attention that english is not my first language what is also obvious, it does not show your bad side)  
---
I don’t hate people, even fanatical sectarians, cultist's of the fallout 76. and even those who can’t read, and see what I have reconciled to the absence of the NPC and waiting for the DLC where they will be returned.  
---
ofc lvl 1 shouldn't wrecking people, but solo players should not play against players who in TEAMS and who can PEEKING when using 3rd person.
---
w.e man, I played the shit out of this game in 2018, what a waste of time.
---
Good -  active servers. Nuclear Winter\\ Battle Royale obviously sees its spike when EU and US \\ AUS timezones meet up for that like perfect 1-2 hours
---
"Cannot Place, Item Needs Support"  Then how the fuck did I build it in the first place!  Weapon display boards are notorious for this issue, they refuse to even be placed on the interior side of solid blank walls at times.
---
I just added you back. Apparently we played the division 2 or something together in the past.
---
25% off ended yesterday, I recommend saving up your scrip for when we hit the [50% off stretch goal](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events) and go for ★★★ legendaries.
---
Yup- same- I bought the Power Armors but nothing else
---
There are the nuka-shine kegs dropped in the last game update, Patch 13 - so I was hoping we'd get those this week but i guess another week
---
Bloodied is pretty neat. Damage output is crazy. TBH though with more creatures you don't benefit because you can sneak kill most things with a full life build anyways. The big baddies it makes a difference though. You stomp them lol. Like I revolver killing a  legendary sheepsquatch in 4-5 hits before it's health regenerates.  I ran bloodied for about a month and got bored. Between upkeep of rads and literally being a force of destruction lol. But it's definitely something you should try.
---
You should at least get to 50 so you can get any armor or weapon, at 49 you will get anything from 40-45 :/
---
I swear to GOD I lost 2000 5mm after my game crashed earlier today. I have literally no proof or any way to confirm.. so annoying
---
The irony is that you’d be the first one back here complaining that you’ve server hopped ten times and still can’t find an open workshop.
---
exactly why i asked, and what i was going to say.
---
Doing whitespring runs with a shotty or melee shouldn't be an issue.  Good xp for mid levels.  Also good chances for legendary drops.
---
yeah, you know, great minds and all that, lol
---
probably not cuz im more into pvp and griefing. but thanks for your reply, young lady.
---
Imgur link will work.
---
How does it cost flux to redo? I thought it costs caps
---
Base building has so much potential. If only they put out more updates
---
With BoS, Enclave, and Responder being non-existent to very rare I think wastelanders is going to put in a lot of cosmetics.  Makes sense also to clear out the old.
---
Weird, thought i found her body during a quest for that area.
---
I just hope they also look into Nuclear Winter exploiters... people having perfect headshot aim only against humans, people using what appears to be console commands (spamming thrown grenades faster than you can naturally do so, flight, etc.), and other cheats.
---
Quad is only really great in a few weapons.  I love my quad Tesla since it is mostly about tagging, but large clip with an auto Tesla can get me out of a jam, or shoot all day.
---
Video game economies are always going to be a hot mess, since resources are infinitely generated and pricing is arbitrary. There will always be a disconnect between average players and people who play the game like it's a job. Bethesda just needs to make the economy is fine for the 99% of the playerbase that *doesn't* optimize their gameplay to farm 10k caps a day or collect hundreds of godroll legendaries across multiple accounts. 
---
Tbh I don't think some things like quality legendaries shifting to barter-only, or trading with ammo and other alternatives, is a bad thing. Especially given the post-apocalyptic setting. Legacy items should either be made untradeable or deleted from the game altogether. And buying Atoms with caps is never going to happen - Atom challenges are only there to get you in the shop and keep you playing the game, their scarcity is intentional.
---
Serums show up on the vendor icon as "misc", fyi.
---
This happens to my wife frequently with heavy weapon ammo and shotgun shells. I first dismissed it as she is just shooting more than she thinks but I once dropped a couple thousand shotgun shells for her and 10 minutes later she said they were all gone. In her case it happens while she is playing.
---
Agreed! Polished seems to be a very hard mod to unlock. I've got 2 characters over level 75 who have yet to unlock it. Your best bet is to try and buy the mods where available.
---
happened to me yesterday but luckily the one person i encountered was still on the server and i was able to get back. lol and i launched the nuke, too.
---
Any suggestions for taking on those lvl 64 ghouls? I’m only a lvl 39 and don’t stand a chance in most fights
---
The Red Fireworks Mine? Damn :-( I have several that I earned or bought in player's vendors.
---
nice thread! My thoughts;
---
First things first
---
&gt;Atom purchases at a very high rate (this proxy-pegs caps to the dollar) Say, 1k caps per atom? 500?  
---
In-game gaming/gambling that provides entertainment at a cost
---
these two don't comply as it'd be illegal. 
---
I've been thinking about this too. WoW proved that ingame economies are kinda similar to real life economic concepts, so I think instead of lowering the supply of caps is not a good option for a) its not fun to take something away and b) people would just switch to 556 or some alternate currency as proven by history. 
---
Instead, beth can introduce one of or maybe both of two different schools; they have to create a stimulus that is not available at this moment. They can either a) increase "taxation" or b) create new ways for wealthy individuals to spend their money. Latter could be achieved by adding huge cap sinks, maybe a simple face cover with bling icons for 90k caps (a system that tracks your deposits for example so you could lets say deposit full stash three times), a little camp item for 120k etc. Theory of "conspicuous consumption" (sorry for namedropping I hate doing this but it just fits) proves that wealthy class of fo76 will buy these items. I also believe that adding this ultra expensive set of items will ease the ultra competitive legendary trading scene as most wealthy lads would just pursue other goals now. Also, gameplay options like 10K SPECIAL arrangements, 5K perk split, 7/10/15k 1-2-3\* effect reroll (respectively) etc all sound decent with this inflation. 
---
Or, bethesda could increase "taxes" by for example cutting 25% from every p2p trade, every player vendor sale or every NPC vendor sale. 
---
How does taxation work in a video game you ask? Simple, its just like real world! Some fellers decide to take some of your hard earned money you earn by enduring the settings' hardships and leave you in a barely functioning, bug ridden hub without providing anything substantial in return! :) 
---
jokes aside, I expect some huge cap sinks with wastelanders. we just have to endure this for a month now!
---
thank you sir!
---
Save it all!  At the least you will get 25% again if we don’t hit the stretch goal (even tho I think we will) and at that point go for 3 stars. But if you were doing it at full price and we’re trying to get a good weapon at level 50 I would go for 2 star just because you get the prefix and the possibility of explosive or faster fire rate.
---
Nice work updating this. Very useful resource for all players. I for one can never remember the different values for light/study/heavy armies so I’m definitely saving this for future reference
---
Hmmm... maybe "The Blessed"?
---
 Yeah, my Combat Knife is my binky and a Bloodied build would not work. I have 3 40% Speed ones with various other buffs and I can take down the entire Horde at the Golf Club with maybe 30% damage, if I summon it to me. ;)
---
 My Handmade is Explosive 30% Damage to Animals, most of the bosses and its Full Auto now. I hunt Scorchbeasts with it. ;)
---
Btw did anyone try the fishing outfit one yet? It’s not working for me ):
---
and it's been something we keep pointing out since launch and they haven't cared to fix it yet.
---
I was about to attempt but had to log off for a bit. When I have more info will let u kno.
---
Some great information cheers. I didn't realise +1 endurance didn't make any difference.
---
I know AA is broken on the Gatling plasma also. It all seems pretty logical but I'm wondering which builds are most popular at the moment as well as which effects are ones to look out for and keep.
---
i only find Colas useful in pvp to restore AP, but i imagine that perk could be useful if you’renusing Nuka Dark.
---
There’s enough of us already.
---
It doesn't, afaik.
---
Max STR, power armor
---
Avoid the club house (too many at once) and farm the small handfuls instead. Big 2H melee if you can, even better if you can get something like a L40 instigating.
---
Alternative bottom-feeder approach ...
---
* Get power armor
---
* Find a Tesla coils mod for it
---
* Run around letting the Tesla Coils tag the ghouls
---
* Bring ghouls to robots
---
* Loot dead ghouls
---
Get the Enforcer perk card to level 3 (in Agility) and you can cripple their legs with your shotgun, and then finish them off with a melee weapon.
---
It's arguable but I hold that the best value for your scrip is 2\* weapons and/or 3\* armor. There are few make-or-break third affixes on weapons, but the third affix on armor is vital. 
---
My only caution against 2\* weapons is that they often trade at irrationally lower prices than comparable 3\*, even if the third star is trash. Enough buyers are biased against 2\*'s that demand is noticeably reduced.
---
I sell them for 299 caps so people can buy as many as they want to resell. I have yet to run out of them so nobody is missing out on them (at my camp, at least).
---
I want this.
---
probably my cards/perks honestly
---
Plain- 5c
---
Cherry- 10c
---
Quantum- 15c
---
Dark- 20c (i learned the recipe)
---
Grape- 21c
---
Wild- 22c
---
Orange- 23c
---
i'd love to see Enclave or Brotherhood saying "look at you... you'r more mutant than human... and you'r practically a corpse." referring to the players huge amount of mutations and massive rad amounts.
---
Watoga high school. You can jump on top of the lion statue for a little extra safety
---
Yeah that's true, It's one effect that is very noticeable when it begins to work as the enemy health bar hits halfway.
---
I agree with rest man but increased taxation would lead to behind locked doors item dropping, and that'd as you'd guess create unwanted scenarios.
---
At this point, you don't have an issue with 3rd person vs 1st person. You have an issue with ALL 3rd person PvP.
---
I think Bethesda saves a *lot* of money on their script-writing.
---
don't mind me, just upvoting this entire thread...
---
Outside of door of the country club nearest to where you spawn there, is a elevated Stone garden / wall.  It's just high enough that the ghouls can't you.  Aggro them all and hop up there.  You could stand there and use a shooty on the big mob of them.  Once in a while one of them will force themselves up to your level but it's worth a try.
---
I certainly appreciate that there are people willing to sell things cheaply.... both for my own benefit and the benefit of others.  It's a great thing.
---
I just don't start lowering my prices until my machines are full and once they are full I don't spend a ton of time price managing them.   If I could adjust a slider that scaled the prices of everything in the machine, I would totally use the heck out of that.   When my machine is low on junk, the prices would be +50%....once my machines are full of junk, I'd lower them back down or even -50%, for example.  Without a good interface to do that, the prices only change sporadically.  
---
I agree with many that talk about the outrageous legendary prices when they start getting into 4k - 10k territory for junk legendaries... but then again, if I had a legendary that I found amusing, I'd be tempted to put it up for a ridiculous price just so that other people could see it not really expecting other people to buy it.   My 3 star combat knife comes to mind:  suppressors / 90% weight reduction.      The only way it would be any better / more ridiculous would be if it had faster swing speed.   Instead, I just carry that thing around with me.  It's not like I'm going to notice the 0.2 weight that it costs me.
---
Outside of door nearest to where you spawn there, is a elevated Stone garden, Wall.  It's just high enough that the ghouls can't you.  You could stand there and use a shooty on the big mob of them.  Once in a while one of them will force themselves up to your level but it's worth a try.
---
I've been saving atoms for a big BoS pack for months, although I don't know what stuff they could put in. Most of the Brotherhood assets from  FO4 are already in game
---
unfortunately that's a common issue in Fo76. sometimes it's something as simple as you crafting 1500 5.56 rounds and the game crashing before the server saves your character, because it takes too long between saves, other times it's something more complex like the server de-syncing and scrapping a legendary because it's highlighting the wrong item.
---
the worst part is that Bethesda is able to restore items. their tools are rudimentary, yes. which is also their fault. but they *are* capable. they just refuse to do so.
---
whelp I never check those, I'm sure I sell or scripped some good armors away just coz they were 1-2\* :( 
---
just as you said tho; you're never too late!
---
Re-releasing the Riders? Is the price the same as the initial release?
---
Good call on not giving it optics. That’s important to maintain balance within the revolver class as a whole, otherwise there’d be little reason not to just use this over the others. This way you’d trade a bit of damage for a long range option with the Western, which seems fair.
---
I also think one of the revolvers should be able to get a suppressor, so there’s a stealth option. I was thinking about this the other day and in my mind I thought maybe the SAR could get it, but I think I like your stat upgrades better than just making it the revolver class stealth option.
---
I guess maybe the .44 could play that role? Keep the stats as-is but with a suppressor even that gun would have a seat at the table for end game gunslinger builds. Just my two cents. I like your ideas a lot though
---
I like AA, instigating mainly but have an executioners plasma that is really good. Like, everyone rocked bloody builds so I kept them to sell even though I didn't use them. What would people appreciate me holding if I come by it.
---
Oh please believe,anything I spend can be spent...
---
2 little ones doesn’t allow me the luxury of foolhardy spending,&amp; essentially I just want 2 of the 4,the Pale &amp; Plague ones aren’t that cool too me,I mean the Plague one Is “alright”.
---
But the Dark &amp; War seem cool too me.
---
I sell cherry for 13c each they don't last long.
---
What you get from the vendor is one item needed to craft the assaultron recall keycard. You need flux too.
---
Not that I’m aware of or seen and I’ve been around since release
---
Grafton has sort of a cul de sac
---
1. New characters only
---
2. Cannot trade with other players
---
3. Disease are permanent till removed.
---
4. Only FT are to events, your camp, and V76
---
5. PVP if in place needs to be severely balanced, better off not even having it IMO
---
6. More legendarys, unleveled regions (except forest) so you can have 68 super mutants in all regions but forest basically. Maybe use this as an excuse to add 4-5 star enemys
---
7. On the last note, make legendary enemys tougher, 1 star regens 1 time, 2 star regens 2 times, so on and so forth.
---
8. Survival characters can go to normal but normal cannot go to survival.
---
9. More perks
---
I cant think of more at the moment but thats just a start.
---
Is anyone going to be surprised if this actually happens?
---
Maybe they are considering vats as a method of aiming. Sure you're not going to get a clear head shot, but there is possibility of it happening, who knows what they're thinking
---
My partner dropped over 3k ultracite 5.56 ammo so I could sell it on here for her went to put it in my stash....GONE with the wind... 🤷‍♀️
---
Not just ammo it happened with stimpaks and other junk
---
That' been going on for months and for the most part - it's fantastic!  It happens when there are a LOT of players/NPCs on the field - like at SBQ events. If I'm getting dangerously low on health I launch myself into the sky and have 5 or 10 seconds to stimpack back up.  It's been really useful.
---
The world must be a strange and frightening place for you if you don't believe a single thing unless you have first hand experience with it.
---
You mean maybe we’d drop items in chests / suitcases again? Legendaries and spare scrap?
---
Interesting. Wonder if it was a bug? There was a recent post a few days ago with a photo.
---
Imgur is easy to get but I understand. It just sucks to hear an artist did good work and not be able to see it.
---
Totally agree.  I get this all the time when working with stairs and upper floors.  It's okay if part of the structure will be inaccessible, most players have Marsupial and Bird Bones and can jump up.  I say change this to a warning that pops up and we can either select Cancel or Proceed Anyway.
---
Yesterday I lost a Vanguard's Combat Armor Left Leg 2stars legendary.
---
I never sold/dropped anything in apparel section, it just disappeared from my inventory. I am scared because this thing can happen to my TSE Gatling gun or my TSE Assault Rifle.
---
Much appreciated!!!  I can finally update my inventory list with light, sturdy, heavy!  Thanks
---
I agree though I'd extend this reasoning to ALL 6 shooters.  .44, western revolver, anything else I'm forgetting.
---
"You hear about them Vault Dwellers who found that old government stash? Nobodies seen hide nor hair of em recently" 
---
In regards to the dev room
---
Maybe I'm just wrong though
---
After some time thinking about these things I’m coming to the conclusion that as counterintuitive as it may seem, the best solution is to simply make caps unlimited and shared across all characters. Additionally, add a secure item for item trade option to the trade menu, for players who find situations where that is appropriate. 
---
There are really two valuable commodities in this game—caps and stash space. Stash space is the true economic limiter. 
---
The fear is that if we have an unlimited cap account, that sellers will inflate prices through the roof to sell to heavy hitters. The reality is that those big spenders are few and far between. If you price your items too high, they won’t move and eventually your stash will be full. At that point you’ll either dump things or slash prices. Eventually, players will learn that low prices and volume equate to more caps because they can sell to a wider market. 
---
Ultimately, a truly free market will result in lower prices and wider item availability. Limits may feel  like a good way to control things, but they really aren’t. Players will always find a way around them. Let the market do what it does and add new cap sinks if things get out of control.
---
Outside is totally overrated, keep gaming brother.
---
Genuinely curious, is everything ok? I hope you don't truly have thoughts like that. I know it's the internet and all, but just making sure.
---
I used to be subbed to juicehead, but his videos got so redundant and his information was never accurate, no excuse for someone who’s full time job it is to make videos on a video game be less informed then his viewers
---
They have a couple like that one. I also installed the one that turns them into a sweet roll every time they mention someone stealing yours. Since I have the Inigo mod, I then give the sweet rolls to him.
---
No on the raising of taxes. Some of us already sell things at a loss there is no need to compound our loses.
---
That works, but that's kind of a waste of a serum, though? You're basically losing 90 caps for nothing. If you at least buy something, you have something in return. :)
---
Sometimes I buy bulk ballistic fiber if I'm too lazy to go farm.
---
Eh, not too worried about that, do we know if it'd even have a function?  I want the fridge for it's non cosmetic cheat to win feature, but only the Nuka Cola one since I won't actually pay for Atoms anymore.
---
absolutley, but now i was talk about f76
---
Alternative opinion: they should put these in, then remove them as the bugs are fixed, so we at least see that Bethesda is aware of the issues and occasionally bothers to fix one or two of them. After every bug fix, they should then say "I wonder what's busted now."
---
The Nuka-mobile should look like a SCUD launcher.
---
I've always used a mixed set of armor types to try to gain the highest resistance and because putting together a complete set is extremely difficult and costly, LOL.  Interesting information on the trapper providing the highest RR.  Thanks for sharing this information.  I'm commenting here so I can find it later.  :)
---
Thanks my dude !
---
Talons too
---
I've seen them range from 5k to 12k, with and without the mods on them. So who knows what they're actually selling for
---
sometimes my friends will say main menu, but if I click on them it says "join" and acts like they're online still. Other times it doesn't. I find relogging in the launcher solves it most of the time. But like everyone has to do it lol
---
5 characters at 1400 caps per.
---
Yeah I know about those, been putting a lot in there but I don't know how the in game economy is I guess cause some stuff doesn't sell and other things I sell all of. Like I had a guy last night but all 35 treasure maps I had between my 2 machines, I had them listed at 10 caps a piece
---
Thanks, I was literally just looking for something like this last night. I saw something similar a while back but couldn't find it again.
---
Yeah this feels like a bit more than video games, sadly. Good luck OP
---
Or, unpopular thought it seems to be, you could delete something(s) from your camp. I spend a good 50% of my time server / camp hopping and the vast majority are sprawling messes.
---
There's going to be relatively limited returns for what you've asked, given that all indications point to server stability suffering as budget is added.
---
I’ve been having trouble finding matches for NW but I do want to try it out some more.
---
Ty 💓
---
You've got to connect with the character you want to roleplay, in my experience.
---
I've started role-playing as the *slightly* loony  No-Bark Noonan, one of my favorite NPCs from New Vegas. Found my character some tattered rags and a properly ornery stickin' knife.
---
I've memorized a couple of his lines from the game, and started thinking what he might think in the context of Appalachia in order to ramble incoherently. "Ain't no such thing as Mothman, buncha hokum. The truth is th' Man-Moth. A moth in the stolen guise of a man! I seent it from a distance once whilst testin' the medicinal effects of Nukashine."
---
You usually get 5 minutes before shutdown.  That's more than enough time to knock out the SBQ (if she lands).
---
Is it any different from the thumbs up emote we have now?
---
Brotherhood. Always been a Ranger(wasteland)/Brotherhood fan
---
As someone else said, Freddy's fear house can have them.  I've sold a bunch for like 50 caps because I had so many. Good luck finding soon!
---
If that's the case then this applies to a small minority of min-max players.
---
The non Rider skins I already have, because $14.00 is ridiculous.
---
I've read that shooting while in the air can stagger it and cause the landing animation to cancel (as to why the SBQ sometimes takes forever to land). Have you heard that before?
---
Because it's MY home. I don't run a boarding house for all the strangers of the waste. Even in a game, some folks like their privacy.
---
I just want the barriers with bos logo, that snap to the top of perimeter walls.
---
I have it up for 10k right now but that seems a little pricey...
---
Just trying to find a reasonable price without underselling it as it is a hard item to obtain.
---
Bad take
---
I actually have a question about this. Are mutations..canon/lore friendly, or are they only added for players themselves and break lore.
---
I recently got a Zealots FFR 15% crit fill handmade during the purveyor sale, put an auto prime receiver on it, melts Scorched I can run higher health during queen fights now, which is nice.
---
You can fix everthing at 50+ each level after that you can either switch an attribute around or get a perk. Also mutations if you havent, they're game changers. Twisted muscles, speed demon, marsupial are the big oones I feel. You can get grounded for more energy res. I say this all without haveing a melee toon. But my buddy who ive played with since beta has an absurd melee build. Hes also a bloodied build so you can look into going that route if you want.
---
I have this issue sometimes with fusion cores sometimes. When I load in they are in my Inventory but when I go to sell or stash them they are gone. When I get into my power armor I can see how many in the HUD only.
---
I been having that problem still. I even have old combat armor that still has the camo paint on it. Just cant put it on anything new
---
Yeah, that's cheap. You can sell them for 30-80 a piece, depending on the region (Forest 30, Bog 80). There was a time people paid 400 for a map, but that was when everyone was exploring.
---
Yeah if you gift it to someone who hasn't done the quest it breaks the quest and makes it unable to craft their own set on that character!
---
Honestly, il be upset if the next goal for 50% is a outrageous goal, but I don't think it will be. We are racking those numbers up fast
---
This shows you where to find it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJuHv-H-2Ww
---
It's random and can take a long time to get it, but this is the guaranteed spot. If you're on PC, I always have some witch costumes in my vendor for free (hats too when I can find them).
---
I would doubt that Bethesda would add vats against players, if I’m not mistaken they nerfed grenade launchers. If you were to add vats in pvp it defeats the purpose of nerfing the grenade launcher. But then again I wouldn’t be surprised at the same time due to Bethesda being Bethesda.
---
Yea I had my buddy put the peppered mod on mine and I tried selling it for 9999 caps, but no bites. Now it's on display.
---
But I just spent 20 levels respecing my alt out of Pistols because they wouldn't add these things. 🤔
---
Yea, shit like that is sell low in high quantities. Only weapons, plans, and bobbleheads are worth more than 50+ caps imo.
---
&gt; My only caution against 2* weapons is that they often trade at irrationally lower prices than comparable 3*, even if the third star is trash. Enough buyers are biased against 2*'s that demand is noticeably reduced.
---
I never understood that. I've seen people sell TSE/AAE weapons crazy cheap because they didn't have a 3rd *..of course that TSE handmade 2* for under 10k always comes up when I've done other deals and am tight on caps
---
That's exactly why we are asking,don't you think?
---
man I really try not to praise bethesda for any of the stuff related to fo76 but the community is really something else, not anything like I've ever experienced before! I'm pretty sure if a BE +1P Handmade was to be traded for caps under 20% tax, which could go up to a whopping 7-10k, some sort of 76market courier under a simple insurance system would pop up.
---
I might modify it and try to sell it for 8k, but like I said it was a pain to get it so I really wanna get what it's worth for.
---
Depends on the builds, if you barely achieved what you have planned, even one removed roof might transform the building from completed to hot mess.
---
From Bethesdas perspective, asking their clients to part with something to add something else is definitely a noticable deterrent when it comes to deciding for an additional purchase.
---
Yeah I realized that after the 4th cha ching notification ha but at least it cleared some stash space for me, not much but some
---
I'm certainly not advocating for a simple removal of caps. That would be unpopular to be sure. However removing caps through controls would be important to give them value again, even if it took some time to implement. I'm also not strictly against alternate currencies (barter), but they are a problem if the primary currency is so undervalued as to be useless.
---
Extremely expensive vanity items certainly are a good idea and should be implemented.
---
I enjoyed the very libertarian taxation view :)
---
Absolutely! And they only cover what all the haters want to hear. If wastelanders is great, yongyea won't make a video about that. But if one guy complains about something on reddit they'll be on it in a day. It's so annoying to see these super misinformed, repetitive "BEthEsDa SUckS" comments on all of their videos.
---
Two factions in opposition with the raiders and settlers so fingers crossed 😀
---
You can just run the silo and look up the codes at the end.
---
As stated, it takes about 2 hours to do if you're efficient.
---
As also stated, those are the people pumping caps into the economy expanding the money supply and so should be the ones you're worried about
---
What platform are you running on? I've heard of (but not experienced -- PS4) this farily regularly on the sub, and as with most issues, I'm curious if it's isolated (presuming to PC).
---
Shoot them from a distance once, get them to chase you, and run like a bitch to the sentrybots and assaultrons and let them do all the work.
---
My exact thought after checking things out.
---
Before it came out.
---
I've sold some legendary weapons and armor pieces underpriced deliberately, some accidentally, and some I've overpriced just because I loved using them so much, I wanted to find a good home for them. Anyway, you should be swimming in caps daily, so don't feel bad about it. :)
---
alternative to alternative opinion: or they could spend less time for puns and giggles and fix already existing and surely incoming bugs, balance issues, performance problems and overall QoL updates with the core game and add more gameplay content. People have been dealing with same shit and playing the same endgame content for a whole year now man. I really, really want this game to work better, puns etc are not mandatory at this point for me and many of those puns would worth nothing if game fails to rebrand itself with WL update.
---
Ehhhh, will it require like a lot of things to download, I don't want to go into having to install the Nexus mod launcher.
---
Yeah, dont imgur app. Nor feel the need to download it just to show a random picture. Kinda feels weird why I'm being asked to show a picture as if I would waste my bloody time to lie on a sub.
---
Ugh and I’m probably going to be gone most of the week of Halloween, I wish seasonal events would be all month long, or at least 2 weeks. Sometimes I have to travel for work and I missed the greenhouse, and will probably miss this event too ugh
---
There is no "winning" in fallout 76, so how can fridges be cheat to win (pay to win)?
---
Dead Game who dis
---
Appreciate it, and yeah the maps going to a good home was better cause I know I'll never use em. I do have a few legendary weapons in my locker that are priced a little high but I figure since I'm not in a hurry to get rid of them might as well see if someone buys em
---
yep, hardened receiver ...... that's why i said it's the cards/perks
---
Damn dude. That's an impressive collection.
---
Enclave for me!
---
also spoilers are not necessary I'd say, only twist is maybe the involvement of Enclave and game itself shows "Enclave Events" right now .
---
You do need a card though!
---
Calm down satan.
---
Just tested that theory of the rank 2 and armor and it doesn’t work
---
So everyone else should be punished because a handful of people go to extremes to earn as much caps as possible. We are talking about an extremely small number of people who are going to collect max caps on 5 characters every day. I would also pay you $100 in real money if you produce a video of someone earning 7000 caps in 2 hrs by farming, I'm very sceptical about this.
---
Yes, a card is still necessary.
---
Right? Another reason to have it be a month long!
---
My BE Western Revolver is really good, at 600+ damage a hit. The BE .44 Revolver is worse, despite being identical except for color, and hits for 100 or more damage less. Then we have the BE single action. I have a level 40, but that should still do damage right? Its about half of the BE .44 Revolver in damage, and so slow. I use it for style and fun, but it's not really fun with that damage and reload length. I agree with your points.
---
I hear ya though I'm not an avid builder myself -- some are definitely impressive and I know it's a fight to the last piece. Not being advised of the budget hit for a potential purchase likely compounds the problem?
---
I hear ya there. I made a rifleman alt for that very reason. My main is 102 now I grabbed like 3 levels of rifleman and said screw it. Started a new character that uses rifles. I figured it would take nearly the same amount of time to level a new character than it would to respec. Im also holding out with the hope that wastlanders will show some love to handguns. Bethesda did say there will be a weapon rebalance before it's release. With my luck I woulda made the switch to rifleman on my main and a major handgun buff would fallow the next week......LOL
---
Wow.. awesome idea. I run bloodied a lot and that would kill me! yeow. I'd be scared of this if I was a pvp'er (I'm not)
---
Yesterday I washed my mutations and brought back all of them except the Electrically charged and Unstable Isotope. This insures that I can't be accidently (or on purpose) be hit and be mistook for a pvp exchange.
---
I recommend others do the same that don't' like to be engaged in pvp.
---
Brotherhood of Atom the?
---
Totally fair points all around. A double action mod would be pretty sweet honestly, and I think having the .44 be the “rate of fire” revolver would be an acceptable solution. Personally I don’t need 100% realism in these games, but if faster fire rate can help give the .44 a niche, while staying within the realm of reality, then I’d be fine without a suppressor option.
---
I’ve always been big into thinking about how to balance weapon classes in any game, so I enjoy these kinds of posts a lot. I honestly think back to CoD4 when every weapon in each class had its own unique pros and cons that made every gun viable. To me that was perfect weapon class balancing, and FO76 could definitely benefit from more of that.
---
Lmao. I price my flux at like 75 caps and people always buy it all up immediately. So ive found a good price point for that. I always run through nuke zones with the double plant perk that i can't think of atm and end up with like hundreds and no way i need more than 20 of each on me at the same time
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
It's actually not that bad since you didn't pre-plan, just keep playing and you can add/change later. Using your current build, I put this together as a suggestion ([IronFist/Gladiator](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f5846a8&amp;d=sg2se2ss2s92pa0p80p00pe1ej4eo0el0eu0i10i44a72l71c72sf2am2ar2aj0lu2lt2&amp;w=s52si2sv0sb1pd0e40e80eb0e90c30c10cr0c50i30ij2ik0iq2a41l60l91lj0lb1sj1if2ia0i50ir2a00a30la2&amp;m=2c9fhg8e&amp;nw=&amp;n=IronFist%2FGladiator)). Looks like you don't want to use Power Armor, so this build would dump the remaining points into A and focus on tuning up what you have and adding some defense/future options (e.g., you can sub gladiator perks for iron fist or fit in nerd rage + serendipity if you find a good bloodied weapon). Hope this helps!
---
Yep, if you have enough stash space just play it slow. Don't forget to turn in your scrip at Berkeley Station for a a 3* legendary weapon or armor (random roll). In a week or so we might get a 50% discount in that Station if we kill enough Scorched.
---
By the way, public events now (almost all of them I think) give you scrip.
---
Calm down satan. Cool idea I’m not going to lie. But imagine how pissed people are going to be XD
---
Heh
---
LOL! But, math! It's HARD!
---
There's two of them in the fort.  I have found them elsewhere, but I never took note of their location.
---
I take 20-30 minutes when I get home from work to max out all five of my characters caps from the bots for the day. They all just sell serums to the bots. Loading in each character takes longer than selling 1400 caps worth to the bots.
---
Are you talking about vault 94? Whole servers dedicated to a single location? Doesn't sound like it would be worth the cost of running them.
---
Guess the ATOM Shop guy can't Maths..
---
This is amazing work and much appreciated.
---
Yes, there is a huge mod pack but to use it you have to replace pretty much the whole installation. It's called Fallout 4. /s
---
Right before the last meat week I tried selling 3 of them at 4.5, 5.5 &amp; 6.5k, because I was trying to figure out what people were actually paying for them,  and they all sold fairly fast.  They were each modded with salty,spicy or peppered. xbox.
---
You produce a video of that and you'll get $100.
---
Really? I've done a few lately and haven't gotten any scrip. Is it only the ones with the exclamation point on em
---
U craft them
---
 Never try to help a snake. It's in the literature. ;)
---
Wow that makes literally no sense. Rest in piece deadweightboy
---
This game just wasnt ready for pvp. 
---
What they gave us was a murderhobos wet dream and way to stay out of it....sort of.
---
It actually doesn't matter if you are a bloodied build or not, the gamma gun is great. I have a Quad FFR and can kill a player in 4 hits, but I have 32 shots! And vats of course, so I don't miss. I think non PvP players need to carry one for trolls or wanted players.
---
So 6.5k and up then
---
TBF the 76'ers have access and have used pre-war nukes. Not just the mini but the full sized ones.
---
I keep drinking cranberry juice but it's not helping, would you have some antibiotics? I could buy them from you.
---
Can I buy some mats UwU *lazy and don't wanna get them myself*
---
I've found all of the colored hats on more than one occasion.  I kept one of each and sold the duplicates for 75caps each in my vending machine.
---
Does 0.1 look like a negative number to you?
---
You don’t believe me? Serums go for 400-500 each when selling to a bot. My main character makes serums for all five characters to sell.
---
More raider stuff... again.
---
You said farming.
---
Forgot to mention this is a 1H melee. So yeah, I don't use PA. I have a bloodied meathook that I use and that combined with adrenal reaction gives me about 400-500 damage. But yeah. I'm gonna work on a rifle build and this one.
---
So stoked they brought back the black rider paint!!!
---
afaik nobody has it yet, myself included.  it needs 940 kills of each enemy type that spawns in there and 94 of two others, one of them only seems spawn about 5-7 per run
---
im assuming its just a thumbs up like we have, but with the strangler vines from the icon being used in some way
---
No, everyone should not be punished. As stated several times, progressive level or value based fees, very top-end luxury items, end-game entry fees etc.  All targeting the end-game player who is accumulating caps more quickly.
---
A full run of West-Tek exhaust your caps on a character if you pick everything up. A run takes about 20 minutes, plus a little time to inventory-manage your way to a vendor. Whitespring is closest. You can additionally make some hundred of caps from what the muties are carrying. Times 5 characters is approximately 2 hrs. There are also better ways.
---
Damn it might have been me!I’m level 55 and I saw some high level players on the server so I went to try and launch my first nuke.I ran through the entire silo just to launch the nuke on Fissure site prime with the 5 minute timer popping up.Must have been around 20:00 Central European time.
---
no i just hopped on after the update and it was like that gonna try dying tho
---
He'll yeah man. Completely agree with ya. I've done a few of these posts now and really try to keep any suggestion I have balanced and try to look at it from the "other side" ,if you will. You see alot of people saying something needs a buff but don't give and means to keep them within the current META. 
---
For instance  I want my single action to do 120 base damage, reload in two seconds and have 95 vats accuracy out to max range.... But that's ridiculous. Simply suggesting your favorite kind of gun should be buffed out the wazoo without any trade offs don't work. Gotta have some give, and keep stuff on the same level. lol
---
Excellent. Thank you!
---
$100 for a video of you making 7000 caps in 2 hrs from farming.

This is what the community has been complaining about for a long time. I'm got about 300 nukes under my belt and can tell you that this has been worse lately,  In a 2 hour time frame I'm crashing about 8 times on average. I also am seeing sometimes the game saying that I get disconnected for having modified files. I have never used a mod and I'm virus free. I have to run scan and repair to fix this. Scan disk has never found an issue with the SSD file structure either..
---
after reloading it a few times it started to kinda work, but most of the images don't load.
---
I love the stealth extra damage.  😊
---
Ditch the alcohol based perks
---
where is the t
---
I highly recommend it! 
---
I never really been big on fan stuff  (Nuka Break is wack imo) , but this podcast is proper good stuff.
---
Or they could just implement direct item trading.
---
Or even better, a barter-based Auction House.
---
The problem with barter now is that there's no trust and it's largely outside the game, limited to those who are willing to try the reddit/facebook barter boards. If it was an in-game lore-based function it would be fine.
---
Move gunslinger perks to perception
---
The codes reset today at midnight UTC. It usually takes a couple of hours for the new codes to be posted.
---
Or beth could implement in-game item trading and not have to have the community patching it.
---
ummmmm gee thanks? lol
---
Not what i was talking about :/
---
I was about to launch my very first nuke today.As soon as I selected the drop zone and confirmed the server maintenance countdown popped up.
---
Will try tomorrow again.
---
1. Pistols excel in pvp
---
2. Modern renegade already gives you increased vats chance and a chance to cripple
---
3. I’d be pissed if they put pistol perks in perc, I quite enjoy only needing 6 perception 
---
4. Tank killer would be nice for revolvers but really they just need to re work 2 of the 3 revolvers 
---
5. Pistols should never be on par damage wise with bigger and better guns. They should increase your MS and have lower vats, higher crits 
---
6. You have 4 str on your pistol build....
---
Another valid idea. I miss the way it was in Vegas where you had one set of perks that benefited ballistic weapons, or Lazer weapons on another perk. It would be pretty slick if the combined commando and guerilla or rifleman and semi pistols. Than you could grab a handmade for a main while toting a revolver as a side arm.
---
I tested it off a overlook tower instead of going straight to garahaan estate
---
Yeah agree
---
Many thanks.
---
Ah okay, I haven't heard of it until today. Hm.. seems interesting.
---
Thanks you for this. This kind of useful stuff should be on a sticky thread.
---
I don’t personally see Ironclad and similar as worth the value. Others are better.
---
To begin with, have a “serious combat” mode and a “general roaming around” mode and a “at my camp crafting” mode w/ your perk cards. We’ll assume you’re only interested in the first right now.
---
Removes:
---
* Remove White Knight 3
---
* Consider de-investing in sneak and instead putting it on your armor (shadowed mod) and/or chameleon
---
* I don’t see a ton of value in Ironclad / Evasive personally ... I never use them, and tend to not have issues at all
---
* I’m not convinced Happy Go Lucky and Professional Drinker are worth it for basically 3 luck. I rarely get addicted and I have a guy who swills Whiskey for the +6 STR. 
---
Add:
---
* Tenderizer, at least one point ... anything that needs more than one shot, make the next one hit harder
---
* Adrenaline, at least one point
---
* Replace with Covert Operative 3
---
* Escape Artist is great for re-triggering sneak
---
* Mutatations, esp. Eagle Eye for the crit
---
Maybe something like this: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f355cb&amp;d=pd2pk2pp2pl2p00c72ic4a72ar2lr2lt2cu0sg2an2a00a30ao0l71lv2eh2&amp;w=&amp;m=c5f9a&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
Points to play around with. Maybe a few in STR for Bandolier or Traveling Pharmacy if you find you are holding on to stuff, etc.
---
How is a 20% tax not punishing everyone?
---
lol the website math is wrong but the store is correct.
---
Super cute!!
---
The Radders. Not to be confused Raiders.
---
I'm not a content creator, so I'll just refer you to youtube. There are a TON of videos of different ways to farm caps quickly up to that rate. Once you get back you can send me the $100 ;)
---
Thanks man, also the thread is a much needed fresh air around here! :)
---
I would also like to add that the gold theme of WL (promotional art had gold in it, trailer shows a dweller gold panning and we know there is a "hidden secret underneath appalachia" so maybe that has something to with gold too?) might be their alternative currency/cap sink. they just need to better scout badges!
---
I am a little bit hopeful for them to solve this issue as a) they actually implemented some cut for vendor machines (10% I think?) meaning they expected caps to lose its value, tried to do something at least and b) Austin was in this whole "hibernation" period ever since Wild Ap. expansion (NW was made by an entirely different team), and it seems like they are monitoring fo76 forums too. 
---
76markets is in all out weimar republic mode right now with 556 being a new emerging currency and even simple bulk junk trades you can amass in an hour net you 2-3k caps, which is 10% of your stash! They must've seen the situation over there and at least asked some experienced ESO developers about what could've been done!
---
I think Austin is a nice team that is wayyy over their head with this patchwork of an engine but their ideas for mechanics were spot on with Wild Ap. - alcohol brewing, backpack, lego scripting, possum currency etc. I'm 99% sure they'll do something about the inflation.
---
Lol R.I.P. He don fucked up
---
I didn't think you could that's why I called you on it.
---
I like breakpoint lol, just not that stupid falling mechanic. Currently takingva break from F76 to play it.
---
as far as i know using up ap makes you also use more fusion core energie so you want to have a good supply of those 👍🏼
---
I don't believe I mentioned a 20% flat tax?
---
What's the prob with a little str? Luck is maxed, agil is maxed,.... So I pickup tenderizer for some damage? I like blocker for survivability. Usually don't need it. But there has been a number of.times it's bailed me out. Now if I ran a silenced 10mm I would drop blocker. But with revolvers stealth is broken on occasion so blocker is nice. I'm running 1 pt in sturdy frame untill I get the bigger backpack from the tadpole quests. It's nice having a little more carry room
---
I have the perk running uses no extra fusion core energy.
---
Understood - thank you!
---
I would save it.  If you're purchasing armor, then go for 3*.  For weapons, I would recommend 2*.  Most of the tertiary effects for weapons are crap anyway, so buy going for 2* weapons instead of 3* you double your chances of getting something good.
---
wasnt aware of that perk sorry :)
---
Its good. I think I'm set. I'm gonna start working on that when I get home
---
You can call it that if you want. But if someone on youtube can, so can I. And I do. I'm more than part of the problem, which is one reason I'm qualified to talk about it.
---
My disinclination to make or bother to upload the video is hardly any proof, especially in light of proof from others in the form of existing videos.
---
A few months ago I ironically had this same thought process after seeing a player look shockingly similar to IT.  However I couldn’t find clothes that look proper enough to even kinda resemble Freddy’s stripped Sweater. Now I only looked for the shirt over the course of  maybe two days? So there’s a chance they do have something! I just wish Bethesda still had the Ghoul Mask from Fallout 3! That would almost be perfect for Freddy’s face!
---
Agreed. White Knight and ironclad aren't necessary. You're always away from the action and when you do get seen, you run and use escape artist to get back those 2x sneak shots. I use 3 points into covert ops as well.
---
I call it bullshit just like I call bullshit on you editing the original post and removing your call for a 20% tax.
---
Thanks! Just recently traded for Be gatling plasma, my ultimate goal weapon
---
&gt;  I am offended
---
I am offended that your offended that it's offensive that I cant have a sweet ass plating as with your offensive golden .50 cal..  sniff. sniff.. now I feel offensively dis'ed that you have a prettier offensive weapon.
---
Played on PS4Pro and will pre-order for PC tomorrow. Will not bother with online but with the mods I will!
---
The idea that your gear should always get nerfed so that you have to search for more new gear that will get nerfed as soon as you get it is trash. I'm gonna say it's a hard NO.
---
Oh yeah, like at the outpost by Prime and various other locations? You can snap walls to them (Metal looks best) and put the green barricades above, but it's not ideal. I want the trailers usually in outposts as well, the beige ones with the orange stripe. They'd go well in my Camp outpost.
---
Ah shit, now I want to make another base. Even though my current one is fine
---
Blocker rank 3 reduces the incoming damage massively
---
I never said farming. I leave all of my characters at a train station when I leave the world. They don’t need to farm anything if they’re just selling serums.
---
Yes, one at a time per level.  I think you have to wait until 50 and move a spec instead of select a perk card.
---
Can definitely see the reason for the changes.  Although I'm supris... no, when I think about it... I'm trying to avoid getting hit to begin with, so why pump up my DR with IC/Evasive... I'm digging it.  Thank you!
---
At least then we could actually do the raid without crashing out and being unable to join because the servers are weak.
---
I can sell you nice bloodied 50/50 hunting rifle
---
How come you've never seen players in these skins already? They're pretty old by now
---
I would buy the plague rider
---
If you're going to make ultracite fusion or plasma cores try to always leave a few shots, then use the almost empties to craft ultracite...
---
Take 3 out of str and 6 out of perception . Add 5 to end(3 explosive resist, 3 ad skeleton) and add 4 to char( 4 lw,3 suppressor,1tenderizwr).. YW
---
auction house would fix so much about the game you couldn't imagine man. thing is, no matter how you get better at lets say amassing lead (learning farming routes, using excavator PA thus fusion core, manipulating market etc) you can't reliably move them since the only permanent way to show that you have huge amounts of lead to sell is posting online as you said. Your camp leaving the world with you is really bad for market based economy and is very anti-consumer. Auction house is permanent, anonymous and secure. 
---
Back in WoW, I had so much fun manipulating mats before raid/dungeon/faire etc weeks and then supplying them for a cheaper than raid week price (demand thus price goes up when a new raid hits), tanking server's prices down with me; making shit ton of gold for myself and enabling whole server to stock up mats cheaper than most servers. 
---
I love free market.
---
Drop rate for 'legendary drill' on SBQ **~~50%~~** **40% (0% chance!)**
---
Can confirm, scrapped mine. If it was 45 I would have kept it, but 35 I figured it was worth the  gamble.
---
I laughed way harder at this than I should have
---
The red and green fisherman overalls are as close as you can get.
---
Thanks
---
Wouldnt it be better to put that pack out at the beginning of the month so we can actually enjoy the season for a while tho :/
---
Whoa, what? For real? I’ve wanted to play RDR2!! Gonna have to check it out.
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
Turn on pacifist, avoid workshops, don't shoot at wanted players in case you forgot to turn pacifist on.
---
Multiple toons,
---
Why should the majority suffer because a minority want to game the system?  Most players can't make serums, does this mean you lose your ability to make serums once you make it much harder to earn caps because you bought you plans back when it was much easier to make caps.  How is that fair to players that start playing after the economic overhaul, they didn't get the chance to buy serum plans when caps were easier to get?
---
Logistically, this is improbable.
---
Breakpoint just feels to me like a huge step backwards from Wildlands.
---
Knowing bethesda the patch and atomic shop update will probably come on 29th of this month.
---
That's a tiny minority of players that are going to use 5 chars a day to cash in max caps.
---
About a half hour before they took the PC servers down for maintenance/patching today I fast traveled to a SBQ event and discovered ALL my .50 ammo had vanished. About 3K of the damn things. Sigh. Hopefully it comes back when I log in later.
---
I wonder if you could pick up some of those plastic pumpkins and display them in your display case.
---
Na, explosive resist maybe. Don't care for ad skeleton. Stimpacks heal limbs instantly . Supressor is only a 2 second debuff. Its nice for ffr guns. But on targeted you kill in one shot or a slower gun it's less beneficial. Tenderizer is ok but if you deal 500 damage to a target you gain what 25 damage? That's not a whole lot. I'd rather deal more damage to bugs and glowing and have better vats accuracy with perception. Crack shot does increase your vats lock range . Try it out and see. I don't PVP at all. Zero interest in it when playing fallout, maybe that's why I see perks differently. Idk.
---
I agree.  And even fewer have second accounts to transfer items without the aid of a friend.
---
Servers are probably busy because everyone is rushing to buy the new stuff. /s
---
I don't even play PVP, I was just throwing out a random possible explanation for why they may do what they do
---
If you have 3* for both lockpick and hacking, you can skip repairing the reactor. When going in to the reactor room, along the left hand wall, there’s a 3* door that leads to an office where you can cancel the reactor alert.
---
man I feel the exact oppisite, thats cool tho I respect you opinion. Im really digging the legendary effects.
---
This has been happening to me for the last few days.
---
knowing bethesda the update will come on 29th
---
Thanks so much :)
---
It’s still super easy to make caps. Kill super mutants or mole miners. Collect their weapons. Go sell them. Repeat. Uranium Fever generates enough to almost get your daily amount in one event.  Anyone can buy serum recipes. Making the serums is a pita though. They take rare resources and stable flux as ingredients. Stabilizing flux is not a trivial task. I’m doing a lot of work behind the scenes to set up my characters to get their max caps per day easily and quickly.
---
Someone started Encrypted day before yesterday. I had time get into my Power Armor and was about to fast travel when the dreaded 'Server not responding' message came up and soon got disconnected. Considering the recall thingy isn't cheap to buy, it really sucks to have that happen at such an inopportune moment.
---
If you go right on it, it lists all the ones that work.
---
What if we could use caps to roll perks on weapons or armor...10,000 caps for a 1*... 20,000 caps for a 2*.... 30,000 caps for a 3*
---
Look at the upside, atleast most of them are actually in our favor. Who can be mad at extra savings, right?
---
Turns out my math teachers were right about me all along...
---
Sorry about that! Article should be fixed up now. Thanks for reporting it.

it doesn't feel right to tax average dwellers for maybe 1%

and I also feel like this thread is about to get locked lol

lmao
---
Secure item-for-item trade should already be part of the game. The fact that it's not is frankly sad.
---
Caps have nearly no value at the moment, at least at the endgame. And while stash space is theoretically finite, it will go a long way when its 800 lbs + what? another 1k worth of carry weight x 5 characters? 
---
I think we're closer to agreement than you think. I'm arguing that we're already out of control and that the supply needs reduced to reintroduce value to caps. Once caps are viable as a form of payment for anything that is actually recognized a "good" (not just someone not knowing the value of what they're selling) then I'm all for the free market taking back over (see comment about not needing the cap limiter in a balanced economy). I'm all behind free market Austrian-theory economics.
---
I've seen them from 5k to 10k.
---
I personally don't even think I fit into a particular build, I just pick whatever perk works for me at the time. I know it doesn't answer the question, but why get hung up on labels?
---
What you just described is not generating 7000 caps in 2hrs, behind the scenes work counts too. 
---
But, the issue is that this post is calling for an overhaul of the economic system based on the play style of a small minority of the overall player base.
---
Also, the cores now have weight but it might still be worth it to invest in a trip in to a silo just far enough in to grab the damaged cores, then leave the silo and repair them and just keep them in your inventory for any future silo run. Much faster to pull damaged and replace with repaired cores without having to do the fix right then and you can take those damaged cores out with you.
---
It is. My first Charakter wasn't mutated. And he said something like:" No signs of radiation or mutations"
---
"Cannot place" is annoying but "cannot delete", how is that even a restriction? Beyond building floating castles in the sky, we should be able to delete anything
---
That's exactly what I was trying to say with the Purveyor re-roll system! Wouldn't that be amazing?
---
Better yet, what if you could pay to reroll a particular star, thus trying to fix a nearly-great weapon?
---
30,000 caps for the prefix
---
20,000 caps for the secondary
---
10,000 caps for the minor
---
Thank you
---
Very (Very) useful
---
Red and green skiing outfit works too....sorta. ☺
---
Why are you on this sub
---
There are always some Japanese players starting anew
---
I am not mad or anything, it's just weird lol.
---
In the words of someone I met recently: "Video or it didn't happen".
---
Trolls gonna troll.
---
Not a direct answer but I have seen people who create underground camps use a similar technique to get inside boarded up buildings.
---
That was what I was thinking. I was trying to offer alittle hope though 😅
---
"Yes it's a single action and should be slow" Yeah and it should be able to be hammer fanned too but we don't have that. *Angry revolver ocelot noises* Honestly I just hope Bethesda gives weapons a second look on usage the whole "some weapons have to be low tier" argument is invalid when we CAN have dramatic differences in weapon values with each level. Hope Bethesda does a universal pass on the weapons. Oh and add the bull barrel for the people who want it.
---
Sigh.  This is exactly the opposite way you grief bloodied players. Give them MORE rads and watch them freak out.  Couple of well placed shots with a gamma gun goes a long way.
---
You can! If you check my Twitter I did just that!  - [@RubyStatue778](https://twitter.com/RubyStatue778)
---
Can you not find the voices, or can you just not get the quest to progress?
---
whats the racist part man? you know mandingo is a porn star right?
---
In order for the PVP to have a future doesn’t it need to have a present in the game?
---
We got something of a Battle Royal in NW and Whack-a-Mole in Survival. If PVP is to be viable there needs to be consequences. If death is cheap there is no point.
---
power armor stations were especially buggy. but if you put them in before the roof it would work fine. And that lasted a long time after beta.
---
Sure you are, little guy. If you were the griefer you claim to be, you would have never made a suggestion like that because it would shrink your griefing pool if players had workshop protection.
---
No nuke mines... there’s some glitch/dupe people are doing but mainly cleavers so they get steel I believe.
---
But you still got the "You Have Been Insulted" note... So... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Holy hell ! Didn't see the news ! SO HYPED! Now i don't care about wastelanders anymore. So long !
---
They should all have grenade launchers too.
---
I swapped out the T51 legs for X01 legs as I liked the look of those better with the blackbird paint.  I use calibrated shocks instead of Overdrive Servos, but really if it meets your needs its all good.
---
I have 3 sets of level 50 T-51 and I want to mod them differently
---
So I'm a troll because I don't believe your ridiculous claim. So your telling me a person can launch a nuke, gather all the flux and other materials required to make 7000 caps worth of serums and distribute and sell all of these serums among 5 characters in less than 2.5 hrs?
---
Who's the troll here?
---
nice try. i think there should be modes for everyone to enjoy. i don’t care if my griefing pool
---
shrinks because then all us assholes will be lumped together in a big ol’ fist fight and then casual players can play in peace.
---
im sorry the concept of thinking of others’ enjoyment eludes you.
---
Yes! Smaller versions of the towers at the factory to let everyone know the truck is open for business.
---
I've known war rider for a while but figured it was standalone so no assumption of the 4 horsemen, and only saw black rider maybe a couple a days ago for the first time but this is the first time seeing all 4 in the shop, I'm assuming it came out when I took a break from the game
---
Doctors say that Nordberg has a 50:50 chance of living, thought there’s only a 10% chance of that.
---
This is good info. Thanks for sharing.
---
My son played RDR and will probably do RDR2.  Sounded like some fun but I am going Outter Worlds when I want a break from FO76 (with a little CIVVI Read Death BR mixed in).
---
Wow... I sold 2 salty's for 1000 each. :(  oh well--- at least they aren't taking up stash space.
---
Ah, i see. You could easily have missed one in the shop because there were only 1 each week
---
I remember coming across one before... or it’s a FO4 flashback.
---
Vampire is very good on Heavy weapons. With explosive it makes you immortal. VE 50 cal hits 8 times per second of those hits heals 80 HP. Great for tanks.
---
If you have already launched one before you just need to go to the silo with the code. Same as before. You only needed to do the mama dolce thing the first time.
---
Thank you!  I love to help others, especially low level players who are at a loss with the lack of information the game shares. 
---
I sure as hell knew I was there too! And still learning at that, haha.
---
Is that worth doing though? Do the boarded up houses have interiors do you know?
---
Makes sense and love the design of them too, would be sad I missed them but happily back for the second coming
---
Same price as before.
---
This irritated me more than anything. Also sometimes it \*will\* let you rotate the floor as long as you aren't moving it, and sometimes it just won't.
---
You're looking at the same info everyone else is. They update it regularly.
---
Bamboozled again!
---
I suspect you meant "imaginary"
---
No, the "evil socialists" are not imaginary.  Neither are the quick to offend snowflakes. 
---
Hit a nerve did I.  You can usually tell when the offended decends into name calling because they cannot make an intelligent counterpoint.
---
You know what the best part about them rereleasing so much old stuff like this that was supposedly vaulted already?
---
We never, ever have to feel pressured to buy a damned thing in their shop because "limited time" is virtually meaningless.
---
No problem. Keep on writing
---
Pistols need a 300% buff
---
logically there is a hierarchy to pieces that depend on other pieces. If you mess around with it enough it actually sort of makes sense.
---
It's still just dumb to have in the first place though, and implemented badly as-is. The whole foundation thing is the crux of it.
---
  Are you trying to be bloodied or no?
---
Bethesda could even make some $ by putting the truck in the atomic shop and have it work like the greenhouse or camper. Of course they could always give it to us for free (or have a dirty free version) but need to sweeten the deal for them a bit.
---
Yeah.
---
I’d wait for 50% off.
---
I agree that the 10% cut from player vending is encouraging, but it was too little too late.  The real money never goes through the player vendors.
---
I absolutely agree about the out-of-control state of the trade boards. I've been chasing a few things for a while, but the goalposts keep moving. It's forcing me into the same model as everyone else.  Economic herd theory? The other problem with the boards is that it limits the economics to just those willing/able to figure them out. They can be a bit overwhelming at times.
---
Implementing a secure in-game barter system (like a barter Auction House) would go a long way to fixing some of the extra-game shenanigans that go on, and would help to limit the scamming.
---
I'm afraid it's gonna be if. We have four days left and are about to hit the first stretch goal.. fingers crossed we reach the third.
---
Well, the one I actually entered was small and only had the exterior walls that were see-through.  I have not been inside a larger structure myself.

perhaps the melee exploit that allows for damage over 110

They can be finicky about the spot you are standing in when you take the pic. Standing beside the sign with the gas prices works most every time.
---
Please elaborate, that's interisting.
---
PC, but thanks for the thought.
---
That sounds reasonable.  I am trying to cut down to one suite of armor myself.  Not there yet though.
---
I'm a L142 Melee, 1H weapon.  Weapon of choice is a vampire switchblade.  Backup is The Gutter (non legendary assaultron blade with added energy damge + heath regen)  
---
My perks have been the same since about L65/70.
---
I cant see your build from where I am, so I'll tell you what I remember of mine.
---
S: Martial artist3, incisor3, gladiator2, bandolier1 (swing speed, armor penetration, lighter ammo)
---
P: glow sight (helps in nuke zones), green thumb (great for flux), tank killer, ground pounder, commando, lockpick3
---
E: ghoulish, fireproof (helps against SB gas attacks)
---
C: lone wander, tenderizer
---
I: Stablized3 (yea, heavy weapon - makes life much easier against flying things)
---
nerd rage, adrenaline, first aid1, radx boost1(cant remember the name)
---
A: actiongirl, thru hiker, adrenaline
---
L: starched genes, class freak (I had bloodymess3 until I started toying with mutations)
---
Mutations: marsupial, healing factor, adrenal reaction, speed demon
---
electrical charge and grounded.  (careful with electrical - in a large mob, the charge you get can be hazardous. Grounded reduces energy weapon dmg)
---
I have scaly skin but havent taken it yet b/c I'm considering losing all mutations and starting over w/o electrical charge.
---
Twisted muscles is good, but you lose gun accuracy, so havent taken this one
---
I use PA, so I have motion assist servos and optimied bracers for + 2 Str each.
---
after lvl 50 you will get the option to move a point or pick a perk card when you level.
---
So you can change your build around, it just takes a little bit of work.
---
I asked one about that one time, and all it did was smack me upside the head so I am guessing yes.
---
I don’t think they are going to send the police unless you made a credible threat. Like you actually have to demonstrate that you have the capacity to carry out that threat. Usually they just put you on a naughty list and pretty much refuse service to you. 
---
Getting refunds on games is usually a losing battle anyway, probably want to save yourself the anguish of yelling at a lowly paid cst who couldn’t even help you if they wanted to. You can rent games to try them out, if you aren’t sure if you’re going to like it, to avoid this situation in the future.
---
Yeah you can switch around perks at the cost of a level up point after level 50
---
A dupe with a autohotkey script

I went to Watoga Station last week and it was just covered in cleavers. My game crashed so I didn't get to look around much but I was wondering what that was all about. Why would they pile them out in the world though?
---
Thank you so much this is exactly where I found it.
---
Wasnt sure if I was missing something thanks for the info
---
There’s zero reason to lock any of your camp. I judge locked camp people very harshly.
---
:D
---
on the road from manoga powerplant there is an unmarked one.
---
This is a good idea, but it would be much more simple to just have the plans and recipies in the nuka cola factory.
---
I like collecting T-51 so that's why I have all those
---
Well said. Unlike the idea of each weapon in its category has specific pros and cons. Not one is better than the other in almost  everyway. It creates more variety in gear and builds.
---
And chair rail wallpaper where only the bottom half of the wall has it. And wallpaper rings just around the top.
---
Regularly means maybe once a day
---
I got you. If your on Xbox I can just send you a pic of my build. I’m at 5300 per hit with 3 pieces of unyielding.
---
If you like fallout it’s worth it. I have about 700hrs in and I still play it weekly (since the beta started).
---
I’m not a hatter I got the game for 20$ but I don’t think it be worth 40$ (Digital on PSN) unless you have friends who play it
---
Lmao this stuff is bad.
---
Fix PvP? Add survival back and make stealthboys reveal you when you attack. 
---
Just these two fixes would go a long way
---
&gt; she almost dies... then suddenly, without any explanation, is perfectly fine afterward?
---
You've heard of stimpaks, right?
---
&gt;standing in front of shots
---
dude I am literally crying ahahahahahahha that must've felt awful but you gotta admit that sounds funny
---
Yeah it looks pretty grim. The sb’s were way more fun. I’ve been clearing as many as I can but I feel like it isn’t as much of a challenge as the SB’s from a player standpoint, and is more of a grind.
---
I would:
---
1. Drop the "directional audio" perks in P and put the two points in Concentrated Fire,
---
2. Remove Professional Drinker in E and put the three points in A instead,
---
3. Drop Evasive in A and replace it with Covert Operative, Escape Artist and Mister Sandman,
---
4. Optionally replace Action Boy with Gun Fu, if that doesn't affect your AP management too badly.
---
Those might be just personal preferences, but this build served me well so far.
---
WHOA! Calm down dude, jesus...
---
There are already 2 more confirmed raids in the pipeline so no, not just for 94. This would just be a good time to implement it before adding in more content. That way they can test as they go. Something non beth developers call, testing.
---
I mean I agree with you, but it's Bethesda, so the likelihood that will ever happen is pretty much non-existent, and is exactly why I no longer will be spending any money in the Atom Shop.
---
I cant get the quest to progress.
---
ikr? the same platform for once? XD  
---
im on now btw, but not for long. it was a super hard day at work...  
---
did you send me an invite? i did not get any
---
I paid $60 when it was released and i've got my money's worth during the 800 hours i invested into the game. So yes, the game is worth it.
---
You have to investigate the cabins, then follow the wire to the treehouse, and then read the entries on the terminal and turn off the sound.
---
I buy nuka colas for up to 10c so that I can make standard nuka grenades.  They are moderately more effective than plasma and MIRV grenades, as the MIRV grenades seem buggy, working to their full potential only a small percentage of the time.
---
dude I don't know why maybe I'm in auisse servers but everyone has been so nice even in uranium fever, constantly emoting and letting up to 6 people tag and stuff. 
---
that griefing sounds funny tho, I especially cracked up at the post above with people standing in front of shots. I wish those happened to me too game gets kinda stale sometimes, would change things up a bit
---
It's at 16.88m now. New current goal is 20m
---
I'd agree that there's almost always a way to do it, but for many cases you have to tear down half the structure first because of all the dependencies.
---
Also at a high level, it's just bad design all over.
---
You sir. Are the real MVP.
---
I'd like to do more with my camp, but have no budget left.
---
Makes the sentence starting with "that item is really cool, and I have the atoms..." finish with 
---
"...but I can't place the all the cool stuff I have now, so .... no."
---
16.68M an hour ago.
---
As the title of the post suggests to this isn't for Bethesda.  It's for those of us curious what patch day brought while we are bored at work anxious to play tonight, which includes additions and sales in the Atomic shop.  What isn't needed is you shitting on someone who went out of their way to put the post together for us.
---
Math is hard.
---
It has it's moments. If they would invest more time and effort into fixing bugs and refining the game instead of just the Atom Shop, it could be a LOT better. It has so much potential, and I hold on to hope that Wastelanders is going to be a complete restructure if the game to make it feel more like an online experience, instead of clinging so haphazardly to the Creation Engine experience.
---
Wait... The solder, or the curator??
---
If that's someone's kd then yes
---
same here man! just me and my 3 usd purchase lol
---
Def using Ghoulish. Also good late in the round for ducking into the storm to avoid players. ;)
---
I did the same thing in vanilla and BC WoW. That's where I got started in video game economies. Now I can't play one without analyzing it (like this) and breaking it.
---
Watch the trailer again. There is a scene exactly showing this.
---
Screwing around maybe?
---
Dunno if that would even be possible, but maybe take the players that enter a Raid instance and put them on a special server instead of having them stay on the "open world server" would do the trick. Meaning they get transported to the Raid server when they enter the Vault, not choose it from the main menu like you possibly meant.
---
I know of one small house that you can get into using the chair glitch.  The exterior walls become see through if you are inside.  It was a small house so no interior walls were present.
---
Do you like grindy sandbox games.  If so, you will like it.
---
Do you like Fallout.  If so, you will like it.
---
Do you like open world questing.  If so, you will like it.
---
Do you like battle royal PVP.  If so, you will like it.
---
Do  you like to create things in a virtual world.  If so, you will like it. 
---
Basically, yes, its worth it, if you like the kind of game it is.   Its got open world RPG elements, Building elements, Survival elements, PVP elements, and a social aspect.
---
Very cool thanks
---
I thought this was a PSA, now I'm disappointed that it's not already there! lol
---
Ill try that. I dont recall ever having to do that tho. The other two times i just had to talk to jaggy and it would start the next part. Ty
---
It’s my personal belief that the SA needs something beyond just a Damage buff. There needs to be a unique incentive across all weapons to give them relevance, the SA Revolver especially. 
---
I use a IE 25% Less VATS SA Revolver and it’s probably the only roll that stands a chance of doing great damage. At minimum, you can one shot headshot whitespring ghouls; unfortunately, limited by six bullets.
---
Revolvers should ideally have unique VATS options like ammo dumping into an enemy or quick firing all nearby enemies in the head.
---
Maybe we're talking about a different quest, I'm talking about the screams out in the Forest area.
---
as someone who is at work RN,.. i really appreciate posts like this.  Thanks!
---
Go to the Aaronholt homestead in the northern Forest and pick yourself every cranberry you can.  Get plenty of sleep, and cook whatever you an with the cranberries.  Head over to Whitesprings and have the robots help you kill ghouls. Lather, rinse, repeat.
---
Good games coming up. Outter worlds , RDR2 for PC, Cyberpunk . Keep that PC, you'll need it !
---
I have been waiting for that Black Rider for a long time...
---
OK, here's an off the wall idea which I'm not sure works but might be worth thinking about:
---
Buying serums from MODUS is expensive and looks like it might have been intended as a cap sink. Except it doesn't work because 
---
a) Starched Genes means that you buy each serum you want exactly once and
---
b) Players craft and sell serums for far less than the vendor price or, even worse, craft and sells serums to vendors turning serums into a cap source.
---
So? Remove the Starched Genes perk and the ability of players to craft serums, make sure that anything in the game that removes rads also has a chance to remove mutations (Nuka-Grape, I'm looking at you). This not only has the effect of turning a cap source into a cap sink but also means that rads continue being a threat to high level players relying on mutations, i.e. almost everyone, and not just to characters fresh out of the vault. This might hit some builds harder than others, bloodied builds especially, but as I said, it's off the wall and I haven't thought this all the way through, but I wanted to throw it out there anyway.
---
Awesome not sure why it's not updated when I pulled it up
---
Unfortunately that doesn’t help much. I only tried red rockets on the list and had to go through almost the entire list of 15+ just to get 5 to work
---
I've been playing for a few months now but I didn't know about armors having heavy/sturdy parts... glad I opened this link lol
---
A super Mutant scalped it.
---

---
someone was present as u were loading into the world. while loading in your camp is 100% vulnerable until u enter the world and can move AND world items/structures render.
---
I gotta learn these weapons.  I mean,  being entirely honest.  I played heavy for the first three months then shut it off until this week.  Im excited to get back into it.
---
I bought it on a whim way back when it first launched while everyone was pooping on it and quite like it.  I don't play it every day or anything but I've consistently come back to it.  I wouldn't be surprised if there was a sale of free weekend coming up with the Wastelander update next month.
---
That's odd, I was picking from memory. 2 didn't work so I checked the list for the last one i needed. I guess I got lucky. 🤔
---
I got an explosive one off a friend other day  it shouldn't take 2 shots to kill level 5 SMs at level 106.. definitely needs love
---
Thanks. Honestly the biggest offender I always see people agree on is the lack of AA for pistols. But I truly wish they made the SAA fannable the demand is clearly there when you look into the mods. But again back to what I was saying just to give an example and I'm not ingame so these numbers are purely an example but with the leveled system we could have a black powder rifle that goes up 20 DMG in level but also the reload rate could also go up. Rather than Bethesda following the weird oh per 5-10 levels we add 10 only DMG why not tweak other stats. And while we are at it add those AUX stats on the UI such as reload times this nonscene saying GREATLY or exceptionally minor does not tell me what it does I want numbers and %'s I mean for god sake if I have to look at a wiki (i use gamepedia) to build my weapon how I optimally want it instead of the game then you've failed me as a player. Sorry for slightly veering off topic just some additional ideas and peeves i have with the system overall.

Ultra Stimpak
---
I just lost a full set of fully modded up x-01 armor last evening :(  Shit happens and I'm in the process of making a new set.  Oh well.
---
I keep telling myself that I somehow accidentally dropped the armor but I think I got hit by a glitch somewhere.
---
Bold thought! Definitely would fall into the unpopular category, and it might die on that alone, but from a gameplay cycle perspective it could work. Maybe.
---
It is and that’s the problem, not a problem with playstyle but for pistols . They are already really strong for pvp so buffing them in general would make them the new fotm. That’s why I think they need to buff just 2 of the revolvers and open up tank killer . 
---
My buddies been trying to get me to try out plasma pistols but I hate to lose grounded. Says they’re really good tho
---
Basically all of the mods for 76 are QoL mods at this point. It's not really possible to add new content to the game unless you consider changing the faces of the scorched to Todd Howard as content.
---
Go to the 76 Nexus site and sort all mods by most endorsements to find the best ones. Install all the ones you think will be useful for you. My top recs would be Perk Loadout Manager, Better Inventory, Old Repair, Save Everything, and Improved Health Bars if you're a bloodied build.
---
I think on PC it's a bit harder. I have one in my vendor for about 3K and no bites. 2K for the mod plans resulted in one sale yesterday/ I have two more to drop in. I also have about 6 meat cleaver plans but I suspect they are close to worthless...
---
That black raider might be cooler than liberty prime gives me Dishonored vibes, the war raider is badass too rocking those Doom vibes 🤘
---
Drop "Pack Rat." Junk belongs in your stash. "Blocker" is flat melee damage resistance, and invaluable for unforeseen melee attackers.  Best balance of DR/ER without considering Rad Resist is BoS Heavy Combat Chest, 2 Heavy Polished Metal Limbs, and 2 Heavy Studded Leather limbs. Best balance of DR/ER/RR is BoS Heavy Combat Chest, 4 Heavy Robot Limbs.
---
The throwable dupe glitch?
---
Works for me. I've been killing Mirelurks for it.
---
Love this u should work for them u are coming up with better stuff then them
---
&gt; "why do you guys jump all the time with a wire in your hand?"

Classic.

Or “he looked like he was going to punch me, but then he threw a grenade over my shoulder.”

I can tell you that the nula cola painted dudes in survival were absout tanks in the final version. That stuffs strong
---
Hi, looks like your damage perks are pretty solid but I'd suggest you de-emphasize the protective perks or at least reorient them to "don't get hit" rather than "mitigate damage of hits." You're not taking best advantage of stealth without Escape Artist and Covert Operative. You will never be tanky and you shouldn't have to be, the best way for you to stay alive is 1. kill things fast 2. stay hidden, and those perks let you do that. Most of the time you should only be taking incidental damage from when  enemies are firing randomly in your general direction while you're staying mobile, sneaking around in the bushes and picking them off in Caution. When you mess up, it's usually better to sprint away and re-stealth than try to stand your ground; I find that Escape Artist and one rank of Born Survivor or one piece of Auto-Stim armor is enough for almost all Oh Shit situations. Once you're a ghost, most of the enemies who pose a problem are the ones who do non-ballistic damage area attacks at your hidden position: Scorchbeasts, Mirelurk Kings and Queens, and the like. IMO 3 ranks of Fireproof is a better use of your END than Ironclad because it turns Scorchbeast screeches into a tickle. Their farts are still a problem but poison resist armor can help with that.
---
I'd also suggest multiple mutations if you're not some kinda BOS purity freak. Marsupial is like playing a whole different game as a sniper, you can hop up onto roofs and places many ground-based enemies can't follow, and Speed Demon makes it so much less painful to be crouch-waddling around the countryside 24/7. Those two have extremely marginal drawbacks so you don't even need Class Freak, but once you get mutated you may find you want more! Bird Bones and Eagle Eye are also nice.
---
Re: armor, supposedly weight does matter in stealth and I have seen some purists go full shrouded wood for that reason, but in my experience stealth is already so powerful with max AGI and stealth perks that I just wear whatever and I'm still invisible sneaking in an open field in broad daylight most of the time.
---
Im talking about the order of the tadpoles. The backpack quest as everyone calls it.
---
I recommend max damage rifle or heavy gun build. I go with heavy + rifle max damage build and I have to give away some quality of life perks for it but it is worth it
---
Yeah. Just yesterday I acquired all the plans to make it
---
No it was where you used this script to place items in your camp power armor station and delete your camp box have someone pick up the items and you drop and item and get rolled back
---
I logged in a few days ago, and unfortunately, a massive Scorchbeast battle was taking place right where my camp was. And my camp became an immediate target for the SB. I logged off as quickly as I could, but when I went to a new server the damage was already done, and several structures were destroyed.
---
Ohhhhhhhh. That I don't know. Did it give you any of the other things to do in the area? I think that's how you push it forward maybe.
---
Gotcha, thanks!
---
Atom shop fixed immediately. Imagine that.
---
Dude calm down. I just wanted to see what it looked like. Sorry if I came off aggressive earlier.
---
Getting people used to working as a team is vital.  Calling out targets and locations, covering one another, having complementary weapons, sharing equipment, etc.
---
Gotta get those spooks
---
Why
---
Do it solo...It’s easier
---
Wait,so they fixed that? Never seen that before
---
It just says find the source of the noises. All the videos i watched just shows them talking to the robot and it progresses but i sat there for ages interacting with him and got nothing done
---
Not always. I had a structure that had a stand-alone staircase (the default metal one) popping up as unable to remove. It wasn’t supporting anything; it was literally the only thing sitting on an otherwise flat floor level.
---
So I added a second stair at a perpendicular angle to try to trick it. End result? **Two** stairs I could no longer move.
---
For fun, I actually added a single staircase on every floor tile on the 3x4 level. Every single one was immediately unremovable. (As was the floor below.)
---
Sometimes, stuff just breaks in a way you can’t fix it.
---
So there were no other objectives that popped up, like find the this or retrieve the something?
---
You can't force people to raid on the servers but D3 did it just fine. Have servers for what people want to do. Only made the game better.
---
Raid, events, and original. 
---
There are zero things that prevent this. They have already shown they can add options to the menu screen with nw and survival. Its as simple as adding it and labeling it. They have zero other things they have to do.
---
Because of the explosive effect...yes more damage but...say a group of super mutants is chasing you and they're all bunched up....you kill the first one one shot no problem...but that little bit of AE explosive damage hits everyone else and now negates the instigating for the rest....hope I painted a clear picture

---
They mentioned it at Quakecon, but didn't give a concrete timeline. Just that it was coming "sooner than we'd expect", which I guess means development's going well but they're still not ready to set a date.
---
Last thing they said was at quake con, where they just said ''They are coming sooner than you think."
---
Recipe: Delbert's Traditional Chitlins  is currently not obtainable. It's supposed to be located at the Spruce Knob campground and what is found is a static object that you can't interact with on a picnic table next to a cooler.
---
Wish I could say I spent just three bucks. Instead I gave Bethesda the benefit of the doubt and decided I'd buy all their ten dollar, outfit included packs, even if I wasn't interested in the outfit itself. That way I could get a nice amount of atoms and still support the dev team pretty decently. That stopped when, on the same day they decided to charge full price for the Arktos Pharma fridge, I loaded into the game and crashed five times in five minutes. You need money from the Atom Shop to make the game better? Well I need to see the game actively improving in order to justify spending more money in the Atom Shop. Make a concentrated effort to improve the game and I'll pull out my wallet again. In the meantime, my money is staying with me.
---
There is a place out in the mire where the ticks are at that you can build in, if that is the sort of thing you were asking about
---
Im going to start swapping my perks.   Definitely going to look into this.  
---

---
I’ve been seeing this for weeks. Usually playing a while or logging out/back in seems to do the trick sometimes.
---
It was mentioned back in August that they were 'closer than we think' but it's really anyone's guess.
---
I believe so.
---
I still haven't entered vault 94, so I'm going off what I've seen here. Haven't seen anyone say they've lost their whole character recently, but it was a thing when the vault raid was introduced.
---
It is the strongest build in the game by a huge margin. It deserves lots of drawbacks
---
Brotherhood for sure, although I’m also down with Enclave.
---
Vigor was a good concept, but didn’t feel rewarding.
---
Nope. I did a daily prior to starting this that was in its area but thats pretty much it
---
Thanks. I'll look into it again.

Yeah there’s a map floating around somewhere on this sub, try the search bar or wait for somebody that has it saved.  It’s really useful and has a lot of cool areas.
---
I do know super mutants drop screws maybe the place that has a load of super mutants might have it... Maybe?
---
Super weird. Idk then man.
---
Sorry. Bad day. I apologize. But yeah. If you got a psn i can send a screenshot
---
Yep, exactly! We all know a few specific IGNs that do this to us...
---
I’ve lost legendaries both armor and weapons. Just vanished. This was before the scrip so no I didn’t scrip them by accident.
---
It has drawbacks. It shouldn't have glitches causing drawbacks. The number one drawback is health; with death happening in seconds with rads or a strong enemy hit. Serendipity is 45% chance of no damage at Bloodied health and still you die more often than not. 
---
Instead of Bloodied being nerfed, they should buff Junkies, Berserkers, Mutants, and all specific enemy damage types so they are more usable.
---
Gotcha.  I’d  use something automatic in those situations.
---
[I do it kind of like this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=7c455bc&amp;d=sa0sg2pd2pk2e82c72i11ic2a72lr2l11pp1pl2lt2a02e00a31lv1s50si0sj0l71ao0an0ar0p00cu0&amp;w=p80p90c52i30ia0ij2i42iq2at1lm2pa0&amp;m=8c&amp;nw=&amp;n=)
---
Took me a looooong time to figure that tidbit out, and it makes a real difference going from 5 pieces of light weight to 5 pieces of heavy.
---
**For example**: [I just looked up the graph again]:
---
Light combat chest base = 36 Ballistic resistance, 36 Energy resistance 
---
Heavy combat chest base = 61 Ballistic resistance, 61 Energy Resistance 
---
**Same with combat limbs**:
---
Light combat limbs base: 12/12
---
Heavy combat limbs base: 20/20 
---
The difference is day and night, heavy armor is extremely desirable. 
---
**P.S.**: If you are a lover of combat armor like me, don't forget about Brotherhood of Steel paint plans at **Grafton Station.**
---
The 3 plans are called *Plan: BoS Combat Armor Arms*, *Plan: BoS Combat Armor Chest Piece*, and *Plan: BoS Combat Armor Legs*.
---
All 3 of these will add 25/25 resistances to a combat chest and 15/15 to legs and arms!
---
It's been updated and we've passed the first stretch having killed 16.88m. The next stretch is 20m and we have until the 14th to hit that and the next one, so another full weekend of cleaning left.
---
Thank you! Much Love!
---
Wheres that at?

Misread that as Otter Worlds, which would be linked to Untitled Goose Game.
---
yeah but if it was in 76 you would be able to play it to actually earn resources to use in adventure
---
Well it hasn't been one day, it's been one year. it's the same as the quarry in fallout 4 that you can drain. one day you come back and the raiders have set up a full camp.
---
But if you're getting it for 50% off, buying a 3* weapon for 50, selling it for 40, gets you more rolls to maybe run into something useful.
---
Another one can be "wow Appalachia must've sucked without us!"
---
It could, but if they are bank characters, they dont care about weight. They are just always overweight.
---
Yeah that works...but a regular instigating will just mow em all down one by one...anyways good luck hope I helped
---
How is the Death Rider power armour? Worth a pick up? I missed it last time it was available.
---
Well if you do the insect daily for pompley at dolly and do not have a tic sac on you it is where the tic circle is. I want to say it is south by southwest of harpers off the road near a power line tower. It has been a couple of weeks since I last went there.
---
That was my first and only nuke launch experience as well. I still have yet to try again
---
Yea I think this was Bethesda's lame ass attempt to make flux useful past Calibrated shocks and Jet packs.
---
I hope this does not happen.  Modding will kill the game off.
---
Private servers will also kill the game off. 
---
This is an online experience, and private servers basically take that experience away. 
---
If you want to mod and play by yourself, go play Fallout 4
---
one of the best ideas ive read on here. This would be fun for the whole community and would probably bring a lot of people back for at least a short amount of time
---
Yea cause respawning never glitches.... if it's in the wild or after a pvp it's fair game.
---
It's interesting people would pay so much just for the extra DR / ER / RR (?) basically. I'll have to do more armor research apparently.
---
I love how everyone is like "they said in one year" when actually Pete Hines said at THE EARLIEST one year and we should be glad they said earlier than we think.
---
You can add my husband and I. We both have a hard time talking because we're weird I guess. Lol
---
Vomit coughin and pubgesus69 we be adults, i swear.
---
Oh there is also a pretty cool where you enter from the roof and it is a whole underground area in the mire that one was kinda close to the abandoned waste dump only saw it one time when i took the elevator out and found strangler pods all over kinda followed them to it I think it was just a little south of that exit.
---
Lets in 4 rads tho... Not great in a nuke zone.
---
i sell them for 250 caps because they arent hard to make and people will buy many at once to either sell for profit or give to friends, while im here using my serums and marine helmet recipe to get caps from the vendors. everyone wins
---
It seems to be extremely picky on Xbox. I wouldn’t be surprised if there isn’t a few feet area that works in each area. I didn’t have much luck next to the signs but did in the dead center of the stores.
---
I'm not sure there is a big economic problem for the average player. I'm guessing I put a little more into the game than the average player and I've never hit 30k caps, I've come close but not all the way. From what I've seen in game (I'm on PC, consoles may have a different vibe) most people are extremely generous and aren't trying to get every cap they can get a day. For those out there that try to get every cap they can they'll just figure out a way to game any other economic system put in place. For them that's what a big part of the game is about, amassing as much as possible which is fine but not everyone else plays that way. Myself, I sell disease cures and healing salve for 2 caps and Stimpacks for 6 caps in the forest to low level players so I'm not gaining anything from that, but that's my play style.
---
r/usertagchecksout
---
Yeah. I kind of like it because I have the ghoulish perk and it heals your rads you lose so I can heal a lot
---
You know what, I h8 seasonal updates that change the gameplay by rebalancing everything they have just for the sake of rebalancing.
---
This had happened to me on every scorched earth I've been involved with. I just figured it was my crappy internet
---
The more things change...
---
Yea the script got leaked like 2/3 days ago but you wouldnt known unless you actively looked for it you can google it like fallout 76 dupe script and do 1 week ago search and plaves like mpgh and unknowncheats have it
---
Psn kassabosko
---
Psychobuff: +25% damage and +3 STR. You get +5% per STR so that's a solid 40% incease in melee damage.
---
I admit I'm not terribly fond of the idea myself - I \*like\* not having to worry about rads, TYVM - but I also have this strong preference for tweaking existing mechanics in a game as opposed to introducing new ones to solve existing problems. And I like addressing multiple problems with one set of tweaks.
---
Would I prefer the introduction of a taxed global auction house or some of the other proposals here? Sure. But rads not being much of a problem for high level players just rubs me the wrong way and the strangeness of the whole proposal is weirdly appealing to me...
---
As always, I'm just waiting for the greenhouse dome to return.
---
Saving 1200 for that.  Should that be enough?  Does anyone remember how much the bundle that it was part of sold for?  Maybe 1800 is safer.
---
what about the overseer lol
---
Another burial needs your help.
---
Hiya!  Another sniper here.  Thought I'd show you what my loadout is like...

It's a little unconventional because of the high intelligence, but it lets me be crafty and help out other new players.  I think aside from what others have said about dropping the booze and the collector focused perks, I would drop down that endurance when you have a chance.  If you want to play it stealthy, there's not much there that could help you.  You would be better off shifting some of those points to your Agility to make the most out of your stealth skills, and/or maybe luck to get them critical hits in.  I'm at level 99, and I still do little tweaking.  What you have so far shouldn't be too hard to refine into something a little more lethal.
---
Psycho buff like the other guy said , unarmed bobble head , whiskey
---
It is quite strange but when you think about it you can see there's no real way to get higher Damage resistance besides trading from lame armor [wood] up to combat and marine. 
---
After that it's only modified by perks like Ironclad. 
---
Also a great piece of information is that the dense chest mods give you 100% explosive resistance. Which also rolls into the scorchbeast sonic attacks.
---
Also, claim workshops. Be careful, you may have to pvp, but I think I've only had to once or twice. Usually when that happens,  I just walk away, and have been fortunate not to get griefed. 
---
This is how I leveled my bloodied explosive shotgun build, from 1 to 50.
---
"It's called Sex Deathclaw by Odeon. It's made with bits of real Deathclaw,  so you know it's good. They've done studies, you know. Sixty percent of  the time, it works every time."
---
I’ve gone in at least 5 times since and haven’t seen as much lag so my guess is that they made it less laggy to reduce the chance of that happening
---
Good to know, thanks
---
They're 15 slots and provide suboptimal preservation. Plus you can't even sell directly in vendors from the fridge. The biggest thing from camp fridges for me would to be able to sell cold items in my vendor.
---
I think heavy studded leather limbs, scout polymer limbs, and heavy BOS combat armor limbs are all superior to robot limbs.  I  don't find the rad resistance from armor that useful.  When you do come in contact with radiation, whether you have a bit of resistance or not, it's still going to knock you down from your ideal health level, whether that be 100 percent for your vanguard's armor or 19.9 percent for your bloodied build.
---
Cool, thanks for the info
---
Shovel is hidden behind church in Flatwoods...
---
thanks. does psycho stack with this?
---
A few thoughts: 
---
1. I'm more concerned with the typical player's experience than the experience of the most active players and traders. Many casuals don't regularly hit the cap and they don't trade on Reddit. Most casuals still have plans and mutation recipes to buy from NPCs. Casuals still have lots of items to craft-and-scrap for mods. They're experiencing a different economy. 
---
2. Dedicated single-character players are the main "victims" of the daily cap limit. 
---
3. I don't know any dedicated multi-character players who hit the cap and scrip maximums on every character everyday. Your 7,000 caps per day number is largely academic. The 1,400 per character total maters far more than the theoretical 7,000 limit (which still isn't a limit since another copy of the game is hardly a hurdle, but sanity reaches a limit). 
---
4. Charging for event participation requires careful balance. Events that required multiple attendees for success were poorly attended before they implemented free fast travel to public events. The raids are already under-attended. 
---
Also, regarding items as stores of cap value: 
---
1. Stash limits and item transfers limit the hoarding of gear. 
---
2. Items are illiquid may be as worthless as caps. 3\* gear is a poor hedge against inflation where we know the system can support 5\* gear. The fixer already demonstrates the risk in hoarding handmades. 
---
3. Players' ability to storing cap-value as items is limited by their inability to buy valuable items for caps. 
---
Good luck with the project, but I really don't think there's much that couldn't be fixed with simple but carefully added caps sinks.
---
What are you taking about? They've been consistently releasing new items in the store.
---
Nope, it IS psycho
---
 In past weeks, I have noticed that many of my c.a.m.p's turrets is just lost. When I try to add them again it says that the maximum is already full even though the UI says otherwise. I found a one year old tip to remove the level below where the lost ones were getting back to the stored tab. This tip worked. Good Bethesda with updates!
---
Wanting camp restrictions gone is ridiculous, the staircase connecting it to the ground bases are bad enough
---
Ok, thanks
---
Will Update, thanks for letting me know
---
Bleh. Boy scouts for adults.  Raiders for life (avg 22 years)
---
The sound index on the flamer is set to Normal while the other heavy weapons are Loud or Very Loud. This means you can chain multiple sneak attacks in a row without immediately being detected. Strap on Covert Operative and Concentrated Fire and start melting faces at 5x your listed damage. The ammo hunt sucks, but you use a lot less playing it stealthily.
---
Charleston train station. Directly across from it is a barn you can build in and around.
---
Be warned tho. People still think it stops the spawn of the responder bot even tho it just moves it. Great place for activity and the best spot for selling. High and low lvls travel thru all the time.
---
But it's also popular so get ready for server hop frustrations. I eventually moved but it was hands down the busiest spot for a good shop.
---
I have before as well
---
Yeah good idea, I'll probably do that
---
Psychobuff seems to make my health jump higher than the level my rads are intended to keep it. If I'm at 19% health and the queen comes down, I pop a phsychobuff and wham health is at 35percent and my damage numbers drop.  This didn't always happen, not sure what changed.
---
Flatwoods and Morgantown don’t work just tried.
---
thanks buddy
---
added benefit of not dying to rads while on Psychobuff either
---
this bug has existed in-game since release! it's so broken lmao
---
don't forget a biocommesh chest / chem fiend perk
---
Disciples of the Glow
---
Something like Mr Lemonade would be alright
---
There are some ants spawning in the engeneer rooms this week. Novice and wasting hours upon hours seems to be the only way.
---
I was hoping that was the case. Thanks
---
I see that now. Bethesda moved fast this time. lol
---
I tend to agree. I don't stack any RR on my armor, since it still hurts. I use my PA for nuke zones exclusively.
---
I'm proud to say that at least 100 of them are mine!
---
Will do, ta
---
u/alienfister here's some of that info you were looking for plus the link I use to differentiate between resistances:
---

---
5k maybe 7k if you can mod it to the buyer's liking. I only put it low cause of the weight. I run a store on my guy and stuff is priced to move. 20lbs is a lot of space when i got my own stuff i ineed to keep.
---
I just make them bring the pepper or whatever.
---
With the introduction of being able to "float" foundations so long as one is properly placed, it damn well appears that it's internally broken much worse than before... to wit, you can have a 2x2 section of foundations with only \*1\* that is technically floating, attach a stair and kaboom... every last piece including said stairs is now necessary and you'll have to move your camp to manually scrap and start again.
---
Even worse with certain things like the 1x2 enclosed stair glitch as that can make just about everything floor and foundation in your camp impossible to even rotate... thus I don't even bother trying to make those anymore.
---
Im staying in the online server.personaly mods should stay on FO4
---
I mean its been around for awhile now it seems. Probably why he gat plasmas and be fixers are showing up everywhere. They also gotta fix dupes because itll kill the end game if they dont.
---
Yeah they didn’t work for me either. I think I tried a good 90% of them before finding ones that would
---
Problem with this is.. are there working vehicles in the fallout universe? I think I remember something in fallout 1 or 2, but I'm probably wrong
---
Not to mention disappearing turrets that still count against the turret budget... not stored, not invisible but still there. They are literally not listed in the count (mine says 9/10 built) but when trying to place that last one I get the turret budget error. Good times.
---
It would be funny to see someone sneak in around with a big ol flamethrower. Cant you do something similar to that with the railway rifle or harpoon gun? Is it possible sneak in on the SBQ?
---
Most won't register because you actually need to take a picture close to the small billboard thingy that each Red Rocket has instead of the building itself.
---
Yeah, I've been learning that sorta stuff with the mods and what some of the damage types are. I used to just always pick pneumatic cuz my main is an unarmed fella, but I have biocomm on my junkies guy and dense on my bloodied sniper now. I twinked a character at the purveyor awhile back and I had some sweet three star rolls but it was on like level 5 armor, I've always preferred a low level/resistance piece with amazing legendary effects than a level 50 Heavy piece with okay effects. Seems to me the damage reduction % gear was much better than just high resistances. I have Vanguards and some Bolstering with a mix of Cavalier and Sentinels and he's really tanky, but I wonder if maybe 1 of each "-15% damage from ..." armor with some PR/AP regen and Sentinels and Cavaliers wouldn't be significantly better protection than just a high DR/ER
---
Anyway, thanks for your infoz :)
---
Fury
---
I’m a tadpole and I resent that comment
---
Whoopsie doodle
---
I stopped using psycho on my melee for this exact reason. It does in fact bump your health and mess up your bloodied damage. Then depending on how bloodied I am running I end up getting killed when it wears off. 
---
I have instead switched to using Fury.
---
I had one of each modded types in my vendor, lowered the price down to 500 caps and they still wouldn’t sell, ended up scrapping them as they weigh 32 each, had lots of lookers but no one really wanted them, so the got recycled into .556 ammo which sold almost instantly, go figure
---
Thanks for providing those stats it gave me a clearer picture on how to identify armor types. What graph did u refer to tho? Is there a link? 
---
Yeah, i have the BoS paint. I practically paint all the BoS armors that i get before i pop them into the vending machine. Looks nicer too!
---
Your are right it would be simpler but I don't think they should be as easy to obtain as going into the factory and them being all right there. Plus I like the idea that they would be rare and sought-after.
---
I am absolutely disincentivized to buy CAMP items at this point, and not just because it's become "how can we rehash raiders stuff for the 4th week running".
---
I am at budget limit all the doo dah day! Seriously Bethesday, don't you want my money?
---
Cool ty :)
---
They should make nw where you can bring your character+gear in and just have meds,magazines,+nuke codes in loot boxes
---
My ts gatling plasma will sound off as though it's shooting but doesn't put out 😂
---
I just sneak up on one and stealth kill it with my Furious handmade within 10 seconds while it's flying.
---
This is my go to for sniper build [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f148e9&amp;d=pd2pk2pp2pl2lt2s72ic4sb2c72a00s01an2ar2a71ao0p02lu2l71lv0a30&amp;w=&amp;m=5cf2&amp;nw=aal4pdp6p7a0e0&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f148e9&amp;d=pd2pk2pp2pl2lt2s72ic4sb2c72a00s01an2ar2a71ao0p02lu2l71lv0a30&amp;w=&amp;m=5cf2&amp;nw=aal4pdp6p7a0e0&amp;n=)  
---
The ones that are empty are a fill as needed with what you want. I normally have good doggy and batteries included on in those places again i do swap out sometimes like if I am great on weight I swap in a 3 gunsmith and a 5 demo expert I also have a 3 demo expert again it is flexible and It is not really min/max but it is fun. 
---
I use an AAE25 gauss myself and a EE90 handmade for clean up.
---
Thank you for the thoughtful reply. You definitely give good responses, I'll provide a counter-point with the caveat that you may well be right.
---
1. I agree that many of these things do not touch the casual player. But the casual player does feel the impacts when they go to try to find a good weapon or a good piece of armor.  Those items are rare, but not nearly as rare as the current economy represents.  Many many good items lay unused in stashes.
---
2. Absolutely the single-player character is the largest current "victim" (and the one we want to help the most), hence the suggested move to an account-wide daily cap limit
---
3. While I don't hit the cap limit every day, I do often. Farmable totals aside, it quickly becomes as profitable, and certainly more fun/engaging, to just move to trading as a source of income.
---
4. Certainly fees for world events should be avoided. But for planned, instanced, end-game only content like the raid it could make sense. Worthwhile content for the raid, that's another problem.
---
Regarding items-as-value-stores
---
1. Stash limits are not really that great as a limiter. 800 lbs in the box sure, but another what, 1k lbs on the toon? Times 5 characters? A dedicated trader can hold a LOT of items, and is constantly concentrating it to the best of the best.
---
2. Sure, the items could go to 5\*. They could also get left behind via a gear level increase. These periodic reductions in total economic value are normal in games (like a Light increase in Destiny). The only point is that at least right now as inflation increases, items are increasing in value as well, while relatively  caps are losing value. It's the best value store available at the moment, if impermanent.
---
3. Storing value in items starts by scrounging the servers for underpriced stuff in player vendors and trading up from there. It's almost the only way to get into the top-tier barter-only economy. Gotta have stuff to get stuff, and the loot system for this game means it's faster to grind vendors than grind legendaries for it.
---
I don't know that I have a real project here as I can't really effect change, just hoping to start a conversation and maybe get a Beth rep to read it.
---
I dont think I disconnected once during those glorious times in the BETA where everything was new and wonderful and scary
---
I was saying it would be an abandoned wrecked vehicle, and the Nukatron workers would be the ones that players have to hunt down.
---
Yeah if anything I'm gonna wait it out, I can get my stash space down to 300 because it's a new character. They got some money in them, time will help decide their fate lol
---
Jokes on you when they're selling a god roll for 100 caps
---
&gt; The player stumbles upon a abandoned Nukamobile
---
OP isn't saying it actually drives around.  Just that it is found at random spawn points
---
She says she has no stimpaks...
---
Its does -75% DR for 2 minutes....seems like op boost for SBQ.
---
Can any1 confirm?
---
Thanks. I just hope Bethesda is listening :D
---
I'm using the same stealth commando build with a Furious handmade and I often kill scorchbeast before they are even able to get out of a fissure site.
---
Sneak is not viable for SBQ, sadly. If an enemy detects anything, it cannot reliably be sneak attacked.
---
I am not sure what the sound index is for the harpoon or railway. You can sneak attack with almost anything. You just get detected immediately if it is something like a gatling gun.
---
That is fine, but there are synergies by using the right combination of perks.  It is really not that big of a deal since you can move stuff around later and tweak your build.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f445fa&amp;d=pd2pk2pp2pl2p01sa2c72ic4a72ar2lt2lk1a42an2l71p60e00eh2lu2ao0a51&amp;w=&amp;m=51c49f3d&amp;nw=&amp;n= 
---
Personally this is what I would run , if you have starched jeans and class freak , and if your a sniper sneak build you plan to not get hit ever so you focus on dmg not dmg resistance. Aqua boy and the fire res is good because scorched beast attacks deal little to no damage and car explosions deal no damage and aqua boy is very handy , never go below max per and agi as a pure sneak rifle build and you can go to the bottom of the page for for the mutations you should have , don’t worry about what it says you have class freak.
---
Understood, thank you.
---
And yeah, mutations... I avoided them for a long time.  Just a choice.  But now that i am playing significantly more... I see the benefit.
---
Never run healing factor without class freak please , just please
---
Looks more like you drank the 5th and plead the 2nd...
---
The ability to plant pumpkins would break the Trick or Treat quest, as there would be no need to harvest pumpkins from nearby the rift. I'm fine with just killing a Scorchbeast every time I want pumpkin grenades, personally.
---
Ty for sharing!
---
Wow this is such a fucking simple solution that would literally make everyone happy and not divide the community further. It’s a literal setting you can just switch instead of a full on server.
---
I hope Bethesda actually sees and considers this.
---
Nah it's all good my guy
---
yeah, the drill does that for some reason. Teleports you back to where you jumped onto it from.
---
The Vault Tec Globe also does it on a smaller scale for some reason.
---
"You hear about the Vault Dwellers that purposely launch nukes to kill some big ass flying beast?"
---
I've placed about 6 but I don't have more room in my budget.
---
Jesus is this for real? Are you the kind of person who go's back to wal mart to find your jeans you've been wearing for a year, are now 4 dollars cheaper and are so how so fucking entitled you think you were cheated? Did i read this today?
---
Harpoon is very quiet; i don’t know what the technical setting is, but playing the game you can het without necessarily breaking stealth.
---
Gladiator full? So instead of a quicker fire second weapon, you go with a 1h?
---
Because the game wouldn't be any fun if we could all get everything with minimal effort? I have not. But I'll keep trying to score that payday.
---
Based on dps, all base forms of pistols would still be worse than rifles if they were given x4 damage.
---
Here's an example
---
lv 50 Auto Railway- 84 Damage per shot, 750 shots per minute, 1050 DPS
---
lv 45 Prime Auto 10mm- 35 Damage per shot, 430 shots per minute,  250 DPS
---
lv 50 Single Action Revolver-62 Damage per shot, 60 shots per minute, 62 DPS
---
Anytime!
---
It's happened to a few people now and I think there may be video evidence of it happening. I went into it once... Once. The hordes of enemies were fun but I didn't like the blind timed Easter egg hunt.
---
Also, every random person I run into who mentions it says to stay away.
---
 Project paradise is fun but still buggy.
---
u/GrimSpark here is that graph for ya too :)
---
But what if 5.56 is also the main ammo type that I use? I'm literally killing things with caps then.
---
This is like being annoyed that people paid less for the 6 month old game you paid full price for at launch
---
I bought one for 999 the other day and 1500 a few days later. I figure it makes up for the two I lost to server disconnect trying to transfer them to my melee guy. Usually they're around 8k or more
---
Fires extra round giving it potentially +100% dmg, but -50% accuracy and +100% recoil.
---
Wasn't sure if I could get some chameleon armor or something. Thanks for the suggestion, I will look into it.
---
Anything listed as quiet lets you use Mister Sandman bonuses. Typically you use a silencer to achieve this, but the crossbow is automatically set to quiet. Maybe the harpoon gun is quiet too?
---
More Tires and Chains!!! j/k... I want a Scorched bundle, they're my favorite faction &lt;3
---
I would agree if this game was built as a pvp game from the ground up.  I think people don't really want balanced or fair pvp though.  The type of "pvpers" this game attracts just want to come up with the most broken possible setup and then club seals with their broken op setup.  
---
Pvp'ers looking for interesting challenges and an actual metagame just look to games that offer those things.  
---
All that said I'd love to see some modes where the rules can change dynamically for PvP, I just don't see it from a company that clearly isn't really serious about this type of game mode despite NW being a moderate success.
---
I don’t play much. I’m at level 34. I’ve been waiting for the 50% to use some of the scrip I saved up (200 or so), should I just wait till I get to lvl50 or nawww?
---
I gave up looking for it not worth dealing with glitchy ghouls and loading screen freezing on Fort Defiance
---
Hey can u just tell me the exact name of the outfit and hat rly quick?
---
This is correct.
---
I have actually seen a camp somewhere near a cave that if you sit in a chair, and get back off, you fall through the map...
---
Unto his vendor section, and his house and crafting tables are there. There are stairs back up from the underworld, and if you are old like me, you do it again.
---
Found Blue one day and then Brown the next, hoping my next visit will be Red!!
---
How much are the nuka signs?
---
I don't think that's what op meant.  MOBA games and other more serious pvp games have seasons where stuff gets buffed and nerfed, so the "best" build isn't a set in stone thing.    
---
In games like those, buffs and nerfs go hand in hand.  
---
But ultimately fo76 isn't that type of game, or at least it's not today.  NW could be like that if they actually had an experienced team making decisions for that game mode.
---
Sanctuary?? FO4
---
yep, judging from the replies here I think you nailed it.
---
Ah well, c'est la vie.  I still enjoy the game :)
---
I have found 2 reds total, the only one I have never found is the yellow I have had 28 blue/green/brown, server hop if you have time to kill but really just do a quick check and move on I spent like 3 weeks gathering rare clothes and it burned me out.
---
I would get rid of luck of the draw and replace with class freak. Get the negatives of any mutations you're running down.
---
I paid 25k for my Ford Fusion when I bought it. 
---
I found the same make and model and year on craigslist for 10k
---
Should I call Ford and bitch and complain that my 5 year old car is 15k cheaper now?
---
It's hard for sure!
---
You mean a thing that goes on your face hides hair that grows on your face?
---
The fuck outta here! That's insane!
---
I mean they usually do give refunds like when I bought the red rocket bundle I was like ehhhh this kinda sucks and they refunded me and let me keep it
---
You are in the top 10 for the worst kind of human.
---
I’ve already got but I’ll swan dive off a cliff for ya. PSN: Mad_Dawg_Woody.
---
Lol could be pink. I found pink today.
---
Added both. Love the Gt’s, I couldn’t stop laughing at the second one. And no problem about talking, I just feel lonely in the wasteland when I’m stoned lmao
---
Do you know all 3 spawn points for them in the asylum?
---
If it’s just for scrip 25c per scrip
---
It only covers the top half of your face. Beard hair usually occupies the lower regions of the face.
---
I was actually thinking about that one. Only reason I had luck of the draw because it seemed to proc a lot
---
Personal experience, their customer service has been top notch.
---
Wasn't it all 4 for $18 when it originally came out?
---
I never buy anything over 500 caps. If there's a 1* under 200 caps, I'll pick it up. I only buy weapons.
---
There's an ocean of pvp oriented games that have like 0 consequences for death that are ultra popular.  Every FPS in existence, moba's, shit even a lot of mmo's like guild wars2 have good pvp without heavy death penalties.  
---
Plus adding huge death penalties in a game where you can rock a full set of ass/sent or cavs plus permanent invisibility via stealth boys + secret agent while using legacy weapons that don't even drop any more while stacking super stimpacks and nuka quantums...   
---
I'm not even scratching the surface here but end game pvp in this game there is such massive differences in power between players who know what they are doing and have all the gear they need and those that don't.  
---
In any case though, I concede its a lost cause as I don't thing Bethesda is serious about PvP and the players here clearly don't want what I'm advocating so I'll just move along :P
---
I peaked at co\_mod\_RailwayRifle\_Scope\_ScopeShort\_NV \[COBJ:001C405F\] and it appears configured correctly, I'd guess a crash, but if you purchase it again and learn it holler if it doesn't stick
---
They actually are pretty good about refunding atom shop purchases... but I guess you’d rather just complain here. Cool story.
---
Not sure... maybe they get xp from it?? I’ve seen piles also, just not sure what the deal is
---
3rd floor there's 2 rooms an found mostly hats downstairs in laundry room. I just found a dirty white one in lucky hole mine lol.

My personal bloodied build
---
Yay!
---
i do about 125 per star, unless it's some kind of good 3 star roll, then i price check it and sell for more. most things don't go over 500c. they sell at a good clip at this price for me down near watoga.
---
Same for me I’ve requested 2 refunds so far and they’ve helped me fairly fast too.
---
Get rid of gunsmith. I can’t think of a reason to have that active.
---
Try the switch to class freak then decide if having the negative effect of your mutations reduced is more useful in general than luck of the draw.
---
Haven’t played in several months. All these items are new.
---
You mean: just re-skin the firetrucks 🤔
---
...is completely immune to player attacks.
---
Its like that everywhere. You pay full price when its new and shiny. Then they put them on sale so all the peeps on the fence will buy it. I miss roaming the wastelands in my blackbird PA. Broke my heart when they relisted it.
---
its not full.. only 1pt in each for 30% total.. I rarely use melee its just a backup 
---
I carry a .50 instigating hunting rifle for long range sniping
---
I currently have a Furious lever action and a mutants handmade for general use at medium to close range.. eventually Id like to get a furious handmade too
---
Im using the black diamond for melee until I can get a good meat hook.. then im switching the 3 gladiator points over to iron fist
---
I also carry a mutants combat shotgun but Im not speced into it at all.. I use it mostly in low level areas to conserve other ammo.. eventually Id like to find a executioners version..
---
melee and shotguns generally do pretty high damage before perk cards and they arent weapons I use very often.. certainly not against formidable mobs.. 
---
I felt it was better to go heavy on the rifle/vats/crit perks than spread myself too thin.. that said.. I decided to pump SoMe points into melee for 2 reasons.. 
---
1. I use melee more than the shotgun
---
2. I wanted the points in STR for carry weight and melee damage
---
right now im considering moving some points or dropping some cards to add in scattershot and Enforcer shotgun cards
---
You know what sucks? Being almost done with your build and having that message pop up just because you made a ladder so you could put lettering on
---
It's not going to kill the game off. I don't understand why people write things like this. Servers have a 24 player cap. If 95% of players move to a private server, the public server experience will still feel just as populated because the processes Bethesda uses to assign you a server at login will place you with other concurrent players, be they 23 to fill your server or 1,000,000 to fill thousands of server. 
---
Basically, your experience as a pub player would be fundamentally unchanged.
---
Modding is also an amazing tool that always gives the Fallout games a much healthier community. Modders can fix many, many of the bugs in this game, they can let players find the gameplay balance they want, and they can prolong the life of the game for a very long time. It's a super win for players and Bethesda because then the devs don't have to focus as much on QOL and fixes and can put their resources into content expansions and new rewards.
---
Even if my go to weapon is a handmade rifle?
---
They never said that. They said “sooner than you think”
---
It reduces your guns degradation rate, sorta useful for a gun build (imo)
---
Unless your firing explosives or commando breaking weapons isn’t that big of a deal. Just equip weapon artisan when repairing to get to 200% repair and swap back out after.
---
If I could just attach those rectangular wood parts, to ANYTHING!
---
180 Atoms,they are on sale

Got it ty. Will check it out

It already is. Three serums a day hits my daily vendor cap.

That happened to ONE person on PC doing a very specific thing that has been near impossible to replicate. You are safe lol.

I think it would make sense as another way to add variety to legendary enemies.

I like vault raids... :(

Riddle me this, how are taxes in a game with no government lore friendly?
---
Oh I just retried and you need to take the photo at the sign
---
FYI if you hve a camp terminal it tells you where tourist is so you don’t need to served hop.
---
There are two certainties in the wasteland. Death and Tax-Collector Bot.
---
There's already a boundary for how big the base can be. Other games with base building don't have these limitations.

I’m followed by dead Scorchbeasts
---
How do you get the handmade plans?
---
Hey, I'd pay Insult Bot to leave me alone.  Prize Bot too.
---
I have a question. I know Google would be faster to find out but sometimes you just wanna ask a person, you know?
---
My friend and I are only able to find quantum, cherry and plain. How do you get the other flavors? I think he wants them for his display or something.
---
Only had that once. Scared the piss outta me when it fell out of the sky lol
---
When you do go outside, go visit a therapist.
---
Might rethink being a dbag raider.
---
you can get Wild from some events but i forget which ones. you can get all flavors from the sorority (blue door) on fraternity row.
---
an additional grape can be found in TNT Dome 7.
---
you can purchase them all for a premium from Bubbles at the White Spring resort.
---
Nuka Dark’s recipe can be obtained from Biv daily events.
---
They cap at different amounts, so if you leave them for longer than 5minutes it might make a difference. The largest one caps at a 5 before it stops producing, so it will keep producing if you remove the water from it. It's one of those things where it maxes out quickly and you have to keep grabbing it.
---
Source?
---
Out of curiosity, what are the supplies needed for marsupial? I'd like to start selling them and I notice that marsupial seems to be the most popular.
---
Sorry for the late reaponse, but I have a quick question. Do Scaly Skin and Grounded work in Power Armor? I tried to find this out a while back, but couldn't come up with anything definitive.
---
I don’t cheat and never struggle to get what I want. Just play the game. Work the economy to your favor and profit.
---
HillbillyDLUX08 is my PSN. If you still need help I'll be on in a few minutes.
---
per star really doesn't make sense considering 1\*=5 2\*15 and 3\* 40.
---
If its scrip no more than 500, most people do between 50-450
---
I run it on 2 chars w/o ....
---
You can set different profile pictures for each character, should make it easier to delete the one you want with certainty.
---
it's what I've found people will pay for non in demand legendaries. anytime I've tried to tweak the formula, sales stagnate so...
---
I've played the game since beta. Everyone's experience is different. Your comment is pointless. I play every day and have watched this trend increase. You can't work what isn't for sale..lol what a stupid remark.
---
Level 280 and I only just finally unlocked polished for most, perhaps all metal and robot peices.  Definitely hard to get.
---
Caps are worthless, you’re absolutely right. I still have a hard time getting drops and good legendary pieces from Murghwhatever her name is...
---
Things spawn buy what lvl is around it sadly. So if a 50 plus is around they will spawn high i team with wife (110me 25 her) stuff spawns at my lvl because im the highest.
---
Take psychotats intead.  Same damage buff and damage resist instead of a health buff.
---
Well I usually only get one lone scorched every so often that I snipe, but I probably didn't notice they've been whittling down the health of the windmill all this time.  So I guess I could have just repaired it instead of rebuilding that area, next time I'll know.
---
Yeah, the Highwayman in Fallout 2.
---
I would put no more than one in adrenaline, there are lots of better perks in agility.  Have they ever fixed tenderizer? I would rone Lone Wanderer unless in a team.run
---
I killed a Scorched and a SBQ so I just needed to kill one more. A Scorched Wendigo or a Scorched Megasloth. Killed both a bunch of times but it didn’t register in the challenges so I gave up.
---
Chems psychobuff or fury. If you use alcohol, nuka dark or whiskey for melee. They increase your strength by 6 its goves the added carry weight
---
Thank you brother, someone who talks sense and sees the real and bigger picture.
---
You are definitely right.
---
stay in the west.. explore all the places and do events there..
---
its tough if youre going too far east too early
---
game gets way easier when you got some levels on your toon and better gear/perks
---
20s-40s is the hardest part
---
It says I'm missing the camera and the camp terminal do you mean the personal terminal if so what's it under
---
Seriously though:
---
Make serums unsalable at vendor-bots. 
---
Remove cap limit.
---
Make cap amount shared by all characters.
---
Remove taxes.
---
Armor and weapons are status symbols in the wasteland. The inflation has happened as more high end players have gain access to serums. When you can by serums for 200 and sell them to vendor bots for 500. It’s a matter of time before caps lose value. Plug that hole and their value will go up.
---
A dead beaver suddenly appeared in my living room last night, I felt both bad, and had hoped it'd count towards that one challenge - it didn't.  I don't want to kill them or a brahmin, so I am crossing my fingers that after a while each will get killed by a grenade in a big fight so I can chalk it up to being collateral damage.  Until that happens to a cat, then I'll want to stop playing for a week :(
---
Appreciated brother. This is based on facts not sour grapes or lack of gameplay.
---
If you're on PC and need a hand, let me know. 
---
The Brotherhood of Steel - Hellfire Chapter is always looking for new recruits. 
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/SbFabp1
---
I think they should start by adding better legendaires to the game that way you want need to fork over 4 accounts worth of caps in the the first place. Then when good guns become available to the whole community they start adding more cool and unique plans and apparel to the game ( not the atom shop)
---
I guess what worries me is it says type the characters name and since I have 2 characters with that name I'm worried that it will delete both when I only wanna delete the one
---
iirc enemies in the forest region don’t level with you and stay consistently low , I think they also made it that enemies in the Ash heap , toxic valley and Savage divide also don’t spawn with a level above 
---
35 or something.
---
Bethesda can't fix the economy. If they make caps easier to obtain, the OP endgame gear just raises in value. We set the market and high end vendors will always pull ahead. Thats the way it needs to be. If everyone had a be gatling plasma then the game would suck. For some of us, high end trading is all we have left to do in the game.
---
I've spent the past few weeks trying to get one item. I'm offer 4k away from max caps and I cant even get a nibble.
---
If you dont have trade items, you aren't getting what you want.
---
Same thing happened to me
---
Yep, I'm a big fan of paying for what you get but that's again where multiple accounts holding max caps have an advantage and it would force players to join those ranks if they wanted to compete...the facts are it's a bun fight when a decent weapon gets put on trade..its the lack of items that concerns me..so I agree with some of what you are saying, thank you
---
No you crying is pointless because you don’t know how to play the game
---
I had NO idea about that. My flamer build can get a lot of mileage out of this info, thanks!
---
It doesn't have to be answered with high end game weapons but more variety for sure..its not purely an economy fix but an economy improvement. If I go to a store in everyday life and it ain't got what I want, I want options..right now player vending doesn't give that..I'm sure you have noticed, its 80-90% the same shit in most machines..
---
Nah, I've had multiple characters share a name before now, and it's always deleted the one I wanted.
---
If you know which is which, it should still be ok.
---
I have five in adrenaline? As far as I know people say tenderize is fixed
---
Fisherman Overalls and Fisherman Hat, or something like that. I got the outfit and hat from a house on the farm that spawns the Sheepsquatch event up in the Toxic Valley.
---
Stimpaks are everywhere. She's fine.
---
Try replacing them both with the door variant. They are usually more forgiving!
---
I like the straightforwardness of these arguments, but if serums are the problem, resale is probably not the issue.  If you spend 200 to make 500, your profit is only 300. Over the course of your 7000 caps, you don't actually end up as much, \~4200 caps.
---
Primary crafting and sales though, that might be a problem. I don't know, I avoid crafting whenever possible.  If someone has information on that, maybe they could share?
---
Yes this comment is spot on, I want to see a variety of  options that benefit the player with how they spend caps and for now..caps buy bulk resource, meds, serums, recipes and plans..if you are lucky you might snag a rare bargain in a machine but most times its wastes fast travel.
---
Yes. So much. I wish we could have a tab for used items in our build and delete them from there. I have no idea how much of my building budget is wasted by these items that just simply disappeared as soon as I placed them in my camp.
---
In the last test I did wait for another 5 mins. So after 10 minutes I had 12 purified waters, again split across my purifiers. So I think it's impossible to get more than 6 made every 5 minute interval.
---
I understand the storage capacity is different and that will let you store more and therefore empty them less often, which is definitely more practical.
---
One ultracite, three fiberglass, five oil, and one pure crimson flux. It is very popular.
---
I'm glad there are people that like it but even if they fix the inventory loss thing, I would have to spend all my game time grinding it to make it rewarding and I don't want to.
---
I think that would the only difference, the time you get to explore between them maxing out.
---
I liked them and bought every single raider item, I am interested in enclave themed stuff though.
---
Personally the only thing I use caps for is fast travel and taking over workshops. At a certain point, you aren't going to find anything in player vendors worth your time. Or at least itll be a rare occasion.
---
Raiders Rule
---
This would require actual builds and a need to actually  realyl roleplay to make vending affective. Also vendors that sell something worth while.
---
I get the feeling the camp budget is taxing on the server when you keep in mind everyone’ having a camp. Idk, but just a feeling.
---
So you're RNG isn't random?
---
Xbox, but I appreciate the assist regardless.
---
Yes. I have a tower base and made some temporary floors to stand on when adding some lights. I had a perfectly square top floor with an extra piece sticking out of it for months waiting for them to fix the problem. 
---
If we can have multiple story towers supported by only 1 staircase then why cant we just build whatever we want? The restrictions are totally unnecessary.
---
Whatever happens to PVP I just hope it doesn't include people who don't want to PVP
---
I'm close to that. Around 17.
---
I either hit things that are way too easy or way too hard. Haven't found a balance yet
---
&lt;stops doing Biv’s daily for it&gt;
---
Well shit.
---
One of which, I'll add, regularly face tanks the ISS without a vamp weapon
---
Furious FFR Auto Gamma, +33% VATS, weighs 0.6 
---
135 ballistic, 125 rads
---
Hot-key backup, can't consume meds fast enough to counter, solves most "persistant" problems 😀
---
once you know the run by heart it takes 10, maybe 15 minutes tops and is very straightforward and easy.  IT's only a time/resource drain if you don't know what you are doing.
---
You need to find the tourist, phillippi cemetery is the most common spawn I have seen followed by the giant teapot. Tourists name is Ansel or Anne depending.
---
Can confirm if you do Bivs enough you will get learn both the drink recipe AND get drops of ballistic bock
---
Bucket List is started by finding one of the Tourist corpses. There are multiple possible spawn points which you can see along with a suggested route [in this thread](https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cdp9zo/tourist_trap_map_find_the_tourist_every_time_with/).
---
"Some people say there's a curse. Some people say if you use power armour too much your skin, flesh and bone stretches you out like a wendigo"
---
I sent you a friend invite. Thanks.
---
FYI: VATS stands for Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System and it’s just another Pipboy app like the health and inventory management apps. It would be known to tech savvy folks in-world.
---
Along with what other have said.... Make some friends. Hell just follow people and stay with them. I get tag alongs and i think it's great! Once i know what they are doing I'll guide them around WS letting them get as many tags as they can.
---
Pre lvl 35 is the rough part of the game where you're limited by zones. Make sure you join events and jump to kill the queen or imposter.
---
Team work is dream work and thier is a whole skill tree for it.
---
 So my level 11 has no business with a place in the Mire? 
---
 I kid, the Nukashine put him near where one of my chars has a place so he built one too. The level 28 Scorched are just possible but that's as low as it gets there.
---
Under automated alerts. The "suspicious person"
---
an NPC that takes you to the atomic shop and lore about how he put up those cardboard signs up and everyone lashing out at him for doing so
---
Love the public event changes
---
They could make the 2nd legendary prefix 15k caps and 3rd star 10k caps. Sell it as a mod. Increase the daily cap from 1400 to 2000. I don't have the best gear in the game but I either got it from a drop or from a player vendor. Bought a 2* unyielding marine leg with ap regen and another marine leg +1 str for 2500 and 3k caps each. Found a player to mod it tempered for me and bam I have decent legs. Bought a bloodied dcg 3* with FSS and 90% reduced weight for 6500 caps couple months back. It's possible to get decent gear still imo just gotta look for it.
---
That is totally a responders thing to say.
---
I didn’t know mega sloths were territorial.
---
I'm more upset that they won't let me put a beard on my female character.
---
I lock my nuclear generators and junk extractor. But that’s mainly for theft and mobs.
---
 Luck of the Draw is ... whatever, but Bloody Mess is essential. I don't run Class Freak as I only have 5 Luck.
---
It's more for keeping track of your time played.
---
I doubt they seriously expect anybody to finish that.
---
I have played since Beta and have around 1500 hours tops. I know some have more and I am sure there are players who will reach that but it's not really meant for everybody.
---
Yes it should at a minimum pay out 7600. That's an insane investment. I've played the game since launch and probably don't even have 200 clocked.
---
I laughed out loud. May have scared my dog in the process . So while you do owe her an apology, take my damn upvote in the meantime! 😂
---
I thought after the update the free C.A.M.P. terminal would start the quest for you?
---
Personal terminal. Under automated alerts I think it’s called. It’s about a suspicious person.

Dang I didnt know that

Would have been nice to get a 760 or 2076 marker for some atoms or a nice cosmetic.
---
Nope, not that I noticed on either of my new characters nor do I remember seeing it in patch notes.

That’s what I was trying to figure out. Thanks for the locations though, as I guess I’ll be doing it the old fashioned way!
---
Tell Dog Meat I am terribly sorry.
---
RadShield and whisky also
---
Yes, I check the map from time to time for anyone near a workshop. I then spam open and close the map to get a sense for which direction they are going. If going to, I come in. If going away, I ignore.
---
I found the note you were talking about. Thank you for informing me!
---
You had to go inside. I tried everywhere outside and then my daughters like "let's try inside".
---
Awesome! Thank you for the quick reply!
---
np, glad to help. the sodas in the sorority are in the bedroom with the cool Nuka lamp. if they’re not there just server hop till the ones u want populate. the assortment is random but u can get most of them in one shot!
---
Step 1. Make caps harder to gain. Remove drops from mobs
---
Step 2. Make ammo and med purchases more reasonable
---
Step 3. Is continued cap sinks.
---
I love biv and is awsome and powerful boozes... Add a last step to this to pay to use his fermenter to finish off a batch of red ant lager. Take the op stuff out of wait Times and move it to 100c to finish 6 red ant laugers.
---
Of course you can play with the numbers but idea stands. Apply it to many things like modding legendary... Or any gun. A col gutsy has all mods available for the right amout of caps
---
The free fast travel is the worst thing they could do. It's already a non issue but why leave more caps in the game?
---
That's not as bad as I thought it'd be! I'll farm some crimson over my next few play sessions and get back to you. :)
---
Then I guess I didn’t really try everything, lol. Thanks for letting me know.
---
Possibly dropped by accident and forgot to pick up, I've experienced some bugs but not "inaccessible stash".
---
Have you bulked your junk? If not, I recommend doing so.
---
Just keep playing and getting better gear and perks. A couple of weeks ago I was really furious about sbs and it took a lot of effort to kill one. As soon as you have your build sorted it will take seconds to kill it even in the air
---
If you are running on low health (judging from the use of Nerd Rage and Serendipity), it may be worth using Dodgy, as it absorbs more damage in practice than Evasive. The disadvantage is that every hit taken costs 30 AP, which is less of an issue with unyielding armor. Blocker (strength perk) is also useful to reduce damage taken from melee attacks.
---
I've heard its pretty bad on the user's end as well.
---
I have bulked some but I should really make that more of a priority
---
Idk about you but I land alot of sneak attacks on her. You just need that card or perk that allows you to go stealth when you crouch and then you can just tbag until your hidden
---
Y'all need math lessons. And Jesus. But mostly math lessons.
---
I dont think I dropped them because I can still craft and build with them 🤷‍♂️
---
Ghouls and Scorched would routinely enter unassisted, and ignorant visitors never bothered to close the door when they departed. 
---
The NPCs are NOT glitching through windows either, I've actually watched them enter by the door. 
---
Zero entries (that I'm aware of) after I locked it, and there's a balcony walkway that anyone can access without needing the Marsupial ability.
---
My CAMP, my rules.
---
Current caps limit is 30k caps
---
Smart players learn plans and scrap armor/weapons then upgrade wisely chosen lefendary's.
---
Keep the best stuff for themselves then sell the leftovers. These modded items sell very well in vendor machines.
---
Stash space used by modded upgraded weapons/armor for sale is better than display cases filled with items like stuffed fuzzy nuts gnome's.
---
I don't seem to have this problem. To be honest I get intimidated by certain emblems, and mine is the laser pistol. Considering i don't often get bothered maybe try to use that as deterrent yourself? Also fortify. You can create death chambers and fortresses that force attackers into bad situations, punji board a hallway and force them through it for surprising damage by the time they reach you they're hurting bad
---
What amount do you buy them for? I've been trying to figure out pricing for the different nuka-colas and dog food in my vendor.
---
YES! oh man, I've had to scrap and redo so many bases because I made a mistake and had to restart building! Don't worry I we still love you Teddy Bear Howard
---
Real tough luck, I couldn't believe it when I saw the notification pop up... Damn!
---
I scrapped 3 of them 🙄
---
There needs to be a cap sink to make them valuable again.
---
I love that so much. Is it alright if I steal that and make a post? Lol
---
I generally make a rule not to buy for more than 20 for a quantum, 10 for a cherry and 5 or 6 for a regular. Most people sell around there anyway. Dog food i sell for 3 each because they dont benefit me and i like to share the love
---
Almost sounds like inventory at a claimed workshop, they  give extra materials that don't show in your stash... Good luck
---
just for laughs take off you OC and then try
---
The Nuka World dlc for fo4 featured nuka recipes along with a nuka cola crafting bench.
---
Based on all that, it would make perfect sense to have all that same stuff in fo76 given there's a Nuka cola bottling plant in the game.    
---
Though adding an NPC similar to Biv would be sweet, maybe with wastelanders an NPC could be added who turns out to be one of Sierra Petrovita's ancestors :)
---
It was 1200 I think
---
Thanks for posting!
---
So basically what you do is take the playerbase offline and cater to the cheaters who cant handle playing the game with the resources the developer created. 
---
If the only way you can enjoy a game is by modding the shit out of it to cheat, do things you shouldnt be able to do, and create your own gear, then have at it. 
---
I didnt realize the fallout playerbase was this full of cheaters.  Maybe its time to find another universe to call home. 
---
But then, this is just my opinion.  Mod all you want to.  It just makes me have a lower opinion of this player base. 
---
Cheat away.
---
I’m betting Wastelanders will be a separate server for lvl 50+ players.
---
I don't think it's likely to happen (I've only heard of a few) but for me it's not worth the risk anyway. I'll never grind it enough to get the armor set.
---
100% agree.
---
Modding = controlled cheating.
---
If you have to cheat to enjoy a game, then maybe you need to find a different game.
---
Got what he deserved. https://i.imgur.com/lpmtRS9.jpg
---
Cool, white picket fences on sale, some affordable wallpaper (waiting for the others to go on sale).
---
Hell yeah! We are stoner wastelanders as well. You play at night? I play randomly. My husband plays with me usually after 7pm pacific.
---
That's a good point. I normally go for 2\* ranged but might change for 50% off.
---
Possibly. Thank you!
---
And your gamertag is absolutely hilarious. Reminds me of Rickey cricket from always sunny
---
It was an excellent time. I see someone downvoted me. I’m just stating facts. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Okay, added you. PSN is Agent\_\_l0lz
---
I wish! that mission never spawns for me
---
Launch player as well, and I'm only at around 450 hours. 7600 is maddening, that'd be every hour of every day for a year at least. Forgive me for being bad at math and not doing it here lol
---
That just means you need to have stairs leading to upper floors at all times.  Just toss a temporary set of stairs on the outside somewhere  near where you want to delete stuff while you are working and it should register everything as accessible and let you delete stuff.
---
It would be quite the easter egg if they released a pumpkin head helmet and it let you breath underwater.... wait...
---
Not only is this good research, but you have made it very clear and even colour coded it! 
---
Very nice work, thank you!
---
I’m pretty sure it’s poison, idk how to combat it though
---
Only when you disrupt their naptime.
---
I don’t think so
---
Someone should mention operation Tourniquet, that was a pretty cool idea, it should be some kind of secret boss encounter.
---
I'd also love to see a mistress of mystery return and show us how to make a mysterious trench coat and fedora.
---
Agree in what you are saying offered 50k for an explosive Gatling laser last night and was told i was low balling. Honestly come on.. for me caps can be made if i literally save all legendary drops/flux/ammo/meds for two weeks then i can make about 50k but it requires a serious amount of grinding and after to be told im a low baller and others saying the same really pisses me off.
---
I honestly think it's a gag on the part of Beth devs.
---
Adding you. PSN ign is Agent\_\_l0lz
---
People downvote anything these days
---
It does feel like they made the challenges before they played the game. Half of them I looked at and was just like "that's never gonna happen"
---
My personal scrip value is at 50caps per star they sell like hotcakes especially if you have a dozen or so legendaries just sitting in your stash.
---
Yes, the same issue with Mothman billboard for a long time, and others
---
Have you played Mighty Bomb Jack?
---
What is actually worth buying in the shop? Say $20 is tops I’m willing to pay.
---
I honestly really question if the devs (or let's be honest, management) have ever played a PC/console game. Every last thing about this game screams engagement time and monetization...
---
I've been playing PC games about as long as you (very early 80s Apple \]\[) and haven't felt quite so progress gated as this game. Maybe the most recent expansion for WoW, but I stopped playing a year ago due to how awfully tedious it's gotten.
---
I always buy out any dog food I see for 10 caps or under... saves me having to do the rounds of hoboing it up in the Whitespring mall...
---
Was the steel and wood just recently acquired? I saw a post about an hour ago saying almost the same deal, player lost both steel and wood, like a lot of it.
---
I can believe it.  The sound effect is loud and clanky, but the mobs don’t seem to detect it immediately.  I am very fond of the harpoon, it is surprisingly viable for such a weird wasteland weapon.
---
Just went to 4 of the listed stations (Grafton, Morgantown, Flatwoods, Berkeley Springs) on PC, none of them worked on the first/second/third attempts. On the fourth time, basically taking the same exact angle picture on a fourth server, two of them finally registered.
---
It's finicky no matter what platform you're on. Basically have to be standing in just the right spot with specific things visible (gas sign/gas prices) for it to work, and even then, might be an issue with current server you're on so people also recommend to disconnect and reconnect to a new server. Such a mess.
---
Aligned mods for grip and barrel, quick magazine, quick automatic receiver, dot sight. It's so light that you can fire indefinitely. Add one of those perks which improve action points recuperation and its free.
---
imagine an event where you have to repair and clean the whitesprings while the robots go haywire and attack you
---
Never carry any junk whatsoever taking a workshop... like never unless you’re totally ok with losing it. 
---
Since there’s really no PvP except workshops and those trying to annoy others by instigating PvP, yes, this is really what they do, wait, watch the map, kill, then usually block and leave world... 
---
That’s today’s state of the game since survival mode ended...
---
Just do the daily events for possum badges. Dolly Sods and Campfire Tails.
---
It’s only there as a means for tracking hours. You aren’t actually supposed to try and grind this lol
---
I hate when they pee on you
---
Alas.
---
Yup! I bought mine and very first thing I see is exceeds budget... even the small one...lol
---
Get this, I set the install directory outside of the Bethesda launcher folder which it needs to work properly all I did was move it into that folder and boom my loading screens are 1/30th as slow and I haven't been disconnected once. I can't wait for wastelanders cause I'm having a blast. Hate the level system tho
---
after having 3 stuck stairs in my base.. i scrapped the lot and haven't played in a few months :(
---
 I think it's interesting they are vaulting 3 icons that are going to be relevant soon.
---
Tedious indeed.  And anything involving an obstacle course is impossible for me.  My son has earned a few doughnuts helping me out there ;]
---
I agree some ideas to make caps great again:
---
* Bulk ammo - allow players to craft and sell bulk ammo and have the ammo dispensers at train stations stock these for less than 1 cap per bullet.
---
* Allow players to craft and sell MODS - just as you find those boxes out in the world with random mods, players could craft mods like "dense torso mod" etc and sell them via player vending.
---
   * This would also let players who learn super hard mods like radium rifle mods monetize their knowledge better.
---
* Some sort of mechanic where you can just pay caps to repair items up to 200%.
---
I’d agree but fishing in ESO (another Bethesda venture) starts to turn into a total RNG game when it gives you a list of fish you need to catch...
---
Base Priceline I've seen on dogfood is 10 caps per. I sell them all the time for that in my vendors, and I've literally never seen them priced higher. Lower once, or twice, but it seems to be the going rate.
---
Anytime! Just let me know. I'm glad to help.
---
People can prefer private servers even without mods, so they only have to share the world with whoever they invite, and the world can be persistent. Workshops actually become useful. However, if private servers require paying a monthly subscription fee, chances are not enough players would use them to risk killing the game.
---
You don’t see a suspicious person?
---
Your best bet is to hitch a ride with a high level, tag stuff for XP and level up fast. There’s a lot to explore and find on the map, but it’s a slog at low levels. Just kind of focus on a build as you go and after level 45 or so you should be able to handle yourself reasonably well. 
---
I’m on Xbox too and I never mind having people tag along. Feel free to PM me your GT and I’ll help you out. I’ll probably be on a lot over the next couple days.
---
And operation tidy. “Can you say toxic mutagenic waste?”
---
Fixed it
---
It should be under automated alerts. There is a suspicious person to investigate or something like that
---
The personal terminal tells you where they are.
---
Easy fix to get these hours up.
---
When you log out for the night.  Dont log out. 
---
Go to your cooking station, and pretend you are about to craft.
---
Walk away
---
The game will not Idle you out.
---
I use this trick when I have to run to the gas station, or take a poo.
---
Im cool with that. I like rng in games otherwise they become predictable
---
So many are looking for it and server hopping that it’s hard to find any right now and vending machines are filled with asylum wear... 
---
I see players running in all the time now...lol
---
I've been doing them because there's nothing left to do. I have 6 possum badges left.
---
this.  the other low hanging fruit is free up 1 point somewhere to get radicool.  If you are going to be bloodied, might as well get the extra carry weight and bonus melee damage never hurts if your weapon breaks or similar.
---
There could stand to be a few more cap-sinks.  Like having to pay to restart Encryptid is cool. More things like that to invest caps but still a chance to get and do something fun, other than just more recipes. 
---
But to counter your overall point, everything I've purchased from other players was with Caps. I think I did one trade ever, but all armor and like 20 guns were bought with Caps. It's possible to build an arsenal with Caps. It still has value. Not as much as we would like compared to our cap limit, but theres still value. 4 or 5k gets a decent rifle still, for my build at least.  25k a furious explosive. 
---
600 hours experience.  On xbox. But haven't played in 3 weeks. So unless economy shifted that quickly, I would say caps have value, unless you're a 1%er who has thousands of hours in this game with 20 characters over level 100 and max caps each.
---
You can get possum badges for these? How many each time?
---
It was hanging out on an inaccessible upper area (surrounded by brick walls). You could only access the area if you removed an interior wall. I heard a “Not us...” while shopping at his vending machine, instinctively turned and VATS’ed it.
---
I sell for 30 caps per scrip. It’s high enough that it won’t just get gobbled up—ideally someone who will actually use the item will find it—but cheap enough that it doesn’t sit for long. One star items sell fastest, which works for me. It keeps my weight well regulated. Smart people buy the 3 stars though, same value, less weight.
---
"This is Fine"
---
once you start running sbq regularly you will have more improved repair kits than you can use and repairing items stops being a thing you even think about.
---
"poison resistance" armor effect helps
---
NPCs that give you a canvas bag backpack as a quest reward that then scraps into plastic instead of ballistic fiber.
---
No. Not under daily or automated alerts
---
I did all 8 challenges for the possum badges about 2 months ago ( when the possum badges weren't dropping for the dallies). Very hard.  
---
 I did the Leatherworker badge up to 95% and realised deathclaw hides are as rare as hen's teeth. I thought you would just get them off deathclaws ( but no - only rarely ). Still haven't got that badge.
---
I had seen the high capacity backpack mod plan once at a player vendor beforehand for approx 10K caps and always regretted not getting it.  Hardest thing in the game to do IMHO but glad I eventually got it though nearly killed me.
---
Dog Meat forgives you.
---
So now is not the time to tell you I found my High Cap plan in a player vendor for I think 6k and the Armored for 4k a few days later?
---
 They seem to drop so rarely.
---
This is childs play for oldskool EverQuest players.
---
You want tough, work on your Quarm key, or do the Necromancer T1 Epic.
---
It’s a chance to get 1. So not every time. I’ve already collected three high cap two lead lined. Currently sitting on 7 badges on my main and 3 on my alt. Haven’t done a single challenge other than what you do for the quest
---
~3 new items (and often recycled items) every week or two is like anthem level premium store rotation. And like I said, the last bundle to interest me was the greenhouse one which I missed bc I was away. I got a few things from the alien one, but not the whole bundle bc I don’t really use melee weapons, and the blaster isn’t viable. I’m not expecting every week to be tailored to me but when the Mothman bundle and greenhouse bundle are the only ones I can even remember having any interest in, clearly there isn’t enough variety. Why aren’t there more emotes? Icons? Adding a small handful of items every week or two with a lot of recycling and not a lot of variety just doesn’t seem like a smart strategy for maximizing atom store activity.
---
Did you already activate it? I just did this last night on one of my characters? It should be a misc quest. You don’t get bucket list until you actually find them.
---
Do you realise to whom you are speaking? 'Mommy'? Please. I'm a self-made man, I had no help from my mother, nor my father. I pulled myself up by the bootstraps, which is clearly something that you are incapable of. 
---
Let me break it down for you little lad. You are still in the stage where you eat shit, Todd's shit specifically. You are his little drone, you will defend him at all costs, and buy whatever piss-drenched garbage he serves to you. I am in the stage where I no longer eat shit. Instead, I look Todd right in the eye and say this:
---
"No Todd Howard, I will not bend to your will."
---
You on the other hand listen to Todd's self-deifying ramblings, and thus, eat up his shit. I'm sorry. But before you give in, there is a way. I will pray for you so that our lord and saviour Jesus Christ may help you, he will leave you not to reprobation once you find him. You can also start right now by not listening to Todd's lies.
---
'Because you are haughty of heart, you say, 'A God am I! I occupy a Godly throne in the heart of the sea.'-Ezekiel 28:2
---
Very valued comment this. Ty
---
Aye.  I start at 75 and go up 50 per star from there.  Allows for scrip buyers and resales as well.  I have a few regulars that way.
---
Excellent ideas here
---
I don't know, but this morning I found a CAMP with 55 water purifiers WAT?   https://imgur.com/a/M4NUBzn
---
Yep seller's have become increasingly greedy and Bethesda has not helped this
---
I'll test this, I have two armor pieces with 25% poison I think, one a chest with dense. Thanks!
---
Agreed
---
I like the making caps harder to get idea
---
All along the western front. Much of it is really flat.
---
I'm not sure what your hot take here is or what your issue with the "caps economy"  is :( 
---
Not all vendors sell good stuff at good prices.  For my, maybe one out of twenty camps I visit can a get a bargain on something that I really want.  And that's fine - it's part of the game.  Getting experience in where and how to look for good camp vendors is minigame itself.
---
It's funny how no one seems to know for certain, maybe the green mist is some kind of complex hybrid damage that is confusing the issue, like poison, rad and explosive or something, anyway, I'll try throwing on some poison resist armor and see what happens :)
---
It happened to me last week; after a while, I had TWO following me around, I think they brought extra business to my vendors
---
I spend a crazy amount of caps fast travelling to camps to shop and get bette gear. It's becoming a waste of time these days tbh
---
You should like it all but no one is perfect. This sub has a lot aginst a hard game so that's to be expected. If you want caps to mean something then it has to be hard to get.
---
This. Chance to drop 1. I do them all the time now and plan on selling excess plans...
---
Vending is individual to the player I agree
---
Of course I now have a mental image of giant ScorchBeasts flying around in giant diapers, poison proof ones.
---
I’ll double check tonight to make sure.
---
No - his remark is spot on.  But you are being very uncivil with someone who simply had a different outlook on the game.
---
Yeah, I got a bloodied handmade at level 10 and it's still putting in work against lvl 60 ads. Thanks for the advice. I really needed a bump to my survivability
---
It's an impossible weapon to obtain other than trading. And does absurdly high damage.
---
Not defending all the steps that went into this mess (legacy weapons remaining in game, lack of cap sinks, etc) but  you are trying to buy a weapon that outclasses anything that will drop short of a BE that you are built around.
---
That’s what I do. Trade the plans when I get to 8 badges
---
No no no, that will be 800 atoms.
---
Thank you for warning us
---
&gt; Vending is individual to the player I agree
---
OK - I don't even know what you mean here :(
---
no they were only available one at a time
---
Had no idea. Thanks!
---
the dive bomb spray is poison, countered by armor with poison resist.  
---
Poison resist comes in increments of 25 per armor piece.  1 piece is enough to mitigate maybe 80% of the damage, to the point where a purified water will offset it and a stim is overkill.  2 pieces = you will receive 0 damage.  
---
The SBQ herself is a source of rads, so you will often receive rads when she dive bombs thanks to her proximity.
---
Honestly, I think a big issue is that there is basically no market for starter and mid-tier items. Back when I started, you could find people selling good, but not god tier items. Demand for things like this has dried up, and caps are easier to acquire than ever. The only market left is the end-game market.    
---
Frankly, I think expecting to get S-tier equipment for caps is a bit silly, but I get why the expectation is there. Caps are essentially legal tender backed by Bethesda. Naturally, players have created their own economy.
---
I dont agree . His comment reflected someone who clearly did not read the original post or who understood the theme.
---
There is a super secluded lil pond in the NW corner, just east of the lumber yard that's in the top corner. It's on top of the short mountain, and has a but of flat land you can build on.
---
I agree with your comments here. Mid tier items need a boost
---
Ugh, who cares?
---
Atom Shop is a fucking overpriced scam.
---
They are adding the legendary part later
---
The dense effect will help against the sorchbeast sonic blast or w/e it's called - it's considered explosive. I have dense chest + fireproof lvl 2, their ranged attacks do 0 damage
---
How long does that 200% last?
---
That's an opinion.  What is a *fact* is you calling his comment "stupid".  That is not how grown men and women operate in the real world.
---
If you can stomach the bugs (both new and returning with each patch now) and love Fallout, then absolutely. Otherwise, probably not.
---
Look troll. You are boring me now. Offer something constructive or just shut up ok?
---
Excellent ! Thanks for a definitive answer, I just checked and I picked up Blight after I died from a SB at Mount Blair before I Alt F4 rage quit, so that confirms it, poison.
---
Can't wait to try with my two poison leather pieces :)
---
It’s called supply and demand, it’s a pretty basic thing in economics. Usually the seller determines prices and if people want to get the product they have to spend the money (caps). Your theory is flawed pirateglenn and if I had to guess it’s because you either get outbid on items or your luck hasn’t been very good. Also I’ve been playing the game since beta. I’ve found some great items in player vending machines and the likewise I sell some great items cheaper than you’ll find on the marketplace.  However I do agree with you that you do see some items being strictly traded for other items. Again economics, the seller dictates what they want for there item(s).
---
Awesome! Hit me up whenever I’m on east coast time but I’m normally on! And yes Ricketty Cricket!
---
It's a pretty basic thing in economics? Sounds condescending. Ok.
---
REQUEST: allow characters  to overdose and die c:
---
I’m so upset. My PS4 died and I am sending it in for repair. I’m going to miss everything. :(
---
I ALMOST bought some of the facepaints for a new character I made. Glad I didn't.
---
So the other person is "stupid" and now I'm a "troll" because I disagree with you.  
---
Seriously - there are some issues on your part to resolve here.
---
running on PC.. to be fair, this is the first time Ive noticed since I started in Jun that something is missing.. but then again I rarely scrutinise careful what I have... I just know for a fact about this particular ammo cos its what Ive been making since getting a Mutants handmade with exploding rounds... made more tonight but it's not the point... :)
---
You're doing God's work
---
Twice as long? Lol
---
Oh I thought about it, but resisted
---
yeah I tried logging off, back in, reboot and back in but it didnt work :(
---
That is harsh!.. Im sorry for your loss.... sheeesh!!!
---
Indeed i payed over 150k in trades for my bloodied explosive plasma gatling but what  trying to stress at is the hostility of some traders here  I work a 9-5 job every 5 days a week dont have the luxury to be sitting around all day playing this game as much as i would love i believe there is a need in a serious attitude shift.
---
&gt; That’s today’s state of the game since survival mode ended...
---
people have been getting ganked at workshops on a regular basis since the game came out..
---
and rightfully so I might add...
---
When I'm rolling with friends I'm usually like... "*you'd better get a shot in before I kill it*"
---
I like how this has become our 
---
&gt;	Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
it's super messed up bat piss.
---
So should I just stop doing events til then?
---
Btw the increased the drops for deathclaw hides pretty significantly. May want to get back at it
---
Yeah ... like I said... stuff happens.  I've already remade most of the armor again - just need to farm some yellowcake and some aluminum and I'll have the set again.
---
Maybe it was my fault or maybe it was a Bethesda glitch.... either way .. it's just a game :)
---
It's poison.  for certain.  
---
Dense helps with the shriek doughnut attack as that's explosive.  Dense + fireproof ranks makes you immune to the shriek.  
---
From there the last 2 sources of damage are rads, countered by RR and melee countered by blocker and other damage mitigation options like dodgy, serendipity, emergency protocols, lone wanderer, etc.
---
Lol BL3 is a lot more fun than a dumpster fire
---
I couldn't agree more. I am not currently selling any legacy weapons, and only have the one (TSE tesla) but either I'm not going to try to sell them or I'm damn well not going to try getting more caps than I could ever use. What's the point?
---
I'm struggling right now to stay BELOW 30k with a vendor machine... that alone is a huge stressor at times (oddly enough), so hoarding an obscene amount of caps at the expense of someone else simply makes no sense.
---
I mean you can keep doing them because you still sometimes get a 1 star piece as a reward and not all are bogged down awol seems pretty empty sometimes
---
Pretty close, it'd be 317 days if you could go 24/7. Considering that there are a few players that consistently do 8 hours a day, I would expect the first player to get this legitimately to brag about it halfway through the game's third year.
---
But of course PC players macro'ing / bot'ing the client 24/7 will get there sooner. You could do the same on consoles (like some peeps did on a smaller level afk'ing Grahm's Meat-Cook), but think of all the carbon dioxide you'd be causing (or your electricity bill, should you care) for a mere 20 Atoms..!
---
That sucks, someone made off like a bandit haha
---
Yeah, I've had lag spikes and stutters, but these are a little worse than those.
---
Unfortunately it almost seems like the market needs a big public in ur face kinda dupe like bethesda putting sime old methods back into place for a brief time... very brief... not because i suport duping or cheater and have no intrest in doing it myself but there was a time when legacy items cost 85k to 100k+ or simply trade only and then bam big dupe came out very easy very public and the value of a legacy dropped to under 15k damn near over night and for a time caps were of value again so thats option 1 but really it shouldnt take such measures thats just what worked in the past
---
Option 2 make droprates for the super high value items outragesouly high for a short chunk of time im talking fixers out the yin yang BE handmades by the boatload uny/van sent/cav pow armor pieces qnd Qffr teslas dropping daily... for a short time, it could even be done in such a way like clean appalachia so kill xxx thousand amount of whatever creature increse drop rates for specific rolls and it could change week to week
---
That's insane, so many caps lost.. 😅
---
Not that I'm aware of; it can happen anywhere at any time.
---
........ You're right, that was a stupid question. Good job me
---
This too, yes. That wasn't an issue I ever had, but now you mention it I am waiting longer sometimes for terminals and such to load.
---
I got 4 of them during the last meat week. I gave away 3 and have one in my vendor for 0 caps that hasn't disappeared. I'm not sure what that says about value considering the other responses here.
---
Go to Sunshine there is a nice flat spot right by the bridge, you can also up up north and you are free to build it "flat" in the water if you want.
---
Hmm, that's the only thing that causes my game to give me the "Not Responding" prompt. Others have those problems when people are using legacy explosive laser weapons near them. Otherwise, sorry I'm out of ideas.
---
This is why the change suggested is to keep increasing it by a tiny amount periodically. This game stability is one of main challenges it faces - at the same time its business model depends on players buying shit - allowing us to store more in a stable way is one of main priorities, as far as product aimed to generate stable income is concerned.
---
Have you exited the game completely and reset your PC/console?
---
Yeah agreed but a lot people here will criticise you for your either overspending or under spending. You can not win like the saying goes an item is only worth what another thinks it is. Personally i gather caps try build my self a nice selection if armor/weapons its taken me months and alot of trading but it works ive just given up on people who criticise my posts even now people would rather downvote my comments here which in all and all just proves my point in the hostility that exists here.
---
Fair
---
The clow outfit in the atom bundle would be quite fitting ,if not for the stripes being white.
---
Wheres that
---
&gt; I have dense chest + fireproof lvl 2, their ranged attacks do 0 damage
---
I have experimented with full fireproof perk card in and out of play and from my experience fireproof does *nothing* to mitigate SBQ damage. Now I just keep a full rad resistant perk card in play and no fireproof at all and I suffer negligible damage from scorchbeast ranged attacks.
---
Fuck. Guess who needs to read more? This tired fucker! 
---
*downvotes self for being an idiot*
---
Main reason I scabber skin, I have a mixed armor set but I wanted all the pieces to match.
---
Love how you describe skyrim enderal just as a bunch of cheaters that can't handle to play the game like Bethesda's intended. Or who doesn't know the greatest cheat of all time? Counter strike, such a boring cheat in the perfect multiplayer of half life.
---
/s
---
The crap dustin green stuff is poison and the green cheerio blasts are explosive apparently. I have bloodied dude, too, you want dense chest and a few ranks of Fireproof perk and a couple (maybe 3? that legendary MLQ still messes me up) Poison Resist pieces and you're fine.
---
Yeah I didn't read properly, my bad dude lol
---
But would be cool. Currently I've no idea where to get more Nuka recipes
---
Which of the riders should I get? They all look so cool.
---
the road south of flatwoods (by the ag center) head west on it you will come to sunshine, hillfolk hotdogs and a substation there is a bridge between hillfolk and sunshine if you go down to the river there is a huge open area.
---
Ya,.. u think right.   
---
if u look a few meters more foward in the lake bed u can see an half-buried male skeletton.
---
should  be Leo i think ;)
---
As long as it can be done...
---
lol &lt;modding the shit out of it to cheat&gt;
---
Do you even mod? Because you sound like someone who has no idea what modding is about. The most popular mods add quality of life, new content, new gameplay systems, and new assets. When modders change the difficulty it's to make the game *harder*, not easier, like with the major mods Horizon, DUST, FROST, J Sawyer mod (which was created by one of the main devs of New Vegas, BTW). 
---
Someone who doesn't understand what they're arguing against isn't a person anyone should listen to.
---
I'm going to pose a question. When you get to a point that you can finally one shot things will you do it? My point is I think some people get there and just try out their new toys, after all that is what we are all going for. 
---
As someone who can one shot things I can say it is fun. However, I do try and remember to switch to less powerful options when in a crowded event but I know sometimes I do forget. 
---
Another option is to try and team up with them at the event so that way if you are in the proximity of the kill you still get the drops just no XP. Most people wont take random team invites but some people understand why you do it at events. 
---
Fear not, one day you will be thinking, "wow tha is for saving me a hit, I mean I could go do that too but I was trying to be courteous." Even the plays that can one shot get locked out by others doing the same.
---
"Do you realize who you're speaking to?" A narcissistic bible banger?
---
The green stuff is not poison so poison resistance will not help.
---
It's the way of Reddit and even more to the point, this toxic subreddit. You don't hear a lot of  what I'd term "reasonable" voices... either the manic high of "Fallout 76 is the best, ignore the haters!" or the despair filled "Todd Howard killed my Dogmeat with his bear hands!"
---
You can post the most reasoned and well thought out post and get downvoted. You can simply point out a massive bug (turrets disappearing, not showing as stored or built, but unable to rebuilt even at 9/10) and get downvotes. I honestly don't know if it's people who are so insanely invested in the game that anything not glowingly positive gets an immediate downvote or people trying to poison the sub by downvoting everything.
---
i think an textchat for the eventarea could help alot too...maybe limeted to max 15 letters ore something like that. just an idea
---
Yep
---
Hm, better do that with an empty junk tab. Some players will kite any and all mobs to your camp once they realize you're afk, and I'm not sure what happens when your cooking station gets wrecked under your ass (or your bed while you're sleeping in it).
---
So you risk either A) coming back to find a Respawn [X] screen (and your loot taken), or B) coming back to a &lt;Disconnected because of Inactivity&gt;, and upon relogging you'll find your camp trashed and your junk tab empty.
---
Better not do this on your main character, I figure.
---
Its cool. I've done the same.
---
Counterstrike,  Another battle royal peice of shit shooter.
---
it was popular because it was the only one of its time.  You either played CS or Quake.
---
They were just as stupid as CoD is now.  Just another game for wannabe soldiers who couldnt hack it in the real service.
---
You know it'll be more like 2400
---
Definitely wait till 50 imo. There's a market for lower level items, but it's niche.
---
I nuked white springs a couple days ago fast traveled to the look out watched it blow and as soon as I jumped off the cliff I got server disconnect and then my xbox shut off luckily I had a buddy still in and was able to rejoin lol
---
Something is wacky with it, I have 5 industrial purifiers and after an hour theres like (5) in one, (3) in a couple others, one has (1) and another is empty. Makes zero sense, they're all in water, why the fuck would one be empty and another has 5
---
Also let me access items that were placed beneath the ground so I can delete or move them.  
---
(I'm on a hill and have occasionally accidentally snapped something to the under-hill side of a foundation so am burning up budget on invisible items)
---
If Skyrim Enderal is full of mods, then yes, they are a bunch of cheaters who couldnt handle the game as it was built.
---
Looks like two could fit....
---
I don't know anymore my guess keyboard warriors with a lot of spare time on their hands and would rather downvote rather than actually have a discussion like we are doing.
---
I always jump into events with a Tesla that doesn’t do much dmg for this reason. I will however switch to my JE .50 the first time I see someone one hit something(always seems to be a guy in a crazy outfit and a DCG). My goal at that point is to make sure he gets no hits on anything.
---
I actually just made a thread about new, odd, lag spikes myself earlier in the day.
---
I oneshot during census violence to get my shielded wetsuit plan reward then gtfo of there.
---
If you want legendary's then go farm West tek and the radar array brick building.
---
as a serious d1 player back in the day... yup
---
I hit up anywhere from 10-20 vendors a night (server hopping for the simple purpose of dumping caps since I'm always at around max). This is in my 1.5 hours of playtime mind you.
---
And while there is a LOT of crap (the same couple dozen workshop plans for just a bit too much or worse starter stuff for anything north of 0... I'm looking at you chemistry workbench!) there are LOTS and LOTS of gems to be had. At least one or two a night will have very cheap scrip fodder (40-50 caps per scrip makes me happy) so I'm generally able to max that out daily. I've never gotten anything god tier, but a couple full sets of weapon weight reduction armor, a solid unyielding set with decent secondaries and quite a few nice weapons.
---
Mind you it's all circular at this point. I buy primarily buy crap legendaries to turn into scrip to then gamble with everyone's favorite molema'am... which in turn is by and large more crap. Though with the the introduction of event items on the purveyor loot table, I've already gotten 2 \*VERY\* nice Fixers that are in my current rotation so it's a win-win atm.
---
A few weeks ago I had to disassemble my entire roof and a third of the walls to place a lamp back under a staircase because I tried to move it only to find that building rules had changed and it now automatically placed them above the stairs.  Also my stash used to be tucked in under my stairs but when I tried to adjust the location found to my horror that that placement was no longer possible.  
---
Please let us use the space under stairs again!!
---
An oceans worth of PVP games without consequences doesn’t mean they’re good.  Although you bring up a lot of good points and I may be presently my somewhat salty opinion as fact. 
---
To me Survival which is in a persistent world should have real consequences. The way it was only the defender really lost anything of consequence if they were holding a workshop. If an attacker can die and just keep coming back over and over and over it’s not much fun anymore.
---
Well then I'm a fucking arsehole and I bid you good day.
---
Yeah, those are public.
---
Thats the key.  If you are at a crafting station, the game doesnt log you out for inactivity because the XBox thinks you are actively playing (something to do with the crafting station being open, much like when your watching netflix, it doesnt log you out for inactivity)
---
Like I said, I found this by accident.  But it comes in handy when I have to leave my living room to take care of something, and dont want to leave my world.
---
If you have junk on your character while you are at your own base, then you deserve to lose it all.  This is where you keep your stash box.
---
Also, Kited mobs reset once the original aggroer is out of range, they will run back to spawn spot.
---
Good luck running a bunch of mobs to my camp, its not in a very populated area, and pretty devoid of critters.
---
It's easier and more pleasurable (to some) to simply say "you're wrong!" than try to defend their own beliefs or even more challenging... consider those of another. Knowing, with absolute conviction, that our ideas and ideals are right is a very easy trap to fall into.
---
I dont think you can TAME them, (I could be wrong) but I do know that if you have a pet at your CAMP it can BECOME Scorched if your camp gets attacked by a Scorchbeast.
---
I actually really wanted one of those Horsemen skins, so this makes me happy.
---
If electrician wasn't bugged or Campfire Tales actually occurred a reasonable amount of time I would have my 8. 
---
It's really tiring.
---
Hard bargain, weapon artisan, etc - those items you only use at workbenches and vendors.... 
---
Unequip those and put in perks good while adventuring/fighting.
---
When you get to a bench or vendor, swap them out - you can swap as many as you want/need at any time.  
---
Tedious at times, but it will help your damage numbers.
---
Or click ignore players on server and nobody can see your dot. It allows a quick stealth approach and buys some time to claim.
---
Map watching is a serious PvP skill.
---
Nice one!
---
Selfish .....
---
*If you believe that one, I have a chemistry bench in my vendor I’ll sell ya for only 1,000 caps.*
---
I really hope that Bethesda put on a good show for Halloween this year, and for a reasonable price. Also allow us to  give out  free candy at are camps, for a special reward at the end. In addition play Halloween music on one of the radio stations, and maybe do a best costume contest. I strongly believe if done right it could be one of the biggest and best community events  to date. 
---
I wish everyone the best.
---
Thats what i wanted people to know i got super discouraged especially once i found out one last week was glitched
---
Is there somewhere specific in game where you can buy combat armor mods?
---
ppl should just carry an underpowered secondary to tag n wait
---
We have no time for that. There's a settlement that needs your help. I'll mark the location on your map.
---
I don’t they’re expecting you to have all the things. I think why’re just giving you a buffet of stuff so that you can pick out 3 plates or so of food. (So long as you like raiders)
---
I think it all depends upon what type of person you like to be, in your interactions with a fellow human.  You decide.
---
For this reason I keep a low end rifle on me.  For things like Uranium Fever, or lower events.   
---
When someone rushes in and one shot kills all the legendaries just to be a dick, thats just fucking rude.
---
If you are one of these people, learn some class, learn some ettiquette, and help out the others who are there for the same reason you are. 
---
Taking a lvl 40s chance to pull a 3\* out of uranium fever just because you want to show off your new junkies handmade is not the right thing to do.   Pull out a fucking pistol and tag it once until the lowbies get a chance. 
---
Or do you just want to control the entire game market and make sure noone but you gets any gear?
---
Daawww that made me smile thanks for recognizing.  :)
---
legacy items shouldnt be tradeable
---
if you want a wetsuit plan go buy it off a vendor and stop being a dick.
---
I have a bit of legacy weapons via trading high level weapons lol. I like the value in them. Every game has discontinued items it seems.
---
wash it down with some whisky using "party boy/girl" perk for good measure ;)
---
No, i dont do it.  I have a 10mm pistol on me at all times just for this reason.
---
they make 10mm pistols for a reason
---
&gt; If you wish harm on someone for being AFK at their own camp, then you are the dickhead, not the AFKer. Afterall, its his house, not yours, he built it, not you.
---
&gt; Fallout players tend to not be that vengeful. Now I could see if someone was AFK at your camp, but not their own.
---
I wasn't advocating that kind of behaviour, just warning that those people exist. Of course you can avoid all that by afk'ing at a crafting station at Artisan's Corner within the Whitespring.
---
I do this. But I don’t like it as far as a solution. I think the real problem is PVP balance.
---
Agrees.and that was the huge problem with ARK too manny cheated useing Console Commands.made it no longer fun.
---
Yes, that probably works as well.  I just never go to Whitesprings anymore, because my base is very central, and its a better staging point than the damn golfcourse.
---
no yes maybe
---
Yeah but campfire tales is now a public event. I've seen it pop once since public events started.
---
You can still do Dolly Sods daily
