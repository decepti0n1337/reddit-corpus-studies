Thanks for the support. Lol. I love this comment.

Well if they were duping they had one to begin with.  You can't dupe nothing.

"Legit" player who buys stuff from dupers, knowing there is a 99.9% chance it is a duped gun.
---
Luckily, this is a video game and not court. 
---
But the reasons of it beong super cheap at extreme quantities. 
---
Again, Bethesda would have to educate and post about their intentions beforehand.
---
Unfortunately, I don't suspect this will ever go thru because dupers/buyers, like yourself, would start posting YouTube videos about being "falsely banned" and thousands would blindly believe them. Just like the first banwave. 
---
Whoa, finally a fun storyline and quest, somebody hire this guy 
---
Could it have said 'Adventure Mode'? A vertical box on the screen over the background image? If so, then yes, I've been getting it to randomly since last patch. Its the new name for the current way we play. They are adding a new hardcore PVP mode. See: [https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/1PnLPLl6a8D6gPNWvSVA0Q/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-24-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/1PnLPLl6a8D6gPNWvSVA0Q/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-24-2019) for more info.

*Hey just noticed..* It's your **6th Cakeday** Runecreed! ^(hug)
---
Maybe it could take the place of a torso armor slot. I’d say that’s a fair trade off. Or it has to have some sort of similar trade off
---
If this improves performance and stability even just a little I'm completely fine with them removing useless objects.
---
Not if that 1% held 99% of the TSEs in the game. It's sort of a like a metaphor for real life wealth...
---
Probably Marathon, but that's a really old sandwich.
---
Punch car.    Explosion.   Zen.
---
People trying to trade with you is griefing?
---
They could but it would take too long. The old method was 1 becomes 2, 2 becomes 4, 4-8, 16, 32, 64, 128 etc.
---
Placebo. Even the dupers got to keep at least one of each item as a seed for future duping. 
---
I believe that all accounts locked and quarantined were deleted from their service thus liberating strain to servers 
---
If you are on PC, I have a spare at level 50
---
It's been back up for 6 hours
---
Maybe it's a steel can.   High in iron.
---
&gt; the spice containers I horde
---
where is the best place to get pepper (serious question)
---
Problem I have with this, there is absolutely no way to know if the Griefers are american.  Thats pure speculation.  They can say it all they want, but they could be German, Italian or any other country.   I have seen many German that can speak perfect english without any accent.   Otherwise good post cept for that.  Leave out the insinuations.
---
Funny to think of what a Tron era PC was actually packing in terms of processing power. Sure MCP, we can play a game. Have you got 70GB free to download it?
---
LOL i sent her off one day and dont know where to find her anymore :(
---
Wait you can't?
---
Btw ik never launched a nuke before, but I'm getting close to it!
---
:shrug: 
---
Whatever, my dude. 
---
You sound like a fallout fanboy.
---
"fuck the dupers! they should be banned and all duped items removed!"
---
&gt;Bethesda says they gonna do this
---
"woah now hold on I didn't say touch MY duped shit" 
---
finally!
---
yeah im actually impressed on this one.
---
Shit, me too.  This is why I can never complete (HA! I can barely start, who’s kidding?!) an evil play through on any damn game.  GOD!  Why do I always have to be such a frickin’ bleeding heart.
---
Eh, I am disappointed.  I wanted a 99% reduction of all TSE, because thats really how many were duped.
---
Mutation serums absolutely affect game balance and give huge profits. Outfits are just profits, with rare ones going for 10k+.
---
You not realize zenimax is a different company?  InB4 you link the thread you made about bethesda needing to hire people cause I'm surprised you didn't already.
---
I wouldn't feel sorry for anyone who bought a TSE with caps of real cash and lost it. You knew there was a 99.99% change it was duped. Those are the breaks. You got lucky this time...
---
I like helping other players :)
---
I don't have a mic, is that ok?
---
Not true at all it is actually in favor of lower lvl players 
---
hahaha i know the feeling..but then i realized how many useless legendaries i have so i sell when i could or just leave them in one of the trash bins there
---
Today's hotfix was just to remove duplicated items. Patch 6 is coming next week apparently.
---
Haha. You're right, not sure why I was arguing this when I knew it would never happen. Have a happy valentine's day.
---
they never said they couldn't do it though, is the thing.
---
there is no actual statement from the developers that they couldn't track items, and now that they've told us they're going to be removing duped items, it means that they can actuly track them. 
---
Yea that’s fine
---
No. Then it be like a pool cue. Just good enough to be a serious weapon, bad enough to make you groan when you find a legendary variant
---
It's not. Caustic acid will do the trick as well.
---
Feel good vibes only. No meanies allowed.
---
Pro-tip? Seems pretty obvious to me.
---
Ive played for 80 ish hours only have the 1 character thus far. And hell yes ps4: complecks99 add me
---
I usually just drop that stuff off in a suitcase, sack, or cash register near one of the vendor bots. I understand that if you drop your stuff in a paper bag then it will disappear more quickly once you leave the area.
---
Really makes me curious why someone who "quit weeks ago" even bothers coming to this subreddit still.
---
lul
---
But then the TSA guy would get away with taking the beer.
---
That's a gross way of packing.
---
Lol. There is lore as well.
---
I feel famous.
---
nukes the apocalypse restraining order
---
makes sense to me
---
Yeah, I'm afraid to log in. Someone once gave me 700 super stimpaks.  I mean, they've all been used by now, or given away as good gestures to other players,  but still.
---
Daisycutter FTW. Only waists 2lbs of inventory. I keep it hoping that some day they will make fatmen not worthless.
---
I like this idea. something you have to deploy like power armor
---
Level 245 and the game sucks? it looks like your having fun. Last night there was a guy on there at Level 343 lol I'm like omg. Do people literally play the game all day and night long? scary.. Some folks need to unplug lol
---
Yes, I feel the same way. Since Uranium Fever apparently only rewards you with up to level 40 items, what is the best place to go to get 3-star enemies? (And please don't say the SBQ)
---
Is it nuked Whitesprings?
---
Not a different company. Bethesda is a subsidiary of Zenimax
---
How someone can possess such negligible empathy to understand people like things and don’t like things that differ from others is beyond me.  Empathy is just imagination, it’s not difficult.  
---
I usually do this by accident...and then act like I'm a boss when an explosion kills an enemy.
---
So if I am communist and put a scarecrow up will I still be safe?
---
Also known as Greifing Scum
---
[removed]
---
They are random and can spawn anywhere there's a magazine spawn. 
---
No, it’s disgusting fucking ;-/
---
Just as shitty as before. Laggy , disconnects &amp; takes forever to loot
---
Oh?
---
All the damn time 
---
Lol ok. Ur telling that to someone who was brought to half health in 30 seconds by someone without engaging them. I would have been 1 shit if i fought back. So you're wrong stop with the ignorance
---
If you are communist we turn your corpse into a scarecrow after we kill you.
---
There has been some chatter that the Outer Worlds isn't a good direct comparison to Fallout 76 in that Outer Worlds is not an open-sandbox game where you can play 100+ hours on just one character.
---
That doesn't mean we should just take their loaded statement of 1% like it viably means there was no duping or there aren't shitloads of duped items still in the economy.
---
What you say makes no sense lol
---
Do tell.
---
Also known as... a PvP player. Stop being a baby.
---
No
---
So a safe space.  Got it. 
---
Okay so that makes this flop any better?.... this game is shit... your comparing game is compared to the worst games ever. 
---
I'll be there in 10 minutes 😂
---
Where can I see the dupe list?
---
The most popular reshade presets have tons of thousands of unique downloads on the Nexus. If there was any truth to people being banned for it, I think there would've been more than just a handful of unconfirmed reports. They're fine.
---
There's a .ini editor over the Nexus mods site (or whatever it's called now). I agree it should be in the options.
---
Don't agree about DoF though, it's the way our eyes see so adds a lot of realism for me and looks gorgeous but then again I'm a photographer so a bit biased.
---
Yeah, I know I'm in the minority (which is fine). I will try it again some day though.
---
I second this. Visit us over there
---
No. Maybe a mod exist I know one exist for fallout 4 .
---
Lol. But really though, communism is bad news.
---
Yay, I bet you're excited for Survivor Mode, where these asshats can 1 shot you. Doesn't that sound like fun?
---
I have 1200 purified water....u calling me a duper? 
---
Listen, it's not that I don't believe you. I just need to see a screenshot of this because I didn't know it existed and I might have a new goal
---
Before I am done playing I’ll look for a low level and give him food water stimpacks radaways and any known plans.  If no one is around then I go to the overseer camp or Flatwoods and leave them there
---
Omg that is so not true.
---
^ This guy ~~singles~~ Fallouts
---
One of us, Homer...one of us...
---
There's a hard limit but if you had above that before the patch then the only difference is you couldn't add to it
---
I mean we need at least one communist faction in fallout 76 and there is the ash heap and watoga that has some communist aspects to them
---
You speaking from personal experience ?
---
Eh, I am still disappointed about the lack luster nuke of the duped items.
---
Bad call I say.  Let those people off the hook.
---
I remember seeing the same thing, but that was also closer to launch, so I imagine they either found a way or created one to combat this type of problem. 
---
While this would be funny and all, adding this to the loot table would mostly just decrease the chances that people ever see anything they actually want. 
---
Same.
---
Sums up a lot of the community sadly...
---
Lol same...
---
Hey let's not encourage that...
---
Eh no. I'm guessing previous Fallout fans couldn't less on the whole.
---
My deathclaw going around with my knife icon over its head ahahah
---
Reminds me of this scene lol
---
https://youtu.be/XvijyBIgazE?t=22
---
Same reason you’re checking responses on this post, to see if a dumpster fire gets better or worse. 
---
Please go into how dupers are destroying this game. Im not trying put you down or argue opinion. Im just curious for some examples 
---
1200 purified water is a lot easier then getting 1000 nuka quantums... So no.
---
Banned
---
We are against communism and socialism. We belive on the free market..... and murder. 
---
They'll all self destruct if you knock out their control module or whatever the little thing on their back is called.
---
Still kinda garbage talent then in my case they should consider the redesign as things like that would make a more dynamic game..
---
It’s a carryover from FO4’s legendary mutation mechanic. Three star legendaries get it twice as they’re assumed to be “tougher” legendaries
---
incredibly high level strangers initiating unwanted trades is annoying.
---
If I tell you NO THANK YOU, I shouldn’t have to say it 2-3x..
---
How long do you think now OP?
---
You do you then have a good time then (^-^)
---
&gt; Increase to stash
---
OH HELL YEAH!
---
Hawke's Refuge, Freddy's Fear House kitchen, Palace of the Winding Path kitchen, Red Rocket Megastop diner, Mosstown, Watoga HS.  All have decent amounts of pepper, sugar, and spices.
---
Good another "I quit", just go find something you like playing now.
---
Have an upvote for candor and sensibility.
---
I got home from work about an hour ago l... My wife has been playing since noon
---
Why would I read the whole thing? Whining is whining.
---
Any specific part you want to provide evidence/proof for? Or just the whole thing. 
---
Yeah but you mostly hear about people complaining about the PvP balance even though PvP is garbage in this game with our without this change..
---
If only they had made a game in the same engine in the recent decade that this was possible(like skyrim)
---
I'm not subbed to bitch about the game... I'm just waiting for the game to become playable. Gonna keep looking for updates here and maybe check in around the year mark.
---
Really? Is your ego so fragile?
---
He's bored now because he has done everything he thinks the game has to offer.  Just incidentally, he happens to be level 155.  Its just there to show he played out the entire game.
---
Great sub
---
I love building camps and workshops and collecting new plans and decorations. Every since the servers became stable I will just start capturing as many workshops as I can before the price gets to high and build them up. 
---
I feel you bro. But there are really some problems with this game. Not for me specifically. Playing with a team feels pretty good when all is working. Still,  Bethesda deserves the backlash because they can do better and handled this launch really poorly. 
---
And sure, people complain way too much but that's their right. People like you and me can just move on, ignore the nonsense and keep on keeping on. 
---
I appreciate your response and I am cautiously optimistic for new PvE content. Thank you.
---
Unfortunately, I've been having issues hearing the wind up SFX (like a capacitor charging) indicating they're about to.  Occasionally the game plays it.  Sometimes I have to go searching for a brown baggy.  Devs like to keep it interesting.
---
Whatever you say buddy.
---
I like timing it so it explodes next to a mob. It's fun to watch them fly!
---
I have 1001 nuka quantums, am i a duper?
---
I would but my controller isn't working right now
---
This. 
---
Yeah, exactly. As long as we didn't have 150 TSE handmade rifles then it doesn't matter.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'd stopped selling for a while because dupers had run riot but I think I'll start posting my inventory again now it's been culled.
---
I get occasional flickering on distant objects on load, but that resolves in a few seconds.  Haven't had crashing issues or any issues with objects loading.
---
I don't use TSE and I still one shot everything except the queen.. you don't need TSE just a cohesive build... I just played TSE come combat shotgun in FO4 and wanted to experience that in it's full glory in this game and now that it's complete shit I lost all motivation to play this game..
---
/u/Ladydevann would some of this new PvE content entail the previously discussed (on this sub) Oompa Loompa Mole Miners in the NukaCola bottling plant at all?
---
Actually at level one I was attacked by someone with the trade emoji in flatwoods.   But at that level I couldn't take pvp damage.  I generally just try to avoid other players.  
---
No, but the luck card 'Good With Salt' at max rank causes food to spoil 90% slower.
---
Out of \~45 people I played this with on xbox, I am the only person that refused to trade weapons and armor to avoid duped items.  Every single one of my friends admits that their main weapon and most of their armor is most likely duped as they paid a couple thousand caps for all of it.  
---
1% of people having a few thousand copies, sure.  1% of people having duped items?  Bullshit.
---
I was wondering the same . I did three events and got three three star weapons all melee unfortunately for me.
---
 I found one once. Its on my BOS Heavy Combat Chest. 
---
 Its the only one I've ever seen. My present put 40 levels into farming plans and mods. 
---
Well, I guess it’s time to reinstall?
---
I had this happen to me once, it was a rad cockroach inside the can.
---
1. Server stability
---
2. The economy is flooded with duped items, anyone trying to sell legit farmed items now lost their market (natural supply/demand is destroyed)
---
3. People buy duped items for beginning game caps, reaches end game quickly, now states they are bored and give poor reviews.
---
4. Duping in an exploit in a multiplayer game. Exploits in a multiplayer game causes terrible reviews. See YouTube.
---
5. Devs have to waste their time on this major exploit rather then creating more content.
---
6. Destroys sense of achievement went super rare items can now be bought for a minimal amount of caps.
---
7. Prevents updates such as player vending.
---
I understand there are plenty of other problems that Bethesda shot themselves in the foot with.
---
Ego lmao, pink armor skins? I need awesome black templar or such but not the shite they have for like $16 each pfft 
---
I finally participated in my first SBQ killing at level 42 last night. Not only did the body show the loading circle the whole time before it just vanished but now my melee weapon is broken and I'm out of ammo for the 2  primary weapons I use. 
---
Since I now only carry one of each type of weapon so that I can fast travel  I'm going to have to spend a bunch of time doing stuff so that I can resume playing the game. Sucks when your play time is so limited and you have to spend half of it managing inventory and gathering stuff just to be able to play the game. 
---
A bigger stash would allow me to keep  more crafting inventory and some backup weapons. It is desperately needed. This increase is only another step in the right direction but still a pain point like the 200 cap vendor limits. It would take me more than a week of grinding just to be able to buy the signs and letters plans. 
---
I hope they keep going in this direction more. 
---
I have had this happen a few times I think it’s from storing your camp/ moving your camp and then it gets stored. While an item destroyed. It doesn’t know what to do wit the destroyed item. It’s there but you can place it and it just bugs out. 
---
I love the perfect storm. Made sure to wait until level 50 to get it. Wish Bethesda would let us level up unique weapons. I miss the Somerset Special 
---
Overdrive was changed in a patch sometime after this post. (Don’t remember exactly which one) It used to give chance to critical hit outside of vats but it doesn’t seem to do that anymore. Not that we can reliably know either way with no way to tell if you got a crit outside of vats. Originally it didn’t even work and then the effect was fixed in a patch, a patch or two later the tooltip was changed to what it is now.
---
It’s a confusing drug though since measuring its effects isn’t really possible right now. Doesn’t surprise me that different webpages are outdated or say different things. 
---
Sunk cost fallacy.
---
Also, actually enjoying the grinding now. Learnt to mellow out a little and live with the issues. No fun to moan all the time.
---
B\*tch, do you know how many legendary rolling pins and wood armor pieces I have!? 
---
I didn't care for it, either. Probably played 6 or so hours with a friend (because he bought it for me), never wanted to play it solo.
---
Nope. Just did SBQ and got two 2* pieces of armor.
---
I just hop around the map to locations that spawn super mutants. I have marsupial so I sneak around and if there are no legendaries I go to a new spot. I usually do a couple runs through Whitesprings per session, mostly for gear to sell for caps but sometimes find good loot there. I always check to make sure nobody is in an area before I go there so I can hopefully spawn fresh enemies.
---
My rule doesn't count for Whitesprings unless it's been nuked. Don't go to Whitesprings if someone is there, it's a solo run and I'm not standing around waiting for someone to tag one hit ghouls.... LOL.
---
Probably not I would bet good money that at least some of the duper stories are made up to make people think that you care I’ve never seen a duper neither have my friends or any of the randoms I’ve chatted with in game 
---
It's mods on the weapon itself that give the fourth star. Add the safcificial blade to any machete and it gains a star. Don't get too excited. 
---
Damn
---
Mine still does 
---
If you only had one It should be fine. They only targeted stacks
---
to use a plastic bag for your dirty clothes to store in your luggage?
---
I know a guy who still has 162 TSE momo shotguns.
---
LMAO. :D love it. But more then likely you duped or bought from a duper. In the rare scenario that you spent 1000 hours farming quantumss without using any... Submit a ticket for being wrongly banned.
---
yeah, i am thinking i got that disappearing item from inventory bug.   not removed by beth.
---
Roses are red
---
Violets are blue
---
Can you spare some vegetable starch?
---
I could really use some glue ❤️
---
Yet there are two others doing the same thing that \*are\* trying to kill you... or your camp.
---
Just my trusty 3* faster swing +1 str ghouls slaying pitchfork but it's my whitespring farm weapon
---
Good try buddy. While your joke was lost on me at first I did get a kick out of reading the exchange between y'all. 😋
---
Yeah I got on earlier and I still have it so I’m chillin
---
Yeah I knew about the machete. I'm more curious about the combat rifle
---
Note that the 1% is based on all accounts including inactive ones. Also given a single duper can create thousands of items, there is enough dupes to supply each account with at least 10 dupes, something that should drop 1/300k chance. Imagine how the fares with the economy. 
---
They’re doing it, booooooooooooys! They’re redeeming themselves!
---
_dusts off bethesda launcher_
---
Are you looking for combat or marine? What system?
---
Yes, same. Favorites disappear from the selection. Ps4 
---
Exactly what ended up happening. Targeted stacks of specific items and then on accounts that flagged for those they also removed their nuka colas
---
I take the same approach. Filthy Casuals isn't some BS safe space or for only people that blindly love it, it's just for people that are enjoying it and want to share that without the hate brigades that occasionally pop up elsewhere.
---
I treat it like r/historymemes vs r/history - they each serve their purpose, they just exist to filter different types of content so you can see just hash you're interested in at that moment quickly. 
---
I believe one of the patches accidentally removed the mod . Was hoping to get it back with the new patch. Guess not. 
---
You know what had me shaking my head at myself yesterday? I was crying--actual tears running down my face CRYING--over the Mars Rover being declared dead. I'm such a sap.
---
All robots self destruct if they are legendary.  Robots also self destruct if you damage their combat inhibitor.
---
That would be sweet
---
yea but 50 separate items on 50 separate characters doesn’t fuck the servers, the guy with 150,000 bobbleheads or nuka-colas however is what fucks the servers, this wasn’t about resetting the markets, it was about clearing out the stockpiles to take the load off the servers.
---
I've got one gun that I think is a dupe, which I still have after the so-called purge. So who knows.
---
That would work.  And make double shot explosive weapons vanilla already.  That way the dup buyers won't have and advantage... I like that idea!
---
Or shoot off all their arms.
---
This would be seriously useful.  Also useful would be the ability to ditch keys you don't care about anymore, or have a keyring C.A.M.P. object to store them in, or let them be put in stashes.
---
Every.
---
Single.
---
Time.
---
Loading a texture layer above the appearance is possible, right? “Blemishes” is an example of that. Changing the shape though? As long as the area of the hitbox of the head (from your example) doesn’t change, sure, why not? If your head was too tall, then you shouldn’t be able to go to places without bending down your head completely. You will only be able to play on streets and open fields. The Egghead.
---
This would be great. So much stuff clutters my inventory that is basically trash I plan to sell or scrap.
---
You are entitled to your opinion as are people who disagree with the state of the game, but saying you despise some of the players is really condescending and insulting.  
---
It’s similar to the players who claim they despise Bethesda.  What’s the difference?  Having that level of an emotional passionate reaction to people who’s opinion you don’t like, in my opinion, is worse than the opinions of the people you criticize,
---
People dissatisfied with this game paid good money and had high hopes.  They feel betrayed and let down.  You just seem like you feel superior and think they are bad people.
---
I haven’t seen many or any people claiming they despise people who claim this game isn’t as bad as others make it out to be.
---
You can criticize a game, support a game, have differing opinions, without saying you despise people.  
---
Yes it does, 1/2 of this sub really grinds my gears 
---
I applaud you, I wish I could.
---
XB1. The issues don't bother me as much as some (played games with much worse at launch/few months in), more of my friends play now than at launch, and its fun (playing as much as possible lately).
---
now why the hell was this deleted? it was just a question about the rad shower not working.
---
Do it all the time, everywhere I go.
---
Hmm.  Steam just had a great sale on the "Chinese New Year" event thing.  I picked up like 5 new games and they are just waiting to be played.  FO76 will take a backseat for now until all this mess cleaned up.  Hopefully dupers will move on to easier targets and griefers with TSE will have found funner games they can play.
---
Then I might come back to FO76 to the game it was during the first month with a great community again.  Right now, its not.   I never expected to have 3 perma-blocked people on my list.
---
kiss me
---
my level 7 with a level 5 short hunting rifle was tearing sh** up there (my alt have ton of playing experience)..i honestly didnt need anyone to let me tag the enemies..if anything i was helping players out lol..but i needed at least 1000 ammo before i got there
---
I wish I had a cap for every time I’ve blown myself up out of reflex panic while being swarmed 
---
What does that have to do with anything? They could have logged every item creation and then figured things out from there. There’s nothing difficult about “show me every player whose inventory increased by x amount over y time” if they had the data.
---
The issue isn’t RefId, it’s that a) they weren’t logging, or weren’t logging enough and b) even if they have logging, some dupe bugs could have circumvented those simply because they were unforeseen parts of the code.
---
On both my lv 103 and my 70 I switch to a weapon I know deals 50-75% health damage to the normal ghouls, if someone else is there, if I'm alone I will try to 1 hit what I can.
---
I don't however do this if there is a turret base sat outside, stop being lazy and do things yourself, if there is a turret I will purposefully pull the ghouls to the front then kill everything quick cause fuck those turret guys.
---
+karma
---
Oh I got to try that. Mine just started to do that and only difference is I'm carrying more variety of armor.
---
I wish we could drop them. I have like 6 fortification key or whatever that key is called at Harper's Ferry
---
Great point, hadn’t taken that into consideration. Maybe just simply making the head shape more egg-like. 
---
I've stayed away from it after doing the majority of the quests it felt like, has there been any new stuff that livens up the game?
---
4 hour session with 1 unresponsive that turned into a disconnect but also had concurrent issues with other services...
---
*in hushed tones* "Could.... could it be... stable?"
---
Frankly. Can't understand why downvoting free stimpacks to was casual player is needed... mind boggles.......
---
Maybe they have voice chat turned off.
---
Well, the obvious fix is go trade/buy a god Gauss and only whip it out to defend yourself from cheaters during PvP. Eat or get Eaten 
---
On man that would be amazing.  
---
For clarification, I do that so that I can run through hitting everything but not killing it, then kite them round with marsupial and/jetpack awhile the others tag 
---
My first computer was a ZX81 with membrane keyboard and a 16K RAMpack that had to be taped on to stop it crashing. Graphics were characters only and there was no sound. I still had a lot of fun and that became my baseline so almost every one of the thousands of games I bought since good or bad has been a better experience.
---
We really are spoilt these days. After an initial moaning session after launch, I realised what an arse I was being and just learnt to enjoy what we have.
---
I'm guessing those who only know AAA games from the last 10 years or so might disagree.
---
It doesn't justify the flop but it's not the worst thing to happen and even no man's sky has made a comeback no one thought it would. It's now everything people wanted and more, but it took them over a year to get there. We just have to give them time if hello games can do it as an indie studio I'm sure Bethesda Austin can.
---
I'm just here to play the game, I don't really care how long it takes them to finish it. Believe me, I play Star Citizen.
---
Hello,
---
You are right, I shouldn't have thought they told me the truth, I guess by that same token I also don't know about how long they were griefing for either. Thanks for the correction man, I will edit the post and remove that portion for accuracy. Thanks for pointing that out to me man.
---
Have a wonderful Valentine's day!
---
Sincerely,

---
My personal favorite check map no one there. Fast travel 3 guys crouching to stay hidden on the map. The ghouls I spawned in all dead. The hunt for legendaries is fun. 
---
Hadn't at the time of my comment. 
---
 There is certainly some stuff that's either gone, or way too tiny numbers are being fed to the RNG.
---
 I want a fucking Jet Pack for my X0-1 and its very rare indeed.
---
Because they are whiny bitches that can’t understand people like you, myself and OP actually enjoy the game. If they hate it, everyone needs to hate it and Bethesda is the Devil....
---
Problem is they removed too little during the purge.. or rather the Great Tickle.
---
Im a bit upset.  I figured at least Bethesda would screw me on Valentines day...
---
No No No, I get you don't need help,I meant share. Oh no, first reply has gone completely the wrong direction of the intent. What have I in leashed? 
---
I had the opposite minus the forever spinning loot. The combat was pretty smooth (no DC) with at least 16 players down at the SQB. But the loot took about 3-5mins for most if the mobs.
---
Why do you think duping is ok?
---
I disagree.
---
Still get a cap in 76
---
I’m lvl 180. Found 2 xo1 jp 1 for me and 1 for a friend. Good luck! 
---
If I load the overseers trunk with stuff will it stay in there til someone else picks it up?
---
The regen happened in fallout 4 as intended, and I believe there was supposed to be a notification for fo76 as was in fo4, but was removed before release.
---
i love this did u ever see it blast the ghouls about 300 feet away?
---
Yup do it all the time
---
I do! Chinese offices sword. Have the electric mod on it as well. If it's something you'd want send me an offer. I've used it a few times and can over repair it for you as well. 
---
I wana say zealots but not 100%
---
Instructions unclear, threw hardrive in washing machine.
---
 I like brick myself. ;)
---
I can verify I've seen this exact thing a few times and it is from extra pieces of regular armor.
---
That is all speculation, based on what’s reflected in this feed. Might be true, might not. Who knows, maybe they were only planning on it working with fallout fans and Beth supporters, and there’s enough of them that they hit their goals. They are continually updating and haven’t abandoned the game, so that’s evidence that there’s enough interest to keep putting money into the game.
---
Could be that there are way fewer players than expected, could be more. 
---
Just a griefer.  They have gotten more numerous now a days.
---
Just perma-block them and change servers. You will never see them again.  I am getting a good collection of names on mine!
---
Ty walkee right by it several times until I see your photo
---
My name is Aaron, I am from Virginia and I'm 38. I'm a maintenance technician for a cable company. I've been playing fallout since fallout 3 and love exploring and wandering aimlessly.  I live pretty close to WV and recognize some of the locations in 76 but I am closer to northern Va and have been to alot of the locations in fo3.
---
This, every time without fail shoot the car behind the tires and watch the whole parking lot go up, while simultaneously fucking up the robobrains or gutsys.
---
Lol you tried to pull the “sources?” bitch move and got served up....that made my day 
---
You can buy whatever gear you want from other players regardless of where it came from, so there's that.
---
im sorry but i love whitespring
---
Awww that's so well said.
---
Would be surprised. If that were the case, we'd have seen tons of pictures (real or fake) of people with huge stacks still.
---
CoNtRoLleD eCoNoMiEs WoRk!
---
Get Mutfruit, corn, tatos, and purified water too
---
With all these ingredients
---
You can make vegetable starch and scrap it for glue
---
No, but there should be.  If I can build a fusion generator, I should be able to build a heat exchanging device to keep my food cold.
---
Yeah, next level twatishness that is. All you can do is heart emote then off to West-tek. 
---
stash increase sweet jesus thank you, i dont remember the last time i could run without power armor
---
It’s so so so annoying
---
If they're functional and don't need them medically, can't they set aside their recreational use so they don't risk losing employment? 
---
I have nothing against voluntary drug users but I understand a company's decision to deter their effects during work.
---
 My other char has one on her level 40 X0-1 and is not upgrading that till she has another. 
---
 I should probably just take my present through the Belly and get an Ultracite set. Probably much easier to get a Jet Pack. ;)
---
Yup, this post is not aimed at you friend, that kind of behavior is what we need to share "loot"
---
Leather, combat or marine? 
---
I mean, in a 2-3 hr session I can produce about 100 diluted with perks...no idea why anybody would be in the market to pay irl money for those 
---
Zelots doesn't affect sb not sure about Hunter
---
ps4?
---
There is a bug confirmed by the CMs which is preventing plans from showing up on vendors.
---
Just wait.
---
1000 caps mainly after a rifle as I’m a rifleman
---
There is a mod for the plasma rifle that surely affects scorchbeasts (that i want to craft but is hard to find flux).
---
dont't know any other mod or legendary prefix that can do it.
---
Is anyone else’s power armour map bar still too far right? Mine seems to be so I will sometimes run past enemies and have to turn around. Small thing but hugely irritating 
---
They weigh .001, the Ui only displays two digits.
---
Until about lvl 50 I was always overweight. Couldn't fast travel. I have learned to be more selective and with EX Armor and perks I Can manage better. 
---
I mainly do this cause I don't like feeling like a dick, plus it's oddly satisfying after the carnage is over when people stop and stare at you, then a second later you get a thumbs up.

But this game still sucks, right? 
---
That isn't what happened at all. I hadn't seen the bethesda announcement and I wanted to know how legit his claim was. Turns out it's an official statement, but it's still dubious at best. The reason people ask for sources isn't because they're bitches, unlike you, it's because they don't want to deal in misinformation, unlike you.
---
Yeah the prime recivers for guns. Not what I was asking but thank you.
---
I’ve been trying to give away Stims, ammo and food to newbies for weeks now, they never have mic’s and they run away as fast as they can when they see me....
---
Complaining about complaining - LMAO😂
---
No, it was in their post maintenance post. 
---
Gotta keep those concurrent players up.
---
You’re right I almost completely forgot about the beer bottles that can’t be broken down too
---
Hahah my pet of choice before snalygaster 
---
He lost his other guns. That stack is the only one that stayed 
---
I just want to set the world on fiiiiiiiirrrre...
---
Nah, even if you truly were being sincere....you know what that looks like...bitches be trippin, it is what is. 
---
Just for the record, this is completely made up
---
You captured my thoughts EXACTLY.  😁👍
---
We all do, just need to tweak the killing so we all get to harvest the corpse. (Hey future employer, this post is the very definition of why you need context for social media)
---
No. I’m not a duper. I’m just upset with the method in which they did it. Allowing the dupers to keep one of each item just means they’ll be able to start duping again right away without the need to try and find those rare items. 
---
If you go back and read though comments I’ve made, I’m in favor of full wipes for players who duplicate items.  I’m a bit of a trader and it hurts the economy. I trade in outfits and plans mostly. I was mortified when I saw someone on XBox selling the Hunter’s Long Coat for 1/10 of what I could even get it for from the vendor bot, let alone the current going rate for them. 
---
Does it still freeze when you load in if you try to move or open the pip boy too soon?
---
Bingo...lol
---
Good idea, my apprentice.
---
[I’m flattered](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am8yat/comment/efkcn6e?st=JS5BW0WS&amp;sh=9b83b529) 
---
 It yet. Maybe. They know we want this, 
---
And it’s a good idea. Perfect for this game 
---
No text chat because then all you would see is "wts this piece of shit item for 50k caps and the soul of your firstborn." Not anyone asks for help or anything it would be clogged with this shit. Or beggers. No thanks
---
Ya, they are totally going to put themselves on blast instead of laughing their asses off in their discord servers.
---
That would have been fine because the texture map and item map are completely different because all the junkless items have to be loaded separately since they have values and can be picked up
---
My only concern is if i unknowingly purchased a duped item from a vendor. I doubt it, but who knows... Other than that, delete away!
---
 I like your ideas
---
I’ve noticed the issue when it’s 2 of the same weapon. I have different versions of a couple guns and whenever I log back in only one stays in place while the other I have to put back in the wheel. 
---
Funny because in 7 Days to Die you get a can anytime you get a canned item. The can is used for either more food crafting or iron/metal.
---
My IGN is Gadzooks24
---
Counter nukes. Yes, you know what, I hate PVP and I’m a casual, but nuke events should be PVP world events. Full on PVP. Keep the robots. Buff them up a little but still
---
hostile then see how the human players react. I wouldn’t wanna do a nuke then. At least not until I have a team. Maybe recruit the other PVP players to a team and nuke together? You don’t have to do what the Enclave tells you to do. Whitespring is 100% Enclave and it gets nuked all the time by players. I mean, who nukes itself all the time? Crazy computers? In any case, tie it to free-for-all world event.
---
Good point.
---
I did the queen and still got spinning loot on bodies, but at least the queen loot appeared.
---
Hopefully your luck will turn around 
---
“nearly dead already”
---
Hmmmm.  
---
Lol. 
---
Wow, you've got it down to a science!
---
Don't forget the Nuka factory. Plenty of cars in that parking lot as well. 
---
It sucks when you aren't even level 50 and you have to sell or scrap the best loot you have received to date because it's too heavy to hold onto while you gain enough levels to use it. 
---
lol you're kinda stupid huh.
---
Or so we're told.
---
You have to have faith.

Sadly I'm off for the night so you can get them tomorrow if you are

Also I been reported for hot mic situations. So mine always off cuz u NVR know who is a snowflake and will report you. Like seriously. Your other people know you online? Didn't think Mennonites use tech.
---
PC. Mostly limb mods (leather, combat armor, and trapper).

Lolz OR MAYBE they could be a griefer.

I dont take candy from strangers,

i tell people going door to door peddling products and services, no thanks,

I delete  email requests from spammers asking me invest my money in their quick get rich schemes..
---
I think if you’re not suspicious of people, you get what you deserve.
---
You expect the dupers to out themselves?  It used to be out in the open, but they’ve been pushed to hiding it now for fear someone will submit a screenshot of their inventory to Bethesda. 
---
This is a good thing. Progressively make it more difficult to dupe and/or easier for the system to detect (since they’ll never eliminate it completely) and the problem will become insignificant. 
---
My big complaint?  This should have been addressed over a month ago. 
---
I'm on PC and it's leather, combat, and trapper that I am currently missing.
---
Yeah, sure buddy. Everyone who wants to know information is a troll.
---
It’s all fun and games until you blow my 3* legendary kill all the way across Appalachia and I can’t find it then I have to follow you back to your camp so I can orbital strike it.

Are there any plans to add customizable character Icons? I know that the atomic shop needs to make money off of Icons, but I feel that everyone would really enjoy an Icon customizations to make there icon match their character. Just a thought, cheers!
---
LOL. I made a killing on the Nuka sales. Worked out great for me. 😁
---
They said plainly even people with duped items got to keep one of each item.  I understand why they approached this with kid gloves (to prevent an abandonment of the trading system altogether), but at the same leaving the dupers with one of each item just means they’ll be able to find a new method and start again. 
---
You're claim seems to be that since only 1% of players are affected, then the impact to the game/economy by those players must be insubstantial, or of such low proportion as to be negligible. But this is a logical fallacy and I can explain. Consider this, the top 1% of America owns more than the bottom 50%, but you would not claim that wealth to be insubstantial simply because only 1% of the populace holds that wealth. Or this: change the average global temperature by 1% and you're causing a wild shift in the climate somewhere. Or this: a bullet hole can account for as little as 1% of your body yet you can still die from it.
---
It is an unsafe assumption that 1% of a volume is incapable of causing problems for the remaining 99%. You must consider the proportionality of what can be affected by the totality of their actions, not merely the fact they are a lower population.
---
Did you lose stacks of duped items today? Is that why you're so angry? 
---
 This is interesting. ;) So Mennonites ... what do you know about them?
---
&gt;I'm not here to argue over what 1% means
---
Yes, you are here to ignore the second part. 
---
Bye.
---
It’s only a witch hunt...if you’re a witch..
---
Lmao I’m an Xbox pleb but I appreciate the offer 
---
Oh, kind of like that real-life religion that's widespread in Europe and runs positively rampant in the Americas (particularly certain 'belts' of the US) that's killed countless nonbelievers, indigenous people, and people of color in the name of their God. And sexually abused children. And been used to justify slavery, wars, lynch mobs, the oppression of women and LGBT+ people, and good old-fashioned genocide. Not saying any names. Lol. 
---
Ah well. I tried!
---
And flag it as a key, so they can never drop it.
---
That is indeed quite a loss.  
---
can't loot the queen or anything i kill around her. still
---
L-O-L, Ok, I’m done. Thanks for the good time, it was great! 
---
Yeah, nearly whole thing. It is kinda sad if you believe majority of it.
---
What got fixed?
---
It is good to see the amount of people that enjoy the game commenting on these threads lately. 
---
Ahh bummer I'm on Xbox. Yeah the last patch goofed up the vendor list can't rememberer if it's going to be fixed next patch 
---
They did something with servers?
---
I had issues connecting, and I crashed within two minutes of login. So... Initial estimate of stability is not great.
---
Haha. The body count is much higher for the one I am referring to and they are still preaching violence unlike the one I believe you are referencing. Nice try though.
---
"Don't be a dick", A much more concise and clear message for the Club House User Massacre (CHUM) etiquette. Thank-you.
---
Yeah you can only repair it to 100% it doesn’t benefit from the perk card 
---
I really doubt 1% of players duped lol they gotta make another sweep cuz I still have some duped items I don’t mind losing them tho 
---
Here is a fun build I wanted to try:
---
Pyrolyzer suppression tank
---
Wait until 50 to complete tracking unknowns, get yourself a pyrolyzer that is level 50, which reduces incoming damage
---
Get whatever heavy guns perks you want, but for sure get Bullet Shield, Barbarian and Blocker
---
Fireproof is amazing after the buff, must pick for any build
---
Suppressor, Lone Wanderer if solo, Bodyguards and Inspirational if not
---
Junk shield is amazing, I use it on every build
---
Spam your flamer and take no damage
---
The amount of downright obnoxious people on this forum is staggering. Fortunately the in-game community is, for the most part, nice.
---
I got blown up by a Mr Farmhand one time.  Serious tip:  if you hear beeping, run!
---
I’ve saved all of my notes :) I just store the ones I’ve read in my stash.
---
I carry all the poems with me though.
---
Bless you for helping lowbies..
---
Ah, I hadn't read anything official about it, just heard it mentioned so I had no idea what the whole deal was.
---
You’re free to retake Virginia. IDGAF.  We split off from them 156 years ago. 
---
What?
---
I’d like a quest where we can turn in multiple burnt books or magazines for readable books &amp; mags.
---
k bye
---
About the same. I've also stolen from dead dupers.
---
I'm afraid that stuff will be flagged too
---
Huh...worth looking into. 
---
Dwight?
---
Eight hundred
---
Downvote people! It's so important that this "community" come together to act the way this guy thinks we should in order to support a business that has failed to deliver a functional product. Vapid proclamations that his view is the correct view is the only way to move forward. 
---
I've noticed this exact same thing only when I have multiples of the same weapon in my wheel...good ole super sledge
---
It was an update on Valseek’s forum post they had up before the maintenance.  Also said they only looked for duped Nuka-Cola in inventories that were flagged for other duped items, which to me is non-sensical as it’s probably the most duped item in the game (used as a way to max caps, since drinking one gives a cap). 
---
I actually have experience with clearing exploited items from a database funny enough. 
---
Anyways there are various red flags that point to this being the case. The fact when you crafted weapons prior they all stacked on top of each other until they were tracked by durability loss is a good indication.
---
No.  
---
The number of reasons why people don't want to use voice chat are massive, from "I don't have a mic and I'm not buying one for this fucking game". To "My primary language isn't english and I don't want to be made fun of" to "I'm a girl and I don't want to be sexually harassed", to "I just don't want to fucking talk to you, asshat". 
---
So far I have been running around as soon as I can while server hopping. No lock ups. 
---
Don't what me dude.
---
Your above comment is not the comment I responded to when I cited the laws that refuted your claim that it is not illegal to buy stolen shit from a yard sale.
---
9 inches
---
Subscribed.
---
I'm still waiting for duping yo be addressed. I'm now 2 months FO76 free.
---
Seriously though, checkout **Apex Legends**. Wow, what a good game (and free!!!)
---
They should use their new-found duplicate item detection abilities to delete all but 1 copy of any key or holotape in *everyone*'s inventory, then make it so if you try to pick one up that you already have it just says "You already have this item."
---
So Bethesda has consistently lied to and scammed their consumers, made the game more buggy and grindy with every patch, left in legacy bugs from their singleplayer games in a MULTIPLAYER game, and updates the micro transaction shop more than the actual game. Now that they fixed ONE thing (which shouldn’t have been a problem in the first place!) without fucking everyone over again, you guys are praising them. Crazy.
---
I made almost a grand with ebay man.... It was pretty cool
---
But they did things! They said so!
---
Then they didn’t complete the job. You cannot leave any cancer cell behind. All must be purged. 
---
Hey everybody downvote this guy because he's actually attempting to play the game actively instead of as a passive ragdoll.
---
No proof though, no contesting claims. But that's okay. 
---
Pack it in readers, u/Puck_2016 has completely shut down my post with his/her/them/it/xer profound insight. 
---
while I don't give them out free, I do a reasonable business selling them. I think cost really depends on the platform. But the thing is this -- I'm not going to be selling them much longer because caps are kind of useless at this point.
---
Yes I have a ghoul slayer death claw gauntlet, MIRV, 44 and sledgehammer. Categoricshoe47 
---
Bases out back the gods demand be destroyed. (It's what rp i have come up with) lol fuck them guys.
---
"We searched your bag. Jesus. We're not judging, but go slow and use a lot of lube."
---
Oh wait... That was sarcasm
---
It's almost amusing that you believe that.
---
How does that not make sense to you though? The people putting hundreds of hours into a game complain about stuff that is broken or non-existent like end game content. These people including myself have had enough gameplay to know what to and what not to complain about, or is reasonable to complain about. We all paid for the game so for things to be broken or not there is reasonable to complain about.
---
What do you expect then? People who had a handful of hours to complain about everything without giving the game a real go? "I have 3 hours in the game and I'm quitting because of x, y, and z" meanwhile that isn't enough time played to truly know if the problem is x, y and z and that there are more problems than that. It's similar to buying and FPS game and not playing it because the first mission is boring. What about the rest of the missions you didn't give a chance?
---
I have 300+ hours and I complain because I've given the game enough of a chance to be good. It's not terrible, but it isn't great either
---
Agree and its worse on the fallout sub. I love this game even with its faults.
---
I see this all the time on/near the railway just South of Whitesprings
---
Yes. Multiple chained explosions are fun. 
---
You guys act like everything they are doing wasnt asked for from day 1. We arent competing against each other, we are dealing with being sold a product that had qualities below expectation.
---
Im not going to jump over the moon after working 12 hours today and seeing this. Its more a meh moment. I put my money into this already. I like a lot of it, the concept most of all. Id rather have had no tease of a hidden itch though. 
---
Maybe its like Douglas Adams said though," in the beginning, god created the universe. Many have since consideeed this a bad move."
---
Thanks for sharing
---
They weren’t bitching, fanboy, they just aren’t impressed that Bethesda fixed one bug which should’ve been ironed out in QA testing. Shit, it should’ve been ironed out before since it’s been in every game they’ve released on this engine haha
---
They really should bring the blackbird, or an equivalent. 
---
I think it was important that they addressed it so that it did not undermine what they had in the future, which is a very valid concern.
---
Ah it was just with them saying how boring it is. Seems like they didn't enjoy it. 
---
Couldn’t just dress in rags and go around preaching about the holy glow and the glory of Atom?  
---

---
I actually found the plans at the Watoga vendor the day before patch 5. I can't tell you how many times I checked prior to that. 
---
This is actually where a lot of fun comes from. Helping out low level players reminds us of how far we've come! I like to drop them stims, radaway and purified water at least.
---
Also, you'd fit in perfectly on r/fo76filthycasuals btw.
---
I like to use my Tesla for all of the mobs (golf club, Uranium Fever, etc.).  I end up tagging enemies in groups and then if somebody jumps in for a kill, I still get my loot.   
---
IIRC, Watoga Train Station/Vendor Bot Phoenix and Harper's Ferry.  
---
Meh, was hoping this would be fixed today.
---
I’m guessing you didn’t get good weapons and armor while the getting was good. Otherwise you wouldn’t be poo pooing right now
---
I have seen this too think it's a random encounter
---
Best I've got so far is a furious lever action with +50% crit damage and +1P
---
The juxtaposition of this sub community being toxic yet supporting the ousting of toxicity is bizarre 
---
I thought of twister when this happened to me
---
even if it takes fucking their shit up.
---
See that’s something you just don’t hear in Zone Chat
---
Yeah but that costs 1700-2500
---
Yep.
---
Apparently a lot of people are thinking this - bagged 3 bountys in an hour XD
---
Yep. Having just one would slow down the process.  Doing it the way they did was foolish if there’s not a system in place to detect future duping and deal with the people doing it. They only seeded the dupers next round. 
---
Please do not commit corvidicide as penance. The crows did nothing wrong. 
---
Oh, really? Makes sense I guess.
---
But I know that it said "0" as the weight a few days ago, too, before the patch went into effect... was the bobby pin weight fixed before today?
---
I had a perpetual loading screen on fast-travel post server change. Some continuing crafting-&gt;controls have been disabled issues post server change. No disconnects that reset my inventory so far, which I hope is gone, though it was very uncommon for me.
---
No crashes out of the application so far, but I've gone a couple days without crashes before so that's not saying much.
---
Agree to disagree then. Personally I've kept signs in my stash specifically for the novelty, and if they were strong enough to defeat &lt;LV50 enemies, I'd use them for exploring west of the savage divide. 
---
I’m out of the loop here, did they fix the game yet? 
---
Yes, weeks ago in a hotfix that broke a lot more than Bobby pins weighing .01 and that is still in place today.
---
If there's one thing Bethesda has made abundantly clear, it's that they are completely incompetent and don't have anybody remaining on the FO76 team that gives a single shit about it or ^probably has ever even played a video game casually in their life.  
---
Vendor bot Phoenix ? 
---
It's the only place to "find" them.  The only other way I'm aware of is farming workshop defenses, but I'd be happy to be proved wrong.  I have several characters that still need them.
---
Pete Hines said at PAX Aus that because they are privately held they can make the games they want to make without being controlled by investors. Internally they obviously have budgets and financial goals, but they're not beholden to them or required to cook the books to impress the market
---
I wouldn't put any faith in counting players by trophy/achievements. I can't tell you how many times I've logged into my Xbox and gotten notifications about finally getting achievements from games I played a month before.
---
I think theres a random chance from any workshop event
---
Bask in the glory of Ziggy Montenegro and is fabuloso thunder thighs over there

It might just be me but perhaps the update today did something. 
---
I just got to the location today, I do not get a prompt. I thought maybe because of an event so I hopped servers and still no luck.
---
Right, that's what I mean, though... I thought the last patch, which "fixed" a bunch of stuff, also reverted the bobby pin fix from before. 
---
Whatever, I guess, so long as it's fixed now :)
---
"how fucking dare you want a forced multi-player game to have some sort of standards"
---
Like my wife always says, “That was terrible”
---
I find this pretty amusing given that were you here around a month ago this was the Bethesda defence force, after people got fed up, people got fed up of people getting fed up.
---
I think people have put forward valid criticism, are you implying that people shouldn't have complained about the duping? About making the game more tedious by nerfing crafting perks? About game-breaking bugs? About PvP being unbalanced? About scorchbeasts costing more to kill than they give back? About duffle kerfuffles?
---
I mean I can agree on the sentiment that people have a lot to say about the game, but I think their complaints are jsutified.
---
That was the patch before last.
---
I know, it's hard to keep track.
---
You can go find random nonsense on the internet and argue againts it if you find it meaningful. I don't.
---
They may of replaced the Hamster with a Mole Rat!
---
I always need aluminum lol
---
It would've been great but it wasn't feasible. They had hundreds of thousands of people logging on at the same time, breaking the game and showing what needed to be fixed
---
The initial load into the world load times for me is almost cut in half since the maintenance 
---
Moved on to Kingdom Hearts, then next week once i finish that: Anthem
---
Well, if there were thousands of entries culled by deleting duped items, this could contribute to better game-wide performance.
---
I seriously do not understand it. I guess if they’re playing a Raider or whatever but that’s just not what I want out of this game. I understand that I represent not even a fraction of a percent of the community but it seems to me that there are quite a few people that feel the same way. It doesn’t ruin the game for me but it certainly makes it less enjoyable. 
---
No not just you. They could have done some tweaking, but my guess is removing all those items had a freeing effect on the server resources.
---
Goulish and Healing Factor pretty much negate needing more than a dozen stimpacks, and those dozen are only for the emergency oh shit moments.
---
3 Star mole rat at that
---
Havibg taken many, many, many....many many workshops, and defended, retaken 4x as many, I have never seen metal anything plans, 50% of the time it's some small thing I all ready have like decor items.
---
And I'm fairly certain you can find them in the world, it's buy or nothing, or get someone who has all ready got them and give them the steel to make you loads  in your camp. 
---
If.you store them you can still place them even if you can't craft any new ones.
---
If you are on PC I'm happy to help, think each wall is either 4 or 6 steel each. 
---
Yupp, go back to selling your dupped goods on the marketplace.
---
Or better yet being able to tag something with being read/listened to or not
---
Thank RNJesus!
---
That has helped, no doubt. But there's no way there were that many dupes on every single server, right? This difference is night and day.
---
My goodness thank you for posting this suggestion. This sub was getting too much for me in the negativity department. Especially for someone who disagrees with that method of approach. Subscribed!
---
Nope, only melee
---
Yeah, I agree with most point, except #5. It's their own doing.
---
Someone said the other day that after server downtime servers run good, but after a few days or so, and after nuke launches performance deteriorates. So it could just be the freshly restarted servers. Or maybe stability is better. Who knows until maybe a few days or a week to see how it goes.
---
I could be wrong but didn't they say they were updating the servers to fix the disconnect issues 
---
Get that dense mod on your chest piece.  Will change your life.
---
My golf membership runs out at the end of the month if that helps you out.
---
Can you guys please start posting ALL changes?  Not just picking and choosing what you want to share with us?  It's kind of annoying to have to rely on a third party, for that kind of information.   
---
They posted a server side upgrade with the maintenance today. I think it got lost in the doping drama. Stability and performance from what it said.
---
You're not wrong.
---
While not gone, I haven’t had it happen to me at all in a dozen server hops where I run as soon as I can.  Before I had to wait or it was guaranteed to happen.  
---
Definitely better. 
---
Wow, you got your future employer on that one!
---
I shat my pants after a nice bit of Listeria from Myrtle Beach and put those over my beer, they didn’t search my bag
---
Yeah, they can RP whatever they want...but when that affects someone else’s joy in the game, I don’t care what their troll ass has decided they want to “play”...leave the newbies alone, if you’re not gonna help, ignore them. Lawd, I hate Cheeto fingered griefers, would slap IRL.
---
sure, but I developed my love of exploding cars from FO4 while flying in the vertibird and hitting them with the minigun.  
---
Todd Howard: NO. NEVER. BAN HIM.
---
I’ve already decided I will never log onto that server, sounds absolutely awful. Not today, Satan. 
---
Feels like a little too late, so many great games coming in the next few weeks and months.  
---
Server-side only. No patch to be downloaded. If the servers are online, you're good to go.
---
next week is the patch.
---
I believe hunter no
---
My wife and I have been mostly having fun since beta.  Fun is where and how you find it, not how other people tell you it should be.
---
Ya know, I’ve been slapped plenty of times, I stay packing a god Gauss, could waste half the server fairly easily in PvP if I wanted to be a bitch...I just throw up the Heart and go about my business.
---
Anyone remember the e3 footage of the mole rat? How different it looked?...funny how the creature models were never talked about.
---
Most of the people now playing the games are the dupers.  Most everyone moved on
---
What's the limit going to? 
---
I love the posts that complain about complainers.   Just unsub and move on.  No need to be all dramatic about it.  
---
&gt;  To the rest of you, just because you can bitch and moan, doesn’t mean you should.
---
Indeed...
---
crippling robots increases the chance of them self destructing, legendary protectrons are very likely to explode. sentry bots always self destruct
---
I’ve thought about farming non PA armor now, but my neurotic hoarding ass would be constantly over encumbered without my X-01 strength mods 
---
Yeah well done for waiting months after release to have a decent update. Jk fuck Bethesda I’m never buying one of their trash games again. They should’ve just sold the rights of Fallout to Obsidian when they had the chance. I know that’s not actually realistic but still fuck BGS for think this shit was good idea just to make ya wait longer for their next outdated release
---
(PS4)
---
I only got stuck on a loading screen once in a 3hr session tonight, the only performance issue I encountered.  I don't remember having any screen freezes.
---
Fair enough. At launch though, there were some big bugs and crashes. That ruined a lot of the fun for us, at the time.
---
That's great, I was just able to log in an check and I didn't lose anything either. :D I was getting ready to start farming Whitespring. Lol.
---
800
---
For me, I just don't trust anyone offering trade, no offense to the legit people that want to. Too many griefers have tried this with me
---
I have a bloodied Grognaxe with power attack damage. What are you looking to spend?
---
Previously I had to log out to fix it. Now, I’ve found as long as you don’t push any other buttons after pushing b the pip will load shortly
---
It definitely is more stable since launch.  I played \~4 hours today with only one disconnect, but that was more my ISP than a game issue.  Others are reporting more stability as well.
---
Thanks for the response. I would say the post is still very helpful, as I modeled my entire build off of it, and I feel very powerful in game. I'll stick to the +25% damage drug (psycho or psychostat?  I forget) for now then, and look forward to any future guides you make!
---
i've been able to drop only 3 explosive items in 2 months play..
---
the first one was at lvl 90(i was in a team with a lvl 200) the other 2 weapons(both miniguns) came few days ago at lvl 180; TSE was a very rare and deadly combination that needed high lvl and some hard luck to drop... thats all
---
Well, it's a start
---
Xbox ?
---
What, you don’t like Bumblebee, bro?!
---
That is good to hear. I will reinstall it and see how it is. Thank you. =)
---
Oh sorry I’m on PS4 forgot to add that
---
Or a rad rat
---
Which events? Did you receive from the event completion or an enemy while doing the event?
---
Pm me tomorrow, I can sell you the combat limbs plan.
---
*Disregarding all the hours of volunteering work you do with orphaned kittens and goat children in an undeveloped country*
---
Lol, I loved this, especially the 'goat children'. :)
---
Best thread this week!
---
I was going to take screenshots of my inventory and stash last night before I logged off, and compare to when I logged on this aft, but I forgot, and to be honest I didn't expect to have much change show up in my stuff at all.
---
I played today for about 4 hours, took a few workshops, went on one or two events (including one nuking/SBQ fight, the first of three such things the same player initiated in a row) and there was very little if any lag. The moment the SBQ hit the ground, her inventory/loot was visible, no arrows chasing their tails for minutes on end. I don't know how much of the above is from "the purge", or naturally improved performance from restarting the servers (just like rebooting your PC).
---
The only issue I had today was I accidentally scrapped the BOS bomber jacket I'd been sporting for weeks as my default outfit, and couldn't craft it (it was I think a reward for finishing the MODUS questline). So I used some of my piled-up atoms to get the in-store bomber jacket, which looks slightly better anyway.
---
16 times the detail 
---
Until then I’m rocking the Camo Paint with the Patriot Red Helm...about the most intimidating combo I can come up with until they launch something worth buying. 
---
People need to chill. I know this game ain't perfect but that doesn't mean you have to bitch about it every single day. This sub is getting out of hand and i honestly don't understand why devs even bother communicating with people here. I've come to a point where I hope beth don't think of this sub as a representation of entire playerbase. Cause that's just too sad
---
Take your upvote and shoot at someone's CAMP (but only for another week).
---
More initialisms for everything you can think of please. CHUM and WANG will remain in my heart forever.
---
I mostly play solo and when I get ahead of the spawns at WS and announce for everyone in mic range there's a three star and proceed to "kite" a dozen freaking zombies all over creation trying to be polite and literally no one gives a shit well... At least I know I'm being a big WANG for any CHUMs that might be nearby.
---
PC player perchance?
---
Well, I do now
---
I went ahead and farmed it anyway. I found a Furious walking cane and a troubleshooters leather arm in just over an hr of server hopping. 
---
This is a really cool idea. Especially with the scarecrow lore. Too bad you’re on a poverty system or I’d join.
---
I'm excited to see how it looks after the patch thank you for you're honesty, these ITV make me have hope for the game in the future
---
Not in the least 
---
Is it only 1*?
---
Lmao I agree, I’d change the yellow too. 
---
This!
---
Extra stash space coming, so you can be free for like two hours.  I for one can’t wait to cram that new storage space with junk I don’t need cause I’m a hoarder and have a problem.
---
So you bought a game but didn't play it because "you read things"....now you are asking strangers if you should play.
---
Permission granted. I really do not believe your post. Did Felicia put you up to this?
---
Nada I have noticed. But I'm a wormholer...  we are weird anyway and dont keep up on things lol.
---
You are thinking of amish. 
---
It's the scorched killer mod.
---
Same deal.
---
'Cheat or get cheaten...?'
---
Shouldn’t they have degraded already. 
---
if stuff didn't break so fast, we wouldn't have to carry 2 or 3 duplicates.  I lug three gats everywhere.  Sometimes break them all (queen).
---
Yeah
---
Lmao I literally just told my buddy, I’ll have that extra 200 filled in under an hour and be right back in the same situation again. I have a mini panic attack every time I have to sell/part with my collection...facepalm 
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
I have a toolbox
---
Thats awesome ! very nice of you to share!!
---
sorry.  on PC here.
---
I suppose that works too lmao...I’d do what it takes vs getting one shot every time some jackass gets bored 
---
A Footlocker*
---
Sadly, not to many takers if it's only 1*.  Would be better off selling it to a vendor.
---
I literally fixed a mistyped word. You must be confused I never said anything about a yard sale LOL.
---
Okay thanks
---
Np
---
Actual origin of the Scorched is that they were all dangerously fast speed readers, and the rest is history.
---
Disappointed mostly... Everyone I played with had some piece of gear that they would reluctantly admit was likely duped, all of them had some TSE main weapon, and every single person quit due to the game being 'too easy' or 'they nerfed meh TSE' and I don't have the drive to make new friends and hope against hope that they use legit shit.  Shame but oh well.
---
The duper ban wave and item removal are great, but will Bethesda actually deliver new/locked content already?  
---
You too? Lmao such a pain in the ass.
---
This topic sure didn't age well. 
---
No worries, I'll be around at about 2pm EST tomorrow.
---
It'll give me more space for farmed fusion cores from Poseidon anyway.
---
Fool!  Then how will get Skyrim on our microwave.
---
Isn't that because they are the crafting material for molotovs?
---
I stopped playing it due to the bugs and crashes, then read all of the issues with the game. My wife and I decided that we were going to wait 3 to 6 months and see if they fixed the game.
---
Yes, I am asking if the game that has been criticized by literally thousands of people for being a broken mess, is now fixed and fun to play.
---
Is it really that hard to believe?
---
How much man?
---
i have had a similar issue start showing up with i got a second .50 cal off of a random drop. it will remove my old one from the quick wheel in favor of the new one. even if the old one is the one i use more often
---
I'm on PC and don't experience these issues. 
---
Man, usually that was a crashing mistake. It’s gonna take some time to not attempt it I’ve tried not doing it for so long. 
---
[200 stash](https://imgflip.com/i/2tqbta) 
---
Nice, I have the xmas lights, so think I will skip these, but they look cool
---
If I could upvote this comment again i would
---
The military one right? You confused me changing it from toolbox to footlocker 
---
It doesnt matter to me
---
I could have sworn in FO4 they could be scrapped for cloth or something. Not sure why they didn't do that.
---
It's the green small one
---
I think it’s just legendary weapon stacks right now, but don’t quote me on that. And how likely is it to have multiples of the exact same legendary, including its secondary *’s? At least I assume they need to be identical in order to stack. It sounds like they are just reducing stacked legendary items to 1 item. Kinda like the bug with power armor, where if you put a stack of cores in it, then enter and exit it, there is only one core and the others are missing. 
---
Ah okay, 250 good enough? 
---
It’s my endgame. 
---
Fly up to the top of the White Spring (jet pack) with 60-70 mini-nukes, daisycutter (modded back to single shot), and lots of ammo for other weapons. 
---
Plink - BOOOOOOM. 
---
So entertaining. 
---
Roses are rad, violets are glowing, once the bomb drops a strange wind thar be blowing.
---
Its gonna be in wall decor probably the same slot as the nuka quantum and beer signs. You have to scroll to the right. 
---
No.
---
50 caps. Final offer
---
lol, that is what i thought too.  started up the game as soon as maint. was finished.  1st thing i checked was stash limit.  it said 600.  i was like, "WTFFFFFFFFFFF????!!!!!'  where is my 200 extra stash!!  goddamn it!  beth fucked up again!!
---
then........
---
DOH!!
---
it comes next week i read
---
Damn, guess I’ll have to take that offer.
---
All I've seen here on the first page lately was about people bitching and how they are quitting the game or asking beth for some ridiculous changes in game so on and on. I am fed up litally
---
Nice, did you do .12? 
---
You're a little off. Average person does a mile in 2000 steps. So a 1000 miles would be 2 million steps. So 1,999,999 to go 😁
---
Well it would of been ok if they gave us 200lbs, then 2 weeks later, they gave us another 200lbs, but we have waited over 2 months for 200lbs, they can literally go fuck themselves ..
---
You drive a hard bargain. Alright 30
---
Actually good point. Why doesn't it just give you a can after you eat it, like the NukaCola gives you a cap
---
That sums it up perfectly, I tell myself I’m reserving it for a full armor set (which would give me something fun to do since I run around aimlessly at this point) but in reality, it’ll be 500 or so more chems I’ll never need....
---
With two heads maybe they are both a male and female.  Yeah, I was thinking that too.  An asexual reproduction.  Maybe all the udders are not udders?
---
Hold on let me call a buddy of mine who’s an expert on military footlockers 
---
I'm gonna start farming when my low level friend gets online. That way at least he'll have a chance at getting something good, too... hopefully good. 
---
You did find an end game weapon, probably. You were just too blinded by the power of the actual OP weapons. The only real positive things dupers did was make specific legendaries accessible to certain builds
---
PS4, lvl 99 ( goal hit lvl 100 ) find the perfect location to build my house ( narrowed it down to two locations ) use all my junk items 600 ibs worth to make items to break down and learn mods, retire from the game wait a few months for more content.
---
They can be, you just have to do it manually
---
LOL
---
Ya I bet.
---
That makes sense :)
---
I assumed it was something like that, but they did mention Nuka-Colas as well so I wasnt sure if they would be targeting other rare MATs too.
---
I scrolled right on every one of them and I still can't find it, should i verify my game files?
---
A bloody mess. 
---
30 caps it is 
---
Only, we paid for a product that has failed to deliver. Your analogy is bullshit.
---
On nvm it's in lights 
---
Nice ! it looks way better with the new lighting effects.
---
Ohh, feedback. Can I suggest something about food and drinks since it has been talked about a lot? Maybe change "Good with Salt" to affect the durability of crafted food and drink consumables up to 200% (easier to implement than a fridge I guess).
---
Lol... just wow...
---
Try zenimax online studios.  Entirely different development from bethesda.  Way to fact check.
---
Deal
---
Thank you though!
---
It depends I think. If every TSE gun is exactly the same, same mods, level, etc it will still be the same as steel ie "ID" followed by "value/amount." What makes it have a different ID, is the mods on it. At least as far as I know. I'm pretty sure it has a second ID based on mods so it'll be like "weapon ID" then "Mod ID" then "value/amount". I'm not 100% sure on how weapon IDs work so I could be wrong
---
Mind travelling to me when I join your session? I’m extremely overweight 
---
PSN is Grizzly_Joker_99
---
Why not just have loadouts and copy Call of Duty then? It's not just another online game. It's still a Fallout game. 
---
1st thing i did when they changed the vendor bot's inventory, was buy up all the floor plans.
---
since then, i have received 1 Barn floor plan.  you might be up for a long wait if you refuse to buy them.
---
Just fucking don't, it's buggy as shit at the moment. Agros everyone who comes by your camp, including people on your team, does damage to your camp, cannot be killed, and takes up budget even if it is killed.   
---
Idea's awesome, execution is fucking garbage. 
---
Then leave?
---
YTho? Lol why can’t we just have both like the ridiculous, expressive  wastelanders we all end up being
---
Ok I'll add you
---
I don't remember posting this!
---
People need to go outside or stop playing games that make them that butthurt 
---
Good to know guess I’ll have to start saving up then, thanks!
---
&gt;Bethesda is trying to fix this game
---
You sure about that?
---
I meant that for keys and such that stck up. sorry, was not clear
---
Hold on my PS4 is being annoying. It ejected my disk lol
---
I have 5 1* gauss rifles and I can’t get rid of them.
---
I enjoy few games, I really struggle to move onto other games, Fallout is just one of those games I enjoy a lot, it helps me waste time. I mainly login and just try get my challenges done and it depends if I am in the mood to do anything else.
---
I can vouch for that, had to start a new character and level up to 10 to finish getting all the achievements I missed
---
Isn’t this a perfect Atom Store thing? It’s purely cosmetic and doesn’t effect gameplay at all, and in game its a status symbol as you display all of your collected items? 
---
No worries just loading in anyways 
---
Given the fact that the game's crashed on me twice today, connectivity is still a problem. Bugs are still a huge issue.  I wouldn't say this is a "finished product" But yes, it's further from the late alpha state it launched in. 
---
This is wrong. What I had above was how calculating ingame world items worked. If you had 1 or 10,000 scrap, it shows one item. But one or many of the same gun showed multiple even if it was different. Even if had the same endurance or damage or whatever, that's what made each one unique. They all go off that health bar from weapons and even if they all have the same health bar, they are different because they degrade differently. 
---
Sadly I’m on Xbox thank you for the offer on helping, and also thank you for saving my time in searching all over.
---
Awsome!
---
Get off my lawn!
---
Nerf-pocalypse hurt mine in a real way lol I’m not surprised.....
---
doh!
---
Preach.
---
I found a 3* grognak axe once that had some junk blocking perk. I wasn’t about to completely re-spec my character to conform to that one weapon after I spent hrs and hrs making a rifle build. But yes, you would be correct. That would be considered an end game weapon. Just not a very good one and completely wrong for me.
---
I'm the stubborn ass that refused to trade for anything after duping was public.  Just sad that all my peeps quit playing because the TSE shit made the game 'too easy'... or after when the TSE nerf made the game 'too hard'... fucking people.  lol.
---
Yeah but to the theory’s credit, there is a cthonic monster sleeping in a cave as we speak lol
---
A complaint about complaints. This is complaintception.  
---
Yo dawg i heard you liked complaints, so your complaining while there complaining so you can complain while your complaining. 
---
  
---
That's fine. I play by the rules. I'm just happy they didn't overkill 
---
Yeah, and hopefully when they feel confident theyve eradicated duping, they will start letting 4 and 5 star legendaries out into the wild. 
---
“Man, this new strain of cow sure does produce high-protein milk!”
---
Yes hopefully they can figure all this duping stuff out
---
People only want to vilify duping, when really most people just want to enjoy the game without spending 100000 hours being frustrated by crap weapons. 
---
I have to agree, the god Gauss I paid 2k caps for back in January did make the game awfully easy...but, you still have to make the choice to use it. If you’re losing interest bc it’s too easy, unequip the damn thing. One shotting a Mirelurk Queen sometimes just for the hell of it was very fun....I admit thy freely
---
Sure but trade is a feature of this game, you could have traded it for a rifle. In fact without duping that would have been pretty highly sought after. Especially with a scarcity of ammo from no duping people would kill for a 3 star Grog
---
A simple test server would’ve solved 90% of the problems at launch. Heck, if they had a real beta instead of a server stress test disguised as a beta 90% of the problems would’ve been fixed.
---
There is a shopping complex that you can take out a whole parking lot with a chain reaction by shooting one car specifically. Its greatness
---
Flowers are brutt
---
I want to eat your butt
---
...but you can just do that with discord and forums and PS4 communities.
---
There are a few BoS clans they've even done 12v12.
---
I sort of despise your type of player where if it isn't spoon fed to you you feel this need to whine @ Bethesda and you're too anxious to post your contact info / schedule and make it happen.
---
No one does team workshops so why would they program more code.
---
Doing that would hurt a lot of players who I. Good confidence traded a lot of their stuff for a duped item. 
---
Most of the duped items weren’t in circulation. 
---
They were in duper’s inventories still waiting to be traded. Those got shot. 
---
If you had a single specimen of a duped item, you’d get to keep it. 
---
Bethesda did this right. 
---
lol, did you take a picture of your monitor, instead of a screen shot?
---
My advice is do not play in pacifist mode and realize that a combat knife from a crouched position, is the best weapon, until you level up. So called griefers assume low levels play pacifist. I had 2 higher levels (80 and 17) track me when I was level 6. As soon as one of them damaged me, I got a couple of rifle shots in and then knifed the lower level of the two from a crouched position (double damage) with my combat knife. Guess he was expecting some delay while I fumbled around with engaging PvP. Watched him die and fast traveled away as he rejoined for revenge, exited the server.  
---
Nice twister ref
---
Yup
---
Same here. All this talk is making me wish I had bought a duped gun last night during the fire sale
---
Add 10 "passive" slots which you can unlock after 50 in lieu of swapping a point or taking a perk and now items go to level 60 yay
---
Man I was on youtube earlier and some guy was angry-community posting "SEE? I ONLY LOST TWO GUNS, MY GEARS NOT DUPED" and...my only reaction was "are you completely illiterate?" 
---
My friend duped an item
---
Now after the patch
---
Bethesda will fight 'em
---
I give a shit, just putting it out there. 
---
Yup. In Watoga, I’ll quickly loot and then run. I’ve had a few instances where I stopped to look at what legendary dropped and was greeted with a kaboom. 
---
Yes... White Springs and Camden Park. Its almost a ritual every time I get on. 
---
this may help you.
---
WARNING!!!!  MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!!!
---
[https://fo76map.com/](https://fo76map.com/)
---
I forgot about health and all that since this they brought it back and didn't take that back into account, sorry about that
---
Your “a lot” is several TSE’s or unyielding/sentinel pieces. 
---
Their “a lot” was a guy with 10,000 of them on his mule. 
---
They’re after him, not you and your dupes. 
---
They absolutely were duped, you're just illiterate or never bothered reading the announcements. 
---
So many actual end-game weapons were thrown away by people hell bent on finding TSE's or whatever the OP broken thing is now. If you are truly 190+ and haven't found a endgame weapon is cause you grinding XP without grinding gear (not the same thing) or have such "bad luck" you are an old meme.
---
Endgame dosn't mean the most OP thing possible, and if my MMO days taught me anything nobody should have true-BiS (Best in Slot) gear without MONTHS of grinding, and a good game is adding new content before 95% of the player base is true-BiS
---
As someone who has been interested in the game but hasn’t played it, what do they do that people consider griefing ? I thought most all PvP was in the form of some weird duel format that you have to accept.
---
Quiet, child. 
---
"I've been trying for hours but I just don't think a pickaxe cuts down trees."
---
The thing is even if they add a unique identifier a duper could still spread them all over, then who gets flagged? the original guy that looted it? the duper? the people it was passed along too? all of the above?  All this would do is lead to more "don't trade with other players" mentality and add to it, "don't buy from vendors", "don't pick up things from containers" etc etc...And lets not forget the game bugs that dupe things with 0 intent to do so from the player, what do they about those? ban people because they experienced a game bug?
---
If they lose all means the will self destruct. Pretty funny when doing it fast to alot of robots. 
---
I love this idea, but Devil's Advocate for a moment: Bethesda would then have to increase difficulty of all enemies as well, right? Higher level weapons/armor would only be valuable (and thus devalue all the duped copies of current best weapons) if they did/resisted more damage. To keep game 'balanced' according to the current scheme, stronger weapons and armor would have to encounter harder enemies. But this also would be a great thing IMO, as even with post-nerf weapons I feel the enemies do not put up much of a fight. So yes - higher level weapons accompanied by tougher enemies sounds GREAT! 
---
Pretty sure you can only do Intiate right now.
---
I do this everytime at Uranium Fever. Its Fallout etiquette 101. 
---
see ya later alligator enjoy whatever it is your into lol :)
---
But if it's not a solution that can be implemented, if it's genuinely * beyond them* then is it really a solution? 
---
I just got into farming and trading armor. The dupers are mostly duping assassins/unyielding+sentinel/cavalier
---
An entire car? 2 screws, 2 steel, 2 rubber.

I wouldn't put faith in ignoring hard data because it says something you don't like (that this game is a failure)

nice paint job.  i do a lot of painting and air brushing.
---
Reminds me of something I did today.  Ran an AWOL Armaments, only to for the final gutsy to drop me a flare gun.  Just stood there and let the explosion kill me lol.
---
I trade and have a decent trade list. I don’t dupe, and nothing I do results in having multiple similar legendary items. 
---
**None** of my list was affected.
---
Literally unplayable.

I’ll give more than a vendor in the XB1.  Categoricshoe47

Reddit likes to complain for karma, and this sub is no different. I'd guild you if I had any money.
---
I use my artillery cannon to start the chaos.
---
Eh. Ammo is easy enough to make with ammo smith, super duper and server hopping for cans still being a thing. Either way you make good points, Sir.
---
That depends on how much the mutant is selling it for, I suppose..
---
That bot is kill on sight.
---
Yeah i can't rejoin randoms either; i've decided it's not worth workshopping unless you have a friend with you because disconnects are more common than server crashes.

Oh okay thank you

Are you assuming there are exactly 100 servers? Because...that's what it looks like you're assuming. 
---
Not even some cloth from the upholstery?  
---
... No, that sounds about right, actually.
---
I’m a trader and there’s two knock on effects that’ll improve the trade ecosystem: 
---
1. It’ll broaden the demand from the 15 widely distributed, over-powered items. 
---
2. It’ll make people hesitate more touching dupes. 
---
I’m really happy they did this. Logged on this morning to check, and yep, my inventory wasn’t affected. 
---
Very well...Saw someone posting saying they could make Knight, but could have just been someone boasting 
---
Woah woah woah there buddy.  Don't go slinging your mud at me.  It's not my fault you sexually abused those people.  That's for the courts to decide.
---
Harper's ferry, when you fast travel in, or spawn in, run down the hill in front of you, (over or around the fallen tree) go through the hole in the wall past the car, and through the house. You'll see display cases in that house, where the plans will be.. a lot of different ones spawn there, or none at all. If you keep going through the house , you'll be at the walkway to the vendor. 
---
why did you store that on your person?
---
The self-destruct sound reminds me of a 1980 IBM PC booting up.
---
Haven't seen notice that there is a fix for weapons having a random amount of ammo in the magazine each time I load in or fast travel. Hoping patch notes will mention it. That, or fast traveling into a wall or under the foundation in my camp. Would love to see either of those things fixed at this point and I would probably play it again. 
---
"Failed to deliver" is quite the statement.  I've bought so many games that were way worse than Fallout 76.
---
I swear if this wasn't a "Fallout" game..
---
...yes. If something would arrest the issue and is not physically impossible, it's a possible solution. Whether those considering their options have the ability to implement it only determines if that is the one used, or if another one is chosen.
---
Just because Bethesda is apparently too incompetent to implement this fix doesn't mean it's not a solution that could be pursued.

 Today was the day I finally got tired of him and took my 2 steel. ;)
---
:( some perverse satisfaction that they forced you to perform some action against your will?  They get your junk if you die?  The satisfaction that while no one said life is fair, at least it’s unfair in their favor?  
---
So many reasons why being an asshole in gaming is fun, but the real question should be, why the fuck would Bethesda think their single player fan base from the fallout franchise would enjoy this kind of play style?  
---
I don’t have facts or figures, but suspect that the players that made Fallout 4 the best selling game it was we’re enjoying being the hero,  pretty sure sales of Fallout 4 would have tanked if players were constantly being one shot by raiders and super mutants with no chance of ever evening up the odds.
---
as much as i hate raiders and what they stand for, i admire your balls.  +1

My experience doesn't go quite as far back... Apple ][+ with 64k of RAM, sweet 1 mhz 6502 CPU and not one but TWO floppy drives! I was living in the fast lane, baby!
---
But this is absolutely the most fundamentally broken game I've seen in a LONG time. Yes the graphics were garbage on my first computer and there were indeed shitty games I ran across... but must of them at least worked.
---
I'm cautiously optimistic after today's very even handed set of fixes, but there's a mountain of goodwill to repair.
---
Would you have been happy if you could purchase these weapons from the atom shop?
---
Fully crafted weapons are *not* crap weapons. But what the hell point is there in crafting when everyone has a "totally legitimate" godly weapon with the perfect stats?
---
you goddamn MONSTER
---
Not at all, but I’m a whale and don’t mind skipping grind time for cash. 
---
Well I am kinda hesitant to agree.
---
For example where I am from there is a law, if you buy a stolen item, if in good faith or not, the item has to be returned and you can make a case against the seller but you don't get any reparations for the money you invested.
---
So even a good faith buy will damage you if you got scammed. 
---
Making the comparison to this here, and doing the same thing - yeah it might be shit for those who "really" didn't know that that awesome TSE item they bought for 500 caps from that russian was duped, but well on the other hand, it's the game you find gear and improve and find better stuff. It might be a setback for those who bought it buy in the same time they used the duped super weapons to gain a lot of other profit from it, so I don't even think most of them did make a loss with it.
---
In addition, take me and most other players. We never bought such an item and are now seeing how others who "knowingly or not" abused the system get to keep the items. It's actually less fair to the majority of players in my mind.
---
I haven't had any disconnects today, but I've had two infinite loads and two instances where the Legendary effect on my main weapon wasn't working.
---
I can craft anything.. and it’s just not nearly as effective as the wrist TSE weapon. 
---
Any Melee at this point though.. the balance is so off.  
---
An old meme 😂 That’s funny. I did find a 3* grognak once but was completely wrong for my rifle build. Got most of my xp from farming white springs nuke zones before the nerf. I find a ton of nocturnal and stalkers rubbish. That’s about it. No two shots no AA no Furious. Nothing. I really am an old meme
---
Don't expect NPCs. You'll only let yourself down and blame them. Besides, with how ALL NPCs are at the moment, that means that they'll simply: stand in one spot, follow one path, and MOST DEFINITELY repeat the same lines over and over. "Patrolling the Mojave makes me wish for a nuclear winter" "Those Degenerates belong on a cross" "Adjusting to the bunker, outsider?" You don't want NPCs. You want conversation
---
You make it sound as if a safe space is a bad thing. Is it?
---
Or. . . Remove all legendaries until duping is stopped, and dps between all ranged and Melee is equalized or at least balanced
---
If you had a ZX Spectrum now you would complain. Hell, I would complain R-Type 2 is too hard or Rambo is too repetitive. And Arkanoid, don't ge me started on that one :) 
---
You certainly have a point. I'm L143 and have only found a single TSE weapon, a L40 pipe rifle when I was L94. So without the dupers I also would not have be able to play around with much better TSE weapons.
---
That said, post nerf I don't use the ones I bought much at all. My main is a 2\* Instigating Lever (+10% while aiming) and most of the time it's a beast. When it isn't enough for a 1- or 2-shot kill.. the game gets really exciting again! And I never blow myself up on accident. Or on purpose.
---
IMO the TSE nerf was the right move (even though I miss some really sweet 2-Shot guns that now aren't as strong as the Instigating) because it has brought some suspense back into game play. 
---
This isn’t about law. 
---
Its a game. 
---
It’s something we do for entertainment. For fun. 
---
Take a huge number of players who did nothing wrong, and who traded a lot of blood and sweat for a powerful item, and take the item away from them, it’ll ruin a lot for them. 
---
It would punish the wrong people, and hurt the community and the game, in the name of some ideal. 
---
It’s a shit call, buddy. 
---
I've gotten a couple from work shops. Only a couple in 330+ hours
---
Yes those are some great points. I would love some tougher enemies as well and that would bring the weapons up to lvl. If they also wanted to keep the balances the same for weapons, they could just scale the dang/res for weapons/armor. So for example, lvl 60 weapons will do the same dmg that the same lvl50 weapons do now. So either way, bring on the higher lvl enemies and higher lvl weapons. 
---
It's less that /r/fo76FilthyCasuals has their head in the sand. There's acknowledgement that there's room for improvement, but we don't let the negatives destroy our *lives* and we don't act toxic to one another just to make others feel as shitty as we might be feeling, too.
---
wow...I don't think I ever seen a more rude comment in my life I am not whining to Bethesda about anything but they made this a multiplayer experience and most multiplayer games have a factions system especially since it fits very well within the games factions. I mean damn even the original red dead online had outlaws vs lawmen. I despise the type of player you are you figure because you use discord and organize some thing that your special and deserve a reward. 
---
Hmm, I'm thinking this might be the case. I wonder if there's a way to fix it 
---
I have given up for now...I farmed one location today for 4 hours and got nothing so.
---
Except I didn't make an argument on what 1% consisted of.  I'm saying that it (the entire duper paranoia) wasn't as big of a deal as previously thought. Them announcing it only amounted to 1% is pathetic compared to what it was thought to be.  You had people thinking it was going to be so many that entire threads were made just to talk about how they looked forward to the salty crying posts after the wipe. Again I'm not arguing what that 1% consisted of just that the number itself is incredibly and unbelievably tiny.
---
If you're going to be a condescending dunce nugget then at least understand what I'm saying. 
---
That’s a lot of work and a lot of people will get pretty mad I think. I think the level way is much easier
---
A huge number of players got a duped item but the majority does not. The huge number of players did use the duped item to have an unfair advantage at getting more legit items, so they already have the thing pay itself off.
---
Where is the shit call in that? Where is the compensation for the ones who do not have an uber weapon now, which is surely the vast majority of players?
---
There's never enough screws.....
---
Hey, it only took 4 months for Bethesda to actually get their act together. Maybe this game could turn around? It's a small possibility but I'll take it. 
---
i am some what sure that beth went after people who had an unreasonable amount of certain items in their inventory.
---
people who have a single duped item, whether it was bought or traded for, where left alone.  beth went after the actual dupers.
---
they said that only 1% of the player base were duping.  kind of makes me wonder too.  i see 3000 people right now in appalachia, so that would mean that 30 of them could have potentially been dupers.  i wonder how many people regularly play fo76?  10,000?  so 100 dupers?
---
No lag no disconnects no spammers slowing servers
---
Absolutely. 
---
Ha, hadn't thought of that in the moment it took to write my reply. But that makes even more sense. And just imagine the whining we'd get to hear when L45/50 TSE weapons get nerved... AGAIN!! lol 
---
I guess eliminating duping once and for all would need to happen for B to consider this. Personally, confidence is low that either will happen. But I still like your ideas!
---
So, 
---
Of every 1000 players 
---
700 don’t have any
---
250 are generally innocent people who traded everything they had for, say, an unyielding/sentinel piece
---
50 are cheaters. 
---
Why are you arguing for punishing the 250? 
---
“Because 700 is a bigger number than 250” isn’t an answer. 
---
Some of the problems they should've known about before hand (infinite carry weight, duping glitches, the rest of the pre-existing bugs) but some of it was only going to come when you had people playing, alongside people exploiting &amp; trying to break things. Personally I've enjoyed playing since November, and will keep playing as it gets better, but a lot of the problems aren't completely their fault
---
Yes I do hope they can control the duping and hopefully they can figure something out. Some great ideas yourself as well thx. 
---
Challenging a gamer is the rudest thing you can do.
---
Yeah its very possible...I've seen some shit...
---
I know of a few "dupers" that i play with regularly on this game and the patch barely affected them.  The only thing that some of them lost was Nuka-Cola's most had ample warning before hand and drank a bunch the night before to gain max caps.  This patch didn't affect dupers the way people thought it would.  Many Unyielding/Sentinel armor sets are out there as well as tons of bloodied melee weapons.  The patch was about as effective as a Hello-Kitty Band-Aid on a gunshot wound.
---
I self identify as an Apache attack gunship 
---
Being a born and raised resident of West Virginia, I have more than a little reason to be biased but in spite of the glitches and issues, I still love this game. Even after completing the game, I happily roam around and farm, grind, explore. This is my first Fallout game, I have gotten WAY more than $60 worth of entertainment and joy out of 76. I hope they can get things turned around so the toxicity in this community will go down a bit and people come back. 
---
Try depleting the core and dying then restart the game. That used to fix the "permanent PA" problem. 
---
Thanks. Just curious. If you could purchase those many people would throw a compleat fit. I haven't purchased anything from the shop myself not even using the atoms I have earned in game as I'm not much for cosmetics myself.  
---
But when the time was right I could see myself  buying a weapon that was looking once my build was complete. I don't get a whole lot of free time so I would happily spend a little cash to skip the search. 
---
I'm not against in game purchases at all and long as they are not random item loot boxes. 
---
All that... sugar. Bleh.
---
Roses are red, Violets are blue. Shouldn't they be purple? Isn't that odd to you?
---
At first I was buying it in Whitesprings and server hoping but it doesn't take that many materials if you just craft level 20 light combat armor. Rubber ends up being the hardest to find but the highschool in Grafton nets you around 80 and if you do the super duper perk it helps. I've scrapped probably close to 100 pieces now and have only unlocked 2 helmet paints
---
Wonder what bethesda's plans are for the marine combat helmet. Cause it is slowly spreading. IT is no longer an item they can just remove.  
---
At this point I don't think I can count it as an exploit item anymore sure the first wave of them was gained through an exploit but most the people getting it in trade now don't even know that is how the item came to be. 
---
5.5 hours of uninterrupted game play after patch.  on PC.  
---
the only problem i am experiencing, performance wise, is my fluctuating FPS.  used to bounce between 1 - 60.  boosted my refresh to 120hz, from 60, and now fluctuations are between 35 - 60.   made this change pre-patch.  no change post-patch.
---
Just for clarification, will the first new content drop with the PvP servers. That's what it sounds like reading this
---
I'm on xbox. I'll gladly build for u sometime this weekend if u provide supplies. 
---
If anything, just ask them for a screenshot.
---
Ever since the update to plans and vendors I have yet to see them appear. Seems Technical Data might be the only way now
---
I’ve moved on to Apex, and still playing Star Citizen. I keep this sub on my list because I’m hoping the devs get swapped out and the game is not made into the F2P grindfest it’s headed towards. 
---
Why can I carry 20,000 lbs of things (thanks % weight reduction) on my back but only 600 in my stash... beth logic.
---
but the taxes....
---
Every week there is a post like this, and it's really damn annoying to be honest.
---
I have fun with this game too, but it's a dumpster fire right now. Learn to take criticism, cause to be honest 80% of the complaints are valid.
---
I really like hearing this again, have been hearing others report same all day since servers came back up. But it does make me wonder about B saying that fewer than 1% of accounts had duped items removed. If removing huge amounts of items is responsible for the many reports of better server performance, how can only 1% of accounts be responsible? 
---
Hmm, unless servers are running multiple game worlds, I guess. I always figured one server per game world, but if a server is hosting 5, 10, 20 worlds at the same time... I guess that would make it much more likely that one of those 100 accounts was present on a server, screwing up its performance. Anyone here know anything about server/world likelihood? 
---
Yeah, the memory leaks haven't accumulated yet lol.
---
Fellow Forest Dweller since Rec Day, I’ll see your Sutton and raise you a Point Pleasant...insane amount of ammo, junk and the Church is a Stim Goldmine. Also a dedicated PA spawn for fusion cores.

Crafting allows you to learn the weapon, craft and scrap, learn the mods, and upgrade your legendary to its maximum potential. So there is still a grind involved to make it good, whether you traded for or found your legendary weapon.
---
Same exact situation with me, this is my first Fallout experience as well, bought it bc I’m a West Virginian. I love it. 
---
Ah and now your trying to troll. Guess that proves me right. Have the last word. I'm giving you that pleasure

Roses are red,

You can scrap veg starch for glue?

What the fuck

Understand. I really only play two games at this point and hardly get time for that. Still only just at level 45 and haven't really done much of quests.  If I had everything done at was at anywhere above lvl 70 I would have moved on long ago. Just grinding looking for better gear it not for me. 
---
u need about 50ish iq to recognise those are not the same peoples..

and i another kind... i simply don't care. i never duped and never brougth duped things and not envy to others tse shit.

---
Update: it survived!
---
And my Hunter’s The Dragon didn’t get accidentally deleted!
---
I like blowing them up with melee attacks.
---
And it went on 50% sale within month and half. And its filled with duped weapons. From a company, that is known to release buggy games. And barely fix them. They would have been better off releasing co op. Not pvp. 
---
diet nuka cola any one?    ::retch::

---
That’s great if you are on pc. 
---
The made enhancements to server stability independent of any ancillary impact anti-duping may have had.  
---
You want some power armor instead?
---
So is it a glitch or just the game cycling through the npcs?
---
I never drank any of Nuka-Colas I bought from the vendors. Always used them for something more exciting. 
---
I have not laughed so fuckn hard in ages, thank you lol
---
Actually..
---
It was a revenue stream that got clipped. Imagine a side gig where you got real money for making counterfeit items, cheap and totally legal and all under the table. No tax reporting. Craigslist not just eBay.
---
Imagine everything going well and it gets raided.
---
Now you’ve got 2 concerns 
---
How long can you hold bootleg product before you’ve got to ditch?
---
What’s the outcome if you don’t?
---
I think you’re seriously mistaken if you don’t think dupers were pissed that their cash cow killed. Not to mention all the YouTube posers who saw their channels spike by showing folks how to dupe.
---
Just an FYI. Supposedly the duping is fixed as of earlier today.
---
No disconnects I might even take a workshop!
---
It isn’t...
---
There are dozen upon dozens of posts of people pointing out they also did a server upgrade to attempt to stop disconnects and instability
---
Not denying this, but, it’s a certainty that less variables overall reduce the load on the database servers.
---
500k??? player???? more like 5k...
---
Does this Level 25 1-star Legendary Lead Pipe (+1 CHA) spark JOY?

My power armour is at 25 so I think im alright on that note, but if you dont mind I can take some lvl 30 Power Armour lol
---
came out in 97, I loved that game, spent many many years playing.
---
Can’t say for sure. I know the ones at McClintock don’t spawn again immediately. It’s usually just the Gutsy’s in the Enclave bunker I think. Assaultrons will say something like “Time of death:  noted” when seeing one. Other Gutsy’s will say something like “Who did this!”  
---
Thata a complete lie and they know it. A very large majority of the player base has at least one duped item in their inventory if you have ever gotten anythung from another player, a vendor bot, a bag or any other means than an enemy drop. Now will all these people loose their stuff nah probably not...or well lets hope. Im jusy keeping my fingers crosses half my inventory is not gone when i log in. Cuz i do alot of trading and idk where these people i trade with get the things i buy off them. I try to stay away from obvious dupers but that doesnt mean a duped item doesnt go from player to player to player before it reaches me. If most of my inventory is gone next time i log in that will probably be the end of it for me until they add something that makes the game worth playing again. 
---
Saying crafted guns aren't as effective is not the same as saying crafted guns are crap. Any crafted gun on a decent build for it can shit all over this game, it is not a difficult game. 
---
Then keep it to yourself, instead of making this sub toxic with your negative and overall bad attitude. Try to vent in a cronstructive way. 
---
What platform? Console or pc? 
---
Why is every post with this point of view being downvoted to hell?
---
Big time bummer. Got my hopes up for this dupe purge.
---
That makes more sense. How are ya, mate? Still in that fantastic CAMP or have you remodeled?
---
Found so many two shots never TSE I got a TSE handmade and 10mmfrom market sub tho
---
This sub has been filled with self entitled snowflake children who have cried about how bad they felt it was and how offended they were that others enjoyed the game since a few months before the beta even started.
---
They need something to cry about, and the echo chamber here gives them that. Never mind that 90% of what they cry about is bullshit, they just don't feel like a person unless they cry at least 50x a day.

Since the December 11th and Jan 10th patches I can't get borderless windowed to work worth a damn, lost 30 FPS on the Dec. patch and another 30 on the Jan (down to 25 - 35 FPS from 100).  
---
   
---
If I switch to non-windowed 100 FPS rock solid....  
---
But with 3 monitors...

Ouch. My spidey sense also goes off around cars. I’ve had enough when one killed me at a low level. 
---
I only have 25.
---
Okay cool. Thanks for the help man
---
Her icon actually appears on the map as a diamond, separate from the quest hexagon over the FSP.
---
I’m our. Are she flew over downtown Watoga,, staying there and turning the place into an absolute circus of boys fighting 3*** Legendary Hermit Crabs and Snallys while we all ran over to finally bring her down. 
---
Kinda cool, actually.
---
Thanks anyways lol
---
Shhhh go play Fortnite cause this game isn’t for you it seems 
---
i made a post on this about a week ago.  
---
have refrigerators.   you can store meats, veggies, and drinkable liquids.  slow spoiling effect like perk does. has a 100 lbs limit
---
have freezers:  you can store meats and veggies.  no spoilage.  same limit as fridge.  100
---
Wrong. I let him give me my prize.
---
Then I kill him. 
---
Rawr, such anger.
---
I posted thus based on what was known prior to the final patch notes, but don't let that stop you from continuing to lash out. 
---
Holy Mothman visits my CAMP regularly. All hail Mothman!
---
Yes I froze after opening the pip boy too soon 
---
so youre saying theres a 100% chance I have not found/read all the content in the game???
---
Haha, thanks for the mention Polygon

---
i try to run around and gather a mob, tag with perfect storm or something, then draw the whole lot towards other players. everybody get a tag and let the one-hitters enjoy finishing the deal. good instructions :)
---
I just had a pair of assholes destroy everything in my 2nd account’s base. The only thing I caught was something about “move your base”; I had teamchat on until I noticed that the character’s health was going down, went over to look, and watched them knock down the walls and the crops.
---
The best part? Since they were a duo, they just killed each other to wipe their bounties.
---
Talk about an exploitable system.
---
By not giving the 700 the same item the 250 have you are literally punishing 700 people who did nothing but not exploit the game for the benefit of 250 who might or might've not knowingly exploited it.
---
So yeah 700 is a bigger number of purely innocent players that now are at a disadvantage. 
---
Like I said - people who bought it already have the thing paid off for them by simply using it. They already did use exploited items to gain an advantage over people that did not exploit.
---
And back to the other points: 
---
Yes this is not law it's a game, I said it however to show how similar cases are handled by the law. Because if you let things like this happen, the chance they might do it again is much greater. 
---
With what bethesda is doing by not punishing the players for using exploited items they are basically giving them a free pass. So when the next exploit is around everyone will be on board to not miss his chance for the cool items those guys got last time. So making laws or in this case rules to prevent such things from happening is actually a really good thing. Yes it sucks for some players but in the end, everyone knows that they should be careful who they trade with and if they can trust the person they trade with, because else they might get fucked over. It's a lot like it is in real life.
---
In addition, if we want to stick with gaming and not law - have you heard of the world first kills in World of Warcraft? Guilds were using exploits that were not known as exploits till the day they used them to gain ahead of others. What was done about it? They were treated as normal exploiters, the achievements taken from them and people banned for it. This is a normal policy even in the gaming world.
---
Of course I am not advocating for the ban of anyone about this, but taking away all the items that are literally there by people exploiting would make way more sense then leaving them in. It's not that they may be legit or not, those items should not exist period - so to keep the game clean they should take them out.
---
What do you have against that?
---
Don't you agree that people by using a weapon that did twice the dps or more of what they used before for months yields a big benefit for the players - easily outweighing whatever they paid for it.
---
Don't you further agree that maybe some players paid a lot, others simply got it gifted by some cheater (not suspicious at all) or paid a laughable small amount for it. They don't suffer at all from fixing this issue.
---
Don't you also agree that by keeping this item in the game - all players that are 100% legit are being indirectly punished by not having the chance to easily get such an exclusive item now? By easy I mean, it is more difficult to find an awesome TSE weapon than caps or whatever is traded for it. 
---
Is this on the forum? Im curious if this is true because it would really be a fun grind to get one. Thanks.
---
I think with the nerf you can't even hurt yourself with explosive weapons, I tried for those atom challenges to revive teammates, unless the nerf didn't do that but was a silent fix on explosive weapons all together.
---
I just unsubbed to filthy, myself. The atmosphere comes off as very "Drink the Kool-aid." to me, and it honestly creeped me out. 
---
That would be interesting. An offline build mode that doesn’t require logging into a world where you can save the blueprint of your creation. It can also list the necessary plans.  Less worry about hunger/thirst and griefers. 
---
Seeded RNG.  
---
I run (3) accounts and my primary loots complete dreck, I mean I get a 1* when everyone else in the group loots a 3* and in 320 levels (I stopped leveling, well trying to about 6 weeks ago) I've gotten zero TSE's and a total of (3) explosive weapons..  
---
My second account has looted, in 64 levels, 3 TSE's, over a dozen explosive weapons and consistently, as in more than 3 times as often, loots 2* and 3* Legendaries while my primary loots a 1*.  
---
The 321 has a 12 luck.  
---
The 64 has a 3 luck.
---
Turns out nah. 
---
Do you have .stls?
---
Haha, hey hey
---
Still same, same
---
To be honest, I migrated back to Warframe for the last couple of weeks since the TSE nerf patch
---
Servers just wouldn’t stick, game was unplayable
---
Been lurking awaiting better times, haha
---
Do you find the Quantum's to be a little under powered?    
---
And where is my Cherry recipe?
---
It’s my favorite thing to do besides weight management and playing Can Man. 
---
Have you got an BOS plans from scrapping?
---
Never bothered with them. They are indeed weak. Regular Nuka-Cola is easier to find in large amounts anyway as most vendors that have it usually have multiple. I think Bubbles usually has 6 while only having 1 of Quantum and Grape, the latter being pretty much the most OP aid item in the game. 
---
This! This right here! Fucking screws!
---
I would like to see a build only server. You could disable enemies, weapons, quests etc and increase build budget. Building is honestly the most enjoyable aspect of the game for me. 
---
This was posted after the final patch notes, though. 
---
Ha. I thought I recognized your username. 
---
That is correct. I did not realize they had been posted. 
---
Woo!
---
Playing with my stepson and loving it
---
Ah that is good, because I bought my 3 tse weapons which are different kinds and they were expensive, wouldn't surprise if they were duped. Even with the nerf to tse if Bethesda removed them because they were duped would sink this game to the grave more for me.
---
Ive had all sorts of enemies scorched and etc. Do this. I walk into an area and they will all just drop dead. I just tell myself they are psychic and saw their future so they just assumed position. Easier to die on their own than die tired i figure haha on a serious note i assume its some sort of bug but idk kind of annoying when im scrapping/farming xp but you learn to roll with the bugs if youre a true fallout fan lol sadly
---
Worked fine 4 me :) 
---
Agreed.
---
What happens if you just been hoarding nuka-colas never duped them like say you had 100 quantum saved, 30 nuka-colas and 70 cherry, would Bethesda think its duped?
---
If they’re TSE, there’s probably a 90%+ chance they’re duped. 
---
Look at all those points I lost even though I was right. And all the haters didn't come back to say anything.
---
But, what about the people that bought from dupers without knowing, they would hurt more then actually dupers losing everything.
---
This line haha wow ... 😂
---
Yeah lol. I find the bugs to be kinda charmin as long as the game still works. But i guess most people can't overlook bugs for an otherwise good game.
---
Another wise-ass who has no affirmative statements to move the dialogue forward, just unfalsifiable sarcastic criticisms. Die in a fire.
---
It should have, would have made the game more stable result in less people rage quitting from disconnecting at queen looting time, etc, breaking quest, and probably wouldn't have had tse nerfed to oblivion just slightly nerf since not everyone would have it.
---
We need a cult of Mi-Go...
---
.  
---
[The Deep Ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_One?wprov=sfsi1)...   
---
So looking past the "fish" part to the rest, the Deep ones had hybrids, and in some post-Lovecraftian writing authors flirted with it being a transmittable "disease" akin to Lycanthropy.  
---
In other stories humans and other creatures would become twisted vessels for the [Elder Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_Thing?wprov=sfsi1)..
---
What if the Scorched are exactly that, not a plague brought on by a mutated disease, but a plague of conversion marking the arrival of the Heralds of one of the Elder Gods?    
---
They spread through virus and spores, are described as having technology advanced enough to be called magic...  
---
That would make Scorch Beasts not "mutated bat things" and the "scorched" creatures not infected with a virus or standard plague, but host to a larger, darker entity, almost like worker bees being commanded by the Heralds, who themselves serve one of the Old Ones..    
---
Specifically the [Mi-Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi-go?wprov=sfsi1), who spread via fungus (there are fungi in real life with some terrifying properties), and the hallmark trait of the infected was a "Pinkish hue"
---
It all fits, especially with the OP's findings.
---
*Edit*  
---
BTW check out this [Zombie Fungus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiocordyceps_unilateralis?wprov=sfsi1) that exists in real life.
---
Lol you dont even know what you're talking about though. And fortnite is disgusting lol 
---
CHUM lol
---
How does this only have 7 upvotes? 
---
Perks have a tendency to break after minor and major updates to a character. Try unequipping and reequipping your perks and see if that fixes anything. This happened with perks in power armor and was fixed by doing this, maybe the same is true for this case.
---
Don’t know.  I would assume those would be considered a lot, but not unbelievable (unless they’re in a quantity expressible as 2^n). 
---
30 regular ones isn’t unbelievable at all. Clear out each vendor as you make your run of the 7 factions and you could easily get that many. 
---
Christ
---
Morgan town high, I get 100 -180 plastic each run.
---
Ya, bugs aside, i still enjoy this game geniunely. The funny thing is people will bitch about the game but fail to mention theyre level 256 and logged more hours than one man should lol
---
Oh I don't buy nuka colas I just pick up whatever I see and save them until I get thirsty lol. Since it gives water and free cap.
---
Didn’t WANG CHUM have a hit in the 80’s?
---
I might actually waste the time to launch em for that, collect photo's of them hitting all the big tourista sites. The UFO, Mega Stop, Tanagra, Camden Park etc.
---
How drunk are you right now?
---
Wasn't it nerfed to 25% damage, and explosive nerfed to 20%? Gotta love your One and a Quarter Shot rifle.
---
Yeah I assume so especially when you see your lever action has the same 3 legendary effects as someone elses. Still never seen tse legitly drop after 200 lvls.
---
On this episode of hoarders...
---
I totally feel your pain. No turrets and I have a sliver of budget left. I made alot of revisions on my permanent camp spot to make it feel right. I would love a budget increase too.
---
Lmfao yeah. Its even funnier when people compare fallout 76 to red dead 2 even though both had a lot of bugs appon launch.
---
Lol, I tried coming up with something to say, but I didnt even know where to begin with OPs rambling
---
Lvl 80s can drop ultracite mod plans but its rare. I usually see them drop plans when the queen spawns and they are flying around though more then wild ones.
---
I can get behind your statement. I used a fully crafted vanilla sniper rifle before I decided to turn to the reddit markets for assistance in legendaries and I could take down lvl 68 super mutant warlords rather quickly with head shots. Just gotta max out damage on a specific weapon
---
Please elaborate. 
---
Shhhh your up past your bedtime 
---
You know who doesn't enjoy that? *A synth*.
---
“You’re nobody til somebody loves you, and that somebody is me. I love you.” -Mr. New Vegas
---
I've been playing and still play and after 400+ hours, it has steadily been getting better and better, I would start playing asap if you want to get game knowledge before a lot of the expansions come out. Weapons and armor for high level players are hard to get. 
---
I think bethesda could have spent another 6 months to a year on this game but aside from the end game lacking, its still highly enjoyable. I know i couldnt make a game like pac-man, let alone f76, so i have no room to complain lol
---
50% off was a really bad knee jerk reaction. I will admit only hearing people complain and not actually playing it I was really put off. I took a chance and I have enjoyed it.
---
Duped weapons? Sure, but that doesn't bother me any. As far as I can tell the only people that affected are supers and those that got duped.
---
Sure they put out some buggy games, but really it isn't that bad. New Vegas was an issue for sure, but tons of people still enjoyed the game. Fallout 4 has issues and well, but nothing game breaking. Beyond that they have fixed past issues and they are working to fix these. 
---
PvP can still work and will. This is not every other PvP game, it Bethesda's take on it. People are quick to complain about how a lot of PvP games are the same, then someone changes it and a mob of people, who represent a fraction of the base, complain.
---
This game is still very new. If 6 months go by, not including beta time, and the same stuff is around then I might agree more. At a year I do expect more out of them.
---
Right now people rushed to end game, ignored what the social part was supposed to be and are complaining about no new content. So Bethesda will rush out buggy content in the hopes of appeasing those with no patients and in the end only upset them more.
---
I am in this for the long run. I am going to play the wasteland, helping strangers and at least saying hi to people. As far as I am concerned the people ruining this game, both the supers and those who can't stand to actually play without buying their way through, can leave and uninstall the game. I won't miss them nor will the community. 
---
All this talk of how this game will die....it will if the toxic portion stays around. Though on that note those toxic people just move on to the next new game and ruin that as well. Thing is they never stick around so I couldn't care any less about them.
---
If that sounds cold, good. This is what Bethesda should be feeling to. More power to them. They will get things fixed. Once the nit picking stops they can focus on the real issues and not someone need to cheat, exploit, or play this game like every other game out there. This game is different, enjoy it.
---
There’s no easy way to fix this issue. It’s been allowed to fester for too long. It started as a mild infection but has been allowed to develop into gangrene so the remedy will not be painless. 
---
The difficult part is fixing the issue without ruining the economy. Eliminating the source is a good start. I think if they set up a platform wide market, things would go much better and prices would even out. Put trackers on anyone doing any high volume trading , whether on the market or P2P to make sure they’re not selling the exact same rare item over and over. If they implement unique identifiers for items, then this won’t be necessary, just keep a registry of who owns what rare item and block anyone trying to drop or trade something that isn’t marked as in their inventory.  
---
Yeah re-equipping them in any combination only lets the normal one work, inside and outside of my power armor. It might be Lucky Hole Mine tbh as I'm fairly sure I've been opening locks the rest of my session on this server.
---
Yeah exactly haha
---
Its possible both tse were duped but have different id tags ie each one was a legit drop from 2 different people at some point and escaped the purge?
---
Yep! I was just about to recommend that Sub. Good call!
---
With rad worms you get +1 lockpick level. After it wears off you get -1. It's an unintended side-effect of the radworms bug.

Everybody have fun tonight.

Everybody WANG CHUM tonight.

Always have, in FO3 there was a spot that triggered a sequence with the same timing as the napalm run in Apocalypse Now.

I believe you mean fleeing...

Aha, that could be it. I've had a million diseases this session.
---
Nothings new yet just nerfs
---
Can I join? I am a fire breather
---
It's an easy way to let other players in the area know "hey, player over here".
---
i actually suggested this a week ago.  i thought, that since PvP'ers were getting there own game mode, those of us who like to build should get an open server where we can test build our CAMPs, uninterrupted, unimpeded.  then blueprint them, THEN spend the materials in the game server and erect you CAMP.
---
The only place ive noticed this is the small museum south of harpers ferry
---
I buy regular ones to make grenades. I like things that go BOOM. I just wish Bethesda would show them some love. 
---
I hope Class Freak's interaction with Herd Mentality, Egghead, Barbarian, and Evasive will be fixed.
---
I see a lot in here about legendary items, but how did they handle consumables? Like if I spent 100 hours farming screws, did that make my screw pile a target for reduction?
---
Lol yeah. I haven't gotten there yet though so i can't talk bout it.
---
Nor have I. I’ve gotten a few TS and Explosive guns but never one with both effects. 
---
They have a quest in the mire I believe that covers why.

Hey I thought we were just getting started with a new game of "Accuse someone of some baseless shit"?  Well, if you have to go home then you have to go home.  But I'll see you here tomorrow champ.
---
I don't hate this subreddit like you but I do agree that it seems like everyone bitches over ANYTHING. But it's not just this subreddit it's others too. Like the Dead By Daylight subreddit has people pissed about the game coming to switch and saying that it's going to run at 10 FPS. Like everyone overall everywhere seems to be very negative and I can't blame you for not wanting that. 
---
Of course that's not me saying that EVERYONE is like that, but it seems like people do follow the bandwagon of negativity. 
---
That is true but since the framework is based on FO4 I think doing unique markers for every item spawning in existence would be hard and impossible for stackable items. If they just play test really hard to find possible dupe methods and patch them would help prevent future duping, like how they forced a player limit for those that have thousands of weight.
---
The game should also have content to justify all that grinding, which this game currently does not. Not even close. Tell me how you can grind xp without grinding gear? The best xp grind is also the best gear grind. 
---
I do this all the time.
---
One time, I blew up the cars in the Arktos (or whatever) Pharma parking lot when another player was standing there. He fired a Mini Nuke at me to say thanks ;)
---
If this is only because of the server restart,  then they should set deliberate restart times throughout the week. Even if it was just twice a week for 5 minutes at like 4am, all servers reset. If we knew ahead of time to avoid quests or nukes and such, but had far better experiences after the restart I'd be all for it. 
---
That would be awesome
---
Jesus, do you think before speaking?
---
Something's in the way move it away from the wall or object it's next too. Happens with benches as well. 
---
Yep, reloading worked, and oddly enough respawned a bunch of items and containers I'd already looted. Guess it was just a weird thing with the server I was on.
---
I have a sandwich, I've cured world hunger.
---
If it eases your mind, just pretend that since these nukes have been reconstructed by the silo robots after the initial nukes were launched that perhaps their potency is greatly reduced.
---
Slap damage caps at 5 damage a hit, so that’s probably exactly what he was doing. Since you’ve got like 250 health minimum, that’s 50 hits to kill you. I’d say that’s plenty. 
---
More like get good am i right 
---
Cola nut, breh
---
Lol ok, idk what to say really. I havent had that problem before.
---
OK then, that fixed it. How much space does my character need to get in bed? 
---
Know the name I don't remember and now I need my lore. 
---
How is you don't get a Nuka Cola bottle when you drink one?

---
I opened this post up not expecting what it was actually going to be!! That made me laugh so hard! Cheers to you sir!🍻
---
Dude! My solution to every problem, 10 mm with extended mag, bunch of psychojet. Love love love it. 
---
Okay. All you can say is shh cause im right so you made my point thanks!
---
Cause Bethesda has no clue how to handle fallout 76 
---
Complain all you want without us making up a storm you wouldn't even have gotten half as many updates and patches as we did. 
---
Let alone the other stuff like the canvas bags ordeal getting resolved.
---
The server is running slow cause people don't know not to craft too fast 
---
Lmao they only took weapons and nukas, people I know still have loads of ammo, junk, aid and notes and Bethesda said that only 1% of the accounts had duped stuff, so all you people who said duper’s were causing the server instability were wrong, the servers were shit by themselves 😂😂
---
No new content, but it’s expecting in the next month or two. 
---
There have been multiple anti-duper fixes attempted, though they keep finding new methods.  Today was supposed to be a dupe purge, but it only hit some of the sources and even then was half-hearted.  Owners of duped items weren’t affected if they only had one of that item. 
---
There have been multiple attempts at increasing stability. Sounds like today’s fix may have done the trick.  Stash size has increased by 50% since launch, expected to increase again to double the original limit. 
---
A few rebalancing of things, most notably the complete nuking of TSEs to about 1/4 of their original damage while leaving melee and bloodied builds untouched, wrecking explosive weapons in general, making armor durability worse, and neglecting heavy guns and energy weapons entirely. 
---
YES!! Especially when there is a huge parking lot filled with mutiple cars. I also add in a few mines to enhance the explosions. I draw in a few random enemies and boom once they trip a mine so many explosions happen white screen and my system slows down to a point i feel like im gonna disconnect from the servers. Seeing schorchers bodies flying in multiple direction's in the air like birds hundreds of feet is so fun. Only downfall is i can never loot the bodies. Have no clue where they landed. 
---
I don’t see how the 250 hanging on to an item gets in the way of the 700 enjoying the game. 
---
You have an overblown desire of competitive sports fairness that fits in a competitive sports shooter, but has no place in a non-competitive exploration game.
---
At a certain point higher lvl players run out of content... thats when you become the content.
---
I think theres a huge difference in constructive complaints and whining incessantly because the game doesnt cater to ones specific niche playstyle
---
Fighting a echo chamber with another echo chamber lol
---
Every time I log in I scan the map for players nearby and head over to give them a bottle of alcohol or Nuka-Cola for their travels. If they're close enough to my C.A.M.P. I try to lead them over so they can see my base and meet my Snallygaster. A lot of people just seem to not notice the bag or are afraid of me rushing them with an icy beverage, idk
---
Let me tell you what I tell my kids. 
---
“Stop looking in your brother’s plate and eat your dinner.”
---
I have voice chat off because of my experience with this community's voice chatters the couple times it glitched on, among other, more personal reasons.
---
Yeah I eat so many carrots, I think I'm part carrot. Cannibalism still?
---
Haha amen, partner!
---
Unless they are over there bitching about this sub...which they do. 
---
But if i nerf my outlook, how will i get my emails?
---
Purposely seeking out a "positive vibes only" echo chamber is, in my opinion, a cowardly thing to do.
---
https://imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl
---
No point in having markers for junk/aid/ammo etc, just unique items like legendaries. Use other methods to go after the Nuka-dupers.  Have the system red flag anyone with junk items over a certain amount. Got 1000 stable flux?  Flagged.  Got 10k bottles of Nuka-cola?  Flagged. 
---
Oh man more duped Bobbleheads ;)
---
You have literally put my thoughts in a post that I’ve been wanting to say for so long!!!! 
---
Ty very much 
---
It’s extremely fun. I enjoy it more than I should. 
---
For game play purposes? Didn't want intelligent NPCs besides bots and Grahm. For lore reasons? Crazy lone Free-stater killed them all. Practicality reason? They don't want pre-war ghouls around ruining the mysteriousness of pre-war times
---
Roses are red, I know you meant phat.
---
All alone in your C.A.M.P., just you and your cat. 
---
How big is the echo chamber you create by putting your head in the sand? 
---
I mean couldn't someone get hundreds of stable flux and just have a friend help transfer it to an alt for storage?
---
Yes there is. Appalachia is a wasteland. What is a wasteland without adversaries, we’re they be monsters, formerly human, or something far far worse:  other humans. 
---
I got few ts to drop and like 3 explosive to drop but never together or on op weapons lol. Rng is rough.
---
Only shitty little tag nuts wont get it
---
I think I’m gonna cry tears of joy maybe this game could bounce back 
---
My first computer was a Radio Shack. The hard drive was a cassette player.
---
Well you can thank them for nerfing the perk card that would give them more damage lol.
---
That's the same guy who tweeted about no stash limit, sooo...
---
Anyway, pretty easy google search to find the facts
---
Honestly, I’d rather it be a challenge rather than people obliterating her in a minute 
---
Nothing in safes worth lock picking end game anyhow
---
I'll say thanks for the suggestion. Been there and subscribed. 
---
oh cripes! This should be stickied!
---
I would rather they let us Bulk caps in groups 500 or 1000. Treat it as any other junk except you can't sell it to vendors, and it drops if you die like other junk. You could then stash a large amount of them if you wanted, or use then for some other fun stuff.
---
Just getting 100 is time consuming if you’re not buying it from other flux farmers.  Having 1k of any given flux is a bit far fetched to have legitimately.  That’s a full stash and you’re over encumbered from having 400lb on you. I just tossed that out as a number. It’s also getting you close to the 1500 or whatever weight cap they put in place. 
---
It all depends what you define as obnoxious.
---
Someone making valid arguments in a constructive manner criticizing the game is not obnoxious.
---
You interpret it as obnoxious, big difference. 
---
I agree however that alot of people just have one liners punchlines as their entire arguments. Those are Indeed obnoxious and should just be dismissed entirely.
---
But why not have some incentive to be that adversary? There is nothing beneficial to damaging a CAMP, and is thus a pointless mechanic for incorporating into a game. So why include a mechanic that has no purpose, and often causes more frustration than fun?
---
this isnt an angry rant post?? what happened to this sub, is everyone okay?
---
Roses are red, getting a 800 size stash. Melee's still broken, everyone's still Hulk Smash.
---
Nope. They’ll be better and useable but hardly god tier. Not even “good” tier. 
---
Main reason I say this is cost of ammo. You can’t use these as your main weapon. Even taking into account that scorched crowns tend to drop 40mm ammo, you easily will run low on the mats needed to craft ammo if you use these too much. Max Demo Expert gives a damage rating of 190(thanks to that 100% completely unnecessary and shortsighted nerf to it last patch. Looking at YOU Bethesda dev) which is not much higher than some shotguns. And shotgun shells are much easier to craft and get max damage out of.
---
It’s an AOE weapon though so surely those times it’ll hit multiple opponents makes it worth it? Nice point and true. But even then the ammo costs are still too much. Go farm a fresh untouched Sugar Grove and you’ll have enough for maybe 100 nades with all ammocrafting perks. That goes fast.
---
But let me be clear: if Bethesda doesn’t bugger up the patch(this is fair because they have screwed it up for the past two patches, they are completely incompetent so far when it comes to this item) and properly fixes Heavy Weapon perks for these weapons, I’ll use them again. I’ll craft up fresh new ones and a new stack of 40mm (threw it all out after last patch doomed them). Why? Because they’ll at least be worth their weight, if not their costs. And I’m really tired of crappy missile launcher durability.
---
This ignores how useless all explosives are when enemies are close, or at very long range, btw.
---
Keep at it.eventually the tree will fall.
---
I don't see them saying separation of PvE and PvP, which is what we want, just a Survival server that is always PvP enabled
---
My old camp was in white springs. Never logged out in PA. 50/50 chance I logged in and just died of radiation before I even got into the world lol
---
Amen brother
---
I know. I hated that. It was a poke in the eye on top of the TSE nerf, which was already horrendous. I have a deathclaw gauntlet, that with just the mutations, 1 point in iron fist, and no other modifiers did more than half the damage of a TS Fatman, and it has the AA effect. Whoever’s in charge of balancing must be on some serious drugs for this to make sense, and it isn’t even one of the ridiculous builds. 
---
Completely invalid reason, thank you for admitting to it.
---
I got lucky, I was on the roof deck of Hornwright Estate when the vertical crew began circling overhead. Took out my fat fatman and took down the vertibots. Cargo bot kept circling over head and as per above I was able to use aa good ranged weapon for 5 or 6 hits per pass. It landed on the roofdeck edge then slid off when I took it down. fast traveled to get down quicker then nabbed the loot.
---
Is that the road between Helvetia and Sutton, I’ve witnessed the same thing and it’s rather wacky.
---
&gt; I don’t see how the 250 hanging on to an item gets in the way of the 700 enjoying the game.
---
Well three letters: PvP
---
I think the reasoning for it should be pretty obvious.
---
But even apart from PvP, why should people who use exploited items be rewarded for it? Because it took them some work to get those exploited items? That is not an argument.
---
Also, I wouldn't call it an "overblown desire of competitive sports" to have an MMO with fair standards and rules for everyone. Why do most people have to do the annoying grind while others get exploited items and breeze through it?
---
What's the goal of this game? To have fun, yes - but also to become better, to improve the character by getting the best items possible and to challenge the endgame content with it.
---
Can you reply to what I wrote at the bottom of my last post? I would like to know where you disagree there and why because I can not think of a good and fair reason other than you yourself wanting to protect a dupe item that you hold.
---
Definitely am, i would of stayed but nahh ill let y’all deal w/ these garbage dev decisions 
---
Feel sorry for those &amp; myself still giving hope to these devs
---
Because some men want to watch the world burn. There are no NPC raiders in the game. I guess they wanted players to fill the void. I’m fine with it. Wreck my camp and I’ll shove a mini-nuke up your ass once I find you, though given the demo expert nerf and shit balancing it may not be as effective as a switchblade. 
---
That is not a reason, it’s a trolly PvP excuse. He’s asking from a game mechanics standpoint. 
---
I had one and died many times haha! I have a 2 star quad capacity 2 shot which I think is way better! 
---
Thats called depression my guy
---
RYAN GET IN THE COFFIN
---
I teload my own ammo (in real life). Nothing is more tedious than picking up my own shells lol
---
That giant red rocket station is my favorite. 
---
Everybody Fallout tonight
---
Chances that the devs will have fun playing their own games on stream and answering any questions about adding actual story or NPCs to make it a real fallout game? 0 but won't stop me from asking
---
Same, and i feel betrayed that i played the game fair but all these people who illegitimately got their gear did not get punished 
---
If I try to open my pipboy too quickly when logging in I get stuck and have to quit the game. I always have to make sure that I move my character before trying it otherwise it makes the sound of opening rhe pipboy and my character cannot move or do anything. 
---
Call it whatever you like, if it means having a place to discuss the game without hearing how outraged you still are about a canvas bag you never even bought it doesn't matter to me what you think about it. 
---
I find it interesting supposed PvP’ers are downvoting you when you ask for legit mechanics, reasons and rewards to PvP.
---
Probably because they fear having their griefing tools taken away.
---
Echo chamber huh? Lol.  Someone learned a new phrase today.
---
Yeeup, they don’t give a fluff.
---
Until bugthesda deletes the originals, f this alpha/beta shiieet
---
This is... this is good it doesn't fix some of my major concerns like P-cores draining to fast or the accelerated thirst,hunger, but this is just preview and they said there is more info to come soooo. I remain cautiously optimistic that this patch will fix the load of glitches introduced in the last patch.
---
All in all I will say good job.
---
(Super Mutant explodes into a gory red paste)
---
1% of players who duped items into the scale of combined billions of items which would net an *effective* circulated items of probably more than actual players' activities in entire game combined. 
---
Dupers were actual problem. Think. 
---
(Sighs)
---
Well, If you say so
---
(Unzips pants)
---
Yea
---
I got 3 somehow... I've gone back to Whitesprings occasionally to try my luck and get swarmed by more than I can handle and end up training them into exploding cars but still just 3.
---
r/suicidebywords
---
Some people are assholes. Plain and simple. Having this wasteland where everyone gets along would be boring.  What does it matter if a player wrecks your house versus a SB doing it?
---
There are some benefits to damaging camps (though not entirely destroying one).  Some people like myself keep extractors locked up, inside. Want at it?  Break a wall/door or you’re forced to pick 2 locks.  Either way, you’ll become wanted trying to steal my stuff.  
---
I think to make the whole raider bit more immersive there should be better benefits for hitting camps, combined with significantly increased penalties. Camp extractors should be limited to a single resource and hold several times more than their workshop counterparts since its limited to a single one. This provides a larger incentive to thieves. 
---
Conversely, destroying an item should have a bounty commensurate with what’s destroyed. Walls and doors?  10c each. They’re cheap to repair. Break a Devon Arch?  FU. 500c bounty. Someone collect while you’re broke?  FU.  Locked into pacifist mode for a certain amount of time. 
---
And maybe now you’ll learn it too. 
---
If you can’t see the toxicity everyone’s talking about, chances are you should. 
---
As a customer you would be even for 5. If taking it deep is your kink good for you, but thats not mine.
---
Either the above poster is lying or this person managed to get these items legit
---
Holy shit, it's a God damn wasteland people, not a fuckin butterfly park. You're allowed to because some one will want too. Stop trying to turn it into a damn hand holding singalong.
---
Yes would love to get rid of carnivore and swap it for herbivore. Dont want to risk my other 16 mutations with radaway!! 
---
I appreciate their attempt, but it is too little, too late.  The damage from duping has already crippled the game and sealed its fate as a permanent failure.  The game may continue to operate, but it will never see a substantial player base ever again.  Sad, but true ;(
---
I'll get downvoted for this, but that's what raiding is. Destruction. There has to be some reason to fear raiders. There are definitely people who want to play those raiders.
---
 Should there be less cost to the those who are actually inconvenienced? Yeah, flux on a shower rebuild is bullshit. Should there be more incentive to hunting raiders? Yeah a temporary bounty your friend can take off is bullshit. Should there be a benefit to not playing a raider? Definitely, especially when the Responders were made to be their good karma equivalent.
---
These are things they need to fix before survival mode implementation and added content. However taking away the ability to actually raid feels wrong. Maybe if things naturally fixed themselves after a time.
---
Jesus Christ the fucking passive aggressive salt. Its pathetic. Stop crying about the tse nerf you fucking pussies.
---
Tbh I can’t help but suspect this will only enable further games griefers will play with CAMPS. It will eliminate frustrating incidents of accidentally wanted flagging. 
---
You raise an excellent point. Why is this even in the game when it serves no actual purpose. You can’t *really* be Raiders. You can’t kill people for their supplies. There is no “I’m totally mugging you, drop the food and chems!” emote. Oh we can destroy their CAMP? And get exactly nothing for it? Meh. All we can do is kill people for caps, but only in Survival mode or if we abuse the slap system and be stupidly annoying to annoy people into agreeing to PvP. That isn’t raiding.
---
I think what you’re saying is “Do it right or don’t do it at all” or maybe “take out half assed mechanics till you whole ass them.” Both of which I 100% agree with.
---
Yea that's exactly what I had but now it just seems to lag out really bad when the game starts loading whenever that glitch happens 
---
Exactly herbivore is so much better than carnivore, because veggies have a renewable source while meat doesn’t really 
---
hahahaha your right!! 
---
Oh I have seen plenty.  Just not due to this patch.  This patch is steeped in positivity.
---
Maybe you are projecting.  I don't think I'm the one with an echo chamber problem...
---
I actually saw this last night after I went to have a smoke IRL. I came back and all the bots were dead lol
---
You must be new to Bethesda games. 
---
“I play the game like X”, therefore “it’s an X game”, and X is how it’s meant to be played. 
---
X could be PVP, survival, RPG min-maxing, treating it like an FPS shooter, etc. 
---
You need a dose of humility buddy. 
---
It’s X to you. 
---
It’s other things to other people. 
---
And you’re not the majority. You’re just a member of one of the tribes on the game. 
---
And it’s not all about your tribe. 
---
Something is in the way, the same happens to workbenches if there is stuff too close or in the way
---
Updoot for positive FO76 content
---
&gt;Call it whatever you like, if it means having a place to discuss the game
---
Yeah that's what this place is for.   Its the subreddit for the game. 
---
&gt;without hearing how outraged you still are about a canvas bag you never even bought
---
Where did I mention anything about the bag.   But since you brought it up let's talk about it.   Yes, people bought it.  It was the item listed and promoted in the collector's edition and when they paid money for said edition with the expectation of everything that was included in the promo they in fact did buy that.  What they did was a classic anti consumer tactic called bait and switch with a dash of false advertising.  
---
&gt;it doesn't matter to me what you think about it. 
---
Very clearly it does if you have to seek out an echo chamber because you don't like what the meanies are saying. 
---
I don't know how to mind own business
---
its my main source of junk and caps nowadays
---
i just prey on levels lower than mine and take their shit when they fight back
---
Yea i got a pie i wana make into a trophy
---
I like to cook it off with an artillery bombardment. The more booms the better!
---
I don’t know, that question has been asked, does it despawn during the game or will it last until you log out of that server or longer?
---
Your words: (to the op)
---
“The only whining I see yours”.
---
Over half the posts on this subreddit are whining. We can argue if it’s 40% or 60%, but if you come and say you can see 0% whining, you need to get your vision examined. 
---
Do you have anything to back up those numbers? Specifically the billions part. 
---
No way those items are legit. 
---
His name is bob and I love him.
---
No. Wait to see what happens with the upcoming patch. They say new pace content is coming
---
There's a sweet-ass Mothman paintjob (for all PAs) coming soon if you're interested in that, alongside several other Mothman-themed items such as a Neon Sign and the Statue itself (which by the looks of things, will randomly disappear and reappear in your camp)
---
I thought it's r/AskReddit for a second and came to read the answers. A bit disappointed.
---
"Bethesda is trying to fix the game"
---
ah, so that's why they've banned entire accounts (not just access to the game) for crafting too much in a short amount of time. I know it's mainly targeted at those who glitched encumberance, but that glitch was patched out and account banning isn't the right way to deal with people who used it and are now way over weight limit.
---
And being cowardly, as you perceive it, is a bad thing.
---
Would you say that being brave is the opposite of being cowardly, and that being brave is a very positive thing?
---
Do you view bravery as deliberately seeking conflict?
---
I would argue that purposely seeking conflict is inevitably negative.
---
Oh. That might be new. They must have changed it so they need to be added in order?
---
Everyone already has all the weapons though, I found two good 3* weapons on my own and a guy by the overseers camp was giving away literally everything on the day the weight cap got implemented, so I now have all the God roll melee weapons. The dupers have been dumping their stockpiles for a while now, the removal is too little too late. I haven't bought a single thing from another player ever, I just chat in the reddit discord and people are often really friendly and give shit away. 
---
Nah, currently serum services are a good portion of the trading market. I think it’s fine staying that way. 
---
I'm on 1373 hours of Factorio and not bored of it yet. A single save I'm on is half that time.
---
Yeah.  I feel this is something that was more consistent in the past.  Now, it's almost like a placebo effect.
---
&gt; i honestly don't understand why devs even bother communicating with people here
---
If devs would only communnicate in a sub like the FC76, where everyone think everything is ok, no progress would ever be made since they wouldnt receive the necessary feedback needed to improve on the game.
---
&gt;I hope beth don't take this sub as a representation of entire playerbase. Cause that's just too sad
---
As vocal as i am about the game flaws, i agree with this however.
---
It was my first time in Lucky Hole Mine and I didn't know if I had to unlock some doors in there; turns out not really, they just save time by getting you to the lead deposits quicker.
---
Yes and at that time and currently all I see is positive.  Now sure, I guess I could toggle and look for the controversary; but I am reading other things not pertaining to fallout all day long.  Ya know, cause I'm not in an echo chamber.
---
Cool new phrase you learned.  Want to tell me how your more in the know of the Fallout community again?

Instead of complaining, you could just leave like you said because noone cares. 
---
&gt; Some people are assholes. Plain and simple. Having this wasteland where everyone gets along would be boring. What does it matter if a player wrecks your house versus a SB doing it?
---
Just repeating a bad point doesn’t make it any better. 
---
&gt; There are some benefits to damaging camps (though not entirely destroying one). Some people like myself keep extractors locked up, inside. Want at it? Break a wall/door or you’re forced to pick 2 locks. Either way, you’ll become wanted trying to steal my stuff.
---
Ohhh nooo wanted?! Pointless when you can have a friend cap you for the reward. But that leads me to the diamond in your rough:
---
&gt; I think to make the whole raider bit more immersive there should be better benefits for hitting camps, combined with significantly increased penalties. Camp extractors should be limited to a single resource and hold several times more than their workshop counterparts since its limited to a single one. This provides a larger incentive to thieves.
---
Excellent idea. Penalties are a joke now, increase them. Likewise, make the risk worth it.
---
&gt; Conversely, destroying an item should have a bounty commensurate with what’s destroyed. Walls and doors? 10c each. They’re cheap to repair. Break a Devon Arch? FU. 500c bounty. Someone collect while you’re broke? FU. Locked into pacifist mode for a certain amount of time.
---
Interesting ideas, I like them. Let me point out a big issue though: PvP *balance* is currently a joke. So till Bethesda solves that, OP’s point is still a contender. Why should we even be able to do things that are poorly implemented, especially since currently they’re more often used to grief and harass more than anything else?
---
Ive seen alot of serums sell for 500 caps so why not find someone with the serums you want and than start removing the mutations you have. At worst youd have to buy all 4 again so Thats in your price range.
---
If I play 76 I can be lonely in real life, and in a game!!!
---
well...complaining is expressing dissatisfaction.
---
When you 'point out' a bug, are you satisfied about the game having that bug? I assume no, because not many people want bugs/glitches in their game. So it is likely you are expressing dissatisfaction about that bug's existence.
---
Reporting flaws **is** posting a complaint. It's just not all complaints are bad.
---
&gt;Intiate

Only  Initiate right now...

On XBox go to the "party" tab, select "search or create post" then select "looking for group" then select "fallout 76".
---
You will see a ton of posts about people wanting to trade. You can create your own post or respond to someone else’s and join their game to trade
---
Got all my walls by taking Workshops... it's random but there are plenty to take...
---
People only complained abut the TSE combination being too op, they never asked for demo expert to be nerfed TS to be nerfed, and E to be nerfed.
---
All we asked was for weapons to not be able to spawn TS+E and for demo expert to remain the same just not affect the E mod, that's it.
---
They went overboard with nerfs, ofc people are going to complain, rightfully so.
---
I just wish we could refill the Summersville lake with the tears of the ex-owners of 80k+ bobble head stashes.
---
Totally! Like I'd be totally fine if, instead of removing damage altogether, they created some interesting PVP tower defense aspect with this. Instead, destroying camps have no purpose other than to grief, so I can't understand anyone other than griefers would support this.
---
Add me manny sandov 
---
Me, because now u must see how stupid u was, crying before anything happened.
---
Ahhhh ok, i thought that may be it, but never saw the evolved pop up, so i figured it might be a bug. Thank you!
---
none
---
I believe the quest is tracking unknowns
---
New? Not at all - i am playing their games since daggerdall came out. 
---
However its ok to negativly impact a whole sector of the game to allow exploited items to stay in is what you say? I disagree wholeheartedly. 
---
 I can say the same thing to you only because you dont play it its not ok to destroy it for others.
---
Being humble goes both ways.
---
Also I am in the majority. The majority who did not profit off of duped items.
---
And was that your answer to the things i brought up 2 posts ago? Because i dont see it.
---
Exactly this.
---
I agree this thread is positive.
---
I envy your ability to ignore the many not so positive ones around here. Not all of us share it. 
---
Lol, dude, your attitude and comment is EXACTLY why the sub exists. 
---
In fact believe it or not, *this very sub* was created shortly after 76 was announced as a place to get away from the anti-76 and anti-bethesda circlejerk that flooded /r/fallout. Seriously, go dig up posts from a few months ago and this sub was 100% labeled as a 76 safespace/shill/bot/sheep/fanboy community of people who had their heads buried in the sand literally *exactly* like you think of the new sub now. Once Bethesda took to this sub instead of the main fallout sub for community interaction though all of the toxcitity flooded in and pushed out the casual players who simply wanted a place to discuss the game without hearing your laundry list of parroted complaints (e.g. canvas bags) or how you think they are doing something wrong for enjoying something that you don't. 
---
Same for me, load times are faster, incredibly fast frame rates.
---
Do you have visibility how big that sector of the game is compared to the other sectors? 
---
to be fair, the world feeling empty makes sense because it IS empty.
---
Who the hell would want to live in the shit show that is Fallout's Appalachia? It's got obscene levels of radiation in the food &amp; water, along with scorchbeasts everywhere.
---
76 is set much closer to the bombs actually falling than the other games, and our vault was the first to open there. So it makes sense we wouldn't find many other humans there, because they'd either be killed or would have left to find a less worse place to live.
---
Yeah me too, happy I still got my stuff, I think I lost a .50 cal, but that's ok it was stacked, I had 2. I also had a handmade stacked, but it was missed ... rather lose the .50 cal.
---
Do we need submachine guns and tuxedos?
---
We'll have a better idea once these updates roll in.
---
600 hours of entertainment for 60 bucks is cheaper.
---
I feel like people would've used the paper from books to start fires, and then probably burn the whole thing once it was going, leaving nothing but ash.
---
And get bottle caps after drinking beer....
---
I agree with you. I'm not saying we should remove damage altogether, just that the fact it exists in the first place in this middle-ground is pointless. Why not add some tower defense mechanic around it, and if the raider wins they get loot? Actual raiding, not just griefing.
---
got voted down or deleted :(
---
Funny. Since before launch this subreddit was known as the Fallout 76 circlejerk sub, people who got tired of the negativity around the game on /r/fallout came over here for a 'more positive environment'. Now even many of the previous fans have turned on the game/Bethesda, and you have people moving over to ANOTHER subreddit that's 'more positive'. 
---
I'm gonna bet 3 months from now /r/fo76filthycasuals is gonna become a 'cesspool of toxic bullshit' and people are gonna migrate to /r/fo76filthycasualsforrealthistime.
---
Somehow I got Talons I guess when I unequipped starched genes for like a few minutes. Not the worst mutation, especially since I am mostly melee, but I kinda didn't want it as I don't like the minus agility. Would be nice to remove it but I'll just keep it. I do unarmed sometimes anyway.
---
How do I join this?
---
I just screwed 842 mules! Wait no I muled 842 screws. That was last Valentines Day.
---
Ill add you to the community
---
Hoping they also fix the issue of some people's games crashing on start in fullscreen mode, otherwise none of the rest will matter to me until they do.
---
I'm working on a lore / theory video for the last 2 weeks on the topic and won't spoil everything before I publish the video, but you are somewhat close to the truth - or at least my truth if my theory turns out to be garbage, but I'm pretty confident :P  
---
I thought first the thing in lucky hole mine was Ug-Qualtoth but it doesn't match the description made by Lovecraft and it didn't feel right. Too easy. If notes are somewhat confusing since the entity is named "elder" while looking like a "deep one" (they not get along well together) my conclusion is: this is a deep one (even more with the human sacrifices thing)
---
For the scorched plague, records in Whitespring (enclave) indicates the scorched queen was found "already mutated" (most likely by ultracite) and enclave scientists conducted further experiences on it, probably even with F.E.V thrown in the mix. As for the mire vegetation going crazy, this is most likely F.E.V experiences from a Vault that went south.  
---
My theory being: F.E.V, the scorched plague and what happens to the mire are 3 separate things with only F.E.V linking them.
---
As for Ug-Qualtoth cult... I can't wait to share all the digging I did and the theory I came with.  
---
But do they in fact bobble?
---
Nothing better than helping low levels. Get ‘er done.
---
Die Preston!
---
Annoying when you’re melee and you’re standing around with your dick in your hand just picking off trash mobs waiting for her to land
---
I didn’t know this subreddit existed. That’s great
---
1.look harder
---
2. Server hop
---
3. This post is 3 month old. 
---
Haha yea, at least you can take care of the adds while the ranged draw her down 
---
How about some syringer ammo that cures mutations. Come here Johnny Jumper. I got something for you 
---
Why 
---
This would be great. I have one or two I wouldn’t mind selectively removing and replacing. It wouldn’t impact on the serum sellers at all as I’d buy the ones I do want.
---
That only means less than 1% of the playerbase was *supplying* the illegitimate items.  All the salty "I quit" posts following the TSE nerf are a much better indication for how prevalent the duplicated god-tier weapons are among the playerbase.
---
You're not alone Vault Dweller, I barely check this sub out because I feel the same way you do
---
Just check out nukesanddragons.com. The perk planner there is great.
---
That’s just something you don’t see in Zone Chat in this game
---
If you would pay that much too get rid of one then get rid of all of them and spend 800 caps for the other four serums on here? 
---
That is what I did. 
---
Regarding number 5 I built my character strictly for PVP and you want a debuff me so I'm at your level someone who built their character for PVE.  
---
I’m glad you made this a post. 
---
On 3: this devalues the resource locations that have multiple of the same, and also I suspect it’ll be extremely unpopular with players. I think you suggested it to make it attractive to devs who would want things balanced, but I think devs have been overly careful with this. Just up the storage limits and to the victor go the spoils.
---
4: this is great, and the prize bot is a nice touch. I only want to say they aren’t obnoxious, they are quirky and amusing. Then again, I find malfunctioning dregs of a doomed world funny so maybe it’s my sense of humor that is too dark.
---
5: Hoo boy. You touch on a big elephant. Players can build to be too tough and also to deal too much damage in PvP. Devs need to do a serious balance pass and simply accept that there cannot be one solution for combat vs PvE creatures (dumb AI bullet sponges with massive DR and HP requiring big damage to kill quick), and players (human intelligence but relatively low DR and HP compared to the damage people can and have to achieve to effectively fight in PvE).
---
Either rebalance PvE and fix damage balance issues or find some other way to balance this. Diablo 2’s huge damage debuff vs player targets, for example.
---
How sad it'd be if you didn't have any hope for the game and you were still browsing this forum.
---
The hope is so much tinier than it deserves to be but it's there.
---
Serums went up to 19K with the last patch.
---
I have over 1,200 stimpaks and I love the reactions I get from new players when I drop them 50 diluted stimpacks and all the ammo I never use. I like to think I made their life a little easier for a while after that 
---
Level 42..I came across a 3* yao gui..was being selfish..didn't flag anyone ..dumped every last 50 Cal ball from my two shot black powder rifle (200)and exhausted all my mines and grenades of varying forms..almost 40 minutes..running up..quick pap pap..back up some stairs..finally took ol girl down..1* wooden leg piece. Gave up. Karma..
---
For the life of me, I can't fathom what makes people complain this much about a game. Some of the complainers have obviously spent hundreds of hours searching for, cataloging and getting angry about all the supposed bugs and glitches they could find. Who does that? Maybe they think they are being helpful, but after the first 2 or 3 people did it, the helpfulness rapidly descends into something I can only describe as pathetic and toxic. You're not being helpful, you're not being righteous, you're just being annoying now.
---
And to all the people bitching about the money they spent, seriously fuck off. It costs $100 just to get drinks and dinner for two at a decent restaurant, and most of you whiners spent less than that on this game and played it for more than the 2 hours you would spend eating out. Sometimes you spend money on a game and it works out, sometimes it doesn't. For the love of jeebus, move on and get over it.
---
The bitching is actually ruining the game more than the problems with the game are at this point.
---
I generally try to ignore everyone in the game I'm not friends with because I have no way to communicate with them other than those stupid emotes. I just find it easier that way. I'm not that concerned about missing out on a legendary.
---
Give it another month I'd say and re-evaluate then.
---
So, in hind sight, do you feel better or worse?
---
I'm fine with PvP builds, but you can't honestly say that full Assassin Sentinel sets are anywhere near balanced when they can effectively eliminate almost all PvP damage when standing still.  That's no different than claiming an extreme min/max build that can do 10k per hit is balanced.  It's not.  Plain and simple.
---
TSEs were nerfed because they were extremely unbalanced for PvP because powerful effects were able to stack.  The same is occurring with that armor combo.  NO ONE should be entirely immune from PvP damage in any situation.
---
there should at least be group chat or chat within earshot of another player.
---
That sounds a bit ridiculous.. I can see the recipes but not the serums. Have you tried the Facebook page?
---
Dey took are herbs!
---
Not saying it towards you, just that is crazy high lol
---
Semi auto Tesla rifle. Everybody gets a hit. Best farming weapon I have.
---
Sober as a judge sir... Looking for god Howard have you seen him
---
A random person I traded with had like 4 of them. He sold me one for 200c. If they're as rare as thus thread suggests I imagine he's duping them. And me being a noob he gave me a hardcore sympathy deal.
---
Bitchin about bitchin.....except you seem more upset than them. 
---
Not really.   Things are still disappearing, the servers still disconnect, although not quite as often, there’s a host of distracting bugs and the experience is still a tedious grind.
---
Check in once a week or two and see what you think.   Your mileage may vary.   So might your Luck.
---
Exactly the misses got herbivore and farms razorgrain at her camp to make soup. With one hot key she can take care of all her hunger / thirst needs. 
---
The answer is when a dupe is discovered they take servers down and fix. Not waiting a week 
---
Tbf, it's basically a choice between "drink the kool aid" or "NMA2 if Bethesda does literally anything imperfect"
---
Nice lol
---
You mean BGSA =Bethesda games studios Austin
---
Are you fucking fan boi/ Bethesda employees kidding me? 
---
Omfg.  That comment is such utter bullshit I  laughed until I almost pissed myself.
---
I can't see how having more storage in the camp collectors is a bad thing for players.  You'll get more each time you return home, assuming someone hasn't picked the lock and stolen it.  Most camp locations can only fit one resource node within their bounds anyway, so limiting it to 1 isn't that big of a trade-off for having, say, double capacity.  I have only found a handful of places where you can get 2 inside the build circle..  FWIW, I'm not including water purifiers and the like as resource collectors, only the ones that provide junk resources.  Have as many water purifiers as you like.  Their storage limit should be increased too.
---
Me too
---
Beer bottles yes! There are a lot of other useless bottles though. Wine bottles, bourbon bottles, nuka cola bottles, etc. I know these are decorative, but maybe they could be toned down a bit. Or just remove them all but add 50% more alcohol so it doesn't feel too empty, and adjust the thirst restore % accordingly. It's not like alcohol is super OP anyway, and the net result is fewer total items and a little less inventory clutter for users. Besides, does anyone ever run out of glass?
---
One hundred percent agree with you, man. I rarely visit this sub anymore because 99% of the posts are "OH BETHESDA DIDN'T DO IT RIGHT BOOHOO I WANT MY MONEY BACK BOOHOO BETHESDA MUST NERF EVERYTHING IN THE GAME BECAUSE I SUCK AND I AM A NOOB THAT NEEDS HARDCORE HANDHOLDING IN ALL GAMES"
---
Like ffs shut the hell up already, you're not the first one to complain. (Not you OP, referring to the crybabies) 
---
I've been downvoted to hell and I expect to be downvoted here but guess what? I don't give a damn lol, you crybabies can't handle the truth so you cry and hate on the people that calls it as they see it. Boohoo harder. 
---
Maybe research your purchases better then, if you're unsatisfied with yours?
---
I've always loved this.
---
I'll never forget the first time I saw this happen in FO3. Cars that could explode we're harder to find and wayyyyy more deadly. Good times
---
I'm still waiting. 
---
I get attacked every day I'm in a place where they can be bothered finding me. I either get attacked myself, have my CAMP invaded or watch someone else get attacked. 
---
I want the real Bethesda to please stand up
---
I find that knee clapping them with my CSG  in this situation works wonders! 👍
---
Same shoot me a friend request AvitarOfStealth
---
Well, it's one complainer less
---
No worries, just remember some of us genuinely just want to help, if a green outfitted nurse ever trades you while you have health damage, expect to see 5-10 stimpacks or healing salves being offered for free.

Us vault dwellers gotta help each other stay alive!

Count me in too

Welcome back.

Thank you for sharing

All my best legendaries were store bought after someone dumped them. I say, let them vendor. :D
---
So I'm not the only one who refers to Mole Miners as Underminers.
---
I like the theory quite a bit, but after the other thread I'm stuck on the scorched, beasts to recently converted being part of a hive collective...    
---
Hosts for a greater entity..    
---
The "not one of us" and the little phrases uttered by the human scorched keep reinforcing it...  
---
It's the "vocal minority" thing, you only hear about bad people because that's what pisses people off and makes them post about it. You don't get a post for every awesome person you meet in the game (and I met a LOT of awesome people playing FO76).
---
Then see point one
---
Nope, [Fleeting](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fleeting#examples) (Passing swiftly).
---
I AM MR TORGUE, AND I APPROVE OF THIS MESSAGE! 
---
EXPLOSIOOOOONS!!!! 
---
&lt;airguitar&gt; MEWEWEWEWEWEW! 
---
There are certain vendors not in Watoga or Whitespring that seem to have good loot 
---
It is nice to find items sometimes on vendors. I found an Instigating Harpoon gun. Pretty sure that damage would be pretty good. I haven't used it yet though. Also found an upgrade piece for my Troubleshooter set which was nice. 
---
Should be the follow me emote with a 3* ghoul being pointed at afterwards in the icon.
---
I bought this one at watoga
---
Also a trader. 
---
Same experience. 
---
Same opinion. 
---
That’s what I mean. Increase the storage but don’t slow down the rate or limit what extractors can be built.
---
I want a life size one for my porch,
---
Me need this kind of merch :D
---
Spoils is right lol. It's up to 9500 and once it hits 10k I'm maxed on caps and I told them they would have to start adding stuff that isn't caps lol. I knew it was a great piece but I had no idea it would go this high
---
Well I'm currently not playing because a bug is actually preventing me from being able to. The game crashes on launch.
---
However, I always enjoyed the game itself, for the most part, it's only been the bugs that I've had an issue with, and a few of the design choices, but none of those were enough to keep me from playing.
---
What do opossums do right before they get hit by cars? Check their phones?
---
Should introduce 'Protest Ghouls' with protest signs as weapons, the legendary ones have a chance to drop legendary protest signs up in the town in toxic valley.
---
...take the upvote and leave. 
---
I am not a raider but guess their incentive is to piss someone off and to let them know "I wrecked your sheit, now go fix it.....and I'll do it again, just cuz I can"
---
Roses are red, violets are blue, if you take a Yao Gaui on a date, you might get a few.
---
I have had really good luck closer to the oversearers camp
---
This is just super entertaining. I see a car that's ready to blow? 10 seconds later, Boom.
---
Agreed on the hyperbole, but same with the guy on the "duped items is theft" nonsense
---
Relatively speaking, you didn't pay shit for this game compared to what other things in life cost. If you're this obsessed with getting what you think $70 is worth out of this game, you must be apoplectic over the cost of food, alcohol, movies, transportation, cell phone service, internet, TV and healthcare. Did you seriously play FO76 for two hours and hate it and immediately want your money back? Or did you play hundreds of hours and spend dozens more complaining on Reddit?
---
I don't mind that
---
The people suggesting you buy serums mean from r/fo76bazaar or r/market76 . You should find them for about 200 each.
---
Yeah, because a game as a service that fails to hold up their end of the bargain after purchase is the end-user's fault, and end users who expect reasonable bug fixes and are upset when known issues sit for months without being addressed are the problem. 
---
Huge underground mines filled with specialty enemies.  
---
Giant mutated creatures that spawn after a nuke drop.
---
Raiders (npc) that attack towns and vaults.
---
Deathclaws that spawn inside nuke zones.
---
Giant packs of supermutants or ghouls that travel across the map.
---
There is a core that is doing more than downvoting and spreading hate..  
---
Some of the feedback regarding the TSE Nerf being excessive is justified...  
---
And to be fair, every now and then we deserve to vent..  The other day I looted a Vampiric/FireRate/Reduced Weight Gatling, best weapon I've found in 320 levels, and prompted was booted from the server..  
---
That's worth a little rant in my mind... 
---
But I get your point, there's nothing like posting a constructive thread and having the first 5 "votes" be down, for no reason other than its not more "everything sucks"
---
Goto the safe space sub 
---
Yeah sure, why the heck not. JAMMINkannen000
---
Dang, you guys make some pretty creative poems, the best poem I ever made had to do with Vodka, hardbass and Slavs (dont ask).
---
Where did u find ur TSE?
---
I think a lot of us are just... disappointed, and worn out. Optimism over this title's kinda hard to summon up, at least for me, especially around patches, because \_every single one\_ to date has caused more issues, seemingly, than it fixed. 
---
LEEEROOOOYY **EXPLOSIIOOOONNS**
---
Would be a funny gag weapon as every hit would kill you.
---
Bye
---
I've found the watoga one is great because it's more geared to higher level players plus they get done with the SBQ fight and sell stuff without knowing what it's worth 
---
I love the game and it’s predecessors I have 0 hope for these games. I enjoy them all  and spend more jours in them than any other games I have faith in these games. 
---
A lot of ppl playing Apex now
---
How are you going to be a silent don?  That's no way to run a family business. 
---
Suppose it wouldn't make much of a difference to have 2 inside the circle, since AFAIK, there's nowhere with 3 nodes possible.  I never suggested slowing them down though, only increasing the storage for the ones in CAMP to make them more attractive to raiders. As is, picking the lock is all risk and little reward.  
---
And what a crappy incentive, right? That breeds griefers rather than limits them.
---
That makes no sense. If these people have no reason to trade anymore, then they have no net effect on the in game economy....which means, they will no longer skew things for the other players. Dupers with all the caps they could ever want have no effect on my game, they might as well not exist. Sounds good to me.
---
Damn, really assumed it would be with the other neon atom ship stuff
---
No argument there.
---
Ditto. Great strategy at WS too so everyone can get their tags in. I was playing pied piper to a small mob of mid-levels, walking down the street of bungalows, knee capping all the glowing ones so they could swarm behind me finishing them off. It was a blast!

I smell herecy

LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE.

Would lol so hard if I saw a group of players carrying signs with stuff like that on them.
---
I have seen people dump a two star and not check the second effect that is explosive. Oops
---
Yeah I would like to see more budget as opposed to stash increases now
---
I've seen stuff like this before....  Just the other day my Gauss randomly reloaded with \~150 rounds in the magazine instead of 6.  Stayed that way no matter what I did until I went through all those rounds, then reloaded normally to 5 again.  :|
---
Canes are garbage but I'm having a lot of fun with my character, CaneIAskYouAQuestion, who only wields a cane while wearing an old Civil War outfit, a Lincoln hat, and a monocle.
---
(T'was ta point)
---
I am sticking to my word and giving them until the 22nd of this month. If the game has improved, Im here. If not, Anthem it is.
---
Nope.  As far as can be seen from the patch notes, it was all server maintenance to increase stability and purge the dupers.  No actual changes to the game itself.  
---
I'd love a World Series Protest Sign. Carved from a retired baseball player's bat, it now sends supermutants flying.
---
This was a genuine appreciation post. I've never used a TSE.
---
Got to agree. Thanks Bethesda for a really fun game.
---
Probably giants nearby
---
but wait I thought this subreddit was full of shills and only ever praised the game at all costs despite its flaws
---
SOMEONE TELL ME THE TRUE
---
Because they can’t prove that someone with X amount of legendary items duped them. It’s really that simple.
---
What they did was show duper’s that they’ll just lose the items if the try to game the system. Making duping essentially pointless.
---
**This is the best thing Bethesda has done...Woe to the Weebs who used mommy's magical plastic card to buy duped items**
---
Ouch haha but hey good for you 
---
My best buys have been at Watoga (lvl 25 Exploding lever gun for my alt), the Whitesprings train station, and Artisan's Corner (an instigating pump shotgun, found just yesterday).  Did get some semi-rare outfits from Modus once though (a BoS lab coat and a bomber jacket).
---
Of it flags it immediately they could make it so it's an instant ban, or just a trade ban for that player for a set number of hours. 
---
I kill it when it gives a prize to a nearby player, and not me. 
---
I'm not a sore loser. What are you talking about.
---
Some ghouls left, others killed. Not sure why ferals and scorched don't kill each other, but they don't.
---
The other problem was that people aren’t thinking out of the box here I believe doll laying was to be taken to next level literally by us . It if you loved nuka world in fo4 (which I didn’t ) you can play as raiders and be assholes on purpose !!! Or play strictly as the enclave and be a different kind of asshole !! 
---
I’ve been trying to find BOS role  Players  but sadly  to no avail .
---
I think Bethesda did a poor job promoting factions in the game especially since your introduced  to all of them early on. We could of been that next level gaming mechanic but there’s no incentive on their end to make that happen . An example would have been exclusive loot , weapons , perks etc. that didn’t require never- ending grinding to find .
---
It’s sad I love the game but there definitely a hate thing going on also. 
---
This pleases me. 
---
random server crashes are still a thing even though they've seemingly improved.
---
but yes, duping is still a thing. it always will be. although now it's really tricky to pull off and not get flagged. so people don't do it willy nilly.
---
It's not, really. 
---
In this instance, yeah, it's a little silly, but if you want to share memes about fo76, that's the place to go since you can't do it here really. 
---
In other cases, a safe space can be good. There are definitely cases where the toxicity of various communities can lead to a subset of that community just wanting a place to talk about the thing without all the bullshit. 
---
I'll give you a personal example. I'm in to cars, and I still use facebook because of the various car groups I'm in. One of these groups is 100% a safe space. You know why? Because that place is strictly structured to have sane, reasonable discourse about car stuff, with no extra bullshit attached. No politics, no memes, no flaming each other's rides, just talking about cars and what we like about them. Other groups? Holy shit what a fucking toxic mess they are. It's BAD. 
---
So yeah, sometimes, a safe space is a good thing, it'll let you get shit done and actually ENJOY something. Other times, like if you're creating, say, an echo chamber around a certain politician and ban all dissent of any kind and only allow circlejerking about how awesome they are despite Kilimanjaro levels of evidence proving otherwise, well, that's a bad safe space.
---
Hopefully you can understand the difference and what I'm getting at here.
---
&gt;-Language:don't care as long as its not constant or needlessly vulgar   
---
Wants to run an organized crime operation, doesn't like foul language.  LOL.
---
A shady guy at the overseers camp gave me 15 leader bobbleheads (5% exp boost) on the day the weight limit was implemented. I expected today to make those dissappear but everything is still there. People with thousands of items are the only ones affected 
---
Not at all, to be completely honest i am about done with anything related to bethesda due to the recent discrimination on their forums.
---
Oh and, in case you didn't know right now for me it's 10:24 PM. Maybe tomorrow, sometime before now.
---
Sometimes it delays count how many you craft and check how much you get inventory for surplus
---
Where'd you take that one at?
---
You mean a black hand? You know, representing the leadership of the Dark Brotherhood in Oblivion, the 'Black Hand'?
---
Roses are red, Violet Flux farm gives me the blues. Dear Fallout 76 Do you have any screws on you? 
---
Why did you get banned?
---
Genius 
---
What do you mean by this?
---
There’re after you then. 
---
Run. 
---
Read the post from Bethesda yesterday. It wasn't an overreaction, it was not clearly communicated, or they adjusted after the community voiced the consensus. 
---
Trading has made this more bearable.  I just wish BGS would make it easier so there wouldn't be as much of a need to rely on 3rd party systems like the subs here, PSN Communities, FB, and Discord to organize trading.  A cross-server COD system would be nice too so we don't have to jump across servers or both be logged in simultaneously to complete trades that have already been negotiated.
---
No I don't view "deliberately seeking conflict" as bravery.  Bravery already has a definition and I use that. 
---
I have a quad tesla, but I am not specced for energy ans have spent so much time redoing my spec to a proper rifle/sniper that I don't want to change it again
---
Same here.
---
Stop using pacifist mode. If you are gonna die, at least die fighting.
---
Also on xb1, I crafted ammo and all seemed fine. 
---
Which one you mean?
---
no
---
Convince me you are not a troll......
---
if this game was called Apocalypse 76 or something and wasnt related to fallout would you still play it.
---
I think glass display cases that have a separate inventory, but still require the use of stash space and CAMP budget would be nice.  
---
Alternatively, create CAMP items that require specific items to make and display (this would not work for armor and weapons).  For example, want a mounted Yao Guai head on the wall?  You'll need one of their hides.  
---
Nope, I only bought it for more Fallout story. That being said, I was disappointed on what I got with the story.
---
I’d only agree to this if they added protest sign mods, like blades or spikes.
---
I would join you but I'm on PS4...   
---
I'm ready to drop my first Nuke.  I'm thinking that Vaultec U needs to go first.  After all, their experiments with the other Vault Dwellers tells me that all the company legacy needs to be wiped off of the planet.  
---
We survived relatively unscathed, but that was because we were the control group, not for any altruistic reasons.
---
Yes, the Queen Scrotch Beast needs to die too, but she's just an animal and doesn't know better.  Those Vaultec guys should have known better....
---
To be fair, I wouldn't be surprised if only 10% of accounts made still play the game.
---
Ok, it didn’t make the noise....I so I’m not sure if it hit or not, I have Chemist and SuperDuper on, I should’ve checked before I started. Thanks.
---
Pretty typical to write a wall of texts while ignoring the simplest, most important detail lol
---
I get that the games economy is still effected but that was never the point I was making. The economy was broken from day 1. It just got worse. Actually it’s probably gotten better with the overflow as those items weren’t suddenly massively more valuable than basic items. The point of this was to point out server issues more than anything else. 
---
Big IPs have an advantage. But something new can still be captivating with the right marketing and fan hype.
---
That’s awesome man, I saw a friend using a catcher thingy that attached to the side of the receiver so the casings will eject into this mesh bag, that will probably save you some time lol 
---
hmm is the Gauss rifle any good I have yet to use it lol
---
No . Ill server hop before dying. Not giving them satisfaction
---
also on 1-29's patch they nerfed all of the events keeping the majority of the hardcore gamers looking for an online game to keep them busy 5+ hours per day, to a casual fallout run through.
---
If I have the opportunity to paint my power armor pink then all my atoms will go to that purchase.
---
I know eh... He wants us to believe he got banned for sticking up for somebody with a disability. The math totally adds up.
---
I was at a vendor earlier with multiple 3* legendarys with exact legendary effects, there was even a stack of 2 for one of them. Not possible for that to be legit.
---
This fix was a joke, and I am going to assume duping is still very much a thing. Letting people keep dupes does nothing but enc
---
i'm sorry what do you mean by that?
---
To recap a comment above, you can buy any serum you want on the trading subs for 150 caps each, sometimes 100 caps each, and if you’re patient you can often find them for free. So collect the ones you want and when you have them all as serums for 500-1000 caps total, take a shower and re-mutate you to your desired form. 
---
No. It would just be the same buggy pile of shit this game is, but just repainted to look somewhat different.
---
The only point to destroying camps is to troll. One person's pleasure is another person's suffering. Thanks Todd for those 'anti grief features' you talked about at E3.
---
The one shown in the reddit post, the blue town.
---
I miss the magazine rack and the bobble head displays.  But, yes, I also wish that we could stock shelves with things.  I built a shelf for my garage but it's bare because I can't place anything on it. 
---
People know it's good. Ranged stealth crits have always been good. But if you get spotted and go into Danger, your damage plummets. You also aren't nearly as tanky. If you're only doing PvP with bait, yea, you're going to rip people up.
---
Bethesda has a forum? How cute.
---
Wow another jump to a different sub. It's fine here. The mods could get rid of a lot of duplicate posts. Otherwise you just seem like your trying to hide from the truth.
---
We can't just ignore Bethesda's fuck ups. If that was the main sub the game wouldn't see any improvement because you believe the game is fine, when objectively it is far from fine.
---
Also notice how after this patch, they finally started talking about Stash space increases again. They finally believe their servers are stable enough to handle an increase. 
---
And if you read the next sentence right after, you would know that you still can raid people but you have to actually commit by actually destroying camp objects instead of stray bullet.
---
What's the problem here? Because I absolutely don't see any. If you really want to raid, just destroy camp objects and get wanted. It works absolutely exactly the same as before. 
---
Or are you here just to make nonsensical complaint?
---
It’s still buggy as hell. Keeps freezing on me. Enemy have spawned but don’t move and you can’t attack them. Loot disappears as you start taking it. I honestly don’t see a difference except I haven’t been disconnected yet. It’s the same difference when the game freezes on you. 
---
HMU tommorow.  PSN is same as here.  You may need to supply some mats, but I can craft some good stuff.  Don't have any legendaries for that level though if that's what you're asking.
---
http://www.lovethispic.com/uploaded_images/156817-Valentines-Day-Grumpy-Cat.jpg
---
Don't know what you want me to tell you. It's a bug. Sorry, pal.
---
Their database performance is already on life support I would be surprised if they could add a real time check, I also doubt they added a unique Id to items.  Time will tell I suppose.
---
For all i know they probably run this forum too...
---
In Fallout 3 there was a tunnel full of cars that was particularly epic.  You could trigger one car and send about two dozen up at once, along with a dozen ghouls for a nice chunk of XP.
---
Won't really change my opinion.   
---
The duping was the biggest evil from the get go. Just because of that everyone ran around with "OP" TSE weapons.  
---
That was the biggest mistake they made. Nerfing those weapons and even other things that were just fine.  
---
Wouldn't it be for duping, the TSE weapons would still be extremely rare and Bobbleheads couldn't be stacked.  
---
Game would be back at launch to some degree and no one could be constantly crying out for TSE weapons to be OP because it actually took that person who has it a lot of time or a shit ton of luck to get it. And bobbleheads should never have been able to be stacked.  
---
Now? I have no fucking reason to play further. I explored. I killed SBQ unending. I built a decent home. Made pets...  
---
The only thing that really kept me going was grinding for a nice TSE weapon. Not to kill every player, but just to have one and feel it against SBQ.  
---
(Mind you fucking again. The FUCKING bobbleheads were the issue. Especially duped, they instantly killed the SBQ. But never ever she was oneshot just with a TSE weapon alone.)  
---
So what should i do now? Farm for other weapons that are slightly okay but soon get nerfed because the next schmuck feels cheated if he was killed by xyz?  
---
Soon melee gets nerfed to oblivion. Then Cryolator is too op, because of the freeze. Then stealth builds need to be nerfed...  
---
No thanks. Were 2 weeks gone to see which direction they will go after that ridiculous patch nerfing not only TSE but also armor and explosive weapons.. but no.  
---
Instead we now go the complete PVP route, where people at first always cried out being killed without even triggering PVP. Now adding a game mode where this will be the norm and people circlejerk to it.   
---
Sorry but thats just hypocritical.   
---
Probabl gonna look back to this in another month. If they at least buffed the TSE weapons somewhat again. (At least give Two Shot what it is supposed to be and not a   
---
 extra quarter shot.) Otherwise i just deinstall it. Heck i somehow regret by now defending this game. Even though i had a lot of fun at first.
---
Look at psi trophies. Reaching level 50 is only 14% of players and launching a nuke is only 6%. One percent is a large amount of current players. Most people that bought this game aren't playing now.
---
I was just trying to look out for people that were being victimized by this rude person, I have nothing more to say.
---
Just wait until you are higher level and people want to kill you just for the caps. I was with a group of friends on discord doing queens, we had done 2 queens on one server and one of my friends was going through the third while I'm at my camp near watoga repairing.
---
And then the jerk appears. A lv 61 starts switchblading me from behind while I'm crafting. I turn around and emote at him but don't attack back yet because I'm looking for if he has teammates or is acting like he's wearing assassins sentinels, I don't want to fall for bait.
---
The jerk continues to jump around and stab me, especially if I try to craft, so I wait for the right moment and vats him with melee and he goes down in 2 hits, but he immediately seeks revenge. When he comes back, he doesn't attack me, he just dives straight for my radiation shower and destroys it before I reach him and squash him again. Repeat this a few times and yeah he lost a lot of caps, but he got away with destroying very expensive parts of my camp, and managed to kill me once out of the 3 times I killed him, so he got all his caps back, since I'm lv215 and he's only 61. 
---
Had no idea this existed. TY!!
---
&gt;If.you store them you can still place them even if you can't craft any new ones.
---
Don't think that's true.  I placed a bear skin rug for a teammate once, and after moving, she was unable to place it from out of storage.
---
Good points except how does removing duped items have a negative affect on trading? They only removed duped items from players that had large amounts of duped items and even still left them with 1 copy of said item. In the end anyone who traded for an item duped or not still has that item. Just confused how exactly they were punishing people for trading?
---
You have to be teammates actually on a team. And then just build like you were at your own camp. You can’t move or scrap stuff the camp owner placed, you can only build new things and move things you built. 
---
Because melee is still Powerful as fuck even if you barely spec into it. You're just giving us a glass cannon build as an example which doesn't really apply here. 
---
That being said, I think beth only needs to remove the out of place STR damage scaling. The rest can be the same for melee. 
---
That’s how I found a friend now I only play solo 90% of the time 
---
I think its a combination of things.  The perk "escape artist" works by applying a super fast chameleon effect for maybe .5 second or so to break enemy perception.  
---
I believe that temp chameleon effect stopped firing last patch.    
---
You can tell by taking a max stealth character in fo4 into stealth and then immediately calling up the pip boy, if you time it right the pop boy won't display correctly because Chameleon screws it up.  That used to also happen in fo76 but I haven't seen it since last patch which leads me to believe the above.
---
agreed good post
---
&gt;Lol, dude, your attitude and comment is EXACTLY why the sub exists. 
---
&gt;and what is my attitude exactly? There's been nothing mean said here so I'm curious about this. 
---
&gt;In fact believe it or not, *this very sub* was created shortly after 76 was announced as a place to get away from the anti-76 and anti-bethesda circlejerk that flooded /r/fallout.
---
Yes I think everyone already knew this.   Which is why yet another sub is just silly. 
---
&gt;Seriously, go dig up posts from a few months ago and this sub was 100% labeled as a 76 safespace/shill/bot/sheep/fanboy community of people who had their heads buried in the sand literally *exactly* like you think of the new sub now. 
---
Yes I remember those times but then the game released and was accurately panned. 
---
&gt;Once Bethesda took to this sub instead of the main fallout sub for community interaction though all of the toxcitity flooded in 
---
Don't lie to yourself and say THAT'S what brought the influx of anger the sub.  What brought the anger was the game being literally historically bad and obviously not finished. 
---
&gt;and pushed out the casual players who simply wanted a place to discuss the game
---
You were never pushed out.  You arent mature enough to handle criticism of a product you like and decide to seek out others who have that same inability.  In other words you left on by your own decision. 
---
&gt;without hearing your laundry list of parroted complaints (e.g. canvas bag, BGS literally AnTi CoNsOoMuR, etc.)
---
You do know that what they did is text book LITERAL anti consumer right? Just because you're too big of a fanboy doesn't change that FACT that they used a BAIT AND SWITCH tactic and attempted to get away with lying to their customer's who already paid.  This is called very simple business ethics. 
---
&gt;or how you think they are doing something wrong for enjoying something that you don't. 
---
I never said they were wrong for liking it.   Don't use strawmen. 
---
I don't think the game would be the same. Fallout formula, since 4, Exploring leads to combat, Combat leads gathering all supplies and returning to craft or whatever you do with the mats you gain. I'm sure a lot of games do this to an extent. I just know the Fallout formula  I.E. Screws in fans, Springs in typewriters = Valuable. So it makes it easier for me I don't think Battlecry (BGS Austin) could make a game that similar to fallout survival without drawing a direct comparison to it. Plus BGS gave them the IP to specifically make an Online game. I guess my argument is this game would not be anywhere close to the look, the gathering of MATS, to even armor and enchantments if it didn't at least have the FO4 DNA in it. So therefore i could NOT tell you what this game would be like without the Fallout IP
---
Damn OP, in a single post you managed to play:
---
* The "Get a life" card
---
* The "It's just a game" card
---
* The "I have a job" card
---
* The holier than thou "I *could* cheat, but I don't"! card.
---
* The "I have better shit to do, but am making this contradictory dumbfuck post anyway" card
---
* The gatekeeping "people with high game time aren't allowed to criticize the game" card
---
and my personal favorite, the almighty
---
* "This community is super toxic!" card, within a post so toxic it'll give most people that had the misfortune of reading it cancer.
---
Be something alright me thinks to introduce seasons for those who want. Not just pvp server but opt in to new toons and see what you can pull off within 3 months. Toon goes to regular after. Kinda like diabs 3 but less everyone has a phone
---
Effect - Flatulence. You randomly make noise, alerting nearby enemies. Duration - 1hr. 
---
Kinda joking, but not really. If alcohol makes me drunk, beans should make me fart. 
---
As long as I know it’s a bug and not some shit I was doing wrong then it’s whatever.  
---
Thanks, bud. 
---
We don’t. The rules say not to bash other users or communities.
---
here is an example of a player double, triple posting with no course of action by bethesda.
---
this  [**Zymn**](https://bethesda.net/community/user/zymn) guy acts like he runs the forums and can double post, triple post however he wants...
---
[https://bethesda.net/community/topic/322771/all-my-items-gone/21?language%5B%5D=en&amp;lang=en-US&amp;page=2](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/322771/all-my-items-gone/21?language%5B%5D=en&amp;lang=en-US&amp;page=2)
---
Even more aggravating is when you pick up a base version of that weapon and the game decides that THAT is the one you want to use.
---
Besthedia would go after anyone that stole material from their games but is totally fine with stealing other people's stuff
---
I don't want to be that guy spreading conspiracy bullshit, but I have to imagine that a good portion of the posts in this sub were written by Bethesda employees. Just doesn't make sense how anyone could be truly happy playing this game. I've been lurking in this sub, tracking every patch and change, watching streams and playthroughs, just waiting for the game to become playable before I buy it. At this point, I just can't find an entertaining aspect of the game, that would entice me into playing. If I get the urge to experience a fallout, I'll stick to my heavily modified fallout 4.
---
To be fair, the modding community has found the issues to MANY issues in this and previous games. They even fixed most of them. But Bethesda won’t use any of their code. Which I don’t know why. It’s free to use by anyone so they wouldn’t have much, if any legal ramifications against it
---
Nah, it’s definitely in good faith. It’s not an exact quote, and besides, it immortalizes it in a game forever. References to pop culture =/= stealing 
---
I disagree you get spotted, You still have card that gives your CRIT's at I believe +40% damage so i assume 2.4x damage if  NOT more. On Top of Crit Savvy and Four leaf clover, You can't tap the crit button as fast as it fills. With a stock automatic handmade you are doing damage not another 2.4x (with sneak) on top of that but enough.
---
I’ll admit it. 
---
I paid 10 dollars via Venmo for a 2 shot explosive Gatling gun. After that the game was too easy and I stoped playing. Honestly if they took it away I wouldn’t be heart broken. I just watch this sub for updates on the game’s current state. 
---
That felt good to get off my chest. 
---
I think you're getting overly triggered by a mere question, bud. I'm asking what the point of it is, mechanically. Are you going to answer the question or are you going to keep playing victim and complain I'm bullying you for asking something on a thread?
---
You must be trolling me. I would hope you know better at this point in your life. Complaining always has negative connotations associated with it because it is, by its very definition, negative. "Complaining" has two definitions, one (the one applicable here) is:   "to express grief, pain, or discontent".  Then, take a look at the synonyms of the word, all have negative associations. It doesn't take much to figure it out, if you don't already know.
---
Pointing out a flaw in something does NOT equal complaining. I have no idea how you could not know this. I'm not saying that to be mean, I truly am at a loss concerning it. 
---
However, seeing as how you aren't aware of this, it must mean you are a very negatively-focused person.
---
Have you not yet observed the physical reality and realized there are both positives and negatives to 100% of it? And that in the middle is the only place to find any harmony? I guess not, but I hope you do.
---
I'm not even going to reply to the rest - it's too laughable. My previous post expressed the answer to your question - you just missed it.
---
Be well
---
The problem with raiding is you get nothing from the destruction. It's easier to just level everything. There needs to be specialty CAMP items that give rare, super resources, like a Glowing Mutfruit tree or some such thing. Requires flux to initially build and requires unstable stuff to kick off the creation process. Simply starting the process will trigger multiple waves of enemies over the course of the build to make it risky even if raiders aren't going to show up.
---
Raiders would be encouraged to scout a base to look for these rare resources and plan an attack for when they could capture the resources. Players will need to stick around and guard the process or risk losing the investment.
---
When I use the "come here" emote, it means please stop running around inside the golf club checking the same corpses for the 10th time, and come wait next to me behind the front wheels of the bus or further so that I can respawn the mobs with my alt. I don't see how this isn't clearly understood.. Such a well thought out arsenal of emotes and overall communication system is just lost on most people, I guess.
---
I found a One-Shot-Explosive 5.56 machine gun.  I've also found a couple of Two-shot, non-explosives, one of which is a furious hand-made rife.  It's my new favorite toy.  
---
The only TSE shotgun that I have came from a casual trade with a neighbor who had his camp near mine and who had an extra one.  
---
Bethedia? Come on dude. 
---
I think you can buy from whitespring
---
Awesome, sent ya a friend request
---
Just the cap unfortunately 
---
This sounds so entitled and passive aggressive lmao
---
no problem.. thanks for trying
---
I just did some research and come to find out that bethesda does not own reddit. Anything i say here can not reflect upon my game account. I will make a note of this.
---
Thanks for sharing! 
---
I concur!
---
Ive put damage in and gotten no loot from her body a few times. Same with other legendary enemies even ones i killed by myself. Its annoying but it happens every now and again. Just the other night spent 5 mins trying to kill a regular SB and it disappeared the second it hit the ground. 
---
Got it and accepted (PSN Mobile).  I'll be on around 8:00am or so most likely.  
---
Your welcome
---
Glass clannon is relative You run X0-1 or T51-B at 200% repair you have SERIOUS Damage reduction so no need to Spec into those useless DR increase perks in STR. I never spec in Endurance and can hardly call my main with 2 E a glass cannon. I don't think melee needs a nerf since you need to Get close and in PVP if I'm sneaking critting you especially in survival you will never know Who did it and be forced to spawn at your camp and think "Where the EFF did i get shot?!" But that's my theory. 
---
Way to completely miss the point.
---
Timezone?
---
Because "$60 AAA game with mtx, Bethesda should run the servers and continue the development of the game forever for free. I don't like/can't afford the content and neither should you. $18 dollars for a power armor paint job that doesn't affect game play in anyway but I need it or something because why else would I care!? The game is buggy and they aren't fixing it fast enough so this company whose sole purpose is to make money shouldn't be allowed to try and accomplish that goal. Etc"
---
I think I hit most of the totally valid arguments people have against others spending money in the shop.
---
Eastern. (GMT-5)
---
No, there's a 100% chance you will never know
---
I'm patiently waiting for the day that they fix this so I can return to this game. If only I could install an unofficial patch for PS4 for this. Can't play a Bethesda title without the unofficial patches on PC.
---
My primary account (lvl 160, bloodied melee) has started getting bloodied swing speed drops from the SBQ (x2 so hardly a trend)
---
See ya then
---
Sorry, but no. Other offensive methods need to be buffed. I feel there are some areas of opportunity for ranged weapons, VATS excluded. I think VATS should be the sugar on top.
---
I think of it this way: low health melee is strong, we all know this. But if you want to roll a high health ranged build, VATS should be the 'low health' alternative in order to place you on equal ground to a low health melee build.
---
Roses are Red, Scorch Beasts do yelp,
---
General, another settlement needs help.
---
If fallout 4 was spawning level 100+ power armor clad raiders outside of vault 111 making it impossible to do the very simple act of getting to sanctuary hills, yes, yes I would call that griefing. But that would be the developers griefing us.
---
I have used mine on SBQ for 3 months now.  It breaks after 5 min but seems to hurt her a fair bit.
---
Check Watoga High School
---
There is a back room filled with kickballs
---
I have a feeling there is a baseball outfit there
---
Couldn’t have said this any better
---
It's called a typo. Welcome to keyboard.
---
I had this very problem last night so I gave up playing.  Glad it’s fixed so I can log back in.
---
How they ended up doing it was good -- but when I wrote this, it was before the patch, not after, and everyone was under the impression that all duped items would be removed. So, going by that, THIS is how removing every single duped item would have hurt trade:
---
If people had no way of knowing if the item they were trading for could be removed from their inventory, that's not much of an incentive to trade. If I spent a lot of time farming (which I do) and came up with an amazing gatling gun which I wasn't something that I was spec'ed to use, I'd be very hesitant to trade it for an equal 2h weapon that I would use not knowing if perhaps next week the new weapon would be removed from my inventory.
---
Yeah, [because this thread isn't a passive aggressive jab whatsoever about any other subs](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/aqpixe/thats_it_after_300_hours_im_just_gonna_have_to/)
---
I have a lot of fun with game... Playing it from release and now i have around 400hoirs of game play... Game have problems.. Some minor, some major, but still its fun if you have some friends to play with.
---
And yet i can go rage quit easilly, because some problems of game are not funny 😁
---
Now i look forward to roadmap for the game and Hope in better days for everyone
---
Nah man, if you had 300 you were just an independent security force, but if you had 3000...
---
It wasn't just a crash - it was a rollback.
---
That's caused by active duping - only a few hours after Bethesda took a big bite out of them. 
---
Roses are red 
---
violets are blue 
---
this game was dead before it came out  
---
so go play destiny 2
---
That's a bandaid fix
---
Empath isn't broken -- empath is really terrible for a solo player, and I don't think great for a group player unless the entire group has empath and strange by the numbers.
---
Good read thanks for posting
---
Nothing gives you the right to tell me what I do and don't need. If I have 10,000 containers of salt, hey maybe that lets me sleep at night, alright?
---
Just no. Maybe you find it fun to one shot every single enemy in the game but that shit is boring as hell for most people. There are plenty of other games can go play god mode in fallout 76 doesn't have to be one of them.
---
It looks they make some work on failing mutations and stacking adrenalin perk, but i need to test it more to confirm
---
Exactly, you took what I said and explained it 10x better! If Bethesda doesn't want us to grief, why include CAMP damage that is a breeding ground for griefers? If Bethesda wants includes CAMP damage, why not do something with it instead of half ass it? I feel like they did that with a lot of things in this game, where surface level things are interesting, but when you dig in you question why it exists at all, why they didn't add some depth to a mechanic that is otherwise pointless.
---
Honestly can't speak for your case, bit from my experience, a friend put down about 20-30 brick walls for me as I didn't have the plans on my new character. I ended up moving my base and I had all the brick walls stored and was able to replace them, I still have them stored now.
---
From what i remember though I tried scrapping one and it didn't give me anything back. 
---
So perhaps it's just a bug I had, or maybe it only works with walls? 
---
So what are the perks and gear for this build would you say?
---
I just want the blackbird skin to come back.
---
And add some skins for excavator and raider armor ffs
---
So if you kill something and someone else shoots it just one, they get the loot also? There have been times when I’ve helped out lower levels (I’m only a 35 myself) but I’ve ended up taking all the loot then feel bad not thinking they get any, even though they made an attempt. I’ve left them with nothing so I drop a stimpak or sutin to make up for it
---
Need some Jedi hope.
---
Yes but just bc of the West Virginia setting 
---
Lol okay dude. They've been putting out regular patches but it's whatever I guess. Be salty. 
---
That would be a sweet role
---
I understand how it could have hurt trade but since last night Bethesda had made it clear they weren't doing it that way. If people just read what was said instead of jumping to ridiculous conclusions "everybody" wouldn't have had been throwing a fit. I appreciate the explanation though.
---
Almost all of us play the game, and we want it to succeed, but in a lot of people's opinion it needs serious work. I am glad you have no complaints, but a lot of us do, and we feel rightfully so. 
---
When Bethesda does things right, the sub is positive about them. When Bethesda screws up, the sub is negative. And Bethesda has done a lot of things wrong, and continues to do a lot wrong. We will keep complaining about them until they stop.
---
Not me. I had enough supplies to make four MIRVs and three grape mentats; wound up with double that!
---
Same as above, if you were on PC I'd totally be up to help you through the entire enclave thing.
---
Dropping the first nuke is fun! I just did a few days ago. Also on PS4!
---
Ugh, just tried it again and it’s not working ..... my server kicked me, maybe it’ll work on the new one 
---
It's impossible for me to pass by a car and not blow it up.
---
Agreed, str is the only special stats that directly effects a weapons damage. This needs to be put in line with the other by removing that bonus damage, or adding bonus damage to perception, agility, and the weapons those effect. 
---
Everyone gets their own loot as long as they hit it once. Same for XP so always try to let others get hits in also if you're playing around others.
---
The most frustrating thing you can do is one shot a legendary because nobody else gets loot.
---
I was giving out plans. Kinda like Valentine cards.
---
To:*Player Name*
---
"We know what you did."
---
From:Todd Howard 
---
That vendor thing was happening to me a lot before the patch, especially when server hopping. So at least it's not a new issue.
---
Yeah mine also delays but its working
---
I’m not falling for this again, Todd. 
---
But what *did you get banned for?*
---
Possibly depending on the how different it was exactly. But most likely not. Being fallout definitely makes a lot of the games problems a lot more easy to overlook. 
---
Ok then
---
I agree completely! The ignorance of the toxic ones knows no bounds. 
---
Sooooo... your complaint is that they post a lot and supposedly harass people (didn’t see any harassment through the link you provided). As well as that you got banned, though why you got banned is unclear
---
If you want sympathy or something you’re gonna have to add more details
---
Actually, no, they didn't, which is why there was the uproar. It wasn't until after the patch or hotfix or whatever they called it that they actually said what they were doing and how limited it was.
---
Ps4 by chance? Come take a look. No pvp jus so you can see. I'm still playin with dif ideas and setups so it may change again
---
Yeah definitely, I always run Cola Nut 2 unless I have to slot something else for a special situation.  It's so good...  Health, AP, and depending on the type of Nuka, side benefits as well....  all multiplied by three.  A regular Nuka Cola is better than a stimpak at this point.
---
Uhh... Aren’t all the keys in their own section anyways?
---
It's great for what it does, which is 1-shot sniping.  The charge-up time on shots makes it quite bad for anything else.  It's my favorite weapon. :)
---
As annoying as this would be I actually think it would be awesome. Perhaps have it so it 9noy works if the player is flagged for pvp all ready. 
---
Would make selling/Buying serums way more worth it, aswell as recipes for them 
---
Ah ok, I'm on PC. I do have it on PS4 but mainly play on PC. 
---
That cheesy crap is what keeps the hamsters fed. /s
---
There does need to be more content.  Level locked dungeons in otherwise low level areas are not a bad idea.  Gives new players something to look forward to.  Treat them like the silos, no entry until you've reached a certain marker in the relevant quest line.  This is more organic and has a better look than an explicit level lock.  
---
New enemies are obviously needed.  I'm not sure buffing the SBQ is the best route.  She's easy with Min/Max players in the zone, but how often do you encounter them?  Before anything is done to balance her though, they need to address the bugs.  Having her invincible or just fly off in the middle of the fight is unacceptable for THE end game boss fight. 
---
The vaults could be very interesting if they don't half ass it.  I want to see people in at least one.  Perhaps sealed up isolationists similar in mentality to 81 (FO4) or 34 (the Boomers at Nellis AFB before they moved out).  
---
I've got like three certificates for a brand new Corvega now...  I so desperately want the game to give me a shiny painted Corvega that I can place in CAMP now.
---
I like the name. 
---
The first week the game dropped I had to unsub from r/fallout. It was a shit storm over there. And this sub is honestly getting to that point too. I rarely even stop to comment anymore. At most I read a post and two or three comments. Do you man. Not everyone is entirely displeased. You’re not alone my dude.
---
Hiding the past only makes it easier for future generations to make the same mistakes. Erasing the mistake erases the lesson. They are dead now and cannot be taught any lesson.
---
Go in peace my friend, and nuke somewhere with better farming capabilities
---
... and you can drop them and they delete as soon as you’re done with the quest.
---
Hmm, the body shouldn't have disapeared after only 5 minutes, did it turn to a meat pile and you lost it maybe? I have definitely had loot take forever to load before but the SBQ even if it takes a long time I always get at least something, whether it be just a bone for example. Past few times I have gotten plans and armor every time though, just took a while for it to load. I just go back and check the body/meat pile every now and then until it decides to load in. I hear load times on loot have gotten a lot better with this new patch though.

If I hadn’t had to sell my xbox I’d be down, I’ve made a solo attempt before selling and got about 70% through before armor was too broken and running out of ammo/working weapons.
---
It's reddit...what do you expect?  
---
I also like the movie American Pie
---
Late to the party, but can confirm this works.
---
There's trading?
---
You're talking about a very specific build, that works only under specific conditions. I can't get sneak dmg on pve in nuke zones because other people agro the mobs. Let alone never in PvP with a tag system.
---
Then you referenced "oh well, then if they are caught while sneaking (because humans are not AI creatures that don't pick up on your sneaking when you have a high LVL AGL), they can just use criticals. No, thats a crit build. You cant max out sneak, vats and crit all together unless you're willing to have literally nothing in your other perk areas. 
---
People are salty because melee builds work so easily no matter the build, and under all situations. It is overpowered, whether you want to admit or not. Strength increases carry weight and dmg, endurance gives you health. All helpful parts to the game. Agility gives extra ap, yeah good. But doesn't increase dodge chance, perception doesn't increase weapon dmg, luck slightly gives better durability on loot (woopty doo, everybody just trades anyway, nobody asks "wait, how's the durability. What luck LVL are you?")
---
Don't tell me it's unreasonable for people to complain about a system that isn't in their favour. Because I'm sure, if they eventually release PvP servers, when you're constantly being killed by snipers with 1 hit from far away that you never knew were there because there's no tag system. You'd be feeling pretty upset.
---
If you're on PC, our clan will be doing another Plans and Crafting Event this weekend.  Everyone will be pitching in, take what you need, deposit what you can.  If you use the Text Chat Mod, we'll be advertising there, or contact HeroJoker1992, Dasnomad, or ByzantineFalcon in game, and we'll be glad to help you get to the event and kitted up!
---
With maxed out traveling pharmacy you can only carry 30000 stimpaks and you can only have 5 characters on an account. So you think anybody have 4 accounts just for stimpaks?
---
Empath is shit, it says take 33% more damage but it's more like 330%. Since I'm solo most of the time Empath is a massive liabillity so if I ever mutate and get it I remove it then and there and then farm mutations to get back ones I want. There's been times I have ended up removing all my mutations to get rid of Empath because it was the last to go. 
---
Now if your in a team of 4 all with Empath and Strange in Numbers then it's insane the protection it supplies.

I managed to get one from Wallace in Harpers Ferry. Only hopped 5-8 times
---
thanks! but mod or plan?
---
 Not well done Bethesda. It's better than nothing, not by much.
---
This comment will go down like a Scorchbeast queen under full assault of the duped TSEs still in the hands of thousands and thousands of players.
---
This is a broken economy game forever unless you ban TSE and change the perk stacking allowing for ridiculous damage (thousands of damage). Anyone owning a duped TSE or god weapon has an advantage that no one who didn't deal in illicit trading (knowingly or unknowingly) will ever hope to achieve. Completely ruins the game for law-abiding citizens who didn't buy or trade for shady TSE weapons. Bethesda can't do anything about it. This proves it. Game over.
---
How does this affect the straight shooting players?
---
Anyone who legit gets a 3 star TSE (should be something like 5 people total in the universe) will always be lumped in with the 200,000 other players who got the TSE via shady means or were willfully ignorant. You don't question a 3 star legendary being sold at a vendor? You should already assume it's duped. I did. I'm positive vendors don't generate 3 star TSEs ever in a million years. And someone selling them to a vendor for 200 caps is not a little sketchy?
---
Go to an event where legendaries drop and guess who has an easy time bringing down those glowing mole miner legendaries, SBQ, etc.. The ones with God TSE weapons. Guess who doesn't have an easy time? Those players who are stuck using one star legendaries because the two and three star legendaries are now a 1:100000000000 drop or more likely a fortuitous game glitch. So the loot will go to those who have the power to kill quick and loot quick before anyone else can get in on the action.  
---
Greifers and Dupers won’t go away.  Dupe exploits will always exist.  The only reason this purge had to occur is that nothing was done early to stop 25% of the populace getting them in heir hands via online purchase, trade or simply gifted for whatever reason.  It TSEs became the beanie baby craze of FO76. The same TSEs left behind today will get re-duped or already have been re-duped and are for sale on eBay.  I checked eBay and TSE packages like “Fallout 76 10 TSE Guns Or Items &amp; X01 Jetpak Cal Shocks, Seriums &amp; Recipes” - $20 your choice. So more than TSE weapons have been duped like crazy and nothing can or will be done about them.  This purge didn’t do a whole heck of a lot except be a speed bump until they can start duping again a little more surreptitiously and move smaller quantities on a just in time basis to avoid losing inventory on the next purge.  Which will have to happen. It’s Inevitable.  Bethesda  still has dupe bugs out there and you already know they will create dupe bugs in future patches. The dupers got greedy and got caught.  Next time they won't be so obvious or keep dupe glitches close to the vest to avoid YouTube bloggers from broadcasting to Bethesda and the world how to "dupe stuff even after the xx patch!"
---
I can understand the slap on the back and wink given to Bethesda by players with grey market god weapons who get to keep them. If you rob a bank for 100 million dollars and the judge lets you keep 1 mil and no jail time you would proclaim him a judicial genius as well.
---
SOLUTION for Bethesda:
---
Make private servers the next priority and you'll have the unhappy 'whiners' like me playing by the rules with friends and not dealing with cheaters and griefers. Farming resources would be fun again,  Workshops wouldn’t be griefer murder zones, Events would be fair and square, and most important the economy on private servers would still be intact. Essentially let people opt out of PVP
---
SOLUTION for players:
---
Cheat like everyone else.  Give up grinding,  pay $20 get a TSE shotgun/handmade on eBay. It’s safe  it won’t be taken away (proven today) and that’s the only weapon you’ll need to win like the others.  
---

---
Battle royale mode is dope
---
That’s with the new restrictions. I’m talking about the original duplications. Also why is everyone caught up on Stimpacks? I used it as a reference. You could duplicate literally ANY item and there are people who would do that just so that they THEMSELVES would never run out of any. Stop picking apart everything that isn’t the point just for the sake of making an argument

This is some Oxhorn level shit.

Recently found a blue batters helmet never seen one before looks great with the uniform though.

So do you want silver or gold?

Maybe the lockers in the watoga sports centre?

Soooo tl;dr: more of the same crybabying crap that makes the new sub more appealing than this one. Check.

Honestly dude, take a second to consider how ironic your responses have been. *Especially* the topic of lacking maturity.... 
---
Ya no prob, my is a defenseless metal box, but it takes a keypad locked security door and 2 locked doors to gain access or by breaking my metal walls and gaining a wanted lvl as well. No turrets as I dont have heavy turrets or rocket turrets unlocked so no point as I see. Me with a wanted level and or sirens blaring usually brings someone in for a fight! Some are balancedish and some aint(I'm lvl 73) no tse's or min maxing so I'm not at best advantage as others are usin better gear, but it can be fun!
---
Why bother when there's no reward for doing so, you can't loot other people's stash boxes or anything, what are you going to do? Break a wall and then take a nap in their bed? Not to mention most people already leave their C.A.M.P completely open for anyone to utilize if they want.
---
You're not innocent though.  The only reason these super OP weapons were available for sale is because of a duplication exploit.  If the item only exists because of an exploit anyone using it is getting an unfair advantage, ignorance regarding the items creation changes nothing.
---
Relish, well rested, bobblehead with inspirational would be the best I guess. A friend of mine used full unyielding killed a ghoul with it equipped and w/o. Said there was a xp difference (int) but have test it myself yet.
---
They sell the uniform too, but you have to hop.
---
The Brotherhood vendor in Watoga I believe has that plan.
---
Thats where a high Perception build comes into play since my Map mini marker will mark your Lower Agility non sneak character on my compass before it does on yours. That is assuming that survival mode is different which i guess is a big assumption. I do think without a doubt that a Sneak crit team with one tank is going to Smoke ANY and all Strength melee one shot build EVERY time they just can't close the range even with the tag system. I mean RN on the regular server are work around to get People aggroed is my PA explosive character leveling bases and getting 2k caps bounties to aggro me... Thus my friend gets to work in bushes wiping them. It has not failed yet and I do not believe it will.
---
I think reason they didn't ban the players is might make the smaller playerbase smaller. They said 1% of the community were dupers, but what if it was way bigger than that and they wanted to downplay the problem; because if they banned all the obvious duping accounts it would lower the playerbase by amounts they wouldn't be comfortable with?
---
thank you
---
Right I’m outa here too
---
Dude is legit! Fast turnaround. Bought a bunch!
---
Funny that I made a comment explaining how it was going to work 24 hours ago after reading comments from Bethesda on the site explaining that it was going to work this way. But I guess the patch was already out then or something? I dunno, like I said people need to learn to read and not jump to conclusions.

Isn't it great? We took pride in being more "open minded" than r/Fallout. Now look how it is.

But you are not alone. I did play it thu borderlands 1 and 2 and destiny 2. All of them were just rush to the end and uninstal. After playing WoW for such big part of my life i don't like games without open world. Fo76 in online game with unique gameplay. There is nothing like this. Thats why i felt in love with it.
---
I do wonder if they will change up the mechanics on the survival server. I'm a solo sneak sniper and  I wouldn't like to be able to just 1 shot melee people from far. I like the idea of being able to do massive dmg, but if I fuck up and they start coming at me I go be like "oh shit shit shit, and try to getaway and find cover"
---
Mine is just on for area and push to talk for myself. It can help when their are griefers dumb enough to not have discord or didn't know their settings was set to all and not push to talk, it can give you heads up etc.

I know about that but I don't get many responses

That’s something which could’ve/should’ve been caught in qi/qa testing before launch. It’s a pretty big and glaring issue which has been prevalent in several of the previous titles as well...
---
Meanwhile my game was worse, but I think it was my internet and not the game itself as my discord was being a bit shite last night
---
Care to elaborate on that explosive allegation?
---
You may have speculated, but it certainly didn't come from Bethesda. 
---
That's Harper's
---
Melee is not OP it's hard to get into the Nuance but the people hitting for thousands because they have high STR (unyielding, radicool build, Bloody) Are low health you spot those Chars a mile away since they stupidly show health so if a guy low on health wants or is trying to swing on me I just "Slap" him a lot until he is forced to heal, either waste stims, or life he gets to decide.
---
What type of breed is he?

Panty raids.

You are a complete idiot. They shipped a extremely broken game. That is a fact

Lmao people downvote any negativity towards 76. Which makes sense as the only people who truly give a damn about the game exist on this subreddit. Too bad it’s the minority
---
yes but that's why rollbacks exist in the first place, in case of crashes. it's not the act of duping itself that triggers a rollback, it's through crashing the server in a particular way.
---

Honestly most multiplayer games people don't use mics unless it is like a competitive game or roleplaying since those need communication to work effectively and the community is more serious about those game modes. FO76 is too casual.

how do you rob weapons and armor?
---
\&gt; From reading the patch notes about how much storage space for items can actually affect the servers performance and noticing all the burnt books and magazines laying around I wondered how much it would affect server stability if they were removed all together? 
---
Seems like an obvious quick fix doesn't it? There are other obvious quick fixes as well that would help with the server load and not really affect the players at all.  Makes me wonder if the real issue with server stability has much less to do with the number of items  and more to do with other issues. They really are not going after the item population as a failure mode... at all. They claim they are, but the execution is so half assed and sloppy, it is really just a fart in the wind. 
---
Someone hasn't played competitive fps were little 12 year olds harass girls with mics lol.
---
I’m sorry but this just isn’t the case. Melee has been op since the game came out. You can use most melee weapons without perks for them and still do good damage, in some cases better then most of the ranged weapons your perked into unless you have some decent legendaries. Especially with the fact that many people take strength for the carry weight perks alone is enough to make most melee deal competitive damage.
---
just check ebay and black markets to get a rough idea. although by now most listings must be gone.
---
The sad part since BGS is literally like the CIA or the GOVT only giving there State of Union whenever there is a scandal or patch, there is alot to speculate how PVP servers will work. But it would stand to make sense that a high Perception character will benefit most since they can 'Spot' other characters long before others 'Spot" them on the compass of course. With the way the VATS build works you should by Level 30 when four leaf clover is unlocked which  is a game changer since every 'hit' in vats has a chance to fill Crit meter. Automatic weapon + Four leaf clover= RNG favoring lots of hits and getting a CRIT FAST.
---
commando sneak crit build got hard nerfed last patch btw...
---
I bought a LVL 40 All Rise from a player early in the game (who would dupe a LVL 40?)
---
Then I earned a LVL 50 All Rise completing the Mayor for a day quest.  my LVL 40 All Rise was removed today. Weird. 
---
Yeah but the people calling for nerfs to melee are not showing base melee damage they are showing bloody melee build damage and crying foul, so your argument just isn't the case bud sorry!
---
and in less that 12 hours the Fallout 76 market on ebay and other forms crashed worst than the 2008 market crash.  
---
fanilly i see fallout going on the right dirrection, let see what happens with the ne update.
---
I have seen the plan in the Lewis station too
---
There is the combat armor helmet,'rare('ish) I hear
---
thanks
---
there's a couple. combat, iron. none with DR, though.
---
the only one with DR was marine from the dev room. apparently there's a wood one as well.
---
Roses are red, I wish they were blue, cause you deserve something mystical, like a dozen, or two.
---
Hope things get better!
---
Lmao so because you could do 1500 damage with a tse weapon it should be nerfed, but doing like 2k with a melee weapons is acceptable? What world is this “balanced” in or treating it accordingly. Melee has been op since the game came out, it’s been a well known and discussed fact from nearly anybody I’ve encountered till now to be totally honest with you lmao. 
---
Bob, do something!
---
You must be doing something wrong then if my lvl 35 explosive shotgun one shots everything before scorchbeasts then and I'm not even fully specced into shotguns. That or a headshot from my lever action or guas rifle not even using vats. Don't really understand how much more damage than one shotting everything you need.
---
Yes it would. That turns all those keys into one item. Server doesn't need to track those individual keys, or even be aware of them at all, until they are used. 
---
Did you get the item from one of the mobs that spawned because then you got lucky, if it was a reward drop for the finale when you finish the event then maybe it is in the prize pool but low % rate of it happening, then you got lucky also.
---
Guess nobody will know sad.
---
I mean if you can't be bothered to go read what Bethesda posted on here and on their site there is really nothing more I can say. I cant do all the work for you.
---
In NV there was a car park with some enemies who chucked dynamite.  Let's just say it's a huge trap because one explosion creates a sight that would put a Mirv fatman to shame.  All those cars, all at once.
---
Dude, I read it. There were a lot of people guessing, and going by your post history, you didn't get it 100% correct either. And it's not a big deal. You asked, I answered, and /shrug
---
Yeah, I don't even use the melee damage perk cards since all my STR perk is for weight reduction and my bloodied knuckles do 1k damage when I'm at 20% hp which is tripple the damage of my TSE shotgun.
---
LOL the fact someone can do 3k damage at 20% health does not scare me, because he is at 20% health if you can't kill someone even with "SLAP" damage at that, this player base is a lot more unskilled then i thought LMAO
---
Anything that sells, sells for at least a cap. So either go high Charisma or never invest... at least in regards to making caps.

Real question: how did we get a game set in WV that didn't include a .30-30? Dies anybody at Bethesda gun and / or culture?
---
This feels very much like a backhanded compliment. 
---
Well when the server dupe glitch was out. stealth boy watch for a little wait till the dropped everything in the container and run up and take everything and server hop got 20 some people like that. Nowadays I just dangle excessively rare 3* in front of their faces and ask for a stack of duped weapons to "restock" the put for free I take and dip.
---
Powerfully condescending
---
To monetize hats
---
Pretty sure Reddit was pissed because they're fixes caused more bugs lmao, or they nerfed the fuck out of the game
---
Pretty sure the sneak part going into caution is a BUG unless specifically stated they are nerfing sneaking, which would not surprise me.
---
All of this is true, but it is Bethesda fault for taking basically 3-4 months to severely hurt and almost end duping. They should have nip this in way in the beginning before it grew into this huge cancer ruining the game. It is nice that the game can try to recover but the damage is there.
---
As I said, I don't one shot everything. I still haven't managed to one shot the SBQ.
---
I'm not going to argue with you anymore. You don't get it, or don't want to admit it. It's apparent you haven't played a melee character. The QoL is significantly better, even if I do die more often. I'm fighting *for* you and you don't even know it.
---
I only have 100+ lol, but with all nuka colas versions maybe over 300.
---
It's to late imo. They already found and mass distributed the most powerful items RNG can offer. Those items will forever be floating around the wasteland.
---
Hopefully a lot of those players will get bored and quit without passing them on, bringing the meta into a more somewhat reasonable state, but I doubt it. 
---
I only have to do that if I run fallout without the bethesda launcher.
---
When you buy stolen goods irl and the cops come knocking on your door, you still have to hand them over, because they are still stolen goods. It's probably not your fault, but illegal is illegal.
---
SO what's your issue then? Mobs? Your telling me your having an issue with low HP characters taking your MOBS by one shotting them all? If it's not PVP balance then what is PVE? I can see 2 shot shotgun being an issue since it can wipe mobs en-masse, But if your argument is NOT PVP but PVE I am literally laughing at that. 
---
On PC, I had the whole game crash for some reason. It was odd. I was at a loading screen fast traveling and it just crashed.
---
I think I have one. Just the regular western outfit, right?
---
Today was definitely the best server performance I've ever seen in Fallout 76, until I launched a nuke, not sure if it was because it was shortly after the maintenance or what but it added like an entire 60 seconds of latency to the server. Other than that I've been pleasantly surprised by the performance.
---
The joke's on you. 
---
yeah theres a western outfit and western outfit with chaps, if you got it for sure msg me back if u wanna sell it
---
It’s more so I see a design flaw going forward, where no content added to the game will ever be better then the melee from the base game. And when any new, more difficult content comes out, it may be far too easy when your a god in power armor 1 tapping everything with your super sledge you got 6 months ago. The game becomes quite boring when you 1 shot everything, take that from my experience. 
---
I fought the Scorched Queen a few times today can’t no issues, loot was instant as was loot reward.
---
I did experience one hard crash, with my client locking up, but I believe that to be an alternate issue unrelated to my connection because I did not disconnect, but rather my client stopped responding (which I take to be a bit introduced two patches ago).
---
&gt; that I'm aware of
---
I saw that subreddit after I posted that, it's been chanted in this thread like some kind of religious mantra.
---
Nice , where did you find this ?
---
awesome news 
---
*listens to someone whispering in my ear* "until this patch breaks more things"
---
oh, yeah I forgot about that
---
That part sucks but the real nerf is that you can't chain crits, which they specifically targeted towards this build. 
---
Get the All Rise and then you’ll be good to be choosy till you find what you want 
---
Good point power armor is good and necessary for nuke zones other than that ide say non pa is more viable in a lot of ways
---
You just need animal friend maxed out and a non-scoped gun, works for me. Try the spot south of Harpers Ferry where the RR tracks cross  the bridge over the road. 
---
Simply not true.  I just point 3 points into it and already have an AA melee weapon that does more than twice the damage of any of my TSE rifles **with perks**.
---
The 3 points?  1 in iron first and 2 in incisor.  That's 50% armor ignore from Incisor, and 50% from the weapon itself on top of roughly 300 damage.  No bloodied.  No adrenal reaction.  No unyielding.  So yes, it unbalanced compared to guns when a TSE with 15 points behind it can't even match a melee with only 3.  This doesn't even touch on builds spec'd for melee.  
---
oh, right. completely forgot about that lol
---
Bye Felicia. Obsidian isn’t what you think and the devs even said it them selves. 
---
Didnt know this or the trading board existed until after lvl 180 something. Was buying all my mutations from the enclave 😑
---
Im lvl 98 and still using a 50 all rise. Its gooood.
---
get the martial artist perk, makes melee weapons weight less if I'm not mistaken and increases swing speed by 60%
---
The argument is your upset YOU one-tap things? What level are you? 1,2,3 or 123? Cause after your reach 60 (assuming you did not get all the perks for the main build not QOL shit) Your build is done and you should in my opinion be VERY strong in whatever YOU specced into. It's not BGS fault people Built there char around QOL perks since they never play vanilla f04 survival and understand managing weight.
---
You should be able to complete Quest: major for a Day. In Watoga. All Rise weapon, legendary 2 hander. If not then go to Grafton Steel and loot All the sledgehammers there, scrap All except one so you get heavy Sharp mod and aply that to the last sledge. 2 hand + PA is very Strong.
---
I run the launcher permanently I start the game every time from it.
---
Fix: quit and restart the launcher. Login to the launcher when it comes up.
---
I might get it if you actually explained something? You are right though I really don't understand why you think all weapons in the game should be able to one shot all enemies. Like I already kill everything but scorchbeasts with multiple guns in one shot, yet you say they should be buffed even more. I don't think the game needs to be even more mindlessly easy.
---
&gt;  Getting rid of the overpowered stuff people have who have essentially paid to play will be a good thing.
---
This isn't happening. Dupes aren't getting removed. Only stacks of items that aren't supposed to be stacked are getting removed and even then they're not removing the whole stack, they're still leaving one behind. So all the massive amounts of dupes that have been spread around the community are staying. 
---
phr3k is right, it's Harper's Ferry, mid-western region of the Mire. The third shot with the wrecked trains is from there too, it's a great location. :3

If you run party boy cola nut stacks when it comes to nuka dark, 90% thirst in a single 1lb bottle ;)

Ouff man your digging your hole deeper.... I have over 750 hours on hardcore survival mods on fallout 4, I have 3 characters ranging from level 75-150 all with full min/maxed builds on fallout 76. I think I know my shit xD. On the note of fallout 4, check out frost survival simulator if your into difficulty. Much harder then the base game, also makes some cool metro/fallout hybrid story to the game. 
---
Yep. Got the regular western outfit. I could just give it to you. I hate the thing but knew it was hard to get. Know what it’s like, still working on the tattered field jacket and traveling jackets. XD

I want to atleast give you 10k caps, and shats your psn, and thank you

What MMO's? Because **every** MMO I've played that isn't free to play does restore items. WoW has an item restore system that's so robust that it's totally automated and works flawlessly.
---
There was this one overpass in downtown DC in Fallout 3 that was perfect for doing this. I've yet to find anything quite on that level in 4 or 76 but the parking lot at Valley Galleria is a pretty great second.
---
I am positive I can out kill you in a PVP server with your melee build + legendary in PVP survival with a stock handmade no doubt. Every. Damn. Time. Sure it's strong but not effective in open PVP just wait and see all the Melee char crying for nerfs for crits and sneak since, there is no reason for them to spec into Perception which if your not aware puts little red dots on your compass that our enemies. Since in PVP all players will be marked as combatant i assume which may be bad that I will see you long before your little incisor perk gets close to effecting me. Period. 
---
sent! thank you again
---
Holy shit. I don't think I have ever gone to Harper's Ferry...
---
I server hop just to do this over and over.
---
That would be awesome!! I like to claim workshops and use the workshop materials to play around with different builds and then I blueprint  them :) I like Tyler dirt track best because it has a nice flat surface to work with.
---
im joining you
---
Check the back of the gym/voting room in grafton school. iirc every baseball thing except uniform. but maybe im wrong
---
Any time.  I got it and accepted. Enjoy it! :D
---
Its way better if you are sniping it from the rooftop and snipe one when your friend is walking through it. I do it all the time after stalking my cousin a bit to tell him I joined the game. Scares the crap out of him.
---
Ok, I thought I was just finally getting lucky.
---
I did not do any events, but I did get 4 x 3 star weapons from legendary enemies which normally happens rarely and i managed to get all four from one 2 hour gaming session.
---
This was just prior to the servers going down yesterday.

also I'm coming to you

That's what i use bobby pins for. Also sell for 1 cap, weigh much less, and can even be used for other stuff. I mean, even if you pick locks all the time, you really only need like 20 on hand at a time.
---
Yeah that’s a good idea. Maybe they could add a workshop, with infinite materials, somewhere in an empty spot on the map. That would probably be easier instead of a new mode. 
---
Cya, Todd!
---
Yes, you only need animal friend perk card. I’ve tamed several pets before, but even though I know what I’m doing, it’s still hard when I try to tame new pets since they spawn in those “random event-spawn locations” randomly. During good times, I managed to find tamable pet immediately; during unlucky times, I only encounter other random events when I go to those locations. There was once I spent almost 1 hour of fast traveling between spawn locations/server hopping to finally find one tamable pet. 
---
Check this [video](https://youtu.be/Up97cMP7eSQ) out, it’s really informative and has information on where some of those random spawn locations are.

---
You have made my dreams come true THANK YOU!!!!
---
I do not see the hole im digging myself into. My argument is a sneak Crit build is going to be much better in PVP servers than melee. I'm just saying now in the 'base' game that is out i believe The Commando Vats Crit sneak build out DPS a lot if not all weapons. Plus the range benefit. I'm not trying to argue with you per se, and really don't care how much of your life you've wasted in Fallout survival mode TBH kinda sad to hear but that's just me. Not tryna be a dick.
---
Where do you get All Rise? 
---
Great, now I have the Blue song in my head....

*yawn

I was like level 130 ish

Tbh, probably not. The main thing that has kept me going is that it's Fallout and getting some sweet Brotherhood armour.
---
I played Conan Exiles for over 509 hours and it's a shit game. Time played doesnt mean great game.
---
OP why don't you go play the game and not give a fuck about the fanbase? Oh that's right, you aren't enjoying the game.
---
Don't do it right now. There is a bug that makes tamed creatures consume camp budget, even after they die/disappear. Guy I usually run nuke silos with has 40% camp budget consumed by it, and there is no way to get it back.
---
servers have been more stable today then ever that might just be from the stability maintenance they did but i thinking part of it was getting rid of those stacks of items so at least it did something
---
Don't do that quest until you're level 50. Quest reward is tied to your level
---
Ha. Everyone still has their duped gear.
---
I can certainly appreciate that.
---
Thanks, yeah I'm 57 so all good. 
---
But in saying that - are there any other quest items you should wait until after 50? 
---
Didn't they increase the stash limit?
---
Level 106 and I've never had an explosive weapon drop.  Got one from a friend, and 4 others from vendors.  I bought them just because they seemed rare.  Stalkers Single Action revolver, Mutant Slayers Laser pistol, a combat rifle, Exterminators I think and a Stalkers Minigun which I sold back to the vendor after burning through 5k ammo on the SBQ.   I also got my go to Suppressors Ski Sword 40 swing speed and Mutants Meat Hook 40 power dmg from vendors.  Most of my armor as well.  Nothing better than walking into a station and seeing a long list of legendaries someone just dumped.
---
So assuming that you agree with the other points: namely, that seeking a safe space is a cowardly act, that bravery is the opposite of cowardice, and that bravery is a very positive thing.
---
The definition of bravery that I googled from Merriam Webster is: "the quality or state of having or showing mental or moral strength to face danger, fear, or difficulty". 
---
Are you implying that the Fallout 76 subreddit is a source of danger, fear, and difficulty? I wouldn't.
---
I agree with OP in thinking that it's a smelly cesspool of negativity. It's like a bathroom at a third-rate back alley stripclub: lots of piss on the floor, it smells bad, the toilet is clogged with...something, and you don't want to touch anything. It's nasty.
---
But you could go to the bathroom next door at Madame Bouffont's Tea Shoppe because she's nice like that. Sure, the crochet doilies and pink tea cozies are a bit much, but the tea sandwiches are tasty and the other customers don't try to stick a knife in you.
---
That's not bravery or cowardice. That's just *common sense* you dumb fuck.
---
Thats during patch 6, next week. Today was mostly just a maintence not a patch
---
Oh. At least they made the servers stable
---
The plan. It does show up eventually
---
No. He's a bobcat.
---
The same - I won’t get the opportunity to log in and check till Monday - never traded the items and hand on heart never duped a dang thing. Guess I’ll just have to wait. Some really nice comments tho. A lot of hope and a lot of making do. Didn’t expect that as much.
---
A bobtail 
---
Meow.
---
Yep. I'm just curious if people can still re'dupe the one item Bethesda left them to their original number. And if the spring cleaning would be a regular thing just as a small annoyance to actual dupers having to constantly start over from 1. Since they haven't banned that 1% i'm guessing it won't ban them the second time eighter at the account that they might be just a honest vintage weapon collector.
---
I love your idea! Building camps is a large part of my end game, if there’s a camp creation mode, I think I would just stuck playing it forever xD 
---
Thank you guys. That video cleared all my questions for sure. Thanks!!
---
Agreed, but I only intended to address the duping situation. I should have made that more clear.
---
Who cares? No one will buy them now
---
Try to add a rocket
---
Wait, how did you know it was sarcasm without the /s?  
---
It's the reduced item strain from the removal of duplicated items. When the game draws for loot it's now no longer chugging under the strain of the other items in play. 
---
Based on some speculation I think that this may also affect item drop rates, because I think the game checks how many of X item exist across servers before loading in which might explain why some folks have had a lot of issue with getting specific items to drop off of loot tables. If the SBQ loot changes dramatically that might be a sign. 
---
I have a Ghoul Slayers Western Revolver
---
What if we could build radio transmitters and make our own person radio stations within the game?
---
Then a creeper arrives and i lose all my diamonds. God sometimes i still dream about this...
---
I love seeing these posts after the update. Everyone still has their gear and you are the ones crying. Have fun with your miserable life.
---
Keep crying, biatch. Please!
---
Re-read the definition of complaint.
---
It's not baseless noise that can be ignored. It's raising a problem to someone.
---
A negative connotation does not mean that's all it is. Hell, the two phrases "forgive me father for I have sinned" and "daddy I've been bad" say the same thing but have wildly different connotations. "Pointing out a flaw" and "expressing discontent" mean the same thing too, except people have come to associate "complaint" with "useless noise"
---
Complaining about an issue is only a negative experience if you choose it be be so. And it's worrying you assume I live a life of negativity because I notice that two phrases mean the same thing...
---
Glhf mate, you need it.
---
So, I've accidentally posted this instead of revising it for the third time, but I think this is fine. 
---
Ha. Joke's on you.
---
Ooh you care .. you care a Lot! And your salty tears are delicious. I LOVE IT !!
---
Who's salty now? You might want to delete this whole post. You look stupid.
---
Tears of laughter mate. Scammers gonna scam
---
r/fo76filthycasuals
---
It seems the Game can't even please you since you are quitting it. 
---
???
---
There's nothing in that thread that mentions other subs whatsoever.
---
I honestly think they have to add at least *some* significant content and raids. If they don't, the backlash against Bethesda is going to be a massive shitstorm and would likely hurt the sales of future games.
---
But considering it probably undersold since it was on sale for $30-35 a week after launch and it doesn't seem like the Atom Store is very popular, I would guess they're going to scale back their long term ambitions for the game.
---
It's really unfortunate because I love Fallout canon and a co-cop Fallout has been a dream of so many for so long and they botched it.
---
I can craft the under armor jumpsuit and the outfit jumpsuit. I'll be on tomorrow, just drop your GT and I'll message you.
---
The problem with doing a full purge is that a lot of people who got those weapons a month or two ago have built up their character around it. A full purge would have worked at the beginning of this mess but not at this point. The best thing we can hope for now is that in a few months with some of the new content and harder enemies will get a level cap increase on items lowering the value of whats out there
---
Who cares about "cowardice" when all we want to do is have fun? Is there a problem with there being a place where you can go and enjoy yourself without having to worry about people pissing on your happiness? 
---
I don't welcome people into my home who are going to be obnoxious, foul and depressing. Does that make me a "coward?" Or does it just mean that sometimes I want to have a nice time without exposing myself to misery and bile? 
---
I'm a scammer now? How so? I'm not achooling you on trading stuff without compensation.. do you need to be schooled? Can you afford it?
---
Yea ive seen a screen shot of it - it doesnt have any defense numbers just cosmetic. Havet seen any beside marine helmet and that
---
Despite the other advice, I'd hold off on All Rise until you're Max level.
---
Fire Axe is good damage but also very lightweight.
---
Interesting
---
Probs
---
I don't buy items off jerks, so no loss to me
---
I've got a good idea what specific items it was, more just the quantities involved
---
There's a grand total of like 4 places on the entire map a player camp can be built and have more than one extractor. Those places are neat though so it would suck to force the people who've gone through the trouble of finding and building in those spots to choose just one. 
---
same as my name here
---
Hahaha .. in your dreams .. Jerks are everywhere .. we have All the things you want
---
They can have it. I haven't played this trash game in a couple of months and have no intention of going back to it. I spent $200 for a less than tech alpha game
---
But no friends or girlfriend. Did you kiss your right hand yesterday?
---
Thanks, didn't know that was a thing. I'm in agreement with OP, jumping ship too.
---
What is "built for PvP"? Broken crap like Assassin's Sentinels? Cause assassins is AFAIK the only thing in the game that applies just to PvP
---
I suppose you also blame all white people for slavery in the U.S.
---
He's a Bob the Cat?
---
Lol.. married with 3 children .. you loose again.. also have my own house and two cars .. because I work.. are you not tired og being a looser both in game and reallife??
---
that could be possible the past few days (before the purge) the legendaries that I killed where drppoing just caps and some random material nothing else. so what you said could be a a reallity
---
That you wrote a big post complaining about being banned but didn't state that exact reason(s) for the ban. It's pretty cut and dry.
---
Welcome to the world of Online Survival 
---
If you're getting them into the trade interface wouldn't it just be more effective to screenshot/video the interaction showing their duped inventory and username then submit a ticket?  I get the idea of griefing exploiters, but you're still winding up with duped items in your inventory, a risky thing if BGS has come up with a flagging system.
---
Joke's on you. Your "friend" still has all his gear. Enjoy.
---
The Free States vendor is there, as well as some neat ruined buildings to scavenge. Check it out for sure!
---
Nah, if you had 3000 you were probably the weapon resource officer for a small nation.  But if you had 3 million...
---
I guess from now on, I will gank every brown bag I see even of I know the person is coming back for it. So much for trying to be nice. 
---
But illiterate. You couldn't make it up. 
---
In real life you have objective/quantifiable losses(the money) to recuperate.  In the game your only loss was the time spent earning whatever it was you traded for illegitimate goods; time you could easily argue wasnt "wasted" at all because as long as you are playing the game and entertained that's all that matters.
---
I read it as "I'm a griefer"
---
It's also made by obsidian, so 50/50 chance it makes 76 look bug-free in comparison.
---
Lel 
---
Yes right
---
Built for PvP is what I did.  I have no quality of life cards.  I also dont have any sentinel gear . I run unyielding / bloody. Works very well for 90%+ of my PvP encounters. 
---
That's why I've bound boiled water and canned dog food to my favorites bar.
---
What counts as being passive aggressive could be considered interpretable, but I have no idea how you get that from that thread.  It isn't.
---
appreciate it!
---
But no self awareness
---
You're wearing the wrong flair then....
---
I know the point is moot now, but what I meant was the guy didn't have stacks of stuff, his weapon/armor load out wasn't god tier, his post history in the market wasn't unreasonable and when I joined his server he was just playing with a couple of his friends doing some Watoga events. All in all the trade didn't seem sketchy in any way. I knew there was a high likelihood the weapon itself was duped, but it didn't seem like he was the duper... As I alluded to in my original comment it was literally 12 hours before the TSE nerf, so I assume he was just getting some of his caps back that he spent on it. For all I know he was a duper and duped the shit out of it, but there wasn't many red flags outside of the weapon in question being a TSE handmade. 
---
i always have way too much screws. currently searching for bulks of screw through vendors because they cant be crafted, but am sitting on like 300 normal screws.
---
toys, fans, writers/typers, toasters, hot plates, pepper mills, all give screws. pretty much anything from the kitchen that isn't standard cooking utensils got srews in em. so, if you see a kitchen, give it a quick sweep! also offices tend to have lots of typers/desk fans, which provides an ample amount of screws.
---
in wavy willard water park there's 4 toy shop booths. clearing them all out will net you about 10\~ screws and takes less than a minute (when you know where to look).
---
I camped directly behind Sutton for my first 40 levels.  I'd drop all the stuff I couldn't sell in a bag at the station(plans, fusion cores, ammo, whatever.  I was there constantly, as is was basically part of my camp and i saw a lot of PA frames and bags left for others.  Great spot, I might have to move back.
---
You’re playing it right now by being here. 
---
Ha. Everyone still has their gear. uou should delete your post. You look stupid.
---
buh-bye...
---
I’m just directly south of New Gad within firing range of the enemies and I frequently travel to Sutton to sell and buy legendary items :)
---
Agreed. As a result of all the duping that occurred, I would also like to see the future pvp servers have dedicated characters instead of the ability for everyone to swap in and out of those servers, but I can understand not going that route.
---
Yeah I was really worried I would lose most of my load out as I traded for most of my items with other players whose inventories usually looked like a fully stocked warehouse of duped items. 😂
---
Agreed
---
I would love to know this as well. Unfortunately, those with the answers to this question tend to keep their secrets ;)
---
I love it. Yesterday you were all high and mighty.  Today you all are crying. Bethesda pulled the old switcheroo.
---
Although pretty much every Picard episode is popular with fans, Darmok's a simple episode carried by two solid actors with the added virtue of having very little techno babble. Just good ol fashion strained cultural contact. The ending adds a touch of sentiment, too, which I'm sure adds to its popularity. :P
---
I get that. May as well get your money out of it.
---
My hope is that if they got anything wiped it would flag their username.  If it happens again, auto-ban.  Will Bethesda do that?  Don't know.  Seems pretty simple of a mechanism to me though, simply ban repeat offenders.  You get a warning not to do it again.  Do it again and you're done.
---
Just make sure it stays full, I can’t imagine u/MyPeeSacIsFull with an empty pee sac. You are doing gods work sir!
---
You just made my night. :P
---
I was high and mighty yesterday? I’m crying today? I had no idea...
---
This sub is shrinking in subscriber count while that one is increasing.
---
Go convince yourself that is because of the horrible state of the game and not because of the state of the sub. r/fo76 has gotten the r/fallout status of being a place for people who can't fucking control themselves. "Objectively".
---
Read your post. Super salty. Enjoy.
---
if you die or DC you will heal a small amount of rads when you respawn. So not running Starched in the field *can* lead to you losing a random mutation
---
It was a joke 🙄
---
you can literally come up with a random number because duping essentially means they're infinite. you can bet sellers were holding out on millions.
---
as for how widespread they are, just compare their rarity with the number of people running around with god rolls. it's statistically impossible.
---
Because it's a rifle.
---
Lol I love how ominous this is
---
I look at it like this I wasn't around here to do the initial bout of bitching I look at the situation as if I never voted and every one else did and they complain that I complain. I mean it's like this I didn't vote for the fucking idiot so I got every right to complain about HOW YOU voted. I am going to say the same thing when it comes to some of the things people have done here. I don't like the fact you flip flop when you got your way weapons got nerfed shit got removed. I mean you can't have it both ways you can't cast a vote for some thing to be done and then recant the damn ballot.
---
The Gauss is considered an energy weapon.  Designation as a "heavy weapon" isn't about their in-game weight because those have no relevance to the real world.  Think of the in-game version of heavies as what would normally be considered vehicle mounted or crew served.
---
The automatic grenade launcher is undoubtedly a heavy weapon.
---
Xbox here 👍
---
Bob jumps up.
---
"What now, you piece of filth?"
---
it's not like he cheated you or something. you get f'd over when paying nice, that's just how it is.
---
it is a rifle that uses heavy electro magnetics to speed up a projectile considering the smaller version of this we have in the real word is a Navy destroyers Rail gun....I would say it is a HEAVY RIFLE.
---
I just replied to a post about this the gun uses electro magnetic energy to power a projectile the smallest closest thing we have to this modern day is a navy destroyers prototype RAIL gun......meaning that rifle should count as a Heavy weapon as well and as such benefit from the heavy perks.
---
Yep, that's the game. I play as nice as I can to help other players but you can't expect any favours from players who aren't that way inclined.
---
😎
---
same here, i got really attached to one of my guns and i was almost certain she would've gotten taken away, i was so happy when i logged on and found her still there
---
Just left the vault a few days ago and ran into a level 100+ who hooked me up with a suppressed bolt action and beefed up my vault suit. He helped me get my bearings and it dramatically impacted my experience. I was rightfully excited for multiplayer to come to the Fallout universe.
---
Bruh. Please.
---
Garbage colors every day of the year is a tried-and-true microtransactions strategy. You are being manipulated for cash. This applies to many MMOs. *Here is how it works.*
---
You get terrible, ugly options available any time. Some people like those. They're worth some money to the company, but not much. So, you have these garbage colors, and BAM! Suddenly, a sweet-ass skin appears on the market. (This skin is almost always some shade of black because that's what people like.)
---
Here's why it's a scam.
---
1. The cool shit will almost always be available for only 1 day. To get it, you *must* put down currency (in-game or real-world cash) right away.
---
2. Just prior to the good item being available, there will be a handful of "OK" items that appear, hoping to tap-out your reserve of gameplay-acquired currency.
---
These two factors combined are designed to make you go for your wallet to refresh your in-game currency (in this case "atoms"). You will be out of atoms, and you won't have time to acquire them in-game unless you *really* hustle.
---
So, Bethesda is *never* going to give you decent power armor skins in the Atom Shop. Except those that appear for only one day.
---
The vendertron in flatwoods sells it at lower levels also
---
I got an instigating power fist at lv 40, admittedly useless in PA, but sooo useful for beating up scorched, ghouls, robots and Super mutants. 
---
Cupid-style crossbow skin.
---
Because what if whomever had let’s say 20 bubbleheads? Bought them from a super without knowing they were duped? Should they be banned? 
---
My team is used to go revive me when they ear a loud "boom" and me, laughing wildly. I'not mad, I swear! 
---
Heavy weapons outside of the grenade launcher are automatic. The Guass Rifle is just that, a rifle. Single round chamber, low magazine, high dmg per shot, scopes and poor rate of fire. Great for sneaking around, useless when you're being rushed and bonuses for taking it slow.
---
We're in a world with portable nuclear energy.  The only reason the Navy is the ones developing the tech is because they're the only vehicles that can power them and still be considered mobile as they have their own nuclear power plants on board.  Land based versions have been bulky and cumbersome because of the large power supply and capacitor bank necessary to run them.  
---
Coil guns are probably the closest analog and do exist (and weigh on par or less than the Gauss) though they're primitive by comparison due to the limits of current battery and capacitor capacities.  The characteristic hum of the Gauss as it charges is not unique either as these coil guns use voltage boosters to change the low level voltage of the battery supply into a much higher voltage for storage in the capacitors (the higher the voltage, the higher the amperage through the coils, therefore the more force imparted on the projectile).  
---
Exactly why I sneak and run away whenever possible to save ammo for when it is needed.  Otherwise it is grind city.
---
Yeah, I forget that people are assholes online cause they know nothing bad will happen to them. I wouldn't be so pissed but I had like 17 bulk stacks of aluminum and probably close 30 steel, luckily I probably only had between 5 and 10 stacks of lead, but I had hundreds of unbulked steel. Like I said, I accept that it is a survival game, but I had assumed that since I left his crap alone that he would leave mine. Anyway, if you see this dude, just kill, I know he doesn't have stash space because there was almost 300 pounds of junk.
---
Seriously. We had to flank that fucker. Five died in the process.
---
Five paper bags were also collected by me.
---
How to be wanted by ladies: steal her purse.
---
Haven't found one yet, but his gamma gun must be a lot more useful than mine in PvP.  Seems like it doesn't do hardly anything despite supposedly dealing a boatload of rads.
---
You've read about Survival mode right?  It sounds like that is what you are looking for, but I'm not sure most players are interested.
---
I have been searching for dense mod. Know where to find it?
---
Duping is not a game mechanic, it's an abuse which is explicitly forbidden by ToS
---
NO.
---
I absolutely did.
---
You're doing it wrong if you don't have dodgey perk level 3, blocker level 3, barbarian, ironclad, and anything to do with agility. A couple of other things will help as well. 
---
Instead of needing stimpacks you will need ap regen items but you are basically unkillable. Bobblehead for agility+ psychobuff+magazine reducing incoming pvp damage 10%, add honey for ap regen as well, and well tuned.
---
I didn't think of that, that wouldn't be bad
---
There have been several posts on this, although most have been hidden by moderators for being redundant.  Yes, we need to have unique 3 star legendary scary monster bosses for any location that is nuked, otherwise there is no point in nuking anywhere but prime.
---
Based on past experiences designing loot tables for online games, that's been my theory. They're globally weighted so that the game knows not to drop another Explosive Shovel or Shit Digging when there's already 100 live. It's not the most elegant solution for weighting rarity but it is the simplest. 
---
I've been seeing a lot of folks posting about how they're getting good items from events and enemies now and I'm seeing the same thing. Legendaries are actually dropping when they should!
---
one thing i think us michiganders have in common with yall WV folk is that we love some pepperoni rolls haha. 
---
keep it up dairy man, gramps would be proud. 
---
I mostly melee.  Get better armor, lvl 20-40 is a grind but you'll start to find stuff.  Check the vendors.  
---
IMO the best melee weapons are the Meat Hook and the Death Tambo.  Both are classified as 'unarmed' so you can't use them with PA.
---
As for swords; the best I've had and what I still use is the ski sword.  It breaks faster than most but does more damage than the officer swords or asaultron blade or machete.  The knives can be deadly with the right perks and legendary, combat knife being the best.
---
I can't speak to SLOW speed weapons, but the meat hook and ski sword seem to me to be the 'best' unarmed and one hand melee MEDIUM weapons.
---
That's springs, you need to hot up the windego for screws
---
A....shotgun blast?
---
Thank you thank you I'll be here all night.
---
I was fortunate enough to get a legendary quad ammo capacity combat shotgun drop, so at WS if it gets too crazy, I can walk backwards and blast away!
---
RUN AWAY LITTLE GIRL, RUN AWAY HAHAHAHA
---
Every time I hear that from a super mutant, I instantly think of that from World of Warcraft first raid first expac. I can't remember the name anymore. I spent months and months in there training new raiders for my guild. 
---
General griefing would be killing your animals burning your crops and destroying your home, or outright invading and killing you and your loved ones while you sleep.
---
It's definetly still in game. The drop percentage is just incredible low. I've found my dense combat plan sometime last week (post patch 5) at NAR near watoga.
---
Good luck! 
---
I just faced my first Angler, at level 68. Why was there at least 5 of them together the first time I see them? Isn't this a little unfair?
---
Do you know what would be an upgrade? I havent really looked since All Rise seems to do enough damage
---
So the whole “ dueling “ PvP only thing I heard was bullshit ? That sounds like Ark.
---
Are you sure? I got that trophy no problem and definitely did a bunch of Monster Mash events prior to it.
---
I dunno, rice with a lot of butter and a little salt and pepper and I am in hog heaven. I don't eat it as much as I used to, but I am diabetic now and so I cut my carbs way back. Have to keep my daily sugar allowances for what's important, Dr Pepper. 
---
Wow, that's my exact daily driver too, I've fallen in love with it. If I could find an AA quad CSG, or pretty much any other legendary effects,I'd be in heaven. I'd also pay well for such a beastie!
---
Well put
---
I'm starting to believe that its bethesda's response to us complaining about scorchbeast attacks.
---
Not a gamma gun, but did have a few scorched with mini guns recently.
---
I watched this guy melt a couple power armor dudes who charged him and vaporized my regular armor ass
---
that thread/sub is gonna be a yikes from me
---
We know what it's worth, it's just that we don't want to bother with player trading and have better gear. You know what they say, another man's trash...
---
I haven't played in a month so I'm not sure if they fixed how slap is supposed I work, by a couple builds were (are?) Able to outright one shot through slap damage. But they can destroy your buildings and crops and whatever pets you may have. If they did fix then yes it would work as weird slap initiates duels. Orbital strikes can level camps without a bounty. (Also maybe fixed since I quit). I got caught up in anthems demo and apex. So someone with more recent info may be able so sure a bit better light. You can not be killed or studs destroyed whole you are logged out. So not like ARK in that aspect but while online, anything goes really.
---
Will the railway rifle benefit from perks next update?
---
Yeah I mean there can be two subs. Also we can ignore their fuck ups for sure. Its a video game my man. You spent the 60 or 40 or whatever. Its done. You can’t make them change the game into your perfect version. Next time don’t buy from them if you really want to send a message. Bitching on reddit probably honestly does you very very little good. Its harsh, but there are people who just want to play the game and see where it goes out there. 
---
this could take a lot of work, not sure how it'd work when you factor in enter able locations being unaccessible, geometry, placement of different things
---
It's be better if for keys it didn't let you pick them up if you already have one.
---
Honestly, keys should just be an invisible flag on a character. Once you have it you can open the door forever, and no key needs to exist.
---
I'll take that bet - what'll you wager? 
---
Check out some of that sub's rules:
---
"This sub was created for and by people who don't want to listen to all the hate and negativity. No bashing the game. No bashing Bethesda. No bashing on the people who are enjoying the game. No bashing other Fallout related subs. That's not fun. Take it elsewhere.
---
No complaining about bugs. Feel free to post workarounds, but whining about bugs isn't going to get them fixed any sooner. If you really want to complain about them, go do it in one of the other Fallout subs please."
---
Its a video game man. One would argue that the entire point of playing video games is to hide from reality for a while.
---
I am indeed, IGN - Ramblingpaul
---
Shiiiiiiii, I used to ride vertibirds in 4 just so I could blow up all the cars in the Commonwealth
---
sorry for asking you another question, but do the outfits next to events have higher chances of dropping from those specific events?
---
Yup, I think this spells it up nicely. 
---
Nice write up.
---
Makes sense to me but I primarily play on consoles these days.
---
I hope PC users take note and at least try what you have suggested to see any difference themselves before arguing about hardware specs &amp; how they think things should run.
---
We're incredibly shit at big numbers. As they stated, imagining 1 thing is easy, 10 is a bit harder but manageable, they skip straight to 100, but I bet most people would lose track at the 30s. 
---
oh! Thats awesome! Thanks for posting this! 
---
He named himself "Notiorious", not like you weren't warned.
---
Unfortunately. That is why I had stopped playing mmo type games like 8 years ago. 
---
That's awesome! If I was interested in purchasing a 3D Printer, what should I look out for in a good one? What price range or models/brands are great?? I would love to make these for myself!
---
Thanks. Though, I think it's a bit messy. Too much to explain but no point in doing so. xD
---
It's good, man. If you're on console, atleast you can't mess anything up for example.  
---
And yeah, I think I've done my part. If people don't want to listen, it's them who are pretty much missing out.  
---
 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯   
---
Thanks for your comment!

Someone's never played Portal. Speaking of cute things, any chance we can get Liberator plushies?
---
Linda but not really I haven't played in a month maybe... But last I knew it was possible with the use of exploits to bypass the reduction of damage and outright kill in one hit through slap damage.  PVP IS intended to be mutually initiated but the way it's presented is awkward at best. You CAN kill someone who's running from you and hasn't initiated a duel by wasting a large amount of ammo (a decent bit harder and more time consuming than its worth if they have any remote amount of healing) as they can also just fast travel or switch servers.  On the side of ark let me rephrase, you CANNOT be killed or your stuff destroyed while logged out. This is only possible while logged in and you get a tiny notification that some said was nonexistent telling you it under attack.  Someone else will need to be more specific in terms of new pvp if there are any changes at all.

I always assumed there were no hats with stats because they didn't want people to feel like they couldn't just wear the goofy hats, like "I can't look cool because I need that +5 DR from Dopey Metal Bucket of Defence"
---
Got any more buddy?
---
Bloodleaves are red

Meet me in the forest

I'll rub healing salve all over you

holy shit i forgot this conversation existed LOL.. daang sorry....
---
I know but people may take that seriously
---
&gt;name something you wouldn't get a little bored with after 500 hours
---
Not gonna lie. Fallout 4. Skyrim. Oblivion.
---
Nice, thanks
---
YES.
---
Well, I didn't even pay attention to his name until I saw that my stuff was ganked. The chickenshit wouldn't even reply to my pm either. 
---
Seriously. We’ve already seen multiple instances of people apparently downvoting every single post on the new feed on this sub.
---
Just an update! I received the item rewards today! I set up my camp elsewhere and fast travelled close to the event and it worked! Thankyou so much for the help! 
---
An instigating Gauss would one-shot a lot of things.  
---
Oh??
---
See, you're plain stupid. You check my profile, see that I trade, then out from the bullshit generator in your head, comes the idea I deal in duped items.
---
&gt; I treat people like shit because I’ve got this ideology thing here, you see”
---
You mean the ideology called morality is a bad concept for a group of people?
---
Let's see if I can find an analogy that makes it better understandbable for you.
---
You have 4 kids, each of them working as a paperboy and improving their pocket money with that.
---
One of your kids friends steals a bike from another kid. The other kid's family moves away permanently and no one knows to where. 
---
Your kid paid the thief with some of the money he made from delivering papers - a good amount, but far less than the official price for such a bike would be. It may or may have not known that the bike was stolen, you are not sure about that.
---
Using the new bike, the kid finishes his tour in a quarter of the time that your other kids do, takes on a second tour and is still done with both tours and playing outside way earlier than your other 3 kids. Effectively having more money and more free time.
---
The police comes over and tells you and your kids that the bike was stolen.
---
Your kid now sits there with a stolen bike while your other 3 kids don't have a bike and you can't afford one for them. 
---
You have two choices now:
---
Either you let your kid keep that bike that only he can ride because it's small and he is small enough to use it, proving the point that stealing did eventually yield a benefit for him by doubling his money and free time and making him learn that what that thieving-kid did was eventually ok while at the same time making your other children learn that they missed out on the opportunity to ask for a stolen bike as well?
---
Or do you take it off him to show him and your other kids that regardless the outcome you shouldn't steal or have stolen items because it is morally wrong?
---
From what you said till here you would let the child keep the bike. Fair enough, he paid for it. The next day the thief kid offers bikes to your other kids, what do you think they will do? Of course take on the offer that benefitted your one kid that much and thus getting involved in the same crime. This time even knowingly so, because they learned even if the bike is stolen they get to keep it in the end anyway.
---
If that is in fact your moral stance, then yes we do disagree on this and I don't think we will ever agree. 
---
By doing what they did, Bethesda effectively said:
---
Hey it's cool to have duped items, as long as you only have one of a kind, or have them distributed over all your characters you shouldn't worry about it or even question shady offers made to you.
---
Maybe at least from this lengthy post you see my stance and why bethesda should've acted differently to preserve integrity.
---
I have my camp there. Just north, on the ledge 
---
Got. Sign on the row below, saying “don’t feed the crab” with a partial fence around the crab.
---
I call him Hernan.
---
I do feed him. Ammunition. He’s cute. 
---
Picked that spot for the ambient acoustics, the forestry feel and the way the non-radio in-game music just gels into it. 
---
A magnificent camp spot indeed. 
---
after lvl 50 was an average kill ... it involved 1-2 stimpaks and power armor; now I have all the mutations, increased resistance and damage, but haven't tried to kill it again so far
---
That’s nice but common sense and 6 bucks gets you a coffee at Starbucks. I’m interested in actual data. Are there 3rd party industry numbers available or can we only go on what the publisher releases?
---
And some want to be offended
---
Exactly how is anything in that thread passive-agressive??? Nor do they mention any other subs... 
---
If you think that post has anything to do with you or this sub then you've got more of a persecution complex than the posters in r/short
---
You being surprised is wonderful, we all love surprises. But do you have data? Actual numbers? 
---
Why though? You can get better legendaries pretty easily. My go to weapons are an instigating grognaks and executioners super sledge. The grog can one shot the whitespring bloated glowing ones with a power attack. And the executioners is great for tankier enemies like SBs.
---
Ah interesting, what’s a psi trophy? Where do i see this? 
---
Mayor for a Day at level 30?  Might be a stretch, and who wants a level 30 All Rise?
---
Backup food. But it appeared in my inventory after 1h from logging on. Guess it was a bug
---
Yeah I know it’s just finding the mods for I’ve also gota 1* black powered rifle only 35 though
---
Agreed. Come and be a filthy casual. Ain’t no body got time for this toxic bullshiiit
---
no not at all
---
as far as i know they all have equal chance
---
thank you!
---
Yes, they stack for each piece you have. I have full Unyielding armor (5 pieces), so I get +15 to all stats (except END) when low enough hp--my typical stats at 30% hp are around 28 STR, 16 PER, 2 END, 19 CHA, 20 INT, 23 AGI, 15 LCK without any stat foods or chems.
---
I personally prefer using guns in a stealth build so I'm not as front-loaded on STR/END as would be ideal for a melee Unyielding build, although some extra END as static stats on my armor would be nice (30% of 300hp is more than 30% of 220hp). I definitely do not have the best gear out there, but still am able to absolutely wreck anything and everything that isn't a queen with my silenced explosive combat shotty. I actually kill myself with the explosions (stupid melee enemies) much more often than I die to enemies.
---
np
---
Astroturfing massively since this purge. Bethesda guilding the shit they want read too. Effective.
---
Ha! And with your rapier whit you are obviously a master debater.
---
Get off your high horse. There are plenty of ways people could legitimately have bought a TSE without knowing it is duped. 
---
I mean, I got distracted by other games out the ass, but I definitely enjoyed 76 and plan to hop back in this weekend with a new toon. 
---
I have to point this out because it isn't obvious to everyone, but you're aware your views aren't the only ones that exist, right? Considering you've not even played the game, it's weird that you'd view ANY positivity with the response that it's a shill for Bethesda. 
---
ONE WORD.  Metro.. 
---
I have a 3 star sign. 1* 40% chance to receive a splinter 2* 20% dmg when dead 3*includes 3 star legendary bobbypin
---
Well, it server med very well from 30-60 or so, so I Guess to some players its a great weapon at 30. And since I did it at 30 on my first playthru I'm just gonna assume others would be able to aswell. But good advice from you! Keep it Up 😎
---
Bethesda support...? 
---
Not sure if they have a separate link but it should be this...

LOVE IT !!! 
---
Police your brass
---
What you just described there, in many words, is called **relativist morality.**
---
You might want to look it up. 
---
Or as I call it by it’s less sexy name, made up excuses for behaving like an asshole to others. 
---
Fortunately, Bethesda aren’t in the business of implementing **your opinion** about what morality is. 
---
My own opinion is that your opinion is warped, and seems to dish out harsh collective punishment to other player tribes, to mildly benefit yours. More broadly, it seeks to make F76 your game, and not everybody’s. I think you’re far for anything morality as a North Pole is from the Sourh. But that’s just my opinion of you, as someone who seems unprepared to respectfully share a game with me. 
---
Fortunately, Bethesda is in the business of building a fun experience for all the present audiences. Yours too. But not yours exclusively. 
---
Get used to it bud.
---
Is the game workig?
---
Kill yourself
---
It's also good to note that my 19 CHA \*does\* allow me to share 5-point perk cards with my team even though my base CHA is 6. The only caveat to this is that I must re-share my perk card every time I log out/in or switch servers because the game appears to recalculate your maximum upon login prior to factoring in your armor pieces and assuming base values--mine would be a 2-point card at 6 CHA.
---
I also must re-share my 3+ cards if anyone happens to reduce my rads and my hp goes up--commonly caused by either my troll friend who has a decontamination arch constructed exactly where the fast travel spawn point is located, or similarly a grouped asshat using Rad Sponge or any of the other "reduces your teammate's rads" perks.... I typically run with Rad Sponge on because my RL friends I play with most are \*not\* low-hp builds, but it becomes a problem (and I'm usually the asshat) when I group with the one friend that is also a low-hp build. We've gotten to the point where we know to swap it out if we're grouped together though lol
---
All that being said though, all of my non-low-hp build friends are kinda jealous of how badly I wreck shit but are also comfortable knowing that they can take more than 3 shots from an enemy before dying (sometimes more if I'm lucky and Serendipity procs more)
---
I have now tested it. It IS broken. The last two levels the first thing I do is look in the buttom of the screen. I cannot switch. Second I have chosen Luck both times AND picked a Luck card but right after and both times, the points have been going to Agility.
---
Rub the nipples 
---
I've seen those before. Never used one. It seems like a good idea but also flawed because u you've got this weighted bag hanging in the side. 
---
Because it just works
---
Or spent the time scrolling, if you will.
---
What if my dad came back after all these years when he said he was going to the liquor store 
---
Bitching. Bitching never changes.
---
I'm sorry, that was a Runescape joke, on their servers there's a black cat named Bob who's the Jagex cat and literally free roams the server.  If you speak to him with a catspeak amulet you can converse with him.  He's friends with the king black dragon lol
---
This makes me smile 😊 
---
Sssssssssss
---
O-O ^ohgodwhy
---
Yeah, my friend picked up Empath as he was feeling invulnerable, and proceeded to die five times in a workshop defence. I think there's probably a typo somewhere.
---
Eh, honestly I didn't notice too much of an improvement over previous days, hit reg is still definitely spotty with melee weapons (You hear the "blood splatter" sound of hitting enemies, but you don't deal any damage) but they did fix the SBQ inability to bring looted without having to wait 20 minutes, so that's a good thing. 
---
S3nd some my way, am having a hard time staying rad free!!!
---
This is happening to me as well, 1440p 144hz. Did you ever figure out a solution?
---
If I'm around others and they die I stand on top of it or try and guard it until I see them coming back and give them a thumbs up hoping they remember I didn't screw them over and sending a good vibe.   
---
I've played a few nuke zones with cool people that watch out and the game is way better! 
---
No, never come back
---
Are you on PC? I can mod that gauss out for you with all options.

Use something like this... mix of lower/upper case letters, numbers and special characters 10 or more altogether...

Don't use names or any words and make sure you use different ones on more important accounts.

Yes he can.

Have you used the same username/email and password combination anywhere else?
---
If so, you might check haveibeenpwned.com to see if your email address appears in any public breaches.
---
Thank you, will do that... 
---
Pretty much this. I was expecting a complete collapse of all law and order because of the poor QC on previous updates and nerfs. 
---
Problem with that is that things would definitely get spotty as soon as duped items start to change hands multiple times, the fact that they don't have a reliable means of identification would mean that you would have to check every player manually, and that's quite difficult indeed.
---
Meanwhile if multiple items had the same ID, you would know if something has been duped with just that. 
---
I just bought the game on pc. I can't even make it through character creation, I tried about 7 times tonight. This is extremely frustrating. 
---
Sometimes the body disappears fast. There's always a blood pile though. You just have to rush to the corpse and stand on it until you get your loot.
---
I'm new to fallout games, with vendors you mean the npcs in train stations? And how do I get a ski sword??
---
Wow shit, I'm breached almost every year since 2013 :D
---
Of course servers are running multiple game worlds. 
---
Everything’s on scalable infrastructure nowadays. You don’t run one OS per server. 
---
You run whatever number of “worlds” in (probably)containers/(less-probably)VMs (all on less likely on dense hardware (30+ core, 2+TB machines on premise if you like pain or for some reason have no choice, or much more likely on cloud (AWS/Azure/...) and pay just for the capacity you need on any given day. 
---
Thank you Lord of the Rings and heroes of newerth...
---
I don't think you know what passive aggressive means
---
What kind of loser uses TSE'S nowadays? It's obviously AAE or BE or bust.
---
I was too into shooters like UT back then. WoW was my first mmo! Heard nothing but good things about ultima though. It's funny how those games were so advanced and polished compared to fo76 all those years ago 
---
I would want it still got it
---
Yeah, bot vendors; Top of the World for ski swords.
---
http://isweb.redwoods.edu/instruct/calderwoodd/diglogic/xor.htm
---
This may help with figuring out the xor gate.
---
It wasn’t about you.
---
It was about the items. 
---
They’ve known what’s in your inventory since before the patch, and if you were someone who needed disciplinary action, you’d have already seen it prior to the patch. 
---
This was about getting rid of some stuff that had macro negative effects on the economy demand/supply on one hand, and on server stability/performance on the other. 
---
Ans where they found stuff, they just cleaned up your excess dupes. 
---
The only reason this comment is downvoted is because the spoiled 12 year olds who didnt actually pay for the game run rampant on this sub and are accustomed to a lifestyle of witch hunt ideals where they get whatever they want or feel theyve been wronged in some horrible life altering manner and need to form a mob mentality to cope and bully other trains of thought into submission with their dislike buttons. Jk, these are grown folks acting this way.
---
But what about "honest vintage weapon collectors"?
---
This is a weird flex
---
Most logical post I've seen on here since launch.
---
They wont have stacked legendaries if they’re honest. 
---
Nice info mate
---
I found that the pipboy would eventually load in if you just waited for a few if it did freeze
---
Thank you, but I know what an XOR gate is, that's not my point, I'm saying it's impossible to create an XOR gate in fallout 76's system due to the fact that it neither has logic gates nor signal inverters 
---
I know right?
---
We were too naive and too loyal to Beth to realize what's this game going to be, but now most of us see clearly. Some of the guys just a bit too slow and need some more bugs and fails to clear their mind. 
---
Since the B.E.T.A for me
---
Ah my mistake
---
No and my statement was never meant to be factual. So no need to get all culty whiteknight on me. 
---
But if you really need to understand why that isn't as far fetched as it might sound, you need to realize that most accounts generally go inactive after the first 1-2 months of a games launch.
---
Do you think with most games they keep 80% of the total accounts active after 3 months? 70%? No way dude. It's WAY lower.
---
If you don't know why FO76 would be EVEN lower than your average example, then you're probably delusional. 
---
It's all good. I'm just trying to have fo76 have better camp dynamics 
---
Great job on the purge!  Your track record was spotty but this is definitely a turn in the right direction.
---
Some longterm content ideas.  A 'Rebuild Appalachia' update that focuses on adding various C.A.M.P types that would allow players four different camps with various budgets and limitations.  They would be:
---
**Homestead**; a camp designed around aesthetics and functionality including a much larger variety of crops to plant including silt beans, blood leafs, snaptail reeds, soot flowers, glowing fungus, hanging radstags and chicken coops, as well as a larger variety of decorations including placeable items.  The build zone size would be as it presently is for normal camps.  Would cost a bit more camps than presently.
---
**Base**; a camp designed around defense and offense over aesthetics and functionality, a limited crop and decor in place for a budget that treats defenses and turrets/traps as low budget items allowing for many of them, great for players looking to be raid bosses or just for setting up shop near an enemy spawn.  The build zone size would be as it currently is.  Would lost a lot more caps than presently.
---
**Settlement**; Fallout 4 styled very large building zone with a budget to match, but can only be placed in specific areas along a main road so that they actually become their own unofficial point of interest right off the road, if this one causes server issues then give us settlement zones like workshops to basically build upon and probably defend against others who want to build there.
---
**Camp**;  a very small build zone that allows for an extremely limited build budget focusing on minimalism, specifically no building items like foundations or walls or roofs and no food or water items, just misc, decor, defenses, turrets/traps, crafting and a stash, and costs as much as normal (making the placement fee the method to keep people from popping one of these down whenever wherever so that they're treated like an actual way of 'setting up a camp to rest'.)
---
Only 1 homestead or base or settlement can be placed at once, and only 1 camp can be placed at once allowing for two simultaneous C.A.M.P locations.
---
Just a suggestion.
---
Yes :)
---
Dude, I wish all products you buy end up the same quality as this game and don't you dare to complain about it 
---
Look all I’ve been doing is asking for data, but no one seems to have any. #feelfacts don’t help. I too have an opinion on this, but don’t have any data to back it up. So it’s just an opinion. 
---
I’m surprised there’s no industry/3rd party app or site that measures this sort of thing.
---
Same

Roses are red, don’t give me no lip, or you’ll see that man, with big iron on his hip

Please share with me the trading subs you sub to

 Just got disconnected, but who knows why.
---
Thanks man. Try it out if you're interested and tell other people if you like it/think it's good.
---
Meh, it was probs a drill anyhow. ;)
---
I literally posted this before you and Got down voted 
---
Why do i still follow this subreddit 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqrr5o/add_an_architect_mode_think_creative/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
Worked perfectly?
---
Pretty sure duping is still around. All dupers have to do is lower the durability of weapons/armor after they dupe them to get them to not stack anymore and they are safe from the next purge.
---
This fix did nothing useful in the long run. If anything all they have done is let the playerbase know that its ok to buy duped items as long as you only have 1 of each.
---
What a joke.
---
Fix It Good and Weapon Artisan are two perks that allow you to "over repair" weapons. See their descriptions. This is the white bar in CND. It didn't work at release. It has worked fine for a while now.
---
When you over repair melee weapons they do more damage. Armor gets additional defense boosts. These boosts dissipate as CND wears down.
---
Ranged weapons get.... Well, all CND for ranged does is let you fire it more before it is unusable (pretty much the same as armor and melee except you get no additional benefits).
---
LCK is supposed to influence the CND of found items (it's in an in-game tooltip). INT increases the total CND of crafted items, but it's a very diminishing return so don't go maxing out INT thinking you can craft tanks...
---
It's also worth noting one thing that's not quite obvious: armor has variants like Light, Heavy, etc. Both may say "Combat Armor" but the in-game model in the preview and on your character will tell you what variant it is in addition to the CND bar (heavy is higher).
---
Had a guy with a wanted level attacking my bf’s base when we were playing together. He kept asking to join our team, we had our own plans for stuff that we wanted to do - and without mics it would be awkward to tell this guy what to do and where to go. Plus he was ya know, wanted so we didn’t want to play with him.
---
He came inside our base a couple of times at Whitesping golf club and then seemingly left, went inside the building and then ran towards our base again and we were suddenly overrun by fairly high level ghouls and wendigos. Our base stated getting destroyed, even with turrets and the guy then began to pvp my boyfriend and spent the next hour trying to kill him because he got salty we wouldn’t let him join our team.
---
Luckily my bf was a bit more experienced and killed the other guy more often than not, but when my bf did die the guy kept stealing his stuff - so it basically became full blown war and ended up with the two of us but blasting the shit out of the guy and taking everything he had until he left. 
---
Don’t be THAT guy
---
I have seen a few times ghouls and scorched fighting each other. Mainly at Camp Venture. 
---
Bethesda are here and it can and will effect your account if tied to you 
---
Do the auto-repair perks repair past 100% if you have the fix it good perk? 
---
What differs a light vs heavy armor besides weight and DR?
---
Thank you for answering my other q's!
---
Of course I'm going to complain I want my voice to be heard. Even if it sounds bitchy or whiny at times. 
---
The closest thing we have to a Gauss rifle is actually a Gauss rifle. Gauss rifles have been real for a very long time. You can even build one at home. ;)
---
Rail guns are slightly different in operation. You should wiki it if you're actually interested in the topic.
---
What we don't have is portable nuclear power or whatever scifi magic that Fallout explains theirs with. The Gauss rifle is not fictional, but being able to carry one that performs the same as in Fallout is very much fiction.
---
I hadn't thought of this but it makes sense.
---
I have killed him twice now outside my base at Whitesprings. 
---
He doesn’t drop anything interesting. Appears to be part robot / alien. 
---
Was level 40 both times I killed it. 
---
De somewhere else and was level 30. Shot at it, and it disappeared. 
---
A coil gun is literally a Gauss rifle. ;)
---
I tried to go there for the ski sword but I only find lv 15s
---
did it have a few weird ladders and/or wood foundations with boxes stacked, and some spike strips here and there?
---
I would love to chat with you in-game sometime. You're walking, talking immersion.
---
I'll add you today
---
Downloading on Steam right now. 
---
Also, bring some friends.
---
Lets go, entering Charlie now
---
Bethesda doesn't really understand how guns work. (Obsidian did for the most part.) Unfortunately Bethesda is just a bit ignorant but that's okay because such is life. 
---
Just found that place today, had some fun taking photos with the skeleton army
---
I think most of the reasonable people have left already, leaving this subreddit with the majority of the toxic bunch. I'd imagine that are some legit people still around, but who knows?
---
That would be evil and way too permanant for the level of PvP in this game. A rad-x syringer ammo, though, that gives someone 100 rad resist and *suppresses* all their mutations for 10 min...
---
**Everyone Else:** [going batshit crazy over losing shit they obviously shouldn’t have had.]
---
**Me:** ...to the plaaaace, where I beloooonng...~
---
Yes perfect...
---
They can still dupe since bethesda allowed everyone to keep everything. Now they know all they have to do is lower durability to unstack the weapon/armor after they dupe it and its safe from next purge. They also let the playerbase know its ok and safe to trade for duped items as long as they only have 1 of each....lol.
---
Is it the one who whines about all the time he spent duping as if it was a legitimate way to earn money in the game? Who is convinced that flooding the market with practically devaluated endgame gear was good for the ingame economy and thus the purge breaks trading? Oh yeah, that one's wild. As if Bethesda forced all the dupers to exploit the game to hell and back.
---
An, happy birthday?
---
Rose are red, My uniform is blue, if there's a bounty on your head, I'm coming for you, 
---
Me and my dragon, my other one too, the black powder rifle, and one big ass ka-boom. 
---
I would seriously pay 15k to remove Egg Head, Eagle Eyes, and Herd Mentality. I have everything but Herbivore and Empathy and I'm fine with all except those three.
---
Similar. Played every day since the start of beta and met 3 idiots in the whole time. I'm on PC though so perhaps lucky. 
---
Of course I also have no problem with people destroying CAMPS if you use them to farm so my definition of griefers may be different. ;)
---
The day Bethseda ban people camping at whitesprings etc is the day the game improves a lot...
---
Interesting. I'm going to test ot out. 
---
Kinda feel like you should change your tag to "Raider" after that.
---
I'm an alien :/
---
They get the weapon too?
---
I always get the feeling that when I have to do this, recently quite a lot, that people have been trying to hack into my account. 
---
Yeah, this is the first time I went in with stuff I didn't really want to lose. Also, I normally would have waved or something, but I had big ugly glowing green dudes flying at me so I didn't have time. I had moved up to the next condo/house from where he/she/it died to give enough time to recover. I just won't be mr nice guy anymore. I forgot in games like these that being nice just gets you ripped off and dead. 
---
If you're having trouble in the game without a TSE or bloodied weapon, you're playing the game wrong.
---
Its funny how cars explode but yet none can be drivable
---
Mmh standing over him killing him again and again.... sure you're not confusing games here?
---
Intelligence is the SPECIAL that makes durability longer. Though it caps out as 20. So not much need to boost it past that. 
---
Everything else people have said is pretty correct. 
---
It’s actually pretty great, because it can make your armor and weapons and cooked food last longer. Then other perks lower the repair costs or slow down the rate of breakage. 
---
With a 17 intel because of my under armor, and grape mentats. I repair so seldom. Weeks and weeks go by before my white bar drops to low, 
---
Yeah and now they will just dupe more and keep selling them. Bethesda has basically said its ok to buy duped items as long as you only have 1 of each. What a fucking joke.
---
I see you are being downvoted by all the “innocent” players with duped items.
---
Yep! Kinda thinking about it, and the downvotes are just more encouraging lol
---
Only if I don't get caught in the area. ;)
---
Bethesda fixes potentially game-breaking bugs: "Where's new content???"
---
Bethesda releases new content: "The game is still broken, fix it!!!"  
---
I disagree you get spotted, You still have card that gives your CRIT's at I believe +40% damage so i assume 2.4x damage if  NOT more. On Top of Crit Savvy and Four leaf clover, You can't tap the crit button as fast as it fills. With a stock automatic handmade you are doing damage not another 2.4x (with sneak) on top of that but enough. Tanky is Relative you run T51-B at 200% repair+ stealth boy mod you have no DR issues, Better sneak as well, But hey please downvote since I make sense? And most Fallout 76 players hate when people talk logic to them. Unless its BGS community manager just straight lying then they are all eyes and ears. LMAO Turning Point Clown world
---
I thought so too. That’s why it’s a PSA :)
---
Roses are red. This rhyme is trash. If you could please do so, just give me your stash. 
---
Since this is going on for some time now and I really fail to see you reply to the questions I raise I will mark them with a **[1]** so you can then reply to them using those marks - unless you are trying to avoid them on purpose which I don't believe.
---
&gt; What you just described there, in many words, is called relativist morality.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; You might want to look it up.
---
&gt; Or as I call it by it’s less sexy name, made up excuses for behaving like an asshole to others.
---
Ok so teaching your kid not to get stolen goods from a fence is being an asshole? Well I am a full blown asshole then buddy if that is what it takes to make my children grow up to be morally sound. To each their own I guess.
---
&gt; Fortunately, Bethesda aren’t in the business of implementing your opinion about what morality is.
---
Bethesda by teaching people that duping is basically ok is not implementing morality at all. It just caters to a small part of its community ignoring the rest while praying that no one will leave over this.
---
&gt; My own opinion is that your opinion is warped, and seems to dish out harsh collective punishment to other player tribes, to mildly benefit yours. 
---
"Mildly benefit mine"? I am at this point wondering if you are actually arguing in good faith or if you just want to somehow score debate-points on an invisible chart. 
---
You are talking about benefit for many for the suffering of one when it is **exactly** the opposite. A few are benefitting from this and a lot of players have negative consequences. Be it the FOMO the next time this comes around, be it exclusiveness of players who benefitted from this to be accepted into groups more easily since they are OP. Be it the domination those few will have in every PvP situation, be it hunting wanted people, killing people if they become wanted themselves, the freedom to destroy peoples property knowing they can't fight back and being an effective bully without fear of repercussions from the majority of players. Or just the freedom to down the SBQ whenever they feel like it and getting even more awesome items much easier whereas others have to wait and fear if the queen goes even down at all. 
---
Additionally the impact this might have on the game itself and its balance. Knowing that a weapon that should be available to 1 in 1000 is now available to 1 in 100 can lead to increasing the health pool of future bosses to "keep the game challenging" and thus again effectivly punishing everyone who missed out on this *opportunity*.
---
Which leads to the next point, that I mentioned before - **People will learn from this that duping is absolutely ok and abuse the fuck out of it in the future** How is that good for the game buddy, riddle me that. **[1]**
---
&gt; The combat Torso in my wife’s example isn’t a stolen bike. It isn’t blood diamond, or the sweat labor of 5 year olds in a sweatshop. It’s a bunch of plucking bits in a non-competitive video game. Nobody cares if my wife has a combat advantage this week she didn’t have last week. 
---
Except the guy that got taken down by her *totally legit* TSE when she was wanted and lost his stuff to her. Or the guy that got kicked out of a group because she made more damage then he did. Or the guy that got his house griefed by her without a chance to fight back.
---
But yeah of course if you ignore those few cases, **no one** cares.
---
&gt;And your justice diatribe presents precisely zero reason to go harm her game experience. She did not cheat. 
---
I didn't claim that she did, I claimed that she got items that shouldn't be in the game period and by using them she is effectively a cheater.
---
If a guy gives me a fatman with unlimited ammo, 10000 damage and instant reload time and I go around nuking the world to bits and pieces, should I be allowed to keep this item because it could negatively impact my game experience if I lose it? **[2]** After all **I** did not cheat to get it, the russian hacker did. So I am fine using an unfair advantage against every player I encounter because I wasn't the one loading up the cheat tool and doing the deed.
---
Does this really make sense in your world? **[3]**
---
&gt;More broadly, your opinion seeks to make F76 your competitive tribe’s game (because the relative combat strength of you compared to my wife matters to you, for some reason that eludes me), and not everybody’s game. I think you’re as far from anything morality as a North Pole is from the Sourh. 
---
I don't care about **your wife** in particular. I am sure she is a lovely person that does not exploit whatever she got from this shit situation that bethesda created. But you and I know that this is not the norm. People that have those *illegal* items will use them to gain the advantage they get from it, effectively negatively impacting the experience of others.
---
Let me ask you this: If by all that tribalism talk you mean PvP which is a big portion of the game that players get sucked into constantly - How is it fair to people that don't have such a weapon that they will autolose every fight? What did they do to deserve this? **[4]**
---
&gt;But that’s just my opinion of you, as someone who seems unprepared to respectfully share a game with me.
---
So I am disrespectful for wanting to not have cheated items in a game I enjoy? Sure, that is pretty reckless of me, how can I even dare to want for people to have a legit game experience without duped items. 
---
&gt; Fortunately, Bethesda is in the business of building a fun experience for all the present audiences. Yours too. But not yours exclusively.
---
&gt; Get used to it bud.
---
I am confused how you get the picture that I am talking for myself. I am talking for the **majority** of players that just got cucked hard by bethesda for allowing the duped items to stay instead of removing them. Sure some are lonely islands that play it as a single player and might not care till their house gets blown to shreds by some griefing 13yo who is literally invincible - but as long as it does not impact the game experience of the few who have benefitted from the duping I am sure everyone is fine with it.
---
I don't even understand if this is jab or a compliment I'm just saying this SUB since BGS fuckups the other week is GOLD. Why do you think those shitty youtube Video game Reporters come to this SUB for there Drama reports. Looking at you juicehead.
---
I remember seeing a thread on this before, it ramps up over 1-50 then 50-100 is flat the same for each level then 100+ is another flat number but alot higher.
---
Was surprised having played since the start of beta and traded a lot that I didn't lose anything or rather anything I cared enough about to notice so looks like they targeted the removals well. Would have been a real kicker if I had having played as intended since the start of Nov. Of course we also still have no new content in three months and most players have already left so as much as they're trying I'm not convinced they've not already re-assigned most of the programmers.
---
Enough. 
---
I’m not giving you any more of my time, sorry. 
---
**Doesn’t matter**: that cheating was how these bits were created. 
---
**FACT: The bits are now a baked in part of the game**. 
---
The cheater was banned 
---
**Does matter**: the experience of non-cheating player. 
---
If you want to apply your ideologies and serve justice unto those bits and harm people’s experience in the process, 
---
Doing that
---
1. Is something you’re doing to satisfy some weird emotional need you have. 
---
2. Harms others.
---
It’s arsenide behavior. And it’s immoral. 
---
for infinity dollars?
---
I Will do. I bought a new PC at launch of F76 with a 2080 (not TI), 8700K, 32 GB ram and so on but I truly understand the point of reasonable settings in a game like this. 
---
And just FYI i love the game, especially the environment and the social aspect that is not that level or gear divided.
---
Used a few QOL mods already for inventory and perk managern and is super hyped for the future of the game. On my first break from the game since beta now though since I played a bit too much and got a little bored/burned out from being in ”the end game” a bit long with no changes in daily routines.
---
Will play Anthem for a bit and be back later. Its a long term game i am hoping for.
---
Hope to see you later and I hope you get to mod the game as well
---
My personal favorite is hearing my own voice as i am trying to talk! I end up talking all over myself. Damn kinects are horrible for that.
---
And OMG, if I wanted to listen to music I can damn well listen to my own, and I would at least have the courtesy to not blast it to you over my mic. 
---
Actually the no mic issue is pretty prevalent on Xbox accross many titles, including in games where coordination with team mates is a must. (face Palm) Aalso since the console comes with a mic it is quite preplexing ( although the mics are garbage and do break easy).
---
On PC I prefer typing chats.
---
And then you get many of the issues mentioned be others in this post if they do have mics. You can of course mute the obnoxious ones and set it up to only chat with team mates or with randoms, so its not game ending. But really, show some ettiquette!
---
Kids are the worst offenders. They try too hard to constantly be a part of the conversation or just make sounds if they have nothing of value to say ( so most of the time). And the young boys have a high pitch screech that causes me to hurl my head set to the ground.  Not all kids that I have played with are so bad, there are some that are more quiet and reserved usiing their words to actually communicate. Some can even focus for a few minutes to complete intricate missions.  I rarely friend a kid on xbox, but I do have few on my friends list.
---
Ever notice at social gatherings when a child wanders over from the kids table and stands with a group of adults who are talking about adult topics (not naughty stuff get your head out of the gutter). They are usually at that awkward age where they are trying to gravitate away from child hood but have not developed the correct social skills yet to hold serious conversations.  Their pacing, energy, tone, etc..  are all wrong and they end up looking foolish.  I think this is maginified during online communication where body langauge is out of play and the social rules are also a bit twisted. For example, I had a conversation with a child that went along the lines of... "If we were speaking face to face you would be speaking to me much differently."  And I am sure it is true, and not just becuase of the threat of violence. 
---
I don't mind the adult playing a game with a kid screaming in the back ground as much.  If you are a working adult with children you can sympathize and you know that play time for you can be precious. I just let them know if they need a sec to deal with the kid I can wait, and hey no judgement from me on how you discipline your kid.  
---
Lol very good. Made me smile on a grim work day so thanks. ;)
---
I found the post in my history, here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9svhak/character\_levels\_go\_up\_to\_50000\_according\_to\_game/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9svhak/character_levels_go_up_to_50000_according_to_game/)
---
You think people complain because they don’t like the game?
---
People are complaining because they can see what the game could be. I’m sorry you gave up.
---
You go to that sub you pretty much just kill any chance of the game improving.
---
Oof. Great. I was on 2 1080s until september last year. xD  
---
Definitely a good computer. Have fun!  
---
But yeah. Sure. I've also spent a bit too long in it already and I'm starting to feel it. lmao  
---
Hit me up if you need help with this or so. Take care
---
Some of them are not easy to make
---
Yep. Ever since Fallout 3, this is my favorite ingame relaxation. The dead highways with lines of cars were great for this in F3.
---
In Fo76, I love to blow cars whenever I come to Harper's for trade. Bonus points for killing some mobs with it!
---
My fault then.
---
The fact is, i don't think there is a legendary prefix for the scorchbeasts.
---
This is what i told everyone on youtube (the complainers about bad performance) since release. I am not a modder but i used to mod a lot skyrim and fo4. This are basics but one of the most important things. Thx for the confirmation.
---
I also would like to use reshade but dunno if this is legit or not. I dont want to get banned cause of this. I am rly not sure.
---
Best regards
---
Are there any perk cards that I'm missing out on that could also help this build? :)
---
Only work around I have found is setting CPU affinity for Fallout76.exe  
---
To 0-7 checked and 8-15 unchecked.
---
I say workaround because performance in general does seem reduced, not so much frame rate but stutters. Better then hard freeze though. 
---
3 stars wolf are the best
---
A fat wife, 3 dumb as rocks children, a pinto and a camry, all in a shitty old house. Go ahead and say it's different, we won't believe you.
---
You pick !
---
Like Luck of the Draw? I honestly don't know how it interacts with Weapon Artisan. It doesn't seem to work for me. I'm unlucky. My experience with trying it with a Plasma Gatling with and without Weapon Artisan was that the CND didn't fall but it didn't seem like it was gaining CND by any means. Plasma Gatlings are made of tinfoil and paper, though....
---
Light and heavy armor are visually different. People have posted the differences in appearance in-game here and you can also look at the wiki: 
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Heavy_combat_armor_(Fallout_76)
---
Light combat armor is just a small plate where heavy is thicker and wraps the whole leg.
---
Hey  
---
Yeah, it's the basics but it even took me a while to figure out. I set Fallout 4 to Ultra back then and shadow distance to low and dealt with the bad visuals.  
---
It doesn't work the exact same way in Fallout 76 but the base does.  
---
You're welcome.  
---
I haven't been banned yet and on Bethesda's website I read that they don't provide support for mods since the game might stop working.  
---
Reshade is a .dll injector. It's kind of an overlay but the .dll is needed for the interface you configure stuff in.  
---
If you decide to get it and need help setting it up, I've got a tutorial I amde for that.
---
You should try fo4. The power counters actually work and you can make some very cool things. There's an interval thing (I forget what it was actually called) and there are also lasers that don't require manual reset after tripping.
---
None of that stuff works or simply is not present in 76.
---
Good to see some positive feedback, keep at it Bethesda 👍.
---
I mean, that depends on context... there's more than a handful of places around the map that look like they may have suffered a fire.  But finding burnt books inside a structurally sound building with working equipment inside is definitely weird.
---
Lowering the durability of a weapon/armor will cause it to no longer stack, making this fix do absolutely nothing for weapons/armor other than make dupers spend extra time unstacking.
---
I already saw this at a vendor today with multiple dupes at different durability. 
---
They need to focus on putting an end to duping, then raise item level and *level. I really hope they have not been putting a lot of time into this shitty “fix”.
---
I have a video about the stuttering possibly caused by audio loading: 
---
[https://youtu.be/XeFYtJZpuXg?t=128](https://youtu.be/XeFYtJZpuXg?t=128)
---
(For some reason, the audio was not retained, probaby to avoid copyright issues). I'm approaching Watoga and as the terrain changes, the footstep audio changes, causing loading and hiccups. Note that the buildings load in the distance fine.
---
Saw this post in my home feed and got a little worried before i saw it was a fallout 76 post
---
Backpacks would be SO good! I’m tired of having to fast travel back to camp or have to delay reaching a destination because I’m over encumbered and need to get rid of my junk. 
---

---
Thanks for this! 
---
Not yet, its what I'm hoping to get. Have gotten to Polymer, Shadowed, and Reinforced helmet paints.
---
at least in skyrim you had a chance to get some assistance from npcs
---
unless you have friendly bots close by you gotta solo the stupid bats.
---
also i find the queen is less annoying than a lvl 80 with endless lightshow 
---
Thank you for putting it plainly and honestly. You have expressed my issues with the dupe situation far better than I could. Hope you and everyone here enjoys the game going forward. 
---
I can't stand juicehead
---
Lord of the rings shows up there for me aswell. And also actually CD project red.
---
I think I still have the files, I'll have to check when I get home, but because I was new at printing and had some failures to avoid needing to reprint the whole thing I printed them in parts: head + body in 2 pieces (cut in half around middle) + hands/feet/accessories, each with their separate print. You can however find the models on the net (for example here: [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1220886](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1220886) or here for a smoother version [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3003003](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3003003) \- don't know how they will print).
---
I made an automatic Tesla (non lege) to just tag them. Problem is that it's doing too much damage and they die real fast.
---
Used to use gatling or .50 cal (non lege also) to just tag them and kite them until others came. If no one shows up I usually switch to melee and one shot them away.
---
man of my 13 characters, 12 still have the same duped shit, but the 13th char got rekt: it had over 2mil nuka colas per type, over 5mil fluxes per type, idk how many friggen ammos, junk, consumables, nuclear keycards, about 2k pieces of lots of different 3\* different legendary weapons and armors.
---
yep.
---
Unfortunately no. On the first one I tried to add a spring from a pen, but it needed a bigger hole in the head and body and I didn't want to ruin it by drilling so I just glued the head.
---
Obviously all anecdotal here, but my experience afterward: no disconnects, still occasional bouts of "server not responding, controls disabled", still occasional jumpy movement from mobs.
---
His videos are trash and he is dishonest I enjoy young yea as he kinda will let you know what is speculation and what is reported, Juicehead str8 up reports reddit threads as fact and people eat that shit up, If you wanna be a dick you can DCMA every video under a SOC account claiming he is using your gameplay footage and it will demonotize him for the first couple days so making him lose that sweet youtube ad money. 
---
Okay, I'm sure if you practice on one you could get it :)
---
Eh. It's the internet. One week you'll see posts about dupers saving children and the next week you'll see posts  about how they caused measles outbreaks.
---
Once one becomes edgier people jump on a bandwagon. Zzz.
---
It wasn't that long ago that people were witch hunting people "witch hunting" inanimate in-game objects people were hiding near while using foundation stacks to make invincible bases........ which now people share youtube videos of.........
---
You just have to know when to swap Abercrombie for Hot Topic if you want cool kid points here. ;)
---
There's a concerning distaste for criticism around here. The game is quite bad, you cannot expect the fan base to simply not discuss that. I understand you don't like it, but that's the nature of discussion.
---
Well just like others have stated in their comments,  a lot of times players use the limited amount of emotes for different things, especially the come over here emote. Last night i was teamed up with a friend who's on their level 8 alt crafting at a camp at the edge of the map when a guy with a mic popped up from the nearest spawn point and started heading towards the low levels camp, upon getting to the camp he threw the come over here emote and talked on the mic saying i got some weapon and armor mods for you here in this bag, the my friend just continued crafting so he walks over inside and says look in that bag i got some stuff for you, so when my friend walked over to look he went ahead and shot him in the head with a double barrel. Not killing the low lvl alt but making him hostile to the team of 4, which includes me hiding in the bushes outside with a chameleon stealth rifle build. Lets just say his level 200+ with PA didn't make it after 2 shots of fully charged up two shot furious gauss with sneak crit bonus. 
---
That and all he does is whine. I mean if he hates the game so much he should go play other ones. SMH.
---
If a duper duped 100 TSE Shotguns and sold 50 to unique accounts, after the purge, 49 would be deleted, the duper would still have the original, and 50 illegitimate TSE Shotguns still exist out there amongst the ebayers, "legitimate" traders and unknowing traders. 
---
There's still a higher count of legendaries out there with wanted stats than there should be.
---
The suppliers got slapped, the traders are fortunate and the power buyers get away scott free (I should have bought one instead of using that money to support Bethesda at the launch I guess).
---
As far as I understand it, even if they found duped items in your inventory, they only deleted multiples, and left you with at least one.
---
If you're buying... or "buying" multiples of the exact same legendary, then you're either up to something fishy, or you're a blithering imbecile and no amount of mollycoddling will stop you from making ridiculous, costly mistakes.
---
Yeah, I've just put too many hours into fo4 and I just like the idea of showing off my creative ideas immediately rsther than through a medium such as youtube
---
INT boosts the durability of crafted items, like power armor. ive found that luck impacts the durability of found items. like legendaries 
---
"use legit shit" \*facepalm\*
---
Most people I play with have ultimately quit over zero content since launch in Nov despite promises - remember that big content drop in January (yeah no none of us do as it never happened). There's simply nothing to do except level using the same content yet another character. I'm on character 10 or 11 now and self handicap every one for a bit of variety. The map just feels super small now  that I've explored it all and they've also nerfed so many spawns to remove incentive to even visit those out of the way locations ever again.
---
PS: My friends list is around 200 - if I'm lucky 1-2 are ever logged in nowadays.
---
That makes sense honestly this SUB is divided and more then just 2 ways. Yeah i really enjoyed the witch hunting Duper threads and everyone cheering. Like really do you honestly feel like taking ONE bag of Dupers stuff will stop anything? We really are at Turning Point Clown World 
---
Yeah. Wouldn't it be nice if we could mechanize together? ;)
---
But also confirming counters just flat out don't work and it's a mystery why the other stuff was removed and they were left in.
---
Still, someone had to find the original.  I guess they didn't want to remove the original, and it would have been too costly in terms of effort to ascertain which was the original.
---
It's all for views honestly he won't be the next Gamer Ranx or even close to someone like OXhorn for Fallout content, Honestly his presentation and reporting sucks compared to even the most controversial YT Gamer channels IE CleanPrinceGaming who's murdered of series got me started on him and he does do good work but seems like a shill at points
---
Go back further. As mentioned people were saying no one should ever point out glitched scenery with containers or it was witch hunting dupers.
---
The next week: We should PVP dupers!!!1111
---
I'm pretty sure in the next few days we'll see the sub flipping to "how much more betterer" the game was when you could easily dupe.
---
My guess is that logic gates also don't work. Hell, Bethesda deleted my camp for having too many switches(most likely)  Imagine a build with a bunch of different logic gates on them. 
---
There's a mole mascot head with +1 damage resistance generally found on the top floor in a locked room at or near the dolly suds campground between the savage divide and the mire. To my knowledge it is the only (non PA) 'helmet' that provides damage protection in game despite the presence of actual army and combat helmets.
---
Yep, and then you have to play the game „guess the meat turd“, but ONLY if the loot spawns. Waited like 15 mins the other day and when a second normal scorched beast spotted me I quit and left the server. It’s really frustrating and sat this point I ain’t doing silo runs myself anymore. Loot from the queen isn’t that good mostly but not even getting the chance to see the loot is ridiculous 
---
I miss the ones you got from the Creation club in f4
---
There were methods i won't go into detail about that allowed players to duplicate items, including weapons. 
---
So something very rare like Two-Shot Explosive legendary weapons became incredibly abundant through this method. Although it also extented to things like bobbleheads.
---
Most duping methods have been fixed although some claim there are still ways to dupe. Now Bethesda intends to get rid of at least some of the duped items, naturally this upsets some people as people have been trading duped items and gear for a while now. Some even paid real money to buy certain exceptional legendary pieces from other players. 
---
All these people are now at risk of losing said items and are freaking out.
---
Congratulating developers with doing the bare minimum that should have been implemented months ago? What are you going to congratulate them next on; having a working game?
---
I don't see it not happening, Honestly it is grinding my gears people want a melee nerf, but that's just me, it looks like.
---
Congratulating developers for doing the bare minimum that should have been implemented months ago? What are you going to congratulate them on next; having a working game? 
---
I rarely drink my Nukas. But I keep on picking them up so last I looked I had about 200. I would love, and pay atoms, for a Nuka fridge where I can keep them on display. 
---
I'm fine with the changes but had heavily delayed hit reg yesterday on one server and a disconnect in just an hour of playing post patch so not convinced yet. I live in hope though. Curious to see if things are better when I have more time to devote this weekend.
---
Wait, you don't want to eat the can with it? it’s the best and most nutritious part of dog food!
---
The idea that a safe space could be a good thing would be a major ding to his masculinity. Can't have any of that can we? It instantly turns him into a snowflake. Then he'd just be one of us....
---
Your probably a duper sorry your bobble head stack let you kill the queen to early! jk sorry to hear though!
---
You’re posting on r/fo76
---
That’s called interacting with the game online. It’s 
---
a. The thing you **choose** to spend your time on 
---
and 
---
b. A **part of** almost any MMO game experience. 
---
Or are you interacting with the game community in a paid capacity? 
---
I played it at launch and I have solidly put in at least 100 hours. I loved it. Yes bethesda did some very bad decision, but the game was for me amazing. the thing which pisses me off is how people just bash at the game because they follow the trend. I took a break for a while, but on monday when ill download it aggain and start a new character im sure im going to have a blast once aggain :)
---
Thats a really good idea - where is the cooler?
---
If I may ask: how the heck can be so certain that someone is a duper? Maybe he has just duped items which he bought, like the majority of players in these subreddits. 
---
That's more edgelordiness gone wild. They somehow think they have a valid reason to seek revenge on people because they feel cheated over Abercrombie TSE. If they had started in melee the same exact people would be in Hot Topic clothes. Zzz.
---
lol.  ghetto.
---
Most dupers thought the eBay and PayPal shit was wack too. The reason people always told me was that they were collectors. I haven’t play this in a month+ but if they left everyone 1 copy of everything there is nothing to complain about 
---
Why do you people feel the need to post these things. If you're done playing no one here is going to care. Lol, just go on about your business.
---
It’s almost like everyone on this sub has worked themselves up to think the sky was falling
---
it depends, how many people where there? 
---
how many of them running maximum bloodied builds?
---
Well you failed again to adress any of the arguments I made - and i get it, you don't actually have sound counterarguments. You have your feelings which is "my wife got this item and she is sad if she loses it - so I am ok if this game goes to hell before that happens". Which of course is ok in your world but is also very very egoistic behaviour. At least you and your folks are fine, who cares about the majority of players right? right.
---
Good, we established your version of the truth.
---
Now to my version:
---
Duping is in fact wrong, and **duped items** should be "punished" by removing them from the game and not being left in the game as a reward for people who knowingly or not got a hold of them.
---
Again I will list the argumentes you failed to adress just to make sure:
---
1. People who got a duped item used it, thus making a "profit" with it, outweighing or evening out the cost they had. Some didn't even have costs as they got the item gifted by a hacker who had literally stashes full of them.
---
There is not argument against this. People got illegit items, used illegit items to make profit, are now illegitely in an advantage that they shouldn't be in. Simple, sound and logic.
---
2. The majority of people who didn't get duped items are in an disadvantage by group search/PvP/PvE.
---
This as well is a simple fact. If you did not get your super item you are in a disadvantage. If you care about PvP or not doesn't matter in the sleightest. You.are.in.a.disadvantage - in comparison to players who got a duped item. Period.
---
3. By not removing the items Bethesda encourages players to buy and use duped items in the future as this does evidently not go punished.
---
This also goes without saying, next time duped items are around WAY more people will make use of the opportunity. I don't think this is rocket science.
---
4. The items are not baked in the game, they are duped, created in an unintentional way, them remaining in game will proof a constant inbalance.
---
Another thing that is simple, items were brought into the world by means not intended by Bethesda. It is logical to remove these items and punish the ones who created them. Why? To prevent this from happening again, duh.
---
5. By remaining in game, those items do paint a false picture of the current avarage players possibilites (DPS) which will lead to balance changes taken by Bethesday, which lead to more inbalance and unfairness to players that "really" did nothing wrong.
---
When Bethesday designs new content or patches existing one to meet players current top level DPS, the availability of those items will have a negative impact to everyone who did not get hold of such an item as they are unable to easily close up.
---
6. By remaining in game, PvP which is a big sector of the game gets hit hard by unfairness.
---
Lastly, you don't care about PvP - a lot of people do. They get punished so your wife can keep her items. What did they do to deserve this? Nothing, they played the game legit and didn't get involved with cheaters, exploiters and dupers. 
---
I understand why you failed to adress these points properly, because you can't.
---
But don't claim morality for you if you are acting purely out of egoism. Name it as it is,
---
you don't want your wife to be unhappy thus she should keep her item. 
---
May the rest of FO76 go to hell if must be.
---
Now! - It's enough.
---
Sadly nope PS4 
---
Oof how dare I post something that I wanted to post that maybe some people can relate too. I could care less if anyone cares about me leaving. Just sharing my experience. 
---
I think they should wipe invents and stashes and caps, keep levels etc. 
---
yeah, it's been that way ever since r/fallout leaked into the sub. This sub was ironically created to move away from that bullshit, and yet it still made its way here. 
---
Is this the glowing alien looking thing?
---
Last night I was taking a stroll around the mountains and it popped up and I smacked it with my axe and it clipped into a rock and disappeared. Never seen it before. 
---
Correct I meant to say that 
---
I haven’t failed to address your intellectual itch. 
---
I don’t care about it. 
---
It doesn’t matter to me. 
---
It’s your, internal, emotional issue. 
---
You’re the only losing sleep over it. 
---
And it sure as hell doesn’t give you license to do bad to others. 
---
I think it would have to be even more expensive than buying actual serums. Otherwise wouldn’t everyone just get mutations naturally. Collect a lot of them, and then just remove what we don’t want. Usually I would argue that we should be able to just chose what we want for our character, but it’s clear they wanted the mutations to be a big risk/reward thing. This eliminates a lot of risk. 
---
There’s is not a person on this sub who is genuinely happy to see another “i’m quitting” post
---
Yeah and I am still wrecking with my TSE shotgun which is badly specced into (originally melee pistol build). People on this forum will whine about anything that affects them because FO76 is single player only game and everyone who harasses or annoys them is a troll RUINING the game. Mind you this is coming from me with a 2k cap bountie grieving camps to try and get someone to fight. Sorry off topic but you get what I mean the people complaining have bad specced CHAR it's that simple 
---
i don't like it. Honestly, i'm for full item wipe, because people who bought -8% from players -15% standing will dominate in survival mode, but will see
---
Just because the game crashes doesn’t mean it’s dead lol. This is such a pointless post like how is this benefiting anybody.
---
Purple one, yes. 
---
It does a short range teleport. It’s still around when it does that. 
---
You knock off both “kill the Flatwoods monster” and “kill an alien” when you kill it. 
---
It's like wearing the ghoul mask from FO3
---
You don't care about the reasons why it is a bad thing.
---
You don't care about the game becoming worse than before.
---
It doesn't matter to you if inbalance is created.
---
Whoever want's the game to be legit and fair is emotional.
---
Removing bad items that hurt the game experience of many is bad because it hurts some.
---
People should stop complaining about it as long as you have your advantage.
---
Ok I **really** got you now fam.
---
Yeah, the fact that the bethesda people are here is really the only reason why i haven't left this sub yet.
---
Soot flower's blue, super mutants smash, come by my C.A.M.P., I'll sell you some trash.
---
Poor fella FO76 wouldn't put out on Valentines day I'd dump her too.
---
Thank you, I'm going to try this, if Bethesda fixes ctd on launch issue I've been having anyway.
---
Man are y’all really like this rn? Like seriously I made this post because I was disappointed in a game that I wanted to be the next biggest thing because I love fallout. Can I not vent my frustration on a board that is dedicated to the game? 
---
I remember back when the game first released and people hated r/fallout for being so toxic. It's a shame that this is what our own sub Reddit is turning into. I could care less about anyone's opinions or reasoning for leaving the game. Don't talk about it, just do it. Take your toxicity elsewhere.
---
See ya later 
---
That’s a straw man. That was never my argument. 
---
You keep making these hyperbole comparisons to morally wrong things that are immoral because they made people suffer and conclude justice needs to be served unto meaningless bits in a video game.
---
Let me counter with my own hyperbole analogy. 
---
You are behaving the way predatory religious preachers and revolutionaries who destroy the country they revolutionize behave. 
---
Down to justifying doing bad things to innocent people with whatever idealist bullshit dogma you’re peddling. 
---
I can’t hear what you’re saying over the noise that my bullshit-o-meter is making. 
---
Go thump your bible somewhere else. 
---
I've had Empath for quite some time. This along with max bodyguard can make your team pretty tanky. If your not rolling with a consistent group it probably won't be worth your time. 
---
On the other hand, if you do have a consistent group, there are ways to fortify yourself. 
---
1.) The most obvious is Bodyguard for the moderate defense boost. 
---
2.) Max level power armor will give you more, and much needed, defense. I went with T-59b.
---
3.) The med-pump mod combined with First Aid (max), Field Surgeon, and a copious amounts of stimpacks will help you gain health back  quickly. 
---
Bonus points if you have Team Medic and become a walking healing bomb. 
---
&gt; We were too naive and too loyal to Beth to realize what's this game going to be, 
---
No, you fucking weren't. You knew exactly what it was going to be whenever the fuck the no-clip documentary came out or when the greenbriar event happened. You had ample time to cancel that preorder before November 14th happened.
---
&gt; Accidentally Damaging another player’s C.A.M.P. will no longer tag you  as WANTED– From our Known Issues list, players who accidentally shoot,  hit, or disturb another player’s C.A.M.P. will no longer become WANTED  and viewed as engaging in PvP. Instead you must actively work to be  malicious to another player and DESTROY their C.A.M.P. objects for it to  be considered a PvP action and become marked as WANTED. We will closely  monitor player feedback to this change. 
---
Am I the only one that sees how a griefer could abuse this with 0 punishment? I'll just damage all your items and leave everything at 1%. I won't get a bounty and the next animal attack that happens will destroy everything for me. Unless I'm misunderstanding this.
---
Honestly I agree 100%. I love Fallout games but they weren’t meant to be multiplayer. There is a story line but it’s just not the same. I haven’t had many problems with crashing but a lot of glitching. 3/10 for the game hahaha
---
They should just release the Creation Kit for this game. Thats all it needs.
---
He admitted to not getting hit and still has stacks and nukas
---
Dupers are saying that their stacks of TSEs got reduced to 10, not 1. But it is still better than nothing.
---
Yeah, I feel the same way. I haven't been on the game myself since christmas simply because all the negativity over the game bummed me the fuck out. You know how much shit I've gotten for simply playing it and simply saying i enjoy it? 
---
There is its called area chat
---
Bitch please, don't lump us all into one basket.  You could have just left the sub without saying anything, but instead you've caused more negativity.  Personally, I've been positive in this sub.
---
"You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain." - Spiderman
---
If everyone has the quest, but you end up having to do the last fight for each person I think.  Still, I found it much happier times to do that fights with buddies watching my back.
---
It's not criticism, it's bitching. There's a huge difference. 
---
It just reminds me of then I played the division...Just complaint after complaint from the players....they'll never get the game right for everyone.
---
Glad to know someone else does that. I started doing that after I realized I had like hundreds of bobby-pins back when they still weighed a bunch.
---
Not a lot apparently. Guess I mentioned Amish lol
---
That’s the thing, they don’t beep.  I have only heard the sentry bots beep when they are about to blow.  
---
Good! Glad I could help. 
---
How the fuck is that a strawman when I literally said what you were saying before? 
---
It is exactly your argument, and you kept on bringing it up again and again so don't deny it now. You (or your wife) would lose an item that she shouldn't have gotten in the first place. That's not good for you (or her), thus Bethesda should not remove said item.
---
That's literally been your point all the time we were talking. 
---
While I tried to convey to you in many many ways how this egoistic and selfish behaviour does have a lot of negative ways in which it impacts the game.
---
You answer to that is that you do not care about the game being impacted negatively, it does not matter to you and as long as you (or your wife) is keeping her little cheated item the world is fine for you.
---
It's basically what you stated.
---
And to adress your analogy, remember how I compared the action I see fit to one that is a fucking "law"? Like legit justice system stuff, like paragraphs, laywers, judges and stuff - you catch my drift? People defintiely smarter than you and also smarther than me already discussed those issues and found solutions to them. 
---
Yes it sucks for your wife, that she got "scammed", but in no way shape or furm does it justify the many many bad impacts this has on the game itself.
---
You are also seeing my point completely wrong, I do not want to "punish" anyone, I do want to get the game to a point where it is fair to everyone. If that includes removing items that should not exist in the first place from players who already unfairly benefitted from them then yes, I do not have any problem with that if it makes sure that the next time people start duping everyone is avoiding that shit.
---
Man... it's not rocket science, seriously. I really get the feeling you don't wanna catch up.
---
You're welcome. How come you get that? Haven't you been able to start the game at all?
---
No it ain't. EA would just shitcan the game and kill the franchise and the dev studio while moving onto their next trainwreck, just like they did with Mass Effect Andromeda and Dead space.
---
Be lucky this isn't Rockstar who would have you unreasonably grinding your ass off for days and days and days and days at a time to even get where you want to be while giving you the option to literally buy caps whilst also overpricing the shit out of everything like they do in GTA and Red dead online. 
---
The price of individual items is up, it’s supply that crashed not demand.
---
Is it level 50 ? 
---
I think you should drink a glass of orange juice after immediately brushing your teeth.
---
Oh.  I didn’t know the other robots could self destruct because I never hear them beep.  Is that just me or is it intended? 
---
Because I *do* care about the game being good for the broadest number of players. 
---
Your exercising morality unto bits in a video game and whatever innocent bystander happens to stand closest to them gobblygook sure isn’t the way there. 
---
Found 2 explosive guns, some good 2* armor and a brown asylum outfit in vendor stashes. These folks who are selling those things are definitely not on Reddit lol
---
Doesnt mean we're here to hear about it. 
---
Blade of Bastet is pretty sweet at 50
---
Yes lvl 50, 3* with 50% limb dmg and +50 dmg resist while aiming
---
only enemies that beep before they explode are super mutant suiciders. but those are rare
---
All of those empties can broken down into scrap glass though.  They at least serve some purpose.  Burnt magazines and books cant, and are just vendor trash at 1 cap a piece.
---
Make friends 
---
I dont understand why they cant be scrapped into something..  Cloth.. Fertilizer... Something..
---
Nice!  Are any further increases planed? But honestly an increase of 1/3 is a very good Start and I think it will at least make my experience way better because I collect all the cool weapons like the protest signs,  the guitar and ski sword,  the Scorched pistol and so on . Anyways thanks for your update on this :)
---
How much mate 
---
It's like FO4 in survival mode, but weapons and armors have to be repaired, food and consumables rot, the world is wider, there are less encounters of humans, thats it, u can build pretty much anywhere
---
sometimes it will fix itself if you wait but if it doesn't go down after about 5 min it's server hop time. Other places it will get stuck is the the reactor room, fix all pipes and it will just run out of time and it will say failed, with no option to restart it. The repairing the mainframe, it will not allow you to remove the old cores or pick up new ones and lastly the launch prep, you will get 3 robots out of 5 up and it won't progress further.
---
A good sign you're in for a failed nuke run is if the turrets are all dead from the begining.
---
Right?! Put down some foundations to make a driveway, maybe a nice little detached garage... 
---
I think not, not in the case of Fallout 76. When some ppl are emotionally invested in a game, for them the line between bitching and criticism is blurred. They think the complainers are nitpicking the game, which they like/love unconditionally.
---
We still have tons of unpatched, easy to fix problems with the game after 4-5 months. Are they bitching when they are constantly pointing out these problems?
---
You on PC?
---

It's easier to get loot bags in the queen fight than collect your own loot sometimes. Collecting a bag when they haven't killed should initiate pvp so u can win it back. 
---
Thanks for this.
---
Quick follow up.
---
Medium settings. Got it!
---
Adjust to your liking? Helpless here! What definitely has to go up in your opinion?
---
&gt; Because I do care about the game being good for the broadest number of players.
---
Assuming now that the broadest numbers of players does posess duped items?
---
&gt; Your exercising morality unto bits in a video game and whatever innocent bystander happens to stand closest to them gobblygook sure isn’t the way there.
---
&gt; An MMO is inherently NOT fair to everyone, go play a competitive shooter where everyone logs in for a 30 minute match on similar terms if you want fair.
---
&gt; It’s not fair.
---
&gt; My wife spends 10% of the time in the game I do. I’m 10 times stronger than her as a result. Where’s fair?
---
An MMO is fair though - each player spending the same amount of time at the same level of playing will have a very similar outcome, that is fair. If you invest less time you end up weaker, that is fair too because what would be the alternative I ask and I know you wont answer - the alternative would be that regardless of the time you invest everyone is at the same level. 
---
Now that would make it unfair, as people who play a lot and invest a lot of their time to get good are always on pair with people who login once in a while and dgaf. 
---
"That" is unfair.
---
&gt; I min-max the shit out of the technicals and can melt Queens as a result. Players who don’t do all the rpg math stuff can’t or don’t know how.
---
&gt; Where’s fair?
---
So you say if you make all those calculations and min max, invest your time and work it is totally fair if I  am able to log in, dupe some cool items and be on the same level? That is what fairness means to you? Seriously???
---
&gt; It’s an MMO. Not a competition. Fair doesn’t matter here.
---
&gt; Fun does.
---
&gt; Go back to playing black ops 4.
---
&gt; Fair. Sheesh.
---
Yeah, I guess you got the word fair wrong somehow.
---
It is equality of opportunity not equality of outcome that matters. What you do with the game is up to you as long as everyone has the same chances to do it.
---
Can people that don't have duped items get one too? No? then it is literally unfair.
---
Bethesda now have a pretty good idea who some of the dupers are.  I bet those guys are under surveillance now.
---
I say shhh cause it is like talking to a little kid they make a lot of noise but don’t say anything important is why..now go to bed you have school early in the morning..lol so thanks for making my point
---
People love complaining just part of human nature
---
Never found the plan but server hopping @ Grafton has turned up a couple of loose mods. 
---
 Still can’t find strengthened combat limb mods/plans anywhere though. 
---
"I don't agree with him so I'll take his video down fraudulently"
---

---
Don’t horde.  When you die and spawn don’t pick up any items until you get to your paper bag(you drop one when you die and all your junk is in it)   The game only saves the most recent one you dropped so if you pick up new items before you get to your paper bag and die you will drop a new bag and the previous one will disappear.  
---
And the perks system is pretty shitty.  Copied from the previous Fallout without much change and doesn’t well in 76 because it’s not a single player game.  I recommend looking up different build guides first before you start playing.  And check out nukesanddragons.com, it allows you to plan out your build.  
---
Lastly, don’t complete quests that rewards special weapons until your are level 50 because the lvl of the said reward depends on your current level.   Speaking of lvls, game is very grinddy and you will spend a ton of time scavenging for supplies and junk until you get to a high level and have a good weapon that can kill enemies quickly.  
---
Back to the gay pile!

*fist bump to fellow sys admin* this ^^

I always hear the sentry bots always beeps.  
---

---
Hey. You're welcome.  
---
Yis. Medium Preset but feel free to customize anything except the sliders.   
---
Texture Quality : OK  
---
Water Quality: OK  
---
Lighting Quality: OK  
---
Shadow Quality: Meh. Do High. High is 2k. Ultra is 4k shadow resolution.  
---
Depth of Field: Doesn't matter. To your liking. 0 is "off."
---
Field of View: Impact to performance since you're seeing more, but it shouldn't matter much. Adjust to your liking.  
---
Now come the sliders you shouldn't touch.
---
Actor Fade: Don't touch. NPC Render Distance.  
---
Item Fade: Don't touch. Dropped items, etc. Render Distance.
---
Object Fade: Don't touch. Big meshes(models) like houses, etc. Render Distande.  
---
Grass Fade: Maybe don't touch. Just the area around you that grass is displayed. I'd recommend you leave it like this but if you actually see a noticeable difference and you don't like it, crank it up halfway. Not more.  
---
That's my recommendations.  
---
It all depends on your computer but what I've just said should be pretty much performance-friendly for any mid to high end computer.
---
2 x 1080 must have been great 👌🏻. I Will let you know if i need some educated input on performance tweaking later.
---
Thanks for a great post mate!
---
/Grillaren in game if you see me online when i get back on 😊
---
That's all well and good, but this game is certainly no Crysis.
---
Other games look quite a lot better while running smoother.
---
I rather have them merged so you fon't have to travel so much. It gets repetitive.
---
Keep on bitching.  Problem is your expectations.  It's like dating. Your basing this relationship off the last one. Then wonder why your not happy. Well 76 is not fallout 4. It's a new game, with a twist. Multiple players. That's not easy to acomplish. Your complaining because your spoild. Don't like it, don't play.
---
I'm pretty happy with their first attempt. It's gonna get better with time and experience. Don't get me wrong, they could have done better, sure, but they have to learn. That takes experience. So far they have 3 months of actual online game developing experience. What were you expecting, the holy grail of online games? Maybe If it were blizzard. 
---
I would do the same thing to Buzzfeed, Huffpo, NY times if i could at the amount they blatantly lie. And a DMCA claim should I believe remove monetization if not the video for the beginning couple hours were most revenue is earned. I haven't done it yet just throwing out there for the person who can and most likely will.
---
Yes, that's what I've already said. Other games "look" better but there's WAY LESS going on.  
---
Bethesda games may not look as good on highest settings but they made up for that with less performance but extreme render distance.
---
You mean like the shit that reaches the front page consistently? Things like this:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqegqn/who_else_is_expecting_bethesda_to_completely_fuck/
---
or upvoted comments like this:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqktri/why_i_despise_some_of_the_players_in_fo76/eggt3xi/
---
It's not I who've given up on the game, I'm pointing out this sub is a toxic shithole and has deservedly gotten that reputation. Or did that last comment seem particularly not "complaining because they don't like the game" to you? Did that seem like a "I'm here to improve the game"? If so, then congratualtions, there's plenty of those here!
---
The game can be improved, but being a fuckwit while expecting an ear from the developers isn't how you improve the game.
---
I have a 1\* Hunters Handmade and a Quad Hunting Rifle at level 175 and can kill everything without much effort! Yes, depending on enemy type, the ammo costs are different, but hey, where would be the fun if everything died in one or two shots?
---
There is no 'endgame weapon' imho, it totally depends on how you are willing to play your(!) endgame.
---
Rose is dead, 
---
Her Raiders are, too. 
---
But if the Gourmands were here, 
---
They'd be all over you! ♡
---
lol  
---
Yeah. Pretty good if the game supports it. xD  
---
All good. I'll add you. See you then!
---
&gt;	People act like these updates can be made overnight
---
But they will also complain when things are rushed. 
---
 I am not sure how many people were there. It's just chaos. 
---
I'd be happy if they just removed the hard limit of 200 caps on vendors.  Even if the most a single purchase increases the caps-available-for-buyback by is 200 I'd love to buy all the stuff I want then sell everything instead of jumping back and forth everytime my purchase is over 500 caps.
---
Is it all that extreme though?  
---
I can't really speak about Item fade since it's not terribly obvious when a pack of bubblegum appears on screen, but in the case of shadows for example Fallout 4 even on max (in-game) settings suffered from very obvious shadow pop-in where the cascade got drawn very close to you.
---
LOD's are another thing - look at say the Charleston Power Station from the Tea Cup location, even on max draw distance it looks laughably bad.  
---
Nope. Did it on PS3, so no mods. 
---
This 
---
It's been since patch 5, though only in full screen mode. But borderless window mode drops my fps by like 60
---
Brass catcher FTW. Even better if it’s rail mounted. To hell with chasing my brass or seeing it in a mud puddle. 
---
I've found Whitesprings (just north in the mountain area) pretty reliable. 
---
I have my base there, next to a lead vein, and regularly get the Flatwoods monster. Also got a mothman once but that disappeared.
---
I did not compare 76 to fallout 4, outstanding of anything this is a bad game with very little to do and a put emain quest. If I where to compare eit to other fallout titles I would say the quests lack compared to them, but compare dto any games quest they suck.
---
I thought a muilitiplayer game would be great, I don't really care for the next big main game or whatever people are after, I was excited and shocked we where getting a fallout game so fast after the last one, that's because this game was no where near ready and should have had another year of development at least before being released to the public.
---
This is also a muilitiplayer game being produced on a single player engine, should I be impressed by that? Sure if you like, while being impressed they managed that im embarased they couldn't use a muilitiplayer engine for a. Muilitiplayer game they're engine is old enough as it is, they usual Bethesda bugs stopped being quirky and started being game breaking. 
---
Yes, some things are set way too high.
---
Shadows on Ultra in Fallout 4 were actually already kinda overkill.
---
I know what you mean. The important bit here is to see that other games have a shorter shadow render distance but there are actually houses/buildings/flora in the way so you don't see the shadows suddenly pop in.
---
Bethesda builds their worlds a bit different. 
---
In short: It's because the games have a more open space, that's why you really notice such things. 
---
Atleast that's what I think and it makes sense to me. XD
---
This isn't me ranting for the sake of it, this is me trying to have a conversation with people and explain my veiw that if we want games to get better or be better we can't allow this behaviour. 
---
I see. Have you tried killing the configuration files yet? Might be something that's borked.
---
If you delete them, new ones are created.
---
Once they're re-generated, I'd suggest you do your settings and stuff, restart and test.
---
Most of the time this already is the way things are handled. Not just at the golf club. But we all know, this (and every other possible) world always has that one dipshit running around being an major a-hole to everyone else.
---
Fyi, r/eve is especially salty right now
---
Hunting rifle is your friend at low levels, no matters which perks you choose. Mod it for long barrel and a scope and manually aim to headshot as many enemies from sneak as you can.
---
Once you enter combat, which is fast at low levels, then switch to whatever weapon style you prefer, melee works well, but can be boring, just mix it up.
---
Always loot weapons from falling down enemies even if u don’t need it. There are 2 other benefits u can get out of them. Either:
---
- scrap them at any workbench to unlock new mods
---
- sell them to vendors to get caps (money)
---
Thank you that is extremely helpfull! I had performance issues with this game at times and I too am/was a sucker for high/ultra settings (It’s misleading as you stated so well).
---
This will do the trick. 
---
Alas, my cover is blown :)
---
I remember back in vanilla WoW - when you had to have keys for many doors across dungeons. They then invented a keyring - what a breaking invention (actually suggested by a player).
---
I really would love if Bethesday would implement something similar, keys get added to their own tab and holo tapes get their own spot on the pip boy too - not as an item but rather as an unlocked entry in a list of playable audios. I guess it wouldn't be much work but improve the quality of life a great bit.
---
Lol
---
I’ve got a 3 star TSE, third star is faster movement speed while aiming. Lvl 45 which is max. Yours for 2k if you want. Selling as I’ve just bought a bloodied h/m. 
---
Count me in! That misc and holo tab in the pip boy sometimes (and i'm polite here!) is a major pain in the lower back side.
---
It serves a function: it allows certain people to enjoy a proper modern Fallout game while still pontificate about how much they hate Bethesda. 
---
Again. You're welcome.  
---
Yeaaah, it's weird when you drop to the 30s eventhough there's a lot of headroom, right? xD  
---
It's pretty much somewhat misleading, yes. When I looked at the presets a couple of days ago, I was pretty much blown away. 'Twas like "YOOOOOOOO!" lmao  
---
Definitely will do the trick. Don't forget to let others know if you like this/think it's good.  
---
Should make others enjoy the game more as well.
---
Yeah add me Sean Smith 1992 sounds good
---
&gt;	Now even many of the previous fans have turned on the game/Bethesda, 
---
Or they have migrated here from /r/fallout. Sub populations aren't static. 
---
I drop stuff for lowbies at v76 or overseers camp. 
---
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
---
So I guess the answer to my question was 'yes'. 
---
Good to know. 
---
It could possibly help, I doubt it’ll fix EVERYTHING that’s wrong but it’s a suggestion
---
What about the scorched beast screams being delayed? :O
---
Awol Armaments 3* anti armor combat knife
---
Horde Event- Cranberry Bog 3* Berserker's Revolutionary Sword  
---
Uranium Fever 3* Nocturnal Shishkebab
---
All three came from enemies while completing the event. The actual events dropped aid, 1* armor, and crap ammo.
---
Ban? But I didn’t do anything xC
---
Yea, I actually deleted everything, including the registry with Revo uninstaller pro, and reinstalled on a different physical drive, didn't work. Tried a bunch of things Bethesda suggested too. It seems to be something they did in the patch, but not sure what.
---
Welcome to the wasteland 
---
Random burnt shit has been in every Fallout and TES game, the devs are like “hey we can get rid of these since they’re not really doing any-“
---
Todd: NO. SHUT UP. PUT THEM IN.
---
Ah, I see, I see. 
---
Don't get me wrong though; I'll just say that the configuration files are stored somewhere else and not in the game directory.
---
In case you didn't know about that.
---
Let me know if it's the case.
---
My new Fallout head canon is that actually happened in the Fallout universe, and all those burnt books and magazines are copies of Skyrim.
---
A big reason why so many are constantly defending this game is also i think the ones who not encounter the bugs we daily read about. Just my thought. Like the sbq when she is killed she dissapears &amp; that kind if bugs
---
I have over 750h gametime so i have played it yes. And i like it. But still theres too much problems
---
Ah i had this. Considering i pumped so much into the queen as well then some douche lvl 98 stole all my flux and stuff. Why is flux classed as junk anyway when plant form is classed as aid. 
---
r/fallout and r/fo76 made me realize how much I hate other fans of my favorite franchise. Everyone wants this game series to cater to them and only them while I’m here just just trying to dig up lore that expands the world these games take place in.
---
&gt; Texture Quality : OK. Adjust to your liking.
---
It should be
---
Texture Quality: Adjust depending how much VRAM your graphics card have. Highest setting is for GPU with 8GB+.
---
He literally said he’s not quitting the game, he’s only leaving the sub.
---
Are you a fan of New Vargas? Because boy do I have news for you.
---
In a completely stable fallout, yes they’re fine and aesthetically pleasing... But in a very unstable one, removing random junk could help who knows.
---
Todd wasn’t even in charge, their Texas branch was more or less the ones that made it
---
That is actually really interesting there.
---
The ones that piss me off the most - and this goes for any game - are people with 500+ hours of a game they paid $60 bitching about it's no fun anymore.
---
$60 = 5 movie tickets ==&gt; 10ish hours of entertainment.
---
You got hundreds of hours of fun &amp; enjoyment, piss off with your negativity that it wasn't an infinite experience.  They're like people who clean their plate at a restaurant but demand a refund because there was a hair in their fries.  Where's the hair?  Oh they ate that to but still want a refund.
---
Definitely. Those 1-2k resolution textures will really put a toll on your vram used.  
---
Most mid/high end modern graphic cards come with atleast 2gb anyways.  
---
Havent had mine use more than 3gb with entire areas with 4k textures ever.  
---
Takes less than you would think.
---
Dear diary...
---
I never said I was having trouble. I said I couldn’t ever find them on enemies
---
You realize all the duped items are not gone right? Everyone that ever had a duped anything still has at least one copy of it. Plus tons of people have massive stacks of ammo, flux, chems, meds, food ,water, etc.
---
Fo76 is borderline unplayable for a sizeable amount of people. Personally didn’t have many issues with bugs know new Vegas but id acknowledge it was buggy.
---
You're sent to a specific location for that quest line, Whitespring was not it.
---
" Nerf your outlook. "
---
If there's anything like a righteous murder, then this is it
---
I did make friends with a delicious steak for lunch, so there's that.
---
The entire front page was devoid of any whining.  Until this guy...
---
Consequences of DYING.
---
Suck it up, and try harder next time. 
---
&gt; talk shit about all of the fallouts except new vegas
---
You mean, just fallout 4 and 76? Yeah some peeps got like blatant bethesda hate but i think they did a pretty good job on fo3 and have just been downhill since. 
---
Fallout 4 criticism was pretty fair. Good combat, weapon modding, better power armor, neat layered armor system. Worse writing, Worse dialogue, Less interesting quest lines, terrible character building, and a settlement building systems that nobody asked for but some people love.
---
Improved the things that were never the point in Fallout and downgraded all the things that were the point of fallout in a lot of peoples eyes, myself included. Fallout 76 has just been, ya know, pretty justly shit all over. 
---
I also feel that outside of /r/fallout, any cynicism towards new fallouts is responded with accusations of being a basic Bethesda hater, or a drone who regurgitates whatever opinion is from /r/fallout. 
---
I feel like regardless of what opinion your looking at, assuming the other person is uninformed/misinformed/bandwagoning is pretty uncool.
---
The lvl of hate in some discussions is pretty annoying tho overall, tho i feel thats just a problem with redditors in general.
---
You’re right but you are going to get a ton of downvoted and comments against you. Most of the playerbase left. The only people who remain on this sub are mainly die hard fallout 76 fans. 
---
Its okay though because there are not a lot of them. This sub used to get 20 comments on every new post. Now it gets around 2.
---
I thought laser rifle counts as a rifle and pistol as a pistol, but are just crap. I think Beth said there is a large balance patch coming and laser weapons will get some love then.
---
this game is honestly a 9/10 now, even at the beginning it was decent. Just so many haters.
---
We can still see your head and hands, looks really funny.
---
Whining about whining about whining.
---
anyone want to one-up about whining about winning about whining about whining?
---
A lot of people are using the cash registers in front of the vendors at train stations for this.  Every station has one, and it's always in the same spot.
---
What is the cause of this massive lag? 
---
I had two 3\*SBQ battles today with similar results as OP. All the extra scorched meat piles just spin that pinwheel for 10+ mins just had to walk away to train station without loot. Lame
---
Even so, there is a lot of design they can piggyback off of. I just added a couple links to some really cool laser weapons in past Fallout games that would be amazing in this one. My favorite gun ever was the laser RCW and there is even a Tesla rifle handmade. 
---
ROFL, wonderful patch again Beth! Would have been a surprise if they didn't mess up anything with a new patch.
---
:) best attitude.
---
At launch New Vegas was unplayable especially on PC without mods to fix it. It took roughly 3 months to fix on console and 6 months to fix on PC. It was review bombed and considered to be the worst Fallout game at the time. Then about a year after all the DLC wrapped up it started receiving praise and suddenly people who refused to even give the game a chance at launch because of bugs started to revere it.
---
I like where you're going with this and I had a thought. They already have all of the animations for a rad storm so if it was possible to somehow link the rad storm animations, maybe up them like they're on steroids, and add them in to the nukes zones that would help a lot with the overall presentation.
---
I am sure that we will get new laser and other weapons in the future. The New content is about to start raining on us.
---
The only one I don't understand is the laser Gatling. Is that a heavy weapon? 
---
Preposterous! I naturally assumed this level 348 squeaker had no idea his TSE handmade so rare perhaps one might spawn every 400,000 drops.
---
Got in 2, 2+ hour sessions yesterday afternoon and last night. It took my base about 3 minutes to load in completely but everything seemed to be running smooth enough, but both sessions ended in CtD's though. It seems that almost all of my food spoiled during the patch. Don't know why? Just weird. We'll see how it goes. 
---
Absolutely, gun fights in parking lots are the best part of this game.
---
It's easy to find out if you have one. Equip it, look at the damage, equip heavy weapons perk, and see if the damage changes. 
---
Go to whitesprings near the side entrance toward the club house. There is a bus there with 2 grenade traps. Set them off and run like hell!
---
I've been playing it since a month after release (PS4) &amp; patch 3.  Since then it's become a lot more stable and there's been plenty of big fixes.
---
Basically, it's at a state now that I would have found acceptable at launch.
---
*cello intensifies*
---
I had it for a few days, traded it from some guy who said he didn't remember picking it up. It was totally fun booping people for 1 dmg, then running away as fast as I could.   
---
Dont recall ever seeing any mods for it, but they were unlockable options in the craft station.   
---
I ended up losing the paddle ball during a server crash when I was exchanging weapons between characters :/
---
The princess castle bed.
---
No exceptions.
---
If duping has been stopped you've got a section of the playerbase with gear that new players are basically unable to get. If dupes are still active the dupers have been left with the templates to continue where they left off.
---
Are they just going to rerun yesterdays purge every few weeks? I don't really see what this achieved if dupes are still there.
---
Ive had this happen a few times. People just need to wait a few moments for everything to load.
---
The inspector one is awesome. Or keep savin for a pa paint 😎
---
True final boss confirmed.
---
Yes, but I'm presuming red because of Nuka Cola. 
---
700.  I'll get around to making shotgun shells eventually.
---
Clean generator
---
This reminds me of the parking lot out side of sugar grove.. the cars are always blowing up. While fighting those first couple robots/turrets 
---
'Some' = most
---
yes, you might be right on that. Let's hope for the best and see after the patch has been applied. I really hope this will resolve the issue, so that I can take workshops again. The bugs in this game have been a very frustrating experience.
---
They're not gone. And they didn't lose their whole stacks either. Aaaand the devil finds a way again. I know all of this because I associate with certain people.
---
Known problem since forever.
---
I’ve been searching endlessly as well - still no luck finding the limbs. I was able to obtain the deep pocketed combat armor chest/torso plans completing the Census Violence event - post patch. 
---
I’ve been to Grafton too many times to count - both vendorbots - no luck. Same with the two BOS vendorbots - saw plans for Heavy &amp; Sturdy Combat Armor sets - no deep pocketed  or BOS plans.
---
As far as scrapping - I’ve been able to fill out all the other combat armor mods (tons of scrapping) - at this point I think the only way to obtain deep pockets is with the plans. 
---
Sure thing, bootlicker.
---
Damn, this has been my suspicion all along. Why would they bother culling duped weapons when duping methods still exist?
---
yes why is it being limited? I bought the slicked paint job for my armor, just using some of the regular atoms you get from challenges (not any I purchased, which is good) and now it seems I can't use it on really any of my armors.
---
EXACTLY! And the dupers are still duping. Its freaking hilarious to see ppl post that yesterday was some kind of miracle, it was a bump in the road for the dupers.
---
Still see the same posts in groups for multiple items, still see the same items being sold, SURPRISE Beth didn't do shit.
---
I saw one guy post that he lost the equivalent of one mules inventory, now let that sink in.
---
I hate that shit.
---
You can even link screenshots there. Directly in the title. 
---
Isn't that amazing?
---
Haven't finished to read but need to say this. Thanks for this post! I have played more than 300h on Fallout 76, and I have spent many optimizing the game, editting it's ini, settings in nvidia panel, inspector, experience....and I know the best configuration is fine tuning the inis, something you can't achieve with the game's presets.  
---
I think it was Geforce Experience that made me realize it, with their optimizations, it chose a balanced settings that I couldn't achieve via ingame presets. After finding all the information regarding tweaks and ini edits for fallout 76, I tried em all, one at a time. Have launched the game idk, 500 times? just to check effect on settings.  
---
I don't have it totally under control, but I know I have been copying and emailing me "good optimized inis" after fiddling with them like mad. Patches, driver updates etc more or less broke em, so I had to do this hundreds of times. Sadly im not that methodical so every time I "retweak" I end up with a slightly different combination of tweaks.  
---
But in conclusion, Im glad to see your post confirming my experience. The game presets are mad, and you can achieve very bad fps, or amazing fps, with almost same image quality, if you start manually tweaking settings.
---
Compared to this game in the beginning I'm not disconnecting or crashing at all anymore.. its extremely rare. Witch is nice! 
---
Yeeeees, like a trophy case sorta thing. But like a single item display. 
---
Bought it as a Valentines present to myself as it was only £9  I’m really looking forward to getting properly into it 
---
I agree with u, I do understand it would have been  frustrated to the people that bought something duped from someone, I think they should have removed all the dupe weapons for good.  Guess that can’t be done. 
---
Because I am happy about one thing Bethesda did? 
---
If you hate this game so much, and it triggers you this much, why are you even here? 
---
Caeser is the boss
---
Degenerates like you belong on a cross 🤣
---
In the context of the player economy they are basically gone.  With the stockpiles gone the rarity of the items will go up and their prices will as well.  I'm guessing the scan for the most popular duped gear with the added nika cola purge can be altered to purge all aid/junk items not just nuka colas.
---
Although, in the context of PvP you're absolutely right.  All the people using the god-tier gear still have it.
---
Sorry I don’t.  Just traded for it.
---
Because unlike others i dont feel the need to hoard every pipe pistol i find laying in a trash bin somewhere. I only keep what i need and nothing else. Inventory management is so quick and easy i dont even really notice it, i just do it.
---
Scrap, bulk, stash, all within 10 seconds, petiodically sell bulk, easy.
---
Thanks a lot. 
---
Roses are red, terminals are coded, I didn't know the gun was loaded. 
---
Energy weapons do need love and the Gauss profits from ballistic perks as for plasma weapons and the gamma gun they are out there, Spruce Knob and Relay tower DP-B5-21 spawn them from time to time.
---
Have you done the player trade challenge to get yourself to 900 atoms?
---
You're right.  They make some kind of whirly, speeding up noise. 
---
As far as I know there is no working method as of right now, only talks that people are in the process of finding a new one. Depending on who does find it they either share it within a sma group or keep it close and try not to share at all.
---
The real issue is that most if not all dupers still have small stacks of top tier gear. They lost like 300+ but still kept stack of 3-7. So basically dupers still sit at the top of the mountain because they still have small stacks of all the duped gear. And trust me, they have almost anything you could possibly imagine. From the high demand BE weapons and unyielding armours to the rarely seen explosive plasma stuff.
---
But as for now Bethesda has actually dealt with the duping issue itself. The dupers themselves just still have the economy by the balls because they still have all the various items.
---
Now that's a better end game!
---
Is that why they are in the same building?
---
Way to fact check.
---
Yean, yeah, anyway, DayZ is coming to Xbox, I doubt that there is any chance that it's also coming to PS4? 
---
It's silly that they would be classified as ballistic damage though when they are energy weapons.... Also, plasma weapons must not be that great. I've heard that they weren't. Didn't know they existed already...
---
I was doing quite a few material runs yesterday and I do have to say things were rather smooth. NPCs were loading just fine, nothing wonky from Workshop Defense events and likewise.
---
This is definitely high on my wish list as far as game QOL.  I'd like to see a modest bump on the daily limit. Perhaps push the cap limit 1800-2000 caps, and maybe allow Graham and the Charleston bot to have their own cap pools so if you find them you can get an additional 250 caps from them.
---
.. they should bring out a stormbreaker type legendary. That would be awesome 
---
Supposed to be coming this year for both consoles! I played the "prerelease" or "beta" for a bit and it's pretty unpolished right now, but I think it will be really fun at full release.
---
What sword is there at the golf course?
---
I think you should buy a pet tiger and take it for walks round the local dog park 
---
I am not a casual, I spend so much time playing I can't be considered one. On the other hand, I do not think my extreme gear nor high level mean anything about me, or anything about people who play without such dedication. I enjoy PvP, but I don't seek it via bombing camps. If I am attacked, and my opponent decides it wasn't a good idea, I stop to talk and share knowledge. I think most of the news circulating the game is bullshit, and I'm enjoying it at my own pace, as I don't need to farm anything anymore, I'm mainly PvPing, building ridiculously complicated camps, or playing as a mysterious stranger to other players (i.e. invisible sniping enemies they already tagged). My question is: is this a right place for me too?
---
Bruh. I didn't find your post. First time using reddit here for something like this.  
---
Anyway, yes. I've read what you've said.  
---
Let me keep it short then:  
---
&gt;1. Select Medium Preset  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;2. Don't touch the distance sliders  
---
&gt;3. Adjust any other settings you want
---
That's pretty much what I've found.  
---
Also, set Shadow Distance to low. Low is still 3x Fallout 4 Ultra Shadow Distance.  
---
Let me know if you try it out and what your experience is.
---
What amazing changes? 
---
I absolutely do not understand why people will simply not join a team when this happens. You get all the same xp, as well as the loot, even if you don't hit the monster. I invite people all the time and they just ignore me and then it becomes a race to see who can steal the most mobs.
---
Thanks for the reply, very interesting information :). We have such a weird economy in 76.
---
No jetpack for ultracite
---
The mistress of mysteries one for blade of bastet 
---
The most interaction I've had with an actual player is teaming up with them for about 5 minutes
---
Ceramic and pre-war money
---
The ammo for it is simply lead and steel so I see why the classify it as such, doesn't seem bullet propulsion matters much. And compared to fo4, plasma weapons in 76 need serious tuning they are terrible.
---
With duping gone, when they release the new end game content and add all the best features, plus increase the item level this really could turn out to be something special if they get it right
---
All the weapon damage perks work. Also accuracy, stagger and cripple limb stuff. And gatling laser is the most efficient weapon in the game in terms of ammo use - you find fusion cores everywhere and you get up to 1000 shots from a single one.
---
The issue is with energy resistance and durability on some of the guns. There is no way to reduce an enemy's energy resistance neither through perks nor through legendary effects. And with the way resistance works in this game, that's a huge damage penalty.
---
Even with that penalty, a gatling plasma shreds enemies to pieces. But it suffers a heavy durability loss and breaks all the time.
---
I hope they do something with the durability and energy resistance penetration. Also, would be great if explosive worked (call it a quantum burst or something and make it be affected by demolition expert maybe...). 
---
Pointless thing. If placed on second floor, smoke pours through the floor onto ground floor. Also emits smoke through walls / roof so no better than the actual generator.
---
Exactly. That's all this is. It's very likely all your TSE is duped, but now the  duped stockpiles have been removed. Hopefully that means they're confident the duping methods were eliminated, too.
---
Of course there are going to be those who aren't pleased - after all, posts are opinionated, differing from person to person, hence there being praise and the inverse...
---
Why is this so surprising? It'll be the case on any and every sub
---
Yeh or the end of the overseers quest which was uncompletable for me for about a week because the dude was dead 24 7
---
Duk ur durr!
---
Great! Now if only we had State Of Decay 2 kidnapped to PS4, I would have all the games I want(I know it won't happen).
---
Yeh I figured if there was any reason for me to post it it would be with the fans still playing 
---
This is you: "He's dishonest!"
---
This is also you: "Here is something dishonest we could do to rob him."
---
Get some principles, kid.
---
DayZ has been "pre release" for about 5 years at this point, haha.
---
Ah now i get it. You are one of those guys who bulks everything then goes to the 7 vendors to sell everything as a daily routine. Of course you don't really notice it, you trained your brain to only think of the reward you get from vendors so you don't really think of it as inventory management at all. Not everyone does that daily routine though. Some people including me don't care about caps and just trow the junk away. Which is why i would love the bigger stash the better so i can let junk pile up longer before i have to do that annoying junk cleaning part all over again that contributes nothing to my gameplay. Just an annoying thing that i am forced to do. Clean up my inventory.
---
Totally; it's just new on console.
---
Why not just make the vendors share the caps. so all have 1400 Caps. This will be much easier. Also it would be good for the economy. So i can sell my serums to vendor and not cheaper to players than they would do on vendors if they had more caps :)
---
Make it happen devs if you’re reading!
---
I told people that the economy will stay exactly the same but obviously I was argued with. Caps still have zero value and the only trades are the same old w: duped item that has been put into circulation h: duped item that has been put into circulation no caps! And I promise you 3 months from now you can come back to any trading hub snd it will still be exactly the same. 
---
You can burn the warehouse where they keep 10 000 guns but that doesn't really mean shit if the 100 000 guns that were put out into society already are still there.
---
This ^^
---
Lol if I wanted a lecture on ethics I’d go to college it is funny tho you calling me kid and you know you yourself being on reddit lmao
---
Yeah. I'll be amazed if it ever comes to full release lol.
---
Yeah, you're a piece of garbage. At least you chose an appropriate name. If the statement "the ends justify the means" makes sense to you, then you're an unprincipled idiot.
---
We must kill the plant before it grows out of control... wait... that's what the enemy is always trying to do. Does that mean we are the ecological baddies? 
---
Yep and if everyone doesn't exit the zone they get killed
---
Yah you can. It will respawn the SBQ as long as the previous event has ended. If she's still alive the extra nukes don't kill her &amp; don't start a new event. 
---
Lmao keep being mad on the internet proves my point you FO76 guys are hugbox babies my account name is satire idiot pls pls keep arguing with me you are the definition of mad at the internet XD
---
lol is Day Z still in beta? 
---
The Scorchbeast Queen was trying to save us goddammit! Them damn Chinamen built a fucking menace right under our noses!
---
Reminds me when I got a random invite from this girl and her mom. I asked what guns they had (I was 70 and they were 45 &amp;15) They didn’t have shit for guns so I gave her a TSE Handmade hahaha
---
Moments later a couple goons came by and started shooting at their base and she completely laid waste to them with the gun I gave her, felt pretty awesome :3
---
Cheers, shame it doesn't do damage to the SBQ 
---
Roses are red, Bethesda’s a whore, iv been playing for weeks where the fuck are the 3 star legendary Deathclaws
---
I done the same as you 
---
Lol yesterday we dropped 2 nukes on her in mins. One of us did the prime to spawn her, the other two in my team dropped nukes back to back on top of her. We were hopeful!! Lol. 
---
I guess you have never been to a gaming sub before. The Destiny and Division sub I read are both the same. It isn't about the sub, it's about gamers in general.
---
Thanks for that. Subbed. I know there’s problems with this game. But my SO and I enjoy getting to play a fallout game together and Beth does seem committed to fixing it which is exactly what people asked for and they’re still not happy. People really need to chill the f out. It’s just a game. 
---
i was thinking about that. 
---
they complain about little shit so much go eat poo your dumbs

---
There you go, I upvoted! I think you’re positive in upvotes now!
---
I wish that I could upvote this… a few thousand more times. 
---
Pretty sure this message or a variant of it appears on all Game Preview stuff. PUBG on Xbox had something similar.
---
Because it would disincentivize you from traveling the map. 
---
It would make the gameplay too easy. 
---
You're trying to speak logically to emotional thinkers. You're trying to make people who are mathematically inept understand statistical significance. It's a lot fight my man. Let them believe the world has changed, while people like me keep going on as usual because the ones who know, know that war never changes and neither does this.
---
If only you knew...
---
Will the amount still being sold on Ebay I would say it was an epic fail.
---
Does everyone forget this is the apocalypse?
---
It wasn't a patch, no game behaviors were changed, if it's a big it's one that was there before.  
---
the game is awesome and when the server fail and disconnct (is rare now) is a excellent moment to go in the bathroom so thans for this too bethesda 
---
That's my conclusion too. There are a lot more people out there who care more about the guns they bought and know were probably duped, than they do about actually fixing the game. 
---
My wish for valentines was custom keybinds for CAMP, Photomode and VATS.
---
No love there.
---
I'll be playing FO76 again when they add those custom keybinds so I can actually use the VATS properly and also build a CAMP without it being a massive anger management exercise.
---
You get plans for a fusion generator as a reward, which provides 100 power. Can't you just use that and ignore the powering up quest?
---
Why does it say you’re a Bethesda employee?
---
I wasn’t really one caring about it, but I find it hilarious that the Valentine’s Day Dupercure has this entire sub infighting with each other. 
---
I’m honestly not sure what they even went looking for, but my bet is they left something like bobble heads and Nuka cola out as long as you didn’t have a stack of tse, and it’s going to be hilarious when the smart dupers still have their consumables.
---
Your flair is making this sub think you’re a Bethesda employee and this comment is showing up for me as a “Bethesda Replied” comment. Hah! Also, I subbed too. I’m hoping for something a little different to read than what is constantly repeated here.
---
I've done the quest maybe 3-4 times and haven't once gotten a fusion generator plan from it.
---
No lol. If people want to play buy another account or don’t play, I had a 7-10 wait time then they said they’d get back to me. Never did.
---
And what about?
---
1. give hazmat an effect -150/75 rad resist (depends on hazmat) for every piece of armor u have on yourself? =&gt; 300/150 rad resist while having armor still on

2. buff the lead lined armor modification...
---
3. buff rad resist perk
---
non-PA users will have to spend perk points or miss some neat mods on armor to get to nuke zone... still so many disadvantages, but Problem solved
---
I've seen them do you occasionally.  They'll spawn with an automatic gamma gun once in a rare while and just fuck people up.  I snipe them from a good ways out and it's not so bad.
---
I have no idea. I use reddit almost completely on mobile. I never set any flair lmao
---
Nah, they had a lot of chances before Beth started banning people.
---
Hell no
---
So you think it's okay to release an undiniahed product?
---
Haha. That's why I run a VATS Crit build, with melee. Have you seen what you can do with a basic ass melee weapon while using Gun Fu and all the crit perks with 15 luck? You cant stand in the middle of 8 Mirelurk Kings and one shot every single one of them is succession. If a level 80 scorchbeast lands you kill them in no more than 6 or so hits with crit spam. Melee is busted and will stay busted.
---
Because 60 is more than 30!
---
Capitan hindsight here, but if you scroll through the list and just take the one with the quest icon next to it, it progress’s the quest and you only get one :)
---
I use mobile only aswell. I use a browser rather than the app. For me it shows flair as : beth : test. 
---
That's it. r/fo76FilthyCasuals is the new place Bethesda goes to now.
---
I learned shadow I think from plans so since its plans don't think you can learn it otherwise. I don't know about polymer.
---
Fair enough. Still think it would be nice though :) 
---
None of them have a quest marker on them. 
---
Yeah I see that now. Weird. I’ll hit up the mods when I get to work and can use the web interface. 
---
&gt; disincentivize you from traveling the map ...gameplay too easy.
---
Because Fast Travel is hard?
---
They do fight each other, actually. I see it all the time.
---
Ahhh.... I had this happen to me yesterday with a quest in watoga and taking the one with the quest marker progressed it for me. Mind you I do still have like 3 extras. That sucks for you though :(
---
Yet here you are, coming back and responding to me anyway. 
---
Save yourself the trouble i'm obviously too stupid to deal with if I conclude that someone selling multiple TSE's, or someone who even put in the title of one of their posts that they need to sell their stock soon with the update coming, which was posted about a day ago, is someone dealing in illegitimate items. 
---
Right before the duplicate delete wave.
---
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
---
That’s the absolute best part of the multiplayer experience. 
---
If you're on PC that was probably me. I am capped out and don't care to trade with people or engage with the market much so I either drop shit, give it to people or sell it to vendors if I spend caps on something.
---
Love a well thought out outline
---
Aww, poor li'l dude. Go have your mom get you some cheesy poof's, bud.  You'll feel better after a little snack.
---
No, if they didn’t ban people after yesterday and just removed stacks of items from players, then I would guess that the people who were banned are more guilty than they let on they are... they didn’t “just find loot”
---
Reading is overpowered, needs nerf
---
Think a large advisory post for bethesda is in order later when I get some spare time to write. Alot of simple things need improvement before anything else gets added
---
Submit a ticket Bethesda?
---
both this sub and bethesda are shit
---
I agree. It seems this whole subreddit is 90% hate mail and threats to Bethesda to stop playing and then 5% people enjoying the game and a further 5% of peoples in game pictures.
---
I would much rather see top voted posts daily of the cool things people build and find and obviously the epic narrations that some OP's provide of their quests.
---
As of this post 15 Feb strangler blooms do seem to be broken and as server hoping seems to have been curtailed it is now mostly impossible to craft RadShield at all. 
---
Just tried again, first visit to Dyer there were blooms but non harvestable, after 15 sever hops I have realised I am probably being dumped back into the same sever, the blooms never showed again and the pods were all gone too.
---
Will just forget crafting RadSheild and rely on my health mutation and stimpacks when that mutation bugs out which it mostly does.
---
Is it the one with the dead BOS soldiers in it?
---
I've been playing with my friend (when we can, she's like 16 hrs or so behind me) and we both understand that Bethesda isn't amazing, and we both understand that they could be better. 
---
But for the most part, we're enjoying the game, and I'm enjoying just having fun and talking with her about anything and everything. 
---
Lol. That's what they would say in this sub 😋 
---
Really - who cares?
---
Why don't you just PLAY THE GAME?
---
Personally I think Bethesda should give back my totally 100 % earned 1000 TSE handmade rifles and nuka colas I found in a bag from duper hunting, a refund for paying full price for the game, and refund all the caps I spent on duped items. This game is broke, and if you defend it or Bethesda you're part of the problem. 
---
 i usually had terrible experiences with other companies tho but ill try.  I was hoping someone had a similar problem.
---
Isn’t there a meme with a dog in a house on fire and he says “this is fine”
---
Yeah. Insert that meme here
---
They are broken, no blooms for you.
---
I made a cowboy that limits me to single action, double barrel, lever action, tomohawk and bowie knife.  Fun ass trip and really makes you want a single action reload animaiton fix lol... makes me miss the cowboy perk from New vegas.
---
It's min-maxing. It's what separates a good built from an excellent one.
---
This. This right here. I have all my bobbleheads and magazines saved in my stash, waiting for the day they implement this.
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.altchar.com/games-news/583928/sonys-feature-shows-fallout-76-doesnt-have-millions-of-players/amp
---
This is the closest data you’ll get, coming from Sony since bethesda is literally hiding their playercounts from the public, and it shows a player base of around 400,000 on ps4 noting it was published dec 17. That’s within a few weeks of release. Now, noting that lots of games lose 70-80% of their player base after a month, with particularly bad ones like no mans sky losing 88% in 2 weeks;
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/concurrent-players-no-mans-sky/
---
Fallout 76 could easily have been under 50000 players within the month on ps4. 
---
At this point? I think it’s safe to say that number is even smaller.
---
I've sumbitted quite a few tickets to Bethesda, and when it was regarding an in-game issue directly related to oneseld like this I've always gotten a response within a few days.
---
Wow this is the most corporate bootlicking comment I've seen in a while. 'Lower your standards and stop expecting good games'.
---
&gt;So far they have 3 months of actual online game developing experience. 
---
Ah, you're one of those people that thinks development starts on release day I see? You know object permanence is a basic development of the human brain?
---
Its a carryover from FO4 and i honesty have no idea why its not fixed yet.
---
Ikr... the two shot pipe bolt action I found made my sniper a bit too OP for large targets.  Can't imagine how dumb adding explosive would have been.
---
You do realise Day has been fully released on PC? It's on 1.01 now.
---
There wasn't supposed to be any new content.
---
No trouble here. If you don't want to talk, don't. 
---
But your whole post and all that, make no sense. You have no fucking idea about anything.
---
On Xbox yes. It's fully released on PC. The game is coming along very well now.
---
Your right, using all 3 level 3 perk cards is very situational, im a melee player and i can use all of them plus the ninja one that makes you swing faster but i instead i use 1 medical weight reduction perk card. 
---
i put on a set of unyeilding armor and i can glass cannon a super sledge up to 600 damage but i have shit survivablity at this point so i dont know how people avoid being 1 shotted with 100 health. 
---
https://youtu.be/GhVaUMo4S4s
---
Go get a Snickers, bud.
---
That's only 30 caps. Barely worth the trouble 
---
I was hoping for more self reflection than that. Just because you put emotion into the things you argue doesnt mean I do. I just hate to think that out in the world somewhere is a young man that never learned morales and principles. Its important for a man to be both stoic and principled. Consistancy is very important and seems to be underrated right now. I know that you know better, or I wouldn't have said anything at all.
---
You can one shot most level 63 enemies from stealth, i can one shot most of them them without being stealthy. That's why using max rank cards is worth it.
---
Also your play style really matters. I use a lot of rifles, instigating mainly, zealot dragon vs SB, .45 quad lever for small groups of enemies, .50cal sniper for weaker enemies and for when i want to save my .308 shells, i even have a 2shot sniper rifle for whenever i want to manually aim. The point is i use rifles for everything, i have weapons for every situation. Maximizing the damage output i can do with those weapons is important.
---
You pretty much have to chose, do you want to be heavily specialized in one type of gameplay so you have to go all in on  that, or do you want to be some kind of jack of all trades master of none. 
---
I'm sure you can deal with content just fine, but someone focused on a build will always do better than you.
---
You realize those level 40+ ghouls wouldn't have been there if the very same high level dude wasn't in your map cell? 
---
Still, nice story. You could even say he had a moral responsibility to help. Multiplayer caused the problem but is also the solution with guys like him around 
---
Ok, since you decided to form a narrative for this in a completely strange way, allow me to fix it for you.
---
In no way, shape, or form is engaging in a community **FORUM** playing the game. You can't play a forum, that's not how video games work. I can read every post, watch every YouTube video and still *not* play the game.
---
Bethesda released a cash grab, got what they wanted, and started playing it down. My friends and I all realized this and stopped playing the game. It's an unfinished, unpolished turd and I'd rather spend my time actually playing something that works and is actually fun and not 'bang your head against the wall' repetitive 
---
I don't actively go out of my way to come to the subreddit. I've just been too lazy to unsub from it. I only happen to cross paths with this particular thread because it showed up as I was scrolling through the front page. Ive maybe commented on 3 or 4 posts in regards to Fallout 76 since it's release 
---
"released" with less content than it had two years ago lol
---
The feral ghouls were lining up earlier and earlier each day. Arch, amazed at how well his business was doing, never thought fertilizer would be in such high demand. His parents had disowned him when he said he was moving to Appalachia with just a single brahmin, thats 2 head. He was up to 5, 10 head, and planned on getting more soon as his C.A.M.P. budget was increased. 
---
Yeah I havnt been here longer than a month or so and I’be already stopped visiting, it’s just miserable and there is nothing constructive here for in game stuff. 
---
Hopefully I can try it after work, and won’t crash then! 
---
That’s been the biggest issue so far for me; server stability and crashes. 
---
I used the Blade of Bastet until level 50 - the blade works with power armor, and you can upgrade it every 10 levels, which helps. It has good damage and some armor penetration, IIRC. 
---
Once you get to level 50, as others are saying, it is good to switch to the All Rise. At that point, you're hunting things like scorchbeasts and the scorchbeast queens, so you want as much damage as possible. 
---
Use your new-found flair powers for good:  Publish your own roadmap.  Once you, A BETHESDA EMPLOYEE, puts it out there it becomes law. 
---
I know for a fact one that did
---
Downside to.inspector, is that it is classified as under armor, so it removes the good stuff you have and replaces it with non modifiable crap. 
---
There are 3 plans that drop from the Powering Up events.  Large Generator, Windmill, and Fusion.  Once you a powering up event 3 times you will have all of them.
---
That said, the last major update that changed the Vendor Plan system put the Plan for the Fusion Generator always available from places like Harper's Ferry and Watoga.  Less than 400 caps with Hard Bargain 3.
---
The Fusion Generator plans were the only worthwhile thing from the Powering Up events.  But now that you can get them when ever you want for very little caps, the events are pointless.
---
Yeah, well I think you should go make out with a 9-volt battery. 
---
Only great ideas here; I'd vote for the "You already have this item." approach, makes life very easy, and you can't do anything with excess keys anyway.
---
Their loss I guess.
---
Zenimax online (the devs for ESO) are in an entirely different town than beths dev and pub branches.  They do have an office in Austin, where the dev team for FO76 are, however they didn't work on the development for fallout.  
---
It is 5 or so different companies that you are lumping together.  They may all be owned by zenimax, but that don't mean they all hang out and work int he same building and share workloads.
---
A better question would be why they didn't get zeni online studios help with the networking as they had a lot of experience unfucking ESO during its first year of miserable gameplay.
---
Obviously not, me a lowly internet stranger. Thank you for educating me sir/ma'am superior human. 
---
I have learned my mistake and will never post again without your explicit permission.
---
Thank you for doing your duty to the world by simply dismissing a post as stupid without providing any evidence or counter statements. Without people like you, who dont back up their claims, we wouldn't have such bastions of free speech and intelligence as the anti-vaxx community, flat earthers, climate change deniers, or the entity of r/conspiracy.
---
You truly are a testament to mankind. 
---
Yes, because they're remaking everything on the new engine.
---
Integrity? This is how the game works, in case you are new to it. When you die, anyone can pick up your loot. If your really stupid and fight queens with flux in your inventory, then thats what happens. Soooo tired of people crying because they dont know how to stash their flux.
---
You took it all way out of context. I'm not even going to rebuttal because you already have your mind made up, and would rather insult someone vs trying to see things from a different prospective. With that have a good day. 
---
I've read that with the issues regarding "Sneaking" (always caution, even if enemies no where near by) it also causes issues with the "outside of combat" effects.
---
I would say complaining is the only thing keeping this game alive
---
Oh nice this was the bug that made me uninstall. Might reinstall next few patches or something lol.
---
Oh right, so it's an issue with the out of combat state rather than the mutation? Thanks for the clarification.
---
AMEN!!!!!!!!
---
Or their win.
---
First, I want to say "Thank You" to Bethesda for deleting as many of the Duped items you could without affecting the innocents, I was pleased to find my thousands of legitimately crafted Diluted Stimpaks intact when I logged in yesterday.
---
I also want to thank you for the improved server stability, I had no disconnects with 4 hours of gameplay yesterday.
---
But...Something is broke with legendary drops,  and Treasures seem to have been significantly nerfed or something.
---
I went all over Watoga &amp; surrounding area yesterday, and never found a single legendary, then proceeded to WhiteSprings, where I killed 9 legendary Ghouls but only looted a legendary item from one of them, all others had only a Bobby Pin &amp; Wonderglue, also hit several other areas that typically spawn at least one Legendary enemy, and found none.
---
I've been chasing down Treasure locations periodically for the past couple weeks, I saved all maps till I got past level 50, hoping to get max level stuff, now over level 125, just getting around to it, I have done some in the Mire (#1 seems to be very common as I have many of them), and a couple in the Cranberry Bog (#3 several times), and have gotten decent loot from them in the past, but after tracking down 5 of the Savage Divide locations last night, I was very disappointed in the loot, which consisted of mostly junk items, low level guns, and sometimes a cheap common plan. I'm not sure if this is a newly created issue, or if it's always been that way for the Savage Divide area Maps, but either way it's disappointing to spend 10-15 minutes searching for a location only to be rewarded with stuff I could have picked up in Flatwoods in 5 minutes.
---
Or... their draw...
---
Yeah i can understand if you want to share your opinions how to improve the game but cant stand the fact that people are complaining about the same issue all over again and pittying them self because they bought the game and didnt get what they wanted.
---
Status inflictions, maybe. Could also shred resistances.
---
We're talking past each other. 
---
You take for granted that fairness matters, and keep spending your time on passing judgement on what meets your fairness bar and what isn't. 
---
I haven't gone on the journey with you yet. You're on your own thinking it matters in a game like this.
---
Or their Deathclaw
---
You can get polymer from scrapping. Just keep on scrapping arms (cheapest) and you will unlock it eventually. For shadow you have to farm plans,but I don't know if they exist for legs.
---
Good luck and don't forget super super and armorer. 
---
1700 here as I type this. That is the lowest I have ever seen it. Update #5 had 8000 here. Not a good sign.
---
I think so!  
---
I did not realize this. I have no interest in the game so I have paid no attention to it. Thank you for letting me know.
---
SBQ is a duper!
---
I dont have any duped items nor have I cheated. I just think toxic hyperbole statements shouldn't be taken seriously. 
---
i havnt gotten a patch
---
Yes
---
I’m sorry you’re getting negative feedback. 
---
I think you’re doing wonderful work.
---
Keep it up!
---
Nope
---
Always check the nuclear silo holotape. 
---
na, I'll leave it up.
---
Go do the Mistress of mystery quest.
---
Get Blade of Bastet. you can upgrade it, as you go up levels.
---
Also you get to do the Mistress of Mystery Quest :)
---
Wait.  The cool down is 2 hours now?  When did this happen?  I thought it was 1hr. 
---
What do you expect when they pull all the fun out of the game and just make it a melee grindfest, i only stay in hopes that theres an update that will add fun to the game
---
&gt;So assuming that you agree with the other points: namely, that seeking a safe space is a cowardly act, that bravery is the opposite of cowardice, and that bravery is a very positive thing.
---
This is by far and away the absolute dumbest reach I've seen on here.   Trying to compare a video game to bravery when im saying seeking out a safe space is completely weak minded or cowardly.   Jesus I feel like you're trying to sound like a protagonist but you're coming off as a poorly written side character. 
---
&gt;The definition of bravery that I googled from Merriam Webster is: "the quality or state of having or showing mental or moral strength to face danger, fear, or difficulty". 
---
So proud that you can use Google.   Good for you now let's get you a sticker. 
---
&gt;Are you implying that the Fallout 76 subreddit is a source of danger, fear, and difficulty? I wouldn't.
---
No that's not even close to what I'm implying and you'd have to be a complete dumbass to come to that conclusion. 
---
&gt;I agree with OP in thinking that it's a smelly cesspool of negativity. It's like a bathroom at a third-rate back alley stripclub: lots of piss on the floor, it smells bad, the toilet is clogged with...something, and you don't want to touch anything. It's nasty.
---
Except it's not that.   At all.   Just because someone posts about the game being historically bad doesn't make it a cesspool it means you're too weak to handle a different opinion.  
---
&gt;But you could go to the bathroom next door at Madame Bouffont's Tea Shoppe because she's nice like that. Sure, the crochet doilies and pink tea cozies are a bit much, but the tea sandwiches are tasty and the other customers don't try to stick a knife in you.
---
Just what the fuck are you talking about lmao this is so pathetic.  No one here is trying to stick a knife in you.   Can't believe you're actually comparing different opinions to attempted murder lmao
---
&gt;That's not bravery or cowardice. That's just *common sense* you dumb fuck.
---
And reported lol 
---
I got disconnected twice last night but compared to my past experience that’s a huge improvement.  
---
The different perspective being that all the time they spent building and developing the game before they released it doesn't count as 'actual online game developing experience'?
---
Then wouldn't it be better to compare active users when the next Update releases?
---
&gt;Not a good sign
---
For Reddit?
---
He "came in like Thor from Avengers Infinity War."
---
OP, thanks for posting this. Very helpful given my graphics struggle. What does what, exactly, how do I minimize the framerate hits, why am I just sliding things to low all over the place? I'll take your advice and try it out today. Appreciate the OC, thanks again!
---
I love the game. Fallout has been my favorite franchise since the first one came out on PC and I. From WV. I have one small suggestion. We have so many indigenous wild edibles I was surprised they didn't make it into the game no biggie at all but it's super common for folks here to go looking for ramps, morel mushrooms, and ginseng.
---
Hey, don't be. I don't think it's negative feedback. It's probably people seeing a lot of text and they don't like it. Haha  
---
Thanks. I thought I'd let people know but if they turn it down, well, what're you gonna do?  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
I'm enjoying the game more now than I ever had. Feels good not to have to worry about what happens to my gear, and it's nice Bethesda is updating so often. Hopeful for next month's content patch. It's important to realize that the player base at launch probably won't be the same player base five years from now. The game will find its niche like any other multiplayer game
---
Yup. Hoping it's fixed in the upcoming patch, but I haven't seen any confirmation on it yet.
---
Lol how dare you try to help 
---
A. it was a joke. and B. You don't *have* to go to the specific location and interact with that specific deathclaw. You can use any deathclaw. I know this because I completed the quest using the one over on Deathclaw Island by the fairgrounds. 
---
&gt; But my SO and I enjoy getting to play a fallout game together
---
Hey, by any chance, did you two happen to friend a PS4 player called Monkey_junky the other day? I ask because that's me, and I met a couple who were playing together and one of them said they were an active Reddit-user, and I figure it doesn't hurt to ask! 
---
Silver shroud
---
Hey, you're welcome. Thanks for your comment as well. Shows me that it was worth writing this. 
---
It may seem like youre sliding it a lot to low but I think I've covered that in the post already.
---
I feel you.
---
Definitely try it if you want and let me know how it goes. :)
---
I'm aware there are other opinions than my own; that's why I shared mine. Scrolling through this sub, I find stark amounts of criticism and skepticism, given how things are objectively progressing with F76's release and development. I have yet to see a stream of the game without massive glitches, both visual and functional. I still can't find an engaging hook, that hasn't been mastered by some other title, like settlement building or a progression in lore or a crafting and leveling system that doesn't look like a grind. Even if I someday decide that this game is more than a micro-transactional grind simulator, it's not clear how I go about purchasing the game. I could buy it from Bethesda's Amazon store for $38, or I could go to the local GameStop for $59, a sketchy $18 on eBay, $49.99 from Walmart online, $29 from Walmart in person, $53 from Humble bundle, $0 if I buy a new console from most places, $29 for the Wasteland survival pack from a local Best Buy. How long before it's in an actual Humble bundle for free? How long before it's free to play? All of these mismanaged factors create confusion and a complex barrier to play for someone without a lot of free time to throw at every single title that comes out. I have work, a family, a house, external responsibilities - I don't have the time and money for a game that just isn't an interesting and fun experience. It's cool that some people hold out hope and I'm genuinely surprised I put so much time into tracking this game, but, again, the lack of skepticism and the way criticism is treated as toxicity is neither healthy nor helpful for anyone other than Bethesda.
---
Mine doesn't. Remake it? 
---
Yes but don’t know why...
---
When I got on yesterday, went to the Whitesprings Nuke Zone, Loot was taking a long ass time to load the loot of whatever I looked at, when I did pick up a Legendary it was at least 1 and an half minutes before it even popped up on the screen like they normally do, But after I left that area, I went down to Watoga and everything was running a lot better and the longest loot load time was like a 2 seconds.
---
Indeed. In 4, I loved going to the airport parking garage and letting them blow up like dominos...all the way down.
---
Well FO76 is literally one of the worst games ever made, had historically bad launch, and has been mired by problems ever since so of course people are leaving. 
---
The only way so far I've been able to find that makes energy weapons actually work is sneak critical build with every single possible perk of luck into criticals. That means you get around the clock criticals and insane action point regeneration as well as the sneak bonuses. 
---
Pretty much already dug my own grave. Even if I could delete my post, people would still somehow give me shit. If not here, then in my dreams. lmao  
---
Just how things are, I suppose. xD
---
This is the first game that I've actually used Reddit for. The rest were all game forums. Don't know that you can judge just by this.
---
Your comment really confuses me.
---
Like 15 minutes ago, on PC. I think the cooldown is 3 hours but I spent 30 minutes on reporting the previous crash to Bethesda, then prepared for the run with another 30 minutes of scavenging for ammo/repairs.
---
?
---
Effin mole rats stuck underground following you around. Don't know if that's every time, but it know that's what happens to me sometimes. 
---
My weapons, stack of 450 Ballistic Fiber and rest of my junk is still safe. I don't know about anyone else but I'm glad Bethesda hasn't seemed to have caught anyone innocent in the purge.
---
Dunno, I (L29) regularly wind up facing L40 opposition when solo in areas around there - there can't always have been a ~L40 char through before me. Presumably enemies spawn within a range dependent on your level as opposed to your level X char will always spawn level Y enemies in a particular location... 
---
Occasionally I'm finding L60-70 mobs which I'm putting down to higher level chars in the area. 
---
I'd like to check this out
---
No, but it gets expensive.
---
I'd rather walk from R&amp;G Station, to Lewisburg, to Welch, over to Camden Park, and then up to Charleston, instead of fast traveling to every one of them. 
---
Sorry ment as a reply to post that it counts as an under armor. Had one do this I scrapped it and made another prob solved.
---
Don't play than. Nobody cares. Complaining and trying to arguing with randoms like me gets you nothing. You look childish. Good day.
---
It sad and I do it. But this sub is pure shit. People on here are praising a fucked up game from a multi million dollar company, that they paid many dollars for and are happy for every little change. It’s just ridiculous and very submissive. 
---
Bethesda has to deliver A LOT and there is absolutely no point in applauding people doing their job which they ducked up in the first place. 
---
Everything that happens now, with all the patches, are things that should be normal since before release. 
---
If anything! It should read: finally they fixed X or implemented Y. 
---
But too many little sissies are on here, sucking dicks from the developers for omissions from the start of the game. 
---
Location? 
---
I honestly don't think you need to reduce energy resistance though. It just needs to be buffed just a little bit more. Let me ask you. Why do you think it needs to reduce energy resistance? Laser rifles, for example, fire much, much faster, and especially more accurate than the handmade does. They are a fuck of a lot faster than the hunting rifle which is incredibly slow. The hunting rifle can probably be compared to the gauss rifle which sadly isn't an energy weapon by some means... No idea how that works out. But it is definitely the most powerful weapon in the game. If you use gauss rifle mainly and maybe a Tesla rifle or other fast firing energy weapon on the side, you should have no problem killing anyting. hell, you can even use the Gatling laser up close when there is a horde of enemies flooding you, and switch back to the gauss rifle when it's far away
---
I have 1000 empty Holotapes and i don't know even why... Just in case maybe 
---
The last time I saw him I was getting super pissed at the camp construction, when I hear
---
 “CONGRATULATIONS! TODAY’S YOUR LUC-“
---
And then he ate some 7.62 and I felt better.
---
And yet you chose to post when it gets you nothing.

Because it goes up in increments of 20% not 30%.

It just works

You’re clearly to young to remember Derek Smart’s [Battlecruiser 3000AD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlecruiser_3000AD) .  
---
THAT was a clusterfuck of a title. 
---
Nothing has changed gameplay wise so I'd say it's still not for you
---
The only people who will remember the launch five years from now will be players who played the BETA. Do you remember any other bad launches off the top of your head? Sure you might remember a game's poor launch but you'll forget the details
---
I'm not trying to argue. I've asked you to leave me alone twice. You don't listen tho. For the third time, good day.
---
Doing my first "Line in the Sand' event since the maintenance yesterday. Each wave of scorched there only 1 mob. Used to get at least 5 or 6 scorched a wave.
---
An Automatron like DLC in Fallout 76 that actually sounds like fun especially for us lone wolves.
---
Yeees yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's so funny to watch the fireworks
---
There's nothing 'blind' about being angry that Bethesda didn't fix these problems, *and many others,* before the game launched for $60.
---
Played 2.5 hours last night (Xbox) and had 2 disconnects.  I typically had 1 per 4 hours or so of gameplay before.  Whitesprings (main and golf course) load times seemed the same.  The time it waits for server not responding to disconnect seems to have been increased.  Before after server doesn't respond for about 10 second it seemed to drop, now it sits on server not responding for \~30 seconds before a disconnect.
---
Duping has nothing to do with "smooth gameplaying" currently. Main reason for smoother experience is that servers are pretty much empty now when compared to few weeks earlier. Majority of the gamers have already lost their interest to play, because there is nothing to do anymore.
---
This is the Proof. The people who play wrong the game destroy the game and server, it's just not Bethesda 
---
I have some ammo that I am quite sure is duped. But I guess 5000 ammo is not big enough to be removed.
---
Yeah, well. I think people who support the 'let the dupers keep one of everything' approach are making the game environment more toxic to legitimate players, and shouldn't be given much credence. 
---
I think that is at Spruce Knob Lake. If there was a Mirelurk Queen nearby.
---
Serums rely on stable flux.

My all time favorite FO4 mod, was the one that makes Preston Shut the hell up.

What
---
Wtf does this post even mean?
---
Your post history suggests the weight anyone should afford your comments.  
---
In short bad database design. My bet is there database schema uses queries instead of keys. 
---
Queries get exceptionally inefficient the more data you have. 
---
Queries are like reading am ancient scroll, you have to read the whole thing until you find your place.
---
Keys are like having a table of contents in a book.
---
Guns bad, Melee good.
---
&gt;game from AAA dev released in a shit state, surrounded by controversy due to poor decisions and borderline illegal bait 'n' switches and continues to be plagued by mistakes and even more poor decisions.
---
"Y'all can't be pleased by anything"
---
K den.
---
Unfortunately I feel like the amount of content they release would have the be stupendous to bring back this game at this point. They need to focus on releasing a large amount of high quality content. Not the crappy story content that comes with the base game.
---
I’ve heard that some of the sharp rocket sledgehammers can actually do more damage but it can’t be enough to mess with all that from scratch....for me at least 
---
Patches that broke stuff they previously fixed. Patches that failed to address simple bugs and spelling errors that were catalogued by the community several times over the past few months.
---
Nice!
---
BUT
---
What about connection issues?!
---
Im getting those every 30 min or so!
---
Really annoying if I’ve spend time and ammo, gunning monsters down, to get through a mission, then get connection error, and have to use ammo again, to start all over! 👎
---
The other 3000 got tired of all the whiny bullsh*t, and non-stop "I'm leevin furevor", "Bethsasa stull ma ghuns", and "totally not a dooper, these 25 TSE's are legit", shiatposts.
---
They're just about on the same footing to me 
---
That's the thing though, the server needs to *know* what you have, because it can't just make up what keys you have on the fly. It doesn't matter what it shows the player, the server still has to keep track of what you have access to.
---
Or lack thereof 
---
I'll let you figure that out on your own.
---
Yeah I remember bad launches.   Just to give examples I remember the hype for NMS and The Division.   Luckily they figured it out though relatively quick. 
---
I use that perk solely to keep raw flux alive until I can process it.  
---
Have r/fo76FilthyCasuals gone up by 3k? They've been recruiting hard of late :)
---
Would be nice but for now just google it
---
yes theres absolutely no reason why one instance needs to be confined to one server.  infact if their storage is awesome enough, it can sprawl across multiple servers.  and where that server isnt relevant to end consumer.  it can be hosted by microsoft, amazon cloud or even physically sitting at a bethesda server farm(in IT world thats called on-premises cloud).  everythings virtualized these days, modular virtual images sitting on whatever has space and horsepower to run it.  
---
&gt; It sad and I do it. 
---
I stopped reading after the next sentence.
---
I hope you find yourself in a happier place. Hanging around a game forum you don't even play to shit on it can't be good for mental health.
---
Hope you have a good weekend bud.
---
If you like the idea of a theme, like a True Blue Vault Dweller with shiny Vault Tec equipment or maybe a full-on Red Rocket Mechanic, even just having all your gear camo'd out while you're bunkered down in the Mire like a real Free-stater... This all can get a little expensive. Don't fall into that trap unless you're wanting to grind those atoms. So pick safe stuff that's cool on its own, like the fish bowl lamp. Everyone likes the Fishbowl lamp
---
I see it at Watoga evertime I'm there.
---
I asked this a month ago. Ta anyway 
---
Exactly. I have been lurking here to see how bethesda is holding up and so far all they have been doing is just fixing things that shldnt have needed to be fixed. And it sucks that negative opinion always gets downvoted and "positive" opinions praising bethesda for something they shld already have fixed gets upvoted tremendously. Imo both shld be held in moderation as all things shld be. 
---
It's a shame that the fans are being blamed for Bethesda's failures. We just want Bethesda to deliver a game that they have proven capable of delivering. Instead we have a buggy mess and people who claim to be fans telling us that if we complain we're haters.
---
Fixed
---
30-40 min? Takes me 10 mins tops. But I see your point. I dont generally do the event anymore now that I have the fusion gen plans
---
This says a lot about the game.
---
Tldr: BETHESDA, WAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
---
Is this for real? Hard to believe the lvl 45 dude with this on that was whooping my ass wasn't even wearing real armor. Maybe I just suck.
---
Why would buyers hesitate in any way?
---
I'm with you on point to benefit efficiency but it makes for the most efficient benefits build, not the most effective combat build.
---
Like a jack of all trades, master of none sort of situation.
---
It's because damage is calculated per hit. If a shot does 100 dmg and your enemy has 200 energy resistance, you'll actually hit it for 50 dmg or something (50%). If your shot does 20, you will do like 5 damage (75% less) even if it's the same enemy. Anti-armor is beast for high fire rate and you also get a perk that does 45% penetration in heavy or 36% for ballistic. You get nothing for energy and energy weapons do little per shot. Prime two shot gatling with charged barrels does less than 60 per shot... Gatling plasma that's still less than 100... Energy resistance for SB, SBQ goes into 200+. Same for high level super mutants. Even on the strongest per shot weapons the penalty is big. Compare it to a handmade or gauss with 100+ per shot and armor penetration... 
---
Yeah. I mean...wow. Inventory increasing should NOT be destabilizing your servers by any means. If it did, then...Jesus. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/search?q=fallout+market
---
I also want to point out what mods you have on your items also affect the condition bar. For example: an aligned stock gives your laser rifle a small condition bar, but a forceful stock gives a massive condition boost.
---
A pattern I noticed is the more mods/higher level mods a weapon has, the weaker it’s condition bar will be.
---
An items level will also affect condition. A level 50* hunting rifle will have a bigger condition bar compared to a level 30* hunting rifle.
---
*Cant remember if the hunting rifle is a 10,20,30 weapon, or a 15,25,35 weapon. 
---
That's not true. Even if you played with a few people on the server you encountered the "loading" circle on containers and enemies.
---
Crafting a flamer gives you a full tank? Awesome!
---
It's hard to have a decent AMA when you're in a mad chat of trolling
---
I got lucky, mine goes through wall towards the smoke of my water purifier.
---
For plans? Yes, and also a list of required perks.
---
That is a good point.  I’m still optimistic but that does really suck for a lot of people.  Hopefully we can make it right in the wasteland because I think we can all agree that the community in this game is one thing that hasn’t disappointed.  Thanks for all the good vibes!
---
Real men eatthe can as well.
---
I guess they got bored of the constant tantrums going on over here.
---
Can't blame them, it's really sad and embarrassing to see adults crying on the Internet because of a videogame.
---
What do you mean by "are worth it? Are you suggesting that having a focused build is not as valuable (worth) as just picking many, random perk cards?
---
Perhaps the play strategy would be to shoot a few times with a pistol, do a little damage, change to a rifle, do a little more damage, then finish them off with a melee weapon?
---
200 lbs of junk on you while fighting the queen?  Sounds like you where asking for that to happen.  It sucks but jesus put your junk in your stash
---
Read a comment yesterday that was getting upvotes. Basically said we should be tanking the dupers cause they provided a valuable service of being able to get the weapon you wanted with out having to grind. 
---
So you know its possible.
---
I like the idea that pacifist mode carries over to CAMPs. But rather than make it invincible, why not just make it free to repair? Basically an "if-and-then" code.
---
*If* item is pacifist status
---
*and* item is destroyed by hostile player
---
*then* repair cost = 0
---
I feel like this lessens the likelihood of unintended consequences on the update. Like, say, workshops owned by players with a pacifist teammate having invincible turrets because the turret was built by the pacifist teammate.
---
&gt; Takes me 10 mins tops
---
Sounds like a BS brag to me.  You'll spend 10 minutes just sitting on loading screens while moving in and out of the different parts of the power plant.
---
Come Hunt my Bounty, with your Dragon so Slow, A re-spawn location is where you will Go.
---
Hunt for me, search for me, Invisible I am, and fixin to kill you with this thing on my hand.
---
My perception is high, and my Agility is great, I'm really hard to kill, so please don't Hate.
---
My armor is strong and blends with the trees, my weapons are crippling and hard on your knees.
---
So if it's my bounty you must hunt, better stop by your camp and store all your junk.
---
Okay. If you haven’t found it by tonight I’ll see if I can find it after work
---
Are you sure it isn't just the overlap bug shared with the Nuka-Rocketsuit? (Both of the costumes have gloves, which remove any underarmor that comes with gloves. So Brotherhood Fatigues and Road Leathers are ok but the BOS Knight Suit isn't)
---
Only one loading screen.  I just have done the event so many times I can run through it ignoring the enemies.  So yeah. It is kind of a brag but it's not BS
---
Does the Atom Shop have a gamer tag icon or emoji for Troll?
---
Again, that means gauss rifle should receive a heavy Nerf because it's not ballistic.  the ammo is definitely ballistic because it is a cartridge. Sure. But it's an energy shot. So they either need to buff all the energy weapons exponentially, or Nerf gas rifle extensively
---
Gauss rifle is ballistic damage. 
---
Not possible with the Engine used.
---
Happens to me, and I can’t leave the sneak “danger” thing

What's the best place to nuke to get the most cobalt flux?
---
I need it to upgrade my vault suit, I've only managed to make one stable cobalt flux so far.
---
Yeah, those games had poor launches but after a couple of years they actually turned them around and they both had a solid player base throughout.
---
 When I was thinking of an example of a bad launch that most don't remember I was thinking of ESO, which actually had to drop its sub fee because of how bad the reviews were. But after four years, people actually recommend it as an MMO!
---
This game will probably turn out to be the latter rather than the former is what I'm saying. We just have to see what they add as the game updates. Polygon actually put out a positive headline, what's up with that?
---
it is one of a few in recent years that i myself picked up. maybe not THE worst. i've walked away from worse * cough* tera
---
Wouldn't it make sense that the people that have the most play time would be the ones to encounter most of the issues and also be the ones mostly effected by the issues? Also not trying to be rude, but I don't think forgetting any responsibilities for a game is healthy. 
---
Maybe in the future with other cap uses, but right now with no changes it can actually be harmful. 
---
I never have cool shit like this happen to me. I just die. A lot.
---
Does anyone know if the timer is per player or per server? I assume per player given what the OP indicated. I always look forward to seeing more than one blast zone on the map.
---
No don't.  Make a long password.  That's it.  Look up xkcd password for an explanation.
---
You can find single use dense mods for marine armor pretty regularly at vendors (Watoga and Harper's Ferry). They seem to be non-existent for combat armor. I'm trying to learn it via scrapping but haven't had any luck so far.

I didnt buy it and you could easily go melee - its unfair for me that u can hold ur cheated weapon 
---
Costumes already.go over armor, no reason that wouldn't apply to protective helmets. Or make the costume headgear confer protection.
---
Accusing people of being childish just because you don’t like what they say doesn’t reflect well upon yourself. Just a tip.
---
It’s almost as if this is a garbage sub filled with garbage posts made by garbage babies.
---
That live in a garbage house.
---
Dense mod + rank 3 of Fireproof and you can stand on a car while blowing it up and you won't take any damage. You'll also be immune to scorchbeast sonic attacks. It's great.
---
The game has its ups and downs but it is still a really fun game to play.
---
One rank of each is more "efficient" but it comes down to your play style.  You could do one rank for melee, pistols, and rifles and be a decent jack of all trades or you can do all 9 ranks and specialize in one.  Personally I'm in between...I did 3 of Rifleman then 2 of expert, and 1 of master.  Used the other 3 points for tank killer which depending on what you are fighting is more efficient.
---
Not even in the same ballpark. 
---
They could be running sql for everything instead of sql for UID generation and nosql for storage.
---
Nosql is great for data tied to users since you can create all your data into individual sub key types under each user and the run gets on user data.
---
I was the same way. Yeah, it's not perfect, but I still have fun with it.
---
I appreciate the feedback.
---
Just recently bought the game and while you only hear bad things, most of the good are overlooked. I’ve had nothing but fun since I purchased this game, from creating my camp to exploring abandoned building to fighting and running from enemies it’s all been great. Sure it gets a little laggy and seems broken but it’s super fun once you get past those things
---
I just want a fun experience
---
I bought weapons from dealers I grinned  everyday because the cap on caps was for  constant player logging In daily, I am def not praising duper’s that’s asinine , honestly I think that boiled down to BGS game design that has lots of RNG , if they had a system in place you can get the legendary you want through gameplay IE Diablo so you still have to grind just not be as lucky this shenanigan would never have started in the first place
---
Once you've done it a few times, this is quite accurate. Especially Poseidon, which could come in at under 10 minutes.
---
I played since beta. Pisses me off occasionally but if you live Fallout you’ll love this. Definitely a better game than at release. 
---
That's awesome. That's all I'm looking for is a fun experience. I shall buy!
---
I mean I wish they had banned people yesterday. Or at least banned the people who also had stacks of Nuca Colas as well.
---
Why post on a public forum if you want people to leave you alone?
---
I'm not a fan. I like that it is unique and something to do once all quests are complete. We have *too few* challenging things to do in this game as it is. Please don't call for removing what little we have left.
---
Its fun! Buggy but fun, new content is on the horizon too so that will be a nice plus. Can easily dump many hours into it
---
Wait til it turns f2p
---
Something similar happened to me, the one with the bounty started at watoga then they moved to whitesprings punk with a switch blade started attacking me from the back then when i turned to return fire he started jumping around. Almost killed him then he ran thats when i got snipped by his buddy bitch. They got a few caps off of me from that one. Then afterwards i saw them again PvP'ing lower lvls since both got a bounty at that point i sniped both. 
---
Spend somewhere else - like there are tons of damage perks cards. It takes around 19 point to cap out damage. Those 2nd and 3rd perk damage is still more damage than spending those points on something increases your carry weight or durability.
---
It’s a solid game on its own at this point, great game if you play with friends (which you will *inevitably* make here)
---
Ok but what about build limits. Im all set until that improves.
---
I got in a quad level 80 scorchbeast fight along with about a dozen friendly robots in Watoga and two other players and nothing lagged or broke, all loot loaded. It was a long fight too, because apparently all of us were using up our .38 ammo or something (I was using a .38 combat rifle).
---
God of war is a completely different game. It had no public beta release and is not a MMO. The releases of these games are entirely different and how the games are played and are updated as per industry are different. 
---
No that wasn't me. I play 76 on Xbox. I love how many decent people there on this game tho. I am on PS4 under my same reddit name. I have like 5 friends on there so feel free to add me and we can play something else! : )
---
Sorry but no. First, don’t create false equivalence with an analogy like that. This is a game, it is *not* dating. Second, your whole point boils down to blaming people’s expectations. And you don’t specify what expectations you’re calling out, then go on to say you’re happy. I can only assume you therefore mean anybody not “happy” like you are with the game.
---
People entitled to their opinions of the game, just like you are. So your demand that people stop just because they disagree with you isn’t valid. They have reasonable expectations. You have done nothing to prove otherwise.
---
Okay, now this is EPIC
---
Oops, please don't kill me!
---
Do you have router? Make reset to it. I had same problem, restarting router helped me. 
---
It's a mod for normal sledgehammer.... All rise is a sledgehammer. Heavy rocket mod makes a sledgehammer look just like t.
---
Well you could save a trip by just going R&amp;G station to Lewisburg. Since the rest of the locations you mentioned all share the Responders pool. Or if you just want to visit those two vendors just go flatwoods and then Sutton. 
---
Also some vendors have Cap Stashes on the way to them. Typically with 16 - 60 caps in each one. 
---
Cards you need to come up with a good vendor run: 
---
Travel Agent, Cap Detector, Hard bargain level 3. 
---
Also keep in mind it's free to fast travel to the vault. 
---
 I can generate around 1600 - 2000 a day via my route, with my most expensive TP being around 22 caps. 
---
Its okay up to a certain point. Its really fun at the start, especially if you have friends. But at the end game it just gets boring, no cool quests, having to constantly repair equipment, and the numerous server dc's and bugs. 
---
PS4 :(
---
Thanks though!
---
There are 3 just obliterating my camp. I respawn, unload tonnes of ammo, doing barely any damage, then die. I'm using my most powerful weapons and barely scratching them. I'm crying

Nope, its a mod for the Super Sledge

I have a wired connection. Apparently Bethesda Launcher doesn't like Origin running alongside it sometimes. Guess Todd doesn't want to me to play too much Apex Legends.

Try having either all the mats one you or I your stash box.  For some reason if their split between the two, it won't work sometimes.
---
I (this is going to sound crazy) use both on some builds and swap as needed. Takes a bit to get a 1, 2 and 3 of the same perk. PER is the worst though, much easier with STR and AGI though I am progressing towards being able to swap between rifle, commando and glow site in different combos on that character.
---
This seems to be the culpret.
---
Radworms bugs (sounds redundant) can slso screw up mutations.   
---
I have had this problem too. Sometimes I have to exit out of the crafting and back in, and sometimes I have to put the resources in my stash box before I can repair the item. 
---
First, get the Green Thumb perk. Then you get 1 stable flux per 5 plants. 
---
At whitespring you’ll find about 10 plants/trees all near the highway. Start at the train station and go straight west. There will be some gloam sap and neutron pods. Turn right (north) and head toward the corner of the wall. Just nw of the corner will be two more neutron pods. Go a little further north and you should be able to find more and some gloam sap, but you’ll probably be attacked by the super mutants. 
---
Next go south to the garage entrance to the bunker. In the woods between the building and the highway from there down to the main bunker entrance you should be able to find at least 5 more gloam sap/ neutron pods. 
---
Down at fissure prime, search in the field at the south end of the map to the east and west of the sundew grove (and in it). You’re looking for “blast berries “. I picked up 40 last night (20 plants) as well as 60 violet (from “flash fern”). In the sundew grove there is a glowing fungus that gives fluorescent. Lastly, there are at least 5 irradiroot to get yellowcake (but whitespring is loaded with fluorescent and yellowcake)
---
It is true that Bethesda games tend to have a lot of bugs, large and small. However, having played this series since the first, and Bethesda games since the 90’s, I can tell you that they have never released a game quite as buggy and ill supported as this one. There is no getting around how “B-team” this feels, whether or not they actually gave it to the B team.
---
They’re working on it and that’s good. But I think Bethesda needs to understand they are gonna lose a lot of good faith with people and support if they don’t accept their losses and throw some more resources at fixing this. This is their Mass Effect Andromeda, which make no mistake, cost them numbers even now with Anthem, which could have a bigger interest base, *if* ME:A wasn’t such a mess.
---
In short I agree. Lol.
---
No it's not..... I have put the mod on sledgehammer.
---
Happens to me as well.  I usually use stimpaks or nuka colas until i get somewhere safe and log out and back in.  Most of the time the issue fixes itself.
---
I know, how dare people enjoy something that you don't enjoy. The nerve!
---
Get it, play it and see for yourself. I think it's great.
---
I got it at launch, and I still don't regret the purchase. That said, I don't think it's worth full price. I recommend getting it on sale.
---
If you haven't played it yet, and paid any attention to the internet's incoherent rage rant about it and you still want to play it...
---
Your expectations have been set so low that there is no way you won't enjoy the game.
---
Heavy rocket mod Is what it's called. 
---
I'd rather they banned the people who were found with multiple copies of duplicated items, or at least banned the ones with duplicated items and thousands of nuka colas. But it was better than before at least. 
---
Yes it is... get the All Rise and bring it to a weapons workbench, you can take off the Heavy mod and it will look like a Super Sledge, it'll also make the Super Sledge idle and swing sounds
---

---
I get where you're coming from, but I'm not sure your approach will help with the attitudes.  You'll not get far if you dismiss those with whom you disagree in the same offhanded (or aggressive) way that they often behave.  I think it is important that we take the positive and negative feedback and discuss them constructively and not get personal.
---
You actually make some good points in your post, but they get lost in the color with which you wrote it.
---
They must be playing Apex Legends. I hear it's the shizz, or it's just shizz. Can't remember which..
---
Because you have to walk to each vendor at least once and a couple of them are challenging to reach at low levels. Remember the first time you travelled to Watoga or Harper’s Ferry?
---
The bounty and PvP caps rewards system is F’d. The bounty should be a bonus on top of normal PvP rewards. It’s idiotic to let aggressors have such an advantage. Yet another silly oversight with their PvP “system.”
---
Yes its how i ensure im on a fresh(to me) server
---
Yep. It would give back purpose to care about your CAMP. At the beginning it was f#cking cool to have CAMP, because it provided you food and water. Everytime you saw some one near the CAMP, you thought that they are there to steal and you rushed back to CAMP to defend it. Few hours later you found out that food and water aint that sacred and the value of CAMP felt drastically. 
---
Not just, but the types of mods have tradeoffs. Those that improve bashing, say, tend to have higher durability. I tend to use that on some weapons even though I never bash.
---
Same happened to me.  Playing along for about 45 minutes in the middle of clearing an area and “server not responding controls disabled”...... “disconnected from server”.
---
I turned my Xbox off went about my day, annoyed and disheartened.
---
I just want to play without the disconnects.
---
I've got around 500 hours in the game and could definitely not be considered a casual player.  However, "casual" over there is more a state of mind than a style of gameplay. Think Dude Lebowski when you think casual.  We abide.

So underrated

Now that’s a legit alternative

Ok then, that was always allowed

I mean it's more stable than New Vegas is on new OSs' been playing ttw and it's crashes at least once an hour

NUKA COLA GROUND ZERO
---
MAKE IT HAPPEN
---
&gt;I'm sure you can deal with content just fine, but someone focused on a build will always do better than you.
---
I would disagree. The first point for 10% is great, but the remaining 2 for 10% damage? What about crit snipers who kill everything without needing those extra percent? Those 6 points are better spent on QoL, mitigation, etc.
---
All I know is the orders and letters from Tagerdy can't be dropped or sold. So maybe super important stuff for later? 
---
The game should prevent you from picking up keys and notes you already have.
---
&lt;3
---
Would infinity hours for infinity dollars make it the best deal, the worst deal, or both?
---
Play the game if you want. It's a shit game parading as a Fallout game. I keep going back and trying to play it. I've yet to play longer than 30 minutes.
---
I thought it was weird that they made the M79 a heavy classification, when it is basically the same size as a short hunting rifle
---
They can't even put the bolt handle on the correct side of the bolt action firearms.
---
If it was me: so we can learn and fix the loop holes. If you let the dupers go and they think they are free to dupe.... you can see how they are doing it and patch it.
---
At least, that is how the police shows on TV do stuff. They let the bad guys be bad to catch more bad guys!
---
No just 100 fuel
---
Agreed but even if they did fix that part we'd still have all the extras.  And since it seems they already have the technology it, I would think, could be something done now.
---
I am a crit sniper, i'm just not sneaking. That extra damage is needed especially in nuked zones.
---
I Agree, since most cards are 10%, 15%, 20%, they are a good investment at level 1, but using one of my precious points for a 5% bump on anything isn't going to happen.
---
The issue is the “kiss asses” seek to shut down conversations. I have personally seen people attempt this. They aren’t for discussion, they just want people to stop any kind of feedback whatsoever beyond fawning approval. You even get some who use personal attacks and insults to anyone who doesn’t toe to their invisible line of what’s acceptable feedback, and it only harms the game because they stop reasonable feedback that otherwise could help.
---
Screaming negative things doesn’t help either but that’s a given.
---
People need to moderate their language and pay attention to intent: it is never ok to try to shut people up.
---
I get the sense that many people have not played a true MMORPG when they started this  game. You have a game series that has a history of being customized, modded, exploited, and coded for. That's not this game, but it's still largely that base. I definitely think people's expectations were mismatched. 
---
Is this game perfect? Hell no. But I've played MMORPG shut down in beta and games that were released with a very messy beta that still are going today. I've played grind games, quest based games, party based games, and games that have had all three over the span of 15 years of being online. I think people need to know what they like and what they don't like, and then realize that not all games are for them. Is that a bad thing? No. I like grind based online games, but I hear people on here who don't like that and are dissatisfied. 
---
Yes, the mods use scripts to do it but that's because that's what modders have access to to fix it. Bethesda is able to make more powerful changes and fixes at the engine level, but hasn't.
---
Most of my playtime my character ran in a bathrobe. Most of my free time I run in bathrobe too. I am a living tribute to the Dude. I'm in.
---
Didn't know that, will do that if I ever start a new character. Cheers
---
No, it is def doable in 10-15. Especially if you don’t fully repair everything (the optional parts) and are just running it to get generator plans. I think last time I did it solo was 13 mins. The real trick was not getting an infinite load screen on the door when you go inside. :/
---
Ignoring the last bit there that doesn't make any sense at all, yeah duped items did a lot of lasting damage. People who traded for one think they legitimately "earned" it lmao you'd have to "earn" that same value 90 times over to have actually been able to afford that gun had there been no dupes in the first place. That said, the fact that dupes were so incredibly widespread this was really the only way they could have approached the problem to mitigate the damage. Hopefully all the duping exploits are gone. Personally I'd like to see new content adding a higher tier of gear so that we can put these dupes behind us and move on.
---
Taint concern. Concern dupes might get taken away in a future purge.
---
I personally doubt it, but I’ve now seen it raised twice post-patch. 
---
I'm bothered that his breakdown of player base adds up to 105%.  
---
I ran into this once and had to unbulk something. I've also had it where I had to actually take the materials out of my stash and have them in my inventory. Just a couple of ideas you might try. 
---
Played for 45.minutes last night to test. Camp took 5 minutes to load. 10 minutes in my mutations stopped working. Tried to log to correct, couldn't get back in. 
---
Fixed duping maybe...but none of the other game breaking bugs.
---
You're welcome.
---
I was wondering if after all those salty remarks about upcoming order66, those cynical people will have balls to admit they were not exactly right this time. I am very happy that at least some of them do. I wish you interesting encounters and satisfying loot. Have a nice day!
---
Well said.  I would say both sides are guilty of the forced opinions, but, as you say, the issue is that when one forces an opinion, the good points that it may contain are lost in the noise of the attack.
---
I see what you did there :P
---
Being a 200+ I had way more than enough points to respec and have a proper skill set only for PvP, using some of the skills you just mentionned (to an extent, since, for example, i don't have much points in STR so I can't take all the skills I would want to prevent close combat damages)
---
Looks like all experimented Vault Dwellers eager to PvP makes the same choices, so ultimately it comes down to the amount of aid you have available \^\^
---
Yes! 
---
It's even better if you didn't actually mean to do it but cause a chain-reaction that kills all the mobs in the area.
---
Sam's Slashey Stick
---
A suggestion: 
---
How about allowing us to carry a tent with us and put down a tent, a sleeping bag and place one crafting bench and a tiny cooker. This would be apart from our CAMP for when we go on long treks and can't get home, for whatever reason and maybe need a sleep and to scrap or craft some stuff to lighten the load.  It would be good if we could just put up a tent, or even skip the tent and just put down a sleeping bag, the little cooker and one bench only which we would carry with us. I think this would break up the boredom of running all over the place. I think it would be fun, too.   
---
Yeah, no one picks up thousands of a single item and thinks "this is legit" and thinks they can feign ignorance. 
---
It's sad that this post is getting passed by in favor of all the whooping and cheering over Bethesda running a script in Access that looked for item stacks over 5k and made them equal 1 instead
---
I've seen 3 at once on NukeSprings, near perfectly lined up, and launched about 5 minutes apart, had to keep taking cover in the Resort or Bunker, you will die anywhere else.

Fallout 3 is calling.
---
The issue is the “negative nancies” seek to shut down conversations. I have personally seen people attempt this. They aren’t for discussion, they just want people to stop any kind of feedback whatsoever beyond fawning disapproval. You even get some who use personal attacks and insults to anyone who doesn’t toe to their invisible line of what’s acceptable feedback, and it only harms the game because they stop reasonable feedback that otherwise could help.
---
Great point.  They took a very particular fan base and turned it on its head when they made this game.  It was bound to cause some squirming.  I think (or hope) people have started to adapt.  The ones that can't, to your point, should know what they want.  They should make those requests known, and BSD can determine if they wish to pursue the ideas.  If they don't, there are other games, and there's nothing wrong with that.  We're supposed to play these things to have fun.  We don't have to love every game.
---
Yeah been like that for at least 3 daya for me. If the location and the event have different costs its broke.
---
Last time I seen a camp that was placed at the end of domino line of cars I summoned several friends before I blew it up. Didn't really want to destroy somebodys camp, but at the same time really wanted to have a camp blown up by car domino. Domino was cool, camp did not blow up cool enough, got wanted anyway, it was a good day.
---
That's a ridiculous concern. If that were true, all dupes would have been removed yesterday. They were not. Therefore, it's completely safe to trade and have no worry of losing any items.
---
Also unstable will set it off
---
Id love it if u can see  grahm and the charleston bot on the map. Maybe not like precise location but the whereabouts. I wanna meet the fuckers already lol
---
Curious how you setup 2 factor authentication since Bethesda net accounts don't have it. Can you let us all know please.
---
/r/fo76recentlybathedcasuals ?
---
There hasn't been much in the way of worthwhile topics here of late.  Missing people sharing their new and innovative CAMP building ideas myself.  Don't care a single bit for this PvP BS, and of late it looks like the PvPers/griefers have invaded this sub.
---
The 5 percent is within the 20 percent that goes online. So it adds up to 100%.
---
Oh, I'm sorry.  I blew it up.  I test all the cars by shooting them.  If I shoot one and it explodes, I say "That one works!"
---
Your's is parked in the Watoga train station parking lot.
---
Armor.
---
They got rid of the majority of the problem.  Their intent it looks like was to remove the excess level of duped weapons and armor.  I saw numerous posts from traders (that must have duped allot of their inventory) that they lost ALL of their armor and weapon stacks they had.  Sure they left what you listed behind, but that was not the stuff that was flooding the "market".  It looks like they did exactly what they set out to do, just glad they did not remove ALL duped items from everyone.  Was not fair to remove items from users they obtained if they came from a duped source, and they must see it that way too.  Glad they do.  As far as others saying there are people still duping! I have not seen anyone claim they can still do it yet.
---
Also purified water is in a can...and nuka cola should become a nuka bottle...
---
Yeah I some how lagged grabbed 54 robco keycard.... When doing mayor for a day.
---
Cleverly put.  There are these individuals in both camps.  I just hope we can get past having camps (no pun intened... I like my C.A.M.P.).  We should be collaborating...  Not fighting over who's right and who's wrong.
---
I can’t wait until all the kiddos quit and go back their online day care fortnight. 
---
I personally love this game! I play about 15-20 hrs a week. Having a great time discovering the world, meeting other people.
---
When I changed the password it asked me to if I wanted to set 2 factor authentication, so I did.
---
Yeah but you sound like a little bitch.
---
The nerfed missile launchers are kind of silly. A weapon that should blow up a cabin or a guard-tower, does less damage to an enemy than a rifle. ??? I've tested it on a few different types of enemies and it's just tickling them.  Kind of stupid. 
---
Every time it’s happened to me, I’ve had to pick up the mats out of my stash in order to do it 
---
happens evry once in awhile it's just on that server though
---
Ppl are leaving the sub because too many shitposts and whining.  It dont bother me but thats whats happening
---
Hah
---
Now that you have it, what's the name of the jumpsuit, I'm hunting for it myself now (PS4) will also pay caps...
---
I usually use the aligned stock for my weapons except for my laser rifle. The improved durability helps offset how fast it breaks. I never bash either. At that point, it’s usually swap to melee weapon time.
---
It would depend in what build you want, when exploring I like to use the first and second fully ranked weapons damage cards and have some cool complimentary cards, like cannibal and lead belly, but if imma fight a scorch beast I equip all damage boosting cards.
---
That's the formula I've decided on. Not even gonna try to fast travel if it quotes me low caps
---
Gauley Mine 
---
I'm not sure the point of these post, I honestly believe your a shill, the game is universally hated, with good reason, Bethesda has lied, cheated and stole money , The criticism is valid.
---
It's like if someone punches you in the face, but makes you a nice dinner, you must be ignore the abuse.
---
I almost enjoy it as much as opening big loot chests in Borderlands. 
---
I want a garbage baby flair
---
Can Beth Please make it so some of us Fat Boys can Fast Travel!
---
I'll pay a few caps extra even...
---
The extra weight fluctuations (some due to software glitches-cough "bobby pins" cough) and my Hoarder Lifestyle (I LOVE GUNS and BOMBS even though they aren't good for me) its nearly impossible for me to slenderize down to the needed travel requirements.
---
Yeah I know many will just blame me and tell me I need to play smarter. Here's the thing, I've played this way since FO1. I also admit I haven't gotten every Perk yet for Extra Weight (busy maxing Explosive, Shotgun, Rifle, others). So I have just a little bit of extra lifestyle work to do. Yet why the Discrimination?
---
Beth, I beg of you, PLEASE show a Tubby T-60 Terminator Some Love Darn It!
---
I know that event is on a timer too and eventually should go away but had it on my map for about 5 hours straight.
---
I just hop to another server. Screw it
---
That's kind of dumb... those passive attacks shouldn't have an affect until you actually attack them intentionally.
---
Is that the one with the secret group at riverside mansion? 
---
My quest glitched and I can’t get past the meeting of the person at lewisburg
---
Roses are red, vault suits are blue,
---
I spawned inside a mutant stew.
---
Nothing worse then those who moan at the critics and then blindly defend the game. Conversely those who try to tear the game and BGS down constantly sound like a broken fucking record. You just can't win I'm afraid. 
---
Yes. I've tried to do it four times, twice it was bugged. One time the robot was nowhere to be found, another I could not interact with it. This is over the past month or more so it is not a new thing.
---
I'd say it's about 50%, yes.  Either I get there and the robot is nowhere to be found, or you just can't interact with it (it keeps looping dialog about "creativity subroutines," etc).
---
Good to know that someone found a telltale sign that it's broken, short of "It's been on the map this entire session and hasn't been completed." 😂
---
It's not as bad as people say, it needs some work, but its still a good game
---
The elevator locks you out if somebody else launched from that silo within the past 3 hours. Also it seems there is a per-player frequency limit on launching a nuke. Since I went for the same Alpha silo, I don't know if I can launch a nuke from Bravo right after I launched it from Alpha. Once I have enough key cards again, I'll try it out.
---
Exactly. And while it is true some negative feedback is accompanied with demands people hold the same opinion and otherwise shut up, it is rarer. It’s fine to be positive and happy with the game, but that is in the end *an opinion* and nobody is required to share it.
---
In this very topic is somebody who decided the best way to respond was a copy paste low effort troll response trying to create false equivalence. This is exactly what I’m taking about. Don’t like my opinion? State what you don’t like and don’t demand, amid insults and attacks, that I agree with you or shut up.
---
Dicks downwards Dagger
---
Yeah, where you have to wear the veil to get in. The sword you get is pretty solid for it. It's a shame you can't complete it. 
---
Buy it cheap and play with friends. It still has bugs scattered about but if you can ignore them, it's alright. Expect lots of lore and some unfriendly players/griefers with a non optional pvp system. Like I said, if you find it cheap give it a go. 
---
It's more about what ports are used and how invasive origin is 
---
Cleverly? Please do not encourage low effort copy paste trolling.
---
That works. Was playing with group though and took about 30 mins to find a non full server.
---
'Murica
---
&gt; You can burn the warehouse where they keep 10 000 guns but that doesn't really mean shit if the 100 000 guns that were put out into society already are still there.
---
Yup.  Exactly why they should make the PvP Server a fresh start with zero duping.  
---
Still triple what it is over at r/fallout. Which still makes r/fo76 the most active sub related to any Fallout by a huge margin.
---
Just a friendly reminder.
---
Peter's Pointy Pricker
---
I think what happens is that whenever there is a patch, downtime, or Inside the Vault, it brings the drama queens who don't normally frequent this sub out of the woodwork looking for free karma and attention.  You see it all the time.  The "I have no interest in this game, but I love watching the train wreck" crowd.  And they tend to make a bunch of noise for a couple days and leave.
---
I would love to see the "investment" option for each vendor.
---
Screaming at the game and BGS is fine as long as they have an actual point of feedback and keep it limited to blowing off steam. Some people get very personal/violent in their language and that isn’t ok, but for different reasons.
---
Yeah I found the body of the lady in lewisburg but it just does nothing. I’ve server hopped and all. Now I’m sad because it’s one of the few quests I thought looked decent. 
---
Sting.
---
Is this some kind of code? Lulz
---
I have avoid this sub of late it's got a little to whiney for me. However there are still good posts on here so I haven't completely given up, but it does mean I tend typo skip loads of posts to get to the good stuff. It's still a better resource for all things FO76 but I prefer the lightheartedness of Filthy Casuals. Hopefully the negativity will recede from here.. 
---
Even if it is trolling, it gives a a glimpse at the intent of the poster.  It may not have been the most useful way to go about making his or her statement, but it lets us see that people believe the same of both sides.  I hope we can find commonality as it is clear you seek to do.
---
No popup menu? Well.. I mean if you want the Blade of Bastet I have a second one I picked up from someone who dropped it lol
---
Just an FYI here, Unyielding Armor isn’t what they’re all after. Yes, it sells for a fairly high price point, but it’s Sentinel Assassin that’s got everyone drooling that I know. 
---
I have yet to do this event because this has happened every time.
---
well, some of the helmets give the extra stat preview screen (f you hover over them in inventory) just like the under-armors.. they only show 0 resist, but it looks like that CAN be upgraded (in the future?)
---
Bethesda probably added some hidden values
---
There's a difference, though, between receiving necessary feedback and being bombarded with toxicity.  One of the top posts earlier this week was nothing but a long list of snarky, sarcastic comments about what "could" happen when servers were brought back up yesterday.  And, of course, it was brimming with hyperbole. Reporting bugs/issues/workarounds is indeed necessary, whether it is through Reddit or the Bethesda bug tool.  However, a lot of what I've seen on here lately can in no way be construed as helpful.  (I've read your posts in the past, btw, and this reply is not directed at you; you always seem to make valid, well-thought out points.  Kudos for that) 
---
Yes they are able to, but it has a cost like I said. It would be even more expensive because of multiplayer. There are more important problems. 
---
Your product *did* deliver though. Just not how you thought. And sometimes that’s ok. Don’t go lynching over your disappointments.
---
Nope. 
---
I appreciate the offer but I’m alright on the sword. I wanted to complete the quest on my own. Maybe I’ll revisit it in a few patches. 
---
Still happens. Not sure how you can claim a bug was fixed just because it's not happening to you.
---
Nuka grape is the god of sodas
---
I'm doing similar, including recipes / plans (I usually pick them up when farming) to help out other players. I've deposited a lot of loot in the bag right next to the door at Whitesprings as well.  The one question I have though is when you deposit loot how long does it last before it's dumped off the server? and does it persist longer than if you just dropped a bag?  Hoping that most of the stuff that I drop at different vendors is at least benefitting someone.
---
There are pot stirrers out there for sure.  There's also some lingering communications challenges and concerns with the patching approach.  Instead of guessing and panic, It would be nice to have real facts.
---
u/lonevaultwanderer This is where BSD could help us immensely with PTS or something.
---
Oh I agree, the language being thrown around in one of the Inside The Vault news updates was just cancer. That being said BGS still do deserve a lot of criticism and feedback for everything they've done wrong. 
---
Games a broken buggy mess, have fun but i won't enjoy the game until i jave to stop working around glitches. 
---
Honest question, do they discuss game issues/things that need to be fixed? This sub has an issue with users trying to suppress that.
---
No but trading and not checking online that there is duping going on leads to being punished? 
---
Pistttt.....come here....the duped items are not gone....at least not all of them....I've seen characters with 1000's of stimpacks, nuka colas and bobble heads, as well as serums, plans, junk and recipes, it a nut shell all this "purge" did on a larger scale was get a rid of weapons they nurfed into oblivion.
---
This yes.
---
I also see the silver-lining here.
---
Alright, thx for the response.
---
Are any of these items they plan on deleteing related to the whole Dev room thing as well? Or did they take care of that already?
---
I've had my share of venting, and I've probably translated that into some of my own posts over time.  But as you say, we need to keep the attacks to a minimum.  Good point; focus on the issues.
---

---
When I have the extra ability to use more PERK cards I will swap them. For example right now I have 14 strength points, most in heavy guns but also have the 3 rank 1 2H melee cards.
---
It'll take 9 levels, but once my build is complete I will get duplicates of those cards up to 3 so that if I'm going SBQ and not planning on melee I can do max damage. If I'm out farming I can switch back. 
---

I like standing on one in my PA, drawing a ring of ghouls around the car, and then giving it a good whack with All Rise. The explosion does relatively little damage to me, tags every ghoul in a chain reaction of damage with one swing, and--as an added bonus--sometimes the blast launches me into the air... which is just fun.
---
Make another character
---
-Bethesda, probably
---
Think I can make one of those. Add me same as name on here.
---
How do u have flair
---
Peter picked a peck of pointy prickers?
---
Depends what you have, but thinks like throwing knives give xp and can be scrapped and then remade for diminishing returns. Other items like weapons or armour can be crafted for xp and sold to vendors or scrapped to try and learn mods - that's how I play. Craft rarer weapons and scrap to learn mods
---
Whichever you prefer. I like the red myself.
---
My point is that insults and attacks have no place whether or not someone has a point.
---
I always have.  I love the series. The one thing no one ever mentions is how beautiful the world is; all these other things can be fixed.  I can't wait to see what it looks like in a year or two. 
---
Honestly the people who are still vocal about this game are hopefully the reason it WONT be trash in the future or if they ever decide to make another game like this. Say what you want but even in it's current state it's a mess. 
---
Should be able to find a 1* for like 500 caps or less. 
---
Yes, and I'd love for it to be fixed because it's a challenging event without being too time consuming. I'd love to do it more

For about 2 weeks now

I love helping lower levels like this.  I know how it felt to be the guy running from the mob of bullet sponges, so now that I can do something about it, and trotting around Whitesprings anyway, I'm happy to help.
---
I don't have a sledge tho, I gravitate to my ski sword.
---
Lol you too ^^
---
Almost universal agreement by the community. I'm sure they'll fix it somewhat soon, especially around PvP server time
---
Hope you have fun but this hasn't been a fallout game that is up to par. It *will* go down as a swing and a miss. Fuck me for being disappointed, right? I commented perfectly sensible and valid complaint in that thread. Sure, just highligt one troll though.. Have a good day.
---
I sold one 1* on Xbox for 500
---
I was saying thank you to be appreciative his answer, I don’t really care if it’s barely worth the trouble. I honestly don’t even see the point of you replying 
---
I think the last update, for example, was a great example of how it should be done.  Wild Appalachia - that's something I can look forward to.  Weekly new quests.  I'm onboard, that's cool.
---
And, they also tempered the potential drama of people losing their duped weapons with the promise of a stash increase next week.  It's all give-and-take.  We've had a lot of the take, not so much the give, but it really doesn't take that much to balance things and make players feel better.
---
Each tic tac only contains 2 calories, just a friendly reminder 
---
They do exists. I want to say I found it at either watoga or white springs.
---
Just wait 10 seconds if it happens, you don't need to relog. 
---
No, I said he was being childish because he opened with an insult and continued to try to argue. Has nothing to with his/her point. If they wanted to discuss it they shouldn't have said I was a corporate boot licker in the first sentence. 
---
Heavy guns and demolition perks are what works for me. The gun isn't over the top powerful, but it works pretty good. 
---
I’ve been playing as my grandpa too!  The game is perfect for it he was a hunter and electrical engineer who made his own guns.
---
Ik but it was fun while it lasted no more Robin hood raider anymore 
---
Since please stand by
---
Not people, just you. Good day for the 4th time.
---
Those 3 points actually make a big diffrence when you considerit isn't sub traction but its actually division that determines damage. 
---
There's also diffrent part multipliers (head x2, ect.) that are diffrent for each enemy. So a protectron could have a x1.3 to body damage a assaultron could have x1.0 to body damage. Weak points on robots is weird and might also affect damage.
---
People have a tendency to over estimate Reddit and it's influence on the real world...
---
The game is fun, but there are some serious issues that needed addressing last year, and instead of addressing some of them, they are trying their hands at 'balance'. You cannot 'balance' when there is an entire class of weapons that don't work. You cannot 'balance' when there is no reasonable method to respec. In addition to that they are treating us like this rated M game is made for the Fortnight crowd by almost entirely selling cosmetics made for children. I look forward to new content, and I'm thrilled that the stash is finally going to be at a reasonable number. We'll see if they are actually going to fix the queen or not this time.
---
I believe there is a mine on the west/northwestern boarder of the cranberry bog. I think that’s what you’re referring to
---
76 sucks
---
yes
---
Yours is the only sensible comment.
---
Thanks for the Sub! It's good to have a positive look at the game after so many bad things
---
This is why I love the FO76 community. I've had similar experiences (Lvl 14 here). High levels are either racking up a bounty, in which case they usually stay away from the little guys; or they are running around playing "Heroes of the Wasteland" for all the little dudes out there. One guy popped into my camp the other day, teamed up with me, built me a power armor station, dropped me 50 Stimpaks, and left.  
---
What a gentleman.
---
i dont understand how most of the simple ideas with a dev team are not easy to implement when mods (free lancers) and previous FO games have included many of them?
---
I think if they abandon a game (to me the patch rate is too low) when it already funded millions and had potential for more is a tragedy (well to gamers)
---
2+TB machines are expensive. i have a 2tb machine with provisioned iops in aws and it runs me 400/month
---
I think they are using container services and are just uploading a docker image, server less is all the rage these days with devs that love docker and you can leave out your typical systems administrator. you can slap them behind load balancers too
---
Burying their heads in the sand mate but then again they are 'casuals' and they think the game is fine lol it can't be helped, i've been exactly where they are. I've been on here saying i 'enjoy the game' but it wears you down amd eventually they'll come around. 
---
Purged weapons that were already made worthless, GG. While also still leaving at least 1 in each person inventory. No downvotes here cause I already said this is another lazy joke on their part.
---
Some players, either just don't understand the mechanics, or don't give a shit about anyone else, and it's usually quick to see which.
---
When I show up for an event and find another player there, I send them a team invite, talk to them if I can, and try to play cooperatively, it's successful about 30% of the time, and have met several new game friends from this.
---
if I encounter a low level player, that doesn't respond, I will try to shadow them and kill everything after they tag it.
---
When I encounter high level players that want to run in and OHK everything before anyone else gets a shot (also around 30%), then I try to return the love, Nuka Grenades, and my Auto Launcher are good for that.
---
I had another player, close to my level (125+), show up at UF right behind me a few days ago, saw them approaching and waited to start the process, then sent them an invite, but only got a thumbs down emote in return, next act was expected, he OHK'd the first Mole miner to show up with his All Rise, so I switched to my TSE Handmade, and went in to Stealth mode, while he bounced around like a meth freak killing everything as quick as he could, I just waited for the supervisors, and OHK'd each one of them. I've done UF over 100 times so I know when &amp; where they're coming from, and it was really funny to watch them searching meat piles afterwards and flashing the "???" emote, I gave them a thumbs down emote and left.
---
Thanks for your very informative answer!  I'm level 71, so maybe I'm ready to nuke fissure prime.
---
I have green thumb, I've been using it at WS for that purpose, and at my camp for making veggie starch.
---
have the story evolve and reset 
---
I chucked mine
---
I think the incentive for finding those merchants and exploring the map would be the plans and mods they stock. I don't think the cap pool should be the factor. I spent hours sneaking my way to watoga and hf for the chance at the handmade plans. I still don't have access to the enclave bunker so that's 200 caps/day that I'm locked out of. 
---
I'm constantly over encumbered and being able to do all my selling at 1 merchant would make my life so much better. I would actually be able to do more exploring than spending all my time trying going from vendor to vendor to get my stash down. Then I might be able to finally finish the BoS and Enclave quests. 
---
It's like groups of people can hold two separate views within those groups.
---
Also, this place was considered a circlejerk FOR the game until the bullshit about the game finally broke the players.
---
Dude, you whiners lost already. Get over it. If you don’t mind, i’m gonna enjoy my popcorn and run around with my collection of TSEs.
---
 I'm 117 and haven't started yet the last quest
---
pass the soot flower bro, I need to vibe for a bit
---
I traded for one and accidentally use it on the wrong character :(
---
As a Low level i hardly got to sale my stuff to 1 vendor a day.. I had other things to explore. 
---
Now my daily routine is selling stuff and travelling to all vendors. Than hunt for legendary or do 1-2 SBQ Runs if possible. Clean out harpers ferry. Look for plans there and wait until the next day to sell the stuff again. Well that was mostly my routine. Now with Civ6 Gathering Storm this also stopped. Dunno if I come back to play Fo76. But they plan to increase the stash limit. So at least a little incentive to look back someday.
---
Are they both games? Yes. So they can be compared quility wise. 
---
Vibrating bunny
---
Preach! 
---
Hey!
---
We prefer the term "junk babies" around these parts.
---
I guess I can try to grab those perks later and see what happens.  Right now it is at about 26 damage.
---
Did the sleep with you?
---
Yeah, I am seeing the opposite.   Any traders that run discords (that obviously dupe) have said all popular weapons and armor they had was wiped away (all but a small # from each stack).  It sounds like they did not touch allot of other stuff that was duped, but those are not the key items that were flooding the FO76 market before.   I am sure it is possible that they missed some, but it sounds to me from what I have read over the last day they got a majority of the people.
---
Thank you, stranger.
---
\*Runs to sub\*
---
What % of accounts have been played in the last 30 days?  1% is a meaningless metric if it includes inactive accounts.
---
It would not be shocking to find out only 10% accounts are active to begin with.
---
Yeah this happens very frequently, and the corpses go back to their spawn points.  Unfortunately they become unlootable.  I've started just spamming the pickup button as soon as I kill something. 
---
In every game I've ever played, you saw the weirdest posts during downtime. lol
---
Yeah, they only removed certain weapons and armor. I suppose its something, but not really a purge.
---
Yes. This. Or give us a perk card for it or something. I finally broke down and walked to Watoga from Whitespring and back last night because I'm tired of not being able to get my daily caps in and it sucked. Doubt I'll do it again. Yes, I know it was my fault, but it was not fun gameplay. I can't bring myself to just drop legendaries, especially when I play late at night and there's no one else around to pick them up. I don't like making sacrifices to RNG gods. 
---
This is why i know you guys will eventually come around. You go ahead and tell yourself the only problem that we have is a bag. Tell yourself that right up until you've had enough of the bugs, disconnections, unbalanced weapons and lack of anything to do outside of the main quest. Have fun with this shell of a game, i hoped for so much more personally. 
---
I think this is true to a point - that point being when you really know what your character is going to be.  Some of that is shaped by your own goals, but you have an X factor with the god-tier legendaries.
---
I wouldn't recommend anyone taking the three perks of any cards like this until Lv. 50, unless they have a plan and are absolutely sticking to it.  My biggest regret, really, is ranking up things like Rifleman and Slugger too early, because now I can't fit them in as part of the "one-of-each" strategy, and they cost too many points to be worthwhile.
---
Yes, there are the min-maxers who insist on having the mathematical best.  But for most of us, you aren't going to notice a giant difference between 5% and 10%.  It's one more stab, or one more bullet, in a game that isn't terribly difficult to begin with.  Heck, you get enough of that variability with latency alone.
---
What about the people that want to have fun but can't because the game is broken amd lacks anything to do when the main quest is finished? 
---
You make a lot of assumptions, and I don't demand anything. Just sick of seeing people bitch all the time. Ok, you don't like it for what ever reason that has been expressed to this community countless times by now. Got it, don't play it than. 
---
My comparison to a relationship was the expectations from one thing to the next. This is their first attempt at an mmo. They made mistakes, and will improve. Don't expect blizzard quality mmo from these people, they don't have the experience from past games. 
---
Admiral Akhbar would be proud.
---
Because I can. 
---
And to point out that it's pretty much a waste of time to base your income on blackberries. 
---
I'm glad you are polite and I would have said the same thing, but you are not an island. There are other people reading this that may be new or otherwise not know good advice from bad. 
---
I was farming Whitesprings for about 8 levels overnight and this morning and ive been soo happy with how smooth its been. Inventoriee loading faster, game loading faster, and no more freezing on bringing uo the pip boy
---
If it's lvl24 and lvl28, I can understand that. But 24 and 50!
---
The 1500 weight limit gives a hard cap on what kind of stuff you keep on mules. I think yesterdays purge was a nice balance of getting rid of MOST of the duped weapons. And also rendering ebay sellers without a stock.
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals is up 1.5K. I imagine a fair number of people are unsubbing here and subbing there due to toxicity on this thread. Just a theory though, i have no evidence to support that aside from the few posts i see. 
---
Yup. You don't have to go to the edge of Whitesprings for the explosive bait mission either. Any pack of mongrels will work. Same with the bear. 
---
Stay classy, BGS Austin
---
Yes, it also happened to me after a long battle with a 3\* legendary and a regular legendary. I think they fell through the floor.
---
I once made the mistake of throwing a grenade at the protectrons at Sugar Grove.

Once.

my 13 yo daughter plays it and really likes it. She also loves fortnight and didnt enjoy RDR so take that how you will. I havent played it myself. 
---
The Watoga and Harpers Ferry vendor have 200 caps after I spend 2000 caps with them. I typically sell to them, then buy from them, then sell again...
---
Similar story here! I’m pretty low level and sometimes, I’ll hop on to play by myself. I’ll farm a bit, collect some supplies, and try killing enemies I have no business taking on. With that last bit enters some random ass kid who I can now only describe as my guardian angel. I was at an airport, under leveled and doing an event struggling by myself. I had resigned myself to death but death never came. Instead, some ungodly high level dude with a tse shotgun clad in power armor comes through like Terry Crews in that one movie and carries me the rest of the event. 
---
“Who is this masked savior?” I asked myself. As if on cue the identifiable voice of a twelve your old boy who just hit puberty comes through my speakers. You know the one if you’ve ever played COD online. Too loud, cracked, usually indicative that you’re about to be called a racial slur. 
---
I braced myself for verbal abuse, but it never came. This kids first words to me are “here you go” as he drops a power armor frame, stimpacks, and radaway. After saving my ass and resupplying me, he went on his merry way. 
---
I thought that was the last I’d see of him but I’ve seen him three more times and he’s always done nice stuff for me when I run into him including saving me from dehydration, giving me plans, and engaging high level super mutants (high level to me at least)  while I sprinted away like a coward. A real swell kid that’s vastly improved my gameplay experience. I had pretty low expectations given the constant complaints of Griefers and base wreckers and all that, but this kid definitely made the game more enjoyable.
---
Idk you kid but if you’re on reddit, thank your mom for pushing out a kid strong enough to be able to carry a full grown 23 year old man on his shoulders. 
---
Blaming the players for buying a bugged to fuck game, nice. And it's supposed to be people that are disappointed that are toxic?

It's pretty good. If you enjoy Titanfall, you'll enjoy AL.

nice analysis actually, that episode really has stood the test of time, a dash of picard makes every meal better
---
I'd like to see this but with a bit of a soft limit to limit exploiting. Ie, the first 200caps you buy gives you 200caps available at the vendor again. The next 200 gives you back 190, then 180, etc etc etc.
---
While you can take perks like Dromedary and Slow Metabolizer to deal with thirst and hunger, the rest is really just how the game is.  As you move toward the east, enemy levels rise in accordance with the levels of recent players.  There *will* be times when you are outmatched and have to make a fight-or-flight decision.
---
The story is what the story is.  If listening to holotapes and reading texts isn't your thing, then you're not going to appreciate the story beyond the environmental aspect of it.
---
Would love this, mostly as I would love to have a homestead and would try to fill it with deathclaws some how. 
---
Havent done the final SBQ quest just because if I actually manage to pull off launching (usually play solo) I know its rare that people actually show up to kill the Queen anymore, so dont want to waste the launch...
---
I only played one game more than this ..and that's because it came out a long time ago
---
I can't think the nightmares of a whitespring/queen nuke on pvp server.

I drop my excess at white springs (the bag next to the doot), the overseers camp, and Charleston. And then IMMEDIATELY go get more and do it again.

I cant stop.

Cough  cough

Railway rifles to please. They have no cards that effect them at all
---
It’s not triple the amount of subs. 
---
Double MABYE triple amount of active users, but this game is still fresh [i guess?] and is online. 
---
The Destiny sub had tons of subscribers and active users for the first year [when the game was garbage, but still not as bad as 76], that doesn’t mean the game is nearly good 
---
So people like me complain when they pay for a clearly unifinished and buggy product, and are disappointed with it. And that makes me a whiny 12 year old? You people really are so blinkered it's unreal..
---
?? This is so yesterdays news...
---
Upvotes? You're on -9 lol..
---
You might try it solo. I've heard that she is stupid easy to solo because her HP scales with the number of participants. YMMV
---
The duped items aren't gone - this is just the perception Bethesda was hoping for ... they only removed stacks of dupes on a single account.  Everyone who bought a duped item still has it ... the damage can never be undone.
---
Don't forget paid Bethesda shills, like me! \*rolls around in Atoms like Scrooge McDuck\*
---
Oh but you absolutely can. It is absolutely not a number of total players, but it helps determine how good/bad a game is or how strong a community is. Look at the Destiny sub, they have huge numbers. Apex Legends sub has climbed to ~250k in 1 week. 
---
And missed terribly?
---
Try to keep no more than 100-150 of junk you don't use often(something like ceramic), keep a decent amount of junk that you use often(springs, screws, gears). If you're not going to be playing much for a few days, vendoring is quick and will clear you stash space. If you are going to be playing, then maybe craft and scrap some weapons to learn the mods. There are posts that list what mods are learnable by scraping for weapons/armor.
---
4 reel
---
Wow. Those rules..
---
No criticism of any kind.. Okay guys, you do you. 
---
What system are you on? 
---
This happened to me last night. It’s because half of the mats you need are in your stash and half on your character. I put  all my  junk in my stash and it fixed it
---
from what I have read you only get the angry holotape if you nuke an area that is not fissure prime. she is good with nuking the SBQ but not whitesprings.
---
I've only gotten to loot 2 out of the last 12 that I've killed. It's gotten very old, very fast. Disappearing bodies, quest completion lag, loading loot. 
---
I remember how big of a deal it was when blizzard sold old server 'blades'.  One entire server and all your characters on one static data center server...
---
This
---
Because people are negative on here we are just filthy casuals wanting positivity and fun. 
---
I was one of the defenders, i "enjoyed the game" at first. It very much wore me down, i don't have much free time and dealing with the uncountable bugs was just too much in the end. 
---
I might give the game a go again. I couldn’t stand the servers drops. It was becoming unbearable 
---
If I were blessed I wouldn't have bought the game for full price.
---
I want to say I bought one from Wallace, in Harper's Ferry. It was a while back.
---
I had a situation like this the other day....so I spawn in to Watoga and head for the train station...when entering there's robots , scorn and mirelurks all going crazy inside fighting , shooting  it was chaos....so I kill everything and head over to the vendor , handle my transaction and the bathroom door in the back opens up and out comes a level 8 AND a level 10
---
So here's an idea to reduce camp griefing (and maybe all griefing) and restore the bounty system to what it was supposed to be.  
---
1. When a player becomes wanted, they are ejected from their team and cannot join any teams.  This way, their teammates are not automatically hostile to any victims of the griefer, or to any bounty hunters. 
---
2. The bounty earned by destroying things is paid not only to the person collecting the bounty, but also a like amount is paid to the owner of the damaged camp.  This means that while the player's friend may collect their 100 cap bounty, another 100 caps will be sent out to the victims (at a total cost of 200 to the wanted person).  This is a financial disincentive similar to what Bethesda originally planned.
---
3. If someone can't pay their bounty on their death, they acquire a negative balance and are forced into a special shunned mode where they cannot cause any damage to player camps or cause any slap damage (or incidental explosive damage) to other players.  They also cannot be hurt.  They are basically "Dead Man Walking" and have a special symbol showing their debt (similar to the bounty symbol).  Every cap they earn, pick up or trade for is automatically deducted from their balance and paid out to the rightful parties until the balance gets up to zero.
---
4. While the player has a negative balance, he cannot join any teams and if he was part of one, he is ejected from it immediately.
---
5. To balance the equation out, the person with the negative balance can be killed, but they can't lose more caps due to PVP because they can't engage in PVP.
---
6. If a player can't pay up in PVP, they go into the same special shunned mode.  This stops them from being reverse griefed.
---
7. The bankruptcy does not time out.  Server hopping, logging out for extended periods of time, etc will not restore their balance or remove the shunned status.
---
I am, too.  Spending most of my time over on /r/fo76FilthyCasuals for the same reason.
---
I just prefer to hang with people with the same view of the game as me.  Drop in here for some tips.  
---
Shhhhhh. People get hissy if you mention a problem with the price
---
Level 5 Deathclaw stuck on its own island all by its lonesome. Nothing but pigeon shit and skeletons to pass the time.

I hook ya up with one free just won’t be on until later tonight 
---
Would you like a TSE? I have a few I don't use, and I even remember which I farmed myself, which were definitely duped by a buddy, and which are of uncertain provenance. Your choice if you try to have fun with it and enjoy the game.
---
Tenderizer in Charisma is a nice add on :)
---
For me it was all of the "Dupe fix is going to kill the game, my mom, my pet". Doom prediction threads and the circle jerk around them are pretty pathetic. I just use  r/fo76FilthyCasuals  for my 76 fix now.
---
i don't think **deep pocketed** exists for the chest / torso, only pocketed
---
deep pocketed gives you 10 extra on all limbs and pocketed gives 5 on the torso...
---
never seen deep pocketed for the chest / torso :/
---
I'm not sure if it's just me, but my normal Carry Weight (275) without Power Armor is higher than when I'm actually in Power Armor (250). Shouldn't Power Armor be increasing it instead of decreasing it? Or am I the only one having this problem? 
---
There is a flooded mine in that area.
---
Do you need a new safe space?
---
Same!
---
I like to cripple them with shotty plus Enforcer. Then I run out to wave everyone in. They just lay there looking sad. It's like shooting ghouls in a barrel. 
---
This would be nice.
---
This is one of my favourite SMH things about the modern gaming world.

People who exploit complain so hard when the exploit is gone.  Like people who unofficially mod their games complain when they crash.

Dude.  TF?

I found it on a dead body advertising for a museum and the same I learned it and now I can't find it in crafting

Friendly reminder that a tic tac is about 100% sugar, but because there's less than 0.5g of sugar per tic tac, they're legally allowed to say that there's no sugar in them.
---
You are no longer allowed to complain and have people take you seriously when you have put in 750 hours. 
---
Delete it.  Reclaim your love. 
---
Maybe you should have published your weird rules you expect everyone to follow before you get mad people don't follow them.  
---
Unless we're talking damage determined by modular arithmetic, I don't understand how division decreases the small difference between 80 and 83 into a bigger number. :) (Division by numbers with magnitude less than 1? I need more explanation.)
---
You can buy the serum at the Enclave bunker for a few thousand caps. Pricy, but I have one in reserve just in case.
---
You paid 50 bucks too much for this. 
---
(did it cost 35 bucks? still true)
---
But where is the insult in the "troll" post? I don't even find it a troll. I personally find it a creative method of making his own point, which in this case is to illustrate that the opposite polarization is guilty of the same thing as your original comment. It's a legitimate debate tactic, to frame your view in the argument of another to show that the same argument applies to both sides.
---
If, by insult, you refer to the "negative nancy" reference, I personally associated the use of that term with colloquial rather than hostile intent.
---
The 1500 weight limit means nothing....all it did was prevent that toon from taking on anymore caps or weight.  It's like me hauling a 10k tank of water behind my truck.  I still have the 10k of water, i just can't take on any more water, but i can pull over and sell you water as long as i don't try to stuff the money in the tank.  
---
 You don't see many grind based games that are successful in Western countries. It's not the play style that is popular outside of Asian countries as a whole. I'm generalizing because I do like it, but I know that many of my peers hate it. 
---
Some will say All Rise, which you get from Mayor for a Day in Watoga, but don't bother with that until you're Lv. 50.  You want the Lv. 50 version of that weapon.
---
Really, it kind of depends on what you're going for.  When I was Lv. 30, I was still in my two-handed phase, so I was alternating between Sledgehammers and Fire Axes based on whatever was nearest my level, with a Baseball Bat as a backup.  The Fire Axe really shouldn't be underestimated, despite how common it is.
---
More recently, I've found that the Mole Miner Gauntlet is surprisingly badass.
---
*OH* ...
---
I love it when you are in the shit and others come in to help or lessen the load of fighting off enemies.  Now that I’m a lvl 105 I don’t need much help but it’s one of the best aspects of the game.  I routinely help out other players just like this because at one point we were that player.  
---
Is it even conceivable to you that other people don't feel the same way?
---
I did Mama Dolces for Cobalt. I got about 80 I think. It was pretty good. Maybe adjusting the radius a little around that area would turn up better results.
---
Base/Master/Expert at rank 1 + Bloody Mess rank 3 will get you to about +50% damage for six perk points. It's way more economical that way especially if you want to have more than one weapon active. I do rifles and shotguns, for example.
---
Add one rank of Adrenaline for even more damage.
---
At least it took almost 2 hours for the Incel response. Maybe this sub is losing a bit of toxicity
---
Ive noticed this sub gets unusually polarized. Waves of intense highs and lows that are sure to bother everyone at some point. Having said that, its actually been pretty steady around 170k
---
No, I've got a few myself, why would i want another?  The only TSE explosive weapons really worth anything are "bloodied".
---
Yes when ever they decide to add more shit lol
---
I believe that’s the cave he’s talking about.
---
Yes please that shit is annoying
---
No I have a book that is well over 100 years and it's still intact.
---
Although now that I think about it, you're not wrong. 4 calories per gram of carbs. 0.5g of sugar is about 2 calories. Honestly I was both shocked and not surprised at the same time when I learned that they were all sugar but said no sugar.
---
Yes when ever they decide to add more content 
---
BOS and Deep Pocketed plans for the Combat Armor are MIA (at vendors at least) since the vendor plan change.
---
I have not personally found one in the wild (though, lots of others) either.
---
Will see if they say anything in the next patch about it.
---
Can I have one lol 
---
No apostrophe btw, it’s actually Harpers Ferry
---
That’s not possible. You’re guaranteed a generator drop from that quest and if you did it three times you would get all the generators. It gives you the large generator, windmill generator, and finally the fusion generator. This is one of the few things in fallout 76 that works exactly as intended.
---
Here is a comment I made in another thread.  Some of my ideas match yours, but I added a bit to cut out some of the gaming of the system (like wanted people running around with stealthed snipers waiting to attack the bounty hunters).
---
So here's an idea to reduce camp griefing (and maybe all griefing) and restore the bounty system to what it was supposed to be.
---
1. When a player becomes wanted, they are ejected from their team and cannot join any teams. This way, their teammates are not automatically hostile to any victims of the griefer, or to any bounty hunters.
---
2. The bounty earned by destroying things is paid not only to the person collecting the bounty, but also a like amount is paid to the owner of the damaged camp. This means that while the player's friend may collect their 100 cap bounty, another 100 caps will be sent out to the victims (at a total cost of 200 to the wanted person). This is a financial disincentive similar to what Bethesda originally planned.
---
3. If someone can't pay their bounty on their death, they acquire a negative balance and are forced into a special shunned mode where they cannot cause any damage to player camps or cause any slap damage (or incidental explosive damage) to other players. They also cannot be hurt by other players. They are basically "Dead Man Walking" and have a special symbol showing their debt (similar to the bounty symbol). Every cap they earn, pick up or trade for is automatically deducted from their balance and paid out to the rightful parties until the balance gets up to zero.
---
5. If a player can't pay up in PVP, they go into the same special shunned mode. This stops them from being reverse griefed.
---
6. The bankruptcy does not time out. Server hopping, logging out for extended periods of time, etc will not restore their balance or remove the shunned status.
---
So if duping methods have gone but not the items we now have a portion of the playerbase with gear that new players will be mostly unable to acquire. If duping is still possible everyone still has a template item to copy. 
---
About? If you are trying to say something specific you forgot to be specific. If you are a 'negative nancy' or a 'kiss ass', then I guess you are doing it right.
---
The damage will be undone in DLC where power level caps are increased and old duped items are no longer even close to max power.
---
Yeah I mean you get the bottle cap from drinking nuka colas. Does WV have a 5 cent recycle policy?
---
Robots have weird damage multipliers for body locations, assaultrons in particular don’t take any extra damage from head shots.
---
Also, limbs take less damage. So torso shots are best, the issue is once again robots have weird hitboxes. I get extremely inconsistent results against protectrons and my shotguns, sometimes I 3 shot level 50’s and other times it takes up to six. This is with enough perks and mods to narrow the shotgun pellet cone to a single point, for those of you about to try to blame this on shotgun spread.
---
So I think assaultrons have additional damage reduction, on top of DR. I can melee most super mutants in 1-3 hits, but the Assaultron Dominator in Sugar Grove takes several. With shotguns, I have to blow away a leg then pump a few full magazines into her point-blank. Btw I have perks and mods enough to narrow the pellet spread to a single point at close range, so shotgun spread randomness isn’t the cause of that.
---
Embarrassing to be sure. I do have to say I find it pretty funny sometimes. Nerds are the most entitled people on the planet- and I have 2 boys under 6
---
Since the TSA came about, I have flown three times.
---
The first time, our luggage was searched and my daughter's underwear (all of it) was missing.
---
The second time, on a business trip, one shoe and the stuffed bear my daughter made me at build a bear was gone.
---
The third time, my daughter's blankie was missing. (it was large, and she had a secondary one for travel).
---
That orange spacesuit is amazing. And the helmet is detachable unlike the rocket girl one
---
Some of the unique items that Grahm used to carry are MIA too, which makes finding him a bit less exciting than it used to be.
---
Fallout is big on the east coast. A lot of people are at work or getting ready for it at 8am. I saw it was at like 3-4k just yesterday.

No, I mean the burned ones that’s also exposed to radiations.

Ok thank you

YUP
---
This post might be a smigden negative.
---
If you have to not use setting that are offered, how is it not the engines fault? Isn't that like buying a sports car, stuffing it full of lead bars, and then saying "its not the cars fault for being slow"?
---
&gt;The High/Ultra Presets are simply INSANE and mess up usage on ANY hardware.
---
Why did they have settings that don't work?
---
yup
---
I bought God of War on sale last week for $25. I played it for about 15 minutes, and I haven't played it since. However I've put hundreds of hours in Fallout 76. Weird how people can different opinions, right? It's almost like "one person's shit sandwich is another person's filet mignon".
---
yeah.  that too.  nice input.
---
You're missing grape mentats
---
Only killed one SBQ in the last few days but same thing happened to me. 
---
I want more separate vendor caps. 
---
You can look up the equation. But for example 400/80=5 while 400/83=4.8, while 0.2 might not seem like much the damage/armour equation isn't linear. So a 0.2 is significant. I'll see if i can find the link, but I'm at work and can't really be on my phone to much. There's plenty of threads before that have explained how DR works and how beneficial anti armour perks and mods are and the wiki does have the equation for FO4 which many believe is the same equation used for FO76. Sorry i can't be more helpful, but i think I've posted enough info for you to fact check on your own.
---
Also pretty sure higher tier enemies have more hit points in general. That could also be a factor.
---
Yeah it’s an alien inside a mechanical suit 
---
I'm basically in the same boat, although I have learned that the Overseer only does this if you bomb a site other than Fissure Site Prime.  The game was written from the standpoint that you're either using the nukes to bomb the Queen, or you must be using them against each other.  Farming Whitesprings wasn't a consideration. 😂
---
dont. still looking for a burnt book that used to be playboy
---
not sure what total charisma. is, it is maxed 15 too, but then i got some charisma boosts too.

Fyi those guns in Fo76 are extremely weak
---
It is called parroting.
---
https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/parroting
---
Changing a word to its opposite in this case combines parroting with attempting to create false equivalence, and try to shut down the original speaker while not actually adding a real point. You have fallen for it. I actually noted that both negative and positive screamers on this sub are attempting to shut down actual feedback in my original post, something the attacker notably left out of his post, giving away his intent. 
---
Ask yourself this: are you thinking of ways to dismiss my original post, or are you thinking that feedback of all kinds shouldn’t be blindly shut down on this subreddit? When you wrote your post to me, it was the former. See how that works?
---
You likely have +Carry Weight armor on.  So when you step into your power armor, all your normal armor is unequiped, and you lose the bonuses from the Pocketed and Deep Pocketed items.
---
Time to go find some Calibrated Shock mods for your Power Armor.
---
Thanks for reminding me I should probably unsubscribe from this subreddit!
---
You can do &gt;200 violet Flux (with green thumb) in one run at prime fissure site if the nuke is placed right
---
Aid is key, and they just removed a crap ton from the game. Nukas are going to be very valuable if they keep removing them.
---
Iam confused.  What are people complaining about OP?
---
Speak for yourself. I've always used trash infant 
---
Haha sorry but I mean is there ever?
---
You are exactly right. I was pissed when NMS launched and failed to deliver but Hello Games at least responded appropriately.
---
FO76 is a train wreck and Beth needs to keep hearing how broken the game is. The head in the sand mentality is why companies keep releasing broken games.
---
What were people complaining about now?
---
Because they work. It's visuals. If the game developper thinks it's a good idea, they add it. I don't see your point, sorry.
---
Thanks for the kind wishes! Im okay just thought it would be funny!
---
Hot crap, is THAT what it is??? I posted last week about how strange it is that Scorchbeasts seem to be decimating my lady's and my fusion core supply whenever we fight them, and I got downvoted into oblivion without any tips. 
---
Scorchbeast fights are probably the only time I'm both in my power armor AND using extensive amounts of VATS. 
---
Amazing. And also definitely broken! Thank you for figuring this out! We were going through 1-2 cores per SB fight!!
---
(Level 45ish and 50ish)
---
Take it slow and explore everything you come across. Much of the story is told through terminal entries and notes placed throughout the world. Plowing through the main quests will cause you to skip over a lot of exposition on what happened in Appalachia during the 25 years you were in the Vault. 
---
If you’d like some armor or weapons to help get you started, feel free to message me and I’ll be happy to craft some stuff for ya. :)
---
Ive learned it, but I dont know where I got it. 
---
I ran a server hop study for a week before patch 5, and I never saw the torso at a vendor. [Heres that spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12LdNVotf_h9DnpsK2mHU-LkJPNfTy-3a8zpePSn-3WQ/edit?usp=drivesdk)

Might have gotten lucky and learned it from scrapping...

Having fed Dogmeat, Arch set out to collect the night's fertilizer production.  As he headed towards the brahmin pit, Arch noticed a dead ghoul.............
---
Thank you! Cheers!
---
Finding Calibrated Shocks for Excavator Armor shouldn't be too hard. Thanks for the tip! 
---
What sort of placement? An advantage of the General is the lack of scorched coming after you as you collect, but I'm open to adjusting my Prime targeting too. 
---
Fuckin a to that brother. 
---
Make useless junk like that player side 
---
I've seen people in the past 24 hours complaining that their anti-Bethesda posts get removed by mods.  I've also seen people in the past 24 hours complaining that their pro-Bethesda posts get removed by mods.
---
Maybe the pro- or anti- doesn't matter as much as the quality of the content does.
---
Maybe there are different mods with completely different biases.
---
Maybe the hamsters powering Reddit are goofing up.
---
Maybe our whole world is a giant video game.
---
Anyway, I'm cool with the way Bethesda did it.  Now they need to give Two-shots, explosives, and TSEs a re-buff.
---
I miss that to..
---
&gt;I gravitate to my ski sword.
---
me too - love that spiked bastard....and cheap to fix
---
At this point? Yes, it is the customer's fault. If someone doesn't know how buggy the game is after like week one, they're not paying attention and going into their purchase blind. 
---
Atom Store make make this a reality!!!
---
It's been like that for weeks. 
---
I have coils on my farming PA so all I have to do is run around and gather them and they are automatically tagged. This makes it easy for lower levels to sit on the wall and tag them as well. I just tank them around the parking lot and finish them off when they have been tagged by everyone else.
---
I agree. Couple the lost subs here, a dead friends list, and discord ghost towns, and either people are tired of the toxicity or more likely have quit the game and moved on to other titles. 
---
Wow! this was my first ever post on Reddit! Thanks for all the upvotes I loved reading all the comments, hope everyone had a good valentines day! Does this mean i'm not a lurker now?! 
---
Also r/TalesfromAppalachia if you just want to share your FO76 Stories/Experiences. We are about to start pushing for more content again, not a bad time to visit. FilthyCasuals and our sub are part of the same network. 
---
If you are using VATS, I can guarantee that’s where your fusion core drain is coming from. I’ve been tracking this issue for the past month and I’ve tested it on both characters since. Here’s to hoping that this issue gets more visibility and eventually addressed to provide us all with a more acceptable burn rate for our poor fusion cores! Sorry to hear your post was downvoted into oblivion, I’ll cross my fingers that mine fares a bit better but I won’t hold my breath. :P
---
As i expected, they only removed suspicions items, and left the players each of one . People who did buy just a single gun were not affected.
---
Yeah, I usually experience a period of 5-20 seconds after loading in and being able to move around where lots of things aren't rendered or synchronized. This was especially obvious when server hopping in a place like Phoenix's shop. Neither the vendor or enemies will load in during this time. Junk items will load in on all the shelves client-side, but they aren't synchronized to the server. During this time they aren't lootable, and if you've already looted them that day, they'll disappear at the same time the NPCs appear. This has been the case for a long time, probably since the beginning.
---
The fact that the armor equation isn't linear was the piece I was missing. Your original statement was a little mystifying to me because I'm not familiar with the formulas involved or sure where to look them up, but I understand what you meant now.
---
Every. Damn. Day.  It's honestly the my favorite part of this game.  I use so many shotgun shells do it and it's worth every one.  When I hear a distant car blowing up I always ask my teammate "Did you blow up my car? Who blew up my car?"  She always points them out too.  "Hey G, you missed a car." to which I come running no matter what I'm doing. 
---
Does no one here play any other online game? This shit *happens*. It happens all the fucking time. But no, apparently Bethesda isn't supposed to have the same problems other online game producers have, even though this is their first online game. 
---
I swear, the way people talk about this game, you'd think it was their first online multiplayer. 
---
It was fine, no English teachers in this sub as far a I can tell :)
---
PS: how did you get the laughing emote into the post?
---
For them, there's /r/Fallout 
---
See? There's a place for everyone. 
---
Yeah, 100%. I noticed some players have gotten it, you may have just been one of the few.
---
It's just a place to goof around and have fun. 
---
Holy shit - I think it will, thanks!
---
The bloodied TSEs would definitely be amazing if they were a thing. 
---
Heavy weapons user huh? I guess we're safe!
---
But why would you want to use that thing? Is ugly AF and lame lol
---
Well you did a great job documenting, so I have hope! :)
---
I'm not sure everyone on here are 'adults'.  Probably far from it.
---
But the magazine spawn locations are fixed, or can they literally spawn anywhere? I thought the only spawns that were randomized with RNG were the containers.
---
Welcome to my world, where my stash is always full and I'm in a constant battle to stay under 430 lbs in modded excavator armor.
---
Bulk and sell things.  I bulk until there is less than 50 of each item unbulked.  Anything that's not bulkable gets sold with me keeping at most 50.  (Except springs.)
---
When bulking, go for the highest value items first.  That way you can simply drop your extra 500 steel scrap when you run out of plastic.
---
If we do make it in the same servers as them then I'll wait for you guys to finish having your fun griefing them before i jump in and throw them the follow me to my camp emote and offer them shelter and aid, show them the good side of the wasteland too. But thats just so i can get them to full health so i can trap em in that concrete base i made filled with traps and flame throwers. I have yet to see someone go through the maze completely without dying. 
---
I'm not condemning Bethesda here just because you want me to say that releasing a game with bugs is baad. Saying a product is "unfinished" with regards to a game that has a complete story when it's released seems like you're just bitching about bugs. Which, if you are, cool, but bugs don't mean a product is "unfinished". Find me a bug-free online multiplayer game. 
---
I have stopped picking up notes due to this issue. I read them and set them down for the next person. Kinda like in real life. I look at F76 as a giant sacvenger hunt where I get to slougter my oponits and beat them to the prize!! I'm just nice enough to leave them clues for when they respond so they can continue their quest 😁😏
---
Wait, I'm still subbed here?  /s
---
&gt;stash their flux

Song title, name of band.

---
I've landed on the same server multiple times when server hopping before yesterdays maintenance. It wasn't a patch btw. It could mean there are just a few servers available with a space available so it just puts you back into the same one. I don't know. It does seem a lot of their changes have been working towards making server hopping obsolete, as it could be putting unnecessary pressure on the servers, with the loot stuff, cap stashes, vendor plans, etc. But then there are still respawning mobs and events as reasons to server hop, and trying to find plans from world spawns, etc. So as much as they try I think it will always be in some way a necessary way to do what you want to do in the game.
---
This was patched months ago. Everytime you pick something up theres a 22 hour timer till you can pick it up today.
---
I dont think this is it. I am having this problem on my melee character with power armor.  Jet pack seem to have a passive drain even when not using it, as long as its modded on you.
---
Happened to me with the enclave quest, I figured there is a progress checkpoint somewhere in the questline.
---
Might be a problem for me, as I get distracted easily. 
---
Agreeed... It should have been a higher priority. I fear the behind the scenes was pretty rough due to producers pulling people to work on Starcraft and Elder Scrolls 6. It seems to me they need s much larger dev team to be able to expand like they have been trying to do.
---
It's almost like an OCD thing for me at this point to blow up every vehicle I come across
---
If you see the chance to a get duped item that is awesome - go for it. Bethesda won't punish you for it if you don't have more than one.
---
Cats like to eat moths...
---
Thanks for clearing that up. Many recently uploaded YouTube “farming guides” act like this is still a thing.
---
Duping has gone further underground now. They move in shadows , not like Walmart greeters
---
500
---
Wait explain that again
---
Hard to read with zero punctuation, and redundant sentences. 
---
The comma struggle is real. 
---
Upvoting and counter w/older versions of babies..
---
Magazines have set spawns yes ,but you can find any them at each location. 
---
The fact that you found this or that in any location is random.
---
You don't find the tesla mags in labs,or scout life in camping spots.
---
It's more about mentally being casual lol. 
---
Constructive critisism is allowed, just not the incessant cacophony of repeating the same minor bugs as "breaking the game".
---
For people who actually play the game it's easy to spot the difference.
---
And if they make it through the fight im taking their flux.
---
It's the 80, 20, 5 rule.  80% don't get bothered by posts.  20% get bothered by posts and a mere 5% leave because they are bothered so much by the posts.
---
More like pistol vs shotgun.
---
I've lived in Michigan my entire 40 year life and I've never once seen or heard if that moth. Had to look it up. Pink and yellow? Crazy. 
---
Also, isn't it more realistic for you to play yourself as the grandfather since the game is in the future?
---
Thanks so much for this, commenting so i can adjust tomorrow.
---
Let me ask you, if i understand correctly, you recommend using Geforce experience? I just switched to an nvidia card for FO76 and had read all over to not even download Geforce experience as it was bugged. I found some setting tweaks someone suggested to make in the Invidia control panel so i did that. 
---
Would you be able to recommend ideal settings for the control panel or should i just download geforce experience and call it a day?
---
I have a GTX 1060, I5 4460 and 8GB ram. 
---
Thanks again!
---
Confirmed.  I did it solo; didn't seem as hard as I expected.
---
Ha very true, shell casings are heavy. The bag might work for a few rounds but once there’s a bunch you will start to struggle with the balance. 
---
You arnt kidding 
---
When they banned the duper's accounts a few weeks back, they followed it up with a letter to the community which included the following details.  Seeing as how the majority of accounts banned had a minimum of half a million duped items and some of them contained tens of millions of items, billions seems like a fair estimate to me
---
&gt;To date, the majority of accounts that have been turned off are accounts that have managed to collect over 500,000 (in some cases, tens of millions) of specific rare items (for example, Halloween Candy, Nuka-Colas, or Ultracite Scrap) inside of a 30-day period.

Gifted by the devs to only those of worth, just like this godly player who takes his time to help others :D
---
*(obviously account bound)*
---
This is just about most gaming subs nowadays. You know why? Because devs are so out of touch with gamers currently in all genres. They are making nincompoop decisions and gamers are getting sick of it.
---
Apex Legends subreddit is still in its honeymoon phase so I can’t use that specific sub as an example of a good one. However their game is fantastic. They aren’t making changes to it (yet) that leave you baffled if they even have a clue what game they are creating.
---
I rock out the blade of Bassett. That anti armor is pretty good for a non legendary. I would trade for a better legendary sword if I got one. The two hands are great power. But too much carry weight for my build
---
Mutation serums are cheap enough for me to just buy extras if I need them.   
---
I'd rather burn a few caps and keep a card slot open for something else.
---
I wish I shared your experience, but I still had disconnects and spinning disk corpse inventories at Whitespring. In fairness, half the server population was all in one place, which the game doesn't seem to like. 
---
It serves a point, even if functionally it didn’t do much. Why? It slaps people who engaged in duping or taking advantage of it with a direct action, from the developers, and shows this was not acceptable. 
---
They can either accept that or whine about it here or the forums. Personally I hope they do. “I got teh banz0r’d and didn’t hack anything no really pinky promise u guais!!1one” posts are somewhat entertaining.
---
Lots of server hopping.  I have only 1 currently.
---
Also... this is the Excavator Armor you are stepping into?  If you have the entire set equipped it should provide a +100 passive carry weight by itself.  Which is hard to reach with plain armor (Deep Pocketed everything would be +50).  I'd make sure you are not missing an excavator piece (like, equipped a T60 head or something, or a Jetpack torso you found for another type).
---
Calibrated Shock for Each Leg, +50 per leg
---
Motion Assist Servo for Torso, +2 STR (translates to +10 carry weight)
---
Passive Excavator Armor bonus for complete set, +100 Carry Weight
---
Yes, using the jet pack torso mod does drain your fusion core significantly, too. From what I've read in other posts, it does so apparently much faster than anything else. Good observation!  They're different issues but both are definitely in the same boat with regards to massive fusion core usage.
---
Note its not a movie its a post ill make in here of a story, not a video
---
For real, every time I go to this sub there's always either someone writing up a dictionary length book on how broken the game is, or it's someone's "I'm desperate for attention" essay about how they don't like the community and are leaving.
---
You and I may differ as to what is acceptable to the allocation of Special points, but here is what I use when I am on my heavy weapons. 
---
11 points in strength - all set to heavy weapon perks.
---
5 points in intelligence - all set to demolition.
---
I think it's pretty good with a TSE mini-gun.
---
Ah, I understand.
---
Ah, sensible. 
---
I would say it's probably due to something else in the code/patch they changed related to stealth (perhaps perks or even weapons changes - it very well could be related to something in the code that on the surface doesn't have anything to do with stealth), so it's not as easy as reverting stealth modes back to before patch 5.
---
Yea right...I misspoke.  It's bloodied explosive.
---
Yeah I still like FO3 way better.  There were a few in game mechanics I liked from FONV, but story, Id rather be in FO3.
---
Depends what the thing is. Containers. Yes. Items, hmm people have some different theories. Plans that spawn in the world. If you know the exact location where something spawns and something else spawns there and you pick it up, yeah you have to wait, but if you don't pick it up and server hop more, the one you want will eventually appear.
---
amazing
---
Can confirm this did fix it for me. Thanks all
---
hopefully they look into all of them, not just the BOS mods, as Pocketed and Deep Pocketed mods are MIA as well.  And possibly many others.
---
(I don't think I've seen Pump Action shot gun plans on any vendor).
---
101, and me neither. I feel it's not worth the ammo and constantly repairing because weapons are made from chinesium.
---
I have the full set, but I swap between the Excavator Torso and a Jetpack Torso I have on occasion, depends on where I'm at. Didn't know I needed the full set to give the bonus lmao. I'm still a noob at this game.
---
Its annoying but you just gotta visit some more spots than usual. What you looking for?
---
The radiation is like 85% of the taste though 
---
That would explain why 6 high levels shredded her in 10 minutes yesterday. I didn’t realize she scaled by participant. I will say it was a thing of beauty for an ad hoc group. Heavy gunners hammered her in the air and the melee players kept the minions at bay. The second she landed, she was cooked. 
---
I'm sure it could use a bunch of polish, but just rattling off thoughts off the top of my head, I think it would be pretty cool! :) 
---
Reddit banned them duping legendary whining.
---
Giveaway events? Tell me more! Are you part of a guild or something?
---
Their mistakes have nothing to do with the game being online. Someone at Bethesda decided not to train their new studio on how to use the creation engine. This brought us all the continuing issues even a drunk modder could fix. The community has been doing a lot of work for them. Threads with full bug reports have been popping up all over the place. Yet, in every decision and action they took they either made a mistake or just outright ignored issues. The "purge" is the first time they didn't do anything wrong. The first time since the game exists. That is not a good track record and not something that should be expected behaviour of a known company like Bethesda.  
---
Hey, you're welcome as well.  
---
Honestly, I don't think it's a good idea. I don't use Gefore Experience myself but I did in the past.  
---
Until I had some issues with Afterburner and that has more priority for me.
---
Geforce Experience would use their own Configuration File for the game that they think is best for your graphic card.  
---
Another thing I recommend is resetting your Fallout 76 Nvidia Control Panel settings, just because there really is no need for it. People say you get a performance boost, but all they're doing is uncapping fps. Duh. lol  
---
I think the stuff I wrote in my guide should be enough. If you still think it's not enough, I recommend you then try to tinker around with some more things. I'll assist you with that, if you want.  
---
And thanks for posting your specs. I think you'll be totally fine with the Textures set to High, Shadow Quality on Medium/High and Lighting on Medium. Maybe play around with those a bit in case the 1060 is at its limits.   
---
Atleast we will get to hear the squealing from it now! Sweet, sweet 99% utilization. Haha xD
---
Most people claiming that people left because they got tired of the complaint posts...maybe some also just stopped playing the game and unsubbed
---
"IM HOLDING A SIGN"
---
I will always help low level folks like this at the golf course because it was scary as hell when I did it the first time, and that was early on when you could still get low level mobs there.  And it's just not possible any longer.
---
As someone who has just got his hands on TSE weapons, I couldn't imagine how effective they used to be prior to the nerf.
---
As it sits, I can plow through enemies with little threat with the TSE combat shotgun and TSE lever action.
---
Sadly I found it on FNV a couple of days ago and I can't loot enemies converted into dust or goo since then... Looking for a fix, if someone can help.
---
Plot Twist: They were level 3 and 5 when they went into the bathroom.
---
you could also have quest were you try to take some of the enclaves robots or something
---
Crashed twice in 6 hours, both crashes at Whitesprings and about 2 hours apart.
---
All duped weapons have not been removed from the game. I just made a post about this. 
---
So far I have only ran into 1 set of griefers so far all the others have been really helpful to me crafting me armor or weapons etc... 
---
My rule of thumb is no more then 200 of a resource except for high usage like steel. Which I keep no more then 300. 
---
The rest I bulk and sell. With the recent changes with plans. You’ll be hard pressed to hit cap on currency. 
---
I used to that all time. But now I don't need to buy any plans at this very moment. What are you buying if you don't mind me asking?
---
How many blades could a metal blade blade if a metal blade could blade blades?
---
Justified 
---
Yeah. And the truth is. It isn't hard to police them after I'm done at the range. Just inconvenient but we are suppose to pick up after ourselves anywhere when we're finished. The bag might be nice during a class bc I'm not digging thri dirt for cases but I'm usually so beat after a class that idc about it. Lol
---
I was wondering WTF was going on. Last night I went to a fissure to fight a Scorchbeast and I started off with one full core. I basically use VATS exclusively with my build and I kid you not I had to get out of my PA like a third through the fight because my core was gone. I thought something funky happened but now I know. What a shit design decision.
---
I play legendary roulette.  
---
I put down a legendary using an automatic weapon and clip the car behind it.  
---
Whump, the flames start.  
---
Can I get to the corpse, loot the goodies (1* Pichfork, +1 strength), and get to minimum safe distance before it all goes off....
---
People leaving because there's less to complain about.
---
Your post gave me an idea: I want to be the weird guy with a flamethrower at some run down camp desperately asking passersby for more flamer fuel or acid to make more. Eventually it becomes clear I have an irrational fear of radioactive moths and am using the flamethrower to defend myself. If they agree and trade me I trade them back rewards similar to quest rewards. I’ll note down anyone who plays along, and only let them be rewarded once a day. 
---
Basically: RP as a nutty quest NPC, whose quest hangs a lampshade on the broken state of flamers and their fuel.
---
Play Fallout and Fallout 2 and find out.
---
also play Brotherhood of Steal and Tactics but don’t tell anyone because you’ll get raked thru the coals if you like them haha
---
Want to buy weightless protest sign. Text SELLING junk im encumbered.
---
 GeForce isnt necessary, it doesn't change any settings you can't change yourself, it doesn't do anything magic when you use the optimize button.  If you aren't comfortable setting things up yourself or you want Shadow play then by all means use it.  I personally consider it bloatware because I have no use for what it does but it isn't going to hurt anything to install it and it can give a good starting point for tweaking.
---
You  make  a good point.
---
However, I'm willing to bet my left testicle that **you're a shill account**. 
---
The maximum cap limit is only 25,000 which is pathetic. I maxed out long ago and had to create mule characters just to store the stuff I picked up but can’t sell. I drop lots of stuff near the vendorbots too so others can just grab them to use or sell. The 1400 and total 25000 limit kills my motivation. What was Bethesda thinking when they put in those silly limits. If you want the players to grind hard you need to let the economy flow. Why do I even go after that wanted idiot when my account is capped. 
---
God, and how about keys? And Robco passwords? I did a take-all from that guy who hacked Watoga, and have like 40 of the damn things. 
---
I'm lvl 83, and just started the end quests. Is it bad that I've fought SBQ and whitesprings enough that I want to use my first nuke for more nefarious purposes?
---
Not for the purposes of griefing, but it would be amusing to randomly nuke one of the more populated C.A.M.P. areas, or some random area that almost never sees a nuke. I'm more interested in flux ATM, than end game loot.
---
In other words about not having a stick up own arse and treating people respectfully? A wise approach if you asked me.
---
Why don't you go outside and play, little fella....the grown-ups are talking.
---
Every vendor adds a portion of the caps you spend with them to their inventory. This isn't exclusive to Watoga.
---
its also not the only one there is several pro fallout and several rager places for similar info and most people eventually filter toward them 
---
My biggest gripe with electricity is how hard it is to make sure that your conduit runs straight and starts the right distance from a wall.
---
What's your method for passing power between floors?
---
If the game was good, would this be a cesspool? 
---
Could be coincidence but the best luck I've had at finding him is on the road on the north side of Charleston Landfill.
---
I'm a bit confused why you seem determined that you want the last word but also want this conversation to end. You've said goodbye 4 times but you just can't leave.
---
You see that's the issue though. I don't think OP is against complaining or critiquing the game.
---
It's the abhorrent and unnecessary hate slandering of the game that gets to you, and I agree wholeheartedly.
---
It's one thing to complain, or make an issue known, or voice your disdain so BethAustin can know how wide spread this issue is among the gaming community... but that's not the attitude that drives people down to the ground. **It's all the bandwagon hate mongering that just gets some users utterly exhausted to even look at the sub.**
---
Very much what Nosimo just said. I wanted to make a second edit telling you, you can set everything up yourself.  
---
In fact, you don't even need to tinker in the configuration files yourself. You can do the stuff from the guide in the in-game menu. :)
---
Yep. Been posting about events an opened several tickets. A TON of events are bugged an you cant do them.
---
Then don't lick boots by thanking companies for shitting on customer standards.
---
If they have precious loot i move my camp on top of it so they would have to pick the lock to get inside and recover their loot, now they're wanted and I'm just the good guy collecting the bounty. 
---
It should be a lootable item on the corpse of a protester surrounded by a mound of dead robot corpses. 
---
Two exploitable in an online game unfortunately. Also some variation of the existing system makes the most sense in a realistic way as well. Any vendor is going to take a profit first off the top and aren't going to sell back to you every penny that they earned from your previous sale.
---
That said the percentage that becomes available again could be tweaked, or the cap limit removed for when you buy an item. So that if you buy a 5000 cap item the store doesn't just have 200 back in inventory again after.
---
I've been living in Harpers Ferry WV for 15 years now and have loved being able to walk around in familiar places.  I've been climbing at Seneca Rocks for many years and being able to see that distinct fin shape was pretty awesome!  I even setup my base on the path up to Seneca and chatted with several folks when they visited my base and were fixing themselves up. Good times!
---
The familiarity with the real world and this game feels like a once in a lifetime scenario!
---
Glamdring.
---
Yeah, luckily I got mine before that patch, only had to get the BOS arms "the hard way" by server hopping grafton some 30 odd times.
---
 Ive read some speculation that the available list the vendor is supposed to have is longer than the max number of items the vendor can load. Not really sure what gets prioritized in that scenario tho. Alphabetically doesnt really make sense.
---
I think the vagueness was on purpose and sort of a stroke of brilliance. They probably figured by being vague people who knew they had duped items might get rid of them on their own (if you traded for a weapon and only thought you might have a duped weapon, why wouldn't you wait until after the purge to see) and as such cut down on the time they had to be in maintenance to delete all the instances. Then, to be a fair as possible to people who might have bought duped weapons but weren't sure,  let them keep one. also counting down on maintenance time because they were only looking for instances where people held more than 1 instead of every instance people held one.  
---
I, for one, am totally happy with how they handled this.
---
ahhh good point, there are the Flight Helmets in game, but they also lack defense bonuses
---
Did you happen to try and steal the Holy Grail from a Frenchman in a castle?
---
I have the same problem with some legendary armor. Still haven't been able to work it out. 
---
Oh, come on, r/fo76 isn't *that* bad.
---
All PA and armor plans .Currently  I can make all power armors, and have most of the high cost mod plans. Once I have all PA plans, Ill buy all the gun plans.
---
Out of curiosity what areas are you only getting 30ish fps in with be an 8700/1080 combo?  I run a 7700/1080 and @1440p Im usually around 90, though a few areas drop to 60s (nuke zones be and such).  I just set everything ultra and haven't bothered tweaking.
---
#THE NERVE!
---
I saw sister Susie selling sharp swords by the sea side. I said "Susie, you sure your swords are sharp?" She said "Sure, the sharpest swords by the shore!"
---
I have it yet to accomplish
---
I got 600 hours of play out of it. But I don't see myself playing even 30 more min until there is some massive content updates. Once you get bored of repeated tasks games over. Hopefully the new content brings better replay value. Launching nukes an doing the queen is boring after 200 times. Most the events which are a huge part of the games content are bugged an cant even be done right now.
---
I agree that assaultrons are a bit too bullet spongy (as are a lot of things imo) but strictly compared to protectrons I see no issue with a lower level assaultron still being vastly superior to a high level protectron.
---
The protectron is an odd beast anyway.  The weak point is the body instead of the head from my experience. Bot weak points in general aren't always obvious.
---
Also, from a lore standpoint, the protectron is like the base model bot while an assaultron is a high end military grade murder machine, so it would have much higher quality armor and weaponry than a base model bot would have.
---
The protectron is basically just a walking tin can regardless of level while the assaultron is a much higher quality piece of hardware.
---
Totally true. For indoor ranges my friends would just borrow a broom and sweep and collect them relatively easily. Outdoor ranges are a different story, you literally have to dig dirt to get most of them, it’s a real pita lol 
---
More like fo76circlejerk. All the people who dont want to hear negatives just positives
---
Then what's stopping players from accidentally grabbing multiple keys again?
---
Bethesda should implement modran's suggestion first, then go through with your idea. 
---
Thx, Thats good to know. 
---
Rngesus will smile upon your sacrifices 
---
i'm definitely going to give it a shot. I really appreciate you taking the time to advise me! 
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
You're surrounded by lvl 40+  bullet sponge charred ghouls because there's some level 107 hanging around and all the mobs have scaled up to match him.
---
No i mean the game not the sub lol
---
Also reducing turret budget by a lot would help to defend your CAMP.
---
No it wont. They said you would drop junk and aid. Weapons and armor is not in either of those tabs. 
---
Ferreal, ferreal. No play play.
---
wonder how many dumped their stock of dupes just before the update
---
"we" aren't recruiting at all. The bitching and negativity that's this entire sub is doing it for us, and people are just posting that it isn't full of the bullshit that happens here. 
---
To answer your question, we had a whopping 161 subs and 35k page views yesterday. 
---
I meant using txt for those who don't want, or cannot use voice. I mean every MMO I've played going back to the 90's had this feature.
---
I would love to hear their explanation of why they refuse to use or even acknowledge the existence of the work done by the modding community towards bug fixes for 76. I'm positive that it's based on legal advice.
---
I daresay that was how things played out in Bethesda's imagination when they were making this game with their whole mantra of "make your own fun". Too bad it was a little far fetched and people would rather just farm whitesprings and SBQ all day long.
---
Its not just ghouls. I had it happen to other types as well. Super mutants, gulpers, wolves, scorched, and deathclaws.
---
i dont consider myself a noob for most things but when it comes to video card settings i have no clue, lol. TBH, i hate that i have this huge gap of knowledge but i also don't have the time to dedicate to learn it all. Gaming for me is, unfortunately, an occasional treat. 
---
Is this for real? They have 2 factor authentication now? Or did op log into a phishing site?
---
How is it exploitable only one person can use a trader at a time?
---
Oh man. You should check out the Rust community! They’re so open minded.
---
Hey. It's good to hear that.  
---
There are really only certain areas where usage just goes to oblivion.  
---
However, you should also see the usage not being right sometimes. Though you're probably in a different situation because you're already playing @1440p.  
---
The areas I had issues in are the area I'm looking at near Charleston Station, Harper's Ferry at the Fast Travel location if you move a bit to the spot where you can find the Marine Plans (that's where I dropped to 31 with 55% gpu usage), Flatwoods at the greenhouses (where you do the event) looking towards the town and a couple more.  
---
I'm pretty sure you could squeeze some more out of it, especially if you're on a 144hz monitor it'd be worth it even more. :)  
---
If you decide to try this out, let me know how it goes, perhaps.
---
More or less. We formed a group based on the BoS. Since the chapter is dead in-game, we are attempting to recreate it. That turned from a few of us randomly chasing down new players to give them level appropriate arms/armor to a full fledged discord community. 
---
https://discord.gg/NyvjFUc
---
Our events are set up so that if anyone level 1-45 comes by, we can set them up with a full set of the best arms/armor we can craft for their level. We usually get folks under lvl 30, higher levels usually do their own thing. 
---
Higher level folks can swing in and we'll do mods at cost for them. Power armor upgrades, weapons, armor, whatever. We have our local traders around to if they want to buy stuff. The whole event is run on donations of supplies and such from the community. Especially the lower level legendary items. We just give those away if we have any. 
---
So far they have been a big hit. 
---
Oh yeah, fuck that part of the blade quest. So many radioactive ghouls. 
---
More like...
---
***WHUMP!***
---
"Oh no. I missed that ghoul. There are bodies laying everywhere that I haven't looted yet-"
---
***BOOM! BAM! WHAM!***
---
***\*Bodies fly in all directions.***
---
"Well shit. I guess I'm not looting those.
---
At the golf club to the left of the double doors. Take a penny leave a penny
---
Never saw one...
---
the Overseer literally want's us to nuke the SBQ
---
I know.
---
I meant the sub.
---
Vampire costume 
---
No, it’s grown ups tired of crying. We do get the game needs work, but understand whining constantly fixes nothing.
---
I know it’s strange, but seem people can enjoy things regardless of other’s opinions.
---
I’m missing something here.
---
I think the robot is a bit fragile, and is spawned when the event loads. If it aggros something, I'm pretty sure it dies. I traveled to one near one of the quarries, and arrived literally a half second before a mirelurk queen killed the bot. 
---
&gt; Yes the extra six perk cards are probably very worthwhile for the Scorch Beast Queen, but how often do you fight it?
---
At least once per hour?  There's always a discord group nuking prime.  Seems worth it tbh.
---
Last night I had at least 3 mobs that disappeared as soon as I killed them, so it's not limited to SBQ. (Xbox)
---
Sure thing dude. That's why I've made this post/guide thing.
---
Might as well let others enjoy the game some more.
---
So just because an issue didn't get fixed by the next patch, they're just ignoring that particular issue? Do you have proof of that?
---
I've heard this argument before, over on r/overwatch. "They don't care about Doomfist; his hitbox is too small since his nerf and Blizzard hasn't said *anything*!" Then like two patches later they made it bigger again, all without saying anything to the community. You don't need to say that you're aware of literally every single issue. 
---
Seriously, the toxicity and childish behaviour of this thread does all the recruiting for us.
---
I've only encountered 3.. 2 Red, and a green (glowing) one last night. The green one was the only one I was able to kill before it flew away. 
---
&gt; Accidentally Damaging another player’s C.A.M.P. will no longer tag you as WANTED 
---
That's how I became wanted  the one and only time. I was testing  the new scope on my .44 like at level 20, shooting Super  Mutants  from far away. Must have hit some clown's The Sims house, because  the next thing I know some high-level knob is chasing me across the map.
---
Good times.
---
I get similar problems to 1 when we try to team up. Usually we have to chat on discord and all get to the main menu and join the team from there like you have in 3. It's really annoying because the social tab UI just does nothing, you click send or accept and it does nothing.
---
We also get visibility glitches fairly regularly after fast travelling together one of us will turn invisible for the session unless they exit out of the game completely and join back in. I haven't seen number 2 before though.
---
Yeah but this changes the set up from checking "does player have item X00985 in their inventory?" and keeping track of each separate key as an item to making the key ring item and it being "Is door unlocked for player" and they keyring answering yes or no. The more I think about this though this saves a miniscule amount of time/data
---
That particular bug is not fixed on xbox as I had it happen to me last night.
---
pretty much, I'm getting nothing but an outpouring of thanks that the sub exists. Negativity festers and spreads, people just don't want it to ruin their game that they paid money for, flaws and all. 
---
Screen shot with a time stamp would go far to prove what you're saying.
---
Outside of some kind of proof, I guess we'll have to take your word for it because who would make up a story on the internet...
---
Super mutants were mutated by F.E.V. I recommend going on YouTube and looking up Oxhorn   Check out his video on Westek he explains everything about the super mutants and why they are in Appalachia.  I’m not sure if he has a video explaining the schorched but all of Oxhorn’s videos are very well put together and gives you all the story and lore from all the fallouts. 
---
You're gonna lose the only testicle you have left, bud. That's a dangerous move.
---
To be fair, that achievement is glitched.. Myself and at least four of my friends never had it unlock even when we’re closing in on level 100+.
---
I like Watoga, Phoenix, Harpers, Whitespring Then bunker, R&amp;G station, Lewisburg. Welch too just to check for BoS plan
---
The vendors are a little higher level than the other raider/responders for better plans to check
---
Flatwoods, Sutton, Whitesprings, Enclave (grab Technical Data), Harper's Ferry, Camp Venture (turn in Technical Data), Watoga / Phoenix, Watoga Rail.
---
Sent a DM with spoilers
---
yeah, the skeleton factory! i saw the note but didnt get the reference. cool place none the less
---
It’s all pics and game talk, all the flavour without the extra sodium.
---
Make it both and do the world a favour!
---
Is not theory, is truth.
---
lol, it took me about 100 tries to get all 3 different BOS plans.. arms were a PAIN for some reason, but chest/legs kept coming up much more often
---
thats what i like about this game, there are so many higher level people that genuinely want to help
---
The choo choo noise man!
---
I agree that it's a problem they should be looking into at some point. As a fairly low level sniper, I was excited to finally build my Excavator armor, but when I realized that it really wasn't going to be sustainable with my VATS build, I was so disappointed. Now I basically only use it as black and yellow taxi for fast traveling while over-encumbered.
---
I've seen this with other events besides Census Violence. My theory is that there's an active event somewhere else in the world, but it's displaying the wrong event marker on the map, and this discrepancy somehow causes fast travel to fail. It could also explain the inconsistent travel costs, if it's calculating the cost to another point on the map.
---
You can trade back and forth the same caps and sell 10,000 caps worth of stuff to a vendor with 200 caps
---
I wish scummy youtubers who only cover F76 when there is some bad news also lost subs. They are even making things up by them selfs like levelcap, this asian guy or even juicehead lately.
---
Whats with the extra stuff on your map
---
&gt; because it can't just make up what keys you have on the fly.
---
           
---
It can check on the fly. 
---
I found an item with this name somewhere in Helvetia.
---
I guess I never really considered it to be a bug since VATS also drained fusion cores in Fallout 4 like it was nobody's business.  I always just assumed it was functioning as designed and stocked up on extra cores if I knew I'd be going somewhere I needed it.
---
This post like these are the only reason I haven’t left this sub reddit
---
I can show you where a mothman spawns almost every other server....
---
I saw it at a vendor once during the last three months 
---
I know a few as well, they missed a lot.
---
I guess arrogance is commonplace amongst the uninformed huh. Because who would look up readily available information on the internet...
---
If the game had the skill tree from Skyrim would be a one hand skill increased joke in there.
---
I have 3 handmade's for sale.. 
---
\*Berserker's Handmade - More damage the lower your damage resistance
---
\*Stalker's Hardened piercing Handmade -  If not in combat, +100% VATS accuracy at +50% AP cost
---
\*\*Mutant's Automatic Handmade - 25% Faster Fire Rate, Damage increased by 10% if you are mutated
---
Let me know if you are interested in any of them. I know you are buying the TSE one, but figured i'd throw these up here
---
I would upvote this 20 more times if I could. I loathe inventory clutter, I don't care that it's weightless.
---
I laugh everytime I see a Fallout 76 post, people wasting money on a broken game and furthering bad practices on the game industry.
---
Well a sucker is born every day xD
---
If they put in the system from Fallout 4, I can guarantee you players like me would have every purchasable item within a few days, even with the super high prices they have now.  It simply doesn't work in an online economy
---
Super Mutants have been in the Fallout universe sense the beginning, and were created by giving humans a virus, the F.E.V..  They are not able to breed on their own, and need to take humans captive in order to create new Super Mutants with the F.E.V..
---
Scorched are new with Fallout 76, and part of the story is finding out where they came from.  [You learn pretty early on that scorchbeasts carry a virus that turns humans into scorched.  And that's why there are no human NPCs around, they've all fled or were turned into scorched.](/spoiler)  
---
This isn't the only wave of dupe deletes, just the first. They'll probably get something like that when they delete PAs and the other items not on the 400 list. Doubt this post is even legit, ha
---
Oh please dont tell me I did
---
What do you think about Tim from Hardware Unboxed's settings guide?
---
https://youtu.be/L92X9nFssDY
---
they will definitely be adding cult of mothman story down the line. Have you found the investigator's cabin? He has files on the cult of mothman that will be released in the future. 
---
Grahm sells the fusion generator plans, I bought them yesterday. 200 caps with two points in hard bargain.   
---
It's similar to Elder Scrolls transactions as well. Basically you mark things you want to sell and buy in on the inventory screen (sell on your inventory, buy on the vendors). As you mark things, the "amount" changes - it's just the difference in the value of what you're selling vs buying.
---
The upshot is you could sell far more than 200 caps worth of inventory as long as you are buying items worth withing 200 caps of what you are selling.
---
Conscientious objector
---
This video addresses the community issues really well:
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
---
I just logged in to ubisoft with new password, I'm good, yeah
---
When selling to vendors, we have to do the math as we move the slider. Or try to sell x amount to see the value. Please add a value to the slider bar as we are selling. Shouldn’t be hard to implement the value on the slider while selling. Please and thank you 
---
well, i dont personally have evidence to verify it, even though it's what i believe, so i have to call it a theory. I try not to spread misinformation. 
---
Unlimited caps, unlimited stash.  If it breaks the economy screw it.  There isnt one.  So it cant be broken.  Hot dog, not hot dog.
---
Alright, thank you!
---
It’s easy to feel like Scrooge mcduck when you play fo76, since they literally throw em at ya lol
---
I run this route daily. After Watoga train station I walk the tracks to the second set of train cars and hope for the rare bos plan spawn.
---
I don't think you have seen that stuff and are just trying to stir the pot. This is the third post I've seen like this. It's kinda sad
---
Enjoy your safe space, ignorant to legitimate criticism.
---
I had the same disappointment when leveling my VATS rifleman. I acquired my Excavator power armor and drained my only fusion core in a matter of minutes while walking around and not noticing the tremendous drain while using VATS. Like you, I had to store the suit and use it as a taxi until I amassed a large amount of cores. That took quite a while considering my low-level VATS dude didn't have all of the map markers for spots I knew to have frames that might spawn with salvageable cores. That experience was actually what made me start taking note of this issue.
---
Well FO76 is using all of my 6GB VRAM, and about 5GB when downgraded textures one step down from max. And when VRAM runs out moving texture from RAM (or HDD/SSD even) is very slow and tanks performance a lot.
---
VRAM is used not only for textures, but for postprocessing, shadows etc, most of that effects creates additional textures/surfaces to work on.
---
Any one with at least a bit knowledge of how rendering is done nowadays know this. If you do not know this, then I do not believe your words that FO76 lowest shadows is 4 times FO4 ultra shadows. 
---
If you are making joke out of this then you are just a ignorant prick.
---
recycle infant!
---
The queen always kills the bot too quickly. Doesn't matter how much I hurt it, it won't aggro me. 
---
Lol you know this the FO76 forum?  Ubisoft doesn't have anything to do with Bethesda.
---
Probably [All Rise](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/All_Rise)
---
The important thing is that the process Bethesda  used was brilliant in that it targeted dupers without impacting those that were buyers in the ordinary course.    Perhaps their selectivity criteria missed some things this time.  But they will get more accurate each time.  
---
Plus it is possible that they are monitoring identified accounts to see what they do.  This “housecleaning “ did not ban but presumed innocence.   They may be watching unbanned accounts for duping at which point they have a factual basis to ban. 
---
you wanna trade? I need some rolling pins and cutting boards for my swedish chef build!!!
---
That may give you some... Immature protest signs. I would suggest a darksouls style approach where you can pick from a combination of given phrases. 
---
Hahahaha  I just sold one of those to a vendor last week. I'm a melee so it was no use to me. Current level: 68
---
I also read that as a reply to one of my previous topics.
---
But I don't think that to be the cause in this case.  As the vendors that used to have these plans prior to the patch have much shorter inventory lists than other vendors.
---
Namely Camden Park and BOS Phoenix.  With the Power Armor mod plans they list, their vendor lists are easily twice as long as the ones in Watoga Station, Harper's Ferry, Welch (Pretty sure I found my first BoS Mod plan there prior to the patch), etc.
---
[Ahahahaaaaaaaaaaha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OtzJtp-EM)
---
I did 1 mile = 5280 feet * 1000 miles = 5280000 feet, average step is 2.5 feet, 5280000 feet / 2.5 = 2112000 steps then minus 1 step. I'm dumb tho so that's probably wrong and you're right
---
The BOS compact armor comes with a small pouch of makeup for those nights out at the Whitesping ;)
---
the last ban wave they booted everyone with stacks above a certain amount. They didnt prove those people were dupers. 
---
At least do it with keys, this could be problematic with quest items
---
I’ll take one that says “take that mole rat scum” or “leave my crops alone freeloader” lol
---
haha, nice!
---
I've seen a couple. I found a level 10 one really early on in the game.
---
Super interesting. Love the idea!

Map mod.

Go to west tek next to the devils backbone and read some info personally and don’t get bored on a YouTube dude that stretches his words to much

\*Ghoul Slayer's Lever Action Rifle - +30% damage to ghouls
---
&gt;Please don't call for removing what little we have left.
---
They might as well have removed it.  The rewards for powering up events are a joke ever since the last patch added the ONE good thing you could get to vendors, 100% of the time, and for a price even a new character can afford on their first day.
---
And of course that Fusion Generator plan provides enough power to power up the Fusion Core machine at the workshop, a handful of mats and you are up and running.  10 seconds vs 10 (usually longer) minutes of work.
---
Really....What would you be willing to give me to see it first hand?  Look at my past post, I've defended them at every turn.  Make it worth my wild and I'll make you a believer.  
---
I've been gone a little while. How did they get rid of duped weapons?
---
they spawn on Wendigos, in the display cases in the destroyed building across from the Harper's Ferry fast travel point. you can roll the dice for all black powdered weapons at Pricketts Fort
---
It's definitely functioning but I'm not sure if it's in its intended end-state for Fallout 76. At least I hope that's the case and the status quo isn't intended. As it is, I walk around with 20 cores on my VATS toon and I can easily burn through most of them, if not all, in a relatively short gaming session, especially if I decide to join in on a SBQ fight or two.
---
If you want all sunshine and rainbows you're playing the wrong game.  There is still a ton of objective feedback here.  More should be expected from a Dev like Bethesda and the state of this game this far from release is atrocious.  There is a ton of toxicity that is deserved and a ton of it that is childish.  Sticking your head in the sand does nothing to help fix this train wreck.  I love fallout more than any other game series out there and I have played all of them start to finish.  Bethesda has EARNED all of this toxicity. Do I still play? Hell Yes, because its still fallout at heart.  Am I disgruntled consumer? Hell yes as well.
---
Not a bug, he was wearing Sentinel Armor, probably with +Assassin as well but definitely the former.
---
Well comparing number of active subscribers between an old and a fairly new sub is hardly indicative of anything. Especially since the r/fallout sub claims to be representive of all Fallout games, that includes Fallout 76, but they drove everyone interested in FO76 away with their toxicity.
---
Better to look at how many people are actively visiting than subscribers.
---
Fuckin toxic masculinity 
---
I've been through Harper's alot, never had a issue that I noticed there and dropping that low would definitely be noticable.  165hz monitor, but I'm happy as long I'm 60+.  I'll check your guide out better this evening though.
---
 Will buy the lever action definitely mate
---
New Vegas wasn't exactly a bug free launch.
---
I’ve found the biggest issue with prime is people center the nuke on it, and half the nuke zone is out of bounds. If you manually drop about halfway between prime and the other fissure site, you can get the bottom of the nuke zone above the boundary. That maximizes the flux you can pick. One trip around the outskirts of the pink forest grove there is well over 100 violet flux. 
---
Until duped..
---
Been doing the same thing for awhile now, easy pickings and no SBQ or high level adds to deal with if your goal is the flora.  Usually attracts a few lower level players that want a bit of XP, but they usually clear out after a couple minutes after they realize there arn't that many enemies to deal with.
---
Since he was standing still, I would guess Assassin Sentinel armor with Dodgy/Evasive/Serendipity etc. Essentially the player takes no damage. Get a gamma gun and flood him with rads. 
---
I thought about getting that one but then I figured it's not even Halloween anymore
---
I see it at the Harpers ferry vendor fairly often
---
I’m sure the negative comments get old if you like the game but as a consumer you should never want people to stop bitching about a broken game.  The standard for what a AAA release should be, keeps dropping. FO76 set a new low bar. And being positive about a broken game will encourage them to release broken games. 
---
Also this sub was only positive before they totally fucked up 2 patches. Patches that clearly weren’t even playtested. Expecting people not to be angry about that is silly. 
---
Steps above fixed for me. Get the materials from your camps storage and add to your inventory.  Fixed first time. Good luck. 
---
I need my 45 blank holotapes.
---
This purge was aimed at dealing with duped items. I don't know if they have any plans of further persueing dev room items beyond the punishments they dealt out to those who exploited it.
---
You’re just a bum!
---
You can run ingo some shitty people and also run into great people random
---
Really? I've only come across a few ferns, and very few pitcher plants, around that pink forest. Guess I gotta look closer, but I make a habit of going through, and around, it already.
---
Just go grief them on their new live feed 
---
I got to checkpoint. It updated the BOS quest and added another to collect scorchbeast DNA for testing. I left to do that one, finished it, did some other things and then logged off. 
---
Maybe it all needs to be done in one shot but none of the other quests I've done have been that way - as long as you get to a checkpoint.
---
Love mine 
---
yeahh idk how this is going to fly. i think it's going to be just as bad as the Rick and Morty stream, if not worse.
---
i love rick and morty, but man that was a god awful stream.
---
100%
---
Sorry this happened man.
---
 Vats allows you to shoot through objects (like trees), if you use it before the target (you) moves behind it. 
---
Once you're in line of sight, or targeted by Vats, sneaking doesn't work
---
And unfortunately, stacking sentinal armor pieces makes them impervious while standing still.
---
Not bugs or hacks, just exploiting unbalanced legendary perks, and benefitting from the excess of duping for OP armor sets
---
Why are these videos always at dusk?
---
Yup, Todd Howard confirmed that in an interview before release:
---
https://www.pedestrian.tv/gaming/bethesdas-todd-howard-gave-us-the-scoop-on-how-fallout-76-will-work/
---
They decided to improve their loot tables by removing it completely. It's been their philosophy with most things (dialogue, NPCs, etc) 
---
Most high Lvl people would have refused payment from someone so low level.
---
You wouldn't of responded if my words didnt strike home
---
I'll try to give a quick primer without spoiling the story too much but I'll start by saying if this is your first Fallout you should definitely check out the previous games.
---
Super mutants have been around since the original Fallout while the scorched are unique to 76, and you're correct, they both used to be humans.
---
Super mutants are a product of the forced evolutionary virus or FEV. It was created as a joint project between the US government and West-Tek. Initially, it was supposed to be used to improve crop yields to solve the world food shortage but they soon realized the effect it has on humans and the project was changed to attempt to create super soldiers. That part never really panned out as you can see with the super mutants. Check out the West-Tek building and Huntersville for more background info.
---
The scorched are victims of the scorch plague, which is basically that yellow crop dusting the scorchbeasts do. They used to be humans but they're basically becoming petrified from the inside out. Once infected, they become part of a kind of hive mind and attack on behalf of the scorchbeasts. This is basically the entire story of 76 so just do the quests and read the notes and terminals for more info on this. In particular, the Enclave, Responder, and Brotherhood quest lines have a lot of info.

Hello
---
It is no fun.  Stay away from workshops. PVP is extremely unbalanced. You'll find like one "I had fun in pvp" post for every 10 experiences like you just had. Please don't get mad at the other players though, they're just using the game as provided. it's not hacks or cheats, they've simply invested in the correct meta. If anything consider yourself lucky he was using ranged on you so as to give you a chance.
---
No problem, dude.  
---
I've kept that in mind, so if you want, you can just read a bit over this stuff and go to the steps on how to set this up and you're good. If you don't like it, you can still use whatever preset you want and do your Nvidia Panel adjustments how you want again. :)
---
They just could have patched a few of the ones that don't require much work to fix. Also, OW is a rather bad example, because the core mechanics of the game just work. In 76 almost all of the mechanics are broken in at least one major way.
---
Honestly you are better off going to Bethesda’s site and reading the Inside the vault section for updates. In here you are going to get biased opinions on the changes etc 
---
I never understood the cap limit. The first thing I do in ANY other Bethesda game is download a rich vendors mod. Not that the vendors need an insane level of caps but somewhere in the ballpark of 1000-1500 would work. I haven’t played Fallout 76 since like a week after release because after around 60 hours it’s just glorified inventory management. 
---
Ok, I kind of assumed that 100 was a clip. 
---
Don't why I'm getting downvoted for a question or inquiry?
---
Just a safe bet is to count about 10secs if unsure if it will blow up. 
---
eh it just really depends where u stand with in game items id guess, even if youre high level you could be low on chems :)
---
Next patch, which from what I know is next week has another 200 stash increase. I'd say wait till then. 
---
Find a player that sells mutations... they usually change like 200 per... wipe all of your mutations and buy back the ones you want.  Would be cheaper than the 2500-5000 you were already willing to spend.
---
&gt;deep pocketed
---
 deep pocketed torso / chest, and not just  pocketed ? vendors in wtaoga has the  pocketed mod almost every time i go there, it's 60 caps...
---
"The code works on \*MY* system.  Ask the sysadmin why his environment isn't configured correctly."
---
   -Developer
---
Yep, and interestingly, not all AWS region is used on this game (lived in South-East Asia, got connected to Sydney AWS server instead of Singapore)
---
left on the D-Pad switches you to another weapon. so you can have a long range and close quarters weapon and switch easily between the two. 
---
They removed most duped items yesterday, just let everyone keep one copy to prevent removing items people got by trading.
---
Yeah, what happens when someone decides to put racist shit on their sign? Bang. Idea killed.
---
Unless of course you can only pick precanned messages, but that's not the same thing.
---
It's a learn to play issue really. You can stagger or use Radium Rifle/Gamma gun. I've been one shotted by a supersledge also.  Though I didn't have Blocker equipped and I have a low health build. You can also wait for them to move. If you rush in like CoD you're obviously going to lose. Use stealth, chameleon, etc. Tactics.
---
Haven't run PA with a stealth mod yet so I can't speak directly to that level of sneak and durability, most of what I have seen and test is armorless or weightless Chameleon.
---
But either way, ranged PvP with bait is a pretty well known strategy. It's just that melee requires much less investment and effort, which is why it's talked about more. And it's easier to do without bait.
---
Want to enjoy growing your character but can't because of these plans which cost 5,000 - 15,000 caps and you can only obtain a few hundred per day?  Awww shucks, well... keep searching around and maybe you'll find cap stashes with a whopping 80 caps stored.
---
10-20 years later, you might just be able to afford that piano you always wanted.
---
Have fun!
---
This comment needs much more love, I'd love to read some in game books.
---
You could have comics, guidebooks from both post and pre war, newspaper articles and folk tales.
---
I added another video. I had pacifist mode on initially, and he literally melted me in like three shots as if I wasn't even in pacifist mode at all. Wasn't contesting the workshop or anything. He's definitely cheating
---
Of course. Haha  
---
Hm, maybe you haven't found the dreaded spot yet then. xD  
---
My friend I'm playing with is on a 1070 and we both still have nightmares of a couple of places. lmao  
---
Might also be becuase I've got my overlay enabled at all times. Gotta do maintenance constantly cus watercooled. \*sigh\*  
---
And nice. You can sure try them out. You will definitely notice a big difference performance-wise, that's for sure. :)
---
Stagger him first.  
---
*has 83* pfft rookie
---
Use melee. It’s better.
---
lol, the Overseer doesn't know nothin bout min-maxing and phat loot!
---
Nothing masculine about crying like a girl on the internet....
---
I got an instigating the dragon on xb1 if anyone’s interested 
---
WTB too. Dont have thousands, though.
---
You're obviously not reading what I've said and you make the perfect case of what we don't really want to see anymore. No one's sticking their head in the sand, we're trying to enjoy what we have and still acknowledge there are multiple issues, it's not all puppy dog kisses and warm hugs, friend. But the mindset of "Bethesda has EARNED all of this toxicity" is why people are leaving in droves. No, they didn't EARN toxicity, it's a fucking video game. The community managers in here are SHIT on by redditors and frankly its embarrassing representation of the community, you just don't talk to people like that. period. After seeing the cancer that is this subs negativity I've reached out to the community managers and praised them for the composure they have given the shit that people say behind a keyboard. 
---
There's a much better way of presenting your complaints to the company in a constructive manner, but each of you have been given a soapbox and you all think your opinion matters the most. Which is fine, go ahead and use it all you want, but you're not going to influence change because no one's going to pay attention to your rude, toxic shit. The filthy sub exists for a reason, the people who don't want to hear the crap that goes on in here, like you are a revolutionary that's going to inspire change, both Destiny 1 and The Division took years to polish and were incredibly fun afterwards. The same thing will have to happen here. 
---
Can you kill the moth man? I see him from time. If I shoot or get too close he just disappears...
---
no, initially he was cheating. I had pacifist mode on, and he was able to shoot through my health even with pacifist mode as if I didn't have it on at all. I added video proof now that I have pacifist mode on and he just melt through my health. He's definitely a serial cheater because he's not even using the workshop he's waiting for people to come, and melting anyone that comes by
---
Thanks. I will try it again.
---
You can find a relatively low-leveled one in Helvetia, in a small wooden shack along with a Civil War Era Suit/Hat and a short hunting rifle.
---
Yellowcake is never a prob. It's definitely very common around Whitesprings, and there's a fair amount around Prime. And I rarely need it for anything. Only violet seems to be hard to keep in stock.
---
Quests and Events need to reward a lot more caps for completion. Its a really kick in the pants when not only does it cost caps to fast travel to start an event, some events have you fetching items from the other side of the map. so you could spend 100+ caps fast travelling for a 40 cap reward. and The free states quest chain, seriously? who thought that was good. back and forth back and forth. I probably spend hundreds of caps on fast travel for that quest to get a couple of caps on completion.
---
^
---
This seems rather accurate. 
---
Latest patch allows this serial cheater to kill people even though they have pacifist mode on. [He literally three shots me with a TSE rifle even though I have pacifist mode on and he should do no damage to me](https://youtu.be/K8L8G0vFL64). ridiculous how these cheaters are stealing caps from everyone and using Game breaking bugs to get ahead in the game. Really sad
---
Workshops enable PvP, whether you have pacifist mode or not.
---
Focusing completely on negatives and ignoring positives is the exact opposite of objective feedback.   ... but whatever you guys need to tell yourselves to feel better about your emo attitudes....
---
Hell, make it a quest line that ultimately allows you to "invest" in each factions' vendor(s) and boost the cap limit by 1000-2000 (or maybe a range based of the level of the character when the complete the quest line?) caps for the character that completes the quest. Improves QOL *and* gives another something to do in the game.
---
Hahaha I spent so long trying to get one just to realize the handmade RIFLE doesn’t benefit from any of my RIFLEman perks so I didn’t want it anymore and gave it to the first person that invited me to a party :P
---
Wellllll we already have neon letters and metal letters so if immature people want to plaster their camps in racist epithets, they don't need protest signs to do it.
---
cool. I won't be on until later tonight.. 9 or 10PM eastern, or will most likely be on over the weekend. let me know what works
---
Are you mostly melee build then I'm assuming?
---
Nope. In the right build, the supposed slap damage is massive. If he is Bloodied or AA, he can kill you in Pacifist mode. 
---
Lol no, it’s called having extra stuff and being nice. You should try it sometime
---
Gold for you!
---
This sub is literally a circle-jerk for people too miserable to not complain constantly.....
---
Tigers wood 
---
Fair
---
if you're high level you probably have wasted/got for free cards for "Pharma pharma"  so just do one or two runs around hospitals. this is far more efficient than taking scraps from a lvl 24. -\\\_(ツ)_/-   
---
(not that they're any worse it's just that they probably have more need for them)
---
That's not true! They enable PVP if you are trying to take it. if you are just walking by, with pacifist mode on, they should not be able to do any damage to you. if I walk up into someone else's base and try to claim it, then that initiates PVP whether or not I have pacifist mode on. Which I was not trying to do as you can clearly see in the video. I had pacifist mode on and was simply walking through like normal. 
---
There’s a great mod out there that helped me with my problem with being over encumbered all the time.   The mod breaks down the weight of each category of items that weighting you down.  When you can easily know what each category weighs it’s super easy to manage it.  I think the mod is call Better Inventory.  It can be found on the Nexus mod website.  Just google it if you aren’t familiar with it.  
---
How is anything I’ve said rude or toxic?  I certainly feel I made my point very respectfully. 
---
Go to filthy casuals.  It's the real F076 sub... this one is literally just a crybaby circle-jerk.
---
Pacifist doesnt stop you from taking damage.. you just cant do initial damage to people. Workshops trigger pvp. Not sure how this is cheating lol
---
I would always look at the the number of subs when I would come to this subreddit. The highest I have seen was 171,XXX. It never reached 172 000.(as far as I remember) so I would say the number is closer to 1500 subs lost. 
---
if I had leverage with the powers that be, this would go straight to the top of the NEXT pile. Well Done!
---
Didn't know there was a glowing variant of the Mothman, that's pretty cool. I've only encountered a stalking Mothman (red eyes) and a vengeful Mothman (yellow eyes). A couple of each. I think I've only been able to kill the vengeful version because the red eyed ones always fly away before they die.
---
NO IT'S TOXIC MASCULINITY!
---
STOP SAYING "CRYING LIKE A LITTLE GIRL"
---
THAT IS A SEXIST PHRASE.
---
ALSO FO76 IS FLAWLESS. 
---
I use the gatling plasma so I got to do a stock pile run here and there.
---
But yeah the violet is a pain to get
---
Wow that fucking broken as shit 
---
And if you're selling the water for RL money, you don't really care that you can't take on more caps.
---
Wasnt me but I used to live in whitesprings and had excavator armor weilded a supersledge and had a very similar experience of helping someone complete a quest there.
---
Ask Bethesda to release the data?
---
They won't. It'd look bad if they released charts showing their game was dying.
---
Just another reason it wasn't on steam. 
---
I also wish the signs were highly customizable as well.  The custom text mod would be too hilarious.
---
I also wish that we could actually mod them into deadly weapons as well (don't know if that is already possible or not as I haven't messed with them much)
---
Good, maybe some of the assholes are gone.
---
I'll have to check my BoS mod description... but there were some misc mods that gave rad/energy resistance.  Leaded or Asbestos?  Maybe they were modded on their too?
---
&gt;Heavy Combat Armor with Brotherhood Of Steel. Looks great I'm pleased with it, cosmetically if not protection wise.
---
What do you mean "if not protection wise"?  BoS Modded Heavy Combat is like... best DR in the game.
---
For me, the one that sometimes spawns outside Charleston station always disappears.   All others have tried to kill me. 
---
Iron Fist: Max damage for little perk investment.
---
I'm a big fan of the Glowing Mothman. This yellow eyes vengeful one took the crown for me last night though. Very majestic. 
---
All rifle. 
---
Hey, I just finished watching the video.  
---
Don't get me wrong if you're a fan of his but there is quite a bit of misinformation in the video but his settings are cool. His video is nicely made as well.
---
I personally think you're bashing the wrong settings if you'll set it up this way though like he does. The main issue is the draw distance, not the quality settings.
---
We are trying to get the GPU usage to work, not just get high fps. Unfortunately you weren't able to see that in his video. 
---
I've already tried setting all quality settings to low and leaving the draw distance as it is but that still bottlenecked me like crazy, so that's all I can tell you. XD
---
This is true, so there should be no issue to allowing customizable signs
---
You are proving my point. You are calling me a troll because I disagree with you.
---
If you take a workshop your are flagged for pvp. Its a huge risk to take one. 
---
I read on these forums they do that hoping you'll quit the trade and emoj them, then they hop on and start trading. I had someone do the same to me last night. but I ignored them and continued trading 
---
If you hoarded before and don't plan to change then you'll run into the same problem.
---
They are increasing stash size but anyone who hoards will fill out then overencumber themselves regardless.
---
I always fine this request an odd one, because I have almost run out of things to buy... I need more goldsinks, not more vendor caps! Haha.
---
&gt; The issue is the “kiss asses” seek to shut down conversations. 
---
^^ What is this?
---
if it adds rad resist u will see that on the left side in info even b4 adding the mod
---
This might be the best thread I've seen on here in months...
---
Consider your petition signed =P
---
You can also find an scorched variant of the mothman, I think they also have yellow eyes...
---
All of us Filthy Casuals can back the statement that the lack of subs here and growth in FilthyCasuals is because of the toxicity in this sub/ crybaby circle-jerk.  Every 5th filthy casual makes a new thread when they subscribe celebrating the existence of filthycasuals and lamenting how ***spectacularly awful*** this sub is if you want to do anything other than complain.
---
FilthyCasuals is the real Fallout 76 sub.
---
It's always nice when we players help each other out of a tight spot.  That's one of my favourite parts of the game. It's so much more satisfying than griefing and ripping each other off. 
---
same here, hopefully a lot of the PVP players will leave the current servers.  
---
Now who is being toxic and rude?  You assume I am a person who has made any comments one way or another.  If you did a little research before you post youd realize i dont have many posts one way or another.  What I am is a grown ass man with a Job who likes to spend some free time playing video games, and when I buy a video game for $60 ($200 in my case) I expect it to be on par with other AAA Devs.  Anything less than that the Dev should be held accountable for.  Do community managers get crapped on? Sure they do but they are the face of Bethesda here on reddit and the anger is directed at the Dev, not them.
---
Yep. A buddy killed me in three blows with an AA power fist when we were messing around. I was in Pacifist nowhere near a workshop in my power armor. 
---
Wish I could agree... after half a loop around whitesprings I started getting the loot load bug.... Solo I'm fine, but as soon as someone gets in the area I start having to wait about 3mins per corpse per person in the area.
---
I'm sorry that this affected you on such a level.  This sounds like it was very painful for you.
---
Hey, no reason to get cunty.
---
Ouch.  Can we get u/He_Attacks_Again_ some ice?  That shit's 3rd degree!
---
I feel like you're not being truthful or at least not accurate with this post?
---
I think the line for that is gonna be hella long.
---
Tons of times.  
---
lol. I've still yet to find the job postings for all these supposed shilling jobs. Crazy thought... hear me out here. It could just be an easy method to not have to consider other opinions exist and could possibly be valid. 
---
Unfortunately, I had to stop playing the game before I could find a fix. Hopefully, you find something soon though! 
---
This sub is dying fast. It also not the fault of redditors. Its FO76 failing to deliver over and over again. Every patch is another slap in the face. They make changes that are unecessary and they wait to improve QOL till half the players leave.
---
Tagging as also wondering. Only seen it twice. 
---
No cheating, no bugs.
---
- pacifist mode only stops your damage, not theirs. It prevents you from flagging so you take slap damage but that doesn't matter because
---
- workshops are about pvp. Whether you are pacifist or not if he contests your workshop he no longer does slap damage.
---
- your video shows a sentinel vats user.
---
Welcometo REAL fo76 pvp. 
---
Pacifist only stops you from damaging them, not them from damaging you.  It stops you from accidentally initiating PVP.
---
Owning a workshop still allows them to easily kill you.  It's quite easy to miss the message if they just quickly try to capture it and then walk away.  They then can hunt you down on the map and pop you.
---
Yeah, something doesn't sound right there.  I generally play 4 to 5 hours a day and have been using the same 20 cores for close to a week now.  For yours to be draining that quickly there has to be some kind of bug at play, I'd think.
---
I don’t use these mutations due to the Instigating weapons I use, but this is an actual strategy to kill people. All you have to do is slash at someone with every mutation. If they click revenge, you can find their base and destroy it without a bounty (provided that you don’t kill the person who clicked revenge on you)
---
Only if we could have pictures as well. Flashbacks to conscientious objector from TF2.
---
That's not true.
---
The workshop overrides slap damage
---
Would it be possible to take this guy down with a massive field of mines?
---
New account created around the last patch controversy, super active since then, same pattern of posting of other shill posts. I'm think I'm safe!
---
I unfortunately didn't notice much of a difference.. i don't encounter disconnects or crashes, but it has been quite laggy/stutters since early December. I have the nagging feeling that it may be something I installed at that time, but don't want to go through the process of figuring out which one it is :(
---
What you experienced definitely seems off in how he was able to kill you since you say he wasn't contesting the workshop, but there's been no evidence to support anyone can legitimately do massive slap damage. Actually, there was a video floating around here within the past week or so where someone tested OP builds and showed that no matter what their damage was the slap was always a very small amount of damage.
---
Thanks for posting about this issue. I've been experiencing the same VATS drain while in power armor and wrote a new post in the hopes of getting this issue seen and addressed, and I've included a link to your post within it:

---
I met a nice ghoul last night.
---
Workshop flags you for pvp if they attempt to take it.  If they kill you and don't take it, just tap it... then they can continue to tap it and kill you.
---
This is literally a way people farm caps... by abusing the workshop system to kill you repeatedly.  
---
Also, be sure you respawn, and not "seek revenge" when killed.  It auto flags you as an enemy regardless of pacifist mode.
---
Nah, pvpers unsubbed from this constant crying a long time ago.  Bet I get downvoted by your people and you get upvoted by yours.   Lol 
---
a mistake you can only make twice in the quest for... ??
---
I just want to be able to sell all my worthless ammo. That’s all I ask. Even for half a cap a bullet. It just takes up so much space.
---
I havent been rude or toxic at all.  I feel I respectfully stated my opinion on the matter.  What you dont seem to understand is that while yes its a video game, it is still a product that is sold by a company to make a profit.  That product should be and is held to some fashion of a standard.  When that standard is not met you get what we have here, unfortunate as it is.
---
in 180 levels, I found 1.
---
Ive noticed this too though im pretty sure its a glitch. The text seems fitting so the combat armor can match the marine armor for endgame (marines rad resist is glitched too last i checked)
---
So itll probably be something they silently fix over the next month or two whenever they get around to the marine armor

It's a learn to play issue really. You can stagger or use Radium Rifle/Gamma Gun. I've been one shotted by a Super Sledge also. Though I didn't have Blocker equipped and I have a low health build. You can also wait for them to move. If you rush in like CoD you're obviously going to lose. Use stealth, chameleon, etc. Tactics. Also build defenses for your workshop. There are a lot of traps in the game for that purpose.
---
Unless they make it a quest item, in which case it cannot be traded or dropped.  So dupe all you want......
---
Maybe if you claim a workshop, pvp is enabled? Idk.  You still can be killed even in pacifist mode. Its odd that he killed you in 3 shots.

&gt; It’s seriously a cesspool of toxic bullshit. Personally, I never lost faith in Bethesda, and I still haven’t. I’m having fun with the game, but I’d like more content, and that’s on the horizon now too. I have no complaints outside of the community that’s impossible to please.
---
This is the shit that great copypastas are made of. And I thought people were exaggerating when they complained about Bethesda bootlickers but holy smokes, they really do exist!
---
He's opinion is pretty good.
---
However, looking at his history, pretty sure it's a shill account.
---
Outlevel is still somewhat of an issue, but anything that isn’t Whitesprings is virtually abandoned.
---
A few bugs were fixed
---
Guns are absolute fucking Garbo. Even the pool cue is better.
---
I've only seen. That bug rarely, but I've seen it. I present the map marker is wrong, thusly, the incorrect cap amount and fast travel failing.
---
Pacifist mode is just as it sounds you're a pacifist doesn't mean other people work kill you, and a workshop contest enables pvp for like 10 minutes. Also if he didn't capture it he can just keep contesting it to force you into PvP to kill you over and over again.
---
It's enabled if the other player tries to capture it.  Even for a moment (and then walks away).
---
Well, another super new and insanely active account. Interesting! 
---
This is why I play still. I’ve generally found other players to be super helpful and just all around nice compared to other games.
---
Oh this bothers me so muc.
---
H. On my first character I was clumsy and picked up multiple key cards and quest items and now they are locked in my inventory. 
---
I was more careful on my second character keeping a clean pristine inventory, carefully reading each key making sure I didn't have it. 
---
Until one day the servers crashed in the middle of me joining the army and now I have 2 Timmy's terminal passwords I can't delete. I stare at the stack of 2 items haunting my perfect inventory. 
---
Also not that if you have the unstable mutation or the other explosion one and have passive on and they can hit ya till it triggers. thus you have attacked them agreeing to PvP.
---
Why doesn't that apply to other subs that have a net-gain of subs rather than a net-loss?
---
Hahaha, OP should definitely subscribe. No criticizing Bethesda? Perfect! 
---
cry moar noob

---
Did you know that you can just kite them over towards the pool area, jump over the wall, and a bunch of bags full of junk will spawn where all the low level players are hiding. (just a joke, don't hate me)
---
Sorry to hear you had some problems.
---
Pacifist only means you don't damage other people. 
---
Workshops are PvP, as soon as you take one you're voluntarily enabling PvP. If he didn't take it, and contested it again while you walking by, you were in PvP again.
---
I have lots of issues with PvP and griefing, but that doesn't seem to be what happened here.
---
Dumbass
---
Yeah, its weird how some plans are extremely rare for some, and the only thing youll see for others.
---
For example, I still havent learned ultralight combat limbs, but ive learned it for every other armor type (both limbs and torsos). 
---
(Pre patch 5) watoga station and super duper mart had those ultralight marine limbs 24/36 and 18/36 visits, respectively.
---
I have had a bloodied melee build hit me in Pacifist mode and do massive damage with each blow. Same with an AA power fist with swing speed. 
---
Yeah I could get down with something like that. You had me at, another something to do on the game ..
---
Lol. That would be so funny to hear someone on voice chat say 'Ok everyone, I launched this nuke so this is MY nuke zone. Yes, I own it and I'm in charge. So here are my rules, if you don't like them LEAVE. First of all, no raiders allowed. If someone gets killed, no stealing the bag. Second rule, if I get knocked down, everyone needs to pay attention to me so they can stim me since I am the VIP here. You over there with the camo PA and gatling laser, you're in charge of attacking the SBQ wings so it stays on the ground. After the nuke zone ends, everyone gives me all their loot and I decide what I keep and what I don't want."
---
It works with them. 5% -&gt; 8%.
---
BOS Heavy Combat Armor *crafted* no stars or legendary effects.
---
280-DR 416-ER 0-RR with Grounded +100ER Scaly Skin +50-DR +50-ER
---
T-51b 
---
632-DR 641-ER 348-RR naked
---
So unless the enemies are weak I stay in PA. I was hoping to be able to live in standard armor but I kept being killed unless I spammed stimpacks. It's probably my play style or something I'm doing wrong. But those BOS stats don't seem that impressive to be top of line.
---
OP “hasn’t lost faith” in Bethesda and is upset that others do not share his zealotry.
---
no I think that's bullshit. People have been asking for PVE servers. Some of us do not want to participate in this stupid horseshit. it's not a learn to play issue. It's a learn what players actually want. Some of us don't want to have our game play disrupted and B crafts by other people who are just literally assholes and trying to make people annoyed or steal their money through illegitimate means....
---
People aren't sick of the game, they are sick of whiners like you, so they go to FilthyCasuals and continue playing the game.  Duh.
---
Sentinel/assassin legendary effects are a thing.
---
Anyone who pvps for sport will run a set of it. Mix in some perks and they'll seem invincible
---
 Yeah, since it should have in-game effects (ie. Camo). I agree.
---
Crying like a baby on the internet is downvoted here.
---
It is not -your- workshop. 
---
It is a pvp staging area you can temporarily claim and gather resources from but it is not yours.  It doesn't matter if you are in an event, drinking a nuka cola or playing a drum solo, once you claim a workshop you are in PVP mode. Everywhere you go - everything you do - still in PVP.  Pacifist keeps you from damaging other players but once you enter pvp it does nothing for you.  He was doing full damage while you were hitting back with slap.
---
He wasn't cheating, this isn't a bug and you were not prepared.
---
Always be the player you want to encounter. Pay it forward and help others, even if it’s giving plans, recipes, and older gear to those who might need it.
---
I mean, ya... if you compare Heavy Combat to POWER ARMOR it will come up lower.  But for non-PA... Heavy Combat with BOS mod is tops.
---
Hell yeah!
---
I think he was just exploiting a bug. I literally went away for 20 minutes and came back with pacifist mode on and he's still able to 3 shot me. 
---
Even after the whole "Bethesda Plz" rule was implemented it still feels like it's the same 6 posts recycled here daily.
---
I'm still staying subbed in case there's new news, but there isn't much being offered to entice people to come back frequently.
---
You’re not running something right, I have 715-705 without PA.
---
Is your armor poorly leveled or not double repaired?
---
All normal. Watoga robots are buggy because they are technically hostile until you complete the quest...they still target the Vendor. Super mutants and other horde types can spawn anywhere, all random and a small chance, but it happens. I've been in WhiteSprings golf course and had Robot horde come pouring out multiple times.
---
Thank you for this; i'm going to try your medium custom preset suggestions. I found the game to be very smooth on my pc during beta and the first few weeks of launch (medium settings), but something happened for me in December and even with an upgraded vid card (gtx 970 to a 1060 6gig), AND using low presets, its still laggy/not smooth. I have a feeling its some video editor/photo editor that i installed during that time (i hope it isn't b/c i need to use them lol)
---
you yourself just said they deserve it, that's just as bad as contributing to it, you're encouraging it. 
---
The product IS held to a standard, it just does not meet YOUR standard, the standards of OTHERS. And while the company who is responsible is making efforts to correct it, redditors who in some way or form feel that they are privileged because they, like the rest of us shell out money (or get mommy and daddy to shell out money) and their time, their opinion should be held higher although the FO76 body is a small fraction of the entire world in the game. It's stupid, it's literally a chihuahua that barks and nips non stop, just chill the fuck out instead of getting so fired up over a video game you DON'T have to dedicate your life to it. There ARE others out there, you know. 
---
I changed it so it doesn't say it's a game-breaking bug anymore. Don't know what you're trying to prove by linking that. this post is more along the lines of me saying that it's broken, and it's bullshit and people don't really like it. Who the fuck actually enjoys this shit?
---
The only reason I ever came to Reddit was Fallout 4. I, like you, mostly stuck to dedicated forums. But between my desire to discuss Fallout 4 and the rumor that DICE was paying more attention to Reddit than they own forums I decided to open an account here. 
---
This attitude has plagued the game since launch. 
---
Unless you provide proof i don't believe you and others shouldn't either.
---
I just saw a thread where the guy had a quest that said "your workshop is under attack" and he thought since he was in pacifist mode the player shouldn't have hurt him.....and he considered the guy a cheater
---
Lemme guess, I'm a "pAiD sHiLl FrOm BeThEsDa"  .... that almost never posts in Fallout related subs.  LMAO.   
---
I Wish scorched would come after me while farming, I need  more hardened masses/high rad fluids.
---
Level 37 and found (and scrapped) 2 or 3 of those
---
Exactly I got some extra items in areas without ways to Sell Them, Give Them Away or Scrap Them and I fought to win them. Am I expected to walk away from a horde after beating them and not pick stuff up? I don’t pick up everything yet if I get good weapons and nobody is around it’s wasted leaving it. I just wish Beth would let me fast travel like them have in every other FO game. 
---
In Watoga at the train station, Fort Defiance, and Brotherhood vendor location I consistently drop 40mm grenades, missles, ammo in storable areas for players. I don’t ask for anything, I just drop and go.
---
I’m not a duper and don’t carry around that kind of stuff. I just believe in taking my winnings. So please let me travel without taking forever to walk from one area to another.
---
I've done it 3-4 times now with pretty solid results, but I don't know how to trigger it. If I see it on the map I travel to it and hope there is enough time to complete it.
---
Math is pretty hard huh? I mean if you multiple the 59,000 subs on r/fallout by 3 you get 177,000.. which is pretty well in the ball park of the number of subs here.
---
There was one dealing with raider rose
---
I had to swim a lot to find the key
---
Turns out I was going the wrong way but it was still pretty cool
---
I may pickup aqua just to try it again
---
My camp is in the white springs mountains to the east so I personally hit white springs bunker the Charleston station and the kill that Grafton momster and hit a few cap stashes at the power plant. Fast travel back to camp the top of the world station. Harper's fairy then watago.
---
Giggity giggity 😁
---
What were the names?  They tend to correspond to eye color (glowing mothman = green, wise = purple etc).  I have a hard time telling colors in a nuke zone sadly.
---
I had that happen to me with BoS quest line yesterday. Had finished, got my untracite and combat armor. Game rolled the quest all the way back to the damned DMV.
---
“BUILD THE WALL”
---
Check Wallace. He has it a lot. No legendary variants however.
---
Explicitly explain how me listing those facts is "crying" lmaooooo 
---
Seems YOU'RE the one who's upset. :) 
---
Lol, your last comment is complaining about the game and how it earned toxicity, smart guy.   Keep crying and getting offended when called out, I'll keep laughing.
---
I have no idea.  I was just joking and making a reference to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqp25s/im_not_quitting_the_game_im_quitting_this_sub/eghtq86/).
---
See, I went to that location before the quest at around level 30 and took all the cards in a hope to maybe skip that step. I came back later at a higher level (so I can get a good All Rise) and had to take all the cards again.... now I have a couple hundred i think. 
---
Deflated balls should be good too. Morgantown HS GYM
---
Someone is bound to draw a penis tho...
---
...because they aren't facts and you are crying like a girl.  Next.
---
The last one I saw a double nuke the SBQ didn't take any damage from it. I'm assuming that was the plan in launching 2 of them.
---
You are exactly correct, and look at how he is reacting. He is showing how polarized he is, and proving the point of your original topic.
---
Well, considering that you created the account around the launch and has been hoarding karma insanely since then (4.5k). Yeah, seems so.
---
Interesting answer as well.
---
Healing factor seems inconsistent to me, at best. Then again, it's better than nothing ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Lmao no it's not it's the place where mentally weak people go and seek out a safe space because they're too pathetic to handle differing opinions.
---
Reported
---
The Combat Helmet, Army Helmet, Fire Breathers helmet, &amp; Marine Tactical helmet all have slots that imply they can be modded, but I haven't seen any mods for them yet, I think Gas Masks, and Rad suits also have the slot.
---
Hmm Checking....
---
I don’t understand why folks think they can reason with griefers
---
Just logging off and server hop.
---
I’m getting lots of random CTD also. Tried it all; and Bethesda haven’t been a help. Just keep directly me to the same support page. 
---
Might give these settings a try; even though my system isn’t struggling at all. Could be some setting somewhere not playing well.
---
Like bullet debris in Fallout 4 always CTD for me with the Titan V card.
---
You shoot a pellet at high velocity, but the damage is still dealt by the pellet, can't go more ballistic than this. 
---
you achieve that around 18 Char w/ either grape mentats or T3 hard bargain.
---
Tbh no.
---
In the last few weeks I've been unlocking marine mods, so rubber is in short supply. It's everywhere, but it's just tiny amounts. There is no "hub" like one of the schools for plastic.
---
Your best bet is to hit Camden, that fishing shack with a boat N of nuka plant, fairgrounds, grafton and morgantown HS and whitesprings.
---
Hate to disappoint you, but you done got upvoted. Suck on that! I hope it’s delicious yet doesn’t give you cavities!
---
Life preservers give 2 rubber and 1 plastic.  The river rides place on the west side of the map has 15 or so preservers
---
Look at my comments, stalker.  I don't talk about Fallout on reddit.     Explain that, no-nuts.
---
I went and unlock plans on the vendors. They finally have cap sinks and you guys are still complaining. Got all the plans in whitesprings for camp finally. Unlocking all the power armor plans currently, it eats up a lot of caps. Vendor limits only affect sub 50 or unoptimized builds who can't farm efficiently. When you buy plans too you can get some of it back from the vendor. Unyielding set with charisma if possible and daytripper brings the prices down so you can make even more caps during the unlocks. Anyone who can farm can make a lot of caps, this thread is just full of complaining like usual.
---
i can agree with you and i've been a fellow filthy for a while now. I just dont like making statements of fact that i cant back up by direct evidence. 
---
The base gun is a pistol, and you can mod it to be whatever you want mostly. 
---
God yes.
---
I forget what it's called exactly, but in the Raider questline there's a part where you need to loot components to craft a signal booster.
---
My main has almost forty of one of those components, just sitting there inertly, taunting me every time I look through the inventory.
---
Why are you using power armor at all on a rifle build?
---
Bump. Go an read bethesda 
---
There’s 553k subs on r/fallout though. What the fuck are you talking about?
---
Wrong.  It's the fallout sub with a "No snowflake bitches" rule.
---
It's on their list of things to come.
---
Would be nice of that DR/ER/RR number on the Chassis actually reflected the items in it as well.
---
Currently I use an Atom Shop paint on my non-Excavator just to distinguish between the two I carry.
---
Hells to the yes! Dropping Arty on them is the best. Arty on Red Rocket mega stop or any of the big car lots is amazing. Or chaining the Whitespring car line on the drive. 
---
If you truly think toxicity is something they earned, that's a very fucked up mindset.
---
Your "objective" feedback can be presented in a constructive way or it can go straight back to where the sun don't shine. Don't be an entitled dipshit.
---
Lol I was going to mention that I might get upvotes just to be proven wrong but decided against it xD 
---
People get tired of drama posts, when it's one two or three it's popcorn, but when it's several a day it just makes people want to leave
---
This post will likely become a breeding ground for people to fight each other with. Each side explaining to the other why they think they’re right
---
Look for mushrooms, they have a helpful glow that will help you spot them among the trees and in the ditches.
---
They did say that people who had duped items removed got a second pass to remove nuka colas in [this post. ](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/322679/duped-items-removed-feb-14-2019) 
---
Not sure about your situation, but their script should passed you over, unless you were already a known super. 
---
Not accusing, just passing the info along. 
---
Direct quote from link above:
---
“Additionally, if a player had multiple copies of duped items removed as part of today’s actions, we also performed a follow-up search of their account for very large amounts of Nuka-Cola and removed those, as well.”
---
Yeah it’s weird, I never found ferns until I started looking. Around the bases of pine trees, especially if there are clumps of trees, you’ll usually find several ferns. Turn on you PA light, they glow purple in it when close. I do a big loop around the outside of the forest checking clumps of trees and find a ton of violet, always far more than I can craft. Oh and use green thumb of course. 
---
 "workshop"   
---
That's your problem right there. Workshops are PVP they have a big popup that warns you when you take one over every time. 
---
Calm down, buddy, no reason for getting cunty. Hope you have a fine evening in whatever PR company you work for!
---
Workshops are PvP zones by design. Yes some people are assholes. That's why I am trying to help you, so if it happens again you will be more prepared to defend yourself.
---
And that is the problem that I am raising. :(
---
Maybe we need to host a 24 hour burying of the hatchet. Like an anti-purge or something.
---
I do plans and recipes
---
I really doubt they'll look into this but hopefully - its a real bad issue with VATS based builds.
---
Hammah ov de Godzzz
---
i thought i was going crazy; i have a VATS specced guy, and decided i needed fusion cores to stay alive. Picked up atleast 7 which i thought was way too much. Next time i looked, i only had 2.
---
You have ironclad on?
---
&gt;"FaLlOuT iS nOt ToTaL GaRbAgE" = "fO76 iS fLaWlEsS"
---
This is true but I begged the question doesn’t the server still have to acknowledge all those objects are there? Since they have weight, other values, and can be picked up
---
You probably just need 5k to buy all the serums you want and redo them. 
---
Results:  Checked settings and it was at Ultra - woops (deleted prefs.ini after the last patch due to widescreen issues, didn't adjust graphics). Ticked it down to Medium and put shadow distance to low. I see no visible difference in graphics, no degradation or lesser quality. High density areas like Enclave still get hit with framerate, but I think the only real solution at that point is a new card, not mine pushing 3 years old.
---
I'm sad to say the the purge only included the top 400 duped weapons/armor combos and left 1 copy of each behind. Which was follow by a purge of their Nuka Cola but only if their duped weapons armor was deleted first. None of the other items were included in the purge so they get to keep their Aid, bobble heads, junk. plans, etc for now. 
---
that's not entirely true, they still provide power to nearby shops so they're not **completely** pointless.
---
Now who's the one being a toxic baby?  The only reason that sub exists is because like minded pussies needed it because different opinions about a historically bad game is just too much to handle lol
---
I’ve got the same problem. Says it’s on the counter but it’s not. Can’t finish this quest without it.
---
I do to , but they all have the same symbol designation for nuka cola, BOS , blackbird , tricentennial etc it’s all the same when painted , I use multiple armors and it’s a nightmare taking them all out when time is essential,lol. Is that fix scheduled  for this next patch ?
---
Claiming a workshop opens you up for pvp. 
---
Once you're open for pvp they can hit you for full damage. 
---
Pacifist doesn't affect others, it affects you. Pacifist = you choose not to deal damage to other players. What they think about that? Well, some will kill and teabag you regardless.
---
I get that with 3 Char, Hard Bargain, &amp; Grape mentats, for some reason, Total Charisma doesn't seem to play into Vendor prices.
---
What’s your gamer tag 
---
Seriously. No one can find that much junk in one prime nuke.  And why would OP have processed flux while fighting sb queen?
---
Holy crap, now I know why one of my characters keeps burning through fusion cores incredibly fast. I only use power armor on him for irradiated zones and jumping off of tall things, but he's a VATS build. One SBQ fight and I can burn through 10 cores in just that one engagement.
---
Going to Harper's prior to Enclave is a bit of a waste cause you can hit Camp Venture on your Harper's trip to turn in the pretty much guaranteed Tech Data and then grab the armor/weapon/mod plans in Venture.
---
Yeah, I know that most people don't have basic understanding of how PvP and workshops works and call everyone a cheater, a lot of people called me that way too.  
---
But I do almost only PvP from the Beta, level 220 with 500+ hours on my main and know every build/gear meta relevant.  
---
I met people with hacks multiple times, one time there was one guy who could teleport on the head of everyone and then become invisible with the animations and sounds of the Mothman...  
---
Also, this game never had any anticheat system in the first months, a lot of people were capable of doing almost everything with the cheat engine, so I don't know how many hacks are still working.  
---
Eh, its not the first time this has happened with the fanbase. Back when Beth purchased the license the amount of division over Fallout 3 was far worse and much more personal in the attacks. I hate seeing that stupid "toxic" BS thrown around though. 
---
Guess I’m not the only one. I logged in yesterday and noticed that more cores were draining very fast, even faster than the last patch. I don’t have a jet pack on. I do use VATS.  I had no idea what could be causing it, unless Speed Demon broke and affected core usage as well.  I went from a sliver on my 15th core down to 75% of core 14 in a few min. A short stroll around Whitesprings put me at 50% of my 13th core. 
---
I ended up logging off my main and enjoyed the rest of the night leveling my new melee alt. 
---
Similar booth at the Tyler County fairgrounds
---
Hello, you're welcome.
---
Something definitely happened at some point. xD
---
I don't know if this will be of much help if the game is making your graphic card tired on low. Did you restart when you applied the changes? I know it sounds dumb but you need to do it.
---
Sometimes, a fresh install of Windows can work wonders, too. :)
---
It depends on the build and what people want out of their characters 
---
Not true, white springs always has high level ghouls...
---
I understand the point that you're trying to make. My answer to you is that I use my power armor for overall quality of life - carry weight increase, damage resistances, not dying from jumping off high places or fighting in nuke zones, not succumbing to huge mobs when farming and I run out of action points, and all that other fun stuff. Also, although I'm not an RPer, I'm sure that those folks wouldn't mind the option of actually remaining in their power armor if the role they're playing calls for it, too.
---
Uhh... you guys are.   It's cute to see you guys become even bigger babies when called out though.  Keep crying and slinging insults like you ain't triggered AF, lmao....
---
I promise, us casuals will continue laughing like hyenas at your paper thin ego.
---
Yeah you want to stick your head in the sand? Do you hate different opinions? Are you such a puss puss that you need a pathetic safe space? 
---
Then come on down to filthycasuals where dissenting opinion isn't allowed!
---
okay thank you game guide, i do know how the perks work and i have them. i can still appreciate free items from other people. 
---
Mole miners. I think it's the breathing mask or whatever its called. Rubber is one of my best selling bulk lol. Run uranium fever or farm Welch area
---
Perfect!  Hmm...just inserted it with my keyboard...I  have a S9
---
Violets are blue,
---
When will they increase our stash limit, 
---
We still have no clue. 
---
Yeah, you're right. I was looking at r/falloutlore by mistake. My bad.
---
That's been my experience, too! Hang in there, maybe they'll address this soon?
---
Me too!  She was really rad.
---
It's not worth pointing out unless you're trying to fuel drama. Subs fluctuate constantly. 
---
Ignore 98% of the content on this sub is tip #1
---
I encountered this mysterious helper as well, pretty sure it’s thelegend27.
---
But as I mentioned in the other reply to this same topic... the Fusion Generator provides enough power for the one thing you really want in the Power Plant workshop.  And it is very cheap to build, plus I'm pretty sure the workshop comes furnished with enough mats to make it.
---
It does, but there seems to be a hard cap on discounts.  
---
I get max benefit from t3 H.B. and a set of unyielding, but i f i take the armor off both T3 H.B. and Grape mentats don't get me the highest discount.
---
Hello again. 
---
There definitely should be an improvement.
---
Another thing I just asked another user is if the game is set to Fullscreen. I think there's something really weird going on if you don't. I for example get 41 fps in the main menu and really, really bad performance in-game. xD
---
Snitch.
---
even a 2 or 3 to one swap at the Ammo Vendor machines would be amazing!  
---
I just finished this quest yesterday, but had an entirely different experience. Bloated charred zombies? Yes. Helpful high level stranger? Nope. I’m a lvl29 and was hopping outside of the fire station and an asshat with a super sledge knocked me playfully at 3-4 step intervals, letting me think I got away and then bashing me in the back. Died, respawned, and another sledge to the back. I must be a jerk magnet. Glad someone else met someone nice!
---
Yes, that's been my experience, too - especially when there are LOTS of other players fighting the SBQ. More health + more VATS shots and crits on the SBQ to finally bring her down = sad fusion core stockpile.
---
Enemies can also hear you.
---
Legendary mobs regenerate hp when they go down the 50% mark.
---
Or you know, lag and bugs. Can't really say from this side of the screen.
---
If you have to use melee to play I think you're missing something. Its not hard to use guns in the game. I'm level 125 and have not used melee at all.
---
&gt; I hate the word Toxic - but that all the Toxic people are around here still is a good thing
---
No it isn't.
---
People that write long winded cringey break up posts as if they were in high school are best gone. 
---
I could care less what they are feeling or thinking or what ideas they have for the game.
---
Demand for rubber? It's everywhere, use scrapper on all weapons too. I been dropping it lately, used to vendor it but the value bulk is not worth the plastic imo.
---
The suggestions here are good. Camden is a daily anyway for fuzzy tokens.
---
BOS Heavy Combat is the best. I have Dense on my Chest and am basically immune to explosives. I can put a 40mm into the ground at my feet and it does nothing.
---
 The Rad Resistance you get from Leaded which is what you want for Rad Resistance, does not compare to the Explosive magic Dense has. Now I have only ever seen one Dense mod for sale.
---
 Scorchbeasts screech attack does nothing as its explosive and hunting them is my sport. Now Compared to my X0-1 it has little Rad Resistance but it takes Explosive Damage.. 
---
I feel you, fellow wasteland wanderer! Let's hope this gets fixed soon.
---
It's your wireless keyboard. 
---
This is the real FO76 sub.
---
That other is for quivering momos who can't handle that people use this sub, the official sub for the game, as its  intended.

I usually get super mutants if the monster mash event is not running. If the event is not running you will get a mob of some form. There was a nerf a while back on how often the event ran.

I undubbed from r/fallout a couple months ago, because after 76 released that place was the most toxic cesspool of hate I've ever seen (towards a game, it's developers, and anyone who liked it). Kinda what this place is turning into. Are you saying it has gotten better over there?
---
That would be convenient for us, but every time they manually change their database like this there is a risk that they do something inadvertently to mangle the data.  I was elated to hear about their duping fixes, but terrified that they would blow away player's stash and player inventories.  It happens even with the best of intentions, it is just the way of the IT world! :)

Workshops give a core / 2 minutes and there is a INT perk to slow it down. Please don't change anything to do with subjective difficulty; as long as we're all on the same level it's fair including 400 stash size.
---
I completely agree! Let's cross our fingers but not hold our breath. :)
---
Can’t help with the info but if you’re on xbox, I’ve got a few decent 3* lever action junkie’s rifles!
---
Well if no one is advocating for a shit game the developers aren’t going to do anything to fix it since there’s no money in fixing it. 
---
So, I’m asking you directly, do you feel like the story has improved more through Bethesda than it might’ve through Interplay? I’m not using this question to show bias towards any opinion either, Bethesda fanboys.
---
OK mobile goodness  🤣 copied yours
---
Thanks! I should throw it out there that I’m also not using the perks that slow down fusion core usage.

As you can see, it could be a lot worse (this isn't the dreadful place) but theres a significant boost here in performance for pretty much no visual difference.

Prior to the December patch, I could sell the duplicate, and other no longer needed quest items to vendors for 0 caps, but alas that has ended, and now it takes forever to scroll through the useless crap to find something.

Calm down keyboard warrior lol Your the one who's crying so hard they had to go to another sub lmaooooo
---
And yes those are 100% facts whether you like it or not.  Sorry not sorry ;)
---
Game subs usually get better with time. When the game gets balanced there is less things to fight about. The Divisions sub was a warzone for a long time, but it got better as the game got better, and this will probably happen here too.
---
I respectfully disagree and refer you to my third paragraph where I mention the things you have raised. Cheers!
---
So...you come here, to a place you hate, to be insulting and shit on floor. Then skip back to your sub to feel superior about how “evolved” and non-negative you all are?

Yeah, that makes sense, somehow. Somewhere.

A lot of people lack the ability to deliver constructive feedback. People just want to use the internet to vent. It is catharsis for them.

Past few times I have visited a railroad vendor when I buy stuff a percentage of the purchase price is added to the cap total. It doesn't give me more caps in the end. But I can basically trade loot for loot.
---
three phrases that (in my mind) discredit your claims of being "objective" or "constructive" with the criticisms of the game:
---
"train wreck"
---
"dumpster fire"
---
"literally unplayable"
---
Yessss please!
---
They do exist, but I don't know where they spawn. I got mine from a vendor back when they still sold them. You can't learn deep pockets from scrapping, so... :(
---
You’ll find both sides of the coin, but the worst are the antagonists that want to cause chaos with “I love the trainwreck” opinions.
---
What hooligans.
---
Being an asshat, treating a sub like shit because they happen to enjoy and like the game is not advocacy.
---
You are also wrongly assuming that the reeeing is heard and not immediately dismissed to /dev/null by devs.
---
A well reasoned and argued suggestion is heard and has a high chance of implementation.

The only people crying are who guys who literally made a whole sub dedicated do being pussies unable to look at criticism of the historically bad game.   Pointing out obvious flaws = criticism.   Running like a puss to a new sub = triggered running away

Why not just wait for an update to check it out again and play something else in the mean time? You're not gonna convince anyone to leave with your posts. If you really want Bethesda to hear then put your thoughts in their surveys.

Yep, i restarted when i applied the changes.. I actually don't think i'm full screen, so ill try that as well (I think i got a new monitor during DECEMBER... and was trying to make use of it... damn, i hope its not as simple as full screen). 
---
Been playing since the beta and i can tell you that of late the servers are less and less populated everytime i log on, my friends list is empty, and the game is dying out fast.  I saw the exact same pattern with metal gear survive, another game i really enjoyed but lack of content and pure rng gear drops along with excessive grind gameplay drove people off.  I love the idea of a multiplayer survival shoot and loot but this game was executed really poorly.  I want it to succeed and i want to play it but the bugs and gameplay are just bad in the case of 76.  Last night i killed a deathclaw and the corpse vanished before it even hit the ground.  I have zero perks for melee damage and do excessivly more damage with a super sledge than i do with any of the guns i am specced for.  These are core problems that need to be fixed.  Why would i choose a less effective and more resource intensive playstyle when the simple choice is so much more effective.
---
"Waaaaaaah.   Waaaaaaaah."  -- SumoSambo76

Thanks for the unsolicited opinion.

U started a new character. Wanted to be melee. My main is a mole miner atm. I'm enjoying it.im level 29 about to transfer in a better weapon.
---
It is a one time event - it's just that the servers keep crashing. No one knows how long it will remain powered for.
---
Also i'm pretty sure it gives 400 power these days.
---
It's decent end game content - power up thunder mountain with a team so it's fast, claim all attached workshops. You could even have a camp on a sub station.
---
I just hop until it pops. It usually pops two or three times a day for me. Just random luck. 
---
 That's a BOS quest set not Enclave.
---
What do you mean? Where are you getting the tech data?
---
You can pick one from the desktop version I believe, just go to the sub and check on the right of the screen.
---
This pretty much nails it but the problem is it's been three and a half months and Bethesda has released exactly one cool time-limited power armor paint job. Not to mention they haven't released *any* cool looking regular armor paints.
---
Junkie's increase is kind of low and not worth the withdrawal effects, but not entirely sure. Think it is +50% capped?
---
Hey stopped playing this a while ago but the problem was fusion cores being spent when hitting vats to search for enemies because I was lazy; if you don’t spam it the core doesn’t deplete as fast. 
---
Oh, definitely! Just make sure and try to be in the same spot, looking in the exact same spot if possible. The game sometimes moves you a bit and you can't find the place anymore you were standing at. xD
---
Yes, and that is all they did. People can start up duping again like nothing happened since they still have that one copy.
---
You only get the negative effects when addicted
---
Oh look, biased incorrect whining.  I'm level 132, never used melee, and never had a problem.
---
Maybe I'm just not a crybaby that sucks at the game though....
---
Maybe you just have to escort it safely to the bottom of the map
---
Excellent question! The VATS drain is the same no matter what suit of power armor I have equipped. For reference, I've tried it in all of them. The only one with mods is my Excavator and that's calibrated shocks on both legs. The others are all unmodded, I simply wanted them added to my collection and they have a nice little spot in my stash.
---
So... I feel like Bethesda has been too safe with their stories and is worried about not including "fan" icons like super mutants and the BoS, I kind of wish they'd branch a bit more. I also miss the sheer variety of options, like making a low int character and having every dialogue in the game changed but I understand that its a pipe dream in the days of voice acted NPC's. I'm overall satisfied as the modding community is amazing and NV exists to scratch my story itch, but I do think far greater things could be done with the license then what we're getting. 
---
Sure lol.   Its not like bethesda themselves use this sub to communicate to its base.   Ya know being the official sub and all and not some place made specifically for pussies.
---
Oh wow! Thanks so much!!!
---
Yeah, now that I know that is happening I guess no VATS in nuked zones, which is sad because I like to target body parts and try to cripple limbs.
---
I suppose I need to go trawl the markets then because that might be best. Next time I play I'll remove starched genes and start curing things until the ones I don't like are gone then put together a list of what I lost and want back. It'll probably end up with something like only needing to buy 3-5 mutations.
---
Damn I had no idea there were that many bos span locations.
---
I have the heavy robot arms, but no torso or legs yet. I actually like the hunt for plans more than than quests so far.
---
Yes 5\* IronClad always loaded. White Knight 3\* :/
---
Crafted a new HCA Left Arm and base stats 26DR 20ER 0RR
---
Added BOS 41 45 0
---
Something is up then, not much I can do at this stage, maybe a stupport ticket but what could they do anyway?
---
Fort Defiance. I tagged rubber and found surgical trays have rubber. Tons of them there. 
---
Duping methods have been fixed as far as I know, it's over.
---
lmao
---
Would suck if it was because of that. The game does Borderless Windowed mode by default as far as I remember/know.
---
All I can say is that it runs REALLY bad for me if I don't play in Fullscreen mode. 
---
Fullscreen is always the best thing you could do to squeeze everything out of your hardware if you didn't know. Just sucks if you need to alt+tab out. lol
---
Berry Mentats and high intelligence helps learning mods faster/more frequent.
---
This is what the post-nuclear wasteland will actually be like.
---
Roger that! So you, too, noticed that even pressing the VATS button drained your fusion core? ;)
---
By this logic it should cost wood and adhesive to collect dirty water as you need to make the milk carton. 
---
I’ve done it all short of reinstalling windows. 
---
I’ll do it again, and try your settings. The crashes have server lag have been driving me mad.
---
So hopefully with the duping fixed and server running smoother, this helps me actually play the game.
---
Not made it past level 7 yet as a result.

Yep even without a target

Is there a way to enter without triggering the monster mash event?
---
I used to go there all of the time and it spawns gutsy and super mutants all of the time without the stupid PvP garbage. I don't go there (like everyone else) now that I know it forces PvP on you.
---
mostly because they're btter than "I want them to...." posts.
---
Can I become a vendor yet?
---
I got lucky (I guess). One of my power armour frames got tagged with the Atom Shop symbol, despite not having bought anything for it.  
---
I think it was when they pinched one of the headlamps from the regular game and slightly modified it to instead sell it for Atoms in the shop. I've still got that headlamp equipped in the suit, so the whole suit now has the Atom Shop icon in the inventory and I can tell it apart from my other frame that doesn't :D
---
Same, unless I have a LOT of fusion cores already, then I go crit-crazy and shed a single tear at the thought of all my lost cores! :P
---
Restarting the launcher didn't help at first, but it seems issue was caused by my system date being incorrect, for some reason. After syncing the time it saved the account data again. I don't know how this happened as my bios time was 100% correct. I will have to run security diagnostics on my PC. Thanks for the help.
---
Ah, ok thanks. Now I will get my char high as a kite.
---
Awwwwww my heart!!
---
How does fixing this one issue really fix the game as  whole. Major flaws are still a thing and yes thanks for fixing the dang thing after 5 months of damage. Im not gonna be greatful for something expected.
---
Oh, I see.
---
Of course, good luck!
---
I've played a bit today and it definitely seemed a bit more solid. Until I dropped items for someone, got disconnected for the first time today and the only time and all my plans/recipes were gone. Rip.
---
Have fun in the game and hopefully you'll get this up and running.
---
If you're stuck on something, let me know.
---
This is the way to go. If I buy things from the vendor, they should have some caps to spare. Since they are robots, it’s not like they’re spending them on liquor and hookers.

All good - there is an improvement (sorry, didn't mean to imply there wasn't). And your post compelled me to check settings again which is great, since I forgot to do that after deleting the .ini. Fullscreen is used; right now I can't use ultrawide. Last patch seems to have broken that for me.
---
What really BURNS through cores is clicking the L1 button (on PS4) really quickly. next time you go online, try spamming the L1 button and watch the core drain instantly. Do you click on it a lot like I used to in a sort of method to scan the area for enemies?
---

What? No, I just don't want to read 10 posts about how a patch is going to fail or 15 posts with bad suggestions.
---
173 zero melee perks and my super sledge outclasses every other weapon i have in terms of damage by a huge margain.  Im specced fkr rifles or shotguns depending on what i feel like using and they just dont compete with the one or 2 hits it takes to kill with a super sledge.  I dont even have high str i think with bonuses its around 9.  In power armor its even easier (though i really only use pa in high rad areas or against scorchbeasts for the extra tankiness).  I didnt say you HAD to use melee but lets be honest if you dont want to sit there shooting a deathclaw with a b.b. gun your gonna swap to the melee meta
---
Good thing your talking like you're acting.   A wittle baby.

Yes, I actually forgot about Rad worms/ S&amp;N and 23 str buffing my stats up by an insane measure. If you run proper perks, you should break 600. Without Rad boys and double repair, I have 500 -605.
---
Remember to use protective perks like Fireproof and Blocker to reduce your damage as well.
---
Awww have you finally understood what you sound like? Keep talking like a baby since it's how you come across. 
---
fuck, just let me get a cap per pound.
---
You were easy work lol
---
Then it might be v-sync. I used to run ultra settings and the game was smooth, but after some time it'd start to lock up. If it got to a point where I could only look around and jump I'd DC soon after. 
---
Excellent point! Yes, I had noticed that trying to target enemies with VATS chewed through my fusion core even when no enemies were nearby. I quickly learned not to do that.
---
What platform you on im on ps4 and most servers are a ghost town
---
In FO4 VATS would slow time quite a bit, and it's possible that in that game the core drain rate was "compressed" to indicate the power drain during slowed time vs real time.  I don't have specific knowledge that that is the case but it makes sense from my experience with 4.
---
What are the odds that same time-compressed calculation is still in 76, even though VATS doesn't affect the tick rate at all now?
---
I guess I'm the sole dissenter that agrees with every word.
---
Fun idea for a camp!
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
Sure thing, man. All good. xD
---
So, you're on 21:9? I'm a former ultrawidescreen user as well. Switched over to 16:9 144hz which was a bit painful but worth it in the end.
---
Have you checked the config files yet?
---
Maybe it doesn't set the resolution the right way. I also recommend you set Borderless and Windowed to 0 in there. There's another couple of Window Mode settings in the normal Fallout76.ini file which I don't know why they're there but they are.
---
Perhaps try setting those up as well if everything else for your resolution fails. I did but didn't notice a difference in my case.
---
I've worked on some HUD mods in the past for 21:9 but I don't remember what I did in Skyrim to set it up. Unfortunately. Should be what I mentioned though.
---
you can move your camp or drop loot. Fallout’s motif has always been “you cant have it all”.
---
I have a lot on, chief.
---
Because....to the stranger who wrecked my camp or shot me in the back isn't popular.
---
Learn to manage you’re weight thresholds, guarantee most of the stuff you’re carry and have stored won’t be worth carrying... 
---
Same here. If you haven't seen it yet, this might be useful to you in your plan hunt:
---
I can't understand why I can kill level 62 scortched easily, but a level 20/30 creature seem invincible to melee or guns. If you die by your camp you can only respawn miles away (my camp is in the wilds) I'm lvl 35 but still get trashed constantly.
---
No I'm just advertising what that other sub is for.   
---
 Where everyone else does, Wes Tec. There is tech data in a couple of other places but that place is the best. It does have a Mutie problem though. ;)
---
 That's Brotherhood not Enclave.
---
Funny, my stack of about a dozen plasma grenades went down to one.
---
I'm not even mad; as far as inventory fuckups go, this is the best possible, least harmful fuckup imaginable, so we're all good.
---
Yeah, I don't have high cha, I ment char like character. 
---
I think it's definitely possible but I can't speak to that with any concrete knowledge since I haven't tried delving into any kind of coding in over a decade. That might be a good place for them to start looking when trying to make this better. Thanks for thinking of it!
---
No in fallout 4 you needed a perk card to travel encumbered.and if you thought you were going to finish that quest encumbered you have something else coming because taggardys body spawns a sub in the cave. Good luck with that

Or maybe you are just butthurt cause the game you like is objectivly bad and you do t lime people pointing it out, literally EVERYONE i know who bought this game has stopped playing i had to beg people to friend me the other night to move a piece of armor from one of my characters to another because i did not have a sigle friend online at 8pm est to help me

Scraping hunting rifles gives rubber, IIRC. 
---
Lmao you're finally talking like you're age.   Good for you! 
---
When whitesprings gets nuked, stick to the perimeter trees outside the walls and get the glowing sap and neutron pods.  With green thumb i get 30-40ish.  Im sure there are places with higer yield, but its easy with the amount of whitespeing nukes.
---
Ah, thanks for the info!
---
its really funny when you call out others for their lack of "balls" when you to had make your own safe space 
---
Golf clubs at the Whitespring scrap to rubber, steel &amp; plastic.
---
I use excavator with a couple pieces level 35 and a 1* quad lever action. I ruin scorchbeasts and do really well in nuke zones. I have mediocre gear and it works. I'm not being held back, I'm not being punished. If a duped melee or AAE shows up at whitesprings while I'm there, I get the kills first. 
---
Your perk loadout is more important than your gear, period. The only time it matters more is SBQ and nobody even does her anymore. But I still do fine against her. 
---
Good point actually. I have only had it a couple of times for the station. It's probably because he is behind a desk and they need to get close enough
---
I didn't make shit, no nuts.
---
xD
---
Yeah, they have a different number of hit points. In FO4 for example, Assaultrons had 3-4x as many HP as Protectrons.
---
[Lol.](https://i.ibb.co/0VnK5BX/crybaby.jpg)
---
I use non-automatic rifles and shotguns. I appreciate all of y'alls advice. I think I know where I need to go from here. Now my next question is that there's a currency cap?
---
That's amazing! Nice work!
---
Packed on Xbox One.
---
Got mine for 500 recently. Fun gun. 
---
The sword of a thousand truths wasnt bop bruh.. imagine if it was...

[Lol](https://i.ibb.co/0VnK5BX/crybaby.jpg)

We were doing a 2 vs 1, no perks shared and push to talk active.  
---
When he instantly found me while using chameleon I asked him how it was possible, so we made a few tests.
---
For some reason he was always seeing me when I was using chameleon.  
---
any facts to back that claim or just talking smack boyo?
---
I have completed that quest.  I know the Watoga bots fight with the BOS vendor but never seen them attack the vendor inside the Watoga Station.  
---
4 times in a row the Muties spawned inside the High School.  Before that I never ran into them inside the High School.  Some strange odds.  I see some people saying they might spawn if the event is not triggered.  I’ve also been there many many times without triggering the event.  I wouldn’t have asked if these things didn’t happen right after the patch came out.   Seems like it’s just a big coincidence now.  
---
Yep, ultrawide user. Dell 32" something or other. Bought it for Lightroom, and does well for gaming despite not having the highest refresh. I'll check the config, thanks for the lead : )
---
I always thought that looting another players bag should give them the option of declaring revenge on you. I remember one time the game popped up a message that soandso looted my stuff. I've only ever seen that one time.
---
I also remember dying to PVE and another guy who was there took my stuff, so I gave him the thumbs down and continued with what I was doing. He did the come here and dropped most of my junk. He kept the good stuff. Kinda of an empty gesture there fella.
---
Also, I'm too paranoid about losing my stuff so I always stash anything I cannot live without. Still kind of annoying if you die somewhere that renders the bad irretrievable. Like in deep enough water, or in a harvest-able plant, or a fissure, etc...
---
Well I do. And that's what bethesda wanted workshops to be highly contested spots  dont like it find an empty server but you will always have that 1 shmuck to ruin your day
---
Wow, thanks. For that. I actually remember seeing that while I was busy at work and promptly forgot about checking it when I got home. It's bookmarked now.
---
Have you done the mayor quest yet to get All Rise? 
---
Either bloated Ghouls or Super Mutants is what I've encountered in Watoga High in my past visits.
---
Are you really dumb enough to think I started FilthyCasuals, girl-o?
---
People will find a new way I'm sure of it 
---
✋
---
Not the hero we deserved... but the one we needed. 
---
Never heard of that sub, subscribed. Thanks!
---
Oh, no, far from it. I'm just saying that I'm still interested in Fallout 4 and New Vegas, and the folks on r/Fallout can sometimes talk about those games in valid and interesting ways without just beginning to shriek like rabid animals about Fallout 76, so it's worth it for me to be subscribed to that subreddit for that reason alone. I would never try to discuss this game on that subreddit since it triggers them so badly. 
---
Go to the General and save some time!
---
Because that's a high level area. Do watoga mayor for the day and they will stop attacking you. Bring friends along or tons of stims for the roof fight. 
---
I tested it with a buddy. He uses a completely OP death claw bloodied build. He did normal slap damage out of pvp. In pvp he can 1 shot me from full hp in my assassin sentinel full set. Not sure what these people are talking about. My guess is they are mistaken and don’t know all the ways to initiate combat with another player.
---
Nice!   
---
Alright then. Lemme know what's up later if you want. I'd also recommend you use something to monitor the usage and what-not. Would be good to know what's really going on.
---
And then theyre in a different post later bitching about something else. 
---
Please let us know how it is, I've been thinking about doing a junkie build or an alcoholic build myself 
---
I would say this sub began as a fracture of the fallout reddit. I left that sub because it started to get to NMA level of hate and toxicity with the mere mention of Fallout76. I grew tired of it and found this one. As of late, I’ve noticed and increasing amount of complaints because the game doesn’t seem catered specifically to them and demand Bethesda to change it to fit their needs instead of trying to change the way they usually approached the series (I’m guessing this is due to lack of mods, where one could change it as they please). It’s getting a bit tiresome, seeing the same type of demands and complaints. It’s refreshing to see a different side of a community in other subs. 
---
Just go back to the method that worked in all previous version of Fallout out, let us trade Stuff for stuff.
---
It does seem odd, with such a very small percentage of duper accounts, to effect all of the servers and to notice such a performance increase after all of those items have been removed.
---
Maybe, Bethesda can just keep dropping these dupe removers until they find a fix though, making duper's lives much harder.
---
That was a dumb question. If he has the all rise than the quest is com p.k Pete and robots wont attack. All rise is the quest completions item for mayor for the day
---
They give yellowcake though, not violet.
---
I love how I reduced you to literally crying lmao.   Come on little boy keep getting so mad.  Your my bitch if you respond to this lol. 
---
I just want my damage maxed out. I run 3x3 rifleman cards plus tank killer 3 and i have a really nice build atleast imo. I can one hit lvl 98 enemies. 
---
True! I apologize! 
---
I think this is the most challenging fight in the game. Without spoiling too much, you're just so restricted on where to go to hide or heal. 
---
Literally explaining what I was asking lmao thanks 
---
you seem awfully triggered considering how agressive you are
---
and c alling other crybabies/toxic when you are pretty toxic yourself
---
keep slinging insults tho
---
its the best you can do anyway
---
So I just did a Prime run, adjusted my placement a bit, and spent a lot of time looking after killing the SBQ. Came up with 194, and it would have been another 20-30 more, if I hadn't hit some of those plants already within the last 24 (?) hours, whatever the flora refresh cycle is.
---
I've had vengeful Mothman be red and yellow eyed. Yellow eye was level 45. I think the red eye was 35 maybe. 
---
None of these were in a nuke zone. 
---
Your first comment towards me was an insult.  ...and I thought women were suppose to be smarter than men.....
---
Error 404:
---
Sign not found
---
Why are you so angry in this thread? 
---
Ohh thanks. I really want to wait until I hit level 50 to get a level 50 all rise. I lost the one on my main character. 
---
No I finished that quest level 15 and his in the elevator for the 5 minutes. I occasionally had to bash a robot out the elevator and stim up. But got the all rise at lvlt 15 and stored in my stash until 45.
---
Everything in the game hates you and wants to eat you.
---
welcome home!
---
[You're a bitch period, and you love dick if you ever make any post again.](https://i.ibb.co/0VnK5BX/crybaby.jpg)
---
I did that quest at level 35. I didn't engage in fight besides the odd scorched, chameleon armor + a stack of stealth boys I got farming Tyler County Fairgrounds and a couple other places. in and out in about 5 mins OP
---
Don't quote me on this since it might not be completely true, but i think it's because you don't have enough armor penetration.
---
Not too long ago i had huge issues vs radscorpions. Now i only need 2 or 3 shots to kill them. The only thing that changed was me finishing my character build and anti-tank was the last perk card i equipped 
---
In other cases such as robots you should try aiming for different body parts. Always aim for legs on robots and you'll do extra damage. Or the combat inhibitor. One crit there does ~75% damage
---
This is a high level area. Honestly at level 30 you probably shouldn’t be there without an escort (at least if you’re going to watch a shopping center. As the person above said, complete mayor for a day... you won’t be able to complete it without a crew at level 30. Cranberry bog is the end game area, it’s supposed to wreck the under leveled or unprepared.
---
Where in a million years do you think you get to own a resource or a workshop indefinitely?  
---
This is completely a game mechanic issue you need to educate yourself on or leave workshops alone.
---
Are you going to take a nap after that tantrum?
---
Ugh! Well good to know at least. I’m going to keep running like hell to get closer to different spawn point.
---
why should that even be in the game though? If people don't even like it and don't want to deal with that shit, why even allow it? You seriously sound so passive like a spineless baby. we have to put up with some shit we don't even want him to game just because that's how it was designed? Is that really it? I don't buy that at all
---
scrap, give/drop, sell.
---
Unless you find a really good higher level weapon (3\* legendary that fits your build), don't hoard.
---
None that I know of.  All the times that I been there without triggering the event I find the scorched inside. 
---
No I noticed this problem when I just did it. The filing cabinet has like 50 keys in it for some reason but only one advances your quest. 
---
Yes, and everyone hates it, and no one wants it to be this way. It's really dumb
---
/r/fallout claims that fallout 4 is the worst game ever and the death of the franchise yet its the most sold fallout and has more players than skyrim on steam really makes you think
---
Right? Cause he clearly cares
---
A lot.
---
Got it, you and everyone that downvoted me are just really dense.  
---
The title is similiar to all those dumbass "I'm fed up and quitting!" posts that are always on here and r/fallout.  
---
It's a passive aggressive jab about it.
---
&gt; has been hoarding karma insanely since then (4.5k).
---
Scrap everything. Save good legendary lies you think you will use. If you scrap everything then when you get that perfect legendary you can mod it :)
---
Man I miss the Laser RCW... It'd totally forgotten about it
---
to add to this, the little power station just north of whitesprings, and along that road there are a decent amount of the pods.
---
Thanks for the tip, and your spot on with the need for violet flux. How was the hardened mass, glowing mass and irradiated fliuds there?
---
It stems from trying to convince the other side, but it's more skewed than that. Those leaving KNOW that them leaving doesn't hurt Bethesda in the long run, unless it's a mass exodus. 
---
This is why you'll get so many negative posts of people trying to convince others to leave, which in turns makes people staying try to remain positive and convince MORE users to stay.
---
In reality, this game will probably go in a direction most players weren't expecting and so they will leave because of it, but it will attract new players all the same who ARE interested in the gameplay.
---
Well you probably wont make it considering there are 3 sb spawn locations right around you. Best bet drop your camp next to glass tavern and you know the rest
---
They could implement a failsafe against people removing their items befor completing the transaction by showing an overview of both players items that they would give and the amount of caps owed to one player. And then the player will either accept or reject. If both parties accept, the transaction is complete.
---
Not a problem. I love clearing the golf corse. Also always check the putter area. Some times there are tons of golfballs on the ground there. Lots of plastic when you can get them.
---
The title?
---
I’m all about efficiency and anti-XP waste but meh. Like 30 technical data trips and I’m all technical data’d out.
---
I was mainly thinking of applying this to vender bots.
---
&gt; The game caters heavily towards an extremely small group of players
---
If this was true you would have waaaay more upvotes.
---
If the game isn't for you it doesn't mean it's only for a small group of players. 
---
I don't think so. I just did this and most were 6-10 (I'm level 21), a couple were 20 and one 40 I ran into. 
---
I don’t really have too much difficulty with bots just the Assaultrons. They’re a pain in the “ASS”aultron
---
It seems like they are getting longer and longer too. Apparently more words == better opinion.
---
Crossing that bridge towards the landfill is what causes the venderbot to spawn, so it's not a coincidence..you've just caused him to spawn!
---
I don't. It's just a passive aggressive post. It isn't towards me, and I couldn't care if it has anything to do with this sub.  
---
Do you guys just not read titles? It's making fun of people who post those stupid "I'm fed up and quitting" threads.
---
I now Bethesda can do an amazing job so yeah. Im just sitting back enjoy the drama and wait. Fo76 will look completly different in a year or 2 i bet. 
---
Same here. Was stuck until I found out you have to grab the one key that has the quest marker on it. The rest are garbage.
---
When bored I chill at the first overseer camp crafting weapons and armor. I usually drop a fully kitted sniper, .44, shotgun and a bunch of ammo for each along with a full suit of reinforced leather armor.  
---
I should start adding a melee and unarmed option to the bag.
---
You mean, why am I making fun of these crybabies for fun?
---
didn't know lack of self awareness was a insult :)
---
&gt;and I thought women were suppose to be smarter than men
---
just lol
---
This happened to me during the same quest. The girl who saved me laughed when I tried to give her a reward and instead gave me a Goul Slayers Sickle so I could return the favor to somebody someday. Now, I help everyone I can even if it means going out of my way and costs me precious stimpaks. This is how people should be. 
---
Thannk you
---
You either didn't read the title of that post or you don't know what it means.
---
Gonna break it to you, you don't speak in behalf of "everyone".
---
As long as they have active players they only care about atom shop numbers
---

---
I think it depens on sneak status. You only get healed when [HIDDEN] 
---
Hmmm, what did that "lack of self awareness" refer too?  Insults you were responding to?   That makes it an insult... if you know how english works....
---
Especially when there are better damage output perks to be maxed, such as martial artist which increases swing speed or tank killer which increases armor penetration
---
Yeah they’re pains in the ass. Just know the last fight of mayor for a day you have to fight 25+ max level colonel gutsy
---
I’ve tried the stealth boy route a couple of times, and the Scorched seem to ignore that I’m cloaked and beat the crap outta me anyway. No stealth buffs though and maybe the lag between respawn and getting control back burns my 30 seconds of steathboy quick?
---
Thank you.

"I LOOTED THIS SIGN FROM A 3-STAR LEGENDARY"
---
I have a one-handed melee/non-auto rifle build that has been pretty fun. I am only a lvl 51 on my first play through, so I am not sure how viable for endgame
---
Hey u/Ombree123,
---
Would you please send me a PM with your platform and your [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) username so we can look into this? If you've submitted a Support ticket already, you can include that and we can escalate there as well.
---
Look on the bazaar subreddit. People who have the recipes sell them cheap. 
---
Yes finished it on my main. But by the time I did it I was level 80. They weren’t a problem 
---
A quote. You see, when I put quotes around something, it means it is not my direct language. In this case, it is me quoting the original OP. He chose to frame it that way. 
---
By the way, it’s clear by now you are a smart ass childishly trolling for “wins” so I’m shutting you down. Yes, you deserved those insults.  Bye.
---
Not bad, I probably got a 4-6 of each, mostly off mirelurks and robots IIRC. The best I've ever done was something like 14 hardened masses and 12 glowing masses on a Whitesprings run, so it wasn't crazy like that, but not bad.
---
From what I can tell, without the perk that extends fusion core life, each click of the target button takes off about 1% of the fusion core. I hate it but I don't can't travel through the bog or the mire without doing it constantly.
---
Eyyyy theres my fellow dev
---
The higher your Int is when crafting something the larger the CND bar will be and your items may have higher stats upon crafting.
---
The double white bar just means the item has been repaired to 200% CND.
---
This is true. It’s a lark of an idea on my part and not likely to be something I’ll actually do, and if I do, I won’t be doing it often.
---
Yeah, shortly after that thread they made another bitching about how they've finally found a sub that isn't complaining about the game filled with people talking about how bad this sub is.
---
Well spoken! 
---
Just dropping down to your level since it's easier lol.   Why are you here my little pet? I thought you needed a safe space with the rest of the quivering pussies?
---
Nice homophobia you had there btw
---
Handmade does benefit from rifleman.
---
Source: have all three rifleman-perks maxed and sport a handmade as my main weapon, though I sometimes switch to Commando-perk for my level 50 'The Storm'
---
Here's an idea. Remove PVP from the game
---
They fight both Bots... Neutral Vendors, "Hostile" Bots
---
I want to visit WV now that I’ve played the game and run around the geography. Seems like a great place to just get out there.
---
Are you on PS4 I'm guessing? I started getting that error a while ago across all my games, haven't been able to figure out the problem. It might be a playstation problem
---
Wow I was ready to put the game back on the shelve.  I'll PM you! 
---
Pretty sure that's not the case. Since you can walk (not run or sprint) in PA and as long as you aren't over encumbered, and your core wont drain. You can stand perfectly still and use vats and it'll drain like it's its job.
---
I’ve run into miles there, lvl2’s at the train station, my guess is they have multiple at each train station to sell stuff all the time
---
I’ve been holding on to incrementally sell xtween responders, enclave and raiders every day plus holding my breath for the 800 WT stash, but maybe it’s just time to cut bait on that approach and deal with the 600. After FO4 I’m kind of passive aggressive about the weight limit: what does Bethesda think the point of having a CAMP if I can’t store things at my CAMP (or practically get to my CAMP without relocating).?
---
Why?  The cap limit had nothing to do with dupes.  What a silly thing to say.
---
If this is your first multiplayer shared-world game, it's normal for the economy to have some sort of limiter.  In this case, you have access to infinite loot and spawns, so the limiter is placed on your ability to turn loot into caps.
---
You don't have to go around every day maxing out vendors.  You can choose not to, I have like 10k caps and just don't worry about it unless I happen to be near a vendor anyway.
---
This suggestion is, in its entirety, AMAZING!
---
You’re using assets and plot-hooks already in-game in fun new ways that are in-keeping with Raider Rose’s character and with the story as it’s unfolded so far. I would LOVE this sort of content!
---
Sounds fun. I play alone most of the time so I’d rather have the option to switch between melee and ranged. What are the stats for your build?
---
If it relies on a text input during crafting, they could add words to a blacklist that can't be added to the signs, sort of like how Pokemon doesn't let you use offensive words in nicknames.
---
You can only hold 25k caps. 
---
Or you could just change your behavior, realize that caps are not that important and there is little point in lusting after them, and just not worry about it.
---
Passive means you cant hurt them, they can still hurt you
---
I did it around 30, wish i had waited to 50 to get a better All Rise
---
I drop nukes on Whitesprings when I need the masses and fluids. I drop nukes on the Mire/Watoga when I need flux.
---
They won’t have active players if they don’t improve upon the game.
---
I wish the shelves worked like containers. You could put stuff inside them and it would just appear sitting on the shelf and unable to move
---
Unfortunately this would be a huge project for some programmer to get this into the game
---
[Keep writing books in response to my one-liners.  Lol.](https://i.ibb.co/jWG0RbS/awQEzpH.jpg)
---
Only started happening to me recently and I too have the constant [caution] thing going on. Before the past week or so it was working perfectly. 
---
It only happens when I log in to a certain character on fallout 76
---
I’m basically having this same problem. At The Generals, I can easily 1/2 shot level 60 Super Mutants and Scorched, which is why I wasn’t sweating Glass Cavern when I saw level 40/50 Scorched. But I can fire 7 headshots at 95% in VATS at them and their health barely budges.
---
Really I thought it only benefited from the one that give automatic rifles damage? Anyways I still don’t feel too bad, it did way less damage then my TSE lever action and that’s all I really have been using anyways. Don’t have no reason to carry around a bunch of TSE guns when someone else could really use it
---
Whelp, i'm crossing my fingers tonight that it'll be as simple as that then :)
---
I’ve completed 20 plus times. Just be in the lookout 
---
Ya I was going through my inventory when I accidentally dropped mine. Looked down to pick it back up and it was gone. It was my best melee weapon.
---
I finished it on my 2nd character at lvlt 15 because of the plastic in watoga and Phoenix and watoga have separate cap pools I can sell too in short distance and shooting bots are annoying. Plus I looked dumb ducking behind Phoenix waiting for him to clear enemies so I can trade with him. Your choice but the all rise isn't that great unless you have a melee build for 2 handed weapon. I only use the all rise when I need to but you need to be close to your enemy to use it and when you are getting mobbed it swings slowly even with the perk card. I found better luck with single handed melee weapons with legendary on them
---
Really??
---
Vendors aren't there to give away caps, they stash some away when you buy stuff.
---
Prior to VISITING enclave.  The user hit Harpers before going to Whitespring Bunker.  Which means they missed out on a cheap stop by to turn in the Tech Data from available in the Bunker.
---
dump your junk besides ballistic fiber. everything else is really easy to reacquire (even ultracite).
---
or dump chems. chems are heavy and abundant (rad-x, rad-away, stims, buffout... the plain ones).
---
i carried too much for too long. i now have 3 sets of PA and generally my stash is 500-550, leaving me nice overhead for swaps and testing new stuff out.
---
if you’re looking for caps- find an item u can craft that weighs 0.1 and u can make at least 25c selling 1 of them. you’ll be rich in no time.
---
I really wish they would change the mechanic of PA using fusion core for AP. If I'm using my AP within my current AP limit, it shouldn't touch the fusion core. Only when I exhaust my AP and then try to use vats, sprint, jump or something should it then tap into the fusion core. Same with running while over encumbered. Once my AP runs out, if I keep running, only then should it tap into the fusion core to refill my AP. But if I walk before my AP empties, it should refill naturally with the core. 
---
 Yeah My crafter did it at level 22. 
---
You'll sometimes get lucky if you go do that quest while high levels are there, we'll keep the winged demon off your back at least. I love taking down SB's when their over Watoga, so many high places to get good shots on the from.
---
Just checked m, it still does 
---
Mine had a 90% weight reduction and swung crazy fast ☹️
---
&gt; Y’all
---
it’s 2019 and this is the quickest way to inform someone you have nothing of value to offer 
---
Farming is boring. Farming while having a goal is a lot less boring. If I am doing golf course runs, I will invite a lowbie to group and let them sponge exp off it. Empathy mutation helps them survive.
---
Inside the Whitespring Bunker, the Military Wing is filled with Desks.  It's pretty much guaranteed to find at least 1.  usually 4-5 Tech Data exist.
---
Heavy weapons too! 
---
They seem to break really quickly. 
---
Exactly...so of it is exactly like in fallout 4...no cap limit and everything I spend goes back to his inventory, right?
---
I go to say top of the world...kill everything and grab all loot, all items lying around...drag all that crap from over 100 enemies to the vendor...but he has only 200 caps right?
---
So I buy a plan for 5000 caps first.  Now he has 5200...I sell all the crap and get my caps all back...repeat 5 or 6 times? You could clear out every vendor in short order and have all plans in a week.
---
If they did this, which they won't, then they would probably also increase prices by 10x as more to compensate.
---
So I bu
---
Cool, so then everyone hits the 25k cap limit with a bunch of caps they don't need, and then ask for a cap increase.
---
Y'all need to get over your caplust and realize you don't need to go around min/maxing your profits.  I drop crap on the ground all day and the 10k caps I do have are far more than I need.
---
The game is screaming at you to stop trying to hoard junk and caps.  So stop.
---
It's happening everywhere.
---
I'm not quite at the SBQ point (undergeared, a little under-leveled), so I try to farm legendaries in other locations.  Well more than 50% of the time, either the corpse just vanishes, or there's no legendary drop at all.  It's frustrating as hell.
---
I mean, the exp is nice, but I really wouldn't mind getting a few gear upgrades as I go.  I think I've picked up 1 new item that I'm using in the last 4-5 days.
---
Go play Bingo. Please don't bore us with another here's what's wrong, I'm leaving. Your probably go pick holes in that. If your finished with a game please guys/ladies move on quietly xx
---
 It very easy. I took my level 13 plan whore there and decided it was so benign, I did not need Major for a day like his predecessor.
---
What are the sword stats and where do you get it? 
---
This is the biggest load of shit I've ever heard. Crying doesn't get stuff fixed faster. What gets fixed was always going to get fixed. Stop patting yourselves on the goddamn back for being annoying. 
---
If shadow distance is 10x more than FO4, why do I still watch shadows form right before my eyes. I’m walking up to a building and finally when I get 10 paces away it fills with shadow. 
---
Worse part about this game for me. I built a monster rig for the sole purpose of not having to watch shadows form right in front of me. Breaks immersion.
---
Yes. I got so tired of scrapping and scrapping and getting only a mod per 5th weapon. Unyielding pieces also help as they raise stats. 
---
When raising INT I get mods on every other scrap  untill I have everything but the muzzle/silencer/compensator are the most rare.
---
a lot of my scorched, including the beasts stayed stationary in that perpetually frozen state so that may have helped. the few that woke up were easily picked off with silenced shots. not sure about your situation, was just throwing in my 2c in regards to completing it if you do manage to get out 
---
lever action are not super common.   If you have space and it fits your build I would save.  
---
I think that's the standard effect but it still swings slow compared to blade of best or combat knife swing
---
Are you so dumb you think 3 sentences is a book? How pathetic.  I thought you weren't a toxic little bitch?
---
 What is wrong with you? My present was there at level 13 and did just fine.
---
I've done 140+ in the prime area - depends on where the nuke is dropped.  Also around Watoga one day that got nuked.
---
This happens in every game ever released, you can’t make everyone happy. I just feel like a lot of these whiners didn’t play previous Fallouts or other Bethesda titles because they seem so shocked by bugs. 
---
Maybe it depends if you put an automatic receiver on it? I have a singlefire receiver, and it most definitely benefits from Rifleman. Or else I wouldnt need to swap out my Commando-perks (for automatic rifles ;-)).
---
I forget exactly I'll check when I get home this afternoon and update
---
The Whitespring Bunker military wing is filled with Tech Data.  Makes it very easy to grab 1 or 2 (if you like the higher reward) when you go there first then hit Camp Venture as a half way point before your Harper's Ferry jump.

the longest winded  "git gud" ever.
---
I know someone that still has over 50k nuka in their inventory after patch. Beth Austin didn’t get everything. 
---
I was never ok with it. It was my first and last preorder
---
True, but how would that fit with how inventory is normally handled by this engine? There are better ways to do it, but the question is how are they doing it within the limitations of the original engine?
---
Cool...
---
Yeah well at level 50 in a team it's quite a challenge but hey want a cookie because it was so easy for you?
---
Go whine elsewhere, we are tired of seeing the shit posts. This isn’t an airport, no need to announce your departure. 
---
“This sucks because it’s not my kind of fun, so you can’t enjoy it either” go back to fortnite and leave us alone.
---
[Lol.](https://i.ibb.co/jWG0RbS/awQEzpH.jpg)
---
Max range of combat shotguns is 32 meters outside of that they do -90%. Suppressors resuduce the max range even more.
---
I was running martial artist and it swung crazy fast 
---
Cant wait to print this and set it up next to my nuka quantum power armor i ordered in 1/6 scale... gonna be epic!
---
And Lootcifer will rise from the ashes!
---
23 strength? I've only got 15 -1 from Bird Bones, looks like I need to rethink my specials.
---
I mean I left the fallout sub for the same reasons.
---
I paid 35 a few days ago and it's awesome so far
---
And why do u have to spread ur negativity? Its my favorite game right now. I would pay 60$ again if it came out today
---
Neither does making people grind like mad for things.
---
I have items to the value of 10 000 caps in my inventory but instead of being able to buy the thing currently up for sale by *trading* my items and caps I now have to trawl each vendor at 1400 caps per day for over a week to get the caps and not buy the item which is no longer in the vendor's inventory. Great fun all round.
---
Not.
---
And in all honesty it is inconceivable that caps have already become currency, recognized by automatronic vendors in only 25 years. Barter would probably still be the go to method of transacting. 
---
"KRUSTY KRAB IS UNFAIR" 
---
You get why this was changed, right?  FO76 has *no* scarcity for sellable loot.  You can get infinite loot in very little time, like farming ghouls for chems.
---
The only way to prevent this from immediately breaking the economy is to limit your ability to gain caps, or to barter as a cap substitute.  You could clear out vendors in no time flat.
---
It's not about your convenience.  It's about managing a multiplayer economy where stuff falls from the sky.
---
Dude. Stop telling me what to spend my money on.
---
Just scroll through here and report him.  Just get him banned lol
---
I've been subbed since release. Stopped playing at lvl 50 after a month or so. 
---
I'm subbed to the Destiny/Warframe subreddits and a few others. It's really not much different.
---
When the game is doing well and things are good people post positive things and thank developers. But when shit hits the fan with crappy bugs/op weapons/no content/etc. People lose their shit and complain.
---
The only thing different on this sub is Fo76 has never been doing well. It's been a complete failure for the most part.(except Beth still got our money) The game is bad. I love Fallout so much but sometimes you just have to admit when something sucks even if you like it.
---
there's a reliable spawn for the weapon itself (often modded already) in the asylum, the BOS side main floor, second door on the left. I think it's a level 1 lock, but there is a BOS body beside an open footlocker that spawns different type of grenades, above that on a shelf is always a chinese officer sword 
---
Yeah no even at lvl 60 when I first went through wasnt hard. No need to be a dick....dick
---
I feel like when 76 was being made, they zoomed out to only see the big picture. Which is great. But when you start to zoom in, you really see the flaws. Good post, more details and big free is what I'm looking for from Bethesda! 
---
I have an anti armor with limb damage I literally one shot lvl 50s and + on legs arms or head
---
I'd love a flag telling me when those items are no longer relevant, so I can trash/store them away.  I had the same problem in FO4, hundreds of holo tapes (for instance) to scroll through to try to find the one that I just picked up.  90%+ of them are now useless, but I can't remember which ones are and which ones still need to be used.
---
I’m on XB1 and will be on around 6pm ET this evening. if you’re on XB1 and would some merc service i’ll join you if you’re still stuck. i’d help you move some weight and i have no interest in stealing your junk because for me it’s just easy to get what i need/want and that also provides me something “to do” in the game right now.
---
Do you realize if you die to a player even with Pacifist mode on you will give the player who killed you the same amount of caps as your level?
---
Your junk bag and caps are incentive enough.
---

Conduit wall pass through interior wall into undersided wire to conduit. When you grab the end piece for the wire connection to conduit you can connect that to the wall pass through. If you want to pm me we can add each other and I'll show you. 
---
More because I like upvoting. I think I may have a problem...
---
I mean, if we're on the topic of semantics, the classification of *ballistic* vs. *energy* weapons is dumb to begin with. Every weapon does damage by projecting energy onto a target; the more accurate distinction would be what *kind* of damage. For instance, instead of the stupid ballistic, energy, and radiation categories (THE "R" IN LASER IS FOR RADIATION DUMB DUMBS), we could have kinetic, thermal, nuclear, chemical, and ionizing categories instead.
---
Fuck it, maybe later I'll create a breakdown of how I'd reclassify existing weapons.
---
If you're doing a golf course run.......
---
Not sure what the down votes were for but you just proved my point. If you're doing a golf course run you're going to kill everything in the golf course whether or not a lowbie is there. 
---
Lik e I said....... it's cool that he helped and it was a great story but that guy was going to wreck that club regardless.
---
I whole heartedly agree, it’s such a beautiful world it just needs a little love. I really hope that as time goes along we see these updates implemented.
---
The game does have a warning before you take the workshop. If you don't like BJs, don't put your penis in the gravy!
---
[.](https://i.ibb.co/jWG0RbS/awQEzpH.jpg)
---
You also swing them faster in third person because of this.
---
This would be perfectly fine with me. I don't care if I have high score in the cap collecting mini-game. I just want to trade for those plans, ow whatever.
---
I always use flatwoods. 
---
The specific vendors I dont know if people will always go to but flatwoods is a good safe area for new players that most everyone travels thru. 
---
I'll dump at watoga or whitesprings vendors too if I'm in that immediate area
---
Okay whatever. Every online game is about the grind. Grand Theft Auto online you have to grind forever to get all that stuff that is artificially high and price and that you get an extremely low cash flow from events and activity. The cap limits and the way the trading happens is how they are imposing that in this game. If it becomes much easier to get caps they will just respond by increasing prices.
---
If players can get everything in the game within a week, which they would be able to do with the system you are suggesting, then players will have nothing to do after that and will get bored and will quit.
---
But keep on downvoting me, and keep on with your delusion that there's any chance that this will be implemented. Whatever makes you happy.
---
Im shocked not played yet heard guns are still utterly useless so my build is still worthless
---
If they add more content can we get some better trolls? You guys aren't even trying anymore. 
---
The way this sub has been the last week and the amount of people and posts ive seen saying theyre tired of the attitude here makes what you say sounds very reasonable to believe 
---
May have been a mule account without other duped items so it may not have gotten the second pass?  Just speculating. 
---
Sometimes my chest peice
---
I don't think its too new
---
I know your post is a bit old but I'm having the same issue, I'm stuck at 20% stored, nothing in my stored, blueprints all deleted. I even scraped everything and completely rebuilt my camp. 
---
I'm curious, do you happen to have a pet tamed at your base? I had a rad toad tamed but it died. I know that affects camp budget but I'm not certain exactly how.
---
I like to kite a bunch of mobs into a parking garage, throw a grenade at the nearest car, jump out of the building, and then run back in to collect the loot.
---
New bugs everyday. Now I have to re-equip my power armor leg every time I fast travel
---
It’s been around for a while, it’s common.
---
Doesnt matter where you are on the map, if you claim a workshop and an other player tries to claim it he can shoot you anywhere on the map untill one of you 2 dies or when he managed to claim it. It would be normal if pvp is enabled when you own a workshop.  
---
It's not new. I have had this happening to multiple pieces for a while.
---
Only started today for me
---
I have 480 nuka grape still. I found them in the overseers stash. Wierd.
---
Also in fo4 it killed people to the wall when you killed them. That was my jam. Shoot peoples heads off and the heads stuck to the wall. Yessss
---
Wait you're telling me it's a piece of piss... who was the dick first? God I love this community. 
---
No, believe me, I am fully aware of the laundry list of various "problems" and "controversies" you likely have with the game (as well as the ones that people tried to conjure up before the game was even released based on the initial announcement). Anyone who even casually browses this sub or the main fallout sub is *very well aware* of your "problems" because you never stop bitching about them- hence the reason people created a new sub to get a break from your bitching...
---
Also to be clear, I am in no way suggesting the game itself is in a great state. Its not. Far from it. There absolutely are things that are wonky or even broken in terms of game design- but is abundantly clear that your interests aren't in ultimately getting a good product, (which is still in the realm of posssibility despite your feelings towards it) its just to bash the game, the developers and player's who don't share your exaggerated outrage. If you hate the game and devs so much, at what point do you move on? When do you finally walk away and focus your time on games/other things you do enjoy? 
---
I'm not here to deny anyone joy, that's totally unfair and I'm happy people have had a good time with the game, I played the main quest and got to level 40ish, went to take down the scotchbeast Queen but ultimately fell away from it. I just don't want people to think this is acceptable, they should have waited untill this game was playable and had more content. 
---
There’s the Ultracite Gatling Laser to collect as well.
---
You gotta remember that a lot of dupers probably dumped their inventories before the patch too. 
---
As soon as you removed Pacifist mode and it your mutation probably proved flagging you for full pvp damage.
---
I have the Unstable Isotope mutation so I'm carefully around aggressive melee players trying to get me to flag for pvp.
---
Lol, well I'm back to zero anyway.  So as you can see, there ain't no pvpers or griefers here.   XD
---
If u dont wanna be killed, dont claim a workshop
---
Same with my X-01 left arm 
---
So am I. I can beat more ads with single handed melee over a two handed. And w martial arts on single melee kills fast. My friend with a legendary combat knife eats through ads in a nuke zone fast. Its really al based on player preference so if your more comfortable with your play style keep it up and dont let anyone change your mind. Best way to get better is to experiment with all builds and weap ok nys to find your perfect build. It took me to level 180 to figure my build and I'm still making small adjustments everyday.
---
What platform?  I’m on xBox One and would pay for Calibrated Shocks for the Excavator.
---
GT ReaperOBotO, if you can help.
---
This is kind of the reason this sub is going downhill... The negativity is as toxic as swimming in water without Rad-X.
---
Not trying to say FilthyCasuals is better...
---
But it is.
---
**Asshole Disclaimer:** I am in no way superior or better than anyone because I subscribe to a different sub-reddit.
---
It's about twice that with a long barrel, isn't it?
---
But yeah, suppressor + short barrel only works at very close range.
---
430 hours and I would pay again. you can't be older than 15.
---
I think what you're seeing is probably the lighting or the sun doing something weird.
---
Might also be that something isn't loaded correctly. I remember this being an issue a while ago but me for example, I haven't encounted this issue (yet).
---
Also, I get your frustration. I thought the same when I played Fallout 4 but nope.
---
Thanks!!! But PS4 (and going out of town for the WE)..
---
Moddable to make them good melee weapons too. applying a beat down with a sign that says "Yo Mamma" or the like appeals to me.
---
You know I was thinking of subscribing to that but after seeing your attitude... No thanks.
---
I wish more people would keep an open mind. Like in its core it's a great game, just needs some TLC. People act like Bethesda is the devil for releasing it. Sure they could have fixed some of these issues. My main issue is the looting bug. This drives me up a wall. 
---
Yeah I miss it as well, but I recognize that there's no chance it will be implemented in an online game. It would just make it way too easy to acquire everything too quickly, and that's against bethesda's best interest, and against the interest of keeping people engaged.
---
It's a fine line of balance keep the grind at a level that limits your growth so that it isn't too easy to acquire things, but also where it is not too frustrating. Few games get this right.
---
but, this one was different. Military uniform, full gear, and a heavy backpack. A light, pulsed red, slowly. As Arch leaned down to check the backpack he heard a faint
---
If I'm jumping to Harper's Ferry to sell stuff, I might as well jump to Venture first for the chances of those Rare Armor and Mod Plans all over that place.
---
And if I'm going to Venture, it'd be a waste not to have a piece of Tech Data on me... cause more potential for rare items.
---
All about Efficiency too.
---
I'm always a dick.....but you know when it becomes personal I become the dick goblin.....hahahahahaha
---
They are true.. it doesn't matter if you love the game or not, from a logical stand point, the game is a mess. Bethesda is a mess when it comes to this game. 
---
I love Bethesda, have for years and years now, but FO76 was hot garbage upon release and Bethesda has done close to nothing to try and fix that. You can keep crying about how your opinion is right but it isn't, and no amount of internet bashing or Reddit down voting will change that, man. Like enjoy the game if you want, no problem, but don't defend it when it so blatantly needs work. That's how you keep a shitty game shitty. Call out it's flaws every chance you can until they fix it. 
---
Yup. I’m 130 and I’m figuring things out too.
---
Ok, don't.  LMAO.
---
I would like to provide a counter on a couple of points. With regards to parroting (thank you by the way, I had forgotten the term), I direct you to the second part of the definition.
---
 without understanding it or thinking about its meaning 
---
You are correct in your assertion that u/FourHourTour was parroting *if* we ***assume*** that he did not understand, nor even consider the meaning of your post. This is a common theme amongst online communications, given the lack of availability for immediate response, in which assumptions are relied upon to reach conclusions. This is no fault of the concluder, rather a natural gap in information caused by the online realm. Given a lack of immediate knowledge, a person can only make assumptions, rather than base conclusions on factual information. Therefore, there is no *fault* in your assumption; however, there is potential for *error* that must be accounted for. *I* personally made the assumption that he did understand your original statement, and chose to use a parroting-*like* method to make a counter-argument. Without factual understanding of the commenters state of mind at the time of posting, all that can be made is assumptions. And this has led to a difference in conclusions.
---
With regard to your statement of my "falling for it", you are making the assumption that the post changed my frame of mind, which it did not. I have consistently believed, much as OP has stated, that fault lies on both sides of the polarization.    
---
I also take exception to the use of the term "false equivalence," particularly the word "false." To this point, no evidence has been presented to show u/FourHourTour's assertion as false; rather, you have relied on discrediting the post based upon a conclusion based upon an assumption. As I have already discussed why assumptions cannot draw definitive conclusions. Lacking a definitive conclusion, your argument to discredit the original commentor is unsupported, and therefore purely opinion. Which you are entitled to.
---
In answer to your final questions, I never had any desire to dismiss, nor even discount, your original post. I believe that both you and u/FourHourTour are correct. Blame lies upon both sides for shutting out the other. It is important that all opinions, as long as they are useful and not simply hostile, be made available for consideration. This will allow the general population to consider points that had not considered previously, and potentially form new opinions.
---
That's real survival right there lol
---
I paid 39.99 . And having played so many early access games on steam, im meh about playing unfinished games. Thats the trend these days. But no thanks for letting me know something i already know.
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted for this, as it's true, but hey, Reddit.
---
And yes, the game is the same, as are the markets...same items, same prices. If you're a mere player &amp; wish to trade anything but "god tier" items, you either get ignored, or some rando will take the time to comment about how "trash" your sale items are. It's sad. Wish there was a trade spot for "the rest of us". *shrugs*
---
 Was there every fucking day from level 13 till recently when he stopped farming at level 50. Had a place just up on the cliffs above Watoga as his purpose was to farm the Hand made Rifle.
---
 The place is a fucking cake walk.
---
Finally somebody else who gets it.
---
I can do that. RAre you on right now?
---
Dude, Plenty of people play without major issues, and don't need a box of tissues for their bawling.  Deal with it.
---
I play it just to make you mad.
---
xD I try.
---
If I remember correctly you can buy the plan in whitespring 
---
Hmm well that's good to know. I've never even got close to that. 😂

I'm staying subbed just in case any big news hits, but i don't really participate or care for the most part. Haven't played the game since december. 
---
do u feel better u got that off ur chest?
---
Similar thing happened to me capturing the lakeside cabins. The last dot for the enemy was on the other side of the river across from the nuka cola plant.
---
An exterminator's sign with "FLY SWATTER" written on it.
---
Really tho!
---
Underrated comment right here.
---
Go the the map.
---
Go to game setting.
---
Turn on Pacifist mode so you don't accidently flag for a bounty or pvp.
---
Wiki says that is with the long barrel not 100% sure though. Suppressor has a -30 for range whatever that means.
---
I'm not having luck with lever actions. Maybe I'm alone in this, but handmade seems much better? 
---
im there almost everyday..lol its not at the weapons vendor..but maybe the other ones? i will check
---
i basically just stay in whitesprings all the time
---
Because we like to protect ourselves from the outside world /s
---
woah this is a real thing? That's epic 
---
Go to the store and buys some condoms and do that everyday within no time you'll have a bunch of rubber
---
PREACH IT BROTHER
---
The problem is that the game handles these as items, rather than simple quest flags. It would be much easier for the game to just run a check "Has player interacted with Note X?" If yes, display the contents of that note in the note section. There is no reason for the game to make it possible to have multiple copies of a specific note/key.  
---
The same goes for crafting materials. Instead of the game needing to keep track of 1000 steel scrap all as individual items with weight, just make them weightless and have them count as currency that can only be used for crafting. We have the bulk recipes if we need to turn crafting things back into items, but there is no need for basic crafting materials to count against an artificial inventory constraint meant to limit the number of items the game needs to take care of.
---
Lever action rifles are rare drops in general, but the plan is easy to buy since patch 5 and you can build them from level 15. Better start scrapping.
---
Absolutely. This would be very beneficial for both player trading and vendor trading 
---
You're the toxic troll
---
Good thing we don't have to deal with you over at r/fo76filthycasuals 
---
R u ok
---
I have plenty of complaints and criticisms of the game, but I also have a lot of good things to say about it and have had at least a few hundred hours of uninterrupted fun without issue.
---
Who are these "everyone" you speak ok.  Workshops are pvp.  You are the only one i see who cant figure that out.
---
How long before all the haters join casual cause they got tired of stroking each other off and miss having some kind of meaningful conversation about the game?  
---
I feel you're sentiment though,  I unsubbed from Fallout and almost considered doing the same here but I still have faith that people will chill out. 
---
My favorite people are the ones with 500+ hrs complaining they don't have enough stuff to do and they feel ripped off   . Haha bro you put fucking 500hrs into this game.  Clearly you've gotten a lot out of it . Take a break.  It's all good .
---
I blow up all the cars at white springs.  Explosions everywhere. 
---
Fallout 76: Directed by Michael Bay. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer
---
Thank you for the support. However, I would ask that we not fall prey to the *Tu Quoque* fallacy. I do not believe there was necessarily hostile intent, rather a well meaning attempt based upon a flawed argument.
---
The closest thing to that we have are the quest reward weapons but sadly unless you wait till level 50 you miss out on getting a real use from them
---
Oh yea, I deleted everything in the documents folder too. Tried that first actually, and thought it had fixed the problem because the game loaded, but it turned out that it had just default to borderless window mode when it remade the prefs file. Thank you though.
---
What kind of stability do you expect in an apocalyptic world? You'll have fun if you learn to dance in the nuclear rain.
---
Yeah check the black powder shop
---
In PA most go 2 handed melee, out of PA my instigating Deathclaw hits like a Mother Trucker.
---
word, have a good time
---
Just agreeing with you, and pointing out it makes the grind more fun to help lower levels out. run with them, like this instance, or let them tag along for exp and loot.  
---
I tell them to chuck a molotov in to the crowd once I have aggroed them all. one shot credit for the whole mob.
---
Uhh... I post more there than here, and I am making fun of the toxic members of this sub.... Try to keep up?
---
I'm in a fairly active Brotherhood if Steel group. We have members on all platforms 
---
When's the last time a game came out that was finished and didn't need updates and patches in the past 16 years? I'll wait.
---
Also I feel sorry for you that you still don't know the difference between your and you're. 
---
Perhaps, they could have a cap limit per given amount of time.
---
Are you?
---
Well, sadly there's not much chance of having specific companions in that sense because it would be too bizarre to have everyone followed around by the same character, but it does seem to me that, a la "Automatron," you could have people building their own companions without it being immersion-breaking! 
---
I think I've seen the plan at one of my common stops, I believe Harper's.
---
That has been annoying me for probably over a month. You're lucky if you think it's a new bug.
---
Would you mind testing with the "VATS Matrix Overlay" mod for your helmet, I've been running with that forever since I'm scared of the targeting hud bugs, and I don't feel like I have much of a Fusion core drain, and I use VATS pretty constantly.
---
I found tons of liberators in the Mama Dochia or however you spell it 
---
As others have mentioned, we are planning a large balance patch the will address durability and utility of Energy Weapons. We have also updated our [Known Issues list](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am3agv/fallout_76_known_issues_and_feedback/) to reflect this is coming. 
---
They've said in the past it's something they're working on.
---
That's an interesting point and I think what you suggest makes sense! It would be nice for that to be implemented along with having them revisit this massive fusion core consumption when using VATS. We can only put things like this forward and hope for the best!
---
Hes right you can put the heated super sledge mod on it also look at the yellow handle with a trigger, all rise is a super sledge
---
We're looking into this issue. 
---
yes, this is the reason stop me to play this game. 
---
Thanks for the info, very helpful.
---
I would still much rather have this info be available in-game, and I don’t understand why it isn’t. 
---
Thank you, finally someone with common sense
---
Thats sad your whole life revolves around how to say your properly.. What a loser. I see why u play 76 lol
---
Where do u get the steelworker's outfit?
---
&gt; franchise yet its the most sold fallout
---
Most sold ≠ Best Game
---
Get good or alt f4, uninstall life.
---
Yes the newly added plans are great, i unlocked power armors and a bunch of mods such as jetpack and shock, but still my speed of looting and selling way outpaced the spending (I won’t buy stuff I never use). Are you saying if you’re above level 50 you can sell unlimited amounts? Vendor limits affect me as well at level 280+ (200 caps per day per vendor). Now sometimes I just login and sell stuff my mules carry and be done for the day lol. 
---
&gt;Your being served shit and your happy to eat it, I dunno how you can go on enjoying your shit sandwich, I don't wanna have to each your shit sandwiches because your scared about complaing. That's why we complain, because if we don't, they'll keep getting to do it.
---
You came in a little hot for someone that wants to have a reasonable conversation, my dude. Are you sure you're actually happy people are enjoying the game? Because it sounds to me like you are angry with people for playing the game because you think it doesn't meet industry (read: your) standards. You can't have it both ways.
---
Workshops are pvp areas it's not griefing
---
All good. We can keep trying to find a solution tho.
---
It's also normal that it does that. It's the default setting for the game. There's also a bug where you select a Window mode, select a preset and it sets it back to Borderless.
---
Setting it to Fullscreen, going back in the menu, re-entering and then picking whatever preset you want works.
---
I found one once inside a dead body in the Glass Caverns. I think it was a level 50 one. 
---
 My crafter did Mayor For a Day at level 22, by herself with little trouble. 
---
 I just want another cool from your lame ass, is all.
---
Make the assumption that all Legendary robots will explode as well.
---
Absolutely I always so the same and I make sure that they get their XP as well.
---
The story kind of reminds me of the old Dave Chappelle Show skit where the ladies baby is locked in the car and the crack head runs up and busts her window out and steals her car radio.
---
Mkay, I’m not reading that. You’re here to argue for the sake of arguing. I don’t play that. It’s real simple. Fourwhatsit was only here to mock and troll. And now you are here for an unnecessary debate. Goodbye.
---
Pretty much are playing the same card as you're accuser in a round about way. Sorry I agree mostly but it's funny how contradicting that is.
---
I don't play atm but im keeping a eye to see if improvements or content will bring me back.
---
I was in an SBQ raid last night and this happened. We could all still chat with voice, just the game completely frozen. never unfroze, could not loot once we got back to that server after several tries. 
---
On that note: Come on! if you have an active event quest and disconnect, put us back on that server!! Since we all disconnected, it put groups together on whatever server the first team member landed on instead of the server we left.
---
I think your doctor should have a cream for that.
---
Strange in numbers (yes I used &amp;, but I’m stupid)
---
All 5 pieces of CA have +1 STR,
---
Shielded BOS uniform for +2 STR, and (more important) +3 END, I usually pick up another point with my melee weapon.
---
No negative mutations for STR.
---
Adds up to 23 for me.
---
I can go over all the other effects and my reasoning behind them if you want, my CA is all two star.
---
I don’t know if this is relevant but my speed demon mutation started glitching on me last night after the servers were back up. I was normie jumping again for a while. The horror. Anyway, I never had that happen before last night.
---
That sounds like me but I'm a higher than 107. And not to add fuel to the fire but I have two of those things and they are both 3 stars.  What platform you on?
---
Very cool! Dig the temple theme.
---
When I was farming, it was always the masses/fluids that were my bottleneck. Flux is everywhere, but with whitesprings being the way it is now it's getting difficult to farm the other materials needed. 
---
Oh, I agree. Having an established character become your companion is almost entirely out of the question and was just a fun thought. Using Rose as a means of introducing Automatron style robotic followers though has real merit and I think you should feel good about your idea. 
---
Ironically, that's what the story of the game (insofar as there's one) is about.  
---
If it's not legendary with a really nice effect, or only a few levels away and a weapon you plan on using, scrap it.
---
Weapons are heavy, and normal ones are easy to come by.  Hoarding them will make it hard for you to collect and store junk you want for crafting later.
---
Lever Gun plans are always available now and relatively cheap.  Won't take you long to get one at your level and craft/scrap a few for some nice mods.
---
I get to about 12k and then inevitably find a plan I want somewhere. I also fast travel a lot lol. 
---
This isn't the "Only Good Things and Happy Thoughts About Fallout 76 Subreddit"
---
I think you're thinking of the Revolutionary Sword, unless you just got really, really lucky one time.
---
Those are posts i subbed to this Subreddit
---
Don't complain here!  But but what did you just do?  Redditors...
---
I had this happen at the SBQ yesterday.
---
Made me double slchecknall my perk cards to be sure.
---
True. But there is a thing called Constructive Criticism. Nobody needs a head count for every player who wants to quit because Bethesda bumbles things harder than Jacques Clouseau
---
Where can i find a normal megasloth?
---
You can find the scorched version in a nuke zone or if a scorchbeast crop dusts any other kind of mothman.
---
I don't think he meant your guide was negative...I believe he was referring to his own comments.
---
I sold an instigating +25% fire rate for 1k
---
This bug happens sometimes when you have multiple sets of unequipped armor in your inventory.
---
For example:
---
If you have two pieces of heavy leather armor right arm gear on you
---
when you put on or fast travel with your power armor on there is a pretty good chance that your power armor right arm will become unequipped.
---
its been happening since launch i think. 
---
Good find. Thanks for the tip!
---
But turrets are completely useless against players unless the player doesnt know what they are doing. If anything they need to have higher level turrets or something 
---
Steal a bit from BeamNG Drive:
---
#NO
---
#TEXTURE
---
&gt; I'm not quite at the SBQ point (undergeared, a little under-leveled)
---
I started by hanging around the perimeter and tanking the trash mobs so the big boys can focus on the queen. I have seen someone as low as 24 kiting them around and still being useful.  
---
Stay out of their way, keep the mobs off them, and everyone is happy you were there.  
---
Get a few shots in on the queen so you get full credit and loot rights(once they fix this issue). Just don't try to focus on the queen. You can't hurt her enough to matter, so focus on taking out the trash.
---
yeah thats what hes thinking..that is always there most of the time
---
Criticism is fine. I’m referring to solely the “games bad, I’m leaving” posts. Maybe I didn’t make that so clear
---
I agree completely.  Both because you have no indication that you've found them all, but also because some are arbitrarily not achievable through scrapping, which isn't particularly fair.
---
the grenades are bulky and fairly heavy so is that launcher....
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **2nd Cakeday** Keener_7! ^(hug)

i usually go at least once daily..i will try there and just server-hop
---
Unfortunately I don't have that mod for any of my power armor units so I can't test it out. However, considering what that mod is supposed to do once installed and equipped, I don't think it would change anything with regards to this VATS fusion core consumption issue. I'll see if I can get lucky and find that mod at any of the vendors soon so I can give it a shot, though! I'll post my findings if/when I have a chance to do that.
---
-raises hand- I'm not overencumbered with the 600 limit. I welcome 800 tho.
---
I've never had invincible enemies issues. What are you using to fight them? Gun? Melee?
---
Like others have said, drop any junk besides ballistic fiber and maybe screws, aluminum, and adhesive. I'd throw in there dump any non-legendary armor then  just go throw your junk in your Stash and come back to grab the armor (because you can sell it for dinero) and finish the fight
---
You can't farm resources such as things you pick off shelves, but you can farm resources from animals, so if you know a area where a particular animal spawns like a deathclaw or bear, it will respawn every time and you can farm off those animals. Requires you kill the animals hence playing the game, but you can get resources that way.
---
Just unsubbed here and subbed over there, ty
---
Just thought it was cool with the "dark theme", sorry :(
---
Now that you say it. Right. All good though. Nothing happened. :)
---
I still see why you'd ask that though.
---
Performance doesn't seem like one of their main focuses.
---
Yeah, I definitely feel like I *earned* the net total of three upvotes the post has gotten in the past three hours! :D 
---
Yeah maybe budget isn't the issue. Maybe there could be more powerful ones, much more expensive to craft and repair. Maybe some with armor piercing etc.
---
Yeah? Well, like, that's just your opinion, man.
---
I think this is the best suggestion.
---
It is the headlamps, and I think it happened the same time they changed the Tactical headlamp name to Mothman Headlamp.
---
While you're there you can check for marine tac helm and wet suit plans that can spawn in the building nearby.  Not positive that's where I've seen the plan, but I think so.
---
I don't think the pvp works the way people think it does.
---
1)Pacifist mode protects others FROM you. This way you don't hit someone with a stray bullet and accidently engage in PvP.
---
2) Once you go to claim a workshop a disclaimer pops up and says something like "doing this may cause others to engage you in Pvp to claim your worshop". By hitting yes and accepting to spend caps you signed up for pvp and others can kill you whenever they see fit. Not on your time but if and when THEY feel. 
---
I don't like pvp myself so unless it's a small server or something, I typically stay away from worships. Pvp problem solved. Maybe when pvp servers/modes come out, maybe pve'ers can claim workshops but until then it is what it is. If I want a workshop then I have to expect a level 267 likely duper to come along and try to take it. 
---
That’s an interesting opinion
---
I've never been able to trigger it. It seems to just pop up when its ready. I've seen it show up when no one is close on map.

I must not have had that mod &gt;~&lt; Getting mods for that are next to impossible if you don’t want to server hop or burn through all your junk. I just assumed it could only be auto
---
Here, here! Your last sentence is exactly why I thought I'd try bringing this to the attention to those who might be able to fix it. :)
---
Like rocket turrets are decent but all you have to do it cut there power source. I lost count of how many times I have had to do that in Whitesprings because some fool put there monstrosity of a turret tower by the golf club
---
That's one of my feral ghoul farming methods...Oh how the ferals fly..
---
If caps are useless why have arbitrary limits in place? If it makes no difference just let people have an unlimited amount. Also if you actually build stuff often and play the game alot you need alot of junk to build and repair with. 
---
Well shit, I'll have to look into those cards. I've never really cared about cap stashes (or even the vendors to be honest), I've always used the runs to farm XP and random loot. 
---

I had that occur before the mid jan update.

Never found a fix

I like this idea, but I despise Rose’s voice.
---
oh yeah..thats why i server hop..does the same building have the helmet plans? thats the only one i didnt get yet..or maybe the chest piece plan too
---
Mate i have done the queen probably more than 50 times now first time i died
---
I just don’t see why you’re being pretentious about it. Congrats on being the ultimate pve fo76 badass.
---
Crap you’re right
---
Vats doesn't negate damage drop off.
---
I used a pump with 70ish range and i had to be very close (for a vats build) to do much damage with it
---
Doesnt change my point. Why carry that much junk?  Its literally the only thing you can loss if you die
---
My buddy found the wet suit and the helm in 3 hops 2 days ago. That swine.
---
Yep that's it. When the mutation isn't working the game has me in [caution] even though I should be hidden.
---
Yeeup, bugthesda always fuckin with the legit players, but not the illegitimate players.
---
I should have never picked up this game
---
You arn't pc by any chance?
---
I didn't expect anything either, but  I don't feel like I have to much of a drain, but I suppose it could be anything, even just that the game doesn't use your lowest power core first, so maybe i just have a bunch of low-charge ones left and don't realize it?
---
Yeah I don’t really care what you think.  It’s not my job to teach you time value of money.  
---
I didn’t make the environment or set the rules.
---
I’m saying There’s no money in it for me to fight some asshat 70 plus levels taller then me.
---
If this griefer is kicking your ass, and rifling through your pockets for loose change &amp; mats, that’s on you for not understanding what his weaknesses are, or how to overcome yours.

---
Heh, love that. Along the same lines as OP with a hint of good old fashioned "fuck it, that'll do".
---
Just think, that the first online Fallout game, meant to create and foster a community more than any of the other games, has initially divided the Fallout fanbase and then proceeded to divide the 76 fanbase. Pretty impressive.
---
Creams are topical for skin not for the mouth!!!!
---
Lol mate i was farming, do you go dump your stuff after every server hop when farming, if you have done a nuke there is lots of loot down there, lead, steel alu, do a couple queens you ok fo 2 weeks 
---
I feel like it fits her personality pretty well. Abrasive, aggressive and obnoxious. It feels like good casting to me! 
---
Biter and Scratcher😉
---
Yes I do dump my junk or at least anything I do not wish to loss. Lol
---
It’s like this on all the gaming subreddits. We’re just getting old and curmudgeony.
---
Yes, I'm on PC. I thought it might have been lower cores being used first so I also tried carrying around all of my cores at full charge. The same drain takes place. Out of curiosity, is your experience on a VATS-heavy build? Mine is about as far down the VATS rabbit hole you can get and the drainage is c-c-c-crazy!
---
Yeah but when I spent a lot of time setting up traps and turrets in workshops, that is something I like to do, even though nobody ever comes most of the time, I have the power source hidden, and deceptive wiring criss-crossing all over the place, providing power from multiple directions etc. hehe. So I don't make it easy for them to know how to just shut it all down with one shot.
---
Obligatory why are you here then? Go do something else.
---
i have multiple wet suit plans..i have the arms and legs from that building..but i want the helmet and chest plans too lol..harpers is one of my favorite grind areas..one of my best legendary weapons is from there
---
I’d probably just destroy your whole base because caps don’t matter.
---
Thank you so much for this. 
---
If they post bail maybe.
---
Also while you’re at it please take a look at the explosive weapons as well. At the moment the grenade launchers, mini nuke and missile do just slightly more damage than a well-spec’d legendary shotgun, yet the ammos weigh 100x more. That’s why very few people use them even for the SBQ fights. 
---
:) 
---
It’s perfect casting! Just listening to her is like taking a Brillo pad to my ears.
---
Yeah I don't see any indicator of that.   So your saying that there are players a day after having all their massive stacks of popular weapons and armor removed,  re-increasing their stack counts with duping on those same items.? Find that hard to believe, and pretty stupid given that Bethesda has the capability of identifying the stack counts (removing is another story, requires downtime for the sweep).
---
For workshops I can capture them without the turrets shooting me so I dont bother with them. Dont have to repair them afterwards that way lol
---
Because he's a troll. He frequents these parts trying to get traction for his "feelings being slighted" by Bethesda movement. And if anyone doesn't parrot his gripes, he calls you a fanboy. Oh, the horror! As far as his "movement" goes, I've had bowel movements that made more sense than he does. "Could care less". . . ? Oh, and btw my post history says HI! FGT  ; )  
---
I haven't played since December, and nice job deflecting my question because you don't have an answer that invalidates the entire point of your shitpost.🤣
---
I'm curious, how does it feel to be so irrelevant that you have the need to come here and post the weakest shit when it's an obvious cry for attention? Everything okay at home timmy?
---
From vendors sure, but you never should buy them there. Players sell them for like 200 caps. 
---
I'll ask him tonight if he wants to trade/sell the helm plan if you get sick of grinding rngesus for it.
---
 You are giving bad advice. With any starter Leather Armor the bots do very little to you. Assultrons are rare and concentrated along the edges.
---
 Any level 10+ can operate perfectly well in Watoga. You can go to the Station very easily and I just walk across town with my low levels to visit Phoenix, but I do know the place well. I used to sneak around the back but its not needed.
---
this is definitely the most dramatic gaming sub ive been on lol
---
Rocket powered heavy fire ax with stun packs with 90% weight reduction, we have all the components, just need to bring them together. 
---
Vendor items you dont have to bulk, drop the rest.   If you dont use shotguns you can bulk and sell the other scrap.  If you do, the plastic is way more valuable than using it to bulk with.
---
Sounds similar to the opening scene from Old School. They say true love is blind, until you catch the early flight home from San Diego and two strangers pop out of the bathroom blindfolded looking to tag team your wife. 
---
Hmm maybe you haven't seen how I defend my workshops.
---
Perfect..thx
---
The handmade plans are there now for 1863 caps..i went on the market sub saying im not paying that and someone sold me them for 700
---
I've found multiple, and honestly they're awful. Not worth the time to find. They can miss at point blank range, and have the reload time of a typical black powder pistol. Also, while they fire a wide spread, they benefit from gunslinger, not shotgunner.
---
 Mate got over 500 hours in it, but i dont know if you know this when you do the queen you are all in a team, you cant harm each other, all im saying it is the wasteland but if you do quests together there should be an unspoken rule
---
He's currently consulting his Thesaurus. . . He'll be back with his reply once he figures out how to fix the fact that he stated that he "Could care less" in his title.
---
I would be interested to see it. However I have sat a foot away from a shotgun turret while capturing one and it didn't shoot because I'm sneaky lol
---
My dad needs a job!
---
It happens sometimes when you're switching servers. I started Back to Basic, then got bored and wandered off for a while. A day later my uniform and helmet were gone and my quest had reset to finding a helmet and uniform.
---
I've been looking for almost a week.   Still no luck. 
---
I'd absolutely love to help lower level players but they all run from me :( 
---
Are you saying that a player with 15 Perception can see another player crouched with the chameleon effect active, the chameleon mutation or a stealthboy?  
---
Anyway, we made a few tests and when me and my friend were both crouched with chameleon, he could see only me, the other player was invisible for him.  
---
Collect? I *build* those!
---
Oh yeah, this wouldn't be abused at all or turn it into real life politics/s
---
They have a lot more than 15 my guy
---
I  * think* I can make the helmets, if I can, I'll pm you late tonight for a trade.
---
I do mostly melee, but I use VATS constantly to target and find the mobs, my old eyes can't see them as well anymore, but vats highlights and points me in the right direction, so I believe I am a heavy user, my AP is always running out in vats mode, so I don't think I could use it much more! 
---
I usually use concentrated fire 3 as well, I don't know if that's a positive or a negative.
---
Hes saying it's another great patch and hes enjoying the game. If you are taking that as passive aggressive then you a clearly projecting something
---
Man, that just feels criminal. I scrounge every bit of steel I can for ammo and basically never have extra
---
Make sure it doesn't delete the duplicate treasure maps.  Those are great!!
---
I don't know if there's too few weapons, or if weapon diversity is lost because: 
---
1. So much damage comes from perks that many weapons feel weak without perks (obviously excepting powerful meta legendaries). I think this is probably good though to keep all characters from feeling same-same. 
---
2. Many of the weapons are rare or don't appear until late in the game. 
---
3. Some weapons are so weak that you'll only use them for a laugh (e.g. chainsaw) 
---
4. Some weapons break too fast or chew through ammo too fast to be used often (e.g. flamer)
---
I'm eager to see more weapons added, but I hope they also adjust existing weapons to give them more of a role, even if a secondary role. 
---
You are right. Whenever i find myself responding to a post or comment that made me want to just lash out, by the time im done typing, i usually just discard my response. This happens when i dont think it through before i dedicate to something reddit wise. I always feel like " wtf r u doing, delete that shit u dumbass". 
---
Try r/starwarsbattlefront
---
So Reddit.... not sure if that would go well
---
You're welcome. Let others know if it all works how you want. :)
---
You should mention your platform - ps4,xbox,pc?
---
Age?
---
Gamer tag etc
---
If you think people posting something to the effect of "I'm never shopping here again" is new, you are either showing your own age or looking at the past with rose colored glasses. 
---
maybe your armor is defective? After all it is a post-apocalyptic wasteland... :)
---
Yeah. Post plan rework the vendors are too expensive. I had made some cap reselling vendor plans but you just can't now. Only remarket for vendor gear are some Grahm plans and x01 mods. And even then you'd be lucky to double down.
---
Thanks,  I'll hit that up. 
---
The loot/reward system needs to be completely revamped. You can kill a fat ghoul with one strike and land a three star legendary item, while killing a scorchbeast takes far more effort but the chance for a legendary item is absolutely ZERO unless you do the queen. It’s a great game but certain parts of it are just absurd. 
---

I will! I'll get home in about 9 hours and will try it at that point. Does the fullscreen vs borderless make a big difference? I prefer borderless because I have 3 monitors and use the others for things like having the wiki up and it's a pain to switch in fullscreen mode.
---
Holy shit someone from this sub just complimented something Bethesda did. An upvote for you sir!
---
Lucky man, I’ve been hunting the plan for yeeeaaarsss. Where’d you get yours?

Sleep time.

Unfortunately, the wiki's only seem to have about 1/3rd of the various plans and recipes so far.
---
Well yes, in game they do, but clearly lorewise there would have to be an explanation as to why the ghouls have not been wiped out.
---
considering that games are made out money and not feel good bux i would say that most sold game is the best game
---
Im on Xbox one
---
Yeah they are very lacking in content right now
---
Use more adhesive next time.
---
I agree wholeheartedly. But you can't expect anyone to care about your opinion if you're going to dog them for sharing theirs. It's a forum, a place for people to share whatever they choose. Gotta learn to skip over the posts you don't want anything to do with. Not always easy, im still learning aswell. I figured out through pm's that i was arguing with a 14 y/o about something in The Division and realised i needed to change my behavior
---
Where in Michigan? I’m from Jackson.

Cool idea

Because a saboteur reprogrammed the robots to attack humans. Do the mayor for a day side quest and you will learn the story.

Lol rust has this feature i think?  This woule be so cool i would love it
---
I've gone into the nuke zone once (got the 1000 hazmat suit, so really a glass cannon in there), and poked around.  It's certainly doable, I may give that a try.
---
Hopefully a few of the legendary corpses actually stick around to get looted.
---
The hoarding of currency in a game doesn't make sense, what are you so afraid of that your 25k caps keeps you safe from? Is your PA going to be Repo'd if you can't make the payments? Your never going to get a lifetime achievement award for most Caps in Fallout76.
---
Bah - Humbug.
---
No need to be upset about the bounty that was all on you could have made a trade post here and sold something 
---
Hmm, I am gonna go with the idea that Fallout 76’s fanbase was fractured from the start, due to it being a much different Fallout game. You got your classic Fallout fans who were not scared off by the multiplayer and possible PvP, and lack of NPCs, and all the different things Bethesda was trying out here. Then you got the people coming just for the new things, and then you got the people coming just for what those new things might create. After the controversy you got the seekers of such controversy “I want to see this dumpster fire for myself! Ooooh so burny~~~!” And so on.
---
I definitely feel that I’d love to see more of s difference between guns and melee than just dps and I’d love to see more of the cosmetic side addressed so we can all look unique in the wasteland instead of the typical modded shotgun and heating coil super sledge. 
---
The m79 launcher is 7.8 lbs, as big as a short rifle or shotgun, and the ammo weighs next to nothing with the perk cards. Maybe your thinking of the auto-grenade launcher, which, yes.. that is very bulky
---
No prob. If you find a pink workers outfit there feel free to give me a deal on it. 
---
I feel like the combat knife as more range the a suppressed shotgun lol
---
haha thx
---
It's all fun and games until some asshole puts the n word on there. 
---
This is why I travel round in power armour with marsupial and a jetpack. For the soul reason that I can land in near a lower level and lay stuff to waste with a rocket powered sledge. Drop of a gun and/or chems then litterally fly away.
---
I even managed to quote iron man at one point, landed down, hit a super mutant, said "Nice work kid" then flew away. If only it had been a robot instead of a super mutant it would have been perfect. 
---
I've tried this hundreds of times of the course of a couple of weeks and never got the flatwoods monster. I gave up. I did get a mothman twice though. I have been playing since the beta and have yet to see a flatwoods monster.

“MAGA”, (make Appalachia great again”
---
Exactly, they should atleast be upgradeable like the blade of Bastet and how hard would it be to give them a cool unique texture?
---
I would also like to tape knives to the end.
---
What platform?
---
Yeah we didn't have to grow up with vote manipulation and fake accounts posting here for the first time getting 11 upvotes in a few minutes.
---
I agree and uninstalled the game.  I will be very apprehensive when it comes time to purchase the next fallout game.  I feel like I got duped with this one.  
---
Assassin sentinel armor shouldn’t still work if you are jumping, should only be when you are standing still. They sit there and jump up and down and are darn near impossible to kill which causes frustration
---
I would love a max level perfect storm or Somerset special 
---
IIRC- a power armor frame gives the radiation protection and a decent armor boost as well. better than naked spaceman. 
---
A lot of queen killers are placing the nuke to spawn her, but puts the fort outside the blast zone so they can kill her in peace there. 
---
I thought you don’t spawn inside a location? Why don’t you drop stuff while being outside?
---
You can find 2(?) Swords in the secret base in the pipe behind Mama Dolche's, and lots of liberators around there. It's where I got my plans.

Go play red dead 2 instead

Sorry - should have been clear: I'm talking *point blank* range here. I can smell their breath.  ;\^)
---
Nice.
---
Yes, this is pretty much the difference. The reason why is because to put it very simply but a bit wrong: If you're in fullscreen, all strength goes to the application and background stuff isn't being cared for.
---
If that makes sense.
---
What if you get wanted by another man?
---
Duping will never die!
---
TLDR: I don't like the way reddit works.  But I still come here.....
---
Great Scott. It just dawned upon me that this is true. But I haven't stumbled on any such nonsense so I guess.... it's all good?
---
Many people do not understand the word Theory - 
---
" A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not "guesses" but reliable accounts of the real world."
---
so in fact it is both theory and truth.
---
Maybe... although I don't think I can get any closer without being behind them.  ;\^)
---
Yesterday... All my troubles seemed so far away
---
I'm just wondering where this is going. Genuinely confused. Is there any real points in this post other than anger and you expect downvotes?
---
Same here, I was hoping a vault would open sooner but I guess I'll just have to wait until it does.
---
You can’t get rid of them even after the quest is done?
---
Don't.
---
There is one spot. Where is random spawn of mobs, you can have sloth that is tamable there.
---
It is on north north in mire. 
---
If you go on west from munition factory and you past around fisure site, you shoul keep your way for around minute and get to little lake with crashed vertibot in it. Thats place u are looking for.
---
I run a stealth build and stopped using shotguns all together because it just didn't work for me lol
---
Yeah, it does. I saw a pretty noticeable difference in FPS just by turning off *one* of the two extra monitors last night. Curious to see what it's like with the changes you recommended.
---
Will do.  Better safe than sorry.  
---
Non-legendary weapons, scrap it for mods. It'll save you a lot of screws and heartache later on.
---
I would only keep higher legendaries if they're something you will actually use.
---
 No r/Morrowind is very nice with people who love the game exchanging stories, pictures and generally being cool.
---
They're mentally not adults 
---
Duped items are still here, just everyone has one copy now.
---
Yes they should have done this before banning people that had stacks of items whom been banned for this when they were most likely not even the duper themselves but just looted a bag of a duper.
---
The way they’re handling things is so trash, I can’t believe this is happening in 2019
---
That is all.
---
It is definitely a sphere.  I built on a hill.  At one corner of my camp, the square next to the corner foundation (below floor 1) is fully inside the circle (visually confirmed).  At the top of my building (roof of floor 4) I decided to put a balcony (floor and defense fence as railing) I can place the floor but not the fence ("outside of build area") yet I can go build a fence on the corner block, and I can back up one square from the corner and build a fence.  
---
It's a sphere.  If it was a cylinder, then the fence would fit like it does in the surrounding squares, because at ground level that square is completely within the circle.
---
It doesn't "trigger", from my experience.  It pops up infrequently since an earlier patch and when it does, it seems to go away pretty quickly if someone doesn't go over there within a few minutes.  
---
That would took much time, same as turning on my second ps and trading with gf's acc.
---
He could atleast look. Moth*******r. Hah.
---
Players of survival games don't trust each other and factionalize. Kind of feels like everything is humming along according to plan.
---
Sounds good, I truly appreciate the offer! Someone else also sent me a private message and they might be able to hook me up with various PA mods for further testing if you can't do them yourself. As for the difference in our builds, my rifleman uses 1 point in concentrated fire and all of the VATS-related perks I can squeeze into the respective SPECIAL points. Your melee character is probably going a lot easier on their fusion cores than my VATS one because nearly everything I do is VATS-related, although I infrequently enjoy having a bit of variety and aim down my scopes - especially knowing this saves my poor cores that much longer.
---
there is a huge parking lot south east of Harper's ferry along the highway that has like 30 cars in it, my buddy was playing with a grenade rifle and just wasting 4mm grenades cause it was fun, shit exploded like mad, screen was white and and my fps dipped from 80ish to like 15 for a few seconds. it was insanity 
---
Alright.
---
Yes, well, you've got the couple of screenshots I've linked. So there definitely must be some kind of difference later. xD
---
Bugthesda bot alert
---
They think they can bully and silence criticism. They don't get it. They are killing the game and this subreddit. They are driving away everyone else so they can have this little shill fanboi echochamber all to themselves. Good for them I say. They will be the ones that pay for it in the end.
---
Nope tried to drop and it won't let me
---
That's cool. I'd love to see that one myself. Have only seen pics.
---
hell yeah. my pops went to spring arbor and i used to have some friends from the grass lake area. nice place to pop some chems and watch the grass dance lol. 
---
i live in Westland currently
---
It’s just a theory... a ~game~ theory. 
---
Wait- growing up without posting on a forum is sort of a good thing. People either enjoy the game or don’t, without feeling the need to blast a forum with their “I’m done for good!!” hyperbolic posts. ;)
---
This really depicts most of my drunken pick ups and the next morning! 
---
Nothing has changed yet, new pvp-pve content will come soon by end of feb or beginning of march.  
---
Why do people come here to ask when they can just read the effin patch notes you fluffin simpletons
---
Submit a ticket via their portal..
---
100%; a higher limit per vendor ~500, plus any things bought add those caps to the vendor. Would be amazing to be able to rinse the 500, buy the plans or whatever, and then sell more junk. 
---
For me personally I use the vendors as a weight reduction plan. 
---
-
---
Oh and being able to sell/scrap ammo. 
---
Here is my fast travel route (i dont have access to enclave bunker yet):
---
* my camp is sort of near WS..if i fast travel to the station its only 9 caps
---
* pleasantville station 4 caps
---
* harpers 13 caps
---
* watoga shopping center 22 caps (ouch)
---
* watoga station (1 cap)
---
* vault 76 (free)
---
* flatwoods vendor (10 caps)
---
So..essentially i am paying 49 caps to make 1151 (1200-49) which i dont mind..for me this is the most efficient route because i tried having my camps in different areas..but since i am always in WS and it is kind of right in the middle of the map..i think this is the cheapest/most-efficient route
---
Oh hell no..
---
Hahaha - no.
---
Let's be real, this game is basically a dress up simulator for men already. Pretty close to TF2 imo lol.
---
Go play alone.
---
Scorchbeast Queen dropped the Prime Receiver Plan for it, bought the Gatling Laser plan from Vendor Bot Phoenix.
---
I don't want any cheaters back. They had a lot of time to stop, but they did not. They knew what they did was wrong. Unbanning would only make Beth weaker in the eyes of the cheaters.
---
One item or none, who cares, this should have been done since the first dupe exploit has been found.
---
Yes, in many cases people that have not participated in duping have also been banned for picking stuff up, totally unfair that they have been banned.
---
Well, as we have seen, not only the way of handling dupers is trash... Disappointment with handling of everything in bethesda this year has just left a huge disappointment with the community. I haven't seen a single positive review about fallout or bethesda on youtube for month, such a pity.
---
Maybe the community is full of bots or Chinese looters after all the real players quit
---
What platform are you on?
---
I saw a couple youtube videos and decided to wait until level 50 to get the maxed weapon but it was crap for me. I got to the roof, the timer started and then a scorchbeast came and the robots would spawn and then walk right off the side of the roof shooting at the beast. I even tried getting up in their face and they just went around me so they could walk off the roof. It was the dullest five minutes I've endured in the game. I didn't have to kill a single robot up there, and they moved so quickly for the edge that I could get them to half health before the dropped over the side. 
---
I wouldn’t lolz
---
For some reason it won’t even show that it’s loading the item or whatever.   Just take the item that’s there and come back and  the Legendary drop will appear.  Had it happened to me quite a few times now. 
---
lol, that clock is a keeper :D
---
Lol so you killed him? Way to pay negativity forwards. Just use a microphone and ask.
---
I can hear it without clicking, awesome.
---
Then how would I be able to kill people and then leave an 'I.O.U. Toilet paper' note in their goody bag?
---
Thanks, never knew that. I'll keep it in mind.
---
Its actually matching the armor reduces it by 50%. FO4 used the exact same armor system. Then you hit the sharp to diminishing changes on either end of damage dealt.
---
Yeah, definitely. I'm excited to give it a try :D I'll let you know how it turns out later.
---
Cheaters are back already, wake up. Dupers are not cheaters, but rather exploiters, that can both benefit and harm the game. Valuable feedback can be provided to the developer from exploiters, but Bethesda chose to keep closed to improvement suggestions and fixes.
---
What do?
---
Everytime I see a highly upvoted thread it's some drama queen seeking attention. And because he does it by insulting Bethesda devs, the r/games and r/fallout lurkers jump on it like locusts. The same people declaring weekly that they have quit and that just this thing was the straw that broke the camel's back. I'd love to see a statistic of how many people in these threads actually own the game. I'd guess that at least half of them don't... 
---
Next time I level up I know what perk Im getting
---
Gender, location, sexual preference?
---
Yis. Til then. :)
---
Yeah, the moderator's job is a thankless one.  But honestly there are way too many duplicate posts on the same issue.
---
I would never volunteer to be a moderator.
---
Happened to me too when I first got there, even worse is my paper bag got dropped into an unreachable gap so I couldn’t even get my junk back. Basically you just need to move as fast as you can to the nearest defendable location where the scorched can come at you from one direction, that way if you have enough ammo and your gun doesn’t break, you can gradually take them all out. If you’re surrounded then you’re very dead. I’m on PS4 so if you need I can help you out. 
---
Wouldn't have been so bad if the one you needed was on top. But nope, you had to scroll through 10 pages of keys to find the one with the marker.
---
I was stuck in that stupid trailer forever trying to lookup online the last clue. I was like "yes, I have the stupid keycard, and that and that.....I HAVE THEM ALL"
---
lmao yeah im on pc
---
She has seen some shit. Leave something to work with for lvl 200
---
The usefulness of flux seems to be in opposing ratio to its availability. Yellowcake is everywhere - and is the one raw flux that you can actually use, as far as I know. Cobalt, crimson, and flourescent, I also have plenty of - rarely, if ever, use them. Violet, on the other hand, is nowhere to be found in Whitesprings, and it can be hard to see around the trees in the Mire, and you have the scorched hordes and other higher level mobs to watch out for. Plus, that's the one you need for the most commonly desired underarmor linings and ultracite receivers and ammo.
---
When the fusion core charge bug got nerfed, I was worried I might need more flux to craft cores, but without farming or crafting a single one going on two weeks now, I currently have 34. And that's after blasting 2 or 3 in my explosive gatling laser during the SBQ fight this morning. (I did switch to a non-PA build for my routine activities, which obviously helps.)
---
Thanks for the information, dense is definitely something I need to look into as I also like hunting ScorchBeasts, although they do seem to be hunting me quite often.
---
I always just decamp into PA to fight them but I think it would be fun do best them wearing standard armor.
---
Any possibility that you would share your reshade file? Thanks!
---
I feel like if you were morally ok with duping, got caught, and got banned, then you should be mature enough to accept the consequence of your decision. Do you think what you did when it was a bad thing to do, isn't a bad thing anymore? 
---
Your crime wasn't legalized, they just searched everybody. You should still serve your sentence :)
---
I also had a legendary bos piece which had the modifier +25 rad res but it only said so in the text and did not have the value added. 
---
Thank you for figuring this out. Always thought i used a lot of cores in my PA (VATS build and only use it for nuke zones).
---
Personally i would argue that rather than reduce the amount VATS depletes a fusion core, it shouldn't deplete it at all. If i can use VATS without PA, why should it use a resource in PA? The act of shooting something should use the core but not VATS.
---
MR KRABS IS IN THERE!
---
I got 194 this morning after doing a second nuke, this one on Prime. And I would have got 20-30 more if I hadn't already picked some of that flora within the past day. I currently have over 70 stable violet flux sitting in my stash.
---
Hmm which one is better tho? 
---
&gt; Dupers are not cheaters, but rather exploiters
---
they arent cheaters, they are cheaters. Duh!
---
I don't think duping was the reason for the cap.
---
Auto receivers reduce range as do suppressors. He’s right but didn’t quite illustrate it. Even within range, shotguns deal more damage the closer you are. Reducing their range also reduces this max damage range. Auto+ any barrel mod at all reduces your max damage range so far you could get out ranged by a a super sledge. I’m not exaggerating. You seem to deal no damage because range has reduced your hitting power so far, the super mutant’s DR is rejecting most of the remaining damage.
---
PC!
---
im just messing around 
---
Depends on where your camp is located mate.
---
My mother used to make huge batches of pepperoni rolls every summer for the church bake sale and boy do I miss them. I can't bake to save my life...
---
Ann Arbor here!
---
Any port in a storm there, bud.
---
agreed this would be very good to have.  
---
That said it would also make it super easy to clear out vendors of bulk junk and consumables, which I suspect is the reason it's not in fo76.  This is likely an intentional decision to slow the rate at which players can acquire the things they need in the game.
---
I miserly use VATS to locate targets I can't see.  I hate burning chores, even though I have the power perk.  Thanks for this post. 
---
People also don't mic because they don't want to be harassed simply for being a woman who plays video games. It happens way too often and I just stopped using a mic and only chat with my friends.
---
Ah, we found the COD fanboy gents.
---
Lmao. I live in the Seattle area... passive-aggressive is the norm in the NW. 
---
that would be nice, i've gotten rid of dupes that I could but those duplicate keys just drive my OCD wild
---
You need more than just Violet Flux for underarmors don't you?
---
Don't need to. Xbox servers I play on seem to be full or at capacity.
---
From what I can tell, they are heavily RP based.
---
Mine was a farmer, a carpenter, and a Shriner! I managed to get the face and the hair right and I'd really love to have a fez for him to wear to complete the look...
---
Nah, don't make it account bound. When the welder is slayed, the hammer seeks the better champion. 
---
You can't put it into stash, you, can't log off forever and not use it, if it feels neglected, it seeks one more deserving...
---
That would make for some interesting PvP...
---
&gt;I think the incentive for finding those merchants and exploring the map would be the plans and mods they stock.
---
Exactly this.  Players shouldn't be forced to slog across the map to find access to more vendors with more credit. There should be incentives tied to the quality of loot you can find at what level equally expected gains in income, IE higher level players sell higher level loot for more caps.  But gating vendors behind an arbitrary cap "cap" based on location to artificially limit player wealth is bad design.
---
Sorry, pal, I'm a PC.
---
Ok fair enough, depends how you define cheating. I see usage of third party software as cheating. I do not see utilization of game mechanics as cheating. If mechanic is broken it is not user's fault, but developers fault. A solution has been introduced to the game, why would you keep account suspended? In my opinion that makes sense to keep the game running, or rather, to try to get some people back in the almost dead game.
---
Great story, love it. Just don’t like the fact you described the baddies as bullet sponges. Don’t know if the latest patch improved this aspect of the game, but I hope the devs can improve it. 
---
I grew up in Inkster. Work in Ann Arbor.
---
Can the coils trigger pvp if some knacker hits you?
---
It's my pleasure, thanks for the comment! I think your suggestion is also reasonable and I'd back it immediately and completely. I suspect that their intent is to make it somewhat detrimental for VATS users by including fusion core drain to ensure that those builds don't vastly outshine others considering how theoretically difficult it would be to put down a PA VATS user in PvP. That's fine and all, but the current amount of core usage when rocking VATS is... draining! Pun completely intended. :P
---
Because it's the truth and the fanboys can't handle it, they wanted to be smug and rub it into everyone's face but so sorry y'all got egg on your face for believing Beth.
---
Haha. Probably.
---
Vendor factions color coded
---
this community has way bigger fish to fry than shields
---
Did we get an estimate of total items deleted? 
---
My first silver!
---
Thank you kind stranger. I don't know what it does but I'm into it. 
---
I love it!
---
I think this game like this is what Bethesda was going for when they voided the game of NPCs and I think it's really awesome of you to try it out.
---
If you can't decide between one or the other, you could try making one. Afterall, it has ro start somewhere
---
Of course. There would be balancing acts that would need to be made if this were implemented.
---
"THE CHARACTER LIMIT IS TOO SMALL "
---
Cheater, exploters, potatos, potatoes. 
---
I think that if you info Beth about exploit you will not be banned(there was a post about this some time ago), but dupers(AKA cheaters and exploters) that don't info are banned, if they are caught.
---
So, do you think these banned cheaters would suddenly change and start cooperate with Beth? Or would they just keep doing what they did earlier?
---
If you like camping, Canaan Valley is a really pretty place.
---
Want cobalt?  Drop on the pumpkin farm, is a little crop area to the west that gives me bit over 80 (with perk) in about a minute of harvesting.
---
Yes it should be actually an easy fix, instead of showing just the frame in the previews, they should show your actual configuration. I have six PA and when I need to use a specific one I have to pull them all out and display them like a fashion show. Totally unacceptable. 
---
Not yet but it will 2000 atom
---
The hard cap seems to be roughly 25% off "regular price", regardless of perks/charisma. 
---
Remember when this sub was the nice one...?
---
I'll start my own vendor! With blackjack! and hookers!
---
Upvoted purely on the quality title
---
Balancing acts would need to be made if this trading system was implemented, of course.
---
Super need this. 
---
Nah. I don't know about others but I deny not to group with those that are younger. Nothing against them just my preference. That's why I pointed it out.
---
I wouldn’t mind if there were mini games we could play between players.
---
You're welcome! Curious to know how long it took you to figure out spamming the VATS target button used up a visible percentage of your fusion core? I'll be honest and say that I didn't figure it out until I kept pressing the button and finally watched my gauge move every single time. :O
---
I'll take one for my level 22 crafter. She did almost the same thing, and operated there happily for a long time.
---
&gt;I feel like if you were morally ok with duping, got caught, and got banned, then you should be mature enough to accept the consequence of your decision. Do you think what you did when it was a bad thing to do, isn't a bad thing anymore?  
---
&gt;Your crime wasn't legalized, they just searched everybody. You should still serve your sentence :)
---
Bans are permanent. While duping might no longer be possible and duped items have been removed, use of third party applications is still possible. Now, I do accept the sentence of being banned, but I do not accept that decision on keeping accounts that lets say have cheated and no longer are able to do so, vs unbanning people who have cheated and are still able to do so.
---
Ah, makes sense! So, to test my understanding:  the fact that I fitted the same gun with mods that also reduce range (short barrel, stock, no sights, etc.) exacerbated things... and I should more damage (at least some) if I swap those out for mods that increase range (long barrel, recon scope, etc.).
---
Looks like time for some 'sperimenting!
---
No way! Shit,  this is massive. 
---
That would make sense since the cap for sell price is 25% of the total value.
---
You guys with your floating bases are crazy.  I love it!
---
So this invisible level 1 kills you, all your inventory goes into the paper bag? Trying to figure out if that's what your saying.
---
 It is not all that hard. I dunno what your problem is.
---
Oh I misunderstood what you were saying, gotcha.
---
Maybe it's cause they both tend to go into hibernation unless other stimulus is around?
---
I like trying to help randoms and low level players. I wish I had more stuff to craft and giveaway. I want to start giving away stimpacks and food/water for free to noobies at the Vault and Whitesprings 
---
Whatever cuck. 
---
I scrapped many, many signs hoping for some kind of mod.... splintered (causes bleeding), cedar (damage), barb wire (damage/ bleeding), wired up (electrical), neon glowing (radiation).
---
Nope.  No mods. just sadness 
---
Hey.
---
There we go:
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/234
---
I will update it soon at some point though. Already made a newer version that looks even better but it's heavier as well. By heavier I mean that it's a bit less performance friendly.
---
You can find more detail about it on the mods page. :)
---
Got some assaultron head.
---
So that’s where that one last mongrel went during the workshop defense ;)
---
It's almost 1:1 all the stupid "I'm quitting" posts here. It's mocking those posts. That's the only reason to word it that way.  
---
You're clearly projecting something. That's how that word works, right? You just say it and now you're right, of course.  
---
~~Or you just also don't know what it means.~~
---
I do not think, I know. Not all of course, but we had a community (maybe a smaller one) that was gathering huge amount of information over several month to submit to bethesda, but before we posted it, all accounts were suspended.
---
 Turn on your fucking mic. Talk to me, or I will ignore you.

wow.... Who exactly is hostile?
---
Likely the bags were already dropped near by, thereby when they died the bag of dropped weapons and armors combined with the death bag of junk. If you drop two things separately close enough together they combine into the same bag.
---
Not the ones people seem to prefer - Enclave/BoS/marine. 
---
This sounds like a hack rather than the exploitation of a glitch.
---
Nothing ruder than trying to open a random trade without saying something first.
---
HOW I MINE FOR FISH!!!!
---
I think the entire drain in general needs looking at, but 100% there’s no way using VATS should drain it faster than not. Losing AP and power is a double hit. 
---
Aww, too bad. I'm a michigander on PS4. Love to roleplay in these kinds of things (and make friends!)

How my granddaddy did it and it’s how we did it. 
---
Didn’t have no duping issues back then. We just logged on and kicked a man off if he got out of line. 
---
Grumble grumble 
---
My findings have been identical. I can literally see my fusion core gauge go down that single percentage point every time I press the VATS targeting button, even when nothing gets targeted as a result.
---
Ahhh the pen 15 club.

It's the new Grafton event.

it is the user's fault they exploit the bug. It is an intentional act they know is not working as intended.

If you find that entering a certain code in an ATM causes it to put out money, it is a bug. If you keep that money, you have stolen from the ATM. If you keep using that code to get more money to keep, you have stolen from that ATM many times.
---
Maybe because it would be spoilers? Some people still like to discover things instead of having it available to see.
---
Then you should be well aware that actively confronting something isn't passive aggressive.

I have an extra chest plan.  If you are on PS4 I can give it to you if you can toss me a few antibiotics and/or disease cures.  I’m always sick lol

Stupidly was not wearing my shielded forest under armor, that takes me to 17 STR. I never join teams so *Strange in Numbers* doesn't count for me.
---
 *All 5 pieces of CA have +1 STR* Hmm? 2\* all mine were crafted and have no added special stats. I'll need by the looks of things to start farming legendary CA for the STR addition. It is a shame though as I now have the plans to build full sets of Combat Armor, makes one wonder what is the point of hunting down the plans (before the patch) if you can never build sets that really compete with the drops.
---
I always forget to harvest and eat appropriate meats before fighting so I must be loosing points there, I do fire Chems with hot keys, fury and phychobuff before fighting so that will add 3 STR, probably all not too bad.
---
Fine tuning a build does seem to be a large part of the interest in this game once we reach a certain level.
---
Any other little tips would be gratefully received, don't want to come across an annoying and needy.
---
Of course complaints will not stop. The gamedesign sabotages enjoyment on nearly every scale. Tweaks or fixes cannot change that.

What about ranged weapons in general? Since the TSE nerf ranged weapons a lot less viable now. I'm not saying the nerf was needed, because it was very needed, but it was nerfed too much. Melee still over powers any ranged weapon. Show some love for ranged weapons too please

I'm moving on, which is why it's such a shame. Left a really seriously bad taste in my mouth, and Bethesda has burned through a ton of goodwill with this game. 
---
&gt;Oh and being able to sell/scrap ammo.

zOMG yes. I'm a puny little level 27 wussboy who's only ever touched (and immediately scrapped) a gatling gun. I've taken to dumping my 5mm ammo and missiles in suitcases at train stations. I've got about 4000 rounds of .45 saved up for my next big purchase (lever action rifle) but I'm hurting for 5.56mm having just bought the handmade gun plans. All that lead and gunpowder going to waste...
---
Yup you got it! Yw.
---
Rarity as well as usefulness decides. Research (or ask) its value if you are wondering.  
---
I scrapped a TSE combat rifle I picked up at Whitesprings during my first nuke event when I was in my teens, because I could not use it and I didn't realize how rare and useful they were.  
---
Soon after I learned what they were, and I cried a little bit. Don't make yourself cry.
---
Personally I'd keep that lever gun. They are my favorites anyway, and a sniper one would rock.
---
They hate us obviously. ;)
---
You get the X-01 plans for free at a terminal in the command center.
---
&gt; plan is easy to buy since patch 5 
---
wait. what? where!!!
---
I had something similar happen. I saw a scorch beast fighting something on the ground near whitesprings station. So I stand in the station doorway and take shots at it as I can. Lvl 25 sniper so I'm not even scratching this thig. Well I guess I got an eye or something and it turns on me. I hide in the corner by the door so I'm taking a small amount of damage but as soon as I move I almost die. Few minutes of this I keep checking my map and see a bounty moving my way. They come charging in and kill this thing so I get a scorch kill xp and they ask me to get the bounty too. I got my first scorch beats kill and a pvp kill. Dude made my day! Thanks again!
---
Sorry, but this sub is so full of lies made by dupers, that it's hard to believe, but I still hope you posted that material, even if you were banned.
---
And we don't need dupers to do that. People still pump, find by accident and search for these glitches in the game, people who have reported those glitches to Beth and have not been banned, because they did not use those glitches for themselves.
---
It just popped up. I tried to stay there and server hop to see if that triggered it, but I ended up getting killed twice in the load in, so I stopped that strategy. I don’t know what the trigger is. 
---
601
---
It's treason then.
---
Joking. FNV was a good game but i haven't loaded it up once since FO4 came out.
---
Did people just pay $60 for it? Was it broken? Is it plagued with a bad launch, bugs, disconnects, nerfs, etc. (even if it was at some time it's not like complaining about it would change anything now). And can it be modded on PC? Can people fix their own issues? Add whatever they want to the game? Etc? Doesn't seem comparable really when you think about it.
---
I found a single exploding. A pistol. It didn't even do much (but I found it after the nerf so...)
---
Don't forget "All Rise"! Helluva sledgehammer.
---
Lol this post and all the gullible comments, sure OP
---
Awesome. That’s like 20 more bobby pins 👍 
---
This is really cool. I love the progression shots.
---
I always upvote flying bases. I love this one, very clean concept!
---
can confirm, this happens occasionally and has for a while
---
One time I used the keycard and crashed. I went back on the next day and didn't have to put in the keycard, I was able to put in the code without needing a second keycard
---
One of us. One of us.
---
Definitely diminishing returns. I like running 5 points in my damage cards (20%,10%,10%) the 4 extra points after that seems like a waste to me. 
---
Honestly I too was in your position OPP unfortunately I had no one to save me but I did use someone's Camp because I trying to go to the White Springs Resort.
---
What? How?  
---
This game has been an utter train-wreck from the start til now, and probably further than now. Every little complain in this subreddit has been legitimate and rightful.  
---
That said, I think that "listening" to all and everyone is a big, if not huge mistake.  
---
Via the Post &amp; Karma system on this site, issues that really only affect .1% of the player base get blown out of proportion and seem like huge deals. So if Bethesda seriously acted on the things they got told on this subreddit it only added weight to the train-wreck instead of trying to solve it.  
---
This game should've been a co-op only game. Fallout isn't designed to be a multiplayer game with a PVP mode. But they didn't because they didn't know what they wanted to make. And I think this is the biggest problem with Fallout 76.  
---
They just wanted to make a multiplayer game. These types of games are "in" right now and Bethesda, not having a lick of an idea, still tried to do it. And that's the biggest reason why they decided to act based on their online following: They thought that their fans had more Idea on what the game was supposed to be than they did.  
---
Also:  
---
Weird how they never had any sort of glitch relating to us being able to buy everything out of the shop, right? Weird. Almost as if their only objective with this game was to milk the fallout franchise to death.  
---
I'm really looking forward to Elder Scrolls 6. But any fallout after this will have to repair a HUGE amount of damage which was done to the franchise, if they even decide to keep it alive rather than just deeming it "not profitable" and throw it on the dead-franchise-pile.
---
The one near flatwoods isn’t required tho. 
---
No way in hell. Cheaters tried to ruin our game.

Problem with junkies build: addiction doesn't last long at all what meant you need to almost constant eat all type of chems what really hard to maintain.
---
I tried it. Thank you thank you! So much better 
---
Wait are there vendors with separate cap pools? Because I assumed that every vendor in the game uses the same daily allowance of 200; every time I go to another vendor after selling 200 caps worth of bulk they all have no caps as well. 
---
Yes. 400+ hrs here and I prefer the sub.

Gonna try this next. Turns out my controller is drifting so that’s been part of my trouble
---
 You are a fool. Do some research.
---
What time next week? 
---
I think he meant the mod plans for the X-01. And as far as i know there are no plans for mods.
---
Ah. You know the teeth marks are a dead giveaway. Turns out mine is drifting to the right and up. So yea, time for a new one
---
You might want to try switching around your SPECIAL points/Perk Cards and how you mod your weapons if you're running out of action points in VATS. 
---
particularity - equipping receivers that improve Critical damage - Calibrated (2.0x) &gt; Severe (1.5x) for Semi-Auto, or Tweaked (1.5x) for Automatic. All non-critical receivers have a 1.0x critical modifier. You may be confused by this, but all non-critical attacks are calculated at 1/2 base weapon damage.
---
Here is a video i made of my sneak/crit/vats ranged build with a level 15 handmade and zero commando perks.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W-8I--0wz8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W-8I--0wz8)
---
The game UI will only report the first sneak attack and first critical strike on an enemy, nearly every attack in that video is a sneak attack or VATS critical strike.
---
A level 45 calibrated lever action or handmade would be one shot head-shoting after the 3rd kill with those perks.
---
This sounds super enjoyable, share it with the folks over at r/fo76FilthyCasuals they love enjoyable stuff like this. 
---
Scorched Mothman has Greenish eyes similar to a glowing Mothman. Vengeful Mothboy has red eyes. And Wise MothGod has purple eyes
---
Yes, it's Spruce Knob lake, north of Vault 96 in the bottom middle of the map. Gotta swim through a low rock overhang to get in a little cave where Taggerdy was hanging out.
---
I remember because I marked it down to build my camp there, since it's not a specific location on that spot, but no such luck! 😣
---
Also if you're on the roof of the laundry room, and there are any RadScorpions around don't aggro them while there are still ferals alive in the laundry room itself. Since Radscorps don't climb, but can burrown they will come into the laundry room and kill all of the ferals.
---
I'd just be grateful to see no more dramatic flounces, whether people are mad at the game or mad at the people here. I don't need to see daily announcements about why someone is mad and leaving whatever. 
---
The obvious poaching by other subs is just the icing on the flouncing cake.
---
Dang, I only see the regular Gatling Laser plan there. Might have to stop there more often.
---
This dear sir is a good point. However, permanent suspension of account with all of the games on it, instead of actually remedying the situation when the issue was submitted - is a bad way of managing situation, would not you agree?
---
Using your example: putting a code in an ATM to get free money - everyone is aware of that and everyone is doing it for month, while bank is also aware and just completely ignores the current situation - now, after you get caught and submit information on the code and how it can be remedied, as well as bunch of other issues with this service, bank chooses to confiscate all of the money, your account in another bank, you car, your house, put you in jail for the rest of your life and completely ignore the issue with other services that you offered to help with. While bank got their money back, their services are still not functioning and they are losing money, while the jailed person just rots in jail. Does not seem like a proper way of managing the situation, does it?
---
Nah. It's for those with a master plan. 
---
If he was on team he would not be able to hear me anyway. Trust me, i spend lot of time raiding peoples at workshop and they don't heard me much times. Had to use emotes to know who is ignoring me and who just don't use area chat.
---
 God I hate third person. It affects so much, and is ruining games.
---
You realize that that balancing would created as many new problems as this would solve right?
---
This comment is an example of why that sub exists. People like you.
---
Someone ate the food out of my fridge too...
---
S (15) - gladiator, incisor, martial artist
---
P (11) - rifleman, expert rifleman, tank killer
---
These are my relevant perks for combat
---
Trying to use the presets, but everytime I click on preset it changes the game from FullScreen to borderless and instantly to ultra.
---
If I click back to Ultra it stays at ultra, and the second I click preset to Low, Medium or High again, BOOM, straight back to Ultra
---
I play solo like 99% of the time, unless someone randomly adds me, and I will stay in the group if it's one person, just in case they need me for their Charisma perks, but if I need my Lone Wanderer I'm out. What I like to do is Workshops. I like to claim Workshops, set up extractors, gather resources I need, make food at the food factory, set up water purifiers, make ammo at the munitions factory, set up all the defenses, fight the waves of mobs, etc. I get xp, caps, items, plans, resources, and I just go around and take a bunch of Workshops and hang around. That's something I like to do.
---
Other times I have a goal. I want to upgrade a certain gun or armor piece. I need mods for it, so I need resources to craft and scrap them, so I do that.
---
You can do whatever you want. Level up get new perks that help you do the things you like to do, to make it easier and faster and more efficient etc.
---
There’s also the event specific weapons like the Nailer, Meteorite sword, etc.
---
VATS has been a fusion core hog since FO4.   This is not new.
---
A swimming area? Now I need to know as well... I love swimming in game! 
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Cool.  Subscribed
---
There are 7 factions of vendors. Vendors from the same faction all have the same 200 cap stash but the others 6 factions each have a separate 200 cap stash. So if you visit all you can spend a total of 1400 caps per day. To get a map with vendors from each faction highlated in different colors just google "fo76 vendor map", the first redit post you find will have a link with the map.
---
sorta had to give you the thumbs up on that one Stone.  LMAO
---
Yes, the hope is there, but damn... Other online games are getting weekly live events, and marshmello concerts and world-changing invasions, we're still not getting anything. It's sad too, because the world is RIPE for fun stuff, and the fanbase is proving relatively (and a bit shockingly) loyal - but the updates are so glacially slow, I just don't know when the good stuff is coming! But you're right! That glimmer of hope IS there!
---
So the sneak, enemies not taking damage, and bulk items being scrapped things are still an issue? Good to know. I was wondering if I should hop back on the game but if these are still going to be issues I'm not going to bother. It angers me too much to shoot an enemy point blank and do no damage D:
---
Hopefully, they're going to fix these things soon, though. These patch notes are certainly a good first step
---
could result in some people running around with signs that say the n word
---
I don't need to. I know it's an old game and not even relevant.
---
amazing, very inventive !
---
Jeeze man. You’ve got some serious stuff to work out...
---
Hope I see you in game!
---
Because X01 mod plans just don't exist.  Seems everything the Enclave provides you is loose mod only.
---
No plans to acquire/buy.  I don't think they have mod plans for the Scout armor either, just a bunch of random loose mods.
---
Kind of like shopping.  You select all the stuff you want THEN it charges you.
---
Can’t do that in 76 because we can’t set default pricing on the crap we’re carrying.
---
Here's my biggest issue. Anytime anyone has anything positive to say about the game, it’s met with immediate down-votes, saracasm, and claims that the OP is either a bot or on Bethesda's payroll.  I have seen people who actually enjoy the game openly called idiots, human waste, and much worse. Why would people want to contribute to a sub where they are continually insulted for saying something as innocuous as “I’m really having a good time playing this game”?   So they’re either fighting back (which doesn't really help matters much),leaving altogether, or migrating over to the splinter sub-reddit you mentioned.  
---
I love temple builds, holy shit was this one cool 
---
I am in
---
you got it..i have a bunch of disease cures for u
---
I would say, judging by the post volume, lousy loot is the number one community complaint at this time. The entire loot system needs an overhaul. 
---
Great sub, very refreshing to see reasonable concerns and a community that genuinely enjoys 76. 
---
Im through being reasonable with you people, at this point i've been called a baby and a liar from different people. What did you expect? imo the sooner you piss off to your new safe space subreddit the sooner we can get on with addressing the games issues. 
---
I am a follower not a leader. Guild leaders always seemed to work really hard. 
---
It’s just that regular Gatling Laser, upgraded with the Prime Receiver plan. 
---
FYI, anytime you learn a Prime Receiver plan, you also learn how to make the ammo needed for that Receiver. In this case, it enables you to make Ultracite Fusion Cores. They take Stable Flux to craft, and You can put them into power armor as well. One Ultracite Fusion Core lasts a pretty long time in your PA.
---
Upvoted you dead sir. A lot of information still has not been revealed from the tests though and unfortunately, thank god that it has not. I doubt that any fan would be glad to hear that state of the game is about 10 times worse than what we have seen on reddit or youtube.
---
No, you are right, you do not need dupers to do that :) The fact is, dupers were able to identify those bugs and glitches a lot faster than people who did not dupe. 
---
I have several people on the friends list, who have accounts that have never duped or picked up duped items, where they are by Bethesda, are forbidden from playing those chars, until further notice from bethesda, since by just simply logging that char in the game will crash the server. And yes, dupers community knows issue behind this, but Bethesda is being ignorant. And it will keep affecting any player in the game, by just playing the game, until Bethesda listens to submitted reports and makes necessary changes to the engine and databases. 
---
Search r/market 76 xb1
---
No 
---
It isn't me down voting you.
---
The cap limit is crippling, not a feature. I literally throw equipment away because I've already 200'd all the factions and if I play again tomorrow I'll have more than enough stuff to 200 out the vendors as well without saving today's loot for tomorrow. Or are you of the opinion I should only play each day until I generate 1400 caps worth of loot then stop? Having players throw weapons and armour away like junk isn't helping the economy.
---
Quite literally not a single reason suggested is any way a good one except to artificially increase the amount of time required to generate the caps. In GTA, which I haven't played for ages so may be wrong, isn't forcing me to get my $2 000 000 000 by daily incriments of $2000. 
---
 In FO76 I currently HAVE over 10k worth of trading items but have no way of redeeming it because of the fake low cap limits. Even though the  vendors will charge me 5k for a weapon but somehow don't have that 5k anywhere when I want to sell the other weapons I am carrying.
---
There is grind, which we all do to get what we want and forced repetitiveness because the devs  want to force you to play for a month not a week. If I play a stupid amount why should I have to drag it out over a month? 
---
Why?
---
Boy are you in luck!
---
I have a brand spankin' new, 1 owner, never been swung, lvl 50 3* reduced weight Assassin's golf club with your name on it!
---
I appreciate your input and I follow your reasoning. I apologize for not going into specifics about my build within my original post but I assure you that my issue is not that I am running out of VATS points but rather that my VATS usage is draining my fusion cores alarmingly fast. I one-shot nearly everything I come across when sneaking save for scorch beasts and cryptids. My build uses as many VATS-crit and AP-refreshing Luck perks as possible and I'd be happy to provide you with a link to it if you think it might help determine other potential sources of this mega-drain.
---
Cool down is 3 hours per silo per player. You can lunch 3 nukes one from each silo on one server, then you can jump server and your friend can lunch 3 nukes.
---
PS don't worry about card it will stay there for you next time you will do alpha it will not take another card from you.
---
&gt; I'm moving on, which is why it's such a shame.
---
Your post history says otherwise... It's not really any of my business and obviously you are free to do you, but just saying. 
---
What system are you guys playing on?
---
I wish Fallout had the readable books like Elder Scrolls. The notes in 76 are a nice step in that direction though. :)
---
That is always fun. \^\_\^ I loved reading some of the post of the RP-ing Groups in Black Desert and Arch Age. Hopefully that will be fun also. 
---
I have found that this is usually a molerat got stuck in its teleport. They will not emerge if you are facing them. Try destroying containers in build mode, building spike traps where you last saw one pop out, and sometimes getting a vertibird in the area, or going in and out of the plant, will get it to fix. 
---
Yayyyyyy Bethesda yayyyyyy Bethesda is the best 
---
You only have 5 keys??? What's your secret?
---
Man, I got hit three nights in a row last week for the first time in about a month. I was all WTF?
---
What if they add a store that you turn the voucher into and every voucher nets a vast amount of caps or a corvega you can place in your camp (every voucher turned in unlocks a different color variation).
---
Jk I joined 
---
It seems the cheerful need to migrate every 2 months to a new sub.
---
The terrible 20s (and 30s) are definitely a thing in this game. Once you get to about 40 the playing field shifts to your favor with a decent build.
---
Try shotguns + Enforcer if you haven't done that yet. You'll basically cripple every enemy you encounter and things are far less scary when all they can do is writhe around on the ground. Once they're down, finish them off with a melee weapon to conserve ammo.
---
That particular issue might not be new to the Fallout series as a whole but this game certainly is new(ish)! I'm hoping it can be addressed before it becomes accepted as the norm in Fallout 76.
---
Sounds like pc scripting. 
---
Hello. This is something that tends to happen. I've already mentioned it earlier but the comments section has become really messy so I don't blame your for not seeing it.  
---
Here's a copy paste of what I said.
---
&gt;There's also a bug where you select a Window mode, select a preset and it sets it back to Borderless. Setting it to Fullscreen, going back in the menu, re-entering and then picking whatever preset you want works.
---
This should work for you as well. Don't worry. Same thing happens to me. It's a one-time thing tho if you keep playing in fullscreen.
---
 Probably the most modded game in existence.  Hell we got our own fucking engine.
---
I just don't have the glowing mass, etc to make them stable!
---
Lmao thanks 
---
Usually Thursday's if I'm not mistaken. 
---
whooosh
---
I upvoted once for you...now all you need is 19 more people to do the same. 
---
i have 21:9 and its still working for me,  
---
go into display settings and double check that its not just not set?
---
Seen some questionable stuff on that
---
Not just increase the cap, but remove it altogether. If i have 40k (just an example) worth of stuff to sell i should be able to without even having to think about it.
---
They should have had separate servers from day one. 
---
Nothing I hate more than an annoying person shooting at for 10, 15 minutes and there is nothing you can do. Then as someone else mentioned if you kill them they go and destroy your base.
---
This game has become extremely toxic. 7 more days until Anthem
---
There’s two separate Gatling lasers. The regular one and the ultracite version. The ultracite shoots green lasers and has a built in bonus dmg to scorched. Not to be confused with prime.
---
My favorite one was 400 plastic 
---
600 steel and 200 lead. Must have been hopping for shotgun shell materials for a while and I really really needed shotgun shells myself.
---
Only thing I dislike is having to sort through all the useless junk after ruining someone’s face, but at least that gives my heart a chance to slowdown. PvP got WAY more fun when I started investing time to learn this game’s wonky mechanics.
---
I lol'ed
---
I can't help you, but I think I would take this opportunity to rack up a major bounty... just make sure others can't see you first and it's not a glitch on your side...
---
Yellow cake and crimson can both be used in its raw form for orbital strike/scan grenades, I believe. 
---
Violet is easily farmed near the queen along with crimson. Cobalt at the Halloween house. The rest at whitesprings. 
---
But the masses and fluids? The horde of bloated ones used to be my best source for them. Now? Not so much. I can farm up 100-200 raw flux in no time, but can use maybe half of it for lack of the other components necessary. 
---
Interesting though, I've never had to craft a core. I'm usually throwing them away. :/
---
You are correct! I'm talking about the mod plans such as the jet pack and calibrated shocks. Similar to the BOS vendor.
---
Well, shit. Now I feel like a fool! 
---
Anyway, thanks for setting me straight, now I have a new chase item. 
---
Not yet. FYI, the accepted way to let someone know to wait, is to jump up and down three times, flash your light straight up twice, and shoot once in the direction of the last clock you saw.  
---
If they're still there afterwards, then you sucessfully asked them to wait.
---
If true that would be great. 
---
She's pretty hot.
---
happens to me from time to time, had a friend went invisible last night, closing/killing the game and restarting/reloading it usually seems to fix it.
---
All complainers that added no value...probably
---
You're taking it any out of context to try and make an argument lol pretty sad dude
---
I KILLED A 3 STAR LEGENDARY AND GOT SOMETHING MILDLY USEFUL!
---
Communication by Emote is the true end game.
---
I’d ask for your stuff
---
What are these nerfs you speak of?
---
Doesn't matter what colors they use on a shirt, in game it was a black hand and black lettering. That shirt could've been green with a brown hand and it'll still be wrong. That's the entire point of using a black handprint on their notes, the leadership was known as the 'Black Hand'.
---
I go with 0 chems, it creates dependency on something that I don’t need.
---
The armor is as follows:
---
Life Saving BOS Heavy CA Chest (Assume all pieces have +1 STR and BOS with Heavy CA from now on) - free resurrection is very handy
---
Cloaking Left arm- blocks the ability to be VATS cheese-ed. Handy if you’re fighting anyone who can’t put you down in one shot or hit.
---
Zealot’s Right arm- Helps with SBQ fight. This buff is certainly great for pve. I’ll say here,  using a full set of Assassin (which is the only way assassin is useful) restricts access to something like cloaking and life saving, which are arguably better buffs
---
Bolstering Left Leg- (hoping to change to mutant slayer) Great for pve regardless, but less useful in the case of damage reduction.
---
Vanguard Right Leg-(hoping to change to troubleshooter) great all around, but I’ve been doing calculation recently, and my findings conclude that the extra 35-35 isn’t needed on top of everything I already have. (It’s not my priority to change this one)
---
Truth is, pvp is a game of numbers. Once you hit a threshold in which you can withstand a FULL DAMAGE (meaning perfect perk and gear investment) All Rise Power attack, and dish equal to greater out, you have beaten 99 percent of players. 
---
My weapon is a different story, but I’m hitting well over 1k without Bloodied cheese, much higher than the All Rise.
---
It’s not the most powerful gear, but it’s pretty damn good. I’m willing to sacrifice my huge damage potential with Bloodied for the higher protection I have.
---
As for Sentinel Assassin, I’m expecting a nerf to sentinel, as it’s a broken effect regardless, and it absolutely requires a full set, which many don’t have. Like I said, 99 percent of players are just beaten at this point, if you strategize and plan well. 
---
Why are the people from filthycasuals so mad? 
---
Was it love on valentines day by any chance?
---
Ok yea, didn't remember the exact logic. So when shot damage = resistance then it's 50% damage done. 
---
THE CHARACTER LIMIT IS TOO SM
---
Faces of Fallout
---
A lot of what if that hopefully will get at least some attention from de devs.
---
But 1st, what if they fix the servers so it doesn't take me 5 minutes per loading screen (barely had time to finish reading the advice at the bottom a few weeks ago, now I know them by memory) so I can use that time for playing the game, not looking at the same screenshots over and over.
---
The ability to craft heavy CA is much more useful to sell as a service. If you can make a whole set with BOS, you can make serious money.
---
What do you use Violet for? I don't think I've ever seen it.
---
Reduced, yet again, the chance to find cores in reactors. (In patch notes)
---
As if all the previous spawn nerfs weren’t bad enough.
---
Takes me a couple hours to get enough cores to play a full day anymore. 
---
Tired of wasting my time on inventory management game. 
---
I only played a bit at launch and have not been playing at all since. Can someone fill me in on what "Duped" items are?
---
The big round, dark brown table? I believe it’s part of the resort table bundle. This may help: 
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl
---
dont let people on it then. take the cord with you. the game has nothing to do with your misfortune of rude mates.
---
I really enjoy helping out low-level people but that's partly because I have run out of things to do with the game.
---
 I had a guy get upset with me as I sat in The Whitespring. I was squeezing some bud for my Brindle Farms vaporizer and I tried to talk to him, but he wanted me to get up and emote. Fuck that nonsense. I thought of murdering him right in the store section, but reason prevailed although I would get away with it. ;)
---
Farm sentry bots in whitesprings. I have 40 votes at all times. Nearly 700 xp a pop too
---
"THE GREAT WAR WAS AN INSIDE JOB"
---
Cores not votes. 
---
Yeah, pretty much the point. That sound. Whoosh.
---
It's funny how with all these horseshit claims of ZOMG EXPLOITZ! there is ***never*** any video evidence. On Xbox and PS4, you can *easily* capture video by simply telling your console to save a clip of the last 30 seconds of gameplay (or more if you adjust your setting, PS4 default is 15 minutes I believe). On PC if you have any kind of non-shitty graphics card, you can set up your system to do the same thing.
---
Sure you saw bigfoot getting abducted by a UFO on the grassy knoll, buddy. Sure.
---
What are you even spending that many caps on? Stop grinding, stop farming, just slow down and enjoy the game.
---
could send in a ticket for a restore? possibly through xbox or even bethesda since i think the characters and info are stored on their servers possibly? i know some companies you can have them restore accidently deleted accounts, or maliciously deleted accounts from server back ups.. 
---
2nd that
---
Really?  Do you spend every minute in a power suit jet packing around?  I do.  I never find power cores in generators.   I just craft them.  Also perk cards make them last a very long time.  Never has this been an issue for me.  
---
 The point that seems to escape you, is that there are perfectly reasonable subreddits. Whoosh is right.
---
Good for you. Uber player fan boi
---
Tried one - went OK, SBQ ran off the map, but only had to be revived a few times (and revived a couple others).
---
I've got some loose power armor pieces, I'll see what I can cobble together and give that a try.  Come of it is higher level, mixed in with some raider stuff.  Holding off doing the quests until higher level, but I've found enough random pieces to make a go of it.
---

Apologize for the crappy picture. I threw a prime receiver on it but a normal one would be the same without prime in it. It’s a SBQ drop. There’s also a few people who said they got the plans for it doing Census Violence in the bog, but it’s a rare plan. Good hunting to ya.
---
Sorry, I guess I was confused and thought there was also an issue with running out of VATS action points in addition to fusion cores draining far too quickly. I sadly have no insight into Power Armor other than using it to fast travel while encumbered, which I am nearly all the time with 160 base carry weight. I have no desire to do a Power Armor, specifically a Heavy build until Bethesda puts some effort into overhauling heavy/exotic weapons.
---
Can you ask them to steal your reddit account too?
---
All I have right now for range is a 2 shot the dragon (300 caps) and a 2* mutants explosive black powder rifle(600 caps). Gt: watchmefly420 if your interested.
---
It's a bug, only way to fix is to relog.
---
As an fyi, you're only invisible to yourself, not to mobs or anyone else. So don't get any ideas about sneaking into the locker room at Watoga HS...
---
yeah sign me up. also why is ore in MISC instead of junk? jebus. found like 50 ores in there the other day that was weighing me down. 
---
I've been doing this since around lvl. 25 myself (175 now)  I used to leave claimable PA frames at the Overseer's Camp or at v76  w/ a  couple of cores, but stopped when I caught some lower life form players around lvl. 50 robbing the cores.  Really good to read these stories from other players.  I have seen lots of players teamed and solo doing this type of help since the launch.  Lets the newbies know there is more than griefers and asshats in the game.
---
The game didn't just release for $60 in a broken state, and players can't just fix their own issues and add whatever they want to it through modding. You're the one that looks like the fool in this conversation by the way.
---
Yeah.  Take aggrieved in whitesprings from bots to fight the most powerful ones there, with backup, to get used cores.
---
That’s an amazing solution. Too bad I’m not level 200+ with tweaked gear.
---
How about basic game design lets us get them like it’s supposed to without shitty clueless devs fucking it up?
---
Which patch notes? AFAIK they're not out yet for the client update last week, and the only patch notes I could find referencing core spawn rates was [January 10](https://bethesda.net/en/article/7hpeHkKxyM6aMWUCCIkeW6/fallout-76-patch-notes-january-10-2019). Yesterday's server update was only mentioned in Inside the Vault; no formal patch notes that I could find.
---
No fucking way.  Sorry for your luck cheater, but stay banned
---
I've is the chest plans drop from the Grafton monster since the patch
---
LMAO.  Not a fan boy.  Not mentally challenged to the point I cant figure out the most basic part of the game.  
---
You want to always be in PA.  Speck for it captain fucktard.
---
Yeah this, I never find myself bored or out of things to do. Stay away from the missions, they a drain and I dread them, but set a goal, there is so much to do, just thinking about it drains me and I end up just doing challenges. But upgrading PA, going to hunt for guns or weapons, making food/soup, inventory management, building camps. I have 10 characters (2 xboxes). I use them for various things like challenges, but also spend a bit of time on a character to level them up a bit. I told myself I would do different builds, but I still lean towards melee at the beginning of the game. I am hoping to do a commando build and maybe a OP build ..
---
No harm, no foul! I totally understand your reluctance for starting a PA/heavy weapons character considering the current state of affairs. :/
---
I have some freebies you can have, a 3* single action revolver and 50 cal. They need a loving owner and they’re pretty decent.
---
I can honestly say I have never seen the number of subs here above 172 000. I'd say the number is closer to 1,500.
---
And to think all that happened in a day (the pipboy says only a day has passed since reclamation day)
---
Look man. Was just trying to help. Don't have to be a Fucking dick
---
Its fine down vote me if youd like. I stood where you stand now. Ive had the back of fo76 but sometimes you just lose all hope.
---
Edit, not reply to self ;)
---
They do, 200 per vendor per dayish (not 100% sure on the timing).
---
Lol yeah, pretty rough day
---
Server hop on power armor spawns that's how I got my serplus early game.
---
Hahahahaha
---
Good story. 
---
I'm glad it's just me and the wife. For her, the PS4 is merely a COD &amp; Netflix machine
---
What about the mat at Atom Shop?
---
No luck!
---
Exact same issue; load in two ghouls near me. I shoot at them; game freezes for 3-5 seconds and closes to my desktop.
---
Sometimes I get at most 30 mins before it happens.
---
I've run as administrator, compatibility mode, scanned and repaired, clean installed the game, tried your settings, deleted the old config files. Even running on low.
---
Updated my GPU drivers, DDU safemode cleaned old drivers, and clean installed new drivers.
---
Absolutely no effect. Game still crashes constantly
---
This is so annoying; can't even play the game at all; and it's the only game and program having issues also.
---
I even recorded it using OBS for ya. This is my life in Fallout 76.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY2pQmI0q4E
---
I can't stand it. I only paid €10.19 and I feel absolutely ripped off.
---
We are on Reddit, but the discord is more relaxed.
---
do you wanr-t to play with me?xd
---
I dropped one at Vault 76 yesterday. Don’t get one. It’s useless. It looks like shit, it messes with the Monster Mash event and you can’t even put it in your stash.
---
In Fallout 3, the first thing I would do out of the Vault, even before going to Megaton, was to sneak up to the drive-in-theater where some Raiders were hanging out and lob a grenade into the sea of cars. The explosions were MOST satisfying!
---
I would find bits of Raiders and their dogs impaled into the pavement. 
---
We are mostly PC, but we have a good handful of Xbox 1 guys that play together. Like I said, if you want just jump into discord and say hi. There was a guy looking for xbox 1 people to jump into a game last night I think.
---
Well read a bit better then, i havent posted on a fallout thread for weeks before this. Doesn't mean i don't want them to fix it and add DLC and make the game decent. Im not going to trade it in, i won't even get much. I'll come back and get my platinum if the game reaches a more healthy state. 
---
Lol, I have several accounts that are not banned. I don't understand how that big amount of people on reddit are that ignorant. Some people with third party software that was enabling speedhacking, porting to dev room, being in god mode, are unbanned btw. Now what was it you were saying about staying banned?
---
I think you have to win the event called Monster Mash, which happens in Watoga.
---
Spent 400 atoms hoping it would work, it does not.
---
Dragon is a beast, I was happy to find one with 300dmg.
---
&gt;Bans are permanent.
---
Right, I've heard nothing else about anyone being unbanned, as you claim. The reasoning aside, no one who was rightfully sentenced to a permanent ban *should* have that revoked
---
Shhhh don't tell everyone. Obviously all are welcome but we don't want the negativity from here creeping in.
---
Well, your post basically tells me to do just that.
---
How should I react?
---
I’m getting screwed by the devs, yet again, and here you are suggesting g it’s fine (which is total bs) and the solution you offer is only relevant to waaaaay post end game players.
---
I’m frustrated and pissed off that another patch nerfed basic shit we need to play, but did nothing to fix stealth, ranged firing healing mobs, frameless total dominance in game, perks nerfs reversion that we need right fing now, etc, etc...
---
What are these mystical mats you speak of?
---
That's definitely something that happens - I'm on my third main controller because of eventual drift problems
---
This is also part of the strategy. If cool things come along too often, that one-day limited window does not create the desired level of urgency, and thus the desired level of willingness to spend money at that time.
---
*Particularly for the first gap between cool things, they want it to be a long period in order to set future expectations.* The more you suffer in the absence of a good option, the better then next cool thing will look. You'll also not want to wait another six months for a cool option to drop, making you more willing to pay real money.
---
The time period between cool offers is important. You'll see MMOs tune this window from time to time, trying to find the best period to generate the best returns. More frequency is more spending opportunities, but lower spending impetus. However, it is the first blackout window between cool options that is the most important and should be the longest. After the second cool thing comes up, you can expect the window between such opportunities to shorten a bit. They'll want to add more opportunities for money making and will continue to ride the wave of desperation they created by making the first window so long.
---
Additional note: This is similar to the tactic used to sell pre-orders with exclusive skins. Players have a limited window the spend money. (Up-front money is better for a developer than after-spent money.) These pre-orders often come with a chance to spend even more cash, like the super-duper-extra-cosmetics option that costs double. The sense of missing out on something potentially cool drives people to open their wallets wider.
---
Autoscrapping for a material you need scraps all bulk of that item now. It’s unfortunate but all you lost was plastic. 
---
seen it at The Whitesprings out on the course a couple of times.  Freaked me out the first time too
---
Yeah I haven’t seen any?
---
I also enjoy sniping a car from afar while some random player is walkin by it.
---
Auto scrap breaks bulk down now...
---
It was just an idea. Obvious now that you didn't want a practical solution.  You just wanted to vent. All good
---
Pa just being used at all shouldn’t require massive investment fucktard. 
---
Go back under those Bethesda desks and get back to doing what your love to do - don’t need you here.
---
The funny thing is that they would actually be the *least* unique items if every player gets one.
---
I do. I want that shit hotfixed back. Devs need to know this is unacceptable.
---
Ever play TF2? Ever see the conscious objector? That’s why this is an idea Beth will never use 
---
The frozen ghouls though.
---
Anyway, I've already got a suggestion. My computer froze for the first time giving me space invader artifacts a couple of days ago. This happened after getting the lasted Nvidia drivers.
---
If you don't play any games that are relying on the new ones, I would suggest you try the 399.x drivers. It's the ones I've been using for quite a long time now. Don't have any issues with those and I don't think there's anything wrong with your Titan; my 1080s big sister.
---
I would like to see monitoring of what's going on on your end by the way.
---
I somewhat doubt it's the card overheating or something like that but there's no way for me to tell after seeing the video.
---
I definitely understand your frustration though.
---
Lemme know about these things and if you're down to trying the 399.x drivers.
---
Give them a shot. I think it might actually fix things for you.
---
Yeah the jacks that show up for a sbq fight with pointy sticks and harsh language who rely on my ranged  dps build.. 
---
And yet they beg to be stimpacked.. 
---
I get it.. i also have more than one character for the reason. One is a farmin machine. The other is a killin machine. 
---
I did the post a week ago right when it was at or extremely close to 172,000. I posted it after a huge uproar from the community over the dupe removal announcement. Hell, check my profile, it’s all there.
---
Im just pointing out the numbers, it’s important to at least acknowledge the player base that’s leaving/moving to other subs/games 
---
Do you have any proof of this? I’ve never heard it this happening before.
---
And hats off to you, king facilitator, aka troll. Good job keeping the negative theme going.
---
As the negative posts subside, folks really need frequent reminders to re-focus their attention on the past.
---
Extra kudos for disguising your negativity by calling other people toxic.
---
I've got 100...
---
I feel the fusion core drain from VATS is a good balance. VATS provides a significant increase to damage output, while power armor provides a significant increase to survivability. The difficulty of sustaining VATS usage in power armor helps keep a balance between damage/survivability.
---
[My build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f278b8&amp;d=sg2ek1c72a72l71lu2st1s12pp2pd2pk2pl2ic4a04a12lt2cu2pe2&amp;w=l02ie2ih2iq2at1if2i71im1in1ce0cd1ev0p10lm2&amp;n=) doesn't use VATS, and uses Full Charge (strength perk) to eliminate fusion core drain from sprinting; I've been using the same fusion core for weeks, and have only drained 4%, even though I use power armor full-time.
---
Upvoted, agreed. I doubt you would hear it on reddit, but trustworthy sources have reported bans being revoked for use of third party software.
---
In the last tab under misc. there is a welcome mat you can build.  When fast traveling back you will load in on that mat (teammates as well).   Great for choosing exactly where you load in if you have to defend a workshop from another player.  
---
Knowing I only lost the plastic makes me feel better, I have another 200.
---
Wow, well if it's true, that sucks lol
---
They may be unbanned, but they're also unwelcomed!
---
It's probably an oversight carried over from FO4. In 4 the BoS mod definitely did add radiation resistance, about 10-15 per piece.
---
I don't know if it's intended to add it in 76 but it definitely does not.
---
For real, this would be such a cool feature.
---
Step 1. Take a power plant workshop. 
---
Step 2. Power up fusion generator. 
---
Step 3. Take another power plant workshop.
---
Step 4. Power up fusion generator. 
---
Step 5. Fast travel for free to first workshop.
---
Step 6. Collect fusion cores.
---
Step 7. Repeat steps 1-6 as necessary. 
---
Also, in the future, try not to sound like an entitled little shit throwing a tantrum because you might have to actually manage your resources just a little bit. Fallout 76 is not a difficult game or hardcore on survival. If you are struggling to keep your power armor running, maybe you are just bad at it. It doesnt take a lvl 200 fully 3* legendary TSE swinging uber min-max player to not suck at this game.
---
Especially since power armor doesnt come in legendary, and the mods are mostly utility, and to coast on the melee meta you just need to pick some perks and get All Rise.
---
And if you arent chasing the melee meta, it isnt hard to get some decent ranged weapons and like a BoS recon rifle and do alright. 
---
Yeah I love it. If I do die at a workshop.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_bSEfx6D8mA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bSEfx6D8mA)
---
Absolutely love how your bruises come and go and your scars age over time. Great role-playing!
---
total
---
Dafudge?
---
And they ain't in our camps?
---
Thank you though for this info.
---
No bud. Not at all. I just use 2000 steps as the average mile. You're doing more in depth math. Our answers are only 100,000 steps off. Which is only a 5% discrepancy. Which is acceptable in my eyes.
---
That's no place for a cabinet! Thanks :)
---
I love this idea! Especially how she went from fancy hair in the Vault to saying fuck it and going with an easy to care for hairstyle. So practical!
---
So go pvp and get ganked, get ganked again,waste time.
---
In the future don’t complain about devs fucking us over.
---
Gotcha
---
Fuck that noise
---
who wants to play fallouy-tt 76 with me? i have a headset
---
Again, I'm not sure you are comment on the thread splinter you think you are... the passive-aggressive comment wasn't on the OP, it was directed to a thread on another sub that was pointed at as being P-A but had not a dollop of it. 
---
Press (F) to doubt
---
There needs to be a cap. Without it, i could do Uranium Fever once, grab all the weapons and probably make 1000+ caps from just that. 
---
I wouldn't mind them pooling all the vendors together so its globally like 1500 caps. That way i can also buy expensive plans and get the full 25% value pack in caps within the pool. 
---
No plans, because ModUS is kind or a dick.
---
Unfortunately this is a bi product of how Bethesda has handled this game from the beginning. Everyone has their own personal limits and boundaries. Those that have reached those limits are angry and rightfully so. Those that haven’t are defending every action that is and has ripped the player base in two, with the most basic of arguments. Most of which are not based in any reality. 
---
Loving the Fallout franchise and loving this iteration (76) are not mutually exclusive. It is absolutely ok to be a fan of Fallout and still see this flaming turd for what it is. 
---
Somehow this is completely missed by the players that are taking up arms and vehemently defending this poor poor corporation against these evil customers who are being unfair and acting harshly by posting their disappointment.  (/S) 
---
Not only has Bethesda managed to destroy the magic of Fallout by releasing this trash wrapped garbage, they have also managed to completely divide the fan base.  
---
Some  are unwilling to accept that this game is not the gem it was advertised to be and that most of the major selling points were either highly exaggerated or just complete bullshit, while another  portion of the community had taken to social media to voice their disappointment only to be attacked by the die hard loyalist. 
---
This game has become a perfect example of dev’s shooting themselves in the foot, then shooting themselves in the other foot for “balance”. 
---
I'll try but i already experienced random sloth encounters(tamable)and they were hulking ones. Treetops also spawns one but same hulking.
---
is duping due to be patched soon or something?
---
They might be running the Lone Wanderer perk for bonus xp and ap regen
---
I'm glad the Bethesda finally made it clear. Now I can stop wasting my time on this Idiocracy.
---
Thought General Butt Naked reformed, guess not.
---
A super,  duper, griefer, oh my!
---
Call J.G. Wentworth: 877-CAPS-NOW
---
What do I think?
---
Getting old sucks
---
There was a ban wave and now they just removed any stacks of items that shouldn't show up more than once per character, TSE weapons and such.
---
I love the game. People complaining on subreddits are complaining about current games, because they want to make it known they are unhappy, they want changes, they don't want this to happen again. Not 20 year old games or whatever that practically nobody even plays anymore.
---
OP and by extension others are not indicative of the population of that subreddit. some are just more vocal than others and fail to read the sticky about it  
---
Cool concept, might have to work on something like that  if I do another character, maybe along the lines of each death make them look progressively more ghoul (assuming I can find the skin textures)
---
Honestly, I don't have anything else to say to you other than LO-fucking-L at unironically calling someone a cuck. Have a fun day being mad about shit that doesn't matter. 
---
Thanks.  He’s my driving [buddy ](https://imgur.com/a/hWWPYHx)   Here’s the view today. 
---
I agree that some fusion core drain from using VATS while in power armor is acceptable, and I also agree with your point regarding damage output versus survivability. Note that I also have a PA melee character that uses neither VATS nor Full Charge and that character is in the same position as yours in that I could use the same fusion core for a VERY long time. What I don't agree with is how ridiculously quick my fusion cores drain on my VATS character. To play devil's advocate, my melee character can one shot nearly everything with or without a power attack, the latter which minimally drains the fusion core, much like my VATS character. Both should be in a similar position in relation to damage/survivability and related fusion core usage, no?
---
Lone wanderer doesn't give bonus XP and even if it did it wouldn't cover all the mobs you're potentially losing to someone who can one shot them.
---
But why
---
This is wicked dude fucking hell
---
Life in Appalachia was NOT good to Jill.
---
In your scenario, everyone who does it is still a thief. The bank is liable for the losses for not fixing it or taking the unit out of service while the bug exists.
---
It is possible for everyone involved to be in the wrong.
---
Honestly you couldnt be any farther from the truth. I saw a bunch of whiney little shits reveling in the thought that a bunch of peoples hard work and spent time was about to go to waste. It was seriously fucking pathetic. Ive obviously struck a few chords with those exact little shits. Oops.
---
I get it. Guild Leaders work hard but if there are a lot of trusted "staff" the work gets easier
---
"KRUSTY KRAB FUN FAIR"
---
Yeah. It actually kills in 1 and a quarter shot now. It was actually a buff, not a nerf.
---
I meant the BoS. Sorry, should have been more clear
---
I've long maintained that whoever pays the salaries of the wannabe journalists at Polygon is getting ripped off.
---
I run stealth as well, but with 15 strength because I'm a *terrible* packrat. So I decided to lean into shotguns and a little melee as well.
---
If you have some points to spare, check out the "Enforcer" perk. It's grossly overpowered, but is one of my best friends when plans go South. When stealth fails, it makes dealing with anything less than a scorchbeast *much* simpler!
---
What is up with the psyops on reddit regarding this game?
---
Proof Polygon never knew what they were talking about, ha. but you shouldn't have linked it, wouldn't want them to get site views. Or make any money
---
Can't remember which outlet, but after Bethesda fixed the New Year's Eve/day bug that locked up the silo's they reported that players "can get back to nuking their friends". It further solidifies the theory that most people writing about this game don't even play it. They have absolutely no idea what any of the basics of this game are.
---
I've never actually crafted them and I could be mistaken, but I thought I had a couple helmet options listed in my armor crafting menu. 
---
Nice. Thanks for posting this. 
---
I noticed this a while back, and recently I moved C.A.M.P. and Now when I fast travel I spawn in a lake
---
Irrational fears often are. 
---
Yeah very true
---
Not gonna lie, my favorite one is "I ain't a commie but I get where they're coming from"
---
It's beautiful
---
Damn that lady has seen some shit. By level 200 she should be a ghoul.
---
Well my str is only 9 and I have no room for damage perks there but my rifles have worked for me in all ranges like I run a stealth sniper build with vats and gun fu. I just pull up vats and head shot everything in med to close range
---
Actually, now that I've thought more about it, I'm certain I do.  I believe when I scrapped an assaultron head it unlocked a plan for making an assualtron helmet.
---
No thank YOU!
---
 Hidden upside to that "feature" - I can access my stashbox from the 1st floor or 2nd floor. :P
---
I want some xmas lights on mine that say "want to trade 4 shiny krabby in pokemon go"
---
"Tell me sir, when did you stop beating your wife?"
---
I know. I took the time to get one and its ammo. 
---
We don’t have that problem anymore. 
---
Containers. 
---
Well you're not being reasonable. That's true. Just name calling and being nasty because the other person disagrees. That doesn't inspire sympathy. 
---
I've also been called a liar, so perhaps it's *you people* that should piss off to r/fallout so the adults can talk about the best way forward instead of sifting through bitching and whining about made up bullshit or stupid opinion pieces with **BETHESDA** in the title.
---
Or perhaps people can sort it TF out and stop being shitty to each other. Just an idea.
---
‘It’s not their fault for being negative, it’s your fault for being negative about they being negative’
---
Wait, is cheating and using exploits considered "hard work"?
---
No patch has come out... so nothing has changed.
---
I've just won it
---
The holo tapes should stay though. I like putting the "Where am I?" tape in people's homes. It's my way of leading them to the path of enlightenment, they gotta figure out where he is.
---
i guess you weren't paying attention.  bethesda didnt delete dupes.  they ran a script that targetted any large stacks of super rare gear and rare nuka cola and reduced it to 1.  theres no way in there engine to detect if an item is a dupe or legit.
---
It's been a rough 15 minutes.
---
How did you got it?
---
Try moving your CAMP thingy around to different spots in your CAMP. Then try fast travelling.
---
Did you specifically use the location I listed? 
---
It pumps rare encounters in higher recurrence than any other spot I’ve seen.
---
It’ll get you eventually. Cheaters can’t stop cheating.  
---
They don’t even learn how to actually play a game, so how could they?  
---
You know it’s coming. 
---
It's amazing when i hear a giant explosion in the distance, and i go find a parking lot full of burning cars and dead supermutants and whatever they were fighting. 
---
Oh my god, I *do* have the plan for that. A guy in my Xbox club gave it to me. He got it from the same SBQ that dropped my prime receiver plan, and I put it in my stash and forgot about it. 
---
It’s been nerfed every patch to date. Wtf are you on?
---
It doesnt require a massive investment. Fast travel anywhere in the Ash Heap and pick up all the free fusion cores. I got 7 on one run.
---
Yeah I guess, it’s just fun to find the unique items around the world, take the mascot suits for example.
---
Thanks! The levels between the 10s gave me plenty of time to think it over. 
---
Well, I also haven't played the game since early December. Been playing Rimworld instead.
---
You are absolutely correct. It is damage mitigation, not an xp buff.
---
PVP over workshops is very rare. Also you're just popping in for a few seconds at each one so you don't really need to worry about it. 
---
Last patch that changed anything was a month ago and was Fusion Generators in the wild no longer being 100% spawns.
---
So what change was made recently that the OP is ranting about?  None...
---
Updooting for visibility. I found it via a comment a couple of days ago and it's a breath of fresh air.
---
Reddit acct isn't new , one year old , so there's that.
---
I would like to see some video evidence or emails from Microsoft,something, though as well to back up this claim
---
Source? I'm a bit out of the loop.
---
Well usually the enemies aren’t bullet sponges. But I went through 75% of all my ammo for all my guns trying to get this sword lol. The “bullet sponge” only happens when I encounter higher level enemies 
---
yeah you make anything that sounds like not a blood thirsty mob you find yourself burning at the stake...
---
Melee scaling/balancing should probably be considered a separate issue, as it's completely out of line when compared by any metric, not only when comparing fusion core drain.
---
what platform are you on? might help with finding someone to give you in game help, im on ps4, psn: Silune  
---
20-30's are pretty rough for everyone slow to lvl, almost to decent perk setup but not quite there yet. still getting to find your balance on what scrap you always need to watch for and what you can bypass to make things a lil easier. 
---
also could look into other subs for fallout like r/fo76FilthyCasuals (and several others) see if someone matches your playtimes you could team up with from time to time.. 
---
fallout being the survival type genre, its going to rely heavily on hunting and gathering.. best advice i could give you is kinda against the grain of what most games push for which is the linear get here do this, now get there and do that, as fast as possible.. take your time, almost meander, keep it in the back of your mind "hey i need to go in this general direction to get there." but take your time dont rush it kill and loot your way there slowly.
---
ive leveled more times just from randomly walking across things to kill than trying to rush to a point. other night needed to go to watoga but was kinda bored so i walked there from camden park, took me roughly 2 hours, but i discovered 3 new locations and prolly went through 2000 ammo killing things along the way, plus lots of good scrap.  
---
20's-30's in fallout 76 is pretty much like real life teenage angst years, think your an adult, but later seeing you were still pretty much a kid and it seems to take forever to grow out of.. as others said, shotgun and enforcer, makes fights alot easier, couple good shots stops things from rushing to melee you, they are either on ground or on knees. build i prefer is sneak sniper (i find high vantage points, snipe from a distance usually close to a choke point for things runnin at me).. perks are pretty open and it goes to what helps you most everyone has different ideas on what is useful and what perks they full time, watch any youtube players/videos and later you will look at them and ask yourself "why is so and so using "good doggy" when it only needs to be equipped when eating a can of dog food?   
---
my suggestion is just slow down, quit trying to rush it, to finish the story line and just let it happen.. kinda like sex, take your time and enjoy it.. 
---
as far as areas and strong mobs, watch an area you wanna go to for awhile, meander around, farm something in a low lvl area, and watch a spot for quite awhile.. then when you have seen no ones been there in say like an hour, no high lvls run through, then go there so the mobs spawn closer to your level, and easier to kill and handle.
---
If I’m able to become a super mutant, better believe I’m going to make a Grahm/Strong soundboard.
---
I love seeing progression pictures of characters. This one has got to be the top of that list. The album is amazing! 
---
That works too!
---
And the Bethesda bots swoop in to bury shit once again.
---
When you have that much load, $/servers is not what you count. 
---
$/container is. 
---
I’m a consultant for a major vendor in the space with a PaaS product, and the PaaS layer has a license/subscription cost too, And that can be tied to sockets, and that’s even higher than that of the tin. Keeping your cost down very requires keeping the number of CPU sockets low. 
---
So customers end up buying a smaller number super-dense systems, rather than a larger number of medium sized ones, to run the same number of required containers.
---
It’s for a quest. It’s not very good right now. I have to kill 6 different creatures. It’s in part of the golf course. I can’t remember exactly where off the top of my head. It’s only 16 damage as of right now
---
OP was just ranting about something not true, and then deleted all his posts.
---
I didnt know playing the game, saving caps and good loot to trade was cheating. Well fuck me. 
---
I spent hours and hours grinding for good loot. Saving lead, steel, and gunpowder to sell ammo. Finally happened across a bloodied, explosive, +agility black powder pistol. Truly a god roll weapon. I used the cash from that to buy an AAE handmade for 12000 caps. Was I cheating? Cuz if it was, well Fuckin A ban me right now Bethesda. Along with about 20k of the 21k subscribers over on r/Market76
---
I've tried moving it a little bit, I'll try some more though, thanks!
---
Thank you so much! 
---
I like that this game is so bad they keep having to make brand new safe spaces every time the old one decides the game is bad.  
---
I don't see any there up by toxic valley are they far apart from one another?? 
---
Wood bookcases my friend. You can double them up and have them face each other or face a wall or whatevs. It's not a bar per se but can get the job done.
---
I really enjoy my build and it us viable in 90% of the game. 
---
K thanks for the help.
---
Do they stack?
---
Notice how no one will say anything to you? Cuz how dare someone take a step back and look at the whole picture. No. Blind fanboyism till the cows come home.
---
Real talk. Your later pics look like me when my mohawk was super fucking long. Is that what the hairstyle is supposed to be?
---
No way. I’ve been offering 5-10k,weapons, and armor for it, and you got it for free. RNG Jesus isn’t too kind. Guess your hunt got cut short haha.
---
Have you tested/checked what those weapons do now when the nerf of TS and E is done?
---
Flux isn't a problem, it's the hardened and glowing masses, and the fluids that I can never find :(
---
It's caps. I bet they eat them.
---
I watched a guy do 3 back to back the other day, no more then 15 minutes between them.  I assume he went through each silo since you can’t go into one that recently launched.  You can however still be in a silo and if someone ahead of you launches you won’t be able to, I think this is what OP hit 
---
I think it would have to be PvP.  Otherwise every time you passed another player they would attack you out of reflex
---
/r/outoftheloop
---
How did they get rid of the duping?  
---
after seeing this I kind of want to make a character who gets a new scar every time he dies based off how he died - set on fire burn wound yoa gui to the face scar that one half naked clown with a drill who stalked me well those wounds are on the inside....
---
It's a plane ITS A DAMN PLANE!!!!!
---
,....  or i'd be satisfied w them dropping the rule selling only returns 25% etc cap back to their cap stash
---
Like you don't need to move your CAMP in the way that it costs caps to do it, just move the object around to different locations within the CAMP and it should change the spawn in point.
---
Yeah, no joke 
---
I agreed wholeheartedly. I'm not calling for any nerfs to melee. It would be fantabulous if they buffed our poor fusion cores, especially for us PA VATS folks so that we can all ride the massive pain train as long as we like!
---
I had heard vats hit cores,  but i was consciously not sprinting or using power attacks.   I would target with vats then exit and aim. 
---
But my cores were draining. So I just spammed the button and saw it.  Makes sense.  Vats hits AP to aim,  too, and cores are PA ap.
---
I’ve heard the roads in reality are about the same as FO76. True?
---
Maybe, I hadn't considered that. I always thought it was a regular hairstyle with one side shaved off. 
---
Big time runway show  !!! And if you do it in front of newbs at the overseers camp they go insane trying to get into them , it’s quite amusing !!! Lol! 
---
#¿por qué no los dos?
---
Get both. Run around with the quality-of-life perks and then switch in the heavy hitters for the big fights.  You don't have to be a 24/7 min-maxxer, and you don't have to pretend you're helping in SBQ fight. Swap in those combat perks, pop some Psycho, and actually contribute. Then go back to your running-around build.
---
Yeah but all I really want is BoS paint for my T60. And every time I turn in Technical Data, all I get is purified water. 
---
Indeed! I saw the same thing. It's wonky, too, that VATS in PA also uses AP in addition to draining fusion cores.
---
The majority of the negative posts are by trolls recycling negativity. Not many new complaints. 
---
Server seems much more stable. Fewer posts from "fake victims" of the duper/griefer. 
---
Just need to get beyond the troll psyop bs.
---
No one is defending Bethesda. Just not feeling sorry for exploiters/cheaters for getting caught out and their toys removed.
---
I use the bookcases too. There is a "cabinet" plan that I was hoping would be something like counters or kitchen cabinets but it just gives you those basic metal cabinets of varying sizes that are all over Sanctuary in Fallout 4.
---
Oh wow, that's a super useful link
---
Much creative. You must play Minecraft.
---
If you want the paint, I’d check the bazaar. I’ve seen a couple xboxers selling it for 2k ish. I got licking and got the plan early. If you just want paint I can do it for free.
---
loool :D
---
Save The Zombies! 
---
No artifacts, or crashing in anything else.
---
 I can run AIDA64 FPU stress test on the CPU 24 hours without issues; and 3D Mark, TimeSpy, or Superposition on loop for the same without crashes.
---
CPU peaks at 60 degrees on hottest core.
---
GPU temps depends on games and loads. Max temp is always 83, but that's because of the NVIDIA blower design on the card. Even then I've never seen my GPU frequency dip below 1500Mhz, which is already above the stated Boost of 1455Mhz. Usually in Fallout 4, and 76 it runs around 1600Mhz plus between 73-83 celsius.
---
Actually funny, the GPU is mostly at "idle" for performance cap reasons when running Fallout games. https://i.imgur.com/qAwAe4U.jpg
---
As mentioned before, the only crashes I get are CTD in this game.
---
This system has been purring along fine since it's build was complete in 2015; and only the GPUs have been changed.
---
Had the Titan V since early last year, and this is the only program causing any issues whatsoever.
---
I'm downloading the drivers now; as the only other games I've had the time to play lately is heavily graphics modded Fallout 4m and Witcher 3.
---
Awesome. I can't wait to run into it.  
---
It's a glitch, don't remember how its done exactly? I think you have to be doing the monster mash event and have the mask equipped then server hop. 
---
We must have our camps in the same spot because that's my routine as well. I don't have enclave either.  I walk between the 2 watoga vendors and I walk from my camp to Pleasantville. I end my play sessions at either Flatwoods or Charleston. The next load-in, I walk to Sutton then walk to Whitespring and then fast travel to the rest from there. Hate to spend so much caps on traveling.
---
Ok a officialy licensed shirt put out by Bethesda is wrong and your right? Ok man. 
---
Here is a build that I am enjoying a lot....  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3e5595&amp;d=s92sf2ss2sg2pe2eo2ej4c72cm0i44am2au2l71lu2e82el2s72sb2&amp;w=e12ij2if2ik0iq2&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3e5595&amp;d=s92sf2ss2sg2pe2eo2ej4c72cm0i44am2au2l71lu2e82el2s72sb2&amp;w=e12ij2if2ik0iq2&amp;n=)
---
It's a melee (unarmed) non-power armor build.  Thru hiker and traveling pharmacy mean I keep all chems and food on me (saves a ton of stash space).  The extra non-PA defense goes well with heavy armor like combat or marine.  If you don't want unarmed, grab the first rank only in the melee style you prefer.  3 ranks for +30% damage is better than 9 ranks for +60% damage.  I had incisor initially, but most enemies aren't really that armored.
---
Currently guns are so under-damaged and fragile, I kept banging my head against the wall trying to use them....  fragile, under-damaged AND they need ammo?  Pass for now.
---
Don't be annoyed at death.  Sometimes I die on purpose just to heal at early (Before cannibal) levels just to heal.  
---
Radiation is my biggest annoyance.  Grab a hazmat suit as soon as possible.  You can hunt in Whitesprings.  Free water and disease cure there plus most ghouls will have some form of radaway.  Great place to stock up since you won't be taking much rad damage in a hazmat suit.  Works when it's nuked too.  
---
Cannibal is so much fun... not only does it cure hunger but it has an excellent health regen.    I've used it IN combat to save my ass many times.  Very nice list of things you can eat.  So Whitesprings is a place with free water, free food and free disease cure....
---
Once you get starched genes (and class freak if you want), mutations, mutations, mutations!  I'd recommend finding someone who sells serums.  Marsupial, Talons, Twisted muscles, healing factor, scaly skin and grounded go great for this build. (No need for talons if not going unarmed)
---
I'm 65 now and only a few things annoy me...  
---
Scorchbeasts...  unless they land and then they are dead, 
---
 Annihilator sentry bots (they have a missile attack that just hurts, maybe I need to swap in fireproof when fighting them)
---
Anyway, just my two caps worth.  Have fun.
---
I suppose you could dress him up as a clown sometimes too - didn't the shriners have some sort of mini-car clown races?  Also - I think I saw a fez in one of the threads showing images from future atom shop releases.  So you may be in luck!
---
K thanks
---
No, this ones turned into too much of a hate bandwagon. This is a bigger sub, but for all the people apart of it, it’s always the same dozen or so people posting the same toxic sludge about the same KNOWN issues. This tells me that there’s a large portion of this sub that genuinely enjoys the game and wants to be a part of a community they can enjoy it with, but may not know where else to go. This sub is one big “fuck Fallout 76” circlejerk and I want the rest of the fan base to know this isn’t the only option.
---
The Krusty Kra-a-a-a-a-b Kra-a-a-a-a-b Pi-zza, is the pizza, for you and
---
ME-E-EEEEEEEEE
---
I do agree that is only black in oblivion. Love that game by the way. 
---
Sorry, I'm a newb what's wtb?
---
I'm guessing you're complaining about scaly skin. 
---
Could be a little difficult if some dont fit the lore and time lines yet
---
This is for me! I bought the game the day it launched. I'm a level 32 with a job that requires lots of hours during the week and a family.  I thoroughly am still enjoying the game when I get to play! I love the exploring, the map/Appalachia is the star of this game.  this was also my biggest fear of Fallout being online is that people rank up way faster and i'll miss out on events that are above my level.  
---
There were literally posts saying there excited to hear how many people lost there weapons. How is that not toxic? Seriously?
---
 The people who bought stuff off of the market werent bothering you. They bought their high end shit and moved on. Its just the people who either couldnt afford to buy that shit, or didnt have the time to grind for it getting upset.
---
Ill said it once and ill it again, you all come off as jealous kids. 
---
"Haha fuck that guy with the tse, serves him right for having a cooler gun than me, when though it literally didnt effect me in the slightest"
---
Yeah, I fill up the cash registers and suitcases with extra ammo and plans. If I'm out and I see a paper bag with loot, I'll take it and either sell it or stash it in a visible container so it doesn't disappear from the world as quickly. If the server is empty, I'll hang on to it and sell it or drop it for someone next session. But the ones I fight for, I'll be darned if they are getting dropped. Give me my hard earned caps. I guess that's the closest thing to selling ammo in this game lol. 
---
Text-book example of negative troll psyops.
---
Phrase a lie in the form if a question. Offer no evidence, don't contact tech support....just try to poison the well.
---
Tell me sir, when did you stop beating your wife?
---
" I started in full PA, when I got the mask it auto removes the PA helmet. Just before the end of the round, I put my PA helmet back on to use the headlamp. The next round started and it left the mask in my inventory and directed me to go pick up another mask. Hope that helps some. "  
---
I found another post about this, try this method?
---
Sure Bethesda could introduce some goulish makeup some how 🤔
---
Edit a few more assets to get the greeny brown as skin colour, load of burns and scars etc.
---
&gt; Well read a bit better then, i havent posted on a fallout thread for weeks before this.
---
Dude, you have literally written like 15+ comments in this thread arguing and just about every one of them is needlessly toxic and nasty towards people who don't share your opinion. Some are just straight up name calling. Scrolling a bit further in your history shows you were doing the same just a week ago (shocker). That is not by any stretch of the imagination what "moving on" looks like. You even just completely proved you have no intention of moving on- 
---
&gt;Also im not gonna sit there whilst people like op make these idiotic posts declaring "the game is fine" lol. 
---
Won't to buy
---
 Not sure why you’re responding to me.
---
Its my post
---
Thanks for the excellent info! 
---
Hello, that's good to hear and puts me at ease as well that you're checking on things.
---
I don't see anything wrong with your child but it's no surprise to me that there are issues with this game.
---
Something is bound to pretty go wrong for atleast someone. Too bad it has to be you.
---
Also, I know. It's predated but believe me, I've seen no notable performance difference when I used the latest ones. Only thing I got were space invaders saying XD all over the screen. Mine was running stable from last year march when I updated it. Well, up until now. lol
---
And jetpacks for that part but the jetpack makes more sense
---
And then, at night, we jump OUT  of the rabbit...
---
Oh Thanks
---
Trolls gotta troll. Seriously.
---
cripple and kite will get you through these tough levels.  
---
Use perks that cripple or slow, aim for the legs. Move, shoot, move, shoot. Stay out of range and pull your enemies carefully.
---
Or get a hazmat suit and hang out in the nuked gold course sniping or firebombing groups that are being wiped out by high levels. The wall around the pool is a great safe spot to sit in. Works well when not nuked, too. Ask a high level grinder if you can follow along and snipe from their pulls. Stay way back and only shoot those they have already damaged.
---
I've got a Berserkers Handmade if your interested. 
---
&gt; bury shit
---
Very apt description of this topic.  At least you admitted it.
---
Big thanks for taking the time to put down all that you've learnt. I'll keeps this as a reference.
---
Really not interested in PVP but that's just me. I have experimented with the odd piece of Armor with some effects such as AutoStim and Vanguard. AutoStim never processed regardless how many or few pieces I wore, died a few times testing,  so dumped that idea. Vanguard was giving an DR increase but I play mostly maxed health and didn't like living on that particular edge.
---
I think my project for now will be to find Heavy CA with +STR to boost up my Special Stat.
---
Since I started this thread I've added 3\* *Barbarian* (been saving up level points) and dropped *Travelling Pharmacy* with large quantities of chems and StimPacks that I was lugging around, I've had a good clear out of both inventory and Stash so feel allot less encumbered.
---
I just ran Uranium fever with these changes and my full set of HCA BOS now gave the following stats.
---
**523** DR - **579** ER - 5 RR *still with shielded enclave forest under armor*
---
So something helped, *Barbarian* added 80 DR apparently. Still no meaty things eaten.
---
While writing this up my stats dropped to:
---
**442** DR - **479** ER - 5 RR so something is giving a time based buff.
---
Also I hit Max Caps while running Uranium Fever so may as well buy Marsupial again  (had it before but lost it while playing the mutation lottery) may come in handy but could look into making BOS sets in various levels.
---
Thanks again :)
---
There’s plenty of players that I’ll encounter that are lvl 100+ strutting around in decked out power armor with the shiniest guns. But for every one of them I come across, I see 3 other blips on the map that are lvl 1 or 2 just emerging from Vault 76.
---
Don't expect the game to be "Fallout 5".  Some adjustments to gameplay are required.  For example, you have limited space to store junk, so inventory management is a must.
---
If a higher-level player appears and a paper bag appears in front of them, don't run away thinking it is a trap.  They are gifting you with resources.
---
Similarly, check cash registers and suitcases at train stations.  Other players regularly put unused plans, weapons, ammo, etc into them for other players to find.
---
because fuck deaf gamers.
---
Agreed it is not working, but whether this is as intended only BGS know. If it isn't something most people care about I doubt it's even on their radar. 
---
also wanted to add in, dont be afraid to party with someone just because ya have no mic. not really needed for this game, emotes work as a basic sign language in this game to some degree, i have been in quite a few groups with people that dont have mics and seem to be able to get a pretty solid degree of communication going through emotes.. especially if they can hear me. i can/will usually ask them to thumbs up if they can hear me, and up and down work for yes/no, they find something or wanna head a certain way follow me works and so on.. get attention for a legendary so on.  
---
had someone sent me an inv last week i didnt know he didnt have a mic i asked him if he needed help? thumbs up.. quest help? got thumbs up, told him to put it as only one on the screen so he turned off all his other quest things except for one he was needin help on, and we went through it.. 
---
i remember one time i was in my 60's had a 200something at the time invite me to party in a nuke run, (they wanted to bounce rad sponge) joined em, they never talked to me on mic, and i hadnt had my mic plugged in, but spent roughly 90 minutes with em following their emotes to come this way or that.. then as the nuke ended i heard them cough or something.. put my mic on and thanked em for party during the run, we talked for bout another half hour or so she didnt know i had a mic so hadnt bothered even asking and mine being unplugged she had no clue. thats how i found out just how beneficial rad sponge was. 
---
 Because almost no one understands their junk. They just pick up everything instead. It lazy and lame. 
---
 I have a friend who plays F4 and he has to pick up every fucking thing. He is 450lbs+ so that might have something to do with it. I can't watch the silly fucker pant for long. ;)
---
You think criticism = being hateful, whining and bashing the devs? That's honestly just sad and pathetic, and I do pity anyone with that mindset. A community doesn't have to be a cesspool of loathing and outrage in order to have their voices heard.  
---
I tried it at level 35 alone and perhaps I got a shit down but the robots did not stop respawning. The scorchbeast had never ending sonic attacks so I could barely see. I did not hide in an elevator but the onslaught was absolutely non stop. Glad to know that it wasnt like that for everyone. I went back at 50 with a team mate, and the scorchbeast was much better but the robot spawn was the same. Non stop.
---
We could go all warframe in damage types, but as of now they are correct to the projectile.
---
Ballistic is a piece flying towards you and energy is a projectile with little to no mass but high in heat(sorry cryolator, can't really put you anywhere for it to make sense). And radiation, which is self explanatory.
---
Do we need all the classifications to begin with? Aside from what i read and energy weapons not benefiting from armor penetration, it hardly matters, IF they fix them eventually.
---
For the record gauss rifle was ballistic since the beginning of fallout. 
---
Lvl 1. 10/10. like a screen door
---
Artifacts are always a problem; last time I had them an HBM stack on my Fury X was dying. Lucking the german fellas gave me a full refund when I RMA'd it a year after use.
---
Doing a DDU clean install of the 399.xx drivers now. Fingers crossed this helps. As Bethesda support have been absolutely useless.
---
They just keep linking this https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/42913
---
Over, and over, and over again. None of the steps have helped so far.
---
Worst case, the game might just not be compatible with the Titan V driver stack and hardware; which would be extremely rare. Then again so few Titan V owners, even bother using it for gaming not just work :P
---
I shall try Life Saving and some other effects as I find them, mix it up a little.
---
I'd max Str, take 3 points out of luck.  (only need super duper while crafting)  add one of the other carry weights from Str (Ordinance express or such) plus the extra Str gives extra carry weight...
---
Taking what out of context? Are you entirely incapable of commenting without trying to invalidate things by spewing bullshit?
---
My favorite was months ago, low level was running from I think a pack of dogs and I started sniping the dogs. You could see him spinning around looking.
---
I may have shot trees and stuff around him to play with him. Was quite hilarious.
---
If you want the plan, I’d check the market. I’ve seen a couple xboxers selling it for 2k ish. I got licking and got the plan early. If you just want paint I can do it for free.
---
Hmm.. I've never noticed this until last night, so I assumed it was from the patch.
---
I don't think that's possible
---
The luv 5 picture was priceless. 
---
Yeah I knew about all that but I haven't heard about them actually removing the ability to dupe. What is stopping me from duping my items today?
---
 Well done. Your herring is cooked now. Damn its all red. ;)
---
Would you do 1k?
---
Haha thanks, one of my favorites.
---
Because I was level 80 and I got a level 30 all rise
---
Needs mouth flame throwers.
---
Aaaw.. i was thinking that was a reward obtainable with candys
---
Yeah you only need them active when crafting.
---
You should have gotten a level 50
---
It's a 50/50 thing for me. I want the paint, yes. But the last two weeks or so, I've been hoarding power armor, and I'm about to open up my power armor shop. So I want it for me, but I'd like to also have it available for that as well. If you're willing to paint a couple sets for me that would be awesome. 
---
Tip: keep a full set of Unyielding Legendary armor. Mod it with Ultra-Light and it will barely take up any stash space.
---
When you need to craft something important, like power armor, put on your Unyielding suit and jump off a building or stand in rads until you are nearly dead.
---
This makes you very smart. For reasons. Now craft awesome stuff with your +15 INT +15 LCK.
---
So, guess its forever broken then?
---
Rip me then I guess lol 
---
Where'd you purchase them?  I've never seen them anywhere and I also am looking for the heavy combat base plans.  I found the base plans for the arms at the Harper Ferry vendor and was hoping that I'd see the chest and legs there but so far no luck.  Just curious if anyone has seen them and if they are level vendor hidden, I'm 66th lvl.  Thanks.
---
Yup if it’s level 50
---
Yeah, and since they are wasting so much dev time fixing stuff to make the game less buggy who knows when new content will ever arrive.
---
I don't think you're aware of what you're talking about whatsoever.  
---
I'm the one that posted the thread from that sub.  
---
&gt;Thats it! After 300 hours im just gonna have to keep playing this damn game. Another great patch/hotfix, whatever you want to call it, by bethesda today.  
---
Sure, this isn't a passive aggressive slight towards all those stupid "I'm fed up and quitting the game!" posts that are on here all the time.
---
How did you make it float, and how did you get in it? My camp is semi floating, I’d love to make it completely floating 
---
True that and I believe they know about those problems and are working on them. But just fixing current problems won't make the game better or keep a fan base , the game needs more . 
---
Wash Toby's balls.
---
I am still a little torqued that I basically paid $200.00 for a piece of shit. I haven't been very vocal about it until this post but I mean god damn....I can see why their might be some toxicity thrown around. I LOOVE the fallout franchise. I probably have over 1000 hours between fo3 fo:nv fo4 and fo76. All I ask for is for the game to work and deliver what was advertised. The keep announcing patch after patch that basically consist of a bigger stash of bug fixes while creating more god damn bugs. I fell like as a huge fan and money spender(I never splurged on a collectors edition before and boy do I regret it). I thought surely I would get and experience at least as = to FO4 and its expansion. Surely it would be a step up from that right? WROOOOONGGG!!! I deserve better.......we deserve better.....
---
Much appreciated Bethesda. Lowkey great company and will always play fallout 
---
oh nice didn't know that i will try it.
---
My steampunk cowboy thanks you.
---
Or keeping her body alive with chems!

Thanks, my wife and I just bought it and have enjoyed the game so far, it clearly has shortcomings but we love fallout and each other so we look past it. This sub has been overwhelmingly toxic so it’s good to know there’s a place that isn’t just a bitching echo chamber.
---
Yeah, but this also never happened to me. That's why it's weird.
---
Sounds good. I hope it's gonna work.
---
I also know they're probably linking you the same thing since you're most likely talking to a bot taking messages. xD
---
I don't think its uncompatible. There's definitely something up that shouldn't be.
---
Well most the outfits we have now are from fallout 4. And 76 takes place hundreds of years before fallout 4 so with that being said I dont think itd be much of a problem.
---
I can do that. GT is Xwolfpackleader
---
I am not sure what your mythical dinner has to do with my hearing impairment.
---
Very interesting, huge difference on B&amp;A, but still resembles who she once was. 
---
^ lmao, if he thinks ubisoft stuff belongs here he probably just fell for a scam or something 
---
True but people are asking for ncr ranger stuff and thats not even possible yet
---
I don’t know what they did but for some reason I have just been hit like I have a target on my back. 
---
3 45 Windigos, 1 50 Scorch beast, 1 80 Scorch beast, 1 65 mothman Glowing, 1 glowing alien purple 61, and a 45 Grafton monster in 1 hour
---
What the #*#%!
---
That's true of any game.  Even GTA5:O still has money and duping glitches.  You'll never have an online game that is completely free of exploits.  You just have to hope the developer stays on top of them and fixes them quickly.
---
I WAS TURNED INTO AN IRRADIATED MONSTER BY A NUCLEAR APOCALYPSE AND ALL I GOT WAS THIS DAMNED SIGN
---
Guess we'll  just have to wait and see what bethesda decides to do.
---
 Its not a reasonable argument. Certainly there is a small population with hearing problems, that's universal. We don't shit on phones because they don't take that into account.
---
I just leave my paper bag in plain sight at Artisan's Corner in Whitesprings. I also leave stuff in the cash register if I take something, usually...if I have anything...Like, take a Legendary leave a legendary.
---
Guess we'll  just have to wait and see what bethesda tries to do.
---
I love it! Very creative compared to what I have seen in my travels. That was an awesome idea!
---
Maybe they should do these like they did cap stashes where it's a client-side container that you loot for any quest related holtapes/items and the container will just check if you have it before giving it to you.
---
Of course this doesn't fix the ones you already have but I mean going forward. 
---
I don't even have a full set of power armor yet! Tho I will be close since I found the mission to craft some excavator armor.  but I'm enjoying my hunting rifle, sledge, and my leather armor. I like to keep the armor over the vault suit to keep me more grounded.  I like to think that my character is a real gung ho vault tech employee.  ya know, those employees that are on the first week or so of a new job. My only complaint is I wish the C.A.M.P. was as large and in depth as FO4, which I understand why it isn't. 
---
I kinda want a card game
---
&gt;  I stare at the stack of 2 items haunting my perfect inventory. 
---
I feel your pain :(
---
Well, consensus seems to be it just randomly pops up and can't be triggered. Too bad, since my luck is about as good as an anti-rabbit's foot...Thanks for the observations anyway, folks!
---
Helping lower levels is one of my favorite things to do to reduce my stash/carry weight. I regularly look for new players at vault 76, overseer's camp and flatwoods to give items I'm not going to use. I can say it wasn't me or my group i play with that helped though. Our highest level is like 93.
---
I do agree with you this sub is the most toxic one I’ve seen. And I was on the fallout sub. But this subs saving grace is the fact it can sometimes be fine. 
---
Im right there with you. In my life ive played almost all of the fallouts, oblivion, skyrim, dishonored 1, 2, and DOA, the doom series and the quake series. I honestly feel betrayed by Bethesda. Then to see the people with blinders on laughing about it, its just sad.
---
I enjoy that subgroup.
---
It is. I'll be on after a couple of hours. Does that work for you?
---
So, before you ignore, you ask if they are deaf?
---
I was just gonna use the sign to promote my waifu.
---
I mean it's only 1400 if you _only_ go to vendors then logout. But yeah the point is solid; even with vendors and 5-6 hours of actual gameplay I still end up with only like 3k profit for the day. Depends on how you play.
---
"Nuka Cola? More like Puka Cola.....get it? Because of - naw you get it
---
Unions are socialism in Fallout. The do Military Boot Camp quest for details
---
Great, thanks! I fussed around for 2 hours, finally exploring the whole silo and opening all locked doors/terminals.
---
No. You don’t win it. Someone figured out how to take it out of the event. But it’s since been patched for a while now. 
---
I managed to trade for one, but after they fixed all the duped items I don’t know if you can find anyone selling them now. 
---
I got what you meant, thank you  😊
---
This sub was great for a while. As bethesda continuously fucked up, people trying to feel like they werent ripped off started eating each other alive. Now the fan base is divided between people who want to play but cant deal with it and people with there fingers in their ears going "lalalalalalalalalala nothings wrong here lalalalala"
---
I mean seriously, even Bethesda decided not to completely wipe out all the duped weapons, and these people are still foaming at the mouth.
---
Lvl 5 looks like she wasn't ready for what she found in the wasteland....
---
Lvl 40 must have been after she met her first scortchbeast... got all HARD
---
Yup I’ll be on in a few 
---

Great thanks 
---
.....there's a grape soda? I know there's nuka-cherry, never saw a grape one... grape mentats maybe?
---
I think you are being sarcastic. Nobody would love being disconnected after launching a nuke.
---
Seriously though, this is a fear so I do not even try to invade a silo until I've been playing on a server for at least an hour. It's no biggie if I do disconnect though. I just think of all the free nukes I've benefitted from since I've played.
---
Word up, thanks for the info.
---
OP will be sad though....
---
It's been fixed...
---
The settlement building isn’t quite as vast as FO4, that is true, but while I’m turning people on to new subs, r/fallout76settlements shows just how creative people can be in these smaller spaces. Might give you some inspiration!
---
I agree with your view of the game, but I am not a casual player. I'm very much the opposite. But I love the game, I play every day. 
---
And thing is Bethesda don’t have a “fuck it” button like say Disney. They don’t have a back up plan. So I’m giving the game a few months to try and see if it gets better with age. Cause if it does it’ll still be worth my time and would be worth the money I spent. I just need to wait and see 
---
I would like to know your location.
---
You sound worth the 10 cap bounty.
---
&gt;If you genuinely are enjoying this game, despite its flaws and balance issues, this is not the sub for you.
---
I do still enjoy the game despite its bugs and flaws and this sub is the place for me.
---
Won't be going anywhere that [dumps on a sub I enjoy (and the posters at the same time), while poaching](https://media.giphy.com/media/kZD8cN1MycfKw/giphy.gif). 
---
It is better for server stability, people could crash the server by having too big of a settlement.
---
I see, so all negative comments will be removed. No thanks.
---
Expanding it should happen. All I have is a 2x3 rectangle that is 2 floors, one of each craft station,  a bed, fusion generator and 3 or 4 basic turrets and I'm at max limit.
---
Awesome! That's better than the one I found. Thanks!
---
 No, you are overdoing this for your own reasons. Ask for an "I am Deaf" emote if it means that much to you.
---
Why would they add a zombie mode to an open world game?
---
I tag these for search and keep everything I find, as I will regularly run out of them:
---
* Acid (for smelting, which is mostly iron &amp; lead ore for ammo)
---
* Adhesive (weapons/armor and misc)
---
* Ballistic Fiber (Armor)
---
* Lead (ammo)
---
* Nuclear Material (weapon crafting)
---
* Oil (grenades and misc)
---
* Plastic (bulking and sometimes shotgun shells)
---
* Screws (weapons/armor. Needed for lots of other stuff like generators and purifiers)
---
* Springs (power armor and other misc crafting)
---
* Steel (mostly for ammo, but I will use a lot for CAMP builds)
---
I also tend to pick up lots of Aluminum, Concrete, and Wood, though I'll sell the Al if I start to get too much.
---
Everything else I sell loose items over 100, and bulk items over 10. Some stuff like glass and bone shards that never get used I keep a bare minimum of.
---
“Filthy casual” is just a title, I don’t speak for the sub, but as long as you enjoys the game, I’m sure they’d love to have you!
---
This was my inspiration. 100%.
---
I agree. They don't need to make legendaries more common, but making effort vs reward more on par would be nice. Thank you for the pencil, 2 star legendary scorched. Thanks a lot.
---
Kind-of I do play only creative mode when I do, lol.
---
Beta player here, who got FO3/NV/and 4 on release, and who also deleted 76 from my console about two months ago.  Found this subreddit because I just did a google search along the lines of "is fallout 76 dead yet?"
---
My gf REALLY wants me to play the game again because the soundtrack is awesome.  I agree.  And I miss it.  And I miss that there seems like so much more Overseeer mission stuff to do, and I want to see where that leads. 
---
But there are just so many demoralizing issues. Randoms who trail you into danger then poach your bag when you get killed.  The fact that, if you're in a tough encounter and you die, you drop your bag and if you pick up ANYTHING else before retriving the bag, and you die, the first bag goes away. It was actually that experience that led to me uninstalling the game. And why's it so damn hard to get any good plans for anything?  I felt like I was running around with random trash equipped that I hated all the time, just because I couldn't get plans for anything good. 
---
So, I'm sort of looking back wishing I could like the game again.  But after reading all you guys, I probably will just stick to my other games. 
---
I'm 61 years old and the son of a WW2 Navy officer. I learned to curse, in all likelihood, decades before you were born. So I don't have delicate sensibilities.
---
I do have contempt for people whose language skills are so poor, however, that they must use profanity as a crutch. You seem to be among them. As for this:
---
&gt; And your irrelevant legal explanation is irrelevant. 
---
Congrats on your new job at the Department of Redundancy Department:
---
Tbh your just a dick man
---
Ah. I must have misunderstood. I thought it was you that said "sue a mic or I will ignore you". But why would I say such a thing?
---
\&gt; one big “fuck Fallout 76” circlejerk
---
No it's not. It's just that some of us don't melt when we hear bad words or run to a corner and rock back and forth when we hear criticism of the game. (I mean I do, sure, but not everybody does)
---
I’m so hurt 
---
By a bigger dick.
---
Can anyone confirm they deleted anything? I see item sale sites are still pushing duped items. Non of my suspect items got deleted.
---
You would have gotten a level 30 if you were between 30 and 39 when you finished the Mayor for a Day quest.  40 at 40-49, 50 at 50+.
---
Scaled rewards.
---
They're pretty close. Some of the scale is off a bit.
---
You paid 200 dollars for the collectable content. The game it self is only 60. So if you paid 200 for just the game you got scammed hard.
---
I’m level 35, and I’m in the same boat. I feel ya
---
Well, those turrets are why you’re at the limit. 
---
Exactly. There would be that guy who has WS filled with turrets.  Or another guy who builds a sky platform across the map that blocks out the sun.
---
Oh man! It looked so promising! It was playing so smooth; and then when I opened my CAMP; BAM! Crash to Desktop.
---
Drivers didn't fail, second monitor and streams still going smoothly.
---
Just sadly game screen flashed black, and back to desktop.
---
This time the ghouls weren't frozen at least, but they Usain Bolted through some buildings to attack some bloatflies.
---
That sub exist because of thin skinned fags like you who need a safe space to protect them from opinions they disagree with.
---
But you should know the risks of buying a game. You should also know that in any video game you do not own anything. 
---
I doubt a duper is going to come forward and admit it. I had a grognaks that i know for a fact was duped (cuz i found 2 in a bag right before the stash slash) and i still have that. 
---
I had 4k lead i bought a few days ago, I  was a bit worried about that but i still had it as well.
---
ROFL
---
Are you farming for the materials to build the flamethrower trap? I thought you just needed the perks to enable building them?
---
I got a feeling that might be the case :)
---
Good work, love it! ;)
---
Filthycasuals does not censor, plenty of posts pop up that highlight bugs in the game, flaming the game and making a mountain of a molehill, however, is not condoned.
---
It was on Xbox
---
to be honest I should’ve friended one of the people in the blast zone, would’ve been able to join back, but then again I shouldn’t have to compensate for something that is the server’s fault.
---
A shop or someone offering free stuff
---
No server, no matter how good, would be able to handle that 
---
You're at a workshop. Turns into pvp land when another player owns it. I'm not sure it was an exploit. 
---
That's what MSFT said it was
---
It's less about how much you play, and more about how seriously you take it all. 
---
I take my hope with lemon and honey, they should try it. FO76 is definitely my cup of tea.
---
Or people just don't deal with those same problems. 
---
I've not had any server issues in over a month. So either  my ps4 is magical or there is more going on then just Bethesda servers.
---
If Bethesda were to add outfits from 3/NV to 76, they’d have to be very specific about it. Pretty much, only things that would have existed from before the war, such as the vault suits. Vault suits could be very possible, since I believe files for the 111 suit were datamined from the atomic shop. But things like the Tunnel Snakes, NCR, Legion, those wouldn’t be possible, because all of them were founded much later than just 25 years after the bombs. 
---
From what I know. Been a bit since I've had time to log on.
---
You need the plans from Abby's bunker in the Mire.
---
Yeah, made them before the patch so I get full stacking :).
---
Do they tell you anywhere in the game how many ingame days you have played through since you've left the vault, per character?
---
What platform are you on?  If you're on PS4, I could make you one this weekend.
---
PC, why?
---
No I don't think so
---
I've got a bunch to lighten my load. My GT is Kaise7en, I should be on later tonight. I have at least one TSE handmade, pump shotgun, a couple cool melee, a perfect storm, a two shot Gatling gun. Thanks! 
---
What’s so uncool about the great and entertaining pics you have?
---
Awol unfortunelty isnt triggerable by coming in range, it does spawn every hour ish, but the event timer before it despawns is only 10-15 minutes so you gotta be checking your map often.
---
It seems to spawn about as often as uranium fever, but I think the timer for despawning uranium is 30 mins, which is why you see it more.
---
Also, plans are available at Harper's Ferry vendor.  There is a handmade that spawns regularly in Berkeley Springs.  If you look it up on YouTube, there is a video that walks you through finding it.
---
I'm positive they're coming. For the Atom shop. :(
---
some people hate lots of games, why does this one need to keep running off to make new subs and no other one does? 
---
 Well your name checks out. It was 'use' actually. If someone shows me an "I Am Deaf" emote I might try to communicate.  
---
 It is the reason my mic is on.
---
I have a video I sent to MSFT and Bethesda. Sorry I chose not to post it here for you trolls for privacy purposes for all involved.
---
The origin of the Phrase is "Better to be a Jack of all trades than a master of one, or none"
---
Food for thought
---
Screen shot them with you PlayStation and send them to your social media account.
---
Pretty sure the plan can be purchased from the Free State vendor bot. 
---
Its not about ownership, its about a waste of time. I grinded for hours and hours to get what I needed. I never duped anything, never did the exp glitch while it existed. I go and use an in game system to aquire it legitimately from another player, and POOF, its gone. 
---
I paid to enjoy this game. If my hardwork goes to waste, im angry. Its that simple. My reason for writing this post is that a bunch of jealous little kids thought it was funny that that could happen to thousands of people. 
---
No problem! 
---
I’d like to see additional drain associated with sprinting, power attacking, using the head lamp, and jumping. Just generally exploring at jog or walking speed should use barely anything. 
---
The Patrol Duty event at the prison, at your level, won't be the walk in the park it is for most higher-leveled characters. It should be good XP for you, and the handmade plans are on its rewards list; that's how I got mine. It's easy to re-run repeatedly by server hopping. [Details here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a10iwa/how_to_get_the_handmade_rifle_schematics_after/)
---
The magic conch says No
---
Or its just luck. In the beginning (when it was at its worst) i barely ever crashed. Now im guaranteed a crash at least once a night. This doesnt mean the games runs worse than before, because it clearly doesnt
---
you are right, but you are missing the point
---
"Nerf your outlook". I like that.
---
All the outfits or most that we have now are from fallout 4. Which is hundreds of years after the bombs  fell. So in that case the outfits and armor we can get now shouldn't be in 76 because they were founded hundreds of years after the bombs had fell and not 25 years after. We should have a whole new range of outfits and armor but we dont. We have fallout 4s. So there should be no problem adding Fo3 and New Vegas outfits. 
---
If you were on Xbox I would have made you one. 
---
I painted my main set with the Tricentennial paint scheme and the atom symbol popped up next to the name. Solved that issue. Coming up on level 50 and I'll get to bust out the good. So awesome stash going up to 800 on next patch.
---
Ditto, I’m at L32 and literally dropped a fat man, missile launcher and associated ammo in the till at Sutton. No use to me and of little value. 
---
You don't find Nuka Grape in the wild, I believe it's only sold upstairs in Whitesprings resort.
---
I have read that you don't actually have to power up the entire plant to get the fusion core processor working; that you only have to repair the cooling system, then head in and reboot the system.  Does anyone know if this is true?  
---
And the Fungo mod would increase your rate of fire, at the expense of distance.
---
Uranium fever. Loot/scrap all
---
Actually just hopped on for like an hour if you're on
---
The signs already contain my messages. I roleplay as a miner who lost their job but managed to get a spot in vault 76. Some of those signs have my writing. 
---
It's also fun to pretend that all the offices and houses I'm going through are those of my former employer.
---
"WE'RE NOT GONNA PROTEST!"
---
"GUTTER IS A TOOL!"
---
If you really need to jump to another server can't you just pick any player and mark them as block for session? Then just log out to the main screen and hit play to get sent to a server they are not on?
---
Sadly i'm playing on PC, not on PS4, but thanks for your help and useful info!
---
I have over 400 hours but I'm still there. It started as a place for low levels but there's a lot more serious players mixed in too.
---
That would be pretty cool, to be honest. It'd be nice to have a Corvega out front of your CAMP.
---
With the price increase on plans a few patches ago the current cap income is definitely insufficient. Especially for those of us who can't afford to play many days of the week. 
---
Thanks for info, I'll check it out!
---
That’s a shame to hear, it does suck when you get placed in a server with anyone who just wants to poach instead of help. As a 2 decade long Fallout player myself, I see some radical differences this game has made, not all of them for the better, but many make sense in a multiplayer environment. I do wish that with Survival mode around the corner, that they would introduce a ‘true pacifist mode’ of sorts; you can not be harmed by players and your paper bag can not be looted by any other player as long as you are in pacifist mode. I don’t always want to be stuck in even slap mode pvp. And I know this doesn’t address all your concerns with the game, but some plans have been made into set loot for vendors, making mantle plans more accessible, and there are more quests coming out in the near future, and I believe some of which are Overseer quests? 
---
im in the mountains not far from blackwater mine..near the stream
---
Thank you for useful info, i appreciate it!
---
No, that’s not how it works. We don’t have Institute clothing. No Minutemen gear. We have old clothes from before the war, that have survived 210 years in the Commonwealth. The armour survived. The clothing survived. The Silver Shroud costume you get in 4 is 210 years old. Most clothing in every Fallout is from before the war, because most people are more concerned about staying alive than having the newest pair of shoes.  
---
It's a new cola introduced with Fallout 4 Nuka-World. I don't recall the specifics but Nuka-World features a few colas that were region specific lore-wise. Not sure if grape should be in WV.
---
I've not seen Grape in 76, but it's surely in the game engine. Whether it can be acquired legitimately, I have no idea.
---
Oouu nice! You should post this on the settlement subs.
---
PC only, sorry. But huge thanks for the offer!
---
Please I've seen bases with more. The fusion generator takes up a ton of cost.
---
Sure you do, because what you describe is a real thing that totally happened.
---
You’re not fully invisible.  More like the predator - can still make you out if I’m looking.
---
YAASS
---
The real goal wasn't to get rid of all the dupes, since they cannot identify dupe vs non dupe, but to start getting rid of the massive player inventories.
---
Their first step was the hard limit of +1500 lbs above carry weight.
---
Second step was identifying players with large numbers of commonly duped weapons/armor.
---
They currently aren't done, as they said in the maintenance notes they were continuing to look at other item types.
---
That is epic.
---
Why the fuck didn't I do this.
---
Dammit.
---
This looks like a Megazord from the 1970s. Approved.
---
Lose the turrets. Pointless. Just place camp in a place away from baddie spawns. Turrets wont stop griefing from other players but you can just swap servers. 
---
You must have missed the times when camps duplicated none stop.
---
I had a base so big that it disconnected anyone (including myself) the moment it was rendered
---
Heavy rocket mod is for regular sledgehammers. All Rise is a super sledge, which already have the rocket on them by default.
---
True, but those players who lost their large numbers of items have just re-duped them and have them all back
---
Time to start a new character! 😉
---
Unmarked ranger gear is just prewar riot armor,so it SHOULD be all over the map considering the civil unrest from automation.
---

Video shows a drop location 
---
My assumption is that the census taker just spawned underground and you cannot fast travel to him because the z coordinate is negative.
---
Cool. Enjoy yourself.
---
But the ncr variant wouldnt be allowed with the all the ncr labels and such thats what people want mostly
---
"Only rank one damage perks are worth it"  
---
I think it depends on your build. Like I have 15 strength and when I run shotgun I have 2/3 in every shotgun damage perk. It leaves me 3 extra perk points to play with depending what I'm doing. I actually think it's good to have duplicates of your damage cards, so maybe you have 3/3 heavy gunner but then you have a 1/3 of the same type. Or you can mix/match 1/3, 1/3 and 2/3 or swap as needed. Definitely think that 3/3 isn't mandatory and just going 2/3, even on a single perk card, can you give you some quality of life improvements or make your game time more efficient than an extra 5% damage can.
---
Not being able to share them with the world!
---
It's funny you say it, because that's the plan for the weekend! :)
---
Woot, really looking forward to it now!
---
Batter up!
---
\*Is blown to bits\*
---
But Xbox tho
---
I'm of the opinion they should add costumes to the atomic shop of all the enemy types. 
---
Well if were goi g with old clothes from before the war theres a few outfits in 3 that arent anything special that could be added then. They could even just add them to the atoms shop. That way they arent physically in the game or part of the game just something you could buy if you wanted it.
---
Any chance you could link that?
---
Thank you for providing this info.
---
Ah!
---
Im at max capacity, and it would take a good 20 seconds for my camp to load in sometimes. I get why they need to have a limit, I just wish it was more
---
Because lots of games don’t have its main sub filled with trolls. The only reason I’m still subbed is because this is where Bethesda is the most vocal in feedback. I understand the squeaky wheel gets the grease, but this sub is often just nails on a chalkboard.
---
Except now there is a +1500 lb hard limit.  Meaning their duped inventories will be significantly smaller when they do start remaking them.
---
I don't think it will be long before we see more purges targeting different types of items.
---
Yeah I’ll add you and come to there station or hotel
---
Nice !
---
I need a TS lever action but need a hardened receiver. For it that it the plan for it so I can get all the mods for it 
---
I see the handmade plan all of the time at Harper's Ferry.... like 1700 caps.
---
Please Bethesda
---
Once again in video games they developers are legally allowed to do what they want when they want. If you do not like what they did, what they are doing or what they will do you stop playing. 
---
Apparently it's Bethesda's fault because *some reasons*.
---
Reasons they insert there can be: game being wonky / Bethesda not patching quickly = it's allowed / you don't own me and decide how i play / canvas bag / I only do it for my friend's small group of players / we wouldn't have given up if we couldn't cheat.
---
Basically they say it's absolutely fine to cheat and break ToS. If they get caught it obviously won't be their fault and they will post about incorrect ban waves.
---
The 1500 limit was already there, that's why they started adding them to mules. We definitely need a better fix
---
r/fo76*, the personal rancor reflected in your remarks I don't intend to dignify with comment. But I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies of the goddamn field or... hell! Take at look at* r/fo76filthycasuals *here as your paradigm of hope.* 
---
Don't you think they'd do that if they could or wanted to? Don't have to take your issues out on someone else lol.
---
I hadn't looked at it from a balancing point of view, especially in terms of pvp. Maybe that is Bethesda's current thought process and maybe this isn't a bug at all!? Certainly hope not!
---
So now we are complaining about complaining? Smh 
---
r/thatHappened?
---
Mutations have downsides? Imagine my shock
---
Yep. Several subs with varying degrees of legit-ness.
---
Lololol
---
I made my character look like some insane cannibal and I want a sign that says "eating and selling organs"
---
I am fucking idiot and I confused Ubisoft with Bethesda jesus christ I am sorry to all, but that pwned site was helpful to me, so thanks for this.
---
I like this a lot
---
Hah, Jokes on you. Can't leave now with all these up votes.
---
It's very difficult to find out in the wild. I think I've only found two, and I'm level 78. You're probably better off trying to craft one like others here have said.
---
I think we all know what a dumpster fire customized signs wood turn into, so I'm pretty doubtful on that one.
---
If the game crashes more frequently then there is an error in the game. A file was corrupt or became corrupted from all the crashes.
---
Have you tried uninstalling and redownloading the game?
---
I like this a lot :D
---
Decontamination shower and various PA mods like calibrated shocks and for torso.

Everytime I fast travel to Vault 76 and see a lvl 1 inside an angel gets its wings 
---
The irony of defenders of a massively multiplayer online game spinning off from the community of the massively multiplayer online game, because of other players of the massively multiplayer online game
---
Try the Fortnite out lmao, its a continuous log of complaints 
---
99% of the posts on here is "thank you to person who did X" or "PSA if i do X don't X" 
---
Sure! There's a few but I sub to r/fallout76settlements and r/falloutsettlements. Although the second one is mainly for FO4.
---
So you say that till I came across a base being slowly destroyed by a lone scorch.
---
where do you even get nuka grape? I have seen grape Mentats but not nuka grape
---
I said build in a place where baddies dont spawn.... Dont build near fissure sites or in the cranberry bog area.
---
Always at the rare vendor spawn.
---
I won't turn my brain off to be nice. Sorry
---
&gt; You take for granted that fairness matters, 
---
That is in fact very true. If not, why can't I just pull down a console and .add_item_superimbaweapon? If fairness wouldn't matter, this should be easily possible and there is no argument against it other than it would be unfair to other players. So if fairness doesn't matter, why am I not allowed to cheat, dupe and exploit my way through this game?
---
Maybe this is where our fairness bars are really off from each other.
---
I did it last night and me and three others died when the gutsy self destructed.... did not get anything worth keeping
---
I think each basic turret takes up 10% of your budget, so having 4 will almost half it. I try to stick to 1 or 2 at most just to alert me to enemies. 
---
Watch out bud or they'll DMCA you for reporting on their incompetence, fr
---
It would still be hilarious to see what people would make lol
---
I dunno,I'm looking at the new vegas wiki and it doesn't have any ncr labels,just a LAPD label on the chest and a covered up emblem that i can't make out.
---
Yeah sure, I’ll check it out. I’ve played almost daily since BETA, though not sure of how many hours in. It’s a very frustrating game, from both players and Bethesda. I’ll stick it out, though. It’s a WIP and I’m curious to see how it evolves. 
---
I had this, it went away when I exited the client not just the game. Quite annoying
---
Yes everybody should just be content with the state of the game and should not share their opinions in hopes that the developers improve the game.  /s 
---
Thats kinda the issue with the riot gear being ncr gear its not cannon bht it is cannon
---
Ghouls would be fine for immersion and gameplay. I imagine playing as a Super Mutant would ultimately be a massive inconvenience. They're taller than humans and whilst I've seen buildings accommodate them, I'm sure you'd be getting stuck on invisible walls regularly and clipping with terrain in unexpected ways. 
---
"AUTO-EROTIC FART INHALATION"
---
Bubbles always sells 1 nuka grape, she’s found on the second floor of the white springs resort just above the hall of merchants. 
---
Who leaps out?
---
Better yet I think the people in the recent players list shouldn’t disappear if you leave/ quit the game. It’d make it much easier to rejoin.
---
they werent going after regular players in the update, they were going after characters/mules carrying multiples of the same items, they went after the character holding 50+ x TSE 90% reduced weight handmades, not after the 10k+ players that already had a TSE 90% reduced weight handmade.\*  
---
\*(just using example numbers)   
---
then after they hit the ones with multiple copies of the same rare item they then looked deeply into the rest of the character/account for like 100k+ (again arbitrary numbers) nuka colas, (i dont know if they looked at bobbleheads, magazines and so on, notes only mentioned colas).
---
their idea was not to hit the "average joe" who may have unknowingly traded his hard earned caps for the epic weapon or armor. 
---
Left on D pad cycles to previous weapon back and forth which is a great feature, melee and rifle it helps a bunch. Weapon Wheel and anything with a scope when getting mobbed is going to lag out. 
---
It wasn't build in any of those locations. And there was just a random single scorch there destroying it. 
---
I'm somewhere in the middle actually. I accept there are issues, but equally, I enjoy it. 
---
Whilst I enjoy it I will continue to play it. I am not going to feel sorry for dupers though, I will hope that they loose duped items. At the end of the day, if someone else has to work for something and someone else gets it via an unethical method then that isn't good! If this was an offline game then whatever, people can do what they want. As soon as there is an online element there should be equality. 
---
Not an attack against anyone, just expressing my opinion.
---
They shouldn't take up that much given they are entirely defensive. 
---
No I paid $200.00 for a piece of shit. And anyone who paid $60 for just the game paid $60 dollars for a piece of shit. I am saying we were sold shit for real work money......money that they laughed their way all the way to the bank with. A aaa studio with millions of dollars of resources at their disposal. Just the success of Skyrim and FO4 alone should be enough revenue to hire the right people to make sure this game was a functional fucking product. There are a plethora of multi player online games out there. This is not a new thing. They are not breaking new ground here. Its been done enough that they could get the resources they need to make a quality product. But they knew that suckers like us would say "sweet, a new fallout game, take my money!" They seen a cash grab and they took it. If you think their limited staff they dedicated to these "bugs" are working around the clock with their unlimited resources to make this game good for us you are sadly mistaken. They have our money. There is no subscription here. They are putting as little effort as possible to make you think it will get better by "patching" bullshit while focusing on "new" content to try and get more suckers to fall for it. 
---
Fact is...We ALL got scammed HARD...
---
Here you go. Aside from the duper patch, which was well-received, more new content is coming. 
---

Well not accounting for random 76 glitches. You should be safe 
---
Lol for sure!  Just remember Dirt, not all of us lvl. 100+ strutters are griefers and looters.  Alot, and I do mean alot of higher level players are more than willing to help and actually go out of our way to help the 1 to 3 other blips on the map.
---
Yeah, No Man's Sky sub is a perfect example of a Sub that was great before release, turned crap after (because the game was crap) to finally return to a positive environment it is today after Hello Games made improvements. 
---
LOG. WALLS. 
---
Before settling into my current C.A.M.P. I jumped from cabin to cabin and marked down any buildable structures that I came across. 
---
While we're at it, can we get more stair options and some suspension bridges because I love treehouses too!!!
---
 We have a very good communication system in the game. My issue is that few of us use it.
---
 That seems to be unpopular which explains this thread. I don't know why and have not seen a good reason to turn off your mic. Its a multiplayer game.
---
 I have sat and shot the shit with griefers, they don't work all the time, and had many good conversations with a wide range of people from all over the world.
---
 You can hide, but you are missing a great part of the game. 
---
Whitesprings always has high level players at the vendors or it's constantly being nuked. Always high level mobs there 
---
Oof you clearly have some issues and projecting here. Good luck on your recovery
---
I don't get it. It's not a sub for hater,nor lover of the game? Who else should enter then? Casuals,by default,don't even come to reddit,sites,trivago.
---
What makes you think it isn't necessary?
---
Just don't buy anything, cosmetics are about as useless as colored toilet paper. Plus, people should be rewarding dev's for this kind of thievery. 
---
To piggyback on this, I want wallpaper. Even if it's the wallpaper from Whitespring.
---
Just Lucky.  RNG finally in your favor.
---
I sometimes jump to the roof of whitesprings and shoot at cars while cloaked.
---
No its certainly not a good thing, but punishing a large chunk what little playerbase is left for what less than 1% of players are doing, is even worse. The dupers suck for doing this, but ultimately the blame lies on the corporate side Bethesda for shipping out a half finished pile of crap. That should have been tested everyway from sunday before shipping because of how detrimental it was to balance. Yet here we are. At least 2 confirmed methods of duping discovered and the games only been out 3 months. This whole thing has been a shit show, and the people laughing about other suffering is only making it worse. The community used to be known for being pleasant and helpful. Now all i think of is "REEEEEE"
---
I am truly surprised that the server stayed up long enough to build that!
---
I suspect what is happening to what's also causing Deep Pocketed and other plans (largely armor mod plans) to show up at vendors, so hopefully by fixing it it will fix the other plans that are missing as well.
---
Nylon? 
---
LOL. I'd give up my base budget to see that. 
---
I agree. Their usefulness doesn't seem to warrant the insane cost. Especially since mine are pretty useless at actually killing enemies.
---
I would like to see more grit in the outfits. 
---
Strawman again. 
---
When I rock up to a queen fight, and the other 10 people there are rocking the butt of god cannon, the problem isn’t fairness that I don’t have what they do. 
---
(If they could get it via console and it doesn’t doesn’t count as a cheat, so can I, do the fairness is still there.)
---
The problem is that that impacts my gameplay, just as taking away their butt of god cannon would probably impact theirs. 
---
This isn’t your “what is just? What is fair?” Wank. You can keep having it with yourself, but honestly, Nobody cares. 
---
This is a “how to steer this into an enjoyable experience for all of them?” 
---
And that meant
---
1. Not taking people’s butt of god cannons away, because players form emotional bonds with their individual, unique items. 
---
2. Cull non unique duplicate items as they command no such emotional bonds. 
---
3. The guys with the butt of gods cannons are actually *not* on the intended road to how the game is to be consumed. The game is about the journey to find the butt of god, having it from the get-go is kind of like watching the last 3 minutes of a movie. So what they did is made these particular butts of god only fire god farts, and no longer fire solid god poop. 
---
4. Findlay, they ruthlessly banned the cheaters. 
---
5. ... but clearly indicated they’d be forgiving who owned up and promised to not engage in cheating any more. 
---
That’s how you manage the game experience. 
---
There’s no fair anywhere in there, other than fair treatment of real world people, who are paying customers, by minding their positive entertainment experience.
---
“I’M ANGRY FOR SOME REASON”

Lmao. Yeah let people have 1000000000000 turrets and break the game.

---
You're doing it wrong.  I have a massive steel house filled with decor, a lead extractor, and two industrial water purifiers.  My budget is close to being maxed, but I've still got a little room.  Your turrets can't even kill radroaches.  They are of no value, yet they destroy your budget.

changing the Fallout76Prefs file?

I could only imagine. I bet there's a ton of guys who are afraid to talk to women in real life who suddenly think they're ladies men online. Add in how people feel they can say anything behind the safety of their keyboard and I don't even want to know what that experience is like.
---
For sure! Didn’t mean to sound scornful or bitter, I love you guys, saved my ass a few times! Found myself at Whitesprings by accident a couple weeks back and, even though I had heard about it, I didn’t really know what it had in store. I picked a level 2 lock, found a level 47 Charred (I’m 27) and I kited it a bit while unloading my shotgun at it. Unknowingly found myself attracting a group of ghouls of all sorts. I was on the husk of a car I had blown up to kill a group and hoping my shotgun shell supply would hold up when a level 138 guy in XO-1 showed up with a shotgun of his own and mowed them down, saving my ass. 
---
I got disconnected twice while building this! Fortunately I had 3 team mates on at the time, so I was able to get back in. Kept playing throughout the night, got a couple more disconnects, but was always able to get it back, so I had it for a good 6 hours or so. It was a bit sad to log out at the end of the night, knowing that she was going goodbye forever!
---
Kind of reminds me of the Serenity from Firefly.

Carry weight is limited, was getting rid of what he deemed 'junk'
---
Lol awesome. 
---
But don’t other games like ark and rust allow for pretty huge or infinite amounts of building (correct me if I’m wrong here)?
---
I agree that this would seemingly break the server but a major thing I was envisioning with this game was players working together to make town sized settlements and the creative possibilities it would allow for. The system as it is now really limits the cooperative spirit they were selling us on imo 
---
I give out plans I have for free all the time. Trust me, you’ll get annoyed after while and want some plans you don’t have and can’t afford.
---
This happened for the following reasons:
---
* There is a weight limit on how much you can store
---
* There is a weight limit on how much you can carry (a reasonable limit and a hard limit)
---
* There is a limit to how much money you can get from vendors daily. 
---
* Unless you plan on trading with other players, there isn’t too much use for caps other than fast traveling, once you have all the major plans/mods you wanted
---
So, likely this player had a bunch of crap gear they couldn’t store and couldn’t sell, and rather than go with the other option of just letting it rot on the ground, thought they’d do something nice for someone by giving you some gear. 
---
Most likely the gear wasn’t going to make a long term difference to you anyways. 
---
Not really. That being your only means of communicating with someone doesn't make it true. 
---
Do you play the Online part? Don't you find the constant hunting and fishing and missions boring? The PvP system is good at least. Even though I don't like it when someone shoots me randomly, I get to hunt them down if they do and kill them over and over. Maybe they will think twice next time.
---
You should definitely quit a game like this at times, and come back when there's more content. A long term game like this sees a lot of stop-and-go accounts, it's no big deal. And if you never come back that's okay too because the game will be here anyway
---
Get an alt dweller.
---
I have one who I wanted to make a melee build off of, but then I just turned into my Camp practice.
---
Bye!
---
Hm, /r/fo76FilthyCasuals is the only sub that was made for the purpose of having a place to talk about the game without being pricks about it.
---
Later on you'll be doing the same. 😊
---
Please don't come and be trollish. I like my filthy casuals. If you're thick with the petulant negativity that makes people unsubscribe from this sub, please stay away and let us have our fun. 
---
Another player fighting the SBQ picked up this version through a drop after we decimated everything in the area.  At night or in darkness it’s really freaking cool green lightshow.  Only problem is it breaks after about 8 blasts lol 
---
Thanks for reminding me to unsubscribe 
---
And fact abiding too. Now you can go back to your dreamland where people can morph lol
---
Thanks.
---
This is all-around awesome but there are two things I love. One, you can *see* what she's going through by her facial expression as she ages. Especially between 1 and 5. Two, you even thought to put on an "aged" looking vault suit for the later shots. Very well done.
---
Damn you beat me to it
---
new achievement added, beat a ghoul to death with a 'save the zombies' sign
---
I honestly haven't even made it through the story yet I don't get to play often because I have a baby but so far the game has been awesome. I'll try online tonight tho
---
The context is the link you posted "proving" something you tooknoutnof context. Did you already forget what you said? This is worse than we thought
---
Fast Travel Mats in a CAMP could kill you if they were placed up high because you could fall to the ground before the CAMP objects loaded in and die. So they just... removed them instead of fixing it.
---
&gt;dumps on a sub I enjoy (and the posters at the same time), while poaching
---
So...what's the point of another subreddit about the same game, again?  Kinda seems like a solution without a problem.
---
Maybe it was an actual thought and they trashed it in fear of our backlash?
---
How do you do this, Are these all new characters or is there a way to edit looks after creation? r/whooosh me if you want
---
&gt; tooknoutnof
---
Try getting care for the stroke you're having. It explains all the stupid shit you've been saying, though.
---
It's fun for a while. But it's a big grind and it gets boring. But when you do get into one of those random battles it's a lot of fun.
---
Also this wasn't another one of those knock on Bethesda posts I love the game studio and have loved the fallout series since day one but just the endless grind kinda got old you know best believe as soon as some new content drops I'll be right back out in the wastes RDR2 is the side piece she just doesn't know it yet
---
I never said that? You can't even quote correctly lmao
---
Very happy that I am not the only one who thought of that reading this post.
---
Hijacking this to chime in that ultracite gatling lasers can not spawn as legendaries!! They might seem rare enough but green lasers need love too, they look awesome honestly
---
Had this happen also.
---
Nope, they're all bugged. None of them are dailies
---
i lol'd @ less class / more class.. ty
---
See my above comment
---
Thanks very much for the kind words! Though I can't take credit for the vault suit, that's just a trick of the light.
---
Oh I'm playing Spider-man, fallout 76 is done until they add more content.  I don't feel like a sucker.  I got what I paid for.
---
You edited it. The fact that you can't even admit that is pathetic.
---
Camp items dont transfer between characters do they?
---
Ahh, well it works :D
---
That is correct 
---
Brilliant, love this idea
---
I'm not angry about people having fun with the game, for sure that's a redicolous notion, I'm angry that people felt this is an acceptable game. I feel like we can all agree that it isn't but some people out there don't relise the importance of speaking out against it so that it Dosnt happen again, being angry with other people's happiness would be insane haha you are right though, maybe I came in bit hot with the shit sandwich quote, not a very good anarlergy. 
---
Nope sadly, but it doesn't waste your resources.
---
One way:
---
Place 2x1 foundations, then the stairs fence platform thing on top.  Build a steel beam on top of the fence platform at one end, then another on top of that.  Remove the bottom beam (top will float).  Build another stairs platform thing on top of the first one.  Now, remove the bottom fence platform and foundations.  The top platform will float!  Now you can build floor tiles off that.  However, you can never remove connected tiles. You'll have to move your camp and start over, so build with intent.
---
Yeah, it puts you up on top of the cliff near the tower. I get a random encounter everytime, just never a flatwoods monster. I think I'm just unlucky. Or maybe its level dependent or some other unknown factor. Or maybe a hundred or so times just wasn't enough. Lol.
---
Because when bugs are posted on filthycasuals, it’s not in the tone of “its been 4 months and X problem STILL hasn’t been fixed! I’m done with this game, I gave it a fair chance! UNINSTALLING!”
---
So what we just get like a random selection of ones we can complete each day?
---
Bet you duped back when everyone was doing it. You stopped, then got banned and now you're claiming you didn't dupe when you got banned. Buuut you had a bunch of duped items didn't you

Umm...
---
I feel you but maybe this person just doesn't have a mic. Could be a young person without a job. Who knows.
---
You'll find this game is (currently, at least) much friendlier than Rust. You'll be struggling against some high-level baddie when suddenly a hero in power armor will bound in swinging a super sledge like the fist of an angry god, clearing them out of your way. Then this benefactor might drop some loot on you. A blessing and a curse, really; the higher-level meanies were likely spawning because the dude in the size 100+ shoes was tromping around near you. But don't look a gift horse in the mouth. If you're fighting a bunch of ghouls and an upper-level player comes in, don't focus on one - tag as many as possible with a single shot. That way you'll get xp for every baddie you've tapped that your savior offs.
---
Sugar Grove is a decent place for screws and springs as well as robot enemy's! You should give that one a try 
---
I want to put my boi speeedwagon on there, and do a melee build
---
Good deal. Especially since nobody on my friends list currently has the game.
---
Sugar Grove &amp; Camp McClintock are great for both! Look for clipboards, fans &amp; globes.  And no, Robots don't drop screws.
---
I will take it like a champ. If It means I don't need to fall off a cliff everytime I fast travel.
---
rename/edit title and add "need xbox help" i know there are ways to do it, had seen several mention it in other posts but im ps4 and dont remember what was required.. 
---
You know why this is happening, right? the r/fallout subreddi is coming over here and ruining the game for us. Those of us who enjoyed the game and have been with the game since launch came to this subreddit and for the first week after launch, it was a really nice place with stories of people's findings and experiences. But no, r/fallout didn't like that at all. They started raging on people who tried saying in their subreddit the game was decent, and then started coming over here, without even buying the game, and started ruining things.
---
I mean I could tell you but that would be biased...
---
They should have just disabled in game trading months ago. Go to the markets and every other post is someone wanting a Bloodied Explosive and a full set of Assassin's/Unyielding Sentinel/Cavalier armor.
---
The orders all seem to get filled and every day that goes by the game gets more and more unbalanced for casual players who don't want to bother trading for duped gear.
---
I’m 200% serious, I’ve met 10+ new friends, not friend list fillers, buddies that I’ve had great times with since I’ve started playing, funny thing is none of my real life friends play the game either!
---
I'm only level 19, know another good place?
---
I don't like COD either, another cash grab for sheep.
---
Like I said, a sucker is born everyday, keep paying for unfinished stuff ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯, at least you got a nylon bag, lol
---
No doubt, I still haven't been given a reason not to trust them 
---
Will there be any updates to bring more after the end game?
---
Trading makes no difference, the super drop the item on the floor and the buyer takes it
---
But fucking?
---
No idea it was a little while back it was somewhere random as hell though that much I do remember.

Yao Gaui are good for springs.  Wendigo are good for screws, as can be higher-level super mutants. A run through the newspaper building and capital building in Charelston can net several typewriters. Also, the Vault-Tec agricultural center (plus the sheds right across from it) are a good source of screws. 
---
You're collecting those too?
---
Power armor backpack 
---
Seems to be. Maybe it’ll fix in a patch but atm it’s just plain broken like so much of this game.
---
look for "handmade gun" thats the recipe you are wanting.. there is a town north west of harpers ferry (sorry cant remember name) that has i think a beauty parlor and on the roof of the parlor in a shack on the 3 shelf metal shelf thing one sits (unless someones already picked it up)

I'd really like to have two CAMPs, even if one had a smaller budget than the other.  Either that, or be able to save a blueprint of my current CAMP that can be easily replaced without having to fiddle with manually replacing it.

In some cultures its rude to not accept a gift. So bounce away, but at one time you might have had to hunt for weeks or months for something that person dropped. You never know what rare item they might have given you. Now you can probably just buy them all from a vendor. It would be a different story if they were beating on you and killed you wouldn't it?

I think placed a camp near abbey’s and just started

1. Traveling home through there each time
---
2. Before I logged off each day, I travelled there and rapidly joined the world of every online friend or former trade partner (typically 5-6). 
---
That resulted in about 10-20 forced random encounters per day. 
---
And eventually, my number came up :)

Once you collect any piece of junk that contains them, go to the component view in the junk tab of the pipboy and tag them for search. 
---
Go loot any big building and when you hover over junk a magnifying glass will appear indicating it contains those components. Should have them in no time 
---
Troll where?
---
Atom shop ones do, learnt plans don't.

That sir.. is a killer idea lol

more or less, yeah, sadly. but, hey, maybe the new events they're gonna release will work properly, then we can forget about the broken ones.

I know you can get a decent amount of springs from camp Mcclinktok by collecting all the clipboards. Other than that I know yao guais drop springs when you kill them. I hope this helps, Good luck man :)

I heard someone else knowledgeable tell me a couple days ago it was vats but I didn't dig into the details.  This explains what I've been seeing this whole time.  It's pretty ridiculous.
---
Whelp! Still no luck, tried a few times tonight.
---
Loaded up Fallout 4, all Ultra, with 4K texture mods, enhanced lighting and dynamic shadows and more. ( over 50+ mods; mostly graphics and animations )
---
Been gaming smoothly at 99fps at 3440x1440.
---
Damn shame Fallout 76 just won't let me play it. Before their last patch, I could go well over an hour without an issue. Something just isn't playing ball.
---
Charleston offices - typewriters.
---
Different game, I know, but I completely changed my character when I found an equip-able spoon in Skyrim
---
Honestly I'd settle for some weapon skins.. combat shotgun from fallout 1.. wattz 2000 for my laser rifle etc 
---
They removed my 500k regular nuka colas, but left my quantums untouched.
---
The update should be next week
---
i sent u a chat message
---
There was no client side update it was all server based 
---
You can't drop caps to pay for it so that wouldn't work.
---
Gather them and save them during other nukes like Whitesprings before getting the flux!
---
Ahh perfect, thanks! I’d heard there was an update but haven’t been on the sub much so wasn’t aware!
---
Lol, of course they will^^ 
---
Gotcha, thanks!
---
It is always the people in weird outfits that turn out to be the coolest people. Sorry to hear about your employment struggles. 
---
I would love to have some more choices in game.. let me jump into the fev vats at westek please lol
---
And Ultracite ammo for 5.56, 5mm and .50cal :(
---
They mostly are, just look at g2g.com
---
Update: I just found bos chest plan at NAR, near Watoga
---
It's not a large update.  But, it should bring the stash limit increase.
---
Charleston Landfill 3 junk extractors. Gorge Junkyard 1 junk extractor. Tyler County Dirt Track 1 junk extractor. There are others but these are within a relatively shot distance of each other and are easy to defend. Just fast travel around them for free from time to time and empty the extractors. Also build your CAMP in a place with a a junk node. Your stash will slowly but surely fill up with all sorts of junk as you collect from it every time you are there.
---
Update: I just found the bos chest plan at NAR, near watoga 
---
If I edited it, it would have a stat next to it showing that. First time here?
---
SPOILER!
---
Hey, the Overseer is still alive, too. You just never get to meet her, because, uh, uhhhh....
---
Nah, I bought the half priced "we fucked up" edition, I think I'm in $40.
---
Not sure what you're playing, but from the sounds of things its superior to everything else.
---
Have fun out there, hopefully no one shows up to just shit on what you enjoy!
---
Are there females super mutants?
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/4U5kt2uvsdoSfii4prwboN/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-february-14-2019
---
Found the link.
---
No, that's only after five minutes. You really that desperate to lie about your edit?
---
Awesome. 
---
Been through a couple of layoffs, and jumped ship from another company when the company really tanked about 10 years ago. ... Horrible experiences, but good can come of it. ... Just sent you a DM. 
---
Thx
---
But...how would you kill things to level up? Wouldn’t that get kinda difficult with 0 combat perks? Maybe not, idk never tried it
---
Very cool. Here's to hoping that we can eventually build those creepy skull altars at our camps!
---
I'm doing other things, not servicing you lmao. Keep thinking I'm lying sure. 
---
http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/finding-therapy
---
Insinuating that I didn't know about the reference... What is this, the Spanish Inquisition?
---
I'm at that stage in the quests, but have been trying to find some kind of alternate launch plan instead of white springs or watoga. 
---
Also can't to it right now. 
---
Let's connect though. 
---
Wow, I predicted your exact response.
---
Vaults, and a *probably* shitty pvp mode
---
Why not be kind to a new player?  Just some player trying to give an assist is all.
---
Origins is sooooo good its my favorite AC by far haven't tryed Odyssey yet but I've heard good things 
---
Saying you predicted it without actually posting what I would say? I dont even know where you are going with this anymore lol get some help dude this is sad
---
"PRES. EDEN DID NOTHING WRONG"
---
Why don’t we just have robot power armor?
---
That makes me excited about playing. 
---
Reread my comment before that. I did say it.
---
In fact, forget the vendor!
---
So letting some people have butt of god cannons is creating an enjoyable expierience for me how exactly?
---
I’m assuming you had some drinks as well? 
---
Haha just messing with you but glad you found some good people in the game!
---
You expect us to believe you knew word for word? Why am I wasting time with this troll. This isnt even about fallout anymore. It's about this guys mental cry for help 
---
Oh blah, yeah Thank's code, I was trying to be nice here but failed at phrasing. 
---
subtext reiteration of my last post: Why do you think bethesda's settings require so much fiddling? 
---
Yesssssssss thank you!
---
I did. It's right there for you to see. And as we all know...  
---
&gt;If I edited it, it would have a stat next to it showing that. First time here?
---
That’s awesome, sorry I read your last post wrong! If you’re on Xbox I hope we run into each other!
---
Yeah, that's a good point. It might be a good event itself but with nearly zero rewards. I'd like to see the drop table expanded to include things from workshop defenses, etc.
---
You on ps4?
---
So you admit this is your cry for help? Oh thank god we made progress! Lol I'm done fucking with ya. Good luck with your crusade and god speed on those sessions
---
On Xbox
---
GT is SRH KINGSPADE
---
I could see the argument for not raising it at all, I mean then they’d have to raise the prices on plans even higher or you’d get everything within the first two weeks or so.
---
Maybe a perk card set that doesn’t show up until higher levels that you can increase cap amounts with? Like how in previous games you had to burn a perk or two to get vendor cap stashes up anyways?
---
I'm from vancouver myself, living here is so expensive. Maybe OP has a certain situation man. Never know, or maybe they just prefer to not talk. 
---
Hell yeah my man, I’ll be on this weekend/tonight I’ll shoot you an invite
---
Nah surprisingly enough. Ive had a 12 pack in my fridge unopened for about 8 months now. Lol drank my face off in highschool..you know drink all the drinks and not have a hangover ever..well around 25 that changed. It's not worth the 3 days of death for a few hours of spilling beer on my lap lol
---
Nah, Xbox. 
---
You're just back to deflecting with petty bullshit.
---
Pacifist mode DOES NOT mean people can't hit you. it means you can't hit them. It's not cheating if you are wanted/engage pvp. and if you play with workshops, you are playing pvp.
---
I've been doing a lot of helping lately. People get scared when I roll up at level 160+ in my power armor so I always make sure to take it off for a moment so they can see it's really the Silver Shroud under there ;)
---
Glad you had this experience, I only hope my small helpful interactions make someone's day the way they made yours.
---
Radworms gave me a weird carry weight boost, that disappeared when the disease ran its course.
---
Haha sure bud.
---
Anyone know how the guy put bottle bottle caps in a drawer?
---
Damn.  Hope everything starts looking up for you. 
---
There is a nuka cola vendor in the upper floor in white springs.
---
I feel ya man I’m upper 20s and living the same as you. My fridge is constantly stocked with other peoples beer they leave here cause they know it’s safe ha
---
I guess I can forget about farming for my leather coat
---
Right now I'm playing RE2 Remake on PC and Kingdom Hearts III on my PS4.
---
But yeah... I doubt people would shit on stuff I enjoy as I don't make a habit of buying rushed trash which who was obviously made to cash on sheep
---
Yea that's the absolute best part. I didn't say anything at all about being down in the dumps..he was just a genuinely good dude. This community is the best I e ever played with.  Aside from one or two guys takin my workshop early on ..nothing but good vibes in this game.
---
Appreciate that bud. Always silver linings in everything.
---
If you also had a missile turret on the roof and a couple of heavy machine gun turrets on PC, I grabbed that one the other day! It was super helpful. I repaired it and got off once I got the challenge so someone else could grab it.
---
"IT'S NOT A GLITCH, IT'S A FEATURE!"
---
Yeah, it works. It's very strong, but you kind of run into "too many perks, too few slots" in STR on a melee build. My general opinion is that if you're running max HP melee builds, you want Martial Artist, but if you're a bloodied/unyielding melee builds then you want Barbarian more with maybe 1 rank of Martial Artist.
---
If you go there alone and are low level like me when I went for the sword, lure all the ghuls to the parking lot stand jump on a car, wait and then shot the car. After a respawn you should be able to clean up the rest.
---
Yup..28. also have three kids. So waking up at 630 to a five star frog splash on your hangover head by a 45 pound banshee just ain't it
---
But that's just it no matter what game you play they will drag it out for over a month no matter how much you play. 
---
When I played GTA online, I played a stupid amount and it took me a week of solid grinding to get a car a single-car.  That was playing the game shortly after launch almost every waking hour.
---
If they implemented this system of yours for vendor purchases, then you would see the prices of everything you would want to aquire skyrocket to astronomical levels just like they were in GTA   You'd still be forced to grind for month... except now you'd be forced to clear out entire areas over and over and people would be server hopping to clear out the good areas.  Thanks but I'll pass on that.
---
Pretty sure your build budget is based on the level you dropped it down at.  I last droppedine at level 172 and built a small house, garage, 2 resource generators and a missle turret.  Everything is decorated and I'm a full budget.  I'm pretty content with what I got.  You also need to be more creative with what you place, different items take up space differently.  Also, lose a few turrets.
---
No. That last scan took 4-5 hours.
---
Guess she needed a lot of Adictol, cause that face...
---
In the beginning I had my guy real young so I could take pictures making it look like it was his pre-war days and then aged him 25 years to go with the current time I love the free recreation ability 
---
This one wasn't mine, I had no missile turret up, but something similar happened to me (being I was the one that left it), it's actually pretty cool that stuff remains for a while for another person to take over.  Love this game.
---
Thats a permanent new feature.
---
WHY ARE SCREWS SO HARD TO FIND
---
Not sure about that but the subbreddit has blown up alot. So worth checking out if you haven't already
---
Ok. Gotta hop off now.  We can sync up tomorrow 
---
It'd be a good addition to the Scorched Earth event. 
---
He didn't, they were probably already in the drawer. Only way to give caps I know of is to give full Nuka colas.
---
Still having this problem. 
---
Yes. You can accept caps.   
---
\*\*However\*\* you won't get those caps back off the mule because you need to trade something for the caps. And when you're overweight, you can't even accept a zero-weight item. So you need to flush the mule to get your caps out. 
---
Tremendous!! How many years (according to your 'Jill-lore') has she been out of the vault ?
---
If you need 45 ammo I’ll be on tonight around 10ish . I have I believe around 1400 rounds yours if you want no charge. Gt PURE K OS
---
Howl's moving castle
---
This suggestion is so useless! I love it!
---
Maybe around 30? I imagine she left in her 30s and is somewhere in her 60s.
---
CHRCTLMT2SM
---
Wouldn't it be nice if some events 
---
awarded plans you haven't yet earned?
---
And wouldn't it be nice to get schematics
---
for all the things you'd like to build?
---
You know it's gonna keep getting better
---
now that dupers are gone forever 
---
Wouldn't it be nice if we could make stuff
---
in our CAMPS and make them looklike new?
---
And after having spent the day building
---
maybe do a defense event or two?
---
Well isn't this just an itch they're scratching 
---
maybe this will just improve with patching!
---
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?
---
Please explain how what other people **have** get in the way of your experience. 
---
Your parents did a really shit job of educating you not to look into other people's plate.
---
Appreciate that. I'm usually on between 10-12. I'll look ya up.
---
Sigh. Nearly all duped items are quite happyly ingame. Bethesda only hit warehouse characters.
---
Yeah but for every one person you're claiming plays without an issue, there are 10 who attempt to play with tons of issues.
---
 That is the most probable explanation for this. Still even if just your ears are on I can communicate.
---
 I had some fool shot at me the other day when a Diseased Radstag jumped me near their CAMP and I pulled out a Sword. I told them to stop shooting at me or I would fuck up their CAMP. They did, so I just toured it aggressively. ;). 
---
The absence of duped items in world lists has changed the drop rates for rare items. The number of legendaries on active players was inflated, making the game reward less rare items due to a perceived flood. 
---
Dupers ruin everything basically 
---
Sweet glory! Well done.
---
I was helping out a random lvl 6 one night to kill time and joined his team to help walk him through some of the early quests, after one or two fast travels to different locations he became totally invisible to me, it was really strange.  I could see him on the map, but 100% invisible to me in game play.  I still helped him for a couple hours but it was irritating for sure.
---
My favorite from Ghibli.
---
I may start planning out some mutated version of that.
---
If only we had more space.
---
You can also get a handmade gun (and the plans) from the One Violent Night event 
---
Watoga train station always has it
---
oh, i like new games.  
---
i beat re 2 before it got hauled out,dusted off and made shiny for people to buy a second time.  but you do you boo.  
---
and i e never tried a childrens game so i cant speak to KH3.   
---
but if thats your level, thats your level.  
---
keep at er bud, youll shit on everyone one day.  
---
Well, that’s nice - I didn’t bother to look it over. Maybe  it was necessary, though - your entire post was quite irrelevant, and you used it as justification to want to fuck over other players while likely making a bunch of them quit. Then you got defensive and started whining about language instead of acknowledging your own irrelevance. 
---
You might as well write a psa to everyone letting them know they can’t sue Bethesda for changing things when they update the game. 
---
You know, for all the imbeciles out there who might be confused. 
---
Good thing Bethesda was more intelligent than you and didn’t delete the items, though. It would have been unfortunate to see them fall to *that* level of idiocy. 
---
No problem 
---
Don’t forget Robobrain!
---
So you're implying my assumption is correct that if I sale an item on my mule character I won't receive the caps I sale it for, right? I ask bc the other commentor says otherwise. Just seeking clarification. Have you tried this?
---
Didn't take it as scornful or bitter, just trying to add so someone else reading might realize.  So many low levels are leery of higher level players because of the "ruin everyone elses time" players.  I remember when I was lvl.10, 20 and saw the Lvl. 70's bounce by without a care in the world.  I hate to say it, but I love to find people up a pole so to speak and be able to help them down.  Usually get a thumbs up or a heart.  Makes my day.  Enjoy your wanderings! 
---
I'm not sure if it was said but the multiple loading screens were gone last night when I logged on. The game play felt  smooth and creamy :)
---
https://youtu.be/Pq5_RZ1LBho
---
okay what about this one where I am just chilling in my camp and a couple of people come by to attack me and kill me for no reason?????
---
Last night I was busy building my camp at a new location.  Halfway through I noticed I was the only one on the map.
---
It’s not a glitch he‘s talking about. I had a glitched camp budget and around 20 turrets, still a single fucking mole rat was able to bite itself through my 4 layers of defensive walls.
---
I'm so glad Bethesda that you have PVP so someone can come and destroy my entire camp and killed me when I did nothing wrong and I can't do anything back to them. Thanks!
---
Hey it’s Darcy .....
---
Don't worry about, I also finished every other RE game as well back when it was released on ps1.
---
So Kingdom Hearts III is a children game, but Spider Man is not... I guess logic is not your strong suit is it ? lol
---
Anyway, you shit on sheep because they're stupid.
---
Interesting. I swear that error code is code for "we don't know or care to know"
---
It’s almost like they were a bunch of raiders in a post-apocalyptic world! If you want to build in peace, play mine craft. Not trying to be overly facetious, but that’s the name of the game dude.
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is VATS now.  I played maybe 15 minutes without VATS and my core barely depleted.  I used VATS 2-3 times and I saw a noticeable drop.  Then, I went to an area with no targets whatsoever.  I kept hitting Q and I would watch my AP meter move as well as the core meter drop.
---
I'mma follow suit like NOW! Thank you for educating my non tech savvy ass
---
Might be able to make a sleeping dragon.  Head on the ground, mouth is the door with flame thrower traps. 
---
NP, Looking forward to seeing your wasteland adventures!
---
IIRC if you try to make a post with a link to that page, reddit doesnt preview it correctly If you dont set the flair to image, it defaults to video for some reason
---
&gt; This is a “how to steer this into an enjoyable experience for all of them?”
---
First an foremost: Fuck you.
---
You wanna talk parenting you little cunt? I feel bad about your children man. If you raise them with the values and the style you presented yourself here someone should really call child services to prevent the worst. You are a shitty selfish uneducated egoistic human piece of shit and I hope to god that your children do not end up like you. You little motherfucker fail to tag along any line of argument, any line of thought, any reasonable discussion for the whole time we've been talking. I wonder did you even make it through school or did you just say "fuck it"? 
---
I presented countless points and you were not even abled to suffistically counter argue any single one of them, still you try to claim that what you think matters, because it is your shitty little opinion? Get a fucking hold of yourself man, reflect a little maybe it helps you get around in life better, holy fuck. I really tried to keep it civil but man you are just being retarded at this point and it honestly is just getting annoying seeing you fail again and again to have a simple logical coherent conversation or even train of thought. 
---
Now bringing my parents into this, just seriously - fuck you. I hope your wife loses her cheated item to some bug and quits the game.
---
You said 
---
&gt;This is a “how to steer this into an enjoyable experience for all of them?”
---
For ALL of them, that is why I asked how it creates one for me fuckhead. Don't ask a counterquestion when all I did was just questioning your petty ramblings that you present here as your opinion.
---
And lastly again: Fuck you
---
Trump is duping Logan Paul, you're welcome. 
---
That's just shitty defense layout. And sounds like a glitch 2 me
---
Time to hit the ol' Benjamin button...button. 
---
That's why just stick with the excavator armor. 
---
Just switch server before they destroy your whole base.
---
Play something else?
---
Yeah, I thought about a second camp, but I figured thats asking for too much.
---
There is a zero percent chance my camp would place itself if I blueprinted it. There are so many things I had to 
---
Google foundation stacking there are a few good videos out there. You gotta do it just right but once you get the formula it’s easy. 
---
That's the biggest Porygon I've ever seen...
---
Yes, you could do something to stop them, log off before they could destroy it and jump servers.
---
Bug fixes first please.
---
Many worlds, leave world, join new world. Be happy, trust no one
---
I’m on Xbox as well, if you ever need help with anything hit me up. GT is Xwolfpackleader 
---
I am yes correct. And no but I know a trader who recently ran into this problem and made a 10k deal got no caps as he was over the weight threshold. But Idk I could be wrong or he was I just play it safe friend.
---
Server hop.  It sucks but you don't give the asshats the satisfaction 
---
I just noticed that y’all tried the same test as well.  Hopefully, some adjustments are made. 
---
Since I had a shitload of them, I didn’t really have a „defense layout“. They were pointed in every direction possible, every spot in my camp was covered and still more than once enemies spawned in my camp and the turrets didn’t give a fuck. 
---
For some places, like the ones in Harper's Ferry and the Bed and Breakfast, you can use the key if the door is locked in that server! Just ones I've already confirmed I am sure there are more
---
ROTFLMFAO. We have fissures, but the reason is far more terrifying than earthquakes. ;)
---
This is awesome. I love the dedication. Gaurenteed I wouldn't have even remember to take photos at certain levels
---
What an awful response to griefing lol
---
Lol what else can you really say at this pt?
---
lol people would make signs that read stuff like "THIS GAME EATS A BOWL OF DICKS"
---
Outside Charleston Station? I hope no one targets your camp because they wanted to farm the vendor spawn. 
---
Yes you could....
---
1) Where are your rocket turrets? Where are your defenses?
---
2) Why arent you attacking them? Most of them are wanted. Go away, sneak in and take out one by one.
---
3) If you are so weak, just server hop and problem solved.
---
4) Even if they destroy your camp, their bounty is more valuable than the junks you are going to spend on repairing your CAMP. 
---
F#ck this is beautiful. I'd wish this would happen more often. I am never so lucky to get attacked by anyone. 
---
Watoga bots
---
Yeah but it's not just that. Just "stopping playing" is only one very small part of the impact. They can do whatever the hell they want, but obviously there will be consequences. We are customers. We give them money for a product. If we stop giving them money for the products they produce they will go bankrupt. Now we have positive hype. Fan hype. Etc. Good word of mouth. Then we have bad word of mouth. YouTube critics with audiences of up to millions. Commentators on media sites and message boards all over the internet. If you piss off the people you rely on for your business, then things are going to go very bad for your profits. You create this narrative as if they are all powerful. They can do whatever they want. But actually they can't, and if they do it will have a negative effect on them. They provide a service. And that relies on their reputation and our good will and trust as consumers. Some companies stock has already felt the impact of their greed and poor decisions. Some are still feeling it, as their most profitable IPs sell less and less copies every iteration. Of course there is a dynamic with new customers, and people not in the know, who don't care, but they can be rallied fairly easily with the right catalyst. So big companies should be wary of not giving the disgruntled even more reasons to see them as adversarial, rather than a mutually beneficial relationship of producer and consumer, where quality, value and trust are paramount.
---
Nothing stops another player from destroying your CAMP. That is an intended game mechanic
---
I can make you one (pc).
---
By this logic the caps have to be going somewhere, meaning there must be a fat vault of caps hidden somewhere in Appalachia. *\*sniff\*sniff\** Do you smell DLC?
---
What the point of doing them? Do they give you some unique rewards? 
---
oh i shit on anyone who lives on a self built pedestal.  
---
Bloodied melee only requires 9 points in Strength—martial artist 3, incisor 3, blocker 3.   
---
Once you add unyielding armor, adrenal reaction, nerd rage and a bloodied weapon you’ll do more than enough damage.  
---
I know that they have a small chance to give you unique apparel 
---
What do you have to do to get that?
---
Nothing but this post is really to draw attention to the devs that griefing on this level is possible and isn't fun. Not exactly for the reddit users. Bases should definitely be able to be damaged and destroyed but griefing shouldn't be as much of a possibility as it is now
---
I think the 'casual' part is less about how often or hard you play the game, and more about your social attitude toward the game, devs, and other players. Think of it as more like chill casual vs. arrogant elitist! 
---
You can also use a terminal connected to the door on the inside to open the powered door. Just turn all switches on using the terminal. You can lock the door as you are leaving by entering the code in the door outside. 
---
Ground Zero was the last trophy I needed.
---
i can guarantee it considering the racist bullshit i hear on the mic half the time
---
I haven't checked since they wiped duped inventories, but I don't see why it would change. It did shut me down as a trader for a few days, but I leveled a few mules up with max weight reduction perks, strength, agility, and weight reduction armor. 
---
You have to get all the trophies available in the game.
---
Join in and destroy your own camp. Dont give them the satisfaction. Being upset is exactly what they want.
---
If after all that has happened, you still haven't lost faith in Bethesda, then may I say you have some pretty questionable analytical skills and terrible judgment. 
---
If you had one speck of brainpower, you would realize that there is always at least a single truth or reason behind interactions. If people complain, then there definitely is something to complain about. If people like the game, then there definitely is something to like about the game. If the majority of people are complaining, then there is more to complain about in this game than to enjoy. You might say that the people on this reddit only represent a minority of players and so, such judgments are invalid. Saying that however means that you cannot judge the game at all since everything that happens on these social platforms is only made by a subset of players.
---
Bethesda deserves nothing but criticism for everything they have done. They had countless chances to right their wrongs and they messed it up every single time. If you've also played the game for quite a while and played other games in the same genre, you'd (hopefully) notice that it ranks in the bottom of the stack. You loving the game has nothing to do with objective analysis and comparisons to other games. Get your "love the game" nonsense outta here.
---
Myah!
---
The drill and ripper are also level locked to 20 and 40. The drill can't be legendary. It'd be nice to get 3* wood armor, but some 1* sets are pretty powerful given the shrouded mod. 
---
Strongly agree. Although I've got to let you know that Tesla rifles are currently fantastic, and definitely exist. I've got a Furious Tesla rifle that is seriously effective against groups, for tagging enemies to get loot, and the durability is excellent. I've killed hundreds, fired a thousand fusion cells and only repaired it _once_. I can only imagine how great it would be with some good legendary effects. I actually expect them to be "fixed" negatively due to their sheer quality. 
---
Plasma guns are available although rare and pretty weak. Haven't been able to get a Sniper Barrel mod to boost the damage (if it's even the same as it was in FO4) but it really needs that. As do laser weapons. I'm keeping my Anti-Armour Plasma rifle in my stash for when it gets a much-needed boost.
---
Don't laser rifles benefit from Rifleman perks and laser pistols benefit from Gunslinger perks? Durability is still weak on them, and power definitely lacking. 
---
Im close to all trophys
---
\[PS4\]  The events I complete are not tracked under the data/events in pipboy.  I only show that I did the "Tea Time."  Please fix. 
---
My power armor's reactive plates mod caused something like that and I was in passive mode.
---
  It didn't trigger pvp right away but it took their health until they died and made me wanted. Two guys almost cleaned me out before I could get away.
---
I did the same thing!  Every ten levels.  You did a much better job than me.
---
In the last session I was playing there was a 3-4 second delay for melee damage that I was inflicting on monsters to register and another several minutes for loot to appear on corpses.  Disconnected from server after 25ish minutes.
---
Pass. It's the only thing that makes money worth anything.
---
Mine has a constant broken nose. I feel like my nose would be smashed in minutes, just from tripping out of the vault. 
---
These are great!!
---
She looks like she could tell you a whole lot of stories, love the lvl 20 pic.
---
That’s what I like to see and what I wanna do. If I get to a point where things get too easy or beat SBQ before more endgame, that’s gonna be what I do. Follow the lowest level on the map and keep them safe.
---
Duplicated. Many online games may have quirks that allow people to duplicate items.
---
I think the issue with this is the same reason there is no in-game chat. 
---
There is no filter for naughty words, like racist slurs ect. 
---
I would like to see it though, be a neat way to tell new players you mean them no harm. 
---
That sounds unsubtantiated af
---
Feel free to try, I mean one of use payed for a half finished game which was solely made to cash in on sheep....
---
Yeah I just don't understand the level locking, just seems like another bug. I'd be down for legendary drills especially as they are actually in the legendary drop pool anyway (TY SBQ)... Haha I thought only I used the shrouded mod! It does lack in resistances though, and I am a big fan of the weight reduction effect in legendary armours which I just can't get with wood.  
---
I have thought of another weapon though, would love some legendary Enclave Plasma Guns. 
---
Why does it need to diminish? Why can't they just have the caps I use to buy something to buy things back from me? We are already taking a diminishing returns when the item is worth 60 caps and even with the hard bargain maxed u don't get what it's worth.
---
There's Sentinel and Cavalier armour in this game? I've got almost full sets of the Mutant Slayers, Troubleshooters, etc, types of armour and haven't ever even _seen_ a Sentinel or Cavalier piece. Ohhh, is it a two or three star effect?
---
Couldn’t you just take over a workshop and build there? You’d get some free materials to build with too
---
&gt;MIA 
---
what is MIA?
---
Congrats
---
That used to happen to me and it is annoying but I think it's just visual. It never affected my weight bonus 
---
Smart. You can be my friend.

---
They ran a script on a database that made it so inventory entries in the high thousands would be rewrote to 1 to fix a problem that should never have existed in the first place 😑
---
I get you on the shrouded resistances, but if you have 30+ agility from a full set of shrouded wood armor, you really don't need any resistances. Stealth is your security. It would be nice, but I wonder if this is intended
---
The level of detail on this is so cool! How long did it take for you to make each edit on each level up?
---
It’s like the meth addict progression pics you see online. Awesome idea man. 
---
Now that you mention it.....
---
It's all I see... lol
---
I do it to have a cool background for pics, im roleplaying as Michael Bay
---
Please show me a single post of actual hate in r/fo76. All I see are suggestions, people getting tired of the game, silly encounters and very rarely actual pure hate. If you think that's hate then you weren't here on launch.
---
There are no good factions. There were many tribes of raiders prior to reclaimation day, and they didnt get along with each other. The liberators fight the Protectronbots who were there to help humans but were reprogrammed and killed citizens in Watoga. The BOS raided the responders. The responders took people in but didnt have the training to survive in post nuclear war.  The scorched and ghouls fight each other. The vendors are stingy capitalists. The supermutants claim appalachia belongs to them and fight with grahm. The only two things that are friends are the Grafton Monster and the mayor of Grafton, yet were tasked with killing the monster...
---
Oh god, imagine a dude in full raider getup charging at you wielding a blood-stained sign that says "WE COME IN PEACE"
---
Actually they are capable of killing a lot if you get them in good positions.  But if attacking your base is something that happens you shouldn't have such a budget removed for trying to defend your location. 
---
Guess im a cave man lol i have no class 
---
There are 2 plans, hat and costume. I think there has been a bug with it where the hat doesn't show up in the crafting even though you know it. I think you need to have both to make a complete costume, could be wrong cuz I know both but the hat never has showed in the crafing menu.
---
Missing In Action. 
---
Thanks! If you have a link to a gallery I'd love to see the pics!
---
Check the headwear on the armor crafting station.  I thought that when i tried crafting my silver shroud costume. 
---
No everyone paid $60 maximum for the game. If you think the game is bad then what ever. The remaining 140 dollars was for all the collectors stuff given like the PA helmet.  No one paid 200 dollars for just the game. 
---
God dammit-- you- youre one smart feller, ya know that!?
---
Im gonna have to keep an eye on you. 
---
Used to do this in older fallout games. It’s super fun!
---
Yes there will be consequences and they deal with that every single time they make a choice. 
---
Achievements on Xbox 360 ruined my experience with a lot of games. On PS4 now I don't really pay much attention to them. But maybe at some time I might look and see if I need to get one or two and try for them. But I'll never let it become the main focus or something I need to do.
---
If you have time and are interested enough there are some good lore videos on YouTube. The creatures are cool but the vaults had some crazy shenanigans going on 
---
Some weapons also seem to be exempt from certain effects. I’m not talking Missile launchers not having the explosive effect...
---
Railway rifles. Anyone ever seen a two shot, double/quad, explosive, or even a 10% damage while aiming? If so please show me because I never have. 
---
Double/quad grenade launchers, fat man, missile launchers? Never seen one of these either. Maybe they’re out there somewhere but odds are someone would’ve traded one by now.
---
Thanks! Maybe 5 to 10 minutes? I'd had 10 levels of thinking about what I'd do next, so the actual adjustments were just things like sliding down the intensity on scars or changing hair color/style, which doesn't take that long.
---
"GIF OR GIF"
---
Sentinel or cavalier are tertiary effects. I was not saying you can have an armor piece that is both sentinel and cavalier. They are mutually exclusive.
---
Don't stop. don't ever stop I'm thoroughly enjoying this thanks.
---
On pc we have no achievements or trophies. We actually enjoy “the” game and not some achievement bs haha
---
I like the trophies. Before I started hunting them, I just did the story and whatnot and was very cut and dry with games. Since hunting trophies, I do everything that games have to offer now. I like it.
---
I take my sweet time when going for platinums, I still like to play the game and enjoy it as much as possible. I will never platinum a game in 2 days like friends I have do.
---
So just to follow up, in that spot in your pic I was around 80ish, jumped around 75-85, that was everything at Ultra.  With medium slider settings and low shadow distance but everything else back at ultra I gained around 25ish fps, so yeah pretty nice tweak.  Ill have to play around more to see if I notice a difference with the lowered sliders, didn't notice much of anything different in the little bit I played though.
---
Read my reply to u/ReturnOfTheLastJedi 
---
True, I never went all the way with the stealth build to truly test that. I didn't realise it gave agility tbh. It wouldn't exactly be broken though, plus it seems a fair trade for the resistance compared to the other armour types. 
---
It's not the only one. It's a event and it's triggered on many places, I got the rare vendor spawn [downhill of Lady Janet's Soft Serve.](https://i.imgur.com/BOjyIdF.png) If people decide to shit on it there's also plenty of other spots including north of Grafton and next to Charleston's Fire Dept.
---
That’s great! I have done something similar, where leaving the vault I was a clean shaven gentleman, now I am a bearded, scarred man with sickly colored skin and a scowl.
---
Yeah and people like you who try to make the consumer feel small and powerless only embolden us.
---
I am on Xbox. Do you have the witch costume plan???
---
What ive gathered, it doesnt spawn/trigger on the down time in EU like 10-17 hours but goes with NA times. Also you canT teleport instantly to it by pressing the mb1 but by enter key which is weird. 
---
Damn, she aged real poorly in there months
---
The wasteland is a harsh mistress 😆
---
It's been years since I actively played tf2 but I still remember all the mlp hentai and 2010 memes
---
Lol 😂 
---
If you have unyielding wood armor, you get 3 agility at low health. A set of 5 pieces means you get 15. With 15 base agility, you have 30. You pretty much won't be detected by anything if you keep yourself below 20% health. Assaultrons will push through you as they make their way to other players. With 30 agility you also have a ridiculous AP pool to live in VATs
---
yeah that re2 sure did hook some rubes into buying the same game again. 
---
the other of us played fallout for a bit.  
---
also had this happen last night. 
---
Yeah I’m laughing so hard at these posts saying to Beth “now that all duped items are out of game” can they get &lt;insert wishlist&gt;. They have no idea all of the duped items I’m aware of that still in game. 
---
Data or GTFO lol
---
How do people have all these caps? I'm level 80, have been hitting all vendors daily for a lot of my play time, and have probably had about 20k _total_ (based on when I got the 10k trophy). Do people just give you guys thousands of caps?
---
I actually haven't seen a 10% damage aiming railway you're right, that is odd as it's hardly an overpowered trait.  I understand that they intentionally left out the seriously broken combos due to the PVP nature of the game. A Quad fat man would decimate anyone as well as their frame rate. A Quad dragon would kill a scorchbeast in one 'ball' of ammo in a couple seconds from stealth. I am a big trader on the trader subreddits and I can confirm none of those exist atm. 
---
west tek and harpers ferry
---
Yep, I collected a few for re-sale, I was selling them for 800c each or 1200c for both plans, also have the skeleton mask/costume. 
---
The last picture is just Gollum
---
My character used the "mysterious serum" and doesn't have to worry about that anymore.
---
Yea it's just a thing that most people who are lower level or new. 
---
Every here and there I give greenies a fresh set of modified gear and weapons and some recipes. 
---
It's just like a welcome to the game kind of goodie bag since Fallout players never really did PvP since it was always offline so most people are just really friendly.
---
lol, omg, I didn't even make that connection - so, you're right! haha
---
But, really, I'm just referencing the fact that FO world is soooo ripe for dynamic events like these, I think they'd be awesome!
---
I wanna be close tho, that way the underleveled dont expect it ANELE Clap jk
---
The last time I was in a nuke zone I got a ton of violet flux, but none of the enemies loot ever loaded so I couldn't get the high radiation fluids that I needed to use them.  I haven't really played since then.
---
This is useful. I didn't realize gladiator effected the gauntlet. im gonna have to rethink strength.
---
You mean the remake that drastically improved upon the original and it's sitting on a overwhelming positive reviews and selling millions of copies ?
---
Or the cash grab poor copy created to milk sheep with the same engine of last game, that have terrible score and a high refund numbers ? 
---
lol ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Keep trying my friend, who knows you may even end up justifying to yourself you were not made a sucker by Bethesda.
---
I'm level 42 it's still just dropping short hunting rifles for me when dealing with super mutants and pipe guns when dealing with scorched. 
---
The only place I've really found we're a couple combat rifles drop consistently is that Camden Park. On the map it's the icon that looks like a wooden roller coaster all the way to the left and down next to the river. 
---
I'm doing the same thing. I just want to grind a bunch up for scrap to get all of the upgrades. I'm considering just making them and then scrapping them. That seems like an awful big waste of resources. 
---
I would upvote this 1000 times if I could. Here's hoping this "Wild Appalachia" thing they're planning brings all of these goodies!
---
That's awesome! Looking forward to the more permanent one at your camp
---
Couple guys rolled up on my base the other night. I was mid nuka grenade toss and remembered passive mode was on...just left world
---
Contrary to popular belief, bashing and  criticizing are not synonymous. 
---
im over lvl 200 would i get a 50 lvl All Rise as i havent completed that quest yet
---
It would be a pretty cool feature in a Fallout game if your character accumulated scars and such over time. 
---
Down with this sort of thing!
---
On console, you can quick swap as an option. I feel it's easier than the weapon wheel.
---
Building montage lol
---
Yet it's still Reclamation Day on the pipboy.
---
You know you can use the “repair all“ option pretty easily? And maybe set up some defenses or just switch servers if this happens again. 
---
It would be great until you had to walk around a guy with a "Hang all n******rs",  "Julie sucks dead horse d****" or other things I hesitate to suggest as I don't want any nice people with badges knocking on my door.  Or the Spanish Inquisition.
---
I'd love to have some of the suggestions mentioned here but we all know it wouldn't stop there.  Maybe something with a more limited editing ability?
---
you see the problem here is you let the car explosive do the work for you. Not saying go full melee chris brown on that ghoul but just kill it yourself.
---
Is it thee last variant of bench ? Kinda old looking ? I have been everywhere. It's the last one I need. On PC will also pay as much as 2k caps for this plan. 
---
You literally did not have to sit and watch unless you wanted to. 
---
Because otherwise you could buy everything on a vendor every day with enough farming. All those patterns would be bought up in a week.
---
I found a Black Powder Rifle called THE DRAGON in one of the mines but I think that was the only random named weapon I found just lying around.
---
Perk = Power Smith
---
Thats the one.
---
This would be good. 
---
I have enjoyed all of them, even when many fans criticized unity and syndicate and called for ubisoft to be crucified (much like this sub) i still loved those two.
---
I think my favorite at this time is still the ezio trilogy followed closely by black flag.
---
I wonder if the science cards were meant to be damaged boosters for energy weapons but the decision was made to not do that
---
Ok. Thank you
---
Like the Mr. Handy from fallout shelter
---
You miss the point. The car must explode.
---
I’ve found both plans twice and hats not working for me either :( at least the hat spawns in a few places tho!
---
Nobody bought the gold .44 skin? It’s my shit.
---
Cowboy hat, Blackbird, Grog outfit, Gold .44, camo Hunting Rifle, White shag carpet, that’s it I believe.
---
“ it just works “. 
---
Saw bottlecaps ? Is there a way to place caps in a container ?? I call bullshit. 
---
Yeah  modding power armor was confusing to me as well but armorer perk only applies to non-power armor in this game.    I've modded T51 before but can't remember which perk was equipped to get it done. Someone else who posted here said power smith.  That might be what you need but not sure.
---
I clicked on it without reading the title and actually through it was a Porygon.
---
This I so fucking brilliant they don’t even have a word for it.
---
*MODUS disliked that.*
---
No, what we need is more Stash capacity
---
You missed the point. The car must explode. Killing the feral is irrelevant.
---
Ye i am, you'd be surprised how much you can get for selling all the useless bones, glass, rubber and oil you have lying around.
---
What do you need glass for? Windowed wall iirc, nothing more. So you can pretty kuch just bulk it up and sell it for like 6 caps a bulk iirc. 1400 a day, mans gotta make caps somehow when quests yield next to nothing and traveling eats it all up.
---
Why bother picking it up though if you're just gonna throw it away? 
---
And ye i get its annoying, i do, and ofcourse an increase in breathing space is always nice. But i just feel there are more important things they should focus on first like bugs
---
First time i fought the queen i burned through like 3-4 cores in 15 minutes because all i was doing was vats shooting. Haven't used vats hardly at all in power armor since. 
---
No, Nicaragua.
---
I long to not keep throwing stuff away lol!!
---
 I had to create a character to store the stuff I didn’t want to lose. All the hard to craft ammo, armors and semi cool weapons  etc I’m waisting valuable damage perk cards on weight saving perks .  I’ve got the excavator maxed out for weight just to be able to manage !!! 200 pounds will go fast !! 
---
It was just the same in F4.
---
CRLMSM
---
*on a sign*
---
I just searched up Power Smith so it allows you to make advanced power armour mods so I need to be level 41
---
That type of weapon got nerfed
---
Well unless you have the lead belly perk too, you’ll end up dead on the floor with all your junk stolen. 
---
I'm almost always in my jet pack power armor but barely ever use the jet pack, doesn't seem to be that bad compared to using vats. 
---
So the only response we have against camp griefers is for us to ditch and lose our progress in current quests, events, and workshops? That seems like a pretty shitty game mechanic. 
---
Last week I had a couple of asshats griefing me and I tried to server hop but it kept putting me back in the same server. After 3x I just logged off and played something else. 
---
That’s just terrible game design.
---
I like this idea. Additionally, I want more window options. Particularly, I want shutter windows for all wall variants. I love them on the wood walls, but I'd like some other options. If I could get log walls with shutter windows, my crazy, mountain hillbilly, cannibal would be quite happy. 
---
They nerfed it to sub 100 damage, screw this game I am out!
---
*”Slap my salami, that guy’s a commie”*
---
Not possible with the way the creation engine and the weapon customization system at best would only allow maybe on a few more than there currently is
---
Hey, do you still have a spare one for sale? I would love to get one c:
---
Ok so everyone except for this guy can do it
---
take over posiedon power plant and power it up, you get tons of cores and they are all 100%.
---
Wood is weeker then metal and stuff i believe
---
I've seen no vender or player with this bench. Been doing events to try getting it as a random reward but no luck. 
---
Ok bye
---
It should be one, in all honesty, but you never know they may patch a way in for it to be a legit unlock. 
---
Tse handmade and Gatlings are still powerful, just less game breaking.
---
Most people like Bloodied Explosive these days. 
---
I wanna slap people with a bitch sign
---
Turns out it was jam and he was bringing you a lovely pb&amp;j. Too bad you can’t apologize to his corpse.
---
Yes, I’m aware of that, but thanks for trying to help! Please see my third paragraph where I mentioned this.
---
Lol thanks
---
And that’s the reason I just don’t have any at all. Then again I live in the forest, so the worst I have to deal with is scorched and liberators. 
---
My friend has every camp plan but he got most of them before the update. Hes pretty sure he got this one in Watoga but I've had no luck. The venders still change their stocks ever so slightly thats how I was able to get the vault tec locker and a few other ones I was missing. Who knows maybe this one isn't properly appearing right now.
---
I wish trap bases were more of a thing, I mean it's possible, but barley. 
---
Trolls?  I think you mean pissed off customers.
---
I’ve collected one of each in my STASH
---
Actually I dropped that mole rat in your base....
---
False. Your etiquette fails immediately.   
---
You need to understand the spawn mechanics if you wanna be courteous.
---
Works for most of the 50 plus level.   
---
1: You spawn to the train station.   
---
2: See theres nobody close in the killing grounds.   
---
3: Proceed to the 1st close by right most cabins near the corner pond (habiting 1-2 radstags)   
---
4: Go through the upper cabins until the gate checkpoint where the odd whitesprings bots reside.   
---
5: Proceed to the sidemost ghouls residing in the golf field green and the pit. (this should give next player waiting on trainstation to queue the spawn process again.)  
---
6: Depending on the speed on the guy queing trainstation you should continue with the upper cabins killing.   
---
7: After the river and last upper cabins go to golf club. (feel bad when ppl teleport to golf club and you get all the kills even tho you killed yours)  
---
8: Proceed to kiddie pond kitchen cabinet where is one ghoul.   
---
9: Go to the lower cabins.   
---
10: After clearing cabins empty out the laundromat, then the laundry yard.   
---
11: Feel Bad how shit loot you got and do it again. Maybe try get that calibrated shocks from enclave... wait tis already bought?! noo wayyy, change server -&gt;
---
Upgrade to concrete or metal. 
---
Get a good build.
---
definitely go to whitesprings for those. I've gotten almost 40 hardened mass in one whitesprings run. 
---
Would be cool if you could upgrade your walls, like in Fortnite. Reinforce them so they can take a lot more damage.
---
I know the feeling, I had to do the same myself for a while. I don’t think we should be forced to shelve our PA suits because of this issue but we don’t have much of a choice at the moment unless we have a ton of cores in storage.
---
Correction: Unions are socialism in Pre-War nationalists in Fallout
---
I don't really see a problem with that either.  If u want to buy everything after spending 12 hours playing then so what.
---
By level 200, I'd definitely laugh if it was just a picture of a pile of ash.
---
So long,  good luck elsewhere. 
---
No loss here then. 
---
With the 'Power User' perk card (level 3), power cores are never an issue; even with vats heavy builds. I do remember how quickly they drained before level 50. Just grind it out my friends! When I was grinding to 50 I started each session hitting up fusion core spawn sites.
---
thats what i do. I loot every pile of meat i see and theres usually tons of everything all over whitesprings. 
---
Is Jill on meth ?
---
If you’re Xbox I have spare wood if you need it.
---
Good bye,  thank you for the well wishes
---
Asshole!
---
I dropped one nuke in my entire play through since beta. A exploiter 20-30 levels above me came "help" me to launch it, even tho i wanted to do it solo. Its really meh. 
---
Lmao yas!
---
In case you were not aware, if you move your camp (even to the same location) then you only have to pay the 40 caps or so to move it. All your damaged stuff reappears in your storage and you can put your building back down without repairing anything. Sorry you had to deal with assholes.
---
Aw I am 100% inspired to do this! Going to start another character tonight!
---
Plasma guns are more powerful with the flamer mod.
---
Literally melts through enemies nice and quick.
---
I would like to be able to rip up street signs and use them. Like a yield sign, stop sign, street sign etc. Oh and a craftable whitesprings sign one so I dont feel like I wasted so many caps on it.
---
Anytime!
---
You might imagine that we see this,  often. So yes,  good luck,  enjoy another game and see ya. 
---
Looks like the scumbags got your post removed.
---
I was thinking the exact same thing.
---
I respectfully disagree and refer you to my third paragraph’s last sentence where I mention this issue still drains cores quickly with the relevant perk card equipped. For reference, I’m well beyond level 50 and this issue has been happening as far back as when I got my first power armour suit when I was far below level 50.
---
There have been a couple posts about some ritual shrines that seem to be emanating strange “energy” around Appalachia that didn’t used to before. If so, it kinda sounds like maybe Bethesda is slipping some of this kinda stuff into the game. I’m crazy into that idea. :) 
---
I don't know if that's what it's supposed to be but I end up with that same haircut every ime I get too lazy with a long mohawk lol
---
Was that you? I was wondering why you left those meds there. It's cool, I was just clearing the Gold Course out anyway, farming XP, items, and caps.   
---
No biggie. I didn't even see your emotes was just happy to clear stuff out with ya. Glad you got what you needed. 
---
It dropped for Ultracite ver. from Queen today to me. I have no idea what I should to do with. Trade it if it's worth something or learn it?!?
---
I agree!
---
I think you missed the point of me even responding to your comment.  It was to suggest you treat other people with respect.
---
At no point did I think that Fallout 76 was better than many games out there.
---
I object only to you shitting only people for having their own preference.
---
You definition of sheep clearly doesn't include the millions you cited rebuying a game based on the brand name.
---
I bought a half price game, I expected half ass returns.  Calling me a sheep is pretty unfounded.  C
---
Calling others sheep in a sub you had to opt into is just a shitty personal decision.  It doesn't add anything to the sub, the discussion OP started or really to anything at all.
---
If you get off on insulting different interest groups, again, you do you boo.  I've just been trying to meet you tit for tat so you could get a dose of your own trash talk.
---
And I mean, lots of people do it on the internet, so if you want to be a sheep, go for it.
---
PS.  Nice Kingdom Hearts fan art you did after the "lol" there.
---
A 90 year old grandma in a power armor. Better not say no to sweet rools and tea when she offers.
---
I guess the plus side of wood is it's much easier to repair.
---
You need to have actual combat perks equipped to 1-shot things now. If it was only 240 damage as a TSE that means you didn't have any perks equipped anyway
---
 Don't use VATS! Works for me. ;)
---
Does it say removed? I havent gotten any notification. 
---
I'd replicate the data from the server to the client,no need to modify the client.
---
All inventory change requests are sent to the server, server tells the client its inventory changes with a total inventory crc check.
---
Just use JSON for the format.
---
Adding a friend, who accepts the add, usually fixes it. 
---
Other way is wait a week...
---
...and hello useless facebook-esque posts about every little thing we do in our lives that are completely irrelevant and makes no contribution to the sub in any way whatsoever!
---
It's really bothers me that people who play this don't put a little bit of grime/dirt over there faces, there's an option for it and it should at least be somewhere between 30 to 70 maybe possibly two layers of different grime/dirt
---
NA? Either they increased the event spawn rate from 1-2 months ago or... Its for the benefit of NA timezone players. What i gathered over the couple of weeks i tried farming different events, in same or changing servers, the rate is not that high to able to achieve 11 per day. While the 800 pound more stash seems to support my conclusion this game is taking a dive to cater to its fleeing player base.
---
Dont you think there are more important things they should be working on? Like bugs and balancing, not to a perfect degree, but to where there is at least more than one useful gun per type?
---
Interestint. When i was level something i explicitly remember running from level 60 ghouls. Maybe its coz the high level players tend to congregate there. 
---
Haha, as it would for anyone! Almost as good as if you would have recommended that I just stop playing the game. :P
---
"Your Ad Here"
---
"Space Available for Rent"
---
Enjoy!
---
I love this!  That what have I gotten myself into look for lvl 5 and then Lvl 40 looks rose might have gotten to her a little!
---
Just as easy to break.  
---
Whitesprings, Watoga, West Tek and Prime are the favorites, Morgantown too
---
I have at least three 1-shot specific perks, which pushed the rifles damage up from base, and still do have them equipped, sooooooo..............
---
The answer is they nerfed the shit out of a rare drop
---
let me start by saying i am sorry for what happened to you.. it sucks.. i got my camp leveled couple days ago by a level 455 and a couple of his friends who i couldnt do any damage to at all. so feel your pain..  
---
BUT,
---
you claimed a workshop, that announces you to the server "so and so is open to pvp" not hard to check a workshop, check map, find person, travel to them to fight/kill them. workshops are not "oh here ill get some stuffs" they are intended pvp hubs, fight for resources types of things.. you start one you are accepting and announcing to everyone on the server come fight (and cancelling the benefits of pacifist). its been that way from the start, they even stated they are basically intended as pvp arenas to fight for scraps instead of going out and finding them. if you claim a workshop DO NOT go to your house. period. you sitting in a location for more than 5 minutes announces "theres something there" its how a friend of mine finds peoples camps to go freak them out in her clown suit. she watches maps to see who is moving and who is not moving.  
---
griefing is not what happened here.. griefing would have been spawn camping you a killing you over and over and over, following you around map doing same thing over and over.. you basically negated pacifist by claiming a workshop, then respawned in your camp after being killed the first time. you did this to yourself. when you died should have left world since they were at your house. 
---
there is so many things you could have done differently to have kept this from happening, and by design this world/game is set up to allow these things. you are supposed to be wary of other players, you are supposed to play defensively. you are supposed to expect anyone you walk up on may decide to shoot you in the face.   
---
i got suckered by inviting a reddit trader to my house and his friends leveled it. my mistake for not meeting at a trainstation, or meeting on a world my camp could not be placed on, or logging out immediately soon as the camp took damage. will i be more careful next time.. you bet your ass i will, did i learn something absolutely..  
---
i never take a workshop without expecting someone to come kill me.. when i get one i turn off pacfist, empty junk, and i watch the map, every move i make is slow and methodical because i know i am going to be hunted.. 99% of the time, never happens.. but it can..   
---
again sorry this happened to ya. but ya wouldnt go to harlem/detroit/gary/compton/hell my own backyard waving phat stacks at midnight screamin through a bullhorn "ive got phat stacks" and not expect to get shot in the face. and claiming a workshop is essentially doing just that.. its just that 95% of the server could careless about you or your workshop.. right now anyways.
---
again sorry you and your camp got smoked, but that is not griefing.  
---
and i state all this as a player who typically hates any and all kinds of pvp.. i never thought once in fallout 4 "hey it would be nice to shoot another player" i always thought "hey i wish i could play with my friends and show them my builds.
---
Survivor! I'm adding scars and weight loss to my character as he gets his ass kicked  
---
- I'm saying he's maybe 5 years out - you've inspired me to start aging him... thanks!
---
Try 12 SB (8 of them lvl. 80), 3 Scorched Mirelurk Queens,  12 Mirelurk Kings, ~150 Scorched... All within an hour... No nuke
---
Shhhh don't look too hard, you'll get cancer
---
How do you kill that which has no life?
---
You are getting downvoted by dirty griefer only. 
---
Thanks cozysarkozy, interesting technique, relies heavily on the people in the queue knowing what to do as well, but I bet its cool when it works, anyway the point of last nights drunken post was specifically when you are at the Golf Club at the same time as someone else, at your point 7, instead of feeling bad, share the kills. 
---
On the contrary. The game thinks, by certain weird definition, the car blew up by itself, and doesnt register the hits you, the player put into the car. Why should it give you the award, ergo the lack of prize like a legendary instead of a meager item you received. 
---
I know the struggle lol
---
Don’t hit back. Them getting caps after killing you was a clear indicator you attacked back. It’s not cheating to attack other players. It’s not how you want to play but the mechanics are in the game. Change servers. 
---
It can if you reprogram locks and keys to work that way. Currently they don't.
---
Whitesprings. Never leave.
---
I have no problem with that. I've been known to leave stuff for people also.
---
Haven't played in two weeks but I certainly favored my Bloodied Lever Action.
---
I just stating a fact, fallout 76 was a shit game made to cash in on sheep, whatever people get their feelings hurt by the truth is not my problem.
---
&gt; I bought a half price game, I expected half ass returns. Calling me a sheep is pretty unfounded.
---
Is it though ? I mean you still payed money for half finished game....
---
&gt; If you get off on insulting different interest groups, again, you do you boo. I've just been trying to meet you tit for tat so you could get a dose of your own trash talk.
---
&gt;And I mean, lots of people do it on the internet, so if you want to be a sheep, go for it
---
Again, just stating my opinion, if people get their feelings hurt because they got scammed it's not my business.
---
Yes! I love that gun.  I have a one star and a two star with explosive. It doesn’t do the trick when your bum rushed by girls though
---
I don't pick it up it just piles on it's own. I have tagged materials that i need to pick up for making ammo which includes steel, acid, lead and other stuff buf a lot of unwanted materials also pile up by scraping stuff that contains what i need. I really don't care about caps, but if i do want to empty all vendors i would just pick up some flowers from nuked whitesprings. They sell for about 14 caps a piece since i pick 2 at once with green thumb and there are hundreds of nuked flowers just laying there. A lot more efficient then farming plastic just do i can sell some cheap junk with 3 caps a piece.
---
You should report it to u/ Reddit in a private message. It seems like somebody is exploiting some kind of site system to get posts they don't like removed.
---
What's so great about acid? Everyone's raving about it but I rarely find myself needing it
---
I play sneak vats rifle build and let me tell you, glass cannon mode makes the game far more enjoyable and intense when i know a mistake means i'm probably dead. Games too easy to be playing it safe, make it more interesting!
---
US government drops can only be opened by the person that requested them. If you lock pick them you become wanted.
---
3rs character and you still don't know how to level up?
---
Anyway nuke zones.
---
Remember this when your high level, and a low level asks for help. I'm always helping n00bs, cause when I was level 10 higher levels helped me out. Big time
---
Martial artist does work with deathclaw gauntlet. For a bloodied melee build I would recommend iron fist 3, incisor 3, and martial artist 3. Blocker is good if you find yourself dying a lot. Another good thing to get is unyielding armor, as it dramatically increases the damage.
---
"Shrouded"?
---
No I only point out the facts. Someone declaring they will not shop at (insert store) is a meaningless threat. Every single day companies across the world will make choices that will drive some people away. It is a fact of life. 
---
Amen to that!!
---
*Why Can't We Be Friends*  
---
Because this is the internet and people have opinions.
---
R/fo76 was made because r/fallout clowned on it so much. All the discussion moved here because there was no chance for it there. Believe it or not, discussion happens here, along with worthy criticism. The filthy casuals sub is for people that want to bury their head in the sand. And I say that as someone whose head was covered in sand at launch.
---
I'm really sorry. I just looked in my stash and realized I don't have it anymore. I must have sold it and forgot about it. 
---
I truly apologize for misleading you
---
UPDATE: previous commenter was correct you can find them at Palace of the winding path. You DON'T need to activate the event. The normal Scorched that are just waiting inside the palace have several combat rifles. I got three in one go through. I've done the event before it's pretty intense to try to do alone. I would recommend having a team with you. 
---
If you're gay, as you may, run your sentinel and cavalier
---
I'll let you know- it ain't just for show -I have an assassins gamma gun, 
---
now there's no fun, when one runs and I miss every shot, so believe me
---
your laggy ass will be the only thing saving you from my three shot. 
---
Solo... I'm looking for a new prospective, maybe I missed something, i'm not ignorant thanks.  
---
I wanna say 3 star legendary weapons. But theres not that much content to come back to i think i will until TBD. I have the watoga quests where i get the all rise still open but i want to leave some lose ends, so it doesnt become final. 
---
Are you unable to separate your actions from the purchase of the game?
---
Feelings aren't effected by the game purchase, but by individuals insulting that purchase, people's preferences and their opinions.  
---
Do you understand this?
---
Your actions are the offending issue here.  You're insulting people.  That's rude.  It's uncalled for.
---
Hopefully you grow out of it or whatever.
---
We don't care what you think of a game you didn't play. Insulting people isn't justified by your opinion.
---
I hope you enjoy your choices in life, as they are yours.
---
You need it for smelting, so if you capture any of the workshops with mineral resources you'll need tons of it.
---
Then why did I get the mission to get it? Seems like a trap &lt;insert obligatory Star Wars GIF&gt;
---
I knew I saw you flappy ass hovering above my base... And I knew you run from fights but sending mole rats instead of fighting yourself is just weak...
---
I think you can wait for the owner of the drop to unlock it.
---
Whitesprings isn't great for a level 10. I can tag and wait for other to clear, but that's far from ideal.
---
Never heard of it but going to look today 
---
Did they add crossbows to the legendary list recently? Got a two shot (decent, not great), quad (have to load four times) from drops and saw a shitty 3* in vendor only today, yet had only seen about the same number of regular crossbows in my whole playthrough before today
---
THIS SIGN INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 
---
NO MOE DUPED SIGNS 
---
GIVE ME MORE STORAGE OR GIVE ME DEATH
---
WILL WORK FOR FLUX 
---
THIS THIS THIS THIS
---
 I never have used VATS. I was serious. ;)
---
 I have played, for thousands of hours, all the Fallout 3D games, and have never used VATS. It just seemed like cheating and I don't. 
---
 I figure I get about half of my hip shot Lever Action .45s into her when I fight a Scorchbeast. I have no idea what that means in a VATS environment though. I shoot at her when at a distance and at her armpits when a bit closer. It takes a while, but not that long for a 50. ;)
---
MY god I stopped doing the stupid quest with alpha and bravo keycards! I've got like 30 of each WTH!
---
Lets all agree to disagree once again the soundtrack was maybe the best thing about a Fallout game.  
---
I know i for one am singing Jukebox Saturday Night in the shower wayyy tooo much.
---
Power user perk ftw! Theres another one that stops the fusion core from draining from sprinting but I forgot what it's called. Use both those perks at the same time... the fusion cores last so much longer 
---
Yeah but the real fact is, few if any of them have ever really felt the full force of a complete boycott. That day will come. Companies will go bankrupt. The consumer will finally know the power is truly in their hands.
---
Or just get yourself some good old calibrated shocks
---
I have two thoughts on this.  
---
1) Every time I get a workshop, unless it's something I  absolutely critically need, I just leave it open for anyone to harvest stuff.   
---
2) Once I really needed lead, for ammo, and some random came by at Poseidon Power and looted 1 lead scrap out of  the hopper, and ran after engaging my turrets. I follwed him, killed him, took the 1 lead in his bag back, left a random junk loot item (1 loose screw if I remember) and then left him alone after. :D
---
A bit late to the thread but can we also get the value listed on the item to match what the vendor is going to give me for it? Why have an item with a value of 300 caps if the vendor is going to go full Game Stop and give me 5 caps. 
---
Any idea where Lead Lined Combat Armor Chest Plans spawn?
---
You can use concrete floors to make a base.
---
Makes it indestructible 😀

 Yup,  fight level 25s to 60+. The higher the level of the enemy you down, the more you earn XP. There is no faster way!
---
Honestly, getting hard to tell the difference now a days. Bethesda is well aware of the issues the HAS; weapon damage balancing, durability integrity, enemy balancing, etc. But, how are they suppose to get to that what the biggest issue for the longest time was players intentionally fucking in the game for everyone else? People running around with duped TSE weapons melting enemies in the end game is just gonna tell Bethesda that weapons are too powerful; result? Needed weapons and perks. People running around with THOUSANDS of pounds of gear crashing the system, stacking bobble heads to gain ludicrous stats, shit that breaks the game that prevents Bethesda from focusing on shit that already needed fixing. What are they gonna do: Focus all resources on stopping server side crashes, or focus on a few weapon types underperforming in the long run? And let’s not forget the ‘trade glitch’ that falsely spread like a wildfire on this sub. How many resources do you think were diverted from working on fixing energy weapons and heavy weapons to keep players from getting their best stuff snatched up by opportunistic players, only to realize the whole thing was a hoax? The player base is the most toxic thing for this game. It keeps the developers from focusing on what need to be fixed. Without the trolls, this game would be a hell of a lot further along than it is!
---
Nice. I'll add that to my patrol. Thanks!
---
Did your character take a load of meth somewhere between level 1 and 5?
---
They nerfed two shot from +100% dmg to only +25% dmg and they nerfed explosive bullets from +100% dmg to only +20% dmg. They also nerfed Demolition Perk from +100% dmg to only +60% dmg.
---
Most painful thing to realise is we WANT this to be real so bad that it probably is nothing important in reality.
---
"I HAVE A LOT OF COMPLAINTS &amp; IDEAS, BUT TOO MANY FOR JUST ONE SIGN!"
---
Are you talking about pure flux or raw? I recall on whitespring recently I've pulled on one nuke, though it took like 3 hours, I was mostly killing the ghouls but collecting same time, I got maybe 600 total raw flux.
---
 A lot of it was unneeded type, but then I only collected about 70% of area.Hmm I looked my screenshots, didn't got any violet, Ive found use for cobalt and crimson though, while fluorecent and yellowcake not so much.
---
Still 100 of any raw, seems such a small amount. I think I've got about 300 raw from prime site.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insult
---
How exactly anything I did was insulting ?
---
That's some snowflake behavior there.... how do you go on through life with such thin skin ?
---
Perfect suggestion. I make the rounds and claim those when I first log in and I don't worry about mats anymore, unless I'm crafting a lot of stuff at once.
---
Who actually downvoted me what...
---
That's painful
---
griefing means harrassment, the guy wasnt harrassed, he wasnt chased around the server being killed repeatedly, he was spawn camped and killed as he was loading over and over..   
---
he claimed a workshop (initiating pvp), then left the pvp area to go chill at his camp (notifying pvpers where he lived/camped). they came and killed him and leveled his camp. he respawned there that would have told them he chose to fight.   
---
if he had no interest in something like this happening he should have left the workshop alone, he never should have went to his house after claiming workshop (thats why you can make stashes, crafting benches, beds, and so on). and left the server at first sign of trouble. 
---
watch your GPU temperatures while you play OP, maybe you're overheating 
---
Haha well you've just been unlucky, they have been here the whole time:) (They cant be explosive though). I wish Quad didn't have to actually reload 4 times, it has an awesome fire rate!
