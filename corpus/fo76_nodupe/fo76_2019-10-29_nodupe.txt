Even though I'm curious in your opinion is the fallout 1st worth the money they asking for it?
---
&gt; Modders will fix it. Unless mods stay locked behind a subscription fee, that is.
---

---
Fallout 4's Creation Club shows that these two things are not mutually exclusive.
---
Ditto. I have zero interest in the scrap stash and the other convenience items. It ruins an aspect of the challenge.
---
Fo76 is not a job
---
Your "side's" histrionics are disappointing.
---
I bought a year and would have bought loot boxes too.
---
Now you gotta link em for proof!
---
Will do üëåüèº
---
100% positive this is yet another example and toxic reason why private servers with friends only was requested and will continue to grow... thanks!
---
That doesn't make sense, lorewise.
---
Same for me, first time logging in after patch but nothing after that
---
Haha it was just how I felt
---
300 atoms. 500 for the multicolored set.
---
[removed]
---
This is awesome! Even more so if you know the meme...lol
---
I mean that's true but it doesn't justify what they're doing, nor did I mention the scrap bot.
---
[deleted]
---
People harrassed you...because you lost scrap...or because you bought the subscription?
---
The special human bond forged between players is something that can be done in real life, don't see how this is attributed to FO76, unless you've never learned to form basic human bonds to begin with.
---
I price all food recipes at 5 caps and all chem recipes at 150 caps. CAMP-related plans I price at 20-30% of the stated value, armor and weapons plans at 30-40% of stated value, with the factor being my own experience with their comparative rarity. Super common plans (if I inadvertently collect them) go in a blue suitcase in a train station along with low-demand ammo (e.g. .38 and .44). I get reasonable sell-through. Some days I'll sell one plan. Some days I'll sell through 20-30.
---
This hits home hard. Game deleted 4 of my fresh made characters because of this. Spent about 2-3 hours on each character. First time I quit, and was sad to see my character didn't exist anymore. The other 3 times, I got server disconnected.
---
I did switch. I started playing some rainbow6siege with friends and playing Outer Worlds by myself. Most of us have transition out of fallout after the last debacle, I was playing so much because I enjoyed the grind and the game to an extent.
---
I‚Äôm sorry for your losses
---
I'm honestly ashamed that I still play this game knowing that beth doesn't care about anyone of us and them putting out fallout first just proves it.
---
It‚Äôs very harsh
---
I think it's equally dumb as hell to do, but I kinda get their view. If they can force the 1st players to quit, it affects Bethesda's bottom line and says "Fix your shit, NOW!". They won't have any choice but to talk about it or do another stupid stunt like this while ignoring any nay saying.
---
He makes some good points at times but just wait he will delete this one like so many others
---
Fallout76 is becoming WACK!!
---
Just stop lol smh üòÇ
---
Oh damn man. You made me laugh so hard. ‚ÄòYou son of a bitch‚Äô !!!
---
For anyone doubting,&amp; having free time,
---
Find this ‚ÄúAtom Bomb Baby‚Äù woman &amp; ask her...
---
Someone‚Äôs gotta know her,hell...
---
Someone already asked the OP If It was In fact said woman.
---
Otherwise,let the OP have the best ‚Äú3 minutes of there life‚ÄùFFS.
---
If it is damage control on Beth‚Äôs part,then congratz,you mo clever then dem.
---
If not,Juiced had a good few minutes In a generally dope wholesome way.
---
Not everything In 76 has too be rotten,nor centered around 1st.
---
The game existed before 1st did,&amp; it was good too me then,&amp; It‚Äôll continue too be dope,
---
Hopefully.
---
Regardless of this FO1st,(tragedy,fresh content,debacle)whatever ya wanna categorize it as. 
---
Play &amp; be happy people,It‚Äôs just a game
---
Stay Blessed
---
True indeed, little to nothing will be just part of the game, everything will have it's price if this continues. If they(BGS) know they can get you once, oh will they always. Make content worth buying and they can have my money, simple as that. Not preying on the casuals who are willful piggy banks.
---
I would love this! Always wanted a drawing of my character! If you ever do more please hit me up!
---
Die and lose your goodies in a spot you cannot reach without dying again, that'd be awesome lol.
---
speaking of camps....did they lower the budget?
---
I actually love the "1st hunters" they are the same people who called themselves "duper hunters" in the past and they still giving me all their caps because of their holier than thou attitude.
---
I wish they had been more clear about "stash box" and scrap box". Much of the stash (weapons, apparel, aids) can NOT go in the scrap box, only scrap. The stash box holds every item, the scrap box only holds scrap.
---
I notice players are using both terms for the different boxes.
---
All they need to do is make the scrap box and tent available to everyone.  Put them in the atom shop, whatever, just level the playing field without forcing us to spend real money.
---
I use both the icon and armor and I actually am looking for trouble, nothing like a self righteous prick to give me some remorse free caps.
---
XB1 here, haven't heard the Mayor since the update. But, I have been getting plenty of 1* legendary items from 3* legendary creatures, specificially scorchbeasts.
---
For those who are on Xbox One and experiencing this... Xbox Game Pass has a $1 (30 day) trial right now. Get it and play Outer Worlds.
---
i think that's because the people who were upset over this like myself just uninstalled and moved on, whoever is left are the folks who either don't care or rationalize that giving a game company even more money for things that they said were impossible at launch is perfectly reasonable. enjoy the game tbh, im enjoying other things and will not purchase a Bethesda product again, im also a bit older, so I guess im old enough to remember other companies doing this right before they tanked.
---
Sort of a shame the kid is getting into Fallout when Bethesda has gone full shitbag but still wholesome on their end
---
Each area has a photomode challenge. Take 20, only the forest requires specific areas. 
---
Go to toxic valley, ash heap, savage divide, the mire and the bog, spam photomode, delete ans move on.
---
They still have not adjusted that rate :(
---
I am willing to bet that the vast majority of F01st subs are hardcore players that are easily capable of soloing a nuked WS. Any generic 2 handed melee PA build can do it with hardly any resources used. 
---
There is no way you will ever have an entire nuke zone to yourself on a public server unless you nuke an area that is pointless or nuke the queen when there's only low levels around. I have over 700 hours in the game and it never happened once. Even in the 0.00001% chance you did have it to yourself, if you are alone you have no way to respawn the enemies. Private servers allow you to leave and rejoin the same server which resets the spawns in nuke zones. Then you run a quick lap killing 100% of the enemies yourself, quit, rejoin, rinse and repeat for an hour or more straight and get a ridiculous amount of XP and legendary drops. No down time at all. Just plop down your tent, transfer all junk to the scrapbox (which gets auto-scrapped for you apparently) and go right back to farming. You can even drop all your extra legendaries in a world container and switch characters when you max your scrip.
---
I just think most subs are afraid to admit how much of advantage this gives them and that's why they are super defensive about it. It's like the same rush you get when you find an exploit in a game that allows you to circumvent a bunch of grinding, like the old money glitches in GTA: Online. They don't want everyone else to have access to it and they don't want it taken away because they like having an edge over other players.
---
I do agree with you that there is a difference between P2W and P4C, but in a game like this that is primarily focused on PvE and grinding, convenience is equally or maybe even more advantageous than having a way to directly buy more damage or defense. The amount of time that is saved by increased grinding efficiency and eliminating stash management is greater than having a faster kill time from more damage. Having to shoot one or two less handmade rounds or do an extra swing pales in comparison to not having to ever manage your stash or miss out on tagging a legendary enemy. These should be basic features imo. Everything but the private servers and the extra atoms should be available to everyone. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Sorry for the rant.
---
I like scavenging in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. I like being a junkie murder hobo and ganking everyone I can. I like dropping nukes on workshops and then defending it against waves of glowing ones and angry players. But mostly I like playing what is basically a fallout 4 multiplayer mod with my girlfriend, hanging out building huge settlements and defending them as long as we can. Well worth the 17$ each.
---
Been playing stellaris console edition and outer worlds instead.  Launched my nuke, killed the sbq and called it a day.  Bethesda ain't the same company no more.
---
These aren't private servers. Private servers are what you rent from G-Portal or [Low.Ms](https://Low.Ms) to get an Ark or Conan server for you and 10 friends, complete with 1) mod support, 2) a completely configurable experience, down to the re-spawn rate of ground drops and 3) no build limit. All of that will set you back about $30 for three months, for 10 people and you even have the power to whitelist clients by IP or steam username.  The Fallout 76 version is an objectively lousy deal by comparison.
---
Yeah I still believe Bethesda should have named it even more distinctive. Fallout 76 just sounds like Fallout with a bigger number.
---
They should have gone more into the MMO Lite nature of the game even in the title, something like Elder Scrolls Online. With ESO the distinction was clear, this is not Oblivion 2 or Skyrim 2 or Skyrim 76, this is a MMO in the Elder Scrolls universe. It is not the same game as Skyrim.
---
16x isn't about 720p vs 1080p vs 4K, it's about the texture detail.
---
FO4 had mostly 1K textures (1024x1024); F76 mostly has 4K textures (4096x4096); that's 16x the level of detail.
---
How nice! As a mom myself, and a big fan of FO, I usually play by myself or in a chat with my hubby and his friends cause my little ones are often noisy but I've met a few people who thought the random kids noises in the background were hilarious so I've made a few friends haha
---
why do we want bethesda modeling their business practices after *call of duty?*
---
I‚Äôm saving this post! I often wonder same thing, like how much does it even effect it or how much do multiple pieces help
---
then it doesn't apply to you, obviously. even so, you do realize some of them are fully stacked with assassin armor and quad teslas, right? not everyone is a pushover.
---
getting so high on your own horse can backfire, too.
---
The Children of Atom do not exist in 2102. So unfortunately, they will not be coming to Fallout 76.
---
Good news though is the Cult of the Mothman will be a secondary faction in Wastelanders.
---
Good question...I also want to know.
---
Actually I do have a lot of knowledge about game development considering I'm person getting a major in game development and watches a lot of documentaries and news about game development. Which is why the idea that adding npcs, something that's been a thing in all rpgs for decades now, is some great herculean feat that should be applauded for is so laughable to me :)
---
This is exactly what I've been thinking too, more it was meant to come out once the holiday shopping season hits after Thanksgiving, rake In both the new players and people giving it another try after wastelanders hit
---
it does stack, yes. it's been a while but someone tested it extensively. the video should be on youtube.
---
if memory serves with all pieces + food buffs you can get infinite running ap.
---
I have multiple videos of me spanking people using quad teslas and stealth boys. That build is only good against food builds. Its not a high horse, its retaliation and justice.
---
Only if they fixed the dart gun/ nuke mine combo last patch.
---
Atlantic ftw
---
yess, thank you for saying that. i still hang out with them rarely, but i don't really count on them or make them a priority anymore, my internet friends got my back and worry about me even from very far away &lt;3 that's all i need for now
---
I was excited to find the legendary scorchbeasts, had a great time killing them, only to be rewarded with a 1* Supressors Lead Pipe on one and 1* Mutant's Multi-Purpose Axe on the other. 
---
Well, when I went to Watoga to get rid of the axe, guess what I found in the Legendary Exchange, a 1* Nocturnal Shovel - I wonder where that came from.
---
What will kill videogames is if nobody buys what they're selling.  
---
If we all boycotted Atoms and First, Bethesda would have no more income stream, and shut down the game.
---
This would change the game for me. Thanks.
---
Be nice to....people?
---
Sorry that‚Äôs not something I do, ever, in any context!
---
You have a nice day
---
I just leave mine in the body at vault 76 entrance now. Hopefully it can help the new dwellers who emerge.
---
Just a heads up, you can spawn your own PA on the other side of theirs and get around that. Seen people try that at purveyor too
---
Oh damn this could be awesome!
---
ü§î
---
Wow llamajuice your just 3 days and $150 too late with this information. In all seriousness your post was helpful and made sense. Thank you. 
---
This benefit that MS extended to the Xbox community is generous for sure. I actually see where I went wrong with the whole scenario. Before getting the 2nd Xbox all GT‚Äôs we‚Äôre tied to one account and console. I knew of said ‚Äúhome Xbox‚Äù but not what it really did. So I did what I thought was the obvious thing when giving my son the Xbox one ( make it his home console with his GT ) while making the new Xbox One X my new home Xbox. I‚Äôm sure you could see where I‚Äôm going with this..
---
Doesn't seem like there is much need? Just scrap it and dump the raw mats in there, not like there is a penalty (some lost plastic, meh).
---
Bulk is only good for selling to NPCs and in some instances lowering weight. Both of those are kinda mood with the stash box no?
---
Lol yep, experience. 16 years now.
---
Yeah, it stays. They mention it on their site. Only the tent seems to go away. You can even sort of use the scrapbox. You will be able to withdraw stored scrap, just not add new things.
---
Just break down the bulk not a big deal
---
If you still need help me and my team can help.
---
Bethesda should consider hiring you for their PR department.
---
because it is 2 things? Plastic + whatever
---
why would you bulk anything youre not gonna sell?
---
Because bulked scrap is not loose scrap.
---
I share the same opinion as you. These are changes people wanted, we did not want a pay wall to get to it!!!!! The Outer Worlds is 1000 times better than 76.
---
So lucky you got that experience. I was 14 when it came out and got it that Christmas. Never could convince dad that video games can have great stories though.
---
weren't you complaining about stealth boys a couple days ago?
---
it was just an example anyhow. railways, legacy lasers or plasmas. pick your poison. point is that it could end badly for you just as well.
---
That doesn't make sense. Running sets AP regen to 0. You will still have to stop for a second for it to fill.
---
I have a full set of legendaries with it, and while they do stack, it doesn't really seem worth it past 1 piece if you are also running the perks. You still want Lone Wanderer and Action Boy because they are the only ones that work in power armor.
---
Depending upon the mods you want, I might be able to help. I have a lot of them... Sadly not all. Are you on PC?
---
gamerMOMover50 did a video couple of days ago on youtube
---
It‚Äôs. A. Fucking. Game. 
---
I had the rare opportunity to grind out about 14 hours over 3 nights this past weekend. I‚Äôve been playing since BETA when time allows, which isn‚Äôt always a lot, and I‚Äôm only level 49. My play style could be described like my typing is‚Äîhunt and peck. 
---
Those 14 hours could easily be described as some of the best time I‚Äôve spent in Appalachia yet. Not one server disconnect (playing on a fast, reliable connection) in all that time (late night/early morning east coast time). Player commerce (yardsaling) went well and was beneficial for all I was involved with. Maxed out a vendor for my first time, that was a blast. Did a few challenges and events, and all ran as advertised. Got in over my head a few times but wit and cunning let me live to see the next sunrise. Did not see as many other people playing when I did, and the number of other CAMPS was down compared to what I‚Äôve seen in the past. So I do believe FO1 is drawing some away from adventure mode. But that plays well to my solo play style, so I‚Äôm not upset. 
---
I don‚Äôt know, sure seems a lot of bluster over this all. It‚Äôs been going on a week now, and I‚Äôd hoped this horse was beat dead soon, but this will probably go on some time. I honestly don‚Äôt care how you play one way or the other. Just don‚Äôt be a dick to me or others when we play, and we‚Äôll return the courtesies. It‚Äôs just a game, and if frustrates you so bad, you can turn it off and go outside or something‚Äîsame thing I tell my 5 year old.
---
I was pointing out that stealthboys have no viable counter but that diesnt mean I dont spank them. I suppose there might be someone out there who is part of that petty group and can kill me but so far it's just been me in 4v1s on purpose making caps off of the toxic playerbase.
---
Thank you! I was not aware of this at all. I even have the plans for that.
---
I did a few times. Sadly some of them are smart and will have their team mates spawn their behind and to the sides of it.   
---
Last time I saw something like that was at the golf club.  Two teams of 4  had something near 12+ frames blocking the doors to the club while nuked. Luckily a few of them crashed and freed up room to enter.
---
Its just a tease at this point.  Like vault 51.
---
Is that the year, or the subscription price?
---
and you honestly expect anything in this game to work as it should? anyway, turns out I had the video on my history. don't know if it's been patched, but there you go:
---
https://youtu.be/zk-nEa2_Dts
---
I pre ordered the tricentennial edition even though the price halved the week after, with the promise that only cosmetics would be sold and that would be used to fund updates. Put 400 hours and $100 into atom shop. Xbox Game Pass is $10/mo and comes with Halo 1-5, forza, fallout 3, NV, and 4, metro exodus series, outer worlds, and more. My money is moving elsewhere, no problem if yours stays here but I don‚Äôt want to support companies trying to nickel and dime their player base
---
Even though I hate your decision to pay for Fallout First, you still deserve the same respect every human being deserves.  NOW EAT A BAG OF DICKS, OP!!!!  ;)
---
Neither is stable flux but it goes in.
---
That's makes more sense. Found a weightless combat leg and wanted to make the set. Didn't even notice it was legendary.
---
turns out I still had the video on my history. don't know if it still works, though:
---
I was talking about Fallout 1st. Private worlds will be required for modding. So authors would need to buy the subscription and make mods exclusively for other 1st class citizens. This will mean only a fraction of the mods we enjoy for Fallout 4
---
Lol, people are clever
---
What about stable flux? It like 4 things but it goes in.
---
unlimited storage space is game breaking 
---
and the tent should be free
---
the people playing the game shouldn't be what makes the game worth it. the *game* should be what makes the game worth it.
---
Selfish and petty too.
---
I got a non legendary one the other day and it did 200 damage with my iron fist perk.
---
To me ‚Äúpay to win‚Äù is where you obtain significant advantages over other players in a competitive game by paying for said advantages.
---
E.g: I played a mobile game for a month a few years ago (something about Vikings) that operated a lot like a civilisation game.
---
You could pay money and speed up production, skip production, buy high quality units (army units), buy shields to protect your City, buy teleports to teleport your city next to another, quickly attack and nuke the enemy to nothing then teleport away and put up a shield.
---
You could initially get teleports and shields for free when leveling up but that stopped after a point.
---
The game was (is?) a well monetised whale seeking machine that used every tactic to draw people in, even randomly offering a free box of stuff to newer players, as well as initial discounts, followed by steep price rises the more people were willing to pay.
---
It epitomises pay to win for me.  (And everything bad and predatory about the model).
---
So, FO76 is nowhere near that level of scumbaggery...but that‚Äôs comparing it to the worst of the worst of the worst...and Bethesda seems intent to see where the line is with players...but there is no line for whales, and that‚Äôs what their business model is heading towards, seeking whales who will pay out massive amounts to ‚Äúwin‚Äù.
---
1st hunting has made this game hugely entertaining for me, a nonsubscriber. best shit i've read since eve online.
---
Known uncommon bug, checking the machine after someone else has scrip'ed will sometimes show one or more of their legendary items
---
We all can't have a hive mind. Not everyone will be outraged by FO 1st.
---
Oh no I‚Äôve been playing since the beta, however I did stop after 2 months because of all the issues, I recently got back into the game so it‚Äôs been a while since a played and I‚Äôm genuinely having a blast
---
Im sure there's a few but 'alot'? No simply cause it's been such an ammo sink since the games been out
---
 Its 80 Explosive LOL, and 40 rads. It that's still right, my random armour crap buffs more than that. I also have Radshield hotkeyed as I hunt Scorchbeasts.
---
Haha yeah it‚Äôs great, this game definitely has a range of ages
---
ya Im not. these a-holes that payed for it can go screw off as they are at the core of the problem. The unlimited storage should atleast be for everyone and the free movement. What a bunch of crap. I have no reason to stick around and play and you know what I tried out Outer worlds for a couple hours and liked it.
---
That‚Äôs true. I forgot the legendary armor is unequipped in PA.
---
your decision to support 1st affects us all whether you like it or not. I'd argue that supporting predatory business practices is more toxic than banter. it's no surprise that people are gonna be angry at it.
---
I just find it odd that you see it as "retaliation" when you're the one who started it.
---
I just got 1 of the rewards somehow
---
will play F76 for mischief night 
---
but then I'm out untill this shit is fixed
---
It was 80 in many places
---
Why are you buying overpriced shit like that?  Aspirin is Aspirin.
---
Probs just a lazy way to deal with clipping issues.
---
20 minutes isn‚Äôt a ton of time, but it might be fun to try and rush the start to the Nuka Shine quest, it might be a little hard without at least some starting gear, but if you can get past the enemies in the first area Getting to drink the Nuka Shine and the follow up to what happens after is interesting.  
---
There‚Äôs a reason it‚Äôs fun to put Nuke Shine in the punch bowls for people.
---
Wow silver. Thanks to you, you anonymous legend
---
I use a flamethrower a lot. 
---
I have a vampire faster fire rate. It's a stimpack that kills people. 
---
Just learn some trigger control. You don't slam on the fire button. You tap it and only hit the target with a few rounds.
---
And it works as a silenced stealth weapon too.
---
 So no then. ;)
---
The fridge is basically useless, there is food and drink everywhere. The collectron barely gives you anything and you can collect ten times as much scrap/junk in the time it collects. The scrap box, I admit, might be a game changer, I haven't bought it, so I can't really say. My main criticism is the things that are broken. Atoms are not hard to get just playing the game. So calling it a pay wall isn't really accurate. But I will say, if they continue down the path they've started with private servers, there may be cause for concern.
---
Thank you for destroying gaming and ruining future Fallout titles.
---
More than 20 minutes and people probably won't be interested in watching lol I don't mean the first 20 minutes. Just 20 minutes in general.
---
Wow. That‚Äôs pretty amazing. Thanks.
---
Yup! This is my plan at the moment, unless they add some super juicy stuff for FO1st.
---
I‚Äôm on pc and using a wired controller but it doesn‚Äôt matter because that has nothing to do with it.
---
Because aspirin is *much* cheaper (and less dangerous) than  acetaminophen/paracetamol or ibuprofen.
---
If you want to play together sometime, wich is so much more funny, a friend and i play sometimes per week, we can go explore apalachia, im just not trowing more money at bethesda after the purchase, never buyed atoms too, the game is fine in public servers, im still waiting for waterlanders to see if fo76 will have a future
---
It is true though, because it does crash constantly.
---
The issue is not on my end.
---
Shhhhh! You may upset the community by telling the truth. Lol. 
---
I wish you the best. 
---
Now off to play the Outer Worlds. Lol.
---
How does one join this group?
---
How do you put on flair?
---
So you ignore the fact they said they were going to support all new content with the sale Atoms and that everything after launch WOULD  BE FREE?
---
That‚Äôs fucking hilarious
---
Play pacifist mode only and they wont be able to touch you. Its in the settings and will stop the idiots on here from egging you on and messing with you
---
what? logic?
---
now I wish I could afford this game
---
I'm glad you enjoy your half-assed 'aaa' games that you have to be charged even more to enjoy more add-on half-assed features then.
---
I was already selling Bulk Junk for about 10% base value. I see no reason to change that. 
---
The junk still has value because it takes time to acquire. When you sell Bulk Junk, what you‚Äôre really selling is your time.
---
It‚Äôs slightly stronger then other fist weapons but only if you have legendary version and plan to mod it as unmodded will be weaker, problem with the plans you need to do arktos pharma public event that is difficult and required couple players that know exactly what to do (you need all 3 animals alive to have a chance for good reward). From my experience obtaining those plans after public events update is almost impossible
---
Lots of opinions and not a lot of actual facts in this post
---
You can have the best God roll flamer but that would be the only reason you'd even want to use it in the first place cause like I said they goofed the ammo crafting ratio
---
Lol it‚Äôs no Unstoppable Monster
---
If you can get yourself to about level 5 before you start thE 20 minutes, you can probably crank out the quest then.  The pinnacle is drinking the nuke shine.  I‚Äôll be running it with a new character later, so I can check the time on it.
---
I started it by using my icon and armor? That's a pretty crazy reasoning you got there in my opinion. Nothing about an MMO having a subscription service is "predatory" and I'd argue that those of you who refuse to fund Bethesda and yet want infinite free content all the while attacking those who are funding that very same content are toxic.
---
G‚Äôday, child predator.
---
The collaborators deserve to be hunted.  If they want to play the game, let them hide in their private server.
---
 I have one in my stash. The Meathook I also have, is way stronger. I don't use either, The Combat Knife is the best melee weapon in the game. ;)
---
10% base value is perfect. Should have elaborated more...basically, my goal is to undercut the vendors selling closer to base value to the extent where the perceived value is much lower, not necessarily non-existent.
---
Stellaris is sick! My buddy showed me a couple weeks ago. Plan on getting Outerworlds this week with no reservations.
---
I can totally get behind that dude, sounds like you have a blast.  Thank you for the answer.
---
America spends more on government provided health care than any other 1st world country.  And that health care doesn't even cover the whole population.
---
What they don't want you to know is that socialism is *cheap*.
---
In the real world we discover that private provision of health care wastes *more* money on administrative cost than "socialised" health care,
---
no clue.. I was just throwing out a guess in order to transition to asking why bother bulking shit if youre not right about to sell it
---
Edit: spelling
---
Its not p2w in the way its ment. The game devs (Bethesda in this case) arnt selling weapons and armour to players, thus the game was not made as a p2w.
---
In this case, its the players causing the p2w situation, and this is the case with any game where you can trade/sell/drop items.
---
Also, many dont believe that the fo1st is p2w, the repair packs, ect on the atom store are borderline. The main issue is all the boken promises from Bethesda.
---
Finally, if your paying $100 for an ingame item, it shows high levels of ducebaggery, lazyness and poor life choices imo

Hey mate, it's perfectly reasonable for you to think that people purchasing this service may ruin future fallout titles but I think it's a bit of an over exaggeration that my purchasing of a month of some things in one game would "destroy gaming". That's pretty out landish in my personal opinion but hey man, you do you. Do you have any thoughts on what would make FO1st better? Anything they could do to get you to subscribe?
---
It does not crash for me... how are you so sure it‚Äôs not on your end?
---
The collaborators are just as much of a problem as the company they continue to financially support.
---
you started it by supporting 1st, not wearing the badge of shame. reading comprehension.
---
and Fo76 is hardly a mmo. that's not how it was advertised, anyway. at the very least they went back on their word and that's bad enough.
---
actually private, local servers would cost them nothing, either. yet we got a premium pass instead. I wonder why.
---
I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll have fun with pong then. It‚Äôs got all of its features üòÇ
---
That would be an awesome alternative! I wish we could have tiered subscriptions in that case.
---
Thank you! I'll keep that in mind!
---
Well, no.
---
Just because you're poor you can't expect people to sell you stuff for less.
---
Bump, so I can find easily later. :)
---
This is very well thought out. The scrap box is my issue. That should be a quest or unlockable in some way. It‚Äôs much like putting backpacks behind a pay wall.
---
Well there should be back in forth unless the character on the ps is modded so it could be like a fallout game talk to npc's and not deal with other people
---
Yes it is an opinion, for reddit isn‚Äôt exactly for facts is it let‚Äôs be honest. Can‚Äôt quite remember the last time i saw a reddit post with a Harvard bibliography at the end üòÖ
---
And tldr my opinion is fallout 1st, buy it, don‚Äôt buy it, hate it or love it; but I personally am a bit sick and tired of all the 1st griefing and what is essentially bullying those who have chosen to pay the sub, both in and out of the game.
---
I have thousands. 
---
It's not that hard to hoard if you learn not to slam the fire button constantly. 
---
It's not going to be your main weapon.
---
Well Thankyou! I‚Äôll definitely take that into consideration :)
---
Eh at like $8 a month (what the $100 payment roughly comes out to) like maybe cause I always see outfits and camp stuff I want to buy but never really pull the trigger for atoms so I can get my camp stuff now. Also the unlimited scrap is nice and I have paid for eso plus for the same reason, unlimited crafting storage. Even though I dont craft diddly other than remodeling my camp. Having to decide what scrap to dump always stressed me out so not dealing with that is also cool.
---
I upvoted you, for telling it how it is. Broken! lmao. 
---
What happened to freedom of speech, around here. 
---
I wish you the best.
---
It‚Äôs the final stage in the process, and you can‚Äôt scrap it back down into its original components. It‚Äôs tagged as a scrap item, not a junk item. 
---
Example: Vegetable Starch is a Junk item. 
---
Excessive Adhesive is a Scrap item. 
---
Bulk Adhesive is a Junk item, but it‚Äôs also tagged with a ‚Äòno-auto scrap‚Äô flag.  Months ago this was glitches but they finally fixed it. 
---
Stable Flux is a Scrap item. 
---
So, the Scrap Box is for Scrap, not Junk. You can place Junk in but it will auto-scrap. If it‚Äôs tagged to *not* auto-scrap, it won‚Äôt go in.
---
I hear what you're saying, your friends make the game. A point brought up by CleanPrinceGaming however, you can have fun sitting with your friends outside of a K-Mart too. It shouldn't take that to make a good game.
---
It‚Äôs okay, we got it. Thanks tho!
---
Bethesda (or probably its marketing team) made a bunch of lofty promises at the time, expecting the game to pick up a large player base, where they'd have enough people buying cosmetics through the microtransaction-fueled economy to subsidize development for more free content.
---
Most of the stuff from the premium subscription probably would've been free if this happened. But since it didn't, and the new content being delayed til March next year, they're trying to monetize as much as they can from however many people are still playing to meet whatever internal quota they've set to justify continued development in the future.
---
My plan is to just craft free armor for people (or cheap at higher levels).  I earn XP and they can either wear it or scrap it to learn mods.
---
Glad you enjoy being lied to. We were fucking told everything post launch would be fucking free!
---
"All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76--all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff--is going to be free. That's important. And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand--look there's a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we're going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you're getting for your $60," Hines said. "That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I'm getting that stuff for free. That feels right."

---
When someone says this shit pre-launch, then changes their tune post launch, it can be construed as bait and switch.
---
All you have to do is unfriend them on your account. Kicks them almost immediately. I mean, its shitty having to do that, but it works.
---
It's just a dumb joke: big controversy happens, and lots of posts on this sub defending it or saying game good
---
Lol buncha socialist
---
No, I'm not an Australian.
---
It was fixed a couple of days ago, they had an emergency maintenance (I think it was on Friday). Twitter works best, when they had their down time they had it posted on there and the patch notes following.
---
Because it‚Äôs a common problem for people and I‚Äôve taken the time to test whether it‚Äôs my end or not, despite it being clear that it isn‚Äôt.
---
Look, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre a good guy but please don‚Äôt be one of those people who tries to blame a persons hardware just because it doesn‚Äôt happen to you specifically.
---
The same issue that peeps had with fallout first has now added fustration apon ESO players. As peeps have been takeing to the eso reddit saying there going to boycott eso. Since they thing ESO+ and all content including chapters and dlc's should be free. Like umm WTF.
---
What are we actually 'winning" in FO76 ? Each individual has their own criteria about how to have fun or progress in the game. I bet there are players from launch that have never participated in a SBQ fight. Maybe they're into base building. While some have fought the SBQ lots of times and are level 250 or whatever.
---
No problem! I appreciate the thorough thought you put into this. I was under the impression they stopped the ability to re-spawn WS this way, if it still works this way then I would agree with you.
---
The scrap box would be my main gripe to be honest. Although I will say it isn‚Äôt all that useful to me and won‚Äôt miss it once my 1 and only month is over. The private server is a massive thing for a RP‚Äôer though and this will be missed.
---
[informational resource](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/)
---
It would have less of a performance impact.
---
For sure it was? I thought they said they are still looking for a fix.
---
Thank you. Couldn't agree more. I'm fine with paying at most .27$ A DAY, for the atoms, the outfit, the new emotes, silly icon and yes, my own server, every month!
---
12.99$ a month, you get 1650 atoms. 16.50$. No, 76 hasn't had the most forthcoming release so far. But I seriously view Fallout 1st as fair enough. The Scrapbox bug, seriously, it's Fallout 76, I totally expected SOMETHING to go wrong. üòÇ
---
Roughly .43 cents a day at 12.99$ a month. 
---
Roughly .27 cents a day at 99$ a year.
---
You get 1650(16.50$) atoms a month. 
---
People that purchase atoms for every silly thing released in the shop, can simply go this route. Of course, along with grinding in gane atoms.
---
I think valuing games according to how much time you get out of them vs. money paid is rather useless. You would never be able to find a meaningful average if you've played certain games for a long time like MMOs, and even if you did, how could you possibly apply that to new games that you really enjoy and think are worthwhile but only last 20-30 hours? How can you compare a game you bought on sale for $10 (FO New Vegas Ultimate Edition) vs. a game you like about as much and bought for $80 (FO4)?
---
That said, I've played 76 for probably a few hundred hours, though a lot of that is menu time and building which is just a constrained version of FO4 settlements. So do I think I got my $80 worth?
---
Kind of. Yes because I enjoyed my launch period time overall and what I was able to do with it, I truly like Appalachia and the community seems friendly. No because there were a fair number of bug and performance/DC frustrations along the way; weeks after the game arrived people were buying heavily discounted copies for much less than I paid; and a lot of my initial gusto for the game was based on the idea that it would grow into something great that I could continue to support, and I got that idea from Bethesda themselves and several premises they put forward:
---
1. Cosmetics only
---
2. Free updates with a good roadmap
---
3. Major launch problems would be fixed
---
Promise #1 was broken. Promise #2 is arguably broken or at the least teetering on the edge with the lackluster updates, delayed content, and now a sub gating off better performance and private access to competitive farming areas. Promise #3 is something I think they've tried to keep, so while some key problems from launch are still around (mainly performance issues in certain areas and it seems duping), I don't begrudge them more time.
---
So overall, I'm kind of 'meh' about my experience since launch, and a little irked because I did also pay $75 into the cash shop to give the game a boost, and I feel like they haven't deserved that extra confidence given their recent actions.
---
From here the worth of the game will depend on Bethesda. If they stop with the aggressive monetization and finish fixing the game/adding quality updates, then I will jump back in and I'm sure be happy to contribute more cash support. I appreciate paying money for services but really sometimes I feel like I'm in a dollar store and everything costs ten bucks.
---
If they continue on the path of the last 4-5 months though, I will regard this game as one of the greatest failures I've ever seen from a major studio, and that bad memory will make the money AND time spent feel like a waste.
---
**TLDR: Things get complicated with money and gaming in 2019.**
---
As well as ESO being huge in scope too.
---
Lmao. "I started it" by choosing to spend my money on something I enjoy??? What I do with my money and my character isnt an act if aggression so I'm not starting anything by using the content I bought. That's the toxic mindset I'm talking about. You're off your rocker dude. Anyway, private servers cost money I dont know how on earth you believe they would cost Bethesda "nothing".
---
it seems to be active early, il take it
---
Yea so this just gives big updates. Only one since 1st was released about pictures.
---
I want to know all the small stuff going on with maintenance and such.
---
I‚Äôve been undercutting those ridiculous prices since Vending Machine day one. Unless it‚Äôs actually a rare item, I don‚Äôt sell anything for more than 20% of its base value (well, I do sell Diluted Stimpaks for 4, so I guess that‚Äôs 26.7%, but O may drop that to 3 caps. 
---
Every time I see a Chemistry Workbench plan listed for 350 caps, I shake my head. I sell them for **1 cap** at my shop.

I love the people I've ran into on this game! I typically give low levels most of my aid or ammo if they want it. Sometimes I try FT to low levels but they run away before I can tell them I'm just trying to help! Lol
---
Are all of the locations freshly spawned? That could be big for lead, rare outfits, etc.
---
That is true and can be exploited but I find with my MMO Lite games the publishers for the most part keep a good balance and the game self regulates. If the grind is too high vs the toll road then players tend to leave instead and then you lose all future revenue. 
---
If you keep the grind to toll road ratio in balance you retain the players not wanting to pay since they only grind a little longer than the paying customers and the paying customers don't feel like they have to pay to skip grind, they can always fall back to standard grind because the standard grind isn't that bad, it just requires more playtime.
---
Something like Warframe is a good experience for me. I can pay for boosters (credit boosters, XP boosters, resource drop chance boosters, resource boosters) to reduce grind but I can also fallback to the standard grind if I choose. I usually swap between the 2 depending on my available playtime.
---
Destiny 2 is trying their hand at it as well. The paid for Season Pass gives you access to rewards earlier than the free players but the free players can still get access to the same rewards just later on in the season. You can always choose to not pay the season pass and grind longer for the rewards but the grind isn't 10x worse vs paid so the ratio feels ok.
---
It isn‚Äôt two things because the plastic used to bulk the raw materials is gone. It can‚Äôt be used. Allowing bulked materials would reduce the performance hit servers take from the unlimited scrap.
---
I bulked everything to keep my stash clean.
---
Overrated for sure. I‚Äôve been playing for a while and not close to fallout 4 in my opinion. The dialogue  choices leave a lot to be desired.
---
You on xbox? Come hunt me if you are.

Yeah same lol what I'd do is wave they usually come up then I mean I used to avoid high levels when I was a little noob lol until a high level approached me and gave me a ton of stuff honestly that did get me seeing that happen, felt good to see that all things considered

Yeah, was just getting ready to go. Lol

HillbillyDLUX08
---
Infinate stash space caused by a bug last year didn't  make the game any slower!
---
It is a private world if that matters
---
Cool, just sent you a request
---
Ah, you *almost* had me!  For about ten seconds I thought you were serious!!
---
Wow. That's toxic as fuck. Someone "started it" by enjoying the game the way they want?
---
You could do this in Fallout 4 (or hell even New Vegas or 3) 
---
I get it‚Äôs a meme but the attempts at positivity around this game get exhausting because it encourages Bethesda to do things like their awful 100 dollar subscription service and then saying the community ‚Äúrequested‚Äù more microtransactions to spend money on instead of free usable items
---
No
---
you started it by supporting predatory business practices, which affects us all. I said this a couple posts ago. *reading comprehension*.
---
I'm also not leasing my personal computer to Bethesda. it costs them nothing for me to host my own personal, local server. unless, you course, they wanted to milk players further instead of releasing a feature people have been asking for since before release.
---
you know, something a predatory business would do.
---
Accepted
---
I‚Äôm finding not. 
---
If I have hit say Morgantown high for plastic within the last 36 hours it‚Äôs still empty as usual when I go back. 
---
Stuff that respawned constantly anyway and was first come first serve are now more available, but not a great deal of that was valuable anyway. 
---
Haven‚Äôt noticed any ptw advantages of the server just a nice empty wasteland without floating camps etc all over whitesprings . 
---
Although on the other side of the coin, miss the player vendors when I‚Äôm in private
---
scroll down to the news and patch notes
---
After what I‚Äôve gotten from it, yes all day long I‚Äôm ignoring it. Because nothing in life is free!
---
Can't disprove it, but going well, or poorly would be purely based on the expectations set by Vault Tec, I mean Bethesda.
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt mean that was a good thing, just more bullshit in the pile of stuff they‚Äôve pulled.
---
Can i just say if youre going to write something try and get the facts correct. What was sold in the 1st membership is not a private server. BGS calls them private worlds because they are different than what a private server would be. 
---
Gave you upvotes, don't be mad
---
&gt;your decision to support 1st affects us all whether you like it or not.
---
Yeah, the plot and gameplay are pretty thin as well. It looks great, but there's just not much substance to it.
---
It's showing you as offline
---
Okay?
---
I was doing free repairs on level 20 and under armor pieces &amp; weapons to get the Atom Challenges completed faster. 
---
Still offering it on Pistols and Chest Armor.
---
What's your PSN
---
I'm wondering, what will happen to the items inside the scrap box once the subscription expired and didn't extended it? The private server and tent will just go away, while the atoms will just stay. Probably the emote and ability to craft the costume will be gone too, but crafted costumes will stay where ever they are. I hope Bethesda won't put your scrap box items hostage and give you time to transfer them. Or let you access them but disable the ability to put more things in it until you resubscribe.
---
Mcpoyle82
---
Exactly. They miss too many key dialogue choices that Fallout would have hit, even with New Vegas which makes it odd is this game. But yea even a lot of the characters seem empty. It‚Äôs weird lol
---
Nobody can blame you for feeling that way. Personally, I think the biggest disaster with FO76 was Bethesda‚Äôs horrid PR and marketing strategy. What I mean by that is that if you take FO76 and compare it to Bethesda‚Äôs other in studio titles it‚Äôs absolute garbage. But if you take FO76 and compare it to other online games and/or MMO‚Äôs within the same time frame since release it‚Äôs about on par. For example ESO was complete crap for a solid year or two after release. The problem is that Bethesda tried to market FO76 and promote it like their single player titles for sales and thus the community is comparing it and holding to the same standards as those titles, which is Bethesda‚Äôs fault. It really makes no sense to compare FO76 to any of the other fallout titles or even Skyrim or oblivion etc. because it‚Äôs not even the same type of game in any way and it‚Äôs a fully online title. 
---
However Bethesda or Zenimax decided to market and promote it like it was the next installment in the fallout series for sales and thus raise the bar of expectations and standards people want and expect was raised. If they had been honest and promoted it for what it was and what they realistically expected it to be there would be significantly less backlash and people wouldn‚Äôt be making the comparisons that they are. Nobody for example is mad about the fallout shelter mobile game because nobody expected it to be anything like the other games in the series, they marketed it for exactly what it was. Had they been like; ‚Äúwe are going to make a fallout version of elder scrolls online but using the old engine with more of a first person feel. It‚Äôs going to be vastly different and not part of the single player title series. It‚Äôs going to have teething problems just like ESO did. We are doing this to help fund the studio and give you something to do while we work on our next big single player title.‚Äù Etc. Etc. And everyone knew up front it wasn‚Äôt going to be anything like the other titles in the series and expected the issues up front. The backlash would far, far less. 
---
Because they marketed it as a The next title in the series it drew in a lot of their single player fan base who were unfamiliar with MMO‚Äôs or all Online games who have very different standards than say primarily MMO type gamers. For people who play MMO‚Äôs regularly from launch FO76 is about where they expected it to be right now. For primarily single player gamers, it‚Äôs a dumpster fire.

I've never understood this benchmark. When you go to a movie you ideally expect a good 2 hours of condensed quality content that is the end result of likely millions of dollars and involves great scripts, great actors, great sets, great direction, great photography, etc. etc., just to bring you that 2 hours.
---
In an average video game you spend way more time doing mindless or repetitive tasks, as the big production values are spread across a good 40 to hundreds of hours. Even navigating a UI or running down samey corridors can add hours to your total time played when you spend a lot of time with one title.
---
So I don't know where people get that baseline example of a movie from. It's so whack lol. If you want to create a baseline value for a video game just use a damn video game! :P
---
I think it‚Äôs cool you helping them out... not only cool to do in the wasteland but in real life! Nice job! 
---
You‚Äôre a great example of the types I‚Äôve met and why I‚Äôm still here! Cheers!
---
Yeah this happened to me with the railway, but without concentration, literally 1 metre in front of the enemy, and 7 railway spikes and I just miss with 95% chance each time
---
Weird. Oh well, thanks anyway!
---
Let‚Äôs make it even more pay 2 win. Why not up the XP, legendary enemy spawn rate, *** legendary drop rate and remove the daily scrip cap for all Fallout Worst members? That makes sense.
---
Sorry, I got the witch hat plan if your interested
---
? What would I be in denial about exactly? And uh according to every conceivable metric fallout 76 is not a great game. If you think that then awesome but your opinion doesn't change the reality. And what commitment? The only thing they're committed to is milking players like yourself for every last drop of cash hello? And thanks but I have great understanding and actually knowledge on what it takes to develop games, who are you to tell me I don't lol? 
---
You are a shining example of how sad and pathetic some of these sheep can be.
---
Apparently from what people posted in this thread we keep whatever we unlocked from the atom shop. We can't use private servers or the tent, and we can take and use scrap from the scrap box but can't put any more in it. Hope this helps :)
---
You are right. Need to reword (it‚Äôs 0057 here, can‚Äôt sleep :(). 
---
But point still stands sense dictates that their servers will sustain heavier load if more people play in empty worlds rather than in occupied ones.
---
Ah thanks, i have that though. Happy hunting!
---
What are the rewards???
---
You say "reading comprehension" but then fail to read where I pointed out that Fallout 1st isnt a "predatory business practice"? Keep believing what you want but you're wasting your time because Bethesda will keep doing what it is doing because its economically smart and working. Dont like it? You dont have to play, or you could even play the free content and not buy it.... who would have thought. It's almost like its optional.
---
I'm not the post maker but here's my reason. I hate griefing. I hate people one shoting legendaries in events. I enjoy the solitude of other fallout games. I do like having friends in games, they are not trying to grief or pvp all the time. I'm not a lvl 5 or 600, I have scrounged and got a bit of decent armor and weapons. No god rolls. I'm a very casual player.  Have played them all. Unlike most people I didnt like NV. But I dont hate them because they did. I have never pvp anyone. I will not grief anyone. Solitude allows that my friend. Scrap box, tent, outfit, or atoms didnt matter to me. The fact that I can end the part I dont like was worth it. This is only my opinion, I will get bashed for it I'm sure. Hope this helps you to see it's not for a pay to win for me.
---
Agreed!!!
---
What if fallout first Becomes free after wastelanders and everyone who bought fallout first gets a refund based on their subscription
---
Oh, I guessed everything right. Looks like it is not really bad to try out the subscription once in a while. Probably next month. Thanks
---
But whi says you're objectively right? Its opinionated and attacking a person for their opinion or view rather than making an argument against the vide itself is more like what a Dictator would do. You're basically arguing for an GO76 Gestapo. You're toxic as fuck. Live and let live.
---
I'd say your right, frankly.
---
Only thing is it's all based on personal opinion. What is a $60 game we can all agree was actually of good value? I don't think any sizeable chunk of the FO fan base will 100% agree on which one was best value just in this series. Then of course not all people pay the same. It's too many variables.
---
The movie one is simple(r) because ticket prices at a given theater will be the same for all the films currently showing (choosing to ignore imax/3d variables).
---
Worth is just too subjective.
---
Not to sound like a dick but it's called a scrap bin, not a bulk bin or a junk bin. Plus everything is weightless so why does it matter. You only lose plastic if you bulk and this way weight doesn't matter.
---
Oh boy you're hopeless lmao. 
---
Let me walk you through this with baby steps. 
---
A battlepass is a monetization system that Epic games developed for Fortnite. It was hugely successful and brought in loads of cash. Other big "AAA" studio's saw what epic had done and the cash they were getting and went "hey we can do that too" and now we have battlepasses in all of our "AAA" games. 
---
Now according to you it's literally IMPOSSIBLE that other companies would ever look at the success of fallout 76's sub (should we be damned enough its a success) and go "hey we can do that too" and put it in their games. 
---
Please explain why no other company would add a sub to their game if it's a successful form of monetization.
---
I received help with someone and killed a level 40 glowing wendigo as a level 2 lol
---
For the love of all things holy dont give Bethesda any ideas
---
Oh? Is fallout 76 an MMORPG? Shit when did that happen I missed it??
---
Outworlds isn‚Äôt my kind of game fallout is
---
That is your opinion, not a fact
---
&gt;Fallout 1st isnt a "predatory business practice"
---
except that's blatantly wrong. it's also the sort of mentality that lead to mobile monetization. the fact the EU as a whole is looking into lootboxes should tell you something.
---
but you do you.
---
Yep, and thanks for the offer. I might be a masochist but I‚Äôm going to keep grinding it out. I don‚Äôt have a lot of other things going on in my game now anyway.
---
Good troll attempt üòò
---
They just delayed the free content we were supposed to get (Wastelanders) for months, and now have given us the shitstorm that is Fallout 1st. If they spend any significant amount of time upgrading that sub now (i.e. gating more updates behind it) that will infuriate a lot of people, and I can't say I would blame them. That would be a real shitty move.
---
They have been dropping the ball on the promised free updates for months now. They need to give the general playerbase a significant amount of love over the next little while.
---
Life status: critical.

Just takes patience friend. One enemy at a time. I do solo runs on it. Sure it eats up your time and whatnot but its still doable.

Right on.

Thanks man!

The EU outlawed memes so I'm not exactly looking to them for sound or reasonable policy buddy. Lmao. Try again.
---
Pre-orders are already a thing. Can't get rid of them so purchasing them doesn't do any harm. 
---
However subs in non MMORPG's is not yet currently a thing so players purchasing it does major harm.

---
Yup that was good old Bobby lmao
---
logic? 1st adopters are supporting predatory business practices and sending Bethesda, and the rest of the gaming industry, the message that it's OK to milk players off their last dime. this is not arguable.
---
That‚Äôs fine. I have unlimited ammo, steel, stims, stable flux etc. either play or cry but either way I was spending my money on something game related and would rather spend it on this game then some shitty COD or a horrible game. They can lie all day now if they want from here on out, nobody‚Äôs making you spend anything to play adventure mode.
---
Is there not a huge overpriced MTX shop in the game?

Screw it. You're right. I'll just accept that Bethesda isn't interested in fixing the game. You all seem fine with things so there it is. I'm done holding my breath and being surprised by each new insult. Not worth my time to play whole missions and burn through ammo and stimpacks just to get kicked off the server at LEAST once every day. If you can just sit back and accept that as ok then enjoy the future of gaming. Let studios focus on profit at the expense of quality and it will get worse. This game is becoming a gilded turd. That's my opinion.
---
Refund? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Oh wait, you're serious
---
HAHAAAHAHAHAAHAAAAHAAAHAAAAHAAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
---
No it's a typical person that hates Bethesda like almost everyone here, why do you defend them?
---
So buy the cosmetics and ignore the other crap. Its simple
---
Everything else should be free and no one can say otherwise except Bethesda, since they dictate everything you buy.
---
Only fools who part easily with their money would say money needs to come from non cosmetics.
---
If any game cannot survive w/o selling convenience and pay to win then its likely a game thats shit.
---
Well, then, I jus game 76 the OK to sell convenience w/ that last sentence, did I?
---
If they ditch the entry fee, they can charge w/e they want.
---
MONEY ONLY NEEDS TO COME FROM COSMETICS.
---
And they need to stop selling missing game features. They are selling the rest of the game in that Atom Shop.
---
Shout out to Matty for this one: https://www.youtube.com/user/MrMattyPlays
---
Hope you're enjoying The Outer Worlds (he has some great content on it!)
---
I'm not defending them, I just think one that thinks it's a good idea to ruin someone else's fun just cause they've purchased something with their own money is shitty.
---
Those that are extreamly high leveled seem like they got nothing to do but do 76
---
He said trying to assure the world he was not just a little angry guy who got trolled.
---
why bother? someone who sees no issue with lootboxes or gachas is clearly beyond saving. I'd just be wasting my time because Bethesda can do no wrong and Fo76 is perfect, right?
---
like I said, enjoy your mess. can't wait to be charged 10 cents for every swing I take in TESVI.
---
Nope you are part of the problem. The reason these shady ass game publishers get away with this shit is because of happy go lucky Bucky's like you.
---
Every dollar you feed them makes my games worse by the generation.
---
For shame Sir, for shame
---
Had a few minutes to jump on early this evening. Tried a few servers; maybe eight players on each. Nothing decent in anyone‚Äôs vending (in my never-ending search for stable flux). Meh. 
---
Hopped servers one last time - gotta fix dinner soon. Looked around the map. Five player vendors (six, if you count me). Then I took a look to the southeast... and I see that red circle that makes me oh-so-happy. It‚Äôs a nuke zone. 
---
I throw on my Power Armor, fast travel to Drop Site V9 (just outside the Nuke zone) and immediately engage a Scorchbeast (not legendary, ugh) and a bunch of scorched. The minions drop 3 HRFs (yes!!), the SB gives me some XP and minor loot (wing for Ultracite), and I quickly move through the trees, scooping up raw violet flux. I grab as many as I can, and I fast travel back to my CAMP. 
---
I equip Super Duper and start crafting. I have 30 raw flux and enough material to craft 3 stable violet flux, but I need 4 to craft Shielded BOS Underarmor. But Super Duper is kind to me, and I get my 4 stable violet!! Yes!!
---
Now, if just had the damn shielded BOS plan from all those ‚ÄúForbidden Knowledge‚Äù runs!!
---
Fallout 76 Disgusted me away so I guess the short answer is it is hard to come back to a game like fo76 after playing a better game like Outer Worlds. Fallout 76 does have some things going for it, but my fun factor with Outer Worlds has been consistently higher while Fallout 76 never matched my first couple multiplayer sessions during BETA (before the flaws already evident sunk in). 
---
To be fair they are different genres, Outer Worlds is a solo RPG heavy on dialogue and character. Fallout 76 is a survival game light on most other things, and some suspicious balance and grinding issues. 
---
I have not completed either game but to answer some questions:
---
Less buggy than fo76, do not really consider it like fo76 more like dragon age origin (emphasis on companion chatter) and older fallouts.
---
Most features are easy to engage in, there is a lot of text to read to see the full depth though.
---
The game feels feature complete what I have played so far. It is a complete game at launch with a story.
---
Not so much emphasis on scavving, extremely simple compared to fallout 76, this I would consider a win in general for fallout 76 if it did not have so many poor decisions in its scrapping/crafting game.
---
Inventory is streamlined with automatic junk marking, ez sell buttons, information icons everywhere that tell you a decent amount at a glance. Much prefer inventory in Outer Worlds over the poor net code clunkfest of fo76.
---
76 is a more open world, more crafting complexity and focus, multiplayer.
---
Outer worlds is the superior RPG, actually cares about its gamers instead of treating them like cattle wallets. Better story, dialogue, environments, quest design, and character development (meaning your character actually feels different as you vary the builds). It is closer to the old fallouts than 76.
---
Fallout 76 could do most of those things, maybe it could be second best at story/dialogue ad you need the writers, but if it made the effort it could at least show in the contest and boost their appeal. The worst part of Fallout 76 is it worries about extracting all it can from your wallet and little else, obvious from day one and just getting worse. If they just built a better less corporate committee game they would be rolling in money, but they jumped on the bandwagon with activision/ea/ubisoft to rent seek their games into tedium.
---
Fallout 76 is tedious, always was even when I tried my best to support it. Some of it is by deliberate design to save or steal dollars and it is sickening.
---
Gunplay feels funner, less bullet sponge and because it is solo it can bring back bullet time VATS (unfair comparison to live multiplayer which simply should not do that). Half the weapons in fo76 felt broken and reduced to a two or three gun meta.
---
Have not beat Outer Worlds my enjoyment level is right around the other fallout entries, I still am nostalgic for fo1 and fo2. But i also have more content to get thru so it can rise up the ranks.
---
Sorry what happened to all the money from the MTX store? The one Bethesda were bragging about all their money from?
---
Can anyone confirm? Im ready to jump on now and earn as many as possible before the event kicks off tomorrow and I gotta farm that üòÇ
---
Sorry tell that to my gigantic video game and console collection lmaooo what a stupid thing to say haha
---
Rich people or wealthy are so stupid w/ money they part ways with it so easily and go bankrupt.
---
I meant heavy yeah. I couldn't think of the name and was to bothered to check.
---
They did? This is the first non MMORPG to try to implement a sub fee? Hello?
---
‚ÄúYou should hate this thing because I hate this thing.‚Äù

how is that a similarity?

I heard it's against the agreement but not too sure.

Is that the only reward right now?

Okay thank you, that‚Äôs very kind of you

With the number of issues and future add-ons they are planning to add, then adding ways to monetize the game. It is easy to guess that the team badly need money for resources. Electricity, equipment, labor, and facilities are not free, so I think it is better to support them than to waste everything they worked on. And this is really great, being able to play a Fallout 3/4-like game without turning it into a one-click hack-n-slash game like what happened to The Elder Scroll: Online game, on a huge map. Minecraft, PUBG, and Fortnite are still struggling on enabling players to go around anywhere in a big map. In time, this game will become polished and a lot better compared to what it is now. And hopefully the next TES game with online multiplayer would be able to use what the devs learned from this one, from both success and mistakes.
---
I started the community during the darkest time in my life. I desperately needed someone to talk to, felt so alone in the world. The game kept me going, but the friendships i made and this love for the community saved my life. Im not ashamed to admit it. Good people are out there. Pkoa brings them together.
---
Okay word
---
Yea! 9 years to be exact...
---
If it's like the other rewards, the next one will pop up after you get the first, and so on until you get them all
---
"Former players &amp; trolls came out in mass to harass players who made this game great" god complex

Oh yes sir these are amazing

Businesses are literally designed and operated to hopefully make money. The employees also receive a paycheck as well as new people hired.

Quad explosive tesla

They gonna needs that money to feed that addiction.
---
Others gonna need that money to eat, watch TV, buy other games, etc.

All the things that are worth doing more than playing 76.
---
You either buy 76's garbage or you use that money for better things.
---
Always other more worthwhile expenses not worth stopping for 76 :3
---
Played Outer World's most of the weekend, got bored late Sunday, came back to 76 and have been playing 76 every chance I can this week so far. May pick up Outer World's again on the weekend
---
Aw man your a PS4 courier , but maybe we will cross paths in a discussion on there some time.
---
I just equipped the bats assault rifle skin, on XB. Unlocked at 250 xp.
---
They get dogged because many of us are tired of users who can not control themselves keep buying the drug from the dealer. Why should I blame Bethesda when its the players who buy buy this crap's fault. We would all have unlimited storage if it was not for those players. You think Bethesda just sits around thinking lets limit storage just for the hell of it? They did it because they know the idiots will buy it. If this would stop they would not bother trying to come up with these schemes. So not only do those players screw themselves out of money, they screw everyone else. Bethesda sets the web trap and the flies start flying in. Idiots. The only way to solve this is to government involved. I hate that idea but players and community are ruining game for other players. Its about time congress in the U.S. starts going after the gambling loot boxes and the addicts who keep buying this crap giving them advantages.
---
Authority arguments like that do not challenge any opinion.
---
This first month should been a free trial period! Then charge reduced the 2nd month after that fully overpriced.
---
Same thing happens to whenever I'm preoccupied fight scorchbeast with its minions near a fissure. When I fall inside the fissure and die, I have no idea how to fetch my items. LOL

I always thought it was longer üòÖ. You can see what little gaming time I‚Äôm getting of late.

True. I definitely didn‚Äôt think of that way.
---
Yeah I know I paid $60 for the game
---
Thank you üíÄ we have ascended!
---
I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through that man, no ones deserves to be alone, I‚Äôm glad things worked out and now you have a massive community, that‚Äôs impressive and you should be proud of that, bringing people together.
---
This is also true tho üòÇ this is why I don‚Äôt get involved lol
---
Expensive or not, there are far better offerings elsewhere.
---
They can say "you call this expensive and you are paying for xbox game pass", but then you can say "cause it's actually worth the asking price, in fact, it's a bloody steal or it feels that way".
---
Just like most of us or more from the beginning...

You don't understand how online games work do you?

Compared to all the hate and trashing posts like this one that you felt was important to post...lol
---
It's a feature.
---
Your username and password are also stored in plain text in memory, persistent throughout game play. I've submitted this vulnerability multiple times via their bug reporting forum, as have others. Those reports have not only been ignored without response; mine have been deleted/removed from their bug forum.
---
It gets worse - using the same information you detailed above, it's trivial to brute force most user passwords without even opening the game by sending packets directly to that destination. Bethesda maintains a publicly accessible, easily scrap-able, list of usernames at [bethesda.net/community/user](https://bethesda.net/community/user/)/yourlogin. Even if you change your display name, their forum keeps your original login ID in the URL. There's no option for two factor authentication, no lockout/timeout for incorrect attempts, and no additional verification required if logging in from a new location / IP address.
---
As for next steps - I've submitted a CVE request and am happy to send you details once that's been assigned if you'd like to add to the submission.
---
So you have money to spend on a premium subscription but not to buy a new game?
---
I couldn't of said it better myself and if  I knew how to give a silver or gold you would have it my friend.
---
The game features are in the Atom shop
---
By making more posts that calls them out even if it‚Äôs the simplest mistake like grammar.
---
Wish I could have the same experience, but because of huge language barrier, everyone prefer to stay mute and avoid interaction.
---
Hoping that reply was only for the G'day part
---
The tantrums are subsiding when they realized it isn't the end of the world. And the majority of people who don't play the game but complained will move onto the next out rage to farm more karma from it.
---
Out rage culture at it's best
---
Im humbled by them. Thats why its not just a community or a faction with lore...its a real family üíù
---
When is it being delayed until? Time to just go play Outer Worlds
---
I don't think anybody here does tbh
---
Back when Skyrim was singleplayer someone managed to recreate it with a mod to play multiplayer, before eso of course.
---
I was assuming you were English.
---
Only 25 hours? Im in for about that now and I don't feel like I'm nearly done yet
---
White wood laminateüòÇüòÇüòÇ

You don't get it.
---
Bethesda should release their server software so we can host it ourselves.
---
Just go play Fallout 4 my goodness smhüòÇ
---
I mean, people doing what they've allegedly been doing to people that bought 1st is just asking for a ban wave in my opinion. Expect that before them talking.
---
Moved junk from 4 alts to main and everything has been fine for me since the fix
---
It's definitely personal opinion, yea.
---
And hell, I didn't even think of Netflix. I pay about $14 a month and I get hundreds of hours of content in that month if I want. That makes theater prices look insane and is equivalent to what I get from games I play all the time that are sub but F2P.
---
The movie ticket model is seriously flawed. xD
---
Dont talk about, be about it
---
Anyone seen the second one? I got the first but there is no second one.
---
And don't worry all opinions are respected and won't be judged by me as I enjoy both games.. but I can't help you from others
---
If that's the attitidue, I should go buy Fallout First and destroy all of gaming for Lord Bethesda. Fight the crusaders!
---
Why doesn‚Äôt it seem to disconnect all the time for anyone I play with on Xbox?
---
Yeah that might be it, i play some multiplayer stuff but i am definitely not the most avid multiplayer gamer.
---
I think it was also a huge mistake that they tried to make a game that would work for people that prefer multiplayer and people who prefer single player. I think they made both groups unhappy with that. The single player people were annoyed by a lot of the multiplayer aspects of the game ... and the multiplayer people were annoyed by all the compromises that were made so that the game would also be attractive to single player people.
---
The problem with people buying Fallout First is that regardless of what they're actual thoughts are about the subscription or Bethesda in general, they are telling Bethesda to lock more content behind more and more expensive paywalls. 
---
Look at how negative the reactions were to the previous non-cosmetic microtransactions Bethesda sold to people. It was super clear that most people didn't want them in the game, but because a minority of people bought a ton of the, Bethesda was able to then say that the community "clearly" wants more of them and that Bethesda will now be adding more p2w microtransactions in the future, starting with Fallout First.
---
That's why people are hating those who are buying Fallout First. It doesn't matter if you think its overpriced or that Bethesda shouldn't be doing it at all if you still end up buying it in the end. Because with every purchase of Fallout First, the more Bethesda is encouraged to lock more features behind expensive paywalls.
---
So someone bought you a copy of a game because your a..... What's another word for idiot....
---
That‚Äôs amazing üëåüèº
---
I was going to upvote this but it‚Äôs at 76 upvotes and I did t want to be the one to ruin this.
---
Thanks
---
Some do. They just twist or try to redefine stuff to fit what they want.
---
illegal no, it could go against the EULA or ToS but really how would they know?
---
I'm sure Bethesda will add it when they figure out how many atoms they should cost
---
Have you tried crying about it more?
---
Awe man thatd be cool if we could get a plan for a sheepsquatch assultron head
---
Try hovering over player dot on map... sometimes friends list or recent doesn‚Äôt work.
---
Careful.... the snow would probably be bugged and kill whoever it touches....
---
Tried friends list recent player on map rejoinng but no luck
---
Thank you, and ahain thank you for your post!! It was a ray of sunshine today!
---
I don't have access to the game rn could you explain how they work?
---
I'm enjoying it for the same reasons I wanted a fallout 4 co op mod with my mates. This works for us
---
All of that gameplay has no point, though.  500 hours of figuring out what scrap/weapons to drop to make weight so that you can freely roam aimlessly with no clear objective is not a FUN 500 hours.  Its bored timesink hours.  I LOVE the concept of the game, I hate the lack of meaningful content that they have given us.  When they decided to delay the only worthwhile content that was promised, the scrap box and tent should have been a free peace offering for those who were willing to stick around while they fixed a broken ass game.
---
&gt; This will mean only a fraction of the mods we enjoy for Fallout 4
---
Yes, but there are mods that have no equivalents and then there are mods that everyone seems to have the same idea for and graphical mods are very much the latter. I don't know how it'll be for Fallout 76's lighting system but with past games getting darker nights is as easy as modifying the ambient light settings.
---
Maybe you should try this in r/outerworlds
---
Going to stick with fallout and boarderlands for a couple more months then probably start that. Pretty excited for it. Little I've seen looks good.
---
No worries, btw what was your community called ?
---
Ofc it's not hard to hoard if it's not your main weapon, but your argument of it's fine if you tap the mouse is a pretty weak excuse for the lack of ammo crafting it's pretty simple
---
All gaming has no point. It‚Äôs an entertainment medium. Each person decides whats entertaining to them. You aren‚Äôt curing cancer when you play league or overwatch for 100 hours.
---
You don‚Äôt get to decide whats fun for other people, and if you played 500 hours while not having fun that was your decision. A weird decision. Call of duty bores me to tears but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs inherently a boring game.
---
Edit: Personally I‚Äôm more bummed about the player mastery thing being bumped back. I‚Äôve never understood the obsession with NPC‚Äôs blabbering the same scripted lines. I have no idea how it‚Äôs any different from listening to a recording. It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre some special AI. They‚Äôre walking tapes.
---
Everything should be free. I don't understand why people cry about this shit so much. It's a MMO. 8t has a subscription to give you useful features, much like every other MMO. I can't play ESO without the crafting bag anymore.
---
To me they are two different genres so it's no different for me. 76 is an online looter shooter and The Outer Worlds is a single player RPG.
---
I enjoy both for different reasons, just like any other game. Be that RDR2, WWE 2K, Outer Worlds and so on.
---
Everyone who disagrees with me is a paid shill! Back to the behavior set for the bots after the launch I see, how original. What's next, is fithycasuals a sub full of nothing but bots?
---
Or maybe nobody cares anymore. Because it‚Äôs not a big deal.
---
You want to protest it, want to show Bethesda you don‚Äôt want the subscription to exist? Don‚Äôt buy it. Instead of screaming like children.
---
This sub has never been about praising Todd. People have complimented the game when things are good and criticized the game in spikes at times like this, but most of the posts during non-controversial times are chill gamer stuff, suggestions, questions, and requests.
---
I have a lot of problems with the recent Bethesda actions and have been sharply critical, but this type of post is pure shit disturbing or paranoia IMO.
---
Also available on PC's Gamepass!
---
Agreed. Absolutely what they should have done
---
Thank god. If I wanted a ‚ÄúBethesda bad Obsidian good upvotes on the left‚Äù circlejerk I‚Äôd just go to r/gaming and r/Fallout.
---
big facts
---
Lmao yeah for just 1100 atoms they'll start selling different pipboy lighting.
---
As much as I hate fo1st and as much as I don't understand why people keep being doormats. This does warm my heart, I remember being that level 27 and chilling on top of the green buses getting my tags. I could go on but I really appreciate folks like you
---
Cause Bethesda bad Obsidian good upvotes on the left New Vegas is the **ONLY** good fallout
---
So, there‚Äôs no player that might disagree with you and be enjoying their Fallout 76 experience completely?  That‚Äôs not within the realm of possibility, in your opinion?
---
PKOA the Peacekeepers of Appalachia.
---
It's still a multi-player online rpg even if it's not massively so.
---
I'll take "Name of your mom's sex tape" for 200, Alex.
---
Nice. I wish the community could design assets for 76 (in-game).
---
I quit because of this. Project paradise was my go to and they fucked it up.
---
I have 10.000+ hours in Elder Scrolls Online. I think you are good m8 no worry. People have their reasons.
---
TOW appears to be fun, albeit a little linear. But it's different enough that I'm not spending all my time comparing it to 76 or FO3 all the time. The opponents cries when you do a stealth attack with a hammer at their legs cracks me up, 'Ahhh, I can't feel my legs!' The holo-shroud doohickey  is interesting. The companions interacting with each other is good.
---
I wish someone would buy me outerworlds, people are mean to me all the time shouldn‚Äôt I get something too?
---
I see them as two different styles of games
---
* Fallout 76 is a Open World survival game with RPG elements
---
* Outer Worlds is a RPG but lacks the true open world nature of Fallout 76, or even previous Fallout games.  
---
I haven't tried Outer Worlds yet, since it won't be available for steam for a year, unless I decide to just give in and get it for PS4.  I've heard that outer worlds is "short" in comparison with it being "only" 40 hours to complete all content.
---
Same for me. I want the option to play with a couple of friends, but love the option to play on my own. I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôve struggled to find a place in the wider community...I don‚Äôt care for PVP, I don‚Äôt farm legendaries, I don‚Äôt level quickly, I don‚Äôt worry about my build, I don‚Äôt go hang around nuke zones/Whitesprings/etc, I don‚Äôt enjoy many of the public events. I felt like I was sort of drifting aimlessly around and getting in the way of high level players, and I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do with myself. Playing solo or only playing with friends really takes care of that, IMO.
---
I don‚Äôt think you took away the point of this post bubbers
---
Keep digging. That hole isn't deep enough yet.
---
^^^This guys is a full time shill.
---
2nd one hasnt triggered for me yet, after clearing the 250
---
You mean more than one person on the same account?
---
There was one in the Atom Shop for a while, but I believe it's gone now.
---
Feel better now?
---
&gt; It was super clear that most people didn't want them in the game
---
Was it?  I could have sworn pretty much every CAMP I visited that week had a Collectron in front of it.
---
 Yeah. And how do you compete with a PR/Shill department of a corporation.
---
What‚Äôs histrionics
---
Guvment gonna have to pry mah scrapbox from my cold dead fangers.
---
KEEP BUYING SHITTY GAMES!!
---
it's being able to switch out for different perks and being able to use different perks in different situations, but for the most part sticking with the build there if surprise, I meet someone and they just want to punch so I just beat them senseless until they get bored. I heard dodgy ain't worth the trouble because it eats 30 ap for each hit you take no damage on and action boy's effect is negligible, as long I'm able to make a dash out for one reason or another I'd trade some quality of life for survival. weapon artisan and fix it good I'd just switch in and out of to make repairs on duplicates and switch between that and the most useful everyday perk in intelligence and a melee weapon is a lot easier to find, use, and keep running than an explosive one. scrapper is more than considerable because I like grabbing literally everything and breaking it down. with that infinite scrap storage and forward camp that's something to generally keep more often. Far as serendipity and ricochet it's the chance of each that I consider the downfall, if heavy weapons are better for grounding an everyday scorchbeast it's considerable. thinking about it dead man sprinting and field surgeon'd be good, and a bloodied melee build would benefit from almost half of every hit just not registering with serendipity so it's something to keep on lock when I find one.
---
Oh boy. Just how slippery is that slope your building? Try and do one where the world ends because of my ranger armor.
---
lol... better than a full time troll like you with nothing better to than to be toxic on Reddit...lol eat a Snickers...

He doesn‚Äôt want it he is choosing to go play a new free game instead
---
All fair statements

I don't think it's illegal but I'm 99% sure it's against tos
---
These posts just get crazier and crazier.
---
You ever pre-order a game that turns out to be total shit? The lists from the past 5 years speaks for itself. 
---
NOBODY raised an eyebrow when ESO launched a $15 subscription on top of the base game being $60 on top of the dlc's being $20-$40 each. That shit's been out for years and very popular.
---
Oh but when 76 offers more at a cheaper price then all of a sudden that's the line. You're whole shit makes ZERO since like where you been???
---
His point wasn‚Äôt that they do the same thing but rather that studios can run a decent game with a sustainable business model without harming their own game experience.
---
You need to have sex, now.
---
But it protects your from airborne hazards and doesn‚Äôt have the -perception!!
---
&gt; Because with every purchase of Fallout First, the more Bethesda is encouraged to lock more features behind expensive paywalls.
---
Everyone is pointing towards Fallout First like it's the first sign that things are heading down this path, but the real troublemaker is the Creation Club which has been with us now for more than two years. If we wanted to stop this from happening we should have had far more backlash for that, but now that it's successfully moving content Bethesda has all the evidence and motivation they need.
---
I was at that point at lvl 70 lol. Done everything so I started pvping and trading
---
You don't get "unlimited storage" with 1st, "fool."
---
And even if you did, it doesn't have anything to do with loot boxes.  What you receive from 1st is clearly spelled out.  There's no random element at all.
---
Sounds stupid but make sure the friend isn‚Äôt already on a team.
---
Yep. Same with me, the only thing that kept me playing was farming for perfect rolls and trading/pvp
---
Cry some more. 
---
Edit: I apologize for my statement, as I realize that it may have come off as rude. What I meant to say is that I‚Äôm sorry that I can afford to skip McDonald‚Äôs once or twice a month to purchase Fallout 1st, which I have been enjoying, with the money that I worked hard for.

For me fallout is that switch off game. It's definitely not my main (that would be rainbow six and Apex legends) but if none of my friends are on or I'm just really tilted at r6 then I'll hop on fo76
---
Some of us actually love the game and don‚Äôt get paid to say so. I mean Beth if you want to pay me slide into my dms but as of right now I am just expressing my honest opinion.
---
I love this game.
---
I think Bethesda is ultimately responsible and base criticism should be directed at them. But I also think criticizing posts that support the changes is fair game; if you present an argument I disagree with I will probably counterpoint accordingly.
---
Taking it in-game would be a no-no though, as well as harassing people for talking about the sub or whatever. I think it's true that folks who buy the sub are supporting something I see as a negative, but in a similar sense, I don't expect vegans to harass me for supporting factory farming by buying meat, or pro-lifers to harass me for supporting pro-choice by voting a certain way.
---
I suppose the basic 'don't be a dick' rule is a good one. Though it's the internet so it's easy to slip.
---
Was just me and them are you on just now ? Could invte and see just going to be on like half an hour to try get some legendery see if team works
---
[Everyone appreciates that]
---
Absolutely nobody cares that you were ‚ÄúoNe Of ThE fIrSt,‚Äù this completely ruined whatever the rest of what the post was gonna say
---
I have been.  Thats why up until about march or april of this year, i trusted bethesda to make good on the fisaco that fo76 had become. Oblivion, fo3, fo:nv, fo4, skyrim, doom, wet, quake, brink, rage dishonored, wolfenstein, prey.  Bought those and loved them.  That why i trusted bethesda and bought fo76 on launch day, and why is stuck around when they promised to get things fixed.
---
The problem is that they didnt make good on that promise.  To this day, the game is still a buggy mess and to take features that should have been around since day 1 (unlimited storage and private servers)  and stick them behind a monthly fee is just a colossal slap in the face.
---
Big facts
---
As long as they ain't scamming then get it how you get it
---
Sorry sadly I am at work :(
---
It is a very good game but (so far) it's 98% dialogue button clicking and 2% shooting guns at things.
---
Yup lol
---
Yes. Too late for Survival, though.
---
Yes, officer? This post right here
---
I can't tell if this is satire or insanity. Well done!
---
Ah mo worries man fell free to join if you wish if im on private for lag free not to play alone GT KUSHTY M3CH
---
What!?
---
As much as 76 or 51 seem to be the closest, I kinda wanna think he ended up in 79, the one apparently opening up during Wastelanders.
---
Only $16 a month for the privilege
---
*ahem* You deserved it.
---
Have no idea where you are getting the idea but no coding will make decade old hardware run latest games smoothly. I know you love your console but Jesus Christ man this is common sense. Stop defending consoles and have Sony come up with better cpus and gpus on their next machine. Can't believe you are not standing up to these practices while you are so quick to condemn Bethesda when they fuck something up
---
Mcdoubles are almost 2 dollars now too. I'd like the same refund and free burger.
---
And canvas bags for all!
---
This sub needs some positivity! Glad you shared :)
---
Wouldnt happen. People are blaming bethesda, its probally not 100% there fault
---
In the first month I went crazy cooking foods and trying to memorize when it was appropriate to eat each kind of meal.
---
Then they patched the game so food spoiled in like, 10 minutes of play. I switched to canned dog food and I never carry more than 10 cans.
---
I've not done any cooking ever since - almost 8 months now. Cooking in Fallout 76 is the most pointless, unrewarding aspect of this game. They absolutely broke it to the point where it's a waste of time and materials to use this skill/feature.
---
There's a perk card that doubles the effectiveness of canned dog food, too. That and 10 cans is ALL the food you will ever need.
---
Yeah, while I'm not much of a fan of how Betheseda handled Fallout 1st, this is a really blatant slippery slope fallacy.
---
Pretty sure the flood of nukes would have warmed the atmosphere with all the sunlight getting trapped by dust particles, and there wouldn‚Äôt be snow, at least as far south as WV
---
max two handed melee and automatic rifle damage, could save 6 points in strength and perception for other perks at the expense of 30% less damage with just the first rank in each of those damage perks. That you've born survivor it puts more weight to it being more useful than I'd think. Class Freak and Starched Genes maxed out of course, I'm curious if general damage reduction is more useful than increased damage resistance but any reason to use points elsewhere is good.
---
And if they ever do expand the map they can say it's the radiation dying down over time
---
Your opinion is everyone's opinion. Stop farming karma dude. This game is fucked up and this subreddit must be deleted.
---
You entitled bastard!
---
&gt;  she had the most beautiful voice I‚Äôve ever heard,
---
most moms do.
---
You won't be able to store your junks and that's it. You won't lose anything. At least that's what they said but won't be surprised if junks actually disappear.
---
So you're suggesting... what... that they delayed releasing the PTS in favor of Fallout 1st because... shits and giggles?  If they haven't released it yet that means it isn't ready to be released yet.  Why the fuck is everything a conspiracy theory with people here?  That Bethesda is purposefully withholding updates just because they love fucking negative PR?
---
Looks like only the first reward is live
---
Are you high? MMORPG's are games.
---
How is it different? Because its "massively" multiplayer? It's the exact same practice. Sell a game, charge a subscription fee for access to the game that you've purchased.
---
The only difference is that players associate MMO's with a subscription fee, and as such its completely fine and okay. But heavens forbid a game that doesnt market itself as an MMORPG dare to charge a subscription fee!
---
Outrageous!
---
Maybe the people speaking out against it just gave up and left. I'm getting there myself. Haven't logged into the game in about a week.    I'm not boycotting. I genuinely wish I could enjoy it again.  It's just so hard after this for some reason.  I wish I could just look the other way and pay my 13 bucks a month like everyone else. But I can't bring myself to do it.
---
great shoutout. /r/FO76 is where I come to drop my soapbox and bark at the moon.
---
/r/fo76filthycasuals is where I go to get some hugs after Im spent
---
I want to point this out that THIS game succeeded because the community it was really intended for enjoy it.  Companies do shitty things but the designers built it to appeal to fall out sympathetic players and it does bugs and all.
---
&gt;. . . is release PTS instead of the subscription
---
Are you saying they *still* don't have a test realm?
---
Bethesda, honey, put down the phone and look out the window.  See WoW over there?  See how she's doing it?  She's been doing it for 15 years.  You could learn something about how to run an MP game from her.
---
No, there is no law against that, so it can't be illegal.
---
I've put a lot of hours into all of these games (most into NV) and I agree with you, it'd be ideal to have all of these things in the original purchase of the game. I don't feel that I need to defend the subscription at all. I don't need to defend a multimillion dollar corporation. I just don't see it as this big deal that everyone seems to make it out to be. The slippery slope argument has been used in the past and seems to be the case but here's the thing, I enjoy the game, I enjoy the universe it's set in so I'll buy into it solely based on the fact that I enjoy it. Do I wish there was a persistent single player or co-op sort of play in the game? 100% yes. Should it have been there from the start? I guess but the game seems like it would have released over a year later if it did. Which I'd be fine with but I'm happy to have also gotten the game earlier. Although it should've been a whole lot cheaper at launch for the condition it shipped it.
---
Reminds me of a post here around month 3 or 4 where some guy said he had gone to work, so he rolled up a character for his girlfriend to play and when he got home, she had done nothing but wander around and pick blackberries to sell. He sat down and showed her all the things you could do in the game and then went to take a shower.
---
When he came back, she was happily roaming the forest picking blackberries.
---
I paid for a one month and will let it lapse/cancel it to check what happens. I think a few others have said they‚Äôll do the same.
---
Surely nobody actually fucking used that, right? Nexus mods exist for free
---
Wah
---
It's a separate container from what I've seen in person. So either you dont have access to it at all anymore, or maybe it let's you take stuff out but not add. 
---
 
---
Some people have already had issues with it deleting your junk.
---
I'd like to think that they're just testing the functionality of the scrap box and tent and plan to release them publicly with wastelanders, but I know better by now.
---
Brilliant! üòÜ
---
Right? This product was never intended to be ‚Äúmodded.‚Äù
---
Unless they have to answer to someone higher up... (cough) Zenimax (cough)
---
Nice- Xbox player? I play with a player faction if you are above 18 come on over haha
---
Cause all game issues get fixed in the first week after launch...
---
The point for junk is general "realism".  No one should need that much junk and being able to hoard it all takes away from what is supposed to be a core game play loop of actually going out to scavenger shit when you need it.
---
There's two problems here, first that a vocal chunk of this playerbase is so far up it's ass that they still believe that the scavenging mechanic exists purely to punish them and "create a problem" and second that bethesda was even stupid enough to add uncapped storage at all.  It's not a perk that should be up for paid access, it's a perk that shouldn't exist for anyone.
---
Yea im on xbox got 2 characters one 106 one 32
---
Nah.
---
(This guy is saying you get to pay $16/mo to be stepped on, stop downvoting)
---
That and mods for single player games are Ok or at least tolerated to a degree by developers because it doesn't effect anyone but themselves.  For online play it can mess with game balance and makes future updates impossible to balance because who knows what modders will release.
---
xoxox r/nevillegoddard
---
That'd be oh so perfect but yeah, I doubt that they care about us to that degree lol
---
Wut
---
Some people prefer that, it's RPG heavy because that's what they aimed for. Some people were upset about the story differences between FNV and FO4/FO76.
---
"Don‚Äôt agree? Don‚Äôt care. I like the stupid subscription thing."
---
It's funny but this is what it comes down to. I really hope Bethesda does better but if they had doubled the camp budget and lowered the price I'd have bought it while still criticizing. I'm quite comfortable pointing out problems and asking others and myself to do better while still participating to whatever degree seems right, because if I didn't think that way I would have killed myself long ago. :-p
---
Just age over 18 matters- DM me if you want to join a player faction. Super active lots of queen runs and super friendly people. We use discord
---
Gives me notice on what not to do and not lose my shit
---
I kind of see where he was trying to go with that point, but counter-point:
---
Surely a multiplayer game (or any other group activity) is **always** dependent on the quality of the people you play with? Without good friends/players, any multiplayer game will become dull and unfulfilling to play
---
I would say no.  Because they can't just stitch a new map on and call it good.
---
They would have to replace the whole map for any additions.  And then you would have to download the whole map + additions again.
---
For stories like this and many more that go untold Is why I rage gauge on people when I hear people bashing this game or any game that has a friendly and caring community . I don't like most major sports but when I see the families with smiles and enjoying their time with friends and loved ones either at a game or at home Its very uplifting. FO76 has its problems but lack of a great community of players isn't one of them.
---
That‚Äôs some strong language if all you wanted to do was politely discuss, lol. So what about when Pete Hines said that there was never going to be a season pass nor content that wasn‚Äôt free after launch? And I don‚Äôt know how you can argue that the Scrapbox doesn‚Äôt offer a pretty significant in game advantage. I don‚Äôt know how you could be certain it stops with the Scrapbox either if you show by buying it there‚Äôs demand for advantages in game like that.
---
It has nothing to  do with gambling, but clear promises made by a head of marketing before people purchased the game. Also known as bait and switch. Also known as false and misleading advertising/marketing.
---
Same here. I'm trying to pack as much junk into my little box as I can, hoping I get to keep it all.
---
He‚Äôs you
---
Remember, ONLY the good parts.  Or they'll ban you.
---
Even non-rate junk will still sell.   Especially to those that have plenty of caps and would rather just buy 20 Bulk Adhesive than spend their time crafting it themselves. 
---
You‚Äôre not just selling the junk. You‚Äôre selling a convenience. A time saver. 
---
People in the real world will pay twice as much for a gallon of milk at the convenience store than the grocery store... because it‚Äôs convenient.
---
Are you for real?
---
I really don't think modding should be allowed. It just should not happen on an online game.
---
Oh yea im 22 lol its 2am over great brains nor working right
---
I don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre going or what jobs you‚Äôre taking, but your comment is not true in my experience.
---
you make good points my guy. all i see from Fucking YouTube entertainers like Jim Sterling makes Bethesda look like a villain in a batman cartoon, always scheming away. so your more logical, levelheaded answer to why Bethesda is moving down this specific path makes a hell of a'lot more sense then Big Pharma game developer wanting to ruin the franchise with refrigerators and Repair kits!
---
Haha  true :)  9 pm here but the faction is all over on time zones
---
Not to mention the fridge is inferior in every regard to the Good with Salt perk, which essentially makes food last forever. 95% &gt; 50%
---
The duration is much shorter and you lose the invis effect when you attack.
---
I don't think the duration is a big deal in adventure mode but making the effect end when you attack would be the main thing that I'd love to see.
---
You do realize you look like a 1 year old with a chocolate bar after kissing their ass so intimately. Hope that stain around your lips is worth it.
---
Sounds good
---
Depends on the color. Seen red ones go for more than max caps. Others not as much
---
Dunno about the paddleball, but you can get the commie whacker from liberators in the forest. I've gotten 2, and found the bladed whacker plan.
---
If people actually spent as much time playing Outer Worlds as they spent telling other people they're playing Outer Worlds they'd probably be done playing Outer Worlds by now.
---
Yep.
---
Yep, [here are the images](https://imgur.com/a/DJ1OC8D) for it from the shop.
---
Fallout what?
---
You bought fallout first then came to the forums to complain about it? Are you made of stupid? Everyone on reddit already hates fallout first
---
Don't forget the better looking ncr ranger armor mod,revolver,and rifle
---
Cool post, thanks for buying. 
---
-Bethesda
---
Not in my good Christian game!
---
Level 23, 25 plus hours, and that‚Äôs mostly side missions.
---
Then just quit the game. Lemme know if you wanna drop all your items before you quit if you're on PC
---
I've finished the first location and most of the 2nd (spaceship place) and it's a lot of talking in this game.
---
There's a filthy casuals subreddit for a reason.  If you want to cover your ears and ignore the problem, there's a place for that.
---
Afaik, rarest are red and most common are brown or green or something. All hats and the white, dirty, and white weathered uniforms are common
---
If i could build things that actually persist through servers that would be worth it. They should even let us change the damage of weapons and settings such as removing legendary effects shit like that. Doesn't require external assets just literally changing things that are already in the game. Obviously youd need to start a new character but it could change the game a lot
---
Noice
---
You ain't wrong my friend. What do you think of FO1st though? Anything they could do to improve it in your opinion?
---
Oh man that's gnarlyyyy
---
Lol all they way through my private server with my god rolls and many many friends doing the same. Keep getting but hurt over a video game company lying to you while we enjoy our game play. Say what you want but I‚Äôm not alone, your crying about a game like a 7 year old not getting what they want.
---
There's no point in soloing the event unless you just want to fight a bullet sponge 3 star legendary at the end.  All of the actual non-lab coat rewards are locked behind getting a perfect run.
---
I wait 4 years minimum
---
Sounds like it‚Äôs just not worth it for you since you don‚Äôt enjoy it, and that‚Äôs absolutely perfectly ok!   Games are supposed to be fun.  
---
Take a break from this subreddit for a while, play something else, and maybe come back to FO 76 after Wastelanders drops in 2020.  
---
I‚Äôm serious.
---
Peace üëç
---
It is literally impossible to be this stupid. Since when is a new form of monetization automatically "bad"?
---
Remember these things that used to **NOT** be a current form of game monetization and are all staples now?
---
- Pre-order exclusives
---
- Early Access
---
- Free 2 Play with a cash shop
---
- DLC/Expansions (in general)
---
- Race Changes
---
- Server Changes
---
- "Catch up mechanics"
---
Games have **LONG SINCE IMPLEMENTED SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR OPTIONAL SERVICES**. The battle pass system is something that was implemented and **HAS STUCK AROUND BECAUSE GAMERS ENJOY THE SYSTEM**. It would have died long ago if it wasn't popular.
---
Fallout 1st is no different. There is no competitive advantage to be offered for the service. Literally none. It's a **couple** QoL changes and a fancy skin.
---
Again to reference Black Desert - they have an **optional** subscription that is Pay 2 Win. It gives you enhanced carrying weight (allowing you to farm more silver + gear) increases the experience you gain (so you level up faster) mitigates the loss on sales on the marketplace by about 30% (meaning if two players have identical sales, the one with the sub will make 30% more) and a slew of other advantages.
---
The nature of Black Desert is to PvP, and these features directly convert into a Pay 2 Win advantage. **AND ASIDE FROM CLASSIC WOW, BDO HAS THE MOST ACTIVE PLAYERBASE IN AN MMO RIGHT NOW**.
---
**ALL** Bethesda has done is introduce a subscription service for completely optional QoL adjustments in a game that has **ZERO** "win" status. Your overreaction (and the thousands of other overreaction) is absurd and you should be ashamed of it.
---
Your entire post is nothing but a rambling fit of rage-filled vitriol that is terribly misinformed and horrifically misplaced. You're either a fucking casual who is completely unaware how far the gaming space has changed in the last decade or you're a man-child who is upset because you don't understand what exactly is being offered with this service.
---
Neither one is good.
---
a quote from Todd Howard at e3 2018: 
---
‚ÄúOur goal for launch‚Äìthis is really new for us‚Äìis: have a well-running, robust service and then, some period later‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre currently still designing what that service looks like, you‚Äôll be able to have your own private world, **and be able to mod it**, and do all of that. We think, with our games, that‚Äôs where the long-term life of them really is. That is trickier when you get into an online world but **we‚Äôre definitely committed to that, just won‚Äôt be at launch.**‚Äù
---
It's fair to say that this product was always intended to be modded.
---
Oh and I have 3 builds over 250, I‚Äôve gotten more then my $100 out of this game.
---
I'm not trying to be rude but I gues you just need to keep looking for a better spot. Or downsize and become a nomad, I've been thinking about it.
---
I did the exact same thing. I have a whole group of friends I can't normally play with. Lobbies are normally filled up. So now I can help them. 
---
It's your money, you spent it how you wanted. Good on you.
---
No fucking way, PVP would just come down to who has the better aimbot (VATS)
---
Keep bragging and you look more and more like a spoiled brat kid.
---
The servers would crash more.
---
Might as well
---
This just in: Angry POS yells at innocent post.
---
I'm loving my sub.
---
Does anyone's disagreement with the subscription service diminish your enjoyment of it? I would hope not. It sounds like you're taking it as a personal attack though and feel some reason to explain it. Good for you.
---
What if I‚Äôm a girl
---
The whole damn game is a Vault-tech experiment.

Thanks Juice! Im in love with it already for sure, what a legend the both of ya! üôèüèªüçª
---
Modding is already  mostly dead. Haven't you used the mods from nexusmods.com? The best fallout 76 mods like the damage meter have stopped working because the mod makers no longer care to make updates for a dead game.  I don't think official mods will ever be good but since when have people cared about the mods being "official"? Nexusmods has tons of free unofficial 76 mods and as far as I know (been playing 1900 hours with mods). Bethesda doesn't ban people for using mods.
---
Yes, I have at least 1k hours in eso, 3 max leveled characters, and still find things I never noticed, quests ive never seen, item sets ive never heard of every playthrough.
---
I'm a level 100+ melee build. I pretty much drop ammo and power cores to anyone
---
Oh hey I know that guys channel
---
You're comparing Netflix and Spotify to a fucking video game.  Netflix has almost 140 million subscribers and spotify has over 200 million.  No shit their subscriptions are lower, the entire point of their business model is to have so many subscribers that they can offer services at lower prices while still making out due to pure volume.
---
It‚Äôs $13 and you get:
---
1. Access to private worlds
---
2. Scrapbox
---
3. Portable free to place camp that doubles as a second free fast travel point
---
4. Subscription exclusive outfits and emotes
---
5. As well as the subs price worth in atoms
---
They‚Äôre not exactly stealing from you and you know what you‚Äôre paying for up front. I‚Äôve also definitely spent more on other games for less I.e. BDO, DCUO, skyforge, list goes on
---
Nope
---
Just go with whatever you want. Full set doesn't really do much in pve it's barely noticeable. It's so mediocre I went back to wearing excavator PA
---
The 3 dots at the top of the home subreddit page, one option should be change user flair.
---
Hey i know its been a few days and i just pissed away my card as well, if you are on pc i am down to try and grind it out.
---
Definitely not ‚Äúcommon place.‚Äù Most of the time the games themselves let you set up privately hosted worlds that are locally run with limitations. The ones that charge for servers are typically 3rd party websites that are running their systems so that you can basically run a full game server without limitations that come with privately hosted games(also they typically allow you full reign of said server so you can run any mods or rules you want). Ark is a perfect example, I can go in for free and start a realm or I could pay a company $3.50 a month to rent a server for me and my friends. Minecraft, same deal (plus realms which is sort of what Bethesda tried to setup but actually working and not horrendously broken).
---
Those winks.. are u messing around, I cannot tell
---
If you want to get angry, there are tons of posts about F1st where you can be angry. This posts isn't one of them so let people be positive for once...
---
At the very least junk and the stash should be separate. It isn't fun to balance guns with duct tape
---
i have only been using Barbarian  because it seems to significantly improve my overall Stats. 350 + jumps up to 420 +
---
I have noticed without the Perk,Ghoul Slaps can be deadly.
---
Never really thought about using Blocker.I didn't even know it had such an impact until you just told me.
---
Going to have a look at this..
---
Thanks.
---
\[Strong hated that\]
---
Just about every video, article, subreddit, forum, or any online discussion about the p2w microtransactions had people mainly complaining about it.
---
I totally agree, the community is awesome
---
Not here.
---
How is all of Appalachia being surrounded by a Glowing Sea worth of rads LESS immersion breaking exactly?  When Wastelanders eventually comes out you'd expect that all of the returning settlers decided to cross an irradiated death zone?
---
People who play the game: helpful, casual, generally just chill and enjoy a game they can find a way to enjoy 
---
People who don‚Äôt even play the game on reddit or YouTube: ‚Äúfallout 76 bad, people who like bad, outer worlds good, I intellectual, other people not‚Äù
---
Nobody care about you people who "dont like the hate" people like you are the one who spread the idea of just getting over it. Bethesda's has messed up bad and need to know it, LagacykillHD always tells it how it is while juice head is annoyingly slow to anger but even he is upset.
---
They both have said that if people just get angry for a week and then get over it nothing will change . So yeah there should be hate as much hate as we can get.
---
Yeah I agree. But people wanted dialog rich rpg gameplay.
---
I wonder how many blackberries she sold
---
So fallout 1sts become the root of NCR rangers and non 1sts become commonwealth super mutants
---
To be fair those, alt characters only need to reach lv 50,from there it inherits all 810 levels! It's learning their rotation and finding suitable gear.
---
You've never been to nexusmods.com have you? There are already dozens of unofficial fallout 76 mods and they are already starting to die off because the mod makers don't play anymore. I would kill to get the damage meter working again.
---

---
Worry not, with Fallout 1st there's twice the chance someone will block your camp! =D
---
Poopy lol
---
I love it already - I'll love it even more over there :)
---
No just no to your entire apologists argument.
---
Project Paradise needs an overhaul. It's near impossible to be done.
---
When does the event end?
---
You could say that but super mutants are Pre war as well I was just thinking everyone in the Appalachia dies in the second coming of the nuclear bombs and we don‚Äôt hear about it in other games
---
EA wouldn't try to get rid of the loot box label if that was the case, but I agree there's plenty of misinformation about terminology among internet "punditry" and policymakers alike, and Maplestory's model is rather egregious.
---
You are absolutely right that P2W used to require a set of conditions like PVP, F2P to apply, but as the lines between genres become blurry, so does their terminology, and in that case, P2W can imply but a competitive advantage (survival tent).
---
I don't like the F1st subscription, but I completely understand why others could like it. And I also believe that we shouldn't judge others for what games they play and for what they purchase (as long as it's legal). We may no like microtransactions or (borderlinde P2W) subscriptions, but that's only our opinion. These things aren't universally bad. So whenever someone is "enabling" these decisions, then they are free to do so... because they aren't enabling a universally bad thing. People who want to dictate others what to buy or not are worse than Bethesda. Because Bethesda at least *pretends* to care about us....
---
Yeah Warframe is pretty good. Not a fan of the weird pay or wait stuff, but for the most part they do it right. Haven't played GW2 in a long while.
---
Balancing guns and duct tape is simple.  You can't go to your garden and pick the ingredients for a legendary rifle, you can pick ingredients to make adhesive.  People still can't accept that you don't NEED to keep a huge stockpile of materials when they're all over the place if you just go and look.
---
Unfortunately you will always have dumb people who post stuff like why all the hate and that we should get over it. These people are the enmey. We get over it and Bethesda's will do the same shit over again. Watch LegacykillHD.
---
You'll need some spices along with that salt to make a delicious Wasteland souffle !
---
Fools part easily with their money.
---
&gt; the Robotic dance emote is fucking hilarious. That alone is worth a hundred bucks.
---
Not even the Fortnite community is this stupid.
---
Nothing is free... faster you understand that the better.  You must be a dem... free free free... give me free stuff...
---
Yup and entire year worth of junk gone!
---
The NCR rangers have their own lore I‚Äôm pretty sure. This is something totally separate then the other games
---
People complain at full force and then dwindle, every time.  
---
If your first instinct is to blame it on PR accounts, you're simply conspiratorial and ignorant.
---
People give their two cents and then bugger off.  It's not a  subscription service :P
---
Well they didn't deviate on rolling out the sub model.  They obviously found the resources to push that out the door, but yet push Wastelanders into first quarter 2020.  So, their priority was obviously to try to generate some cash by coming up with a sub model that is almost all fluff.  Ranger outfit.  An icon. A few emotes, and an unlimited stash of junk.  Not really much meat there.  If this doesn't kill off the remainder of the population, then they had best make Wastelanders uber bad to the bone goodness, and find a way to make the sub worth it.
---
People may have reasons but you sure don't have a life.
---
Damn, I'm on Xbox
---
Dude don't quote someone who steals gameplay and doesn't even play games in general (well he started but definitely not his first 2 years or so) 
---
He's right but wow he's not a creditable source
---
I'm waiting to get FO1st but this is my plan. Farm enough lead to supply my Action Hero with .50 but also to help others as well.
---
There is still some light in all the darkness.
---
 You read too much into it. I am not upset about the madness but I think its really stupid, so I try to soften my disdain, with a wink.
---
Well we can make them into something... how about ghouls then?
---
Yeah, I spent hours alone in the first area. You can rush this game and probably beat it in 25 but I don't feel that's the correct way to play this game.
---
Bless, I hadn't even noticed that Outer Worlds was on gamepass. Thanks for the heads up
---
I would not call a refrigerator that sounds good on paper, but really isn't all that great a game balance breaker.  I also would not call a robot that collects a little bit of junk game breaking.  I can collect way more than he can in the same time period.  It's just a nice to have thing.  Neither one should have required real money to buy.  Maybe just make the plan a rare drop.  I'm starting to get bitter at Bethesda.  I was fine with them, then boom.
---
üôÑ
---
Do you really think you could get a ball pit without every ball counting towards your camp budget?
---
Ghouls would be a good idea maybe a small number survived and became ghouls and we can talk to them in Fallout Five
---
Because you are making a statement to Bethesda whether or not you like it, and regardless of what comes out of your mouth, by paying them you are saying "yes please keep treating us like monkeys".
---
another word for idiot? I've got it, its u/BatmanHatesSuperman
---
As long as it pisses you off
---
Someone came up to me over the weekend and did the dance.  I was so amused, I stopped what I was doing just to make sure I watched it all the way through (and rewarded them with appropriate heart emotes!).
---
That is the most "Windowless White Van" title I've ever seen.
---
Only if they had a functional animation of my character sitting on it reading a random one of the magazines they found to go with it.
---
Sadly, I have to agree.
---
Same with the sunglasses, and any other facial item in the Atom shop.
---
You‚Äôre right. What about people who can‚Äôt afford the game? Give them that too for free. I mean where does it end lol just stop ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
&gt; TLDR: anyone who purchased or purchases or just vocally supports Fallout 1st is actively harming the game, the franchise, the developer, the future games and every single one of us. 
---
Bullshit. That is just one opinion. If I don't like sports games, am I right when I say that purchasing sports games hurts every single one of us too? I guess not. Not liking certain kind of monetisation is just an OPINION. You aren't better than other just because you think one means of monetisation is bad and should be punished. On the contrary - when trying to judge what others are buying, you are reveling yourself as an asshole.
---
This is an ugly can of worms. Basically "ends justify the means". Imagine when people start digging into what you do and purchase in your life? What if people started giving you grief for using too much car, buying wrong kind of bread, buying electronics made in chinese factories or simply for eating meat? There are tons of ways where assholes can jump onto your life and try to force you to change it for the "greater good". Don't be one of them. Especially here where there's no greater good...
---
Around here the Kmarts look like they belong in Fallout! Not interested in breaking and entering to see if the insides do too though..
---
I get what he's talking about, though.
---
Guess we‚Äôll see if it ever actually happens. 
---
It‚Äôs all speculation with nothing ever being confirmed. One speculation is that it would benefit the entire server population, not just the owner. 
---
But until it‚Äôs in the game (and not just in the files), you‚Äôre grasping at straws.
---
A majority of what‚Äôs in Fallout 1st should be free. It amazes me that everytime we ask for stuff, Bethesda makes us pay for it.
---
Literally the opposite, but okay.
---
Istaria?  Ryzom?
---
No it shouldn‚Äôt be lol they have a right to charge for it if it keeps the game alive. I bet most people complaining don‚Äôt even buy atoms smh lolüòÇ
---
If you can't appreciate someone realizing the wrong they did and changing it for the better what's the point in criticism of any kind.
---
This game lacking an offline, or even local mode of play has always been one of the primary reasons modding will be dead.  I don't believe for a moment Bethesda is incapable of adding such a thing, but it's pretty clear they're looking at options that provide them money rather than appeasing community-requested features.
---
Unfortunately I think Bethesda's longterm plan is to create their own ecosystem of subscribers and "community" mod content that is limited to Bethesda's approval.  Think like the Creation Club.
---
So, not only would modding be potentially limited to subscribers with private servers for anything significant, but we may not even see the amount of variety you do with Fallout 3/NV or Fallout 4 modding when it finally does happen.  And who knows if they'll try the same thing where you can pay for some mod content as well.
---
Spoken like someone who hasn't had their camp blocked by a survival tent.
---
Separate issue. That promise was broken a long time ago with the Unstoppables costumes.
---
So we just gonna' act like there wasn't an influx of survivor players who came to adventure mode and "griefed" people? alright then
---
Well....
---
Ask on r/ClassicWoW if Retail is worth it and wait for the shitshow.
---
Maybe it‚Äôd be okay if it worked
---
And comparing Fo76 to other games that have no entry fee seems disingenuous
---
&gt; introduce the idea of the scrapbox with the excuse of testing server stability with unlimited scrap
---
Can we stop with this stupid argument? Unlimited scrap is not something the server can't handle. 
---
How do you think the servers handles the data of scrap? It's storing one by one the texture, the price, the scrap, the type of it, etc of each scrap for each unit of that scrap? 
---
No it's just like a simple joint with the  ID of the scrap along with a number saying : you've got 10 unit of this scrap.
---
It won't impact server performance. And if it manages to impact its performance, I'm awfully scared of what the fuck Bethesda is doing.
---
There are numerous online games that have private servers with mods. Look up steam workshop for Conan Exiles to see a good example of how it should be done. Not to mention that we were told there would be private servers with mods. That is.. the whole point of OP's post to discuss how fallout 1st will negatively impact this feature.
---
It‚Äôs called free market
---
He also said x16 the detail.
---
Try having her play in 3rd person.  I only play in 3rd and have no issues.
---
Oh geez, now you sound like a fanboy. This is not an argument of defending Sony or Bethesda or even PC. F76 is based on a decade old engine but that's not an issue. All of this is irrelevant honestly and you're going way out of topic.
---
The point is the game crashes shitloads on PS4 and Bethesda needs to fix it. Thats called a software bug incase you havent even heard of it living in your cave.
---
We can talk when you actually have a PS4. Right now you sound like a fat dude giving bodybuilding advice. We all know how that looks cause you sound clueless AF.
---
See ya.
---
so, some flair for the flare gun?
---
Eh, that feels more like an accurate description of Disco Elysium.
---
Almost everything in the atom shop is overpriced.  I laugh out loud in real life at their prices.
---
Because he's not an actual gamer. He striaght skimmed article and read the top post on Reddit then throws together videos with stolen gameplay to make a buck on YouTube. I feel the same about those videos that are legitimately reading off top post from stuff like "that happened" and other subs
---
You seem to have already formed an opinion based on the negative hype. I fell victim to the same and avoided the game for the first 6 months. Then ESO made the mistake of telling me about the Bethesda E3 twitch stream. I watched it, I saw them start talking about fo76 and saw the trailer which I looked way better than I expected based on all the bullshit I'd heard. They happen to be offering a free weekend so I tried it. I loved it, I bought it.  I cancelled my ESO subscription and I've been playing fo76 daily ever since. I will never listen to the opinion of entitled little mitches on social media ever again. Just like all these people crying about FO1st. I subscribed on day one because it is almost identical to the subscription I had in ESO. I have absolutely zero regrets. The game runs great for me but I play on a PC that's probably a little higher end than most consoles so maybe they do have issues worth complaining about but I don't see them in my game.
---
I saw someone offering 60K 5.56 ammo for a red outfit yesterday. 
---
This game is messed up, yo.
---
if you want maximize damage __specifically from the posion__ you want fast firing weapons(10mm smg, minigun, .50) or multi hit/shot (shotguns, harpoon w/flichette). the more hits the more stacks.
---
as far as leg. effects, the extra hit from two shot, and the extra hit from explosive also trigger it
---
the damage itself is quite weak depending on the mob though.
---
On your private server you can for an additional.88 cents

Source patch notes update 14 :  **(NW) New Limited Time Rewards:** Unlock six limited-time  Halloween themed cosmetic rewards by completing Nuclear Winter  Challenges from October 29 ‚Äì November 12.
---
Ok, so infinite scrap weight that we asked for should be behind a $100 paywall, and the private servers themselves should have been cheaper. Supporting this only leads to one place‚Ä¶I warned people about Bethesda‚Äôs actions if they support Creation Club. And now look pay to play the game less buggy and with content the community wanted. I won‚Äôt be surprised if at some point it only gets worse. If my warning gets rejected again and I‚Äôm right‚Ä¶well I won‚Äôt have any words at that point. Go ahead and support bad decisions and blocking content that should be free behind a $100 paywall.

After the games I've been playing recently, it's a nice change.
---
Yeah, it most likely would but it's definitely a lot more labor intensive. If you find an MP3 that was actually ripped from the game somewhere post a link here. I think it would be funny as a ringtone myself (or a good alarm tone to wake up to in the morning)
---
if only i can be level 359 someday
---
:-p
---
level 8 here soon to be 9 lol
---
Amazing. Can't say I'm getting the same results.
---
Player Camps should auto bounce fire bases.
---
Doesn't the game track the last 200-somethings you looted and repopulate after it gets pushed off the list or x amount of time passes? I've been trying to understand how, when and why items respawn. Did I get that part right?
---
It's not a separate issue. It's a case study to present to governments to regulate developers/publishers. Not to  mention the deception, manipulation, and shilling  online. Something needs done about that, big time.
---
I think Fallout 3 fences the world in and New Vegas mountains the world in.
---
as if that would matter to them anyway, regardless of what you suggest the first thing they'll think about is how much Atoms they're gonna make us pay for it
---
Yea it should be. No way servers could handle for everyone. And as you can see people don‚Äôt mind supporting a game they like. How many atoms have you bought? I‚Äôm sure cosmetic only mico transactions is something you support right?
---
I first started to see talk of P2W in... I don't know, maybe SWTOR? But the first time I saw it firsthand was Neverwinter, and it was bad. People could buy gear straight from the store and that seemed to perfectly fit the definition because people were using it in PVP. So P2W was paying for direct power against other players.
---
However, that's changed over time as gameplay mechanics change and games hybridize. Hard to pin it down now.
---
In 76's case, I think in a PVE context it's not as bad because it's not allowing real money to potentially win a skill test. That said, I'm a big proponent of respecting player psychology and immersion when it comes to RPG games, so I think that once publishers start to sell microtransactions of any kind they are lowering the quality of the game experience, P2W or not. It doesn't bother me in a jealous sense if some guy buys advantages, but it makes the 'laws and narratives' of the game seem all the more a lie. I don't think devs should introduce real world considerations-- ESPECIALLY important ones like money-- into the gaming experience.
---
I 100% support developers creating and selling DLC content packs and expansions. But I'm strongly against P2W or 'advantage' micros of any kind, and only tolerant of cosmetics because otherwise I just wouldn't be able to game anymore.
---
Agreed, hoping with some complaints they may fix that.  At least when a base blocks me I can typically use their workbenches...survival tents just hurt other players in public world for the most part
---
You can‚Äôt fathom that people actually still enjoy the game? I mean, i‚Äôm not a fan of the 1st subscription either, but you don‚Äôt see me claiming that anyone enjoying it is a secret BGS employee. Not everyone thinks the way you do, my friend.
---
yeah to give us more rads then we already have......
---
Report to upper manglement - We nailed down and polished off everything needed to add infinite junk storage, and probably STASH storage following in the future. This will be one of the most exciting and welcomed changes to the game, players have been demanding unlimited stash or at least unlimited junk storage since launch.
---
Upper Manglement($_$t) - This is fantastic news! We want you to roll that out IMMEDIATELY! in the next planned update with a few changes.  
---
Wrap up and finish the subscription we never directly told you to work on, but have been talking about adding in *our* meetings. It‚Äôs going in the next update. It‚Äôll be [terrible]great! Players will love the content and benefits added.
---
Add that infinite junk storage to the subscription. It‚Äôll drive players to it like crazy! Maybe toss some atoms in there, be creative! !  
---
Turn the survival servers and some of the NW server into adventure servers. Lock them to subscription/1st player invite-only and we‚Äôll call them private servers.  
---
You guys are smart, you‚Äôll figure it out! Remember all content has a price! Don‚Äôt add more than $80 worth of content in this subscription. Infinite junk is worth what? Like $40? Private servers what like $15? And $10 worth of atoms. Yeah, you‚Äôll figure out the rest, remember the limit!
---
They‚Äôre not cosmetic-only. They used to be, but not anymore
---
And how many have offical servers that they allow mods?
---
Then you've got a more interesting story to tell.
---
Lol I rest my case lol you want everything free. Must be nice living in the twilight zone üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇsmh
---
It's pretty hard to imagine a better example of the pathetic fanboy than someone who pays a subscription fee to a game the developers have never given a shit about.  
---
You're the same type of person that donates to make whichever Jenner a billionaire.
---
Very impressive! Now jump :-)
---
That seems to be the way it's going to work. I spoke to a guy who does exactly that with his ESO subscription (which is what this subscription appears to be based on). He subscribes for 1 month, loads up all his crafting stuff in their version of The scrap box and then doesn't subscribe again until he needs the space.
---
I drop whatever I can spare both weapon, aid and ammo wise, if I'm at my CAMP I'll build them a couple guns and melee with some aid and drop them a bunch of ammo usually in the thousands as i hoard ammo lol 
---
as for my build i think I'm more guns but i do use melee as well
---
Let‚Äôs take these one at a time...
---
‚ÄúHow are the comparisons to 76?‚Äù
---
The comparisons make some valid points, but the games are very different. It‚Äôs a bit of an apples and oranges situation. Outer Worlds is certainly a better choice if one is looking for a single player RPG, but that‚Äôs not what 76 is at all, so it‚Äôs not entirely fair to compare the two, despite comparisons being tempting and inevitable. One is not a replacement for the other. Players who enjoy one, will generally enjoy the other as well. 
---
‚ÄúHow many bugs compared to 76?‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm have about 16 hours in OW between PC and XBox One combined. I have seen one very minor bug. So, it embarrasses 76 in that regard. 
---
‚ÄúHow convenient are the features/systems compared to 76?‚Äù
---
This is a hard one to interpret, but I‚Äôll try. There are zero ‚ÄúInconvenience‚Äù mechanics in OW. (Funny how that happens when there‚Äôs no shop in which to sell you ways around them) Aside from carry weight, which is managed with little more than a passing thought, there‚Äôs nothing that slows you down or pulls you out of the gameplay. Junk items provide slight world building elements, but are really only used to sell. There‚Äôs no scrap or stash management. 
---
One thing they did that I really liked is their weapon/armor repair system. First, the condition affects performance, so you have a reason to fix your gear. Second, you can break down any weapon or armor and simply get weapon/armor parts, which are used to repair any other weapon or armor. If for some reason you don‚Äôt have any repair parts, you can use vendors to repair your stuff for Bits instead (in game currency) It keeps it really simple, there‚Äôs zero grinding for anything. Nothing feels like work. 
---
‚ÄúCan you even look back at 76?‚Äù
---
Yes. OW is a shorter game with a defined end point. It will certainly provide lots of replay value, but it‚Äôs not a replacement for an ongoing live service game. Just a nice break while we wait for new content. 
---
‚ÄúDoes the game feel feature complete?‚Äù
---
Yes, I think so. It‚Äôs feature scope is more limited, as it‚Äôs nature is more limited, but what‚Äôs there is definitely complete. 
---
‚ÄúHow‚Äôs scavenging?‚Äù
---
While you can hunt for loot‚Äîammo, aid, junk items etc‚Äîthe game doesn‚Äôt center on that. It‚Äôs not post-apocalyptic, the world is vibrant and it‚Äôs society is functional. Scavenging isn‚Äôt really a thing you would do. 
---
‚ÄúHow‚Äôs scrap management?‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs not a thing in OW, which is refreshing. I‚Äôm not a fan of tedium and inventory management simulators.
---
‚ÄúWhat does 76 do better?‚Äù
---
76 has a world that feels like you can live in it. OW has a great world, but it‚Äôs not the same. Bethesda excels at this and always has, so no surprise. 
---
‚ÄúWhat does Outer Worlds do better?‚Äù
---
Dialogue, characters, player choice and consequence. Wastelanders may change that, but as of now 76 offers little to none of that. Obsidian excels at this, so again it‚Äôs no surprise. 
---
‚ÄúDoes Outer Worlds make it easier to leave 76 or appreciate the NPC update coming soon? (Or harder to wait for that update?)‚Äù
---
If anyone says they‚Äôre leaving 76 for OW, then they‚Äôre just leaving 76. OW isn‚Äôt the kind of game you‚Äôre going to play daily for a year. It‚Äôs not a live service, it‚Äôs not online, it‚Äôs a single experience‚Äîan excellent one, but one that you will likely revisit occasionally as time goes on.
---
It does however set a very high bar for Wastelanders. That update will immediately draw comparisons to OW and if its characters, dialogue, choices and consequences don‚Äôt measure up, it will feel extremely disappointing for anyone who‚Äôs played OW. 
---
‚ÄúHow is the gunplay compared to 76 and VATS in old FO games?‚Äù
---
Both are a bit clunky, but ultimately passable. 76 is probably more realistic while OW is easier to handle. VATS vs TTD (OW)...76 and OW make these mechanics more fun than in older games. They‚Äôre real time (though OW slows time) so they don‚Äôt feel like they pull you out of the action. 
---
VATS in 76, while fun, is quite buggy. TTD seems to be bug free. In 76 VATS simply targets limbs, while in OW, TTD allows you to target limbs and provides different effects when hitting them for different creatures. One other difference is that TTD still requires manual targeting, it shows you what you‚Äôre going to hit, but you control it completely, rather than it being an ‚Äúauto-aim‚Äù kind of thing. 
---
Another note here: Outer Worlds (at least for the first two worlds you visit) isn‚Äôt really an action packed game. If you want tons of enemies flying at you and a sense of imminent danger, you‚Äôll be disappointed with OW. There‚Äôs action to be found, but it‚Äôs not as intense as 76 or even Fallout 4 can be. The focus is on the story and dialogue choices, not combat. 
---
‚ÄúIs Outer Worlds better than all Fallout games or do you feel it‚Äôs only better than 76?‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs not better or worse, it‚Äôs different. It‚Äôs a great game and enjoying it doesn‚Äôt mean that I love Fallout any less.
---
Before or after wastelanders? We will see.
---
Naturally!
---
I‚Äôm not asking for everything for free, my point is that not everything in the Atomic Shop is cosmetic. I‚Äôd be fine with cosmetic-only items, but alas that‚Äôs no longer the case.
---

Dont buy this piece of shit, the game itself is a 4/10 and anyone left playing ether doesn't care that they are played to and rob by Bethesda or is a apologist. The game will continue to get worse  with a good thing happing for every 5 bad. Go buy the outer worlds it's at least 7.5/10 game.

I've downloaded the outer world's &amp; haven't tried it yet, doesn't it only give you 30 to 40 hours gameplay? I've spent about 1400 in 76, so although I will play the outer world's, it can never be a replacement if the gameplay is so short.
---
Alright listen up, mate, is this post about Fallout 1st? No so take your damn negativity somewhere else
---
I still play the game not for the damn subscription but for the GAME and the community around it, sure, I paid for it but only a month to test it out for myself, I do believe Scrap box and Tent should've been free for everyone (it better happen)

The game is still good if anything I'd have already left if it wasn't for the community

Or enjoy both.  Sometimes taking a break from one game is nice.  Enjoy the world, not just one city.

Honestly, this kind of elitism makes other people who bought 1st for fun look bad. no wonder why this subreddit gets so much hate. disregard if I fell for a troll post
---
Is just a poor borderlands copy imo.
---
you like many others are why the gaming industry is failing, I don't care how your using it it's the fact that you support it in the first place that's not an argument that's a fact which automatically makes this comment valid no matter what you think.
---
Based on the post with you saying things like "It's just a game" I can't take whatever you say seriously you no longer have a opinion.
---
No I‚Äôm saying the overall increase of monitized information has increased all over different platforms whether you realize it or not. 
---
Now there is more of it so literally nothing new at all. 
---
Bethesda and a game or others isn‚Äôt that high at all by comparison.
---
 Its cute, but the bullet sponges, pointless guns and generally poor combat, is not attractive.
---
Lol, is making an RPG game the easy route?? Hell, the Outer Wilds is easily a better RPG than Bethesda's Fallout games. If you like Bethesda's Fallout games then that's ok, but they're more shooter than RPG. 
---
Also, there's a whole lot more to 76 other than a shoddy engine and incompetence.
---
thanks Todd

no i too like the game despite its major issues ;-) ;-) im just giving a hard time to that one post whos saying Bethesda PR is at it again ;-)

Yet here you are... in FO76 subreddit... ex‚Äôs are literally less salty...

My main concern is: how much will this affect the base game in terms of stuff purposely being left out and included with the subscription service to pushed everyone towards subscribing?  Also, one of the main reasons we requested private servers were for the mods.  I highly doubt the private servers will be modable *sp*  Definitely not when it is going to affect the atomic shop.

I'll give it a go, but it will be finished in a week
---
I got a non-legendary one up to about 800 listed damage. But, comparing a Junkie's puncturing one to a Junkie's puncturing Power Fist the Power Fist does significantly more damage.
---
For me it is more about how neat it is to kill enemies (especially Yao Guis) with a modded bear head on your arm. FFS, it even growls when you punch at enemies with it.
---
Sorry I don't own ps4. I just can't stand sub 30fps :)
---
I personally will never buy any subscription to this game for multiple reasons... but to shun somebody who does? That's absurd. 
---
Your spending money on something you enjoy. It's not like you're donating to the Nazi party or buying slaves. Let people play video games and use their money how they want as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else. 
---
You do you. and keep enjoying the game! I'll see you in the wasteland! (For those of you on PC)
---
Monthly crowns/atoms, exclusive cosmetic items, unlimited crafting storage, member discounts in the crown/atom shop... All those things are in both subscriptions. Fo76 doesn't make and sell DLCs so instead of going that route they gave the private server.
---
to be honest I forgot about the DLC access because I bought all the DLCs I liked with the crowns I got from my subscription so my game didn't change much when I canceled it. One thing I do like about ESO that I wish fallout did is the daily login reward. I've gotten a few cool pets and mounts that way. I can't imagine the uproar here if the fallout 1st subscription actually gave members access to areas that non-subscribers couldn't get to. They're already upset about people having unlimited crafting materials as it is.
---
Love you too fanboy.
---
Two completely different game types,
---
Can‚Äôt even compare the two 
---
Let alone ‚Äúreplace‚Äù one with the other
---
I think the deleted junk was a bug they already fixed. Plenty of reports of players getting their junk(plus some extra) restores by contacting Bethesda. Speculation says it‚Äôll disappear but I think what Bethesda is hoping for is people to cancel, and then when their junk box of endless goodies runs out(after subscription cancels and they use it all)then the player will come crawling back to the subscription. Classic setup.
---
Who cares
---
The point wasn't that monetization only exists in games or that Bethesda is Satan.
---
It was just a walk down memory lane from a 39 year old, reflecting on how monetization has affected a lot of multiplayer games over the course of my life.
---
As far as 76 goes, I think it's unfortunate to see what's going on after my time with Wildstar, but really I was just trying to be funny with the end part. ;)
---
Wanna see my inert flux?
---
I won't hate on that, that is very valid. The only thing I'm against when it comes to this (which by means isn't towards you) is that Bethesda were probably counting on this when they created the subscription they know very well that so many people wanted private worlds for your reason alone and are basically abusing it.
---
Outer Worlds is awesome, but neither game is a replacement for the other. They are entirely different beasts.
---
Not a troll post.  But I upvoted you since I've never been described as an elitist before.  You may have misinterpreted the part where I love 1st for the fun and am just really tired of people not understanding that not all promises can be kept when financial costs have to be considered.  That's not be an elitist, that's understanding that everyone has bills.
---
‚Äúborderline rebuilt engine‚Äù yeh ok
---
someone didnt watch noclip
---
Look very impressive  but I'd get bored before I reached the top
---
someone believes everything they‚Äôre told
---
Kinda weird hearing that from a Sony fanboy lul
---
Ngl, I feel the exact same way hell with the scrap box I can afford to give players much more better equipment that I would otherwise be short on 
---
I've had high levels help me even gift me a Fusion Generator and Rocket Turrets that I still have and use
---
With PKOA I've done that even more even giving players my old legendaries that I've since replaced or kept the lower level Legendaries and pulled them out whenever I see a Low level that could use them
---
I like it personally but I feel the scrap box and tent should've been free but I digress I liked the game before but when randoms was giving me free stuff that was actually decent, I loves both the game and community right there and then and since I've helped any low levels I came across
---
Best I did was on 2 occasions, one being me giving away a PA Chassis with 3 100 Fusion Cores, giving him plans for a full set of PA as well that he can use when he hits the level required 
---
I gave another player a weapon and a melee built there and then and gave them ammo for said gun I gave away the Prototype Hazmat Suit as I didn't need it, I also allowed them to take the water from the purifier (there's a sign that says free anyway but still) I do the same with the Scavenger robot, I gave away a ton info Radaway, some food, disease cures and something else 
---
I believe the subscription made it easier to help those that don't have it imo and it really helps with the junk as you can store decent low level Legendaries to give away at a later time 
---
Pay to win? Depends on how you view it, I view it as an opportunity to really set up a player with good stuff
---
Let's see they both use unreal 4
---
Marketing has to happen for all businesses that are growing and of course remain profitable. 
---
This isn‚Äôt new by any means whatsoever. 
---
I saw this subscription 200+ days ago coming after playing it from day 1 and being an ESO plus member... 1st is very similar overall. Wasn‚Äôt shocked at all. 
---
Here the old 200+ day old post...

people said the same about the fridge and the scrap bot. "no way Bethesda would charge for the base version"
---
yeah
---
I game primarily on my PC and secondary on my PS4. Thats why you have the label fanboy. Hurts doesnt it ? :)
---
Still replying to me till now geez. Are you like 10 years old?
---
Neat, is this r/roastme? Cause if so, I think your oven is broken.
---
Whatever they let you guys buy over the counter to avoid seasickness. Dramamine is what they call it here in the states but it's possible that you guys have it under a different name.
---
Amen. The best explanation I can come up with is they were trying to go after the Fortnite crowd, which would explain NW and all the dumb cosmetics that seem to make up 90% of the Atomic Shop. They just weren't successful at getting this to be the new hip online shooter game for that group and thus their business model had to switch to utility items and subscriptions.
---
Buying a ps4 while owning a PC. That's a big fanboi right there
---
I also have this (5 months later). I have earn my backpack a long time ago and I purchased the shovel one and can't find it in the bench, I can make the regular and small backpacks and it doesn't even appear as an option...
---
You cant afford to own both? Srls?
---
the thing though, is that all of those improvements you mentioned belong in the base game. I shouldn't have to pay 10 bucks for a (relatively) stable connection in an always online game.
---
but most importantly, they're charging for a feature that should (and could) be free: private servers. not that 1st is private server as it is, it's clearly just PR bs. but actual, local servers is what people wanted from the beginning. and it's literally just a small server file that they could release right now- if they wanted.
---
but of course that would put a big dent on their monthly earning because of mods, and we can't have that, now can we? so screw the customers. that's what I'm pissed off about the most. I want private servers, not a premium sub. I don't want to be tethered to Bethesda's services, ever.
---
There is a google doc floating around somewhere on this sub that shows every mod and how to get it, whether it be world spawn, vendor, or scrapping.  I don‚Äôt want to find it right away for time sake but maybe you can do some searches or someone else will post.  Deathclaw gauntlet extra claw mod is currently the only mod in the game that cannot be obtained to build. If memory serves me right.
---
For those that have the sub, you can keep it. You go any level up in your world, then come into the adventure world to take ppl out WHILE defending a camp....Nice....you can have it. Thanks for the ride.
---
Question is....how do I get that armor
---
Why would you ever consider buying an Acura while you already own a Porche? It's not about being able to afford something, it's about not wasting money
---
Coming out in a future update. Probably going to be in atom shop
---
I‚Äôm at level 364 and have done hundreds of runs of things. It‚Äôs just a grind at this point so finding ways to entertain myself within the game is all I‚Äôve got. Sadly, this experiment was short and it‚Äôs over. Back to nukes, Whitespring, NW, raids and SBQ. These things seem kinda boring to me at this point but I‚Äôm cool with the grind!
---
Dude the sarcasm tells me everything I need to know. My bad you're taking information from an Ill informed YouTuber as law
---
The crazy part is that private servers have always cost money in some way and everyone acts like that isn‚Äôt the case. 
---
Even if you build a dedicated server PC, the hardware costs money. At the very least, it costs money for the power to keep it running. 
---
If people spent one day just trying to get one server rack up and running, they‚Äôd reconsider their entitlements.
---
Does this coincide with the upcoming Communist  Bundle?
---
I was referring more to the repair kits.
---
Private servers require more time, energy, and manpower to maintain that requires a stable flow of income to maintain.  Initial game sales can not support that.  While pricing in the atom shop needs work, adding it is still not enough income to support the costs.  Marketing and promises at launch were definitely botched at launch(which caused bad game sales).  But how could we feel a game of this magnitude could support itself purely on game and atom sales?
---
Lol outer worlds is absolutely nothing like borderlands
---
These always amuse me. Just a note when you come by the Mothman museum. The TNT domes north of point pleasant are real. They're only a few miles up the road but they are definitely in the woods.
---
I'm glad you are enjoying it.  I personally would never use a private server so I have no interest in getting 1st.  The fact that they made the scrap box and tent pay only is bullshit though, at least let them be obtainable with atoms.  If not for those 2 p2w items, I don't think anyone would have an issue with the subscription.  Again, glad it works for what you want out of the game.
---
Because i got money to spend unlike a 10 year old fanboy.  üòä
---
I appreciate that you like something and you don't care what other people think.
---
In the end we do what we like and if someone else doesn't like it they can do something else.
---
Really didn‚Äôt know what was going on until I read your comment and thought to myself why....oh oooohhh I see...that‚Äôs hot. üòÇ
---
Well guess you kinda jumped to that one, but it‚Äôs been error after error since they thought it would be genious to go all in on mobile games.

&gt;[Video game revenue](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/22/video-game-revenue-tops-43-billion-in-2018-an-18-jump-from-2017/) in 2018 reached a new peak of $43.8 billion, up 18 percent from the previous years, surpassing the projected total global box office for the film industry, according to new data released by the Entertainment Software Association and The NPD Group 
---
Yeah, that's certainly what failing looks like.
---
Do you even have a clue as to what you‚Äôre talking about?
---
I just don‚Äôt care.
---
I paid for the game last year, I played the game, got a bunch of time and fun out of it. Now I‚Äôve moved on.
---
If you are upset, don‚Äôt chide the people who want to blow their money on a dying game, that is their prerogative. Don‚Äôt buy a Bethesda game next time - especially if they make promises that aren‚Äôt shipping on day 1 with your initial purchase.
---
Eat fire troll!
---
Everyone moved on to Outer Worlds. Only the shills remain.
---
&gt;But how could we feel a game of this magnitude could support itself purely on game and atom sales?
---
gee, I don't know. other games somehow manage to pull it off. OW didn't even have pre-order bonuses. but not Bethesda, huh?
---
&gt;Private servers require more time, energy, and manpower to maintain
---
no they don't. it's a minuscule server file that runs in the back. they could release it right now if they wanted as it only controls npc, mob and item spawns, mostly.
---
Can we all just agree the we don‚Äôt want content that‚Äôs broken especially if it‚Äôs paid for? Can we all agree on that one thing
---
I‚Äôm sick of Everyone complaining about this game then people complaining about the people complaining about the game it‚Äôs so stupid
---
Plenty of people agree and bought subscription so ok üòÇüññüèæ
---
Who is saying that official servers should have mods? OP didn't say that, I didn't say that, and my comment was about private servers on this game and the one I mentioned.
---
try setting everything to low and work your way up from there. in my experience the textures bottleneck everything regardless of your graphics card.
---
the game runs poorly regardless, though.
---
I actually agree that those 2 should be available for purchase to all.  But I would like to discuss the p2w mechanics.  For me I see no p2w.  I really have trouble seeing a "win" environment myself as I dont see a definitive "I have won the game" moment.
---
Talk to me when you get bored of 76 and wish you hadn't wasted all that money.
---
Why would you do that while you own a PC? and why would you think it's a good idea to run a RAM demanding game like fallout 76 on ps4 when you got a PC? Imma tell your mom to stop giving you money
---
Overclock your ram. You're wanting a minimum of 3200mhz. Ryzen likes fast ram. Higher the better... shoot for 3600mhz if you can maintain it stable. Look for guides on YouTube if you've never done it before.
---
If you've already got your Ryzen and ram OC'd and still not getting 60+ fps then start lowering the draw distance. Draw distance will be the biggest fps gain you can achieve for minimal quality hit.
---
When I said failing I wasn't talking about the company because obviously they are succeeding.
---
I'm talking about the quality of games for the gamers, games use to be about playing and earning rewards for over coming challenges and overall having a good time, now alot if not all of that stuff is monetized, there is no incentive for doing challenges there is no reward, you get rewarded buy spending money how is that entertaining? What's the point?.
---
So please don't misdirect what I said because you fucking well know what I said.
---
Yep. For the most part, I only drink or eat stuff when it's safe. If I get a really good legendary you better believe I'm exiting the game (to force save) before drinking any water.
---
Pay $100 to unlock the first quest. (This is just a joke, but the point of it should be quite obvious)
---
Interesting question, I will test it when i get back home.
---
Marketing does happen but this is why we have terms like 'aggressive monetization' for companies that triple-dip. :-p
---
The subs do look similar and I don't think 1st's problem is that it's low value. The context around the sub-- state of the game and its updates, history of problems, the sub's impact on gameplay-- are what have led to the uproar. ESO doesn't share that context.
---
Very impressive!
---
To be honest, I played it and it's absolute garbage
---
I can agree on that.
---
Op is complaining about subscription.
---
Who cares? Umm‚Ä¶a lot of people? You may wanna look at other subreddits and Twitter.

On the flip side come to a positive post, and all the negative comments are downvoted.

This sub has gone straight tribalistic.

When game first came out you had your dupe squads and your dupe hating squads.

Then you have your pvp lovers and non pvp lovers

Now we have fo1st subscribers and people who hate everything it stands for

What‚Äôs next in our tribal battle for influence on this sub.

I swear I think I‚Äôm in r/politics sometimes.

The downvoters are all subscription shills

Ok. Walk out into the street or anywhere your local gamers meet and shout that Fallout 1st is great. See what happens.

What did he say?

Yes please

calling people stupid isnt very civil...

People say they don‚Äôt want the price of public transport to be increased, yet I constantly see people with bus and train tickets!

---
 Experiments don't go wrong, well ... Anyway the idea is to generate data.
---
Pretty good thanks, how about yours?
---
Yeah, the private servers were always going to allow mods of some kind. Even in the announcement for Fallout 1st a few days ago they mentioned yet again that Fallout 1st's private servers will allow modding in the future. That is what OP is talking about, that the way they've implemented the servers is not good for modding.
---
Dude, they aren't trolls and haters. They're fans and customers who are disenfranchised because Bethesda is going the way of EA with this game. They're understandably upset because they're seeing their favorite worlds heading in a very unlikable direction and people like you are providing Bethesda the incentive to continue to monetize the game further. Where exactly is the line? I preordered the game on PC and went in on it again with a friend on xbox. I've got as much skin in the game as most people in here but it's shitty and I regret giving them my hard earned cash for the game. That's great you enjoy it, I want to enjoy it, but I can't abide the practices you're subsidizing.

---
Well, more accurately it's paying for an advantage.  The tent gives you a 2nd ft point and allows you to keep your main camp while also being mobile.  The scrap box frees up stash space.  Extra camp and extra stash space are both inarguably advantages that unlevel the playing field.  They need to give non subscribers a way to obtain them.
---
nowadays you can host and play on the same PC. even back in 2005 I remember hosting and playing Ragnarok on the same PC and it was hardly an herculean task. it takes minutes to setup a minecraft server, seconds if you just play singleplayer.
---
&gt;At the very least, it costs money for the power to keep it running.
---
that's just rationalizing a crappy behavior on Bethesda's part. you might as well say you "have to pay rent so local servers cost money anyway"
---
Wow I haven't seen someone with so much bethesda dick in their mouth.  Not word for word but overall I suck bethesda dick.  It was a good time, I had cake too.

I suspect the -15% damage effect procs separately for each effect, on each piece. For example, I have a full set of Troubleshooter's Sentinel armor. When being attacked by the Imposter Sheepsquatch I take very little damage.

Ended up having to put in extra hours for work and was tiring but still feel good about getting shit done.  Then I made this post.

That way humanity as a whole is now a little better.
---
I rest my case. Only your opinion matters. Noone cares about opinions that don‚Äôt match yours, but you care enough to reply. You are a troll. A hypocritical troll at that. Try a little harder next time. Oh, and friendly advice don‚Äôt use arguments that can be used against you. Trust me, I‚Äôve been there. Save yourself from it.
---
The only thing wrong is the ability to move between public and private servers with tje sme chacter at will. That heavily restricts the kind of mods that can be made due to needing to keep game play balance on offical servers
---
They mentioned that private servers would have mods in the future on the announcement of Fallout 1st.

Oh thats awesome ty for sharing.

Funny how you judge people like that. You dont know anything about my life.

Ty again for reminding me I dont have a life, like if I wasnt aware of that from before.

If you put a hat on and then off, or sunglasses, or a mask etc; it fixes itself. An odd one but not for 76.

Of course! That'll be an ass pounding and $15 per day of ingame snow.
---
With the scrap box, that's a valid concern. The tent and other stuff? Not so much. I don't see them as being much different than the exclusive outfits that were part of the atom bundles for the various game cons.
---
As for mods on private servers, as much as I want them to give us free reign, I can't blame them for not doing so. The #1 mod on Nexus for Fallout 4 is a nude body replacer. While that's fine for a single player game where they have no way to control the mods you install, allowing them on private servers that they run for us would almost certainly cause some problems for them. I'd expect that they'll eventually allow curated mods, similar to the Creation Club in Fallout 4. The pessimist/realist in me expects that just like the Creation Club, they'll charge atoms for those mods too.

Keeping the fucking lights on? Bethesda  aren't some fucking poor indie dev. Jesus fucking christ. This is their trap and this is what players use to validate them being ass fucked for $14 a month. "Keeping the lights on" my fucking ass. This company could afford to remove the Atom shop and make the game free. They are a multi billion dollar company. They release a DOG SHIT game and then expect people to PAY $14 MONTHLY or 100$ YEARLY. Oh, but the devs are giving us a premium option! THIS SHIT SHOULD'VE BEEN FREE BOTTOM LINE. You're not "keeping the lights on for the people that don't pay" you're bending over backwards for this FUCK of a lying company. I used to like Bethesda. But after 76. Oh fuck them.

You didn't even know mods were going to be in the game 5 minutes ago. No offense, but you obviously haven't thought about it much. The fact that every player needs to have a subscription and that the private servers only allow 8 players is enough to make it way worse than how other games have implemented mods. 
---
If you look at the game I mentioned, Conan Exiles, they have steam workshop support and private servers that one player or group buys to run the game modded in the way they want. The servers are up all the time and can have like 40 players on them. A player with the base game just clicks on the server, downloads the required mods from steam workshop, and enters the world. They can build a house and do whatever they want in the game. They don't need to personally know the person who owns the server, have to pay a subscription fee to access the server someone else already paid for, and the server doesn't go down unless the owner takes it down. 
---
I could go on with the other things I think are bad for modding outside of the stuff OP brought up in the original post like that the mods will likely be curated through the Atomic Shop and limited compared to Fallout 4, but hopefully I've successfully pointed out why there are numerous flaws with how they've chosen to do this.

And yeah, they will either have to lock modded server characters out of public or severely limit what can be modded so that they are compatible still with public servers. More than likely, modding will just be very limited to mostly cosmetic stuff so that they are compatible. The opposite scenario is that they will be locked to the modded server which will be even worse in ways because it is almost impossible to make a healthy community on the tiny 8 player servers that disappear when someone without a subscription is no longer on them.

He got dat herp

Changing your mouth type doesnt help? Also do you have other characters?
---
You're like a spouse that says they love their significant other despite being beaten by them daily. I get you, go do you.

Well 1. As Juicehead said their mechanics are currently broken  and have been for awhile (as I know you pulled this info from his video literally just posted). So it's not like they'll go live tomorrow and work. 
---
2. There is fucking code from Oblivion in this game does that mean we'll go fight Demi gods soon?? No. It was something obviously in development and they decided not to go through with. Just cause it was found in the code doesn't mean it's coming.
---
A year, actually.
---
Weird flex but okay....
---
Do a barrelroll!
---
You need lead. Then steel. Then gunpowder. Then acid. Then you have some bullets. Then a couple of queen fights and wait, need to start this over. Haha. I love my .50 cal and I love grinding to keep it filled with ammo. Did a raid today and went through about 6k rounds. Had a blast though.
---
Agree. Main issue is the Scrap Box imo.
---
&gt;players came out in en masse to harrass players who made this game great
---
this is literally maga rhetoric
---
&gt;Even a bizarre class war
---
fallout is about class struggle, dummy. it's only bethesda which has taken the irony *straight* and their insipid, tone-deaf livestock who cannot hear the fourth wall shattering with every digital purchase
---
Nope, it stays the exact same, and no this is my only one
---
Better yet do one of those high end Olympic dives.
---
Do it in a way that won‚Äôt damage your kidneys. Other people need them, you know!
---
Jesus, I'm definitely gonna need to farm as much lead as I can get my hands on and steel too.

If course he cares what we think, that's why he posted this.

Here's a proper guide that ACTUALLY works.

Railway Rifle, Classic 10mm pistol, Chinese Assault Rifle, Plasma Caster, Tesla Cannon, classic Deathclaw gauntlet,  K9000 Cyberdog Gun, THAT Gun, Cosmic Knife, Samurai Sword, Ranger Sequoia, Alien weapons (all of the ones from Mothership Zeta), anti Materiel rifle, All of the military style rifles from New Vegas (such as the survivalists rifle, the All American, This Machine, .45 auto SMG, assault carbine, battle rifle etc.), 9mm pistol, nail gun, Mysterious Magnum, Chinese Pistol. I can go on lol

How does sun light get "trapped" by the dust but not reflected before it can even get through the atmosphere?
---
Chill Toby. It just a game.
---
I don't care I lost junk what so ever. And if you don't require perks like escape artist cause you can hide in your magic tent then that's pay to win.
---
Uh oh! You upset the pre-teen crowd.

Lol, btw I'm laughing at you not with you.
---
Where in the Enclave bunker do you buy the mods?
---
I'm sorry I don't speak whale

Was going to post this separately but I'll tack it onto your threead

Thanks OP for helping to ruin video games for all of us. When are paying real dollars to open chests and need a monthly subscription to enter dungeons in TES6 you will have yourself and others like you to thank.

That‚Äôs fine I don‚Äôt speak broke scrub either

More than likely they will be released after Wastelanders. I suspect it will be late summer or around the 2 year anniversary in November. I'm going to guess that it will require a custom F76 creation kit and that the mods will be uploaded to the Atomic Shop or another link from the main menu. Who knows really, but I doubt that they would have made a point to remind people of this again when public servers were announced if they didn't have at least a plan to do it in the somewhat near future of development.
---
This is an online game with almost zero content where you have fun with friends. I'm sorry you missed the point and substitute social interaction with worthless micro transactions.
---
That technically already a thing in eso.....oh no
---
I‚Äôm sorry you assume that me and my friends don‚Äôt play in these dope ass private servers
---
hail satan

Shut up meg

No -I think he is a brain dead rep.
---
That's cool I like your approach.  While I respect your opinion, I feel very strongly that this is more of a matter of principle than anything.  A promise was made and the consumer shouldn't have to expect it to be taken back once it's no longer profitable.  It also seems like they're preying on compulsive behaviour if not taking advantage of it, and for that reason alone I can't stand by it.  Lastly, I grew up on games and envisioned a very bright future for the industry, so to see it taking this turn is just ripping my heart out.  Rather than expanding on what has made gaming great in past years, developers are instead working on ways to play on your weaknesses in order milk every penny they can out of you.
---
Well you‚Äôre entitled to an opinion, I‚Äôm just saying a lot of people totally do this
---
Have fun playing house with your alt accounts
---
From what I can tell is White/Brown/Green/Blue/Yellow/ Pink/Forest/Red and the hats very common. I sell mine starting at 500/1k/1500/3000/ the rest are 15k plus.
---
A game that has a PVP element is now considered griefing EVERY single time you get attacked because you subbed to FO1st? A little bit of a stretch there.
---
Haha, oh it‚Äôs way over priced.... I‚Äôll try for a month  then cancel it. I have some time off right now. It‚Äôs definitely pay to win.
---
I havent noticed any of the hatred from this subreddit in game. Everything's been smooth sailing in the wasteland.
---
All the people mad quit remember lol
---
More like pay for advantage
---
I agree with you, and so do this posts upvotes
---
Mmmm.  Nope.  The absurdity of the bitching I've seen pop up on my feed literally drove me to start playing this game again.  It is a great game.  The laughable, immature hate that drives posts like this are now fueling people like me.
---
Heaven forbid someone has a different opinion than you.  The game pass literally has ZERO impact on you or your life and you all are acting like your first born was murdered.
---
Church
---
Thank you
---
Mods will prolly pull this because you weren‚Äôt negative enough lmao
---
There is reports of it but it‚Äôs hard to believe everytime I went on today to and no one even cared that I had it
---
Meth is a hell of a drugg
---
There was a post earlier encouraging people to attack anyone with the Fallout First stuff. So it's really not that farfetched for them to assume this.
---
I like you. You understand things.
---
I kill everyone that tries lol but yeah i lost more fights that ill admit.
---
It‚Äôs what will bring me back to the game. I‚Äôll even get first just for this.
---
So basically porn

I would see a doctor if I was shitting as much as you are.

One of these days you'll get the hang of trolling.

I love this sub Reddit ( this is a good one not sarcasm) I genuinely love this subreddit
---
Thanks brother!
---
For everyone who is not a part of the outrage culture the game is better then it was last week. Less bugs and more content, what is not to like?
---
Gn
---
Maybe it‚Äôs the extras have you changed those day all?
---
MMM - Mama Murphy Mouth.
---
Give it a rest, dude. Maybe think about the reasons you feel the need to be so negative and do something else in your life besides be angry about a video game for a while
---
Yeah that what I mean, less of win but yeah an advantage
---
I like the companion controls
---
It doesn‚Äôt have to stop...you just need to stop reading subs and play the game however you want. No one should have to justify themselves to anyone for what they do with their own cash. If you like the game play it if you don‚Äôt, play something else.
---
iam 99% sure that the mods for the paddle ball are bugged/not implemented. the camden whacker (the one you get for tokens) and the commie whacker (the one lying around camden park) dont have obtainable plans.
---
Idk maybe it‚Äôs the lobbies I was in or The time I was playing.
---
What I just read in the more recent posts is not really the tent maybe but we had unlimited storage before fallout first with alt accounts
---
How do u use the tent? I have no idea where this is?
---
Best advice I can give is ignore them, or taunt them I do bothü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è makes me laugh but ignore them and get on with your day they can‚Äôt do anything to you
---
Makes me wonder if I‚Äôll be treated the same way. I‚Äôm going to wonder in adventure mode with the 1st icon and see what happens lol.
---
Until the next update ü§¨
---
If you were a true Fallout lover/fan, you would welcome amd embrace the bugs and see them as just another challenge.  It's Fallout/Bethesda for fucks sake.  Better than COD.  I can't play that game for 5 minutes without my graphics card drivers crashing the game.   Spent 60$ 5 years ago on a game I never got to play.  I can see both sides point if view.  They are working on a free version for the people who don't wish to pay.  When I played Ark I paid for my own server through a 3rd party.   Cost me a few bucks more than this.  This is probably as good as it's going to get for private servers and this game.  If they let you use a third party that pretty much means you get full control of the server which means all the "player.additem" from all the previous fallouts will be abused.   You can't really do that with this online/no single player game.   The lines of code alone to make it work would just make the game crash even harder.   There's so many details.  So many things would have to be done and tbh we all should have been aware that anyone who's played on a legit private server, would know it will never legitimately happen with Fallout 76.  I see both sides of the argument though.  And as much as I want it to be free, you can't dangle a limitless stash in front of me and expect me to pass.   Its like passing up sex.   Just not gonna happen.
---
I don‚Äôt know about that. Here‚Äôs a shitty comparison. 
---
It‚Äôs like being naked at a pride parade, and someone tells you to cover up. Then, you decide to shout from rooftops that they hate the pride parade and the community supporting gay rights when in reality you were nude in a public place and it had nothing to do with your life choices. 
---
Again, super random topic, but a fair comparison. 
---
The game has PVP. Some people are assholes. You‚Äôre going to get attacked. Don‚Äôt cry wolf and assume it‚Äôs all because of FO1st. You‚Äôre just playing the victim card at that point.
---
- It's not an opinion that if the sub is successful enough other companies will take note and put them in their games. That is fact. 
---
- How would purchasing sports games hurt anyone? That's supporting the genre. That's like saying purchasing fallout 76 hurts people. It doesn't. Those are just GAMES we're talking about MONETIZATION here. Now if you went and purchased a bunch of fifa lootbox packs then yeah that would be bad but not really hurt anyone as lootboxes are sadly already a part of the industry. 
---
- Again, it's not "opinion" that a lot of the forms of monetization we have today are predatory, anti consumer and is detrimental to the games they're a part of. It is FACT that the sub is a terrible value from an average consumer standpoint and is ripe for exploitation and abuse. It is a FACT that if it's successful other companies WILL use it and it won't be good for any of us. 
---
- You are wayyyyyy too emotionally invested in this jesus buddy. Try and take a few steps back and stop looking at everything being all about you and the individual. This is about EVERYONE not just you or me or whoever else. Stop taking it so personally. 
---
- People are welcome to dig into anything I purchase? I've bought porn and MTX before that's about the worst things I can think of. I don't give a flying fuck what anyone spends their money on though as long as it won't affect the rest of us. THIS. DOES. 
---
- There is absolutely a greater good here?? On one side you have those supporting and purchasing a terrible broken overpriced sub model thats the first of its kind in a non MMORPG that if successful will leak into other game, and on the other you have people who are informed enough to see where it leads and don't want their video games further ruined and bastardized by even more forms of monetization. 
---
Seriously grow up and stop taking everything like it's about you. This isn't about you or I. It's about video games as a whole a hobby many many people love and enjoy and want to protect, clearly you are not one of those. Please get informed. 
---
Thanks!
---
I play on Xbox but it‚Äôs on your weapon wheel and you should see a button on the bottom that says like ‚Äú press for survival tent or something‚Äù
---
Yup which is why Bethesda patched out stacking foundations because they considered it gamebreaking. Now they sell it to you.
---
If your bullshit is interrupting my enjoyment of the game I paid for them yes.
---
I hate that people think that farming whitespring is the way to play this game and call the world "crowded" if other people are there. The map is packed full of random encounters that spawn in as you approach and can be any number of different types of enemies and legendaries. Exploring the map for enemies and having a rotation of hunting random encounters is way more fun and way faster at getting legendaries than just sitting at whitespring. When I'm leading around low level players it's me calling out "3* legendary on me, at NAR repair yard, or at sundew Grove, or at a dozen other random encounters instead of boring whitespring over and over.
---
Holy shit I don't think I've ever seen someone so against and hate filled towards video games. Jesus why are you even here if you hate them so much?? I'm going to save this to use as an example later thank you!
---
I don't PvP as its a broken mess and the tents are p2w in PvP anyways.
---
It wasn‚Äôt 1 guy dude it wasn‚Äôt even like a trio or duo. Ik the difference. 11 people were at my camp saying stupid derogatory shit, and blinding me with there Tesla rifles and explosive bullets just cause I subbed
---
You have to pay a monthly fee for the pumpkins feature though I‚Äôm sure.
---
Then in your mind nothing could be p2w in this game. Lol
---
Go play in your Private World then.
---
This is my predicament.
---
No shit, it is just the map, which is why I said other mods add in the other parts of fo76 such the special cards, 3star legendaries, etc.
---
Will probably just be player made cosmetics. I wanted bigger and better mods on real private servers that are always online, have more than 8 players, and that I don't have to pay a monthly fee to access (only the owner of the server should need to pay for it). This is why, as OP said, there won't be a great modding community when they do get around to allowing mods. It'll be half-assed and ass backwards to how it should be, the theme of Fallout 76 thus far. But I don't care if someone else enjoys it, just like with Fallout 1st how it is now. You do you man, I won't hate. Just wanted to clear up the confusion in this thread on the topic of mods.
---
I‚Äôm gonna put on the emblem to see how it goes now. I mainly subbed to get the outfit and to try the private server out for a month it‚Äôs an alright service I‚Äôd just rather it be $8 since the server isn‚Äôt on all the time and only 8 people at a time. It‚Äôs be nice if it was on all the time, 20+ people and there was a server search option to join other people‚Äôs modded serve with a private server character only.
---
Dude I do but when my squad and I need recourses we have to go trading. So what am I supposed to do? Not play? Like u serious?
---
See, you didn‚Äôt specify that every single server you went to over half the population coming to fuck with you and then shout derogatory stuff. I could see that then. Going into a few servers and getting attacked when it‚Äôs clear this community is toxic is a whole different story, and that‚Äôs how it was made to sound. I see what you‚Äôre getting at now.
---
Then play by the rules, which includes PvP.
---
&gt;Pal, I don't know why you're so argumentative. Here I thought this was just gonna be a normal conversation, too bad you just want to argue.
---
I'm sorry you can't handle that people have opinions that differ from yours. Maybe you shouldn't be debating.
---
&gt;I literally said the only people that I consider on said bandwagon were the ones that only come here to say, "you all are fucking stupid for playing this game, Bethesda is scamming you fools."  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;If someone comes to this sub to voice their actual opinion \[...\]
---
So what if that *was* their actual opinion? What you're describing now is the difference in how they express it. You're forgetting that some people are more skilled than others when it comes to articulating ones opinions and feelings.
---
I feel you've been changing your definition of the term with your new posts. You were initially talking about people "jumping on the bandwagon", an expression meaning a person who's only doing or saying something because it is the popular thing to do. That's why I reacted and said you were quick to label people, because *you don't know* if these people actually had legit feelings about the game. Saying they were only here to jump on the bandwagon is to assume that they didn't care about it, and that's unfair.
---
Lmao you must be a troll.
---
I'm against people acting in a self - righteous manner with a mob mentality. Great job in the argument by the way. Didn't even attempt to bring up a single relevant point.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm really not holding my breath over modding this game. I‚Äôve pretty much let it go at this point. I‚Äôm moving on to Death Stranding.
---
the skins are of such low resolution though, textures in general just aren't sharp enough, it bothers me :/
---
but yeah, there's a real scarcity of good weapon skins lol
---
Or maybe players who enjoy the game are tired of all the negativity..
---
D2 continued to get free updates for nearly a decade after lod,  hellfire diablo, uber trist, new runewords etc.
---
As for minecraft, my point was you get free updates nearly weekly and private servers are completely free to run on your own hardware and, literally the only mincrotransactions are on console and if you look most are third party, not put out by mojang themselves.
---
I used to play eso a lot and had the sub service eso+ ($15 a month) and they had unlimited storage as well. To which I said, and a lot of the community says, just sell the craft bag (unlimited storage) for $5 a month or something.
---
Your game will be most stable around 50fps, it is a console port and not designed to run above 60fps. You can get higher frames but you will lose stability.
---
I use sometimes a aa double crits harpoon as well on strangler armor and works dammit nice üëç
---
Problem is as always that it might work now but next week it could be different...Personally I don‚Äôt bother testing I just use stuff and expect it to work. Maybe if I was more into pvp I would care more.
---
Dude there is a difference between pvp and being a dick
---
And if this was happening to you you‚Äôd get annoyed too
---
I can agree on that.  I personally didn't believe the promises but a vast majority did.  Those promises shouldn't have ever been made in the first place.  One of the many steps bethesda needs to take at the very least is a sincere apology for this one, and understand that this is disheartening to its followers.  At the same time though I'll admit I fell into the pay as you go world of video games.  I really miss the days of buy a game and that's it, but I feel now is the time of pay as you go.  I hope my daughter lives long enough to see it finally return to normal.
---
Or the genuinely care about fallout since fallout 3. Even going back to play fo1 and 2. And Bethesda just likes to shit all over its fans lately
---
Who paid you to say that?
---
Generally, its a bad idea to join someones private unless you know them well. I know its a new thing, but its proper etiquette.
---
No I mean the fallout1st player can use the tent as an advantage in PvP combat, be it using it as cover to attack from, to using it to pin another player down and take their workshop.
---
You act like it can only be used at workshops but it can be used anywhere, including using it to grief others.
---
Bruhhh
---
ah yes, the wonderful system of government where the majority can impose upon the minority
---
Yeah I did to it was worth it for the crafting bag and the free dlc. Fallout 1 isn‚Äôt to far off from that sub a lot of people don‚Äôt realize your getting your worth back in atoms anyways. So if they do change the sub lower the atoms would be the first to go. It would turn into a $8 sub just without atoms.
---
Do the Mothman dance
---
I still disagree. If he has had little trouble before but has had lots of trouble after buying the sub ( and considering that people are being encouraged to attack those with the sub ) it's a perfectly reasonable assumption.
---
A win over other players and all their scrap, and workshop and everything they built in the workshop.
---
If you don't like what the dev's have done with game their game, don't buy it. Withholding your money is best way to show your displeasure with their action.
---
I do fucking well know what you said. You said "the game industry is failing." If what you meant to type was "the gaming industry isn't what I think it used to be like" you should have typed that instead of "the gaming industry is failing."  Based on your word salad, I think you've changed, not the industry, because the stuff you're whining about is still present in all sorts of games. Hell, it's present in this game. If you can't find it, that's on you.
---
Ya sorry bout that I went to like 8 servers and like the first few times I thought was funny, or maybe like some joke was played. And it‚Äôs not like it was everyone at first, or everyone I encountered I should say. It wasn‚Äôt till like the last 4 server hops it became toxic very fast
---
He probably wanted to be alone and as there is no in game chat he couldn‚Äôt tell you
---
Are you guys Neo?
---
Like wtf man. Knock first or something.
---
Ummmm you know there is an absolute carry limit.. Right? You can't just hold unlimited junk on a second character.
---
Just to check, you were at a WS, some guy contested, but you did no damage at all right?
---
Yeah that's effectively the same as someone showing up at your house uninvited. This is old school etiquette. I remember this was normal at least in the Halo 3 forge days.
---
Hear that!
---
Some run-of-the-mill assassins sentinels gear most likely. Welcome newbie. ü§ô
---
I did no damage what's so ever
---
I place my camp near Whitesprings and also my survival camp near by the train station as well early in the morning to get the spots to myself. I have to push away my competition;)
---
Sorry!  They offered me 10% off the fridge.
---
Lol. I think it‚Äôs funny, but like it‚Äôs weird the music doesn‚Äôt stop immediately after u stop dancing, it like fades out, and it gets annoying to do the emotes when the music plays for a sec when you‚Äôre not dancing
---
someone ELI5 for a dude whos only played FO:NV
---
Could he damage you?
---
It's a duping exploit, thought it was fixed but will look into it
---
Yeah, he 1 tapped me with a explosive fullauto weapon
---
I'm sorry friend. Truly. I feel your pain.  I have no remedy.
---
Did you think it was a good idea to do it? You should've expected that it could happen. Unless you're good friends with them, it's gonna happen
---
You are literally turning something I have said and turning it into something else even after I've expressed what I'm actually talking about. Get out of here dum dum.
---
I ain't a noob sadly, I just have never seen that happen even with friends who have assassin/sentinel builds
---
I haven't even bought the game so a step ahead!
---
Ya I also feel like the same people who shit on sub services r the same people who will go buy a $20 pack in fortnite for 1 skin and 2000 vbucks. Like not saying that‚Äôs bad, my friends and I r guilty of it once. I just don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs good and this is bad
---
Just buy it physical. If you don‚Äôt like it take it back with the receipt. Watch gameplay without commentary, make an opinion of your own because only you will decide if you enjoy it or not. I personally like it
---
They do,  I don't think many people know about it though due to conditioning in adventure mode
---
I would chalk that up as a bug for sure, or a hacker. If you have the guys name, send a support ticket and mention the player.
---
Yeah go ahead and pick it up at a low price. Play at your own pace and play solo to listen and understand the holotapes. It's not all that bad to new players. Make sure to keep it updated and try to be a level 50 for the big npc update
---
They also don‚Äôt understand that servers cost money to maintain so they were never gonna get private servers without having to pay money for it. People used to be alright with it but not in this game for some odd reason.
---
PvP damage is capped at 110 per hit so a fat man is kind of useless.
---
Possibly a thing I've kinda wanted to do. Put the first icon on, wear the Ranger armour, then make a camp with a single scrap box, see what happens.
---
I know it can be used everywhere, but workshops are the only place PVP ever happens anymore. As for the attackers using it to help them take over workshops, meh. There's so much else wrong with workshop PVP that this hardly matters. That camel's back was broken long before this straw was added.
---
Is this a Todd bot?
---
They do the same garbage on the ESO Subreddit, constant pictures mentioning how 'beautiful' the gane is, lucky gambling crate drops, blatent adverts for collectors edition tat abd books etc.
---
Everyone I have have killed with the Fatman has been 1 shot by it, its a very nice weapon to have
---
Thanks for all the feedback I really appreciate it.
---
It‚Äôs okay, hopefully we all have more encounters like this
---
Did they invite you or did you just join? Either way it‚Äôs probably a good idea to ask them for clarification why they booted you but also maybe knock before entering so to speak...
---
Heh....Piper Perri
---
You know you like it.
---
Like ik Minecraft did it. I never played enough to care. I loved it when I played it cause I was with my sister. Plus we had 3 Xbox‚Äôs and 4 TVs so if we had friends come over that wasn‚Äôt a problem. And we didn‚Äôt know enough people online for it to be a $10 problem either
---
and on top of that textures look rather low resolution, PC really needs a HD expansion. I sure would be more interesting in buying something if it wasn't missing pixels lol
---
I saw the potential til Fallout First... then I saw a different potential playing out, an incremental introduction of pay to win advantages.  A backseat given to actual improvements....  they could have gone the final fantasy fourteen route and been a triumphant story of won back good will... instead they became the best advertisement for a better game.   Made me sad.
---
Think its similar to atoms
---
Just look up Piper Perri, you'll eventually find the right video.
---
Bonus points if you do it at work....
---
He had a date with a hot ghoul...lol
---
What you've expressed is nostalgic nonsense.
---
Dense chest mods and fireproof perk will basically negate explosions.
---
Yeah.  Bare bones.  Just enough room to hold my fridge and workstations and terminal basically.  And some melons for food/water.  And a cook fire.  I like the idea of a cool camp, but it's not all that practical it would seem.  Guess I could always play in my private server.  Just come to the main world on occasion to sell some stuff.
---
I have a Minecraft realm it‚Äôs $8 and the connection is shit I constantly have to re upload the map and the servers go down 1 time every 3 days. Yet it‚Äôs nice being able to let my friends on when I‚Äôm not so I keep it.
---
6000? is that a joke?
---
Thank you random citizen!
---
&gt;I understand completely why the stash wasn't infinite, storing all that customized loot could eventually get taxing for their systems.
---
I'm a games developer and that's utter tosh. It takes an absolutely tiny amount of storage to have a huge inventory. A consumer grade hard drive could store the details for several million users entire inventories.
---
I just realized something hilarious... Survival Mode never truly went away, it's come back to us with the sub. Just throw your target suit on and run around the wasteland dodging bullets. xD
---
(Unintended hilarity aside, OP that sucks and I wish you best of luck)
---
That is an opinion and not a fact which holds no weight here. 
---
Anything else?
---
Exactly. I picked up a second account to run on my gf's xbox and that effectively gives me 10 characters to move things around on without too much trouble.
---
8,000 stash total, 10,000 max carry weight on characters.
---
Mind you no one needs that much stash but it helps after the legendary vendor 50% sale lol

They didn't always have 140 or 200 million subscribers though. I've had Spotify for over 10 years and it has cost pretty much the same ever since it was introduced. They were just a small company back then. I still think Fallout 1st is ridiculously overpriced. Just like the prices in the Atomic Shop.
---
Could be loot boxes, could be they still have all the code from fallout 4 in it, which y'know, you could find lunchboxes laying around and open them for random items
---
For a week until you beat it lmfao.  "Go get this thing for me" the game.
---
Firstly, I‚Äôm not speaking for others. I‚Äôm just speaking for me. If other ‚Äúpeople‚Äù share my gameplay style or opinion, then that‚Äôs on them. 
---
Now, getting to the main point of your response, there is one inherent flaw with it that makes the final point irrelevant. Your argument assumes 1. That there is an objective (I.e. factual) way to both play this game and 2. In this specific instance, there is a proper and factual protocol to properly farm legendary enemies. 
---
Unfortunately, neither of these are true; thus negating your entire argument. 
---
It is clear that your opinion (and I stress the word opinion) is that farming WS is boring and not correct. To reiterate, I‚Äôm only speaking for myself, but I find farming WS enjoyable. And that is not incorrect, as it is purely subjective, not objective. 
---
I enjoy farming WS over and over again. I‚Äôve been doing it since level 35 and 300 levels later, I still find it rather cathartic. And there‚Äôs nothing fucking wrong with that.
---
&gt; hate boners 
---
Bethesda has basically committed fraud with F76 and you're saying we got hate boners?
---
And a superhero landing!
---
I'm considering getting one already. I don't want to be part of this if Hines' words have no worth.
---
You sure can. I'd like to know how those fuckers got to keep my favorite mine.
---
It's fun. When the free weekend happened, I can't tell you how many people playing for free that weekend told me that they felt misled by the hate hype train, and then went on to buy the game because they had so much fun.
---
Also, a lot of the outrage clickbait you're hearing and seeing reported out there is either just completely wrong, or is an exaggeration. If you try the game, you'd find that out too.
---
You were also quick to assume that my comment was targeted, it isn‚Äôt, this is my own opinion to the majority.
---
The only reason there‚Äôs media coverage about this, is because specifically it‚Äôs F76. That‚Äôs a bullshit reason to cry. When it is literally identical to many other things h that NOBODY is addressing. Hypocrisy is not okay, it doesn‚Äôt matter what game, topic, opinion someone has. It‚Äôs not okay period.
---
&gt;  At best, they offer minor convenience
---
exactly, it's not a cosmetic, thus making it fraudulent
---
I'm not really sore about it - it was just a bit of a surprise. Normally if I join a friend's private server I fast travel to them and ask if it's okay. So far my friends have been fine with it. I didn't do that right away this time so I don't blame them.
---
It's simple for me:
---
I accepted that tedious inventory management was a technical issue they would improve when they could.
---
I accepted that server performance was a technical issue they would improve when they could.
---
Now they want me to pay $22 a month for unlimited stash space and stable servers.
---
They can get fucked.
---
You‚Äôre trying to make a passive aggressive ‚Äúaha!‚Äù Point using a very overused anecdote for visual flair. Unfortunately, the logic doesn‚Äôt apply here. 
---
Save that analogy for when it can actually be correlative. Find one of the many posts where the original poster is a Bethesda fanboy. Then you‚Äôre analogy might actually apply and perhaps even make some sense. 
---
As it stands, it‚Äôs just wannabe snarky drivel that doesn‚Äôt apply to anything. 
---
It‚Äôs like asking someone what they‚Äôre favorite ice cream flavor is and you‚Äôre response is ‚ÄúWednesday.‚Äù
---
Yeah I thought the 3d glasses looked ok but the other 2 are really far from your eyes
---
All comments to do with sincere complaints about this fallout first bull are being downvoted. I am 34 years old and I don't know what the fuck happened that people accept this. I love this game too everyone but I very much dislike the current state of affairs.
---
This is probably the best way to do it. I normally "check-in" with them right away to see if it's okay or not. Usually my friends have been fine with but I certainly don't blame them for wanting to take advantage of the 'Private' server.
---
As someone that picked up a 1st sub, I hope they make the scrap bin generally available ASAP.  Reducing the number of instanced junk items, even if just in a stash strikes me as good design.
---
After Fallout 1st was added, I went back to playing Fallout 4.
---
Absolutely. Had it been a free update I‚Äôd have reason to re-download, but I‚Äôve only been given more reason to leave it off my hard drive for now.
---
I was about to purchase and play FO76...  BFV got old and COD looks like 2009. I legit bought a PS4 to play Fallout 4...and was ready to explore 76. But I am not sulporting this game after watching the timeline of issues and lack of support. Especially with this last move to squeeze out extra cash from remaining players.  Suck a fat dink
---
I see you and your Tesla
---
here's an idea: change your icon/outfit
---
magic
---
He/she probably wanted to farm all the flux and materials for themselves and not have to share.
---
It would make a ton of sense for it to work on both, so of course, it does not.
---
It can have impact..they will continue to put out content that you have to pay for. Companies will continue to put out trash when they see people eat it up and ask for seconds. We'll have to see what they do next. "NPCS that only talk to 1st members" it could happen
---
The first day Private Server's went live I joined a friend's private server and claimed one of his workshops. Afterward, the next time I saw him he told me his was genuinely surprised to see me as he for sure thought it would be Private / Invite only. However, he was cool with it and said he didn't mind that I joined his server.
---
This time I neglected to check-in with my friend first and they had just nuked WS so I certainly don't blame them for blocking me.
---
They are Nikolai, king of the ash
---
Yeah, I usually fast travel to them and ask if it's okay. I didn't this time and he had just nuked WS so I don't blame him.
---
private means private. if somebody barged into my server I'd be livid. if they wanted to play with you they'd send you a team request.
---
Dense and fireproof. I'm damn near invulnerable to explosive damage.
---
I'll be looking for ya
---
You're absolutely right. The first few times I did it I asked them if it was okay and they were fine with it. This time I didn't ask and also they had just nuked WS. If the roles were reversed I would have done it too.
---
It‚Äôs not just you. Happened to me two days in a row. They will hey over it eventually.
---
Me
---
Thanks for framing it way - it makes total sense. Normally my friends have been fine with it but I usually ask first. This time I didn't so I don't blame them.
---
I like how Bethesda literally divided the community into factions against each other over their mismanagement of this game. They should just enable PvP in adventure mode and make all Fallout 1st players be in one faction and everyone else be in the other. They really are like an incompetent real world version of Vault-Tec.
---
Ya i thought about but I like them a lot
---
But same bugs as last year. I had a CTD in 20 minutes, mobs still don't take damage sometimes, I got stuck in a wall from fast traveling to someone's camp, all for the low price of $100!
---
So 2 v 2000 ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Housekeeping?  
---
But yeah, usually I go to them and ask first but this time I didn't. I would have done the same.
---
One mans trash is another mans treasure. How do you even deal w/ the bugs and the nonsense?
---
76 is nothing but a really cruel mistress.
---
Oh thanks, I was running out of salt, now I don't have to go to the store.
---
Sure - with an extra $9 you can have snow ! Wanna bet this suggestion turns into paid stuff?
---
then don't act surprised when people gang up on you?
---
i don't care.
---
It's a buggy mess! And atm the contents really not there. Sure it's supposed to be coming, but I'm not so sure itll end up all that much different. Theres more than enough reason to not like it and not buy it. 
---
But now heres why you SHOULD absolutely get it. It's another fallout world to explore, and a very new experience. It's really good if you really wanna feel like you're in the world (at least for a while). If you're really into the fallout universe and just want some more of it, then this is a solid buy. Plus I got it for under $20, which is a totally reasonable price for it. I play it constantly and I'm very very glad I got it. But if this were to be someone's first fallout game, I dont think they'd ever buy another.
---
I just have discord for all my friends in game for easier communication
---
Yes, with an extra $9 to your fallout 1st subscription you can initiate some events more than once
---
 **Not to boast (in fact, admitting to having that many hours invested into ANY video game is nothing to be proud of),** 
---
The way I understand it is that in any MMO Lite game 1000h+ is the normal. Crossed that threshold in Warframe but sitting on about 300h in Destiny 2 so some ways to go there. My FO76 hours need some work but I am waiting on the new DLC to get back into it properly.
---
You paid for access to the online service, not to be escorted through like royalty to protect those fragile feelings. Everybody interrupting your enjoyment also paid for the game and is equally entitled to enjoy it in their own way. If they are breaking the rules they agreed to, report them. Otherwise they can do what they want
---
Didn‚Äôt think it would ever happen in the first place.
---
Flux comes in different colors. Could use that as an ingredient.
---
They should stop coming here then.
---
Bethesda breaths nothing but negativity.
---
Everything they do is shit and never provide convenience items people want or the P. servers folks want and give anything people need.
---
All they do is take take take.
---
I‚Äôve checked them all multiple times, none are marked as on :/
---
I'm playing fallout 76 and outer worlds. I bought a month of fo1st. I enjoy them. Don't play what you don't enjoy mate.
---
no offense but that's pretty naive on your part to say the least.
---
it's like going for a stroll in a dangerous neighborhood flaunting a fat stack of 100s and then being surprised when the obvious happens: you get beaten up and robbed.
---
I've heard it's a 7 day player timer, but the first player who enters a cell determines what spawns there so it isn't immediately obvious. With private servers it will be easier to tell and the mechanics should become less opaque there shortly.
---
Thanks Todd!
---
It'll never end. Bethesdas stupidity shall continue to draw anger here. May as well leave.
---
Nothing convenient ever comes to 76 and bugs galore. idk how you guys deal w/ them.
---
Yeah. Is it just some trading acquaintance? Because there are levels of friendship in game. Trading friends, friends who you join in server and are friendly when you run into them, and then discord pals who you run as a group with.
---
Lol atom shop troll
---
Lol what a guy
---
There is an edit button on these Reddit posts for a reason so typographical errors in posts can be corrected. 
---
OF course he cares what we think....
---
As this is not Total Recall, you cannot assume to know or even slightly ascertain what my mind actually cares about. But I can assure with 100% certainty that the opinion of ANYONE on Reddit, up to and including Todd Howard or even Steve Huffman, means jackshit to me. 
---
Actually, I take that back. So long as the opinion is hateful, juvenile, immature, nonsensical, then I welcome it. 
---
My enjoyment in the agitation if others notwithstanding, my post was written for 2 reasons:
---
1. Because I was bored. 
---
2. Reading people get so worked up over a fucking video game and subsequent micro transaction addition is entertaining on more levels than I can count, and I wanted to throw in a viewpoint that I held which was somewhat but not entirely unique. Couldn‚Äôt care less if it was downvoted or upvoted or even got a single comment. Like I said. I was bored.
---
Yes i have all 5 with finished builds
---
Because I still enjoy the game? Sorry for having fun and having a different opinion than you?
---
I went through at least a dozen at this point. focusing on 2 at the moment + mules.
---
Thank you for the feedback. I didn't Fallout 1st members really felt that way. Initially, when private servers just came out, I joined out of curiosity. However, I now better understand the etiquette involved and will ask first.
---
Now that's impressive
---
Are you saying ‚Äúthis guy Is a full time shill‚Äù? Or this Guys, is a full time shill‚Äù? And what are you meaning by that
---
I'm still on my first character, but I'm planning on making a new one when Wastelanders comes out.
---
That sounds like the way to go. Thanks for the advice!
---
The tent is bigger than you think.  It makes Excavator unnecessary except for farming Luck Hole.  It makes picking up EVERYTHING fine.  It means I am always just a few feet away from being unencumbered.  It changes how I play the game significantly.  It‚Äôs a huge bonus, especially in conjunction with the scrapbox. 
---
Now if it won‚Äôt delete my junk again, I‚Äôll be happy.
---
&gt;Should I wait for more content?
---
Yes, wait til next year.
---
&gt;Is the game still buggy?
---
Yes
---
&gt;I just don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth my time.
---
Depends what you expect from it. There aren't really nice quests or endgame. But if your thing is to explore it isn't bad.
---
 Auf Wiedersehen
---
Maybe the people who don‚Äôt like the game and don‚Äôt like Bethesda should leave a subreddit names r/fo76 dedicated to playing the game?  Jesus, it‚Äôs so pathetic seeing the amount of people hanging around and shit talking on alts.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if you love the game. I enjoy the game a lot, but I can‚Äôt agree with how Bethesda is treating their customers and fans. They have lied to us multiple times. It‚Äôs not about whether or not it‚Äôs ‚Äúworth‚Äù it, it‚Äôs that it is a disgusting business model.
---
You know that if you don‚Äôt retaliate, they can‚Äôt hurt you?
---
This post is the pinnacle of ignorance
---
&gt; you're simply conspiratorial and ignorant.
---
Except it has happened before
---
You justified paying for a private server because it gives you a better "whitespring experience". My counter argument is that exploring the rest of the map for random encounters will not only give you a better experience without worrying about the spawns being taken by other players (which is what you said you have a problem with). You will find better and more common legendaries by roaming between random encounter locations than you ever will by running back and forth between houses at whitespring.
---
This is my farming rotation https://i.imgur.com/6ASo0tF.jpg you should check out these places and make your own judgment. The map pack is from the mappalachia project. https://m.imgur.com/a/4Js8sCY

Want to piss Bethesda off? Point out how much better Fallout New Vegas is than most anything they ever put out themselves.

I got 2 characters. My old Level 7 character from BETA who has since been turned into a mule, and my main Level 133 character who's a true chad in every way possible. 
---
I mean, techincally I actually have 3 characters since there's also my brother's character, but that's not exactly 'my' character so I'm leaving him out ^^sorry ^^pierre
---
They moved Outer Worlds. Grass is way greener there. Why stay here and bitch when you can quit 76 and play Outer worlds. Its not that this FO 1st thing isnt the end of the world, Outer Worlds is the beginning of a new chapter :D
---
A way better chapter.
---
I think if you get it about a month before wastelanders comes out you will avoid hitting the wall, so to speak.

You are bored because you literally just sit in whitespring for hours and hours. I would be bored to tears if I did that. Go hunt down a sheepsquatch and give the ghouls a rest okay?
---
lol how many stories can you normally have in a camp building? lol
---
The game itself :D
---
No convenience at all really.
---
Im right there with you. I truly love this gme despite its quirks nd have always played honestly and love to help out when i can, but this is getting ridiculous. So many money grabs its sick. Started replaying 4 just for the hell of it because atleast it doesnt shove atom stuff or subscriptions in my face. Plus free mods!
---
The thing is, the new COD is actually good and DOESN‚ÄôT have micro-transactions like 76 does.
---
Specifically which other RPG are you referring to? I'm a little rusty on release dates, but I want to say "FNV"?
---
is it wrong that i know exactly what it is every time i see a meme like this
---
This and I already spent all that time playing loot tetris and bulking stuff so that It was easier to manage.  It makes no sense to limit bulked scrap to my regular stash.
---
Maybe, just maybe, the haters that came only to complain and don't even play the game, left and those who actually play thr game remain. Put the Tinfoil hat down buddy.
---
That‚Äôs understandable, no one is gonna play a game if there is nothing to do, hopefully wastelanders doesn‚Äôt disappoint
---
Outer Worlds shall be your new home. fill that Fallout void with it.
---
I‚Äôd rather play a modded and laggy New Vegas on my shitty laptop.
---
Im sooo glad i started playing at the release date, so i didn't have the best part of the game totally ruined by people gifting me everything. That was the best part.... the fear &amp; uncertainty. Trying to survive out in the wasteland with crappy guns &amp; stimpak worries.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt use my main either. OP is right tho. Bethesda has lost its way and wants to squeeze everything out of its fans.
---
You fucking what
---
That's the problem... when you still "enjoy" the game after Toddy quite literally rammed a rusty, disease-ridden dildo with 5 inch nails into your ass and then pleasantly told you that all the blood and pain doesn't exist and are imaginary and they are working on an even bigger dildo (this time without spikes) but you have to pay extra for it... 
---
There's something wrong with you...
---
Very impractical, though. It's really hard on the knees, y'know.
---
I‚Äôm not new to reddit. This is a new account as I deleted my old account a couple of months ago. I‚Äôve been mostly lurking since but the recent fallout first announcement made me want to vent.
---
Why not use it? Why hide and be afraid? It‚Äôs an opinion... I‚Äôd respect a persons opinion laid out respectfully but this hiding and a new account... not buying it at all...
---
Now *this* is the Top of the World!
---
Lurking so trolling... got it...
---
I think they are just trying to make things up at this point to complain about.
---
They're called mods, people still play New Vegas primarily. I've been playing fallout 4 for 2 years with no serious breaks.
---
A week ü§£
---
How long until he deletes his comment, I wonder?
---
Ignore all the do-gooder helper folks. It will ruin the best part of the game for you. Don't accept gifts.
---
It‚Äôs such a fantastic game. Feels like the Fallout 4 we never got
---
Do people on an anonymous service really make alt anonymous accounts just to troll? Seems redundant
---
Don't let my cynical view on things get to you :)  
---
Sarcasm is my foil against corporate greed. I hope you got your money's worth of entertainement out of FO76.  
---
I have to disagree in one point however: You do not need clairvoyance to know a game will most likely turn out "meh" if it isn't an offline single player game or a full fledged MMO, but a "live service". The number of live service games that are really good and offer long term engagement is quiet limited. There is no reason that would benefit the player/customer why a game should be a live service. The only benefits are for companies, like data collection and online-shops for after-sales-monetization through not-so-micro transactions.  
---
Speaking for myself, I am also very cautious with pre-orders now although I still do them if I want to support a good company - lastest example CDPR and "Cyberpunk 2077 which I pre-ordered on GOG.  
---
However I also added to that list "no live service games". I think live services is a trend that'd best be stopped.
---
I will wait some time after release when other player test them and Bethesda have time to fix :)
---
Honestly, I can understand why you would think I‚Äôm trolling but I‚Äôm not. I get the feeling that no matter what I say to you, you‚Äôre still going to say I‚Äôm trolling. This is just the way that I feel about a Bethesda right now and wanted to see what other people thought.
---
&gt; complaining is useless and pointless. No good comes from that.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_crash_of_1983
---
In 1983 people started complaining the current video games sucked and stopped buying them. Which created gaming as you know it by encouraging competition and the need for a better product.
---
I fully agree with nixahmose's comment as well, and to the OP's rationale's stated, while some may "justify" why they bought the sub for these reasons, I would counter the armor, the crafting and heck, half the cosmetics you can unlock for free* in FO4, or using the DLCs or mods on your own "private server" (desktop) without shelling out $100 a year. 
---
Mind you, I think ALL of this could have been free, and I too can see why someone would want any of these perks, but again; selling out to a model which was promised never to come to FO76 reinforces Bethesda's turncoat attitude. It allows them to do a 180 and betray the player. If you want these mystical no-limits, unlimited cosmetics and private Servers with free fast-travel, play FO4 and let's mod it up. 76 was a cheap port of FO4 anyways.
---
i play solo on private servers sooooo its all just me!
---
That‚Äôs cuz there‚Äôs still a timer for items to spawn for you that was implemented back around April. And take it like this the game isn‚Äôt running smoother because he‚Äôs paying it‚Äôs smoother because the load on the server is less then public servers because now a lot of the things that had to be ran server side doesn‚Äôt need to account for 20 people and possibly some features are being ran on your Xbox now seeing how people have some bad connections on private servers.
---
Just use pacifist mode in settings. I have an alt account that‚Äôs level 20-30 and see the same things from mid 100s players daily lately.
---
They shoot at you hoping you don‚Äôt know better.
---
Crouching and fast traveling elsewhere has been handy.
---
Forget Bethesda. I did. Go spend all that extra time with your g/f instead of experiencing almost inevitable frustration at the still lingering bugs, glitches, disconnects, etc. this game will likely continue to dole out.
---
So you‚Äôre going to a Reddit for a game you don‚Äôt even play to complain to people that play the game that you won‚Äôt play it.......owww. That hurts my brain a little. 
---
I enjoy the game. The environments are beautiful and sometimes haunting. The music and sound effects are amazing. When I‚Äôve got my headphones on and blasting the game still gets me. I don‚Äôt care how many people don‚Äôt like it. I don‚Äôt mix ethics with my gaming. 
---
Stuff I enjoy always costs money. I, as a consumer decide whether or not that monetary sum is equal to or less than my enjoyment of said item/experience. 
---
I don‚Äôt protest outside of car dealerships if I Think their vehicles are not worth what they‚Äôre selling them for
---
I love the game.  I played and beat outer worlds this weekend and every second of it I kept thinking how much cooler that game could be with 78‚Äôs game mechanics
---
How absent any semblance of a life you have must be crippling. Playing a game *at home*, **ALONE**, affects literally anyone? That's not even trolling, that's pretending you're trolling.
---
If you can be fueled by people being genuinely upset for being lied to and cheated you should be running a hyper-Tesla-Amazon-Disney mega corporation because the world is overflowing with them. But, more realistically, if you think anyone cares what you play or don't enough to affect their personal choices you are narcissistic in the extreme.
---
Take a break from electronics dude, you are headed towards a very bleak future.
---
I want to know when they're gonna give up on it and release an offline version. Hopefully next year!
---
I see someone is in California
---
watch them nerf canned dog food because you mentioned this.
---
Timing combined with a new account jumping on the passive aggressive bandwagon... and yes it is trolling by coming to a subreddit that supports the game... you don‚Äôt support it and like others don‚Äôt like the current 1st deal. 
---
IF you wanted to know what others thought you‚Äôd read the hundreds of posts in this very subreddit about it... both pros and cons... 
---
Want to know how a lot of people feel? They‚Äôre tired of the negativity in game and in real life and want an escape... 
---
That‚Äôs literally my honest answer.
---
^that ^^wasn‚Äôt ^^^me ^^^^that ^^^^^was ^^^^^^patricia
---
Having 10 bucks a month to spend on something I like makes me a whale. Learn something new everyday.
---
Alright if you're playing a game you have to pay to make it fun to play, why the hell are you playing it?
---
I think you can...you simply can‚Äôt run.
---
You do realize all games come out with unforeseen bugs? Fallout 3 vegas and 4 still haven‚Äôt had all their bugs patched but by modders it had been, you everyone complaining is about it not being like single player fallouts. Let‚Äôs see you do your job without faults cuz I can pretty much tell you you can‚Äôt. Nothings ever perfect games included.
---
Maybe just me and no one else cares.  Either way I feel more relaxed somehow.
---
Precisely!  Premium as of October and no verified Email.  Looks less than legit.

I‚Äôve got three characters. A Rifleman, a Heavy, and a Commando.

I am a neutral dude that decided to look into it myself rather than trust his word for it..
---
And this dude seriously might be so; exclusively posting like 100 posts per day, zero criticizing a single thing about the game.
---
I hate people who call someone a shill, but that account is **seriously** sketchy..
---
You do know that Bethesda has been tolerating mods this whole time... Right? Name one person who has been banned for using mods.
---
I've been playing for 1900 hours with over a dozen mods from nexusmods.com installed, like Perk Loadout Manager, glowing bags, 3D surround sound, health percentages, better inventory, you name it.. In addition to the custom.ini tweaks you can change to make the game run smoother, like no main menu music and disabling depth of field.
---
But people don‚Äôt see that they just want without thinking will it work.
---
From my own hunting: all hats are very common. However I've only found various copies of White and Blue uniforms, no other clean variants so far.
---
Patches were typically non existent because they weren't "needed"
---
An incredible example is Batman Arkham Knight. [Pulled From Steam (And Others)](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/06/batman-arkham-knight-for-pc-pulled-from-steam-and-retailers-due-to-bugs/) for Performance issues. 15 years ago this just didn't happen. It did however because of cutting corners to cut costs all for the sake of pleasing investors.
---
Hardware can't really be blamed, we still have only two main processor manufactures and one less GPU maker (Voodoo) but because they "can" they "do"
---
I agree revenue does need to come in, but before it was done (and some what still is) through sales of quality AND quantity, Valves TF2/Counter Strike are a great example as Counter Strike was widely available, and TF2 turned into a F2P that makes tons of money off of it's own store/market place.
---
That's encouraging! I bought the Gamepass and have the game loaded up.  I'll have using my day off to get that rolling and see what the hub bub is about.
---
Hi todd
---
 A 7 year old shouldn't be playing this. This is not wholesome is fucking worrying.
---
No, once you get to about 1800 lbs on your person you cannot trade anymore and cannot pick up new items. That's where the stupid  infinite mine glitch is coming from. People hit the max carry weight then drop a nuke mine and it glitches by dropping a copy of the item and still keeping it in your inventory.
---
Hey are you the same guy managing the Washington post tik tok account
---
The sad thing about all of this is that I still hope Bethesda turn it around. I really want 76 to succeed but I just feel dejected now.
---
&gt;For a week until you beat it lmfao.  "Go get this thing for me" the game.
---
As someone who has loved the Fallout series since the days of old.. *that is literally every RPG game?*
---
I'm sure Todd Howard would criticize the game at all. Thank you for your input.
---
It shows bethesda people will buy it. It makes them more likely to do similar things to future titles. You know why microtransactions, live service elements, and the stuff plaguing 76 right now are even a thing at all? Because people bought them.
---
"Its just one guy buying one month! It wont hurt!"
---
"Its just one utility item in the atom shop. Repair kits wont hurt!"
---
"Pfft. Its just repair and scrap kits"
---
"Repair, scrap kits, and a fridge"
---
...and a scrap gathering robot.
---
...and a premium subscription.
---
The game keeps getting worse, because people keep supporting this. 
---
Whatever you believe, this is the reason why bethesda is doing this, because people are buying into it.
---
Don't anwser to him , he's either trolling or conviced, it's a dead end.
---
Not sure. Seen several for sale in different vendors the past couple of days. I guess they pulled one out of a dev room, duped it like mad, and went crazy.
---
I know my old plan doesn't work, so.
---
Do the mothman dance
---
Man sorry i didn't read it in the first place, you are right tho now that i read it
---
If you really forgot Bethesda, you wouldn‚Äôt be posting here.  ü§î
---
Well, good for you then.
---
To be fair, when I completed story line, I told my friend that this "everybody dies" thing would be better if that was solo game, so you are the only person alive in entire state
---
^Good ^luck ^^getting ^^them ^^^in ^^^private ^^^^servers ^^^^^dickhead
---
Are you autistic? People have been asking for that since day one and the only thing the community has gotten is a 7 dollar refrigerator and other shit nobody cares about. 
---
It really blows my mind how dumb some people are that post this stuff
---
If you weren't invited don't be that dude that randomly shows up
---
Even a fun game can become shit behind a paywall that the customer was  told was never going to happen. They basically put out a game that was not even alpha ready at $60 with a promise that they would fix it and they would never do atoms in the atom shop for any game mechanic just skins along with no paywall for DLC's or game mechanics. Low and behold it was a lie and them putting game mechanics in the atom shop was just a precursor since there was not enough of an uproar. Now you have to pay over $100 annually for the game you were supposed to get for 1 price of $60 and a promise of never having a paywall. Basically the people who pay for that are the epitome of a fool and their money are soon parted. We belived their shit over and over and looked over some of their lies and now look where it gets us.
---
Have you shot a BE Gatling Plasma?
---
When we have private servers that can run off out own hardware and actually be fully modable, then I'll come back to it.
---
But will there be enough good content to spend all those atoms. And new content to make you play it one more year?
---
We will bring it back, if you have money to pay for it  :)
---
I believe it is 1,500 lbs plus your natural carry weight.
---
Watoga!  Of course.  Why didn‚Äôt I think of it...
---
Three words: smoked mirelurk fillets.
---
) she gets her own room :) seems fair
---
How do you differentiate?
---
That sounds right, my carry weight is around 300
---
I love and enjoy the game so far as well despite the number of bugs in it. I would also pay for a 1 year fallout 1st membership despite the hate its getting. Why? Because I paid hundreds for atoms previoudly so the fee is comparable to those 5000 atom bundles. 
---
However,  I think including the unlimited scrap stash within a pay wall was a really bad move. Like everyone have issues with weight and then they charged to resolve it. Because not everyone is going to pay for the membership after all.. 
---
I somehow think this is going alienate a number of players just like what happened to Diablo 3 with the auction house system. People hated it.
---
I have read what others feel about the game but I also wanted to vent about this game as well as there is no one in my social circle that plays or cares about this game anymore.
---
I used to support this game, I used to roleplay play as this character https://twitter.com/father_shadow
---
I even set up a twitch account to find people that loved the game because I thought Bethesda would turn it around.
---
The bottle cap mine was removed from game. Unless a recent patch inadvertently added them back, which is very possible
---
Because people like you who reward this type of behavior have ruined our chances of ever seeing another Elder Scrolls title that is on par with Skyrim.
---
One of my friends I've played with since the first few weeks of the game bought the subscription...
---
I drop all the junk I gather to him everytime he logs on.
---
Already has more steel than you could ever want and flux for generations...
---
Silos run smooth as fuck and we take down the SBQ in 10minutes on a good run.
---
But the world is so empty.. and there isn't anything to do...
---
This really needed to be released with Wastelanders... An actual reason to play alone
---
Yeah the stash should of been for everyone. It‚Äôs the main reason I subscribed
---
16 times the canvas
---
Blizzard is silencing players for speaking out against China's equivalent of the *literal* Nazi government. People are all shitting on Blizzard for it.
---
Video games **today** are so vastly accessible that their ethics or quality don't matter anymore; some people just don't give a fuck and have too much money to spend. They keep these developers afloat regardless of mass discontent.
---
Sounds like a plan
---
It used to be that you just couldn‚Äôt move at all at that weight.  Now you can only destroy items to get underweight (or add weight carrying perk cards) to get out of this, which is an odd mechanic. I guess it was changed this way to prevent a method of duping.
---
It already has led to worse. You understand if the pay subscription was there from the start it would be a whole diff story. They said there would be nothing but skins for the atom shop and that we would not have to pay for DLC's or game mechanics. That all has already gone out of the window. To get better servers and game mechanics we now have to pay annually $100 for a game that we already had to pay $60 that had promised us we would not have these fees. Its bait and switch and might even be illegal
---
The recon armor stolen from new Vegas. Also the icon that comes with the subscription. These people allow Bethesda‚Äôs greed to proliferate.
---
They need to know they are not welcome outside of their private servers. 
---
We will not stop until bethesda responds. 
---
Dm me if you want to join the network.
---
"Build the pay wall! Build the pay wall!" - Trump. Probably.
---
Says the account with a literal random generated bot name.
---
The workaround is to sell the items to a robot vendor and have a friend buy them from the vendor if you don't have anything you want to destroy.
---
My theory is most the people calling them out are now enjoying The Outer Worlds, like myself, and couldn‚Äôt care less about Bethesda‚Äôs BS
---
IM CALLING IT! 
---
You work for Bethesda. 
---
HOLY SHIT THE SYNTHS ARE AROUND US ANYONE COULD BE A BETHESDA EMPLOYEE
---
god forbid go to THE fallout76 site  google takes you to see whats up before throwing your wallet at it. sure he/she can have an opinion rightfully so,
---
Cool.  I only hit this once, and I was able to get out of it with cards, but that‚Äôs another option for when it happens next time.
---
Oh, well look at Mr Moneybags over here with his fancy lunch
---
People gotta stop saying DLC it isn‚Äôt DLC content &amp; DLC is still free. A collectron robot that gets 12 junk per HOUR &amp; a fridge that you can get in-game (the fridge backpack mod) isn‚Äôt pay to win or breaking promises lol. Also private servers are not ‚Äúbetter servers‚Äù than adventure just convenient to not have to deal with a crowd in activities. Also it isn‚Äôt illegal at all lol. I get you‚Äôre frustrated but that isn‚Äôt ‚Äúled to worse‚Äù. It‚Äôs a NV reskin, $16 worth of atoms, a tent that you can scrap at &amp; put away stuff (plenty of places to do that in-game already) &amp; private servers that are recycled &amp; sometimes mess up your loot routes because there‚Äôs dead bodies laying around already
---
I haven't paid a cent and don't own the dumb fridge. Don't buy it if you don't want it.
---
Then scrap them down to scrap and stuff them in the bin.
---
 No, it‚Äôll break the game.
---
I haven't paid any money for this game nor have I bought items like the refrigerator. How am I supporting bad decisions?
---
If those two items weren‚Äôt in the subscription I definitely wouldn‚Äôt be subscribed right now.
---
It was meant to be hyperbole, but it was lost on this crowd
---
The camp does more than that.  It make being encumbered a non-issue in the wild.
---
immature? you just admitted doing this and playing out of spite lol
---
This is the Urban Dictionary‚Äôs definition of ‚ÄúPay to Win‚Äù:
---
pay-to-win
---
Games that let you buy better gear or allow you to make better items then everyone else at a faster rate and then makes the game largely unbalanced even for people who have skill in the game without paying.
---
The introduced paid elements do not correspond with the Pay to Win model.  They don‚Äôt allow for better gear and you don‚Äôt level up faster.  The most important part is the changes don‚Äôt ‚Äúmake the game largely unbalanced for people who have skill in the game‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs ‚Äúpay for convenience‚Äù
---
I've been defending this game for so long now, delete that shit and move on is the remedy.
---
Your dick must be yuge.
---
Does everyone already know specifically what activates God Mode? I don't want to blab it out, but there's a super easy way to prevent it.
---
I crash in Fallout 4, NV, and Skyrim more than any other game. It‚Äôs just the nature of the engine. I think trying to make such a game multiplayer-enabled was ambitious but really unfeasible. Here‚Äôs hoping they suck enough money out of the people playing this game to fund the shit out of the next elder scrolls game.
---
Nobody asked you skinny. Move along
---
Stable??? I've been kicked or not found a server since doing the one month trial ü§£ü§£
---
I gave up on Beth after FO3. I will never give them another cent of my money.
---
Don't lump ESO in this mess. That game is amazing and is regularly updated with content not behind a BS paywall.
---
I had douchebags rip me off, fools crashing servers for dupes, servers crashing for no reason and randomly losing loot to crashes throughout my year run...
---
Still love the game. The world I great and it's Fallout... I love Fallout.
---
I try to stay positive that they will go in the right direction eventually
---
Anybody could say anybody did something. Nothing happened to you unless  you got videos or screenshots as proof.
---
You figured it out! Nice pic :) photo mode can be a lot of fun
---
Don't feel weird, it's all good.
---
For me... I always have voice chat off, always afraid some people use it to insult other players, and to be honest, a lot of sound and music already in the game. And although I mostly do my own thing in Fallout76, I try to wave at other players when crossing their paths, especially lower levels.
---
Some players don't wave back and just leave the area ASAP, but a lot of them do wave back. I just think... most of the player base who aren't already teaming up prefer to play this game as if it's a single player game. That's what I also do, single player... but I had some cool random events happen already, and haven't been playing that long. 2 high level players randomly helping me while I was on a mission I shouldn't have tried while being still low level, and another time during an event, unofficially teaming up with a stranger, helping me kill the Mirelurk Queen and the ton of other Mirelurks swarming you all at once. Players who have completed that public event know what I'm talking about ;). We did it lol, killed everything and completed the event, after dying a few times each and wasting almost all bullets in all my guns, but we did it. 2 low level strangers getting it done. :)
---
Just keep playing and you'll experience some other cool moments. Try to forget about the rare not-so-cool moments when there's grieving and you'll be alright. :) Have fun and thanks for sharing !
---
Good point üòÇ I‚Äôm quite envious that 76 hasn‚Äôt worked out quite like ESO
---
After reading all the comments.. i can only say that Bethesda you have made great games in the past, but now this is the moment you sadly lost most of your true fans and i think you gotta do something really LIKE REALLY different to get them back which i doubt will never happen.
---
My one build is rifleman and commando. I just switch out perks when I'm low on ammo for something. And I think melee will be awesome! Theres some super powerful stuff, and you don't gotta be worrying about ammo (which is a ton of my storage)
---
get rekd
---
Content is not still free Show me where a refrigerator is free and the scrap robot is free or the new mechanics are free. Take just the Atom shop which we were told would only be for skins but nope a lie. Now all the stuff for the paid member shit is also not free it's behind a paywall that we were told would never happen. That is the big issue we get told one thing and then they lie about it. If they were up front about everything from the beginning there would not be such a big uproar but they bring it on themselves. Not to mention how everyone who bought this game has been sticking up for them even for how shitty this game has been with the bugs and everything and then they are like hey guess what fuck you here is a paywall. Bait and switch is illegal If they tell you one thing as todd did and then do something else It's a bait and switch which is illegal. Bait and switch is a form of fraud  used in retail sales but also employed in other contexts. We were baited by being told that We would not have a paywall for game mechanics only for skins the switch is the annually payment we must pay now for the new mechanics and the game mechanics placed in the atom shop.
---
I dunno those glasses look like they're resting on your nose, they're just HUGE.
---
I get bored and just have photoshoots with my character all the time. I enjoy it.
---
I swear I've encountered more bugs today (after the arrival of FO1st) just doing my thing around Appalachia (as a non-subscriber) than I ever did since game launch. I had a non-legendary/elite/special/etc. mob's health reset twice during an encounter and my C.A.M.P just ate my brew station. Had to build a new one.  
---
These kind of problems make me more angry that Bethesda is asking for a subscription before even trying to address some of these bugs and basic stability issues.
---
I‚Äôd never played Fallout before 3 or even heard of it. The first time I played 3, my mind was absolutely blown, I loved that game so much. I used to work at Burger King at the time, I‚Äôd finish my 2-10 shift, go home and play that game until 6am üòÇ
---
ya but NV is better than most AAA RPGs in general so i dont understand why people always have to single out Bethesda on the matter.
---
Because it's fun.
---
I second this, comment history and post history for the past few months has been over 95% fo76 related lmao.  I would not be surprised if bethesda tried to influence overall consumer opinions with overwhelming amounts of fake posts to make consumers accept and join the fake bandwagon.  I quit this game months ago it was such a huge let down for me and I periodically check in to see if they fixed it up but the more I see the more disgusted i am with the company.
---
It goes for more than video games. You own a cellphone? A child was most likely stuffed into a mine and forced to mine the lithium needed for it
---
Your experience is great, i guess. I won't buy this subscription in any way, even if Todd fella present it to me (with wedding ring lol). Nonetheless, it's nice to know this subscription does a pleasure for players.
---
nah according to r/ElderScrolls, every game before Skyrim had no such quests.
---
Your account only exists now since august 2019 and the only topic you posted in was this.
---
In addition you got reddit gold. In the greatest shit storm F76 is encountering. I don't believe this until video proof.
---
Ya I would expect that to happen irl. It‚Äôs the first thought that crosses my mind when I play video games. Ok I don‚Äôt play video games to simulate everyday life just like the other 99% of gamers. Oh u wonder why? Oh it‚Äôs a video game! It‚Äôs all fantasy! Fucking interesting isn‚Äôt
---
So no real consequences.
---
What it means to me is that they'll never increase stash space for the rest of us, they'll never lower the weight of anything and they have no motivation to overcome the technical difficulties for more storage if there even are any. What they've done makes me question if there are difficulties in the first place.
---
They have the financial motivation to make the game less enjoyable to play and that's just not a game worth putting time into
---
I don't blame you for doing it.  It really isn't a bad deal if you are gonna buy atoms anyway.  
---
Will you keep the subscription just for those 2 features?  To me it's MAYBE worth doing once and grinding scrap but that doesn't sound partictularly fun.  Either way we should all have an option to get them.
---
I have 4 (5 but this one is for ranking up a friend. I plan on deleting this one to start a new one when games plus starts)
---
My first one was planned more as a 4 character, moderate strength, intelligence to craft and so on. I'm equipping them as a nuke runner. Ghoul slayer's, troubleshooter and Zealot's armor and playing with all the explosive weapons too. 
---
My 4th is my bloodied character. I have bloodied everything but no explosives yet. Obviously good for pve. 
---
My 2nd build is my support/social character/ middle of the road character. 8's across the board (all my others just have enough charisma to run maxed hard bargain)  this one I use specifically for another friend that hasn't been playing much. 
---
And the 3rd was supposed to be my survival character. Exactly like my first but wasn't supposed to have much inventory to risk with dying. I then was going to switch it to a Wes-Tek grinder. I'm seriously thinking about scrapping this one for an alternative wastelanders build.
---
Appreciate the offer man but I‚Äôm on Xbox. Thanks again tho.
---
logic still applies in videogames, you know. specially if you're dealing with actual people in a multiplayer setting.
---
Yeah can't wait for the Infiltrator/Liberator stuff I have been waiting and hoping for this stuff for awhile. It just adds so many RP options, I know my PLA spy main character will appreciate the hell out of it. Will def be a day one purchase for me, which Beth knows because I yell at them on twitter every time they miss a chance to add something like this(Chinese New Year ect). Really hope I don't have to wait till Wastelanders though.........I really need to Seize the Means of Production lol.
---
I really hope they add more skins as well at least later after what we've seen has been released, would def pay for a Chinese MEC Gauss Minigun skin or a skin for the classic Gauss Rifle &amp; Pistol.
---
It‚Äôs nice when people help you out, especially when it‚Äôs out of the blue, I can‚Äôt wait to experience more of the same from other players out there, I occasionally get the odd wave now and again but that‚Äôs it. I find it really cool and nice when people go out of their way to help others.
---
Lemme guess u play Skyrim with mods that let u do yours taxes don‚Äôt u?
---
They're literally forming hunting parties on the other 76 sub.
---
Speaking of content, it's almost November and you still haven't done the cooking video. You deleting your channel?
---
JB HiFi and Amazon Australia were $60. On release Amazon Australia had the retail price marked as $60, but the actual S.P.E.C.I.A.L. version price was AU$49.**76** and it included Fallout 76 collectable pins:
---
&gt; Fallout 76: S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Edition (Exclusive to Amazon AU) (PC) = AU$49.76  
---
&gt;You will Emerge! Multiplayer finally comes to the epic open world RPGs of Bethesda Game Studios. Create your character with the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system and forge your own path in a new and untamed wasteland with hundreds of locations. Whether you journey alone or with friends, a new and unique Fallout adventure awaits.
---
&gt;Mountain Splendorland! All-new graphics, lighting and landscape technology brings to life six distinct West Virginia regions. From the forests of Appalachia to the noxious crimson expanses of the Cranberry Bog, each region offers its own risks and rewards. Post-nuclear America has never looked so beautiful!
---
&gt;A New American Dream! Use the all-new Construction and Assembly Mobile Platform (C.A.M.P.) to build and craft anywhere in the world. Your C.A.M.P. will provide much-needed shelter, supplies, and safety. You can even set up shop to trade goods with other survivors. But beware, not everyone will be quite so neighborly.
---
Jesus Christ. That‚Äôs kinda funny tho
---
There is also alot of tourists anytime bad news hits and this sub gets flooded by teenagers that thinks it popular to hate on something that would give them upvotes especially once people start making youtuve videos you see the same with EA and once NMS. This game was and still amazing and thats why alot people will support bethesda. Its pretty unique and there arent many choices to scratch the same itch. If you dont support it and dont think it will be better just move on to something new.
---
$22 a month what country are you in? I never see. It that high. Thats almost double the americans.
---
no, just sex mods like everyone else. right?
---
your rationalization doesn't even make sense. just because it's a game that doesn't mean people leave their biases outside the door. they're gonna judge and act the same.
---
I'd love snow, but I'd be worried about falling through the map into the void due to terrain glitches.
---
Huh
---
Yeah, I used to swap cards on my Rifleman to go Commando, but I want them both to be perfectly built, so I really need two characters to do that.  Plus it gives me the chance to customize a new character‚Äôs look, weapons, etc.
---
What?
---
Sure, if it works for you. I played 4 for 600 hours before I  was burned out and done with It. 76 1500 hours and still going on. I just hope will see a lot more new content because next Fallout won't come out for years.
---
Listen if u don‚Äôt have anything to contribute don‚Äôt comment on the post.
---
All I will say id this....Fallout 76 was actually the first game I'd ever bought from Bethesda...the game and all the fiasco that came along with it now including this has more or less ensured that it will also be the last game I ever buy from them.
---
I like Dishonored's way of doing it as well. You can still swim into deep water, but slowly you get mugged by swarms of sea creatures that devour you the more you stay in the water.
---
It also goes against there ‚Äòall updates would be free‚Äô and no pay to win rules they promised us
---
Yeah I completely agree. It doesnt matter what Bethesda does to turn it around you will never undo, to me anyway, the fact that you sold me a full priced product that you KNEW was broken. it's a false economy anyway. Their numbers will never be as good as they would have been for starfield if they hadn't fucked everyone square in the arsehole with one of gamings most beloved franchises.
---
Except in this case you still have to buy the title and the subscription for the full experience
---
Yup - outer worlds here I come!
---
Don‚Äôt get fallout 1st
---
So are you pirating their games or why are you here?
---
The thing about the collectron is its a small amount of random junk, but tied with infinite scrap space over a year it would definitely add up.
---
I am contributing. I'm dishing out facts and telling you how it is. reddit isn't your private server, I mean, hugbox.
---
I understand why you might not believe me but I find it a shame the game has caused so much problems that people think others would make an account just to push PR or just an average troll making this up. There is lots of proof that players mostly have a positive experience while playing the game . In terms of my proof, I don‚Äôt have anything other than her gamer tag, I didn‚Äôt think things would be that bad that I‚Äôll have to record whenever something good happens.
---
Your getting downvoted but I agree that these additions don‚Äôt rock the game.  Junk in stash is not that big of a deal.  You can dump large amounts of junk and in one run somewhere, reliably get a bunch back except flux.   Vault 76 and your camp are free travel points.   There are plenty of scrapping and storage locations.   It‚Äôs just not that big of an advantage.  
---
I guess time will tell if this changes the game and/or it‚Äôs community in such a way as to make the game unenjoyable
---
I think I stopped playing around the time they released the Vault raid? Must've uninstalled around a week or two afterwards after noticing I wasn't playing and I needed the space.
---
I was never really sold on this game, given they departed from the single player model, but after months of bad rep and (allegedly) improvements, I decided to hop on with the free trial.
---
Then I found it on sale for what was basically pocket money and so I dived in. Figured it wasn't as broken as people said it was at launch and the sale price made it not a compromise to bet on it.
---
Having to play with people was... Annoying, at first. There was always someone stealing kills. But soon there was also vets that went around helping newbies, so it wasn't that bad. Though the biggest problem was that I didn't have any group, so I was basically on my own figuring out everything by myself. And the lack of npcs just made walking around boring enough to have me doze off in transit. At this point, I was more in it to build pretty bases and probably getting better PA. Some story quest was so unrelated to everything else I was doing that I literally forgot what the whole main story was about for a good while.
---
I could go on, but it's just... Meh. I was OK with Fallout 4, even with the roleplaying being restricted by the main story as it was, but this one just doesn't work for me. And I don't really feel like waiting around for content that should've been there from the start. Less so if they add even more of said content only available with $.
---
I'll just wait around until they make another SP Fallout, be it Bethesda or someone else
---
Really hope that becomes a reality(Both the robots &amp; your Communist rebirth lol), it would be awesome to have a little flock of Liberators milling about your base. I at least hope we can get a Liberator pet at some point even if it just stayed at CAMP like the current pets. The Infiltrator/Liberator version of the protectron is really nice though, I wonder if it will have new voice lines like the Liberty Prime PA skin, I also really hope the Chinese PA has Chinese voice lines.
---
Also when did naive and hopeful become the same thing?
---
Sorry I hope and expect people to have manners.
---
Oh wait this is the 21st century forgot u millennial fucks threw all that out the window and left ur shit taboos around for us to pick
---
Just done get it, id advise getting outer worlds instead. It‚Äôs like the fallout we never had
---
I patiently wait either a new fallout or new elder scrolls haha
---
I‚Äôll see.  I have to see how Bethesda addresses my lost junk, first and foremost.  I don‚Äôt mind subscribing and supporting the game if I‚Äôm enjoying though.  I‚Äôd like to see what other freebies they are offering as well, like unique outfits and what not.
---
since forever?
---
&gt;u **millennial**
---
you do realize millennials are the easiest to offend, right?
---
Nuclear winter for much ironic it sounds it is in fact a finished mode, but it needs more players I can still find nuclear winter matches but one match I had yesterday I found a guy that I saw on Nuclear winter a week ago
---
Im on ps4 so i cant get a gamepass *sad country road noises*
---
It‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôm afraid

Because you can pay money to make meme-tributes?
---
Could have done the same in just minecraft without having to pay mtx
---
Nuclear winter the mode see.s fine but i mean the update as a whole mostly the adventure stuff
---
Isn't the fight supposed to happen inside the nuke zone? Thought dragging the queen out of the nuke zone and not taking rad damage was considered cheesing?
---
Oh you meant Nuclear winter the DLC ok you're right.
---
Juice head mentioned the idea that there was likely corporate pressure to attach stable income stream to FO76 by the date fo 1st was released.   This would‚Äôve been here in a form anyway.
---
Idc about downvotes tbh it‚Äôs the internet ive never understood those people who edit their comments &amp; make some comment about their downvoted, it‚Äôs the internet there‚Äôs trolls &amp; haters everywhere lol. We‚Äôve played the game this long &amp; enjoyed it without any of these features so now that they‚Äôre in the game they‚Äôre now necessary &amp; game breaking? I mean c‚Äômon man that‚Äôs ridiculous lol. If you hate the subscription &amp; don‚Äôt wanna play anymore? All the best to you, there are plenty of games out there! But you don‚Äôt have to scour the sub &amp; start arguments &amp; get toxic because people enjoy the game &amp; pay money to enjoy the game more. I absolutely hated Black Ops 4 &amp; their rigged supply drop system.. so I stopped playing completely &amp; it actually made me a lot more positive &amp; gave me more time to play my favorite game; Fallout 76 :-) downvotes or not this is my game &amp; I‚Äôll enjoy it subscription or not!
---
Australia, it's $22AUD. Fucking outrageous.
---
Unless I'm wrong, in which case I'd appreciate a time stamp just to know, he addressed seemingly planted reviews for a bottle of rum, not Reddit comments. 
---
I feel it's a safe bet that 95%+ of the positive comments posted in this sub, ever, but even just this past week, come from regular people. Same as the opposed crowd.
---
Nah, it's common practise to lure her out to the drop site now. Every queen fight ive had as of late had happened on the border of the nuke zone or outside at the dropsite, even still I dont understand how the game expects you to survive if it spawns you in a nuke zone right next to the fissure which is where I spawned every single time I died rather than spawning at the drop site which is where I actually died
---
They need to add some power-ups for their 1st Members so they can defend themselves. Ofc they have to buy for that additionally.
---
Oh, btw, do yo guys remember the loot boxes? "vault-Tec Lunch Boxes", wonder when they get released... It will be the next step. Mark my words.
---
As long as you survive this stroke, sure.
---
&gt; They have the financial motivation to make the game less enjoyable to play and that's just not a game worth putting time into
---
Hit the nail on the head mate. It's the point the game went from game to skinner box. If they don't walk it back the game is dead.
---
Why do you still post here if your forgot Bethesda? Doesn‚Äôt make sense...
---
Paid for the game when it first released and now they want to put a subscription bull on it? What kind of stupid are you smoking Bethesda? The sheer arrogance to ask for more funding from this dumpster fire that you've promised SOOOO much on... "16 times the detail, 4 times the size of Fallout 4" was riddled with thousands of bugs, glitches and MAJOR issues with the game that caused people to brick their machines. Do you, Bethesda, REALLY think that people are just going to go "OH HEY! you done a great job with the game! how about I open my wallet to you and let you take $100 on a game that we already paid for!" HA! What a frickin joke... this is like EA level of bullshit that it is actually WORSE.
---
TIP to your PR group...
---
1. fix the fucking game
---
2. do NOT add subs to items that SHOULD BE IN THE FRICKIN GAME
---
3. Don't piss off your customers
---
I'm sorry but I cannot even bring myself to use your product anymore and just like EA, you are on my list of game companies that will not be on my hard drive, anytime soon.
---
I've actually held out hope for Bethesda, but I give up, had enough, not buying another another game from Bethesda. Fix your shit, get your man pants on and DO SOMETHING RIGHT for once!
---
Also am i the only person that still doesnt have the backpack ( im level 80) ive just nevet gotten the kindess badge
---
&gt; stopped buying them.
---
Exactly... Money talks, as opposed to people whinging on a subreddit but paying for it anyway.
---
I'm sorry to hear that about your experience mate, but the overwhelming consensus seems to be that the private servers are very smooth and stable.
---
I enjoyed the first couple hours of Outer Worlds but shortly after getting to the second planet I put it down. 
---
Exploration is unrewarding, faction rep only means better vendor prices, unlimited sprint makes every nonhuman enemy basically harmless as you can outrun them easily, perks don't add depth to a build, and there just isn't a whole lot to do. 
---
The story seems good so far and the gameplay itself is fun but that game is way overhyped.
---
Can‚Äôt there be room for both? It‚Äôs hardly fair to demand people not enjoying the game because of the bullshit. Also, it‚Äôs always pathetic when extremely popular posts like this one writes ‚Äúthis wiki be down voted‚Äù as if it somehow was a minority unpopular opinion lol
---
Lol and what get your $10 back? They didn't false advertise anything you're just ignorant.
---
If you think patches weren‚Äôt done because they weren‚Äôt needed, I don‚Äôt know where you were for Outpost, Battlecruiser 3000, Innocent Until Caught et al. B3K is (used to be?) the poster child for this sort of thing. Arkham Knight was egregious, absolutely- but let‚Äôs not pretend it isn‚Äôt in a fine tradition of games with bugs that shipped because someone needed to pay the rent on the office space.
---
Fallout 1 and 2 were...not shy of bugs themselves, originally.
---
I do think expectations differ now; we expect ongoing support. Which is fair enough, now the infrastructure exists to deliver day one patches etc.
---
A side benefit of this is that we get more complex, better tested games as a result.
---
Anyway. I‚Äôm not a potential buyer for Fallout First. But either this was always going to be a revenue stream, or it‚Äôs been spun that way due to lacklustre performance of the Atom shop. In either case, the money to maintain the game in the medium to long term has to come from somewhere.
---
I guarantee you that there are people who poured their lives into making this game sat at conference room tables every day, working out how to convince other people not to add even more intrusive nonsense. They (and the people they‚Äôre convincing) need to find ways to keep the lights on, so that people like me (and you?) can keep playing the game on live servers for the next few years without spending any more of our money. 
---
Do I think this is the best idea ever? No. But I know people who bought it, and are happy with their choice, and it keeps the game running.
---
Do I have a better idea? Also no. 
---
If the game doesn‚Äôt break even, (or at least not lose money like a faucet‚Äôs open at Scrooge‚Äôs money vault) it‚Äôll close; if they can‚Äôt make that revenue with cosmetics - and I‚Äôm guessing they can‚Äôt - then where else can they get the money from?
---
This ^
---
What is this weird loyalty crap going on with you guys? If a game is good, buy it. If it sucks, dont. Why the sole name of a publisher is what makes you pay for a game and not the quality of the game itself? I for one do not give two shits, if they make a good game I will buy it, if not I wont. Very very simple. I don\`t need to pledge some blood oath a publisher.
---
Already back to supporting bethesda
---
What is it about Fallout 1st that is Pay to win?
---
Why do you say that you think people with the subscription are more casual players?  The guys I know with the subscription are some of the more hardcore players.
---
I thought that the post stated that if Bethesda didn‚Äôt change the way that they were treating their customers/fans then I would eventually give up on Bethesda. I don‚Äôt pirate games. 
---
I know a lot of people still love Bethesda and 76. I‚Äôm not one of the people saying this game is trash etc I‚Äôve put a lot of hours into the game like a lot of people.
---
What I am saying is that if Bethesda keep acting like EA then I‚Äôm done, I imagine a lot of other people feel this way. I don‚Äôt want to give up on Bethesda. This isn‚Äôt a post slating any of the fans or this subreddit. This subreddit at times is amazing, I love reading people‚Äôs stories and what they have got up to in game, I just don‚Äôt like that good nature being taken advantage of because it is, whether we like to admit it or not.
---
We gotta stand for the future of the game m if people Like you help support Bethesda, then we‚Äôve gotta stop you aswell
---
Canvas bag.
---
??? I can't make a post about something in the game I thought was cool?
---
Move along dude.
---
Sure, but what are you going to do with all that scrap?
---
What was false advertised?
---
Huh, they literally lowered the weight of bobble heads and magazines last patch.
---
You mean like with free Wastelanders?
---
I was hoping the private servers were going to be more like community servers from tf2; search for servers and join in one with different plugins and mods.
---
If some rando on my friends list joined my server without asking I'd kick them too. 
---
They paid for it, not you *shrug*. 
---
Private worlds should be invite only, not open to everyone on my friends list.
---
Whats the difference? Planting comments is planting comments. Im not saying its whats happening here, but if they did it before in a smaller site, I wouldn't be surprised they'd do it everywhere else, nor should you.
---
I've played the game since day one, and I've never done project paradise, it was always me alone
---
Use it with the regular black smoke machine if you have it for even more effects.
---
Paranoia is a hell of a contagion.
---
What‚Äôs the other 76 sub?
---
I thought it was to be a joke... that or a show of incompetence.
---
If you can only afford the base version of the game that's not their fault. If you want all the features of the game and fallout first you have to pay whatever price they decide to set for it.
---
Yes, it was hotfixed.
---
I enjoy the game. I'll admit it. I have from release day, right up until this latest move put a bad taste in my mouth. Am i going to get a Fallout 1st subscription? Hell No! It's a shitty move that has divided the community. Have I bought stuff from the Atom Shop? Yes,generally some of the cosmetic stuff that they promised it would only be and after i had earned either all or most of the Atoms towards it in game. Am I again after this? No. 
---
But, frankly, after paying $100 for the game itself (which is the average price of all new release games where i live), plus the $80/90 a year already to access online Gaming through PlayStation Network (though you at least get access to free games) there is no way I am i going to pay  *another*  $100 just to play this one game. But I sure as hell am going to get my money's worth out of it for what i already have paid. And, yes, i will still continue to have fun, but on my terms. If Bethesda start frigging with the public servers tho, to get people onto the subscription then, that will be another story.
---
Super salt
---
It‚Äôs a fantastic game from what I‚Äôve played of it so far. I kinda feel like a lot of people are using the Outerworlds like a hot new girlfriend and shoving it in their ex-partners face. 
---
I just hope Bethesda wake up before it‚Äôs too late.
---
I have a 176, 85, 76. All rifle builds. A level 65 bloodied. And a level 12 mule.
---
Mannequins, good idea
---
Happy cake day to you
---
Yes, almost a month ago. Old news now.
---
They said it would come with unlimited scrap storage - an advantage over normal players, it gives you private words in which you could in theory run a workshop forever - normal players can‚Äôt - it comes with 1600 atoms a month for which to buy more ptw items in the shop.
---
Yep, or $170 a year. Absolutely outrageous
---
r/fo76
---
I'd rather see 60000 atoms or 600000 atoms, just for wasting my time and money on the garbage.
---
I, too, love the game. I wouldn't be 300+ if I didn't. It's fun when it works, and half the time its humorous when it doesn't.
---
But repeatedly breaking their promises and pumping in this pay to win bullshit is and has been hurting that. I'm holding out for Wastelanders, but for me that's the last chance to turn it around. And I think that's how quite a few people feel.
---
Honestly, even then, if they do mend the lack of endgame content I just feel like the pay 2 win is too far gone now.
---
Spittin straight facts
---
They have stated clearly you will have access to your junk in the scrapbox if you subscription ends, you just can‚Äôt add to it.  I‚Äôve seen many people suggest that subscribing every other month might be a strategic way to take advantage of this mechanic.
---
I missed out on that sadly. ‚òπ
---
Yeah its pretty high here in Australia, they want $179.95 for a year which equates to $15 a month at that rate. Or the monthly is $22.95...
---
Noting atoms are usually exchanged at a rate of $15 to 1000 atoms, or ocassionaly 1500 atoms on sale. As such the value isn't there unless you want the private server.
---
You seem to enjoy rifles
---
So its pay to win because you can get alot of scrap? Then get atoms to buy cosmetics or a bot that gets you scrap. It's not much of a pay to win route if that's what everyone is worried about.
---
Its a fo76 sub not a hate fo76 dub go create a sub dedicated to hating this game, also you are an egg
---
I've simply given up. It feels like a disconnect between the community and Bethesda that won't end until the shareholders stop pushing Bethesda to keep doing shitty cash grabs like fallout first. Genuinely disappointed in the direction Bethesda has taken lately, thank God the outer worlds is out to release me from this prison of a "game."
---
To be fair, you‚Äôre right we should probably look at it this way rather than get attached to a publisher. It is weird, I don‚Äôt know why I feel some type of loyalty to Bethesda and I‚Äôve probably been caught up in this for some time that I haven‚Äôt even noticed how weird it actually is until you pointed it out üòÇ
---
Maybe they will bring it back. I think it came with the mothman pack. If I ever see you around you can use mine lol
---
Never be worried to say "Hello!" to a gamer in meatspace, too.
---
I really wouldnt put it pass them at this point to mess witht the servers either blatantly or though stealth nerf , debuffs or other stuff
---
As cheesy as they are, those red backgrounds with golden eastern dragons. I wouldn‚Äôt mind those as wallpapers. Or skins for weapons/power armor.
---
Scrap is literally the he building blocks of the game and have you been on the game lately? The atomic shop is slowly but surely getting added with more and more PTW content
---
best bet is to look at FFXIV not WoW, currently WoW is also another fire because of Blizzard and their BS. FFXIV has done it right, they released the game like FALLOUT 76, but ACTUALLY done something about it and turned the game into a masterpiece, with music, great story content and a overwhelming sense of immersion on how your chracter interacts with the story.
---
Fallout 76, needs to pull a FFXIV, start fresh and re-release the game with a new engine and overhaul the mechanics, textures, and graphics. If done right, the game can cover the cost, but it CANNOT be rushed... it needs to be planned and thought out. 76 wasn't planned, or even though out correctly and this is why we're having these problems now.
---
Dude, these publishers literally go to press conferences to make fun of you for buying into their lies. 
---
1) There's literally footage of one of the lead designers of Candy Crush saying that the whole "BUt ThE deVElOperS nEEd tHE ExTRa MOneY!" is a flat out lie used to get people to not only buy more microtransactions but to also defend it from critics.
---
2) Game development costs have actually been going down for the most part. Outside massive games like Cyberpunk 2077 and RDR2, publishers are not only not spending that much more money than they did 10 years ago, but are sometimes even paying less. That's because technology is constantly getting cheaper, developers are being forced to work more unpaid overtime, and as digital distribution becomes more popular, less money has to be spent on making and shipping physical copies.
---
3) The reason why the cost of games haven't gone up is because of how supply and demand work. Due to video games becoming way more cheaper to distribute and sell, and the increasingly growing consumer base, there is no reason to make videogames any cheaper. Especially when profits keep skyrocketing up.
---
4) There are still plenty of successful big budget games that don't need microtransactions to be incredibly profitable. Just look at CDPR.
---
5) The developers don't see any of the profits from microtransactions. Most AAA developers are paid in salaries, meaning they get paid a static amount of money throughout the process of making games regardless of how profitable that game is or how many overtime hours they put into it. Most of the cash gained from microtransactions just go straight to the executives, not the hard working developers.
---
Atleast youre honest to yourself that youre ignorant .
---
Yeah, I understood, but I asked this from Rose_Beef, who gave up after FO3.
---
www.fallout1st.com
---
The difference in these companies worth from before micros to now is staggering.
---
Completely agree with your points.  I'd also add that things also get complicated with **time** in modern gaming, another problem with the money/time model.  Live-service games especially want to be the only/primary thing you play, so they introduce a lot of chore content.  I've put a ton of time into several games so that I'll be ready when the game gets good/fun, only for the game to never get better.  Sometimes, I feel like games should be paying me to play them, they're that much like work.  For most people, time is a valuable resource and being asked to spend that much of it on chore content some games is a negative rather than a positive.
---
Maybe just a boost but I dont think p2w justifies it. Helping players get a boost by paying for a premium service seems normal but it's not like they will have a major advantage over the others. So they have more scrap and a nice C.A.M.P and they can make weapons if they have the plans..
---
Oh I realised after I‚Äôd posted the long post üòÇ but the damage was already done üòÇ
---
In my defence it‚Äôs 6:50am
---
Point being that communication started the process. Which we can do now at lightspeed compared to in 1983. Tbh if money talks im not sure how your comment makes sense because there is no monetary value associated to this thread. Or does communication, in fact matter?
---
No one is holding you
---
I have 2. A main level 157 that‚Äôs kinda...there. Sniper, mini nukes, shotguns, mid-range ballistic, melee, you name it, he‚Äôs got it. That‚Äôs the one that I use for pubs. 
---
And then a brand new level 9 that I use when me and my significant other are playing alone on a privet would. Have an entire backstory set up for as to why we‚Äôre in WV in the first place for that one.
---
it‚Äôs not about how u spend your own money, it‚Äôs just reinforcing bethesda that they can get away with shit like this. it‚Äôs actually so insulting they‚Äôd charge this much for a subscription to their incomplete game
---
1) So Fallout 76 finally meeting the bare minimum requirement of an rpg is what you consider a lot? Dude, voiced npcs and dialogue trees have been the standard for decades. This isn't some herculean task. 
---
2) Fallout First is "optional" as long you don't mind having your gameplay experience made objectively worse so that Bethesda can milk you for more money.
---
Commie Whacker has a Bladed mod plan that can rarely drop from Forest events.
---
Fuck Bethesda I am done with their shit.
---
I haven't touched it since a week or two after launch.
---
Serious regerts.
---
Bethesda has gone full evil profit Corp.
---
I feel this so much. Reason why I‚Äôve given up man. The Outer Worlds are getting me through the day now lmao.
---
Aside from your paranoia, you guys just can't stand the fact that it exists another kind of players who is just enjoying the game and will continue to do so?
---
Same here
---
[I called it out and the shills are already downvoting me for questioning it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/do6jop/the_best_3_minutes_of_my_life/f5nvj53/)
---
You really think they care about the sub that much? Alright everyone, put on your tin foil hats and start monitoring for lizard-men
---
STFU I WANT TO BUY EVERY PIXEL ON MY SCREEN AND THEN SOME! YOU ARE JUST JEALOUS THAT I WASTED MORE MONEY THAN YOU HAHA! VIRGIN!!!
---
The overmonetization of videogames is going to be the death of it. If Bethesda and other companies keep milking their fanbases to death it will cause another crash. Just look at what happened to Ubisoft's stock last week when Ghost Recon completely flopped due to how much people were sick and tired of bullshit microtransactions. Fallout 76 already sold terribly, and this subscription service will just further drive more of their fanbase away from their games.
---

Are the most egregious shills out here.
---
Reddit should purge those cunts from bethesda PR  department. We have enough brainded sheeps on our own.
---
Nop.
---
Except the more people use the service the more Bethesda will lock features behind it. Everyone using Fallout First is making the gameplay experience for everyone else objectively worse
---
Feel sorry for you here it‚Äôs just $100. It‚Äôs high and I didn‚Äôt get it but it doesn‚Äôt seem like too bad once they start adding on what you can do with private servers especially if you can make persistent workshops through some sort of save system
---
When they add more things to the game that we have to pay to have space for?
---
Plus that 20 second respawn puts you more at risk of loading in when the event ends and then you dont get shit :/
---
Yep. Bethesda‚Äôs staying silent until this controversy dies down, then they‚Äôre going to act like nothing happened/praise the loyal fan base who bought their p2w garbage then start upping the micro transactions.
---
they're smart about the lightning if anything else. they use pretty colors to distract you from how ugly everything else is.
---
though I shouldn't be giving them credit considering they probably learned that from Boris.
---
And it's damn refreshing for a change. I've had different options come up just from the order I chose the dialogue in.
---
A lot of your old weapons will be obsolete, so probably not. 
---
I guess we'll see when they release a feature list.
---
Casuals usually don't have alt accounts so they really need that junk stash
---
problem with that is most of the content in ATOM Shop is content from previous version of fallout, if the content wasn't actually copypasta, it would make sense to actually buy it. Sense the game is just one big copypasta of fallout4 other than the retexturing of a few things here and there... it would make no sense to spend anything on another game that we should all own by now, let alone already paid for.
---
subscriptions need to offer something BETTER than items that should be in the game as a standard, not a premium. Subscription based platforms should consider the options, sense we ALREADY paid for the game, then their best bet is to rent out independent servers with fallout back end access for independent modders who created content for other fallout series and even made content improvements. They should also include a copy of the server files on a download website for people to run the server independent of the control of Bethesda, like Minecraft.
---
subscription should cover the updates of these servers and their maintenance, but this should not prevent non-paying customers access to servers or mods.
---
if players want to host their own servers let them...
---
As for other content that BETHESDA SHOULD HAVE PUT PREMIUM ON...
---
1. Power armor garage... (an instance that takes you to your own garage like in GTA-V)
---
2. Free ATOM shop rental, all items in ATOM shop is free until subscription runs out, then it goes back to pay, items obtained for free will also be return to atom shop, paid items stay forever.
---
3. Entry into fallout 76 as a hideout, use the vault as a home to craft, or even sell your stuff.
---
4. World wide marketplace, standard players should have access, but allow more slots for subscription players.
---
5. More companions? Have more than 1 companion at a time?
---
6. Get married? sure why not every OTHER FRICKIN MMO HAS THIS SYSTEM.
---
7. and MUCH more...
---
Are you in a video game subreddit telling people who play said game that they don't have a life? Ironic. Isn't there some tax evasion or kids playing on lawns for you to pester?
---
Yeah, Bethesda has lost all good will from me. Unless I see a lot of good reviews, I doubt I'll ever buy anything from them again.
---
Even though the one I did a couple hours ago failed, since I kept getting spawned next to fissures I would die instantly and was stuck in the nuke zone for 3 minutes just dying and waiting 20 seconds to try and return to the fight only to get 1 tapped again by the queen and get put back into the zone. And it's not like I'm a generally low level player, I'm level 115 with full legendary set of BOS heavy combat armour but the rad damage that I had sustained even with solar powered at max and ghoulish too kept landing be back in a repetitive cycle unable to help the other participants
---
I think there's a distinct difference between the circlejerk-esque Bethesda bashing and criticism of the Fallout 1st product.  
---
  
---
I'll probably pkay some more FO76. But im not going to pay money for bad products, which is what this is.
---
Same here. Yeah it's still buggy as hell, but I like playing anyway. It's the most unexpected random moments that make this game fun.
---
Nah, it still means you have no life.
---
The problem is they made FO3 which was actually really good.  It's not better than NV as NV basically took what they did and built on it and made it way better but FO3 is still good.  FO3 gets overshadowed though because of that.  The worst part about it is that they didn't grow after FO3.  They didn't do like NV did and make FO4 better than FO3.  Instead they took a step backwards and dumbed it down.  That's the absolute worst part.  They could have made a game better than FO3, maybe better than NV.  But they didn't.  FO4 was a step backwards.  That's the absolute most killer part of it.
---
I dunno man. I don't see that actually happening since about half the server's filled with fallout 1sts. Do you even play bro?
---
I'm a fallout 1st member and I've been aggressively taking workshops. Wish I could be griefed only actually use a workshop when it's on my private server lol hope I see your broke ass out there op
---
Nice Story Man :)
---
Oh they'd hear it alright, and slap a big ol' cease and desist on it.
---
You know, I haven't experienced a bug in a while. Maybe I'm lucky though.
---
I wasnr familar with live service vs online mmm before. Now I am. So ita back to the old ways, wait, wait for the bugs to be patched (by whomever) and the title to go on sale, which they always do at some point. My rig isnt generally bleeding esge anyway so it win win for men to hols off and get the title and the required hardware at a discount. 
---
While it say that yes, I am getting my monies worth, it is just barely, and there have been definite periods of hanging on only by the sales receipt along the way.
---
I'd friend you but read you're on xbox ... too bad I play on ps4. I have some stuff I could have given you for free.
---
Fixer plans.
---
Always check the promo pics in the shop ... the ingame images show no hair.
---
I just hope that we have made enough noise for them to listen to what we are saying, acknowledge it and address these issues.
---
Important to remember that our dollar is worth a lot less than the USD, though, so it probably comes to roughly the same amount - not that it matters, because it's not worth it regardless.
---
1) He could have always been reading reddit posts for a long time but only felt like posting due to the controversy making him finally want to express his opinion.
---
2) Are you seriously saying that anyone who criticizes Fallout 76 and doesn't blindly support it 100% is considered a troll?
---
3) Why is he not allowed to just directly ask people a question instead of just having to make guesses on how people would react to his question?
---
4) A lot of people are also tired with Bethesda's actions and want to express their feelings. Since this is a public website they have just as much right to express their opinion as you do yours. If you don't like that people have a different opinion than you well then sorry but that's how life works. You can't just censor people because you disagree with them.
---
Think of it like ordering food at a restaurant you've been to for years. The food is good and you know the staff on a first name basis. Suddenly upper management comes in and says things aren't profitable enough, starts cutting costs, reducing the quality of the ingredients, replacing good chefs, so on and so on. You order food there and its so bad it actually makes you sick for days, you know the staff and establishment well enough so you forgive them. You trust them to get it sorted and they mean it when they say "it won't happen again". So you come back, and you get sick again, and you forgive them and come back again but the next time you visit everything is more expensive, the food is still horrible it won't make you sick right away its barely palatable. Yet they're charging more for it.
---
Do you still come back to the restaurant after all that?
---
outerworlds should take the Falloutfirst domain name and rename it to "FalloutBUTBETTER"
---
I too wished the best for Bethesda, but this? This is gone too far, like adding a nuke to a already burning pile of shit.
---
People can only complain so much. Look how much blacklash Blizzard was getting compared to now.
---
Whatever, I own Fallout 76 and will at least finish the main quests.
---
Tried going back to 4 the other day myself, couldn't though sadly. Started the game up, and just wound up closing it not long later. All this 76 nonsense just left such a bad taste in my mouth that Fallout in general just hasn't been appealing.
---
So, it's onto Outer Worlds for about a week and a half before Death Stranding comes out and my social life crumbles. And my girlfriend has to wake up in the morning and ask me "Did you even sleep yet?", and my boss starts wondering if I'm ever coming in for work. Rofl.
---
They haven't improved it in nearly a decade, what made you think they were going to improve it now? They didn't even go through the trouble of copying modded fixes for handling inventory, forget about getting off their own ass and figuring it out. Like.....what did you expect?
---
&gt;half the server population's bought the sub 
---
I'd like to see the source for that claim.
---
Im saying wastelanders should of course be free. Just like the raids and Nuclear winter. when I look at the hours I‚Äôve spent on the game so far, and the eventual edition of that... its enough imo. Also I want the game to get continued support and maybe more content. My gameplay experience is the same. I didnt have a tent before. I dont now.
---
Don't be ashamed of the hours, I have well over 3000 in New Vegas, granted I've been playing for 9 years.
---
$22, exaggeration doesn‚Äôt help make your point. It kind of takes away from it. Don‚Äôt feed me that NZ bs.
---
16$ worth of atoms is a great deal, just gotta save it for a couple of months so I could afford buying the 18$ blue power armour paint.
---
$22.95 in Australia is just too expensive.
---
It's almost as if the people that show up to complain about this shit every single time are the vocal minority, bolstered by people that don't play the game but just show up to shit on it because lolfallout76, who quickly get bored of complaining like every other time and end up going back to playing anyway. Meanwhile other people just genuinely enjoy the game and use this sub to do more than just whine about shit.
---
But sure... Let's go with your theory of an army of sock accounts run by the Bethesda. That's way more believable than imagining that some people are here to play a game and not start a riot every time something new pops up.
---
the "look how amazing this game is because i met x person who gave me free shit/looked funny/were helpful" were definitely not funny from the start and did not feel like propaganda at all /s  
---
either that or they were made by boomer naive gamers who blindly support bad practices because they simply don't care
---
Jealous little fools. I won‚Äôt be buying FO1st but I‚Äôd never act so greedy and selfish to attack people who have been willing to pay for something I wasn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs childish and cruel. And says so much about the person attacking. How embarrassing.
---
How is the outer world? Im thinking of buying either that or borderlands 3
---
You're looking at em
---
Upvote if you would bully Bethesda cucks off of Fallout 76 with your male followers
---
Easiest implementation for them, by setting up the networking outside the game and just pushing events into the game you don't have to change much in the code itself. But it's not a tight integration so there is bound to be performance loss and odd behaviours.
---
Oh, you mean you? So you represent half the server population? Wow, this game is deader than I thought.
---
Check your settings... maybe you have ‚Äúpacifist‚Äù turned on.
---
Also, there‚Äôs a limit to damage per shot in PVP
---
Not buying another one of thier games. I tried defending this game but its just pathetic theyre just a name feeding off money from people dumb enough to pay for this shit upset I even paid money for this game. Worst game ive played probably in my life compared to expectation. I dont think ive ever spent 60 dollars on such a poorly developed game.
---
Except that game is actually trying to include as much content as they can. The way theyve gone about it is another argument to have. The game is an alpha. But as it stands right now I'd much rather play Star Citizen in the state it's in today than ever again play FO76 again.
---
Pacifist wasn't on but I've already gotten enough info, thank you tho
---
You‚Äôre joking? Why should they quit and not you? You‚Äôre the one who hates it, so you should quit. Being a childish little fool isn‚Äôt going to hurt them because they‚Äôll just block your jealous little ass.
---
Planting reviews once isn't the same as actively patrolling a nuclear subreddit whenever something "oof" happens to their active game. 
---
They made [32 reviews](https://youtu.be/kjyeCdd-dl8?t=1253) for a bottle.[\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a9hu7j/the_nuka_cola_dark_rum_has_32_5_star_reviews/)[\[2\]](https://www.liquorama.net/nuka-dark-rum-750ml.html)  Half of them were shitty attempts at humor by "reviewers" named after Fallout 4 characters; all of which were probably done by one idiot employee. No source on that last claim. They just seem all similarly lame. 
---
This was your source for your argument and I can't agree with the comparison.  I'm sticking with conspiracy-minded for OP until they chime in with anything grounded in regards to any Bethesda-related public forums and PR damage control.  
---
For what it's worth, I upvoted your comments. I know we're just making conversation.
---
tbf though eso was not always an amazing game, it had it's own spot when it first came out of being pretty trash, but yes it is now a pretty amazing game
---
You do you.
---
I get you dont like whats going on, I dont either. The way your going about it is tottaly wrong. no need to be calling names over someting you dont agree. 
---
on top that you are the one making yourslef look like a dumb fuck they way you express yourself.
---
Considering their anti tampering detection on the client is based on a list of application titles in proc list... any malware locally that is targeting fo76 would be able to easily grab everything required.
---
Which weapons other than legacies and teslas have you seen causing the bug? I guess anything that can ash/goo, or set fire to them?
---
&gt; I'm a fallout 1st member
---
So, in other words, you're a twat. Thanks for lending a hand to turning video games into shameless cash cows.
---
$12.99 Per month, $8.33 if you purchase a 1 year subscription. 
---
All the other points are salient but it's not
---
I love this analogy, mainly because I actually had something like that happen, great staff and food, manager ended up leaving, new manager came in and the place turned to shit, closed down within a year of new management
---
Ooo I love your take on this
---
So? Some people have paid for a game and enjoy it. You know, although I haven‚Äôt played it in a while, it‚Äôs actually a cool game. Bethesda have not forced you to do anything. You don‚Äôt have to pay a monthly fee. You paid one single tiny price (¬£60 is fuck all) and get to play for the rest of the time it‚Äôs running. I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre acting like you are owed more than you are.
---
Perfectly stated
---
Unknown - that's server side and I can't look into that alas.. 
---
My guess is per container it's registered with a TTL. So if you loot a container, it gets registered with a time in the future. Once that time has passed, it will get removed from the list .. everytime you try ingame to look at that container it will request if there is loot, lootserver will check that list, if it's on it - it will return nothing, otherwise grab from loottable.
---
You're right, sorry. [It's $23](https://bethesda.net/en/store/product/FAOM01PCBG01BASE).
---
I'm bored so I'm responding and simply guessing.
---
Dailies are events that you can only do once per day - hence Dailies
---
Repeatable are events that have cool downs and you can repeat them several times in a day - hence Repeatables
---
Queen of the hunt I think only happens when someone Nukes the fissure in Watoga, the south western spot on the map.
---
&gt;Bethesda has to monetize the game somehow. This isn't a charity. 
---
So $60 for an unfinished game wasn't enough?
---
Always loved how this sub showed it's maturity by claiming anyone with a genuine issue is having a tantrum.
---
Once OP's balls drop he'll probably stop caring.
---
The more the company is worth the more the have to charge? So in a few years when they are worth even more than they are now (assuming they don't run themselves into the ground) we can expect even bigger price tags?
---
Most people, in fact, probably don‚Äôt read gaming press, gaming blogs etc and don‚Äôt know that the minority of ‚Äòfans‚Äô are getting all spasticated about it. Most people just see a thing they like, a price they deem to be low and buy and play. Idiots on Reddit think they speak for the majority but they speak for a tiny miniature slice of the player base.
---
Wheres mr bill when you need him.
---
Luckily I sold my account to another person. After that, our relationship with Bethesta will be based on piracy.
---
Not the whole game. I'm talking about the server I'm on silly boi
---
WAKE ME UP...
---
&gt; All the other points are salient but it's not $22.00 Per month.
---
[Is for me.](https://bethesda.net/en/store/product/FAOM01PCBG01BASE)
---
I stopped playing FO76 when Apex Legends released back in February (which is a much better game, and I've only spent $30 on battle season passes thus far).
---
Honestly, I wish I could get my $80 pre-order back. The game is too grindy, and just not that fun.
---
Or, if it's ethical for them to release private servers that are more stable to paying players while leaving the rest of us with choppy performance. Even though we all bought this game, many of us playing since beta, assuming we'd have the fully fleshed out and functioning AAA Title we paid for.
---
Haven't been on in like three weeks, but last I was on? Things were still fairly laggy. At least the disconnects weren't happening though.
---
And this whole Fallout 1st thing is worrisome. How do we know they'll even have non paying players as a priority? I mean, sure. Wastelanders is coming, but that doesn't mean much if things keep on this path.
---
A point I like to chuckle at, actually. The scrap boxes deleted scrap. Yeah? Moment they found out? Announced they'd find a way to reverse the deletion of all that scrap from the players affected.
---
Think back to the raid deleting items, or the power armour going missing stuff. How many people were pretty much told there was nothing that could be done?
---
Some things are so easily forgotten, and pushed aside. But that point alone is a prime example of how when it's caused by a bug that isn't in a paid feature? It gets very little priority. But, if it's a bug from a paid feature? Suddenly there are things to look into to hopefully restore the lost items. An example of why this Fallout 1st thing is concerning. And a great example of your point on what is ethical and what isn't, coming from a company that so many fans placed their trust in. That so many fans spent money on a game from them. A game they trusted would be properly functioning and when it wasn't? We trusted they'd prioritize fixing things and making things ideal for everyone. Not just those who are willing to pay them MORE money.
---
It's a damned shame.
---
There is no content to this game, let alone a working game. People had paid money for this game and purchased early access to get into the game... I'm one of them. So I can understand why people are furious. It would make sense if the game was still new, still fresh from its early development but its been... a year or two now sense the release of Fallout 76.
---
* The progression of the games development in the past year alone has been sparse
---
* Content in the game that should have been added, even suggested content are now going to be behind a pay wall
---
* And there are still a TON of issues, bugs, and problems in the game that still need to be fixed to this day.
---
So yes, people are going to bitch about a product that provides nearly zero entertainment value. I've played for quite some time myself and enjoyed the game to a large degree at first... but after smelling the radioactive bullshit that Bethesda has recently dropped on the community made the string value "enjoy" to equal "Null", to ask me for MORE money and put the content in the game as a subscription item is nothing more than a insult.
---
Are you an honest bethesda rep?
---
What is your ign? I'd gladly take over your workshops.
---
 If you have that much hate over this, try another hobby. You may like knitting, heard it's addictive.
---
Well they retconned the Brotherhood into it, so there may yet be a chance üôÇ
---
Those who praise Todd Howard are called 'Toddlers'
---
This is why I pretty much buy only indie titles or games by smaller developers.
---
&gt;when your game is so shit people offer to buy other players different games to play to make up for getting fucked by bugs
---
woo
---
Hats off to Matty though.  I don't watch his vids because I'm not a fan but that's a hell of a thing to do.
---
Not dead at all, do you even play it?
---
nearly extinct, not entirely. some people just like to pvp.
---
Oh, you mean the private server with 10 people playing?
---
I would prefer something like NCR but smaller and not that advanced in 2102 .
---
Foud by some guy who knowed that vaults were suppesed to do some experiments and not save people so he got to some unnamed vault and started big revolution where killed every vault-tech scientist and overseer then he escaped with others dwellers and knowed that USA failed stared rebuild a new country where everyone is equal .
---
Enclave= main enemy
---
BoS=even they dont like communism trying convince them to unite
---
you'll never understand. the problem isn't people expending their own money however they seem fit, but rather incentivizing Bethesda's behavior.
---
I am still playing but yeah, I have NO hope whatsoever of it improving much. BGS doesn't listen at all, they never will. I will not be buying any Bethasda games in the future unless the reviews are REALLY REALLY REALLY good. They have lost all credibility and goodwill.
---
why are you even in this sub rofl
---
I suggest spending less time before keyboard and even more on your knees as you suck Todd Howard's prick.
---
Oh you might have just saved me a quite a few hours - was wondering about how something worked and seeming the nexusphobiker figured that one out.. time to credit someone ;-)
---
Not sure someone in your position in life has the luxury of making zingers.
---
Well what do you expect? It‚Äôs bugthesda
---
What exactly is your problem and why aren't you answering my points?  
---
Continue attacking me on a personal level but you seem like a salty idiot that bought this rip off out of spite.
---
Do they still sell? I've never experienced PVP in like months! Who knows maybe some people do pvp circle jerkoffs in private servers
---
I'm glad you liked it, best way I can suggest is to keep an eye out on my channel, and the next time the next 3 characters go up, try to snatch a place ;3
---
you don't represent me, maybe you should stop talking about the community as a whole friend
---
if they ever drop lmao.
---
So are you saying it's Bethesda sticking up for the game:)  These comments get funnier &amp; funnier.
---
No the adventure server.
---
Started making new ones after 120ish
---
you've gotta be kidding me ahahahahahahahahahha
---
It was a joke but I realize it was too complicated.
---
I scrip every bit I get, except the bloody thorn armor :( stuck with that junk
---
Zenimax had a solid run of making REALLY(dishonoreds, DOOM16,Evil Within2, Wolf NO, Prey, not too mention the actual BGS games) good video games for awhile, yeah they had bugs and it was often best to wait 6 months until after they came out but for awhile all their studios were making solid games. When you compare that to other big studios who just  churrn stuff out like Ubisoft(no thank you ass creed every year) , EA who kills your favorite studios, Konami who were more interested in gambling machines than SILENT HILLS, ect, it felt like even though Zenimax did a lot of corporate shitty things like they still had high standards for making quality video games even if they were rough around the edges.
---
Now, they are still rough around the edges and with Fallout 76, Quake Champions &amp; Wolfenstein Youngblood it is quite clear Zenimax has ordered "live service microtransactions" to be the cornerstone of their games rather than quality, and at this point unless there is some drastic change in corporate policy  I think most of their game in the future will be all gunked up(I am curious how Zenimax is going to try to "live service" Doom Eternal one of the few franchises they have yet to fuck up)
---
Yeah weirdly enough they do. Just can fathom it as to why. Circle jerking sounds like a informed conclusion to me
---
Why are there still these extremely bitter posts being made? Why is someone's opinion any less valid than yours OP?
---
Grow up and let people enjoy the game.
---
Maybe if they actually released Wastelanders, it ran relatively smooth then perhaps the community wouldn't mind to pay for Fallout 1st then. And that's a big maybe
---
Did you even read, "friend? It isn't hard, the hint is even in the title.
---
I'll just add this: Warframe is FREE, has no subscription service and has a metric ton more content than this garbage.
---
DE listen to their playerbase and adjust prices based on what the community reckons are fair prices. Bethesda charge you for blue.......
---
Fuck Todd Howard and the horse he rode in (after removing it's armour of course)
---
Pretty sure it's the principle of the matter. It's a matter of not wanting to support the decisions that have been made, because one feels as though they've been lied to and like their voice doesn't matter to the company that claims it does. Also, I imagine it has something to do with the fact that Pre Subscription and Post Subscription, the non private servers are still choppy and not fully up to par. So, it adds more salt to the wound. Ya know what I mean? It's like a slap to the face for many people, because it can be compared to just blatantly being told "Want things as stable as we promised on the game that still has a fair amount of things that needs to be touched up, not to mention how many problems you already had to endure despite paying full price for a game you were told would be ready at launch? Well, better pay us more money because private servers will give you your stability."
---
Everyone has their own very valid reasons for not simply just playing and not paying. Just as those who don't care have their reasons for paying or just playing as is. Some, genuinely don't mind paying more and that's cool. But it is pretty easy to see where the other half is coming from with how they feel on the matter.
---
At the end of the day though? Everyone has one key thing in common. They just want to see the game being reflected as it was originally intended. Everyone seems to just want to be able to enjoy the game. Some just have a harder time doing that as of late.
---
Way I see it is that he has made multiple "cooking" videos already, based on how hard he has been grilling Bethesda.
---
He represents me &amp; I'm sure many others, so it may not be your community, but it is his &amp; mine
---
it is funny to see a mature post regarding fallout 1st rather than a nerdraging kid who cant afford 15‚Ç¨ for a month so they whine about it on here
---
Which behaviour? Funding the game?
---
I see. Anyway, I prefer reading some actual statistics from a credible source and by that I don't mean one guy on reddit making the claim.
---
predatory business practices. several other games are widely successful without needing to stoop so low.
---
Yes it is, Fallout First is just an ad for Outer Worlds after all.
---
Stay mad.
---
Bethesda has nothing to do with the subs. People just still like the game.
---
So why the hate towards fallout 1st members then. I'm one &amp; happy to admit it, went around in a public server in my new costume &amp; not one person cared.
---
I agree with that. I like this stupid subscription thing as well.
---
I find the private servers perfect to farm and I will also invite a few newcomers to collect a bit of the sweet points of experience.
---
Don‚Äôt be such a lair Jeff.
---
Yeah true, it's only $16usd more a year
---
I know I can‚Äôt help myself.
---
Dailies are once a day, repeatables are once a day, per server
---
Nobody is predating you into spending more money than you already did. You can literally keep playing how you always did. You guy subject yourself to first world problems then blame companies for creating them.
---
What if it was a conspiracy to sell those game passes the whole time?... ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt worry Todd, we‚Äôll cut you in for a percentage of the profits‚Äù- Bill Gates, probably maybe.
---
That psycho with a golf club when playing on survival truly was a nightmare of NV. Them and Cook Cook.
---
Well what the hell is you doing on reddit if you are looking for an actual statistics from a credible source?
---
Imho really important information. I was actually tempted to get the 1st abo to provide a place for me and my friends to actually do the real fallout playing. But fortunately I got the info about the "server" not really being that just in time before getting the sub.
---
I'll stick to my modded fo4 for now.
---
you know what a scab is? they're the people who work during strikes. that's why.
---
you're essentially telling Bethesda "it's ok, please milk me dry master Todd"
---
your decision indirectly affects all of us. it's you money still, and you can do whatever you want with it. I wouldn't have any other way. but don't be surprised if people despise you for it.
---
I mean, the reason it seems like there are many is because those who oppose this have stopped playing. So whilst yes, half the server as bought it, probably as many have stopped playing the game over it...
---
I quit playing after just a few weeks of having the game at launch, but knowing that Wastelanders was coming out soon I decided to try and get back into the game. And I got to a point where it was.. almost fun... even at level 30 it‚Äôs hard as duck to find ammo, so I just melee everything, but you spend so much god damn time wandering around looking for enemies, and it feels like 80% of the time you do actually manage to find something to fight it‚Äôs just a bunch of level 6 scorched.
---
why would i buy fallout76 and then pay monthly to play single player?
---
Because its stable lol
---
I played the Fallout 1 demo back in '96 and have been a fan of the franchise ever since. I also played the Quake 1 shareware in '96 and that's basically the same story (though I was late to Quake 4 for about 2 years).
---
Zenimax has managed to severely damage or outright kill my favorite two video game franchises this year with FO76 and the dumpster fire that is Quake Champions, to the point where the most recent title of each franchise I can no longer in good conscience play (I don't own a copy of FO76 but I sure as hell ain't going to buy one now). The sad part? Both games are actually fun to play. They're just being turned into unberable shitfests by business administration.
---
I assumed BGS will be able to fix FO76 and that them continouusly iterating Creation Engine will be good for everyone in the long run. I had hope for moddable private servers that we can operate on a community basis. I was even waiting for a Creation Kit to hit, which was my initial condition for buying a copy of FO76. That's all down the drain now. As far as I'm concerned, Zenimax can burn to the ground and I'd even roast some marshmellows over the embers.
---
You guys have any luck finding battletoads in stock?
---
Didn't you like the knitting comment, poor baby. How about ballet then
---
the EU as a whole would beg to differ. it *is* a serious issue whether you like it or not.
---
at the very least they lied to us and that's bad enough.
---
you have no idea what your talking about. lol
---
My friends list is active as always. Some of my friends returned to the game just for that NCR ranger outfit
---
Funny thing. That may be part of why I didn't reply to them.
---
&gt;targeted harassment  
---
&gt;targeted hate
---
Those are pretty serious accusations. Half the subreddit you say?
---
‚ÄúSo what you‚Äôre saying is...‚Äù Seriously though, the modding community really could save this game. I‚Äôd love Immersive Gameplay in Fallout 76.
---
‚ÄúYou guys are just broke and butthurt‚Äù- All 12 people still playing, any time I express dissatisfaction with where the game has gone.
---
Following the release of outer worlds and CoD especially.
---
‚ÄúThe mature side of the community‚Äù  Pack it in guys, he‚Äôs got in under control! What a load of shitüòÇ
---
To further your analogy; 
---
I like bratwurst. And it would be an absolute shame if a company got the trademark on the very concept of bratwurst, then turned it into a bland, barely edible travesty of itself and _then_ charged me not just to eat it, but also for the antacid required to keep it down because of their tampering with the recipe.
---
Unlike Bratwurst, however, video games allow for the copyright of a concept, a theme, a _world_ - there will always be someone else making bratwurst and if you don't like the recipe used by cook A you can always eat bratwurst made by cook B.
---
Not so much if I want to play a good game in the fallout universe.
---
Well said!
---
Blasphemous
---
I'm fairly certain OP was speaking hyperbole. Exaggerating simply to make his or her point. And, some of OPs words are good ones. Just because they come off as paranoid and overly critical in some aspects does not mean they're wholly wrong in others.
---
Just as you claim OP is being ignorant, you yourself are coming as such with your statement.
---
That said? Could be some truth to the PR thing. Everywhere else I look is either indifference or frustration. Even here, at first. But then suddenly, as if over night, things changed specifically in the subreddit? That does raise suspicions of something going on. Is it PR accounts? Who knows. And does it matter? Not really. The point still stands that many fans feel betrayed, or lied to, or simply frustrated, and the purpose of OPs post here seems to simply be met with the intention of ensuring that the voice of those who share his or her's outlook isn't overlooked. (Or similar outlooks, doesn't specifically have to be theirs)
---
And, that is something everyone should be entitled to. Their voice being heard in this sub Reddit. Instead of people who disagree jumping at those they disagree with to tell them to bugger off and call them ignorant. Wanting to silence someone for their opinion is horribly ignorant in and of itself. Everyone should be allowed to express themselves and how they feel, so long as they don't break the rules (obviously).
---
&amp; if those people are the ones spreading the hate, then it's good for the game. If they aren't, then hopefully they'll come back when wastelanders hits.
---
And thats fine, thats what's been happening on your end, on mine, for example, almost all dropped fallout the day the membership came out. I have 1 maybe 2 who still play it regularly and another 2-3 who get on may be twice a week.
---
I went into the game wanting to love it. I ignored all the negative because it was so obviously being used as click bait. This conclusion came from my experience with the game not the input from YouTube's. The two YouTube's I watched about the game are Oxhorn and Many a true nerd and while both have stated negative aspects of the game both have done so constructively. 
---
I do not believe myself part of a group think, although to have pigeon holed me so quickly I would suggest you reevaluate your own method of thinking.
---
 Enjoy the game if you enjoy it and I am glad people are finding something to enjoy within this game but surely you can see how Bethesda keep messing up on this game.
---
Maybe just try putting a mask on and then leaving it on indefinitely, should fix it then
---
if its so irrelevant, then what are you doing here?
---
actually very braindamaged
---
Yea I can, half of the last week's posts can confirm.
---
Cheesing?
---
We choose to take the civil way out. Most of us were playing since beta or day 1 of game release but we don't want think that this is the way the game should be heading, so we choose to stop playing and move on. It is a good game, but I can't bring myself to support it after this membership was introduced
---
r/falloutdadjokes
---
The Outer Worlds is like a new girlfriend that people are using to make their ex jealous.
---
I'd like to be able to find anything related to the game that isn't also shaming another game and dragging me into its drama.
---
But do u?
---
How exactly is modding gonna save the game? Think it's gonna fuck the game up so hard. We already got these modders editing numbers of the client and doing several million dps with their rifles. How is modding gonna help the game when there are so many ill intended people in this game?
---
Thank you.  I wonder if it's too late to request a refund?
---
Google "P2W" definition.
---
Having an advantage doesn't mean you win anything.
---
You know situations /stand points and ect change right ?
---
 It doesn't have to always be lieing it can be adapting or changing, in this case the only cosmetic statement went out the window with scrap and repair kits months ago since then we have had several pay for convenience and that's okay with me I could play the same with or without it and it wouldn't effect my experience
---
What does that convert to aud to usd?
---
so these loosers are starting to get hostile now, im done being nice with these idiots.
---
its our money. we like the game. t ous its worth it. and actually to the majority of the player base its worth it. since most people have bought it.
---
I think most of these loosers complaining about fallout first. eitehr dont play the game and never have
---
congratulations on having a different opinion.
---
It's not free, because it's not locally hosted.
---
Actually they did say they were looking to let us mod or tweak settings of a private world.
---
I didn't come to reddit to look for statistics. I was discussing something on redidt, met a guy who made a claim, and I asked him to provide a source for this claim. He didn't have a source, and he also didn't understand that the burden of proof lies on his side.
---
I've taken more than three mini nukes from a TS fatman, even without fireproof and serendipity. It has to do with your health and build. Also the damage cap prevents one shots on pvp, for the most part.
---
Yeah the wallpapers are a bit loud but I love the flooring, I typically build a military style camp like a larger version of the CB Firebases but with the new walls and floors I need to come up with a new design. Would love to see a Chinese skin of the Garage Door, honestly all the factions could do with one as well.
---
I could see(At least what I plan) the wallpaper skins being used for a sort of a Officer's room or something like a Wardroom.
---
Unlike a lot of people on your side, I'm not 12 so I do understand what a scab is but I don't see anyone out of work or in unions while I'm playing, That comment is just irrelevant . 
---
I despise the hate, if some of the hate mongers leave then it's a good day &amp; can only make the game better.
---
I purchased it for a world where my son &amp; l can do our own thing. The moneys chump change &amp; isn't an issue.
---
What do you want me to do? You want me to take screenshots of players in my server with fallout 1st icons and post it on imgur or something? I'm just talking about my personal experience and you are demanding proof here. And you don't even sound like you are trolling. You are actually serious. Are you alright?
---
Jesus, it took the sub a few days to go full conspiracy theory.
---
Fallout First didn‚Äôt negatively effect the game for the large number of people who still enjoy the game, so of course people are still enjoying it and say so on the sub
---
&gt;so we choose to stop playing and move on. It is a good game, but I can't bring myself to support it after this membership was introduced
---
\*claps\* That's what everyone should have done.
---
Okay, so would you like to point me to them please?
---
Thanks. Too many things are being overlooked here, and both sides seem to blindly jump in without considering the finer details. The guy before me really said it best though. Bringing up the ethical matter in the first place. Because that's what the biggest thing is here. What is ethical for a game company to do involving the products and those who paid for them? And releasing this 1st crap when there is still so much left undone on a game that should have been fully functional on release but somehow still is lacking in some rather important places? That's not ethical. At all. Especially when one of its features doubles as a bandaid for one of the issues, server stability.
---
Priority is turning towards maximizing profits, and has been progressing away from fulfilling the promises made to the consumers from what it seems. And we shouldn't have to pay for a stable server after almost a year of enduring all the problems. After so many has stuck by them through the hardships their game suffered, and being understanding for the most part. All out of respect for the company and franchise, despite the fact that we bought the game in such an awful state.
---
These are advantages put behind a paywall, not bonuses.
---
I really do not care about the response of redditers here. I am just taking a perfect opportunity to point my finger at idiots and say "ha haa, idiots". Whether or not you call me a child, dumb f\*ck or whatever else in response, I do not mind.
---
There is this bug but that guy would appear on fire.
---
Second this. Not one to jump into the middle of shit like this as it gets nowhere and is nothing but a pissing contest between those who are for and those who are against. Everyone has their reasons for loving/hating it, it is what it is. But when you have obnoxious asshole‚Äôs like this pissing on the wall instead of in the urinal, sometimes you just gotta piss on their shoes.
---
Anybody can get a Reddit account so you never really know . They could be in the comment section hyping up there own game. Like a 50/50 chance
---
I did. 76 is the last game I buy from Bethesda. Iykwim.
---
Never played it so can't say
---
Yikes
---
They probably weren't as hostile in the beginning as well, with the propaganda in them they were probably generally friendly towards civilians unless attacked until Eckhart.
---
exactly, the chump change isn't the issue. the issue is the message you're sending Bethesda.
---
it would indeed be petty if people were hunting down 1sters because of 10 bucks. thankfully that's not the case. they just have a problem with you enabling Bethesda.
---
I can understand their frustration, but the way they are doing things... it won't get better. I think at this point 76 has given most if not all it had to. I have expectations for wastelanders, but I don't see it competing with CyberPunk, which is also coming out in Q1.
---
Just hoping that, in the long run, they can make the game worth the full price. And that wastelanders doesn't break the game, in a negative way at least.
---
With player-hosted servers. Or releasing an offline version with wastelanders.
---
It's possible, but I doubt Bethesda cares that much
---
I'm not *demanding* anything, but I'm also not going to believe you unless you can somehow prove it. It's up to you if you want to be believed or not.
---
Someone: has a hobby
---
Aussiex01: comes in and ruins it
---
Someone: wtf?
---
Aussiex01: go find a new hobby
---
Clap, clap, clap. I'd laugh if it wasn't sad and frustrating. Seriously, look beyond those Zenimax balls that you're busy fondling.
---
Very funny
---
Poor Definition.
---
Would love to, but guess what? They got mostly removed by mods. Also I am currently unable to browse currently but I will gladly link those I can, in which I commented, since you can still read the title and it will be more than enough.
---
indeed, mobile gaming "evolved" into the cesspool it is today. change is not always for the better. same with home consoles and PC gaming, so much so that the EU is looking into lootboxes.
---
bottom line is that yeah, it is predatory business.
---
I don't want you to believe me I just don't want weird people commenting me that's all
---
The game's decent, but I'd hesitate to call it "great". Easily better than Fallout 76, but even Fallout 4 was, so...
---
But yes, the only time I hear someone talking about it is in retaliation against Bethesda. I'd feel bad about that fact if it weren't for the whole Epic Games exclusivity deal they made. Frankly, I don't give a shit what the reasons were for it or who made the decision, that costs you points in my book. Respect consumers and stop pulling the rug out from underneath of them for money. It's fucking hilarious that a game that satirizes capitalism gone rampant would even *consider* touching that monopolization tactic and even more hilarious that *no one is fucking talking about it*.
---
Go read any previous post with people enjoying the game and scroll to the bottom and find the rest of your negative brothers.
---
Ok then
---
Yep, totally, since Bethesda's target customer isn't anymore the ones that made them great before, good luck for them in them in the shitty world of greed and hypocrisy. R.I.P. Bethesda
---
Go to your ini files and tune down the shadow distance.
---
Maybe it just new players.
---
Dude this subreddit was made before Fallout 76 was even announced. Of course bethesda has SOMETHING to do with this subreddit.
---
Don't be paranoid. There are some people who care not about the microtransactions (I do though), and when they see a positive post they upvote it more compared to a normal post before the Fallout 1st outrage because they see that post as an oasis in a desert.
---
The message is I've played over 1400 hours &amp; I still enjoy it, so I still play it &amp; fallout 1st enhances my enjoyment.
---
What does pay to win mean in video games?
---
‚ÄúPay to win‚Äù essentially means that you can progress further, faster, through a game or win more often or more quickly by spending real-world money on various things relating to a game's monetization system.
---
_____________________________________________
---
In general a game is considered pay-to-win when a player can gain any gameplay advantage over his non-paying peers.
---
That‚Äôs why 1st is so wonderful. We don‚Äôt have to deal with the children anymore. We just come here for that.
---
Wooooow. Ridiculous!
---
So the Far Harbour DLC is pay 2 win?
---
*\*Everquest 2 hardcore player raising hand\** And no microtransactions.
---
you not right
---
scout repeatables only one per day no matter what server
---
‚Äãdaily only one per location right?
---
ie in the Mire 3 dailies but can do only one of them correct?
---
There is an easier way to cancel it. You don't need to do it through a support ticket. Through the launcher you can click on account management, transaction history, and the memberships and once you click on Fallout 1st there will be an option to cancel it.
---
Last patch. They won't do it again
---
Isn't GTA's in a way peer to peer though, with only a few things being handled by a server?
---
biv too, ok mby 20 h cooldown?
---
Okay, thanks. Looking forward to see those examples. 103,500 people engaging in targeted harassment and hate must have produced quite a hefty amount of threads.
---
That's my biggest beef with it. The content we paid 60$ for still isn't here, and what little there is, is broken.
---
Even the roadmap for the most part has been a joke.
---
There are only 3 dailies you can do every day (you can check them with your terminal in your CAMP), BIV alcohol daily rewards 1x random alcohol recipe, and 2 pioneer scouts daily; 1 in Toxic Valley (collecting toxic waste), 1 in Mire (collecting bug's parts) these two dailies have a chance to reward you a possum badges to buy bagpack mod, etc.
---
The dailies below are on a rotation; but they reward scrips :
---
**FOREST - 3 scrip**  
---
Ecological Balance  
---
Strange Brew
---
**TOXIC VALLEY - 3 scrip**  
---
Big Game Hunter  
---
Buried With Honor  
---
Pass the Buck  
---
Target Rich Environment  
---
Thrill of the Grill
---
**ASH HEAP - 5 scrip**  
---
Dross Toss  
---
Lucky Mucker  
---
The Chow Line
---
**THE SAVAGE DIVIDE - 4 scrip**  
---
Someone to Talk To  
---
Trick or Treat?
---
**THE MIRE - 7 scrip**  
---
Idle Explosives  
---
Play Time  
---
Queen of the Hunt  
---
Waste Not
---
**CRANBERRY BOG - 8 scrip**  
---
Cop a Squatter  
---
Heart of the Enemy
---
The daily you mentioned, Queen of the Hunt is in a 4 days rotation with other 3 daily quests. I'm pretty sure you need to go to the specific zone (aka fast traveling to the mire) to trigger it.
---
I played enough to level 3 characters to level 50. I am not actively boycotting the game, you can check my post history, I haven't said anything negative since around December. But I just cannot get myself to come back to the game. I haven't played in about 3 months, I see no reason to pay 12/month for what should be free, and there's not enough new content to get me to log back in.
---
I'm a fallout fanboy, I have loved the series since Fallout 3 and I have enjoyed the time I played Fallout 76. But there is not enough content to make me keep coming back. Mods are essential in Bethesda games, fleshed-out DLCs are essential in Bethesda games. I can accept these things. I can't accept denying mods and making people pay 12 dollars per month for a subscription service that doesn't really do anything.
---
At least I still have New Vegas to still fall back on.
---
It is our community, which is a shame valid criticism gets handwaved away as "hate". It's kind of funny to strike an inclusive note when the whole point of OPs post is "don't listen to those guys".
---
Lol no Ty I don't support MTXs they are not needed as live service games are not needed as they are not true games they get designed around MTXs and the game is always unfinished and subpar.
---
The name was leaked before the announcement, regardless the mod who made the sub sniped the sub during the announcement, Bethesda has nothing to do with any of the subs
---
I Can give you a bunch I guess. They are super easy to get
---
No, you just don't want anyone questioning you when you make up false claims.
---
the mothman dance pisses them off even more. 
---
i did the mothman dance after me and about 5 others took down the queen, and i did the dance...
---
and well lets say, i got chased around the map for about half an hour lol
---
How is a DLC p2w? Its usually just more content.
---
Wait what
---
yeah but Biv and scouts named as Repeatable, not daily, thats why im asking
---
So is a fridge.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why your getting so many down votes. Your making logic points. Coming from a conspiracy theorist .. not everything is a conspiracy.
---
Agree. Indifference is more dangerous than rage.
---
I'd rather pay 120 a year for fo4 support than fo76, tbh.
---
Why are you talking about loot boxes and mobile games ? 
---
I'm talking about Fallout it's stance on Micro Transitions and how thats evolved over it's life span?
---
And predatory business is a stretch at the end of the day the value is determined only by you.
---
I think I'm getting my value for money 
---
You do not, I assume and that's fine but you don't need to tell us that we are sheep or whatever for spending our money how we want, you wouldn't be happy if people started calling you poor because you didn't buy it.
---
and that's perfectly fine but either you're dense or just pretending to be. nobody cares what you do with your own time or money because that's your right.
---
what people care about is that your decision affects their life as well. you don't live in a vacuum. this game can only be played online, unfortunately.
---
My opinion is u can still play FO76 but maybe u play other games much more frequently than it. So that if Bethesda really make it a crazy-funding game u will have other options and move on like nothing has happened.
---
Well, as it happens this has happened to me. I just stopped going to the restaurant altogether. I only went back after I heard they had their shit together.
---
This is like telling someone to "google it". If you can't point to a specific example of targeted harassment and targeted hate then you shouldn't make the accusation.
---
How is a fridge comparable to a DLC expansion. I don't get it.
---
That‚Äôs true, I don‚Äôt understand why your getting so many down votes. Your making valid points. Coming from a conspiracy theorist .. not everything is a conspiracy.
---
I got a tse handmade early on and loved it. Except blowing yourself up occasionally. Then I just collected aa and furious handmades. I guess I just got familiar with them. My bloodied use melee and a rifle.
---
I'd wager if they can get away with it they will, and currently they don't seem to understand what is OK and what isn't.
---
Gey some nuka mines and nades, nade the mofos who attacks you, that won't initiate PvP so you can hurt them with rads and they cannot hurt you without rads.
---
Smoke or poison gas would be cool
---
Thank you :)
---
You can try r/fo76filthycasuals
---
That‚Äôs okay mate no worries
---
Well, they‚Äôre expressing their opinion, And that‚Äôs their opinion
---
Rofl. So many entitled people who downvote literal facts.
---
Exactly that is what the haters do they dont play the game so why care u just said it lmao
---
There just shouldn't be vats in pvp. Simple.
---
Rifles have been 90% of what I've used so far. I always try and use my radium rifle. Not super useful. But probably my favorite looking weapon in the game
---
Thanks to F76, I've literally no excitement for upcoming Bethesda titles like Starfield and ES6.
---
What's the point? Shit's gonna be on repeat.
---
No? It does work and? I bought a year twice for me n my friend we love the game
---
DLC also add new Weapons and Perks which gives you advantages.
---
If you are above 18 and a Xbox player I play with a player faction- there is over 100 of us and there is no fallout first drama. Some of us have it some of us don‚Äôt. We used discord- dm for info
---
I uninstalled it about a month ago and have debated putting it back on and off again. I'm only still on this sub because I forgot to unsub.   
---
I just wish they wouldn't destroy their community anymore than they already have
---
You can say whatever you want. It's corporativism.
---
U get more than enough atoms by just playing the game
---
Hey i want to praise the game for money too if that's a real thing
---
How do you "get views" on reddit?
---
because Fo76 is gonna "evolve" into more predatory transactions, such as lootboxes or mobile-esque monetization. or do you honestly think 1st is the end of Bethesda's greed?
---
&gt;And predatory business is a stretch at the end of the day the value is determined only by you.
---
arguably. like I said, the EU is looking into lootboxes for a reason. do you think they're predatory? or mobile games charging you thousands of dollars for the chance of rolling an avatar? is that fine in your eyes?
---
imo those three were added during the Wild Appalachia to prevent daily bugs. Before Wild Appalachia most of us couldn't even do Queen of the Hunt daily or any other mire dailies. 
---
Maybe they changed the name into repeatable just in case they reintroduced the old daily bug? iunno.
---
I literally do not get the hatred y'all. Like its beyond me ü§î
---
Sooo... P2W in a single player game? Great point there buddy.
---
Views was reference to attention/upvotes
---
Yeah it's fucked.
---
&gt; but I doubt Bethesda cares that much
---
The sad thing is that this really seems to be true. As a mod, you likely enjoy the fallout world, like us. Like us, you are probably sad about the entire downfall which we see playing out before our eyes.
---
I got it the JB HiFi Nuka Cola Power Armor version for $19 in a clearance bin. I bought it for the Pop Vinyl, the game came extra
---
Guess we will have to wait and see what they do.
---
(Not first member) I thought all the griefing was just beyond ridiculous. But I absolutely love the way you're looking at it! Let the war begin!
---
Refund!
---
It's exactly that. Candy crush tactics but you had to pay ¬£60 for the game still.
---
So basically, you want subs to undercut the prices of the scrap sold by non paying players. Seems legit.
---
I think you're being downvoted because you don't seem to understand how online marketing works on reddit.
---
You don't need to own the sub, just bots or paid trolls.
---
Exactly. Honestly, as much as I dislike the idea of Fallout 1st? I wouldn't care that it exists, so long as everything else was fixed first. Especially stability. At this point, if you buy 1st? You get to benefit from more stable server access. If you don't? You deal with what you get.
---
Adding onto that, that clearly didn't add more servers. They're reusing existing ones. This means, in theory anyways, the non private ones will have more people on them because of however many private are existing. More people means instability generally. Increasing your chances that you might just have a worse server solely because 1st exists. (Don't know how their server system works, so much or all of that may be wrong).
---
At the end of the day, if they released it after they fulfilled their promises of having the fully fleshed out game we thought we bought on release? This 1st stuff wouldn't be an issue at all. Sure I wouldn't like it, many others likely either. But fuck it. It wouldn't have been a slap in the face, nor ethically questionable. Those of us against it wouldn't have to feel like we're being ignored. We could just ignore it. Capitalizing on consumers when you haven't even fulfilled your end of the deal on the product you sold though? Man..
---
Of course I'm sad, personally I think First was a mistake, but we still aren't controlled by Bethesda
---
Can u start privat chat with me on here doesnt work for me
---
The positive posts will overpower the negative, the microtransactions will get worse and the cycle will repeat. Don't forget about those like us that only ever wanted this to be a good game.
---
That is exactly the point. There is no PVP in FO76. Well okay, there're workshops... but with all the one shotting going on, a fridge is not an advantage. You compete for nothing in FO76, is basically a SP with optional KOOP in a shared world.
---
OW is what people were hoping a Fallout game would be, and since 76 has been so rough, OW is filling that gap with similar gameplay, mechanics and humor. Hopefully the next Fallout game looks at what works for Outer Worlds and uses that for influence.
---
Due to work and IRL stuff I haven't had time to play much, 76 being one of them sadly
---
Anything to do with positivity is downvoted at the minute
---
Funny how the imagination can make you think something is different (good or bad) just to justify your belief in something else..
---
That sub is really good-quickly becoming my main fallout 76 sub
---
Not sure tbh, compared to the cost of living it's ridiculous though.
---
I just paid the same amount for Conan Exiles for fucks sake.
---
I see. But if they get upvotes, that must mean other people agree with them. Is that what bothers you?
---
I want but I cant
---
I agree with what you said but the game was released in a bad state and the backlash is inevitable with that. 
---
Also 10 dollars is nothing in some parta of the world, but due to currency it is expensive for me.
---
Survival is probably coming back at some point or another and there's still scattered handfuls of PvP on Adventure servers. For people who really focus on PvP as their main source of fun in the game, it's probably worth getting.
---
Then use chameleon gear or stealthboy; it is a hard counter againts VATS and people overly reliant on it are often pretty bad ads shooters. Anyway, to experience good pvp you really need to die a lot, learn from it and tune up your gear accordingly; no other way around it. Hope that helps.
---
I don't and I won't pretend too, but my point is the sub as a whole and the moderators. We are not owned by Bethesda nor are we in anyway swayed by them.
---
There is PVP in FO76, and its not a SP game, its that simple.
---
You can't have this shit in a multiplayer game and expect it to survive.
---
You're being disingenuous. Having an advantage doesn't mean it has to be competitive.
---
"In general a game is considered pay-to-win when a player can gain any gameplay advantage over his non-paying peers."
---
Maybe a stupid question, I don‚Äôt play survival. Armour ect aren‚Äôt transferable is it between survival and adventure?
---
More hate, cheer up, all the negativity can't be good  for you.
---
It's not currently available but that's how it used to work - you used the same character, loot, etc. in both Survival and Adventure.
---
You and Luigi are talking about complaining versus not buying. I'm not responding to the main thread, I'm responding to your and Luigi's comments specifically. No communication does not matter, companies will do what makes them money, they do not care what reddit thinks beyond how it affects their bottom line.
---
Personally, I can't. How can you enjoy a game where the developer spits in your face on a weekly basis and shows ZERO respect towards his customers? I haven't seen any game pull this much shit in this little time and not being dead yet.
---
It's not fine in my eyes but if someone wants that avatar who am I to stop them or tell them otherwise, what people want to do with their money is up to them at the end of the day
---
I don't really see it as Bethesda greed as I'm kinda okay with 1st I do agree that some of the prices of the arm shop items are a little steep compared to value that we have got in previous games but i still see the value in some oulfits or conveniences if it gets to the point where I don't I won't buy it
---
logic isn't negativity.
---
No problem I will just downvote you
---
Please go to the Glowing Sea, take off all armor and stay there.
---
HOW DARE PEOPLE SAY THEY ENJOY A GAME!
---
Yes but you are starting to only show the later.
---
Not sure if you were around for this song
---
Don't worry be happy listen as, it's a better way of living
---
Google fallout76... reddit does not show up on the first page, you have to search that shit out or google ‚Äúfallout76 reddit‚Äù.
---
I bought First because I wanted the unlimited Stashbox. So sue me.
---
That's exactly why so many of us called Bethesda out back when the repair kits and scrap kits came out. And everyone told us "we don't live off of conspiracy theories" and "It's not so bad it's just a small thing and it barely matters anyway". Yeah, repair kits weren't so bad. But they paved the road. Scrap kits paved the road to the collectotrons and fridges. And those paved the road to Fallout 1st. And Fallout 1st if allowed to grow will pave the road to them going full on ESO. Mark my words yet again, before the end of 2021, if the game still lives by then, they will be selling all DLC at a price, unless you are a active Fallout 1st member in which case you get access to the DLC untill your subscription runs out. Not with Wastelanders, that's too early. But 2 or 3 content updates after that.
---
I know exactly what you mean . So true
---
And no-one said that.
---
Op said that PR Team are out. It's easy and cheap nowaday to ask an intern to create a dozen accounts on Reddit and to go and post a few messages about the awesome experience they had in the game.
---
Of course you and other mods aren't paid employees nor brainwashed sheeps. You've given enough time and energy to allow us to express our anger to prove that.
---
But it's pretty amusing that right now, three days after Fuckyou First, we see a resurgence of posts saying "i've just started to play and it's amazing how this is cool or how some people are nice" etc etc.
---
We're not talking about the mods, there are hundreds of digital marketing companies who use Reddit to grassroot anything. They buy accounts with a few k karma and shill for whatever they're hired to.
---
There are literally thousands of videos on the subject on YouTube, along with reviews, articles, comments, threads, memes, etc. The game has been out for a year. If you still have *no idea* why people dislike the game then I don't think anyone can explain it to you.
---
He commented above that he‚Äôs never played 76 .... so there‚Äôs that.
---
Glowing Sea was in Fallout 4.
---
Legendary rates are exactly the same
---
No, that would be cool though to be able to put in poisoned drinks
---
Since Microsoft bought Obsidian, you can play the game for like 1 or 5 (insert local currency here). Take the first month of xbox game pass on pc, download the game, complete it in a month and cancel the sub for game pass. There is much no replay-ability but you get to enjoy the full story.
---
Point taken and I agree to some extent, I won't disagree nor profess to know if that's what they're doing, so I won't comment on something I don't know.
---
As for the positive posts? I get your point there too, but people were defending as well, a lot of them reported because people disagreed, but it's normal, it happened when people hated on 4 as well, we had a week or two of fire and brimstone then people calmed down and it reversed.
---
Put Nukashine, nuff said
---
MAX CAPS??? teach me the way Senpai
---
cringe
---
Yeah, I feel like a lot of us run longing fans are getting a taste of what BioWare fans felt a few years back with Andromeda and more recently with Anthem. Bethesda is one of the main reasons why I decided to try game design as a hobby and why I code for a living now. Seeing what's been happening has almost been painful. I don't believe in being devoted/loyal to a company to the point of fanboying but damn Beth had me close hey.
---
Haters gonna hate. 
---
The people who constantly complain about this game probably complained about the last game and will complain about the next. 
---
It has had a lot of issues (and I mean a lot!) but it hasn't deserved the hate that it's received. I've had a lot of fun with the game and I'm still enjoying it. 
---
At the end of the day, it's a game. If you enjoy it - play it. If you don't - move onto something else.
---
I commend you, on paper you're absolutely right. but in practice these companies employ tactics to trick people into buying their overpriced avatars. do you honestly think anybody **wants** to spend thousands of dollars to get, say, Cloud in that FF mobile "game"? no, they just want Cloud. no to declare bankruptcy. thus the term "predatory".
---
it's a thin line between interfering with legitimate business and protecting people from themselves, really. and the problem isn't really Fo76 in its current state. sure, 1st is almost p2w. and I don't even mind the overpriced cosmetics myself. the real problem is how far they're willing to take it.
---
but most importantly, and this is something people seem to ignore, the fact that some of the pass "features" belong in the base game by default, namely smoother connections and private worlds. they're taking things inherent to the game and selling them to you separately. that's absurd.
---
Why? Bethesda has dropped absolute master pieces for the past 20 years. The make one game that is out of their wheel house and all of a sudden they are the worst game makers that have ever existed.
---
As a huge fan of the fallout series i jumped into 76 and bought the power armor edition, bearing in mind i had never bought a +¬£100 edition of a game before... 
---
I tried to stay loyal to Bethesda, hoping 76 would improve but as of fallout 1st i feel like I've lost hope. As a customer who spent ¬£180 on a game for a plastic helmet, a trash bag and a few little figures i would have liked some extra rewards later on when playing the game. E.g. cosmetics (not tricentennial), atoms (not pitty atoms from the company).
---
I mean, controversial idea, but people who bought the power armor edition get a few months of fallout 1st free? Lets face it, Bethesda probably wont take fallout 1st away now, people are buying it after all. Bethesda could even let all 76 players have a month free to see of players like the idea of a private server but i doubt that'd happen...
---
What platform are you on? If you're on PC I've got a group who are happy to help out with PvP.
---
Light wood laminate, light wood laminate, light wood laminate!
---
GTA's private session are peer to peer which cost Rockstar nothing, Rockstar also don't need to make money from it because they have monetised the whole Online experience making it an extreme grind to get any where without paying money
---
You realize zenimax is the one who wanted money for private servers right?
---
Does this griefing actually happen? All the interaction I've ever seen regarding 1st subs was these subscribed people jerking each other off with exclusive emotes and outfits.
---
as far as I know this is an open forum and anyone is allowed to present their opinion. in fact, I was only pointing out that you're being dense by pretending to not understand the problem.
---
nothing negative about that.
---
I wouldn't look to GTA:O as a source of inspiration when it has actual pay to win and a grind designed to get you to buy in game currency.
---
It‚Äôs actually not. Any purchases through the Microsoft store are refundable unless stating so before you purchase. Helps to read the TOS...
---
Maybe it's because everyone that normally criticizes FO76 is gone since The Outer Worlds is out and they realize BGS will just take their suggestions and feedback and put them behind some kind of paywall.
---
Personally I pop in every once in a while to see if 76 is still a dumpster fire.
---
I understand that you think its a  problem. 
---
I enjoy the game so I support it, so I can keep playing. If no one supports the game then it gets abandoned. Not sure why you can't see that.
---
exactly I mean they were pushing the limit slowly just to see how it would pan out and since people were like well they said they would not do it but it is not that bad so who cares and now look at what is going on.
---
how do you get those stairs to stack?
---
If you're on PC, I have a group willing to help out with PvP.
---
I am not the OP. Upset people often lash out the easiest target they can find. In this case, it may well be the person on the other end of the reddit, like yourself. This is irrespective of your personal opinion or whatever.
---
It is possible that Beth people could make a post or two, never know. But I agree that, given their present public stance, they may not care so much as to bother. 
---
Keep your chin up, Synecdoche. Generally, people are grateful that you are bothered enough to be a moderator at all and give up your time for that. Issues with 76 and Bethesda aside, people like yourselves matter immensely. Just look at the lifespan for Morrowind, for example!
---
It's pretty good, if I had to describe the game i'd say it's a bit of a lovechild between KotoR and Fallout. The TTD system is a good bit like VATS and lets you slow things down and aim for certain body parts more easily, and the style of the zones you play through are very reminiscent of playing through each zone in KotoR. It's lacking in certain aspects, but that mainly pertains to the combat system. The combat is still fun, but it's just not very deep. The humor is exactly what you'd expect from Obsidian, and it's great. There are usually more choices than you originally realize when going into a situation.
---
Bring it on filthy normies!
---
It takes 10 bottles of toxic goo to kill a vault dweller so I don't think so
---
I understand on how far they will take it like I said if it gets to the point il stop and condone it but so far it hasn't, I actually thought 1st was probably the best value for money we have had in awhile since it pays itself back in atom points plus the rest, hence my defending I actually thought 1st was pretty freindly for people like me who do purchase atoms but I'm obviously the target audience too.  
---
As for mobile games I totally understand I play a game called mobile royal and I play it free I have guild mates that have spent 100s if not 1000s to gain "power" or higher stats that tend to be in the 1-5% incase, currently I'm doing a research that's 68days long or I can pay to speed it ( I wouldn't do that ) but my freinds will and it's completely bizarre
---
TSE Mini, TSE LMG, QE Harpoon.
---
Sell 5.56 for a cap each, almost everyone is doing it. Even after you've made 150,000 caps keep making more. Pretty much why most ask for trades nowadays.
---
I would be surprised if someone could survive getting blasted by a BE gatling plasma. Even with dense and fireproof - though I really don't know.
---
Dunno who clown daddy is, but qe harpoon was *born* to be used with raid pa.
---
I don't feel that the "reasons I like fo76" posts aren't genuine, there will be groups of people who feel the need to defend the game when controversy hits and I truly belive that's what we're seeing.
---
I also don't think this sub is compromised, if it was they're not doing a very good job at controlling community opinion, considering posts like these are up and thriving.
---
Just as a quick addition. I'm really disappointed in how Bethesda has decided to implement Fallout First, I would have much preferred a private character slot, on a private server in the hopes we could have more freedom for mods and the modding community, it honestly feels like an injustice to the people who kept their past titles entertaining for all the years after they were released. In an ideal world I would have liked to have had the ability to run a local server (for example private wow servers) with a separate character / non live character, would have had more modding freedom that way.
---
Yay, lootboxes where you can use your Atoms!
---
/irony off
---
That story about the guy saying "So Long, Partner" to the woman on Voice Chat had Bethesda written all over it.
---
It's also simple for me, most people didn't hate it and never joined in in the hate, they let you get it out and they'll start posting what they enjoy again, it's funny you think it's Bethesda PR
---
It's just a game - not the end of the world.
---
Class struggle.
---
"I'd like the community to pressure Bethesda for more actual content rather than moan about the Atomic Shop. Bethesda has to monetize the game somehow. This isn't a charity. Demand better content instead of free junk."
---
These aren't antithetical demands; in fact, they're intimately related. It's largely because of the lack of content that people are incensed when Bethesda starts paywalling the content that they do add. 
---
And this is not to say that any of the crap they have packaged up in the Fallout 1st subscription would necessarily add a lot to the game, but they could at least serve as reasonable rewards/incentives for playing the game. Instead, the pattern has been: release extremely underwhelming/borderline unplayable content (e.g., the vault raids), offer pitiful rewards for time spent grinding said content, and put the majority of really appealing stuff in the Atomic Shop. And no, the fact that the game 'gives' you Atoms doesn't really make the situation any better when Atom Store items are so expensive, and Atom accrual slows down dramatically by the time you reach endgame. 
---
I don't mind, at all, when good games that are generous with their content end up charging for that content outright, or through other means of monetisation (or both, as is the case with a couple of my favourite titles). But when you have failed to justify even the box price up to this point, it's a bit rich to ask for more money. Hello Games aren't running a charity either, but after releasing their barren bore of a game they have done nothing but deliver content drop after content drop *without* resorting to any of the shenanigans that Bethesda have pulled since release. 
---
THAT is how you turn the reputation of a bad game around; THIS is how you drive a bad game further into the ground.
---
But you can pay fallout first.
---
It‚Äôs remarkable to me how many people in this sub think their opinion is the absolute right opinion and anyone who disagrees is a plant from Bethesda or a troll.
---
The sheer amount of narcissism it takes to think that way HAS to be at the level of needing a psychiatrist.
---
I'm more than happy to be a target or to be some one you can't vent too, DM me on here or in Discord and you can vent to me for days on end, take your frustration out on me if it helps, I really don't mind, if it helps then great I'm helping.
---
I get people's anger I truly do, although I haven't played 76 yet even I'm upset over the whole thing. People need to realise I'm not disagreeing with them nor will I squash their opinion, my entire and only point is the sub and mod team aren't shills.
---
I'm a mod because I love fallout and I love the community, even now I love it.
---
I get what people are saying, yes Bethesda could make or buy bots and spread love and joy for 76, do I think they do? No, I don't think they care enough. But I'm fully aware they could.
---
you're wrong on at least two different levels. one because other games don't need this much "support" to succeed . TOW didn't even have pre-order bonuses.
---
but most importantly because you're still pretending not to understand the problem. people hate 1sters as you put it yourself because your decision affects their lives, even if indirectly so. no more, no less.
---
It become withdrawal only after sub has ended.
---
Correction: If you cancel at any time the snow disappears, so does you camp budget and you can't get rid of the Schorched Officer beep.
---
I do believe I might get to play fo76, once they do add privacy and world persistance. 
---
Private servers are a start.
---
Oh look, an alt f4 joke in 2019 ...
---
lol. I'm just gonna keep playing a great new game for $1 this month. 
---
Enjoy avoiding it for no reason.
---
I believe it. If Bethesda really were in charge, half if not all, of my comments would have been deleted and I would have been banned by now.  
---
I think what the OP meant was not so much that place is owned by Bethesda, but the fanboys combined with possible astroturfing accounts by Bethesda employees would affect the board.
---
Your words fall flat. Zenimax doesn't care about community spirit; it's all about the bottom line. They must have been well aware of what would Wastelander's delay and F1st launch cause - basically F76 became the most ridiculed game in relevant media space and split apart player base.   
---
But it seems the sales numbers exceeded the expectations, so there's that.
---
this would be a great suggestion but nobody at BGS is reading this. They will not listen to this advice, there is no money to be made.   
---
Yes, this game could be one of the greatest games but that will never happen with current management, never.   
---
I'm still playing but I have given up hope that this game will significantly improve.
---
Thanks. If it was always unlimited, then i understand the people who get the subscription for one month just for the box, but if it becomes withdrawal only, eventually that will empty and be pointless
---
&gt;I understand on how far they will take it like I said if it gets to the point il stop
---
I'm glad we're on the same page, then. just be aware that, by buying into Fo1st, as inoffensive as it may be at the moment, it sends Bethesda the wrong message. and that's scary because I don't want the game to go down the mobile route.
---
We bought the game you utter waste of space, so  fuck off with political bullshit and understand people can get pissed off when a game with an absolutely awful which peddles a 100 a month they can't even ensure works.
---
You seriously thought this was a good argument?
---
I‚Äôm 46 and make over 100k a year, I could care less how I look. You keep being mad and throwing a fit cause your not getting what you want. I‚Äôll keep smiling cause I have what I want.
---
Imagine being angry at people for the games they enjoy, yikes on a bike my guy, I mean personally I'm not a fan of it now, especially with outer worlds out, but yes, some people think that the game is amazing and theres nothing wrong with that
---
Don't be an ass.
---
Buy Outer Worlds, it's like Fallout meet Borderlands meet Mass Effect
---
Why does the advantage matter, when there is no competition? (And no, the PVP is a joke and was reduced to a bare skeleton of its former self.)
---
I doubt it. I don't see them do that any time soon to be honest.
---
I get that, and I fully admit my point wasn't put across correctly. 
---
I'm fully aware Bethesda can bot or account farm, and I won't disagree, my point was about the team and the sub, and I'm sorry for the confusion.
---
Serum bought for no more than 350 caps
---
Nore do I my actual first comment on first was, I feel this should have been pushed back and released alongside wastlanders, and it probably would have felt less offensive since we haven't had really any new content in the game in a few months. 
---
I'm glad they pushed back wastlanders I hope it lets them iron out some of them Bethesda bugs we all know about.
---
It is only valuable with Sentinel and perhaps Uny prefix, otherwise straight to scrip. Also PvP does happen, though very rarely.
---
Someone else bashing the current game without having paid it. Just like most of those articles you two read.
---
Well, Baden-Powel was a *bit* weird, but the title is a reference to his [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scouting_for_Boys)
---
Fallout 4 is the better game, by a substantial margin. So yeah, just play that instead. It's what I'd do if I hadn't already played 4 to death (not that I'm playing 76 anymore, either).
---
Yep, we can only hope they‚Äôll eventually add it to the atom store and make it available for everyone. I plan on packing the hell out of mine for the next month and seeing how long it lasts after my sub is up. Im expecting them to add sub exclusives every month or so to help keep people motivated to stay subbed.
---
Yeah and considering their track record, the jury is still out on whether or not that will be a complete mess as well.
---
 &gt; A lot of your old weapons will be obsolete, so probably not. 
---
Where are you getting this shit?
---
Don't worry your mother doing an amazing job
---
On PC :)
---
Very insightful!
---
That was indeed helpful. Thanks.
---
Already gave up when I (finally) uninstalled the game and the Bethesda launcher last friday. I'm done.  
---
I haven't bought anything from EA for I don't know how many years now, Bethesda is on that same list now.
---
And as far as the new Elder Scrolls game and Starfield go, expect at the very least another Fallout 76 disaster.  
---
And probably the same aggressive monitization.
---
What do you think of First? From your own experience so far?
---
Define ‚Äúunfinished‚Äù. The whole point is they will continue to add content/expand story over years.
---
If you're reluctant then I wouldn't bother. If you like Fallout because it's an RPG then you'll hate 76. If you want a multiplayer survival game then you have better options than 76. It's not worth the time, even if you got it for free.
---
When did "autism" because the new, lazy idiot's generic insult of choice?
---
I have a question if someone could help if I buy fallout 1st for a month and store my Scrap inside the box and my subscription runs out do I have a stash box I can pull stuff out of but not put stuff in?
---
How do i get it? Thats the stuff thag makes people passout and spawn somewhere random right
---
That sounds like a pretty good call, actually.
---
A huge mistake, given the number of problems still in the game. Accompanied by how they treated the scrap box issue compared to other similar issues. And to top it off, the fact that private servers are more stable, and let you farm workshops so easily (huge advantage there, no competition for them after all). While at the end of it all, those who don't pay? Get stuck with the still unstable servers. :/ Game still isn't even where it should have been before launching, really. It's a shame too, because so many people (likely you included), stuck by Bethesda through all the rough patches(heh. Rough patches.) Only to have the final outcome be prioritizing max profits over the consumers and community that paid for the game and trusted the company. Whether it be Bethesda's fault or ZeniMax, the game has reached a point it where this could become the new trend. Which I really hope doesn't happen. I still want to see the game succeed, but in the way it was initially intended.
---
I can only imagine how some of the devs behind the game feel about all this, given that those developers likely poured a lot of themselves into the game.
---
That said? I imagine very few believe you guys are controlled by Bethesda. Honestly, must be hard on you lot as well considering how much flak you must get from the few people who likely try to pass blame and frustration off in your guy's direction.
---
45s are on the rise with all the fixers being generated
---
While not playing F76 anymore, i found myself thinking that it's well-deserved. Paradoxaly, i'm sorry for that.  
---
But YOU are helping them making shitty decision, legitimating that "It sell so lets do it more".   
---
They're robbing us for basic features that the community ask for even before the beta, and you're letting them do as they want.
---
Well this post is stupid.
---
I sell a bunch of plans because they're low weight and as a lil tip you can get way more for your acid if you want.
---
I truly have to wonder if these people know other games came out since Fallout 76...like really fucking great games. They're aware of that right. Should we tell them?
---
  &gt; Put the Tinfoil hat down buddy.
---
He says, without a shred of irony, while promoting a conspiracy theory.
---
Bethesda Austin isn't the same as Bethesda Maryland.   
---
They're two different studios - Don't get them confused as the same entity.   
---
There's undoubtedly some cross over in some places, but they're fundamentally separate.
---
I'd say the reason it bothers people is because Bethesda will read it as "hey, our users like paid subscriptions that makes the game more convenient", which only makes Bethesda want to implement more. I assume the hate is there because a large group of people really dislike this and don't want more of it implemented. 
---
As seen before, Bethesda looks at atomic shop data in order to determine what to add to the game. What you buy in the atomic shop or wherever has effect on how Bethesda will change the game. 
---
I do in No way agree with the hate on other players, but I wish Bethesda would just not suck. xD
---
You go on discord and sell an item 10,000c a few times.
---
Nah I got what you were saying. You're good.
---
Are you really asking me why an advantage over a fellow player matters in a multiplayer game?
---
You still need to farm the scrap... it‚Äôs not like they give you unlimited scrap lol. If you didn‚Äôt have to grind for it you may have a point
---
They could but it's a trade-off. Each pound of snow will be a fewer pound of stash space, for the sake of server stability.
---
Grow up.
---
Look I've got to say that you could accuse my account of this as well. When I started playing 76, I needed to communicate on reddit about it, particularly in the trading circles. So I started this account, which is linked to my IGN. Almost all of the posts on this account are about 76, although in no way all of them positive, particularly recently.
---
I agree with everything you've said, unfortunately I'm almost at work so can't elaborate much more at the minute but I truly agree
---
And yeah we get a lot of flak, already had two "lmao kys" today and it's not even 10am, but I really don't care, it's part of the "job", I'm happy for people to rant at me or vent, everyone needs too.
---
People seem to think I'm sticking up for Bethesda and 76, I'm not, I'm sticking up for the mod team.
---
He was talking about you...
---
Friendly reminder that they were datamined to have party effects and wacky enemy movement speed modifiers and confetti explosions. Literally the only thing tying them to lootboxes at all is the vague assumption made by those who thought the name sounded suspicious.
---
I only got it a couple hours ago but it‚Äôs nice to have a truly stable world with nearly zero lag. It def adds a real sense loneliness which is something I kinda missed in a fallout game. I don‚Äôt feel any pressure to be anywhere to try and loot before someone else shows up, I‚Äôm able to enjoy it as an at my leisure single player game until I want to play with people then it‚Äôs a quick jump to do so. My stash box dropped by nearly 600 pounds just moving my scrap lol. So far I like but idk if I‚Äôll keep it more than the first month.
---
Oh my starfox!
---
No, i ask why it matters in Fallout 76, not in any game.
---
Yeah, collect every nuka quantum you see in order to craft it. Had a friend whose camp was on the way from vault 76 to the overseers camp, placed a punch bowl with free drinks and had a laugh at low levels disappearing and spawning at higher level areas.
---
It's not about the current state of the game, as stated in the original post, it's about the developers recent decisions. Milking money out of consumers with empty promises isn't something we can support.
---
I do that with series, it works well.
---
Yep I'd believe youtube, it's a place to go for facts :) The only way to know is to try it.
---
Stuff like repair kits, scrap collectors, refrigerators, and better scrap capacity have all been requests that a lot of people have had since day one due to people not liking the survival mechanics of Fallout 76. Any other developer would have made a free patch to the game to fix these issues or provide mechanics to solve them. But Bethesda instead decides to create a solution to people's complaints and keep it locked behind a paywall.
---
Want to no longer deal with annoying weapon degragation? More money please.
---
Want to no longer have to deal with the annoying issue of not having enough carrying capacity to carry all your scrap? More money please.
---
Want to be able to store food someone where it won't spoil as fast? More money please.
---
Probably the most likely answer to be honest.
---
I gotcha. You haven‚Äôt played in a year also. Play the game. Then see if it‚Äôs worth it. I‚Äôm categoricshoe47 on Xbox. If your on Xbox also friend me and I‚Äôll invite you to my server next time.
---
Well with the price difference you can pay for a VPN and buy your sub pretending to be American and pay their prices
---
Way to prevent it is to use week weappks and no bloddy mess. So basically lose in PvP
---
What if the next games are good?
---
So why can't Bethesda do the same? Its not like these servers are suppose to hold that many people or stay on for that long to begin with.
---
Any automatic weapon can cause it if you are using bloddy mess.
---
Not if the barrier to entry is $100
---
True that, I don't expect that, but I'm talking about value here.  For $12.99/mo I get my unlimited cell phone plan paid, and a 6-pack of beer.  It just makes no sense to me to pay that much for a game on a monthly basis.  For you or other folks that $12.99 might be just some lunch money ;)  It's not about being poor, it's about being smart with my money.
---
i imagine you need some legendary god rolls to do that lol
---
If only they waited till after Wastelanders released to bring out this membership, I would‚Äôve had a bit more respect for them, for me it‚Äôs the fact Wastelanders got delayed AND then this membership was released that is really a nail in the coffin.
---
If you're willing to join the Brotherhood, message me on Discord. 
---
Looch#7529.
---
Now if only they'd fix the battle that never was
---
True, but 45s are still easier to find than 5.56. Usually get around 20 per enemy while ~5 for 5.56
---
I'm using it advisedly here. One of the issues with autism is that people who suffer from it have a great deal of difficulty seeing the world from other peoples' perspectives and understanding other peoples' ideas, which makes social interactions difficult and frustrating for them. 
---
I'm pointing out that OP seems to be, similarly, incapable of understanding that other peoples' experiences might differ from his own, assuming greed and dishonesty are the only reason why anyone might not be on the same page as he is. 
---
I agree that the term does get overused and misused a lot, but in this case I'm using it precisely because this is the sort of thing that someone on the autism spectrum would say and do.
---
If you get in your power armor and get out you can have the bug without the flames
---
Keep the code and get a cheap and used xbox instead, that way you can transfer shit f2f w/o any danger.
---
Because its unfair to the people who don't have it.
---
Especially in 76, which is a game that to this day is still in a barebones, beta state.
---
Warframe is both not an FPS and is also not focused on PvP...
---
The point is that Bethesda has started work on implementing lootboxes into the game. At any time in the future they could finish and release it.
---
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre the worst game makers, they have made some fantastic games. Even 76 has been enjoyable. It‚Äôs just the way they are operating their business now, it feels like they are just being greedy and taking advantage of fans.
---
Why is it unfair in a game where people don't compete, just because it's mp? but it's okay when it's sp?
---
Yeah, and that's something so many don't understand. That just because you're a mod, it doesn't mean you need to take the side of Bethesda. Or even take a side at all. Just gotta keep the peace as best you can.
---
Sucks to hear about the salty fuckers, though. Even those responsible for all the changes lately don't deserve that kinda shit.
---
With some luck though? Things will get through to the devs and decision makers, and they'll see that pushing too far could cripple the game's future. Or alienate people from their brand. But yeah! Have yourself a good shift, I'm going to be headed to bed myself. Best of luck with the chaos around the sub Reddit!
---
GTA Online sells actual ingame money and true pay to pin. Last I played it was $100 just for 1 million bucks in that game which can basically get you 2 cars. Why do people they Rockstar and GTA V is a god example or argument against FO76???
---
Or they could read the dozens of threads here. At this point if people don't get the issue its because they don't want to get the issue.
---
This stuff wasn't in Fallout 4. The code for the special lunch box effects were specifically made for Fallout 76
---
This is illogical. You don‚Äôt care what people do with their money, but then care if what you do with your money effects them. I honestly don‚Äôt give a shit. I play one or two games a year. I‚Äôll be playing 76 for years. Not saying you don‚Äôt, only speaking about myself, but I have a career and family. GAMES, specifically how they are monetized, and whatever other bullshit everyone says about it, is somewhere below clipping my nose hairs and above zombies being real on my list of things I give a worry about.
---
I accept that they are two different studios but they are operating under the same umbrella and unfortunately it‚Äôs damaging their reputation regardless of the studios involved.
---
I didn't tell anyone my money was stolen, i was in fact fairly clear that i didn't buy the game.  But if someone sells you a diamond for $1000 and the gem was in fact just a pretty plastic, i'd consider that theft by deception.  Thinking about it, that's pretty much a 1 for 1 metaphor to the canvas bag that wasn't canvas.
---
To be fair, i consider lots of games today a market of theft.  Being capable of spending thousands of dollars on a game is enough to say something is wrong with the pricing structure.  No amount of 1's and 0's is worth that much money.
---
Anyhow, if your going to get defensive and demand i don't do something, let me demand something of my own.  Don't defend this game.  No matter how you swing it, Their are tons and tons of games that give way more value for a persons dollar, both in the base game and in optional DLC.  As for the company, i think the track this game went tells me not to trust my money on their games.  This is irrelevant as to whether they are being greedy or they have a partnership with some greedy company.
---
These kind of posts are fake, i see 1 of these every week about how something really funny/unique/awesome happened to someone.
---
this is hilarious lol
---
OW as in Overwatch? It did have a pre-order bonus in the form of Noire Widowmaker. Unless you meant something else in which case ignore me!
---
A good sniper build to take these guys down. It certainly worked for me.
---
Then educate yourself on what‚Äôs going on. Watch YeaYong‚Äôs videos and you‚Äôll see.
---
I just don't see it. A lot of games have a premium sub. While I feel what you get for FO1st isn't that great its really not out of the blue.
---
I mean personally for now I‚Äôm keeping my subscription going, but if you manage to get 2000 pound of scrap in that box and cancel tour subscription then it‚Äôs not really pointless as that will keep you going for ages so I wouldn‚Äôt consider it pointless after you get the ranger outfit and atoms too.
---
&gt;We know the mod community loves Bethesda
---
just an in between, but the mod community doesn't love Bethesda, Bethesda has been working against this community for years. They love their games. And Bethesda knows that if they do not allow mods to be used in their games their games sales would be significantly lower. They need the ability for mods to be played, to fix the major bugs that they don't want to fix. To make the game prettier and basically to make it viable for a company as large as they are. They've tried to sell mods to the fans with creation club and if the mods would "love" Bethesda they would all shill over to them, but they saw the contract (which means that bethesda pays you once and they reap all the profits from the mod you made) and they said nah. 
---
So please be clear about this. The mod community loves the games, but disagrees vehemently with the business practices the company adheres to.
---
Not at all. If that were the case they would have made it so that she only spawned when you nuked fissure site prime directly. Its just a great strategy so that people who arent power armor builds can fight her too.
---
I don't know, maybe they want or need to have more control over the servers, maybe a peer to peer server is much less secure then their own company hosted server making it easier to combat hackers.
---
Ps4 player here :/
---
I suppose there is always a lesson to be learnt from this, especially as you code now. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs in game design but at least you know what not to do with a game üòÇ
---
BioWare, man! I used to love Mass Effect so much!
---
Are you a troll?
---
Cooking is great. As long as you only cook the glowing meat and other stuff you can get in a nuke zone (40+ glowing meat from WS). Clear half my days caps and a bucket of XP just cooking/selling ghoul chunks.
---
Basic sense? Are you new to games and expansions?
---
Fair enough, i will retract my statement about that particular Todd statement.  My formal apology for inaccurate accusation talk.
---
For that one matter, lol.  Theirs still far too much about this whole games launch that sits ill with me.
---
Psychological advantages, not real advantages.
---
Nostradamus was also spot on about 9-11.
---
Ah the good old Argumentum ad hominem, obviously you have no arguments. Q.E.D.
---
Btw do you know what's really unfair? That a level 5 player can't hold workshops against a level 50 player. But not a fuckin' fridge.
---
And it seems like you don't understand that I already knew that. Thought my reply would've been clear enough to realise that...
---
I also felt a little strange about games being the same price here in Europa since our currency is worth more but this is another level of "scamming" i feel.
---
We shouldn't have to pay more when our money is worth more...
---
Don't stress about trying to make them, it only takes a few months of normal play, sell what you don't need etc before you're looking for a cap dump cos there's nothing to spend them on
---
Already been told that

The Outer Worlds

You wanna know something really funny? Bethesda *created* Zenimax.  Beth not only predates Zenimax (by 13 years), but was the reason for it's foundation.  After the financial disasters that were Battlespire and Redguard, Bethesda gave birth to Zenimax in order to staff it full of investors.  Investors that staged a coup to kick out the companies original founder/lead game director.  This is why Morrowind was such a big shift from Daggerfall, and why the company kept moving even further apart from it's earlier works. The series founder had been kicked out of the series by corporate suits, so the games kept drifting further from his vision with ever iteration.  
---
So Zenimax has been fucking with Beth ever since the beginning...
---
I'm sure you could, if you hit them enough times with it. Only problem is finding some way to equip it.
---
Fallout is dead to me.
---
not at all. it's the same as with free speech: you're free to say whatever you want but you're not free of repercussions.
---
and I'd love to see if you can keep up that attitude if they go the mobile route and start monetizing your ammo.
---
&gt;Queen of the hunt I think only happens when someone Nukes the fissure in Watoga,
---
I think you might mean Scorched Earth, which is an event, not a repeatable or a daily, that is triggered by nuking Fissure Site Prime.
---
Queen of the Hunt is a daily Mire Quest that activates just by stepping into the area of the map, and the objective is to check three spots for a cryptid (Flatwoods monster, Sheepsquatch, Snallygaster etc) and then kill it.
---
Aw, I did the exact same thing with an alien and some Vaultboy cutouts.
---
Your use of 'apologist' establishes your premise. Nope. I see many things that continue to be screwed up with the game. Frankly, I'm definitely not 'sorry' in any twist of the meaning nor am I apologizing. For those that are unwilling to spend money, that's a choice. For those that act surprised that a money making enterprise changes a business strategy after making inconsistent statements to the contrary, well, that's just naive.
---
Its a question, are you trolling me?
---
Its unfair because you pay for benefits that your peers don't have if they dont pay.
---
Like, being able to store infinite junk, like having the ability of putting a camp down for free and never being over encumbered again, etc.
---
Make marine helmets and sell to vendor bots. Run Harper's Ferry and sell all the weapons. I don't need tons of caps. I just occasionally buy ammo or mats from other players.
---
Lair, lair, pants on fare!
---
It's profiteering, plain and simple.
---
I understand that games have premium subs and a lot of those are justifiable. Personally, I don‚Äôt think this game has done enough to justify a premium service. I like the idea of playing in a private world especially for roleplaying purposes however the actual cost outweighs what you actually get.
---
I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre wrong by the way and I respect your opinion. I just feel that the morals of Bethesda at present come across quite shady.
---
How can something be unfair if there is no competition?
---
Reminds me of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQhUOvYUBss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQhUOvYUBss)
---
Works for trump üòÇ
---
Holy fucking shit.
---
I like fallout 76 for the most part. It just clearly needs love or combatant marketing at least. Shouldve dropped the wastelanders, then fallout 1st
---
And not only that, if Beth is successful in selling a monthly subscription to a bad game, it sets an example to other bad companies to do this. Imagine most big games launching in the future full price and locking content behind a subscription. Its madness.
---
Massive open world with tons of cool regions to explore. Very detailed lore / story. Free Large expansion DLC coming in a few months.
---
hmm, i might take you up on that
---
Oh yar, I just hope it becomes a lesson learned by devs themselves and by the players spending money on these things.
---
Lol learnt that years ago xD Unfortunately it's become more of a hobby due to the work climate in South Africa but I do work in a dev postition and I do occassionaly do freelance work for tiny indies :p
---
Definitely used to be my favourite Sci-Fi series of games, pretty damn depressing what happened to BioWare man.
---
So, there breaks your logic, huh?
---
Here's the truth because I see you commenting "Any suggestions on how to monetize a game with FREE DLC?!??!" 
---
They had a microtransaction shop and they were big dick Bethesda cocky. They thought 76 was going to sell incredibly well and that people would be buying tons of cosmetics. 
---
So basically the had a horribly plan, to begin with. Because the cosmetics in this game...well they're boring and overpriced. And 76 sales tanked. BUT they have no new games coming out for the next few years. They need to make money. 
---
So the logical next step would be to go free to play and monetize everything but keep the grind fair, like Warframe and like Destiny is doing. And Warframe is EXTREMELY respectful of its customer base, and you can buy virtually EVERYTHING in that game, but you can also earn virtually everything. 
---
But then you get into the core issue of 76 doesn't have a gameplay loop to support a free to play system like that because it's not really a looter shooter. So they pull this bullshit. 
---
So Bethesda shipped an unfinished game, with a bad business model at launch. They promised things to the consumers that, to be fair, they never asked for. I'm sure fans would have been fine paying for DLCs. 
---
So my suggestion to Bethesda is this. Stop bleeding your gullible fans dry. Stop making it seem like you need to "keep the lights on" so that the OP has no more excuses to buy 1st, and use that money from your 6th port of Skyrim to cover the costs.
---
So go to the outerworlds sub.
---
That's actually Todd telling us beforehand so when anyone tells him they lied he can claim that actually the privileges of 1^st were known since before the game first released /s
---
Oh, great. I was downvoted so hard I had to remove my comment when I pointed this out yesterday.
---
Both games are worthwhile. Stop trying to come here and spread hate. You want to haye then do so. But outerworlds has its own flaws and merits just as fallout 76 does and they can each exist outside and independently of one another. You can like one, the other, or both. Stop being a jerk about it and let people like what they like.
---
1st STASH IS NOT UNLIMETED
---
2nd SERVERS ARE NOT STABLE
---
If there‚Äôs a cost for free speech that‚Äôs not free. Just speech. Especially if that cost is intimidation or harassment. Imagine if, wherever you may live, you had free speech, but the government could arrest you if they disapproved of it. Feel free?
---
Pretty soon they're just guna sell meta legendaries out of the atom shop.
---
It‚Äôs also single player and not a massive open world game. Totally different animal.
---
Bruuuuuuh....
---
Played Outer World's, like it kinda, especially some of the characters. Got a tiny bit bored, so I'm back with this game till the weekend
---
See you there!
---
Well lv 303 in fo 76 and lv 22 in outer worlds. Outer worlds is a kind of miracle NO bugs good graphism a terrific story and many more things..!
---
BUT there is no this freedom sensation that you have in Fo76. This is my point of view. I won‚Äôt play back in fo76 I will wait for the DLC in 2020.
---
But yes Outer Worlds is a great great game.
---
"There is no war in Ba Sing Se"
---
keyword being government. private entities can and will fire you for wrongthink, for example. you're still free to say whatever and they can't stop you, even the aforementioned private entities. but in this case you're going to face some repercussion.
---
and you completely ignored the second half of my post.
---
Yea it was foxed
---
I can't imagine you leaving FO76 as long as the market stays alive. The funny thing is the market stays calm as it always is even after this 76 First mess. Surely, meeting nice people through playing the game is the most precious thing... Keep up with your good work in the market, sir!
---
&gt;Definitely not a bug, just a wonderful "surprise event"
---
Until Halloween wears off, this is officially considered a seasonal feature.
---
But the real spooky thing about the pic is the low resolution of the already creepy Mr. Fuzzy's face.
---
So, gather 'round while I elucidate
---
What goes on when it gets late
---
[...](https://youtu.be/vLLVjtI3QGI)
---
I feel exactly this way. Also, what the hell am I going to do in the game to justify the spend? I've done abso-fucking-lutley everything and been everywhere and there's nothing left. I've been playing Borderlands and The outer Worlds instead and they've been so much more fun. I'll nip into the Halloween FO76 event tonight to check it out and that's it I imagine, I doubt it'll make me want to play it more than once. I did pop in last night just to look at the Halloween stuff in the store, and I ended up travelling to Freddy Fears to get the photo challenge atoms. The mischief Jester bot is there until the event starts tonight and it was a fucking awesome little bot with really well done dialogue that sounded clipped from various holo-dramas, and I admit I got a teeny bit excited. But I know better than to let it get to me... I've been hurt baby, and it still stings.
---
Honestly finding OW a bit boring. It's a good game, no real problems with it, it just hasn't gripped me with the story, and that's supposed to be one of its major strengths.
---
There is a difference  between making a game financially  ok and screwing over players. I absolutely hate it that their trying to say we enjoy this pay to win shit and that we have been asking for more. The atomic shop is constantly updated yet we still have so many bug some of which have been here since release. If they fixed their game and then tried this it wouldn't be so bad, but coming from somebody who payed $80 for this buggy mess they have not earn the right to ask anything of us.
---
It partially our own fault as we just make a fuss when something happens but then it blows over. The sad part is that even tho probably 70% of fans are angry, 30% will keep playing and buy whatever bull suit Beathesda releases.
---
\- Multiples bugs at release (and sure there still plenty)  
---
\- Unbalanced over multiple features (legendary, settlement budget, PvP, etc. . .)  
---
\- Stash limit  
---
\- Broken loot ( like getting only a normal drill on boss/chest ? )  
---
\- Lack of perks loadout  
---
\- Atom Shop getting out of cosmetic-only to get repair-kit and fridge  
---
\- Fallout 1st locking features behind paywall. Features asked by the community before the Beta, during the beta, between beta and release, etc. . .
---
You're right! they said that we cant mod iur private servers yet.
---
Don't tell people in a game sub to don't play the game.
---
And do you get money from obsidian for your pitiable sad  advertisement?
---
Fuck you
---
Some of the venting and complaining does get a bit much but I can sort of understand that more than the idea of defending a multi million dollar company like a scorned family member. 
---
I'd rather hear someone complain here than some of the utter garbage takes over on the other subreddit. Complaining that people are entitled and claiming this is just a fun little pet project for Bethesda so we should cut them some slack for the issues. No wonder there are accusations of shills in the sub with dumb blind loyalty like that.
---
That‚Äôs an offline game... single player... no servers and ongoing costs...
---
there are other games that survive without resorting to this. more to the point, that's Bethesda's own fault. ever since the reveal of Fo76 people have been asking for offline, local, private servers. not premium passes.
---
Ha.
---
Imagine logging in an lose your camp when the spot is occupied, that was hard lol
---
I haven't gone far with my Overseer levels so I don't know personally, but I've read on this sub that many terminal and possibly holotape entries have a date that's after the one we have in game in adventure, so it's probably all going to be future content.
---
As of right now Vault 51 doesn't even have a map marker, unless that changed very recently.
---
Not sure if you should be letting games affect your marriage bro...
---
Those of you who quit, we who still play would love to look through your inventory and see if you have what we‚Äôre missing.
---
What are rewards for that event? Another craps like in Meat Week?
---
I think it‚Äôd be cool if they made those as the bags for when people dropped items. Give a player some health or food with the confetti effect from FO4.
---
Sorry, but i'm really not spreading hate, I'm just saying if people didn't shill to fallout 76 then people would not get such a mess of a game. Bethesda would actually have to deliver a quality product to sell to people, like the people at obsidian did.
---
I‚Äôm just saying outer worlds is a pretty terrible example. They have no future content to fund and no ongoing cost to manage. 
---
They said from the very beginning this is a multiplayer online game. They said a year ago that private servers would be hosted by them. Acting shocked now when they delivered what they said they would in terms of private servers is a bit absurd.
---
From the noclip documentary, a BGS Austin guy joked about how he recognized *Morrowind* code in the engine. Then immediately followed that up with a somber "it all has to go."  No idea how much Morrowind code is really left, but maybe the new expansion will be remained Ashlanders.  And they'll randomly call you an N'wah.
---
At this point, it couldn't hurt. 
---
But on a more serious note, with the game's current trend it seriously wouldn't surprise me if we got lunchboxes with Wastelanders.
---
I'm sorry this is a fallout 76 topic. It wouldn't really work if i told the people at the outer worlds sub how great their game is compared to FO76. Just as an aside, any game is better than the mess that FO76 is. Now with extra micro transactions.
---
My Citation would be the popularity of The Outer Worlds. Nobody is buying fallout 76 on the same week as the highly anticipated release of a similar game that has much much better reviews. Personally, I made a new character recently because of the delay of wastelanders. My original plan was to wait and level a new character when it came out but because of the delay I made a new character now.
---
You have absolutely no proof that new characters are new players.
---
The man does have an interesting biography. I like his final letter to the Scouts especially this excerpt.
---
&gt;Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best.
---
No, it didn't. Like I said before, it doesn't need to be directly competitive, you're still paying to get an advantage that non-paying people don't even have access to. The social aspect of it still matters. And less drop that notion that a multiplayer game cannot be competitive. Having an hat that other people might not have by itself makes it competitive, its the whole social aspect of it.
---
Again, a small advantage over someone that didn't pay, is still an advantage, hence P2W.
---
I really hate the "i do realise they need to make money" argument. It gives them the power to do whatever the fuck they want. They already made money with this game. Maybe they should just move on to the next project. Just because they made the game online they expect it to generate infinite profit with bare minimum work possible.
---
You're saying that theres a chance to run across not one but, three scorchbeast at once?ü§î
---
Yeah, it's a much smaller game, maybe play it through a couple more times. It's meant to be repeated to find more juicy story, from all the NPC's and characters that are in that game.
---
Join us, Brother...
---
what makes you not bored to play this game then?
---
Wont be disappointed. Absolutely loving it.
---
are you sorting by new? because all i see is complaining in hot
---
&gt;They have no future content to fund and no ongoing cost to manage.
---
and that's also their own fault. release a complete game instead of this "games as a service" garbage. as for the latter, it's like I said: wanna cut costs? release the server files.
---
&gt; They said a year ago that private servers would be hosted by them.
---
I'd love if you could link me that last bit because all I remember them saying was that "private servers are coming eventually", no word on whether they'd host them themselves.
---
in fact, lots of og players were waiting for actual private servers so they didn't have to be limited by Bethesda's incompetence, and play however they wanted.
---
I buy serums from players vending machines and sell them to the vendor bots with grape mentats and hard bargain perked out. Sell my good legendary finds on here, the regular ones in my vending machine and the crappy go to scrip.
---
Outer worlds is an amazing game. Its everything fallout should of been but wasn't. I genuinely think people should boycott Bethesda now. They've proven time and time again, they don't care about gamers or games. They only care about money. Look at how many versions of skyrim are out? They use it like a cash cow. The only way they will ever change is if all gamers come together and boycott them. Until that happens keep expecting rubbish games with large price tags plus a stupid subscription...
---
If they aint making money how do you expect free content then lol?
---
I haven't looked into it yet, but the other day I came across this thread and saved it.

---
Currently at +1814, so I guess other fools agree with you.
---
People clearly are either buying it or a lot of people are making new characters and asking for help because ... they can?
---
Your ‚Äúcitation‚Äù requires the assumption no one is buying a cheap game instead of a full price one. 
---
Sorry... you‚Äôre a combination of narcissist because you assune you‚Äôre right and everyone else is wrong, and very clearly misdirecting your child like anger at your fellow players instear of the company who actually makes it.
---
But I digress. It‚Äôs impossible to teach a zealot to look at both sides of an argument. It‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt teach a racist. You think you‚Äôre right and can‚Äôt accept the possibility you aren‚Äôt. Parents must have seriously helicoptered you for you to be this closed minded.
---
Good luck in real life after you graduate highschool. Jobs don‚Äôt accept people with that kind of mentality.
---
Majority of the player don't care how much they're letting Bethesda f\*ck them up.  
---
Gaming industries already know they're nearly free to do as they want, for the just go slowly. One day we'll need to buy pass/subscription to get more weapon slot, level and perks, right from the release.
---
I think the majority of people were saying that before they realized you cant just server hop your private servers like the old days for new loot.
---
Well said. Stash space was outrageous on release, I endured it until they could make it better.
---
And now they can make it better, but they won't if you don't give them money every-single-month?
---
Get fucked Bethesda. Hope you step back on this bullshit crapbox and tent before it's too late.
---
FO76 is just following behind ESO with their similar subscription policy. Doesn't take a genius to predict it would go this way.
---
I respect your opinion.
---
I disagree with it, but respect it. And your bravery in eating so many downvotes.
---
I used to server hop for technical documents in the whitespring bunker and many times the container loot respawned, how does that work?
---
I mean it is, but aren't quite a few standards? I mean it sounds like I'm grabbing at straws, cause I am, but there really isn't any measure out there appropriate : / not like there is an ISO rating for fun etc
---
Simplified, it comes down to do what's fun, no? Again subjective. I don't use Netflix myself, got rid of it years ago, wasn't much of a factor in my consideration. The movie one isn't great per se but it's a good generalization.
---
I'm fine with it because I can kinda farm acid from hemlock now without some cuck killing me just to leave the server once he takes the workshop.
---
Legendaries &amp; ammo in the vendor sell the best for me
---
It is strange how this sub has 207k people in it, but it is not as active as other subs with far less people. This means that either some of those people are bots, or people don't care anymore and just forgot to leave.
---
Then it's a session based loot container or tech documents have a low expire date.. unknown at this moment.
---
&gt; No, it didn't. Like I said before, it doesn't need to be directly competitive, you're still paying to get an advantage that non-paying people don't even have access to. 
---
Also true for SP games.
---
 &gt; The social aspect of it still matters.
---
I'd say psychological. "I want that, because Jimmy has it!"
---
The thing is, in a non competitive but cooperative environment, your advantage is not unfair, since it does take nothing away from me, it does not reduce my chances to accomplish any objective and your progress on your objectives does not intervene in mine, it might even be my advantage as well, when we happen to team up.
---
They can kill you if you take a workshop without you even shooting back. Some players just wait for people to take workshops and go hunt them down.
---
The price is a scam actually everything in the game is a scam the prices are just too high in the atomic shop the subscription if it weren't for the scrapbox and the small camp thing I wouldn't mind and maybe I wouldn't see has a problem since private servers cost money but since you want to have those super nice features you have to pay for a private server too and that makes it absolutely over priced for a game that has no endgame stuff to do 
---
I think if they made lower prices it would be no problem for the players and there would be less hate on them. Like instead of asking 2000 atoms for a skin they could lower it to half or a third and the sales for it would increase and maybe even making the same amount of money or even more the same goes for the subscription but I think to be able to lower the price for the subscription they would have to separate the private servers from the subscription since those servers cost a lot and make it very hard to lower the price for it
---
Sell stuff in my vending machines, sell excess scrap to vendors.  Kill every super mutant i see.  Use the cap collector perk.
---
Nobody said you are.
---
Classic lol
---
Damn OP you weren't kidding. [The OP of this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/do6jop/the_best_3_minutes_of_my_life/) has only been on reddit for 2 months, and that's their only post. It's got 4 awards, too. Highly sus. 
---
I defended this game and the PR around it, even during the "bag" fiasco, but this is shady. I honestly don't know what happened. It seemed things were turning out for the better, despite all of the controversies, and then this. Idk what Bethesda could do at this point that could fix any of this, and at this point I don't really care.
---
I'll wait 5+ years for FO5 and see what happens.
---
I don't know, guess I like exploring in this game more, plus lately I've found it hard to play any game for a long period of time. This one I feel like is a little better for shorter sessions, like during a lunch break, where I have a little handheld computer to play the game on.
---
The Outer World's, I feel like I need to spend most of my time on, which is getting hard for me these days. It's a rare occasion where I'll even finish a game these days. Think the last time I did was in February with the three Metro games, and I was surprised I finished them, especially Exodus.
---
Clap clap?
---
Wow you really are angry and invested in this. I probably have double the game time that you do and you think you know the player base better. Which group do you play with? How many people are on your friends list? Do you even have discord? Your only evidence of new players is seeing a handful of new characters at the vault and that's supposed be taken as more than an anecdote? Get down off your soapbox, you are making an absolute fool of yourself.
---
You mean the very same DLC that should've dropped in September? Then fall now we're suppose to believe it will *actually* be out in 2020? Hmmm... nothing Bethesdasay is true. They've destroyed what was an amazing game series by trying to turn it into a cash cow just like skyrim. They're exploiting vulnerable people with micro transactions, and now should have to pay extra to get a stable game? Really?! Who even thinks if this bs?!
---
I never heard someone cry because you can get access to DLC in a single player game and try to argue it as P2W. Congrats.
---
Its unfair because your neighbor is getting more for the exact same work.
---
YeaYong.... LMAO. That man is a joke.
---
Shotguns were the only thing that worked for me in the levels 20s to 50 or 60s when I got my first Laser Gatling, I don't get how everyone says they are worthless? Hell I killed a bunch of Scorchbeasts with them and even got loot to Queen fights. 
---
And it was with a non legendary one, and with the rifleman perks instead of the shotgun ones.
---
It does t stack how youd think. It just goes into effect twice so you get 2 50% chances to heal.
---
That man does a lot for to educate the gaming community about scummy practices that game companies try to pull on us. I have nothing but respect for the guy. Why is he a joke?
---
&gt; How can you enjoy a game
---
You can enjoy a game because it's fun.  Nobody is spitting in my face and the only people who are disrespecting me are people who claim I'm a paid shill or a bot.
---

---
Mmmm... but there do exist PR and marketing companies that can be hired to flood social media sites and generate a ton of posts supporting whatever opinion you like, so long as you pay them to do it.
---
So just because this sub has no formal connection doesn't mean that the PR drones aren't out in force.
---
Well, there's something wrong with *somebody* around here, but I don't think it's me.
---
You do this for free
---
Are you on PC?
---
That logic is flawless, good job
---
How do you get them and are you on PC?
---
I agree with you on this. The way I see it, Fallout 76 is starting to only appeal to poeple willing to spend houndreds of dollars on it. You shouldn't have to spend money to play a game in my opinion. However, companies will be companies and charge you for anything, and i suspect it might not be Bethesda devs implementing this, but instead the bosses and higher ups who has no idea how a game works.  
---
Using the "they need to make money" argument might be cheap, i agree. They might very well have profited enough. I'd prefer the developed fallout 5 or something, because the way they handled fallout 76 was a complete nightmare. Please just sell the Fallout Franchise to Obsidian or something.
---
Sell acid, ammo, cool plans, good legendaries, and Nukashine.
---
Is it really free content then?
---
I can understand what you mean, but what i loved the fallout games for is the depth it used to have. The ability to get into things and find out so much about even a shed in the middle of nowhere, that's not what I'm seeing in FO76 sadly.
---
Ok, thx, looks like it will be waste of time, nothing interesting there...
---
It‚Äôs a superstar issue from the topic of this thread: loot boxes.
---
I expect there to be hundreds of shill accounts praising the F outa the game on various platforms. Its not a conspiracy theory, its logical.
---
Touche

Shill

wat?  why do i feel like you are either trying to use a TS and as a result wiffing most your pellets, or your to far away?  as a rifle build i can use my shotgun to 3 shot mole miners and ghouls.

The plans and costumes will be in high demand after the event ends, if anything you can collect as many unique items and try to sell or barter.

How, I cannot say, but I've got abunch of them if you want a few? And yeah, PC.

I gave up on fallout the moment fallout 1st came out and the outer worlds came out  ( the real fallout devs )
---
I am trying to like this game (had fun) but what bethesda is doing = don't wan't to log in.
---
Oh and its private seasions not private servers.
---
Easy way for bethesda to "fulfill" promise about private servers...
---
No thanks, sounds duped
---
that looks like a shitty photoshop, this game is terrible
---
Only Fireman outfit and Pirate set will be kind of worth collecting, but the rest looks dreadful.
---
You gotta have the game to quit it in the first place.
---
I mean, I'm pretty sure there is some of that sort of stuff in there, I know it's a thing that's always wherever it was I saw it, but I thought it was interesting seeing a line of radrats marching behind an eyebot, or for a split second seeing the Flatwoods monster before it blinked out of existence, which I'm sure is probably a bug. 
---
Liked exploring Uncanny Caverns for the tour and what not, just I don't know. I like exploring, which is what I did the most in Fallout 4, may have avoided all quests for a while cause of it in that game. Can do more of that here, but on a different map, and with other people.
---
You seem to forget there are people genuinely hypnotised by bethesda, they have no stake in the game, but they also have no good framework. People that were born in later generations never got anything of real quality  and now we have a generation of gamers that enjoys broken messes. which is sad. On the other hand we've been gradually conditioned to put up with more and more when newer games came out with more problems, but yeah because we accepted previous issues we are now in pre-alpha game build release and fix later mode.
---
Your comment history is nothing but peddling anecdotal evidence as facts and raging at people who disagree with you and calling them trolls... Sounds like you know exactly what being a narcissist is. 
---
Not to mention your level of activity in the fortnite subreddit makes me feel like you might be one of those "prepubescent teenagers" you seem to hate.
---
Doesn't make it any less true
---
If I didn't I would've gotten alot more flak for this
---
Honestly I‚Äôve always had fun playing fo76. Heaven forbid there are people out there with a differing opinion.
---
Wow, the Obsidian shills dumped a load of downvotes on you for that.
---
See, everybody can play the stupid "no opinion except mine is valid" game.
---
As I've also acknowledged that I was wrong after realising ankther comment I'd made didn't make any sense
---

There‚Äôs pending legislation about loot boxes (which will probably pass). 
---
There‚Äôs not legislation about charging for additional game content.

Changing your mind about your business model and choosing to potentially run up against federal legislation are very different things.

You're forgetting we all bought this car.

Nexus mods or ingame mods because it can be a big diffrence.?
---
https://www.fairphone.com/en/
---
Well, its better then the old system where you would just lose it upon logging in.  Now it 'should' prompt you in log in and allow you to go to a different map.  Should being the main word here since it *is* a bethesda game.
---
Or people who just like the game and have no interest in Fallout 1st drama that doesn't affect them in any way?
---
" Why exactly do Bethesda employees think getting a face full of buckshot feels like a warm summer breeze? "    
---
That actually made me laugh. It's a shame shotguns and pistols still are getting the silent treatment.
---
And what fallout 76 update have you paid for?
---
Tho shall only play one game, one game. Playing and enjoying two games is not possible. Gotta love one, and hate one ;)
---
I have nothing against that. what I don't like is shifting the risk and costs onto the customer. "games as a service" is a clever way of saying "I'm gonna release a subpar product and you're the one who's gonna fund it instead of the investor, on vague promises alone"
---
the work they're doing in this game does not justify that model. and I'll be waiting for that link.
---
Yea totally agree, GTA:O is probably one of the worst examples ever and imho the worst thing Rockstar has ever made. It is genuinely crap and the most fun I ever had in that game was randomly driving over other players until they quit.
---
Put the recent threads on this subreddit in the bowl, it's the most toxic thing on Fallout.
---
You will never see non-curated modding in Fallout 76. Modders would be able to utilize assets from the atom shop without charging for them, or emulate premium features like the scrap box or tent at no cost. Or even worse: create features *superior* to premium offerings, eroding their value.  
---
When Bethesda mentions modding they mean something curated like the Creation Club, outsourcing content creation to modders while still preventing the misappropriation of premium assets and features.
---
I usually run Good with Salt, because of this I tend to have an over abundance of cooked food. I can usually get half if not all of my daily robot vendor  ap max from cooked food alone. 53 glowing stakes is alone is easily 530 caps. I'll tend to sell all my excess aid items. As a stealth sniper I dont use as much aid items as the people who actually get hit. This will either allow me to hit the rest of my vendor max caps or get pretty close to it. Might have to sell a few assault rifle drops for that last little bit.
---
I frequently farm nuked zones for materials so I can craft stable flux and mutation serums. Due to the fact that I play late at night I dont normally get any sales on mutation serums for 350 caps.
---
This is okay because I have a 2nd account and my gurlfriend's xbox. So when I have enough mutation serums built up I can transfer them out to the 5 characters on the alt account and then the rest of the 4 characters on my main account. 
---
9 √ó1,400 = 12,600(+1,400 from main) caps a day that I can move around between characters.
---
I'm often lazy and don't have a lot of time so I only really do that like once or twice a week when I'm off work.
---
they're not charging for additional content, though. a "premium pass" hardly qualifies as such. I'd gladly pay for actual private servers.
---
Thank you üôÇ
---
Bruh, this is an age old fps problem. You have OP shotguns and everyone uses only shotguns while the few that dont cry and complain. Or you have a weak bugged out shotgun so everyone ignores them and you dont have to worry about balancing them because only a small majority feels neglected. There is the 3rd option of actually fine tuning and balancing your spread, range, and damage mechanics but Bethesda isnt a company that focuses on gameplay balancing. They've always made big sandbox RPGs so they'll continue to focus on narrative and cosmetics.
---
Sniper build is easy mode in NV (except in Dead Money)
---
Why?
---
This just in, triggered fanboy is triggered
---
Why would i care about that someone gets more in a scenario where someone else getting more doesn't have a negative impact on my gameplay.
---
E.g. the fact that you can store infinite screws, does not make me getting more or less screws. Just like you modding your single player game has no effect on my single player game.
---
You know what pay2win is? When we fight and your advantages reduce my chances of winning. For instance, you can buy a gun or armor that makes it harder for me to kill you.
---
what you call p2w is envy.
---
What isn't by now?
---
I also sale Antibiotics for 20 caps a piece in my personal machine. It doesnt sell often but when it does a single person usually buys over 30 or all of em.
---
That what kills is me both GTA:O and RDR2:O are extremely predatory yet no one bitches about Rockstar or calls them the new EA.
---
&gt; So why can't Bethesda do the same?
---
Rockstar has an insanely large pool of developers, and they're fairly experienced at that. Bethesda has never made a multiplayer game on their own before (ESO was made by a completely different team of developers).
---
Why would someone who doesn't have the game be here?...
---
Fair enough, but why would you go? There's nothing to see but the scenery, which is nice I admit.
---
i hate the sub stuff but don't get way people acct like that sorry to hear and hope you enjoy the other game i think  fallout 67 its stile a nice game but not fore me any more and again sorry to hear the acted like that have a good one ;)
---
they rereleased skyrim 6+ times. Never again fixed any of the bugs after the final version of the original. I can't wait for elder scrolls 6, which might actually be online only and have a subscription service, even though it will be a single player game
---
I'm sorry what because I don't watch YouTube videos on games I enjoy playing I'm an idiom I love 76 am I gonna pay for the subscription no but that's fine cause I don't have to did I pay for the game no it was gifted to me would I buy the game sure it's a time waster just like every other game out there if you don't enjoy the game don't play simple
---
Thanks. 
---
A follow-up question. If I pick up a legendary item from a container, does the client message the server with the full item detail or just the entry id? In other terms, can the client lie about picking up a different legendary object than the server generated?
---
You havent even played the game though so how would you know?
---
Everyone has moved on, only fanboys left.
---
Where is your camp? I used to have one to the west of the Monorail elevator and would get infrequently bumped from that (I think because it's close to a junk heap). My next camp was near R&amp;G station and never got bumped. My current is near Sunnytop Station and has been bumped once. Overall it's very rare for me to get bumped at all unless I've set up an extractor or a deposit of something.
---
Why would we be amazed
---
I'm not really seeing how it's even fun gameplay wise to be honest. You of course do you, there are people that can make watching paint dry fun. But putting aside the Fallout First shit when I played the game it was boring as hell. I understand that's obviously an extremely controversial opinion on this sub so I anticipate downvotes, but I truly and honestly don't get it and that's really saying something from someone who enjoyed No Mans Sky even before the updates when there was *literally* nothing to do.
---
Bethesda took out everything that made Fallout, Fallout such as engaging quest lines and fun little townships and replaced it with literally nothing. Without VATS the games combat system is exposed for how broken and dated it really is. It really just became a junk collection simulator with some griefing and leveling up thrown in. If that's fun for you then great. But as I said I truly don't get it but perhaps I'm not mean too. We like what we like and no one can take that away from us.
---
Private entities do not have the right to intimidate or harass people due to their speech. I don‚Äôt think intimidation or harassment is a right anyone has. In many places in the real world, speech or actions may be legal but societal pressure, including fear of being ostracized and even murder, keep people from using those free speech rights. Free in name only. 
---
And the second part, it‚Äôs hard to comment on supposition. I assumed I‚Äôd be mad about a subscription service when I‚Äôve read about them in the past. When I face it I just don‚Äôt really care. Since we are using metaphors let‚Äôs try bars, pubs whatever you call it. Some you pay at the door and have an open bar. Some you pay at the door, and buy drinks, and food, and parking, and the VIP section is extra.
---
Only one question. WHY?
---
No. You can do all the dailies in a day, I usually do all of them anyways. And you can do scouts multiple times per day. Most i've done was 5 per day. You just need to spawn outside of where the scout areas are. Meaning don't spawn at dolly sods or at the kid cabins
---
&gt; Why would we be amazed
---
Bethesda is notoriously bad at fixing bugs (there are some bugs still in there from the days of Morrowind), and their game engine is a twenty year old behemoth.
---
I think you can complain about the 'high' cost (that will be an objective opinion) but it's amusing that some people clutch their pearls over the fact that they have to pay anything at all. Did they think it would be free?
---
I would not be surprised if weatlenders would be free only for f1st members...
---
Lmao..... its fully possible to play more then one game. I play both Outer Worlds and Fallout76.
---
I bitch about Rockstar all the time, especially online for rdr2 lol. I get griefed there the same way people grief me in fo76. AMPed101 is also the type of player I despise, as an fyi. Griefing people until they quit? You deserve to banned. Leave lower level players, players a fraction of your level, and people just trying to enjoy their game alone, jfc.
---
I would not be surprised if wastelanders would be free only for f1st members
---
my vendor is stocked with all this. the problem is no one ever comes to my camp. i think all i ever sold for in total is about 100 caps
---
private entities have the right to fire employees for whatever reason. they can even avoid a lawsuit by using a generic excuse for doing so, when in truth they simply disagree with their employee. this happens everyday across America.
---
so yes, you're free to do whatever with your money. but expect backlash.
---
and a better comparison would be gachas that charge people thousands of dollars for the **chance** of rolling a particular avatar. or, in this case, legendary. or mobile "games" that charge you for doing  basic actions, so fast traveling. or even repairing or ammo consumption. would you be OK with buying a fast travel pass for 10 bucks? valid for 10 travels only. or an if they rose the repair kit price to 3 bucks each and removed workbench repairs from the game?
---
Location location location
---
Pretty sad they didnt do a camp area check first prior to throwing you into the game...
---
This guy....
---
In my experience I've been able to do all of the dailies you list as being on a rotation every day. I do have to add that to get them to start often requires server hoping but I still manage to get them all to start. The one exception to this is the queen of the hunt daily. That one seems to still be a bit buggy. I've only managed to get it to start maybe 3 times since they fixed the mire dailies. Personally I wish they'd add all those dailies to the personal terminal so we can just start them there instead of having to travel to every region to see if they'll start
---
2000 atoms, lol. 
---
The 12 festive emotes last year cost 2400 atoms. So additional camp decorations and an artisan fine crafted snow texture would probably add up to 5000 atoms.
---
Yes your junk can stay in there &amp; you can remove it, but you can't add to it
---
As if you fucking stickied this post lmfao.
---
WE ARE DEFINITELY NOT SHILLS, THEREFORE I WILL STICKY THIS POST ABOUT THE GAME BEING GOOD AT THE TOP OF A "THE GAME IS BAD" THREAD.
---
I don't say it isn't. But it always felt the most realistic when playing it as a first person shooter. I tried to go for other builds but I always ended up wanting that gun runners' .50 Cal.
---
I think it's kinda like the sneaky archer build in Skyrim.
---
Ok thank you for the infoüòÅüëç
---
Boonytrapped landmine snow. I accept the challenge
---
In your mind that's what P2W is.
---
To the rest of us, the definition is, for the forth time, is as simple as Real money -&gt; In-game benefits.
---
How is a game fun that is deliberately and intentionally putting stones in your way and asks you to pay in order to remove those stones?
---
How is a game fun that was advertised exclusively with lies? (16 times the details, four times the size, only cosmetic MTX)
---
How is a game fun that is a technical wreck?
---
How is a game  fun when there hasn't been new, worth mentioning content in months?
---
You are encouraging bethesda to continue as they currently do: Lying and ripping people off. This has to stop. Honestly, you can't blame people for calling you stupid while you're still supporting this kind of business.
---
Theres fun part and the buggy part of this game. Concept of game play is there. Just hate how bugs are not solve in time and yet money earning mechanism are launched faster than christmas.
---
I have my happy hours and mad moments with this game seriously.
---
Around 5% of the players are really mood spoilers. Thats why a private server is best for family time together
---
Yup, you just waste pointless time trying to find someone just because they've got something you don't like, its just childish, pal but you do you if it makes you feel better and believe it's made an impact
---
Spoiler: it doesn't 
---
Downvote me if ya want idc
---
It‚Äôs funny because there‚Äôs always people like you who will blatantly support corporate greed no matter what. Have fun with your apathy, go spend another 100 hours grinding whitesprings and please never voice your garbage opinion again.
---
&gt;I won't argue against you.
---
I'll just use my mod powers to sticky my opinion.
---
People hate because of ignorance, 
---
You only have 2 choices in this
---
1. Quit &amp; get over it
---
2. Keep playing &amp; get over it.
---
No matter what you do - you still have to get over it.
---
Yea, SP DLC is p2w.
---
They never said a thing regarding this.
---
I am thinking since we paid for private servers, if we can mod them by whatever means, it has to be free.
---
Click on Photo Gallery in the menu screen.
---
Who cares, its not a multiplayer game.
---
its right next to the harpers ferry
---
There is more to it than that. Don't want to spoil it for you, but there is more. Has to do with the holotape in the room and other locations that tie it all together.
---
You would have know if you'd just google it.
---
If you want live content they need a live income stream.  A purely cosmetic shop ain't gonna cover the server and dev costs.
---
But I think it's way overpriced for what it delivers, not helped by the lack of shorter time span pricing (I'd probably do the occasional 10 for a month of 1st).  100 is a lot to swallow and commit to a single game.  You could get one of the many game library subs for that.
---
me:
---
-the atoms are worth the price and i don't have to be crouching in a workshop anymore bc of the fear of someone killing me and stealing all my junk for the 7th time
---
how much is that? hell yeah i would pay 12bucks to avoid these fkers in this game and  more
---
u don't like it? ok cry louder or you could have been not a griefer
---
and those are my reasons and i don't need ur approval, go cry in every forum until they give you a scrapbox for free i don't care, kisses! no one of you pay my salary hahah
---
Cap stash runs give me around 4 to 5k + 1400 from the vendors.
---
The old "*Not everybody is agreeing with me / complaining, so they are shills*" bullshit again I see.
---
Yeah same, I always end with a long range build but lately I've been doing melee and explosives build and they are really fun (and OP as heck if done right)
---
I agree. It's going to be rented mods on a rented server, bought from the Atom Store.
---
Shotguns are amazing, only use 3 level 1 shot gun damage perks and my vampires explosive is excellent. 
---
Disclaimer I do run adrenal reaction and am bloodied, also enforcer to cripple tougher enemies. But still shotguns are fine. 
---
Best thing about them is that each pellet counts as a hit, so vampires is very good on then, also using rank 1 of four leaf clover you have 8 chances to get a critical each time you shoot. So you can just keep critting for massive damage and accuracy. Eagle eyes is another must mutation as it gives higher crit damage.
---
Here we go again. Why care in a multiplayer game, if someone else's advantages don't intervene in your goals, just like in single player.
---
I guess we can agree to disagree about the speech. I feel like my comparison is perfectly fine. Would I agree or disagree with those things. I don‚Äôt know. Like I said I thought I‚Äôd disagree about paying more for 76. But yes I would probably dislike worst case scenarios. On the other hand your exaggerating. 10 travels for 10 bucks?  That‚Äôs kind of ridiculous to compare.
---
So? Cry more lol nobody will force you to get them if they ever appear in the game
---
Looks like some people do believe youtube, it's a form of entertainment &amp; that's all, unfortunately hate gets more views.
---
And by the by about the free speech. You not how companies have to hide their behavior to avoid a lawsuit. A prime example of how harassment and intimidation are wrong and even illegal.
---
I sincerely hope you realize the things you're saying are completely wrong and you're having a mickey at my expense.
---
no, it's not ignorance. we've been over this multiple times already. it's because your actions indirectly affect other people.
---
and no, those are not the only 2 choices. people can also organize and rally in hopes of changing things.
---
What really blows my mind is that an actual real life group of people came together and agreed that this was a good idea.  Like.... How.  Has Bethesda tried to justify it yet?
---
If you're looking for the files, try C Drive/User/Your Name/Documents/My Games/Fallout76
---
And then boom
---
Haven't played FO76 for over 2 months. It's not getting better because the reason it was bad (for me) was lack of engaging content. The bugs and performance I could love with because every game seems to be broken these days, but if a game can't engage me, I move on. First is a trashy thing to do to the game, and that's why I'll probably never come back.
---

I‚Äôll work on finding a better link
---
And I disagree with it being a subpar product. I‚Äôve played for 600+ hours and had a lot of fun.
---
 The event area is the nuke zone they're not going to change it. Hotkey a rad suit you can usually get it on before you die.
---
I am thinking about limitations about what I can change using ingame mods and outside ones. 
---
And what about joining normal seasion with modded items (and similiar). 
---
Bethesda gonna have headache with this one.
---
Oof, that sucks man idk then. Something sleazy you can do is stick a bunch of extra guns and armor in the vendor to make it look more tempting. You can get away with it being close to the purveyor but you might find extra piles of spoiled meat laying around.
---
You're playing Fallout 76, what do you expect? That it works properly? xD
---
He is just a rage rider getting views from beeing negative and fueling flames.
---
I don't think its Bethesda PR, it's just sad people.
---
You don‚Äôt care that us gamers are getting fucked over? They said in game features will never be behind a paywall and they lied.
---
Works for everyone.
---
Yea these long winded "imsoverysmart" responses aren't helping their case either.
---
Exactly. "The narrative doesn't go my way so it must be manipulated". Hell, it's just another sign that gamers care more about what other play than what they themselves play...
---
pssst wants some caps mines? xd
---
Lets just agree to disagree as I have a private world to farm.
---
Thanks for the debate.
---
Squirrels have a realworld natural immunity to shotguns... I was under the impression this was common knowledge, no?
---
I will tell you why.
---
At this point Bethesda knows that supporters will eat any kind of garbage they drop.

And these are but a fraction of the hateful posts under everyone's eyes in the past few days. I hope you understand it was not possible for me to prove that exactly half of the sub is hating, but I also hope you understand rhetoric figures.
---
You see, that is one of the reasons some of the people are upset. Fallout 1st doesn't really help the game at all. This is why:
---
1. People who already spent $10-15 will just get more for less. This means less money for Bethesda in the long term.
---
2. People who don't want to spend more money in a broken game will be pushed away. So if they are not playing the game, there will be no chance of them purchasing stuff from the Atomic shop. This also means less money for Bethesda.
---
3. Since DLCs are supposed to be free (this can still change), many people will just come back to the game when there are some cool events or new DLCs, without paying anything. Again, less or no money for Bethesda.
---
So I just can't understand why Bethesda are doing this. People are saying "they are just greedy" but even if they were, this is really not the way to make more money. Dividing the player base and implementing mechanics from mobile games is going to ruin this game, not make it more profitable.
---
I got high hopes for the Fallout 4 New Vegas remake actually and I might just start my first real close combat build. Without sneak. Just up close and personal. Thanks for the inspiration.
---
Go check out black mountain ordinance
---
i dont need any of those unless you have a very good weapon in a reasonable price ain't not give u any penny  xd
---
You could always shoot everything, then it's 100 percent shooting guns
---
I just thought of a funny slogan. ‚ÄúFree speech: Say What You Like, Unless it‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt.‚Äù
---
I'd suggest not to do it now. With the high chance of it being a bug,i wouldn't be surprised if you get stuck with only the first one .
---
It's not a form of entertainment, it's a platform that hosts content. I don't need to try something to see what it's like if it's super well documented from a variety of independent sources.
---
I can form an opinion on anthem for instance by learning about its gameplay and technical performance without actually playing the damn thing.
---
The base game isn't bad. However, at this point I find no reason to play unless I was incredibly bored or there was new major content. 
---
Unfortunately, the game was not setup to have a continuous flow of fleshed out content which made a subscription model a strange offer to begin with.
---
There‚Äôs more that pvp than you would think. They are valuable. If you have the right piece you could get whatever you wanted from my experience

No I‚Äôm my camp is right next to summervail

So, if we assume tbat there are shills in this subreddit, then we have to assume they are on both sides. Not only pro-Bethesda shills but also anti-Bethesda shills. You can't cherry-pick. And given how the Outer Worlds get forced into any discussion here, we can safely assume who are the anti-Bethesda shills working for...

you can't disagree with facts and logic but ok. whatever makes you sleep at night.

Just try Fo4 melee is the most broken thing ever, once you get the right perks you one hit everything using the VATS teleport
---
True, but its not a truly informed view until you have tried it yourself
---
Gotcha, subbed!
---
We need a new map
---
Yes they have servers through AWS..
---
New weapons, armour and areas should be updated with each patch like ESO. They have a smaller team, obviously because the makers of ESO own them, but hopefully the subs pay for the new content now, and for the team to grow. I subscribed for more content, let's hope the money gets spent in the best way possible to build F76. The game has so much potential! F76 is kind of like Forest Gump before he could run

Sorry but you're just a hater. Reported for advertising The Outer Worlds-

&gt;I guess we can agree to disagree about the speech.

there's nothing to disagree. google american free speech laws. people are routinely canned, expelled, chastised, etc. for saying what they think. I don't know what world you live in but it's definitely not north america. and it's even worse in europe.
---
&gt;That‚Äôs kind of ridiculous to compare.
---
not at all. that's how mobile games operate in case you're not familiar with them, either. and considering Bethesda keeps pushing and pushing, I don't think it's so absurd to think one day that's going to be the reality of Fo76.
---
But those corporate suits that never played a video game in their lives are saying that "surprise mechanics" are fun. So it must be true.
---
We already talking about this, and you agreed there's a social factor SP games don't have.
---
LMAO
---
Reported for hating the game and advertising The Outer Worlds.
---
Nope.  Wrong again.  Get help please.
---
Can I ask you about junk items - fluxes and bug parts (for pioneer scout dailies) to be precise? Can you also store them in the scrap boxes or you just keep them in the junk section of your stash and in scrap boxes only non-bulked scraps?
---
shotguns will work fine at any level if used within their capabilitys. still run with a combat shotgun (hardened and perforating), for close support. Dont ask it do do squat to a s/beast in the air, but if it lands, its a goner.
---
147 damage with 30% on shotguns but my emphasis is rifles.
---
Maybe he‚Äôs angry because companies are trying to fuck us over again and again by trying out new monetization bullshit and lying to us? Has that ever occurred yo you? How much do you know about these things? Obviously not much because otherwise you‚Äôd be angry too. Stop spouting ignorance.
---
we might for never know for certain really. I would like the idea on Freddy being a companion allowing higher barter or lesser caps to get the Grafton steel workshop. Vault 76 is most likely (as Vault 51 doesn't mention Freddy wood) so that's what we know for now at least
---
I bet we get a shit load of golf outfits
---
you're right, unfortunately...
---
fun is not the same as quality. you can have fun with a subpar product. I know I have.
---
and thanks for the link. did not know that. guess even I held Bethesda in too high regards. they've been planning this since the beginning, what a shame.
---
That‚Äôs what a synth would say!
---
But your name is ESO taz 
---
‚ÄúElder scrolls online Taz‚Äù
---
Yeah, but realize to some this is more than a game. It's like a world they like to immerse in for over two decades.
---
I really don't know anymore.
---
Sure u &amp; other mods r independent but since 1st I think the suits at Zeni/Beth would sell their granny &amp; anything is possible. Fake accounts, followers, likes r a thing and I do believe Zeni/Beth is shameless enough to pull a stunt like spreading fake positive stories &amp; manipulate their audience.
---
I think there is even more dishonesty going on:
---
The fridge wasn't purely a community idea. If u put spoilage in ur game u think about counter measures especially when u get paid for having ideas.
---
Same for canned food, I had the same idea months ago, that's why this account exists, to give feedback &amp; share ideas but Reddit didn't work in my browser at the time so there was no post. And I bet 100 other people had the idea as well.
---
Maybe the CMs didn't know but the devs had those ideas when they created the game. Now this stuff gets disguised as implementations based on community feedback just to give the community a good feeling &amp; to justify the "u asked for this" &amp; to shine because "we did listen".
---
I pray things r getting better but hope is fading. I love this franchise, this game, the world, the art design &amp; the community, I want FO76 to be a place we all can enjoy. I only leave the house to buy food, I played almost 3k hrs, Appalachia became my home &amp; Zeni/Beth is nuking it &amp; it makes me incredibly sad.
---
I've seen packs of three even bofre the clean up
---
Not exactly, but I agree re: alpha game at launch.  Its barely now where it should have been at launch.
---
LOL, yeah id like a map extension with a higher level areas, also maybe community events that change the map, like launch 200 thousand nukes in the Cranberry Bog then it turns into something like the glowing sea for a couple of months, or if we get snow near Christmas and a quest to hunt and kill a Yeti
---
Look. This is all I have on this whole subject in its entirety. So Bethesda added in a sub. Got it. Games offer that. It‚Äôs not a new feature. 
---
Everybody says Bethesda should be handing out all these features for free.  We bought the game. I get that too. 
---
This is the stark reality. Once again they pushed out a game that is buggy. The survival game genre stopped being cool and nobody was happy with the mmo-like style of the game.  Bethesda isn‚Äôt purposely screwing up hand over fist. What company fails so hard on purpose
---
Now their one hope is to survive long enough to get the wastelander dlc live but they have one blaring problem
---
The atom shop sucks. It‚Äôs so overly priced and so under-worthed that they can‚Äôt afford to keep everything floating with the revenue that‚Äôs coming in
---
So they offer a sub for those who will buy it. It doesn‚Äôt hurt the world at large.  Buying the sub doesn‚Äôt change the nature of gaming or force anybody to do anything they don‚Äôt want. 
---
Everybody who‚Äôs howling at the moon are people that either don‚Äôt even play the game, trolls who‚Äôre LOVING turning this community that dared love a game that the internet declared to be trash against itself , or people who were loving the game but feel slighted because they somehow came to believe that ANY developer is actually making games out of their deep love and devotion to making people happy. 
---
Game companies turn a profit. That‚Äôs the company side. Nobody has to buy it. And GOD forbid that some of us are so sick of the hordes floating out of the shadows to cry and moan every time Bethesda does anything that isn‚Äôt handing out free stuff to the masses or (ultimately what most of the trolls are begging for) just fold up and kill it in its tracks so we can wait 10 more years for the next fallout game. 
---
Over and over I keep seeing people march out the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt play this game, don‚Äôt own this game, I played this game at launch and it sucks ‚Äî only an idiot would play this garbage‚Äî anybody who subscribes to 1st is just telling game companies this is okay‚Äî it‚Äôs morally wrong blah blah blah‚Äù
---
Here‚Äôs the truth. If those who buy the sub are that much a minority then the free market kills this game and the consumer has answered with their wallets. 
---
If it doesn‚Äôt fail then it turned a profit and all this amped up hate hype is this offended society crying for its pacifier and a diaper change again.
---
You couldn't get out of the docs house in NV on release. It would just crash. That's if you were very lucky and got through the character creator and the broken speech options with him.
---
That's the first 10 minutes of the game.
---
Hence I found the "*76 is buggy and FNV IS the best game ever*" to be really stupid. You get downvoted for mentioning broken quests in NV.
---
Skyrim I've not played much tbh but I didn't really have many problems from memory. Although I remember I was mostly making hundreds of daggers for some reason.
---
Just looking for things to do. Itching for new content. Hope the Mischief event that starts today scratches that itch.
---
10 mins, you're lucky, it's a 30 mins wait, unless it's prime time for me. Then the waiting lobby is just standing bored, bored people, who've even given up punching each other. Bring on team deathmatch with instant matchmaking
---
&gt;There‚Äôs no discussion to be had
---
Like you were trying to contribute anything but toxicity.
---
r/fo76filthycasuals is the best place for hate free 76 fun.
---
Lol, Well I sure hope they find some magic legs.
---
Stop beeing hysterical, lol!
---
a map extension yes, a new map would be wasteful in my opinion! its only been a year and its so huge!
---
There is nothing wrong with trying the new content and remembering why you left in the first place. I am also fairly confident there will be a ton of bugs and performance issues, so I am waiting for those funny videos and comments.
---
If you place your CAMP bench on the ground at your feet, four stories.
---
Bla bla bla, played the game since launch. You self-important dumbs dumbs are not the people that ‚Äúmake the game great‚Äù. You‚Äôre the sheeple rewarding bad business practices, and dumping your money on a broken unfinished mess. You are literally the reason they get away with, and keep doing stuff like this. Stop trying to justify this bullshit by tugging at the heart strings of the ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù. It‚Äôs not a matter of whether you can still enjoy the game or not. It‚Äôs a matter of principles, and convictions. If you still defend this game you probably have none. They straight up LIED about the accessibility of new features as WELL as their functionality (those are not dedicated private servers), not only that, it‚Äôs features most games put out for free. 
---
iT‚ÄôS nOt ReaLly PaY tO wIn

oh yeah, I‚Äôm sure having an unlimited supply of crafting materials in crafting centric game isn‚Äôt advantageous at all. Neither is the secondary free fast travel spot.  You fucking morons, if it wasn‚Äôt an advantage what‚Äôs the price tag for? The atoms? The cosmetics? If it was just the cosmetics most people wouldnt buy it. Pull your head out of your ass, you‚Äôve been duped into paying an overpriced subscription service for a game that‚Äôs almost a year old, and is still dragging along the same set of problems since launch.  A service most other games put out for free.
---
bUt wAsTeLaNdeRs. It‚Äôs cute how you still have faith in that. The rest of us are playing one of the many triple A, well developed titles that come out this fall/winter.
---
So you are in to extremly bugged release, keeping a lot these bugs in which some are unplayable, not delivering what was promised, lying about features that doesn't exist, not caring about community at all and charging for things players was asking since launch, and releasing it with bugs aswell ?
---
Go to EA if you want more fun.

I can agree with the loneliness, havnt bought fallout 1st but joined a person who did in their world. I think it's too lonely, eerily so in fact, at least other fallout titles had npc's to talk to, fo76 everyone is dead. Yeah I know if and when wastelanders drops this will change but at present it feels strange af being almost the only person wandering an empty map, think I'm too used to multiplayer fallout now lol
---
Spot the anti-vax mom.
---
The game has problems because it has been released incomplete. Because hey, who needs to release a complete game when you don't have to and you can just patch it later, right? Also Bethesda has very clearly said that all things you'll be able to buy with real money will be only cosmetic and they backed down on that and lied to us. And now they delayed Wastelanders only to give us a shitty subscription model? I a fucking full priced game?!
---
You sure showed those strawmen who's boss.
---
There are several YouTube videos that walk through this process, that‚Äôs how I learned this many months ago. It involves only a foundation, the ‚Äúdual staircase‚Äù stairs and the tall post in the stairs tab. Oh, and at first, a good deal of patience.
---
Cool
---
You can straight up buy money with shark cards in GTAO. Imagine buying caps in this game.
---
That's how GTAO manages to keep drip feeding cars and new businesses years after release.
---
I'd rather they didn't do that.
---
They're trying to build up a solid revenue stream on the books for a possible IPO.
---
I think a lot of the trash talking is made by people who‚Äôve never even played the game.
---
Or just... power armor!
---
The only moron here is you.
---
Yep!  Created it when ESO came out, when I was new to reddit.  If you could interview my friends IRL, they would confirm I am a one game person who plays the hell out of it for years, and don‚Äôt game hop.  I tell them I am not a ‚Äúreal gamer‚Äù.  
---
I played ESO for years, now playing fallout.
---
Y‚Äôall are dipshits.
---
You can hide behind a free *placeable* immortal wall during PvP without the tent? how so? And just an FYI a tree is different than a 5 sided immortal cube.
---
Never fixed the bug AND put a pay mod shop inside that pays shit to modder.
---
Fuck Bethesda.
---
Modding is a thing in Fallout series since FO3, fans love it and it gives the game a long life, if you think about it, it does make sense.
---
Because he like game. It‚Äôs as simple as as that.
---
Yup, the game has become more of chore than a fun activity. I probably spent more time searching through my menu, trying to deal with the artificial limitations and repairing my CAMP, than questing and doing events.
---
Everyone makes 20 accounts each
---
You are a good fit to be a moderator ;-) 
---
I think the main difference was that for Fallout 4, il you didn't like it, you could sell it back, and that was that. 
---
Here you can't really sell it back since it's an online game, and the difference isn't but on quality, it's on the blatant lies in the communication. I've been one of those saying the repair kit and the xp bonus for Unstoppables costume were small tests, and now we can see they are truly going to a pay2win direction.
---
I don't know if you decided to let people create a dozen thread of complaints to show the amplitude of it, I would probably have created a main thread with the implied risks of losing focus and having to read dozens and dozens of pages; but I would also do that with "basic happy threads", like "omg the mountains are so beautiful" and other "I've been playing for a whole 3 hours and this is the better gaem ever".
---
You have a weird definition of 'spot on' considering *all* of Nostradamus' quatrains were fortune cookieese.
---
You only have 2 options here
---
2. Keep playing &amp; get over it
---
No matter what, you have to get over it sometime
---
When Wastelanders drops I'll buy a month. It'll be nice to play the new content on a stable server.
---
You can thank shit posts like yours for swaying my decision. The more you hate it the more I want it.
---
What are you my mom? Who're you to tell anyone what they can or can't drop their money on?
---
&gt;You shouldn't have to spend money to play a game in my opinion.
---
I'm sure you meant you shouldn't have to spend money on a game that you've already paid for. ;)
---
Nah many just feel really bad for the people being ripped off and for many others once they see the same stunts being pulled in future titles. Betheada has really fallen to a low I hadn't thought possible.
---
Your friends all work in marketing or PR I bet. 
---
I‚Äôm watching you closely -.- Mr ‚ÄúElder Scrolls Online Team Australia/Zimbabwe‚Äù
---
If you don't like it then why are you here bitching?
---
Maybe I explained myself poorly. I i‚Äôm pretty sure I said or meant to say it was wrong to harass and intimidate people because of their speech. Looking for what‚Äôs legal is no way to find what‚Äôs right. I‚Äôm also pretty sure that unless it is on your companies time or you are speaking about your company you have little to fear from legal repercussions. This is why for example police officers can be involved in politics but not while wearing their uniform. Many times when we hear people being punished by their jobs due to speech, the person either references their company, does it on company time or on company attire, or there is some contractual good behavior clause. If you want to look it up cool lemme know. 
---
As far as exaggerating. Imagine fallout 1st was a dollar a year. Would you get it? What percent that don‚Äôt have it now do you think would then?  I‚Äôm sure some would stick to their guns but not most. A small and vocal minority maybe.
---
I'd be very happy with the Capitol Wasteland. They already have the layout and it's very close to Appalachia.
---
That would be cool! Like how COD maps change after a Moab. We do need more veteran areas. But not like the mire, more open areas with better lighting. We need more world bosses that don't require lots of tasks while fighting them. Would be nice to have a Glowing Behemoth event, where the Behemoth kept spawning lots of bloodbugs and scorpions in waves, and it's health is untouchable untill the waves are dead
---
Well if we are considering previous fallout games to be of quality I consider 76 in the same boat. I never held them to the same level as something like ‚ÄúThe Last of Us‚Äù, but I‚Äôve always found them entertaining, filled with interesting lore, and great detailed worlds to explore. The map design and environmental story telling are absolutely if a high quality. It‚Äôs hard to argue they aren‚Äôt.
---
People keep repeating the 'code from oblivion' stuff again lately. Second time I've seen it in 2 posts in a row.
---
What exactly is in there from oblivion and how has it not changed?
---
If you're referring to the stuff the devs said prior to release then they actually said they took out code from Morrowind. That's how they managed to build in more detail and have it cope with multiplayer - taking out redundant and unnecessary old code.
---
One of the top rated posts today literally has the words ‚Äúim sick of people harrassing the players that have made the game great‚Äù
---
And I literally just glossed over the most repeated talking points but sure.  You keep telling yourself paying a 100$+ yearly subscription for a year old broken game is just fine.
---
It certainly looks that way.
---
As someone who used to play the game everyday. I agree with everything you said. This is the real reason content was pushed back and its sad because i know people who only played to sell stuff and trade at that point. There's nothing to do and this was the final slap.  The people who pay for this and defend it need help.
---
Well said.
---
Agree they should have waited.  Amateur hour PR
---
Thanks pal \^\^
---
Proof or nothing. Anyone can make posts like this
---
If these people who are griefing you are still supporting the game by playing it, how are they any ‚Äùbetter‚Äù?
---
I wouldn't be too excited. Hope you have fun though.
---
What side are you fighting for not that it really matters cause I'm a low level and cant really help lol
---
Anyone who posted this is clearly a child. Believe it or not.... many adults play this game (it is rated M after all and 18+). 
---
No my elderly mother didn‚Äôt pay for it. She doesn‚Äôt even know what an Xbox is.
---
We need a new game.
---
No but it‚Äô pretty obvious your mom pays for your games, AND your fallout first subscription loser ‚úåüèº but hey, I bet if you suck your step dad‚Äôs dick with extra special care he‚Äôll buy you Outer Worlds. 
---
You go on ahead, and give your money to a company that doesn‚Äôt respect you. I‚Äôd say don‚Äôt complain when the games only get worse but we all know you won‚Äôt.
---
‚ÄúMaybe if we ignore it long enough it will just go away‚Äù...
---
Want to talk about ignorant? Not that I have to explain myself to you but ok. I'm a carer. 23 dollars in 1/5 of my monthly entertainment budget. By entertainment budget I mean 100 dollars I get to spend on whatever I want. Whether it's games/movies/food/scratching my ass. Everything else goes towards taking care of my mother. So yes, I don't give a rats ass what it converts to in USD when all of my monthly expenditures are in aus.
---
Ignorant? You made an ignorant judgement about someone without even considering that persons situation. So you, like bethesda, can fuck right off.
---
Bethesda can't even fix the ones we currently have. I don't see the point of adding new content if the content we currently have doesn't work.
---
Oh. Yes. Sorry for bad choice of words. But yes. Thanks for pointing that out ^-^
---
Do you have any proof of what you said is true
---
I say that because you‚Äôd have to be a complete, and utter imbecile to fork over your hard earned money for a subcription service to a game that‚Äôs a year old. For features that most games put out for free. But hey, more power to you.
---
&gt;Looking for what‚Äôs legal is no way to find what‚Äôs right.
---
perhaps, but the original comparison was that you're free to spend your money however your want but should also be ready to face repercussion and it holds true. you can't freely speak your mind in modern society, there will always be some sort of repercussion. this is a fact.
---
&gt;If you want to look it up cool lemme know.
---
there's no need. I'm assuming you don't keep you with twitter drama? all the countless people who got fired because they dared to challenge the status quo? it affects the comics and gaming industry the most. I'm honestly surprised you're being so resistant to such a common thing. it literally happens every day. you can find dozens of new articles about students who expelled for speaking up, for example.
---
&gt;As far as exaggerating. Imagine fallout 1st was a dollar a year.
---
and that would be a valid comparison if it wasn't for the fact Bethesda will keep pushing for more monetization, not less. if anything they're going to increase the price of the 1st pass, not decrease it.
---
so yeah, charging people 1 dollar per fast travel in the near future doesn't seem that absurd. it's the mobile model after all, everyone is doing it. so what's stopping them?
---
Bruh call a mechanic. Your sarcasm detector is on the fritz. Get it fixed the re-read my comment.

---
Do us all a favour &amp; go do it somewhere else
---
1) nuclear winter hasn‚Äôt been out yet. 
---
2) if you are still waiting after 10 minutes you should exit and try again. There is no reason it should ever take that long.
---
So you‚Äôre a contrarian cunt with no real agency or critical thought. Coolio üëåüèº you enjoy paying for garbage.
---
Alright. Talking to you is a waste of time. Some of us remember when developers had to put out full games at release because there was no option to patch them. And times where there were no mocrotransactions and game design didn‚Äôt have to suffer because of them.
---
Imagine being so butthurt over a video game that anytime someone has a positive opinion of the game, you think they are being paid to say they like the game.
---
You realise I can still have played the game without paying for it?
---
Do you play the game?
---
This made me think of the vaults. But then I searched this sentence and found out it came from FNV.

---
i am not. the VAT comes on top of that. I am complaining that they ignore the exchange rate
---
i get it, exchange rates change all the time, but not that drastic
---
They just need to break free lol I'd love it it the Bethesda master company took the game into rework, or at least helped. Technically if it went free to play, maybe they could get some free to play devs to volunteer and polish it and clean up some bugs, with an endgoal of being employed there once it picks up again. Because there's some very good coder's not making a penny, at least advertising for volunteers would improve the game, and add to coder's CV's too
---
Since launch
---
Why do you play a game you don‚Äôt like?
---
At 9 1/2 feet you can take a ghouls legs off and leave it flailing on the group, at 10 feet the ghouls are looking around trying to work out where the noise is coming from.  
---
Sound pretty fine tuned to me.
---
getting disconnected constantly, having your items vanish for no reason whatsoever, poor performance in general and constant hiccups. I find hard to call a product riddled with bugs a quality one. they just released a pass that gives users infinite storage, except that storage was deleting all of your junk. that's nothing short of a joke. I could literally fix several of the bugs that linger since the beta in the CK in under a minute. no, I do not think it's a quality product.
---
It's an online multiplayer game with dedicated servers. Servers, I might add, which cost money to keep up and maintain.
---
There is a bug that is especially common with Explosive shotguns and Tesla rifles where the game will think youre hacking or something due to the many enemies you kill with one shot or something. Anyway! It will cause you to be unable to deal damage at all. Only thing to do is either do damage via melee or swap server.
---
Thank you.
---
It's only a problem to the people who have a problem with it. I'm not losing any sleep over it. Far worse monetization plans exist out there.
---
I haven‚Äôt been disconnected in months and never had an item vanish. I can only speak for my experience but I haven‚Äôt had issues in months. Launch was rough but it has improved.
---
Because I used to like it, and still like the franchise. Because I was holding out for it to get better. But these latest developments show where Bethesda‚Äôs priorities lie, and most of the bugs people say are ‚Äúfixed‚Äù, aren‚Äôt.   Did it ever cross your mind that some of the hate isn‚Äôt coming from trolls, but from actual disappointed fans? No, probably not.
---
Sadly they can't hear, see, or speak the truth. They love lies and greed, and they willingly pay to defend it.
---
I think people would be upset too, if there the stash was limited in FO4 and you could make it unlimited with a  subscription. It's neither a social thing nor a competitive advantage thing, but people being outraged that malevolent buisness practices. The p2w claim is just an attempt in putting emotions into some sort of rationalized argument.
---
I think the 2nd Shadow of Mordor Game was heavily criticized for bringing "p2w" loot boxes to a single player game.
---
I've played an average of 2:30 hours every day since beta. I saw the patch notes during my last class the day they came. Let's just say that average has been dropping since then.
---
I stay subbed here because I love the game and community and wanna continue to fight for it but I can't spend all my time posting about it here.
---
I never said it was good though
---
Many people say we are, not just in here either, that's my point
---
Ended up getting the cargobot finally lol and I'm not overcumbered anymore

You probably still play blizzard games then too, huh. Some gamers have zero morals, dignity or integrity.

Nope paying for a solo experience free of toxic player like you.

---
People have different opinions &amp; that's üëå
---
You mean content for an unfinished game i paid 60$ one year ago? Seriously, i reached max level in 2 months (as in monster cap level + all needed perks) and all endgame had to offer was repeating 1 boss over and over again. And in all that time i bitched like crazy about the stash limit and they said it coulden't be increased because of server stability. Fast forward 1 year and all they did was admit that infinite scrap doesn't affect server performance and put it behind a paywall together with fast travel tents and a "private server" i like to call "toggle other people option". Seriously 100$ is a bit much for a toggle people switch. They did the bare minimum work after 1 year and none of it justifies the 60$ i initially paid.
---
Nice work sorting the list just found this and greatly appreciate the work of u guys
---
You just added the p2w there. The scandal was around the loot boxes. You weren't getting an advantage over anybody since everything was in the game.
---
Ok, so now we changed subjects. Yes, people are pissed over corporate practices, in an unfinished barebones game.
---
https://redd.it/dnv3oi
---
Enjoy the read.

Thank you, and we let the threads flow because people are pissed, we aren't here to squash opinion or disagree with anyone, we're to keep the peace.
---
If people are angry, then be angry.
---
On a server that‚Äôs not really a dedicated private server. But yeah, paying a hundred dollar subscription just to play by a game you‚Äôve already grinded the shit out of by yourself  is genius. You sure showed me.

So maybe now you can stop sassing me.
---
Not true, I have a Camp with atleast 8 stories
---
Everything I have ever hated about modern gaming is addressed in this post wonderfully.
---
Capitalism is a relentless cancer that kills everything it infects, gaming is the latest casualty.
---
You realise there are many ways for me to have played the game without paying for it? And even if I hadn't played the game, my opinion on the state of monetisation and Bethesdas blatant promise breaking and lies would still be entirely valid?
---
Yes I would love it
---
Bethesda don't give a flying fuck about the game so it's 95 percent going to be a no.
---
Summary of the entire game
---
Leave the forest
---
As if this sub isn‚Äôt currently a toxic wasteland. All I did was point out that dude is so butthurt, which he is. Are you butthurt too? üôÇ
---
I don't think you realize how prevalent paid shills really are in the real world. You'd never know the difference, but they're always there dude. You can deny that fact to the moo  and back but it doesn't change that is just that, a fact.
---
Heh, the code is still there, they've just taken away the menu.
---
3 stars but drops 1 - 2 stars crap most of the time. No point nerfing.... haha
---
That's the state of the entire industry these days
---
Imagine being so jaded you believe a company is wasting it's time running a subreddit when they cant even run a game right smh
---
On reddit someone is sure to reply: yoU tHiNK gAmES ShOulD bE fReE!?

1.  That wasn‚Äôt the original comparison. That‚Äôs not a comparison at all. That was your statement whic I disagreed with. Not a comparison. I know there is a cause and then effect to everything we do including speech. I didn‚Äôt say words have no power. I said it‚Äôs wrong to harass and intimidate people because you don‚Äôt like how they spent their money. 
---
2.  I don‚Äôt keep up with twitter for my news. Neither should you. 
---
3. Students don‚Äôt have the same free speech rights as adults. Even adult college students on campus are subject to a campuses code of conduct, which they agree to. This has been adjudicated in the US Supreme Court and has been law of the land for many years. 
---
4. I‚Äôm not resistant to what your saying. I think what your saying is somewhat right but lacks important nuance. By calling me resistant your attacking the messenger rather than the message. You make it seem like my argument are invalid and that I don‚Äôt even really believe them because really I‚Äôm just stubborn. Deal with the substance of my arguements. 
---
5. I clearly laid how how students and adults can be punished for their speech, in narrow circumstances. Settled law that students don‚Äôt have the same free speech rights. I laid out how and when adults can be punished (talking about their job, at their job, while working, in work uniforms, breaking a contractual clause)
---
6. You didn‚Äôt really deal with the implications of a dollar a year for 1st. You just said it won‚Äôt happen. Your right it won‚Äôt. Neither will a dollar for one FT. It‚Äôs common for people to imply companies can charge whatever. They can‚Äôt. They can only charge a price they think the consumer will pay. If 1st was 100 a month of course not. No one would get it. If it was a dollar a year, would you join?
---
I‚Äôm not going to uninstall a game I enjoy because some people are paying for things I don‚Äôt care about while the things I do care about continue to be free. 
---
Sorry to see you go.
---
Its not a matter of affording for everyone for some its just a cost to value ratio
---
I'm denying the mod team are paid shills, anyone else I don't know, it wouldn't surprise me but I don't know, but the mod team are not.
---
I read that one yesterday and i don't agree. My reasoning, well, you know it already.
---
14$ is moneybags to you? Lol wow, sucks to be you.
---
&gt;On a server that‚Äôs not really a dedicated private server.
---
So far unproven and by the time Wastelanders comes out they will have the invite only set up correctly. Not to mention that sweet sweet scrap box. Oh I'm salvating at the thought of all the freed up stash space. 
---
For $100 hell yeah I'll pay to win the shit out of this game. I can't wait to have my advantage over you 2nd class players.
---
Enjoy public servers I'll enjoy turning my nose up at you for not paying to be gud.
---
Yep Cap stash runs. Also definitely do the 1400 per day vendor runs. I go to Lewisburg wait for Super Mutants to spawn kill all of them and sell weapons same with uranium fever. Both places are great because they are next to stations so you can pick up everything and don't have to worry about weight. Make sure you use Hard Bargain 3 and grape mentats each time. I also scrap from both places if I need steel. Make sure you equip scrapper card when you do that.
---
Everything in the Atom Shop is additional content of some sort. That‚Äôs really what I‚Äôm comparing to the theoretical future ‚Äòloot boxes‚Äô. 
---
There‚Äôs no random element involved.
---
My game is still uninstalled, it‚Äôs staying like that.
---
Well that should massively improve the atmosphere in here.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the PR team in this company had anonymous and fake accounts to praise this game and try to make it look good or paid some ppl and bots do to it for them, they already showed they are scummy enough with the handling of this game.
---
Do they?
---
And if they do, they exist for games that are *finished*.
---
Oh yeah pick up every glowing meat you can find cook it and sell it.
---
Come off it
---
&gt; We like what we like and no one can take that away from us.
---
Exactly. If someone can have fun with what BGS has given us, why are you and others like you trying to shame them for that?
---
And before you just dismiss me as a generic Bethesda hater, I‚Äôve got hundreds of hours in this game. I‚Äôm allowed to criticise it.
---
‚ÄúA fool and his money shall soon be parted‚Äù
---
I deleted it because I accidentally posted it before finishing it.  The fact is most games put out these features for free. The fact is they said they would. The fact is the bugs that have been ‚Äúfixed‚Äù are still present. The fact is you‚Äôre trying to justify to yourself paying 100+ dollars over what you‚Äôve already paid for an unfinished, underdeveloped product.
---
wHeN yOuR oLdEr yOuLl uNdeRStAnD.  I understand just fine, simple minded fools will always reduce things to the terms easiest to understand for them. That‚Äôs why people like you always have to frame things as an endless conflict between the forces of love and hate. Always padded with some bullshit about what the years have taught them. The years have taught *me* people like you who don‚Äôt really say shit are full of it.
---
I disagree. FO4 became very drab after a while. I appreciate the leaves and minimal foliage.
---
I‚Äôve never seen a 20 second respawn atleast can‚Äôt remember it being that long and bind radaway to a hotkey and you‚Äôre good to go even if you spawn in the nuke zone
---
I just like the game
---
Month two's cosmetic will be a Mr. Handy costume so subs can dress up as a overpriced tools. ;)
---
Exactly this, my time is more important than my money and when I saw mechanics constantly changed to push more grind in the hopes of annoying me enough to open my wallet I closed my wallet instead. I would have dumped tons of money into the game if it was halfway honest.
---
Don't feel sorry for us, we have a great health care system.
---
So I don't mind paying extra for things.
---
Yes, one side of the subreddit is being bullied by immature cuckolds. It‚Äôs not like both sides are actively kicking the teeth out of each other. Bravo.
---
You are so fucking dramatic my god
---
So unproven it was featured in Forbes, but sure. 
---
Go ahead, you enjoy being a skill-less boot licker. I bet if you suck your step-dad‚Äôs dick with extra special care he‚Äôll pony up for an extra year‚Äôs subscription.
---
That's funny. I'm waiting for them to start releasing content before I even begin to MAYBE consider subscribing. Right now F1st like crowdfunding potential DLC that may or may not come out and work as intended. Vault 94 really didn't give a good impression in that regard.
---
I gave up early on, kinda glad to seems this game for all its good intentions created a lot of headaches for its loyal players. there are just better games coming out that work smoothly.
---
Alright, thanks! That really helped
---
So I can tally you up as a no?
---
Show me where I shamed anyone. I literally just said I didn't understand why anyone could find it fun, but that's okay you do you. That does not equate to "shaming" anyone.
---
‚ÄúI saw online, that our games had a few bugs‚Äù-Todd Howard
---
I'm sure if loot boxes were introduced into the game they would only contain cosmetic enhancements right? üòâüòâ
---
Obviously the years haven't taught you any manners, as you are a child you have to learn right from wrong &amp; hating someone because they have a different opinion is wrong.
---
No it's not its 8 million
---
‚ÄúAll of us‚Äù
---
Except all the other people who have no problem with it. But as far as you‚Äôre concerned they don‚Äôt get to have an opinion right?
---
Really wish I knew why all the trolls here share the same mental deficiency wherein they think they represent the entire community and no one is allowed to have a different opinion.
---
YOU are why a game community goes to shit. Not the bad decisions of the corporate greed machine. Stop the damn friendly fire. Sniping fellow gamers out of some misplaced rage is idiotic.
---
I'm not saying they should make the game more p2w than it already is. I'm saying why can't Bethesda do a peer to peer system for their private "servers" since they're not able to hold more than 8 people, aren't customizable, and get shut off the second no one with a Fallout First pass is in them?
---
Pinning an official response from the moderator team is a form of argument, though I can tell by this and your future responses that you had the best intentions. This is especially strange though because it seems you meant to respond to any implication of the moderation staff's integrity yet your pinned post doesn't really do so effectively and at the same time ends up being rather dismissive to those who _do_ have concerns. They end up getting bundled into the canvas bag-era trolls who only participated with the intent of concerntrolling and I feel like people end up taking exception with that.
---
People can do what they want with their money. I just lose a lot of respect for anyone who buy into this money grabbing crap.
---
But hey thanks for the good conversation. You gave me something to think about. Hope I did the same. If your on Xbox add categoricshoe47. I‚Äôll invite you to my private server MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
---
I am playing different game. And it is a far better Fallout experience than Fallout 76.
---
They‚Äôre not wrong
---
Huh really i havent heard many say they disliked new vegas since the first month it was out its my favorite the campaign was crap but i loved eveything else 3 was good 4 was pure trash and 76 is better than 4 but its gotta long ways to go to catch 3 or nv
---
I just stop trying. The posts did nothing and I haven‚Äôt played in months now. Once people stop you‚Äôll be left with the people who still play, praising it.
---
I may be wrong but I think the clown outfit has been on since beta you wear for the Halloween seasonal event. Let me see if I can find a link to it.
---
"People complain, but the money keeps coming in, so they must actually LOVE how we do things."
---
Quit back in February but was holding out hope for this new DLC. Soon as they announced the fucking battle pass bullshit I uninstalled.
---
unreal.
---
Natural selection. We removes all the weak ones from their gene pool.
---
Seriously an entire year and this is the best they can do? This event definitely has nothing even worth going for.
---
[You‚Äôre reminding me of someone...](https://pics.me.me/you-know-that-game-is-buggy-right-fallzut-76-it-37827442.png) 
---
Fallout 1st doesn‚Äôt affect me. I haven‚Äôt paid for it. I haven‚Äôt parted with any money. I‚Äôm still having fun with what I have and I‚Äôm looking forward to Wastelanders. I haven‚Äôt been swindled out of anything. I don‚Äôt like the deal for 1st, so I haven‚Äôt bought it. Simple as that. You need to understand that people can still have fun, even with a game you don‚Äôt like.
---
It has been on since beta. Doesn't mean my argument is wrong.
---
There are other countries as the us, shocking  I know! Here we'd have to pay roughly around 133$/year (when you look up how much 120‚Ç¨ is, you can even see it yourself!)
---
I agree. It‚Äôs improbable to teach teenagers to consider other people may have differing opinions and you may be wrong. Shitty parenting saw to that.
---
Keep livin that zealot life like some weird rage terrorist. You do you.
---
OP must be paying people to agree with him! That must be the only way....right?!?!
---
Nice try officer
---
Fighting any Douche Lord who attacks and griefs others purely because they chose to spend their own money on a game.
---
This sub doesn't have to be run by Bethesda for Bethesda to come in and make posts.
---
No one cares.
---
Bye
---
See you back here in a couple days, that other game should be all done by then.
---
Because people who are buying this subscription are supporting the idea that its okay to monetize anything they feel like in a game.
---
I started playing again three weeks or so and I have to say since the update it's even laggier then before, It's awful
---
I kinda agree with this. Everywhere except for the ash heap and the toxic valley is pretty lush. I‚Äôve made the argument before that if this is what it looks like 25 years after the nukes, no way the capital wasteland should be how it was 200 years later in fallout 3. It‚Äôs too close, all that life would migrate. The only explanation is that once again, Appalachia will be rendered unlivable between 76 and F3.
---
Full set of 5 chars, lvl 130 sniper, 60 shotgunner, 80 heavy gunner, 100 melee, 65 commando :-)
---
Way too realistic...
---
You work for Bethesda, right?
---
I did that challenge only once. Then I noticed the irony and stopped doing it.
---
You can also buy it on the Microsoft store and it's coming to Steam in a year.
---
On xbox werd still lacking a proper flintlock mod only mod i want so i have to play 76 to get my fix of killing people with a blackpowder
---
To his defense, it is hard to fathom...
---
I subscribed to 1st - played for 6 hours yesterday for the first time on a public server, sporting my new armor, flashing my new "1st gang sign" emoji's, sitting on the front porch, playing my banjo and ate an ice cream - while all the other "peasants" walked by starving.  Damn, it's good to be "The King".  Another guy came by sportin the same armor, we swapped ice creams - laughed about the other "poor saps" around us, and then went on our merry...  That interaction took about 10 seconds.  I never had a single person approach me in a negative way.  Your taking this too seriously.  Here, here's an ice cream...
---
We bought the game in the first place because of the express belief that there would be zero pay to win elements.
---
Players will go away...
---
‚ÄúPeople have fun with video game‚Äù is hard to fathom?
---
Not really. It has actual replayability and many difficulties. By the time I finish the game entirely, there will probably be a DLC coming up. While Fallout 76 will still be trash.
---
I don't know why you people can't make a post without numbers.  Is this buzzfeed?  Also, we're talking about AAA devs, not mobile or indie.  Yes, you can make an indie game with one person and 20 grand, it's not really comparable to the topic, or any of your examples other than to artificially skew game prices down.  I also am not making excuses for dirtbag tactics like loot boxes or other similar gambling gimmicks.  I'm talking about basic unintrusive microtransactions. Anyway, here's in response to your list:
---
1. Wow, what a douchebag.  Not sure how this pertains to my point that games have been the same price for 30 years and development costs are rising (again, on AAA games, not mobile or indie).  
---
2. No, they are not.  Tell me God of War was cheaper than Final Fantasy VII, or that Mario Odyssey was cheaper than Mario World.  Saying AAA games are cheaper to make now is a ridiculous statement. 
---
3. You will 100% see $70 base games this coming gen. Fallout 4 cost $120 million.  Skyrim cost $92.5 million.  Oblivion cost ~20 million. Costs go up as expectations rise, not down.
---
4. Witcher has DLC my man.
---
5. Yeah, I know what a salary is.  Game coders and model sculptors can make 6 figures, easy.  Skilled work costs more money. Big games take more skilled work.  See where I'm going with this? 
---
I never buy anything from a games microtransaction store.  Why the fuck would I, it's a waste of money... but it doesn't mean I condemn the act of it.  Just because I don't wanna throw my dollars in the trash for a digital green pumpkin mask  doesn't mean someone else isn't willing, and far be it from me to tell them they're wrong.  Microtransactions exist because people are paying, as game dev costs are rising.  Also, all those "live services" and microtransactions keep individual coders and modelers and artists in a job instead of laying people off at the end of a major project (which is standard practice across the industry)
---
So, my point remains the same: you don't want to buy it, so don't.
---
Sorry folks, pack it up, we‚Äôre not allowed to like a game on it‚Äôs own sub anymore.
---
OP probably just learned what alt+f4 does last week.
---
Thanks. I will.
---
Replay the same game but with higher difficulty. How original. Dont forget the trophies!
---
And this guy over here, thanks for your submission!
---
Colour me intrigued. Another poster has suggested going to Black Mountain Ordnance. I'll investigate.
---
Are u level 15 i think is requirment for that
---
No, doing just fine without the subscription.
---
Same. I've been playing nearly every single day since beta, but about 2 weeks ago I just stopped logging in. And that was before fallout first. I'm not boycotting either, but I think I was just a little sick of waiting for wastelanders and doing the same crap over and over. I can finally say that, after a year of grinding and trying to find things to do, I'm officially, and sadly, bored. I mean it actually hurts me to say it, because I really love Fo76. I just feel like they've been making some poor decision which has left the game pretty barren imo.
---
isn't there something like "we will catch you up every week so you guys know what we are doing" in the beggining?
---
i didn't come here for a while so i don't know what happened to that
---
Put on a clown outfit, you clown!
---
like i said i like them all. 
---
3 was my first. i borrowed it from a family member thinking it was a call of duty type of shooter (did not do any research), and boy was i wrong lol. anyhoo i kinda cheated, did not understand any of the mechanics in the game so i was getting my ass handed to me. i watched a youtube walkthrough for the first couple hours and just became obsessed.
---
4 i feel in love with, i have played it through more than any of the others
---
76 currently still playing, love the game, convinced a couple friends to try it, one of which is a teammate of mine now.
---
New Vegas was good regardless I played it about a year after i played 3, i enjoyed like any of the other Fallout's i played but i didn't seem to get the same thrill i got with 3, i dunno i am guessing i am a minority on it.
---
3, 4, 76 and New Vegas.... thats my order
---
Well and you're the one making sure that ES6 will be RIDDLED with MTX because you're currently teqching bethesda it's okay to do it and there are no repercussions for them.
---
This is the worse example...in GTAO in private   lobby you can't run any of your businesses...matter of fact this is the biggest gripe that people who play GTAO have....being forced to grind in public servers with a lobby full of griefers...imagine a FO76 private server where no events spawned and you couldn't do things such as launch a nuke....this would be the equivalent to a GTAO private lobby
---
We get weekly inside the vaults
---
Off to Outer Worlds. Jim Sterling said it was a dead horse that makes squeaky fart noises, so you still get a chuckle every time you kick it. Thats all bethesda is at this point. Todd lied, then self deprecated then didnt take steps to fix it. He can sit and spin.
---
Actually it's a hidden quest but yeah a lot of places had cut content
---
I care. OP is right. To be honest I think more players should react to this bs that BGS did to the f76.
---
I've got 3 complete high level characters, one level 35, and one that I delete and remake once I hit level 20. The top three are solid pvp builds, level 35 was an experiment on how early I can be deadly with PvP (pretty early if you know what you're doing) and the last one is for mucking around in the forest, being an easy kill for noobs in survival mode back when that was around.
---
Agree with you on using the terminal to start them. Because my cop a squatter daily always disappear from my quest log whenever I log off, disconnected or switching server.
---
It‚Äôs still enjoyable but I totally understand you. In the first place we couldn‚Äôt get more inventory because server stability. And now you can buy it. For the price of fallout x 5.
---
üñê
---
&gt;Do you always sell your stuff to one of the robot vendors to gain the 1400 caps? Or do you prefer to sell your items in your own vendor? 
---
Well both actually. If you find the  Marine Tactical helmet plans you can easily craft these for 1 plastic, 1 glass, and 3 rubber. Each Helmet sells for 31 caps.
---
Another good item to sell are Civil war era suits 5 cloth and 1 gold (20 caps) Civil War era dresses 5 cloth 1 Crystal (19 caps)
---
For my Player vending I sell serums for 250c usually a player will buy the whole stack just to resell which is ok with me as they sell super quick from my machine and are easy to craft.
---
Also Legendary items sell well obvioisly pricing varies depending on the roll. TSE despite imo being garbage easily fetch 10K.
---
Plastic for 3 caps each, Acid 3-4 caps each, lead 2-3 caps each. Balistic fiber 10c each, all sell very fast. These are just my prices I like to keep them low I'd rather sell items quickly than waste space.
---
It may be what think about you, but that challenge always includes lvl up w/axe as well. It's more about 'axe wielding clowns' roaming the wasteland which is a popculture horror thing.
---
Pirate costume and that's all anyone needs to know
---
good lord, lose the tinfoil hat bud
---
I make most of my caps from selling stull I loot to the bots.
---
As I roam, I loot everything not nailed down.  
---
When I hit weight limit, go to local bot vendor.  Scrap what I need.  Hard bargain3, pop a grape mentats, then sell everything to the bot vendor
---
Lol duper hunters a group of 5 people back in the day thought i was duping with my level 2 freind i spanked them and they ran away
---
I don't think I'm playing the same Fallout76 game as you because, honestly, it's pretty sweet from my perspective and has been since launch. 
---
Also, I have not purchased the sub.
---
Oh hello Bethesda employee
---
No, No and NO!.. Now sh\*t up. Start protecting Bethesda and give them money like good S\*ave.
---
When i started playing the stash size was only 400. The game is actually better now. Change my mind.
---
Too bad that you are beinh downvoted by bethesda PR team. We should one day purge them all from that subrettit.
---
What's the incentive? A certain type of player will jump down their throat whatever they say.
---
Economics 101: if you're a business and your customers aren't paying the bills, you're not doing it right and will soon be out of business.
---
That's an angle i didn't think of.
---
They all bussy using their alt accounts to downvote outraged people and making a posotive posts.
---
Many textures look like something pulled out from Oblivion. The shadows are also pretty bad. So you can't really put the word "nice" and "graphics" in the same sentence when you are talking about FO76. You are basically talking about the lame filter Bethesda are using to hide what is underneath and the fact that there are a lot of debris and leaves (probably what causes performance drops btw).
---
Well, Nuclear Winter apparently plays after the main game and the reason for the ring of fire, are the residents of vault 76 nuking the living shit out of Appalachia. Not sure about that theory with Wastelanders in the pipe,   
---
even tough there is evidence in vault 51.
---
You don't even know me or if I've been playing this game you crybaby
---
It's a video game. Please. Keep that in mind.
---
does your puchbowl actually work? 
---
I can transfer (beer/nukashine/wine/alcohol) into mine, but after exiting that menu, the items are not visible in the bowl.
---
well that's the thing, the lunchboxes weren't just "found in the code", there was actual footage of them being used in-game. like they're basically ready, and in a recent patch, icons for these lunchboxes were added. they're going to do it, it's just a matter of when.
---
Wow I had no idea. You just confirmed something I made up in my brain lol. I guess that‚Äôs the story you discover in 51. I gotta get on it!
---
I remember playing eso and gettin so annoyed with the fact i had to pay for a sub for that bag i deleted the game wasnt a fan in the first place but that minor irritant was too much i regret never finishing my goal of getting enough money to buy a house
---
Can‚Äôt upvote this enough
---
&gt;	it isn't the end of the world
---
Have you ever heard of how a frog will jump out of boiling water but will sit there if you gradually turn up the heat?
---
Lol rant posts are the only ‚Äúobjective‚Äù posts right ? üòÇ
---
Because it‚Äôs a completely different architecture and would take months of dev team work.
---
This post says a lot about our society.
---
Thank you for coming to this gamer moment.
---
If bethesda does ANYTHING, there's a dedicated group of individuals that will make it their life's mission to shit on it, and blow it so far out of proportion that some will think that Bethesda publically murdered someone.
---
It does the same for me but sometimes if do a few server hops it'll show back up. It's a crap shoot on whether it shows back up or not so I wouldn't suggest that as a way to get it to start again
---
"PaY tO wiN" where? What gives you an edge over everyone else? All i see is quality of live stuff but nothing else.
---
How can you- if you don‚Äôt even- wow
---
Been playing 76 since it first hit full release and gotta disagree with you. Is it unplayable? Absolutely not. I don‚Äôt have a subscription, I‚Äôve been playing since stash size was 400. The games always been playable and it still is.
---
16 times the communication
---
It's here for the community at large to know that aren't alone in seeing some of these bugs, and for Bethesda to use to track / filter out confirmed issues from the "White Noise" of hundreds of other reports of varying quality.  
---
  I'd not call it sad, but smart.
---
I think if we got a look at the financials we'd have an idea why BGS is going the direction they did with F\_1st.  Doesn't bother me one bit since I don't play Fallout games to 'compete' with anyone - just to enjoy the game.  If joe blow has armor I don't, who cares?   Someone's always going to have something you don't.
---
I do, however, think F\_1st is about twice the price it should be.
---
My friend has like 3 actual years on Morrowind...so yeah no need to be ashamed
---
extra credit for the grognak outfit !
---
wtf are you on. If you gonna complain, complain about something that idk actually exists?
---
lulz.
---
I thought the same thing about 3 before i borrowed from a freind he was showing me the game and he sticks a grenade in this ghouls pocket i hear oh crap in that raspy voice and i said im taking this game
---
&gt;ou didn't even know mods were going to be in the game 5 minutes ago.
---
And when you start a statement with horse shit the rest will be horse shit
---
what level were you?
---
You literally can play it on everything but steam. You anti-EGS people are really damn obnoxious. Like I dont even open Epic, I just double click the Outer Worlds icon and the game launches. That's it. No waiting for steam to update first like it does 30 times a day. It's just not even remotely an issue anywhere except in your heads.
---
I don‚Äôt use the tent, I grab everything and fast travel back to my main camp, deposit and fast travel back, only costs cheap as I set up my camp near the area I am working in typically to offset costs.
---
But, but, surely he must have completely devastated you in some way? 
---
Unless you're being PAID by Bethesda to say this!
---
I really wish he wouldn't. I have no interest in playing fallout 76 anymore and some guy is currently informing Bethesda they can use that business model for future games I want to play.
---
Wow. Such a great, original post. Absolutely no one has posted this same exact thing dozens of times recently. I appreciate you sharing.
---
even if it doesn't as long as you don't move your camp it should still load next time your space is free
---
was he able to?
---
There is a bug that means you can join private servers if you are on their friends list I believe
---
So you don't think that marketing teams are on Reddit?
---
It happens with plenty of games, if they fuck something up the majority of people complain for a bit and then just leave. Look at Fortnite and their income tanking because of weird decisions made by the devs.
---
People don't stick around to complain when they can just go elsewhere.
---
Also, don't say that people didn't ask for Fallout 1st.

---
Still doesn't make it bloody right. Be careful what you wish for.
---
I played the game 11 months without the subscription just fine. Im ganna continue that trend.
---
Yup, totally get that..but if it works, then that means you can play the game without it crashing. Not saying its right, but I think its a compromise that puts you in a place to enjoy the game. 
---
I also wouldnt hold my breath for anyone at Bethesda to look at your logs to figure out the actual issue..there could be a large number of factors and they would have to replicate your setup exactly. And it could take hours of their time to figure it out. Now, if the issue was wide spread, they may indeed decide thats a good course of action to take. In the context of 'wide spread' though, I would have to think this particular issue would be impacting many thousands of people and I can't say one way or the either if it is (based on your log collection post, I'd lean towards not wide spread), but thats usually how it works..similar to any sort of recall, the company will decide if it makes financial sense to dedicate resources to fix a problem. So far, the most they've done is put together that guide I linked previously..otherwise, you're really left to your own devices. Certainly frustrating, but again..joys of PC gaming.
---
Everyone here applauding lackluster gameplay on an old ass engine. Fuck Bethesda
---
Works the other way too.
---
So speed demon isn't correctly effected by "Strange in Numbers" or any mutation modification (positive or negative) so the hunger/thirst effect is excessive whenever you move :(
---
English, not even once .
---
Except I like to take over workshops for a source of plans and loot, which enables Pvp too.  That one I understand.
---
Or you could not be a scumbag and actually pay for a decent game that took time/effort to make.
---
People like you are the reason that this monetization bullshit has become so bad.  You‚Äôll look for any loophole to scam, pirate, or not have to pay for the game.  But you‚Äôll play it; you‚Äôll even enjoy it.  If everyone does what you are advising, the gaming industry will stop with offers like that, and will recoup money via other tactics.
---
Now, I called you a scumbag because you are acting like one with that train of thought.  I‚Äôm not saying that you are always a scumbag.
---
I had to drop 40 bulk steel a couple weeks ago. Rarely am I in a team, but had 2 others that day, they didnt need it either.  It did not ruin my experience.  
---
Junk is just that. Junk. That's all that goes in the scrap box.    Sure, it was useful at level 20, but rarely is even collected any more. It was just 400 lbs of stash space wasted incase you have to fix your base, or move.  I still had a nice base, with 3 full vendors, and enough storage to grind ammo. 
---
I've played since beta. I remember stacks of legendaries at the vendors, just thrown away. That was so much worse than tossing some junk. 
---
If to you the worst part of 1st is non-subs tossing out excess junk, hope this does add some perspective.
---
You‚Äôre kidding right?
---
Well, it is not my primary foreign language so bugger off!
---
Of course they are, but to claim that no one can speak well of the game without being on the PR payroll is just stupid.
---
Because running around Whitesprings in a circle and playing a broken Battle Royale mode is fun and original...
---
this guy still likes the game. thanks man.
---
Just like all the previous versions, it has its quirks and issues.
---
But if you enjoyed the others, you'll likely enjoy 76 as well.
---
But its still fallout.
---
Had I listened to all the negative press 11 months ago, I would have returned the unopened package to the store... but I ignored all the negative... almost 700 hours later, still having fun in the wastelands.
---
Some of these feela awfully fishy man.
---
Also the mire, savage divide, cranberry bog...
---
Or if they flat-out came out and said that the "Zetans" engineered the whole thing.
---
Except today would be actually doomsday and the homeless guy would have been right.
---
I've been here since launch day. When stash box was 400lbs. Like fuck out of here with that dumb shit child loool
---
Sorry for the delayed response, weekends are adulting heavy!  
---
If you take them out of SLI and start up the game with Task Manager running (And GPU + GPU Engine shown) you may / may not see them running on GPU1 vs GPU0  
---
Trying to find people with multiple GPU's to replicate the issue.
---
Keeping their heads down so we duke it out between ourselves and don't start throwing punches them.
---
[You can't!](https://i.redd.it/2vckoe5g9bu21.jpg)
---
I would say those places have a ton of plant life. Ever here except for the ash heal and toxic valley.
---
Pretty much.
---
They are taking a wait and see approach. 
---
[Right now, Bethesda is taking a "wait and see approach", and may change some features of Fallout 1st depending on how "big of a deal people make about it".](http://mmogfails.blogspot.com/2019/10/fallout-76-and-fallout-1st-fiasco-it.html)
---
Because that always works. Always.
---
FOR FREEEEE
---
That‚Äôs nice. Why are you here?
---
Oh fuck Todd please no Todd I‚Äôll buy Skyrim again just let me cancel please Todd
---
Wastelanders was supposed to come out and make changes to this. At least to the actual lore behind it.
---
Guys how do I reactivate my Blizzard account? My anti Blizzard memes aren't making me karma anymore.
---
I was wondering if this still existed. Seen an explosive instigating shotgun in someone's shop but decided against it because of this bug
---
cold (freeze) would be nice
---
I was just coming to ask the same thing. Bring on the First flair! I mean seriously the haters can just piss right off, who cares if they get mad.
---
Lol that's a great call. So... If we put /s after our comment, BSG will think it's a good deal?
---
Savage divide has very little plant life. And the big is few and far between outside of groves. Mire is totally mutated but yes I guess it is full of trees. It certainly is dark though which it sounds like OP is looking for.
---
Lol praising Tod?
---
I know. I am on your side.
---
I still play both, need to sell out of my vendor from time to time
---
yikes
---
Bethesda could send every player a real gold bar for free and some people would complain that they should have sent it a day earlier, or they dropped it on their foot, or they had to go to the post office to pick it up, or they're allergic to gold, or now they're anxious that someone will steal it, or they want the equivalent in silver, or they want cash instead, or the packaging is non-recyclable, or the gold probably wasn't mined ethically etc, etc,  etc...
---
You know what it means.
---
Someone that still play this game after the first month are the mentally disturbed people. Rather not even talk to the people still playing after the Fallout first thing.
---
I bought it mostly for the fun of it but now i deeply regret my decision
---
Yep, as long as people let them get away with such shady practices, they will just keep coming.
---
No. I really don‚Äôt.
---
When I grind Encryptid now I'll just invite my friends to my private server. It sucks when worlds are full and not all of us can get in. I just exit out of my private world and wait 20 minutes to get around the three hour cool down. Plus that way you don't get randoms who don't know how to play the event grabbing pylons and instantly dying. But I do still go into public servers when I need to make some capperinos
---
Now put vending machines on the top level.
---
You're a snivelling dumb asshole. Change my mind.
---
I was able to play without subscribe since a year and I still am.
---
I just sell on reddit. Make way more caps and deals there. I'll buy stuff out of folks vendors on occasion but reddit is really my biggest source of caps from selling items
---
I join public to go shopping now and stay in private to play. Everything just works better in the private world.
---
I have a permanent damage bug on JE shotguns but no others. Tried different kinds of shotguns and they all work except JE.
---
For you maybe. Some people learn by reading. Some by listening. Some by doing.
---
And some never learn at all.
---
I thought we already knew Bethesda's pr were out in full force this week. Promoting the outer worlds
---
Your soul now wholly belongs to Bethesda
---
Have Fallout 1st. Still don't pick up any scrap. Too weighty
---
We're too busy playing the outer worlds
---
Are you suggesting that people are paid to say bad things about this game? 
---
Because Fallout 76 doesn‚Äôt need any help for folks to complain about it. From petty things that only blew up because it was popular to shit on it, the canvas/not canvas bag. To legitimate complaints like fundamentally breaking core mechanics of Fallout, bullet sponges, survival aspects designed to just pad the game and encourage micro transactions, excessively buggy, etc. 
---
No one is on going to be on here singing the praises of the game. The best I‚Äôve seen is people saying they are having fun playing the game, even though it‚Äôs a fucked up and not really Fallout. I‚Äôm still trying to like this game and commit to it, but after nearly a year, I find myself begrudgingly playing the game, then get annoyed with my ammo gets depleted in two waves of enemies and then I have to start eating and drinking.
---
so i'm not the only one, so glad to meet someone of similar circumstance.
---
when i first started 3, my issue was not the very  beginning inside Vault 101, it was once i left the vault.... i had no idea about using the pip-boy map with the dotted line to show you the way so instead of going to Megaton i go the opposite to Big Town, at this point I did not know about VATS (i chose not to follow the "guide") so i wasted whatever little ammo i had and got chew up by a couple raiders and dogs.... urgh, i was ready to throw in the towel till i decided to watch someone do the walkthrough on YouTube, followed the mechanics of it and never turned back. oh those were the days
---
People who use this sub like the game
---
Same here, it‚Äôs do-able if your building‚Äòs bottom floor is below where you first dropped your CAMP bench. I‚Äôve been able to build 9-story structures by placing the CAMP in high places.
---
200 at release right? How the fuck did we fit anything
---
I shot a guy in PA with 2 mini nukes before the PvP nerf and he survived. Explosive damage is easily mitigated. If people are dying to mini nukes their health has to be pretty low and serendipity didn't work.
---
-$1 of your dollars = +1 of Bethesdas dollars
---
Hell yeah, imma have to start doing that. I love that event and hated doing it on publics cause it was either no one showed or folks showed but wouldnt grab pylons. I hating trying to dps and tank pylons at the same time cause people cant read in this game.
---
1) lol what? You know it's the PvP Mode they released time ago that recently got a new map, right? Or is this one of those "technically still in beta" comments?
---
2) Good point. It usually doesn't take that long to find a match for me.
---
3)  It's their responsibility to make the game playable for consoles. They released the game on them.
---
For me its more the price, my girlfriend got shafted when she paid full price for the game for my birthday in november, and I feel the sub price is too high for what it is. ‚Ç¨ 5 would have been more reasonable for what is on offer. Just throwing in an equiv value in atoms doesn't really make it "worth it" imo because the atom shop never sells anything interesting for me (enclave all the way!)
---
[Oh yeesssss.....](https://static1.thegamerimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Todd-Howard-ATM.png?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=450&amp;h=489&amp;dpr=1.5)
---
Instead of the floor is lava.....
---
I fine tuned everything but my JE is permanently bugged so that one isn't useful at all. TSE can take out a robot at close range but that's about it.
---
At this point anything they post will just get downvoted to hell and destroyed. I mean you know that's what you are all waiting to do any ways. So they're probably just working on the game, waiting for the haters to run out of breath before commenting.
---
Same
---
Dude so sorry to not have let you know. So we figured out that for some stupid reason. When I click on a vendor I can see all of my vendors in one but my buddy only saw what I put specifically in the machine. I had to cycle the sort button (y) for it to only show me what's in that specific machine. There are only 2 sort options. Show marked only and show marked +stash. The default is show marked+stash but it shows everything in all vendors when before it never did. When I cycle to marked only it shows only that vendor items. Then when I go back to marked+stash it shows only that vendor items and stash like before. It is a visual glitch that doesn't put my stash items in danger.
---
Watching class war that going on. I would say this is the best Outer Worlds advert ever
---
Wow, that's creepy. Why are you stalking me like that? Also, I joined three years ago so look again.
---
Heh, that would be pretty funny, can‚Äôt place vendors in workbench areas though. I‚Äôd imagine you could build super-high around those monorails and power steeples though. That might be my next project.
---
No, it's just people who dislike the game leave, and those that like stay. Creating an echo chamber. That echo chamber has been getting smaller and smaller over the last year, but the more who leave the more fervent those who stay behind become.
---
Every event plays out different. Just having the ability to do any part of the game with a completely different group of people makes every square inch of map more repayable than the entirety of a linear game.  I loved old school fallout, I loved mario and pacman too. But I dont still play them. Good for a retro moment or 2, but not much more.  Games have evolved, and so has my interest.  Grinding a slow game till the end to get a story is just annoying anymore.
---
Edited. Meant to say not out yet for a year as op said
---
Game plays smoothly on my Xbox.
---
Memes aside, you can try submitting a ticket: https://help.bethesda.net/
---
I still play, not a Bethesda employee ....
---
Is it so hard to comprehend some people understand the business model they run on?
---
Everyone expects everything to be perfect and free......
---
Dunno as a 50 yod gamer , glitches and add ons were a normal thing.
---
They care by pretending that optional content is mandatory?  Care by throwing a fit over the price without actually looking up the cost of server rentals?
---
You only started posting 2 days ago..
---
And why? It is the cost of a server rental
---
But private servers are not private. Like literally anyone can connect
---
Why are fanboys‚Äô opinions a problem, but not those with hateboners against the game? 
---
I don‚Äôt like it at all and think it was a MASSIVE mistake, but that doesn‚Äôt mean someone can‚Äôt enjoy it. People shell out for EA sports games every year, after all.
---
To be honest the player vendors were a great idea but it made it extremely easy to get caps. Sell your Ammo, Sell your Junk, just sell everything
---
If no microtransactions, how does the game continue to be supported? I bought the game for continuous content. Single player games are different, the initial purchases pay for development. Games like this, initial purchases pay for development, then the game continues to be worked on. Devs need a paycheck
---
Do you wanna see how many things have went wrong with fo76? Not just fo1st. And don't be a sheep you know these private "servers"  can be locally programmed to play p2p. The server jargon is only there to monetize.
---
They monetized the game by charging $60 for it.
---
https://youtu.be/k40jJKHOnqQ here you go.

If anything snow would make things easier on you.
---
Winter means dead foliage and denser fog.
---
have a look at the places where someone HAS dropped or tested nukes. Still trees and life, so we'll have to give them this one. No humans around to trash it.
---
side note := If the waste land is set in the future, then why is the man made appearance, of the 1950's.
---
Do the same? Awful idea. Think before you type.
---
The people who play this game to have content added regularly, you know that right?
---
No. dont get it.
---
And? This game has been out months
---
Ever since the 2016 elections people have been given a new way to labor in their own delusions. If you don‚Äôt like what people are saying, it‚Äôs fake news, it‚Äôs paid shills or bot accounts. Will I deny that these things exist entirely? No I won‚Äôt, but the easiest way to tell will just be looking at peoples post history. A Bethesda paid shill isn‚Äôt going to be subbed to r/memes or r/idiotsincars. People don‚Äôt like having their opinions challenged though, so they‚Äôd rather not do that and simply exclaim that those with a differing opinion are paid to do so, or not even people at all.
---
Yeah, 200 in early days. I have no idea how we did it.
---
1) He and Phoenix get stuck from time to time...  
---
2) Let me know if you do!  
---
3) Interesting, will try to replicate
---
Three shots on ghouls with a shotgun though? Three shots against the weakest enemy out there is kinda bad.

~~Vault Dweller~~ Unreliable dweller ;)
---
Nothing they could say that would  (rightfully) make people happy. They are gonna keep the subscription and wastelanders is not coming any sooner. No major content is coming soon. They know to keep their mouth shut for now.
---
Being that my wife doesn't have the sub, and she is one of the most casual players I've seen (And in terms of combat tactics the most clueless) 
---
If the game is unplayable to you, I'm going with user error.
---
Coming soon to an Atom Shop near you!
---
Oh ok, you are right then, it's somewhat recent.
---
&gt;Game plays smoothly on my Xbox. Nothing runs smoothly on ps4
---
Lol that's harsh. On my Xbox Adventure mode doesn't run well at all, but Nuclear Winter runs pretty good and never crashed for me personally
---
They've increased base stash twice. It's not 200 anymore, it's 800
---
Idk about you, but I've been able to play the game since the beta. I haven't even bought the subscription.
---
I think you should, mate. You feel right at home amidst all that toxicity.
---
It's my understanding they rent servers through AWS. Regional pricing differences by Amazon would be the most likely place to look.
---
So pay to win mobile mechanics is what is considered ‚Äúfun‚Äù now? You must be joking?
---
&gt; Don‚Äôt be such a lair Jeff.
---
Don't be such a Todd.
---
Stop being a shill
---
You are still having trouble in adventure mode on Xbox? Maybe I‚Äôm just lucky, I haven‚Äôt crashed in months. And nuclear winter runs pretty well. I have crashed once or twice but not in a long time in that mode either.
---
Good question.
---
I love the tent. It's just so damn cozy. I've kind of replaced my camp with it and just use that now. And with the addition of playing private and truly being alone now, the game is just really fantastic. I started over from scratch and it's like playing a whole new game. No rush from friends or event mates, no missing power cores, no respawning mobs half way through a building cause some one else walks in. It's just truly my own game now and I am really enjoying it!
---
That's actually nonsense. Please don't start rumours without reasonable evidence
---
How did he deserve it, for getting Fallout First?
---
I'm glad he did, at least we caught whiff of the issue on day one. Even more ammo against Bethesda.
---
Maybe with a successfull subscription service funding 76, the price of cosmetics in the Atom shop will start dro....
---
BAHAHA, who am I kidding!
---
The way Borderlands does it is pretty cool. Just super-powerful turrets at level borders that kill you if you go out of bounds. Imagine MODUS just lasering you from orbit to stop any potential infected from leaving his zone of influence.
---
You and I must have very different opinions on what constitutes as "hate".
---
I'll agree with the DDOS thread. That is cleraly harassment and is also illegal. But the rest of the threads... no.
---
This link for example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dn0c25/fallout\_1st\_supporters/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dn0c25/fallout_1st_supporters/). The guy expressed his opinion and called a large anonymous group "willfully ignorant". Is that "hate" in your book? Because if that's how you feel, then I don't think the problem lies on their side, but rather yours and your severe over-sensitivity to criticism.
---
Yup I completely agree with you. I won‚Äôt even be touching the TOW until it gets on steam. Fuck Epic.
---
How I deal with griefers. 1). You can just go into passive mode. You can still adventure with other players and kill baddies. And you don't have to worry about accidentally hurting nice players. 2.) Let them kill you a few times and then go into passive but equip rare gear. I think to put on the old man winter Fasnacht mask and leather traveling coat w/ backpack. I've had a few griefers beg me to.teade with them. 3.) Just go to a different server. 
---
I know some of that takes the fun away but there are multiple ways to deal with griefers. Don't let them ruin your experiences. There's even a peck that a grenade will go off everytime you time. Pretty sure there's also a peck that adds the radius to your explosions. Get those perks to deal with griefers to some extent.
---
Even if they were to turn around and offer the scrap bin and tent this week or next week as a show of good will towards the player base, I wouldn't feel burned at all. I'm more than getting my money's worth with just the private server and the atoms each month. Everything else that was included was just fluff on top that was nice to get. But frankly, they were almost all things (besides maybe the emotes) that I felt everyone should have access to, not just the subscribers. It'd be nice to keep some small things locked behind the subscription like emotes or icons, simply because it gives a little mark of "Hey, I'm supporting this game" without being something that can be seen as an advantage over other players.
---
Too bad the 1st'ers don't have the power of drama on their sides.
---
Yes, I assume, you'll see peoples' disappointed reactions soon enough posted here in between the nonstop Fallout 1st hate.  That's my prediction after seeing what YouTube streamers have posted for data mined rewards.
---
It just works
---
I'm sorry, are you the internet police or something? I don't have to explain any of this to you. It has nothing to do with the subject of this thread.
---
Yes. Patience.
---
have not subscribed, and has made no difference to me. In fairness tho, would have been possibly better, that what you get in 1st, STAYS in 1st. That would give the paying 1st class passengers what they want, and no rebukes from anyone else.
---
With this one in particular? Yes, ofc it is.
---
Lol. Clearly it proves you are just trolling based on how you keep deflecting.
---
I never thought about it but, now that you mention it...
---
And Asylum dress and hat too. Don't forget the Tinfoil Hat either.
---
It cant be any more boring than Meat Week was.
---
Well no. I never played wow and I haven‚Äôt touched overwatch since the first Anniversary event. To put it in perspective I stoped playing right before the hamster. That‚Äôs just because I hated playing the game because of the events and a seriously bad case of FOMO, not because of the company. I‚Äôm not playing 76 because Borderlands and TOW take up my time. I deleted it because I got game pass so I needed space for a bunch of games and because 1st is absolutely disgusting and I definitely don‚Äôt want to be playing right now.
---
But guess what. I don‚Äôt ducking care if people still wanna play. That‚Äôs *there* choice. Who gives a shit what others do in there own fucking time with there own hard earned money. 100$ is a lot money for middle to low income citizens but not everyone that plays games is poor. And not everyone that‚Äôs rich or more well off is a complete scumbag that doesn‚Äôt deserve there money. My uncle in law *busts his ass off* setting up internet from a company he started himself. He deserves to buy stuff he wants because he earned it. So if I had more money coming in where 100$ was just nothing you get your ass I would buy the 1st. If it was my favorite game of course and I played it all the time. 
---
Now get off your high horse and stop caring about what others do. I‚Äôm going to continue not playing 76, *becuase it‚Äôs something I wanna do* until Bethesda fixes there shit while also *not caring* that people are still playing.
---
You posted this because....
---
1. You're craving attention.
---
2. You're trying to get a reaction.
---
3. You're trying to justify your supporting a company that takes advantage of you.
---
And the fact you're relying to me proves everything above and shows that you care about what others think.
---
Na keep griefing the subscribers
---
You could do something else
---
I've got 5 characters. My main is nearly level 200, my secondary is probably level 70ish, and the rest are lower levels.
---
Not an opinion post, 11 months prior. game was never unplayable, but rocky
---
I have played plenty of ptw mobile games. A single buy in FFXV costs $100, and if you dont spend $100 next week. Someone that did will come eat you. They have zero in common with fallout. I have spent more on dlc in Civilization 6, than a years worth of first. Zero people call that game a cash grab.
---
What is fun is knowing that everyone than has the game can do any mission I can. Can join any map, get any gun, forever.
---
Have you been able to identify any hardware bottleneck? You should if you can and then start from there.
---
If there is no hardware bottleneck then you are looking at fixing software inefficiencies such as ini tweaks and nvidia config changes as others have suggested.
---
You came on a fallout 76 subreddit to say outer worlds was better. You're here to spread hate.
---
Here https://support.playstation.com/s/article/Cancel-Auto-Renewal-for-Subscription-Services?language=en_US
---
I'm deflecting because it has nothing to do with the thread. Do you know what an ad hominem argument is?
---
Looked like most of the rewards were pumpkin displays and maybe two costumes?  I didn't see any new weapons or armor.
---
I still play public.  The only time I've gone private was when my caps were maxed out and I didnt want anyone buying anything else from my vending while I tried to unload some caps.
---
And how many of those are game altering mods?
---
I already uninstalled to make room for RDR2.
---
I was talking about the event itself. Meat Week was boring as hell.
---
Goodbye
---
I care too, and I thought that this was a well written, carefully considered analysis.
---
If you're getting vatsed in PvP you are doing it 100% wrong
---
Don't forget that it has [16 times the detail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZc1I6uJ70w)!
---
I don't have it but several of my friends do. It's nice doing events without random dickholes one shotting legendaries and doing the SBQ without a bunch of low levels getting in the way. It's actually easier for our group to all get on the same server. I wasn't interested in buying it at first but I'm leaning towards getting at least a month of it after experiencing how nice it is to be able to scrip without some bell end slashing at me with their bloody meat hook.
---
Yea, maybe that one guy. All the others are not a subject of argument tho.
---
Report suspected accounts to the reddit admins by modmailing /r/reddit.com
---
They can see if an account changed hands and ban it permanently.
---
Im actually amazed with the server crashes a disconnects i can actually play the game vs gta and red dead where i cant even stay connected for more than 5 mins and they have more expeirience
---
Thing is ESO could be bought for little amount of money and it has infinitely more content than FO76. 
---
No-one has a problem with paying for ESO because it's a fairly decent MMO.
---
FO76 on the other hand severely lacks content, I mean it's laughable.
---
1. Show that the private server is over priced for what you get. AKA price shop around and show Betehsda is screwing people.
---
2. Show me were Bethesda said that private server would be free. I don't want an assumption I want a direct statement from them.
---
I think it's fun with out it I think it just makes the game more fun
---
I run Heavy weapons for the SBQ battles, so I use PA and the Stabilized Perk, but a couple days ago I was killed &amp; re-spawned in the fissure 3 times in a row, the 4th re-spawn put me at the Glassed Cavern, makes no sense at all since I was near Delta when I initially died.
---
Good to know, I probably should start doing that. I remember seeing a few of those where their past activity was completely removed and I only see them active here or r/fallout.
---
Players now a days don't know how good they have it. I remember filling my 200 stash box limit in a few minutes after walking through 2 feet of snow uphills both ways.
---
You do know that saying is bullshit right? They have actually tested that and shown that frogs will get out of hot water.
---
Honestly best thing any of you could do is drop the game and move on. Bethesda clearly doesn‚Äôt care about our opinions, and are instead focused on making as much money as they can out of this stunted launch of a product, reputation be dammed. 
---
Bottom line- stop buying Bethesda games. There‚Äôs so much better stuff out there from developers who care and want to give you quality entertainment for your hard earned cash, there‚Äôs no reason to waste time and money on Bethesda anymore.
---
Meat Week was weaker than the parade event, it was a quick successful event if enough people showed up and knew what to do!  Meat Week sucked when no one showed or idiots didn't complete the tasks fast enough.  Speed won Meat Weak not standing around or running far away chasing a squirrel.
---
hmm interesting, thanks
---
Oh, a Fallout themed joke is toxicity now? Grow some skin pal.
---
Grahm?
---
Those are definitely suspicious, but we don't have access to the back end activity data to make a definitive determination, so they still have to be reported to the admins.
---
We had to make our own stash boxes by hand
---
So a youtube video contains a list of different server rental sites that offer similar services for less?
---
Sorry to hear yet another fan of bethesda' s franchises is leaving with a horrible taste in their mouths of what Bethesda has become. Seems alot have been leaving of late ‚òπ it's a horrible turn of events. The community is what makes this game good but beth has even divided this 
---
I still play fo76, i won't subscribe ( although I have been extremely tempted but havnt because i still have my self respect).
---
 I'll still probably buy the new ES  but won't go out and buy new like I would of, before all this I would have blindly followed bethesda but now I'll wait and buy 2nd hand, Bethesda won't get my money.
---
Shame on bethesda for pumping out a product that people want to buy
---
I definitely agree with you. Contrary to how the post makes me seem I typically give everything a shot at least once. I mean why would I pay for ESO+? Just to try it out and it was a fantastic addition to the value of the game. 1st tho, 1st seems like a cash grab for things that were already included in previous games *read storage space* and stability. I mean honestly, I shouldn't have to pay a sub to get my own server just to have a stable connection so I can enjoy base features of the game. Does better show my outrage?
---
Will do, thanks for the tip.
---
&gt;We pay their bills.
---
We pay the bills for every software studios game we buy. That's how it works everywhere for *everyone. 
---
*excluding pirating of course
---
*laughs in outer worlds*
---
Yet here you are....
---
lol
---
With straw and pencils.
---
Fasnacht was eh, but at least you had enemies to kill and could be chaotic.
---
Meat Week was just boring, running around killing squirrels and collecting plants. Gee wiz! Once I got the Tenderizer, I bailed...and never touched the Tenderizer since.
---
Didnt even go anywhere near the event on the pointless second go around. However, Primal Cuts is a far superior event and I hoped that stuck around, but of course it did not.
---
I also would like to know. I want to start using emergency protocol,nerd rage and blocker+ insect repellant. That should make me invulnerable in the raid, on paper ,but i bet it won't be the case.
---
My opinion? Its because people are tired of the constant negativity being thrown around and are trying to look on the bright side and look at the positives rather than keep looking at all the negatives. If you want to be vocal about how much you hate the things that have changed and happened, you've got a right to do that. But everyone who wants to talk about the positive stuff instead and keep things in a brighter outlook have that right as well. It doesn't make them shills, it doesn't make them Bethesda's PR force or anything like that. It just makes them people who don't want to be bogged down in negativity over a game they enjoy.
---
I can agree with you on this. Now the fake accounts, bit of a stretching theory but i can work with it giving Bethesdas current status.
---
Cheers! Thanks for doing your part to clean up the wasteland :)
---
I uninstalled till Wastelanders. I was back and actively playing for a bit, but the delay+1st one-two fsil combo got under my skin.
---
No problem
---
Anything to get rid of the ghouls ;)
---
More like Meat Weak
---
They did though people complained alot about the gold they implemented the grind requirement to earn in game the cost of items for red dead anyway gta wasnt as bad so people let it go u basically bought fake cars for real money no1 cared cuz of 0 impact on game
---
I'm sure Microsoft fully realizes what their doing putting a big title on game pass at the same time as it is $1, and won't penalize Obsidian for their own marketing move. I personally bought the game, because I will probably do multiple playthroughs and like not feeling like there's a deadline to complete the game, but it's perfectly reasonable to take advantage of a service provided.
---
Lol you litterally defend every company that has a sub/ money predatory system. Runescape this. And you asking if gta could have one? Wtf is wrong with you? I get it you have money to spend. But like i said these arent even servers. Why can destiny have raids that last hours with a fireteam of 6? With no extra cost? Technically your using a private server for just you and 5 other people. THIS SERVER YOU SPEAK OF ON FALLOUT DOES NOT SAVE YOUR PROGRESS. HOW THE HELL SHOULD A PRIVATE LOBBY COST MONEY. and you aren't gonna watch that youtube video. I know you won't because you will defend your tiny little opinion to the end of time. Without considering how much of a mess fo76 has been since beta.
---
Excellent.
---
And yet you‚Äôre not jumping.
---
It's just a hassle to reequip all my armour pieces over and over again after dying and respawning in the zone far from where the action is and I'm not asking for them to change the area but instead to respawn people outside of the zone so they won't instantly become one with atom and disintegrate into red paste
---
Sure thing, probably for $20 per month lol
---
Fallout 76 seems to be dependent on a server to host the world, mobs and other things. GTA:O was built from the ground up as a Peer to Peer game, and it shows quite a bit when you play, teleporting players NPCs hits not registering... it‚Äôs really a much more frustrating mess even now than Fallout 76 is. 
---
I would like to see them actually give you a persistent server that your friends can join when you aren‚Äôt there though, as it is right now the ‚Äúfind an empty server and dump you on it, and everything is handled the same as a normal public server‚Äù thing doesn‚Äôt make it worth it.
---
I do. Performance issues when selling to vendors, putting lots of stuff out of the stash, switching weapons or taking a couple of aids items like drugs and drinks. 
---
I crash now and then, often when it comes to endgame stuff like Proyect Paradise and Schorched Earth (maybe due to the amount of enemies) and due to poor performance I haven't been in silos and raids again (never completed a single quest or challenge from the Vault, I was waiting for them to improve performance).
---
I can't say the games runs bad always, it's mostly pretty playable specially on Nuclear Winter. But it lags often, and stuff that I used to do all the time like taking psychobuff has become laggy and annoying. It might be related to my weight reduction perks or my weight reduction legendary armor, because in Nuclear Winter it works fine.
---
Sunk cost fallacy?
---
Your own statement was an opinion and not a fact. Fact is the gaming industry is thriving, both financially and creatively.
---
More like 16 times the transactions
---
It's 20 seconds and also I was spamming the shit out of my Radaways as well as having ghoulish and solar powered equipped but the 90-100 rads per second when you respawn in the zone, usually next to the fissure overwhelm you before you have a chance to act

# ##Event: Always Vigilant

**Issue: Infrequently B1-22 that Rover will bug and just "Hover" near the end of Event: Always Vigilant.**
---
FSS02\_Vigilant "Event: Always Vigilant" \[QUST:000A73DC\]  
---
He fails to return to the pod and as a result the cause a failure.  
---
Some have suggested this is linked to Rover showing "Repair Sparks" still, even when the player has performed the repair, and it's theorized this is caused by repairing him too quickly, before the quest text requiring the repair pops up or by having him repaired and then immediately knock down again causing a misfire of the quest.

Fix:

Unknown
---
You really think I‚Äôm going to trust the mod of a sub about a game on this one? Yikes.
---
I mean its still not p2w right guys...right....?
---
It‚Äôs really just not the same content. People can post pics and it‚Äôs not a place for wishlists and rants
---
Pretty much p2w
---
Why are you suddenly unable to have fun with it? Nothings been taken away. They didn‚Äôt suddenly take things you had and make you pay to continue using them. If the idea of missing out without paying is something that can ruin a game for you, that‚Äôs okay I understand. I was the same way with Destiny when Bungie told me I had to pay *another* $40 on top of the money I had already spent for the game plus year 1 season pass if I wanted to keep progressing. But I didn‚Äôt go around telling people who put out that $40 or decided to keep playing even without paying that it was impossible for them to be having fun. 
---
Fun is 1000% subjective. You can‚Äôt claim it‚Äôs impossible to have fun with a game just because you don‚Äôt.
---
I think people have a right to be angry and express their frustration if they feel they have been ripped off by a corporation. Many of the threads you linked has the OP describing in detail why they are upset, and the scenario they describe is not wrong. So it's not all unmotivated. So I don't see how you can call that hate or harassment, or even targeted.
---
You also made the bold claim that *half* the subreddit engages in this "hateful" behaviour, which is over 100,000 people. I don't think the game even has that many active players, so that's clearly an exaggeration as well.
---
So are you actually going to provide the pricing list I requested?
---
Same here. I try to use common sense and reasoning to show people that if we keep letting BSG get away with this nickel and dime for power scheme, it will just get worse. 
---
But I get called a troll and asked how it impacts me because there is no PvP.
---
Ridiculous argument.
---
What's next? Selling legendary weapons in the Atom Shop? Hey, there is no PvP, so how does it impact anyone that doesn't want to buy them?
---
What hot water? An optional game mode that I have no interest in?
---
Me Being a 2 handed melee non pa build find it very very beneficial to lure her to drop site so I can wack her to deal as much damage as I can without having to worry about rads, getting insta killed for wearing a hazmat or how many Radaways I have
---
About how long did it take you to discover them in there?
---
Dumb fuck. This is not a server. Are you gonna keep repeating yourself?
---
For my prime character level 271 I play pure public.  My vendor mule/responder merchant I will split time.  Why not take multiple workshops and farm the crap out of everything?  I take my goodies back to public to sell.  I sell far below most other vendors too, before some people tell me I'm some greedy SOB.
---
its the same thing as people pledge to their favourite game thats why i bought only a full year
---
I mean realistically, there‚Äôs a chance the Zetans actually did do it, and another that Vault-Tec. Remember that the Oversser was supposed to go to 101, but was given 76 because he found out about the experiments, and she even said that she could have prevented ‚Äúit‚Äù? But officially, according to the US, China started it.
---
I honestly think *you* are that person in this situation. Talk about an exaggeration.
---
I have to ask, what do you want them to say?
---
It seems to me there isn‚Äôt anything they could say that would make anyone happy or feel better, and anything they would say would actually just make people angrier.
---
Congrats! Bethesda helped me out as well with my proposal on launch day for 76, see they‚Äôre not all bad üòÇ glad ladydevann could help another couple!
---
GTA:O you can literally buy flying cars that shoot missles. Fuck outta here it has zero impact. Way more pay2win than an extra fast travel option.
---
Not me, I‚Äôm out. I‚Äôve moved to outer worlds (which is great). I‚Äôll be back to check out wastelanders.
---
I don't think they ever got the chance to attack anyone. I don't think they were activated before Eckhart did it. They were meant to boost morale for invading Chinese troops. They were likely programmed from the start to attack anything thay can't identify as a Chinese soldier.
---
looks like few hours cooldown, or so?
---
&gt; Bethesda has nothing to do with the subs. People just still like the game.
---
You're absolutely deluding yourself if you think that a company is going to invest millions of dollars in a AAA product, and not pick the low hanging fruit of swaying public perception through astroturf marketing.
---
Yeah, they're managing to milk this small community of support that stuck by them for all they're worth. I mean, why sell more copies when the people that love it, love it so much that they'll spend the equivalent of 4 copies a year on the game? I hate to be "that guy" but in today's AAA gaming climate, you just can't reinforce these bad practices.
---
Optional game mode? This is about Fallout 1st
---
It might be or it might not depending on your view of these things lol.
---
What I do bet tho is this little thing will be fixed in a jiffy because Bethesda would want you to buy into its fridges concept.
---
This negates that so will be high on their priority to amend this little exploit
---
Wasn't there a bug/glitch that when you scrap crops they still take up CAMP budget?
---
you're delusional.  Microsoft knows exactly what they are doing putting it on the game pass, the game isn't free it just costs a monthly subscription.
---
I hadn't checked the box since the build (2 days), but after my test they were there straight away.
---
I‚Äôd like to see Bethesda do some basic retextures to make the game more wintery. I‚Äôm not sure how they‚Äôd handle the Mire or the Forest but the Savage Divide, Ash Heap, Bog, and Toxic Valley would all be easy enough I think.
---
Seriously it's a tale as old as time.
---
I havent seen him to check yet but Ive been to a few places already.
---
You are a fanboy, you are level 359 with 1100 hours and purchased the fallout 1st membership, knowing it's pay to win. The denial in you is so high, you're like a spouse getting beat and still believing your significant other actually loves you. Your significant other tells you they wont do it anymore, but you still deal with it. If you can't see the correlation, then no one can help you. I actually seen relationships like this and while it sounds terrible, I honestly believe people like you actually deserve it because you push away and attack the very people who are concerned and are trying to reason with you.
---
No one is forcing you to do anything. But understand that you're encouraging Bethesda to continue lying and treating their customers like a doormat. Fork over money when a company deserves it, not when they lie in your face and make you pay as they fail to properly optimization their game and run on some garbage engine. Have some self respect for yourself. Also if people like you weren't paying for this garbage subscription, the company would think twice about doing stupid crap like this. Businesses only care about money, take their money and they will rethink their actions.
---
Most customers do not realize how much power they have in a capitalist market.
---
It does seem a little too convenient. Personally, I won't be surprised if they fix it and claim it was a bug.
---
When playing the beta I personally liked the game more than Fallout 4. After all the they have fucked up at the start I decided to wait until all the bugs are fixed and the content is updated... And now this shit. Even though I think it's not a worse Fallout than 4, I care for video games and it's industry too much to ever support this. And the players should consider the same rather than actually buy Fallout 1st.   
---
I must say, I really love how the scrap box deletes the items of some or how the private servers are a scam. Ironic :DDD
---
you sure you didnt hallucinate?
---
Yes.
---
Nobody got cheated, people got the service they payed for.
---
I used half as an hyperbole because it looks like a pretty good chunk of the subreddit, but I lack numbers so I had to use a rhetorical figure, but I understand that may require a superior intellect to grasp. 
---
And you asked for samples, I obviously couldn't pick every single of the many toxic posts that have been created lately.  And out of the 10ish I linked, you could only recriminate the validity of one. Not a good counter.
---
People have all the right to complain, but they have no right to hate others because they picked different choices and release their frustration on them.
---
I don‚Äôt like going private because I‚Äôm unwilling to give in to Bethesda‚Äôs intrusive monetization of a game I paid over $60 for.
---
While experiment, I built crops until I hit my budget, but it dropped again after scrapping.
---
You were downvoted because people completely misconstrued your point. And instead of retracting those downvotes when you explained yourself, they kept them because they are salty.
---
I asked you what it means to be unfinished, you deflect. 
---
I asked you if you play the game, you deflect. 
---
I mention that you joined 2 days ago, you lie and say you‚Äôve been around 3 years knowing full well you haven‚Äôt even commented on a post until 2 days ago.
---
It‚Äôs clear you are just here to troll. Your motives are clear. Have a nice day.
---
I‚Äôll play RDO with you fam.
---
What usually happened to me even before the event is fighting two lv50 and then a lvl65 join the two others.
---
That would probably depend on your energy resistance.
---
Oh yeah, you care so little you‚Äôre going to come into this circlejerk thread and circlejerk about a company that made a game you liked ten years ago.
---
Agreed, however it only seems to apply to scraped crops, so there might not be too much rush. Either way, I thought it was interesting.
---
I'm sure it is just a bug they will fix.
---
Lol server crashes are going to happen. No way around it.
---
That whole aid thing baffles me. I‚Äôve never experienced anything bad when it comes to consumables. I do have some lag when moving through stash, I will give you that.
---
I don't pvp or group with people, so public really doesn't matter to me. Maybe when I'm higher level and need to do some of the bigger things, I'll have no choice.
---
You joke, but that is exactly what their internal metrics show.
---
[The response on social media, Reddit, and gaming sites has been pretty negative, but internal metrics reveal that a "much larger than expected" amount of players bought the one month membership, with "a bit more than what we thought" amount of players buying the year long membership.](http://mmogfails.blogspot.com/2019/10/fallout-76-and-fallout-1st-fiasco-it.html)
---
As long as we keep paying QoL features, that should have been in the game AT LAUNCH, they will keep doing it.
---
I am calling it. Legendary gear coming to Atom shop next. Oh and a chest freezer that stops food from spoiling altogether.
---
&gt;Lol you litterally defend every company that has a sub/ money predatory system. 
---
And you do not answer my simple question.
---
&gt; Runescape this. And you asking if gta could have one?  
---
I literally have no idea what you are talking about here.
---
&gt; Why can destiny have raids that last hours with a fireteam of 6? With no extra cost?  
---
Because it takes place in a small (relatively speaking) area were the players are never to far away from them. Because Destiny doesn't have to calculate the spawns of literally hundreds of items, calculate the instance loot spawns of every container, ever mob spawn and every mob AI. In raids they have scripted spawns with scripted behaviors. The same reason why big open world games only load chunks of the game at any given time. If you load up Fallout 4 the entire game world isn't loaded at the same time only chunks around the player character is loaded because trying to load and maintain the entire game world would be to much for all but the beefiest PCs to handle. And even then it would take up a lot of memory.   
---
You are literally trying to compare a golf cart to a semi truck like they are exactly the same. 
---
&gt; THIS SERVER YOU SPEAK OF ON FALLOUT DOES NOT SAVE YOUR PROGRESS. HOW THE HELL SHOULD A PRIVATE LOBBY COST MONEY. 
---
Yes it does save your process though it is still not know at what rate does it auto save.   A private lobby should cost money because it is a private lobby separate from the official lobbies. Like literally every other game that has ever done this. 
---
&gt; and you aren't gonna watch that youtube video 
---
I don't give a shit what some idiot on youtube has to say. If they have any valuable points you should be able to repeat them. I'm not here to try and debate against someone who isn't even here. I"m here to debate against you.
---
Which is sad.
---
LOL. Is the pumpkin named Piper?
---
Couldn't you just cut the power to your vending machine?
---
I'm *here* because I find it fascinating to see how people justify giving money to a company that lies, cheats and steals. It's a fiasco with Beth ever since Skyrim was first released.
---
Wow, this is pretty cool. Now place something that launches whoever makes it to the top :-)
---
At this point I'm just mad that I'm not getting paid to like the game. XD I love this game, and everyone says the supporters are paid shills or employees. Where's my job, Bethesda?
---
:P
---
And what do you think FO 1st is used for?
---
They shouldn't be happening this regularly though, plain and simple. I shouldnt have to worry about launching a nuke for any reason other than it might it my camp if I sneeze while placing the the drop marker
---
So that is a no on the server pricing list. Thank you for continuing to prove my point.
---
I removed all tracking from other quests and this still happens to me.  Not only on this quest.  The Miner's Locker quest also.
---
One thing I was curious about:
---
You can log out of your private server, and log right back in to the same server.
---
I've done that many times to transfer items between characters by myself.
---
Now when you get disconnected from your private server, can you log back into the server? Or is it a "server crash" and that server is no longer available?
---
nope, logged back in just to check. It put me in a fresh slate
---
You are a moron. I'm not gonna sit here and debate on my cell phone. Screaming to a dense brick wall that thinks he is right about everything. I've never heard of a goof debater making their opponent do the research that you should bring to the table. Here how about those nylon bags again?
---
I watched a group of maybe 5 or 6 fallout 1st players build their camps together (maybe to build a town or whatever) and they got nuked within 30 minutes of being on the server üòÇ
---
I haven‚Äôt logged in since the week of release lol
---
Ok so I'll bite do you purchase any other battle passses?  Cause 1st pretty much offers the same exact thing that other Battle passes offers, except you get about 23% more atoms for a monthly sub, and 100% atoms a month for the yearly sub. No other game does that, Free or AAA full price. Also those games don't let you earn in game currency. I mean this battle pass is almost identical to ESO battle pass yet nobody lost their minds about that one. The only thing I can think of is, well there is more to do in ESO. But ESO has also been out A LOT longer than 76, and Lord knows if Private servers got delayed the world would've ended for some people.
---
As far as I'm aware it isn't just Fallout, I noticed this when I used to buy DLC for Destiny, they just charged you the numerical value of the currency universally indiscriminate of exchange rates e.g. I'd buy a DLC for ¬£20 because its 20$ but when you take into account exchange rates ¬£20 doesn't equal 20$ it's actually 25.70$. I'm sure this isn't the only occurance but it seems to be more common than you'd think.
---
That's like talking to a wall. Bethesda support is more useless than comcast support
---
It was NOT available to me after logging back in to try that. I was very hopeful. I figured, "its my server, i wonder if its still there... aaaaaaaaaand its not" 8\*(
---
That group exists for practically anything. Whiners. PR professionals know this and know how to deal with it. Bethesda's recent silence is a little funny.
---
How do you expect the on going online game to be financed without them charging for anything?
---
You work for Bethesda lol. Nice job trying to get us to quote out your shitty service.
---
The player count on this game is miniscule. People have and do quit this game
---
That would be outstanding, a bargain price of ¬£1.10
---
I actually have a switch installed, and can cut the power.  They don't show up on the map, but they still vend. They arent enclosed in my camp.  I didnt want to risk losing a good 3 star to the max cap void.
---
A joke used to insult, mate. So yeah: toxic behaviour.
---
No, you have to switch servers or worlds.  When you join in the new world, you cannot be near where you collect the quest from
---
nope. stay away
---
I love it. Three at once? Sign me up. The increased scorched ground troops are pretty fun, too.
---
More cyber bullying it‚Äôs messed up
---
Translation: I can't actually argue against the technical restrictions and limitations so I will deflect and claim that the other person is an idiot.  All the while trying to deflect and pretend that the burden of proof is on them to disprove my claim rather then provide evidence for my own.
---
Yea I get it you haven't done any research and you have next to no knowledge but you still make claims because reasons.  Seriously a simple google search will more then help you realize the price for server rentals is the same as literally any other site plus or minus a few dollars.
---
Wait, so Bethesda hasnt offered you anything?
---
I've noticed the uptick in paid posters and bots
---
Aw that blows. I sorta suspected that but haven't had a server disconnect on my private server yet, so couldn't test.
---
I will say, as shitty as it is to get disconnected at that point, the private servers seem much much more stable than the public ones.
---
Problem on this sub has always been folks spewing FUD for giggles.  Considering reddit subs are being cited by game magazines these days only looks to make it worse.
---
As for video, at least on console it's constantly buffering 15 minutes of video by default so its just one button hit to provide bug verification.
---
Was fighting a legendary god damn Scorchbeast at the far north fissure. Private server crashed while meleeing it. Cool beans.  Logged back in and headed back and Scorchbeast was just a basic bitch instead.
---
Ok so I'm kinda lost, how is the pricing for 1st any worse than the pricing for idk, Destiny 2, Fortnites, Modern Warfare, Apex??? If anything you get the same stuff, plus a server, and more in game currency than aforementioned games. So what's wrong with the pricing? 
---
Like I get the box and the tent, and I disagree with them, but the pricing is  on par with other AAA games.
---
yes
---
And here is this post, a little sunflower in the crack of the concrete.
---
Haven‚Äôt had an issue. Just don‚Äôt quit immediately after putting it in your stash
---
YAAAAAS LOVE IT
---
Huh. Well, I can see why you go private then. I'll keep that in mind if I ever get that far.
---
We should just shut it down until Wastelanders comes out
---
I'm sorry you enjoy sucking off china. The Epic Games launcher collects your data to send to china.
---
The same Bethesda that helped set up the sub before launch has nothing to do with the sub huh? The same company that has or reps troll the sub. The same Bethesda who's Todd Howard said he visits these subs? Yeah you are right - they have absolutely nothing to do with these subs.
---
As hard as I uninstalled 76 and am pissed, this looks sketchy as hell. I don‚Äôt believe it
---
It give me nothing more than absolute joy if all the code got completely re-written cause honestly I think it's safe to safe it's all this old ass code in the game that is probably causing a lot of the problems.
---
Pumpkin lantern plans , generic outfits and a pirate outfit seem to be the rewards.
---
As hard as I uninstalled 76 and am pissed, this looks sketchy as hell. I don‚Äôt believe the source
---
Uh huh, and keep defending garbage. I can enjoy an objectively bad movie such as "the room" but I'm not going to try to convince others that it is actually a good film. If everyone supported that movie with their money and Hollywood decided thats the only movie they are gonna make now it would be sad as hell.
---
You wanna play and support trash? At least be honest with yourself and us for the trash that it is.
---
All my other games run smoothy on ps4.
---
It's become an environment where people who don't play are getting a trial of the game and you are forced to pay in order to experience the full game.  I personally gave up on the game a while back after I finished the main story and realized the content was just going to be a major grind for little reward at that point.  I was waiting to go back once there was a new map or some DLC or something to make the game fresh again, but it looks like that isn't happening.
---
If Bethesda would have rolled out Fallout 1st by giving people a free trial, maybe a month free for new players and a year for people who bought the game, that would make more sense.  But I am not going to pay $12 a month on something I really don't enjoy from a company that doesn't seem to care.
---
I mean it IS amazing. Amazingly bad. 
---
All for the modest price of 15$ a month.
---
They're right though. This community keeps letting them get away with shit lmao
---
During and shortly after the beta they gave an obscene amount of nuclear material. It got nerfed.
---
That's what I'm saying, if anything the pricing model is almost identical every other game out there. Plus you get a server and anywhere from 23% to 100% more premium currency. Like idk understand this craziness.
---
Just incase you don't know, Obsidian is not the one that made it exclusive to the chinese launcher. Private Division, the publisher, made that choice.
---
Get rid of my money?  How?  I don't buy atoms, I earn them in game, I didn't buy a fo1st subscription, I see no need to.  If other people want to buy these things that's OK by me.
---
You and your weird sexual fantasies, now that *does* creep me out a bit.
---
It used to be a real nice place when I first joined. The last few days have been a bit better, getting back to normal.
---
That was the problem. It deleted your scrap when you force closed the game down. Couldn‚Äôt video that unless it was on your phone.
---
I love Bethesda, this game, and ***EVERYTHING*** they have done with this game.
---
Not a paid Bethesda employee.
---
Ye gods, I'm amazed you didn't hit build cap long before that.  
---
p.s.  That really needs a PA catapult setup top
---
Hey, you're getting that $5 beehive wig and you're going to like it!
---
i just tried it didnt work for scout quests
---
spawned on another server on other objective and run without fast travel
---
no quest
---
last time i did it 2 hours ago
---
and personal terminal also saying they unavailable yet
---
Well I musta missed that part where they said they had to take it out. Probably explains why FO4 had/has so many fucking problems.
---
Why even say this?
---
I'll give them credit for that, there's finally some of that player drama sweet todd wanted.
---
Check his other stuff. He called it on ESO, Anthem, lots of other games.
---
My main is 140~ and my bank alt was a character I initially started but messed up the perks on. 
---
Don‚Äôt use it as much as I probably should
---
You spawned too close. You cannot be at the location you get the quest from, you have to be somewhere else
---
Other sites have a persistent world. And most that charge are not for AAA studios such as Bethesda. But hey you go do what you want. You can defend whatever shill corporation you want. Just remember they don't give two fucks about you. And you are naive to think they do.
---
They didn't help set up the subs at all
---
I use Forward Station Delta as the fighting location. Every time I've died there I respawned just a few feet away. Never had to do the run through rads that happens if you fight at Drop Site V9.
---
&gt;What is the atom shop?
---
So you have no idea what you are talking about because you haven't played their games for years. 
---
Just a troll.
---
I call bullshit and bet you buy both eso6 and FO5 when they come out.
---
God kids like you are obnoxious. People don't agree with you so they MUST be corporate shills. Its just so obnoxious.
---
Sssh. They have enough bad ideas!
---
Are there also earthquakes, pictures moving on the walls, and doors closing?
---
Are you near alpine river cabins? It's haunted lol
---
Terrible comment and terrible attempt at explaining my point, I agree. 
---
But too far into it to delete it now
---
If you come across some log cabins have a look around for notes / holotapes. Also check out the pictures hanging on the walls.
---
I assume you are at those cabins? Look for a wire running along the trees. Follow it. Read journals and listen to holotapes in the area.
---
I like the game, hate the idea of the private servers.
---
I think everyone is mainly upset because they were expecting how private servers ran for things like rust, Conan, ark etc.
---
But instead got this weird multiplayer private lounge type system.
---
Which for it's price is not worth it if you compare other things near or below the price range they are asking for.
---
Drugs help.
---
No. The real Fallout is Fallout. The real Outer Worlds is the real Outer Worlds. You can like it more, that's fine, but it's not a real Fallout game.
---
There's a specific location where there's spooky screaming, but it's explained if you investigate further.  As far as I know, it's been in the game since day one.
---
Shame.
---
I‚Äôm happy because the game still entertains me, almost as much as you you people crying on Reddit do.
---
GTA online is also 100% Pay to win. You can buy all in game items using "Shark cards" that are even more unreasonably priced than Atoms are. Its not a good example at all.
---
Gotcha...maybe I never got to that weight, so I just never realized this
---
Nah, lets make it full pay to win already. I want to see people try to argue for this stuff.
---
You're going to have to accept the fact that Bethesda isn't going to shutter the game and people are going to still play and enjoy it, despite your hatred.
---
How have you guys just not uninstalled this piece of shit game? 
---
I uninstalled as soon as i heard about fallout 1st.
---
Bethesda doesnt give a shit unless you undownload it
---
Huh, ill have to play with it later.  I thought console buffered video regardless.
---
But all the posts and replys hyping up the outer worlds and telling everyone to buy that instead is totally cool. You people need to find something better to do holy shit guys it's just a video game you dont like.
---
How is it entertaining ü§£ what do you do anymore I‚Äôve ran out of things to do. You obviously are new üòÇ
---
There's a different bug where when you use a harpoon gun with the flechettes mod the enemies health shoots back up each time for some reason. Shotguns too.
---
Well if you actually watch Juiceheads video (mind you I'm not a fanboy, the kids gets plenty wrong, but he's not as bad as Yong Yea) you had to break into the dev room to get them and in the most recent patches they no longer function now. 
---
Now once again I don't want this crap but they seemed to function as a friend or server based boost. Think Feed the People (pre nerf) but for atoms.
---
Slightly, the game is too boring currently tho it‚Äôs not enough even on drugs.
---
Halloween event
---
like i must be outside of Mire?
---
Are you saying songs that are twice as long are twice as good? Books? Movies? That is a crazy way to medium value
---
Comparing both games seems silly  
---
Like comparing underkook BigMac with a full size plate with half kilo stake, sweet tato stuffed with dvine goodness and other stuff on the plate. And if you don't like being griefed, just find a nice active crew or activate a solo session
---
Amazon had FO76 for $30 on release date.

---
Back before I broke up with Bethesda when I thought they loved us scabs, I happened to have worn 2 different pieces of those and noticed it thankfully did NOT stack.
---
if realism is going to be an argument robots would give a hell of  alot more steel and other metal than they do, also cars
---
I never record so I just thought you could only record when the game was running. So closing the game down would stop any recording but I‚Äôve no idea how the recording works.Someone did do a video but they recorded it on their phone.
---
Usually i just fast travel to my camp before moving to a different world
---
The atom shop does not make the kind of money needed to run the game environment. I heard an estimate of 200,000 characters world wide on average logging in at least once per week.
---
I bet 10% of those actually buy things from the atom shop.
---
I reckon just a team of 10 staff working on 76 would cost upwards of ¬£500,000 per year? Not including any other costs.
---
I'd love if they were more powerful.  The true storms mod for fallout that let us make it more dangerous was great because it mattered if there was a storm.
---
If they could use that idea to give an actual sense of danger it would be great.
---
So how many of the posts and replys telling everyone to forget Bethesda and to buy the outer worlds are paid shills working for obsidian? Probably none since you guys like that message.
---
Last I heard the badge was a drop for the camp counselor that spawns at end.
---
They mentioned adding purchasable bonuses that would effect everyone on the server several months ago, I'm pretty sure there was the usual mtx fit so they haven't done it
---
The area I was playing in was double nuked so everything was covered except for drop site v9.
---
People should care. If beth/zos were struggling for cash to fund 76 before this, then the remaining players have a larger burden to bear going forwards.
---
And anyone can downvote you
---
That sounds very much like a Bethesda problem, 'Hey guys, our monetisation plan didn't work so now we are going to monetise the things we promised not to monetise'.
---
No, I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôve been playing since the first day of PC beta and have over 700 hours logged into the game. I usually help my lower level friends, as some of them can see past your ‚ÄúbEtHEsdA BAd ObSidIAn GoOd‚Äù bull and got the game anyway, so I show them around and assist in quests. And since First dropped, which both me and my very close friend bought, we‚Äôve started new characters just for when it‚Äôs us two. 
---
Just because you don‚Äôt think something is fun or cool doesn‚Äôt mean that you have the only valid opinion.
---
&gt;I used half as an hyperbole because it looks like a pretty good chunk of the subreddit, but I lack numbers so I had to use a rhetorical figure,
---
Or maybe you could try stick to actual facts instead of making them up. Hyperbole, yes, exactly... Just like your use of the words "hate" and "harassment". You're very good at exaggerating.  
---
&gt;but I understand that may require a superior intellect to grasp.
---
You know, if you're going to accuse people of being toxic, spreading "hate" etc, then maybe you shouldn't be doing the same thing by calling me or other people unintelligent like you just did. That was completely uncalled for and now you're just as guilty as they are.  
---
&gt;And you asked for samples, I obviously couldn't pick every single of the many toxic posts that have been created lately.
---
I know, and that's also not what I asked for. I only needed a few examples so I could get a sense of what you were referring to. I'm thankful that you took the time to provide me with those.  
---
&gt;And out of the 10ish I linked, you could only recriminate the validity of one. Not a good counter.
---
It was most of them actually. I only linked one of them as an example. I didn't feel I had to link every single one since they said pretty much the same thing. And I obviously can't comment on those that have been erased since I don't know what they said.
---
Again, I agree with you on the thread talking about DDOS, but the rest of the threads were valid criticism. And the moderators must have felt the same, or else they would have deleted them.
---
Edit 1: you're an idiot as you cannot possibly know whether Bethesda pays a PR company to promote them. 
---
So why even argue with OP? Because you're worried you'll be exposed as Bethesda PR, yourself.
---
Actually idgaf about obsidian I love Bethesda, but you don‚Äôt get ANYWHERE not listening to the community. And it‚Äôs evident in the fact fallout76 is the LEAST liked fallout ever. FACE FACTS BRO. They need to get their shit together.
---
So pretty much you want the company to give up on the game and any attempts of making it economically sustainable as possible. I would love to see where you getting the numbers that its the least profitable.
---
Yes you are right, there are a couple posts looking for steel. On Xbox where I play I see 17 posts with steel in the title. Out of thousands of posts. It‚Äôs a HUGE market!
---
well it could be any number really, but 6000 atoms, would be valued at (according to their trash model) $60 .   
---
honestly if the expectation was like 50,000 or something, then they would do nothing, and tell the player base that they paid for the privilege to play it before the free people.
---
My money is on the sinks being next.
---
I never called you unintelligent actually, I was speaking generically. I am although amused by the fact you felt called out.
---
You don't have much control over the content here on the first place. You seem very worried someone is going to accuse you of being bought out...
---
I play fallout solo. Cause people are annoying and that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve always playedü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Tesla at a nuked whitespring is a pretty decent way to test
---
I'm just being realistic. I don't think it is crazy to say your average fallout 76 player is probably an older than usual gamer compared to say Fortnite etc.
---
It is hard to get a guy in his 30s to be stoked about paying ¬£5 for a different skin on a weapon.
---
Paying for useful.items though, 100%.
---
Likewise. You don't realise what a shitty mess FO76 until you play other games.
---
You wrote a whole lot of nonsense. But to be honest: You're playing TOW and BL3, so you're someone who uses the epic game store. That makes it very clear that companies can bully you around as much as they want and you're just taking it because "ItS aBoUt ThE gAmEs LoL". Your shitty attitude of "idgaf lohl" is ruining gaming. We're going to get more unfinished shitty products, we're going to get more exclusives, we're going to get more lootboxes, we're going to get more predatory MTX, we're going to get more shitty subscriptions. And guess who's at fault: You, because you accept it and don't speak up. The Triple-A Industry is the ONLY fucking industry where companies can pull all this shit in so little time without risking going bancrupt because you people are just beyond lost. 
---
When FO76 released, I was pissed, but I was like: "Well, play the game. Why not. It's not that bad". But after Bethesda broke EVERY SINGLE ONE of their promises and sold us solutions for their shitty game design for real money, every sane person should've jumped ship to show bethesda that we do not accept that. But yeah, look where we are now. People accepted it and there is a fucking subscription service. Do you know what that means? NOTHING of the inconvenient stuff will change because they want you to sub to this shitty service.
---
You and your ignorant attitude which is completely fucking over the industry which has changed from bad to worse over the past 10 years is really pissing me off. Thanks for your contribution of ruining PC Gaming I guess?
---
And dheixbbeudnr no fkin ruh im not the only one with a valid opinion... but you prolly a Bethesda bot anywayyy ü§£
---
You mean the thing that got delayed so they could make this new cash grab idea?
---
Just stop dying so much üòÅ
---
Do you mean they have to restart worlds/services for it, unlike Meat Week?
---
I want them to apologise for being misleading and remove non-aesthetic items from behind a paywall.
---
This is a welcome to Reddit moment...
---
Nope, client can't say anything the server already knows - you will receive the same info the server already has, only validation back is that you picked it up.
---
If you use the above mentioned trick it requires lot of patience if you are doing anything more complicated than simply stacking the stairs.
---
If you want to use the trick for camp building make sure you sit your CAMP in an easily repeatable location and be careful with any floors you attach to the stairs... chances are you will have to ‚Äúmove‚Äù your camp once or twice. Because those stairs are considered ‚Äúfloating‚Äù and anything attached to them becomes essential.
---
I even preordered 76 üíÄ get outa my face bruh
---
And Bethesda bet their reputation against the idea that their playerbase was a bunch of cosmetic-driven children. Again, very much a *them* problem.
---
You're still playing this game?
---
It's Tuesday.  It's always Tuesday.
---
You try running out of a nuke zone with 90 rads per second and being spawned with only 15 hp  and Radaways being negated by the sheer amount of rads.
---
I have a main character at level 270 more or less and about 3-4 more as cap mules. Since everything sells for so much lately I‚Äôve put caps away in other characters for when I find stuff I want.
---
Also don‚Äôt forget there are something‚Äôs that don‚Äôt necessarily need to be changed at all like the door script. 
---
Same script used for doors across almost all the CK games and it *kicks tires* just works. 
---
Not saying it‚Äôs great to have technical debt but there are some carry-overs that are harmless.
---
found it, thanks!
---
Remember when bethesda paid people to cheer during E3? They would do that shamelessly.
---
Course, then you have Chile, where they've apparently burned down the buses and the Metro system in response to a fare hike (which could have also been spurred by a dislike of the government, but this is an odd thing to target).
---
Bethesda has a vested interest in this not being a thing. 
---
It's why the game was built the way it is.
---
Yes and so?
---
Well, they can always try the "HOAX! WITCHHUNT!"-tactic if this one doesn't work out, right? :D
---
It‚Äôs just you.
---
It was so cool when i first discovered that area.
---
I spent forever looking for the source of the screaming
---
Every other person wompin they dicks rn.. it‚Äôs annoying
---
Yeah it is. It's the game Fallout fans have been expecting of Fallout for years. So when it comes out, and especially during a period where Bethesda is actively shitting on their players, people are going to say something. FO76 completely deserves all the hate.
---
This would require being able to host a server. With the way legendaries work, I doubt we will ever be allowed to play with the server side.
---
Who is MMOG Fails and where do they get their info?
---
The outer worlds is so much better, it gives me chills I haven't had since Skyrim.
---
Fuck 76.
---
Whitesprings furniture store? That‚Äôs where I got my pews I‚Äôm pretty sure.
---
Tuesday...
---
I say try it out for yourself. Yes it has negative press but every game has its negative reviews. I love it and I have a blast. I‚Äôve made many friends while playing it and keep making new ones. Nuclear Winter is super fun as well. I recommend it.
---
I'm just asking because I stopped last year. Is anything new? I was planning on playing once NPCs came but of course they screwed that up. Outer Worlds and Gears 5 have taken all my time up.
---
They definately made mistakes. Rushing the release date probably halved the players who even tried it. YouTube reviewers destroyed them and the game for months after release. It made me hold off buying it.
---
You using birdshot or buckshot?
---
Yeah, we have to be amazed of the laziness, of the incompetence of Bethesda. One of the most praised studios of gaming and they lost it all in 1-2 years. Amazing.
---
Okay? You can only play the beta if you did preorder, so I don‚Äôt see what you‚Äôre trying to get at. I mean I can always say that I got the Tricentennial edition too, but that wouldn‚Äôt lead this conversation anywhere.
---
a lot has happened, and many improvements
---
Jesus, still?
---
That's a launch bug
---
The Legendary SB's evolved to fill the niche left open by our destruction of the non-legendary SB's.
---
Darwin's revenge.
---
Right,  i mean who plays this broken game anyways.
---
Have you checked the vendor inside whotesprings?? He sells the fancy items. Otherwise I don't know who sells them.
---
Private servers, not a game mode.
---
And you being apathetic to the issues is kind of the point of the frog metaphor. You allow bad things to happen because they are not considered worth caring about, then your standard shifts a bit to allow for it. Then something just a little worse happens, but it‚Äôs only a little worse so why care? And so on.
---
looks like your method was patched
---
teleported to a camp at charlestone
---
then switched server
---
teleported back to Ella Ames bunker
---
going to dolly Sods
---
Like posting whiny rants on the subreddit is going to change anything about a large corporation‚Äôs business model.
---
Not 3 SB's, that's always been there.
---
Now you can get 3 3* SB's.
---
Fun!
---
I noticed that there‚Äôs multiple arrow types in the files that might make you happy üòä
---
The word is "supposed."  Supposed to be, not suppose to be.
---
If you're not happy, leave.  You didn't marry the video game.  Y'all don't have kids together.  Just go.
---
Pretty sure Brotherhood of Steel takes place as least liked, but okay.
---
Because once you go peer to peer, you have the hackers everywhere like in GTA, spawning in shit everywhere. Only if adventure mode and private had separate saves would it be ok, so people could cheat in private all they want.
---
Isn‚Äôt it free now?
---
Other games are 100% separated from official game servers. While 76 allows you to go between private and public at will.  I can not rent a server on ark a build up an entire base, level my character and tame and level a ton of dinos and then shift all of that onto a public server at will.
---
&gt; And most that charge are not for AAA studios such as Bethesda. 
---
So you expect Bethesda to operate private servers at a loss for players? Literally no other company does that.  They have offical servers that they support and part of their income goes to paying for those offical servers. Private servers are all funded by the individuals.   
---
Wild Card did not pay for my private ark server that me and my wife rented for about a year.  And the fee was about the same [https://server.nitrado.net/eng/servicetypes/prices](https://server.nitrado.net/eng/servicetypes/prices)
---
Then how did the sub get registered before release date?
---
Wft is this? Is this some unsubstantiated fanfic-level conspiracy theory?
---
People who love talking to Robots
---
here they do it wednesday
---
What, you think the mods are going to change our minds about this? You think the mods  made this decision? Dude, for all we know the mods could dislike this too. Either way, they're being smart waiting till things blow over. I really hope they don't this time. I hope this is that metaphorical final straw.
---
How did you stack those stairs? I have not been able to do that for the life of me.
---
Unplayable?  Good Lord.  I think the sub is bad because they've lied so much and prioritized it above actual fixes, but it sure doesn't magically make it unplayable for the rest of us.
---
We can collect the same amount of loot we could before the sub.  It's OUR fault we want to pickup everything that's not nailed to the background.
---
I hardly have junk on my characters at this point but I'm still max stash because of only being able to earn 150 scrip per day.  My stash is filled with shitty legendaries.
---
So how does the sub fix something like that? It can't.
---
If you can't afford the sub, you probably need to better budget your finances and not even be looking at games.  If you just don't want to spend money because you're budgeting responsibly, awesome.  If you don't want it because you disagree with how they've handled things, good!  Hopefully they'll change (doubt it).
---
But let's not pretend it makes the game unplayable by not having it.  It's just like it was before.
---
Lol it hasn‚Äôt happened to me but I only join on close friends. I‚Äôd say ask first before joining.
---
Honest question, why not just give up your mod status?  like, wut
---
design decisions for profit.
---
I really like the metaphor that it was like being hit by ‚ÄùA shotgun blast of depression‚Äù, on it‚Äôs own
---
but in this context, with you reading about a game on the internet, it just sounds silly and ‚Äùdrama queenish‚Äù.
---
It was actually further evidence how much I was hyped for a new Bethesda fallout. And still your arguments are invalid. They ignore the community and are using fallout 1st as a cash grab like items in the atom shop ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It‚Äôs pretty great how even if your doing slap damage at a distance you can stagger most enemies and cripple them with enforcer

Aren't patch times aligned to whole hours?

You are doing it wrong xD
---
Noon eastern
---
Christ man, you like, have a problem or something. Like you *need* to have validation, and the only way you can get that is by poorly replying to a single comment four different times.
---
underappreciated post right there.
---
Probably, but I spent my first ten hours on private servers rebuilding my little town I moved
---
It‚Äôs a joy you really have to experience
---
Well updates go live around Noon. Depending on which time zone you're in!
---
&gt;Your motives are clear.  
---
I know you're only playing dumb for the sake or arguing. You want me to define what "unfinished" means? Did you just find out about Fallout 76 a minute ago? Here's a video. Take a look and see for yourself. If you think the game looks finished then ok, discussion over. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZM18ZK9mOY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZM18ZK9mOY)

I'm not gonna answer questions about my reddit account because 1) it's none of your business, 2) it's irrelevant to the topic of the conversation.

---
I'd say in the current setup, the TENT is the main community benefit.  Nothing stops you from just plopping down the TENT.  I've noticed players doing that during Scorchbeast Queen battles, and it's pretty convenient for anyone who wants to swap out their weapons or quickly stash the heavy loot the event generates, so you can get back to Watoga Station or wherever.
---
I know Grahm can sell them - I got mine from him. But m sure I've seen them elsewhere. Maybe try free states or Watoga train station vendor?
---
Wtf are you talking about? Glitches and add one are a normal thing cuz your are 50? Wtf game had add-ons in 1969???

---
Totally. All those stored crops helped them kill the SQB in one shot. It's crazy what they let Bethesda get away with.
---
I‚Äôve played the game for over 600 hours. I don‚Äôt need to watch some click bait YouTube video. I am well aware of the state of the game. 
---
And it is relevant. You have no idea what you are talking about lol.
---
You do realize the point of these posts is tk be vocal to maybe just maybe knock sense into Bethesda.  I guess a better plan is what your doing? Bend over and take the raw abuse and then thank him for thenoppurtunity to be abused
---
well its obvious that they have little to no respect for their player base so probably, they'll probably charge us for it too
---
dude go play outer world its more fun.
---
Imagine being this dramatic.
---
Nope. I‚Äôm not taking any abuse. I subbed and I absolutely love it.
---
I'm glad you posted this. I have noticed at least three brand new (post patch) reddit accounts in the last few days, who have posted solely on how great Fallout First PaytoWin is.
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals to avoid all the bs.
---
Alpine River Cabins?  That's been a thing from day one.  There's a story to it, if you look around.
---
Now, Haven Church on the other hand... ü¶á
---
Ha! That‚Äôs awesome!
---
Ive noticed this for the longest time but didnt know how to describe it. Tribalism is the perfect way to put it
---
It went away but made a return.
---
No, they‚Äôre really not invalid. The point of games for a company is to make money. Obviously the atomic shop wasn‚Äôt getting Bethesda the money they need. As in, the money to develop future DLC, such as Wastelanders which needs more money put into it now because it got pushed back, so it‚Äôd be less buggy than if it was released next month. Bethesda isn‚Äôt here for the community. They‚Äôre here for money, just like every other for-profit organization.
---
I don't think they'll change the spawning in the blast zone. The boss is meant to be fought inside it. You're meant to wear a hazmet or power armour. 
---
I know no one fights the boss in the blast zone but if you fought it in there people would complain how they respawn outside the zone
---
Probably around 12pm EST, unless there is maintenance to implement it
---
Destiny 2, Call of duty, Anthem, any sports game... They are still around and far from being dead (granted Anthem is probably the weakest of all of the above)
---
Truth is not that many people will actually boycott. Just look at the sales of the new Pokemon game when it will release and you will see that it's gonna be a best seller on switch regardless of all the controversy around Gamefreak.
---
I don't think those hate comments were directed at you in any personal way, people were mostly upset at the situation and I think none of us wanted bethesda (zenimax..) to get any money from this crooked service, I guess most players hoped everyone would stay out of it for solidarity and making a joint statement.
---
It IS a Bethesda problem. But when their choices are either let the game die, or find a way to make money off it, of course they‚Äôre going to try the latter. And that‚Äôs good for those of us who want to keep playing. It just sucks some of the ways HOW they‚Äôre trying to monetize it. But they have to try something, they just chose the wrong things in many of our eyes.
---
r/Market76 isn't very fond of the hysteria.
---
Man I have so much respect for you right now.  Keep up the good fight.
---
Idk man you come off as a paid shill. The big giveaway is you're saying things I dont agree with.
---
Bethesda are just using the exchange rate as an excuse to profiteer off non-US nations. The difference doesn't even account for fluctuations in exchange rates as they would have to be heavily against the US' favour before they get close to losing money.
---
Of course if you venture near Grafton he‚Äôll reawaken but it‚Äôs actually been quiet since the patch drop and I‚Äôve bounced between a lot of servers
---
Yikes, but okay.
---
What I want to know is where did all the griefers go?  As someone that likes to PvP I‚Äôve not had one incident in the last week of someone wanting to mix it up.
---
&gt; And that‚Äôs good for those of us who want to keep playing.
---
Except it isn't. Far better to move on to a game that doesn't have a failing business model that needs injections of more and more 'cash-for-content' phases to keep the lights on.
---
I paid money for the game al-fuckin-ready bro.  And how are they not valid when it‚Äôs the same complaints as everyone‚Äôs else?? Bro you‚Äôre invalidü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and if they aren‚Äôt here for the community then they have nothingü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Id be fine if they decided to remove the invis altogether. I and many others dont you stealth boys for the invis but for the vats protection. Atm stealth boys are the only vats counter for pvp
---
We need a lightly modified non-copyrighted thriller dance so bad now. Lol
---
Outer Worlds is amazing, 100000x better than Fallout 76
---
that is definitley the truth.. I seem to be have more DC's from the public than the private at this point, but thats just not right. they should be just as stable as one another. And they need to have more than a 60 second halflife..
---
Also moved camps multiple time‚Äôs in this period
---
I‚Äôd mess you up man you prolly sit on your ass all day and play fallout. You tryna get person and that‚Äôll get you hurt ..
---
You ran vault 94 and got the pa?
---
You are a list.
---
 A fellow frustrated builder :) yeah that is the worst part of the trick and accidentally adding a stairway or floor piece only to realize you can‚Äôt remove them had me pulling my hair out a few times. It‚Äôs all about planning before building. I also discovered recently that you can fully enclose stacked stairways in walls but you have to place the walls before stacking the next set of stairs. For awhile all of my stacks had this same skeletal look so I use this workaround for ‚Äúhome‚Äù camps now.
---
I mean personally I would prefer if upon respawning they gave you maybe a temporary rad immunity so that as soon as you move you aren't overwhelmed and ik that you're supposed to wear a hazmat but hazmat only offers rad protection and for builds that are specced for non pa combat, it's not really an option. Like I dont want to compromise my full set of mutant/unyielding BOS combat armour because I spawn in the zone only for me to swap to a hazmat suit and be completely vulnerable till I'm back to the fight and find somewhere to get back into my armour pieces fast enough before the queen or her minions slash me to bits.
---
I'm the one who's having a conversation with you. No one else is having a conversation with you. I'm the person who called you out on your "half the subreddit" claim. Your response - to me - was that it requires a superior intellect to grasp that you were using hyperbole, and that you didn't literally mean half the subreddit. So you were clearly implying that I'm unintelligent. Again, no one else was having a conversation with you except for me.
---
Apparently you inserted yourself in the circle as well.
---
It increases each time you die, maxing out at 20.  You have to die quite a few times for it to get to 20.
---
Just be patient.  Pretty soon, they'll start showing up as "screen fillers" during those long waits to load the game or land after a Nukashine binge.
---
Damage is capped at 110 damage per shot, so bloody mess is unnecessary.
---
Eh fair
---
I‚Äôm going to get through the Halloween event and then make the switch over to Outer Worlds.  I need to first figure out how to get my dozen god tier weapons sold first so if interested look me up on PS4.
---
Platform?
---
Yeah because this accusation is never proven to be reality anywhere else, especially not I‚Äôm gaming. And mods or admin are never found to be complicit, either. Honestly you‚Äôre best bet was just to say nothing. Even if you‚Äôre not outright lying, just because you mod the sub doesn‚Äôt mean you know if PR teams are posting here or not. You‚Äôd never know with certainty just based off subreddit accessible data.
---
i don't see what the big hoopala is all about. there is no clear advantage with it, unless my perception of it is much different from those whom are complaining about it. i have played on the private servers only because my friends bought the subscription, i have no intentions of buying it.
---
the 1600+ Atoms you get monthly is worth more than what you pay alone. but i just make that when i am grinding the game
---
the unlimited junk stash is the only thing that caught my attention, but lets be honest there really is no advantage there... sure your junk stash gives the ability to create ammo and fix weapons and armor... but all that is only as good as the weight capacity of your character which in battle or exploring is all that matters. i personally have the strong back perk maxed out, and have all level 45 excavator armor pieces plus the mods for extra weight capacity plus the perks for weight reduction with ammo, food and water and i seem to be doing fine. 
---
as for the tent.... i seen my friends and its really cool looking, but again no advantage, you just save yourself a handful of caps.
---
that's my 2 cents on the whole thing
---
Xbox
---
With all the bugs? Don‚Äôt even wanna try. Vaults are fun but can only do so much solo currently .
---
They own the game, they do whatever they want with it, regardless of the fact you find it right or wrong. 
---
If you like the product buy it, if not don't. Vote with your wallet rather than whiny reddit posts.
---
You'd have to reverse engineer the server code. That takes a LONG time to get right.
---
Beyond that, Bethesda would shut down those servers to protect their IP and trademark.
---
Guessing to have a discussion about a game he/she paid money for.  Why are you acting all pissy?
---
Fruitless hoping, mostly.
---
I keep expecting bethesda to make like 1 good move, but then disappointed each time.
---
Once that one good move comes, tho, I'll prob smile a bit before continuing to not play, really.
---
It's been a pretty long road for a lot of us who still lurk lol.
---
Quit and uninstalled a week ago, was one of this game's top supporters but enough is enough
---
Private servers are a game mode.  Play with people or play by yourself. Different modes to the same game.
---
&gt; And you being apathetic to the issues is kind of the point of the frog  metaphor. You allow bad things to happen because they are not considered  worth caring about, then your standard shifts a bit to allow for it.  Then something just a little worse happens, but it‚Äôs only a little worse  so why care? And so on. 
---
1. No other company gives private servers away for free.
---
2. You could make an argument that PC players could host their own servers with a beefy enough PC. But console players would still have to pay it.
---
3. The ability to shift between private and public at will with all progress carrying over never happens with any other official vs unofficial server in any game.  Because of that capability is why I don't mind them also asking PC players to pay up for the servers.
---
4. The price for what you charge is worth it. $100 a year is the average price for server rentals.   [https://server.nitrado.net/eng/servicetypes/prices](https://server.nitrado.net/eng/servicetypes/prices) is the website I used to rent one for Ark. It had the best quality and price and was highly recommended. And if you look an 8 person slot is $101.40
---
You really must be silly sausage if you don't think Bethesda doesn't hire public relations people to try and control the reactions, they're poured dollars and dollars into this game. Its only logical for them to get people to post and change the narrative. I don't think they expected this level of backlash, which is why it's completely failed.
---
I think OP is complaining about people using this sub as a way of slamming the door on the way out.  Which I can understand, but I don't agree that it should be banned.
---
People who have no problem with the direction the game is taking don't want to hear how others feel, just like people who hate the way things are now don't want to hear other's rose colored view of things.  They both have perfectly valid opinions, and neither should be silenced (IMO).
---
I have an opinion leaning very much in one of those two directions, but I don't think it's a good idea to limit the sub to any one side's opinion of the situation.  We don't need an echo chamber, we need frank and honest discussions.  I know the 'this sucks, I'm leaving' posts are getting old, but we need to know that it's happening.
---
Every morning when I play, I almost always get DC'd at EXACTLY 8 AM EST.
---
So firstly, I work in the oilfields five to seven days a week, so I‚Äôd hardly count that as sitting all day. 
---
And second, r/iamverybadass will love you.
---
90/sec?  High capacity bag?  Cause I don't take anywhere near that much unless I'm wearing one (it can drive rad resist negative which increases rad damage taken)
---
I‚Äôll be up to mischief 
---
Bring your PvP big boy pants it‚Äôs on
---
Check some of his other posts. He is a VG leaker of sorts. Leaked the BioWare management hell story before Kotaku, etc.
---
You‚Äôre getting personal? I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be loved too.
---
My characters original build was meant to be a gunslinger and he was going to use the SAA in the game... little did I know how terrible the pistols where long term, and how little you could actually do to the SAA to make it better.  He‚Äôs now a Rifleman and I‚Äôm starting to dip my toes into Commando since I got a bloodied explosive 10mm SMG that even without perks does half the damage of my rifle. 
---
Shotguns and pistols need some buffs and we also need some more variety with them. The .45 auto pistol from NV and something like the lever action shotgun would be a good start.
---
Or... You know, do some research on who he is, and see how many times he was right.
---
Looks too easy, how is it on supernova difficulty?
---
Nope. Something like that would have been announced by Bethesda and talked about by the community: if you can't find any posts on it or any mention by Bethesda then you're not missing anything /s
---
The Fallout 1%
---
I also paid out the gate pre-beta for the high dollar amount (I don't remember exactly how much it was at that time). I am also annoyed that Beth seems to use interns as programmers given the bugs and breakage. At the end of the day, however, I enjoy the game even with all of the bugs, screw ups, crashes etc. Maybe I'm just a masochist, maybe I'm just so in to the Fallout universe that Beth could package a Fallout flavored turd and I'd not be too distressed. It is what it is. I love both 4 and 76.
---
Haha! I love it!
---
Does MHW count? It‚Äôs dope af.
---
I would have payed $100 a year for what he's describing.  I wouldn't even pay $13 a year for Fallout 1st.  If there are sufficient players or ex-players like myself, the added value of repairing their reputation and seeing their game become something fans love might be enough to call it profitable.  
---
Especially if you factor in how having Fallout 76 become a great game might salvage some of the loss-of-sales on future games that they are going to suffer because people are too leery of Bethesda after the player-milking, bug-ridden, PR train wreck of a dumpster fire that Fallout 76 has been.
---
I‚Äôm just telling you that you‚Äôre wrong. Now, do you have anything further to add to your original argument, or you still gonna pretend that this is Xbox Live in 2009?
---
7 days in an oil field with over 700 hours in game? Bro you‚Äôre lying is overlapping itself now..
---
He didnt have em!
---
GTA is more pay to play...there is nothing you can't aquire locked behind a paywall that you can't get by grinding...shark cards just lessen the grind for people who don't have the time...
---
You don't need to \*play\* anything to know how a business works. Blow chunks, Bethesda shill.
---
I don't know how anyone has such a low standard for games that they consider this good, the gameplay is clunky and boring
---
Potentially some are I'm sure. Damage control typically needs paid shills though to keep the face of the brand intact. I like outer worlds, sure, but I'm not posting here saying to go buy that game. I never bought it myself because I refuse to buy from EGS, nor do I have windows 10. So your passive aggressiveness really doesn't matter
---
You're nice and brave! I found it at about level six, and I booked it right out of there. Didn't go back for so many levels...
---
Little lies, stunning shows
---
a cosmetic skin for your power armor with autoturrets that 'conveniently' mow down any enemy in your path
---
Really Bethesda? You have learned absolutely nothing? And here I thought you were one of the good companies but no your litteraly one of the worst type of companies ever
---
Thanks for the info
---
Which makes it even more sad.
---
That was an anti cheat measure wasn't it?
---
I‚Äôm wrong yet more people agree with me and I‚Äôve shown you? Ok. Keep being blind and ignoring the truth ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è where is your evidence? It‚Äôs simple facts they can make the game better and aren‚Äôt shut up.
---
Don‚Äôt get it. My biggest issue with it right now is that there is just nothing to do at all. If you like walking around in a new fallout world and reading terminals then it might be worth $20 bucks to you but I doubt it. I‚Äôm level like 80 something and I‚Äôve done everything in the game multiple times and I see people level 300. I have no idea how they keep from being bored to be honest. The people who still play pretty much just base build and do the same events over and over grinding for a .001% chance of the exact weapons/ armor they want. Legendary enemies still don‚Äôt even drop legendary gear 100% of the time lol
---
It‚Äôs a completely different game. 
---
This is a multiplayer, survival-esque open world with RPG elements
---
TOW is an RPG that is mostly linear 
---
they are completely different experiences
---
Arc is an indie developer.  Do you have a AAA devoloper? And what im suggesting is program it to be p2p. Not on a live server. Your brain can conceptualize that right?
---
Haha were there animations for a fully crippled squirrel? That'd be funny as fuck
---
Whatever.  This conspiracy theory was tired and old 6 months ago and it is tired and old today.  Some people just like the game.  Some people don't mind the subscription.  
---
The reasons the positive posts are becoming prominent again are twofold, I believe.  First, most people burn out their rage very quickly before turning their attention to something else.  Secondly, the initial posts garnered a lot of attention and some of them ended up on the front page of Reddit.  This brought in the haters who never post on this sub, many of whom admittedly have never even played the game, but who always show up to upvote anything negative when it gets that much attention.  Those folks are gone now, so the posts critical of FO76 aren't getting the upvotes from them either.
---
Kill modding? No. Just exclusively monetise it. Bethesda finally gets their wish after 2 failed attempts - pretty much zero competition from the community community.
---
Well, anything server side at least. PC client side stuff would probably still be around in some capacity.
---
Are you off your meds again?
---
I gave you a video link and that's all you're going to get from me. If you won't even look at it then why should I waste my time arguing with you. I know exactly what you're doing and I'm not falling for it. Like I said in my previous post - you know what *unfinished* means in this context unless you've been living under a rock for the last year. I recognize your username, so I know you've been hanging out on this subreddit for a long time. People have discussed the state of the game so many times, it's impossible for you to have missed it. Like I said, you're playing dumb and it's obvious.
---
Ah that explains it, and that other guy probably reaches 20 second respawn constantly since he has bloodied melee, pretty easy to die with that combination.
---
Lol nope. Legacies don't seem to care about DR/ER for whatever reason.
---
probably just the normal spawns, the wording makes it sound like the robots will be the major "problem" for us to deal with
---
Ditto
---
I‚Äôd rather https://youtu.be/3T6QCHWi7GQ

outta curiosity, was this on Xbox the other day? i'm on there and while i was exploring the cliffs near the Satellite Array, i looked over towards the Bog and seen the Rad-Storm, from the cliff view it was really cool. Had that rain cloud look only it was obviously green
---
" and I'm finally able to enjoy events like Uranium Fever and Sons of Dane since they became Public events. "    
---
I feel like they do stuff like this on purpose. I've been called a conspiracy theorist for saying things like this before but if their shoddy new system isn't forcing people to quit, but to pay them more money to play on a server alone then either a) they have no incentive to fix it or even worse b) they are doing shit like this on purpose with the foresight that private servers were coming         
---
It always seems like they add something to the game or take something away one patch and then next patch just add in something to counter it. I genuinely think they added in ballistic bock and high voltage hefe into to game as a way to try and push more repair kits, and hunger and thirst seems way heavier lately and now theres a fridge          
---
But I've been told major corporations would never scheme in this way many times before.....
---
Use a subscription service is not even close to pirating, scamming, or "not paying" for the game.
---
The Game Pass is like Netflix. Just because I watch a movie through Netflix doesn't mean I "pirated" it or "didn't pay for it". It's to get the most out of your money spent.
---
Make sure you grab your ankles to.  
---
Also fyi your contributing to a MASSIVE fanbase losing out on their favorite IP.  The reason so many people who dont pkay the game (me thought I used to and enjoyed the gameplay in somenregards) come to show our anger is our hope that we can change Bethesda for future titles so we can truly enjoy an amazing IP thags built with care and attention tk detail and artistic talent.  What your seeing is the last cry of dedicated fans losing their favorite IPs and games that defined much of their enjoyments growing up.  
---
But please accept your corporate cash grab feed your addiction and fuck over all the fans by giving berhwada your money.  It's your money spend it how you will but at least recognize your contribution.
---
You would have to pay me to play this game
---
So I'm someone who is unhappy with a lot of things.  But I'm happy with plenty too.
---
You people need to stop acting like there's no in-between.  There IS.  And we can try to enjoy what we have while trying to voice our concerns in hopes we make a difference.
---
If you are completely unhappy, stop playing and go make more useful posts on their forums and submit feedback. 
---
Grow up, it's not all or nothing.
---
I'm not the one presenting this as "evidence". The onus is on you to prove the validity and credibility of the "evidence" you're presenting.
---
If my passive aggressiveness didnt matter to you, you wouldnt of typed all that out. Nice try obsidian.
---
Regular capacity backpack, I use it to carry around the legendaries I farm to sell them for scrip or at my camp which I turned into a trading post/hotel. I had solar powered on which should have negated it slightly, same with ghoulish. I didn't have rad worms either so I didn't have anything effecting my rads negatively. I woulda used Rad X but it would have made me a burden on the fight since my build relies on mutations for extra damage, agility and versatility. Suppressing it means losing marsupial, speed demon, adrenal reaction, electrically charged, healing factor and a shit ton of others I got from hours of farming at the disposal ground
---
It probably wouldn't be too hard to create a client side server extension for PCs, I won't even pretend to know how difficult it would be to do for the two consoles or what kind of restrictions the console manufacturers put on that kind of stuff
---
My outrage has little to do with FO 1st or pay to play.  It‚Äôs all about them catering to the non PvP crowd and system performance.  The constant nerfs.  Eliminating survival.  Glitches and disconnects all over the place. 
---
So someone pays for a uniform or stash boxes or a fridge.  Who gives a shit?  But the game experience itself has not improved.  It‚Äôs turned into a collector and builder driven game.  Fucking Fallout SIMS.
---
People buy
---
The happy is the same from the start til now. I‚Äôm bored. Growing up is what Bethesda needs to do... I have stop playing. And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here submitting feedback??? I‚Äôm doing it multiple places it‚Äôll only increase my chances of them listening. üôèüèº thanks tho
---
I believe you are breaking Rule #1 how do I know you are talking about Fo76?
---
I figured.thr down votes were from inflammatory comment, and posted incorrect price.  Both are typically valid reasons for downvotes.
---
yeah ESO has a justified reason for that subscription, considering all the maps it has which are all around the size of 76's one map and all have their own activities....ESO probably has around 8-9 times the content of 76
---
and even if not considering the subscription stuff ESO has a way for normal players to increase their storage space with ingame currency
---
I did say 5-7, and I do get time off. 5-7 days means that I do get weekends still, and I do have time to relax and enjoy myself when I‚Äôm not at work. Keep reaching, bud.
---
Yeah I played GTAO on PC for years. I've had ferris wheels in my apartment, cages in my businesses to block being able to move (keep in mind that's an *actual* instanced apartment and business that nobody else can access without me inviting them), space ships shooting up everybody, giant robots made of tanks, everybody exploding every 5 seconds... Yeah peer to peer isn't the wonderful thing it sounds like.
---
You do realize what fallout 1st is a start. Its not a one and done thing. Private servers are going to be so much more they just need time to develop them etc. Now some people are afraid of that because there will be similar quality of life things behind the pay wall. Im ok with it even though I didnt sign up to it because i Know it would put the game into a more stable finiancial footing so it can continue to exist.
---
Look what you posted.  That's not feedback.  You know what companies want?  Constructive feedback.
---
Not dumb rants.
---
I wouldn't pay each month for other people's benefits.
---
Gag glasses, indeed.
---
It started off as 20 for me and stayed at 20 throughout the entire event. My first death was a combination of the queens white mist and the scorched mirelurk hatchlings poison and I had to wait 20 seconds just to get respawned at the fissure site prime and die almost instantly. The few times I was able to speed demon it out I would end up getting one hit by almost anytjimv due to solar powered being too slow to take effect and being out of Radaways since I had used them up on all the other times I failed attempting to escape the blast zone
---
I'm not are of any server based games with free private instances.  Only seen peer to peer games do that.
---
Nop, it was yesterday on PC.
---
Thats not a game mode, that‚Äôs just playing on a different server and controlling who comes in. You still play on the same mode. Playing with one friend isn‚Äôt a different mode to playing with a stranger.
---
That and people had been asking to host their own servers for a long time
---
Level 62 shotgunner, and I have never wanted to pick up anything else. My only issues are mirelurk queens. I need something with more armor penetration, and maybe some poison resistance in my armor. Then I should be JUST fine.
---
Are those daily player numbers? Maybe you don‚Äôt know. Just curious.
---
You are today's winner.
---
It‚Äôs not my first time, they‚Äôre more constructed elsewhere, I know reddit isn‚Äôt worth the time too much trust me. Just slap my comment on and watch people get mad ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.. this ain‚Äôt my first rodeo man I know . Thank you tho for the constructive criticism
---
Yes you can
---
Usually the exact opposite happens to me, after respawning theres a few moments before i even start taking rads. Idk could be due to load times being pretty fast.
---
it still works just like before
---
Oh, so you have no friends except online. Ok bud. Get a life bruh
---
Your hold is getting deeper in that oil field

Seems like we're both getting paid here then. Good stuff.

The only issue with epic is it has buttfuck all features, besides ingame messaging being tied to the launcher (which is cool). Other than that most of the hate is fucking uninspired and regurgitated from the latest "Epic is ANTI-CONSUMER??" click bait youtube video.

Cancelling it just so you can play a $60 title for $1 is crap.

LOL just met a guy a couple days ago, lvl 49 who still won't go! It's actually really fun, and great to casually "happen upon" when you're with someone else who's clueless about it :)
---
No you can learn mods from scrapping guns you made (unless they recently introduced a bug there).
---
There appears to be a lot of possible mods for that weapon, so unless you've already learned them all, there should at least be a chance to learn new mods by scrapping.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Laser_gun_(Fallout_76)
---
Once you've learned a lot of them, it will take a while to learn new mods, at least that's been my experience.  The last few take quite a lot of scrapping to learn.
---
Tin foil is bad for the hair
---
How about playing both like i do.
---
Lol 100% truth
---
Might be but even still, before I've started moving the rads are packing on fast and at this point I'll either die and repeat the cycle or escape with such a miniscule amount of hp that even a radchicken could survive more hits than me
---
Report it. The mods said it themselves that they only ever step in if there are reports made. Otherwise, nothing is going to get done.

bro thats a really dumb question
---
I dont think so, the only way to unlock it is the puoneer quest right? If not can you enlighten me please
---
I'm not getting back on until Wastelanders comes out. That's the one thing I was looking forward to, not some "pay to play on your own private server shit." Maybe if I could use mods on said private server, I would be willing to give it a shot, but not until then.
---
Yeah, thats what happened.  Game is still too expensive for me to buy into something broken and filled with hackers
---
There's a story for that i think.  Prolly just an alternate universe or something
---
I agree, but at this point. most of these are just spewing out shit, and and attacking people who dont have the same view. and god forbid if they bought the fallout 1st.
---
EGGcellent
---
dont think you got the point of the post
---
Yeah, are you on console or pc and if on pc, do you have the game installed on ssd or hdd? Trying to figure out of it's caused by load times or not.
---
I'm actually on my way to the bank. Before I go I just have to say the outer worlds is a meh game that ONLY shines story wise.
---
You said - and I quote - "Bethesda has nothing to do with the subs. People just still like the game." but that's not true at all. They literally have tagged employees who post on this sub...
---
Any actual consumer genuinely ok with Fallout 1st is a complete fucking idiot and there are absolutely zero exceptions
---
It's already been like a week since it was announced, I'm so fucking glad these annoying complaint posts are dying down. I welcome the PR team.
---
Lol, what? Exclusives are a thing in pretty much every industry that's customerbase are average people. Like, oh no, I can't buy Great Value products at fucking GameStop, it's so predatory! Oh no, I can't buy a special edition of a book at Walmart! Some bedding, a Bed Bath and Beyond exclusive! They're killing the bedsheets industry!
---
Tbh I never really took workshops before so the private server is totally worthless to me. To add to that the game doesn‚Äôt feel as good without other players. It plays better of course, but just the random short interactions with other humans are part of what made the game for me.
---
Definitely won‚Äôt be a long term subscriber unless they make it a dedicated persistent server so I can really set up my workshops to farm
---
Minecraft 30USD. Servers with your own rules are free, use your own hardware. Realms are 8 bucks a month if you cant rock the hardware.
---
The private server doesnt have to be free. It has to work for that price. I'm down splitting the price with my mates on a game we like if it doesnt fuck me.
---
I haven't played it, but from what I've seen it's cool. I'm feel like it's a bit overhyped buuut it seems like 7-8/10 if you're into that type of stuff.
---
Xbox on HDD not an external SSD. It's probably load times but there's nothing I can do about that  besides make myself vulrable to attacks at the cost of not dying on spawning or negating my perk build by using power armour or radx which will just negatively effect me.
---
If I no longer play a game I don‚Äôt troll their reddit page to complain about things that no longer affect me.
---
Reported for spam
---
"but...but...you can find this weapon somewhere in the game too....by fighting three SBQ's in a clown costume with a flare gun while drunk and having another player in the rare asylum uniform spam emotes next to you while reviving an ally"
---
Not trying to poop on Bethesda but, they keep screwing up they keep lying to the community and they keep doing bad business tactics to get more money.
---
I don‚Äôt click on random YouTube links. Thanks for the deflection again. I hope you enjoyed your trolling. Have a good day.
---
On a related note, does life saving armor stack? In other words, does having two pieces of those equipped give 100% chance of being automatically revived when downed, or 75% (multiplicative stacking), or it just remains 50%?
---
Like toxic water for bloodied builds or something?
---
Oh OP will without a doubt...
---
I would hate to have the subscription affect % chance at legendaries.
---
I don't think so, I've noticed a landmine duplication glitch as well and they may be combining the exploits toghether.
---
When I did go back, I dragged my husband's melee character out with me for back up. Once he realized where we were, he started laughing... and then told me nothing. He was literally there as a bodyguard, he told me, and that was all he was going to do. Except drawing my attention to the spinning pictures on the wall, of course.
---
ü§°
---
Exaaaactly
---
Since things like faschnacht and meatweek were designed so lower levels can particpate/succeed, I would venture any potential spawns durig mischief night are going to be lower level as well.
---
  It also would not surprise me if someone (tries) to nuke the event, as happened with fashnacht.
---
Built my first melee is fallout4.  So OP,  2 hits on deathclaws.
---
You really have a refreshing unique perspective that we should all take time to consider and acknowledge. Naahhhhhht.
---
Yong Yea acts like he's angry. He's an entertainer . He actually knows very little about the game. I've heard him and Jim Sterling, both claim conjecture as fact , multiple times. They don't play this game and never really have. Most that tear it down on YouTube play very little. And do so for views, it's a job. Sort of like making video games .
---
I noticed a duplication trick using landmines in the purveyor like a week ago, they could be using that.
---
Are you fallout first? Seconds you can't complain.
---
/sarcasm off
---
Hey my name is chase too, but idrcü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£
---
Heh, it's really hard to take you seriously. I am sure you know all about the business and those awful games you don't play and life overall.
---
This must be one of the silliest things I have encounter in this or any sub. Got to love the internet.
---
I‚Äôm sure, but the problem with anthem was a lack of oversight, BioWare, despite developing the game for years, had no idea what game they were making due until the demo at e3, and that demo was a quick short they strung together for the boss to not get canned and or fired. So despite being given years to make it, the game had a total of 8 or so months to be made. Which is impressive mind you that they got what they did, but still I cannot blame ea for this one. Won‚Äôt stop me from blaming them for every other game they touched but still
---
They don't give a shit about in game economy. Private worlds was the final coffin, no one buys ammo/bulk/magazine&amp;bhead anymore
---
Lol. I am betting you called it.
---
Judging from your playthrough, it looks like you got considerable mileage from the the first year.  
---
Now if you think you're in entitled to new content for free, then by all means have that mindset. I can ensure you we dont live in that world. Companies have never cared about giving away their work for free unless it gave them a tax break or some incentive. 
---
This game isnt broken, it does have hiccups, but it's by far not unplayable.
---
I‚Äôm not wrong that‚Äôs the thing 
---
I don‚Äôt know why everyone getting butthurt
---
Wait hold up. You havent played it but in your first reply you talk about how good it is and how it's the fallout game fans have been waiting for. Lmao, I'm playing it and it's not as good as people are hyping. If Bethesda made outer worlds people would be shitting all over it. People would be screaming from the mountain tops about how tiny the maps are, how short the game is, how shallow the gear and abilities system are. It's a 6 out of 10, not bad, not amazing it just ok. Anyway I really need to go cash this Bethesda check.
---
Man you have more will then me. WhennI couldn't group up with my friends half the time, even a month after release, that was the line for me. It felt terrible because I literally wanted to play support, my character was built around charisma and then when I could never get any of my perks to work because - again- I could not join up with me friends...
---
Man feels bad
---
It dose when you spend it on whale food you fucking whale.
---
&gt;!Nice!!&lt;
---
While you're putting in your application to Bethesda HR, you can drop mine into the office while you're there. Lol.
---
Well did you buy it?
---
Axe sackly!
---
I think is too soon.
---
This game is a giant middle finger to all gamers for so many reasons and anyone who still plays is a fucking moron and the lowest form of gamer next to mobile p2w.
---
Woah that was cool
---
Didn't that literally release this week? Give it time.
---
I LOVE YOU MAN!
---
Yea any throwable can be duped. Quills, knifes, tomahawks, cleavers and mines. The dupe has been around for a long time but has recently went mainstream. This was the reason for removing the bottlecap mine
---
It was never 200.
---
I think you could be a little more melodramatic, but it's going to take a bit of work.
---
No, that definitely feels right
---
To sum it up, I agree we could use more money sinks.  Players should not be making purchases by jumping around between multiple characters who are all at the cap limit to make purchases form each other.  
---
I do fear however, that giving that way to purchase Scrip would also require a rebalance to the quality, otherwise some of these players are going to dump a bunch of caps and Flood the market with more quality items (Thought that in theory should drive prices down with a higher supply)
---
I agree that more premium outfits (or other items, in particular CAMP items) would be nice.  I know I would go out of my way to get some premium plans for CAMP that don‚Äôt drop as a reward
---
Why would that be surprising, do you think no new players ever come into this game? 
---
The positive posts we're seeing are exactly the type of posts we saw before the bullcrap sub, they happened throughout the year. Why are some of you so gd paranoid? xD
---
People like the game. To me it's annoying that all you troll follow this sub that have nothing to do with the game. I wish we they could ban you people.
---
Bitch i know
---
I'm not doing it anymore since 90% of the times I get nothing to loot.
---
Riley üòÇ
---
I don't care what feels right to you. It was 400 at launch, upped to 600 after a while and then again to 800.
---
well im looking forward to it! its something new to do, and possibility of free stuffs, what is not to like?
---
*"It's not the best choice, it's Spacer's Choice."*
---
Ohhh okay. See I knew they increased it twice. Thanks for clarifying
---
TIL Fallout 76‚Äôs entire Online experience *isn‚Äôt* a monetized grind. Huh
---
They didn't retcon the Brotherhood. They added new lore. They didn't change anything existing. Huge difference.
---
Well what exactly would they be able to say that would make you guys happy? Genuinely I want to know what they could say without adding fuel to the fire
---
Say what you will in the last few years ove seen the death of star wars, Harry Potter, fallout, elder scrolls, terminator, ghost busters, marvel, marvel comics, DC, dc comics the list goes on and on.  My favorite entertainment mediums and IPs are dying sk ya jt makes me quite upset forgive me
---
By these numbers, it would be a great value to purchase all the wonderful mini-DLCs available on the Atomic Shop.  Personally, I just can‚Äôt get enough of it.  It‚Äôs a passion of mine really.  I get every offering the day it‚Äôs released.  And since I play the game 18 hours per day my cost per hour of entertainment is less than $.03!!!  I might be a bit, um, one dimensional.  BUT THAT‚ÄôS OK!  Because Bethesda Softworks in combination with Zenimax Media is the one two punch that just works!
---
LOL I did this with my daughter, she immediately found the answers, no fear. No fun for me.
---
meat hook WAS the best melee in the game until last patch
---
That won't happen until Spring.
---
Inght imma head out.
---
well shit
---
Now that's pretty damn funny, I'll admit. :p
---
I get that a lot when using VATS. Also, more often now, im seeing enemies that are frozen and can take all the ammo you got.  overall, the public servers have more latency...cant comment on private servers, but have heard they are really smooth. kinda sux..
---
Do you expected something honest from Bethesda at this point where they became Activision?
---
Becayse GTA5 literally just sold in game money for real money. They had a good source of income already.
---
Buying scrip would be limited to 50/day, preventing the issue of buying 1000 scrip at a time to flood the market :)
---
I recommend having Graham sell them, "Graham and Chally make deal with Mur.. Mor.. Mphh... Mole lady."
---
It's worth noting that the lunchboxes have broken more and more over the past few updates to Fallout 76. So, it's likely that Bethesda isn't working on them anymore. With that in mind, however, we should always consider ***the possibility*** that they'll return to them now that they're starting to slowly move away from cosmetic-only purchases in the Atomic Shop.
---
Also, I think the vast majority of this community disagrees with the notion that lootboxes should be added, if the backlash to Fallout 1st is any indication.
---
Their air jordan strikes always kill me
---
The point is that outer worlds has not done ANY of the shady stuff that is deemed normal in the industry. No special edition, no season pass, no microtransactions and hardly any bugs to be seen. Outer worlds is very hyped, i admit that, but they have shown that bethesda saying bugs happen with games that big or microtransaction are needed because developong games costs too much is complete bullshit. 
---
It has shown that Bethesda is full of shit, and it is oke for us to expect better.
---
The only person here who's trolling is you. You know very well what unfinished means. You may not *personally* agree that the game *is* unfinished, but you know damn well what I and thousands of other players are referring to when we use the word. And if you don't know - let's pretend that you honestly don't know - then I have answered your question by providing you with a link to 20 minute video that shows off all the bugs in the game, but you refuse to click it. In that case there's nothing more I can do for you.
---
yeah that's also why we are probably never going to see dedicated player-hosted servers that one could host on their own machine or at other hosters (like nitrado for example) because Bethesda knows as soon as there's an option for modders to do all the work out of their control they would loose control over 76 itself when modders begin to give people a working game like with previous titles while also allowing people content that was locked behind the paywall
---
Read through the comments and you'll see how much of a doormat the playerbase is.
---
 A bit off topic but I think you should play less ;p really, 18h/day is not healthy
---
Let's be honest. Outer worlds kind of sucks.
---
Agreed, the games that offer the most gameplay life are usually filled with timesinks. xD
---
It's not always Tuesday, luckily for them.
---
Probably just zealots.
---
Completely normal for any brand subreddit.
---
Criticism towards the game is fine. OP was criticizing people for having fun AND discrediting their authenticity by likening them to PR. Nothing warrented that. And if we're allowed to criticize each other, you'd realize I'd like to point out how rediculous it is to criticize people for enjoying an item of which it's sole purposeless is to be enjoyed. Then go on a subreddit around that game and try to squash that joy.
---
I agree, some rad immunity, maybe like 1 minute or something around there would be the best of both worlds really. 
---
I know what you mean as a non pa user though, it's a pain in the ass when I use all my rad away to get back to the fight
---
You re lacking in basic reading comprehension so a proper answer isnt worth my time bethesda shill.
---
This was earlier this year. I was around level 50 or so and happened to have 2 pieces of the auto-stim gear since they have the best stats of what I had at the time! I wanted to make sure they didn‚Äôt both proc and make me blow through my stims, and so I forced it to proc and kept an eye on my stimpak count. Looks like it‚Äôs an ‚Äúeither/or type situation instead of it stacking. Hope that makes sense.
---
I mean it isn't, the vast majority of things to do don't require you to pay money to do them or even make them easy.
---
If the subscription worked, there wouldn't be posts saying it doesn't. And we're not talking one or two either.
---
I'm being specifically shot at and bashed nightly since the memberships, all these new NCR badasses want me off public servers too I guess. At least they're not verbally abusive though, so I guess they can carry on, they paid for it
---
By now I'm not sure if I should be happy that I called it or sad that I called it (and Bethesda became so predictable)
---
It is multiplicative. In PvP you'll burn through *a lot* of stimpaks, if opponnent is nearby and guarding your corpse...
---
What's your point. This reddits entertaining as fuck seeing dipshits like you support this clown show of a company
---
Salty
---
yea cry louder griefers üòéüòé god you sound like such a loser.. I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs just true..
---
Afaik prime mods cannot be learned by scrapping,so if you missing one mod, might be the prime receiver that you can get as a drop of the queen fight.
---
What? Why?
---
You said your life. Not day. Not good times. Life.
---
PvP only when you and your friends want. No competition from workshops, lower resource competition. Those are slight variations just like survival mode had. And again the ability to shift between official and private at will makes it a different game mode.
---
Y‚Äôall are mentally ill. Fallout 76 is hella fun and you don‚Äôt even need fallout 1st to play.
---
Last time i checked the game is not gta5.
---
Proud supporter and worth every penny for the subscription
---
Kill modding? C'mon! It will allow you to mod! Be a support of Bethesda :D  
---
/somuchsarcasm off
---
Worst of all, when you die, essentially damage done gets reset so if the queen does get killed, you get diddly squat if you died and didnt damage her and stay alive whilst she perished. I had it happen in the fight before the one I've been describing here where I did a pretty substantial amount of damage but since I died and she was killed before I got a hit in again, I missed out on any loot I shoulda gotten.
---
I was actually thinking of casual/hardcore in terms of motivation and interests, rather than time played. I tend to think of hardcore players as committed PVPers and raiders, and since this game doesn't do a great job catering to either, I figured only casual players would pay a monthly fee.
---
Well, the excavator is basically free calibrated shocks at the downside of having one of the worst defenses. Two calibrated shocks, no matter the armor, only gives 100 pounds extra. That being said, calibrated schools on the excavator stacks with the armors ability, giving you 200 pounds extra to your normal weight.
---
You are. But I'm allowed to spend my money however I want. And to have my own opinion on it.
---
Go to military wing I believe it‚Äôs called. 
---
When you find what looks like a briefing room with a lot of office desks go up the stairs and through the nuke room. There you should find 2 terminals selling the mods. 
---
Hope that helped
---
Wow, I didn't look at it like that. He's wanting the mods to come in and silence the people with opposing opinions. I agree with you. But, I dont want a single megathread about this issue. I really want the mods to see all the different posts and comments so they know the severity of the issue.
---
GTAO would not be the same without the occasional random acts of violence and I wouldn't want it any other way. I was merely observing that I had a particularly treacherous trip to the tennis court that evening.
---
Peer to Peer and Live service are two different things. 76's map is so large and so much to do that a peer to peer connection would limit 8 people  to only be able to travel a certain distance from host. If they can even fit 8 people into the server.
---
It‚Äôs very expensive to develop games and small, Indy publishers need to generate continuous revenue to continue producing such high quality, innovative entertainment.
---
Just think about the fact FO76 has 16 times the detail of Fallout 4.  Don‚Äôt forget the rich storyline, seamless pvp, and the amazing offerings on the Atomic Shop!  
---
Truly, I have heard there might be a few charming little bugs, but that‚Äôs the rich character that makes Bethesda games so gosh-darn fun!  
---
So please, enjoy our mini-DLC offerings on the Atomic Shop and give Fallout 1st a chance, maybe 12 months or so to get the amazing discount.
---
I think eliminating survival was a bad move HOWEVER it was equally a bad move allowing anyone to transfer their character into survival at the height of duping... that eliminated anyone remotely wanting to try it from doing so. 
---
Hearing the horror stories like losing 200 stims and caps early on... nailed that coffin hard! 
---
PvP‚Äôers coming back to adventure freely to farm instead of surviving was a joke... should have been a new character deal and unable to transfer anything.
---
If PvP‚Äôers really wanted to PvP and wanted to keep survival then why did sooooo many PvP‚Äôers have to come back to adventure mode to farm supplies? Not exactly surviving anything... 
---
If there‚Äôs so many PvP‚Äôers... that all want PvP, then why do PvP‚Äôers have to them instigate PvP with pve‚Äôers? (Literally happens all the time)
---
That alone tells me that there‚Äôs not that many true PvP‚Äôers and more griefers or those that maybe aren‚Äôt that great in survival or other reasons that feel the need to attack and instigate PvP with pve‚Äôers. 
---
Flip side... they need survival back so they can give those who want PvP a world to do that in. 
---
People will say... well PvP is part of the game... ok... well now private servers are part of the game. Part of which I don‚Äôt think would have happened if not for all the requests due to issues I mentioned above that you say they‚Äôre catering to.
---
it's ok! just come to the Outer Worlds! It may not have the fallout name, but it's way better than anything Bethesda is doing.
---
Private servers/worlds were always going to be a charged service, it was reported by PC Gamer on Oct 2018
---
Just beat the game. Has to be the best game I have ever played in a very long time
---
If it‚Äôs locked you have to complete more of the enclave quest
---
Nah the mods here make sure it‚Äôs as toxic as possible.
---
i hate to be *that* guy but take a Buffout or max HP altering product and go sit in some radiation
---
Why? That is literally what true private server mods do. The S+ mod for Ark drastically alters how you play the game. This mod exists because private servers are completely isolated from public servers.
---
You can't (and shouldn't bother) to report people for posting their disdain, but *absolutely* report people attacking others (even if they're downvoted to hell) or for breaking any other rules *that are already on the books*.  
---
Don't waste the mods' time reporting things you don't *think* should be allowed though.  Non-76, memes, witch hunting, brigading, and personal attacks are already vule violations, definitely go after those.
---
Out worlds is over rated. I can't seem to get into it. The world is tiny. The dialog is cool but still its no mass effect. The weapons are so so. I'm I missing something or are people pretending to like it in spite of fallout 76?
---
Oh man, try playing Red Dead Online! You don't even know about camp troubles until you've dealt with old Cripps!
---
this.
---
Obvious satire is obvious
---
The mods are free on skyrim.
---
Yea, even hotkeying a hazmat suit to escape. That then means you have to re equip all your armour pieces individually and even if you have them all hotkeyed it's going to be frustrating. It would also be better if the hazmat suit classed as under armour or you could mod it to do so so that you didn't have to compromise your armour and time putting it all back just to have a guaranteed escape plan from a place you shouldn't actually be in in the first place.
---
So, with your point #1, you're basically just saying to get rid of 1st huh.
---
pick up Marsupial if you don't already have it.  That'll add 20 to your carry weight.
---
Something else doesnt seem right - IIRC, I can do 455.   But I'm also running with motion assist servos and optimized bracers, both of which are + str.  Doesn't more strength increase carry weight?
---
If you are not concerned about fast travel, you should be able to carry up to 1420# in X01 and still move at a normal pace.
---
I don't honestly think anyone would have had an issue with private servers if they'd rented us 24/7 persistent servers. Implementing "private servers" as the ability to temporarily restrict access to an instance and bundling it in with some freemium features was a weird move on Bethesda's part.
---
I‚Äôm just so enthralled by the rich end game content.
---
All companies does that, if they don't profit they backrupt and game over, the problem here is that they started all wrong with a broken game and decide to charge for the fix and features that players was asking since launch, its despicable.
---
This comment did not age very well.
---
They wouldn't send me a review copy, just a promo check. And I don't buy most games at release anymore after FO76 unless I absolutely know I'm going to love it. 
---
Paying you guys in money and not atoms now? That's good to hear, was starting to worry about you guys.
---
Well , I better get my hands dirty
---
Exactly. It's a cash cow to them. They dont give a shit about players, modders, or anyone else unless they're getting paid. I really hope people do boycott bethesda because of this. If all the gamers came together we would have a massive impact on them, and they would have no choice but to rethink and change. Unfortunately I dont see that happening anytime soon.
---
I‚Äôve enjoyed this game from day 1 even with the issues that happen. A big reason for that is being able to team up with friends and hang out. Also meeting new peeps on here that are cool as hell! 
---
You can get lost very easily and a few minutes turns into hours! Ha! 
---
I‚Äôm working on completing all the challenges in the game and that‚Äôs a bigger challenge than all the quests! With the new DLC fast LT approaching, I‚Äôm positive more challenges will be created.
---
It‚Äôs actually not a bad example, because gta o does this for exactly the reason you stated to force you to play in unbalanced PvP lobbies, making it impossible to make money, bc the hydra and oppressor are so unfair. This forces most players to buy mtxs if they want to experience anything new. But it is an invite only peer to peer lobby as opposed to a dedicated server which is usually what has a cost associated. GTAO doesn‚Äôt prevent you from doing activities in those private sessions for technical reasons, it is simply rockstars greed that causes this. 
---
Fallout 76 seems to advertise dedicated private servers but in reality it‚Äôs just a private peer to peer session. Idk why they charge for this, peer to peer costs them nothing.
---
Thatki
---
Preach üôåüèªüôåüèª
---
It's sad when a game is reduced to a time vs cost metric. Forget about quality. Forget about satisfaction. Cost over time.
---
I mean it only makes sense to look at it that way, right? 
---
Like you alluded to, I mean why go out for food ever? Forget about the entertainment value. It has a terrible cost per calorie value. I mean that's why bulk feed bags are the best! Who needs flavour or texture. What matters the most is the cost per calorie.
---
I just feel sad for you now.
---
What makes you think they're lootboxes and not just reskins for the paper bag, which are now being sold?
---
Mine is permanently set up outside vault 94. It would be nice if there was at the very least an tinkers bench for folks to craft ammo and repair mainframe cores etc. ahead of a raid
---
Yeah I understand. Its just been a rough week on this Sub-Reddit, i'm tired of the negativity.
---
I honestly am happy with the game. I don't have an issue with the bugs and they seem to be pretty rare for me. Disconnects are also very rare. I just started doing the vault raides and thought it was pretty good tbh. I liked the difficulty and the part with the relays was pretty neat.  
---
I expect wastelanders to be postponed for a while now so that wasn't much of a surprise.  Fallout First was a surprise, though I'm not to bothered by it. 
---
Looking forward to more end game content and wastelanders. Otherwise its smooth sailing for me. I like to hop on at night, grind for mats and chill.
---
Lets hope tod actualy whants to do this
---
Neither does GTA Online. You just have to *grind*. When you pay money, you‚Äôre paying for CONVENIENCE! üòè
---
Jeez man your writing style is pretentious, might want to tone that down
---
Chest mod adds strength and increases carry, plenty of perk cards also help a great deal on top of mutations.
---
No it's a good game. It may not be to your liking but it is to others. This game has given people a chance to feel like they're playing fallout 3/4 for the first time again but in space!
---
This actually might work and make it possible to trade legendaries with other players with caps again, but it will take a long time until it starts stabilizing the value of caps.
---
I do, because i have too many caps...its easy to be lazy, and just buy the ammo i want.
---
Seems that the decision to do this came from zenimax and not BethGS or even bethsoft. More bigwigs making game decisions with no understanding.
---
And ppl like you are the reason why this industry is going to shits, thank you for the corporate fellatio, and don't forget to swallow.
---
Where the hell did I deny other launchers suck on china's tit? They're all anti-consumer, but the chinese game launcher is the worst of them all. And before you say anything, I don't use steam or any other launcher. Any game I buy that isn't DRM free I apply a crack to it.
---
So are Fallout 76s private worlds actual dedicated servers or no? Because they sure seem to just be invite only peer to peer sessions much like gta, making a charge for them bullshit. If they are actual dedicated servers than its a little more acceptable, but still missing all features to usually get as a server host.
---
I feel you buddy. These trolls are annoying. They can't accept that some people enjoy things that they do not.
---
Game pass it for a dollar and see for yourself. Also if Bethesda, the company I work for, straight up copy pasted mechanics, map and game design from a different developer people would be foaming at the mouth demanding legal action and lawsuits.
---
Lmao people still play this shit?
---
First day I grinded a lot of Matt‚Äôs and transferred some from my mule to my main and put them in my scrap box, next day they‚Äôre gone.. so I mean i like to see the positives but it‚Äôs hard.. I‚Äôm just not playing for now.. seems to be easier for me..
---
Is he available for stealing? :)
---
Cause my Shop Tibbs' N Chips is named after my pooch called Tibbles and my tag is Kaiser lol Seems like a perfect match to visit my shop :)
---
Minecraft can let 8 people on a p2p server and yes they have to keep track of everything in the world. Minecraft is far more bigger then fallout. I don't belive you understand. This is not the only time this game has come under fire. This is exhasting, the game should be properly devloped before release. Honestly if the game came out, and it didnt have so many problems, this should of been an option at launch. Yeah Bethesda is new to online only games. Maybe they shouldn't have made it in house. Or put it in early access!!

I don't want to be that guy here but most of those problems you are willing to spend money to avoid have kind of been caused by other decisions the devs have made. Dickholes one shotting all the legendaries definitely occurred sometimes, but that problem became so much worse after they "fixed" the events by making them public. See Free Range, Uranium Fever and One Violent Night new and improved public versions and please note they talked about updating the tagging/looting system but have not really tried to implement a change their yet. Low levels wandering into SBQ event definitely got worse with public events. PVP griefers have absolutely increased since they killed survival mode. 
---
I'm not saying they made the game worse on purpose just to sell more subscriptions, but good god man what if they truly were evil enough to do this.
---
I lost all mine too, I was so excited about my scrap box I dumped everything into it. I am a more casual player so loosing all my flux really hurt. :(
---
So they found a sneaky way to false advertise?
---
rofl
---
I believe you, it happened to me too.
---
Because they have atom shop icons where they are piles, small, big and medium. Sounds familiar?
---
Up to a point, I agree with you.  If the whole sub turns into a witch hunt (on either side, or even both), it will be time to step in IMO.  We're nowhere near that yet though.
---
I mean, I get it, no one wants to hear people on the opposite side of how you feel, especially if you feel very strongly.  But if you silence the people who don't like the changes, this turns into a FO fanboy love fest.  And if you silence the people who are OK with the current state, it turns into a shooting gallery with no real talk about what *does* work and what people genuinely like about the game.
---
Long story short, welcome to the internet, where the loudest people always get heard, even if they're idiots :P
---
Just used cheats was more fun as just grinding for hours
---
My favourite are the 'alive' scorched who stand or lie in the same poses, muttering about how much it hurts. My brain says that they are turning into the dead/exploding ones. I tell myself that shooting them is a mercy killing.
---
Nothing beats uninstalling and reinstalling
---
Probably because GTA made over a billion dollars and still makes millions a month, over 5 years after release.
---
Honestly, the best chance I see of this happening is if Bethesda decide to fold on FO76 and release the server software to the public as a mea culpa. As long as they're supporting the game, they're not going to allow that to happen, because it would undermine their ability to monetize it.
---
Saying that they implemented private servers incorrectly is a very different argument than saying that they should be free, which is what the OP is stating.  
---
As of right now, they have said they plan on expanding them in the future - to make them persistent and to allow mods.  
---
Any other discussion about it (like should the scrap box be included in the subscription - personally I think in one way shape or form it should be made available to everyone) is something else, but I have seen a lot of people who have taken only the quote about all future content would be free and applied it to the servers as well - many people were misinformed.
---
Such a troll account
---
I see a few people being open to the idea of them being added, but I stand by my belief that the majority of the community is against the idea of further moving away from cosmetic-only purchases.
---
At the end of the day, though, we just have to wait and see if Bethesda does anything with it.
---
I made a post predicting mods will be creation club, paid only, and got downvoted to Oblivion,  but you‚Äôre correct, there is no way we get the same situation with mods as we had with FO4, and for pc no way they allow nexus mods.
---
See? Your daughter pulled up her big girl pants and carried on. Me? I took off. Full run.
---
Trust me I know how hard it is to develop games I‚Äôm actively trying to become a game designer but that doesn‚Äôt excuse the fact on the state of fallout 76 is right now. Honestly i would have been happy if you didn‚Äôt release fallout 76 for another year or 2 to work more in the state of it. And the money thing. It doesn‚Äôt give you the excuse to squeeze money out of the last loyal fans of fallouts. You could have continued to sell cosmetics. It works perfectly for Fortnite( don‚Äôt Hate on me for mentioning Fortnite ). Pay to win games in my opinion are the worst type of games, don‚Äôt get me wrong I LOVE fallout like I said but right now I‚Äôm not sure if I should stay in the fallout community because of the state of things.
---
The storyline is deep and really cool I‚Äôll give you that but you basically reused your resources from fallout 4 into fallout 76, I‚Äôm not against that if you produced a good game in fallout 76 but again fallout 76 is a shit show right now.
---
Yes some of the bugs are hilarious and charming but there are others that are game breaking,
---
And fallout 1st oh don‚Äôt get me started, Bethesda asked what they could do to improve fallout 76, took all those ideas and put it in a paid membership which is more expensive then the Xbox game pass and gives less then it. If you really want to hear more of what I think about fallout 1st just ask I would be more then happy about it.
---
Do those games contain bugs that have been there since beta?
---
Nice. So only the true fans got fucked over so bad.
---
How long do ppl need to realize that literally everything they tell you is horseshit?
---
If you work for a greedy clown company like Bethesda, chances are you dont even have any integrity.
---
Is 76 not peer to peer? Are the ‚Äúprivate worlds‚Äù actually dedicated servers?
---
I honesty have no idea how they managed to do that fuck up...
---
Good to hear Todd!
---
It shouldn‚Äôt be a paid service that‚Äôs the thing. You have to pay to have a world with your friends. It‚Äôs not right. Especially the amount they are charging for it
---
Last time i was away for a few months I just restarted a new character.
---
So some mods are from scrapping, some are rewards for events, and some are just bought exclusively from robot vendors. To find out which it is I suggest you check out this awesome list put together by [Aardonyx9](https://www.reddit.com/user/Aardonyx9/).

---
People absolutely used that.
---
And whomever is downvoting me for stating a simple fact get your head out of your ass.
---
Free.... nothing is free... people have to realize that literally nothing is free especially in the real world. 
---
There will always be a cost associated with everything and that cost pays other people and gives them a paycheck and pays their healthcare and more to support themselves and family... even the Amazon guy who may have delivered your game... 
---
Want a better game? Takes people, more creativity, more opportunities... all have a price tag. 
---
Servers aren‚Äôt exactly free either, anyone in the tech community will acknowledge this. Engineers maintaining the systems alone 24/7 for our entertainment need to get paid so we can play the game anytime we want. 
---
Bottom line nothing is free and anyone saying otherwise is literally lying to you.
---
Biggest issue with gta Online is forced PvP and a complete lack of balance, they didn‚Äôt even try, but an impossible grind (due to absolutely no balance) just plays into the pay to win.
---
Yes that‚Äôs exactly my point. What your getting for how much your paying is completely ridiculous.
---
The MTX store?
---
I was thinking of doing that but I had help last time going through everything and those people dont play anymore.
---
I live on a mountain near no natural resources. Invest in a medium water purifier, and have a small house. I've only logged in once and someone was there.

Where is the 1st icon? Are we talking about the icon a person picks to represent themselves on the map or is there another icon somewhere?
---
Sorry sir, let me help you with this, i represent Todd and Bethesda. To stop your blue screening, I'm going to have to ask you for $20 a month to allow you to play blue screen free. 
---
Sincerely, Bethesda
---
*I'm not boycotting the game.*
---
I'm saying that grieving 1st players to protest the membership by literally playing the game is hypocritical and has absolutely no effect on Bethesda's decisions.
---
The only effective way to protest Bethesda's lies and greed is to stop playing the game completely.
---
Doesn't change the fact the tent gives an unfair advantage in PvP, thus making it p2w.
---
Yeah im gonna need you to justify that....
---
I really don‚Äôt. Thanks again for deflecting again. I‚Äôm not watching a 20 minute video. I have to get back to work.
---
Sure if You ignore literally winning over the other players.
---
&gt; Minecraft 30USD. Servers with your own rules are free, use your own  hardware. Realms are 8 bucks a month if you cant rock the hardware. 
---
And it is is 60 USD on console and can only have 4 people online max including the host. And the game loads slowly and has a lot of delay in actions due to the host being over worked trying to run the game for themselves and the other 3 people. 
---
$8 a month x 12 months = $96.  Which is only 4 dollars less then 76. And as far as I can tell there is no yearly sub discount only the single auto renew month by month plan.  The fact there is no quick access list of prices for region is annoying as shit and makes finding out this information much more difficult.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs bs I called rockstar out on the gta o sub just as much as I call out bethesda here, and get downvoted as much as I do here. The ignorant/apathetic masses will always outnumber the people who care enough to want the industry to change, and stop rushing games, making them predatory monetization simulators etc.
---
I know nothing is free but they if not get rid of fallout 1st at least make it cheaper. For how much you get from it and how much you pay for it is completely ridiculous. But again it‚Äôs just my opinion and I understand where you come from.
---
It could also be people like the game? Not everything has to be some grand conspiracy with involving the shills.
---
LOL she's a different generation. For them, if you hear the action, that's where you're supposed to go!
---
ESO $14.99 a month, WoT and WoW $99 a year... this is the new standard for online games. 
---
Just like 1st, it‚Äôs not required to play the game or even needed. 
---
We‚Äôve all gotten by with 800lbs... great...
---
I'm pretty sure it is much easier to implement than people think. We have the full game, its 'offline' mode is simply locked away, otherwise we wouldn't need to update the game for events.
---
P2P servers won't cause issues with official servers because they won't be able to be used to progress our official characters.
---
We already knew a number of people were coming here just for the trolling, there were tons of people who never even played the game, or never even came to this subreddit before simply to ‚Äùmake a statement‚Äù
---
I like Angry Joe Show - but he gave up on the game after his first review, he‚Äôs popular.  To thing that his videos about Fallout 76 didn‚Äôt encourage people to come to Reddit or go to twitter to troll is ignorant at best
---
Since the day it was announced there were people who were fine with it.  They weren‚Äôt quiting.  it‚Äôs not that 100% of the sub was up in arms.  It was never ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äù
---
Time is going by and the trolls are leaving, people who are just upset are giving up (no rational person would stay here if they were that upset and decided to quit).  It‚Äôs slowly going back to just the people who were having a good time before, and are still having a good time now. 
---
I‚Äôm also pretty sure it‚Äôs a argument fallacy to basically assume everyone with a positive attitude is a shill.
---
My guess would be a paid vacation that we paid for.
---
Shotguns are what saves me against Yao guai and Deathclaws.  Shoot 'em in the legs a few times and the poor things are just lying on the floor whimpering.
---
That can't happen, because the game actually takes place on their servers. Our launcher just communicates with it. That's why lag is such a big factor, among other things.
---
The outrage over this subscription is totally over the top. It's like a bunch of kids in a candy store, and the owner says "Hey, you can have everything off this specific shelf for free!". Then they see another kid decide to buy something off a different shelf, and throw a fit when the store owner won't also give that that other, entirely different shelf of candy for free. 
---
I haven't seen this many people lie in unison since the last time I watched Congress on TV.
---
I had trouble too when i started playing again, but i sunk 1400 hours into it before i quit, so it wasnt that hard to get back in. If your below lvl 50, i suggest you try and lvl up first. All the stuff you need is everywhere.  I think its kinda fun to be at that stage where you have nothing, and work up.
---
Imagine being so bitter that you think nobody could possibly enjoy a video game you dislike lol
---
Oh my god, a post on fo76 praising the game?! How unheard of! This subreddit should be for venting and venting only! How dare they actually show interest in this game we don‚Äôt like! 
---
Seriously. The ones who hate the game have left the subreddit to enjoy other games, and the ones who complain still make their posts. Why is it so absurd that a new gamer or a person who genuinely enjoys the game must be vilified for making a post praising this game? 
---
This is literally the prime example of that meme: ‚ÄòwHy aRe yoU hAvIng fun? stOP hAviNg FUN.‚Äô
---
It absolutely will not be free. Mods for 76 will be very much restricted (can‚Äôt allow modding character at all unless they prevent you from going to public sessions after), and besides given how quickly monetization has escalated in this game while content updates are sparse and underwhelming, I guarantee mods are paid, creation club only.
---
They do provide 1650 (?) atoms with the subscription, so if you're buying atoms anyway, it's hardly a ripoff.  Plenty of people regularly purchase atoms, the subscription caters to those people, as well as people who actually want the other things that are included.
---
If it's not for you, feel free to ignore it.
---
No Mr. Trump, we can't just silence all the people with opposing viewpoints just because you don't like it.
---
What I don's get is that even for the people who say they bought Fallout 1st the opposing side still say they respect that person but politely say they cant support their decision.
---
What OP wants is an alternative universe where more people are ok with this. I haven't seen anyone be nasty towards the opposing side. 
---
A few people might disagree with me, but I want this to be the topic of discussion for a very, very long time.
---
I know why. Because the more we nuke Appalachia the more Ultracyte is created. The more ultracyte, the more the blight disease feeds.
---
I stopped playing a bit ago might reinstall to help edit small things on the wiki If the need arises.
---
I'm lvl 47, and like everything has changed since I was last on here. It's so weird.
---
Yeah I do agree it will take a long time, but I feel that's for the best. :) We could achieve the same result by doing something like a limited time event that costs caps but has really good rewards, but that would give a large advantage to rich players.
---
I feel like this way is fairly balanced, and provides a gentle decline to allow the market to adjust, as opposed to a limited time event where within a week there are half as many caps in game. :)
---
I was thinking of a 0.5% or something, nothing that has too much of an impact.
---
&gt; That can't happen, because the game actually takes place on their servers. Our launcher just communicates with it.
---
This is how most online games work. Right now the server address is hard coded into the client, so that would need to change, but otherwise, it wouldn't be a huge adjustment: let players host their own servers locally and add a "connect to server" screen where people can enter a new host IP.
---
Kinda weird tho. Why are you posting in this sub if u hate the game so much.
---
Fallout 1st updates are hidden behind a paywall nothing in Diablo 2 was, neither is anything in java minecraft. Literally have p2w items tied to the subscription. Remember the tent is indestructible and can be thrown down anywhere. Thst means free indestructible cover in PvP you can place anywhere. Which Bethesda Has already deemed gamebreaking, which is why they patched out foundation stacking as it was too overpowered in PvP.
---
I would rather be able to kill something before it can kill me.
---
Gta is good to compare to 76 as an example of predatory overmonetization. In many ways gta is worse though.
---
They should definitely NOT do any of those things. The features in the subscription were never promised for free. They are a BUSINESS. They need to make money. That's their entire reason for existing. Not to cater to some entitled, broke, borrowed-moms-credit-card-without-asking minority subset of the fanbase.
---
...Did you collect this data yourself?
---
Nope, because frick these kind of money hungry schemes.
---
Been doing the same tbh, enjoying the game now more than ever lol. Not into Fallout 1st, so I just don't pay for it. Problem solved.
---
Try Feedback - Graphics, that looks like the closest place (you can attach files there)
---
They really need to go over all these pieces and re-think their snap points and restrictions. 
---
I just recently built on a slope and it was a pain to get the foundations to line up correctly so that the ‚Äúmain floor‚Äù of the home and ‚Äúbasement‚Äù of the home would be flush. At this point it‚Äôs clear to me floating CAMPS are going to be a thing regardless, Hell we have ‚Äúunderground‚Äù CAMPS now, so they might as well just lift a lot of the restrictions meant to prevent those things, because all they do is hurt honest ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù builders like myself.

precedents, also known as how every online game worked until late 2000s

I just snorted very inelegantly, and it's all your fault. All I could imagine was my own toon leaping over a table to attack someone... with her punch bowl.

ü§ôüèº
---
Sony. . . no gamepass for me. I mean, I don't see why Bethesda doesn't take legal action if that's the case. Then claim the assets and just name it The Fall-Outer Worlds or something.
---
Look I know they are a business but it doesn‚Äôt excuse the fact of what state fallout 76 is. It‚Äôs a broken, buggy mess.
---
When you say forced I disagree because even with all that there are still a multitude of ways were your put into instances where your not in a public lobby.... heists , survivals , races , contact missions I could go on and on...so I guess you only feel forced if your not willing to grind or you want it right now to keep up with the Joneses ...the only point i was trying to make is the OP was trying to make the private lobbies in GTA sound like it's all cookies and cream...just letting those who don't know...know...
---
Not even necessarily Bethesda PR team, plenty of ignorant drones who will blindly defend anything bethesda does who simply don‚Äôt care that this game has more monetization than content
---
I second the üñï
---
They're not physically visible, but if another player interacts with it they can take something from it.
---
They also built the game using unreal engine which is newer but more limited than what Bethesda is still using. Outer World's isnt fully open world and it's managing nearly as much physics items as any Bethesda game. It's more like Deus Ex and Bioshock mixed together and not a Fallout game.
---
In Bethesdas corner, It's expensive to build a new engine for a game and it's been proven to be bug prone ever since the days of Morrowind. Remember they also openly admitted adding netcode to the engine was extremely difficult but it "works". It's not perfect but maybe they hit a point where they couldn't scrap the project and rebuild? Idk.
---
So that means Obsidian and Bethesda are not at similar enough to compare other than they both made Fallout games. They have two different positions to look at a video game and Outer World's played it safe. Personally, it's cool to see Fallout 76 be a massive risk, means the industry is thinking outside of the box. I'm tired of yearly CoDs lol but I'll say it again, Outer World's is an overly safe game. Fun but nothing "new" to the world of gaming. 
---
Back to Obsidian, the company has a certain flavor of game they make that differs from Bethesda. They make RPG experiences like Tyranny, and Pillars of Eternity, even The Stick of Truth has depth to it as an RPG game. Bethesda makes shooter/hack &amp; slash games that have an RPG experience layered over them. Outer World's is a much deeper RPG experience than Fallout has been (imo) 
---
We can expect better but we also can't keep just telling a company what we want. Developers have a vision of art they want to make, same an artist making a painting. Would you tell an artist what to paint? We can't always dictate what we want, just pay for what we do and not pay for what we don't. Don't get so fucking vocal about it. Just stop supporting a company in silence.
---
Boss here, I pay your bills. Get back to work and get off reddit you lazy bum.
---
I‚Äôm aware of the red pawn timer, that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs happening here. Also I think the game should have been released after the servers could run the normal game smoothly.
---
To be fair to Bethesda. I am loving outer worlds, but it's not a big as FO4, FO76 or Skyrim.
---
I'm not saying Bethesda couldn't do a lot better, and be less greedy, but it's not exactly a fair comparison. I think the better statement would be Obsidian focused on creating a smooth playing fun game with real consequences to actions. And Bethesda doesn't know how to limit a game to what they are able to reasonably accomplish.
---
If you can host the server on your computer, then you can mod it as much as you want. Who is going to buy crappy weapon skins on the money store if you could just mod them into the game for free?
---
Google how much private servers cost. It‚Äôs more than worth the cost.
---
Feel free to brag elsewhere though, we don't need to vitriol right now.
---
That's a big hell no.
---
But why get rid of it if it‚Äôs an option? We‚Äôve all gotten by with stash increase since the beginning... 400lbs was crazy! 600 was a huge plus and 800... wow! 
---
But many instead of managing that space want more space.. 
---
I have 1st, had a MS credit so it cost like $43 for the year. 
---
I haven‚Äôt placed my scrap box since most if not all junk is bulked and haven‚Äôt placed the tent yet either. 
---
I have played with friends on the private server and it‚Äôs been great! 
---
You know what sucks though... seeing people who love the game get targeted by hate because they bought something they like... that‚Äôs pretty shitty on all levels...
---
My repairs and ammo. At the rate i collect sbq repair kits i only need a few scraps for the times i dont wanna use kits. Also for mods
---
We joke, but just imagine if Bethesda actually included access to better servers as part of Fallout 1st.
---
Leave it to a Responder to help someone in need. Thank you, I will try this
---
Well they're  not meant to be played solo and they run silky smooth for me on xbox
---
I wore mine yesterday and didn't get credit for it.
---
Oh seriously. You're a warp-warrior. Melee/explosives was a great combo. Throws grenades at anything you can't chain.
---
Imagine being this delusional, outer worlds has 96% recommend rating, while fo76 has a 6% recommend rating. Yet outer world's is the bad game? Lmao
---
Oh my bad I thought you mentioned the epic launcher that must have been someone else. Shit man you have a ps4 wth are you worrying about FO76 for. You have all those amazing exclusives to enjoy:)
---
I used to be a melee build like you, until I took an arrow to the knee.  Now I am a sneaky sniper.
---
Tbh I'm still hoping these guys finally make some good decisions, at the moment they are kind of "bullies" the way they treat us
---
Doesn't change the fact that they spent money on it and can criticize the game all they want. Its not like it's a person who never bought it just coming here to rub salt in the wound that it's literally one of the worst games ever released.  It's a paying customer voicing displeasure with what they bought. 
---
But even further you dont need any reason to comment on a sub and thinking otherwise is a very immature and sad way of thinking.
---
I'll pay for it if it pays for more BASE GAME content, not exclusive content. More quests, etc for everyone. Content is going to be key for me. And I don't mean wastlanders 4 months from now.
---
love that sub, such a breath of fresh air. i love going there and sucking each other off because we are just a bunch of sheep that cant possibly stand up for something despite knowing its wrong. haha love it
---
That's a treasure to someone. Put it in your vendor someone will want it.
---
Don‚Äôt have a list but probably the Halloween Costume sets (witch, skeleton) and the fasnacht masks.
---
yea boy spread dem cheeks
---
There response had nothing to do with the topic they were commenting on. They are just trolling.
---
4 times the bugs of Fallout 4 and 16 times worse marketing decisions
---
Another white knighter at work. Tencent is a minority shareholder in Epic Games, an AMERICAN company. It's like the same idiotic comments that think the Chinese control Reddit because they own shares in Reddit.
---
Minecraft doesn't, there is literally zero mincrotransactions in the java Minecraft game.
---
Some people, on both sides, are polite.  Some aren't.  That's the way things go.
---
I've seen plenty of people who bought the package but say they don't agree with the direction things are going, and plenty of people (I'm one) who won't buy it but understand why some people want what's being offered.  The rest are just here to wag their e-peen around, feel free to ignore them (most people already do).
---
Not too sure on this as I've never worn any auto-stim piece but I'm sure it doesn't stack just like chameleon doesn't either.
---
What I do know that stacks is the 50% fall reduction to armor, two pieces gives you 100% FR making it possible to jump from high and not die just like wearing PA
---
"Private Servers" are just an instance, they still use the same base servers as everyone else. The frozen enemy thing has been around for a long time, it's something that happens when a mob dies and respawns at the same time. Somehow that freezes the state of it.
---
OP seriously just turned this into a bash 1st thread, after saying it was for another thread üòÇ
---
Employee here. Good luck keeping your business open without my support. Your response: I can replace you. Can you? Sometimes yes. Sometimes no.
---
And then what? People already paid, up to a year an advance for these things. And any apology at this point is just going to be seen as damage control. 
---
I‚Äôm not really happy about his either, I bought a month to rest and review the service for my friends. I won‚Äôt be buying more without some changes to the service. But I just don‚Äôt how Bethesda is going to appease people at this point. Sure they could hand out the stuff for free and refund the people that paid, but then they still haven‚Äôt fully regained community favor, and even lost some extra because I doubt many Fallout 1st subscribers (and there‚Äôs a lot judging by public lobbies) will be happy with that move.
---
I‚Äôve been playing outerworlds but they are very different games. Single player, not open world, hard to compare to 76.
---
Are you using vats when this happens?
---
Are you hardwired to the internet?
---
What is your download/upload speed?
---
I'd probably ask around 7-8K for one of those in my vendors.  Not a huge amount, but to the right person I bet that would be well worth it.
---
At some point nihilism and negativity goes from iconoclastic chic to worrisome and unhealthy.
---
Do you get the issue where ghouls crawl on the floor and hit you? 
---
Fucking game breaking since they also don't make noise half the time. Been there since launch
---
What do you expect from an account called Todd Howard
---
To be honest, back when I played this game I thought pretty highly of it around when Nuclear Winter launched. I enjoyed playing adventure mode, but played nuclear winter for about a week before realizing it is probably the worst Battle Royale out there, at least of the 5 or so I've played.
---
I'd say don't waste your time on 76, but REALLY don't waste your time on the worst BR game out there
---
Well, actually that‚Äôs a good example - D&amp;D over the years has had tons of books, magazines, and various other ‚Äùadd ons‚Äù and after so many years, they reboot the game as a new edition and change the rules just a bit or the lore just a bit.  
---
Magic the Gathering (and other card games) - loot boxes before loot boxes were a thing really.  Then add in that they would have tournament formats where every couple of years your old cards can‚Äôt be used with new cards and you had a circle of purchase.
---
The Sims was a really good example of a game that had tons of ‚Äúadd ons‚Äù in the form of expansions and stuff packs, they continue to do that today as well.  
---
Even other games had add-ons, yes games like Doom and Quake had online maps you could sometimes download if you actually had internet access, otherwise you were out buying the CDs from EB or GameStop with map packs. 
---
Shoot, I can remember some of the early Telnet Days with MUDs and MUSHs where if you paid for a subscription you got some bonuses in game. 
---
And yeah, glitches in games were pretty normal back in the day of computer gaming, and since most of us didn‚Äôt have access to online we couldn‚Äòt even get patch downloads.  There are quite a few bugs and AI issues with some of the best old RPGs - Diablo has various dupe bugs, Baldur‚Äôs Gate has all sorts of AI issues.  Even Games like Super Mario Bros - depending on how you jumped into things could get you to stages like -1, and in games like Final Fantasy some of the weapons that were supposed to have special effects did not do what they were supposed to (such as the were sword dealing extra damage to wolf creatures).  
---
I‚Äôm ‚Äúonly‚Äù 40 but I agree - given the amount of code that goes into a game, I don‚Äôt feel the number of bugs/glitches are any more proportionally bad than they were ‚ÄúBack in the day‚Äù
---
Look I‚Äôm not meaning to target and hate on the people who have bought it. I personally haven‚Äôt bought it and I‚Äôm not think about buying it I‚Äôm just talking about it from I can see on the outside. If you love fallout 1st good for you and I don‚Äôt want to hate on people who have bought it that‚Äôs not the purpose for it and I have actually thought about instead of removing it maybe reduce the price. If you love fallout 1st then thats a good thing, no one should be hated on because of what they like or don‚Äôt like and it‚Äôs not okay to hate on them. Again it wasn‚Äôt my purpose to hate on anyone who likes fallout 1st im just saying that‚Äôs it‚Äôs ridiculous for how much you pay for it and how little you get for it.
---
That's why I made the comment, the name. Other than the dripping sarcasm his post isn't "entirely" inaccurate.
---
its great against the SBQ to freeze her
---
right, but with max 8 players, im sure that reduces lag.
---
Alright, fair enough. But obsidian is a smaller company as well, so in that regard it (kind of) equalizes the two i feel. 
---
I have to point out the beaten wife syndrome here tho. 
---
&gt;I think the better statement would be Obsidian focused on creating a smooth playing fun game with real consequences to actions.
---
Bethesda makes rpg's. Literally their one and only job is to do exactly what you just said in that statement. 
---
"No he is not that bad, he just takes on too much work so he is stressfull. Maybe if i give him some time and space things will get better" 
---
Bethesda failures are not that they do not know how to limit themselves, their failure is that they do not put in the time and effort to actually make it work. Every respectably game developer tests their games before launch. Skyrim has been resold about a dozen times, yet nearly all the bugs are still there.
---
Again, they can, they simply had the name and monopoly to get away with not giving a shit.
---
You keep saying trolling but it's very clear you have absolutley no idea what it actually means.
---
You're definitely missing something as the guns in TOW past the starting area are far more interesting than this games weak legendary system. The guns are more like Diablo weapons with far more unique stat boosts and abilities over this games TSE weapons.
---
Other than voting with the uninstall button that's how you can complain to them.
---
&gt; You wrote a whole lot of nonsense. But to be honest: You're playing TOW and BL3, so you're someone who uses the epic game store. 
---
....I play Xbox sooo....
---
Also tldr
---
The world is tiny. It's not terrible but it's definitely overrated in my opinion. If the planets were bigger maybe I'd like it better but as it stands right now there isn't much in the way exploration. The dialogue options are cool but are no where near mass effect level of depth. The graphics kind of suck and it has no physics though. That's a bummer to me. For all the fuss from internet troll experts about the creation engine I think it really holds its own against the unreal one in this instance.
---
yeah, i see them float over to me, and some kill me in one hit...I play bloodied, but seriously...some of these ghouls got game.
---
Way too many variables to guess what happened here.  Maybe he was a better shot.  Maybe energy weapons are stronger against that armor (not sure about that).  Maybe there was soem lag, and he tagged you first/faster and you just didn't see it until the server caught up.
---
It's not rick-paper-scissors, it is very possible to be in a superior situation, but still lose.
---
Just like
---
Furious, Faster fire rate, -25% VATS cost
---
On A Dragon.....
---
Also the Unstoppables outfits from the shop should count, that's what I'm counting on lol
---
just a better trigger twitchy happy player ?
---
It‚Äôs not even about that, it‚Äôs about how the people fucked up enough in the head to buy Fallout 1st are drastically going to hurt gaming for all of us
---
Monster Hunter World? 
---
Nope. 
---
It's a single player game with online multiplayer seemlesly merged into the single player. It's also missing the key characteristics that make a game a Live Service Game. I mean that while it has DLC, it's not a constant stream of it that's pushed on the player at every turn. 
---
Live service games can be defined as (from another thread):
---
"live service" game (LSG) is a game designed with the sole purpose of keeping people playing for as long as possible in the hopes that those players will pay for micro-transactions."
---
But even that definition has become murky. 
---
The issue is that the focus for the developers becomes the micro-transactions rather than the game itself. 
---
Now this is the model used in a LOT of games but how they are designed really matters. So does the initial cost to enter. 
---
Fortnight is an example of how to do it well in an online game. It's free to play and you are really encouraged to buy micro-transactions, but not required. Though the prevalence of micro-transactions can become a massive annoyance (again, see Fortnight). 
---
An example of how this can be implemented really well in a game that has to be purchased is Assassin's Creed Odyssey. There's a big micro-transaction store, BUT, they are NOT required to enjoy the game or beat the game in any way shape or form. Though as a result, it might make ACO's labeling as a Live Service Game a bit iffy.
---
The games that are killing the concept and screwing everything up are actually a combination of both Live Service AND Early Access. 
---
Games like Anthem and Fallout 76 were pushed to launch WAY to early with the expectation that the Live Service model would allow them to keep financing the development of the game after launch. I don't know WHO came up with that idea first, but that guy deserves to win the business world's "Biggest Chucklefuck of the Year Award for Groundbreakingly Stupid Decisions".
---
I think you are looking at it from the wrong angle. Nobody asked Bethesda to pay for additional servers. When they wanted "private servers", they wanted to be able to stand up servers on their own, that wasn't connected to the public play-space in any way. Then they could **mod** the game.
---
But as we all know, the modding community is infinitely better at creating content, fixing bugs, etc than Bethesda is, and that would undermine their potential income. So they twisted the idea to something unrecognizable: pay for the cosmetics, pay for the servers, and (eventually) pay for the "mods".
---
Simply put he just had to be hitting you more than you were hitting him most likely.
---
Whens mischief night start? All day?
---
Mischief Night will be available for one week, starting at 12:00 p.m. EDT on October 29 until 12:00 p.m. EST on November 5.
---
Just be glad its not mandatory subscription then I suppose. We will pay for the game for you.
---
Yea I wouldn't be surprised as well, and yea exactly! This game us way better with friends
---
Epic, thanks!
---
Been using it a few days and no issues here, XB1 if it matters
---
happens all the time to me...i often feel like armor is useless. happens even in power armor.
---
Had to wear both hat and outfit for credit.
---
My friend has a Grognak outfit. He‚Äôs hoping it counts. I had already assumed any Halloween set would count but wasn‚Äôt sure what everything they counted was.
---
Exactly, and if it means I'll keep getting free dlcs, eventually, and other stuff than I'm ok with some people spending extra :)
---
Yeah, but FO4 was a decently solid rpg, if full of bugs on release. FO76 eradicated the Roleplay aspect. It's now an as action shooter with a few RPG gaming elements.
---
Honestly, I think Todd considers the bugs part of the Skyrim experience now.
---
Are they worth it tho? This will probably be patched and I kind of want them
---
This is a game I'll beat which takes 25 hours and probably never play again. It's no skyrim. The character talents are a bit lack luster. I see no reason to play other than the story. The side quest are fairly dull too.
---
Ah man that sucks.
---
Are there still people that think this game was anything other than an obvious cash grab?
---
Also I have a wonderful investment opportunity for those people too, DM me
---
You aren't following what I'm saying. This means that there could be all 24 on a public server, AND the 8 people in the private instance. That's way as of right now there is no way to prevent friends from joining your private instance.
---
Not always true some companies sell out to epic or go in hard on investment and then that money keeps the lights on but they see very little of the sales until the loan and the interest is paid back.
---
I'm looking forward to that.
---
(I'm also looking forward to nuking it).
---
I'm not Todd, that's my dad :) if you want I can send you a Nuka Cola power armor helmet! Do yourself a favor and put it on and take a bunch of deep breaths!
---
Damn, I've been having bad luck in NW lately
---
250+
---
thx.  I thought it was a bug, so have left it empty.   Will have to restock next time I'm at camp.
---
How many ways can you kick a tire?
---
And you'll have a pink skin with bats for it from NW. But i'll still use my pimp BE golden handmade.
---
Apparently I play a lot like you. I have a level 62 shotgunner and a level 6 gunslinger. The two worst guns in the game. And I absolutely love it. I've explored so little of the map and have never even seen the SBQ or the Flatwoods Monster. I've certainly never finished any of the big quest lines!
---
I play The Sims. The more I think about First, the less annoyed I am by it. I mean, I pay for the game again every time I buy a full expansion pack for the Sims. Is it worth it? That depends who you ask. My husband says no. I think it absolutely is.
---
Like with The Sims, Fallout 76 has a limited story, lots of building, and a sandbox world to explore. I have to eat every so often. Thank god I don't have to use the washroom.
---
I guess what I am saying is that a game doesn't have to be complex and drowning in complex systems to be a game that people enjoy. It doesn't matter what you spent. Could you afford it? Do you enjoy it? Then it's worth it.
---
This isn't a court of law üòÇüòÇ stop being a baby and look it up yourself like an adult.
---
Every game bethesda launches is a buggy mess. That is not a vision of art, it is a refusal to beta test your games. Bethesda's main selling point is exactly the rpg element, it always has been. The reason outer worlds is so hyped is because they showed how it can and should be done. The hack and slash came in not because it was an artistic vision, it is because it is easy and they knew they would get away with it.
---
Also, ill be vocal all i want. The game industry is getting fucked over sideways by corporate greed, so when a developer makes a good game without trying to milk every penny is sure as hell am goimg to be vocal about it.
---
Creation club IS. PAID. MODS.
---
The point here is they ignore fixing the damn game they released repeatedly, BUT WE'LL GIVE YOU THE THING YOU DID NOT ASKED FOR, PAID. FUCKING. MODS.
---
Bethesda is dead to me.
---
Meanwhile, I close my eyes during horror movies. I hate October. lol
---
Good job man, 20 years from now when every single game has a paid subscription, you can look back and say "I helped!"
---
Cryolators can be pretty nice for the Queen fight. I have a Bloodied aim damage faster reload I used occasionally til I got an explosive cryolator.
---
Using VATS helps. It seems to condense all the pellets into one projectile and extend the effective range. The same is true for aiming, minus the single damage number.  You‚Äôll get max damage a little further out.
---
I‚Äôm only about 20 levels into a shotgun build, but experimentation is kinda my schtick.  Suppressors are also bad. Do everything you can to improve accuracy and range numbers when you‚Äôre at a crafting bench.
---
Dude give up, you haven‚Äôt played the game, you‚Äôre wrong.
---
Putting non-cosmetic items items behind a paywall might be the worst decision they've made, but it is nowhere near as bad as the norm of other publishers.
---
It is almost like Bethesda is the only developer and publisher (the developer and publisher are 2 different branches) that people know, when the actual company they should be blaming is Zenimax, which is Bethesda's parent company.
---
Don't get me wrong, I really dislike the addition of the scrapbox as a paid item.
---
I wasn‚Äôt saying you were at all, sorry if it came out that way. I said that based on threads here and other places saying to target them. 
---
Is It pricey? Kind of but it‚Äôs way cheaper than going out on one weekend night to a club or bar... or a football or baseball game... life is expensive! 
---
I‚Äôm a single full time dad with 2 kids... I spend $100 at the grocery store almost every time I go...lol (yeah I‚Äôm not rich either and work)
---
There‚Äôs people who have to rent a space to store their motor homes they don‚Äôt use or use a few days/week a year... they pay over $100 a month for enjoyment for a few days...
---
Games on average cost $60 and up. 
---
ESO plus is almost identical to Fallout 1st... I saw this coming 200+ days ago... not kidding... here‚Äôs my post: 
---
Every game has been a broken buggy mess. Even with the UOFO4 patch from the modders, fallout 4 was still a broken buggy mess. It's the nature of the Creation Engine. It produces the most vast, interactive game worlds, but all of that data is prone to bugs.
---
&gt;So anyone wanting more of a game they enjoy is bad even though they work and earn money to buy something they want, since their opinion is different you feel the need to trash it all... how mature...
---
You were incorrect on your assumption of my reasoning. Hence my use of the term
---
&gt;Not always true some companies sell out to epic
---
Didn't Obsidian get screwed when Take Two cut a deal with the devil ahem.. excuse me I mean Epic on the Outer Worlds.
---
Because money and most mainstream devs and publishers want all of your money, not just part of it.
---
I look at it kind of like Fallout 4 with friends and I‚Äôm hoping once Wastelanders drops the world expands and there are more quests
---
It supports mods just like fo4 which is still an extremely popular game thanks to modders.
---
I agree....the fixer is even better now tho, imo. So its still taking a back seat
---
Dude I have totally played the game, you are wrong.
---
I was in your exact position too last week.
---
Played since the beta up until December and then got bored and didn‚Äôt touch it until last week.
---
I had 8 caps, was overencumbered, and had like 1 stimpack and a broken shotgun.
---
What did I do? Started selling a bunch of shit I didn‚Äôt need.
---
Posted on this sub how to get more caps and all the suggestions were to sell everything you didn‚Äôt need and I did, I started getting caps and I started doing events, got plans and caps and I have 2900 as of now (and I still buy a ton of shit)
---
So yeah, try getting caps first and with that do some events.
---
You‚Äôll get really good weapons too.
---
Mostly using them to finish the story if you can call it a story and find plans. Since got tired of hitting swarms of high level creatures because of the the eat, shit, piss, sleep fallout 76 folks that seem to do nothing else but play this 24/7 since last november.
---
You're thinking of it the wrong way.
---
 Its more like they are paying for a month of a service that happens to also be discounted to 1 dollar. Or are you someone who thinks people who use the free 30 days of Amazon prime are also "scumbags" scamming multi million dollar companies?
---
What are you looking to do?
---
yOu aRe WrOnG
---
Yeah, some people like getting kicked in the balls repeatedly.
---
Mods can fix all that. Look at what modders have done in fo4.
---
It doesn't even matter if they control Epic or not. The fact they're a shareholder at all means they benifet when people purchase their products, and china is the second last place you should be supporting.
---
Aaaand now the conspiracy theories start. 
---
Fallout 1st sucks. Fallout 76 is still a good game. Not everyone is as single-minded as you are.
---
silence bethesdrone.
---
Apparently a million, but like my situation, it doesnt seem to fix anything
---
Marsupial and Backpack are my go to for standard travel
---
Oh! So it dosent start untill midnight tonight!?
---
Go pay $100 for a membership to a broken game.
---
Cool story bro.
---
" Guarentee this will be downvoted by Bethesda PR as well"
---
Well that didn't age well...
---
Absolutely love my vampire VATS lever. Been using since level 50  got a tse handmade that is amazing  then my tse gatling
---
This sub, and the general Fallout sub, have become a karma whore's wet dream over the past week. Just post some variation of "fuck Bethesda" or "I'm done with this game" and watch those upvotes roll in.
---
I'm not defending Bethesda or anything, but it's beyond ridiculous now. I mean, I got the outrage the day it was announced, but it's almost a week later now and people are still making new posts like they're the first person to be outraged about it or something. I get that people are pissed, but after the billionth post about how someone is never going to play another Bethesda game again (yeah, right), it just becomes grandstanding for the approval of the baying mob.
---
One of the worst things about this whole shitshow is how The Outer Worlds has been dragged into it. There's barely a post in that sub that doesn't include some form of attack on Bethesda and Fallout. Hell, even the Obsidian devs have said it's disappointing that the game they poured their heart and soul into is being used as a stick to beat another developer with.
---
People need to get over it. Either play the game (with or without the sub), or just move on and do something else. It's plainly obvious that the devs aren't responding to the posts here, so what's the fucking point in carrying on with it aside from whoring for upvotes and bullying anyone who doesn't tow the line? I mean the fact that people are actually being griefed in-game because they dared to pay for FF shows just how ridiculous this whole issue has become.
---
I get that people don't like what Beth have done, but being a cunt with other people over it doesn't make you a hero. Two wrongs, and all that.
---
The other comment said 12 PM EDT which is one hour
---
thank you for that post. its fresh to read some posts like yours and not all these "this will happen/this is bad/why its p2w" and so on.  
---
people are just hating like they always did. you can have the same fun with or without 1st.
---
fun thing: i read often about someone trying out the game, realising its not as bad as media or some redditors write and fall in love with it.
---
sad thing: websites stating the 1st is necessary to play the game (like i.e. wow) are just writing bullshit and their authors should be reminded as drama writers instead of real news.
---
That's how weak your evidence is? Ok. Understood.
---
Legendaries do occasionally spawn at workshop defense events. I've had a few times were more than one spawned.
---
They already have a chance of spawning through out the waves.
---
Right EDT.....didnt notice that. Thx
---
Yeah but now you don‚Äôt have a budget anymore
---
Eso plus is the same thing but eso actually has stuff to do and dlc that comes with it and it‚Äôs a game that works. It‚Äôs bizarre they‚Äôre selling a sub on fallout 76 because the base game just isn‚Äôt there yet
---
Where do we get legendary fixers?
---
Nope, it doesn't.
---
Tbh I dont even know. I just wanna enjoy the game again üòÇ
---
It‚Äôs my opinion, not an assumption, I‚Äôm also not incorrect since it is my opinion and your statement is also just an opinion and ‚Äúhence‚Äù why I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre wrong. 
---
There is however a huge difference between an opinion and an assumption... if you want to talk about ‚Äúterms‚Äù...
---
Okay you have my interest. I have a bffr handmade and I'm actively trying to make a trade for the famed  B25/25 handmade. However I'm sure my chances of getting an assault rifle are a heck of a lot better...
---
Good one
---
I didn‚Äôt really pay attention to budget since I just wanted to build. And since I was using workshop resources it was technically a free experiment :)
---
There are some cheaters, however someone spec'd in correctly for the weapon can really do some damage
---
for example, a headshot with a scoped lever or hunting is gonna be a oneshot down/kill 99% of the time
---
id say every outfit that its not just pure clothes.
---
Ya but eso cheats u outta that dlc by having ‚Äústory dlc‚Äù like morrowind and summerset for $40
---
verified. just scrapped handmades, looking for perforating mags.higher up the mod list the less chance you will get anything at all. echo this for gauss. It would appear some mods have to be bought from a vendor to complete a full list. If I need steel, then I pick up every hunting ,combat, assault etc rifle, and scrap them (literally 1000's) , and still have empty slots on their mod list.
---
interestingly (kilercuts below) , I do have a prime reciever for hunting rifle that was learned from scrapping and not from a drop or vendor.
---
I've got many weapons for different situation across two different characters. My heavy gunner runs with BE90 Gatling Gun (excellent ammo efficiency to kill most of the mobs), for V94 runs I use Primed B2515r 50 Cal (needen non-explosive gun not to kill myself in close quarters fights), while for SBs and SBQ I use Primed BE25 50 Cal.
---
My stealth sniper uses both B25 Fixer and B2525 Handmade for most mobs and Primed BE25 Lever for SBs and SBQ fights.
---
I have a level 62 shotgunner, but I wanted to do pistols, so that one is level 6...
---
Yeah, i feel like a lot of that has to do with who actually shot first and servers catching up. Happens all the time.....or he go head shots
---
Oh shit, kinda wish posts could go below zero on the downvotes, this one would really be a contender for "least popular post in the history of the sub".
---
BFFR Fixer
---
My BE 10mm smg! absolutely underrated
---
I bet everything seems salty when you live in the ocean
---
How homesick does this game make you? (I'm in Mobile AL, but grew up in southeastern Kentucky, and for me it's very).
---
You funded the game when you bought it.
---
That‚Äôs what I was hoping for but couldn‚Äôt find anything specific on the website.
---
The uproar right now isn't about how bad the game is. That ship sailed earlier this year and over time we actually got a decent game out of FO76 (albeit really flawed and buggy). There are quite a few of us who have been playing the game despite all of its flaws, but Bethesda decided they needed to milk us for even more money by doing ridiculous shit with the atom shop (terrible pricing, unnecessary bundling of items, charging for items that should be available in-game, etc.). So for the last couple of months fans have been getting fed up. And then Bethesda decided to drop this Fallout 1st shit on us where they expect us to pay more than the price of the game each year to get access to "private" servers, which aren't actually private. And then they shove a bunch of items behind the service so you have to pay for them. 
---
So they pushed out an incredibly flawed product, spent the last year releasing super-buggy updates every couple of weeks, try to nickle and dime us on stuff that should've free to begin with (fridges, for one), and then have the audacity to ask us to give them money in exchange for a half-assed private server. 
---
&gt; The best time to play a game like FO76 is right now, because you will  only run into people trying to have a good time, who can look past the  BS and just play the game they purchased :)
---
This subreddit is *full* of people who are "trying to have a good time" and "look past the BS". We've been doing that for the past year and what you're seeing now is the straw that broke the camel's back. I find this entire thing to be incredibly frustrating because I've spent so much time defending this game and playing it and enjoying it, but Bethesda has finally pissed me off enough that I don't even want to bother with the game anymore.
---
Starts at noon
---
Pretty much only use my J/FFR/FR Auto Railway and J/FFR/25 Handmade. The Railway kills a Behemoth almost instantly.
---
Then the time to be mad about it was a year ago when it was reported (And yes people talked about it).  It was always going to have a fee, it was always going to be hosted by bethesda, and it was always going to have a price. 
---
Why isn‚Äôt it right?  You don‚Äôt need to have the private world to play with your friends. The subscription is not required. And really, only oner person needs the subscription anyways, non-subscribers can join in. So you and your friends could just have one subscription you all split.  You could even share the junk stash if youu really wanted too.  
---
And the US price is on par with other services, but again, you don‚Äôt need the service.  If you and your friends were playing together before, you can still play together now. 
---
At $13 US the atoms it comes with is a pretty good deal as well, which again in US more than covers it‚Äôs cost.  The service was never intended to be free for private servers
---
Game.  Not DLC.
---
Are you seriously suggesting that free content that was promised and has now been delayed until early 2020 so that they could try to get people to pay $100 for fundamental services is the game being "alive"?
---
Yea but it's not shit though
---
xD I love you &lt;3
---
Dunno, many of those games are years old.  For example im closing in on 2k hours of warframe, since 2013.  1k hours in under under year sounds like someone that just fallen into a work, sleep, game rut.
---
Not got any dlc tho have you? Plus DLC was supposed to be free according to Hines.
---
And they sort of are. I was full on board when people didnt want the giants space express bug fixed, it was much too hilarious.
---
However, for every fun bug in skyrim i have seen 10 annoying or downright game breaking. And they re-released that game over and over. Fallout 4 was a decent enough rpg, yes, but is that not an awfull thing to say about a franchise this big? For example, one of the biggest problems i have woth FO4 is the dialoque system. It was toned down to make it simpler, that was an active choice to remove a rpg element. Shouldn't the leader in the rpg market actually have the lead? 
---
Im just hoping outer worlds will be decent enough competition to shake Bethesda enough to wake them up.
---
I welcome any and all downvotes.
---
Oh see, you just need to put more scrap in your box.  Once you have enough in there you‚Äôve won.  Oh, and don‚Äôt forget to put your camp down somewhere, that‚Äôs also a required element to Win.
---
Totally agree. And they keep saying they‚Äôre improving the CAMP build restrictions but I‚Äôm not seeing that.
---
Damn I‚Äôve just not been that lucky then :p
---
I love myself too
---
Very wholesome.
---
Also yeah, the robot dance was definitely implemented as if it had the hoes mad song to go with it
---
Nobody wants to spend an hour collecting materials any time they want to craft something, though.
---
Haha wow! So creative! You‚Äôre hilarious dude you should pursue comedy
---
That's not a discussion, that's bait.
---
Lol what a kissass. How much have you sucked them off so far? Games a disgrace to the franchise.
---
Sure I have.  And DLC IS free.  Freeloaders and ungratefuls aren't paying a dime towards it.
---
Completely different games. I have my own criticisms for ow but that doesn‚Äôt belong on this sub. FO76 is good for what it is just like OW is good for what it is.
---
Ahh that makes sense!
---
It's definitely very surreal!  Now, I don't live TOO far away (northern VA), but it's always great to go back home.  I just decided to take the extreme scenic route this time! I know of several places in SE Kentucky (I grew up in Hurricane, WV) and my best friend is originally from Ashland.
---
I've had a ghoul defence where 1-2 legendaries spawned per wave, for 4 waves
---
I rushed the post and didn‚Äôt explain too well. What I mean is rockstar tries to force you into public lobbies that have no balance, to do the highest paying content that you don‚Äôt need multiple people to even start. There happens to be an exploit that they cannot patch that allows you into empty public lobbies which is the ONLY reason i played that game as long as I did, but obviously that wasn‚Äôt rockstars intention.
---
All good, I've been replaying Bloodborne and The Evil Within 2 for the spooks lately. And hoping Death Stranding doesn't disappoint. Maybe MHW:Iceborne, still sucks to see FO76 going downhill though. Would love some creepy Halloween events, but I that ships kinda sailed. Lots of good stuff coming up though.
---
Lol didn't read the title at first and when i saw the pictures i was thinking "Where the hell he found this beautiful place to set a camp?" :)
---
Instigating 50 Cal explosive. It's like garlic, it works on just about everything.
---
Except fallout 76 is shit for what it is, literally rust does everything FO76 does but not shit and you can host private servers for free and the game isnt shit
---
You forgot the whole set your own rules and modding aspect.
---
I already paid for the content I have. I haven't freeloaded anything. If anyone is freeloading its bethesda asking you to pay monthly for something you already bought.
---
Whitesprings is not the #1 target, sbq is, but i'm sure for the  duration of this event it will be
---
Lmao you just won this sub
---
It‚Äôs what good companies do. When their customers are upset they go quiet for a week and hope the problem solved itself.
---
Instigating Lever, AAE Handmade and my good ol' AA Plasma Flamer Yay!!
---
legitimately
---
LOL! With "extra jack-o-lanterns" mod turned on!
---
They are dedicated sessions run on Bethesda's servers. They are looking at giving people more control over their private worlds but what that will be has not been said yet
---
Curious, what‚Äôs the deal with the whole ‚Äúfreeloaders‚Äù thing? Is it a term used to describe those who don‚Äôt have the 1st subscription?
---
I would hold off selling anything if you're expecting outer worlds to be your new FO76. Outer worlds isnt like a fallout/elder scrolls in the sense where you'll sink 500 hours into it, its fairly small. Its very good, just definitely small.
---
I've said multiple times it's likely to happen - unless BGS does something to prevent it (in order to allow lower levels the ability to participate in the event)  
---
given nuke zone last a couple hours, it would hose low level access to the event...and since there is reportedly a bonus for being in costume, would also mess up that reward...
---
When did I ever even say anything about private setvers? Or make any assumptions or statements in general?
---
These are great. Thank you
---
That does not mean they have anything to do with the sub
---
I'm all about sweet nourishing gruel!
---
Jesus. I don‚Äôt frequent this sub, and honestly just came to take a peak at the garbage fire going on, but this might be the most genuinely heartbreaking comment I‚Äôve seen yet.
---
may also be ps4 server related or ps4+. Only with 76 \_ craps on your conrtoller and can also crap on your b/b router, requiring complete reset.
---
Good one? It's a fact that your using it wrong.  But go with that weak response if it's all you got left lol
---
BE Plasma Gatling
---
You're being vocal against the wrong people then. You should be against of fans that's are okay with microtransactions not the companies that put them in then. There is a demand for that kind of thing which is why company decide to include them with there games. 
---
While you may consider it milking, it's also an entirely ignorable piece of a game. I don't buy any loot crates in a game I think don't offer something of value back to the player. 
---
Every game Bethesda releases IS a buggy mess but this is the first time people really truly care about it. Skyrim is still, the most played game on there list. Fallout 3 is 2nd I'm sure. It the engine works for what they need it for but this was a huge dream of Good Howard's, to play Fallout cooperatively. That right there is the vision of art. It was beta tested, by many people (I was one of them!) They address bugs and fix them as they can, it's the nature of the engine. But like I said before, it's super expensive to make a new engine. It would delay new games years! We wouldn't see Starfield for at least 4 years and who knows where the gaming industry then. It's not always about play testing, because they do enough of it. It's just about handling issues as they come up. No company, person or game is perfect. 
---
If nothing else before makes sense, then I want you to understand one other factor too. It's not corporate greed, it's a market that we the players are creating for the company to cater to. I'm not saying be completely silent, but you more by silent going "huh that game isn't gonna be good" and then not buying it. Instead, the internet is extremely loud and forcing the game industry to bend to it's fan when the fans don't know what they want entirely. Some games are fine to have microtransactions, some are not? That's what I see at least.
---
Not at all. If you arent running bloodied or junkies then 110 is hard to hit with auto weapons so bloody mess still has a purpose.
---
Wow, bootlicking much
---
Maybe people would have actually supported the game had it not been an utter shitshow on launch
---
I wanted it to be good, desperately I did, I found every reason to like but then it was dissapointment after dissapointment from Bethesda in terms of fixing issues, and handling balance and greifing 
---
Then breaking the promise of the Atomic shop only being purely cosmetic
---
Then charging a ridiculous amount for First which is plagued by issues on top of the fact it's full of lies
---
The servers are recycled instead of reset/fresh so you'll spawn in with areas looted already
---
There's no privacy settings so friends can randomly join unannounced, and then friends of those friends can join unnanounced and uninvited
---
And on top of that the game is still filled with so many bugs theyed need the Starship Troopers to handle them all.
---
All in all
---
Like at it's core I think 76 could be great. Amazing concept, amazing world design, the enemies are cool, well designed and interesting in how they mingle with the world at large and I think the west Virginia wasteland is immensely fun just to walk around in
---
But 
---
The fact is the game has issues, big ones at that
---
And until Bethesda addresses them I can't really see myself getting back into the game too much. It's not even the issue of no NPCs I couldnt careless about wastelanders I just want the game itself to be in a better state.

Try the trade subreddit, starts with an M and stops with 76.  They have a discord. It's a place I go to for legitimate conversation

Shit everybody that knew anything used that method if you had to grind ...and a couple of others that would get patched within 24 hours too lol...

---
I found this
---
Not at all. What I'm saying is at $60, FO76 at it's current state is more than a complete 'experience' as far as an investment in entertainment. To me the expectations of 'moar moar moar and everything free for life' is absolutely ludicrous. Regardless of what had been previously stated or implied. Like my tl;dr said, I bought The Order 1886 at launch for $60 and that was a 4 hour game with absolutely no replay value other than experiencing the story again. And the story itself was very forgettable. That is an example of what I believe to be a lacking experience in relation to the amount I invested. 
---
I'm poor. I've always been poor. That has deeply shaped what I believe to be 'fair'. And I just don't think expecting people to spend their lives working on something without some form of compensation will ever be fair.
---
YUP. Some of us are waiting out the shitstorm here before posting again. A few years ago I fell in love with FO4 and went looking for people who enjoyed the series... the negativity in r/Fallout was repulsive, had to join the specific sub for FO4. Now it feels like all those people have come over here to gleefully rage when... just don't buy the subscription? It's almost identical to ESO's subscription, which I think of as one of the better models out there, so I'm baffled. I kind of enjoy inventory management as one of the puzzles of the game so I am waiting until Wastelanders to really evaluate the sub, but paying for storage of some kind is always a mtx these days... thinking of ESO, GW2 - heck WoW and GW2 even have character boosters that remove leveling.
---
$22 a month? Regardless of any good or bad it's  only $13 a month.
---
Thank you so much!

Oh no! They made a game that's isnt a copy paste of every other RPG! How dare they?!
---
Is it one of those things that's ubiquitous on PC, but not on consoles? I mostly play Xbox these days and haven't touched my PC guy since Fasnacht.
---
God i love this post
---
So play something else and quit bitching
---
&gt; Minecraft can let 8 people on a p2p server and yes they have to keep track of everything in the world.  
---
You are right about the player count it is a max of 8 players. The 4 person limit was from the PS3 version of the game. 
---
&gt; Minecraft is far more bigger then fallout. I don't belive you understand. 
---
Minecraft also has a lot of delays when moving to the point you can literally hit an invisible wall while chunks load. And then has delays when mining a block and picking it up. Even just playing 2 people when I'm not host I can mine some iron or coal and then there is a second or two before I pick up what I just mined. A long with an occasional rubber band effect. And while I've never done more then 4 people at a time even on pS4 the results only get worse. 
---
And you are correct that Minecraft can have big worlds. Not sure if they are bigger then 76 as I've never really tried to walk from one end to the other. However a key difference is that with Minecraft you can only manipulate 1 block at a time.  Mobs only spawn around the player in random locations and have very basic programing. The game doesn't have to calculate the trajectory of  a lot of projectiles.   
---
There are key differences and each game and system is slightly different. A direct comparison between them all is nearly impossible because of hundreds of details.  Other games like Ark and 7 days severely restrict max player count and distance from host limits.
---
I'm not worried, I'm just saying
---
It's dang close. I mean, even the asylum outfits count as costumes!
---
Why suddenly? At no point did I think the game was enjoyable. Im also not telling anyone what to do or to stop enjoying it, I was just pointing out that - to me - it is indeed mindboggling that some people enjoy this game so much. 
---
Nothing wrong with enjoying a game, I just dont get how one could in this case, thats all there is to it. I only dislike those that spend money beyond the initial price because it supports bad practices.
---
I agree elswyr should come with it but I still think it‚Äôs more about how you can play eso without eso plus. It takes time to go back to town and put shit in the bank and sell stuff but you can get enough space to keep everything you‚Äôll ever need without paying real money. In fallout that‚Äôs not really the case you‚Äôre constantly having to manage inventory. 
---
Also, deconstructing armor and weapons should give you the material you need to repair armor and weapons. Not really relevant but just one more thing about fallout that sucks
---
&gt;I think you are looking at it from the wrong angle. Nobody asked Bethesda to pay for additional servers. When they wanted "private servers", they wanted to be able to stand up servers on their own, that wasn't connected to the public play-space in any way. Then they could   
---
&gt;mod  
---
&gt; the game.
---
And that still costs money and people are complaining about the price as one of the main complaints.
---
So you are praising this game for its unique quests?
---
Nice list of the rewards in there too!
---
Do you have any mods installed? 
---
this happened to me aswell, because of mods
---
Tie between my my BE gatling plasma and my VE gatling plasma. Depends on the situation.
---
Thanks! :)
---
We remove posts that are obvious trolling or baiting, we don't remove valid opinions
---
Is this a court of law? Are you not mature enough to google info yourself? Or is sticking your head in sand a family pastime for you?
---
You were doing it right when you weren‚Äôt playing. Go back to that!
---
So why is it a good thing that a game have theses 21 extremely common quests?
---
Been so excited for the rewards all week!
---
That I agree with. Even tho i like this game a lot. Inventory management is kinda ass
---
(whistles) Over *200* outfits count as costumes according to dataminers, and you get a objective during Mischief Night to put on a costume
---
So basically just keep switching outfits until that objective is completed
---
you need to get and learn the plan from another player or encrpytid, then it puts the fixer in the drop pool for purveyor.  at that point its all down to luck.
---
It will be nuked, devs said weeks ago pa+costume hat should net you specific reward
---
And since when do we listen to hack jame jurnos
---
You paid for the base game.  If you haven't purchased anything past that, then what can I say, but hey, you're welcome.
---
I gave you the link because it contains undisputed recorded video evidence of all the bugs and problems with the game. Most people would be happy when such evidence is provided. The reason I'm not wasting time describing them to you in my own words is because I already knew right from the start what you're trying to do here. And I'm not falling for it. The only reason I'm replying to you is to let you know that. Also, I just realized that I *have* actually already answered your question using own words. Bugs and problems with the game. That's my definition. Want a more in-detail description? Want to see examples? Check the video. I have entertained you for long enough and now it's up to you if yoy want to have a serious discussion related to the topic of the thread, or if you want to continue with your ad hominem arguing and personal attacks in an attempt to provoke a response from me.
---
Because I can moderate on a phone?
---
Well, that would make them worse off than before if that is the case. If someone has paid money for a service that they stated is part of the package and are no longer going to provide, then there is a legal issue there. More so, if someone has paid for a year.
---
Thanks I guess lol
---
Thank you, didn't expect this to blow tbh lmao
---
They built a for us. They sold us this house. The storage has been horrible and the pluming was bad from the beginning and we have been using the detached garage, however it's our house and we could work around all of this and still work together to make an amazing home. Odd, there are locked doors around here, and I swear this house should be bigger for what we paid. But it should be OK because our builder said they would keep updating for free!
---
Last week they came in and said any updates to the house are delayed, "Oh, forgot to tell you, there IS an attached garage on this house and we can definitely fix the plumbing but it's going to be a monthly fee. Until then you can't use the better bathroom, but anyone in your house who pays for it can. You can even hang out in the bathroom for an extra 15 min after they are gone"
---
Now the vault boy is sitting in the garage that has more room than an Amazon warehouse giving me that stupid smile because he knows that he played me for a year so he could make me understand that either I waste the year I invested, pay him and then go hang out with Activision-Blizzard, or play the game and understand that your house will NEVER be what you hoped, or what they said they would do. No contract will help and they have nothing but time on their hands. 
---
What they are doing now is gearing up for loss in my opinion. They realize that they can't justify the cost for the game, the lack of sales and now the number of problems they have, so in about 1 year this game will be a free download. They will do like Destiny did, unlock everything the first year and make it free with the option to do 1st for a more whole gaming experience. They will stay quiet for the next 3-6 weeks because that's how long it takes for us to forget, then black Friday, focus is on crazy turkey and 75 inch screens for $14 and just like Blizzard-Activision they will just start talking again like we are stupid and don't remember. All they did is release this so they could clean the mess up before Xmas. 
---
Sorry, just an guy sad because all of his heroes tuned out to be liars. 
---
Greed. It never changes.
---
That's all there is. Base game or base game on a monthly fee.
---
Asking for proof is heart breaking?  Strange world you live in.
---
For my main (stealth sniper):
---
Instigating lever is my go to weapon. Also have a prime TSE Gatling with reduced weight that I use when I need to be Tanky. And have a zealots Gatling plasma with reduced weight for SBQ.
---
For my bloodied alt (melee/heavy):
---
Bloodied minigun
---
Bloodied assaultron blade +swing speed +strength
---
And just last night got a bloodied explosive combat shotgun that I think I‚Äôm going to love.
---
For my undecided alt build:
---
Vampires explosive Gatling... it‚Äôs only level 40 but let‚Äôs this forty something alt easily tank up on ghoul mobs
---
That'll cost you $14.99
---
You didn't specify you wanted a Handmade
---
Playing a game for 400 hours and complaining that it's boring is like saying there was a hair in your pizza after you ate the whole thing, a salad, two orders of breadsticks, and 3 glasses of soda.
---
When has that EVER stopped them from putting it in the shop? [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/a289ai/content_removed_from_76_to_be_resold_on_the_atom/) is a thread that was posted 11 months ago...
---
With enough Atom shop high end TVs, jacuzzis, and freezers F76 will eventually transform into a Sims game.
---
Freeloaders would be anyone wanting/complaining about/enjoying any new content past the base game who hasn't used the Atomic shop or Fallout 1st.  They want something for nothing.
---
Because they don‚Äôt even have these basic quests. They have horde, defend the thing, fetch and escort a robot.
---
tuesdays are also when the vault raid switches. it's probably the new event being added as well.
---
You can get them from the purveyor, but only if you know the plan. The Fixer is a combat rifle though, not an Assault Rifle.
---
And I was one of the moderators, Bethesda had no hand in this sub at all
---
Yeah, that icon. You pick it (annoyingly) in the atom shop. It'll often default to the last one you purchased. I think the only one that's 1st exclusive is the NCR ranger one.
---
That link simply shows me want I'd pay, $12.99 but its cool. I saw somewhere that it was like ‚Ç¨100 which not equal to $100 so theres that fuckery at least.
---
I only have 2 learned so far, so i have a ways to go. I was just surprised i didn't get even one.
---
I believe they might be doing a staggered restart of servers during the hour or two leading up to the event because the Whitesprings had no decorations for the event.
---
Same, need more decorations for my camp! You on later? Xbox?
---
I work at a machine shop making setting blocks for windows. I honestly wish I worked for a gaming company.
---
1) what 
---
2) what again, I wasn't arguing with OP
---
It would be nice if they would make the whole game more dangerous, make Deathclaws and Scorchbeasts an actual threat and nights darker. We can always dream!
---
I just don‚Äôt like how much screen space it takes up compared to my handmade.
---
Really?  The game as it is today is exactly what was released at launch?   There's nothing new?  Wow.
---
How did that approach work out for survival? People left until the servers were ghost towns and they shut them down.
---
I remember someone nuking Helvetia when the Fasnacht parade was on. It was chaos all of the low level players were wiped out. Seemed a bit off considering no one ever nukes Helvetia at any other time but the mass panic emote that erupted from all of us while we waited for the nuke to hit was an experience üôà
---
You do have a point. And for some of it is a good price but the unlimited junk storage should have been added way earlier and they even said that if they increased the storage of your stash box the game would crash yet the junk stash box is unlimited and it hasn‚Äôt crashed peoples games alone. And about the private servers thing, if they do include mods later on you will have to pay for them which you shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for access to mods.
---
&gt; When did I ever even say anything about private setvers? Or make any assumptions or statements in general? 
---
When you said
---
&gt; Always loved how this sub showed it's maturity by claiming anyone with a genuine issue is having a tantrum. 
---
Because these are issues people have been talking about and questions I have been asking with every single person deflecting away from the questions and out right refusing to answer or they out right say they assumed it would be free because Bethesda mentioned about game content being free.  Which is true because wastelander will be a free update like all other new content updates.  
---
Perhaps you should understand what is being talked about before trying to make a snide comment. It does kind of help you not look silly.
---
You didn't pay enough.
---
If you aren't going to provide a link could you at least type them 21 quests out?
---
There's tons of good stuff coming in 2020.
---
Ha...I‚Äôm just joking.  I think they are flooded with lot‚Äôs of requests for which that system is not meant.  Just move on to something else and try not to think about it for a week and then contact again.
---
For a basic list? Pretty often.
---
now this one IS a gem...sold mine...was stupid.
---
they are more or less already doing that with Fallout 1st and private sessions
---
it's your life but I'd call it a waste of time.
---
Yes most private servers are completely isolated from the official servers which allows much more extensive modding because there is no cross play.
---
Ya, it‚Äôs killer. 
---
Also hyper-expensive
---
You act like "this community" is some sort of policing/governing agency that just lets things happen. You do realize that people on Reddit do not make up the majority of players for video games, right? 
---
Fortnite has, reportedly, 250 million accounts, but less than 2 million on the subreddit. So, less than 1 percent. Borderlands 3 sold 5 million copies in the first week, the subreddit has a little over 250,000. That's around 5 percent, but that is only week one sales, the actual number is lower. Also, as of March, Fallout 76 was Zenimax's third best selling game ever, behind only Skyrim and Fallout 4. I can't find any hard data on sales, but I saw an estimate of over 5 million copies. If even 1/10th still play the game, that's 500,000 players, double the number of subscribers to the subreddit.
---
Also, look at in-game evidence. People are all over the place with Ranger armor, doing robot dances and having 1st Player icons. Go back a little further, and see so many camps with scrapbots when "the community" deemed it ridiculous and a step toward P2W. Not everyone shared that view that is echoed on Reddit ad nauseam.
---
I know that's a bitter pill to swallow, because everyone wants to feel like they have a voice and are being heard. But, the fact of the matter is for all games, Fallout or not, Reddit is not the majority. This is just another social media outlet for the company, like Facebook and Twitter. The "community" that lets Bethesda get away with things are the actual paying customers that actually buy their products. And, from my own personal experience over the past week, people are still playing. People are still buying Atoms and are subscribing to 1st. The echo chamber can say what it wants, but at the end of the day, they are going to listen to the paying customers over people who outrage online and end sentences with "lmao".

d/u shouldn't make a difference, i ran fine on a 3mb down 500kb up line. (satilite)  my friend currently runs fine on a 2mb down 1mb up.
---
right now my line is a 160mb down, 10mb up, and last night i had hit reg problems
---
I lost all my Junk on my main guy. No big deal Ill just replace it. Just Love Private Servers dont ever what to play in public servers again
---
I'm 95% certain that consoles would not be able to handle hosting a private server for this game specifically. Too many moving parts. Maybe it will eventually be a PC function. If they released an "unlocked" version of the game that gave players the ability to host a server and edit the code. I think for us to get the Moda we've been used to, they would have to have an entirely separate client just for the modded version of the game.
---
My Ghoul Slaying Gamma gun is probably my favorite legendary weapon I have gotten
---
Yeah but the problem there is that fallout 4 in its release was playable and didn‚Äôt have game breaking bugs like the heavy weapons bug back on the beginning.
---
Well then folk shout post it in local currency and the USD equivalent if they want to speak in terms of the USD equiv because otherwise no one but you knows where the fuck your from Narcissis.
---
Granted that is good, they have only really made the game playable. You can't really deny the game wass full of bugs and glitches. The game would crash every two minutes and enemies would T-pose till they killed you cause they couldn't take damage. Charging a full 60$ for a game that barely works is a bit much. Saying this is maybe a bit too much, but you gotta admit, the game was not playable at launch. That they now have made it playable and actually decent but are charging players for the fix. We were promised free DLC and if it continues like this, bethesda might release Wastelanders at a cost as well. If bought on release 60$, and you got it for a year. Now they add "small" microtransactions here and there and look at what the price now. 100$ a year for something we were promised for free. Just that they fixed some of what they broke doesn't really justify it.  
---
In my opinion obviouosly \^\^
---
FROSTY44AZ on Xbox. I‚Äôll for sure be on later. My friend and I will be switching from Nuclear Winter to the event so we can get as many rewards as possible
---
You mean a BR game without any anticheating mechanic?
---
That‚Äôs awesome. WV is definitely on my list to visit.
---
Is it better to have only 3 and nothing else?
---
Most of those quests being in a game aren‚Äôt a good thing - like stealth quests in a non-stealth game. You shouldn‚Äôt WANT those in game.  And most of them boil down to the elements you have above - like ‚ÄúGetting my Father‚Äôs Sword‚Äù, that‚Äôs just a fetch quest.  The long drawn out escort quests - that‚Äôs just a ‚ÄúDefend a thing‚Äù quest.  Any of the Bandits/monster quests - pretty much ‚Äúfight a horde‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm not saying the quests in FO76 are interesting (though sometimes the lore is) but rather that this list shouldn‚Äôt be used as any staple for what would make a GOOD RPG
---
Fixed. Sorry.
---
The only additions in a year are the grindy backpack scout challenges, bivs alcohol crafting which no one uses, the Sheepsquatch fetch quests and the vault raid fetch quests. For an inline game asking for an MMOs sub that's just pathetic. 
---
Absolutely no end game content has been added. At all. Zero. Once you hit end game there is nothing to do. 
---
Compared to ESO 76 is a joke. By the end of year one ESO had Craglorn, an entire endgame map with fully voiced main and side quests, dungeons, solo and multiplayer trials and numerous world bosses. 76 has you one shotting things on 2/3rds of the map and glitchy queen fights where she may just fly off the map.
---
**500 Atoms have been deposited into your account.**
---
Depends on what I'm doing.  I dont have any godroll stuff, so 
---
for most things on the ground : Vampire switchblade
---
For flying things : resolute veteran and/or AA LMG.
---
For sniping :  2 shot lever or standard Fixer
---
For events like uranium fever : executioners SMG for tagging
---
last Dec. I had a explosive flamer..wish id kept it....plasma flamer is new to me...is that new or a mod?
---
&gt; But I get called a troll and asked how it impacts me because there is no PvP.
---
LMAO! That's downright hilarious, isn't it?  This idea that "pay to win" only applies to PVP.  Uh... it's  like this. If you are in a scorched beast queen fight, and your weapon breaks, and you repair it with one click thanks to repair kits, and you later kill the queen with the weapon you just repaired,  well, guess what? THAT IS PAY TO WIN! WITH ZERO PVP INVOLVED! LOL! Oh man. 
---
I used the queen as just one example. I'm sure there's a hundred other examples I left out.
---
Nuuuuuuuuuu no nukes plz p__q)
---
Thank you!  It's a great place to visit!
---
That makes a HUGE difference. Latency is a thing for streaming games. How were you even connecting at 3/0.5 or 2/1???. That's barely enough speed to reliably stream netflix, let alone a video game.
---
160/10 is decent, with that there should be less issues with latency, as long as you are hardwired, and as long as you were actually GETTING the 160/10. During peak hours you get less of the potential bandwidth, with cable modem atleast. 
---
I have ATT Uverse. Its 300/200, and it's phenomenal. I load before everyone else, I have 0 lag from my end.
---
I wish
---
AA FFR RW 50 cal.  It has a great punch, I don't have to run around 80% dead and I won't kill myself with my own explosive damage.  I have other weapons (boodied) with higher DPS, but this gun works all the time and I only die when the game glitches.
---
"I genuinely wish I could enjoy it" ME. Gf started playing outerworlds yesterday and I haven't touched FO76 in a week. I can't be bothered to do the legendary loop/grind for no reason while the game gets updates for people that pay. Going to get the Microsoft pass tonight.
---
Correct me if im wrong and i could very well be, but what you‚Äôre saying is that despite paying up to ¬£60 to play the game, unless i were to cash out for atoms or 1st, of which the rewards aren‚Äôt really that special, most of it being cosmetics or stuff that i personally have no interest in, id be deemed cheap and undeserving of the DLC?
---
different opinions on whats wrong.
---
some of us dont mind paying to play a game.
---
others, want to play and get stuff for free
---
i just read through the list, quite frankly nothing that we don't have that's on that list will be missed.
---
Bingo. I think that's the case with a lot of people.
---
You left off Arktos and some others.  So the game today is not the same as the base game at launch.  Glad you could admit it.  I'm sure that was hard.
---
Freeloader definition is ‚Äúa person who takes advantage of others generosity without giving anything in return
---
I had the same experience with the Purveyor.
---
Bloodied. Faster Fire Rate. 50 DR while aiming.
---
Gamma Gun.
---
Right now it's my Instigating Gauss rifle
---
I don't agree - got both B25 fixer and Handmade and I feel the second, despite few less points of damage, has much better accuracy in VATS (both weapons have similar mods and are use on the same bloodied stealth shooter).
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/
---
1. You are correct. However it's been out well long  enough now that it shouldn't be that buggy
---
2. Oh that's even when occasionally exiting and trying to join a different lobby. If you stayed without changing, it could be even longer. And I'm not even talking middle of the day. This is the night while everyone plays.
---
3. I NEVER have problems with other games, only previously on a occasion with 1 other (surprise, surprise. fallout 4)
---
I don't like the term either, and I have fallout 1st. Those players bought the game at release same as us "supporters." Sure maybe some of them got the game super cheap second-hand and Bethesda didn't see a dime of their money, but quite a few bought it at release and continue to play. I do feel like I'm supporting the game, but aside from a few perks I don't think F1st should give a different level of experience. However devs need to be paid for the game to have continued support, and I really want support to be continued
---
**keep telling yourself that...**
---
I think the suggestion that there is a Bethesda PR squad on the sub. I don‚Äôt think anyone suggested it was the Mods.
---
The costing/performance of this game have been shocking from day 1, &amp; Bethesda‚Äôs responses have proven to be lies, they have done this before in Elder Scrolls (parent company ZeniMax (the Maxi Pad for investors)). So when I say these things &amp; then am told to go elsewhere, I believe there was a call last year for a separate Sub for those of us not enjoying the experience. 
---
If you mention ‚ÄúPay to Win‚Äù you are shouted down. Where any gamer knows that a larger inventory makes a massive difference &amp; if I have to explain why this leads to greater in-game currency, mobility and gear, then you are not a gamer and are likely in my option under the sway of ZeniMax and it subsidiaries.
---
No-one can enjoy paying more for a game to finally work that was over priced to begin with!
---
There‚Äôs literally one NPC that you can‚Äôt space blast in the face makes the anarchist route way more fun than fallout or Skyrim
---
Oh OK yeah a couple of events that need private servers otherwise someone will one shot you out of any rewards through shitty game design. Woo. Well done, well worth your hundred dollars a year extra. Mug.
---
Support builds love cryolators
---
For me it‚Äôs that the quests have no story. It‚Äôs show up fight leave. I‚Äôve done uranium fever 100s of times and still have no idea why I‚Äôm doing it from a quest perspective. I‚Äôm mostly commenting on the fact that they stripped out those basic elements and replaced them with nothing. 
---
Best example I can think of is the survivalist caches in honest hearts. From a mechanic perspective it‚Äôs just a scavenger hunt, like the treasure maps in 76. But from an experience perspective they are worlds apart.
---
If you're on PC, you can edit your ini files to do just that, but it will also change the color of your pip-boy light.
---
I appreciate the detailed response.
---
why not? only 87% upvoted at 5000 karma means atleast like 700 or so people downvoted
---
My very recently acquired bffr handmade. I carried my BE handmade forever, I'm shocked at how much more powerful the ffr variant is.
---
News cycle moves on and so does the outrage. At the end of the day its just some companies making games they hope people will pay for, not the end of the world.
---
&gt; ethesda has gone full evil profit Corp.
---
True to a point, but oh man this goes beyond evil monetization practices. When I read about it, I didn't think "That's evil!" I thought "Everyone at Bethesda has lost their goddamned minds." 
---
Activision and Blizzard.  To my, that's greedy. What Bethesda is doing is just pure insanity.
---
I also paid full price for the game and was shocked at the price cut in half within the week. The big Slap in the face was when Bethseda was targeting the duping glitch and citing that as the reason why we can't have mass quantities or unlimited items or scrap.... in our box. Yet now they have released an Item that gives you unlimited scrap.....behind a pay wall.   
---
So What Bethesda was really saying at launch to all the players were "YOU HAVEN'T PAID ENOUGH TO ENJOY THIS GAME" with how long they take for bug fixes and patches and how the focus was always on the ATOM shop this game has proven to be predatory. Such a shame because you know that this is a small taste of whats going to happen to Starfall or whatever it's called and Elder Scrolls series. Calling it now elder scrolls is gonna be launched buggy and you'll have to buy the patches, worst yet I'm sensing the elder scrolls is going to have a fallout 4 feel for the story...
---
Nice one, I'll give you a shout later! GT JaggersLips13
---
Check top comment\^
---
I see what you did there.
---
I don't know
---
I'd pay real life money for a real life Codsworth
---
Try not to cringe!
---
You think initial purchases were gonna pay for the game's development forever? How long did you think the game was gonna have content updates? Games like this require microtransactions to have continued support
---
ping is your travel time to server (speed)
---
mb/s is the measurement of how much data you are moving in that second. (weight)  
---
you cannot measure mph with pounds
---
Correct.  You bought the game.  Anything past that, you're asking for somethibg for nothing if you want new content but don't want to pay for it.
---
I wish Bethesda actually would have made DLC as a purchasable package so that all the freeloaders and ungratefuls wouldn't get to play it.  They could uninstall the base game they say they don't play and that would be that.  Instead, with every new patch, they get more complaint-fodder to spew on here.
---
Breh the event isn't even active yetttt and 2 you're  in the wrong sub jesus christ
---
It's a mod for the Plasma Gun. You gotta try it out, it melts everything easily! You just need to be reply close, and it breaks very quickly. You will no longer fear Cave Crickets!!
---
At this point there is no doubt in my mind that loot boxes are the next step.
---
Exactly. But the argument seems to be that no one should care since no PvP. Its ridiculous.
---
Then we shall have to call you Frederica!
---
My bad thanks just trying to stay ahead of the game
---
Yeah I don't know that consoles would be able to host a server and run the game. I'd need to see more technical details about the server software. It should be possible to host a server on a PC and connect to it from a console though. That's essentially what we're doing now (console players connect to Bethesda's servers).
---
Mods are more complicated here compared to Bethesda's single player games, because all the computers connected to the same server would need to share the same experience. Since the server performs most of the logic for game mechanics, things like combat rebalancing, adjust spawn timers, raising CAMP budget, etc. probably aren't too bad, because you'd only have to modify the server code. If the mod includes new assets though (textures, models, animations, sounds), that's where you run into problems, because those files need to exist on every machine connecting to the server, which means you somehow need to distribute and verify them.
---
The sub was sniped by another moderator
---
If it brings joy to you, there‚Äôs no harm in throwing a few atoms at them.
---
The two biggest things in Fallout Fuck-you 1st are things that were promised to be in the base game - Modding and private servers. This isn't 'new content past the base game', this is stuff I already paid for that they're telling me I have to pay for again.
---
No bethesda did, when they said all new content was going to be free . . .
---
This is a thing? I have a lot of liberators to kill!
---
I just wish they replaced them with something. Makes for a boring game when the quests are just ‚Äúthere‚Äôs super mutants in the savage divide kill the boss‚Äù
---
&gt; Now they want me to pay $22 a month for unlimited stash space and stable servers.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; They can get fucked.
---
I'm truly sorry that I can only give you one upvote for this.   This deserves at least 50 but I'm limited. You know how it is.
---
Stop it with your perfectly logical bullshit. Reddit doesn't wanna hear it!
---
Pretty sure they aren't serious. In case it wasn't obvious.
---
Man I thought something was up, as I was reading it I was filled with frustration for some reason and now it‚Äôs become clear, I also love that anyone speaking out saying this seems weird is getting downvoted. Man it blows, I used to really love Beth but now not only because of the fallout first nonsense conjoined with the utter disappointment this is fallout 4 I‚Äôve lost faith in them, ES6 is doomed almost definitely along with Starfield, which again blows because I was so excited when they announced both.
---
My Instigating Baseball Bat with +40% more power attack damage
---
It outright OHKs all but the strongest of foes with just one power hit, while being pretty lightweight
---
But my favorite weapon has to be my AAE Handmade. I rarely used it up until now because I didn't have much ammo for it, but now that I got 18k rounds for this thing I'm beginning to see why are Handmades so coveted: this thing *kills.*
---
Like Thomas Wayne said, we're all a bunch of clowns who made nothing of our life. And we're all just jealous of the whales who can afford to buy thousands of atoms.
---
LMAO if I‚Äôm being honest, I kinda waited a week just to see if it would fix itself, but I did figure out how to submit my own ticket so now I‚Äôm just kind of waiting for them to get back to me, which I 100% expect to take a day or two, but for now I guess my character is just gonna have to have herpes and that‚Äôs that
---
Fallout 76 sucks. Worst game in the franchise. 
---
U want a new fallout experience get the outer world's, it's a great game.
---
I‚Äôm not saying I agree with the scrap box and the tent being locked behind the subscription, but with that said, I don‚Äôt know just how bad their coding is.  8 bytes holds up to the number 255.  Even if items were just a single line on a database, as soon as your steel goes above 255 you‚Äôd need more space.  Now bytes are small, but I don‚Äôt know just how bad their coding is or their data structure.  Just that true unlimited storage could cause potential issues (especially when you have dupers)
---
My argument is only that the server was always known to have a fee, and compared to some other services (such as a Minecraft Realms Server) the price isn‚Äôt too bad, especially when you can share it with friends.  
---
The premium service could give unique skins for things as a premium but still offer the base service in the game.  
---
I just think people need to be careful with their battles.
---
FALLOUT 1ST BAD! BETHESDA BAD! TODD VERY BAD!!! RHEEEEEEEE!!!
---
So absolutely no one can enjoy this game now? and people who do is just hired by Bethesda? Here we go again. Stop accusing without evidence
---
I'm aware Reddit isn't the majority of the community, but this post is specifaclly about how the PR people on our sub went dark, and I'm saying how like a week or 2 after Bethesda fucks up this sub always let's them off the hook. When I say "this community" i mean exactly that. *This* community, as in the one here, on *this* subreddit
---
ok now I realise I might be disabled I'm deleting this lol :))))
---
Ok again off topic but please tell me how you spend time in this game. I try and try but just can find anything to do. 
---
In eso there is always something to do, I‚Äôm level 600 and still haven‚Äôt done summerset or elswyr yet . 
---
In both games there are builds that you can grind for and new items to grind and try for those builds. The difference is that in eso it‚Äôs a directed grind. You do specific dungeons and farm specific areas for certain sets. In fallout it‚Äôs completely random. And you can‚Äôt even grind legendaries without server hopping and a lot of luck that they appear. And legendaries still don‚Äôt even drop legendary loot 100% of the time.
---
These are the same ‚Äúgamers‚Äù who had a difficult time playing Modern Warfare at E3 because it was too ‚Äúdisturbing‚Äù, they are hacks.
---
Didn‚Äôt Bethesda comment saying it counts still if you just wear a mask when in power armour?
---
I‚Äôm nothing but thrilled at being excited to see a scorchbeast. It sure beats the Debbie Downer ‚Äúwah wah wah‚Äù trumpet that used to play in my head.
---
dude what you say speaks pure truth. i am pretty most of whiners on here are kids who don't have any money to buy said stuff. If companies got worried about what a small group of people said about their product through social media outlets, then i am pretty sure 90% of said products would not exist.
---
the OP did one thing with this thread that i will give respect towards cause they got it right... they called out Zenimax (the parent company) NOT Bethesda.
---
GTA V is HUUUUGE and doesn‚Äôt have 1/100000 the bugs FO76 has. It‚Äôs just plain bad craftsmanship.
---
Stockholm syndrome personified.
---
I've played every BR out there except Battlefield V Firestorm and Nuclear Winter is my favorite.
---
Elevator will become nice addition to my CAMP. 
---
I want big elevator. Rider style. Or even better Mad Max style. 
---
I want elevator now.
---
Just need to chime in that the Borderlands 3 reported "5 million sales" was a PR number. The value was "Sell In" not "Sell through".
---
Meaning that they gave 5 million keys out to various retailers, but didn't actually mean 5 million players went out and bought the game. It a method used to create an illusion of higher numbers when reporting to investors.
---
I definitely think they need to do something like how eso does their builds and loot drops.
---
New content is free. The sub doesn't add any content
---
ok boomer
---
We can collect hazmat suits to give to them for now. Tho I'm not sure if we can find low level suits with our high-level characters. I haven't crafted them yet, so that might be one way.
---
Seriously wish I saw this before spending atoms on them. If I csnt wesr my hat with them then they are just a waste of atoms.
---
Already done, I will be playing 76 long after the mass glory and interest in the Outer Worlds has faded as it always happens with single player RPGs.
---
That said I will still probably occasionally play the outer worlds too, it is a great game in itself even if it has almost nothing in common with Fallout.
---
Why was this post deleted? It literally vanished before my eyes.
---
The reason that this is the first time people care is because usually the story and rpg made us forgive them and overlook the bugs. Fallout 76 did not have a real story, and is not a rpg. So now the issues that where always there are much more of a problem. Of course no one is perfect, but people are not asking perfection from bethesda, just improvement. Not just for 76, but the overall quality of their games.
---
As far as the engine goes, i understand that. But you can build a new engine whilst making games on the old one. 
---
And im sorry mate, but no players want microtransaction where you can only get certain items through paying more money, or when the in game equivalent is 200 hours of xp grinding. Take 76 for example, do you really feel that the fallout 1st is worth paying 100 dollars a year? Or do you feel that it should just have been included in a patch, like they promised? Like Todd Howard said this dream of his would grow? 
---
No, im pretty sure a lot of it is greed.
---
Create a problem and sell the solution
---
For me, all I‚Äôm seeing in the sky is scrip and a handful of ultracite .45 being run through the action.
---
Probably a mixture of 3 and 4, the survival mechanics are alright as is but I feel like once you get to a high level they become irrelevant seeing as you can gather food and water so easily from your own camp as well as other plays.
---
Unfortunately that is a Fallout 1st item. Once you have paid the subscription, you can then buy said item from the Atomic shop for an 100000 atoms.
---
Oh shit, a real life edgelord. I have been defeated by hyperbole!
---
User also deleted?
---
No but you are telling me the subs needed to fund future content. So it isn't free, you are re-buying the game you already bought to fund it.
---
Yeah, just noticed it.
---
Same... Fallout 76 is the only game I've ever owned for PS4 that crashes on a regular basis.
---
From a fun perspective, legendary scorchbeasts were the best thing to come from last week‚Äôs patch.
---
I totally understand where you are coming from. I'm just enjoying the game for what it is and what I've played for. As far as people enjoying the game, I meant the people you run into in the game, not so much on reddit. I have a friend who doesn't go on reddit, and doesn't watch people like Jim Sterling or Yong and he never hears about any controversies over games and doesn't get bothered by it. He's been enjoying this game on and off and doesn't care about stuff like FO1st, he simply just doesn't buy it. Likewise you should take a break if the game is frustrating you, take a break for awhile and come back in 6 months. No game is meant to be played everyday for years, so the more you play it, the more that the bad things will float to the top and you'll get bored of the good stuff
---
I honestly think the survival elements are fine, they do the job. There are soooo many more pressing issues with this game
---
Gotcha, but why does any of that matter? Are you saying those quests aren‚Äôt common? Are you saying that 76 has a wide variety of engaging quests? What‚Äôs your point?
---
So you covering that refund right? Just saying if they lowered the price or made it free they will get ass blasted at people requesting refunds
---
I sell legendary weapons and armor....have tons of caps, and really nothing to buy except ammo, cuz im lazy, and need to burn caps.
---
It's optional, they're not making you buy anything. They're banking on some people buying yeah, but not forcing it on anyone. It's still free to those that don't opt into the subscription
---
Yeah, I know darned well these aren't new theories, and it's only wise of anyone making such a vast, more or less all-encompassing world to, shall we say, vague things up a bit - at the very least, it does lend a lot of "realism" in the feel of such a world, where there are competing theories as to what went on (even though there may very well be a "commonly-held" belief that may be, or border on, unquestionable dogma ... even/especially(?)  if that commonly-held belief is based on a Big Lie.)
---
Just pointing out how these two already-existing theories could be a way to safety-valve any steam coming from the Chinese.
---
(And didn't Blizzard have to delay the release of Wrath of the Lich King, because they had an issue with bones showing in zombies?  Disrespectful to the dead, or something like that ... even though, when I first found out there was a "The Gods Must Be Crazy 3", I was all excited for it .. until I found out it was Chinese-made, and has something to do with a hopping, Chinese vampire ... I guess disrespect is in the eye of the culture ...)
---
Anyway, we had fun making fun of all the censorship the Moral Majority used to want, now it's time to make fun of all kinds of other censorship, too.
---
There are perks like Iron Clad that he might have used but honestly, outside radiation even wearing power armor feels like I'm wearing nothing at all. Stupid sexy power armor.
---
I guess it is in reality, but I like fallout and I like th community so here I am.
---
I'm connected by ethernet. I've shopped around and went to other houses to do raids and farming and I always get those issues. On some days when the servers get empty enough it goes away. That is very rare though
---
Okay if you say so. Then why doesnt anything seem to be effected by gravity? If anything this game has showed me just how ignorant people on the internet are when they attack Bethesda for the creation engine. Fallout 76 looks a million times better than out worlds! Outer worlds is a cool game. I like the story but it's limited in its lasting appeal. Without a massive world to explore theres nothing to keep my into it past beating the story. Im going to beat it though but my only hope is that outer worlds 2 had a huge world. Maybe now that Microsoft owns obsidian games that can happen.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call the events ‚ÄúQuests‚Äù - they are just that, events - though some do have more to the story behind it, like when you defend the airport as the drone tries to land. But overall, they are repeatable activities to get some extra prizes.  
---
the actual quest lines have stories in them, such as following the overseer, finding out what happened to the order of mysteries, getting the ‚Äúmayor for a day‚Äù.  There‚Äôs story and lore to those if you read the terminals and listen to holotapes (I for one really enjoyed the quest for crafting the excavator power armor, hearing about the event and how they lost to the robots, and then seeing the rest of the world where the miners had lost their jobs to robots.  It tied everything together and actually was quite relevant at the time as people talked about AI and automation)
---
Yea this game has been getting hate from day 1, because it's not the Fallout that some fans wanted. IRS a shame because tons of people that would have loved it didnt even bother giving it a chance because of the "Cancel Culture bandwagon mindset"
---
U r in total denial, just look at "No Man's Sky" it had bad lunch after year the dev's show the fan their true skills and game became more playable and now they have released a free dlc and vr support for those who own the game. There is no subscription fee to pay. So u telling other companies r doing it wrong but bethesda is the who is doing it right ? Lol
---
hate is very different. Hate would be if it was unjustified. If nothing was wrong with the game and there were no issues then it could be hate. but it's really not. Objectively so.
---
Will do Todd!
---
That's a great way of explaining ping. I'm going to steal that
---
"travel time"
---
You make it sound cool
---
I know Bethesda has nothing to do with the subs.  But there's a pattern to things, you know. When something terrible happens, there's always going  to be conspiracy theories. 
---
And  something terrible has indeed happened to a game that we used to enjoy.   That's just my two cents (probably worth less than that).
---
True, but the shitty thing is unless you pay you get terrible server stability and the headache of constant inventory management. They literally made the game bad so they could sell you a slightly more stable version for a monthly fee. Plus its split what was a good community and made meaningful conversation and discussion virtually impossible.
---
BE handmade w/ 50DR
---
They should honestly ramp up the survival and social elements. We should fear the environment and have to band together to survive it.
---
We need more social tools and reasons to work together in the game. Legendaries as the sole meaningful reward system in the game doesn't work to bring us together when they can be had by barely interacting.
---
The thing works on console as well? Not really with bottlecap mines though. Dev room stuff i'm pretty sure.
---
Literal moonwalkers
---
Is this a bug or a feature
---
Oh bugthetic you are sneaky devil's
---
Yea they do! It's called Masochism and it's why I play games like Dark Souls and let it die :P
---
Onlything beth does on this sub is, oh ok I'll pass it on.  Take off the tinfoil
---
 "We pay their bills"  
---
Yes, that is how it usually works...
---
should you really stick your own comments when it's just your opinion?
---
UPDATE:
---
All further responses, updates, news will be provided to Fallout 1st subscribers ONLY. Alternatively you can purchase the response for 18.76.
---
3.  This game was intended to be a survival light game with role playing story behind it.  Too much work would need to be done to rebalance many things to make 1 or 5 a possibility.
---
Personally i think of all things, that element is actually spot on for this game.  There is enough food in the game that it never causes that much of an issue and I‚Äôm encouraged to find and cook recipes that make it even less of an issue.  
---
If anything, i think that injured limbs doesn‚Äôt come up enough
---
I don't have an issue with the game as it is, FO was never very tough to survive on regular difficulty.  I could go for a 'hard mode' version, but that would splinter the game more than I think it should.
---
If it were a little harder, I'd still be OK with it, so I'll vote 3.5.

Was about to nuke this until  you posted this - Jacksongamer128 lol, i nuke everything. ty tho, don't want to ruin other's fun
---
This is my opinion as well; though, I absolutely recognize that many people do not want this. 
---
Once Wastelanders is released, I hope they release a Nightmare or Hardcore mode that brings this in; or, at least, allow us to implement it in Private Worlds once they get custom options.
---
My server stability is still shit on a private server, I've had screen freezes, blue screens and choppy lag
---
Perfect, thanks!
---
And your still happy to pay for that?!
---
If you do nuclear winter before adventure after daily reset then challenges sometimes glitch out, just gotta hop into adventure first after daily reset and you shouldn‚Äôt have problems
---
Ha! That‚Äôs literally what I hear when I read yet another Bethesda is bad post by someone who doesn‚Äôt play it or has uninstalled it...lol
---
Now if it was an actual real statement... I apologize for thinking it was sarcasm... lol seek help immediately...lol
---
Dance emotes
---
There‚Äôs another sub as already mentioned, but I‚Äôll stay here.
---
There are people on both sides here and I don‚Äôt want the game to become an echo chamber of either side. Harrassing attacks are one thing, but both sides should be allowed to voice their criticism or joy of the game
---
Oh ok
---
Not an opinion, we aren't invoice over with Bethesda
---
I had finished those by the end of last November. You are right that they aren‚Äôt bad but what is there to keep players engaged after?
---
But the rads :(
---
They had best be some smooth moves for base game purchase+monthly fee+still getting terrible service.
---
Elevators will be in the Fallout 1st subscription soon. Not confirmed but I wouldn't be surprised lol.
---
With all the damage perks for specific weapons, you can down someone in marine armor in 3-5 shots.
---
The most powerful weapon with the right perks is the minigun while in power armor.
---
Just connecting the laser beam of bullets with someone is enough to down them, if they're close that is.
---
The only downside the minigun has is it's limited range, and you will be outgunned against a gatling gun user with the same perks at a distance.
---
I've been part of quite a few fortune 500 companies and it's almost always the case.  The money backers call the shots, configure timelines, and create a negative atmosphere.   But companies end up tied to them by the money.  It's why a lot of testers and programmers work obscene hours, trying to make impossible deadlines.  It happened with Anthem as well as many other games.  Then we as consumers get half finished games forced out by the money before they were ready.
---
Idk if you're trolling or if you just never played GTA:Online but the level of micro transactions between the two isn't even close. 
---
GTA releases a new grief machine every month that requires either dozens of hours of grinding the highest paying jobs to unlock, or you can pay $20 and have it unlocked instantly. 
---
Fallout sells kits that do the same thing as traveling to an in-game work bench, and don't alter the way other people are playing at at.
---
I agree, but I can also choose whether I want to further hear about that issue, because it's more of an annoyance for me to always read about it instead of the game itself.
---
Game is too easy outside of the hard vault. I vote 5
---
I paid for the game a year ago, with 1500 hours I've already gotten my money's worth
---
The small backpack is free -- just look in the Overseers stash at Morgantown airport.  The "standard" backpack and its mods need you to be a pioneer scout.
---
The kindness test is pretty easy to get if you participate in the *scorched earth* or *encryptid* events.
---
i saw a car vs truck comparison to explain ping vs mb/s maybe a year ago, and in my mind it made the most sense of it. (im not really into low voltage) ive used the comparison ever sense because almost everyone has an idea on vehicle speeds
---
Never played Fallout 76 or whatever shit game your talking about, from what I have read Bethesda sounds like any other money hungry game developer these days, so I agree, the game sounds like shit however I'm down voting because this is another one of those posts that is blaming Reddit for being this big conspiracy where PR departments manipulate your free speech and all mods on every subreddit are somehow in on it, that's some next level neckbeard crazy. News flash, no one gives a fuck about Reddit, 99.9% of people who play video games never look at this place.
---
I agree.
---
That said do you think the pvp baiters and meat clever exploiters care? They got one goal. E.A.R, (exploit, annoy, and ruin)
---
Huh. And here I was wondering what's all the hubbub over Fixer Plans
---
Meanwhile, I already learned the plan to craft The Fixer way before the price for it went way up (since I got the plan to drop from finishing the Lowe quest back in Wild Appalachia). So I guess I'm lucky I get to avoid all this hassle in order to have a chance at getting legendary Fixers by myself
---
Now, if only the Pruveyor can actually drop me the damn things...
---
People might be right, they might be wrong. I can't comment on what I don't know when it comes to paid bots and accounts.
---
Wow they really nailed Camden Park and the Pumpkin House.
---
But have you got next months moneys worth? Doing the same thing over and over for 1500+ hours? What do you even do anymore? I am bored of being in god mode for 2/3rds of the map and dumping ammo into the queen.
---
If you are lucky, they will scream one after the other so you are constantly bombared with blinding (yet ineffective) screeches without pause.
---
I wish more people spotted the irony in what I was saying, but that's okay.
---
It's game where the chat-to-bullets ratio is PLAYER DRIVEN.
---
Unless Bethesda makes it nuke free I‚Äôm seeing a lot of nukes being dropped... jus sayin‚Äô...lol
---
I‚Äôm saying I don‚Äôt trust anything that IGN puts out because all they are are sjws who masquerade as games journalists. They are going to bash fallout 76 because it is the ‚Äúhot trendy‚Äù thing to do. They are not real gamers, that‚Äôs what my point is.
---
https://youtu.be/jjMKVkEpLQU
---
Trust who you want my dude, I totally get why you wouldn't and that's okay.
---
I'd be the same if I were in your shoes.
---
There isn‚Äôt enough negativity in this sub anymore! I‚Äôd better do something quick to change that...
---
Encryptid and Project Paradise are other high level events, mostly it's just dicking around with friends talking about Fallout
---
Really?? This is what I get for having a gaming PC that works about as well as a paperweight for the last two weeks. Damn.
---
Hope you have pacifist on... :)
---
How do i can get the atoms i lost?
---
VATS and a little PMA solves that problem.

&gt; Edit: how does this have 2k upvotes when I don't see comments agreeing?
---
Guess.
---
You can't really compare Minecraft with FO76 in terms of cost in maintenance for example, staff for content update or fixes.
---
But microtransactions is not bad if well design, check out Path of Exile or Warframe, both are F2P with insane amount of cosmetics and minor gameplay impact features(mostly almost mandatory if you play the game a lot, but with 60 bucks you are good for life with such features cost, its basically a one time game purchase IF you play a lot, otherwise doesn't matter), but the problem with FO76 microtransactions is that they suck hard cosmetic wise...
---
FFSS1+Agility Deathclaw Gauntlet is for sure my most used.
---
Then I got

FE .50 Cal
---
FEFR Primed LMG
---
TS Bashing Damage Minigun with a shredder that‚Äôs just plain fun.

I went to the Pumpkin house a couple days ago. It's truly crazy how much effort is put into to all the pumpkins to only last a couple of days.
---
Mod sure is defensive, I'm sure BGS nudges you Mods to do their bidding on some level. Of course the answer will be another mile long post just to simply refute my claim, when it only proves me more correct. Not trolling, I just don't believe you.
---
Todd's jacket on the other, very schway!
---
This is like getting slapped in the face, thanking them for the privilege and asking for more.
---
A dlc model, even a one time pay season pass, would probably entice me to pay, provided the sub wasn't there and the game was in a good state. I don't mind paying for content, provided its reasonable and good. And I'm pretty sure your point of " anything past that is something you should pay for" goes down the drain when Bethesda started cutting base game content to later sell it, such as the scrap robot."
---
It's good that people complain, otherwise the game would still be where it started. However the way in which your complaints are placed is what matters. I don't think us fighting against eachother is going to fix anything, but I think people getting together and saying "hey issues a b and c are unacceptable, fix them" is perfectly fine. Besides, you should not start a game and hope your microtrasactions pay for the further development of said game. If you are taking an ambitious project on, make sure tk have the resources needed first.
---
The game has improved from its original state, yes. But there is still so much more that can be done to improve QoL of everyone who still plays it, sub or not.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if they do. I quit playing earlier this year after other games came out. Fallout 76 will not however be a game I will revisit, unlike many games like it have been for me before. 
---
I first heard about First a day or two ago when a post about it reached the front page. Honestly I‚Äôm not surprised. Bethesda‚Äôs excuses for not releasing some of the most desired features was suspicious and now it‚Äôs obvious they held them back purposely to bundle into a cash grab subscription model. I really don‚Äôt care what excuses they have or what ones people make for them. I find this fact obvious and inviolable.
---
Do they post PR? It‚Äôs ignorant to say they couldn‚Äôt or wouldn‚Äôt. Reddit is well known to be a massive target for PR, marketing, etc. However, keep in mind subreddit mods do not have access to tools that could help them detect and identify them. At least, most mods on reddit don‚Äôt.
---
The takeaway? If you guys who still care about this game and this sub want to do something about this, report suspected PR and vote manipulation to the Reddit admins, not the subreddit mod team.
---
Yea cause botting, fake accounts and karma farming don't exist.
---
I admit I will miss playing with friends but I just can't support a sub right now, not in the games current state. I see a lot of accusations of being a hater thrown around, but I am not really. I just had high hopes that 76 would bounce back ESO style and I just don't see that happening now.
---
Why does it bother you that people like a game thy you don‚Äôt?
---
Fallout 1st is now free to all owners of Fallout 76...
---
12PM = NOON; 12AM = MIDNIGHT
---
You are absolutely right. 
---
Somehow I belive this is never going to happend. We get to much freedom and Bethesda don't get any money.
---
THIS!
---
Because they sound like they have beaten wife syndrome
---
Stop being on the internet, Todd.
---
Dude... I play the game. I don‚Äôt need to watch our video. I know you don‚Äôt play the game. That‚Äôs fine. But don‚Äôt tell me to watch some video to learn about a game I invested &gt;600 hours into.
---
It was half serious tbh. Im against what bethesta is doing with game right now and i hope for get it fixed, yet i find it funny that me (at start) and some other people tried to do something about it. Now im just laughting and still hoping that game become good one day.

**#1 complaint about survival in adventure mode - Night time looks like shit.** 
---
*Sorry but not sorry we have tons of lights and stuff. The day glow makes all the art teams actual effort totally washed out. There are perks for night vision + if there was real night NV scopes would be useful finally.*
---
**#2 complaint - the PVP side of the player base needs somewhere to go that isn't the walled garden of nuclear winter**
---
I think the survival elements of Adventure mode is fine for the most part but they need essentially a RUST mode for a large swatch of the player base.
---
Nuclear winter is ok but it's standalone and people want to pvp with their adventure mode gear. I think thats a understandable desire and player's had that.
---
Given we had that with **Legacy-Survival** \- they should allow players to re-activate that with private servers. I don't care if it's not maintained until post wastelanders - I just think certain people need that private pep match capability.
---
**On hunger / thirst:** 
---
I think the hunger / thirst systems work fine when they aren't bugged by a mutation. (Speed Demon üëÄ) it's dreadfully easy to come across food and I thought their nerf before to it wasn't really needed. Again just fix mutations.
---
ESO didn't bounce back imo until One Tamriel, but that's also when they introduced the craft bag (scrapbox) to ESO+ and the housing system, which had houses in the $20-100 range
---
This article does not even mention 76. And you don‚Äôt need to trust them. All you have to do is have played a few RPGs before to recall doing the types of quests they mention.
---
I dont think it stacks any longer.
---
Never said they didn't
---
So I take it the responder fireman helmet doesn't count?
---
This game has become a social experiment in my eyes. 
---
They are just toying with you guys at this point. How much more will you guys endure?
---
I don‚Äôt know dude. I don‚Äôt have trouble connecting to matches in NW. longest I waited was 1 minute the other day (I timed it because it was taking longer than usual).
---
Huh. Genuinely interesting. Cheers
---
Stole your junk? 
---
i think youre being a bit dramatic
---
Is it in VATS though?
---
Have a nice day.
---
Make sure to read their rules. They are a bit strict with posts.
---
Ahh ok, nm ty for the info, didn't know that
---
A fair point, but by the time of One Tamriel ESO had tons of content, for all levels, solo and MP. They had something for everyone to do.
---
I‚Äôm assuming that their coding is good seeing as that the entire fallout 76 world is MASSIVE(in all caps for dramatic effect not yelling) but that‚Äôs not the point. The point is that Bethesda betrayed the community‚Äôs trust twice. First with saying that they wouldn‚Äôt sell anything that would effect the game which went out the window FAST. And that they said they couldn‚Äôt add anymore storage which is also a lie.
---
The reason I don‚Äôt like the servers being paid for is that it pretty much tells us that mods most likely won‚Äôt come to fallout 76 and if it does you have to pay for the option for mods. It isn‚Äôt bad but for how little we get to do with the servers and how much it costs is just ridiculous in my opinion.
---
Unique skins is always a plus and I don‚Äôt really have anything against that.
---
I'll give you 2k for it.
---
But... did I read the post wrong? My understanding is not that he wants to undercut US, but to lower the values to what a few of us were ALREADY charging so that the scrapbox is less of a bonus to himself. Thus helping everyone else. So, if anything, wouldn't it be HELPFUL to have more junk at affordable prices?
---
I mentioned this subscription 200+ days ago and either people thought I was crazy or it wouldn‚Äôt happen... it‚Äôs pure business and it‚Äôs marketed toward select groups as ESO is and was. 
---
To me it made sense especially being the same company and I noticed the similarities early on during the stress tests...
---
Here‚Äôs my post from 200 days ago:
---
You should post a vid
---
For the love of god quit bitching, if you don‚Äôt like how the game is right now. Then stop playing it‚Äôs as simple as that.
---
Power armor needs a buff otherwise the wearer becomes a sitting duck in the eyes of the other person.
---
I want more survival mechanics üò¨
---
I'll give you 1k for it
---
I know but that‚Äôs probably their only bet to fixing their mistake. Either way Bethesda has put them self in a hole.
---
I keep rolling this attribute on so many weapons.  :(
---
certainly not tomorrow.  but they will definitely be releasing loot boxed once all the current anger dies down.  i assume they will say something that amounts to "with the tremendous support showed for fallout 1st, its clear that the player base desires more of a pay to win model"
---
Some players with Bear hat or NCR Costume killed me several times and I forgot to put my junk on stoage. So, they stole it.
---
By giving Bethesda your money.
---
They don't have jobs or a life, most of the fanboys/PR squad are still catching Z's. Give it time, the mindless,tasteless zombies will be here.
---
You also need to add they ran to their private session afterwards.
---
I have 600 hours on my main. The content is just to mediocre to make me wana lvl an alt. I see the point of having one to carry stuff but to lvl up an do everything over again just isnt interesting enough.
---
Agreed. I have to hope that this really shakes things up and Zenimax have a change of heart and look at the bigger picture for BGS in general. Because they have to realise this is a detriment for their games pipeline Starfield, ES6 and how consumers are more clued up to their nefarious practices and are now not looking forward to those games anymore.
---
Yeah she was letting her son build a castle haha, I was in her team.

---
What kind of shit have you been playing to call this "the best"
---
2‚ÄìBecause the survival elements are either pointless tedium or excuses to sell utility items. 
---
Food and water are everywhere, so staying well fed and hydrated is just a matter of clicking some buttons on a regular basis. It‚Äôs utterly pointless, beyond the fact that it requires to you hold onto food, which takes up space, which there is now a ‚Äúconvenience item‚Äù sold to alleviate. 
---
Weapon/armor condition is also equally pointless. You have to collect scrap to maintain weapons, but having a fully repaired or over repaired gear provides no benefits. This inconvenience mechanic exists to artificially extend the gameplay loop and incentivize sales of ‚ÄúConvenience items‚Äù like repair kits, scrap kits and the Scrapbox. 
---
I love 76, but after a few days of playing a game that doesn‚Äôt include this sort of tedium, it puts these aspects in a new perspective. It‚Äôll never happen, but they should dump them and focus on fun‚Äîplaying a game shouldn‚Äôt feel like work.
---
They're gone. Though once this happened to me and I seemed to have more atoms the next day. Don't get your hopes up, I may have completed some character challenge and gotten atoms that way and I chalked it up as the missing atoms
---
Who is this MMOG person? They claim to have talked to people at Bethesda, but if I'm going to trust someone's claims to anonymous sources I'd like to know about their background. Why do you trust them?
---
Here's the thing...if you don't like the game, don't play. It's been a year, give it up. Go fill your life with joy doing something else. Me, I like the game. I haven't got to play it much lately, but I like it. I don't work for Bethesda or do anything for Bethesda. But some of you are so damn focused on wasting your lives whining about a game you don't like- just don't play. Do something else.
---
Wow, look at that paragraph that has nothing to do with OP. Safe to say, f076 mods are compromised.

Funny Math,

* 1 year subscription with taxes = \~$107/12 = **$8.91 per month** for;
---
* **Private Server Space**
---
   * Friends Only
---
   * No Griefing, Leeching, or Freeloading
---
   * Great Stability
---
* **Unlimited Scrap Storage** (very convenient, not tactically advantageous)
---
* **Forward Tent**,  (very convenient, not tactically advantageous considering how restrictive placement can be)
---
* **Really cool looking Ranger Outfit, Icons, &amp; Emotes**
---
* **1650 Atoms every Month** (this alone would be a good value).
---
Even if you just subscribe for one month, you get to keep the Tent &amp; Outfit forever, which seems like a great deal to me considering how many hours I spend playing this game everyone hates so much.
---
&gt; they will continue to put out content that you have to pay for. 
---
Ah.
---
It really depends on the player, I still enjoy working on my camp, interacting with other players, and just exploring the world.  
---
I don‚Äôt see it as any different than any of the other, previous fallout games once you‚Äôve completed all the quests but are still playing, especially 4.  After I beat the game I just built up my settlements and enjoyed the attacks on them.

Screenshot your challenges and send it to beth support. They recently refunded me 100 atoms from pre-completed challenges.

---
No, this is an opinion. As for Bethesda's presence here, as people mentioned above, you don't have to run the sub in order to participate in it. It's like if a murder suspect says he's not guilty because he doesn't own a gun shop. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
---
There was no good reason for you to stick this post, and you certainly misused your moderator rights, hence the downvotes.
---
Yes, this is a very good comparison with Fallout 1st where you have to pay 100 bucks for a broken game. It‚Äôs [b]precisely[/b] like dropping a gold bar one someone‚Äôs foot!
---
Jokings aside; does Bethesda pay your salary that you are willing to break your back for them?

Just one of the wats the game is broken a year later.

Head shots do double dmg. If you were hitting limbs/torso, and he hit just 2 headshots, he could have won the 1v1, not just stalemate.

Im really upset, that's not gonna happen

Make survival aspects more important. Not debilitating, but diseases don't just go away. That's why they're diseases
---
Hey, I'm normal player. Not Fallout 1st sub shit.
---
I really enjoyed the game for the first month, but gradually after that the problems wore me down until I gave up and quit playing. I've toyed with the idea of reinstalling and trying again here and there, but each time I read up on it or see news bits, I see that the problems are still there and instead Bethesda has focused on monetization over fixing the product I paid for.
---
With this whole subscription nonsense, that's the last straw. Definitely never going to bother trying again, and if anything I wish I could go back and just not have bought the damn game in the first place. I am very, very unhappy with Bethesda. To the point where despite absolutely loving the Elder Scrolls games ever since getting sucked into Daggerfall in the late 90's and thoroughly enjoying every installment since then, Bethesda's greed and obvious disdain for their paying customers has resulted in my resolution that Elder Scrolls VI will be the first game in that franchise that I don't happily snag on day one. I will instead be waiting a fair bit of time to let the honeymoon period wear off so I can see if they actually handle that game correctly or if they instead turn it into a crass monetization vehicle like Fallout 76.
---
It saddens me to see what Bethesda has come to.
---
Have you seen where people use the windmill generator as an elevator?
---
I was to over encumbered to ever leave my house so I have so many questions.
---
"People still like the game and Bethesda". I get it if you still like the game. I think you should check out other games that do what this game does but better, you do you. If you still like Bethesda though, you are trash. It's not a matter of opinions. It's a matter of facts. Liking something that shits on you and takes advantage of you shows the caliber of your personality. So I really hope there's not a single soul on this sub that likes Bethesda. If there are, I feel bad for you.
---
you will still eventually reach a point where the game map ends. What then?

That comes down to my girlfriend and I being good cooks.  As a divorced parent who doesn't have primary custody, I pay an ungodly amount of money in child support and alimony.  Sometimes it does come down to Dollar per calorie unfortunately.
---
Okay, but my point is still the same. The Reddit Fallout 76 community is relatively small compared to their audience as a whole, and really has no say on what they do. By saying we are "letting them get away with this" you say that as if this community could ever change it based on our voices alone. It's just not the case. They don't care what Reddit thinks, they care what the people paying for their product think. And, to be honest, who would you rather listen to: sales numbers or a bunch of people on the internet who can't say much of anything nice and complain about how they are quitting left and right? 
---
I'm not saying people should be nicer, or stop complaining. I'm saying that don't be surprised when things don't change the way you want them to because your voice is just one in a sea of negativity that Bethesda would rather not address right now.
---
So...digital terrorism? Griefing players as a form of protest against Bethesda. What absolute, childish nonsense.

Well, you see what you wanna see. Which is why I've been saying the whole time that I'm not going to waste time arguing with you about what "unfinished" means. Lots of other players have invested hundreds of hours into the game too, and they have no problem with acknowledging its bugs and problems. You can't convince me that the game isn't broken and unfinished when there's tons of evidence of the opposite - even Todd Howard himself admiting in an interview that they released the game too early - so just give up.
---
I do
---
How frequent is event btw?
---
It‚Äôs easy to shout conspiracy but it‚Äôs also easy to believe PR accounts when so many people point out accounts in this sub. I used to have so many screenshots of accounts to prove my point, I wish I still had them.
---
oh you‚Äôre a day old account with a positive post of FO76 that has 1k+ upvotes in almost no time? What a coincidence!
---
Oh you‚Äôre a 30 day old account with literally just comments defending the game in the FO76 sub and nowhere else? What a coincidence!
---
5 minutes!
---
On some weapons this is an amazing effect. Black powder weapons for instance. It sucks ass it's broken.
---
It's safe to say that on the demographic pie chart that is the segregated player-base - that is a distinct category - just like the rusty PVP'rs
---
What mistake? They didnt make one. Game sales are not enough to keep content, bug fixes, and qol changes coming. Cash will. Since folks won't spend cash on atoms, they brought out a subscription, it's no surprise.
---
Well, they did say make noise and ~~break~~ explode things...
---
Sounds like lag.
---
Sorry I meant complain to support, I lost a whole bunch of atoms recently and all they asked for was a screenshot of the completed challenges.
---
Probably my bloodied prime .50 cal, 10% ADS &amp; 90% RW. Not the best bloodied .50 option but it seen me through so far.
---
People still like the game and Bethesda". I get it if you still like the game. I think you should check out other games that do what this game does but better, you do you. If you still like Bethesda though, you are trash. It's not a matter of opinions. It's a matter of facts. Liking something that shits on you and takes advantage of you shows the caliber of your personality. So I really hope there's not a single soul on this sub that likes Bethesda. If there are, I feel bad for you.
---
Can you just stop pretending like you know more about the game than people who actually play? Lol. It‚Äôs sad. Is this what made you want to start posting 2 days ago? Lol
---
I know it was just a light hearted joke. How did these fallout 1st members know you was so against it anyway?
---
I tested this with a friend a month ago and found the results inconsistent. On a few isolated cases, two stims popped at once. Most of the time, it only popped one.
---
I think for the double stimpak effect, there has to be some latency issues that contribute to it.
---
Thank you for the heads up
---
No you read it correct, but lowering the price means non subs get undercut. Any non sub that sells scrap will have to lower their prices to compete with subs even though it's harder for the non subs to get the scrap. Subs also can offer more scrap at a time because they have more stash space due to not having to store it anymore. More scrap + more storage + better supply = non subs lose
---
you made it sound like they stole it from your container...
---
and okay then welcome to fallout 76. where being killed drops your junk
---
thats just how the game works.
---
If you exploit that enough they'd probably fix it. "Ahh geeze guess it happened again!"
---
dont you mean freeze?
---
Vampire Explosive Handmade
---
How did they even know that you're against F1st?
---
The good of it is part 2... I fully believe they‚Äôll expand the map well beyond the ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt go that way‚Äù block. 
---
PS4 or PC users (not Xbox I tried) was able to go to many of those closed areas and it looks like everywhere else. 
---
Based on ESO who opens up new lands with DLC‚Äôs, I‚Äôm thinking this will be part of the new Wastelanders update to be able to go into those areas. 
---
In order for it to grow they‚Äôll need to expand. Look at Fallout 4... that map seemed extensively larger. ESO‚Äôs world is massive so it can be done and makes sense.
---
You're not "people". You're one person.
---
And the subscription gives players access to all of the DLC, meaning they don't have to buy it piecemeal. You can complete the DLC, stop your subscription and keep all your progress/items that you earned from the DLC.
---
I understand you may not know the Bethesda PR team but anyone that knows PR / Marketing would understand this move. In college I literally worked for a company that paid me to go to websites and post positive reviews about their products. When PR is bad, this is amplified at all costs to salvage their brand
---
I do realize it is a start.  But I also realize it is the start of something completely different than what people were asking for with private servers.  And it is not the start of anything remotely resembling what I would be willing to pay $100 a year for: locally hosted home servers with persistent, community-moddable worlds.  
---
What Fallout 1st offers *isn't* private *servers* \-- neither local host nor Bethesda-hosted.  They are not even private worlds.  They are relatively private, non-persistent *instances*.  That is the foundation of this service, and there are no number of bells and whistles that Bethesda can add to that to make me interested in paying a monthly subscription for it.  The bare **minimum** I would require to be willing to pay a monthly subscription is persistence.
---
It's more like this community you speak of is being paranoid, but it's just my 5 cents.
---
They have been pretty busy, over the last week, according to the deleted posts.
---
You're so full of shit I don't even know what to say...
---
I bought it for 12 bucks. Lmao its nice for that price
---
BE Laser Rifle
---
Oh no, do I disagree with you?!! I must be PAID to do it by Bethesda. It's the ONLY explanation.
---

When I play on my PC at home, I have a 1Gb/1Gb connection, but at the bar, I'm running a tethered connection through my Cricket cell phone.  I've noticed no issues.  I play heavily in vats, and I've also never seen hits not register damage, so maybe OP's problem is with his deck.
---
But the mistakes are coming from what fallout 76 was and still is and how they respond to it. They betrayed the trust of their community the same people who are giving Bethesda money twice. I think they could try and fix the mistakes they made even though they give no shits about their community anymore.
---
At this point defending this game should be considered a mental illness.
---
Free speech isn‚Äôt freedom for consequences of it. It‚Äôs just freedom from the government intruding upon your speech. You aren‚Äôt free from criticism and others disagreeing with you, and those aren‚Äôt ‚Äúcosts.‚Äù That‚Äôs just discussion. You‚Äôre trying to conflate multiple things so you can have it one way but not another when it just doesn‚Äôt work that way.
---
Bottom line: people can be upset at those who give Bethesda incentive to continue unpopular practices. Deal with it.
---
Costs more to start a new project than to alter a current.
---
Haha yeah that could be exploited pretty badly!
---
You don't know what pay to win means, do you?
---
Transdogrifier *was* in the creation club, hrrm
---
Btw your video is a year old lol. Has nothing to do with state of game today.
---
Your comment history is going after people who play the game.
---
What made you want to start posting 2 days ago? I‚Äôm curious?
---
So what‚Äôs wrong with a little PvP? I thought fo76 was all down with that for any reason?
---
Because Bethesda doesn‚Äôt care about you!
---
Yep, if you‚Äôre into PVP it‚Äôs pretty sweet. Not the fixer I was praying for however!
---
Chems.  Daytripper helps
---
My camp is completely holloween ready lol. I'm hoping the Halloween event is fun. I wasn't a fan of Meat Week. Fingers crossed this one is amazing.
---
There was a lot more to do with settlements. And a lot more to do in terms of questing. One year out Fallout 4 added all the DLC. So far this game has had Added very little. 
---
Some will stick around but many won‚Äôt and few new players will engage.
---
Shhh nobody asked the word janitor for his opinion ü§´

Look at your reasoning mate. It‚Äôs not healthy. If you are not being paid by Bethesda you need to see a doctor.
---
That's a very good point I didn't think of.
---
Woah that thread is amazing. And that's before stuff like the Mechanist outfit or Maxson outfit that were paid only and not available for Atoms.
---
Ah, see, in all 105 levels, I've never owned anything two-shot.
---
anyone that knows PR / Marketing would understand this move. In college I literally worked for a company that paid me to go to websites and post positive reviews about their products. When PR is bad, this is amplified at all costs to salvage their brand
---
Correct me if I'm wrong (or you're just trolling), but when they announced the game they said everything post launch would be free. So you're mad at people for expecting the very basic thing they were promised??? While I agree that the people who buy and are 1st subscribers are helping to "justifiably" further the game at this point, I don't think it's right to call out people for not investing further. No one should be shamed into spending money no matter what. And yes, I've bought all the special atom bundles and individual atoms and am a 1st subscriber, but I don't expect anyone to spend anymore than they're comfortable/willing to.
---
Honestly. Why isn‚Äôt Fallout 76 FREE TO PLAY? 
---
Because they desperately need more money to help develop their other future shitty games.
---
Don‚Äôt purchase or preorder any future Bethesda titles!
---
Thanks to the redditor that gave this a Nuka Cola award!  I expected a lot of hate from this post.  This definitely cools the burn!
---
It's about having choices. 
---
I sub to 1st, but usually don't use the private servers.  Too dead.
---
Some of the "other players" also paid full price for the game and they don't seem much bothered by paying more for, well, more.
---
Lots of stuff.
---
Look back to his ESO posts. If you want to check the newer things, he called the Anthem issues a long while before Kotaku. He called it coming to EA Access and other things. He was also pretty dead on with the Gazillion Marvel Heroes bullcrap.
---
So this is your fault then. I hate the sub system, but regardless of that, it gives them nothing power wise to make them kill you better. So what I'm reading is "I started a fight with a subber, and got my ever loving ass kicked!" And you really can't complain to Bethesda about that. You fucked up, and tried to troll a payer, and got your aas whipped, and they burned your shit down for trying to fuck with them. This isn't game balance issues, this isn't sub issues, this is karma. You're like those dude bros that start fights, and call the cops because you lost.
---
Oh I do I just don't agree with the so-called definition in which the herd likes to run with
---
I thought this would have been obvious... Everyone is too busy playing TOW to remember what 76 even is.
---
I'm not gonna be gaslit into suddenly liking a shitty subscription service.
---
And the Silver now as well!  Thank you!
---
I have Bulletin Board on some wall with posters and writings. I did write with letter thing (I don't remember what it called) and it was : "Fallout First Players Will Got Shot In Head By Me" it was for scaring them from me.
---
Yeah if they will add those kind dlc's and expand map i hope they add some vehicles. Im sick of this disgusting backtracking.
---
You should consider this a win/win.  The more dedicated players, will be willing to buy their own instance; which means the guys with 10+ characters who are there just to mine for CAPS, etc, won't be using 10x the server resources on the public servers - which makes them more stable.  Win/Win.
---
Why are these basic quests needed?
---
Isn't that kind of the point? They want an environment where people who enjoy playing can come to talk. Not another bitchfest like we get over here regularly
---
They never betrayed me? They also have done but steadily make the game more and more enjoyable and long lasting for me? You should realize your personal opinion, just like mine, is not a fact.
---
I know it didn‚Äôt specifically mention 76. But you felt the need to post this IGN list anyways, so let me ask you what is your point of posting this?
---
Yeah i do love me some Todd, kinda wish i could get his leather coat in game
---
Now that's an interesting thought. I was on another thread talking about The Sims earlier. I paid for the game, and for the full expansions I pay that price again, with smaller DLCs (with less content) being sold for less. I think they're worth the space and money because I can afford it and get a lot of mileage out of the game.
---
My husband and I build PCs for fun. Our idea was to grab the gear from the last generation, overclock to the limits of what it can hold, and leave it there (free tip: Rocket League is a GREAT way to test your CPU overclock). So I am not buying the newest, biggest, and best every time. But my PC is still WAY out of reach of either of my brothers, one of whom is in university, and the other who has a kid and not a lot of income.
---
But all of this is irrelevant when it's not an online game. I do not have any advantage over anyone else if I can make the Sims run better than it has ever run before! If Fallout 4 runs smoothly, I will have a better experience, but it won't change anyone else's game.
---
I've been thinking about online games recently. Not just the big MMOs, but ones like 76 where it's you and a bunch of other people, messing around on a server. What if one of the players in Nuclear Winter (which I have never tried, just to be up front) has a potato for a computer, and one of his opponents has a top-of-the-line PC? Ignoring for a moment all of the hacking, let's consider how much easier it would be to shoot and aim on the smoother computer than the choppy one. NOW there might be a big difference to the gameplay.
---
Remember when The Witcher 3 came out? I remember thinking it was HUGE! Last week I bought Gran Turismo Sport for the PS4, and it was quite significantly larger. It's didn't seem like a problem, but I only have a couple of games. And with hard drives (both spinners and SSDs) becoming more and more affordable, space doesn't seem like an issue... on PC. How big do some of these consoles need to get? And I genuinely do want to know. What do we think would be a reasonable size drive on the next PS or XBOX system?
---
Done, thanks for the help
---
Yeah, because I can't just friend you, join your session, and fuck with you that way right? Oh wait....they aren't actually private.
---
The fallout76.ini? Or ultra.ini?
---
No worries, glad to help!
---
You started the fight, it's not theft, it's loot.
---
Dunno about that, FFXIV your charged for major expansions.  Don't know if it still does, however WoW did as well back when I played.
---
FO1st your stuck with a fee thanks to the private server instance.  No clue if 100/year is reasonable for average person though.  I'm betting it's based off theoretical max load.
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
No.
---
bingo
---
I‚Äôd take any quests.
---
Too be fair pets do cost money for upkeep in the real world so this has a basis in reality. The absolute worst part of subscription based pets will be when you let you sub lapse so a message pops up on screen that says your pet is in a better place now and has gone to live on a farm somewhere upstate.
---
Why do y'all even stay for the abuse when outerworlds just came out. It's a better fallout game then Bethesda has ever made
---
I'm not mad that they expect it.  I'm baffled that they're mad at how Bethesda has monetized certain things.  Did they assume that free DLC was going to be developed by Bethesda employees off the clock?  
---
I'm no Commie, so I don't understand where they're coming from...
---
Ayyy! I've not seen anyone who's decorated their camps yet, or wearing halloween outfits. (I tend to hop to different camps to look for plans and other goodies to buy/ drop off for other players) 
---
I never took part in meat week, I was on one of my regular breaks from Fallout and was binge playing DbD and Borderlands during that event, but I have seen a few people mention Meat week was lackluster :( 
---
I'm that excited, I'm currently sat at Whitesprings waiting patiently xD
---
I do understand that my opinion is not fact and if you do enjoy the game then good for you. I‚Äôm just trying to make my voice and others who share the same voice as mine be heard by Bethesda. I‚Äôm not trying to convince people my opinion is fact. I‚Äôm just saying that Bethesda has gone against their word intentionally twice and haven‚Äôt given a good excuse heck they haven‚Äôt even responded to the outrage
---
They made the problem themselves, and are asking money from you for then to fix it.
---
That fallout 76 lacks quests, even the ones so basic that they end up on an IGN list.
---
Lmao this sounds so fake
---
I wore the Clown Hat and Clown Outfit.
---
Haha I know! Definitely needs some tweaking if the intention is private lol
---
I did.
---
THIS.

Yes the coffin backpack is there. The jack-o-lantern with candy is a loot bag skin, the crashed witch and the eyeball death tambo are all there.

‚ÄúExtreme grind to get anywhere without money‚Äù

Did it happen? I'm confused...I didn't see it on my server? but then again timezones
---
The irony of First Worlders and their First World problems. Everyone complaining about class divides: you have absolutely no idea what the term means if you think it in any way applies to a subscription scheme for a video game you presumably bought with your discretionary income. Marx and Engels are spinning!
---
I mean I know that's how you feel, but yeah that's not the same for me. I just want them to keep making money and keep tweaking the game. All I ask for is better explained patches notes with everything they change involved.
---
let me pay for someone‚Äôs fuck ups and poor foresight - the post.
---
shit like this is why the fucking star wars movies are also now such a shitshow, morons will defned it because they cant detach a shit product from the franchise
---
They cannot even sync doors correctly (I'm sure you've seen a player walk through a door that is closed for you)
---
I can already see it now; players just floating up an elevator shaft while the elevator remains grounded.
---
Food and water mechanics bring me zero joy. Truth being told I think the single step to make this game much better would be to completely, wholly remove all AID items from it.
---
There is nothing aid items enhance for me, and they completely flop many otherwise interesting elements of this game.
---
There is no joy coming out of funding a water bottle while being unable to be efficient without it. This is not a fun challenge. Fun challenge is to overcome danger, and food/water makes it so that main danger is boredom.
---
Well, you deserve this. How can you be so toxic?
---
Yeah how could you possibly claim that 76 is bigger than base ESO... literally laughable. 76 barely has any content.
---
I really want the blog to be right, but I'm also at work. You said he was right about ESO, Anthem, and Bioware. I don't have the time to dig for the articles, but I can read them. Got any links to save me some time? Would be very appreciated.

Meat cleaver exploiter?

What are you looking for in terms of evidence? Affidavits? Holotapes?

That‚Äôs a old picture of the Pumpkin House!

I agree with you that this is my worry, i even posted about  it when it was announced to a not so nice reception by the community

It will happen, what 1st is now will only be the tip of the iceberg of what's to come
---
1st subscribers are Bethesda's priority now not it's normal un subbed playerbase. They'll want to keep them happy and keep them subbing giving bethesda more n more cash.
---
We the un subbed will get bare minimum new items/gear etc.. in the atom shop whilst fallout 1st members will get everything the community has wished for n more because they are paying for the privilege
---
Was very nearly a epic store exclusive.
---
Must have gotten the idea from ESO for the stash space. ESO his membership with unlimited crafting bag, otherwise you can‚Äôt carry anything hardly.
---
Not happening on my server either...
---
If you can still defend this game at this point you‚Äôre idiotic. I‚Äôm just here lurking for the memes.
---
I've played enough fallout to know those things are evil.  #Block the Bot
---
I want a little more survival. Not much more though. I'd like weather to be more serious and I'd like to have player settlements and player factions.
---
Because they ran out of money in development and a team of 5 college interns are working on the game currently until a new game comes out.
---
I've boycotted the game since release, don't send good money after bad, is all I have to say. 
---
if the game is shit, don't buy the membership, it tells Bethesda that your OK with what they're doing and their current trajectory
---
FOUR STORIES????????? - Angry Joe.
---
"If you'd like to renew your subscription maybe the farm will be willing to send them back! You wouldn't want to leave them behind would you?"
---
Atari 2600, Intellivision, Coleco... I forget how many joysticks I snapped off the base trying to get my character to move. Lol
---
I was really keen to play this, but I've been watching some gameplay videos and all I see are brief walks through corridors and more-or-less non-stop talking heads. And the saturated colour scheme is pretty nauseating imo. But I might pick it up on sale.
---
Yeah, i have no defense for that one. The whole epic store thing is bs.
---
Is it so hard to drop a deuce?
---
&gt;Game was rough at launch.
---
See? I told you. You knew all along what unfinished meant.
---
&gt;Btw your video is a year old lol. Has nothing to do with state of game today.
---
Never said it did.
---
If you go back to my first post you can see that I said the game cost $60. I was clearly talking about the game when it was released.
---
&gt;What made you want to start posting 2 days ago? I‚Äôm curious?
---
Again, I don't have to justify my reason(s) for wanting to discuss the game to you. If you're desperate to know then you can try ask me in a private message. It is otherwise completely irrelevant.
---
the issue with that statement though is that the outer worlds is genuinely an amazing game.
---
It‚Äôs just some atom shop stuff. No update planned for it
---
Word janitor, I actually love that lmao
---
Lol I'll be there soon as I can. Lol. By the time I get home, I'll miss the first few hours of the event. The first 3 to 5 times is always rough until everyone figured out what we are supposed to do
---
Seems like an interesting time to put in something China related. And yes, I'm aware of the Fallout lore.
---
There is no more real Fallout. It died with Fallout 76. What I mean is that The Outer Worlds is everything Fallout used to be. If one is a fan of Fallout (real Fallout, not this insult that is Fallout 76) then Outer Worlds is the game to play.
---
You also have to remember it comes with 1600 atoms a month for $8.99 us. We were all happy playing $10 for 1500 atoms and a outfit.
---
My cans! My precious antique cans!
---
You do you, boo.
---
Yea but it's a totally unique weapon, it's not just a handmade reskin. So where is it ig rn?
---
My favourite part is that the collectron they sold to us was in the original trailer from E3 lmao. Bethesda is a joke
---
A few days ago I rolled an Explosive, Vampire, 15% faster reload... Pipe revolver.
---
That's... Literally not an opinion, people do still like the game, and I really couldn't give fucks about the downvotes either
---
Isn't it at 12 PM PDT?
---
So 3 hours from now?
---
Probably the same people that said the scrap kits were a slippery slope towards pay to win... oh wait... they were right. Oops.
---
I hope it's an update relating that, just throwing the new gun in without any new context or quest to get it will be a missed opportunity imo
---
This is literally impossible lol.
---
try server hopping
---
Hot take right there.
---
I'm genuinely not trying to be s smart ass here, but... Basically Fallout 4?
---
i dont think they every really worked right out of the box
---
You really are sucking the spoiled teat of Bethesda
---
13 a month that's what they're charging?? What a fuckin joke. I haven't signed in for a few weeks, maybe I'll keep it that way.
---
they are private. 
---
only access is from friends. 
---
but they too can be kicked. very easy
---
Said est on the website.
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
It was finished, it was just a bit unstable. The claim is it is unfinished now. It certainly is not and certainly is stable. 
---
The fame still costs $60 in many locations. So no, that was not clear. 
---
Lol your refusal to answer the question is 100% clear you are just trolling lmao
---
EDT
---
Has this event started yet?
---
Interesting, genuinely didn't know that, thanks for teaching me something!
---
However you can purchase the responses in atoms only.
---
always eastern time, never pacific.
---
Pretty sure they said you can take the helmet off of power armor and you won't take damage and all from rads and it'll count
---
Thought it was noon EST.  It‚Äôs not going for me either. I‚Äôve been hanging out at whitesprings since 11:55am est
---
I mean, does it still give you 250dr even you're done reloading while staying crouched? It's a nice tradeoff.
---
I agree. This is such a big bug and it‚Äôs overstayed its welcome.
---
Alright, I can see what you mean. I guess I am looking at it as (a) they still have to collect it all and (b) someone is always selling scrap for pennies, anyways. But when I look at it your way, I can see vast empty maps full of scrap that you have to have a sub to have to yourself.
---
Personally, I'm not ideologically opposed to a premium subscription service for Fallout 76. The reason Fallout First is so insulting is that the game has WAY less content available than ESO, the game is far less stable, and the perks that it offers are things that not only massively affect gameplay, but half of them should have been free in the first place.
---
Too good.
---
Same. Been hanging around for 30 minutes.
---
Other public events keep spawning so idk.
---
yup. everything about every Bethesda game just screams "poor management"
---
Was a recent duping exploit.
---
Nothing happened on my server either as far as a new event starting; but the new decorations spawned. Maybe it doesn‚Äôt really start until 1pm est?
---
And it was so long ago! My personal favourite is: 'We took your favourite outfit from a past game, smacked a new logo on it, and we'll give it to you if you get the subscription!' I mean, that's what the ranger armour is, right?

1pm EDT happens when this comment is 45 minutes old.

2 Silvers!
---
1, the previous games never pushed them, they were a difficulty, not the part of the main game. But I'm probably biased cuz I was never a fan of survival mechanics in any game, they always seemed unnecessary, tedious and just forced you to limit what you can do in a given amount of time.
---
BGS has turned into Bethesda Garbage Studios. Todd Howard is only interested in the so called 'fans' who are still giving them money and undeserved praise. They are now catering to gamers who probably never played a Bethesda game before Skyrim.
---
You are incredibly naive or a shill.
---
.....wat?
---
That‚Äôs really good in pvp, I would definitely love to have that
---
Should start any time. It was set for today at 12 EST.
---
No luck. Tried 2 other servers and still nothing. :(
---
Nice
---
I hope so! That's exactly what I thought the first time I played it, and why I like it so much
---
Oh god, it was in the E3 trailer? As the junk collecting variety we could buy? I mean, I can't tell the difference between that one and one of the normal ones that I am supposed to shoot on sight. So I guess what I am wondering is: how can you tell?
---
I would bet it's just a skin for the handmade. But then again maybe not. Maybe the Chinese assault rifle comes with the wastelanders update as a brand new weapon
---
It does.
---
&gt; I wish I could just look the other way and pay my 13 bucks a month like everyone else.
---
Im just visiting from r/all because fallout 76 has attention again, but jesus, do you guys even know how this sounds when you read it? You wish you could pay your 13 dollars like everyone else without feeling something? I cant even describe how this horrible is to read

They already mostly do. Do you guys go on the WOW subs and let them know your real feelings too? Cuz they been contributing for a long time already. Or all them microtransactions in ever EA sports games? Its all bathesda though. Nonsense.
---
16 times the canvas bags
---
Pretty cool
---
Honestly if the trolls against it weren't so annoying I probably would have waited to get it. Pretending like Bethesda is some monster for trying to make money so they can continue to develop the game and then that the people who get the subscription are ruining gaming was enough for me. The trolls are so entitled and it's very annoying. I work my ass off to make my money and I choose what I spent it on. I won't tell you what to spend yours on so don't tell me. Their are a significant number of people who like game as service and that's why game companies keep making them. This started over 20 years ago. If Bethesda wants to make a fallout one thats great because I love fallout!
---
How is that? As I've stated far too many times now I get Bethesda can do PR stuff on any sub they want, it's not my point.
---
16 Times the Patches
---
That kind of speech is an invitation to start a PvP. You should take the sign down, or accept that if you threaten a demographic with violence that you will probably be taken up on your offer
---
I thought we were refering to base game gta ur right though i forgot about those but by the time those came out im pretty sure a large part of the community quit playing that was about the time i did the grind got so ridiculous it wasnt even fun anymore and that depends how look at that tent if i kill a tent owner hes gna be able to respawn preety close to me im assuming never seen it so he can just keep charging me im preety sure generally u have to pick a nearby location so if he takes it i gotta run back from a nearby location
---
2 shot lever with +1 per and 250 dmg resist while reloading. That with the perks I have does about 450 dmg with a stealth attack which is all I use it for, and since I'm almost always stealth I deal good damage all the time with it
---
there are quests.
---
They‚Äôll be golden, with unbroken glass.
---
Is it supposed to auto trigger or is there something we need to do?
---
Ticket it
---
Maybe but the Chinese themed stuff feels out of place with wastelanders unless that's one of the factions. And it wouldn't make sense to be a handmade skin since the Chinese assault rifle has been in the files since launch.
---
It just works.
---
It doesnt seem to be starting for anyone rn. So I guess we wait.
---
Lol yes! Thumbs up for this post! 
---
That's actually the best one yet! And it's so funny because people thi k they're automatically indestructible and holger into god mode if people have the subscription.
---
&gt; Hence I found the "76 is buggy and FNV IS the best game ever" to be really stupid. You get downvoted for mentioning broken quests in NV.
---
Fallout New Vegas has one of the most circlejerky fanbases I've ever seen in gaming. The game was indeed barely playable on release, and even as it stands today you still need to invest a considerable amount of time installing mods just so it won't crash constantly or run poorly. And then you have the issues you can't fix, like the atrocious gunplay and ugly and flat graphics. 
---
I think it's a very good game but it has issues and its fanbase is awful.
---
Auto-trigger every hour.
---
Yeah well it's almost 12.20.
---
Short version: I'm mot going to pay a damn thing, regardless of whatever I claimed to wish for.  Just thought I'd clear that up.
---
My whitesprings is decorated for Halloween but no event yet
---
I envy you, then. in my experience the game does everything in its power to make my life miserable it seems.
---
&gt;It was finished, it was just a bit unstable. The claim is it is unfinished now.
---
Nope. That was a misunderstanding on your part.
---
&gt;Lol your refusal to answer the question is 100% clear you are just trolling lmao. 
---
Nope, I just refuse to answer the question as long as you keep calling me that. If you can motivate why it's so important for you to know - and how it's relevant to the thread - then I might be more benevolent to answer. Otherwise this is not the place for personal discussions.
---
IRL Camden park is creepier and gloomier than Fallout's...
---
If you shot them then they must've shot back, you died in the pvp and while you were fighting they destroyed your house, you lost your junk ON you only as well.. You can't lose junk from you stash. It's what you get for starting a fight in the first place.
---
It's funny how you instantly belive the rifle will be available from playing.
---
There was no bigger content drop announced by Bethesda for the near future so it's very much possible that, *if such an announcement isn't made in the next time*, that it will be exclusive to premium members.
---
I don't think they'll make it nye unplayable, they'll still fix bugs and ship out the free DLC to everyone 
---
What I can see tho is every community request we have pleaded for this past year being implemented behind the veil of 1st membership.
---
Want a dog or robot companion, want nostalgic  iconic gear, want the ability to break down unused ammo... guess what it'll be behind the fallout 1st tab in the atom shop
---
You guys are entitled little brats. Imagine if you gave a damn about something that matters instead of trying to kill something that other people like. What a concept to devote your time and energy to help people rather than trying to make everyone agree with you.
---
Yeah this is what I was hoping the ill fated survival mode would be before they turned it into an arcade shoot em up
---
For one bug
---
Here's one of em
---
it‚Äôs probably going on private servers first
---
just fallout76.ini
---
also have you tried deleting and reinstalling the launcher? If the game opens from the .exe and not from the launcher, try that first.
---
Lol bethesda is that desperate they use alts to promote how "  
---
good" it is?
---
Other subreddiots is not the answer. Removing posts and comments by mods is a bad sign from a poisoned subreddit.
---
Be happy that you are able to see posts that disagree with something.
---
Use a keyword filter in your settings if you don't got the guts for it.
---
Ah I see, mines is a snide comment but yours isn't. Sorry I forgot the remnants of this community instantly take the moral high ground by being satisfied with absolutely everything doled out to you when it comes to this game.
---
You should include some stuff about how scrap limits were imposed due to technical limitations, yet now you can pay for near unlimited amounts. Or about how the actual content players have been interested in was delayed yet this subscription was rolled out in a completely broken state. Or just the absurd price it already costs. You sound more like a politician than a consumer. If you're happy to accept it everything, be my guest. But don't imply legitimate criticisms of Bethesda are 'tantrums'. It's a massive company who has time and time again taken advantage of the loyal community 76 has fostered, not a local diner who accidentally messed up one order.
---
Well, than you know it means paying money to gain an in-game advantage, right? GTA5 definitely falls under that.
---
The event hasn't spawned for anyone yet that I can see, which doesn't surprise me much honestly aha!   
---
Hopefully this event will be a bit smoother and I hope you have fun during it! :D
---
You should begin to see some spooky decorations appearing at The Whitespring now! The Mischief Night event itself will appear about 40 minutes from this comment, and then every hour after that.
---
Probably coming later November. It's too early to drop something new in the store right now
---
Itll probably just be a skin to the handmade and not even be its own weapon.
---
Weird I haven‚Äôt seen it once yet but I haven‚Äôt played for long enough I guess.
---
Its okay gaz, I think you made your point just fine. Dont let people bully ya
---
The X-01 isn't designed for carry weight nor is it designed for best ballistic damage.
---
It literally says 50 lbs per leg on modifications. If your goal is to hoard scrap and be overweight, use the generic foodbuild go-to armor. Thats not what its for. Its like complaining the t-45 isn't the best power armor in the game. It just isn't for all that. LOL
---
TSE Gat Plas.

---
I deleted that ini. It didn‚Äôt seem to create a new one I‚Äôll try rebuilding. I haven‚Äôt reinstalled the launcher but I can‚Äôt connect to a work because of version mismatch through the .exe.
---
It‚Äôs not a personal answer lol. If you asked me why I started contributing I would say ‚Äúwell I‚Äôve been playing the game since launch and looking for a community to discuss interesting experiences in the waste land. I also think this is a good place to coordinate raids and group up. I enjoy the game and want a place where I can discuss with other players‚Äù. 
---
This isn‚Äôt difficult lol.
---
Just a bit of hyperbole, seeing as 1st defenders like to use the same argument. Y‚Äôall need to remember, GTA Online didn‚Äôt start out as P2W, it‚Äôs been around for like 6 years now. Look at where we are ONE year into 76...
---
I think Bethesda is waiting for 25 more people to post about it... so it should be any time now.
---
Bethesda can do whatever they look at this point, because they've damaged my faith in their company more than enough that I now question if I ever want to buy anything from them again.
---
They've damaged a deeply gratifying game franchise and dumbed it down to the point it's nothing more than a first person shooter with lite rpg elements. They've taken the biggest element of Fallout, choices and made them a shallow, worthless mechanic.
---
Blades could have been amazing and yet again, they decided to go the worst possible way in designing the game.
---
And fallout 76 is just the worst. They shouldn't even be able to call it a fallout game. It's like the brotherhood of Steel all over again.
---
Findings supported by my one year anniversary. Whitespring was number one until about mid spring, and it‚Äôs super rare to see after unstarred legendaries were removed.
---
Get a stingwing barb, drink beer and get a sneak critical, toss the dross. Once you beat the questline in the first few hours you don't have quests you have chores.
---
I can‚Äôt get mine to work either. I‚Äôm constantly restoring power to Poseidon
---
That's what I'm thinking
---
the direction this game should move, is jumping of the cliff with Todd
---
Its supposed to start 12pm est, so now lol probably wont work until the next hour
---
Thanks for the info!
---
They're probably more focused on figuring out what to do. And they might skip the event focusing more on how to salvage the situation.
---
Figuring out on how many people subscribed in the inferno and kept their sub. And those that subbed then said nope and canceled.
---
It's a giant PR mess, so I think they are more concerned internally on how to handle it than the event. Specially considering that its been datamined to be rather disapointing in rewards etc.
---
So right now its likely all hands to station, trying to figure a way to resolve the situation without making it worst.
---
 It was supposed to start today
---
Seriously? You know how long it'd take for a developer to go in and add snow to the entire map?  That'll push back Wastelanders even longer.  Do you understand how development even works?
---
I am losing hope.. my best 3* weapon suffers from this  D8
---
3 of those games are free to play to begin with. None of them have an actual subscription. They all are complete games. Fallout 76 has shallow content, bugs that have been there since the game launched, has had perks nerfed before a "convenience" term goes in the atom store and now they want to do a monthly subscription that 1. Gives you things that have no reason to not be part of the base game (unlimited scrap space especially.
---
2. Costs more than game pass which gives you access to over 100 games including new vegas, outer worlds, metro exodus and many more
---
That could be possible yes. I really hope they don't start locking weapons behind the pay wall
---
Guessing assault rifle
---
Totally agree on the survival mode point. I was really really hoping fo1st would include the option for survival servers. Bethesda is so tight lipped about anything survival mode, I really wish they'd just be straight up about abandoning the concept or not so we can move on
---
I think we should have game modes with characters for those specific modes that run part of this. So easy/casual would be 2. A normal mode would be 3. And a Hardocre mode should be 5, (on this mode if you died it should migrate you to either normal or easy, your choice, and have a better loot reward for playing this mode).
---
The Whitespring is being prepared for Mischief Night as we speak and you should see spooky Halloween decor now. The Mischief Night event itself will start about 35 minutes from this comment and then every hour after that (as OP mentioned in another comment).
---
I‚Äôm wondering what the deal is the NW rewards?
---
It was supposed to start 25 minutes ago, according to their website.
---
What if you genuinely enjoy playing though?
---
Mama Dolce's was technically a faction since FO3
---
Not only what you said about vast empty/private maps but they also have no lasting consequence for picking up every junk item they come across in public lobbies too because they can just dump it in the limitless scrap box. They can out supply non subs in every way even in public lobbies due to their tent. If ingame economics was some sort of, idk... competition, they would win.
---
Welcome to what a survival game is like.  If you have any clue about a survival games then you wouldn't be surprised and you would be happy at how little work you actually have to do.
---
Thanks for that info, I gotta get remote play set up so I can play it at work haha
---
You noticed that, eh?
---
I don't think it's Bethesda PR though. It's more likely it's the contrarian gamers who are so far down the sunk cost fallacy hole that they think $20 for a power armor skin is a smoking deal and need to defend their game at all costs. Remember, folks will defend a corporate product to their deaths without being paid all day long. Just look at how dedicated to defending the "honor" of the company certain Apple people are, or Tesla people, and stuff like that.
---
Paid PR these days usually winds up looking like those Amazon worker accounts that were all over Twitter a few weeks ago, lol
---
Oh god, it would break my heart. I'd have to pay $15/month for the rest of my life to keep Rover alive.
---
Fuck fallout76
---
Yes, a lot of attention to detail on both!
---
Dozens of hours? Getting the oppressor mk2 takes like 100s of hours unless you have friends to boost your cash flow.
---
See if you save more caps from all the tent uses you can make the mother of all bottle cap mines (in 3 or 4 months of play). Then with your hoard of 76 million nuclear wastes you can make a dirty bomb to clear all of the WV wastelands! GET TO WINNING!!!!
---
35 minutes? Damn. So an hour late? I really wanted to catch the first event. You do realize it's a weekday and people have schedules, right? Same thing happened with Fasnacht. Could this preparation not have been done a little earlier?
---
Yeah the first main quest had like 4 different outcomes that you could choose from.
---
I question your use of the words "happy" and "all" (not to mention "we").  And your math is wrong.  But the subscription coming with $16 worth of Atoms for $13 US (or $10 US if you spend $100) -- enough to by a few interesting textures or poses in the grotesquely overpriced Atomic Shop -- is not forgotten.  It just doesn't change anything I've said.
---
Oh wait, there is still no pay to win
---
In my brain, that sounded like the scorchbeast screeching at the end there...
---
I know! Year after year they have a lot of volunteers help out. Truly awesome!
---
The current conversion rate puts that at about $15 USD
---
I get exchange rates are bullshit but God damn
---
Imagine using your mod powers to pin your opinion at the top like it's a fact.
---
They honestly need to just drop their current engine. It's outdated. They've been using it since 2003
---
Shhhh!! Nobody can know!
---
Yeah I played on game pass to see if I liked it and now plan on buying it first chance I get.
---
Not an opinion
---
I‚Äôve been stood at the Whitespring for 28 minutes now. Playing on a PS4. We all still boned the event spawn or am I that lucky?
---
I pay money and I get to overcome or beat or win a game mechanic, what do you call beating a game mechanic in exchange for real money?
---
I enjoy discussing the game. That's it.
---
Satisfied? Ofcourse not.
---
I will have to agree! I grew up riding the Big Dipper and the game is pretty accurate. Lol. A lot of good memories there, but I wish they would've included the haunted house.
---
Look at the sub, the apologists are already starting to win out. People will just never let themselves blame Bethesda or stop playing this game which is beyond me in a time where there are so many games you haven‚Äôt played from the past and present to play. 
---
Why should Bethesda say anything. They‚Äôre making money from the ‚Äútrust me I only tried 1st for a month just to see, I DONT SUPPORT THEIR PRACTICES, but I wanted to see.‚Äù People
---
It's the same engine they used for oblivion and morrowind so there's bound to be some leftover code
---
So I don't have much work to do? then what do I have to do? Its a limited survival game and a limited RPG
---
Great, thanks.
---
Is it still pay to win if I can get the same in game item without spending money?
---
 Yes that's right. The sheer idiocy of this latest blow up inspired me to acquire F1st mainly for the armour to upset you and the rest of the halfwits involved.
---
 The community cried for private servers. They gave em' to you at a very reasonable cost and you went ballistic. Suck it up.
---
All of your comments are negative though. Why do you like discussing a game you don‚Äôt play? This does not make any sense.
---
*gasp* Not... pay to win!! Say it ain't so!
---
OP I was also wondering if this was to appeal to Chinese audiences but after thinking about it I no longer believe this to be the case. Just more fleshing out the world and different post-war powers. It did say the Mama Dolce's spy group was waiting on reinforcements, could be a plot point later
---
30 minutes until it starts.
---
It's not "negativity" to call out a company for a bullshit anti-consumer move. If anything, it's what everyone SHOULD do to attempt to hold them accountable to something other than the wallets of their board members.
---
This sub would explode if that happens but i agree. In the end though whos going to pay for a base non legendary? It could be like the fixer though were you can get legendary variants with scrip but that would how could that not turn everyone off.
---
Be careful, I posted something similar and the fo76 fanboys cried like babies.
---
Pc
---
You can always get more creative with your camp, group up and run raids. That‚Äôs about it for now.
---
What a bullshit story.
---
1. I can agree it's wrong to harass people, obviously. but that's not really the point. people will do whatever they want, similarly to how they spend their money.
---
2. it's impossible not to when it's oftentimes plastered all over "real" news websites that X was banned from Y for saying Z.
---
3. again, that's not the point I was trying to make. like you said, words have power, cause and effect, etc. regardless of who you are, or how old you are, things you say can and will come back to bite you in the ass regardless of whether that's the right thing.
---
4. I'm not trying to discuss nuanced topics such as what's right, or just. simply pointing out human nature regardless of the aforementioned things.
---
5. in the real world that doesn't really matter. people will come up with ways to legally terminate wrongthinkers and you usually can't make a case proving otherwise.
---
6. yes, I would. would you buy a fast travel pass for 1 dollar? I see the point you're trying to make but that's not something we should even bother considering because it's never going to happen. mobile companies already charge thousands of dollars for digital goods. it's not a dystopian future, it's sitting on your desk right now. we wouldn't be having this discussion if it was possible for Bethesda to lower prices instead of adopting even more predatory practices. however that is never happening.
---
Point what is opinion
---
I miss the farm with the airplane, I was so happy when I found it in game.
---
‚ÄúThere is no war in Ba Sing Se‚Äù
---
Now I'm going to have to go looking for... [this!](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/cq76in/draw_me_like_one_of_your_french_girls/)
---
Most of the additions added to the game have been community feature requests. Bethesda didn't plan vending machines, vault raids, or backpacks. Those were community suggestions, same with display cases and adding legendary variants to the new weapons added
---
It sounds like we need to buy DLC in fo76 but so far you don‚Äôt even need subscription for them.
---
Play up to 3 minutes early with first!
---
No i dont do sub fees of any kind only game i ever subbed to was runescape years ago but im a cheapskate u gotta have insane content to make it worth it to me u have a point on the atoms i cant speak to base game eso but as i remember eso used to have an online fee as well alotta people thought was strange so ur right that they dont have a problem with esos pass but im preety sure that is because it has alotta content u get the dlc i think which is preety big factor the crafting bag idk what else in fallout what do i get to play dress up and with myself and honestly idk why people thought the servers were gna be free  i also asumed they were gonna cost and for me that storage box is the only reason that sub fee bothers me was shitty thing to do throwing it in there
---
That's good to know TY!
---
What are you talking about?
---
 Did you ever get your character built? I have mine pretty well together at level 111, but there are a few more things.
---
I‚Äôm in the ‚Äúwhat am I going to do today‚Äù position too. I server hop at the converted munitions factory looking for an abandoned setup. 
---
Free ammo, and I‚Äôm always in need of 5mm.
---
Didn't the Atomic Shop change about 30 minutes ago?
---
Thanks for this OP
---
Starting the event  exactly as planned would be against company policy at this point.
---
&gt; What they've done makes me question if there are difficulties in the first place. 
---
The way Bethesda presented the information wasn't dishonest, but it sure as hell was unethical.   
---
Before I get into the details, there is a difference between items in a game. Items without IDs, or "spam", can be stored without limit because it's just a repeating asset. Typically, the quantity is stored as a value, but only one render is required. Bullets would be spam: one image, unlimited quantity.
---
For items with IDs, things get more complicated, and Bethesda chose to conflate the two types of items by announcing it would "break" their game.
---
Items with IDs are bound to an element. An example of this is a scope on a rifle. Both the scope and rifle have individual IDs, so the game knows what asset(s) to apply to the element. Once the items are bound, a new ID is applied to the combination of items.
---
To the game, this requires multiple assets to be rendered based on the IDs comprising the combined element. The game needs to know to render the appropriate scope on the appropriate weapon.
---
In addition, there are other elements to track, such as location of the weapon (on person, dropped, in inventory, etc). 
---
Individually, this wouldn't be an issue. Add in millions of players, and this is where the game can break, and Bethesda would be correct on this.
---
Bethesda's announcement of an "endless" locker is just outright bullshit. I can guarantee no one playing the game can store an infinite amount of weapons or armor in the container. The game will definitely crash.
---
Instead, Bethesda decided to put the container behind a paywall, despite it costing nothing on their end to maintain or implement. It's just another database storing the counts of the spam. I'm sure it can hold some special weapons and armor, but no way "infinite".
---
If the rumors of a third party investor or IPO release are true, this would explain such gross negligence, dishonesty, and greed. It's inexcusable no matter what's going on behind the scenes.
---
I'm truly confused how anyone can still be loyal to Bethesda, which clearly cares nothing for its fans.
---
You are correct. [Back when the Chinese Assault Rifle was originally datamined,](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cf2jp8/chinese_assault_rifle_barrel_and_stock_for/) it turns out it's just a barrel and stock mod for the Handmade rifle since the Handmade is spiritually the Chinese Assault Rifle. It's not gonna be it's own seperate weapon
---
So play it. Quit wasting your time trolling fan pages. Someone else liking a game that you don't takes nothing away from you and doesn't harm you.
---
Grow up and move on.
---
Thought so.  Others are reporting hackers cheating  rampant on PC.   might be the case here.  Not sure
---
Stop calling people who paid fucking 60 dollars for a video game ‚Äúfreeloaders‚Äù
---
 I have worn T Shirt and Slacks throughout most of the game. My high level has a White Wolf Fedora as well. :)
---
Bethesda PR? You mean like... all 5 of them? These vocal uproars about game changes usually only last a week or two, until the people posting give up and dwindle away. People still play and enjoy the game, they aren't "overpowering" the Reddit. You have the situation reversed. It's the vehement complaining that overpowers regular posts from people just playing and enjoying the game. I know there is some cognitive dissonance with the fact people posting that they enjoy the game might just be regular everyday folks at home and not paid Bethesda shills.  
---
Also this Reddit does make me laugh because there is the general belief that we represent the majority of the people playing the game, even though the game sold millions of copies and has several hundred thousand active users. These posts get 5k-6k upvotes and we take that as confirmation it must be reality. It's not even a fraction of a percent and the majority of players don't come here or the forums.
---
Oi it's some classy pose here.
---
It's just a bunch of new Halloween stuff.
---
25 hours if you ONLY do story, plenty of replay ability due to major choices along the entire ride and the viability of every type of build, and a game you only pay for once with no microtransactions, DLC, or ridiculous subscription service. Oh yea, totally not worth it whatsoever.
---
Why don't you make a list of everything you want to know about me and send it to me in a PM instead. Why I like discussing, why this, why that, what is my shoe size, etc etc. We are done here.
---
Have you completed all the challenges?
---
I'm not calling everyone a freeloader.   But if the shoe fits...
---
No one asked for free DLC, Bethesda promised it. If free DLC only comes if people pay for stuff in the atomic shop or in fall out first...it‚Äôs not free DLC.
---
That would be funny as fuck if fallout 1st members get wastelanders a week earlier lol
---
Lol. Sorry you ran out of lulz troll
---
Run laps around greater Watoga.  I normally start at wherever census violence is.  Good for a few legendaries.  Fast traveling is a fun killer, half the fun IS in the journey.

If you look at the Chinese assault rifle however, it looks like the reflex site is the exact same for the handmade, I‚Äôm hoping it is a new weapon though

I didn't say anything about bitchfests. I've seen plenty of posts that are removed that aren't negative in any way. I was just hoping to help anyone that goes there avoid having posts that violated the rules getting removed.
---
One of the things that upset a lot of people is what consequences this will have for the video game industry. A small payment here, a small payment there. .. eventually this will all add up and other game companies will do it as well. Each purchase you make for fallout 1st is essentially saying that these microtransactions are good. Every purchase you make gives Bethesda a tab on the back saying "hey, you did a good job". You alone might not make all the difference, but you are still supporting Bethesda in monetizing everything.
---
maybe it's just you
---
I still like the game and I know at least one other person who does... people being the plural of person, between the two of us I can now confirm it is a fact. You're welcome.  
---
Also you can just use your eyes to look in-game at all the Fallout 1st players. Or even just the regular players.
---
Sure it is.  Lots od people havent paid a dime past the original purchase and they're not paying to play the DLC either.  If they want to freeload off of the rest of us, no biggie.  I'd just like them to own up to their freeloading.
---
*laughs in monster hunter*
---
They did at some point. The corn outfit was for sale in the Atomic Shop for quite a while.

How many times do you want to hear the same complaint over and over again? People complained, I'm sure Bethesda noticed, now what? You want the whole sub to ruminate in negativity? Send Bethesda emails if you want but other people in this sub just want a community. I don't know what you're expecting us to do about Fallout First, you either buy it or you don't.
---
60% of the time, it works every time
---
They said it will start in about 20mins from now.
---
Yeah come back in 2057, what is your next advice?
---
This is a literal case of hate the game not the player. 
---
I mean BS wanted a pvp element in game
---
Being a hardcore fan of capitalism.  True capitalism nkt crony.  I dont mind when it wins.  When capitalism wins freedom of choice wins.  The community has free choice to buy this shit and ruin the franchise and that's why I'm appealing to them.
---
How dare you talk about Codsworth like that. Lol
---
In about 20mins from now.
---
Unstopable monster and explosive bloodied the dragon
---
&gt;Ah I see, mines is a snide comment but yours isn't.
---
Oh mine is absolutely a snide remark. The difference is I knew exactly who and what I was making that remark about. The same can not be said for you.
---
&gt; You should include some stuff about how scrap limits were imposed due to  technical limitations, yet now you can pay for near unlimited amounts.  
---
Scrap limits were not imposed because of technical limits. The Stash size was imposed due to technical limits due to how the game treats weapons, armor, bobble heads, etc.  Junk was a byproduct of that restriction. That said it is an issue but rather then focus on just that people have been throwing a shit fit about everything else.  Blowing up the single issue so far out of proportion that it discredits the very arguments against it. 
---
&gt;  Or about how the actual content players have been interested in was  delayed yet this subscription was rolled out in a completely broken  state. 
---
You do realize people are capable of walking and chewing gum at the same time. And making a 3 course meal is different then microwaving a frozen lasagna right? Trying to treat everything as the same is the argument of a child who can't fathom the difference between things.
---
&gt; Or just the absurd price it already costs 
---
Show me that Bethesda is over charging for server rentals. Because I've asked literally 115 people this question already and 100 never answers the questions and the remaining 15 have shown examples that are literally within a couple of dollars difference.
---
Not really lol, by buying something you tell a company that you like and support that specific thing
---
They are clearly going to copy ESO model for monetisation, it‚Äôs working there it will work here.
---
Lol I grew up in Hurricane too, everyone reading your comment here will pronounce it wrong lmao
---
I think people that come into outer worlds hoping it's going to be some massive game are bound to be disappointed. It's not Skyrim or FO, but it's also not a bad game simply because it isn't a huge sandbox. There is a space between huge sandbox games like FO and linear stories like Uncharted.

Cliffs can jump? Why is Todd jumping with cliffs?

Don‚Äôt blame you I found a backpack plan somewhere on a new character so I didn‚Äôt have to do the awful quests.

Will you pass it along to make the press releases a little more clear. Saying something starts at noon is different than the decorations appearing at noon with nothing actually starting. Not a huge issue but there were like 10+ people at whitespring at noon all thinking it was going to start and by 12:05 most were thumbs down and angry face emote. 
---
Instead of saying the event starts at noon, saying the bot is showing up at noon to set up decorations, or something. Would help cut down on some of the negativity and misconceptions players have
---
Question:  Where was the outrage from the user base when people exploited the game and duplicated hundreds of items and then opened up Facebook trading posts and E bay accounts to capitalize on cheating?  There was some, granted, but never to this level.  So the users themselves are either paying or cheating to win, but nobody said much?  Instead I, like thousands of others, joined a FB group, that for me, turned out to be an eye opener.  The 2nd person I met online to swap gear with, had 3 full copies of the best armor in the game, listed in his inventory.  There were hundreds of people in that one group alone - so nobody can say "that was just a few people".  Every one of them, looking for an "advantage" of some kind, self included.   
---
Question:  If you were a Software company, and you had thousands of people taking advantage of your mistakes, and compromising the overall dynamic and game-play, would you feel sorry for them?  Why is this "loyalty" that Bethesda is supposed to be giving us only uni-directional?    
---
Question:  Does anyone think the one-shot weapon builds or God level armor (which there are way more of due to cheating); preventing honest players from being kicked from their workbench after they spent 30 caps and a ton of camp resources to protect it, was fair?    
---
Conclusion:  I think we gamers have forfeited our right to claim "unfairness" or "pay to win" regarding this game.  Do a Reddit and YouTube search for all the ways to locate and exploit this game over the past 12 months.  We've bastardized this game by cheating, stealing, scamming and bullying everyone in the community.  And at the same time, chastise Bethesda for not being honest?  Personal accountability gentle persons... personal accountability.
---
The way I see things, if wastlanders doesnt come out and blow us away, with a amazing new storyline, tons of sidequests and interesting things to do, I dont see fallout 76 surviving more than a few years.
---
Trading posts are no longer allowed on /r/fo76. There are a multitude of trading subreddits available - please submit to a trading subreddit of your choice instead. If your post is not about making a trade, please message the subreddit moderators using the link at the end of this message and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
I made a post critical of the fallout 1st and the mods removed it. No explanation or mod mail given.
---
Time for another 6 month break. I played for 100s of hours since day 1 for about 3-4 months. Got geared unlocked all the plans an built a ton of CAMPS. Took a 5-6 month break, came back an got caught up on the few micro dlcs. But there isnt anything to do for end game once you have some gear. They haven't given any DLC to increase power or added anything that's like a must have. So there litterally is zero endgame progression. Making alts is such a more an I dont understand how people have legit 5 alts with all max caps an gear as well as their mains.
---
So download Xbox game pass or something for 1$ an download yourself some new games an return in 6 months. You probably wont miss anything since they dont seem in a hurry or anything to fix more bugs or get the legit conent going.
---
I'm looking forward to it. I've enjoyed all of the community events so far.
---
They already have tbh private servers are supposedly more stable and lag free.
---
Would you prefer a game that takes 20 minutes to reach a resource then 10 minutes to harvest it to as much as you can carry and then 20 minutes return trip. Resulting in creating a single item for your camp taking literally 8 hours of harvesting and processing resources to create a grinder?
---
You need to start the game to rebuild the .ini files. 
---
Do you run the launcher after each game update? I think the launcher is used to check for new versions of the game and update your installation. Not sure what " I can‚Äôt connect to a work because of version mismatch through the .exe." means.
---
hey Todd, if you fix all the bugs and add actual end-game PVE content I'll give you money for it /s
---
I am talking about people complaining how they‚Äôre being attacked by other players in game.
---
I know you're being facetious, but this isn't a bad idea... BGS has already shown they're down with charging us for our ideas, so now this is exactly what's gonna happen...
---
Fallout 4 Survival was a lot of fun. I want separate servers or the option to have private servers to be hardcore survival.
---
Qq, they release it too soon. Qq they delay it to polish and release a working expansion. 
---
 Fundamental services? Roflmao. And it's 12.99 a month. Don't buy the entire year, silly. Good lord gamers are the most dramatic people in existence.
---
It will trigger at the top of every hour I believe. So in 17 minutes
---
It ain't so. It's just pay for game changing QoL improvemets that give you an advantage. So.. P4GCQoLITGYA? Eh, how about just pay for advantage? p4a
---
Sorry for sounding stupid,but what‚Äôs a brief explanation of said bug?
---
So as too not eat up too much of anyone‚Äôs time?
---
I‚Äôm on lunch &amp; don‚Äôt really have time too research it...
---
But I do ‚Äúattempt‚Äù too be In the know,fer what it‚Äôs worth.
---
Plus this Is a happy distraction from all the complaints about 1st,fer me anyhow.
---
Its the whole outfit. You craft both pieces at an armour station, suit in outfits and head in headwear.
---
Any pics for people at work?
---
Ugh really - what's in it for those of use at work?
---
Does it add to/include the bundle from last week \[straw bales, 2x pumpkins, smoke machine etc\] or is it just a separate atom grab?
---
The decorations are there, but nothing else is new.
---
It's not about the cost for the average person, it's about what they're giving you and its just not worth $100/yr no matter how you slice it.
---
I put down FO4 for about a year because it was so hideous that I resented spending time in the game and I was having a hard time taking the Castle at a low level. I went back to Skyrim with its incredible auroras and diversity of climate. When I came back to FO4 I hunted down a flora overhaul mod and beat the whole dang thing. I also fell down a mod-hole and now I can never go back to vanilla; I understand that's common, haha. I get what you're saying but I also don't want to sink my time/money into something unrelentingly ugly/dismal.
---
Hate the game, not the player.
---
In what way? *In what way?*
---
 How can you respond to a bunch of children going ballistic over fuck all?
---
Just hope they don't charge $50 for bank access/merchant anywhere, and I hope they don't add $100 mansions, and I hope they don't put races behind a $20 paywall. Other than those things, ESO has good monetization
---
Yeah if its not in this list, they missed it
---
What is this "fast travel" of which you speak?  I'm always running overloaded so I can rebuild anything on the fly when I'm far from home.  With my Excavator armour, I can usually load the game wearing it and spec out at 485 lbs and "sprint" - total carry weight goes up to 1900.  I was hoping that similar torso and leg mods on the X01 armour would have a similar effect and not be so fragile in combat.  No such luck.  Same Marsupial mutation, same heavy carry perks, same armour mods . . . still only 385 pounds and no extra "bonus" for loading the game while wearing the armour.
---
Codsworth is the 1% exception. Is that better?
---
Saying Bethesda doesn't have PR poeple here making posts and voting according to what Bethesda tells them is a flat out lie. Every single major corporation does this.  We can discuss whether it has much impact or not if we like, but that is all.
---
thank you very much.

---
How can't you? Do you realize how large the minecraft team is that pushes out new content each week? I mean they just came out with a whole new game mechanic less than a week ago with the honey blocks acting like a second slime block that doesn't stick to slime blocks.
---
They pump out more content in minecraft than this game does. I mean just look at how much they have put out since this years minecon, its more than fo76 has put out since launch.
---
What lol how much stuff in/was in the atomic shop is from FO4
---
Yeah because it was so much smarter to delay and release this alone VS releasing it along with Wastelanders as they probably intended. /s
---
I was actually worried about giving them ideas before I posted this but I felt it needed to be said.
---
Half-baked post, you mean.
---
But why are you upset whales are paying for further development of a game we seem to both care enough to argue other people about? I mean otherwise you would just forget about it and play another game. So obviously it has meaning to you.
---
I remember years ago when ea games had online passes and few years later they said they made money onnit but it wasnt worth the bad publicity interesting what games have become
---
That‚Äôs a good point. Can‚Äôt argue with that. Just bad timing with the much anticipated wastelanders update.  I was really looking forward to that.
---
I think fallout 76 wastelandwrs is the last piece of substantive content and after they will gut the crew even further and monetize the fanbase for as long as the profit is in the positives
---
If you're on Xbox, I want to show up just to jump from the top in my PA.
---
I'd prefer some engaging endgame content. There is currently nuke the queen or grind the raids and nothing else. The queen has been beaten into the dirt since it has been all there is for most of the game's life and the raids are ghost towns.
---
I have to wonder if the modders had a choice in their stuff going onto the CC
---
Stupid question, how do you go afk without being kicked? I also been wanting to spend hours online to let people shop at my camp but the problem is that school and work been taking a large portion of my time especially with hours lecture will have to transcribe to my notebook and learning how to use R studio for an upcoming project.
---
What‚Äôs interesting with all those things people are saying ESO is different and every monetisation there is justify because more content, I‚Äôm like wtf we are either judging system or the price? As price is dictated by market and there is no good or bad pricing.
---
I think you are a good mod, genuinely because you seem to just enforce the rules. Mostly impartially. That‚Äôs awesome.
---
My 2 primaries:
---
Bloodied FSS Grognak's Axe (+1 STR)
---
Bloodied Explosive Prime Railway Rifle (+1 AGI)
---
Im not surprised at all. So many youtubers gathering followers from those that are not content with something or need something to be angry at. 
---
Thats also very much some countries leaders gets the votes.
---
this is too deep for the kiddies to understand
---
What do you get when a cross an already buggy and content lacking game with broken promises with a subscription service that shows how the company abandoned any prospect of recovering the game?
---
You get what you FUCKING DESERVE
---
*uninstalls*
---
You can do the same thing with the private servers, pop into a private server, grab all the power stations to get multiple fusion cores per minute, while also holding the ammo depot pumping out 556 rounds which are used as high end trading currency due to no limit like caps.
---
So fallout 1st lets you create money for yourself while afking.
---
There is also a free smiley pumpkin up on the store!  
---
Looks like everyones gonna be grinding the dailies/weeklies for this one
---
plus recon scope vs No recon scope. Assault rifle is way more fun
---
I did notice this. The first private server I opened had 0 legendaries. I did uranium fever, 3 crowned enemies, no legendaries. Awol armaments, 1 crown, 0 legendaries. Free range, 1 crowned Sheepsquatch, no legendaries. Fought a few crowned scorchbeasts, and crowned super mutants at west tek, no legendaries. 
---
I quit the server and opened a new one, same server. Had to wait a while for the server to close.  Every server since then has been fine. Just one with no legendaries. But yes, you are not alone.
---
Have you seen how bad the cheating is in NW?!? Hacking is just as common in this game as GTAO.
---
Need some ointment for that burn..
---
they won't read any of this you realize
---
I was wondering about what ever happened to the pip-boy version of the game.
---
Wastelanders will be a Fallout 1st exclusive just you wait.
---
Sometimes it takes a bit to get back into.  I find the top of the world to be a good place to start to get back in the groove.  Enemy spawns kinda max out around 30 there, there is a lot of junk and weapons to pick up to sell to vendors or scrap to make bullets, and there are some lead veins in the area to mine (excavator power armor gives 4x the yield) to help craft bullets.  Also advise picking up a lot of cloth and acid to help make gunpowder and craft ammo.
---
You beat me to it by two minutes; take your upvote!
---
anyone still supporting this game is part of the problem, you are the reason bethesda keeps lying ripping people off and generally fucking people over. stop buying their garbage, Bethesda thinks you are all morons and those of you still giving them money are proving them right bethesda is by far the worst company in gaming now, they have surpassed EA
---
Combat hackers? Have you played NW? LOL
---
Ok. Well it is the #2 target and now has an added gridding insentive.
---
For those wondering it's Hurricuhn.
---
I spent my money on CoD MW
---
That Bethesda his nothing to do with this sub.
---
Not in an official capacity but it's not impossible they have employees attempting to sway opinion on the sub. It's not that I believe they are it's just impossible for you to know if they are involved in the sub or not. Therefore, opinion.
---
Calm tf down.  I'm sure the world's not gonna end because you missed ONE opportunity to try the event.
---
Configuration files exist in two locations. In my computer they are in:
---
C/Program Files (x86)/games/FO76/Fallout 76/
---
C/Users/YOUR USER NAME/Documents/My Games/Fallout 76/
---
Noon is just when JES2R started its trek from Freddies down to Whitesprings.  Takes about an hour for that Eyebot to make the trip.
---
Yeah I know but it‚Äôs worth a shot and who knows they might read it but they probably won‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs still worth a shot
---
But they increased 2-3 star enemies spawns and drops.
---
A few weeks before people also would've said this sub would explode if there would be an premium membership. Now it is. 3 days of rage and now there are more and more people here that defend F1.. That's the future of gaming I guess.
---
It's all that "new math" they teach them in school.  They expect something for nothing and cry if they don't get it.
---
Seriously, employees don't work for free.  Content doesn't just make itself.  And if people want new content, and Bethesda offered that content for free to everyone, then it has to be funded somehow.  Hence... Atomic Shop and Fallout 1st.  Maybe they should have just sold the DLC off in chunks, though I'm sure these same people would still be on here crying about something.
---
They're obviously not peer-to-peer since none of the peers have all the server-side information to actually host it.
---
Instruments I believe work for that.
---
You have a point...I don't know much about Minecraft to argue about, only what I searched before I post the reply, Bethesda have ~400 employees and Mojang ~70 and a Java engine its a lot easier than the shitty old FO76 engine, but not sure if that is really relevant...I'd have to search more about, for now I'll take your word on that.
---
Incorrect, they are "cloud based" using AWS when the server isn't being used it isn't being charged. AWS scales per player count, so it isn't like there is empty servers not being used, if the server is empty the cloud closes it. They aren't bethesdas servers, as they have none, they are all amazons servers.
---
They probs share same attachments bc what would be the point of adding totally new relfex sights and such when they can use the premade ones they have for a weapon similar in form
---
I think what the guy above is trying to say is, that if people are willing to pay for it, then it's de facto saying they want it. Video games are a luxury good for entertainment. If you don't want it, you don't buy it. I don't play candy crush because, while I enjoy the game, I don't enjoy feeling pushed to spend money and refuse to spend money on it.
---
OTOH, in my mispent youth I paid for the dlc COD MP maps despite them costing 25% of the base game. Because I wanted to play on them. I sent the signal that dlc MP maps could be sold aside from the game, by doing exactly that.
---
So, if you don't want FO 1st, don't buy it. If you don't want to buy lootboxes in Fortnite, don't. If you don't want p2w mechanics, don't play those games. Instead, funnel your money towards games that you approve of and want to play.
---
Not to say I don't understand your plight. I think a lot of internet rage is at everyone else buying into and incentivizing behavior you don't want. Just yelling at companies to do better isn't how you stop shit like FO 1st, but we also can't stop anyone from buying into it if they want to. So, the best we can do is support games like OW that are trying to provide the games we want, while not supporting Bethesda or Bioware or Activision or any other developer that uses mechanics we don't like.
---
Dude... 12pm. Not 12am
---
We pay their debts to Providence Equity** 
---
FTFY
---
and to answer your question, yes.
---
Much more aggressive monetisation model in ESO is ok but here it‚Äôs outrages. Only thing I‚Äôm upset about are fake promises they made, ‚Äòyou will get all for free for the next 10 years‚Äô like what the fck was the reason to do that üòê
---
Rip hornwright HQ :(
---
Was my favorite spot but Bethesda hates fun.
---
I loved raining down 3 artillery cannons to the ground and flinging myself off with spikeboard traps.
---
'spaghetti is delicious' is an opinion
---
'I like spaghetti' is a statement of fact 
---
'Some people like spaghetti' is also a statement of fact
---
An actual survival mode like games such as DayZ would be interesting.
---
You start with nothing and you have to search for gear.
---
Nobody is shown on the map.
---
Legendary gear is not a thing and you drop everything when you die.
---
There are so many game modes that would work really well with this game.
---
I personally think Nuclear Winter was a nice addition to the game.
---
I may need to test this again, but I did see the +250 stay while crouched, however after I was hit by an enemy the +250 was removed even while still crouched.
---
You'll be fine, snowflake.
---
Nah. People need to make it clear that shit like this isn't okay
---
Some people rubberband the movement joystick on there controller.
---
It is a good game, and not just because 76 is a bad game. For some reason it reminds me of Bioshock as much as it does Fallout though. It's more linear/combat oriented, and all of the consumables feel similar for whatever reason.
---
I get it,you want to defend your favourite Bethesda, but this is unreasonable. They have gone too far and is pushing for EVERYTHING to be monetized. Stop whatever you're doing. Please, for the entire gaming industry. All other games will pick up on this and eventually it'll be alright to sell anything in game. Wanna play?  Just buy 10 more minutes for 5$!
---
I got one of those! It's awesome
---
I haven't given Bethesda a dime in this game (bought merchandise though) since the bugged release of the Mr Fuzzy ride.  That they didn't even play test it and everything else shows no intent to make the game 'just work'.  I'll keep playing a little, but I'm done as a revenue source for them in the actual game.
---
I'm loving Outer Worlds. Characters are great, dialogue is sufficient, and the combat is fine enough - although that's never been my main want of these types of RPG's. I also feel I usually have more than a few ways to solve a lot of quests. Most importantly about that, some ways are not explained at all and its just using creativity. While it gets compared to all these other games, I still feel like I'm in an distinct (although influenced) universe. 
---
My main gripe with Outer Worlds honestly is that I cannot put my fucking weapon away without it coming out. I hold the button down to holster it and then when i press the same button to talk or open a door, it just comes out again.
---
There's a big difference between those cheats and cheats.
---
How did you stack those stairs?? I can never get them to stack.
---
I‚Äôve been accused several times of being a Bethesda PR. If you don‚Äôt have evidence it‚Äôs a Bethesda employee, don‚Äôt say it is.
---
Liking the game is not evidence either.
---
Shhhhhh it's our secret! ü§êüôä
---
It varies from where you start. It's 50~
---
Got to love how this sub goes with two different definitions of p2w depending on if they are talking about fo76 or any other game.
---
Use a controller, go into camera mode, loop rubber band on analog sticks... stay active till server shuts down
---
The running of the sub, but I get your point
---
Then this game has been p2w for a while.
---
Haha dude Bethesda is not wasting time trying to sway opinions in a fucking subreddit lmao learn how the world works.
---
It‚Äôs happened to me before, I‚Äôve actually been on both ends of this. Best solution I can give is he probably hit you exclusively with headshots.
---
Beating the game here is killing SBQ and you can easily do it, all other stuff is the sandbox to enjoy and they want to monetise it somehow, they should go with cosmetics but someone has stupid idea to give away atoms for free what killed this monetisation model
---
No, I'm trying to follow the forum rules while you keep breaking them.
---
Haha... the kind of post this sub-reddit needs right now. Bless you.
---
Omgggggg what a good doggo! I love his little barrel thing!
---
The fewer the people, the more stable the server. That's presumably why they limited private servers to 8 people.
---
Fallout 76 was trash before it was announced. I remember all the idiots telling me to pre order, I didn't really care for it. Well it was trash at release and still continues to be trash. I'm just glad I never even bothered with it.
---
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always going to be new content, changes in game balance, whatever it takes, and by the way, it‚Äôs all free after launch ‚Äì all our content, there‚Äôs no season pass and no paid DLCs." "All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76--all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff--is going to be free. That's important. And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand--look there's a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we're going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you're getting for your $60," "That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I'm getting that stuff for free. That feels right." -Pete Hines
---
What you are encouraging isn't okay
---
I have orange under armor, full set up heavy compat reinforced, and the rare fireman's helmet
---
Because you can grind atoms in this game just like you can grind jobs in GTAO for money. So they can "be earned in game so its not p2w". At least that is the most common excuse I hear in this sub as why the fridge, scrapbot, kits, etc. aren't p2w in this game, since you can grind 5 atom points weekly achievements.
---
I played the game played alot actually and ive seen some of the more popular youtubers blow some of the bugs out of proportion but i see alot of people on here call yongyea out and they never say why what he says is wrong i watch his vids once in a while other than a few mistakes most of what he says is true from ive seen
---
The game was launched broken, has been plagued with issues and Bethesda's response has effectively been 'Meh, this is fine'.
---
I just started playing 76 few weeks ago and I‚Äôm amazed by the generosity of higher level players in this game. Almost everyone I have encountered has given me something: plans, ammo, etc. I‚Äôve read that this is common, but didn‚Äôt know it when started playing. I also started helping lower level players as well.
---
And I have been killed just once by another player. I was doing the military base quest, shooting robots coming from left and right. Then suddenly this another player runs in, I accidentally shoot him/her and then he/she guns me down. No harm happened there, but that‚Äôs the only time a real player has shot me. 
---
Generally all the players I‚Äôve met have been really nice. So I thank you all for that.
---
I've moved on.  I think I had as far back as July or so of this year.  
---
Unlike a standard RPG where I'll have multiple characters to do multiple playthroughs I see no initiative to do so in this game.  Call it fatigue, call it lack of a story that I can influence directly, call it whatever you want.
---
But I do know that I don't feel as though I wasted my time with them moving to this paid service.  My wife and I enjoyed the game thoroughly (including with the rough patches at launch), but we're ready to move on to other games.
---
I don't play the game enough to justify the $100 expense and both of us are too cheap to pay $100 for a game we've put hundreds of hours into already.
---
I'd rather go invest my money into another game elsewhere for substantially less cash, especially as the game starts to spin its wheels on content and goes in 5-6 different directions for the game.
---
The features and benefits of that $100 per year aren't evident to me either.  Storage space only for junk?  Meh.  Private servers? You guys promised they'd come with time, but **we** were thinking months, not nearly a year and at additional cost.
---
Mate again, those are NOT private servers. What Beth is making you pay for are private INSTANCES. Something many games offer for free.. but yeah you really gave it to us all by spending YOUR money on an subscription that you don't actually like. I feel so humiliated by you now.
---
I buy things from public servers its where most my good guns come from but private servers are good to get stock to sell at your camp
---
I will say, if it's a private session and not a private server it's crazy to charge that sort of money for it.
---
‚ÄòJust leave Brittany alone‚Äô

why is it so hard to find a good berserkers rifle?
---
It‚Äôs different items.  A candy bowl (that looks like it can give out food to people who interact with it), and a couple fo decorations.
---
Lol yes. Codsworth and Nick Valentine are all I need. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I'm all for 2 for the game I want to play in my spare time. But I know that's not everyone's jam so what's needed is an actual Survival mode, with the food/drink item spawns severely nerfed. If your goal is a (relatively) realistic survival game, then why should food and potable water be so readily available? Crops shouldn't reliably produce food, water purifiers should break often and work slowly, and you should have to be under constant threat of having your camp raided for what food and water you do manage to scrape together.
---
Do you expect DLC to be free?  How then do you propose that they fund the creation of it?  Should employees work for free so that you can enjoy DLC for free?  Should the utility companies keep the lights on and water running at Bethesda for free because people want free DLC?  What's your plan here?
---
Wow! That happened on survival servers pretty much every nuke. Really sucked. It was so persistent that I would launch nukes just to get rid of a crappy server since they would always crash. I wonder if yours was a fluke or not. Please follow up if it happens again I'm actually pretty curious about it.
---
I believe if you go to sleep on the bed or play an instrument you‚Äôll stay active but try and move at least a little once every 15 minutes or when you see your screen getting dark
---
So you are not familiar with the feeling of running out of content in a game before? Literally all you would do in other FO games is restart and redo the entire game again and again.
---
Hunters long coat with sunglasses and militarycap. Or my full set of bos heavy combat armor with a bos officer underarmor and bos paint helmet.
---
\#5 by adding hardcore, open pvp lobbies with fully scaled mobs (level 100-500). Vats use being pve only similar to NW.
---
I think everything is riding on the wastelander update. If it rocks it will bring a lot of players back and hopefully a lot of interesting content will keep us playing for hours and hours. If it bombs and as expected from bethesda contains loads of bugs and glitches, then I can see it being the beginning of the end for 76. They really need to get this right from the start.
---
not looking forward to a nuked WS event.. no
---
I just want to play it and not worry about rads.. there are enough rads from mobs as it is...
---
I see your point because it's  a time advantage but I don't  agree so let's flip it around...say the item is a gun and I have enough time to play 16 hours a day and I get the gun weeks before you do because you can only play on the weekends did I... PLAY to win? GRIND to win?
---
Pay to win means to ME is being able to purchase said gun with a bigger clip and bullets that do more damage that I can't aquire by doing anything in the game
---
As a day one player I feel the same.
---
Not the future thats been gaming for years. Some people have avoided it. But being nickel and dimed is why DLC was invented in the first place than it got out of hand with loot boxes and subs.
---
Chill dude, Im annoyed for the same reason as you- I only have time to catch the 12 PM one until like late tonight, too- but this is a weeklong event with this damn thing popping every hour. Theres like a ton more chances to play it. You‚Äôll be fine.
---
Yeah, I'm with you. I don't have any problem with the hosted private server thing or the "free atoms." It's everything else. I never expected free private servers, but I did expect free quality of life adjustments. I've literally been waiting for the scrap box for a whole year and I'm not going to pay for it.
---
Why're you getting downvoted lmao
---
its fine and deserving in a case like this
---
The fuck anyone was happy to pay for that garbage. If you haven't noticed 90% of players just grinded atoms in game because of how shitty the options for atoms were. This is just a way for them to force people to actually pay cash for the atoms, and gives them that as a way to show "added value" to fallout 1st.
---
It isn't actually added value for you, it is added value for them and their atomic shop.
---
Technically It's pay to loose bro
---
Yes. I‚Äôm sure people who farm legendaries as their end game, like I do, noticed the improvement. I used to jam up my inventory with tons of 3-5 scrip garbage, and now it‚Äôs primarily 3 star stuff.
---
Total bullshit. They remove the only game mode for PvP players and replace it with this horse shit.
---
No. This isn't okay. They can't pull a 180 like this and piss everyone off. If you don't make it crystal clear this shit is wrong they'll keep doing it.
---
"Yes they deserved to die, and I hope they burn in hell!"
---
They are literally using cheatengine in NW which is the same program used in GTAO.
---
The game is fun but Bethesda are greedy bastards and they've made 76 as a full on fucking cash grab. I really hope those assholes are paying attention
---
When you create a game so bad that people come here just to talk about other games I think is a huge sign to sell your assets and quit the gaming industry. Let someone else create a real fallout. Bethesda has sucked for too long and the lies will leave the taint smell for years to come.
---
My bad, I'll update OP. I figured everyone knew what was missing still.
---
Nah, it's fine. I can't eat the rich IRL, but I certainly can here.
---
Maybe you should just find another game to enjoy...
---
The effects of radaway, diluted radaway, and radshield stack for a total of 600rr. (More than X-01)
---
They can start by not monetizing every community suggestion as Fallout 1st content or Atomic Shop crap and actually add our feedback to the game as content for ALL without any barrier, because what I want to see is this game grow both in player population, and playable content.
---
Only when they do that, will I consider it an apology.
---
Its downright naive to think that Big Companies with PR depeartments dont try to control narratives on reddit, astroturf, etc.
---
The witch showed up in the new bundle today. I feel cheated too! Who do we write?
---
I know I'm in the vast minority but I actually like this game more than the other fallouts. The ability to play with my friends is what makes it so great.
---
The loud minority.
---
Yes boss, you are absolutely right. I agree that the issue is with those who criticise the game, and not those who make these awful decisions time and time again, manipulating their core consumer base for just a bit more every time.
---
Brilliant argument. Basically 'this argument doesn't work because other people have taken it too far.'
---
Yep, I'm aware of that. The issue is that there are limited resources in any development team, especially one like 76 where there is always work to do. If you've ever worked in a software development team you'll understand that whatever your requirement guys gives you as 'priority' is what gets the focus. Yes you can do multiple things as once, but it's more common to be set onto a single use case at a time. Even if that wasn't the case, you can't argue the absolutely tone deaf nature of releasing a subscription service to a game after you've just delayed its biggest expansion. Hold off until Wastelanders at least. Though then I suppose people would say Wastelanders was delayed to develop this. I'm not saying they can win every battle. Just sick of them acting like they're owed when all they've done is take.
---
I don't have an issue with the server rentals, I have an issue with them bundling in features and QoL that everyone will want in a single tiered prohibitive costing package. If I'm not interested in the server, but I would happily pay for scrap, too bad. You ain't getting it without paying your $12 a month. So predatory on their part but it'll be defended because anyone with a genuine issue will be deflected like this, where someone says 'BUT LOOK AT WHAT THESE GUYS ARE SAYING, YOU DONT WANNA BE LIKE THEM DO YOU?'.
---
There's nothing wrong with liking the game, I liked my couple of weeks at launch, but for as 'accepting' as this sub likes to paint itself, it leaves no room for complaints or criticism unless you fall over yourself to preface it with "I love this, this this and this". Any critique deflection is similarly preface with "dont get me wrong, I think this is out of line BUT". As if people are so afraid of being hard line one way or the other that they need to specify. You and I can discuss this till hell freezes over, but the facts are that the second this hit the community management for Bethesda and 76 went dark. That in itself tells you this is exactly what they expected and set up for. And as usual 'le rational fo76' players will come out of the woodwork and say that everyone went too far in critiquing the game, that we should be happy with it's flaws and manipulate everyone into feeling sorry for the people who sold us this mess because someone said a bad word to them. 
---
Christ.
---
I agree a 100%. That does not mean however that i should just roll over and leave when one of my favorite franchises is being dumbed down and sold in pieces. It is easy to say just dont buy it, and of course it is true. However game companies know damn well they can get away with it, and if all use microtransactions you can either accept it or stop playing all togethes. So yeah, i think being vocal is pretty important.
---
I get that people are here for FO76, and that some do not want to compare this game to OW. However, this is the official sub for a Bethesda's latest game, which faces a lot of criticism on many different levels. And now a different game from a different developer made a game that is better in gameplay, has no microtransactions, no season pass or special edition, and that tackles a lot of the criticism Bethesda is facing. 
---
This is exactly the place to be vocal about it. To show Bethesda that there is real competition out there now, and they need to improve. 
---
Bethesda could not care less about one person not buying their game. One person discussing their shortcomings with other people on their official subreddit is something different entirely.
---
Yeah if you're not using a Bluetooth xbox controller it doesn't. It's a known issue with it's drivers though which is why I mentioned it.
---
I haven't played since the original oppressor. Also relies pretty heavily on glitches to unlock anything and it was still super grindy so I don't doubt it.
---
Cool, I see nothing irrational about liking a thing that someone designed to be likeable.
---
Same here.
---
Replaying the game while Making different choices and playing in a different way. This game has no such choices to make. It also clearly falls behind other MMOs in terms of endgame content. It cant offer the single player fallout experience and it fails to replace that with good MMO endgame.
---
Mine just did the same.
---
Random guy verifies random guy's post. Lol.
---
I say keep the price the same and give the scrap box to everyone. Make the tent a quest reward. I'm not salty about the price I'm salty about the scrap box.
---
By not allowing people to transfer characters between the private and normal servers? That's a pretty normal thing, and the fact that they let you guys have private **instances** in the first place in a survival game where you can freely gather resources without the normal competition and THEN you can go back to the normal servers is a bit overbalanced.
---
Thanks for the reminder.
---
lulz, no
---
Mojang is a lot larger than that, they literally host multiple conventions each year. That 70 you listed are probably only the devs working on java edition, you also have bedrock edition, mobile edition, the augmented reality minecraft world, etc.
---
Also, not all of bethesda is working on fo76, just a single branch is, their junior team of roughly 30 people in austin.
---
I think these are things anyone with critical thought could safely predict with a decent probability.
---
Yeah but I wanted the first one ever, like I did for Fasnacht.
---
lmao, ya
---
Shark cards were around from day one and the best vehicle, the rhino tank, took forever to unlock through the side jobs because the pay out was only a few thousand each, not a few hundred thousand like the heists.
---
Now you're getting it.
---
Lol. It's the thing that makes the most sense.
---
It's like you think life should be fair or something
---
The biggest cost while facing the queen is ammo, since you can only hold so much, but pay some money and now you can have infinite ammo storage at your camp. You can also throw down your tent you bought which is quite handy when fighting the queen.
---
It‚Äôs only just begun.
---
I never said F76 wasn't also P2W.
---
hahaha whats wrong with my brain, i read that autism armor
---
*The vocal minority on reddit
---
There are quite a lot of bugs whose anniversary we can be celebrating. Hell, for some of them it may as well be a birthday party because they evolved so much from what they originally used to be. On December 18, I will be celebrating the birthday of my quad tesla rifle that still causes the damage bug and still spawns bugged ash piles
---
Don't know. Game crashed 3 minutes into it.
---
Yes, the third light up jack-o-lantern is free right now.
---
Don't make the mistake of buying anything from this company.
---
because bethesda is a garbage company with garbage morals and they see no issues with gouging, fleecing and otherwise nickel and diming their loyal customers to enhance their greed.
---
You know you can suck Todd's dick quietly, right?
---
Honest question, based on your posts you don't seem to like this game or any of the stuff Bethesda has been doing. So why are you still playing it?
---
I was more pointing out that going by this subs definition of p2w GTAO isn't. I just found it ironic and funny more than anything else.
---
Clearly you have only read my last few days' posts.
---
Bffr handmade and be lever
---
Finished ours
---
You played the game. With all due respect, it doesn't matter what it means "to you". There is a set definition for Pay to Win, and that's not it.
---
Might convince a friend to nuke the event in his private server to see if it is even worth nuking.
---
Yeah, no. Bad predictive ability right there.
---
Well it makes sense to use the 76 player base as Guinea pigs of a sort. I think to assume it would be for fallout doesn't necessarily mean anything.
---
 Oh I like the sub. Its cost is very little and it has so many benefits. ;)
---
 I'm retired and at one time wrote backend code for web servers. I understand AWS rather well. All you get for your private server anywhere is an instance of some kind. You would not want to pay for an actual whole machine. 
---
 Having a look around and an instance is $25 a month or so. An actual server is anywhere from $50 to $150 a month.
---
No refunds.
---
BASED
---
In the past you always had enough games that were not overmonetized or P2W and DLCs or expansions are a thing since a looong time. They became more usual in the last decade but most of them also offer a lot of content.
---
But when things like subscriptions become a thing people will have to choose between only a few games and stick to them because they are tied to their sub... People that like variety when gaming will have a hard time.
---
Two shot is pretty bad for a shotgun, in most circumstances. It‚Äôll annihilate your accuracy. A double barrel actually starts at 0 before mods and perks improve it. It‚Äôs a melee weapon.
---
Anti armor, instigating, vampire, furious, junkie or bloodied shotguns don‚Äôt take an accuracy nerf. I‚Äôm building for vanguard armor, so I‚Äôm opting for an instigating and a vampire shotgun, with a lever gun as backup if I need to shoot at long range.
---
The guy from Bojack Horseman?
---
Just crashed xD
---
I gotchu fam
---
Haha, don't worry about triggering PvP; that's really a 1 to million chance... Also as a PA user you have quite potent counter against those melee griefers (if there are even any) - jetpack.
---
I'm not going to stalk your profile I just remembered the SN popping up a lot recently. Hence my question.
---
Yes you played the game to win, that is how games work. When you can bypass the playing part and still win by throwing money at it, that is PAY 2 win.
---
There is a lot of double standard and hypocrisy for sure.
---
&gt;Plus idk what you were smoking thinking that you were gonna host servers on a multi platform game and that they were going to be free. 
---
M ay I point you to minecraft bedrock? I can actually host my own server, for free, and not only is it multi platform, but PC players can play with Xbox players (not sure about switch/ps4 players though).
---
ü•Å‚ò†üê¥
---
Because it's not an online DRM. You can't crack it. The game actually gets data from servers, and onky Bethesda knows how it works. So you can't crack it.
---
Ive launched about 20-30 nukes on my servers.. Ive had 2 crash it so far.
---
You haters need to relies it is a game where you are not really in competition with anyone besides the game and if people want to spend a little of there own money to make the game more fun for them that's there right living in a free country 
---
What ever they said in the beginning things change over time they are in business to make money not to give you free entertainment for life. So if you hate it that bad move on and stop raining on everyone else's day. This was my first and probably last post.
---
Can't find the site I found that, but in linkedin here it is:
---

https://www.linkedin.com/company/mojang-ab
---
Darn
---
No he's asexual why would you do that to him? He doesn't want anything sucked by anyone.
---
I hopped on real quick to play it and it was fun.
---
"  Morale of the story- "
---
low I guess?
---
Chants no more todd
---
Pets aren't pay to win! You can't use your pet to one shot the queen. Quit complaining, Bethesda is incapable of doing anything wrong
---
Endless sentry bot weapon firing sound bug is fun
---
Again if we don‚Äôt have whales we don‚Äôt have a game all I can say. If they want to spend the money on it great.
---
Worked Out pretty good. Everything is Well explained. The end Part can get a little tough. Game Crashed at the end. I'll see what i got when i'm Back online
---
Yup, and of course this sub downvotes anyone who dares point it out. LOL
---
They think downvotes makes the truth go away, when in reality it just shows how invested in the lies they tell themselves to excuse the actions bethesda has taken with this game.
---
Seriously.  At this point give me an offline mode, unlimited storage space, full access to all skills not to be limited to level 50, the ability to build anywhere and bigger, and NPC's with interactions and story......and I'll walk away satisfied.
---
Apologies for the poor sentence structure.
---
Is Whitespring the new event location?
---
I put my controller on its face and run into a corner
---
current in game players \~6.7k, and thats the highest ive seen in a year...usually \~4k.  So it seems more ppl r playing.
---
I'll pass. This is the first Fallout game that I can live in and share living space with my friends. I'll keep playing it warts and all.
---
Lmao very low, thank you for pointing out typo
---
&gt;Yes boss, you are absolutely right. I agree that the issue is with those who criticise the game, and not those who make these awful decisions time and time again, manipulating their core consumer base for just a bit more every time.
---
Manipulating? Is your head so far up your own rear end that you can't fathom the idea that people might not agree with you and that they have to be manipulated?
---
I think they know what they're gonna charge you for next now
---
That's kind of a let down since mama dolces coulda been a very interesting foundation to a quest to get the weapon or plans for it
---
Nope. It‚Äôs a failure of a game and hardly anyone plays it. I‚Äôm just pissed because it‚Äôs another fucking subscription.
---
It sucks. For me at least. 
---
Since everything is high-level as fuck in the Whitesprings, Ghouls are relentless and one of the objectives is to piss off the robots, which makes them perma-hostile to you for the remainder of the servers. Assaultrons are absolutely the worst. They kept specifically targetting me out of the 7 other people present and I kept dying in 2 hits, respawn, then immediately get spawnkilled by the Assaultron *again* and *again*
---
Not fun at all. I couldn't do *anything* without some high-level monster ripping me in half every 2 seconds
---
Which after 2 play thoughts you have done all non main quest lines. And after 4 play thoughts you have done literally everything.
---
Was a lot of fun IMO. Mild lag and no crashing on my end. There were at least 15 people there so I expected lag
---
&gt; Funny enough it turns out it is also a buggy broken mess because of course it is.
---
It actually isn't anything like you think it is. The stash issue only effected a handful of people, and the tent works fine, and the private server does what it says.
---
I can actually speak on this because I bought (And canceled) the first month.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Game_Studios_Austin
---
Mojang AB is just their swedish branch.
---
I went in a mr fuzzy outfit and he still said he loved my costume keep it on so that works too
---
lol. Account has over 1,000 comments and they're all in FO76 related subs. 
---
interesting.
---
\+1 for crashed after dying during last fight.  no event rewards for me :-(
---
Well...I didn't crash but I got the bug where I can't press the respawn button....so same as crashing
---
I don't think Bethesda is trying to make people like this game anymore...
---
How do you see current player totals?
---
While I would like that, the PR guys don't really have the authority to do that, not to mention they need to do something pretty big to compensate people who already bought it. Unfortunately it seems a bit unrealistic, I think best case is it gets a price drop
---
bathesda is full of greedy cunts
---
OP didn't say it the sub was "run or moderated by Bethesda", he said their PR is spamming positive posts and using a system BUILT INTO Reddit to manipulate votes on posts criticizing the game, something that happens all the time.
---
I died as the boss was being killed and can't respawn...
---
Best seasonal event so far imo. Lots of shooting
---
I find being impartial is the best way but thank you
---
Im gna disagree 4 was i like outer worlds though but i cant play fps for too long if it was 3rd person id probly be playin right now
---
Everyone complaining has every right to complain. If you're having fun, then good for you. But don't pretend like the gripes people have aren't legitimate. Bethesda has straight up lied and twisted their worda about multiple factors of this game.
---
Work and school are interfering with my ability to enjoy the Halloween week event in f76 üò≠
---
Upon reflection I agree, my original point was they have nothing to do with the running of the sub
---
https://youtu.be/0wG_h3U568w
---
If there is any afk timer that should be removed. Private servers are your server. You should be able to stay  there all day if you trust your defenses to defend you and jump on to not starve.
---
From what I've read so far, it seems to be the responsable for Minecraft's development.
---
https://br.linkedin.com/company/minecraft
---
Same man. But i got the rewards. Look through your inventory.
---
I saw it change from red to white the entire time, may have something to do with the quest objectives changing zones?
---
But I dont agree with the "set" definition "set" by whoever
---
Is the new event at Whitespring?
---
Why is it interesting?
---
Nothing wrong with an opinion that differs from yours. Sorry.   Not everyone is a sheep.
---
I know, I've said roughly 5 times now my comment was bad and wrongly put forward but I'm keeping it here for posterity sake
---
Yuppppppp. Was not expecting that. Had to be revived a few times and returned the favor a few times. All moderately high level players too.
---
No but it might make me feel better
---
Just go into photo mode and rubber band the controller
---
Is it a Two Shot shotgun? The spread on those things are ridiculous.
---
I would think everyone who realises the game is trash has left already
---
Which rewards did you get?
---
Bethesda probably could make a completely local mode for 76, or even a solo offline mode that is just the player, but they won't because like I said in another thread, I think their longterm plan is to create an ecosystem where they're in charge of everything and it's all behind paywalls.
---
Modding features? Behind paywalls, and most likely done in the Creation Club style where they curate what's acceptable or not, so you probably won't even see the variety of previous 3D Fallout games.
---
"Private" worlds? Behind a paywall, and probably not even technically private.
---
I don't know what's sadder, that the modding potential for 76 will probably be DOA at this rate (I mean it is already dead basically), or that Bethesda still is still completely uninterested in coding **in fucking TEXT CHAT**. We got a 'premium service' added before a damn integral PC-centric communication feature was added.
---
I got a alien Jack o lantern lol
---
Yes I wish there was a 3rd person view in outer world's also
---
Does it really take 10 minutes on PS4? I played like 5 games last night on Xbox and each one only took like 5-6 minutes from the main menu to playing. Usually 1-2 minutes to get into lobby, 1-2 minutes of lobby waiting, 1-2 minutes to get into game. And it's pretty much been like that since the beta launched.
---
There are candy dishes around the main entrance that you can trick or treat out of. It‚Äôs around the big pyre
---
We are biding our time, comrade. You just wait.
---
Everything that we tolerate now will be worse come fo5, starfield, and ES6. They are testing the waters with a spin off game to see how much shit they can shovel into the big games.
---
Probably
---
It is a subsidiary of xbox game studios, just like bethesda austin is a subsidiary of bethesda softworks. So you are comparing a single branch with an entire company. If you compare apples to apples mojang ab is far larger than bethesda austin.
---
You know the game will die sooner if that happens right?
---
Nothing new or unique. Witches hat and some other garbage.
---
Mine lagged for a bit and froze and then crashed
---
it's gonna be full of bugs as usual cause bathesda is nothing but a bunch of incompetent greedy asshole cunts at this point. they make ea look like a good company.  china &gt; bathesda
---
Holy shit Minecraft is immense...TIL.
---
I didn't get any. I also don't really know what the rewards are but there is nothing new in my inventory :/
---
Me as well... I hope that at least we got the rewards.
---
Nice! Can play until 7:30 and the anticipation is killing me
---
"because I'm afraid of what kind of bugs could happen"  
---
Man, with a phobia like that I'd stay away from any Bethesda game, like, ever.
---
I got the Pumpkin Short Suit :-)
---
I've seen positive posts be downvoted into oblivion because, right now, being angry at the game is "in". And people have a right to be angry, but for those who still enjoy the game I'm seeing people use the downvote as a way to silence them and upvote the negative posts. It's kind of frustrating,
---
Plus it seems like this sub has had a massive influx of people after the announcement of Fallout 1st and I feel like they're just here to ride the drama train.
---
Yeah it's totally unrealistic, but that's just about all they could say to actually make people happy.
---
I almost feel bad for the PR folks at Bethesda. They probably have little to no say regarding features and their pricings, yet they have to do the impossible of marketing a steaming pile of shit as a great deal.
---
people who need a revive to get their Standard backpack should take note.. lol
---
Hopefully, someone did say that it was just a barrel and stock mod for the handmade and whilst it might be it's own weapon like how the fixer is it's own weapon but in reality is just a heavily modded combat rifle, it could just be a skin. Either way this along with the pint sized slasher with the kitchen knife combat knife skin will be nice additions from 3 imo
---
Maybe.. it's frustrating because if it's white it doesn't count towards xp. And I've had this problem before this event with attacking whitesprings and they go from red to white or stay white while attacking me
---
It is the most played game on the planet surpassing fortenite again recently. It has sold more games than any other game on the planet.
---
Bloody melee with no stealth... yeah thank god I could be saved!
---
2019 reviews... more people will post negative comments than positive ones in any type of review. Those happy with it are playing and usually don‚Äôt care about those who don‚Äôt. 
---
They also aren‚Äôt fans of posting anything positive since if they do they get targeted instantly by those holding different opinions... 0.00% tolerance...
---
Fake or new accounts...
---
People that don‚Äôt actually play the game...
---
Those that claim they uninstalled it...
---
YouTubers literally trying to make money on clicks and views...
---
Meanwhile... I see a ton of scrap boxes in the wasteland... hmmm... kinda says the opposite of what they say... 
---
Bottom line it‚Äôs a game and much like ESO as I pointed out 200+ days ago would have a similar EDO plus type deal... 
---
Here:
---
A few comments above you said it's idiotic so yeah.. keep trying to trigger me if that's your goal.
---
I don't think that I will actually get an real answer from you so it's time to move on from this conversation.
---
EDIT: If you really would have knowledge of the topic you would knew what I meant by private instances. What we got is just a private room/match whatever and not a persistant server that people would have wanted and even I would be willing to pay for.
---
it makes sense to target people that have more resources, duh, this is the fallout universe. bullets for food or bullets for food.
---
Hmm. That sucks. Well we'll have a Lot of Chances till 5th november
---
Being pissed off is how we show bethesda that we don't want them to keep making is pay more to get the full game. Doing nothing is just going yo let them continue and prevents them from making a good game, and although I do agree the game can be quite entertaining I feel that is only becuase my friends and I make are own fun. That to me is an indication that my money has not been well spent and it is disappointing.
---
I just got the Pumpkin Short Suit first try :-)
---
It's ‚Ç¨20 per month or ‚Ç¨120 in Europe, about $22 or $133 per year. Just to put in perspective:
---
You can:Buy Xbox Game Pass (also for PC) for ‚Ç¨4 per month: About a hundred games, including The Outer WorldBuy Origin Access or Premier for ‚Ç¨4/‚Ç¨15 per month. More than a hundred of gamesBuy PlayStation Plus for ‚Ç¨9 per month, 2 games per month.Buy Uplay+:  ‚Ç¨15 per month, also loads of games.Buy Humble Montly Bundle for $12, 6 games you get to keep forever.
---
In what fucking world do these rat bastards live that they can price it so high like this? Perhaps $1 per month would have been acceptable, but not this.
---
Yeah, with a Legacy Gatling Plasma, you just die.
---
It's even worse when they add something that already exists in 76 to the Atomic Shop.  Bungalow anyone?
---
So lucky!!
---
Somehow it makes bethesda looks even worse.
---
This goes both ways though because I wasn't speaking out against it and I went from checking this sub every few hours to checking once a day. I was coming here to see what other people were doing in the game and see news about what was coming to it. I don't mind some bitching about stuff people aren't happy with but when most of the sub is people bitching and insulting the people who bought the stuff they disagree with... well it reduces my incentive to come here pretty drastically. Instead of checking out this sub after I do my daily scrip and caps runs now I play outer worlds after I log off 76.
---
The ghouls caught me off guard, and then the mass amount of assualtrons at the end was a rollercoaster but definitely fun as hell
---
How did you get the floor to break away i tried somthing similar floor never broke
---
Yes! Looks like I did get some stuff...I see a Plan: Vault Tec Jack O lantern.  Thanks for the tip.
---
Overall I loved this event.....just blowing sh\*t up
---
If it is God's will
---
I tried those because I thought maybe those were it, but I didn‚Äôt have the option to interact with them :(
---
Nooooo how did I get so unlucky??
---
It's great! 3 + rewards like plans and costumes
---
Most definitely! This would easy in this event
---
Stimpak diffusers will help everyone on team.. can‚Äôt wait!
---
If you don't think walling off features people have been asking for since launch behind a paywall is manipulative, or that it's not manipulative when Bethesda start saying we as a community have been asking for more functional items on the atom shop, just so they can start rolling out the next layer of trash that goes against their cosmetic only statement and scrape more meat off the bones of this games most dedicated, then I don't really have anything else I can say to you. You're like a North Korean the way you just accept all this and blame anyone else but Bethesda for the issues Bethesda's facing. Absolutely brainwashed into thinking this is about you in any way. I'm really sorry they've got you attacking people over this game.
---
&gt;bolstered by people that don't play the game
---
Not on this sub, but among my own group of friends I've seen tons of anti-76 posts and comments being made by people who I know don't even play the game. They're just riding on the anger of other people and feel the need to chime in.
---
Especially when you realize the game is nearly 10 years old and was made by a single person in his dining room.
---
Legendary weapons that give 250 damage resistance while reloading breaks the first prefix of the legendary effects, unless you crouch while reloading. So it will lose Anti-Armor, Vampire's, Two-Shot etc. until you swap weapons back and forth
---
Have another gold. You've said it better than I ever could.
---
This sub has lost its mind.
---
What does it look like? Just an orange suit?
---
Down with Bethesda, long live obsidian.
---
Obsidian Gu Brath!
---
Not just any fanboy, a toxic fanboy.
---
Also side note! Low levels need to show up with high levels and do their best to do the other side objectives while allowing higher levels to handle dps
---
&gt;The servers aren't smooth? I thought that was part of the charm of Bethesda.
---
Some bugs in Bethesda's previous games may have resulted in some memorable hilarious moments, but there is nothing funny about an internet server that doesn't work...
---
hahahahahha how about not pre order games and not give them money for shitty games? ive boycotted every pre order and ea. bethesda actiblizzard etc for years not giving them a cent before the game is playable and sometimes guess what i just dont buy it cause its a dumpster fire
---
Got a plan for the reaper cutout.
---
Actually, I did that because I thought you were saying that I was thinking F76s version was OK or something, lol. Got rid of it now.
---
I crashed in the first minute but was lucky enough to get back in before it was over.
---
"it makes sense. "  
---
It what?
---
I'm aware of at least two different companies we use were I work for this very thing. They work it all. Reddit, Youtube, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook...
---
When we see something negative starting we will make sure our internal team know so they can in front of it and provide direction to the "shill" teams. Sometimes they post under our company accounts and other times its using their accounts. 
---
Its a cheap way for companies to maintain they brand. Shilling sucks but its real.
---
I‚Äôm sorry!! I wish you the best luck at 2üòÅ
---
Awesome! I got the half empty Pumpkin rack. Excited to See how it Looks! Yeah i Like the Event too! Not quite like Fasnacht, but its definitly fun!
---
Nice! I want that one
---
Honestly? Too bad, lol. You don't just get to change definitions because you don't like them.
---
That was my original thought, but then I thought it‚Äôs not actually your server you‚Äôre only using it, after you leave, that will be open to other players. I left mine on for about 2 hours and come back to ‚ÄúDisconnect‚Äù but couldn‚Äôt tell if it was because of being AFK or not.
---
Got Halloween Skull and vault-tec pumpkin plan, friend got the whitespring jumpsuit
---
Basically Fasnacht 2.0
---
Yup with little pumpkin faces all over &amp; I got the short version so it‚Äôs cutoff above the elbows &amp; above the knees üëåüèº
---
The squished witch deco that was highlighted prominently in the last bundle but not included.  I was so mad at that.
---
Nuclear Winter is more fun than Fortnite, Blackout, and Apex IMO
---
I crashed loading in but got back in time
---
I've gotten my money's worth, I've played hundreds of hours with very little bugs so personally I cant complain. The best way to show Bethesda is to vote with your wallet. I have not and will not buy FO1st, but many people are. Even before Bethesda added anything that could be seen as pay to win, the community was selling in game stuff on Ebay, making it pay to win. I dont blame Bethesda for joining in what their own community started. It's just stuff to keep in mind next time Bethesda releases a game. Personally I'm gonna wait for reviews like all games nowadays before I buy :)
---
Thats quite a feat...well, thanks for the talk and insight pal!
---
I was carrying 30k plus ammo on me before the subscription, I never run out. Only difference you can farm lead and steel less often but longer in one go, yes a lot of things is easier in regards of resources management but it never stopped anyone from beating the game.
---
Mr Handys are friends, not tools
---
Yeah, but I‚Äôm interested to see if I could just rest in the bed for 3 hours
---
I think the astonished reward is different, the vault Tec one I got didn‚Äôt have a light.
---
Well darn. Would make it more worth doing.
---
Chaos. Loved it.
---
It seems like a lot to be spending daily on a single meal, at least, especially seeing as my lunch is about equivalent to 2 USD. Though I myself am by no means poor, given that the average American service industry worker (70% of the US population and thus about the average FO76 player) makes about 30k per year, those lunches would be about a 5th their weekly income.
---
I'm still disappointed that we didn't get legendary drills and saryngers with the Purveyor
---
I think why they get a bit more of a free pass is because the single player aspect in both games are amazing. And despite my concerns after the success of gtao rdr2 single player for me was incredible and it didn't look like they dropped focus on that in preference to online. Quite the opposite in red dead case.
---
Silence means ‚Äúnothing to see here, move along‚Äù Everything working as intended.
---
Which one it is ? What does it do ?
---
Oh no! An enemy spawned half burried in the floor. Let me just delete the game.
---
Does the event happen every hour
---
Ive seen more people playing since fallout 1st was released despite what this sub would have people believe, and almost all of them were in their own private worlds
---
I was looking at the odds and I was surprised I got the grim reaper plan on my first try a few minutes ago. I was wearing bloodied chef hat and outfit, if it matters, which it probably doesn‚Äôt.
---
Somehow I didn't crash and got the grim reaper cutout.
---
ROTFLMFAO
---
Where can I find a pumpkin ? I got the same reward
---
Good. Have you spat on a Fallout 1st member today? If not, do your job and shame those who are rewarding Bethesda for doing their part to kill video games.
---
Agree. I really tried enjoying gtao but after seeing the prices for everything and everyone flying about destroying me with flying cars I quickly passed.
---
Fireman helmet, mobster pumpkin plan. Hilarious chaos.
---
preaching to the converted here.I  may have a quite cynical veiwpoint but,take nothing at face value, good or bad - prove it. Is it fact, or is it someones version of the facts. You are entitled to your own opinion, but you are NOT entitled to your own facts. In general, we have no idea who we are actually talking to online nor their true motives. 'any publicity, is good publicity', your post doesn't come as shock/horrer, more like   YYYUUUUUPP.
---
cheers
---
yongslant is busting a nut every time any 76 news comes out, what a pathetic little worm he is.
---
all of the above and buy 45/5.56 ammo to avoid caps cap
---
Strange.  Once it promoted you to trick or treat they should have worked. They did for me anyway
---
This is sort of along the lines of what I was thinking about this last night, I already hate managing the stash as it is, and I can recall the hours of time I spent with my inventory in Fallout 4; so I can't imagine adding more stash space is going to make this 'more fun'. Especially, with having two stashes to manage! Add to that how desolate the world already is, splitting the playerbase among this service only increases how empty it already is.
---
Exactly Drills/Chainsaws/AlienBlasters should all have been included in the legendary rolls by now
---
NP thanks!  
---
I wonder when the combat armour halloween skin is going to be released - must be tied to the event?
---
Because people aren‚Äôt shelling out hundreds of dollars for shark cards like they do in GTA.
---
" And inventory management skills aren't a bad thing to have. Makes you really focus on how your character is going to play "    
---
I'd love to empty the junk from my stash so I can store ammo, chems, food, and aid in my stash to I can literally drop bandolier, good with batteries, and any other weight reduction perk possible to do even more damage. So due to the fact I have to use inventory management skills if I miss out on even 1 perk point I can put into something else cause I can store my 5k ammo in my stash rather than carry it, thats a pay to win in my book
---
Every hour on the hour
---
I pretty sure only a handful of people  bought this service so it is not saying much when they say it affects only handful of people. Also this "private" session doesn't have privacy settings or any admin tools or mods and it only holds 8 people. That is such a good value for a premium service. While Outerworlds can be played on the xbox game pass for less than that.
---
Oh wow that‚Äôs a great drop!
---
Survey says!‚Ä¶
---
GTAs online was an added feature to a finished game. Fallouts online is the game. 
---
I paid full price for what I thought would be the full experience as I was under the impression the only additional purchases would be cosmetic but I was mistaken. 
---
I actually enjoyed the game but I still won‚Äôt be buying their next game opening day..
---
At top of this sub.
---
At the side of the cottages during the 2nd section there were little stands to stand on and interact with the wall!
---
You can only break a roof, the floor piece is invincible
---
Are you wearing a costume?
---
Let‚Äôs just hope it‚Äôs really fixed and doesn‚Äôt happen again. I‚Äôm still not completely emptying my stash of junk, just in case.
---
Yes full skeleton costume
---
I had fun 2, to bad it's only here for about a week
---
Legendary  Syringers would be fun, but i feel like it needs more effective mods.
---
I own my own flooring business here in the States. I am a sole proprietor with no employees.
---
I definitely make a lot more than what you said the average person makes here. 
---
 $2 for a lunch would be amazing to me.   If I brought my own lunch to work each day it would definitely save me a lot of money but I'm usually too exhausted to bother with that.
---
Booo. Okay thanks for heads up.
---
I got the pumpkin shelf plan. Learned it. And it's no where to be found in my build menu.
---
Ayyy, I'm not the only one that thinks this!
---
Yeah I didn‚Äôt even know I was gonna be able to get a jumpsuit from the event!
---
This sub is tough because it‚Äôs a clusterfuck of emotions, trolls, fake accounts, real accounts, you name it but the challenge is discrediting someone else‚Äôs post / comments without any facts in that moment... it just fuels the cyclic fire of arguments
---
Oh I thought you meant people currently playing. With the current 1st scandal I don't think that's a good metric to guess playerbase, a lot of those people are angry lurkers or people out to troll the latest scandal.
---
Get rid of fallout first, give everyone who was dumb enough to pay for it a refund, make the fixes they call features available without having to pay extra, and quit feeding us bullshit at every turn.
---
Oh whew! Life gets pretty boring when you can't launch nukes. Still sucks when it happens though haha
---
you need a life
---
Game crashed due to all the explosions, got into another server and only one person was doing the event causing us to fail, great fun.
---
Ok thanks
---
First of all, we were promised free DLC. We all paid more than enough money for a profile in this game. If Bethesda didn't manage the income they get properly, we shouldn't be forced to pay it. No one wants games with hidden fees.anyway! 
---
Read this post

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/do0fo7/psa_no_one_is_envious_of_those_with_fallout_1st/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
Guy does an excellent job of explaining why this is making people upset. I suggest you check it out ^^ sorry for bad formatting.
---
I have no idea why they chose whitespring as the area for this event. It is the location with the highest chance of a game crash in any game I've ever played. 
---
I'll give it a go after work this evening but I'm fairly certain my results will be similar to yours.
---
Thanks to all of you.Its solved
---
I think it was pretty decent. The event updated the objectives relatively quickly so I knew what was needing to be done when. The the fights got a bit hectic because WS already has a lot of spawns of potential enemies which add to the craziness. Event moves around to discourage afking alt farming of the event like what happened with Fasnacht and Meat Week.  Final boss is a little more durable than the low level sloth since it is a sentry bot so people were able to safely get their tags in.  
---
Issues I can see with this event:  
---
\- 80% of the rewards are carved pumpkins  
---
\- High level mobs give low levels a rough time   
---
\- You end the event aggroing WS robots  
---
\- stability dipped a lot because of all the bonfire effects, cars blowing up people graffiting walls, mobs spawning and dying, just in general a lot of moving parts
---
Maybe you're right. It was after 1am when I was typing that so my brain was half asleep.  Even though I got the Fissure site correct, just not the quest lol.
---
The coffin backpack is the real MVP of today's additions.
---
As someone who is only level 30, thank you
---
Yeah, it just makes me sad to see this route bethesda is going with this game when they could have copied minecraft and been immensely successful. 
---
If they would have opened private moddable servers able to be ran on your own hardware like minecraft while offering to rent servers out that they would run and curate for you, they could have made everyone happy. Instead they have bungled this and made it look like nothing but a money hungry move.
---
Like I don't get this whole "if you have an issue with fallout 1st you hate the game", when that isn't even close to the truth. I love the game, I wanted it to be good. When I heard it would be like an online fallout 4 I was hyped because I know what mods could do with the engine. When they said they would support private servers and mods, I thought, holy shit, this is going to be the next minecraft, because that is literally what made minecraft so popular to this day, there are entire industries built around making and curating modpacks for minecraft, look up feed the beast, and tehcnic. 
---
Instead? We get this great game being crippled by bethesda trying to out EA EA. Intentionally adding unfun mechanics to the game that they then try to sell back to you, or now holding private servers and mods hostage behind a damn subscription.
---
It is just depressing, knowing what this game could be, but knowing it never had a chance due to greed.
---
Floor decor mate!
---
Lol, you make a lot of hopeful assumptions about the content they'll provide.
---
sssssh were working on Mods for private servers
---
brb k?
---
Following this.
---
That seems like a really poor location choice on Bethesda's part. It's probably the most common nuke location.
---
Yes. I‚Äôve been swapping stuff between characters on private servers. Just me and no one else.
---
They do, I was banned yesterday for calling someone a BSer.
---
Well elders scrolls and the fallout games had something called saves and console commands. Also a great modding community that does a better job of fixing and creating content for said games.
---
Odds aren't bad for that...1/10. So you got lucky on your first go. No, your special stats, outfits, etc have nothing to do with the rewards you get. There are no conditions checks other than that you're wearing a costume for the last group of rewards and that you completed the event and all objectives.
---
Wow someone's scared he won't get his Astro turfing money
---
I specifically joined Reddit to buy/sell items for this game. So 99% of my posts are related to 76. Guess I'm a bot too. Lol
---
Thank God you're here to stop it!!!!
---
Where did you find it in your camp building menus? I looked in floor decor which is where my astonished and evil ones are, but didn‚Äôt see it
---
Love!!
---
Around what level would you call yourself OP in such a FO4 melee build? Because of the perk system eventually any build becomes OP was my thought. Although I only had one FO4 playthrough so far. It did last for +1400h though.
---
I've only heard of fast travel, but never experienced it.
---
If you remove any part of Excavator, you lose the extra 100 carry bonus the suit provides.   (You wil still retain the extra 100 from both calibrated shocks.)
---
I have motion assist servos, optimized bracers, and calibrated shocks (on both legs) on my Excavator, X01 and T51.  In that configuration, Excavator allows me up to about 1750 before I have to drop something or crawl.  X01 and T51 allow up to 1421.
---
Excavator @200% repair isn't bad.  I survived several SBQ's in it.
---
Perwise, bear arms, bandolier, packrat, actiongirl, and dromedary help.
---
I have a couple pieces of weight reduction regular armor and a small backpack - interestingly, I actually weigh less out of armor than in it, but still above the FT cutoff.
---
Ok man. You were mistaken about no one buying steel and I offerd information showing that wasn't totally true, no need to double down and be a jerk face
---
Sweet thanks
---
I thought the event was a lot of fun, but ow, my framerate... Whitesprings isn't that great even on the best days, but when all manner of explosions are going off, you can imagine...
---
Ya, they are terribly inaccurate in VATS, even when it appears the bullets have "connected". Manual aiming is the way to go.
---
Well, no. I'm almost always right. So, there's that.
---
Aaaaah. That make sense actually.
---
&gt;Edit: Wierr replied then deleted comment asking why interesting
---
I didn't delete anything... it's still there...
---
Couldn‚Äôt play it yet because Maxxsouth internet went out at my place...again. Glad they sent a repair guy out without me calling but geez. Their service has been junk since summer. I hope everyone had fun.
---
Chainsaw the coolest weapon in fallout 76.
---
Np :)
---
Yes, I‚Äôve seen this interview 
---
I am not saying Bethesda is an Angel and ideal corporate citizen.  I am pointing out that that much of the negativity is overhyped.  In some cases there are hate posts by people who don‚Äôt play FO76 or don‚Äôt play enough to understand game mechanics fully.
---
Apparently, Peter Hine‚Äôs ‚Äúline‚Äù is located differently from yours... and, quite likely, his line moves according to circumstances.
---
You are correct that some of the items offered are not purely cosmetic.  But they are not ‚Äúpay to win‚Äù.  I would say they are ‚Äúpay for convenience‚Äù.
---
Funny thing is you can already have most of those things if you actually played the game or at least read the wiki, but no, you rather bitch on Reddit blaming Pay2Win for your own shortcomings.  Just like any other salty noob.
---
I waited till the event went live and I still only got the 1st challenge
---
Why are they charging you so much? I only pay $14 a month.  Less if I felt like buying the whole year.
---
more stability would definitley be preferred though. I get about an hour to play in the morning. Even squeezing through the boxes, If my first launch is a bust in that hour, Im not gonna try again.
---
I hope it does. The sooner this game dies the sooner we can get around to making our own servers and building the game FO76 could have been. Whether it takes a decade or two, I'm probably never touching this game again anyway until I can run my own server and mod in my own content.
---
Wonder who is downvoting without discussing? ‚òπÔ∏è
---
When defending Thunder Mountain Power Plant I have had legendary enemies spawn. Hemlock Holes as well but not as frequently.
---
Haven‚Äôt got a 3* yet. Only 1-2.
---
Who the fuck has been praising Tod? Like for real? F76 has been nothing more than an absolute horrendous failure. It failed so much that F76 bundles with a console was 50% cheaper than the same console without F76! 
---
That‚Äôs how fucked up this is! Now who in their right mind would praise the incompetent moron who made that possible? Shills, and no one else.
---
Bethesda is really having a Fallout 4
---
That might be Nuclear Winter only. I got some of the weapon skins already from NW
---
Internet connections don't just magically get faster to compensate. They are what they are, and your ability to connect to communicate the volume of information needed within a certain amount of time has a huge impact on stream performance.
---
This man gets it.
---
Sure it was pal.
---
It was laggy
---
Ill buy the cryo for 7 k!
---
It was a 3 star on my server
---
another thread here says you get to blow up cars....
---
and theres high level ghoul and robots.
---
So I guess I'll have PA less a helmet so I can at least wear a mask.
---
The sub isn't required to play
---
I got a Anti Armor Faster Fire Rate Faster Reload Flamer during the purveyor sale..
---
If you could craft chem bullets to put in them that would be cool.
---
Lol.
---
Does anyone know what constitutes a "costume"? I have what I'm gonna wear but not sure if it will count. Anywhere I can read up on that?
---
Crashy &amp; Spyro trilogy, along with a Call of Duty title isn't 'dubious' quality. Sure, the Humble Monthly can be hit or miss for you, depending on what you actually like but I merely suggested that once can get much better, functional games for a fraction of the subscription cost of Fallout First.
---
Game Pass is what it is, you can either like the games on offer or not. Either way, objectively a way better value proposition than Fallout First.
---
Because Fallout First does not even work properly. People losing their items in the box and also servers that already are looted or have dead NPC's in them. They're literally making you pay for abandoned/empty servers. There is no real upkeep for them as people are abandoning the game en masse and already rented and paid for Amazon servers remain empty. This is a smart but scummy way to repurpose abandoned servers by making people pay extra for them.
---
Ahh I just realized the comment got removed by a moderator because I mentioned a different sub.
---
More perk cards available would be great, but the things I carry (that the cards you mentioned apply to) wouldn't do me any good in a stash box
---
Ill turn the music back on when THAT intro returns.
---
Obsidian got picked up by big daddy M$ and has their financial backing. They are doing just fine keeping the lights on.
---
You're also seeing shit like this with 7k upvotes, you think that's representative of this sub?
---
I accept all ammo and weapons
---
We told you on thursday this was much bigger than just a handful of people. 
---
You didn't believe us as you were too consumed by your own hatred of Bethesda
---
I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre somebody who supports fallout first and is too afraid to stand up for what‚Äôs right??
---
Do you have a subscription to make this post?
---
Can you refer to the source? I've been curious to how the sales for the subscription did vs there expectations.   
---
I myself am hoping it was a major success.
---
They are silently working away on there next P2W model. Be patient and maybe it'll only be $99.98 a month.
---
You need to brush up on your definition of opinion.  
---
Calm down there buddy.
---
No, I don't... and that was kind of my point. It feels like other people are mad for people who play 76 despite having no involvement in the game whatsoever.
---
Same!! Honestly I should have known better than to put my stuff in. :(
---
Did it ruin the event or something? Nuking it could be worth it for more experience points and harder enemies
---
No, no they do not...lol
---
But they‚Äôre not as appetizing when you bite into one and nearly break a tooth on your shot.
---
The assault rifle looks stupid. That's why people don't use it as much.
---
looking up your name and there are 4 different ones.  
---
iistarvinmarvin0  
---
iistarvinmarvin  
---
iistarvinmarvin1  
---
IStarvinMarvinn  
---
Which one is you?
---
I think most people would agree they arent running the sub, but they can still influence plenty. 
---
Its really crazy to notice. It seems like more progressive companies target reddits major demographics (15-35 year old people). 
---
A huge one i notice is A24's heavy shilling on r/movies and r/horror. I like A24 and most of their movies, but the amount of repeated trailer posts, discussions, praise, positive reviews, etc is highly suspect. And it works. Its like massive viral marketing and promotion straight to the target demographic for cheap as hell. You pay a bunch of PR people an hourly rate to canvas appropriate subreddits and thats how massive circlejerks and narratives are helped in creation. 
---
I think most companies are becoming aware of this strategy and employing it on at least some scale.
---
Its why discussions about movies like Hereditary and MidSommar are considered memeworthy on r/horror and to a lesser extent r/movies. Not only is there legitimate fan discussion but all the heavy shilling/astroturfing have oversaturated those movies into dead horses long ago beaten.
---
I love playing with my few friends, but as an introvert I‚Äôd rather play a ‚Äúreal‚Äù fallout game alone than 76 with friends
---
I, too, would like to see the numbers. I'm very curious.
---
Thing is will the uptake continue?
---
Because I am trying it for a month and everyone I talk to is trying it for a month so might be a different story next month.
---
Oh does it? I just started a Fallout 4 game recently and found that 76 does not improve anything really. Everything weighs twice as much except for outfits in 76, because they want to inconvenience you to sell you on unlimited stash. Remember when they lied about stash? Turns out you can have unlimited items if you pay! It never made sense anyway, like why can you have 100 cop uniforms on you, but the minute you pick up a paint can you‚Äôre over encumbered? Camp building compared to 4 is just lol. There‚Äôs also the grind of finding resources (ammo and such), which conveniently, you can pay for your private server and hoard all the workshops and sweep out all the locations, so I guess it is like playing any other fallout! Except it costs $13 a month to play a lesser fallout... 
---
I recommend loading up 4 for yourself. The graphics look *better*, there‚Äôs vats, which just isn‚Äôt gonna work in a multiplayer game, there‚Äôs a story with characters you can actually care about (even for Bethesda writing XD), and you can MOD it, using player made mods that patch stuff Bethesda was too lazy to patch!
---
One of the benefits to living here, I suppose. Most hawkers/street vendors charge between $2-4, or about $1.50-3 USD. If you can afford it, there's nothing wrong with it, especially if you lack a viable alternative. It just seems out of the norm as a daily expense.
---
by looking into the C.a.m.p. gameplay trailer from months ago

[https://youtu.be/Og3A5yIs3b8?t=47](https://youtu.be/Og3A5yIs3b8?t=47)
---
Somebody else also pointed it out a month ago here [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d3b7lu/the\_new\_atom\_shop\_robot\_was\_in\_the\_original\_camp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d3b7lu/the_new_atom_shop_robot_was_in_the_original_camp/)
---
I hope so! I'm only level 30 and myself and a few lower levelled friends would love to be able to participate in the event on my server without level 200+ players jacking up the enemy levels
---
I‚Äôve noticed a lot of sub 10 karma users with almost no post history. Makes you scratch your chin a bit...
---
As I said a month ago, they can put a castle in the Atomic Shop complete with robot sex servants and Liberty Prime to guard it - with a 500-level instant character boost - for $400 cash, and I still would not give a fuck. How other people choose to play the game doesn't matter to me, so long as it doesn't encroach upon my play time.
---
I was a big fan of Fallout 4 (issues and all) and 76 was something that I was extremely hyped for coming from it; and the game itself turned out pretty amazing to play for some time. Enough that I defended its gameplay to my friends who only saw info about how this would be the "death of the fallout franchise".
---
I'm just not personally happy with Bethesda's way they're moving forward. Too much focus on the Atom shop (which is a bit *too* overpriced at times imho) and they released the Fallout 1st at a really poor time; as well as the bugs that came from it.
---
If they doubled down and really went all out attempting to fix and balance the game a lot more, it'd easily be a game I keep playing constantly.
---
It‚Äôs okay you added me back haha
---
I pulled a medic ffr agility Fixer yesterday. Meh.
---
Look for unusual things and go to unusual places.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be so sure A lot of players bought 1 month just for the ranger armor and aren‚Äôt not paying in the future
---
Under floor decor
---
The gamma gun is pretty much worthless in PvE.
---
What system are you on?
---
I doubt it‚Äôs reused servers given how they use amazon ones on off. Items will show as invisible if you looted them on a prior sever or that container. Dead enemies could be explained as a glitch or one enemy killing another. I seen several just drop over dead it‚Äôs been like that since Skyrim. 
---
Like I said if it‚Äôs not your cup of tea don‚Äôt drink it. But if enough people do and it helps support the game it‚Äôs wonderful
---
I think it was always going to show profit even if it‚Äôs largely a failure, they‚Äôve implemented a new revenue stream at relatively low cost to themselves.
---
Shareholders will lap it up, but long term Bethesda may have done more serious damage to its brand than they expected.
---
All that said, my original comment was mostly a joke
---
If you need to wear a costume for the extras than you won‚Äôt get extras.
---
I don't hate Bethesda. I've loved their games, including this one. Doesn't mean I'm willing to accept current decisions.
---
I knew it was big, most people I played with bought it right away. I held out hope that they would make a few tweaks to make it less scummy. I'm disappointed that it's unlikely.
---
Oh right lol, server is up btw, just don't take workshops if they are owned is all I ask. have the whole world and 8 players max so there shouldn't be much fighting over them.
---
i am seeing this more and more lately, its getting old annoying. like honestly who is trying to make max cap space on 1 or 2 sales like i don't get it. 
---
here are a couple times i have come across this...
---
\#1. i was approached by a couple guys who were really low leveled, like level 4 or 5, they asked to trade so i did i was thinking they wanted my stuff cause at the time i was like level 100. well the guy who wanted to trade had like 30 legendary guns, i was a little mind blown, how in the sweet fuck did this level 4 get these... turned out it was a mule character... i wanted his 3\* Medics Handmade, he said it was worth 17k but did not have any cap space between any of his characters so sold it to me for 12k. I personally feel it was a rip off but i am enjoying the gun none the less.
---
\#2. came across a guys camp. had the signs saying "msg for offers".... took a look and well ya since when is a 2\* Bloodied Shotgun worth 25k? or a 1\* Zealot Combat Rifle worth 23k? i message the owner and offered 5k for the combat rifle, only to get a message back saying i was a dick for low balling and piss off. well you ain't gonna sell anything with that attitude bud.
---
at my vendor i usually sell everything well under the so-called "market" value simply because i want to get rid of them. bobbleheads especially being 1.0 weight each. i could just sell them to vendor bots but i prefer to give my fellow wastelanders a chance at them first... FYI, i sell them for about 30 caps each, compared to some people whom i see sell them for upwards of 300 caps each
---
and on one final note..... this is on Xbox, there was a level 150-160 character that came by my camp near Fort McClintock and just gifted me like 10 fully charged fusion cores.... seriously whomever you are.... THANK YOU!!!
---
I have berzerkers explosive 50 cal. Im on PS4.
---
There are a few posts that have a long list of viable costumes.
---
Yeah, it's not a terrible idea. It's the same thing WoW has, it's the same thing ESO has. Subscription models for MMOs tend to work fairly well.
---
If there was better value in it, if there was more content, if the game wasn't such a disaster on its own, then I think a premium subscription service for Fallout 76 might have been okay. Really the only problem is that they took content that should have been free and are now charging for it, because they haven't added enough content to justify a premium subscription yet.
---
OTOH, how many high levels here complained about meat week et al being too easy?
---
So now the high levels can be happy with the event difficulty, (but the lower levels won't be.)
---
Or just play as you have for months before and not worry about accepting it or not... 
---
If a company or business making money is an issue buy games from a non profit game maker... oh wait... there isn‚Äôt any... 
---
If you feel it‚Äôs just too much and you uninstall it because Bethesda is bad... I suggest never going out into the real world... it‚Äôs not unicorns and rainbows...
---
Switch out your character build and try doing something different like only use pipe guns with leather armor only. Be a farmer.  Be a merch. Be a hunter. Be a hiker. Be a serial killer...
---
Sure, here it is  [https://mmogfails.blogspot.com/2019/10/fallout-76-and-fallout-1st-fiasco-it.html](https://mmogfails.blogspot.com/2019/10/fallout-76-and-fallout-1st-fiasco-it.html)
---
Source?
---
Apparently it fucks the event all up I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it.
---
I watched a video on YouTube last night about it by some lovely woman who had a witch theme but unfortunately I can‚Äôt remember her name, almost all outfits in game seem to count tho, anything that is remotely a costume anyway!
---
Exactly, but how many hours does it take to get a 3 Star Bloodied Explosive handmade and 5 pieces of 3 star armor to have your characters build maxed? That grind my get a little easier once you pay for a private server to legendary farm without those pesky kids wiping out all the hotspots...
---
I would like to be able to craft a radiation syringer.
---
600+ hours of game play and still crying about free stuff , at what point is this really just the gamers fault for thinking things should come for free from a multi billion dollar Industry. You don‚Äôt throw fits like this because you bought an iPhone and gotta pay for service and if you did the phone companies would laugh at you for being ridiculous just like that slap in the face Bethesda dropped on entitled gamers who think million dollar products should be free , you get payed for doing your job they should get paid for theirs !
---
Do it! Though I heard the between ghouls and robots kicking asses... it‚Äôs actually hard and fun!
---
Coolest and most underpowered
---
Sure, here  [https://mmogfails.blogspot.com/2019/10/fallout-76-and-fallout-1st-fiasco-it.html](https://mmogfails.blogspot.com/2019/10/fallout-76-and-fallout-1st-fiasco-it.html)
---
I feel bad for them, I think a lot of people forget they don't control that kind of stuff and they're people too, I wish folks were a little more respectful towards them
---
Fallout 1st scrap box bug was fixed like 36 hours after the initial patch/update.
---
The bugs that are here, have been here.
---
You don't need to buy anything to play the game.
---
It still plays the same, except for people attacking fallout 1st players.
---
Don't worry, most of the 1st community is cancelling after the .month expires.
---

I know this will sound snotty, which is not my intent. However, the English language depends so much on gestures and inflection of voice that things can be misconstrued in the written word. 
---
That‚Äôs why I said ‚Äúprobably not‚Äù. The only reason I posted that was because a lot of people have expressed specifically wanting that plan. I know proximity is not causation, however by stating what happened to me another person could try it and maybe they will say ‚ÄúI wore that too and received it.‚Äù, or they can say ‚Äúthat did not work for me‚Äù. As I have worked in military intelligence (I know, I know), sometimes the most innocuous intel could end up being the biggest deal. In other words, people do a lot of patch work in Fo76 to get us lots of cool information. I am not a math super brain like some of the people on here who will do the hard work, math, and trial and error so others do not have to. Just my two cents to the community.
---
I subscribe to 2 subs.   Fallout and Neverwinter. 
---
I guess im a shill for both Bethesda and Cryptic.
---
I dont go to other subs because most of reddit is a dumping ground for trash.
---
You also needed to dance for Todd.
---
But-but dude, robot sex servants!
---
You could finally get with those Assaultrons. Or have your own personal armada of Fistos!
---
Pretty sure I said nothing about free. I said that the box and tent should be purchasable like other atom shop items, not locked behind a recurring subscription. I also said I'd be happy to pay for a recurring atom bundle.
---
Maybe read before replying?
---
Gotta make money somehow
---
Yeah, right now the unlimited storage space isn't p2w because it is currently deleting everything put into it. But hey, you're right this game doesn't have any noticeable bugs... LMFAO
---
It removes your ability to get the rare rewards because you cant wear a costume, just saying
---
I'm from buenos aires and I say KILL 'EM ALL!
---
\- Johnny Rico
---
that's a hint
---
You wouldn't prefer that they focus on bettering the game instead?
---
How do i start the quest? i tried talking to the eyebot, but i'm guessing i have to wait for an hour for it to begin?
---
Disliking the new direction is fine.  Harassing or bullying people about it is *NOT* OK.
---
I'll uninstall when I don't have fun anymore.  Until then, I'm not going anywhere.
---
I love that we also have a Cyclone and Tornado
---
Many players use mules.  That‚Äôs additional 8000 lbs free with no limitations and only a little effort.
---
It also gives you the opportunity for extra 1400 caps from vendors per mule.
---
It's not broken man, it actually works fine. I've had one server crash on me in the last 6 months. 1st makes it a little less laggy.
---
Played the game since launch and clocked 1200hrs so you dont dare have the audacity to tell me that i dont play this game! , funny enough I've never come across a ammo converter, iconic gear( other than in atom shop or behind 1st paywall), how is the scrap collectron a companion and we deffo don't have pet companion other than subduing one for our camp.
---
Not once in my post did I mention p2w? and I deffo don't have any shortcomings lmao, I'm not salty I just see what will happen to this game I give a rats arse about, i see without rose tinted glasses unlike those who will buy into this fallout 1st shit. Everything nice will be behind the 1st pay wall mark my words.
---
I never knew that to be honest. Very interesting thank you for the input
---
It starts at the top of the hour!
---
Except you're not supporting a game, you're supporting scum-baggery.
---
Except you missed the point of the response. Take a breather and step back and look at it objectively. I get your a fan boy and that's alright but don't get angry because they have proved a point. Bethesda has already don't what he had commented. The examples were just examples. Bethesda has already shown the route they are going to take which is monitize the hell out of everything new/what is asked for. If not straight out monitized, it'll be through there pay for convenience (which is this games version of pay to win). Love the game if you want but don't be a fanatic. You can love something and still be able to criticize it for it's many many many many many many many many faults.
---
Go to a crafting station, pretend your going to make something. 
---
Walk away from your controler. 
---
I do this when I have to go to the store.   It works on XBox as it tricks your system into thinking it is not Idle.  It does the same thing with Fallout. 
---
I found this on accident one day when I had to run a buddy to work.  Came back like 45 minutes later and I was still online looking at my cooking recipies.
---
No I am somebody who bought Fallout First because I enjoy it and I can afford it.
---
What's right and what's wrong is subjective.
---
I run team medic. Does a diffuser do the same thing? I have a few and need to use them for a possum badge but haven‚Äôt tried one yet.
---
I‚Äôm hoping for tough human npcs with wastelanders release. Just gotta hold on to it for a few more yearsüòâ
---
They can multitask.
---
Personally, as I also said before launch, I wish they'd made this a single-player game from the start.  That'd be my preference, if I get to pick and choose.  But we are where we are.
---
Doubtful any numbers will hold up past the first month, people really wanted that outfit
---
Guess there really is ‚Äúno such thing as bad PR‚Äù
---
Bu-bu-but it's Fallout!!!
---
Coolest, most underpowered and most fun. They seriously need to fix this thing!
---
Maybe choose another real bad example because what you described sounds actually amazing. Well, for 400$ maaaaybe a bit pricey but if that‚Äôs not going to be in the atom store in the next few month I‚Äôm pissed!
---
This sub is run by Bethesda. I have proof.
---
Exactly lol in 2019 people think the internet is the Gospel when only a small amount of people use it. And right. These umbrella companies want money regardless of what people say.
---
How do you fix a game with no income, you don‚Äôt you shut it down as a liability
---
But where is the *actual* source?
---
you select mouth look or style and select a different 1. Each mouth is labled like : " Rounded 1 , rounded 2 , rounded 3 , pursed 1, 2 etc" 
---
I selected the mouth your character has because I like my character to look battle hardened and old. You also might have skin blemishes you have to go and unapply. If you choose any default face and then go to edit; there's a bunch of things loaded on that you may have noticed. The face editor is very deep. You can even chose ear and nose types! Hover over the neck and forehead and you'll see there's different styles of those too . Good luck
---
Looks like fun. Thanks for sharing.
---
And big ugly and boogerhole

---
\&gt;&gt; We will either have to hold our nose and do whatever internal justification is required to purchase Fallout 1st, or uninstall. 
---
OR, you could just keep playing the same way you have been for the last year.
---
Little effort??? So when I want to grab a few thousand rounds from a mule I have to hire a courier (stranger) or get the 1 person I know who plays to log on just to help me? I don't think that's little effort.
---
&gt; I pretty sure only a handful of people bought this service so it is not saying much when they say it affects only handful of people.
---
From what ive seen, quite a few people got at least the first month, because comparativly the atoms and ranger armor are worth the $13. Personally I don't see the rest of it worth the recurring cost.
---
&gt; Also this "private" session doesn't have privacy settings or any admin tools or mods and it only holds 8 people.
---
Sure, but those aren't bugs, those are just oversights or outright omissions on purpose. So your complaint about being a buggy broken mess is unfounded.
---
&gt; That is such a "good" value for a premium service.
---
To each their own.
---
&gt; While the Outer Worlds can be played on the xbox game pass for less than that.
---
Cool, then go play it. This isn't that game though, not are they direct competitors outside of both being games.
---
Has anybody earned the new firefighter costume yet? People have been saying it's a possible reward, but it's been hidden in the game since the beta as an unobtainable item.
---
I'm glad to know, I have been farming several nuke codes and my buddies have some as well. I guess the time has come.
---
Just get out of here and stop wasting everyone's time.
---
More that a handful of people bought this service.
---
It's odd, my friends on Ps4, the ones who didn't buy it are mostly visiting private servers.  They say it's better because they're are children running around screaming and they can actually nuke somewhere and they can enjoy it without people f ING events.  So, it seems pretty popular, unless of course you haven't tried it.  Plus, the bottomless scrap box is beautiful.
---
Shark cards weren't around day one in fact it took months to almost a year before they released shark cards...because if they were I and just about everybody I played with would have grabbed one...you were only making $5000 grinding contact missions...the most expensive item was the Adder at 1mil (Bugatti)...the problem with GTA Is that the items have increased tenfold while the value of a shark card has remained the same
---
Fake news. Purely denial that there are fans who love the game. Down vote all you want but the original post is based on zero facts.
---
Really. You can slap down your free to place immortal tent camp pretty much anywhere on a whim and take out whatever you need at any point.
---
mmogfails is not a reputable source for any kind of substantial information.  It looks like a guy posting opinions whenever he gets around to it.
---
It's being promoted here a lot lately, which needs to stop.
---
Glad to hear that man! I‚Äôm also enjoying it because I get to &lt;ERROR&gt; &lt;DATA LOST&gt;
---
your comment makes no sense, it would only make sense if game didnt change for worse since people got it, which it did, so people have fully right to be pissed off.
---
Imagine buying TV and over time TV getting worse and worse, making watching it less and less pleasant...
---
I didn't had any major bugs in f4. In outer worlds u have insane had bobbing that a lot of people get sick by playing the game.
---
Words "Bethesda" and "fix" cannot be near each other. When will you people learn proper English?

There is a chest at the event to grab one.
---
I agree. Im enjoying gaming alot less because of these pay walls or making the game a part time job thats nothing but grinding but the new generation is fine with it and money talks so people like me are boned. 
---
Look at all the subs people pay now. For tv, music hell they even have services that mail you loot boxes to your house for all variety of things. Its just normal accepted business practice now.
---
Tell that to Barbara Streisand.
---
The scrapboxes are deleting everything being put in it randomly. That is broken...

---
Quad Explosive Aim Damage Harpoon is pretty nasty. Vampire's FFR Plasma Flamer is pretty high up there as well!
---
Interesting. Of course the blogger doesn‚Äôt cite any sources, but they do say that people at Bethesda aren‚Äôt happy with how it was launched and they may change features ‚ÄúDepending on how big a deal people make about it.‚Äù 
---
If we‚Äôre to take their comment about sales at face value, then we should take the rest as well. I‚Äôm not sure that means we should just accept it or move on. I think that means the embarrassment needs to continue. 
---
My issue with FO1st isn‚Äôt that a subscription exists. It‚Äôs that it puts QoL items that the community has requested behind a subscription paywall. Get those out of there, get rid of the ‚ÄúUtility‚Äù items, and I‚Äôm good.
---
The angry youtubers make videos trashing fallout 76 for clicks and views. They dont even play the game. They hypnotize the masses to believe what they are saying. I will not allow myself to be in that groupthink mindset. If i see something of value i will buy it and enjoy it. I will not allow some youtuber who doesnt even play the game to persuade me with his harsh opinions that are presented as facts. 
---
Yeah but for what? For resources that mean nothing.
---
The game has no real technological progression in its building aspect. If you get the blueprint it can be build. No different tiers of materials to aquire. No better utility items in the camp. Some are a bit harder to come by, but people figured out to use a wiki which tells him where a ton of stuff is hidden and then rejoin different servers to loot the same place multiple times.
---
At least it was like that. Then you attack a workshop. You get a bounty on your head and almost instantly high level player teleports to you to kill you for even the lowest of bounty. PvP is meaningless.
---
If you're talking about mmogfails, he's a noted and known person with ties in the industry who has lead-leaked several stories.
---
If you're talking philosophically, I hear the answer to life, the universe, and everything is 42.
---
You just want to spend your caps on legendaries OP. There are ton of cap sinks in this game. You just choose not to buy serums and high cap plans.
---
&gt; "Pay to win means to ME is being able to purchase said gun with a bigger clip and bullets that do more damage that I can't aquire by doing anything in the game"

---
Why wouldn't they be happy with getting their money back and still getting access to the features they paid for? Seems the only reason they'd be unhappy is that everyone gets the features, at which point, that says more about them than anything else.
---
This.

That your approach to games is controversial shows how damaged people in our society are today.

Server rental? Lol

I can even come to accept permanent utility items like the collectron and fridge in the atom store if once I purchase them they're mine.

The subscription part is the one that kills it for me.

Nope, prefer just being able to run the servers on our own hardware to mod as we like, just like minecraft does it.

The downvotes indicate there may be something to this.
---
You rented it for a month after spending 60-35$ on the base game.

This, also i believe sleeping in your bed and hanging out in a crafting statino work too (although people may need some of those services so making a spare "afk point" is always that extra nice step)

Everyone is free to visit /r/TheOuterWorlds for discussion of that game.

The topic of this subreddit is Fallout 76 and all posts must be DIRECTLY related to it.
---
When you gaze into the abyss the abyss gazes back.
---
I like the hunt myself. It‚Äôs frustrating, but the satisfaction of finally getting what you‚Äôre looking for is sweet.
---
Absolutely. Obviously hard to prove but its suspect. Also Reddit is a breeding ground for advertisement anyway. 
---
From censoring content to be acceptable to those who pay, to super users like gallowboob being paid to shill, to AMAs being used to push products, etc.
---
For example just think how many articles have been written off of this subreddit alone. Recently articles referencing broken scrapboxes get their info directly from this sub. 
---
And if a post gets high enough to front page status you are exposing your news/products to thousands more eyes. 
---
Bethesda is hoping to capture and incite a counter jerk on this subreddit to help balance the narrative and buy some positive PR for their service.
---
Can you do that if you don't have an Xbox or Xbox account or anything like that? I just have steam atm but i've been wanting to give it a try

What? Then what is the point of playing fortenite? Killing other players doesn't persist through rounds. By your excuse there is literally nothing they could add to this game that would be "p2w" as there is no "win" screen at the end of the game. That is just ridiculous, I mean bethesda removed foundation stacking because people were making indestrucible bunkers, they said they were gamebreaking. Now here they are selling you the same feature.
---
You might not see it as a problem but bethesda did when they patched it out, so them selling it back is beyond disgusting and shows how little they actually care.
---
Oh, and play I do. I am not trolling, I am standing up for my money. I bought two copies of Fallout 76 (one being a CE that was really hard to get). I am entitled to say my opinion. You are not a fan it seens, just a bootlicker. A true fan wouldn't suport the raping of the franchise. Grow up and learn to accept other people opinions. Like to get buttfucked by Bethesda? Good for you, you got all right to bend over. What you can't is to ask the rest to do the same.
---
* your keyboard is broken
---
* what's that vid supposed to show, besides some dude being unable to kill some lvl 48 mobs?
---
Exactly
---
And your point is?
---
Destiny and anthem?  They are probably closer to mmo then 76 since it's mostly solo action.
---
Mind, I'm not taking I to account RNG grind drop rate only stuff to do.
---
I know what you mean, pretending that this doesn't exist is willful ignorance, idiocy, or just more PR.
---
Thank you for being a sensible person
---
How do you know for a fact that there aren't shell accounts run by Bethesda PR teams, much in the same way Twitter has legions of bots?
---
What are you smoking? It has 121 base damage at 6.7 rounds per second.
---
Where there's smoke etc etc
---
How much of the outfit counts towards wearing an outfit though? Because if the masks counts, then you can wear a mask over power armor.
---
Please for the love of god do not let money get involved in this in anyway. Korean MMO's do this, it will kill the game.
---
I haven‚Äôt been disconnected, but my screen has been frozen for about five minutes now. I‚Äôm not on the ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hate Bethesda‚Äù bandwagon, but they kinda needed this to go well to get back into people‚Äôs good graces.
---
You're somehow missing the fact that the Outer Worlds community is, other than folks playing their very first fpsrpg, all ex-Fallout fans. They didnt snap into existence; they were molded by BGS' extensive poor treatment of ~this~ community.
---
And what major content has been added after one year of release? Because if i log in now on my max level character i will be doing the same exact Scorchbeast Queen runs i did before. I see nothing else to do at endgame other then 1 boss over and over again.
---
Three, a handmade, lever and gauss.
---
&gt;it‚Äôs not actually your server
---
It's your *instance*.  You leave and it vanishes.  You should be able to AFK for a month.  You're paying for it.
---
I'd love to do this event but blue screened twice on the first event and just blue screened out of the 2nd one. Good job Bugthesda.
---
He doesn't have one
---
I totally agree.
---
I took over hemlock and built my new camp for 2 hours. It was fantastic.
---
Elder coat and sack hood

Someone should smash a keyboard into a million pieces and mail it to them.
---
This they did.

I'm planning to run around in X-01 with Skull hood, trying to look like Skeletor.
---
What's the psychology behind an endless scrap bag? There is no limit or measure that can be put on it and this is one of the example. We all know people will abuse the hell out of it. If anyone use pack rat, it's rendered useless now with the tent. Since you don't provide any real arguments, I don't have to continue this discussion.
---
Same happened with me
---
Most of us know better than to engage with PR/morons who are still defending the game.
---
Bethesda : Hey would like features that the community has been asking for? Here you go, it's just locked behind a premium service.
---
I have so many new blue prints
---
What the fuck is with everyone being on some r/conspiracy shit lately?
---
Negative
---
It depends on what is next month, that is yet to be announced. At least some of the people who already got used to the scrapbox may also not want to return to not having it.
---
Not sure of the exact time but you definitely can‚Äôt legit AFK. I was kicked from mine in the same time I would of been had it been public.
---
lol- right?
---
Haha, y'all fucking purchased trash from day one. No sympathy!
---
My original post was hyperbole but I always forget that on the internet people can get very pedantic (and sensitive! ‚ÄúJerk face‚Äù). Haha. 
---
Yes there are a couple people buying steel not zero. Not a big mover in terms of total caps spent or posts. It won‚Äôt be destroying the economy or what‚Äôs left of the economy already destroyed by BGS.
---
Individuals commit the sunk cost fallacy when they continue a behavior or endeavor as a result of previously invested resources (time, money or effort) (Arkes &amp; Blumer, 1985). ... For example, individuals sometimes spend so much time in a video game they feel invested and when they get a chance to subscribe, they just do it to ‚Äúget their money's worth‚Äù
---
Maxxsouth..... Out of curiosity are you in Mississippi?
---
Press X to doubt
---
what was your post about?
---
Correct
---
I'd say that around level 15 or so if you planned your stats well you start one hitting most things, I remember killing the behemoth in the car jail around level 12
---
I rather use the used tiolet paper.
---
PA and Hazmat suits have hidden Rad Resistance stats, so while you will have more stated resistance, you will still take more rads/ sec
---
Cool.... I'm just north of Hattiesburg.  I'm familiar with the company though.
---
Only a few times in a year have I found anything in game that I really liked. I mostly purchase/trade from player/ player vendors. It‚Äôs annoying IMO.
---
I carry 4, FE handmade, instigating pipi revolver rifle, instigating .50 cal hunting rifle and VE combat rifle
---
I see the bat weapon challenge but not the others.
---
Game froze during current Mischief event, so I dashboarded and now I can‚Äôt even get the game to launch.
---
I pretty much just said exactly this lol
---
Imagine paying $100 a year to downgrade back to Fallout 4.
---
I just transitioned to a rifles build from heavies. 
---
I carry 4 on me.  My main bloodied lever.  A TSE Handmade (for groups of stuff or bugs) an ExeE Lever and a VE Combat.
---
The Vampires is for when stimpacks just wont get me through a fight, the Executioners is my backup, and the TSE is for groups or little enemies (bugs and roaches)
---
I also still carry my BGat Plas and BMini just in case.
---
Gotcha! Yeah I would server hop too! Thank you for the clarification!
---
Gets downvoted for stating facts smh .-.
---
2nd Edition rewards: Snubnosed .44, Scarecrows Plan, Mobster Jack O Lantern, consumables 
---
Had the legendary sentry bot again, got 1* armor
---
I've crashed on 2/2 events so far
---
once was a hard lock and once CTD. missed the rewards on the second event obvi because of how long it takes to load back in. not thrilled.
---
Of course it says more about them, but you can‚Äôt really expect a company to promise something exclusive  to people for money, take it back and then give it to everyone without some of those people getting upset that their exclusivity no longer means anything. 
---
You should have seen the shitstorm that happened when DICE gave everyone the ‚Äúphantom program‚Äù exclusive compound bow in BF4... and that wasn‚Äôt even paid beyond getting Premium for the map DLC.
---
You're just wrong about the statement of fact thing. You can state facts on other people's opinions. I'm not vouching for the not though
---
I don't expect mods to ever be objective or neutral in their beliefs. Of course the mod of r/spaghetti is gonna like spaghetti, and it's not really a stretch to think that even some of the users might like it too.
---
They seem to forget quite quickly, when i kill the sentries for xp they‚Äôre not hostile the next time I go, maybe swapping servers does it?
---
have you gotten any of the plans yet? i just won " Plan: *Happy Jack O*'*Lantern*. " but i cant find it in my inventory ;(
---
On a certain level I‚Äôm ok with the concept of putting community requests in the Atom Shop‚Äîas one time purchases, not subscriptions, not consumables. I get that there‚Äôs a plan and a development budget in place, shifting to accommodate requests isn‚Äôt usually in the cards at all for most games, so I could accept this. I think most players would too if it were handled right. 
---
Honestly, I think they could make FO1st a sub for just private worlds and an Atom Bundle and get the same money in return. Nobody‚Äôs paying $100/yr for a Scrapbox, they want the private servers. 
---
Give everybody the Scrapbox to win back some goodwill and make the Survival Tent a one time purchase. Then explain how there will be a new ‚ÄúCommunity Requests‚Äù section on the Atomic Shop, featuring one time purchase items that have been popular requests. Just be straight about it, no more spin, no more BS. I think players could accept that.
---
NO! NOOOOOOOOO!!!  I will not sacrifice Fallout. We've made too many compromises already, too many retreats. They sell us MTX, and we buy them. They sell P2W items in the Atomic shop, and we buy them. Not again. The line must be drawn here! This far, no further! And I will make them pay for what they've done!
---
Worked this time for me!
---
Not sure if they are, but if so you can just hop servers and they'll be friendly again.
---
Well it is. Well done , enjoy it.
---
You don't need to carry 15 weapons. A bloodied faster fire gattling gun would replace all of those. You just can't beat 400 plus dmg from a 5mm round.
---
Ehhhhh that's true however buying it is big idiot mode.
---
Billings Homestead, Pumpkin House, Tyler County pumpkin shed
---
Why am I not surprised it's broken.
---
Is this recent? I thought major mods couldn‚Äôt be together on one weapon
---
I think the ability to get the EXACT piece of gear you want (especially as 3\*) should not be included in the game.  And hell no to spending money, we can argue the additions now - the invincibility of the tent should be removed, and we could argue for and against the P2W aspect of the scrap box, but outright being able to buy the specific item.  No. Bethesda wouldn‚Äôt want that either because once you have what you want, you remove the need for engagement from the players.
---
Not the same thing you were mentioning
---
Paid off to post this. How does Todd taste?
---
he claimed to have inside information as an alleged employee of bethesda
---
And on this note, to anyone quitting the game, you should be giving out all your loot and weapons to the remaining players. Do raffles or just massive giveaways. Keep the community positive despite the negative. It's just a thought but it will go a long way.
---
Explosive is a secondary effect
---
Explosive had always been a secondary effect.
---
It's also crashed for me doing it on a public server every time. But in a private world it works perfectly.
---
They literally did that with their "cosmetics only" claim about this game. So they have no problem going back on their word. I honestly don't care if some people get butthurt that they can't be in some exclusive club. They can stay in their little privater server if they want, the adults will move on without issue.
---
Ban wave? I really really doubt that will happen. The only players I‚Äôve ever seen banned were for antisemitic or homophobic language; which even then was only a temp ban.
---
I promise you I‚Äôm not talking down to you or your view here, but I see a lot of people saying they report other players all the time for ‚Äúharassment‚Äù but I don‚Äôt think Beth cares. I think the report feature is just for legal purposes/pacifying the players
---
I enjoyed the ending. Everyone standing around the legendary bot. My experience with AWOL armaments says that‚Äôs not a good idea.
---
Maybe it's the ghouls!
---
Anti-armor is the prefix, and explosive is a secondary trait. Yes it's still possible to drop, but not on energy weapons.
---
"Holy Shit, It's JuiceHead!" 
---
Great, he's probably saying, "*Holy shit*, it's Maverick and Goose."
---
I carry 2, sometimes 3... for different situations, sneaky sniper or up close tse mayhem
---
And this time it didn‚Äôt work for me! ü§£ still was fun
---
Floor decor somewhere, I‚Äôll have another look next time I‚Äôm in camp
---
Haha amazing you are trying to defend this.
---
Melee weapon, combat, gauss, 2x BP, radium, 2x syringer, flare gun, 90wr fatman, tesla
---
U can have stackable weapon weight reduction on legendary armor pieces, up to 90%
---
What legendary effects? What about melee? Do you have a low carry capacity?
---
Its only possible during the actual ‚Äûvandalism‚Äú part and sometimes the reward is a bit delayed, so maybe you did interact with it but it wasn‚Äôt popping up at your screen ;)
---
I'm L40 and was afraid this would happen. I can't handle Whitespring alone on a normal day.
---
GARY GARY GARY GARY
---
Funny how you bought the tricentennial version and see only just now complaining about it. Almost like your motivated by the bandwagon
---
Devann sent me your video when I initially asked her, yours was so awesome! Congrats you two!
---
No, I don't mean Elder Scrolls IV: Obsidian, I mean the gaming company Oblivion.
---
Innovaurvivalist and juicehead are two of the best with fallout 76 coverage. Their research is more than just citing Reddit post. They actually play the game, and know it. When they report , I consider it an informed source. Where as Yong Yea and Jim sterling , are more of just general content creators. Jim sterling I cannot stand . He reminds me of a character from an insane clown posse album. Yong Yea , I enjoy his content. I like his delivery and analysis. But he doesn't actually play the game enough to feel the way he acts like he does about it. I take no one pov as doctrine , because I enjoy thinking. I feel the best , sincere coverage of the goings on within this game community as a whole , is better delivered by individuals that are part of it. Rather than reading and reposting certain views from within an echo chamber. FYI neither juicehead or innovsurvivalist , care for fallout first either. But their coverage comes from sincerity rather than just seeking views/clicks.
---
Lame
---
He is just talking about readers in this subreddit. Lots of people quit playing but read this sub for the "train wreck" effect, and the off chance bethesda actually does fix the game, because we actually want to game to be good. Not this mtx ridden buggy mess.
---
Having modded cw backpack helps as well
---
No Ablest slurs!
---
We caught our marketing doing this and they pretended innocence and we just removed the fake posts and after that they either became smarter or they stopped doing it.
---
You know how you stay wealthy by not spending money frivolous or investing in something you thing will never turn a profit. Doesn‚Äôt matter who is running a negative asset is a liability that you get off your books. It‚Äôs a business not a charity
---
I only carry 15 because I don‚Äôt have the storage... and don‚Äôt want to sell them yet. I only consistently use 4-5...
---
Okay thanks, had a salty wanted player almost destroy my whole camp just because I almost melted him with my anti armor explosive 50 cal
---
No it's true. My sister just graduated college last spring as a business major and her current internship is basically what OP described but she exclusively deals with instagram. It's for one of the bigger US candy companies.

---
I'd like to know why so many people are willing to overlook the lie. If this had been any other company, people would be tearing them a new asshole instead of dividing the community.
---
I paid $60 for this game because I was told, pre-launch, that ALL POST LAUNCH Content would be free. This is Bait and Switch, plain and simple.
---
What exactly didn‚Äôt you like?
---
Yes, all my faith will be restored from the products that Obsidian delivers:

What are you doubting? I can clarify things if you would like me to
---
I carry 3 weapons usually. I always have an smg and a handmade on me. My third weapon is either an explosive laser, a tesla, a plasma, or a railway
---
I‚Äôve been playing the game since it was released. There was one time i lost a suit of power armor to a glitch. That sucked, but it‚Äôs extremely rare. Most play sessions i don‚Äôt see any bugs.
---
You're welcome for my service
---
 OK. Downvotes for asking if your char is finished. 
---
 Can you take all the Legendaries from the Ghouls at The Whitespring? Is a Scorchbeast a problem? How about 3 of em'. Is Wes-Tec exciting or just a steel run? 
---
 I could go on.
---
BE on all off them. Got around 250 carry weight with an unyielding/chameleon set, and carry a bss grognak's axe.
---
I carry 1 bloodied handmade and 1 crap pistol for not one shotting during events.
---
Come on.
---
Underneath our costumes we're all the same.
---
No reason to do that.
---
Try and get along.
---
No one cares. Why don't you find another game to play? Almost all of them have over priced cosmetic items you can complain about.
---
bloodied handmade. Instigating/reduced weight  hunting. AAE lever. Reduced weight Tesla. Reduced weight AA shishkabob. I have a few weight reducing armor. I sit around 90-100 pounds including a PA.
---
They've released Encryptid, which is an end game event that costs 2k caps to trigger, and summons an invulnerable Assaultron that completely ignores armor and has unique rewards.
---
There's also Project Paradise, which is another end game event that summons an alpha creature with higher damage resist and increases damage, and also gives unique rewards. 
---
Then there's the vault raids, which reward unique armor plans with set bonuses. Not many people play those it seems though. It's mostly because most find them tedious but there's a few missions which rotate weekly
---
I use armor with weapons weight reduction (2 pieces) and I carry 1 lever, 1 sniper rifle, 1 melee weapon (sword), 1 and a handmade. You don‚Äôt need 15 heavy weapons, choose 3/4 between them
---
Yeah even with Fireproof on, im wary!
---
I'm going by what bethesda said, they are the ones who admitted this bug is happening.
---
I think you're confused. The definition is the definition. Like it or not. You don't get to just make your own definition because you don't agree.
---
You cant grief what you cant find. 
---
Good luck, we hide on private servers now.
---
I carry 10 total.  I have 4 main weapons (2 lever actions, 1 handmade, 1 tesla) and I also carry 6 "just for fun" weapons.  I rely on the 20% weapon weight reduction armor perks and have at least 3 pieces of armor with the effect on at all times.  I'm not that impacted by weight with 60% wwr and it's a blast having my options.
---
Is there Gary wooden blocks refference in 76 btw?
---
Hell yeah I'm on your side then
---
16 times worst than EA
---
Whatever it takes to get my legendary mirelurk king back :(
---
I don't, I've said this
---
OBJECTION. Badgering my client. Your honor, I call for a recess.
---
It's why I'm here my dude!
---
The second time around, I decided to let the more well-equipped players deal with the robots while I do the secondary objectives such as lighting bonfires and such
---
That went *much* better than the first time, since now I only had to avoid the occasional ghoul here and there rather than avoid things wanting to kill me from all directions
---
Nah, I just say: Its not a game at all worth playing or with a meaningfull progression after a certain point.
---
Leveling my character was fun. Even after the cap because I could fine tune my build and it felt different. But after that. The game falls flat on its face because outside of your own character progression there is no other progression.
---
Better gear drops with higher levels. Even blueprints and stuff shows up after you reach character level milestones. I played now many other survival games. Don't Starve, ARK and 7 Days to Die. And they all have outside of your character progression the "survival progression". Normally you start with the basic problem: Food and Water. Later on its to try to build something up. From the small hut to a big fortress. In case of don't starve you start to notice new mechanics like sanity and whatnot.
---
But Fallout76 has nothing of that. So there is no meaningfull interaction between players so there is really no pay2win. Especially if you consider that you gain a bounty if you attack other peoples camp and then being ganked by a high level player that just teleports into the area because of 50 caps bounty.
---
Yes... What the shareholders think is unimportant. Hey shareholders, give them $1million to only get $5,000 a month in dividends. Without shareholders the company does not exist, Bethesda doesn't have the money to buy back their shares, what's even better is, the shareholders can fire the CEO... So good luck telling them their opinion is unimportant, because you'll soon find yourself unemployed and being sued personally for their losses.
---
I really can't stand to play with people like that. Question? Did your game freeze during the event?
---
The only con I‚Äôm noticing is that the instancing is kind of weird. Went to look for PA pieces last night. 0-10 on private server. 6-10 on public.
---
Dont think it is bad luck. Twice here.
---
I was bringing attention to how they got screwed and obviously don't want the deal they're now stuck with. The below is a tweet from them when it was announced. 
---
&gt;Our partners at @EpicGames have announced that #TheOuterWorlds will be coming to the Epic Games Store at launch, alongside the Windows Store. It will be released on other digital platforms 12 months later. The Outer Worlds will still release on XBOX and PS4 on launch.
---
No enthusiasm just a bland straight-forward announcement.
---
And this was a reply to someone saying they'll wait a year because of Epic.
---
&gt;It wasn't our deal and the game isn't exclusive to EGS. You can also get it on the Windows 10 Store and Xbox Game Pass PC on day one. Though if you want to wait, we totally understand!
---
They make it clear it wasn't thier deal and provide a work around. I wish the people at Obsidian the best they make great games. But they got blindsided and screwed by this deal.
---
you're pathetic. imagine defending getting ripped off
---
I was curious so I analyzed some posts on the sub when I was still ankle deep in 76 (honestly if it weren't for HD space I would have kept it on when I got a hankering for it). There were a remarkable number of people in negative threads about the game that had literally never played it or claimed to never play it again. 
---
Meanwhile me, my two friends, my sister all got 76 and had a great time on it. Buggy as fuck at launch that they slowly pared down but had/has quite a bit on content and many things to do, and you could do it together. It's not a bad offering for a company that's never done online before, they clearly did a lot of research on how to keep people occupied that ARE going to spend 10-12 hours a day playing. 
---
You know what, I should reinstall the game. I got a good 500 hours out of it but I'd like to see what's new. Good post.
---
This!
---
Thank you, I appreciate your support in this trying time
---
On the plus side, great legendary shotguns are supremely undervalued now because they underperform compared to rifles, gauntlets and heavy guns.  Keep an eye on trade forums and you‚Äôll probably scoop up a great one for a few thousand caps.
---
TS/E is still no slouch, but you do need to get very close.
---
i dont blame them
---
Buy would be an option, not the only way to do it. Bottom line is Bethesda wants to make money for the shareholders. They would earn A LOT more $$$ if they did this. People would bitch and moan but many people would also secretly do it. I really enjoy their product, and would pay a few bucks (if need be) to get my last two armor pieces. Max level heavy leather Vanguard is hard to find...
---
not even close
---
UGH I still have not been to Hillbilly Hotdogs this year!  I've tried to stop several times but it was too busy for the time I had to spend.  The taco dog is calling my name :(
---
Good human
---
I too have the issue. Got the bats paint and don't see anymore
---
Keep dreaming. If they wanted to do that they'd do it already.
---
I love calling the Xbox One the XBone
---
ofc it works perfectly in the private instances :(.  Events like these, if they work, are what brings the folks together to have fun in the same space and make new friends.  So disappointing.  Thanks for the tip though. I guess maybe I'll run private with the boys later on instead
---
Oh okay word thank you.
---
It broke my heart to see players buying the subscription.
---
Fool. Thanks for helping to make the problem worse. You only encourage them.
---
Derp
---
Enjoy!
---
You usually get paid to participate in studies, not the other way round.
---
Ok, I just read that post.  My point still stands.  How do you propose that Bethesda pay for the development and maintainance of new content?
---
Let's take his "horse armor" example.  I remember that.  This was at a time when DLC, at least as far as console gaming is concerned, was a relatively new thing.  I remember the original Xbox days, when companies like Ubisoft and Tecmo would release DLC for free, or put them on the discs included with gaming magazines for players to buy and download (and share with friends).
---
The development of any DLC costs companies money.  I don't think that's even debatable.  How do you propose that they pay for it?  Raise the prices of the base game?  Yeah right.  People would riot.  People also forget that games have cost relatively the same amount since the 80's.  Name any other product out there that costs the same now as it did 40 years ago.  None come to mind.  So do we really expect developers to continue to honor a 40 year old precedent and stay in business, when the size of games has jumped exponentially?
---
Seriously, what's your plan here, if not monetization?
---
If you are going to make that argument, then this game is the most valuable game I have ever played.  
---

Not just stupid. It‚Äôs ugly abomination
---
im pretty sure gta private sessions arent dedicated
---
Agreed
---
Once again, you are claiming there is nothing bethesda could do that would count as p2w because there is no "win" condition. Then you also agree candy crush isn't pay 2 win as there is no player interaction at all, there is no "win" condition where you don't progress to a new level, etc. as well. Even though it is one of the most well known p2w examples out there.
---
Five - two  handmade, two lever and a .50 cal sniper (hunting)
---
Or.... they get it... 1st
---
Keep dreaming.
---
I spent 3000 scrip on 2 characters during the sale and received garbage (to me) so I feel your pain!
---
I get that yeah, and I won't pretend to know to understand it but I won't deny it either.
---
As I've said previously my point wasn't against bots and stuff it was about the mod team specifically but once again thank you for the input, it's very interesting.
---
No, but it lagged, I'm normally in passive mode, so my camp won't get damaged, because I don't horde scrap
---
I didn‚Äôt check sorry :(
---
Or maybe people just blind. What do you think ‚Äúfirst‚Äù means then?
---
It's a lot easier if you solo it.
---
I‚Äôm running junkies, in the process of looking for good explosive weapons.
---
You're right. I'm sorry that I went so low
---
That'd make the subscription even shittier, since they paid way more money, unless the tent costs 30000 atoms or something.
---
I don't know how to tell you this, but people enjoy things. They may even...and you may need to sit down for this one...enjoy things you don't. You don't have to enjoy the game. You don't have to approve of Fallout 1st. You may be disappointed by outcomes, and even state as such. What you must do, is share spaces with people who don't agree with you. It works best when we don't treat others with contempt. It works best when we keep the rhetoric, fortune-telling, ad hominem attacks and circular reasoning to ourselves, but people don't agree on that either, and we're going to have to accept that, too. We're all here because we chose to be, and everyone gets a seat at the table.
---
The only way they would turn it around to make a ton of money would be if they kept adding in new, and better armor pieces so the ones you just bought now need to be replaced. 
---
If I spent $10 to buy a perfect gun, I never need to buy that gun again.  Meanwhile, people who didn‚Äôt like it now stop paying $13 a month for subscriptions and stop buying monthly bundles of atoms. 
---
They might make a lot in the short run, but lose in the long run.  If you really want to spend cash for the perfect gear, just buy it from somone on EBay.
---
Lol ur jim sterling comment thats the reason i like his videos as far as acting like he does u may be right but im guessing like many he liked the older games and seeing what beth does to a franchise u may have liked is gonna get u irritated ive seen a few juicehead videos not enough to have an opinion
---
Good marketing would suggest it would be very smart to release it later. Make money off the subscription first, then release that content later for a second wave of purchases. This is not that uncommon.
---
17hours later almost 8k , you guaranteed downvotes. That kind deception can only mean one thing. You must work zos marketing.
---
I have yet to see it myself in the game.
---
I'm a bloodied build and nukes don't give me any trouble at all. I got rid of Healing Factor.
---
Before people just bark whatever think about it. ‚ÄúFirst‚Äù. First to get new features. Some atoms and exclusive outfits for your troubles. They did say test servers coming sooner than later sooooo
---
So you think Bethesda is charging people money so to test out atom shop items, so that people who don't pay extra money get it in a bug free state?
---
Are you guys seriously that stupid?
---
If your on PS4 you can join my private world and it will make it a lot easier to complete. And also the game doesn't freeze.
---
Went with BE since they are easy to obtain, as for junkies, the price range for a JE handmade is pretty high.

When I last played I carried about 10 guns on me at a time. I had five pieces of unyielding AP armor with three of those being WWR as the third star. With my bloodied build I think I was usually at like 400 carry weight or somewhere between 350-450?
---
I played this morning and the bat skin for 250 overseer xp was in there. Haven‚Äôt checked in the last few hours though.
---
Of course they'd not show enthusiasm for the epic store as that was right around the time those idiotic devs from obblets came out and went epic exclusive and was all smug about it and ended up hated by their entire community. They know how to read the public perception, so it is hard to tell if they were just being cautious or what.
---
Clean spacesuit and helmet, with tesla.
---
Then that makes it completely pointless to buy the subscription.

---
Welcome to 2019
---
That's one of the dumbest things I've read, Bethesda can easily create accounts. Next time post the right information first and not in an edit if you don't want people to act angry.
---
You can swap out cards anytime. This is very common, such as when repairing armor or crafting ammo. You're good.
---
Or are you that stupid?  Just tell me what First means to you then?
---
It took months for them to add more expensive shark cards, they were there in the beginning. GTA online also didn't release with the game, it came a month or so later. 
---
The Rhino was also there at launch, and cost 1.5 million.
---
Don‚Äôt know, I played 76 for like ten minutes and never touched it again...
---
Same build, same problem mate
---
Mr Fuzzy costume with Martian vault girl head. LOL because the grind for the Mr. Fuzzy head is taking me furever. üòù

---
Also, I promise not to nuke Whitesprings first.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a AA/Ex dragon lol
---
Is it now? I may do that for that toon. For the others the stupidity is too much fun!
---
I only saw the first bat skin reward  also. Couldn't see or unlock the other rewards....
---
Again dude you are just flat out wrong. Im a heavy junk trader and people buy steel from me all the time in discord markets. Sorry that you replied to my comment with false information and are mad that i corrected you
---
Also at 1200 hrs you should have gotten enough Atoms from incidentally completing challenges to afford both the refrigerator and the scrapatron.  If you dint blow it all on cosmetics.
---
Because a single YouTube channel is the most valid source of everything community related
---
Nah, I stand by my comments, hence why they're still there, I won't remove a comment because I was dumb
---
Not when you still have access to a private server to test the stuff, more atoms than cost of sub, and exclusive items to make up for it.
---
I dunno man. Your username is Optimus Russo, are you an Autobot? The US president's wife is called the First Lady, does she get to stand first in every line or something? It's a fucking name.
---
Grim reaper cutout and fireman uniforms were my first rewards
---
I get that for sure
---
Dont care thanks thanks for the caps
---
I think along the same lines. Generally the 5 stars aren't worth going through and the 1 stars are the same way. Generally Its the 3 star reviews where I find the best actual info and reviews.
---
I mean this is just...reality. Bethesda single player games are floated on a massive modding community, otherwise they're pretty much unplayable trash. Console versions are just...horrific.
---
Atm I'm carrying a BFFR Handmade, BFFR Combat Rifle, BFFR LMG, BFFR 50cal, BFFR Tesla, BFFR SMG and a Bloodied knife. Yea, I like BFFR
---
Oooof. I run a bloodied sneak, heavy on the VATS cuz I can‚Äôt aim. This might be the challenge I‚Äôm looking for.
---
While it's true there are no perk card bonuses for rifles you can easily reduce your weapon weight for rifles (and indeed all weapons) by acquiring 3\* legendary armor with the tertiary level 20% weapon weight reduction perk which stacks (multiplicative stacks, not additive stacks -- i.e. 5 pieces gets you ~67% weight reduction on all weaps, not 100%).
---
That being said, with 4 armor pc w/ 20% wep weight redux (-60% weight)I run a dual commando/heavy build w/ ~15-20 weapons in tow. This includes about 5 heavies (2 Prime SBQ guns, 1 Encryptid Troubleshooters gun, 1 Mob/Boss event gun and a gat lazer for the lolz), 5-6 rifles (AA Handmade for daily driver, AA lever for low level mobs, sniper rifle, AA gauss I never use but weighs too much to store, plasma flamer and a AAE Railway Rifle I love to show off at group events) and 5-6 various weapons usu reserved for challenges/events/lolz (AAE combat shotgun for crits, shovel, tenderizer, crossbow, drill, sword, etc.).
---
W/ my weight bonuses each rifle and heavy weapon weigh about 4-5 pounds each. I have bear arms (which takes the heavies down to like 1-2 pounds each) but I rarely equip it opting instead to buff my heavy weapons damage instead.
---
So there's your answer: Since there's not a specific perk for rifle wepon weight I use 3specific /* armor to reduce the weight for all weapons and instead use the weight savings and perk points to build a more well rounded character that can focus on rifles but can easily switch out to bigger guns when things get hairy.
---
Good one. Makes sense thanks.
---
$13 per month just for the private world is even more of a ripoff then. The Atom shop items are worthless.
---
Let Them try
---
NP. 
---
 I thought there was a patch note before the last meat week about not losing junk in public events, but I may be misremembering, and never verified it.
---
You can swap your cards around at any time.  I started doing this a few months ago to maximize what ever action I was going to do.  I swap my armour with weapons when I'm trying to craft or repair either.  If I'm in a vendor I change my "Lone Wonder" to what ever the better vendor prices card is.
---
It's kind of annoying and sometimes I forget, but it helps and you'll notice a difference.
---
First obviously means first class citizens. They are trying to incite class warfare to encourage more of us low class citizens to join the raiders when wastelanders arrives.
---
That'll be $20
---
I always had the feeling the amount of people in this sub is not actually real, considering the relatively low activity. There are subs with fewer people but much more active users. This can mean few things :
---
* The community is too divided, so the amount of upvotes/downvotes can't be taken as a proof in this case (probably not true but decided to include it anyway).
---
* People either have very little interest so they don't actively post, or they lost all interest but forgot to leave the sub (happens more often than you might think).
---
* Some of these people are bots, used mainly to upvote / downvote, since writing is hard and costs extra. Those guys in India know the price of their labor...
---
Each of these things can be true but the answer is probably some kind of combination between them. You just can't expect Bethesda to do things the right way anymore.
---
Thank you for being reasonable.
---
Upon reflection half of what I was said was fucking stupid, I out my point across wrong and shouldn't have commented so early in the morning, but I won't remove my idiocy because I was wrong, I'd rather leave it and learn.
---
Thanks man. This will definately come in handy with my build when I don't have to wear all of those perks while exploring!
---
Yikes, that would pack a punch!
---
I finished the first level, but nothing else has come up for me yet
---
You play on supernova? I've lost hours of gameplay just by dying. I'm at like 7 hours of playtime and I finally got my ship running. 
---
Nevertheless, they were stuck on small budget with the game. They said if reception is good, they'd make another one and implement the stuff they couldn't in the first. Plus Microsoft bought them.
---
Why is anyone still playing this game? Honestly, I'd love to hear from you...
---
Generally, carry 2 Rifles + 1 weapon that I'm experimenting with
---
The mobile gaming industry is even worse, but traditional gaming is getting there indeed. 
---
Got a friend working for a big Chinese mobile gaming company. Let's say he is good at making whales being whales...
---
I used to ride my 4wheeler over the ridge into Big Ugly lol.  
---
We also have a Miami, True, Friendly, Paw Paw, Pie, and War.
---
I noticed this only with the assultrons for some reason. Everything else seemed to VATs easily enough.
---
Are you saying the sub is full of thin men, Dr Valen?
---
How do you abuse it? I had more scrap than I could use *before* the sub. I stiil have to collect the scrap. You can't scrap weapons or armor at the tent and there are scrap benches *everywhere*.  
---
The psychology is being able to hoard without thinking about inventory management as much.   Because at this point the scrap box only benefits hoarders. 
---
But I'm not apologizing for people actually using pack rat...
---
fortunately you cannot stick this opinion of yours
---
You may have replied to the wrong post.  I was talking about problems with the time / money analysis of entertainment value--nowhere did I even mention boredom.  I had three main points:
---
1. Money/time treats all activities as either entertaining or non-entertaining.  All entertainment is treated as equally entertaining.  Quality of entertainment doesn't even factor in.  By that model, the best sex of your life is automatically inferior to playing solitaire by yourself if both are entertaining and the solitaire lasts longer.
---
2. Lingering entertainment also isn't factored in.  For some activities, the entertainment value lingers beyond the time of the actual activity.  This is obviously *very* hard to quantify, but should be noted.  Going out, meeting people, making friendships, and the like tend to have long-term payoffs.  Making great memories has longer-term payoffs.  In my experience, time-grind games have lower lingering payoffs (though can exist).
---
3. I was replying to a post claiming that Fallout's $.25/hr is an extremely good deal, one of the best around.  $.25/hr isn't actually that good if you look at the options on the market.  Don't get me wrong, it's better money/time than going to Disneyworld, but it's extremely easy to surpass that while gaming.
---
Ah yes, it‚Äôs just popular to hate on Bethesda *right now*. 
---
I keep hearing this and it‚Äôs just a stupid deflection of the real problem. Bethesda fucks up, tells everyone that it was a mistake, then fucks up again, and again, and again. 
---
-Released broken game
---
-Canvas bags turned into Nylon bags
---
-Says ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt afford canvas bags‚Äù
---
-Gets sued 
---
-Gives in and releases Canvas bags after 4-5 months of waiting
---
-Doss people trying to get their bag
---
-Bugs like *damage bug* which is game breaking don‚Äôt get fix for 6 months after release
---
But it‚Äôs just *popular right now*
---
I get what you‚Äôre trying to say. You can promise no one and Bethesda has any tied to the mods, but you can‚Äôt promise that they are not secretly active In the sub. 
---
I think it sounds stupid that they‚Äôd hire people to actively post on this sub and down vote posts, but what do I know?
---
Right! We paid for the game, give us the option to earn/pay for what gear we want. I‚Äôm sitting on over 4K atoms I earned in game over 600 hours and don‚Äôt ever see anything worthwhile in the store.
---
I'm not a fallout 1st member and I killed since the update 20 legendary scorched beast and it was going all well....... Oh wait the fallout 1st thing is a joke?
---
Nah played on hard. But I choose mainly persuasion and Engineering type skills so I got around so many hard things didn't even have to fight the final boss Ram or whatever he's called
---
Same!
---
Do you like paying the bills for people who disdain you?
---
In FO4 elevators acted more as hidden loading screens between floors ( which is why you'd see your character briefly disappear for a second on occasion.
---
Which is odd cause I‚Äôd swear 90% of the moaning comes from people that don‚Äôt play the game
---
I have seen Brand Ambassador listings for a lot of F500 companies, but I don't recall seeing many (or any) for gaming companies. Anyone here seen/been one for a gaming company?
---
Use your Microsoft account, you also get like 6 months of Spotify free if you don‚Äôt already have a Spotify subscription.
---
Petty children
---
I feel like at this point, people‚Äôs opinions on the game are more important to them than the game itself. So wrapped up in the online narrative of the game that it‚Äôs no longer about playing a game you like, or simply no longer playing a game they‚Äôre interested in.
---
Nice! I want the full suit but this will do :-) do you know if it counts as a costume for the event? I‚Äôm assuming it would but who knows
---
Seems pathetic to get pissed off at someone for buying something you don't support
---
Agreed, they are active in the sub they have their own tags, I worded my point badly. I meant in the running of the sub
---
agreed since....guns are kinda broke.
---
I played since day 1 of the stress tests and have about 700 hours total between a couple characters (different builds and beta didn‚Äôt complete achievements on Xbox).
---
The 1st subscription is actually pretty cool if you have friends that also play! I say this for a lot of reasons like:
---
Not having to worry about a high level one shotting the legendary at an event like uranium fever or camp fire tales... sorry but this literally happens way too much and screws everyone else over. 
---
Workshops... 2 fold here... enemies attacking have spawned 3* enemies so far each time. If you‚Äôre not great at PvP here‚Äôs your chance to get better doing it with friends!, win/win there. 
---
Exploring on your own... I like playing with friends but also like Fallout 4 type deal... it‚Äôs mind numbing which some people like, I‚Äôm hoping Wastelanders adds a lot to this. 
---
Now having 8 max people on a server with no one world hopping or duping or glitching... have to say it‚Äôs smooth... very smooth. I personally haven‚Äôt experienced a drop or lag yet unlike adventure mode. Seems there is always something but seeing camps pop up and leave a lot... I think it‚Äôs safe to say that is part of the issue. 
---
Bottom line... if you and your friends had fun that‚Äôs all that matters! Doesn‚Äôt matter about any opinions! 
---
Bethesda is a business and businesses are built to grow and make money... it‚Äôs not a non-profit. You either accept that or don‚Äôt buy games from a company that wants to make a profit. 
---
Ironically console users have to buy a premium subscription to play games after paying hundreds for the consoles... hmmm same crowd is quiet on that... lol
---
ok
---
You missed the rest of it.  Even if the outfit and other things aren't exclusive, you get them first, PLUS ~$15 worth of atoms every month (and you don't need to buy the early stuff, saving you a bit more).
---
I *highly doubt* that this is what they're doing, but even if they did, you're getting the items and atoms both for the cost.
---
Playing it with game pass, probably buying it when it hits steam.
---
I‚Äôm planning on getting borderlands 3 when it hits steam, too.
---
This "civil war" is about as overblown as the 1st pass itself.  It's all very "Many people are saying," and light on any real details.
---
The diffuser will help team when you use it if they‚Äôre close by. I‚Äôm building a medic character myself so working on those perks!
---
Oh dear god! Please dont let me attacked by a group of basement dwelling neckbeards in teddy bear outfits! 
---
Sorry and nice try. My pacifist mode and private world will keep me safe.
---
XP
---
I‚Äôve heard it described as bioshock meets borderlands meets fallout 76.
---
Just shoot the assaultrons w/o vats? Those are the only ones that have this problem and they give a big enough target anyways.
---
Interesting point about long term playability, I‚Äôd counter with not getting what you want also negatively effects long term playability. I‚Äôm more likely to play if I truly enjoy what I‚Äôm doing.
---
Three. A quad explosive .50 caliber hunting rifle,  a TSE lever action and a TSE combat rifle.
---
Are you?
---
Hey I was on Appalachia busy hunting scorched beast, bombarding cities with my multiple artillery canons that I gained by claiming workshops and then I see that on reddit someone congrats me.... THANKS :D
---
Ammo is used as currency. Most of the time it‚Äôs more preferred over caps.
---
It is! I‚Äôm trying to trade a BE for a JE handmade and it‚Äôs not going well.
---
much ado about nothing.. clickbait
---
I have no idea how you could grief someone in this game. Unless they shoot back nobody is doing any damage to anyone who doesn't want to engage. You can't damage their CAMP or their crap or anything else and at worst you could maybe call it harassment in which case you block them, log out and switch worlds. I don't see the problem. Yes Fallout 1st is dumb and lame and if you support that crap you may be dumb and lame too and I'm sorry you're getting bothered but just like any other other time you meet an in-game asshat, block, report, log out, switch worlds.
---
Same here. I have an RL friend that does this for a living, and he works for a major company. 
---
Another RL friend sells positive Amazon reviews. That's also very good money.... And free products.
---
You sure about that?
---
I personally don't like Gearbox after Randy Pitchford bait and switched me and many other with Aliens: Colonial Marines. I vowed never to give that company another cent despite being a major Borderlands. I kept my word and haven't since. If you don't like the game try having some principals and simply unsub from r/fo76 and phase it out of your life. It's really not that hard.
---
Me on the other hand enjoy 76. I don't care for Fallout 1st or it's perks, I don't care for a fridge, repair kits nor do I care to play on easy mode with an unlimited amount of scrap. I just log in from time to time with my wife, explore and unwind from a long work week. If the time comes where Bethesda hinders my game play I will quietly unsub and move on.
---
UwU
---
Missing the point. I‚Äôm not debating whether it‚Äôs a rip off or not. I‚Äôm speculating what is so 1st about it.
---
Sorry bro, ps4
---
Getting griefed is so easy to avoid in this game, and now that those peeps have their own private server, I don't understand the masochist that let themselves get griefed.
---
I am not sure, I kept my witch hat on hoping between the two I will still get the credit.
---
Maybe that's true but it sounds kinda like foil hat stuff... Personally I joined reddit because I was sick of reading everyones regurgitated opinion, decided to share my thoughts about the game. For one, I love F076 and have since launch. Like any hobby it can cost money, and as a grown man with income I choose to spend it on power armor helmets, atom shop crap, and Fo1st subscriptions, its my money so be it. Everyone spends money differently, and every business makes there money differently. All this boo hooing about corporate greed and how bad Bethesda is is so played out, get over it. I wish you keyboard warriors with your internet muscles would use you energy on truly evil companies that literally feed us cancer, endanger their workers, or damage the earth we live on.. No, we got NoobSlayer69 over here crying about a 10 dollar a month subscription that in turn gives you 16.50 worth of in game currency every month. If you buy atoms like I do its a no brainer, if you enjoy private questing and farming its a no brainer, helping a low level friend get started- no brainer, love to build useless camp crap all day and horde scrap- no brainer... If you dont, DONT BUY THAT SH!T MY GUY!! ...  "But it was promised!!, blah blah blah free free free!" Yeah I get it, I vote for Bernie Sanders too but I also own a business that provides for families, with bills... So yeah this was a fun rant, and if you're still not lovin' Fo76, then log off this darn computer and get outside for a nice game of stickball!!
---
 Here is a snickers üç´
---
You can get more than 110 damage with a non-legendary handmade. No bloody mess or chems required, either.
---
They're the new meta for pvp
---
I just got an ad for the Outer World's in this sub while scrolling so IDK man...
---
Yeah I get why everyone is upset,  but its a fun game and 13 bucks a month really is peanuts compared to the enjoyment it brings, and now with more stash space and better servers.... I dunno I don‚Äôt mind paying 13$ a month for a game I enjoy, especially with the stash space and private servers. its funny people used to say‚Äùman I would pay for a private server‚Äù and now there is that option. Im not arguing the morality,  but this game is great and enjoyable and its been out for a year now so its understandable that a company needs some income to keep adding new content etc
---
If that happened, new exclusive features would likely be added in place of those removed from the subscription, so it does not lose value. And there would be complaining about the new additions (imagine exclusive access to beta testing new content, for example). On the other hand, the subscription seems to have been inspired by ESO Plus, and that still has the crafting bag after years.
---
Hi, I was the player who asked the question, and u/Valseek did say one could wear a mask with PA.
---
HOWEVER, I tested this, and the power armor *does* ***not*** *provide the same amount of rad resist without the helmet*. You will receive *some* of the RR, but not all. Here are my recommendations if you're dead set on running the event in a nuked zone with a mask/hat:
---
1. PA + Rad Shield + Diluted Rad-X or Rad-X
---
2. PA + team with shared Rad Sponge perk (level 1 or higher) and Ghoulish (level 1 or higher, optional)
---
Good luck!
---
Grape mentats give you a boost of 3 I think and alcohol but the BEST way is unyielding armor
---
The best thing of this game is that you can change your build anytime. I know this isn't related to your problem but, I'll recommended you to test some perk synergies.
---
hunting, lever, handmade, fixer &amp; a shotgun for low lvl areas
---
If i remember right the Mr. Fuzzy Mascot Suit IS obtainable through the reward-vendor at the fair  where you get the mr-fuzzy-marks. Costs a shitload of marks though
---
Yeah I kept my witch hat on too! I just thought you had to have a full costumeü§î I still got the vault boy pumpkin from the event at 2 so I‚Äôm sure it counts
---
That‚Äôs a $300 tent lol. And firsters get a ton of atoms and other stuff.  Honestly it would make sense. Though I doubt this is the case unless their marketing really is that bad. They should have come out and said it.
---
Progression in this game is based on the shoot/loot cycle and the adrenaline of seeing what your legendary drop will be.  
---
If you don‚Äòt like shoot/loot I don‚Äôt know what would be left in this game if you just buy it.
---
I run 2 Xboxes and have dedicated Vendor characters that I keep on while I'm playing, from my experience Crafting, Sleeping or playing an instrument will only keep you on for 30 minutes, then a 2 minute countdown timer starts and you get dc'd.
---
Rubber banding your controller will keep your account active, but your character is likely to die from Dehydration and/or Starvation within about 30-40 minutes which will also start the 30 minute countdown.
---
I'm having the same issue.
---
Yup. We don't control the advertising. Reddit frequently takes money from advertisers who post things which would otherwise violate subreddit rules.
---
Agreed. I'd love for it to work properly, even just sometimes.
---
I'm the same way with skills. The only reason I'm playing supernova is so I don't fly right through it tbh. Figured I'd get my money's worth and enjoy what they gave us.
---
So far with the limitations I do see, I'm counting on #2 to be the big one. The characters models remind me of Elex while the environment color palette give a slight borderlands look imo.
---
being a fo76 fanboy (though on hiatus) it's honestly probably just us
---
Skeleton wearing armor like Hordak in the secret of the sword movie.
---
u/_synecdoche_ lots more info in this thread
---
Stupid ghouls.
---
I really try to be positive about this game but boy do they make it hard at times. Surely someone in testing should have gone something feels a bit off.
---
So dramatic.  Go play something else.
---
This is the best thing they have done in a while! Everytime I do the queen I get at least 1 but sometimes as many as 3, legendary scorchbeasts show up! They should have been like that the whole time tbh.
---
Bro ‚ÄúAt least 5 - 7 people in teddy bear costumes kept punching me," is HILARIOUS
---
If I nuke whitesprings for the Halloween event and wear my power armor will it still count as a Halloween costume? Because I want to get the xp
---
At some point Elder Scrolls Online started moving their outfits and lot of other cosmetics into lootboxes instead of letting you buy them without playing slot machines. They will probably bring that here eventually and just waiting for the right time.
---
Two is all I need. One instigating lever for rifle or one bloodied handmade for commando.
---

Most likely its body tp'd to its spawn location after you killed it
---
What is that source you're using, I've never heard of it before today.
---
It doesn't look reputable, and certainly isn't a professional blogger or anyone with any particular expertise in, well, anything.
---
WTF!! I have been out of the loop!! I haven't played in about 4-5 months.. When the hell did this happen!?? LL OO LL
---
Can anyone tell me what exactly the Plan: Mobster Jack O'Lantern unlocks ? Got it on my first round through the Event and used it but now i cant find it either in any of the craftingmnenus nor in the camp-decorations. Sorry in Advance and ashes on my head if it turns out to be something bloody obvious
---
A fool is someone who pays $60 for a game, believing that they will miraculously get new content and bug fixes.  Don‚Äôt you read the fine print?  You paid for exactly what you got, and they are not obligated to do another thing.  They can revoke your game license on a whim, and there‚Äôs not a thing you can do about it.
---
Now is it good for their reputation to do what has been done?  Obviously not.  But people who pay the sub did so knowing what they were getting.  It wasn‚Äôt some fluff promise blah blah blah.  People tend to mentally add things on their head that were never guaranteed anywhere.  Wishful thinking or foolish?
---
I'm not looking for a challenge, I'm happy feeling like an early Clint Eastwood character! :)
---
I guess rule #7 and maybe #8.
---
But with this sub? Who tf knows, there are so many posts that "go missing", it's become the Bermuda Triangle of reddit.
---
Good, I‚Äôll keep enjoying the game.
---
They don't mess around either!
---
Overalls, welding goggles, yellow hard hat with a pipe wrench. 
---
Yeah, you all know what that is.
---
wait why r u on this subreddit then :o
---
Yep that is my thinking. Kinda beta access to scrap box and travel tent. Next will be camp budget changes to test. Break it first, here‚Äôs your free shit before the rest pay extra for it.
---
I believe in Fallout Shelter the lootboxes were the iconic Fallout lunchbox. That is likely where the assumption is coming from.
---
I paid 60 dollars for eso.
---
I was thinking fall out mixed with low texture mass effect. But def reminds me of borderlands/RAGE 2 also

My heavy gunner carrys about 9 or 10 guns. My rifleman only carrys a handmade and a tesla rifle.

What I‚Äôm hearing is that while this gun may be shitty to me, other players running bloodied builds would be willing to pay big shekels for this thing. You‚Äôre a lifesaver bro.
---
I miss that menu. I hope they go back to it for Wastelanders.
---
True, but less work and more mayhem. More enjoyable than Meat Week, for me.
---
Yeah I call dibs on the swing set.
---
Absolutly uny all the way.think I have 6 base and that gets to 26 with a grape Mentats. Pretty sure cheapest price is capped selling price is 25, right?
---
I miss my deathclaw again now...as soon as patch 11 went live he just vanished....
---
That's funny coming from the same person who said Outer Worlds sucks, and that people are just pretending to like to piss off Bethesda/Fallout 76 fans.
---
No, I bought the base game for 12 bucks. Lmao I ain't buying this at full price

As far as I'm aware

Havent seen this yet.

Probably because if someone even starts being a dick, I jump to my private server so they cant bother me.
---
I just had some waste 5000 .308 and an LMG-42 on my tent. Pretty funny.
---
Someone did it in my world and yeah PA or rad suit so no costume. Didn't matter as with most new events we failed the event the first go around. Then the game froze üò°

Sometimes if you tp away it will follow you

Bethesda: Makes a new type of game they've never made before and tries to make a profit. 
---
BOOOO, GREEDY, JUST AS BAD AS EA, WORSE THAN A COMPANY THAT KOWTOWS TO A TYRANNICAL GOVERNMENT, WILL NEVER FORGIVE THEM. 
---
Rockstar: Extremely pay to win, creates slow and repetitive gameplay that encourages real money purchases, snuffs single player experience to solely focus on grind heavy online, waits a year to release on PC just to give Epic a yearl exclusive. Super fucking obviously only cares about the money. Forces ungodly work schedule on employees. 
---
They can literally do no wrong even though they do exactly what I accuse Bethesda of doing. Every slight forgiven. Will make multiple purchases on console and PC. Spend more money on online element. Will talk about how great the game is even though the missions are stale and repetitive but the cutscenes are good and the game is super memey. YUR ALRIGHT BOYAH.
---
lol that's because most of the people complaining did not even play the game. Some of them did. But many others did not
---
Blue screen?
---
i love this game and have a lvl 120+ character but i've been on hiatus and they're making it so hard to go back (took a break after people's accounts were bring wiped when entering vault 94 raid)
---
It‚Äôs a different game when no one else is one shouting everything. Even as that person, it‚Äôs still has its moments. Probably just my build though.
---
So, not only did you effectively justify Bethesda's decision to shaft everyone who purchased FO76 by buying their crap subscription....you then get rewarded by someone buying an actual good game for you.
---
In response to your edit
---
What exactly did you expect as a response? ‚ÄúOh my I didn‚Äôt realize I was such a horrible person, thank you so much for bringing to light all of my sins?‚Äù
---
I mean serious, what did you expect out of your post?  Do you think anyone here is going to feel bad from your ‚Äúscolding‚Äù?  Do you think that we are all going to turn tail and run away, or suddenly change our mind on things?
---
You got snarky responses because your post had no value.
---
I know it should be easy but I like to use an Instigating Exploding Black Power Rifle. The whole point there is the first shot should be the only shot.
---
&gt;Nobody got cheated, people got the service they payed for.
---
Never thought I'd read this line in a fallout 76 thread. 
---
I mean, if you paid to intentionally buy a broken, half-finished game and paid to be aggressively nickle-and-dimed to get access to features that solve problems Bethesda itself created...then yeah, you did get what you paid for.

\*Will shill for a free Fallout ~~FU~~ First sub.\*

You know how many husbands back their wives when they push Tupperware, makeup, or essential oils?
---
It's the same thing as one of these accounts.
---
Just like family businesses getting their family and friends to back them and say good things.
---
Always read the negative. Positive reviews can almost never be trusted.
---
I don't think I've ever played a game, and written a positive review
---
 If I like it, I like it so much I don't have time to review it. But if it's trash, I got all the time in the world to hate on it.
---
The official Bethesda account should say something but I feel bad for the community reps. If I was them I wouldn't post here either lol. I don't know what they could possibly say other than be punching bags for everyone. They don't control the decisions Bethesda makes. There isn't anything they could say that would justify the stuff everyone's mad about. I feel bad for them, that job must suck ass during times like this.
---
I‚Äôm not mad man. Please continue to sell you steel. We just have different ideas about the topic. Don‚Äôt you have a geometry test to study for or something?
---
So in my experience if the position isn‚Äôt out right called something like ‚Äúbrand ambassador‚Äù it would literally be some form of a public relations team effort either the companys PR team or they outsource to a PR company to handle their image. PR companies are HUGE in New York City and I imagine elsewhere in the US. The business / communications field is very broad and one title can encompass various responsibilities.
---
&gt;Internet connections don't just magically get faster to compensate

not one spot did i imply this, congratulations on picking up a 1 autocorrect typo. want a cookie for missing the entire point?
---
&gt;stream performance
---
this is gaming, not streaming.  on average games only use 350-750kb in a second. which means fastest connection (ping) is going to be more stable.  MB is irrelevant, a 15 ping 10mb line will always be more stable than a 200 ping 160 mb line
---
Yes,right after it launched.

I didnt see anyone say they created the sub, it said they are commenting and posting, Read the post before getting defensive

There should be an option in the floor decor for the pumpkins. Hit left or right to scroll to that one or one of the others you've unlocked.

This and a Kotaku report kind of read the same: "We can't verify that this is happening, but well, we're going to post it anyway."
---
I love Fallout. 76 I am not a bot and I wished Bethesda paid me to say this because I would play a game I like not "love" and pay for all the stuff they ask us to pay for. Boo hit me up on Xbox I ChicWitGame I.
---
Well I can't one shot everything. Not even close to that. What's your build, bloodied build?
---
I try to play as... well... the vault dweller, or the 76 dweller or however the protagonist name is, and as a vault 76 resident I need to be the best of the best in America so, the perfect build for this role is a handyman build.
---
its true. for the 1% that complain, the 99% just play. shit Im part of this subreddit and im thrilled to finally have stash space and private servers. 13 bucks a month for that, not to mention you get atoms anyways... I mean the game has been out for a year, cant expect new content to come out for free forever. 13$ is pretty fair. im pro #falloutfirst
---
Horse armor then creation club and now this. It's the same shit. I am enjoying watching this community set itself on fire. What will be left when the dust settles is of moderate interest.
---
What platform are playing on?
---
I carry 3; 
---
Anti-Armour Gauss Rifle, 
---
Anti-Armour Exploding Prime Lever Action Rifle, 
---
Mutants Exploding Handmade.
---
I like shotguns, the way they play with VATs and the crowd control they offer are convenient, but...I'm not gonna fuss if players want to campaign for a buff. Pistols, you have my condolences. Personally, I'd like to see some of the thematic weapon damage skills like "Cowboy" from New Vegas make an appearance, but it is what it is.
---
Yes, there is a new Halloween bundle and...actually this might help more:
---
That... literally is. 
---
What a great, educated mod team /s
---
Yep, the last 2 I've done had legendaries.
---
Can I ask, is the .50 cal hunting rifle better than the .308? Ammo isn‚Äôt an issue for me anymore so considering modding my trusty sniper.
---
Almost had a legendary dead on private server, game crashed. Came back to spot and it was just a basic ass SB.
---
Wait did it really get delayed?
---
I don‚Äôt get why you commented this. Why not make your own post?
---
Considering you cant use power armor at benches those sound like the perfect cards to temporarily remove
---
Oh lol did'nt know they dropped the price that much, sorry.
---
Hey dude
---
 The jerk store called
---
 They're running out of your face
---
About to start in five minutes again.
---
No. You just don't understand how much weight is behind buying shitty season passes
---
Codes reset today too so I would be careful. Nukacrypt codes won‚Äôt be good while they work on the new ones.
---
But isnt the point to cause mischief? Whats more mischievous than that?
---
My bad I thought you were for 1st, I didn‚Äôt read the post correctly.  I thought you were paid to call people shills not act as one.
---
No, as a Fallout 1st member, all your legendary kills spawn on my location.
---
If you spec for heavy weapons, a cryolator is just fine (but ammo intensive.) Also handy for SBQ, and...well, anyway. Try it in PVP sometime. Players struggle with no VATS and floored movement.
---
Well thing is the game is pretty much Fallout in all aspects. Its closer to Fallout 03 and Fallout: New Vegas than Destiny is to Fallout 04.
---
haha, Holy smokes man! Uh, I run a lever action rifle, and I carry that and the All Rise (two-handed melee). That's it. If it isn't .45 ammo, it goes in the vending machine or it gets dumped. 
---
For the recent Fallout games (3, 4, New Vegas, 76) I've generally found that there is an ebb and flow to the weapons. Early game, when ammo is somewhat rare, I'll keep and use anything that I can get ammo for. As I make caps in the mid-game and find out which weapons I like, I normally reduce my inventory down until I'm just using one type of weapon, with a melee weapon for the things that'll charge (feral ghouls, nasty critters) or not be worth ammo.
---
I stopped playing a month or so ago after playing solid since launch, 350 hours ish and only one account. I'm only still subbed here for news on Wastelanders, as that's the only thing I find interesting now. I just got bored, I've done everything in the game now. I've passed the 'angry at the state of the game' phase now. I do absolutely believe that there are accounts active though because.. well, the game has problems. It is, with objectivity, impossible to say the game is fine how it is. 
---
 I had a lot of fun exploring Appalachia, but Bethesda's behaviour has been disgusting since launch and somehow, after almost a year.. they keep getting things wrong. Whether that's Zeni's fault, who really knows. I won't be buying another of their games, at least on launch anyways.
---
And who is this guy?
---
hehe, "super mutant corpse of a title". Thanks for that.
---
I completely understand
---
I also know that they told us since last year that the private servers were going to be hosted by them, online always, and a charge.
---
I‚Äôm buying what they told me they would sell me last year.
---
Edit: that also doesn‚Äôt answer the question - what response is expected.  
---
you either have the ‚ÄúAgainst‚Äô‚Äú and all of you will just pat each other on the back for attacking the other side
---
and you have the ‚Äúfor‚Äù for lack of a better word who will just shrug it off
---
I think you should feel ashamed for your decision to pay for garbage. Your supporting tendencies that have slowly turned our wonderful games into interactive store fronts. We buy games because game play has traditionally been a way to engage the player in a story or challenge their abilities with mechanics. But game play  has largely been changed to sell us bottled water from our own tap. Its not to engage players for story or challenge but wear them out into paying for nothing. 
---
For w/e reason people just don't seem to see predatory behavior as easily when it comes to video games. It's not like a fast pass for a theme park where there is a real logistics issue getting 10k people on a ride that holds 40 at a time and takes 15 minutes to complete. Its like if you had to wait in line for 4 hours even when no one is front of you, and the ride is ready to go. Its 100% artificial value of the fast pass. The line is clearly moving in the wrong direction if you care about game play being unsullied by revenue mechanics. In order to make any dlc valuable enough to pay for, game play has to be designed to create that value, unless its extra content that you can only pay for.
---
I carry an instigating lever for big game and primary weapon. A .38 TS FFR combat rifle for small stuff and a vampires laser rifle for team stuff. And in the moment when I‚Äôm down fighting her majesty I rock a TS gauss rifle.
---
Bless you for making this comment. Assholes and trolls have to see that not everyone has to hate 76. This isn't a hate 76 sub. Its a sub for people who play the game. Some of those may love it, some may not. People have opinions.
---
It's indirectly related to Fallout, which is below the standard we enforce.
---
Yup, those guys are not as transparent as they think and are so full of shill, can smell em a mile away.
---
You generally won't need more than 2.  1 for long range (lever, gauss, .50 hunting rifle), and 1 for cqc like getting bum rushed by ghouls (handmade, fixer, combat rifle).  
---
If you get a god tier handmade or fixer you can easily get by with just 1 gun for all the things.  This simplifies everything as you only need to worry about the 1 ammo type unless your long ranger shares ammo with your cqc gun.
---
Snuffs single player experience? How? Unless your talking about sp dlc. 
---
I'm not defending GTA:O and agree it's extremely pay to win. I hate it and never go on it. Same as RDR2:O
---
My point was GTA5 and RDR2 still had imo fantastic immersive single player campaigns. 
---
So despite the greed and monetization of the online aspects my point was you still get a quality single player game.
---
I did get exactly what I wanted, a scrapbox that I can keep filling forever.
---
They absolutely did not fuck me over though, it was entirely consensual when I hit the buy button.
---
I would highly suggest unfucking your own brain right out of this weird place where you tie your emotions to what other people do with their money before you wreck yourself
---
 Fallout 76 is the biggest scam I ever suffered in 30 years of gaming. Their total lack of respect towards the fans is mindnumbing. Whats even worse, I convinced two friends to buy it as well during launch, at least one got a refund (the other one is still mad at me). There is just one thing I am sure: I will NEVER again spend a dime in any game that has Bethesda name on it. Worth saying I actually bought two copies myself so double screwed compared to the regular scammed players (bought the CE and a digital copy because my CE would take months to reach me).
---
I‚Äôve crashed during the early part with cars exploding. Other than that nothing else.
---
&gt;Without VATS the games combat system is exposed for how broken and dated it really is. 
---
That's not really quite that true. There are plenty of people who don't enjoy VATS, either thinking it's underpowered (and thus never making it more powerful, leaving it further underpowered) or just prefer the manual shooting.
---
Do you know if the armor I have on, in terms of defence etc. will be invalid when I equip my power armor?
---
I don't discount that this happens.  But anyone who has anything positive to say about the game is not necessarily a paid PR shill and it is utterly ridiculous to think so.
---
I didn‚Äôt read it correctly, I‚Äôm in agreement with OP and you
---
The Outer Worlds would need to be bad to be compared to Fallout 76, thats for sure.
---
If you don't like it step away and stop whining then.
---
look at your reasoning. someone with a different opinion and you try to pull the ol ‚Äúmust work for bethesda‚Äù. those are weak schoolyard tactics man, enjoy the downvotes
---
Just... Go to first better mob and wait for death. Preferably near your camp
---
What if I told you that Reddit is not representative of any community as a whole?
---
Can you just jump off a high place and lose the wanted level right? Because I would try that on the landview lighthouse.
---
A beauty place btw
---
Flying brahmins.
---
Community managers have conveniently returned
---
Nah, I just fast travel out. But I  always pop a  glowing blood pack, Rad-X diluted, and Radshield before a queen fight.
---
That should be considered abuse, companies that do that have no shred of a moral fiber, they don't care if the person is addicted or have been through depression and is doing some bad decisions, they just see the bottom line.
---
that is the soiled version but yes. Its like 150 and 300?
---
Each piece has a 50% chance to revive you, when you're downed. Arguably better than bolstering with bloodied, YMMV. Life saving only, autostims aren't awesome for bloody, unless you run 50% health, I guess.
---
For those items, yes, but from a marketing perspective, it is very smart.
---
The whitesprings usually has someone there or go to a public event
---
Because it‚Äôs not peer to peer.  Stop spreading wrong information.
---
If you're on Xbox post on Official Group. Someone will be by in seconds.

You could msg someone or wait to some to FT to vault 76

Lol
---
"Suck up as much money as possible from the player base and work your employees to death. As long as I can get realistic horse genitals we're good"
---
This really just sounds like more clickbait for the latest round of youtube view stoking. 
---
Gaming has a problem in that there are a ton of really bad reporters trying to grab easy bucks by amplifying this bullshit.
---
I love fallout and plan to return back to 76 eventually. It‚Äôs also a great way to see the haps with Bethesda.
---
I wouldn't have bothered responding to the crying, incessant pointless crying, about private sessions, either. The response was one of the most childish ridiculous things I've seen from any fan base.
---
The real question here is why the fuck does this thread even still exist?
---
This is pure shit stirring, someone is pissed off that the riot over Fallout 1st crumbled without much fanfare just like every single other time Bethesda adds something innocuous to the game that people will swear will be the last straw this time.
---
This thread breaks multiple sub rules in accusing people posting here of being fake Bethesda accounts.  It's far from civil, it's pure rumor/conspiracy theorizing and it's trying to start a witch hunt where people should be criticizing others for having the gall to post anything positive that they believe "distracts" from complaining about Fallout 1st.
---
people actually stop playing games when they say they will but go ahead and cope however you want
---
Im level 24 or something like that can i get that armor yet
---
That is OP indeed.
---
Had this happen to me yesterday with my first Mothman I've ever gotten to run into. Soon as it died, body fell through the Earth or something. 
---
I'll never get that wing at this rate.
---
True :')
---
I still say they should just make the Scrap Box public or just keep it to the private servers if the 1st members have to have this special add on. It's still a bad advantage to other players who can't throw 13$ a month or a $100 at the moment for a year.
---
That's my only complaint, everything else I can care less about.
---
My game is freezing a lot and taking forever to load in. Like 5-6 minutes.

Can we go back to having fun yet or are we still bitching about this?

I‚Äôve seen a few accounts like this with more feel good posts, all either made in the past few days or just started posting the the past few days. It‚Äôs a bit suspect to me since who the hell would jump on the ship now with all the negative press it‚Äôs getting?

Ofc it‚Äôs more than likely real people. But I really wouldn‚Äôt put it past Bethesda..

&gt; Many people are saying,

The Trump strategy

3rd Edition: game crashed in the first phase of the event. Had to load into a different server.
---
I can't find rhino card anywhere and cant remember them but looking up wiki they released the shark card in dec 2013....it said those were the first cards...and then the megadolon card was released in March 2014...I knew something was released later just couldn't remember
---
&gt;  if there was more content
---
More than the bugs and shady practises I think this is what turned people of the game (naturally I would as that's the camp I'm in).
---
Paid dlc would be fine, 6 months ago I would have bought it. Hell maybe even 3 months ago. I haven't put any money into the game outside buying it. Besides quest dlc I don't do micro-transactions - I'm not an mmo player and I think a decent proportion of the  playerbase were in the same camp too, this being their first quasi-mmo I don't think they're used to games asking you to reach into your wallet for anything other than main-quest level add-ons.
---
Game has one hell of an identity crisis. Right now it's a radiant event fest/shop for whales/sunk cost fallacy. RPG players have had no new narrative content for a year, the survival/murderer set have lost survival (and kind of had their fun taken out of it when it was moved to a seperate mode) and no-one bought this to play a battle royal.
---
Someone should be watching youtube and how gamers react, because that is where most of this is coming from.
---
They fixed that in last Thursday‚Äôs patch
---
Personally, I think most aspects of Fallout first are dumb but I don't think private worlds are all that unreasonable to have to pay for, I mean that would be a lot of extra servers to run.
---
1st I am one always totally against griefing. 2nd this is set up to be a multiplayer game with pvp. 3rd there is next to nothing you can do to grief people in this game.  That all being said, I am totally griefing people that have 1st! I won't even say how as to not ruin it, but even I know it's stupid as hell and I'm waisting my time. I'm so appalled people would pay this and feel like I'm protesting and they are crossing the picket line. I say hey don't like it? Go play in your own stupid private session if i bother you.  
---
I'll grow up and give up soon enough and honestly cant understand why I'm so worked up about it. I talked to one guy who bought it just for all the atoms and I could respect his purchase. I'm trying to understand why others would buy this. I said enough , now I'll wait for the hateful replies
---
You mean to tell me FO76 filthy casuals aren‚Äôt just Bethesda reps talking to each other? /s.  Joking aside, I absolutely agree with you
---
I can only imagine how much easier it is to mine salt in this game nowadays...
---
That is interesting and adds validity to the fact it could be possible. Do I believe it is happening here? It seems a bit crazy. It's not an Amazon product and there's no way to rate the game "5 stars" as it were. This Reddit signal boosts whatever the emotion of the day is and it's hard to bruteforce that into happening with fake accounts I would think. These posts live and die in a matter of 1-2 days as well so it's not like you can get any particular thing to stick for long periods of time. They would probably get more bang for their buck with Op Ed pieces (something political parties do all the time) and by having people stream the game on Twitch or something.
---
I comment on a fair amount of threads because I find the mentality frustrating. When people start saying anyone posting anything positive must be a shill that's like saying you aren't real if you actually like the game. It's an offhanded dismissal that you basically aren't a person and that because you disagree with their experience you must be fake or getting paid.  
---
Side note: I tried finding some job listings for brand related stuff for Bethesda/Zenimax but nothing seemed readily visible
---
it's actually by people that wasted their money
---
Yeah, but if you are like me and pick up super heavy items for junk, fast traveling is impossible. I can carry over 600 lbs in my excavator, and even then I still get encumbered.  If I just drop the tent, I can use the scrapbox and move on to the next thing. It‚Äôs a huge advantage.
---
‚Äúthe adults will move on without issue‚Äù. for every 1 person complaining, 99 others are happily playing. a small amount of people on reddit just think that what they say is some sort of law. fine, move on then you will not be missed. go bring your negative attitude to another game because the majority of fallout players still enjoy the game and probably don‚Äôt mind 13$ a month... I mean the game has been out for a year, do you expect free content to made for this game forever?
---
Damn, I only paid ¬£10 if I remember correctly.
---
I'm tapping out, fuck this game, I'm done.
---
*(to myself)*
---
Breathe... breathe... ok.
---
**Seriously?!** Don't jump to conspiracy, this happens on about every major release that has backlashing content, **People Come out in Full Force** against it... then they eventually stave off and go back to what they enjoy.
---
I don't think there is anything wrong with that, but have you played the game during the "lull" periods? It's ridiculously pleasant and some of the most wholesome stuff I've ever experienced.
---
Plus, many people*(myself included)* were recommended to go to this sub back in the day if they actually enjoy the game, so when it blows up with hate, those people are still here, just a quiet minority. When the moment of reaction passes, what's left are still people who just play the game, and it's not a shocker they like it if they stay through some of the terrible decisions that have been made. 
---
Which makes sense why wholesome posts are "coming back", people who don't like the decisions being made aren't going to stay here, they're going to go do the things they enjoy.
---
I recall fast travel in this doesn‚Äôt get stopped by being over encumbered, so you can just go to your camp anyway, and in a private server it works better because enemies don‚Äôt respawn so quickly
---
I had a rotation of about 15 guns. Kept 6 - 8 on me at a time. And weapon and ammo weight reduction armor to help with that. 
---
Anti armor and a Vampire Handmades, instigating lever, Anti armor and vamp plasma, and two shot revolver rifle was my typical go to load out. Had other variations of those rifles I rotate in as well. Mostly furious, anti armor, vampire, two shot, executioner, and medics.
---
Or are you the funny one wasting 100 dollars on a buggy incomplete game? Or how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
---
Hadn‚Äôt happened to me. I guess some were, and they fixed it.
---
Im happy for private servers and more stash space, and I have no problems with 13$ a month to support a game I enjoy.
---
I got it when it came out. Bought it for my brother also. Definitely was full priced game at launch.
---
You definitely can‚Äôt fast travel while encumbered in FO76.
---
r/nocontext
---
but the rewards arent that good. sadly not worth the redownload
---
And some guys shitalked me for talking about that.
---
You get access to tons of new regions with ESO+ plus a bunch of bonus content and crowns. ESO+ has value beyond in game advantages, it has content that could also just be permanently purchased if you require it.
---
ESO is a finished game that never made promises to their community about ‚Äúcosmetics only‚Äù etc.. 
---
It‚Äôs a false equivalency. We haven‚Äôt had any major content drops since the scouts. With all the changes in the past year the amount of content released is less than 15% of the first ESO DLC.
---
Why bother? I got mine back when you could get them from SBQ, and I basically traded one high end item for all serum recipes. You can still buy duped serum recipes online too. And the last option - just buy the serums you need from someone. Only costs a few thousand caps. We're only limited to 5 character slots, so it isn't like we need to use them all the time.
---
Hey, man. You did the best you could with this. Well done, even if everyone is too angry to realize the point you're trying to make.
---
If they have certain mutations that cause damage, all ppl have to do is keep hitting until it procs and that engages the pvp.
---
PS4.
---
Better to say nothing than something stupid.
---
Been awhile since I have done it myself, most of the time there is a bench or some kind nearby to scrap junk down to lower weight, I‚Äôm more function than anything and try not to grab everything unless I really need to.
---
Just remember to stash your junk first, you dirty criminal.
---
Oh no guys it looks like you agitated a Liberator.  Better watch out.
---
Nah ammo conversion workbench is coming first I reckon. Pay to skip the grind for ammo, only 7 bucks in the Atom Shop!
---
I was suggesting something like this months ago, as someone who has been playing with dedicated vendor characters for quite a while, I have an abundance of Caps with nothing to spend them on. I also have multiple characters full of 3\* Weapons &amp; Armor, Plans, &amp; Aid, which I seldom keep on because I am cap maxed across many characters. I max Scrip daily with 3 characters, and have a mule that holds excess scrip that is frequently pushing the Max weight limit.
---
More reasonable in-game cap sinks, as well as a limit increase on daily Scrip is needed, but I'm not sure if adding Rare items to the Vendor Pool is a good Idea, they did this with PA plans and it screwed many who had worked very hard to acquire them before so they could provide crafting services, but it did significantly lower the value of Modded PA.
---
I sense narcissism, arrogance, or a lack of self awareness here. Or all three..? When is the last time you spent time in introspective thought?
---
Based on the amount of people with scrapboxes it was a success
---
My bad about the boring part, I think I mixed that up with another comment I was reading. My statement still stands though. It's hard to listen to a person complain about a lack of content in a $60 game after 400 hours of play is all I'm saying. And from what I have been seeing it's largely long term players lobbing criticisms at 1st. That's the overall message of my original post.
---
Maybe I have a different view of this game since I waited until this past April to pick it up. I didn't suffer through the tumultuous launch like many of the contributors to this board so I have had almost zero negative experiences in game. In the (now) 160 hours I have logged I have only seen a blue screen twice. The only times I've been kicked from a game world have been because of a screw up with MY internet connection. I've experienced more than a handful of bugs, but I also remember having to save before entering or exiting any interior in FO3 because of the risk of save corruption.
---
To me everything that was available from 76 before 1st is worth the launch price of $60 and that's why I don't have a problem with it (or anything in the future) being an extra cost.
---
I dont believe you
---
Thanks for that.
---
They‚Äôre not
---
imho that's the absolute worst weapon to use for that event because of the amount of mobs and the fracking reload time.
---
That they do not.
---
What about power armor plans? I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt have all those yet. That‚Äôs probably another 60k right there to dump.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Just had this happen and I lol‚Äôed. Very mischievous.
---
This is a very good example. Only one post that happens to have enough upvotes to trend high in the sub, and only comments in FO76. the best part about working in PR / advertising / marketing is that you can deny deny deny without sufficient proof against you. In this case the possibility could go either way- shill account or someone who just happens to post 1 time and get over 1,000 upvotes and only comment positively in the FO76 sub then never use their reddit again.
---
A while ago there was datamined skins models of liberators that took the place of other robots heads.  It was a long while back but it was definitely official as they locked on to every one.
---
Don't encourage shitty business practices because you want to take part in it and then justify it by saying it's "keeping the lights on."
---
This is why before I purchase a product I don't look at the 1 star or the 5 star reviews - I look at the 3 and four stars.  
---
I have almost no bad luck with this method.
---
I‚Äôm a big ammo farmer, and there definitely isn‚Äôt a convenient bench to where I gather my barbells for lead.  I used to have to walk for 5+ minutes to the nearest train station to scrap.  
---
Also a bench alone only decreases weight so much.  You need a convenient stash (or scrapbox) too.  The tent does this.
---
I‚Äôm a camp decorator so I love them!
---
Shoot a robot at WS?? Or take 2-3 workshops... lol
---
I sell them for 15 caps per, GT is AbraxoBrand
---
Can always go to the Charleston fire station, they have a work out room full of barbells.
---
TAOGTPOT
---
Hot take: I don't want the DLC or ANY content for free. I want the game itself. The source code. The server tools.
---
Those of us still here all payed at least $60 for the game, they made their profit. Now I want it to die, so Bethesda doesn't make a single dollar more from the game. No maintenance costs, no development costs. Go put all those devs on ES6 or something, or go out of business for all I care. Please, STOP developing it. Just give it to us, so we can do it better.
---
The 'freeloading' Bethesda community has proven time and time again that it can make games better than they can.
---
5, but as a separate "seasonal" type of mode. Everyone starts from scratch. Add in factions and faction warfare. You can choose to remain neutral, but forgo amazing rewards if you do. Rebalance legendaries / damage and armor.
---
Whitesprings station for sure always people there, you sometimes just have to emote at people with the pvp and love heart emoji and they usually get what you mean
---
I like GTA but they actually release pay to win content. The oppressor is unfuckwithable and would take a week of 6-8 grinding sessions to get. Also the private lobbies limit what business missions and events you can run and you can only play with one friend. 76's "pay to win" items aren't even necessary, that and they actually give you a lot of atoms. Lol you can't even compare these games even though I like em both.
---
Yeah, I go to lots of different spots every day.
---
So, Fallout 4.5? :D
---
Only got to play new vegas recently (last year) and I think Dead Money was terrifying! Better horror game than many horror games.
---
Bethesda dont care how polished the game is. If came out a buggy mess, and its stayed that way. One bug gets fixed, two more pop up, and an old one comes back.
---
Whatever reason wastelanders got delayed for, i doubt it was to polish it up.
---
Pretty sure its really all rng. Just less of a saturation at low levels imo.
---
Hope you dont subscribe to any game at all ever.
---
Wait for it... This is such a Hot Topic!
---
Ha! I slay me
---
Rooftop rumple was 25k on hard.
---
You seem angry. Was The Outer Worlds too easy or not up to snuff? The fact that you are judging me for enjoying a game I love is pretty low. Sorry I‚Äôm doing what I want with MY own money. 
---
PayPal me some of YOUR money and I‚Äôll gladly do with it you say. 
---
For the public record I‚Äôve spent 10$ a month since launch and just now have gotten monthly Fallout 1st. 
---
Regardless of that 
---
So long and thanks for all the fish ‚úåÔ∏è
---
OP won't respond to this or acknowledge it
---
If thats accurate then its exactly what I was hoping for when purchased my 10 years in subscriptions.
---
The blogger appears to be some average person pretending to be an gaming industry insider.
---
 Probably is friends with the janitor at the BGS Austin office, and pays him to sift through the trash bins.
---
It's even funnier how you wasted $100 on a broken service for a broken game. Not sure which is the bigger loss, yours or theirs?
---
People liking the game is not an opinion it's a fact
---
 Make sure your perks are in place.
---
I believe the dataminer AMA last month suggested the event gives rewards based on a tier system. The tier that can reward the diffuser plan is unlocked only if all three animals survive.
---
Dark god?  More like a self entitled, salty, bitter, arrogant legend in your own mind.
---
Flux can go in the scrap box, as long as what you‚Äôre putting in can‚Äôt be broken down further then I can go in. Skulls can‚Äôt go in unless broken down to bone shards for example. Bulk junk also must be broken down manually to go in.
---
Thank you, it's been a weird day lmao
---
1000000% Sure they were.
---
Did you read the part where I said I was wrong about 7 times or
---
I throw in my lever rifle too but ultimately it's about what is enjoyable. It's satisfying to one hit kill things and see huge damage numbers displayed.
---
The 4 graphics kinda suck lol
---
It's funny cause ~$13 for private worlds alone seem to be about industry standard.  Its certainly in line with a WoW subscription during its early years.
---
Possibly a Chinese New Year update.
---
I'll pat you on the back my guy üòè
---
Awesome :) I'm glad I'm not the only one, you're exactly the type of player that I was hoping this would help.
---
As for the Vendor items, I intend for them to be brand new outfits, only available at the Vendor. I agree that adding the rare outfits that are only obtainable from events to the vendor pool would cause an issue. If they are brand new and only available there they won't effect the existing value of rare items. :)
---
Yes, fights do appear to have gotten harder. 
---
This was very noticable on last nights Queenie fights.  The # of adds that spawned were overwhealming, We dropped her both times but it was a difficult fight to say the least.
---
Lots of adds, lots of big adds.  We had several hermit crabs, gulpers, deathclaws, fog crawlers ect all spawn over and over.  On one fight I saw no less than 6 hermit crabs.
---
Thank you for this, it makes a lot more sense now
---
Because it's not happening
---
People hate the game is also a fact. Thanks for the downvote scrub
---
I believe its every hour
---
That's what I thought it would be which would probably see it coming out around the same time as the wastelanders content
---
Bethesda always sucked. People are just feed enough to stop ignoring that fact.
---
Unfortunately when this shit happens we leave them up for people to vent and calm down, if we removed every thread like this it would keep the hornets buzzing
---
I would be happy to buy the scrap box with atoms as a one time purchase instead of it being locked behind a subscription.
---
Hey man, someone has to speak the truth around here.
---
You're not stupid either way but I think they're in floor decoration
---
 Alright. I have done that and thought I'd mention it. If you have crafted etc, some might have been removed. Also that many percent, just makes me doubt you. ;)
---
Fallout goes dark souls
---
Thank you I appreciate the kind words
---
Definitely a plot point soon, a while ago I saw some files that had the models and texture of it them being locked onto other robots heads
---
Will test against this when I get the chance to
---
I wish I could be as blissfully stupid as you.
---
"It's 12.99, you don't need to buy the whole year"? Are you dumb? You know 13 per month after a year costs *more* than $100 right?
---
"Bethesda is trying their best guys!" Yes, I'm sure this has been pushed back for totally honest reasons. F76 was already released as a barely functional beta, but you're right, they're probably trying really hard to make the free dlc content perfect!
---
You obviously need to be told this clearly: *Don't get into the van just cause they offer you candy*. Just a word to the wise, as you appear to lack all critical thought and believe anything you're told.

Fallout has always had a clunky combat system whether people enjoy it or not is separate from whether or not it is buggy, which it is. In previous entrys VATS was a major help in hiding how clunky the combat system can be, but since it's in real time it exposes it again. At launch it hardly even worked jumping from 90% chance to hit to 1 or 2% chance to hit within a matter of milliseconds despite you not moving barely an inch or two at a time. Can't speak for how it is now as it's been a few months since I played it.
---
Yeah it didn't last for long because they changed the payout and it wasn't easy..that was the main grind over and over and over
---
Yeah and if you don't like Fallout 1st you're just a hater or too poor or whatever. Nuance and reasoned debate are dead right now.
---
Sorry I was writing fast üòÇ
---
But yeah I had all my perks on. And my resistance is 224 damage 115 energy and 10 radiation
---
I have all the useful ones, and even some of the really rare ones (ultracite jetpack, ultracite emergency protocols, ultracite calibrated leggings, all base plans for T-60, T-51, etc.). There are a few that just aren't useful for any builds so I didn't buy them. But I have 2 accounts maxed out with 125K caps each. I guess now they aren't maxed, since it went up to 35K per character instead of 25K, but still, I have 250K caps and 200K+ ultracite .50 cal ammo that I could sell at a 1:1 ratio for caps. Also have 500 stable violet flux and thousands of every type of scrap. All I did for the first 6 months or so of Fallout 76 was amass wealth and power. My main is level 400+ and I have 4 other level 70+ toons with completed builds. I run two accounts at once and leveled a mule to 60 purely to get 15 charisma on it and give my main 5/5 Adrenaline perk for free by sharing it, to further min/max my char. I think people underestimate how far power gamers can take things.
---
I concur with a lot of your points.
---
Here's the post I wrote a couple of weeks ago:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/df3k3f/armchair\_economic\_analysis\_and\_possible\_solutions/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/df3k3f/armchair_economic_analysis_and_possible_solutions/)
---
The only one i found there is the free one from the atomic shop.
---
Lol, about what I expected. I don't know why you bring up outer world's, I'm not playing it at all. I enjoy the game too, I don't enjoy being lied to by the company, and play an inferior version unless I pay. You are the base of people that I can understand would buy this - you already buy monthly atoms. I totally fine with that. I guess I was just surprised how many people actually did that. I'm content getting 100 or so atoms every week from challenges and getting some stuff when they go on sale.
---
It happens on the hour in real time, so 24 times per day.
---
Neither? It‚Äôs MY money. And I‚Äôll do with it what I please to do. Sorry you followed the sheep and seem to hate those that did buy Fallout 1st. 
---
You judging me isn‚Äôt going to stop me from enjoying what I love.
---
I actually enjoyed to loneliness because I truly felt that I might be the only one left, it‚Äôs one of the reasons I love FO. It for the first time felt like a real survival game to me.
---
Someone else commented on this post which I hope gets upvoted a lot- that just because someone posts something nice about the game doesn‚Äôt automatically mean they‚Äôre a shill account. I think that‚Äôs very important to note. 
---
Many people post here, and in other forums asking if they should get the game still, and Bethesda salvaging their image could make them money in the long run by convincing their audience the game isn‚Äôt as bad as it seems. 
---
To give some further insight on your job posting comment- in my experience if the position isn‚Äôt out right called something like ‚Äúbrand ambassador‚Äù it would literally be some form of a public relations team effort either the companys PR team or they outsource to a PR company to handle their image. PR companies are HUGE in New York City and I imagine elsewhere in the US. The business / communications field is very broad and one title can encompass various responsibilities. So if they outsource their work you wouldn‚Äôt directly see it, and there‚Äôs also a possibility of the responsibility being given to some other title.
---
go get some marshmallows and shut up then.  Enjoy it in silence.
---
the video posted in another thread shows a 15 minute timer on the event.
---
and
---
the event starts on the hour, so depending on how long it takes to complete the event and gicen given its going to take you some time to loot the bodies then get to your stash box....
---
I'd say you have about 30 minutes "free" time between events
---
Okay shill
---
All I got from this post is wastelanders will be "pretty friggin amazing" and that Bethesda has more money to make it even better
---
you should be

People have been mentioning rubber banding your controller, just be careful with that you may end up with a permanent 'stick drift.'
---
Cry me a river.
---
Felt like it a few times.  Damn cave crickets come out of nowhere in the bog.
---
Time to quit this terrible game
---
Apparently a lot of people are fine with what the company did. Also apparently some people think the Earth is flat.
---
What's funny is many anti-f1st posts are by people who do not play the game and so can be considered disingenuous astroturfers. It's okay I know this probably won't get a reply. F76 is just being used by the gaming community at large to "wage war" on microtransactions
---
It does.  Your PA replaces whatever armour you're wearing, which is why people often have different sets of PA.  Each variant offers different types of protection.  X-01 for example has the best Rad-resistant but lower Dmg-resistant.  T-60 has a higher Dmg-res than the X-01 but a lower Rad-res.  
---
Wearing PA is where chem usage and perk cards come into play.  Equipping the proper perk cards to lessen disease or damage from certain attacks.

Go. away.

Sure, go on mate, don't let me stop you from enjoying Bethesda's spitting on you while you keep paying them to do so. Hehe
---
Usually happens when you play pip boy games too long... I‚Äôm fucking hilarious
---
Funny how many people complain over something that they could just walk away from or just stop playing. I love the game and love to play. It isn't stable and I agree that it can be annoying. However, it is fallout and I can play with others! I enjoy the ability to help others, go on a killing spree, or just forage for items. I play daily and will continue. I do not spend money on atoms and will not. That is a choice I make.
---
Doesn't mean it didn't exist. Literally every patch has bugs.
---
Come at me bro.
---
I knew for a fucking fact businesses did this shit.
---
Some of the crap that I read defending the practices, products, or services of companies can only be spout straight from the horses ass, i.e. their marketing grunts.
---
Same issue. I was able to do the first 250xp challenge and the next isn't showing.
---
And you‚Äôll be able to in time, just my thinking. And then you won‚Äôt have the disappearing scrap issue either since it‚Äôs already been fixed based off of 1st testing.
---
After looking into it a little, it seems like a wannabe blogger that really just occasionally posts hit pieces about whatever game he's interested in at the time.  And it's all YouTube levels of 'screaming about stuff to get attention' as far as I saw.
---
At least I'll know to ignore anything that quotes them (and watch to fill in the blanks and see if we can figure out which of the site's alts are shilling for the site).
---
It isn‚Äôt a reward it‚Äôs an example of a costume you can wear
---
Why? People like you are what turn online games into trash.
---
I'm not the biggest fan of fallout 1st but leave people alone and let them play the game. Jeez.
---
They're next to the row of pumpkins I think
---
Got what I wanted. Have no problems with it. In fact I'm getting a lot more legendaries now than I ever did. I got 3 bloodied weapons last night alone although they were not that great. I'm enjoying the hell out of it so far and getting my money's worth easily. Can't wait for tonight. I don't get picked over locations anymore and I enjoy doing events with friends without some guy 1 shoting every legendary that comes along. We all make sure everyone gets a shot on every legendary. Unless something stupid happens I'd sign up for another year. I enjoyed the game before but now it's even better.
---
did you expect civil discourse in response to an outright hate flame?
---
No, you act an ass and the other side acts an ass back. 
---
If you shoot at me.  I shoot back, I dont offer you tea and crumpets.

16 times the monetization

That's why we have been told to write positive 3 star reviews.

Still a scrub tho

'Ill have a Samual Jackson.'
---
I messaged you buddy. Thanks!!
---
Yeah it‚Äôs been happening to all my friends they lag out and are raging
---
Fallout First should have entailed:
---
Free Exclusive Unique Outfit every month (Ranger Armor for this month, maybe something like Ant-agonist Armor next month)
---
10 free scrap kits and repair kits every month
---
1650 Atoms every month
---
10% off every item in the Atomic Shop
---
Exclusive emblems and emotes
---
Exclusive non-gameplay affecting camp items.
---
Exclusive test servers to test future DLC content.
---
The Second CAMP and the Scrapkit are really the only things in 1st i am against.
---
I am absolutely terrible at games so in this case you are factually correct
---
Oh stop it bro, You ain't doing shit
---
That's an odd way to paint everyone who disagrees with you as a flat earther... but ubu.
---
Rofl, if that were the case filthy casuals wouldn't be such a tiny sub, not to mention this sub is more pro this game than the general public is. So its more like for every 1 happy player there are 100 unhappy.
---
That's a great policy to have... for a thread that is based on a constructive criticism of the game where you don't want to stifle someone's valid point of view.  But how in the ever loving fuck is a thread claiming that people posting here are Bethesda sock puppets a constructive conversation?  It's pure shit stirring, rumor mongering paranoia and is practically begging that people go and troll anyone that they suspect is too positive to be real.
---
‚ÄúSales much larger than expected‚Äù these people are called adults. They don‚Äôt care about how Bethesda does things because it‚Äôs so low on the totem pole on things that are actually important. My jeep payment per month is enough to pay for 3.5 years of fallout 1st.
---
Nooooooooooooo. Oh bugthesda, you did it again :(
---
super laggy; didnt freeze but threatened to constantly.
---
Switch away! That‚Äôs the great thing about the card system, perks are very flexible.
---
It's honestly not far from the norm for a private instance.  A CoD server hosts for 10 players runs around 10USD / month, and those shouldn't have a fraction of the server side load.
---
Granted value is highly dependent on the person/group if they use it much.  Six or so.months ago when I was still real active I wouldn't have hesitated.
---
Three times so far without a problem though there‚Äôs a lot going on and some lag in the most intense moments (Xbox). What platform are you on?
---
Yeppppp. Really badly as more players are jumping online.
---
Oh ok. So it‚Äôs not just me then. Hope they fix it soon. The event is fun. I wanna get all the plans unlocked.
---
The post does none of those things, and a mod has commented (stickied?) about the whole situation.
---
If you find individual posts that break the sub's rules, by all means report them.  It's been my latest hobby here for a day or two.
---
In my vending machine I recently sold a 2 star aae handmade for 2k caps i think. I got it from the purveyor. It's just nice fireworks but nothing great.
---
Vats crit sneak ranged build here
---
No, that's Bethesda for allowing for it.
---
Old school miner hat with metal armor.
---
lol, nah
---
I miss it so much.
---
Xbox. It‚Äôs not happening to me during the event though. It‚Äôs at random times just playing. The event is running just fine for me so far.
---
I agree with you, half of the threads on this sub would be gone if it was up to me but unfortunately the mod team works as a team, and we decided to ride the wave until the ocean gets bored.
---
It's why I made the comment,I couldn't remove so I wanted to tackle it head on (albeit incredibly badly) but we live and learn
---
That's awesome.
---
And that's nuke bait.
---
Sounds constructive.
---
Yeah first it was my gf then our friends and I was the only one left and they didn‚Äôt get anything due to the long progress of getting back into the world
---
Oh shit that‚Äôs  sick!!! I‚Äôm going to go grab me a hat as soon as I hop on tonight! Thanks for the heads up!
---
lol, well it appears we disagree
---
Bethesda Logic ‚Ñ¢ 
---
You'll take some but not a lot which doesn't make any sense since your head is exposed but w/e.
---
It's a Schroedinger's Shill at this point. Each positive poster simultaneously is and isn't a PR account.
---
Companies do this all the time. Why is BGS/BGSA/Zenimax any different? It‚Äôs borderline standard business practice nowadays. And it‚Äôs only going to increase as the years go on. 
---
And what base is that? 
---
Quite a lot of people got 1st. Many people DO love this game and clearly want to see it grow. 
---
I already spend to enjoy the game and 3 extra bucks plus taxes isn‚Äôt that damning. 
---
I‚Äôm just sick of people berating other because reasons. 
---
Offending them isn‚Äôt going to make the chargeback their stuff or quit.
---
I‚Äôve got an instigating explosive handmade and a furious handmade (I miss the 85-bullet drum magazine!) and a fixer for low level things and when I want to only tag stuff (like in Uranium Fever). I‚Äôm looking for something good to one-shot bigger things but haven‚Äôt found the right gun yet.
---
Got the helmet.
---
Nah. Going to keep irritating people like you because it's the most fun I can get out my fo76 purchase. Down vote me. Internet up doots mean nothing to me.
---
I still haven't seen anyone spawn in a bunch of random stuff in adventure mode. Aimbots and such are common in all games and are clientside.
---
Just follow the capitalist's mantra: "If the money is right, what can go wrong?"
---
I also play on ps4 and I don't have this problem.
---
Check your rooter or the wi-fi wire (if you have).
---
Also, check if your PS4 isn't full, because when you have 100GB remaining on your console the things start to get bumpy on all games
---
No, that's players that are selectively going after certain players just because they wanted to pay for something.  Players like that are what make games (even 76) not fun to play.
---
I'm on moble and dont know how to post a like as a reply but search mischief in the sub and like the 2nd post is a list of all the rewards. Theres 15 new plans and 5 new outfits. All of them but the fireman outfit require you to complete the events in a costume to get them.
---
I will. Thanks. 
---
Keep being salty I‚Äôm sure that will do you good. 
---
So long and thanks for all the fish. Peace... mate‚úåÔ∏è
---
Dumb question: Did you read the plan?
---
People are stupid , it is the same as the lauch day , the game was a pit of hell to play , And people forgot , duped itens still rolling around And people ignore , Bethesda fuck up multiple times And people ignored , people love to suck on Bethesda titties trying to milk the minimum ammount of fun , Bethesda PR is this : "Lets stay quiet" And people acccepted that.
---
Never said it didn‚Äôt exist üôÑ. I just stated it was patched last week.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4. The server has crashed two of the three times I have done the new event so far. Luckily it has happened early enough that I could get back in before the event finished.
---
The real problem is that people are again just moving the goalposts of what pay to win means, and you can be damn sure that Bethesda will run right over to jump the fence once again. 
---
And those who purchased the service are trying to downplay the actual utility of its features. If these features are so worthless I wonder why they bought them in the first place... ^/s
---
Dude  üòÇ 
---
Tell me you have that thing on video, that would be a solid Oscar
---
It's been fixed for me since the patch, including the Halloween event.
---
You see the issue with this dumb as shit "just walk away man" arguement is that if we just walk away now Bethesda will think it is ok to shove it into Fo5 and ES6. I don't give a fuck if it stays contained in fo76 but it won't. Either we say something now or Bethesda will think they have the green light to ruin franchises that people have loved alot longer than the train wreck that is fo76 has existed.
---
I got a sub mainly for the atoms as it is a pretty good deal on those alone. I was looking to get some Halloween stuff and was short. So it worked well for me. The other bennies are nice but not that big a deal. The scrapbox could still use some QOL improvement. The tent is fine but shouldn't persist between logins IMO. And the rest is cosmetic, though I do enjoy the dances. Haven't really decided the future of my sub beyond the first month. Finances and what's in the store will guide where it goes.

Of course Bethesda writes fake narration posts in this sub. All of them are written professionally and share the same style. How would you otherwise explain that dozens of different redditors write exactly the same way?
---
I haven't done it yet but if people were nuking the primal cuts I can see this happening pretty easily.
---
Well i subscribed too but the dances should have never been implemented get that fortnite shit out of the game.... If you honestly think they are cool you are a bigger Problem then a normal 1st subscriber
---
Didn‚Äôt you just end a sentence with ‚Äúlmao‚Äù?
---
Oh damn. Now I just ended a sentence with ‚Äúlmao‚Äù. 
---
...
---
2 for 2. Quitting whilst I‚Äôm ahead.
---
I'm going to uninstall r/fo76 in protest.
---
I remember getting constantly ganked by enemy players in Stranglethorn Vale in WoW. I could blame the players, but ultimately it was Blizzard who designed the game that way. Same thing with Bethesda and FO76.
---
+ respect, thanks for your reply
---
Fan the flames. I'm getting my marshmellows guy.
---
That's not the same thing and is a stretch. Shark cards are actually buying currency. Everything in the entire game runs on that money and you can't do anything without it. You can't buy caps. Not that they are really that valuable after a while.
---
I permanently have 8k - 13k bullets in my machines at all times because I do lead runs and craft ammo a lot. Sometimes I'll sell a few thousand in an hour and sometimes nobody buys any in a whole day. It's not a magic wand to "create money". It's all priced at 1 cap, so no it's not expensive.
---
Btw this isn't a defense of Fallout 1st. I'm pissed off about unlimited storage for paying players. I'm pointing out the false comparison.
---
dont look up....that pie in the sky may /not/ the moo-n.
---
But very laggy I'm guesing
---
Lmao üòÇFar from it matey lmao but go ahead n vent your anger.
---
I'm a warhammer 40k fan hence the name + my dob.  I'm not entitled, salty or bitter and neither am I arrogant. (I'll take the legend part even tho I'm not, ty tho üòâ)
---
If I wanted the fallout 1st sub I would do, i don't because I think for one  it's not a good deal plus I think this is the wrong way forward for this game. It will create a divide between the community and instead of these new things being put for all players in the atom shop it'll be behind the subscription for their members. 
---
I'm not thinking of myself, I'm thinking for the whole fo76 community
---
Obviously we have a bunch of Gary's running around /s
---
But yes I get it, I was wrong, I've admitted this a lot already
---
There are people with more money than sense. Not to say they don't have sense, it's just that they have way too much money to use it sensibly.
---
It's a serious problem in the 1st world. People don't understand the power that comes with wealth.
---
Has nothing to do with disagreeing with me and more of a point that people will believe things and do things that will never make any sense to me
---
I have the same problem. Not only at the legendary vendor and machine, but also regular vendors. I hope they can fix this.
---
Where is this in the game?  I don't think I ever went to this.
---
And anyone who is even remotely critical of the game is a "hater". What else is new.
---
Check with them. They might need some steel to make those.
---
Wow. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised how many other companies use this. Imagine if a company with a lot of influence were to practice this. They probably do. Imagine how much bad stuff out there continues because people believe in the words of the shill PR accounts. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if movie production studios do this with their films.
---
Hillbilly Hotdogs is portrayed as Hillfolk Hotdogs in the game.  It's over on the far left of the map, maybe by the cemetery?
---
I won‚Äôt nuke but I do intent to take full advantage of the mayhem theme and PvP like crazy. 
---
For those that don‚Äôt want to partake, well, it‚Äôs more time you can spend building pretty things at your camp. 
---
Discuss
---
Yeah i read them, found the problem.
---
They dont get shown if you dont actually have pumpkins.
---
I thought they made the Pumpkin House up for the game.  LOL.
---
And of course they remove it...
---
no, ur still bounty-ified unfortunately.  must have another player kill u
---
I run pacifist full time and have those mutations. While folks have tried on occasion to abuse them in that manner, nobody has ever succeeded in forcing me into PVP as yet. Not that it would typically get them anything of value if they did.
---
That's a fair gripe.  I'm not one of those people so I can't speak for them, but the only reasonable argument I can think of is this:
---
Some people don't really enjoy the games they play.  They play in order to not fall behind their friends, or so they'll be ready for if the game gets better.  Or maybe they have sunk-cost fallacy and just keep playing because they've already spent time and money on the game.  These people don't view their time spent as entertainment, but rather as an investment.  So when their friends quit or the game doesn't get better, these people lose their investment and all that free time goes down the drain.  I think it a very unhealthy way to game, but it's a trap a lot of people fall into and the mobile/live-service industries specialize in exploiting it.
---
Something I *have* fallen for in other games is you don't know how much you'll enjoy something until you try it/get to it.  I can think of a few games where people keep saying "the end game is great, just push through the grind to get there and you'll have so much fun!"  Or perhaps the game starts fun and goes downhill.  When you progress, you realize just how unfun the game is near the end.  Maybe you quit and lose all that time, maybe you keep playing out of sunk cost fallacy, dogged frustration, or because you're stuck in the friendship/alliance trap.  But the whole time you're thinking about the other games you shoulda played instead and actively resent the game as you play, forcing yourself to log in and daydreaming about quitting.  Of late, I've felt this way about every mobile game I've played, Dragon Age Inquisition, and FFXII.
---
well, Bethesda have like undying fans that no meter what Bethesda do to them they just come with a excuse to keep giving them money over and over.
---
So yeah they will keep the silence and feed from the Whales and fat sheeps.
---
I noticed that they show as locked (as opposed to not available).
---
3 star bloodied silenced lever gun, 1 star bloodied silenced lever gun, 3 star bloodied machete. 1 and 2 shot most things. Only use/carry these.
---
I have 3 star bloodied poweful auto silenced handmade, 3 star bloodied railway rifle. Sold a 3 star bloodied silenced gauss 4k caps because it was s l o w
---
And they'll keep doing it, cause sadly this is hard to prove, even though we all know it's probably happening.
---
Oh definitely. But that code might be "add highlighted item to inventory when they press E". That's my point really.
---
I think people are misquoting the No Clip documentary.
---
Yep, I do remember. I'm sad to be leaving.
---
Hope you continue to have fun out there!
---
True. Part of the argument that companies do this all the time is an easy copout. Plus why do you think they do it? Because people keep buying.  One thought is that they will complain to Bethesda that people are griefing them and make them think, wow people do really hate this.
---
Agreed the boss should be tougher. With as many people at the event the extra health or defense wouldn‚Äôt matter too much. 
---
Was just in an event and someone one tapped the boss. No one by the looks got hits in. But comeuppance because they DC‚Äôd seconds later and the rest of use got 3 legendary SB.
---
Still no.  That's normal PvP.  If you were being targeted specifically because you purchased a feature that enhances the game only for you, then maybe.  Going out of your way to find specific people is trash.
---
Aaaaaand [removed]
---
It mainly happens at Legendary Machines or the Purveyor for me which made me think it was my console
---
If you‚Äôre really interested look up how cigarette companies hired PR firms to spin that cigarettes were healthy back in the day. Or how Nike‚Äôs PR team has handled their sweatshops
---
As stupid huh.
---
So you're either &gt; stupid, or &lt; stupid than me. And judging by the fact you think your comment was clever, and not a potential self-own, I'd wager I'm less stupid than you. And you sound miserable. So, miserably more stupid. 
---
That, and I doubt you have a more demanding degree than molecular biology.
---
You're 100% right about the identity crisis - it's had no coherent vision since day one, except "a Fallout-shaped online game that makes us money". And their attempted solution, which is to haphazardly add content in every area, stretches an already minimal player base extremely thin. Good luck finding a Hunter/Hunted match these days.
---
I‚Äôm looking forward to instigating and stirring up the shitstorm as much as possible.  Bring your big boy (PvP) pants!
---
Nice. Your lucky man. I'm pretty sure that's rare.
---
Most of the mods I did early on for Fallout 4 were just quality of life stuff like full dialogue options.  And now once or if they add mod options to private servers it's now essentially behind a paywall.
---
Yea I‚Äôm a sneak ranged build as well. I run either my vamp 10%aim lever action or my bloodied FFR lever action.
---
I believe the rewards are unlocked daily.
---
Check back tomorrow I guess?
---
Bethesda is
---
No take backs :D
---
and while I love the outer world so much it's just so short I've just completed my second play through and it only released last week.
---
And kill others.  PvP!  PvP!  PvP!
---
I made a load of witches hats and costumes and skeleton ones that I drop for people without costume. Seems to be appreciated.
---
Guess I will. It's kinda dumb tho, since you need more and more exp each reward
---
Eyeroll....
---
They also stealth nerfed the rarity types of the junk collected. Rare good junk is even more uncommon.
---
Definitely not the space on the hard drive just checked and got 400GB space left so not sure
---
Hunting rifle, lever, pipebolt, Dragon, gauss and handmade or plasma rifle for cqb. I have all unyielding weapons and Fdc reduction armors.
---
I don't know what you are talking about I've been scrolling and all I see is the well justified hate.
---
Lol. Removed. Because reasons.
---
No, Bethesda has no shills here.
---
I defend them a lot, but this is just bullshit.
---
Oh no shit...
---
I was not aware of this,thank you for the clarification.
---
Learn somethin new everyday.
---
That's nice üëç
---
It‚Äôs literally the perfect event to alleviate all the angst that seems to have reached an apex last week.  (Im not taking a stance either way, just making an observation. We already have 100s of threads devoted to the monetization argument. No need to derail this one.)
---
I‚Äôve done it twice and it‚Äôs just nonstop death and destruction. It‚Äôs hard to follow what‚Äôs happening at first.
---
If you play bloodied, keep twice as many rad chems as you normally would. Between exploding cars and ghouls smacking you from behind, it‚Äôs pretty heavy on the rads.
---
I would but Bethesda charges per tear.
---
I play on xbox. I have no knowledge of any of these cheats your talking about. All I know is the multiple duper fiascos and the dev room items.
---
15? Good lord. I use two rifles:
---
* Instigating Lever-Action for sniping/headshots
---
* Furious Assault Rifle for anything the LAR doesn‚Äôt kill
---
I also carry a melee weapon for mobs I don‚Äôt want to waste bullets on.
---
Removed eh? Doesn't seem like a very neutral action....
---
"What makes a man turn neutral? Lust for gold? Power?"
---
They won't refund you unless the "product" was somehow broken or faulty. If you were just unhappy with it, I'm afraid that's not enough to be eligible for a refund. Still, Bethesda should have the decency to atleast respond back to you. Fuckers.
---

---
Mine seems to not be working currently. I could do the first 250xp challenge for the first paint, but the next challenge did not come up, as of 15 minutes ago.
---
Its just a five day old account with a bunch of random ass numbers in that name. Nothing strange about that. /s
---
someone put it best a few days ago: anti cheat ain't cheap. nor easy to implement. so the opposite of what Bethesda wants for Fo76.
---
you can whip up a basic .esp that gives you godlike powers because most things are handled by the client. the server only checks quantities and spawns things.
---
That...was a nonsensical sentence.imho.
---
What is removed? Am I missing something?
---
Did it last hour, no issues on xbox.
---
Except it does... I've replied to one of the mods in that thread and they agreed that personally that thread is a paranoid shit stirring witch hunt... but the mods as whole have apparently decided that if they actually tried enforcing the rules it would cause an even larger shit storm with people calling them paid Bethesda shills for shutting it down and are opting to hope people get bored of this eventually.
---
I had the thought that it would be daily. But with that maybe it'll be 250xp each to help those who don't enjoy/aren't as good at winter
---
Yeahhh..
---
Guess it encourages people to log in daily and play NW.
---
I've done it twice - to be fair it's a complete shitstorm with all the cars blowing up. Your game might not be able to handle it üò¨
---
It's a tie. Bloodied + 25% FFR + 25% Reload .50 cal or Bloodied + Explosive + 90% Reduced Weight Gatling Gun. With a macro to manually shoot it, the Gatling Gun actually does similar damage to the .50 cal, however, due to the reduced explosive damage mechanic on the SBQ, it's less effective against her. That .50 cal shreds everything in the game with a bloodied heavy weapons build. 
---
My BE Handmade and Unstoppable Monster are also contenders, but for ease of use and making the entire game easy to solo, I'd go with the .50 cal.
---
It got report bombed. I have reinstated the post.
---
Or maybe Ive lived in agonizing self-doubt, questioning everything for years, approached with curiosity and a deep background in STEM that I've managed to have some predictive power better than your average human. 
---
Introspection? Every minute of every day.  Don't assume your thoughts are at the *ape*x of humanity. ;)
---
It‚Äôs a valid point cop out or not. 
---
It‚Äôs expected at this point. Look at the Burrows, Encryptid, fashnht. Each time people bitched and moaned about something. 
---
This is no different. Money or not. 
---
But attacking, offending and being asshats to others for them doing what they want is petty and openly just not cool.
---
Not sure why you are getting downvoted. What you are saying is truth.
---
I mean any outfit from the event right now is rare!
---
The collection and fridge can both be earned without paying real money.  Earn atoms from the various game mechanics and then buy them.  You can call it pay to win, but with perks, the fridge is basically useless.  I don‚Äôt even bother.  The collection only does like 16 Pieces of junk per hour, maybe less.  Hardly game breaking.  If you‚Äôre going to gripe, at least donitnfactually and not with self delusional lies.
---
Playing an instrument seems to be the thing I see most often.
---
Bethesda firmly believes hunger is the best cook.
---
that's cringey as hell. You guys are losers
---
I got one too!
---
Even if the game didn't have a full retail price tag, it would still bothers me what they're doing with 76. You're spot on that it is an adoption of the mobile gaming revenue model, and it's really bad for the future of the series.
---
Ever since Farmville back on Facebook, there has been a class of games where the core game mechanic is simply "Click a button, and then wait minutes/hours for this to finish," and then the game tries to sell you the ability to not wait. For a lot of them this mechanic is literally the entire game, so it's easy to write them off as a waste of time and money, but similar "features" have infiltrated mobile games of every variety.
---
Now, I'm sure just about every PC/console gamer hears 'mobile gaming' and thinks they're all absolute trash even without the microtransaction bullshit, but I have played a few over the years that had some measure of potential. Maybe not CKII level complexity, but a core gameplay that was at least on par with simpler console titles like Pokemon. Even those rare good titles still end up getting ruined because they use the same monetization model. Put up frustrating artificial roadblocks, and then offer to let you skip them for a few dollars.
---
Not shure either
---
It's only a "fiasco" because some people on the internet went batshit insane.
---
I have a BE auto handmade with FFR.  Primed it up as well.
---
No I won‚Äôt sell it 
---
The assault rifle is a distant third beyond the handmade and combat rifle.  I have a quad auto combat rifle with FFR and that‚Äôs a pretty ridiculous weapon as well.
---
That sounds aweaome
---
Year subscriber here. I‚Äôd be fine to never hear that robot dance music in the lobby again.
---
Three times completed so far. 3 different plans, one outfit, and a golf tee *shrug*
---
Then near Flatwoods... maybe a workshop
---
Pretty cool honestly. Bunch of people showed up, got some cool rareish costumes and plans.
---
I tried once on X1X and didn't crashed, but at least the second half of the event I probably had 20fps max...
---
I afk'd meat week for long periods of time and never died from dehydration/starving.  My character was thirsty as hell and hungry, but he was still kickin
---
I was done as of last week. I just can't stand it anymore. I am a beta player, have been through the game rain and shine, but this....this is an outrage. They ruined the franchise. My only hope is that Obsidian gets enough money to buy back Fallout and gets to work on a true Fallout game.
---
I'm looking at the texture mods mostly if they change stuff back on update the texture mods get wrote over.
---
you're a shill.
---
I‚Äôm not bashing the game in any way I‚Äôm just educating people to hopefully stop one of the many cycling arguments in this sub
---
He's super constructive. Some months ago he was all "this pvp is awful i'm leaving." Now he's supposedly got fallout 1st and posting so everyone can see. Just as petty as this old man.
---
Well now you know the difference between people and leadership.
---
Are you THAT scorchbeast? lol
---
Mass explosions, flying ghoul corpses and robots galore. That's how I describe it. So far I've just been strapping up my boots and using barbarian/blocker with unarmed to run around and punch all the cars and smack all the robots. Completed it 3 times so far. Helps if you split up the tasks, can get a tougher person to take out all the enemies and explode everything, and have others trick or treat and graffiti and fork the lawns
---

---
Here‚Äôs an in-game pic of me with it!
---
The plan does drop from Project Paradise. Did it many times on my main character and finally had it drop a few days ago on my low level guy.
---
Three times, snagged the jumpsuit on the third try.
---
hang out in a workshop
---
Yup. The reports were incorrect.
---
That's it. Not everyone wants it. I get that. But that was what I was hoping for when they said survival. It... wasn't what I got. :(
---
They were multiple level 60s and I was... I don't know? Maybe 30-35 something. From my perspective they were clearly harassing me. They kept killing me over and over again until I had to leave the area in order to be left alone. They targeted me because I was lower level and easy to kill. But that's not the point. The point is that they weren't doing anything wrong according to the rules of the game. As long as Blizzard allows for that to happen, I can't really blame players exploiting that "feature". Same goes for Fallout 76. I honestly don't see the difference.
---
To further that, apparently players are actually trying to specifically target those who purchased the 1st.
---
Ah yes I‚Äôm sure this is what Bethesda wanted from the community when they announced free DLC, a class system where those who pay for bullshit micro transactions and fallout 1st feel superior to those who don‚Äôt. 
---
I‚Äôm now flashing back to all the people who shout at those who complain about micro transactions ‚ÄúUm they‚Äôre just cosmetic you don‚Äôt HAVE TO BUY THEM‚Äù 
---
Well I guess you don‚Äôt have to, but if you don‚Äôt you‚Äôre a dirty freeloader is that right chief?
---
Tried twice, both times game crashed
---
Eddie (ED-E) is the only one i need. Best companion ever!
---
It is mostly done by modifying game files so it would take extra effort if someone wanted to pull it off on consoles. Say you want your gatling gun to become a handheld A-10 Warthog. You just edit your gun's firerate from 500 to 20000. It just works like that
---
I have seen people create a locked room for their character and rubber band the controller to look around or walk. Good luck
---
I have a feeling 1st was planned to be implemented either with or near the Wastelanders update.  When wastelanders got delayed the corporate suits upstairs said to ship the give-us-money update anyway because money.
---
It's a fairly frequent drop from a few world locations like the train car outside Watoga station. It's worth to learn it and make the helmets to sell to vendorbots.
---
The argument you're trying to make is that one side of this argument claims that anyone positive is a Bethesda shill/sock while the opposite argument is that everyone negative are just haters... the problem here is that one of those is more accurate than the other.  Just look at how popular that thread is compared to the normal activity in this sub... eight thousand upvotes and climbing.  Shit like this gets popular and starts spreading to greater reddit and everyone piles on because lolfallout76.
---
This. I subscribed as well, but the music attached to the animations is irritating, and is being abused in the lobby. They're only appropriate to use over the bodies of bush wookies in the final circle.
---
I wish they would have stuck to emotes, and not added dances.
---
I'm beginning to sense a theme.
---
I'd like to take a moment to appreciate that we are having this discussion without biting heads off. Thank you!
---
And my vote's on p4a. That... other one was much too long to be practical. :)
---
Maybe is because they're being again too ambitious and doing wastelanders far too big. Wich I would love but, idk maybe 15‚Ç¨ is too much for the subscription.
---
Anyway, if the devs aren't getting enough pay 'cause of the revenue that the game has this days they need things like the subscription.
---
If people came back and fallout 76 had solid 30mil players Bethesda wouldn't add that kind of things.
---
Just as I cannot comprehend how anyone actually believes the Earth is flat, I cannot understand how someone would be OK with Bethesda doing this to the point of buying it.
---
For some reason I'm getting bombarded with dislikes. Don't know if it's the cheaters or Bethesda themselves
---
That's Vault 76's experiment. They masquerade it as a control vault xD it's not.
---
tried once, PS4. I counted at least 7 100+ players so we tore through it pretty easily.
---
Can you do mods on a Tesla Rifle?
---
Oooh I can actually see them doing this. And I bet the people here would go nuts for this feature.
---
Thanks, just realised I‚Äôve gotten confused with the other marine helmet, i appreciate the help gamer.
---
I have two sights and an automatic canon, you want a full auto tesla rifle?
---
I suppose. What I wonder is how much of it was nexus mods, and how much was Creation Club. I imagine there's a clause in the Creation Club setup where the modders basically hand over rights to their work. I mean, it would be a smart business move for Bethesda, but it sort of (read: really) sucks for the modders...
---
There‚Äôs a reason they are the top posts, trolls really done put that much effort in
---
It's the exact way I feel treated by Bethesda as a customer. Lied to, offended, asshat company being openly greedy, scammers
---
I feel like many blame employees, thinking that their voice is even heard in the slightest. But in most cases its probably not. 
---
The decision was made higher up ande they know betterthan to peruse this sub. The ones people are raging at probably had 0 input in the decisions made and raging at them is pretty much shooting the messenger. Which is how we lose this action in the future, like they will just stop coming here. And then people will complain that we arent being listened to.
---
I'm not saying people dont have the right to be angry and carry some resentment. But like, people are being threatened with their life. And that is completely unacceptable.
---
For real dude. They really need to address the cheaters in a serious manner.
---
Don't put words in my mouth, chief.
---
I never said "dirty".
---
As long as you can see how much of a jack ass you're coming across as, I'll take it. Regardless of your amount of self doubt and questioning everything, your perception of the world around you is not as omniscient as you think. Your comments scream arrogance and narcissism.
---
Is shit your name? Because most people love their name
---
No...... Heh...?
---
Maybe the earth IS flat!. Jk, it's not, but I feel ya.
---
So much like everything in FO76, it's broken. Cool. Thank you.
---
I've been debating on whether or not to make it an automatic honestly. Is there a mod to make the magazine size bigger?
---
&gt;the problem here is that one of those is more accurate than the other.
---
No, both parties are equally guilty of namecalling. It's just that one group is bigger than the other. There are more people who dislike the game than like it.
---
Eh not like another Zenemax company is going to be a shining beacon. What they do they barely get away with because of size, commitment, and community.  ESO is also F2P.
---
I unlocked the 250 xp bat skin yesterday, but the 750xp reward never appeared, or unlocked. Kind of figure the challenge tier is bugged
---
I bet that fireman uniform is gonna be very rare.
---
I do! xD
---
Prior to the update that added PA mods to the vendor pools, I was selling fully modded T-60s for 8500 caps as quickly as I could gather the materials to build them, now I can't get 5K for one and any less is a loss, better off to sell the materials.
---
So not only was it there, but it was in the first 0.3 seconds of that video. Wow. Umm... I don't even know what to say.
---
Well, like I said: they've done it before!
---
I‚Äôm not blaming everyone in the company. Bethesda itself might not even be to blame (they are owned by Zenimax). Obviously, there *are* employees in the company who at least agreed with this, maybe not the devs, but some who worked there.
---
Just did my first last hour too. Was a bit buggy, kinda froze and came back dead, not that thats hard as I'm bloodied. But we finished it no problem.
---
That's a future lesson for ya - don't bow to the bullshit.
---
Yes it's working fine on PS4 and it's better than the meat week event.
---
Rhino wasn't a card, it was a tank you could buy and at launch the most expensive thing.
---
Yes. Fiasco.
---
Very cool! I'd love to visit someday. Thanks for sharing.
---
That‚Äôs full on David S pumpkins
---
Misinformation is a culture now and the US president is showing companies you can get away with it.
---
Now we have hive minds that claim anything they disagree with is fake news alongside fake hive minds made up of fake news.
---
The world is a cluster fuck. 
---
Accept some people will have a different view to you and that doesn‚Äôt make them fake. Also, try to read both sides of a story before making your own mind up. 
---
I‚Äôm not a fake or shill account (but that‚Äôs what I would say if I were) and I don‚Äôt hate Bethesda right now. However, I‚Äôll be called fake for holding that opinion. 
---
Subreddits tbh make this culture worse. Look at subs like /theDonald or any political sub tbh the echo chamber doesn‚Äôt causes development of thought it just creates more fringe thinking.
---
Sigh... history of the future will never be accurate again I fear.
---
LOL I just watched that last night because someone mentioned it on the datamined rewards for this eventüòÇüòÇ
---
Hahahahahaha....
---
Hehehehe üòÅ I'll get over it. Thanks
---
Lol yeah I know the tank I thought he was saying you could purchase a rhino card I'm like huh?
---
So it will find you all the asbestos you could ever want (and a whole lot more)!
---
Oh... you wanted ballistic fibre? Well eff me, then. /s
---
The ESO community has fought with Zenimax a great deal to get a specific type of monetisation on what is now a free game,
---
Targeting lower level players has been a thing since multiplayer was an idea.  The only thing some games attempt do to curb this is the attempt to place players in games that are around the same level. 
---
The game play literally does not change for people who purchased 1st nor does it give them any kind of advantage but, trying to seek them out simply because they purchased a feature that others hate, is not the same thing.
---
GTA Online is similar.  If you dont go out and buy some of those flying cars that launch missiles, the game is difficult to enjoy.  I quit playing that game over a year ago because I couldn't walk down the street without a dozen flying cars and bikes launching missiles at me.  In that case, buying game content DOES effect game play and ruins the experience for people that don't want to pay.
---
Are you serious?  It's equally accurate that the majority of the positive threads in this sub are either a) People being paid by Bethesda to post positive news or b) Actual Bethesda employees or bots operated by Bethesda to post positive news?  That is the literal argument these people are making.
---
To add to this: does anybody know which guns can use the bats skin? Thank you in advance
---
Post it! As fast as possible man XD

2, sometimes 4.
---
My go-to's:
---
BE handmade
---
BE lever action
---
For the fun of it, I also sometime run around with a BE black powder rifle, just to BOOM at things, and sometimes a BV crossbow when I want to be stealthy.
---
 Bethesda could fuck up bottling water, hand them a 2litre bottle and point them to a tap, and they'd fill the bottle half way, glue the top on, fuck up said bottle so it leaks, sell a replacement cap in the store while not fixing the glued on top, and just so happen to have a properly sorted bottle in the store, but the water inside is stale and from a toilet.üì∑**2**
---
Well I'm guessing here but this is my theory.
---
Fo76 has no paid DLC's, they are paid for by microtransactions in the atom shop to fund them.
---
Bethesda gave us free atoms for completing challenges, not enough however to buy items, thinking we'd buy some atoms to make up the rest.
---
Bethesda underestimated the community , we scrimped and saved these free atoms not buying into their corporate bullshit with very few gamers buying actual atoms.
---
Bethesda needed our money after the game bombed and atom sales weren't happening because of the free ones we were receiving through challenges.
---
To test the waters for fo1st they started creating offers with nostalgic  costumes attached to see if we would buy these deals. First the elder maxon etc.. bethesda noticed most players bought these.
---
This wasn't steady income however so now we have got fallout 1st, a service that brings in money each month or year
---
idk, personally I'm looking forward to the pre war firefighter uniform that was shown in that one trailer for the game
---
The physics engine in this game cannot handle non-animated movement, period. It just doesn't work. FO4 did not have real elevators.
---
It's a fiasco cause wastelanders got delayed, and piggybacking off that announcement was Fallout 1st.
---
It's a leaker, of course it's not a professional blog. Like I said, he was correct every step of the way with Anthem. I'm sure half the people on this thread saying "untrustworthy leaker" foam at the mouth when something they're supporting leaks.
---
Ehm... the automatic canon XD
---
I said it last week, the mods on here need to go into overtime and clean up and start issuing bans/warnings to people who are behaving as such. 
---
Hell, most of the people still complaining don't actively play or visit this sub, and are just here to stir the pot for those who are easily angered.
---
I feel ya. 
---
It‚Äôs literally school yard BS. Tommy said that jimmy saw Marco with Mandy who hates kate that slept with mike who‚Äôs older brother, blah blah blah. 
---
It‚Äôs sad but you can‚Äôt stop the internet
---
Yeah just a few people... Not many at all.
---
I did mention paywalls in the body.
---
I don‚Äôt think you should be able to specify exactly what you want, but I‚Äôd happily pay much more than the usual scrip to guarantee what sort of weapon or armor you get. I‚Äôm sick of getting black powder weapons, I just want a damn Gatling gun!
---
They will probably add it..if you got atoms for it
---
&gt;  I would be prepared to stim yourself and others.
---
Anyone out there who needs to revive another player for your Scout challenges, here's a good opportunity to do so

I mean, if you're going to act like everyone is insane and that people are on either 1 side or the other.. then yeah, you're going to be seeing stupid shit because your view is wrong. 
---
Plenty of us who just don't care either way.
---
I try to keep it to two but currently i have 3.
---
Instigating Gauss w/limb damage for my primary.
---
Mobs i try and deal with my Fixer - Instigating, Explosive, limb, or anything low level as .45 is cheap and everywhere.
---
Anything tougher i've got an AA Handmade ie SBQ, SB.
---
I hate that there' nothing i can do about the weight, as its at least 50lbs for all 3, i don't carry bandolier so i limit to about 600 of each ballistic type. I do use Batteries Included to keep Fusion Cores and 2mm light.
---
I can carry 290 total with backpack on my build and 310 i believe in PA with calibrated shocks.  
---
Edit: I have a 3 star 90% weight meat hook for low levels, or events etc. At 0.8lb its silly not to just truck it around. Only lvl 35 tho
---
Unfortunately, your enabling of scummy practices affects my experience in the gaming world. Wish it wasn't so, but that's the reality. Plenty of hardcore players have noted why F1st is unfair and scummy. Like I said, you either don't understand or you don't care. Both are bad for gaming overall.
---
And thanks!
---
Gee, sounds like I should just play fortnite if I'm gonna be getting the fortnite experience regardless of what game I play...
---
This. 
---
Yeah the hate is sort of called for but what does calling people names and whatnot do? I‚Äôm not gonna chargeback by stuff because xxxsomethingxxx said so. Or called me an idiot.
---
Lunchboxes you get 1 free every month if you are a Fallout 1st subscriber!
---
Thank for not rick rolling me
---
Nice!
---
Okay I won‚Äôt say your wrong xD
---
So why is it okay to gank a low level player but not someone who has a Fallout 1st subscription? Again, I don't see the difference. If the game has PvP, why does the *reason* you attack someone matter?
---
Does this work both ways? Are people hired to trash competitor products?
---
YEEEEEEEEAAAAH! WOOOOOOOOO!
---
I would have hoped the community here would have agreed. The reception indicates this community doesn't, which should be scary for every gamer.
---
Not trying to convince anyone, I've already tried that and people either don't understand or don't care.
---
There are many bad actors on the sub right now, that's for sure. I'm in a weird place because I share their criticism of Bethesda but I also think a lot of them are irrational or just plain trolls.
---
I feel for the people trying to stay positive. I'm actually really surprised this shitpost about Bethesda PR is allowed to be posted here (it's clearly a conspiracy theory which falls under rumour rules), and seeing it hit 5k upvotes last night made me decide to withhold some of my criticism. I don't want to see jackasses dominating this sub with incessant negativity.
---
Because GTA used their own servers.
---
FO76 rents then from Amazon.
---
Gotta pay the bills. ü§∑
---
Don't agree with their practice. Just pointing out an answer to that question.
---
it's a little late for that now...
---
Oh no,you must be mistaken. That's been fixed 2 or 3 times by now.
---
But seriously, I had to laugh at the wording the latest patch notes. The sentry bot sounds "no longer **sometimes** loop endlessly". Thats really what it says.
---
The story is on what I heard from an anonymous source, that's not journalism, it's called propaganda. Any other sources to back it? Did the journalist eat lead baby food as a kid? Those questions are more interesting.
---
Me and a friend took over the power plants last night. Shocking no one showed so we powered them up, got bored and left. I did back on the beat with a couple level 8's, dropped them some stuff. There's new players in the game from what I've seen.
---
OK here's the thing (aka serious discussion time)
---
The *post* is a shit post, there's no question.  But a good percentage of the posts here are lately, so that's no surprise.  But the *post* is just stupid.  At best you could call out rule 7 (Do not post rumors or leaks without actual evidence. )  But that's it, and that's quite a stretch.
---
The *comments* seem to be coming off the rails, though not really in a big way (at least the top ones that I read).  Generally speaking, you don't remove a whole thread when there are wacky comments in it (though there are certainly exceptions to that for particularly egregious situations).
---
You can report individual comments for removal, without removing the whole thread.  I've been dong that for a couple days, and the mods seem to be pretty on top of things.  And there's actually a little bit of decent discussion going on, so I'm not sure removing the whole post is warranted.
---
And as much as the OP there has his tin foil hat on so tight it's cutting off the circulation...that kind of thing does actually happen.  I wouldn't be surprised if there was a little of that going on around here, but it's a waste of time even if it was, as there's too much disenchantment to just sweep under the rug.
---
You are very [welcome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0).
---
But I bet a lot of those people are interested in Bethesda's next game, and allowing Bethesda to break promises and wring the customer is scary for people interested in those games.
---
The pinnacle of an intellectual argument. You win.
---
Some cheating is insanely hard to catch, and even if you catch how they‚Äôre cheating you have to think to redesign the game in a way to keep it from happening again. I lost my patience in ESO with cheaters and now I‚Äôm just at the acceptance stage
---
ESO with its terrible monetization didn't affect FO4
---
Now that Saint Bernard is a good doggo.

I'm doing a bachelor's degree in Coomunications and digital marketing. We studied that very practice last week LMAO
---
The AFK timer is 30 minutes including a 2 minute warning, and yes it's the same on private servers.
---
Once the Server owner is gone, no other players will be able to join, and if none of the existing players have FO1st then a 20 minute countdown starts for the server to disconnect.
---
I was more about your Last phrase
---
I got sucked into reading comments lmao
---
I agree I think we've had a lot of the same thoughts about the game's economy :)
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks something should be done lol
---
My camp is in the south of whitespring and I have to server hop after event so not to be attacked after fast traveling.
---
Shit attracts flies.
---
I feel you're overcomplicating it now. What I'm saying is that both parties (the "shills" and the "haters") are equally guilty of accusing each other. The reason why you see more upvotes in negative threads is because that party/group is larger.
---
Well at least those Fallout 1st members can just hide in their private world.
---
You can‚Äôt buy something and claim the stuff and get your money back. That‚Äôs not how the world works. You tried to get the outfits and emotes for free than found out you couldn‚Äôt.
---
Now that is food for thought!!! I always imagine yes there are dirty tactics involved outside of politics. But you gamble being sued for defamation.
---
Would‚Äôve bought it just for the atoms, but they thought locking content behind a pay wall would be an incentive.  It turned out to be a deterrent to many.
---
Where is this located? Are you building at mount Blair? Or using that as reference?
---
Sound like something a shill would say! Or wait.. am I a shill?
---
Ghouls need to break their arms after slapping you for any amount of serious damage when you're in power armor.
---
Not sure if shit poster or just dumb...
---
You can't presume to know the demographics of their sales. Many adults who earn incomes maintained their resolve and did not purchase F1st. Some did buy it, sure. But to paint it as "the adults are above this and it's all little children complaining" is a gross mischaracteriziation. 
---
It's like people think the view I'm promoting is anti-gamer somehow. It's the total opposite. By defending and enabling these practices, you are harming your own gaming experience in the long run.
---
And the "I can afford it so fuck those who can't" claim creates a very bad dichotomy.
---
I remember the first time they "fixed" it, it went from sometimes to guaranteed every time. If this game ever improves enough to make a nms/eso/ff14 level recovery, some of these stories are going to be really funny to look back on. Otherwise they will just be sad reminders
---
May come as no surprise to you, but I do not like Snickers.
---
I'm sure someone spoke up somewhere down the line, and that person above them simply said something along the lines of "We're a business. We are here to make money." Are they wrong? No, but it's not a good look to the fans.
---
You know it‚Äôs made them a lot of money right? It was a success for the business.
---
Its the assault rifle :)
---
Edit - should note its only for that weapon but looking at a rewards list you can unlock others
---
So everyone who pushes back on the irrational rage posters, is now a paid shill. 
---
*Right*, you're not a part of the problem in here, at all...
---
Yup, instead of the game dev/publisher paying for development, you're going to! They have a lot more money than you, but they'd rather not front the cost so they're very glad you're willing.
---
Yes it is funny, how again such topics pop up like: Please can we get elevators. Like there are not a ton of other issues with the game. Hey at least has not yet forgotten what Bethesda has done. I really hope that this negativity in this forum is here to stay. There aren't many other means to tell Bethesda to get lost. I already deinstalled Fallout 76, but i'am still sad and angry what they have done to the franchise. It makes me scared what Starfield and the next Fallout will look alike and that i won't ever buy another Bethesda product. After all Fallout was me favourite franchise. 
---
Congrats to 8.3k upvotes. That is quite more engagement than this sub had in a long time.
---
A lot of people who don't even play and have obviously hated the game since day 1, they got a hard on when they saw a way to get more clicks. It's typical Alinksy shit. I should say, I understand the whole 'I gotta gets mine' attitude when it comes to clawing you're way up from nothing. I think it's the wrong way to go, but to each his own.
---
Thank you very much :)
---
But have you heard of the new game hearts of warriors 4 ??????
---
I know it doesn't, saddly..
---
Yeah I know what you mean, but I think on top of the plans being added a lot of people have the power armour sets they want to use most often, so with the plans and somewhat lower demand the prices have unfortunately bottomed out
---
It would be nice if there was a way to add value to the power armour sets again, or at least to profit from modding.
---
I‚Äôd put $100 on it that 75% of the people who bought 1st are over 30 years of age. Adults don‚Äôt complain about stuff like this. It‚Äôs fairly easy to predict age demo on this board.
---
Blame BGS, they started dividing the community into this. Everything was fine until there were 1st and 2nd class, people just want to be treated equal at the end of the day, Fallout 1st works against overall equality by saying "hey, give us some money every month &amp; we'll make life in game easier for you", when this opportunity for QoL should be standard for all without a price tag.
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
I think its an icon bro
---
16x the silence
---
Bethesda always fixes bugs they know of 2% of the time
---
That's the problem, the dust has already settled. Sales were good, outrage is down. And life goes on. Until of course Bethesda gets caught lying and being scummy 3 months from now, then the cycle repeats. And on and on and on.
---
The shills who OP ratted on, confirming their existence.
---
XD  fuckboys downvote me for speaking facts,  stay mad bethesda fanboys 76 is a joke just like your life XD
---
No one HAS to pay for anything for fuc* sake. Play the game or don‚Äôt .
---
Same for me.
---
$100 and they will
---
Ok yea there may still be a lot of day 1 bugs, but we have tents and private worlds now, be grateful. R/s
---
oh noes. dang
---
if thats the case then each negative comment could be as well, maybe all these posts about oh, we are in ‚Äúthis game now‚Äù outer worlds etc, well those are just as likely to be from those companies trying to promote themselves and sabotage bethesda
---
I never said that was ok.  I've stopped counting the number of times I've quit a match because the player levels were severally mismatched.  But never in my online gaming have I ever targeted a player because they purchased content that made them enjoy it.
---
I didn't hunt down players in Quake II because they had a different skin then I did.  I didn't hunt down players in Star Trek Online because they had an exclusive ship that I didn't. 
---
Specifically asking on how to target players that purchased 1st is a trash reason to attack someone, justifying it is just as trash. Is ganking players that purchased 1st really that important to you that you make the game unenjoyable for that player?
---
lol thank you from the rest of us for being afk!
---
Ngl carrying a A-10 warthog gun would funny af. Albeit nerfed.
---
If you say so...
---
Seems a touch dramatic, but also in line with a lot of whats been posted lately.
---
I got a frame rate of about 1, with the game constantly freezing.
---
I have a fairly decent computer, so I assume it's because the servers are made of cardboard and rubber bands, but who knows.
---
Good to know. So I guess it's back to PA plus the mask.
---
Simple... I said 200+ days ago here on Reddit that they would follow ESO plus and they did since it‚Äôs successful and players wanted it... 
---
Here is my post from 200+ days ago
---
Just blue screened as it was about to give me rewards for the one that just ended. Come the fuck on...
---
How much would it cost for you to put the automatic barrel on it?
---
My point of view is not that fake posters don't exist (on both sides, this includes people who smash the game and spin fictions about bugs they encountered or whatever). That seems to be expected, and I think the OP here should edit their post to specifically point out that these bad actors exist for both sides. It's not just a brand marketing thing.
---
My problem with that highly upvoted \*shitpost\*, is that it's describing all the positivity as being Bethesda PR, which is idiotic. This game has had troubles but there are still plenty of people who play and enjoy it. It would be delusional to think that all of those people just gave up because of a sub and that nobody has a sincere interest in being positive anymore.
---
It's a turd-based argument and frankly I think it far more probable that the person who made that thread is in fact a bad actor trying to generate resentment, either for fun or some video game crusader agenda against Bethesda. That type of person far outnumbers Bethesda PR actors, and it's easy to see that based on the irrational hate this game gets in most corners of the internet.
---
So at the end of the day, while I remain critical of the 1st sub and how Bethesda has handled this game for the last half year or so, I will in no way be following the lead of a bunch of inflammatory conspiracy theorists who are the type of person that will argue that anyone who likes this game has brain damage. I've dealt with those douchecanoes many, many times, they are unreasonable, boring, and self-interested people.
---
Twice, yeah. Can't work out where my half full pumpkin rack is, whatever that plan created.
---
TTV BTW
---
Here‚Äôs hoping that Wastelanders comes with some form of anti hack/cheat something. Nip it in the bud now before this game becomes a hackers paradise
---
Don‚Äôt participate in the event, typically these events draw in a lot of players to get back in the game, if Bethesda sees the player count not raising this week as much as they projected, hopefully they will realize they did something wrong
---
Good lord you little baby
---
I assume the halloween event has borked the servers.
---
I seen someone talking about making them like a shotgun? Is that real?
---
All enemy melee attacks work even if I jump 20 feet in the air well before they hit. If a yao gai is charging me I should be able to jump over it with marsupial.
---
Broken or faulty? *Sees my junk disappear into scrap boxes* yup, everything is working just fine xD
---
I've never played NW, so I don't know how many XP points gets you to level 30, but here are the rewards:
---
Can't help much more than that here, but hopefully you get it resolved.
---
No I only use vats for my pistols
---
It doesn't look like it. But did it affect FO76? Looks a lot like it.
---
The game has a lobby?
---
If it makes you feel any better, we‚Äôve all been where you are right now...not specific to level 30, but just thinking an icon was a loot box or a background was a camp cosmetic.
---
You guys feel like another tag along I'm MrBojeezy on XBone and will be on in about 2 hours
---
First try at mischief night the server crashes on me
---
My opinion that I disagreed with Fallout 1st is pretty outspoken. I just don't compare it to actual rape and/or murder.
---
It's just... Ya know... Sliiiiiiiiightly different.
---
They're both online games that require the devs to make money for regular updates so I kind of expected it to
---
It would be but nuking it only gains exp since you can‚Äôt wear costumes to gain the extra reward.
---
Yes, this was a workshop build at Camp Blair.
---
It should, I read something about fasnact masks being coded wrong so they wont work
---
&gt;sabotage bethesda
---
Bethesda's sabotaging itself just fine, it doesn't need any outside help in this.
---
I didn't think about this, I'm hoping you're wrong but I'm thinking you're right.
---
Yes. And you can really just wear a hat if you want. Anything marked as a costume will do. There are over 200 things that count. Just try something and if you don't qualify, there will be a misc objective to put a costume on.
---
I thought that but it's a consistent problem. Get automatic weapons and use them constantly while doing raids or nuke runs. Could just be bad timing on the part of the server but it still shouldn't be an issue.
---
You‚Äôre being downvoted, but this is actually possible. Especially with Bethesda behind the wheel and their track record.
---
Nice. Ill have to build there myself some time.
---
O wow this is wide spread. As no one on ESO across all platforms can't login eather. So what was thaught as a fallot76 issue is act the same prob for both companys.
---
Just completed my second event. No server problem for me.  And just unintentionally server hopped into a 3rd one.
---
see, you are likely just a shill for one of those other gaming studios
---
Strongly disagree.  Value isn't absolute, it's comparative.  For you, current state FO76 is a "complete experience".  I'm glad the game's value was so high for you personally, but many obviously disagree and aren't necessarily wrong to do so.  For you, the sub value is justified because *"I just don't think expecting people to spend their lives working on something without some form of compensation will ever be fair" .*  For me, who's also poor, that has nothing to do with value and I find the sub extremely lacking compared to what I can get for the same money in other games.  Games also made by devs who spend their whole lives working on something and are more deserving of my money, imo.
---
And yeah, *The Order: 1886* was blasted as one of the worst games and worst-value games of all time.  It's a shining example of why you should never buy games at launch like that (especially if you're poor) and purchasing it is, value-wise, like shooting yourself in the foot.  As a fellow poor person, buying games at release is for rich idiots and we should have more sense than that.  Compare just about anything to TO:1886 and anything will come out ahead in value.  Overpriced tiny-cup coffee?  Still better than TO:1886!  Instead of comparing FO76 to the worst, most scamtastic non-mobile game of its year, I'd suggest comparing it to something of good value.  Witcher 3 with all DLC is $15 now, for example.  Roughly the price of one month of Fallout First.  Civ V with everything costs $20 and gets you into a vibrant multiplayer community for.  You can do "one more turn!" for the next 5 years in that game.  You can buy basically any remastered classic RPG for about $3.  That's *thousands* of hours of value in some of the best games of all time for the cost of a FO76 sub.  There are a lot of high-value products from good studios that are also fully deserving of support.
---
Also, strongly take exception to your statement that this is a case of people wanting *"moar moar moar and everything free for life".*  Quite the opposite, as games now are pushing to monetize things that were once included with purchase--and structuring their games around microtransactions.  Want to sell more XP boosts?  Slow down XP gains by 50%.  Want to encourage movespeed boosts?  Reduce movespeed by 10% and increase travel distances by 20%.  Creating problems and selling the cure is a staple of the modern live-service game.   
---
 FO76 is pushing the envelope as a recently released full-price game with an extensive (and grossly overpriced) microtransaction shop **and** a sub service (of questionable value), something more games are actually moving towards in a time of record game profits for minimal game effort.  In this case, I'd say it's actually the marketing companies who want *"moar moar moar and everything free for life"* from the players as each company tests what new thing it can monetize and what it can pull out from games and sell back, or what people're willing to pay for.  A lot of people view FO76 as a low-effort cash grab for a reason, as it blatantly reuses assets, code, and bugs from FO4.  There were legitimately bugs in FO76 that fan mods from FO4 fixed.  You might be able to spend a lot of time in it, but is that really the only measure of how "complete" an experience is and how deserving of your money the devs are?  Especially as someone without that much money to burn?

This is ridiculous.
---
The old code was honestly not the main problem with F76 (unless you mean all the fucking bugs carried over from F4 into F76... bugs that were fixed by modders!).  It's that the code was written for a singleplayer game.  Huge chunks of the code were written with the assumption that there would never be more than one player. Quests were baked into the world since only one player was going to be affecting it, the world was only loaded in a bubble around the (one) player, quest scripting only assumed there'd be one player (like give THE, singular,  player \_\_\_\_ item), etc, etc.
---
So it was a doubly whammy.  We got the usually load of Bugthesda's best, and then they upped the ante by trying to force a square singleplayer engine through a round multiplayer hole. They simply needed far more time to force this to work right, but didn't want to bother.

I actually crashed twice with my second one. With the first instance being because I was trying to put on concentrated fire, not that the it was the cards fault all I did was open the special screen.
---
Ghouls now doing acid damage also? Sounds like it in audio, plus the lingering damage. IDK but ghouls are way tougher then they were like a month ago.
---
Ok, I'm currently not on. But will be in about 2 and a half hours. Maybe a little sooner. Is that ok?
---
So the shills report bombed it. Wow.
---
Cool, thanks man! Guess there's no need to wear regular armor for now then, since I've gathered a lot of fusion cores!
---
Well you didn't specify that earlier when I responded with my comment on paywalls/"premium" service.  In either case fallout 76 bugs are frustrating because unlike other Fallout games I can't recover lost items since this is an online game. I don't have a previous save to go to or any console commands.  The bugs in previous Bethesda games were tolerable and sometimes even charming and funny but that was usually because there were ways to fix that on my end. Even modders came out with community patches.
---
Yeah like a plan or something you can get multiple times.
---
yut, the info we get vague.
---
Could you make me a level 10 suppressed 10mm sub machine gun with all the best mods for damage? Could do with one ASAP, thanks man!
---
It's all about the wording. Maybe I've been online too long but I can almost always tell if someone is sincere or not. I do believe people genuinely enjoy(ed) this game (as I have) and there's a lot of people that for whatever reason feel justified spending money on a sub regardless of how it'll motivate (or not) Bethesda. However, I do think their PR posts at least semi-regularly-- anyone denying so is simply naive.
---
Two and a really fast switchblade. A quad barrel explosive lever action and a two shot sniper. Lever for fire fights and sniper to lure them in. Switch blade for 20 and below. Can easily take down a pack of ghouls back to back. 
---
If Im doing the sbq fight I pull out my two shot gatling or explosive .50 cal machine gun
---
I‚Äôve been here since beta and have seen this bug since the early days, not much hope one year later with still no fix lol
---
I whole heartedly agree. Daggerfall and morrowind were my jam. Fallout 2 was really good. But they keep dumbing shit down, make it a little prettier and then try to cash in on stupid stuff. Build a quality product and when consumers back. Look at FROM software, Naughty Dog or the like. Quality game experiences.
---
lame, is day 2 available yet? 
---
if so does it count that original 250 exp like normal or is it starting at 0?
---
Here in 2 and a half hours I'll be sleeping, but it's ok add me and tomorrow I'll see what I can do when I'm back from work at 17:00 Spain time
---
Never crashed for me. Three plays in.
---
Fuck em‚Äô
---
Lol it's gonna be free range all over again, I ended up with 21 mutton meat pie recipes from farming it
---
Enough people have accused me of being one that I'm beginning to wonder where all the extra money I must have been bringing in went to
---
Lower than a feral ghouls IQ
---
Guess that reference xD
---
I got the half empty pumpkin stall every time now
---
&gt;if they released unlimited scrap stash for a monthly fee I would pay for it
---
***Uh....***
---
I have an instigating 50 cal with sneak damage of 2.5 it regularly hits the whitespring ghouls for 800+ damage for the first hit. It rarely needs 2.
---
Ive Done the event just once and didnt have any problem. Ps4
---
I think there's not a suppressor for the 10mm smg but I can mod it as much as possible, you're interested in?
---
Oh ok, its 4:20pm at my house, what time is it at yours?
---
https://i.imgur.com/3USgt2g.gif

---
Heavy barrel
---
That‚Äôs just a bad attitude to bring to an event where a bunch of people are trying to enjoy the things we actually like about this game. 
---
Be cool man
---
You'd be surprised to find out that they in fact do have anti cheat in this game. It's just that it doesn't do nothing. The state of this game bro.. ffs
---
Oh, yes I‚Äôd still like one please, my psn is dj-mike-h
---
bro üòéüí™
---
Nice gun.  I have a bloodied explosive black powder rifle.  Have you one shotted any scorchbeasts?
---
And I also have a lever action as a backup - also bloodied but not explosive (and level 35 :( )
---
Here is some light reading for your afternoon, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do my Fallout 1st subscription!
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum
---
They are hoping we'll forget and move on
---
I'm done with this sub and the game. I'll just wait until Fallout 5
---
I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs going to be a higher xp needed starting at 0 and no I didn‚Äôt have it available yet
---
Lmaoo of course, of all events its probably the most annoying cause of the amount of mutton meat pies you‚Äôll get. Its like a 90% drop for that plan, and like 10% for a mod plan.
---
Awesome, would you also wanna do my 50 cal when you do the Tesla?
---
you need to earn 3,500 AFTER 12:00 EDT Today.  
---
If you earned 3,500+ NW XP Since Noon today hats off to you, but honestly doubt it..
---
Ya ive been trying to log into ESO all day with no luck so theres clearly some correlation with the server issues.
---
Lucky. I'm 4/4 with 1 stars so far.
---
I don't know how that works but some people don't seem to give the same value to objects that I do. Some will offer good amounts when you just tell them to "make a decent offer" so that works :P The Purveyor can give you a few good items for selling, if you buy 2* ranged weapons.
---
Worked last time.  So why not?
---
Definitely aware of how I'm coming across. I guess it's being glib to a assumptive comment about presumptions.
---
But yeah, I might be wrong. But in the history of video games, upgraded equipment is all but obligatory in expansions
---
Ok, now I'm not on but tomorrow at 18:00 Spain time I'll be glad to mod your weapon. Sounds good to you?
---
I made the first one and I was precisely thinking why I don't get the second challenge ... I'm also currently reading to see what happens
---
Yeah I just got it for the second time
---
Ok, so if I get on in the morning here then you'll probably be on.
---
I'll look I may have you do one or two more weapons.
---
That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm just clarifying that the position does actually exist and not to immediately discredit either persons position. All in regards to the conversations going on in the top trending post about Bethesda‚Äôs PR accounts being active in this sub
---
Oh, it‚Äôs ok, I really needed it very soon, I‚Äôll let you know
---
That's amazing xD   
---
Are you on PC? I'm on the hunt for Halloween style camps to photograph (with permission ofc) :o
---
He's overrated
---
But is it really gonna change anything? It's still gonna be a buggy mess and ruin the experience.
---
Not yet. We don't know much about it. And they seem to fuck up every promise they have made so far.
---
thanks for the heads up, hopefully it will be active by the time i get off work
---
Yep add me and when you see me connected that means I can help you. Unless that is my brother I'll let you know. Thanks
---
Yeah. My very first kill after Fallout 1st was a legendary scorchbeast. My camp is close to a fissure site - I kill about 10 SB's a session. About 1 in 4 is now legendary - I'm lovin it.
---
People come here everyday saying they like the game. So it's a fact that people like it
---
I can almost guarantee that due to this post the amount of people getting called out as paid shills is going to sharply increase
---
They could have just also made scrap weightless.
---
Perfect I'll try to scavenge as much as possible for some resources.
---
Thanks a lot. My PSN is HillbillyDLUX08
---
Pasting a wikipedia link doesn't make my view a fallacy. You are not understanding the argument. If anything, most people don't believe what I'm saying, that's the problem.
---
I have materials if you need them.
---
4 attempts and 4 time crash. Xbox
---
I‚Äôm going to be honest- you lost me
---
I won‚Äôt say that doesn‚Äôt do anything. It‚Äôs more on the people. Look how easy it is today to look up how to jailbreak X or mod Y or hack Z. You don‚Äôt have to have a C+ book on writing code. As long as you can read step 1-8 it‚Äôs too easy now.
---
well you get a small amount of uninstalls, and the large majority of the player base who are happy as fuk to have private servers and actual stash space
---
Ok I'll add you now, but I'll play tomorrow 'cause I need to sleep
---
Idk about that one, i always jump to avoid being hit, you gotta time it well tho.
---
I hope it's not going to be constant, I know they made different tiers for the things you can get as rewards, but the same thing over and over will get boring and annoying :/
---
If I need a few I'll tell you but in theory I should have all.
---
I wonder if your HDD is just starting to fail or if you are using an external with to long of a usb wire, hell the wrong type of wire even.   
---
I know I had a 6 ft USB to my external unpowered HDD and games would crash just enough for me to think it was the company and not me.  I swapped to a short 1 ft usb and no issues ever after that.
---
No worries, of course. Get some sleep and we can meet up tomorrow.
---
1 handmade, 1 lever action, and 1 deathclaw gauntlet. All bloodied, carryweight usually 430.
---
Not gonna happen.
---
There are so many things to correct in online games, every patch or update is very difficult to deliver, a lot of people are working on this project and if devs can't see something we need to open their eyes, we can't just complain in 99/100 posts about business, it will not solve anything.
---
Sounds good to me. Thanks again
---
Yeah it would, I kinda hope we get it Longer then a week
---
Join.die.
---
You do realize that you can‚Äôt really pvp unless they fight back. And also that mentality is what led to the creation of Fallout 1st.
---
PS4 Pro with brand new 2TB SSD and external 2TB SSD both made to work with PS4. Had no issues with crashing. Only crashing when I try event and so have other friends of mine
---
Nope, I promised myself to only buy Atom Shop shit with the Atom points I accumulate in game, also those are pointless items to have when you have 2 PS4s, 2 mains, &amp; 8 mules. Cheaper to buy a used PS4, 76 at sale/reduced price, &amp; a year of PS plus than it is to subscribe to Fallout 1st for a year or 2.
---
This was an issue with meat week. People would build trap houses to lock mobs in and force the event to fail or keep the mobs to themselves. Granted you could nuke those places to boost the event slightly.
---
They know about this lol, I‚Äôve seen Atleast 3 replies from community managers saying bethesda is aware/ they passed on the info again. They just prioritize other things that make money. Just look at how many bugs fallout 4 and skyrim have still
---
Please dont get them started.
---
Honestly, I enjoyed the game a whole bunch and found it fun to play, but the constant disconnects is what made me leave. Reinstalled it somewhat recently and had the same issue with disconnects so I stopped playing again. Once I saw First come out, I uninstalled, cuz: fix your shit server issues before you ask people to pay more for it!
---
Some months ago PVP was awful.  Though I do feel kinda special that you took the time out of your day to dig up a 7 month old post I made once a long time ago. 
---
You must be very bored, and have no life if you think that being a reddit PI with my very short post history will sway my opinion that you are a douche canoe.
---
studios dont make games if they dont intend to profit. welcome to real life, you entitled , um person
---
Maybe pay $100 to have it to yourself? Just a (terrible) idea.
---
Dumb question: So will I get better rewards wearing veil of secrets or fasnacht mask? And do they stack, like I wear a witch costume and a mask.
---
Weird flex but ok.
---
Damn I would‚Äôve given a hefty bit for that if on xb1
---
yeah some people will stretch anything to fit their narrative lol
---
Of course they are not related, outer worlds is good on release.
---
Nice to see positivity here.  But I would reword your text carefully or you‚Äôll flare up more pretend angry people and start a new flame.
---
Been smooth the three times I‚Äôve done it on PS4.  First gen PS4 here.
---
I'd play NW all the time if it didn't have such long load times. Get rid of the lobby in the vault let us go into it in adventure mode. I played a bit of the new season of apex and you load in within a minute or two.
---
Completely bugged. After a relaunch from crash I came back with 1 shot in my gun. When ctashed I had 100+ left.
---
Played 3 times so far and I got empty stall, then full, then Grim Reaper cut out.
---
I'm sadly on xbox
---
Ah, gotcha. Quick trip to the pumpkin house then. Thanks.
---
I can not afford to get 1st so let's go get thoes rich bas@#$bs forward to glory and Gref the 1st
---
My first event someone was playing thriller. Too bad didn‚Äôt break out in dance.
---
Saying "plenty of hardcore players have noted" doesn't make whatever comes next true bud.
---
Might just be visual glitch. Few patches ago they fixed a bug where every time you joined a new server the gun you had equipped the clip would be empty. But as of last patch it‚Äôs back
---
Honestly, I think it can't be pay2win. Because there is no win condition for me. So I would not purchase such items because it makes no sense. Same with their cosmetic shop. Makes barely any sense for an survival game.
---
Especially if you consider how mundane the items in it are.
---
Hahahaha never tough the fact this might be a reality
---
I need to try it in third-person, maybe. The sound and damage are so delayed it's hard to tell but I definitely seem to get staggered when the yao gai is nowhere near me.
---
Just logged in and there‚Äôs a blast zone over Whitesprings so let‚Äôs go! üòà
---
Why you still here then.
---
The age is why there's so many bugs in Bethesda games though, whether that's from past code or not it doesn't really matter imo. They've been using the creation engine since 2003 and i think they need to get rid of it. It's admittedly probably too late for starfield as i imagine it's close to if not already "playable" as in super basic starfield specific systems. TES 6 i think they need to use a new engine for or Bethesda is gonna be in big trouble. 
---
Fallout 4 had a lot of problems that mostly overshadowed the bugs like lack of meaningful choices and such. The last game they made before that was in 2011. Microtransactions were barely even a thing in that time (crazy how much things have changed) and having bugs was kind of acceptable. 
---
Now with the quality that even some indies and double A games have and release with (dead cells and the outer worlds for instance) that level of bugs isn't really acceptable anymore and i think people are starting to open their eyes to that. Look at this game as well as ghost recon breakpoint. Only difference is ubisoft pretty much went "oh shit, we can't get away with that apparently" and delayed their games until next year. Bethesda on the other hand decided to stick to their guns and slap a subscription onto their game.
---
I'm sure I'm not the only one on here already being called a shill, because I don't necessarily agree with the current outrage. You're post is doing nothing, but confirming an already irrational bias for a lot of people in here. This isn't helping anything.
---
We'll probably get them, even more, broke than before
---
maybe its your internet connection, and not the game.
---
I checked my ammo bag, I have 1 shell. Maybe ill relog before the next one and see if it gets fixed.
---
If they can't stop them, they should at least ban them or something. They ain't doing neither. Really really disappointed. Saw some hope when Bethesda landed a ban wave it was all for show
---
Shame them for being paypigs
---
Yeah, GTA is one of my fav games, I'm an online open-world junkie lol. There were about 3 missions that paid 15-25k lol but now I run my import/export 100k a mission lol.  Honestly, fallout 76 is a little to easy especially with mmmggmmrr and that's why I'm on the fence about the add ons. I don't care if they add them to the shop because I'm not buying them lol. 2 weeks of grinding in GTA and you can have 1 or 2 things you want. Fallout 76 you can just buy them off the market.
---
Yeah I remember that as well which was a huge pain.
---
Shame they got rid of CAMP damage...
---
*Braces for downvotes*
---
This. Though, I've mostly seen this in fort defiance, so at some point I'll venture across the corpse. Outsides probably a bit trickier to locate it. Probably teleported back to the closest fissure site.
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt think certain headgear works.
---
Yep, my Fireman Helmet didnt work but Gas Mask and Ritual Mask works.
---
I think it really has to be a **mask**
---
Yeah man it has to be your connection. Latency issues will do that constantly.
---
u/ladydevann
---
Would be nice if you could pass this to dev team. Along with the joining a new server and begun equipped is empty and needs a reload. But that was fixed but back with recent patch. And the extremely old bug that has to do with the 250 DMG resist while reloading breaks the weapons primary perk. 
---
nononono it's always bgs fault
---
Would be nice to see a ban wave come with wastelanders. A good time for comeuppance.
---
Yeah with these shitty servers you gotta like
---
 ‚Äòpre-everthing‚Äô cause of lag
---
K bye see you soon
---
I bought it from a player vendor for pennies! Couldn't believe my good fortune. I have managed to occasionally one shot a Scorchbeast.
---
And yeah im always in 3rd
---
&gt;  Hillfolk Hotdogs
---
Oh, I've been there.  I never knew that was the name of that place.  AHA, nice.
---
Don‚Äôt suppose you are going to post your gt so i can come and steal your nukes from you?
---
You get extra rewards wearing a costume?
---
They're probably making money of 1st subscriptions, so their plan is working. There's silence because, well, they've got our money as planned.
---
I just tpd to another one before it ended. Extra exp.
---
I'm here just cuz the 250dr bug is still a thing. I really won't start an other post about business, that's not the place. So have a nice day dude and support the 250dr bug cuz we want use our weapons without so much stress :)
---
That's exactly the reason. Downvotes without replies means "I don't like what you are saying but I can't refute it".
---
Thanks for this. I wasn't aware you got to keep some of the perks.
---
If you're the PA type, I'd still recommend wearing armor regardless.  I only wear PA when I'm in a nuke zone or in heavy combat.  Can't stand wearing it just running around on the map.
---
Join us.
---
Nah you should be ok. You didn‚Äôt mention the hate word of the week. 
---
They should have camp hits on a 3 strikes rule.
---
Yes.  Be sure to wear a costume.  In Power Armor, just take off your helmet to apply the headwear.
---
Your post is specifically attacking one side of the issue.  The only ‚Äùcommunity‚Äù that would have agreed with your post are the people who agreed with it days ago.  Attacking the other side isn‚Äôt going to get them to change their mind.  In fact, you‚Äòre more likely just to anger then at YOU and steel their resolve in their actions.  In other words - attacking the other side is just going to make them stronger.
---
That‚Äôs why after every controversy things just go back to normal.  The ‚ÄúAngry‚Äú crowd attacks the people who are ‚Äúcontent‚Äù calling them stupid, say they are letting themselves get bent over by Bethesda. The ‚Äúcontent‚Äù ones get angry, they get defensive.  People who weren‚Äôt even playing a lot may actually start playing more.  And people willing to spend money are going to spend more. They now believe even more that they were right in their actions than they did before. 
---
It‚Äôs even happening with TOW.  I wanted to give that game a try once it becomes available on Steam but people keep rubbing it in the face of everyone else over Bethesda and it‚Äôs actually making me not want to play the game. This is explicitly not what the Obsidian Devs wanted.  And that game is buggy too
---
The ‚Äúcontent‚Äù side is having fun.  Having fun takes less energy than being angry.  They have the endurance in this battle.
---
Personal attacks aren‚Äòt going to get you anywhere.
---
All that said, maybe your beliefs on what‚Äôs bad for gaming are wrong.  Maybe if we look at how games only cost $60, but sold for more back in the NES and SNES days (consider the original price for Phatasy Star III), and if. You adjust for inflation would cost nearly $100 now for games that are done in 2 hours.   Maybe look at how with digital delivery systems like Steam, Epic, the App stores or even services like [itch.io](https://itch.io) increase the competition across the board so that pretty much any Tom, Dick, or Sally can get their little game out there, no matter how bad it might be.  While I disdain true P2W mechanics (none of which we have seen yet are truly P2W) and I think loot boxes are predatory, perhaps other MTX and subscriptions are what is necessary for games that want have things like online servers that players can enjoy.
---
I‚Äôm not expecting to change your mind, but in my ‚Äúold age‚Äù I have seen many things transform and change - including gaming.  At the same time, things don‚Äôt change.  Game companies aren‚Äôt ‚Äúmore greedy‚Äù than back in the day, look at what happened with Atari - they pushed a programmer to develop ET in a very short time frame, and then printed more carts than there were active Atari units.  The game sold amazing, but undersold because they published too much. Nintendo has tried again and again with stupid gimmick to make money, and then quickly abandon them - look at the Game boy printer,  Virtua Boy and the WiiU, or worse, look at Amiibos - small collectibles with NFC chips in them that they intentionally keep scarce, even though special game options are locked behind the NFC chip.
---
tl:dr - attacking people isn‚Äôt going to change any minds, maybe your views on gaming and gamers are wrong, and things aren‚Äôt really any worse than they were 40 years ago
---
I'm not dropping anything.
---
Let's call it a slow day for this douche canoe to slide on down the river. You chose to engage and now we're super bff's.
---
Yeah man that‚Äôs just a 18 karat run of bad luck honestly. Working fine on public servers
---
It's possible Bethesda is creating accounts to defend this game but there are many fans of this game and the Fallout Universe and they're happy to defend it.  
---
But I've played the hell out of Fallout 3, 4, Vegas, and now 76.   There's no other game designer I've found that creates an immersive world that draws me in like Bethesda.  They're like uncle Joe who has trouble firing up his laptop but can tell amazing stories day after day.  
---
I remember playing Fallout 3 for the first time and walking down the dark subway tunnels and getting jumped from behind by a ghoul.  Listening to three dog spin tunes and his wonderful patter - by the way, if you haven't done it yet, kill him and then listen to his broadcast.  Walking the lonely road in Vegas and listening to the coyotes howl.  Finding the Whitesprings golf course for the first time at level 40 and running for the safety of the wall while radiated ghouls chased me and the nuke blast was shaking my headphones.
---
I don't work for Bethesda.  I love their games and I'm happy to say it and I don't care if people up vote me or down vote me.  I'm not blind to the problems and I worry about the decisions they make and may make.  I understand they need to make money or they'll shutter their doors.
---
And Bethesda, if you're listening, if you do introduce loot boxes or a undeniable pay to win format I'll move on to Outer Worlds or fire up something else.
---
I just go for the ones with the most text. The reviews where you can actually tell they own and use the thing. Like when I bought my laptop the best info I got about it was in a 5 star review on amazon that was a few paragraphs long about what issues he had that he fixed easily. He still rated it 5 because it was a screaming deal for a laptop that didn't have any heating issues once it was undervolted and had the GPU driver updated. Meanwhile all the other 1 sentence reviews were just bitching about it overheating and games not selecting the correct GPU.
---
Not on private servers.
---
In no way does 4 look better than 76 unless you mod the shit out of it, come on.
---
Misunderstood. I thought you were going to nuke WS... my bad.
---
I'm still waiting for my professional check from Bethesda, then. I wonder if it will arrive before the professional leftist check from George Soros
---
Are yall really blaming a hardware problem on bethesda now.
---
You‚Äôre a shill too?? Fuuuck
---
Sure thing, thanks for your comment Todd!
---
I got bored around the release of NW. I also didn‚Äôt agree with the way the game was going (focus on monetization rather then actual improvements and bug fixes). Decided to stay for the laughs and  because I still had some hope for Wastelanders. After everything that happened lately, that hope is now gone.
---
current theory seems to be that they are releasing 1 a day so people dont get them all in 1 day again
---
If I delete all my posts about bugs do you figure I could send bethesda a bill for services rendered?
---
Yeah
---
Haha damn fools. That theory sounds legit tho.
---
Add Looch#7529 on Discord!
---
Fasnaught hats probably dont work though. Guess its time to throw on my witch hat.
---
Just sucks because the owl is my favorite
---
so much this.
---
So pissed I‚Äôm at work right now. Can‚Äôt wait to try this out.
---
I know each BMW agency does this to boost their image and service's appearance
---
They're the same as the normal Adventure Mode servers, except they're booted up and access is restricted to the player who initiates it and their friends who join.
---
From what I understand:
---
1. Player chooses Private Server
---
2. A new server is started using the same setup/process as an Adventure Mode server
---
3. Access to that server is restricted to the player who started it and any of their friends who join
---
4. When the last player who has Fallout 1st leaves that server the server is shutdown, any non fallout 1st players remaining are booted at the end of the timer
---
An in game news screen reads "A new Nuclear Winter challenge reward will become available each day until November 3! Collect all six before November 12."
---
Aged just fine its the single comment bethesda got their data on.
---
Oh hey, if you are still interested it seems they brought it back on the shop today for a week.
---
&gt; and the viability of every type of build
---
What's the point of different types of builds in Outer Worlds? It's not like you're making major sacrifices speccing your character out to be a smooth talker. Or going stealth vs big guns. It doesn't have the equipment, skill, or perk variety to require that.
---
This is exactly what a shill would want us to thing. gj shill
---
K bro
---
When you think about it Bethesda is pretty similar to spacer's choice: their products are low quality and break often, relying on the purchaser to constantly repair them
---
Right o bff! Detailed network statistics under your network settings will give you the info if it's you are something else.
---
Require? No. But games are about fun, so
---
But you're supposed to blow the cars up.
---
No way, what are the odds? Good lookn out man
---
I go to white springs train station
---
You better be talking about New Vegas or you are a 76% betrayer
---

Aha! I feel your pain, friend. Let‚Äôs go sit in a corner and glare at all these people who are getting through it with no issues.
---
Yea I try to log in every day to do some daily challenges. Yesterday iirc 60 Atoms in 15 min and today 30 in 10min. And on Saturday I'll do most weeklys. And have fun over the weekend.
---
I still love it after a year :)
---
As far as a location to wait for a murderer,  Vault 76 is the best. Everyone can fast travel there. Make your character naked and unequip your weapons and punch anyone over level 5, they‚Äôll notice you‚Äôre unarmed and without armor. You‚Äôll get killed in no time!
---
I haven't played in months I'm an Overwatch guy.
---
You can unlock one per day.
---
I am just waiting for f2p to drop to get my girls to play fallout dolly dress up and camp building with me on private servers.
---
You don't need to be a better shot, you just need to shoot more bullets!
---
Aren't the guns in the starting area the only guns you get throughout the entire game? Just higher level or mk 2 or ultra but with the same skin?
---
Oh thank god, I'm glad you got different rewards!   
---
Might just be my luck for getting the same thing everytime, I'll have to keep trying I guess!
---
How do you fork the lawns?
---
Does a hazmat suit count as a costume?
---
Oh... Well it's silly, since it causes so much lag.
---
I'll try to get there before it starts next time.
---
Son, we play in a world that has walls, and those walls have to be built by men with computers. Who's gonna do it? You?  You, Yong Yea?  I have a greater responsibility than you could possibly fathom. You weep for microtransactions, and you curse the purchasers. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know. That microtransactions, while tragic, probably save jobs. And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves jobs. You don't want the truth because deep down in places you don't talk about at parties, you want that DLC, you need that DLC.  We use words like honor, code, loyalty. We use these words as the backbone of a life spent defending something. You use them as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who plays and complains under the blanket of the very freedom that Bethesda provides, and then questions the manner in which they provide it. I would rather you just said thank you, and went on your way, otherwise, I suggest you pick up a dev kit, and stand a post. Either way, I don't give a Hoover Dam what you think you are entitled to.
---
I think you left out your Internet cost, mortgage/rent, and electricity cost. Man this game is expensive...
---
And I ended up with (I kid you not) ~100 duplicate Fasnacht masks from that event.  But they've been paying for my 5.56 ammo for a while now, so that's good.
---
Why not serial farmer?
---
That was fixed
---
[Lie] Of course.
---
I just want to cause mischief.
---
Very helpful, ty
---
Well that is a super weird thing, I suppose it is possible. I just have the PS4 slim and it has been fine for my son, and no crashes on the xbox one x I use. Still new drives are prone to errors, but if what you say about friends if they are on pro also it could be a pro bug in scaling with the data.   
---
Can you set the resolution? If so maybe try it on 1080p, upscaling and the type of tv along with HDMI cord along with HDMI 2 or 2.X makes a difference for input lag which can cause crashing in games.   
---
It's hard since so many myself included have not had issues, not to say there isn't one just it could be a something else causing it issue.
---
I‚Äôm totally a shill, #moretiresintheatomicshop
---
Good, identify em and get rid of em...
---
At least they are legit 100 fasnacht masks
---
As someone who is near brand new to this game, I wish I didn‚Äôt listen to all the haters from the start. I got this game on the cheap because I felt like it was cheap enough for the risk. And I‚Äôve gotten addicted. Yea the pay for private servers thing is stupid but who cares? Don‚Äôt pay for it? Stop being such a toxic community.
---
Yeah and call out anyone who just likes the game. Harassing people is never a good thing
---
Trust me all of this should be a good study.
---
Borderlands?
---
Most likely just a optimization issue. I‚Äôve noticed I crash a lot more in general on PS4 pro than on my Slim. Seems they can‚Äôt optimize the game right for a slightly more powerful console
---
no ur
---
There's more about you complaining than about the issue in your post.
---
Don't like it? Leave it.
---
Ah that part. Yeah that's fine. The important part is that enabling these practices leads to games that aren't as good as they should be. 0 hardcore players could note it, and it would still be true.
---
Don‚Äôt like my post? Don‚Äôt read it. That simple
---
Yeah, they are.
---
Go double check your notes. I ended up getting the rewards anyway.
---
The title makes it sound like you were a paid Bethesda employee posting in FO76. Very disingenuous.
---
I hate that argument. You're detracting from a legitimate complaint just to say other things are bad too. We know that already. That is still the same argument. It adds nothing. All it serves to do is detract from criticism for no actual purpose.
---
And the racism thing is a weird ass thing to bring up out of the blue ngl that is definitely not where I'd have gone for a simile
---
This sounds lovely, I‚Äôve still never come across a legendary hunting rifle. I have an instigating explosive dragon which is really good for a maxed out sneak crit, but the reload is, well, slow.
---
I dont have near enough to keep up with that type of demand!!
---
Why are we not calling them"PR *Synths*"?????
---
The topic seemed like you're sane. So I clicked it and had to read your dumb blabla
---
Your Xbox must be having issues, done it twice and no issues...
---
Not by me. I can't remeber the username of the person who made it :(
---
Who cares what the reason is when the point is still the same? FALLOUT FIRST IS A SCAM. If you feel like other things are a scam go address those. You can't tell people not to point out a scam just because other companies are getting away with it too.
---
Do you keep the unlimited scrap box when sub ends?
---
Can this event be completed solo or with a few people?  I mean those Fallout 1st folks have their own sessions.
---
Same. One night I visited 3 servers as a sort of quick test to see how many players have Fallout 1st. Min was 8 max was 13. I‚Äôm sure I can find servers with 0 or 1 but that was telling despite being an incredibly small sample size.
---
The people on the Board don‚Äôt care about meaningful updates. They want money and they want it now. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs a percentage of the player base that will pay them for anything and everything and there‚Äôs their new market audience. Fans of the franchise who are smart with their wallets are now being pushed out of this IP. RIP what Fallout should have been.
---
No we can't &amp; won't...just because we know it annoys you. Don't expose your buttons, people will push them.
---
I want them to apologize and make the game the fans wanted and expected to begin with.
---
I mean its pretty obvious ingame that it hasn't sort of sad that it hasnt been fixed yet
---
&gt;I never said that was ok. 
---
It sounded to me like you thought it was when you said "targeting lower level players has been a thing since multiplayer was an idea", but alright. In my book, systematically attacking defenseless low level players is much worse than going after premium members who are most likely also high level.
---
I actually think it's pretty funny that we have this scenario in the game now. Non-paying players going after paying players, and also vice versa. Sounds like it adds some new excitement to this otherwise shitty game. Yeah it may be trash to do so, but so is attacking defenseless newbies in Stranglethorn Vale. Like I said, in the end I'm having a hard time seeing the difference.
---
Server stability is an issue apparently with 76 servers so I think asking Bethesda to look into that is a valid question.  Not all disconnects are due to that but some are, some are just as you stated.  From an end-users point of view, it's often difficult to determine what was the cause of the disconnect.
---
On the other hand, I‚Äôve been accused of being a shill for poorly received games that I‚Äôve enjoyed over my years. 
---
It‚Äôs good to be skeptical, but blind cynicism can really sour an entire fan base
---
Sounds appropriate. üëç
---
you clearly didn't pay attention
---
It Just Works (tm)
---
I hope your principles extend further than choosing not to buy a video game.
---
I have a JE handmade On PS4
---
I misspoke when I said it sucks but it certainly a bit under whelming and it seems like it is being used as some sort of protest. Oh well.
---
This is a very widespread, seemingly random issue.
---
And how do you know that? Bethesda releases literally no statistics about their servers.
---
Children.
---
I know that somehow you think some facts are opinion.
---
Enlighten me on how facts can be opinions
---
lag and instability are part of online gaming.
---
I could spend the next 5 hours explaining to you how packet loss across a worldwide network affects stability and data consistency, but I dont feel like boring you all with technojargon half will only mildly understand, and the rest will look at as a foreign language. So here are some cliff notes.
---
Lag and instability pop up more when there are special events taking place (IE: Meat Week). Special events usually cause more playtime across the board (contsant players play more, casual players log in for the events more, which means more people on the network). This causes more packets of information transferring from client side to host side. When more information is transfered, more information is lost. When data packets are lost or corrupted, you get bugs, lag and instability.
---
Most of this has nothing to do with client side or host side system stability, but much more to do with local and national infrastructures. The more rural you are, the more hubs your data needs to pass through, which means more chance you lose data packets. The closer you are to a hub, the less likely you will lose data packets. This is why some areas experience a higher % of instability and lag issues than some people in other areas, they have more infrastructure to travel through, so there is a higher % of packet loss.
---
When a system experiences packet loss, and the packet is important data, then it could cause the game to crash, or lag, or seem "jumpy"
---
The game has gotten much better, but as is true with all online games, there will be instability when a new patch or special content is released. Devs dont have an internal structure to test the network viability of 100,000 users all playing at the same time. They test with like 10 people.
---
As an example. I also play Neverwinter, which had a huge patch this week as well. The boards were ripe with complaints about instability, lag, and disconnects. This is usually a very stable smooth running game. But a new patch came out, and everyone and their brother logged back in again, putting strain on the network. and OMG, lag happened.
---
This is a indusrty wide issue that has been happening in online gaming since the 90s. Everyone thinks its the game and the devs, but most times it couldnt be further from the truth.
---
Try packing \`100 pounds of dogfood into a bag designed to carry 50 pounds, then give the 50 pound bag an exit that purges half a pound an hour. You pour in 5 pounds an hour so what will eventually happen, is the bag will overflow and the system will stop. This in effect is what happens with lag. Albeit a bit more technical, but the theory is still the same.
---
Where is the event and will I get good rewards with the skeleton costume?
---
Lol, yeah, right.
---
Negative shills are usually sent after succussful competitors. Which Fallout 76... isn't.
---
Ongoing games have to turn a profit to be a viable concern though, right? It's the video game industry, not the video game charity. 
---
You said it yourself -- the game underperformed.
---
&gt; So when that revenue wasn't good enough, we decided to charge you more instead of dipping into our massive pockets to bring you a product with adequate standards.
---
Yeah, they could try and support it themselves while continuing to lose money, but all that ultimately means is that the game would get canned. An ongoing game that is an ongoing drain on the company's finances is not going to stick around for long. That's business. 
---
But I think maybe you don't understand what Fallout 1st is -- nobody is being charged more to play the game. It's an entirely optional subscription for some new in-game services. 
---
The game I played last month is exactly the same game I'm playing this month. It's had zero effect on my gameplay experience. 
---
So while I don't really think Fallout 1st is value for money and have no interest in subscribing, whether or not it exists has zero effect on the game I bought and paid for.
---
sounds like you have a Dell G5 lol
---
To be fair... I did the same and purposely looked for scrap boxes... I didn‚Äôt count but the overwhelming majority had them along with a fridge and collectron... 
---
Some have posted false percentages... meaning those not liking it... it doesn‚Äôt add up at all. 
---
Faux outrage by YouTubers literally trying to make money quoting others trying to make money and just plain disgruntled players that either uninstalled the game or worse didn‚Äôt play the game at all... yeah... I‚Äôm not buying into that at all...
---
No idea. But if it is you are correct. Very petty.
---
In the French translation it's one per day
---
ESO isn't that aggressive. Mtx are definitely there but I never felt like the stuff I bought wasn't worth it. ESO is definitely leagues better than F1st
---
You can‚Äôt really hunt people in this game, it requires pretty specific circumstances.  I feel theres a bit of fibbing on both sides of these stories lately.
---
thats dope! how did you do that?
---
If true and it has a high probability of being true then the players have voted with their wallets.
---
If players are paying then they obviously want it.
---
I have addressed many of these points many times on reddit, most recently [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dmyt17/abstaining_from_the_game_until_this_gets_sorted/f586163/?context=3).
---
Publishers absolutely are greedier and scummier today than they have ever been. And the inflation argument doesn't exactly hold up under scrutiny.
---
Steam and [itchi.io](https://itchi.io) are not publishers in the conventional sense, and nothing I have said should lead anyone to believe I'm against platforms such as those. I don't see how those platforms are related to the slippery slope of games' increasing monetization.
---
&gt;perhaps other MTX and subscriptions are what is necessary for games that want have things like online servers that players can enjoy. 
---
They're not. That's the big lie AAA pubs have brainwashed into gamers. Plenty of games in the past and present maintain online servers without roping you into post-launch monetization. These scummy monetization practices are largely only conducted by the big publishers. Why? Because they care about profit ultimately. That wouldn't be a bad thing necessarily, IF they also were genuine about making good games. But they're not. Monetization dominates game design on the big publisher level (to varying degrees admittedly, but as an industry that's the direction).
---
"We need F1st money so we can fund F76 dev." 
---
LOL So, Bethesda releases a broken game, lies about mechanics, doesn't include highly requested features with the promise of them coming later, and doesn't make as much money from the game as they hoped. So instead of ZeniMax putting more money into development to bring the product up to the standards promised, they're going to have the gamer pay for it (who already paid $60 expecting these features...).
---
It's laughable. "We fucked up, and you're paying for it."
---
I have only been met by positivity reguarding my subscription to 1st to try it out. Even drop my tent for others to use after an event if they need to.
---
No, I'm just going to make the best of a bad situation. Stocking up on flux since it'll be there anyway.
---
I don‚Äôt have enough need for a private server, so if scrapboxes go free I don‚Äôt need to subscribe.
---
Is that the one where the icon is a screaming cartoon face, facing right?
---
It's for the assault rifle, just go to atom shop (under the skins tab) and equip it. :)
---
Honestly I think they‚Äôre bored... many games do that and people can‚Äôt connect... maybe they e done all the quests or have gotten frustrated doing them... I get it... they should move on and find something they like... instead they keep on talking about things they don‚Äôt like... weird...
---
Assault rifle, see atomic shop unlocks
---
I'm still willing to play. Not sure if I want to get 1st, for multiple reasons. Chief among them is that I've already spent $60 on the game, and I don't have confidence that the developer will fix the issues already present. I'm still having fun, though.
---
I was legit considering purchasing Fallout 1st on the assumption that I would be spending a hundred dollars over a year on the atom shop anyway, so getting $16.50 a month actually made it seem like a decent deal for me.
---
Then I logged in and was hit with constant framerate drops and crashes and changed my mind.
---
I‚Äôve been trying to articulate this forever and people just say ‚Äúno, I have good internet, the problem is with Bethesda‚Äù. Hope people read this and understand what you wrote.
---
&gt; each negative comment could be as well
---
I have seen people saying they haven't bought the game but they hate it.
---
first one is for the assault rifle
---
then 10mm
---
then minigun
---
then combat rifle
---
then (combat?) armor
---
finally clothing item
---
Hoping it doesn‚Äôt happen too much buy I‚Äôll sadly not be surprised. Guess I‚Äôll just get 50 minutes to pvp whoever nukes it..
---
Can you cite any evidence to that claim?
---
What metric of goodness are these games purported to be ruined by this support measured against?
---
The event is at white springs. I‚Äôve only done it once so far, got some new Halloween themed plans. Currently wearing fasnacht mask and witch costume dress.
---
Didnt get the workshop dlcs are you sure theyre talking avout what youre talking about
---
People spent $30 to protest people spending $15? That's sticking it to the man!
---
I mean, that just sounds like you're not well equipped enough to complete the event.
---
Sometimes that's all there is to it.
---
Only time I experienced issues was a while back doing the queen and all the weapons caused a huge lag... that was it... I consider myself lucky
---
Its the one every YouTube who's demonatized sponsers
---
That type of crap is what caused r/FO76FilthyCasuals to splinter off from this sub.    It also seems to be in direct violation of Rule 9.
---
It's easier just to blame the devs.
---
I run a 1H melee &amp; Semi-auto Rifle hybrid build, I have 5 rifles on me:
---
AAE Lever - General use
---
FFFR Handmade - Mobile targets
---
VFFR Tesla - Crowd control
---
Instigating Gauss - Sniping
---
Instigating The Dragon - Instakill unaware targets
---
Thanks for this! I was about to have a mini heart attack. I though my game was glitched as I did my challenge last night.
---
Headwear can generally be found in the chest next to the quest start if youre looking for some variety.
---
This happened to me on my 2nd event, then wouldn't let me respawn. Closed the game after waiting 15 minutes only to load back in dead and falling through the map forever with no option to respawn. After my sixth or seventh log in trying to get a living non falling start i landed alive in the northern part of the savage divide.
---
They are already downvoting it, because facts and science is bad.
---
meh doesn't bother me - you should avoid naming players tho for stuff like that - just a etiquette thing.
---
Is it a game where you're a 2nd class citizen? Asking for a friend?
---
Because teams help you place?
---
Is this a surprise?
---
Radation damage. Ghouls, super mutants, and most mutated bugs are resistant to radation damage. Unless there was a change im not aware of.
---
Man I wish I could get paid  defending this game.
---
rewards are the same as long as you have a costume to trigger the last drop
---
If that becomes a thing, I would actually wear mine.
---
Having the same issue. I'll report this to Bethesda.
---
Now battling other humanoid characters with the gamma gun should prove deadly.
---
I would never have assumed nor implied that saying "targeting lower level players has been a thing since multiplayer was an idea" sound like it's an okay thing to do.
---
You're also assuming that people who purchase 1st are likely high level.  You have no data to support that and I would wager a bet that there are plenty of people whom are level 1 and playing for the first time today are also the ones who purchased 1st right out the door.
---
You're trying to compare normal PvP environments with systematically attacking certain players based on them spending more money for something that give them no advantage over you.  You're having a hard time seeing the difference because it seems like you were bullied playing online games and feel that it's ok for you to do the same to other players.
---
Lmao.
---
Depends on what you want.  It's pretty much like mashing up Firefly and FO:NV.  Of folks prefer dialog instead of action it a winner, kinda "meh" otherwise.
---
Life pro tip : when buying 'le gaming laptops' or desktops for that matter DELETE ALL THE BLOATWARE!!
---
I just don't understand why you are okay with Fallout 1st. What is your breaking point with this game? I legitimately want to know. With Pete Hines lying about the atom shop being cosmetic only, with this game launching in such a state where Bethesda had to cut the price after a couple weeks,  as well as Bethesda using the community as an excuse to break their promises, I mean who asked for more non-cosmetic items to be added to the atomic shop?  If they were really listening to the community they wouldn't have released Fallout 1st in the way they did. Instead they are just whale hunting because I doubt with all the negative press this has gotten not only will this not attract any new players but also divide the community even further. I hate the fact people are attacking Fallout 1st members. I want this community to grow and this game to get better but the thing that is hurting it the most is Bethesda.
---
I think we can all agree that trying to figure out which people are shills, if there even are any, will just end up being a bunch of random people getting harassed for liking a game on which they are in a group for.
---
Is there more info available? I don't play NW as I'm pretty shit at it, but I'd love to unlock that Pumpkin Combat Armor paint. When/where can I do so?
---
Tough to say as I have several 
---
BE auto handmade (primed) is rock solid.  My AAE auto handmade is a close second. 
---
Love my Quad auto Combat Rifle with FFR.  Have a Vampire version similarly equipped with FFR. 
---
Also have a Bloodied and Vampire auto Railway Rifles both with FFR.  Toot toot.
---
Bloodied Gamma Gun with FFR is interesting.
---
And of course, the typical cheese cannons like AAE Gatling Plasma and Quad auto Tesla Rifles. 
---
Almost forgot the Quad Fletchettes Harpoon that‚Äôs a blast.
---
I think it's mainly people who already owned the game but uninstalled
---
I rarely have issues with mine. Aside from from a few disonnects, I've never had any game breaking issues.
---
I just considered myself lucker than most.
---
For $60 there are thousands of gaming experiences I could choose from. I am spending $400 to experience Death Stranding. (A decision that was not a light one to make.) 
---
But in this instance I want to have the experience of roaming the wasteland of the fallout universe, occasionally bumping into or teaming up with others around the planet to create and take part in hundreds of little stories and micro events. I feel that 76 presents exactly that with what it delivers in a launch price of $60. The 157 hours referenced in the OP was to illustrate how much time I have spent with the game vs how much of the in game content I have actually interacted with to this point. 
---
As a fellow professional creative, along with my somewhat libertarian viewpoint, I also believe that no one is obligated to make or do anything for another. So when someone chooses to spend THEIR time creating something for me to experience that I thoroughly enjoy I believe they should be compensated accordingly. There's not a lot in the world that can give me 157 hours (with hundreds more to come) of sustained enjoyment for an investment of $60. That's why I think it's perfectly acceptable for additions to the core experience to have an added cost in relation to the work that others are doing to bring me these opportunities for more and new experiences.
---
*can I add that I really do love the discourse on this platform more than any other? Y'all just are so much smarter than the real world. One hundred fire emoji
---
I know that since I‚Äôve deleted the game until wastelanders comes out, they‚Äôre gonna add the fog machine back in that I‚Äôve been wanting to get. I‚Äôm just surprised they haven‚Äôt, it‚Äôd be a huge seller.
---
&gt;When a system experiences packet loss, and the packet is important data, then it could cause the game to crash, or lag, or seem "jumpy"
---
What I find more fascinating is why in 2018 they designed a game that uses UDP for transferring important data.
---
First, I'd prefer no DLC over what they have done now. Anyway!  
---
Bethesda kiiinda implemented the atomic shop for that purpose. If it doesn't generate enough, I'd reccomend that they changed to resonable prizes. Buying stuff in the atomic shop is ridicolously expensive. If they had better prices I think a bunch of people would actually buy stuff they wanted. 15 people buying something for 1$ is still more than one person buying for 10$. Anyway!  
---
I get it, servers costs money, but selling it as a bundle is so annoying. It'd be fine if they made this a special deal or something and allowed players to buy individual parts with atoms or allowed players to purchase a server only for less. I'm not really qualified for fixing bethesdas fuck-ups, but I am not satisfied on how they handled it. I know I can't just complain or whatever, but if bethesda really is that low on funds, just cut fallout 76 and start something new. If not enough people bought the game, that's no reason to make the ones that didn't buy for the remaining. They should just cut their loses or something.   
---
You're not a good guy for buying the subscription. You are only letting bethesda know they can do that anytime and you'll buy it. Fallout 76 deserves to fail. It got pushed out prematurely and absolutely nothing about it went well. Bethesda did everything cheaply, unsafe and just straight out lied. If we don't stand against it, we will just get worse and worse games.    
---
Now, I play fallout 76 everyday basically and I absolutely love the game, but the game does not deserve to go on. No matter how much i love playing this, it's more important for the next ones to not be launched prematurely and be filled with microtransactions and bugs. Probably not the response you want, but we need to stand against it.  
---
If they want to add purchaseable stuff, fine, but making it have a huge impact on the game is  not the right way to go.
---
I have completed this event many times before with the exact same armour, perks and weapons with only a single death or 2. Those times I spawned close to the drop site, on the border of the blast but I was only getting a couple rads a second. This specific time I was getting respawned at fissure prime in the middle of the blast zone and dying almost instantly since unless  you have infinite radshield and Radaway or can run fast enough, you will die and respawn right back where you were.
---
Whatever gets the player base up. Maybe they will realize how fun the game is lol
---
Ik, it's irritating.
---
I been attacked for wearing my ranger outfit but getting people to hunt me down is a hit or miss. I have my map icon at the fallout 1st logo and have notice other plays getting closer then usual but my perception is high enough to see people coming with my exploding assassin dragon at the ready
---
The problem is, unless you have definite proof, you're just alienating your fellow gamers. And that is just as damaging to a game we all actually want to like.
---
Candy bowls outside if doors with hand code things.
---
Then boxes full of forks around the lawn
---
See my other comment about OP's rifle.
---
They certainly do. Nothing Bethesda introduced effects my gameplay or forces me to drop real world money. All Atoms I spent were earned in game and I have zero interest in subscribing to Fallout 1st. Once I'm forced to buy something is when I'll tap out, break any connection to 76 and move on to something else. 
---
I find it odd when I see posts of people claiming to uninstall the game, swearing they'll never purchase another Bethesda product and shouting "boycott" all while subbed and posting to r/fo76. It's wasted energy in my opinion. If you dislike something this bad then cut all ties to it. Make a real stance with diminished attendance.
---
I doubt Todd has anything to do with Fallout 1st or really anything going on with fallout 76 these days. Too busy focusing on their upcoming games like Starfield.
---
Yeah it's pretty easy tbh.
---
Yeah probably üòÄüòÄüòÄ. Playing many games but something like this ( crash to start screen) only with fo76. I am not heater or something like that still playing but it is a shame.
---
I‚Äôve got 600hrs under my belt and now I am well and truly done. I‚Äôve been bored for at least the last 100 hours. There‚Äôs only so much legendary farming one can do. 
---
I might do the Halloween event, and then that‚Äôll be it for a while. 
---
I have Outer Worlds now and I‚Äôm really enjoying that. 
---
I‚Äôll come back to fo76 one day. Maybe.
---
There atleast responding to our crys on eso. As i went to try to login again seen on the bullitin there working on it now.
---
Been playing online games since 2001 and agree with you 100%. I can remember back when I played WoW, you would have that one person who always had lag and disconnects, but back then we understood it wasn't Blizzard's fault that he had bad internet. Nowadays everyone instantly blame the Devs
---
You've tried the best, now try the rest. Spacer's Choice.
---
EA got caught doing this a few years back. 
---
The paranoia that this sort of thing generates is exactly why it works so well. These companies are really scummy and underhanded. We can't just assume anything positive is a paid astroturfer and they know it. And if we do go full scorched earth, just condemning everyone as a shill, we damage the community by chasing away good people. It's frustrating as Hell.
---
Why cant we just have nice tings?
---
is this only a reward in NW then? And what are my goals to get each of these?
---
A bunch of them are even stating they never a got the game.  Pretty sure the game for very vocal chunk of the sub is just spewing poo and FUD.  It's like some bizarre forum griefing.
---
Can confirm..
---
Was doing the event earlier at Whitesprings and laughed to myself when the bug triggered.
---
In the meantime, "pLz CaN wE hAz MoAr MoNiEz?"
---
We were going there yearly. But since it was featured on Ellen, the traffic in Ceredo is horrible! It takes approximately 3 hours just to do a walk through of it now.
---
I don't understand how anyone can still support this game.
---
 That's not much. What do you roll?
---
Because this is the best thing that‚Äôs happened in my life, also making my day.
---
Yep first thing I tried last night after my hat was taken off, very disappointed
---
I enjoyed the game from the start.  Sure, it was buggy, but I still had fun.  I kept with it because they promised private servers and I wanted to play it alone, as I did anyway.
---
When I saw the announcement for Fallout 1st, I deleted it from my xbox.
---
I mean, not like they can do anything to me unless I shoot back. And that‚Äôs *if* I decide to get out of pacifist.
---
Thank you!
---
Wish I could answer but, i can't even get past the first step without freezing. Doesn't help everyone &amp; their mother is using two shot explosive weapons.
---
I just got a Clean Spaceship Helmet from the event
---
I've been wearing mine since day one (unless I'm doing a challenge or in PA) and I've yet to experience ANY negativity. (on PC). I think it's just mostly fake news to try and discourage people from playing.
---
Also, if no one did like the game why would they play it, and buy crap in it? Would hate to torture myself through a game
---
Takes one to know one.
---
I AM DISABLED AND FALLOUT 76 IS IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE...
---
Every fucking time.
---
Could always go crazy with workshops for events.  Used to love doing that before they made them more pvp "friendly"
---
The game can be fun to play if you make your own fun or have friends. Me and mine would grind the SBQ non stop most days to get perfect gear to trade or sell. If you ever got a IE,BE,TSE,or JE weapon on ps4 throught trade it's likely one we sold or traded away. Even now part of my friends still keep nuking everday,
---
But the fun you have with your friends doesn't count as game fun. I could play most any game (like Dayz) with them and have tons of fun. The story of 76 is not have bad but too short for a online game, ESO has a campaign that takes around a month for most working people. The game lacks content for day one players to stay interested in, the updates such as vault raids which are meant to help this were so useless due to bugs.
---
I don‚Äôt really understand it but it looks wordy and honestly I tend to trust experts. Damn if it isn‚Äôt annoying
---
Yeah, I got the short suit and I'm curious about this.
---
Yeah he‚Äôs not factoring in the 50% of the fan base who see absolutely no problem with lying, under delivering on content and overmonetizing. I think he‚Äôs giving the community too much credit.
---
Except the harsh opinions are facts, you got fucking played. The game is a buggy mess. They put everything the players asked for behind a 100 per year paywall and you IMBECILES fell for it and keep paying for a BAD game. Even making you pay for things that were originally for free! People like you are why we cant have good games because sheep will continue to throw money at broken pieces of shit.
---
They dont give a fuck about you dude. Theyre waiting for you to go away, just like ubisoft with ghost recon breakpoint.
---
Yea it's gonna be a good case study one day. That and i'll put it in my thesis paper maybe
---
The fact that you refer to criticism as hate, answered your question. You should ask yourself what Bethesda has done to not earn your hatred. Or ask why people are so full of hatred for this company. Because Bethesda/Zenimax gone above and beyond what even gamers are willing to put up with. And we have put up with a lot. The fact is, *no one wants to hate this game*. Or any game. Another great game to play is what every gamer wants. But Bethesda are doing everything to make us hate them. For the few people who simply get off on hating things? Fuck 'em. They never have anything to say worth listening to. The people making empassioned pleas are the ones who want to love this game.
---
It's all a matter of how much you care about things that don't affect you, personally. the real test of objectivity is understanding why people dislike the thing you do.
---
And people can enjoy it, but they have to understand the ramifications of supporting it.
---
Reddit is astroturfed to hell and back and people know it.
---
Hasn't happened to me yet.
---
The 121 damage still goes through. Just the 50 or so radiation damage is ignored. You can totally kill ghouls with a gamma gun.
---
Similar here. Not that long, but fast travel loading screens are randomly double and triple time as usual.
---
Ok so do I only have to wear a hat? Do I get better rewards for every costume piece I wear?(Hat/outfit) And what is the piper coat listed?
---
I'm pretty sure ESO is Buy to play like 76 is, unless I missed something which is possible.
---
I guess if you are a high-level a lot of the people around me kept dying from the robots, myself included.
---
Didn't help that someone just nuked t
---
he area so there's a bunch of bloated ones.
---
There‚Äôs boxes of forks around the pathways, just interact with them! The effect is delayed
---
I've not been attacked yet while wearing my ranger suit, but if someone trys I got a bunch of 3 star weapons with high damage on stand by for them.
---
Like cancer?
---
The real cause of lag.
---
auntie cleo's ftw....fuck spacers choice
---
That sounds an awful lot like shill talk to me.
---
You need 14,000 xp in one day to get the glowing skeleton costume?
---
Xb1 üòî
---
You either have to own a workshop to take damage in pvp or attack them back after being hit.  That‚Äôs just normal play style, not really hunting someone down for being a member.
---
Swear to god dude, its actually trash.
---
Ahh so it is a Sony thing for their dev kit. Xbox doesn't suffer from that issue.
---
its SUCH a different game though. they aren't anything alike AT ALL. and i enjoy them...BOTH!
---
I found looking slightly down at the ground will help.
---
I love it, at least whenever it works. The strain it puts on the xbox one and one s is ridiculous. I've only gotten rewards from 2 out of the 5 times I've done it, since it crashes near the middle almost every time
---
I‚Äôd say mtxs, subscription AND paid DLC are about as aggressive as you can get without pulling a rockstar and making an intentionally unbalanced game and then sell you in game currency, or making you pay to progress like mobile games that only allow you so many levels per day, but those games are at least usually free.
---
Only problem I've had with the event (attempted about 7 times now) is all but twice my game has locked up. It's great fun but I can't play it because of the hard crashes...
---
To quote sergeant arch dornan from fallout 2:
---
"Mor-on!"
---
Originally I figured it was to keep folks from making inaccessible bases, like how they removed fast travel mat early on.  Can't guess why it's not added since they nuked base griefing and changed workshop cap area.
---
Ghost Recon Breakpoint, Metal Gear Survive, Fallout 76, Anthem, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Battlefield V, Far Cry 5/ND, just off the top of my head. I could list everything wrong with each of those games, but I don't care enough to spend the time to do so for a reddit debate, and surely that information is easily findable should you desire to know why those games aren't as good as they could be.
---
You can tell when monetization determined a game mechanic. I'm not saying all monetization is bad: I think For Honor, MHW, and a few MMOs hit the model very well.
---
But many games that pursue live service/monetization are designed with that in mind and it inhibits the player experience. Literally, game mechanics are made against maximizing the player's experience, so that the company can sell the "solution." No gamer should support this. We can understand it, yes. Companies want to make money. But we shouldn't be handing it to them; not when they create the problem simply to sell us the solution.
---
MTX, lootboxes, P2W, they're not necessary to keep the lights on or even turn a massive profit, that's the big lie the AAA pubs love to spread. Those mechanics are the lazy way of making money in gaming. Again, they are companies managed and owned largely by business people, they're going to go for it. But we shouldn't enable them.
---
While some companies do genuinely pride themselves on their product, it's not a requirement. Activision, ZeniMax, EA, Ubisoft, Take 2, etc. don't give a fuck if a game is good on its own merits. All success is measured in profit. Developers may care about reviews, but at the end of the day all the publisher wants to see is their financials in the black, and as far into it as possible with all else being damned. Gamers are all too eager to abide.
---
r/Iamverybadass
---
Yep.  I see posts accusing Bethesda of splitting the playerbase, but the players in this sub do a good enough job of that on their own.
---
Breakpoint is fucking garbage and the ubisoft investor call shows that everyone knows it.
---
Gangrenous always have yo.
---
Calm down, friend, and have a Zero Gee - it's the ale for what ails you!
---
Oh god don't feed the idiots that say nobody is allowed to enjoy the or they're a fanboy or shill.
---
Red Read Redemption?
---
I don't think it is broken in that sense. It can just be a pain to get if you don't have a decent group of people for the event.
---
Did we just become shill brothers?
---
this. i loved the george clooney batman movie yet im lambasted for saying so. i just liked it, felt like a live action comic book, shitty puns and all.
---
Seems to also be the case on xbox
---
Just happened to me.  Launched as the event started.  Leave or die, I left and got no reward.  Pretty funny I guess but a total troll move by whoever launched.
---
Gain 250 XP in NW. 
---
Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the only, but there aren‚Äôt any others available as of right now
---
Im positive most of the atom shop stuff is stuff they made for the raider faction in wastelanders and they're just selling it off to us in the mean time. Looking at the screenshots you can actually see they're wearing a lot of the atom shop items.
---
Buddy it happened on mine and my console is perfectly fine, it's 76 for Christ sake. An easy solution to this is just to login again quickly however.
---
Thanks, also there are others?
---
I am having a hard time staying positive about Mischief Night. I have attempted the event twice now, and each time I have gotten killed and had the game drop me from the server. When I load into another server the event is finished.   
---
So, 0/2 - awesome event, Bethesda! I won't even whine for server stability because fuck me for still playing, right?
---
Probably was a highly requested faction to be in earlier games
---
Nope neither are morals
---
[The fact you can run a Minecraft server on half a gig of ram and a 3Mbits up and down network connection.](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server/Requirements/Dedicated#Unix_.28Linux.2C_BSD.2C_Mac_OSX.29) That's less than any game that allows self hosting in the last decade. I mean just look at Minecraft and look at Fallout 76.
---
Roll? Do you mean legendary abilities or my type of armor. What's yours for having an idea?
---
It worked every other time!
---
Although it wasn't fallout 1st every other time...
---
You don't have either of those. Nice cope though. Denial is part of stages of grief.
---
yea ESO is b2p , they get away because all they really balance content and stuff added to the store which is usually just houses and casual outfits.
---
Hey things don‚Äôt have to be *good* to like them!
---
To each his or her own.
---
It's just themed items? Like everything else that is in the atomic shop? The themes rotate in and out. Next is chinese.
---
Actually it is. If there is 4 crashes during same event and between none then it is not connection. So, was playing 4 hours, everything ok then during this event crash, crash, crash and crash and then unable to rejoin event. So please stop talking bs. People here talking about P2W but you people actually are paid to defend BETH just like that. Use that time to make this shit work.
---
Yeah. Log on, take Hemlock for the Acid, Munitions for the extra ammo, Power Plants for cores... Then runs west Tek and black water for steel, lead and plastic... Loaded for about a year of play in just a week
---
The other day I posted that I felt like I was the only person that didn't have the subscription (because I see the emotes so much). Some reason i was downvoted. Not completely sure why though.
---
This a Shill RP thread? If so here is my crack at it:
---
Bethesda did nothing wrong.
---
I'll play "Spooky Skeleton" for you B. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Yep, there was an endless machine gun noise after a scorched beat fight. The day they fixed it.
---
Sooner or later they will find all the causes... probably?
---
yeah everyone knows they exist. But the contention that Bethesda is employing wholesale troll farms to make the game look better is still ridiculous.
---
Wait really? Like confirmed?
---
So armored raider skull mask works? If so, I dont need to do anything when get back but play the event
---
Nah been gaming since the early 80's. Common sense? Since when has Bethesda ever done something that *didn't* drop kick our better judgement? You're just guessing. You're literally making things up. We have no idea how many weapons will be added. Let alone if existing weapons will be, as you put it, obsolete. They could all be rebalanced (ok that's a longshot I admit I smirked when I said that.) Obsolete for what, though?
---
We have what they told us, but Bethesda have been proven habitual liars. So the entire expac is up in the air at this point until we have it in our hands.
---
The part that frustrated me wasn't even that - if you bought the VSDG it's printed literally as a base CAMP thing.
---
Then they should leave. Online communities are not all they're cracked up to be. 
---
This passion hits people one of two ways: 
---
\- They find a hook in something, positive or negative, that resonates with them and amplifies their own feelings towards the game. 
---
\- It poisons their view and enjoyment of the game, either temporarily or irreparably. 
---
It's not worth being a part of a community if it lowers your enjoyment of something. Period.
---
Not sure why I play anymore. I love the game but it feels like a chore. But during these times I log on for the Atoms and to get some junk (or murder 12 queen's or so)
---
Wastelanders being delayed so far was harsh
---
Yeah, the Canadian dollar isn't any better, either.
---
Lol I love how everyone is either a troll who never played the game or a paid shill all of a sudden. Guess what, before the patch this sub was filled with people who loved and played the game and I'm gonna hazard a guess most of them still do. Why are people acting like praise of the game is what's coming out of left field here?
---
I‚Äôve done it a couple of times this evening on pc.  The last time got a little laggy - not terrible though.
---
Side note.....with the vehicles all blowing up, I reckon BGS missed a trick not getting one of the robots to shout ‚Äúyou were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off‚Äù in a cockney accent.
---
Eso forums is the same, it's so blatent and cheesy.
---
1/1 on completing so far, suck majestic chaos.  How do you trick or treat?  I just blew stuff up.
---
No, shills are an abomination.
---
Ad Victoriam
---
UPD is a good choice for game data like position updates because late or out of order data is better to just be discarded and interpolate to your next received data. So if you don't need those features which TCP provide it just becomes more overhead.
---
You can still implement a light 'reliable message' system for UDP for the specific data that you do need to get past packet loss.
---
Bethesda mentioned they cribbed from the Quake netcode, so take a look at this if you want an idea I guess.
---
https://fabiensanglard.net/quake3/network.php
---
I disagree.  To many places making laws against them.
---
I doubt you have a degree in mo bio
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Cardboard boxes during last phase close to middle oflast area
---
I didn‚Äôt say that you were against them, I was saying that there is more competition in the market place now for games than there were in the past. 
---
And I disagree that they are more greedy than they were, but I honestly don‚Äôt feel like turning my free time into a research paper to prove my point I‚Äôd rather be spending my time playing the games I enjoy. It‚Äôs video games.  
---
And I disagree about the MTX/Subscriptions piece. Everquest, World of Warcraft - those games charge for subscriptions.  The sign of the end times of any MMO in the past decade was the point it went Free to Play. Look at what happened to Everquest - even though it originally survived WoW, now it‚Äôs a F2P game with a ton of P2W transactions in it.  Guild Wars was originally a great MMO with only an upfront cost... and as time went on they had to add in services like extra character slots and cosmetics. Diablo 3 *tried* to fund themselves with the RMAH. Players pushed back, as a result none of the seasons stuff that‚Äôs been released has even been remotely interesting.  
---
I can‚Äôt think of a single game I‚Äôve enjoyed that survived for any length of time where the game company themselves hosted the server for multiplayer, for free, that didn‚Äôt have any type of IAP or other MTX.  
---
And even if everything else was true - there is no other game that gives me the experience that FO76 gives me.  My options are play the game that I‚Äôm enjoying, having a great time with my buddy, with lots of things I still want to complete...or not play?  And they never lied about the subscription - I‚Äôve posted it many times on here the past week - they told us before the game was released what the deal was going to be with the servers.
---
Bloodied shotguns are regenning again too.
---
I try to own the ammo depo but public servers is a hassle o switch to private less fighting
---
Pretty much according to data miners. It's still a guess, but there is Chinese skins in the code now.
---
Yes the wholesome people should leave and let this sub become a cesspit where nothing positive is ever said/s
---
and all the quests and fo4?
---
Try again. I did not say all criticism is hate. I specifically specified those whose hatred is as extreme as the love of fanboys (i.e those with hateboners). But since it‚Äôs negative, those opinions are counted as valid, when any support (let alone fanboy levels) for the game is treated as being invalid at best and corporate shilling at worst.
---
If it took more than one shot... you weren't using a Jakobs!
---
I still can‚Äôt believe that this game doesn‚Äôt have some form of VAC. I mean TF2 has it, and the coding for that game is just spaghetti held together with rusted paperclips.
---
The number of variables need to be considered here before saying it‚Äôs Bethesda‚Äôs fault. 
---
Any tech troubleshooting this fully from controller to Xbox to routers modems inner wall wiring, outside wiring, area wiring service provider just to name a few... a combination issue? 
---
Sure it‚Äôs easy to blame Bethesda but what about all the people not having issues? 
---
That‚Äôs why if I was troubleshooting this I wouldn‚Äôt say Bethesda‚Äôs fault since most don‚Äôt have an issue so you have to look downstream from that. 
---
Your ISP could be a huge factor and areas that share connection at certain times can have greater issues.
---
Thank you üëç
---
again, and all the quests and fo4?
---
However true that may be, we don't know if you're correct, in this instance.
---
Thanks :)
---
up close yeah, but most pvp is done at nearly max bullet render distance, and damage dropoff is a big deal so you need to maximize your damage to compensate for the distance. up close its all about fire rate.
---
........................................................................................................

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
... go sit on a cactus.
---
You made an absolute statement. That's not questioning anything.
---
again again, and all the quests and fo4?
---
What the actual fuck I hope your joking
---
I really want the long one
---
The real reason for F1st. Lol
---
I wonder if thats why we have an invisible iconed "communist salute" that was added to the atom shop for free a little while ago
---
That doesn't mean weapons will be obsolete, though. They could add new weapons that are equal to the ones we have now, or hell, they could all end up sucking worse. we don't know yet.
---
solid troll.. this will drive the other trolls crazy..
---
well played
---
Unlimited mod access with Fallout 1st. Calling it now
---
You could, but should you? If you have a dedicated minecraft server with 24 players spread accross the map with a fairly large render distance i practically guarentee the stats would be similar.
---
And lets be honest here, server usage or minimum requirements stats aren't especially important, the dude wanted a multiplatform game with servers you could host yourself for free, I got them that.
---
And before you mention it - yes, I know hosting even low end games like Minecraft isn't "free" however, the server software is, which is useful if you've already got a server set up for whatever.
---
As a fallout first subscriber, that's a terrible idea and I hope its troll bait.
---
I like it too. I think this whole thing show how Gaming communities are just one step away from getting toxic. I remember this subreddit being all about reporting bugs, demanding solutions from Beth about some pesky ones (PA bug), screenshots and experiences. It was good.
---
Then, the bombs came. Even if you agree or not, it's a fact that death threats have been spilled, you cant say anything wuthout getting mass downvoted and 5 guys shagging your mom and so on.
---
Ill keep playing, but its kinda sad.
---
This notion of PR shill accounts is unfounded and Bethesda would never do that! I mean this game isn't perfect but it brings joy to so many people.
---
However, for those of you not entirely happy with the game, are you sick and tired of the grind and endless inventory management? Have you only ever lost in life and want to taste that feeling of winning?
---
Try out Fallout 1st. It'll make your gaming experience less imperfect. 
---
You've paid for the best, now try the rest. Fallout 1st. (Yes, nailed it!).
---
 Oh I'm running BoS Heavy Combat mostly, I have a Trapper Unyielding in there too.
---
 I'm at 280 412 27 these days. I have 5 Mutations that add to that.
---
Is this on PC or console?
---
that's what she said.
---
I edited the hyperbole of "all criticism" out of my response. That was a stupid statement on my part.
---
As I said, if you're only talking about the ones who only get off on hating, screw 'em. Report them and move on. They aren't worth an argument because that's all they want.
---
So it's treason then.
---
just those 6 from the datamine, we wont see for a few days until the challenges unlock
---
Got the first challenge completed, but nothing else shows up....
---
Cool, I am not the only one. Got to play the event twice so far and server kicked me after a few minutes each time.  
---
So. Much. Fun.
---
Thats some juicy bait if I ever saw some
---
Fallout 76‚Äôs first true dlc :Class Warfare
---
*cough* *cough* totally not a befesda employee/die hard fan. 
---
Btw no game perfect and no game is true shit except cash grabs and false games description like Crystal Adventure by CIRCLE Ent.
---
They are adding a reward daily for the next few days.
---
I hope modders chose not to mod 76 since those mods will fill Bethesda‚Äôs pocket being more of a benefit to them than the community
---
Ya got me
---
An ideological conflict of this magnitude can only be solved with blood.  
---
Shills vs Haters, black-powder pistols at dawn.
---
I also play neverwinter :D.
---
But I feel alot of the instability and crashing is caused by damage, either recieved or given, that is giving me the majority of my issues. 
---
Too many people in one area, with weapons that do far too much damage cumulatively. Ime this is when the health regen starts kicking in. I wouldnt be suprised if health display was calculated locally then sent to the server, which sometimes struggles with multiple damage sources, causing the "healing" that is being displayed. Its not real healing, just less damage than it had originally calculated due to some loss.
---
*bethesda really disliked that*
---
The event mechanics are *meant* to include a nuke zone.
---
We the community have found a way to cheese it, but that doesn't distract from the fact it's *supposed* to take place in a nuke zone.
---
I'd see the 'fix' as requiring the site to be near the center of the nuke.
---
They are scrambling to determine the next PR blunder to address the current PR blunder.
---
Has anyone got more rewards? They are bugged for i think.
---
It's also a fanbase that'll know that any popular suggestion that they make to improve the game will come with a price tag.
---
Might as well start adding price tags to any feedback we give to Bethesda to shame them for their dodgy practices.
---
Happens to me all the time, White Spring Station is another vendor that crashes me constantly.
---
They are kind of like EA. Every few years the CEO makes a public statement about how they know what they are doing wrong, and they need to do better. Then they go back into hiding and double down until the next public statement.
---
Wow, I have a mix of everything dew to one of my armor pieces having 90% reduced weight on weapons and mostly all my armor pieces being legendary.
---
Well I know where to expect all the nukes from now on
---
How many times you planning on posting this here for karma?  
---
I mean, its a good build, but thats the exact same video you posted here 2 months ago, which was a tweaked version of what you posted 7 months ago
---
it‚Äôs back to normal for me (pc), how about xbox?
---
do you not have your perks stacked or are you not going for headshots? I usually see 1600+ for headshots with my instigating .50 HR
---
I agree with you on no spawning in a rad zone. But here's a question and an observation. Should there be any consequences of death? If not, why not; and if so, what consequences? The observation: Respawn timers on public events start at 3 seconds and work up to 20 with multiple deaths (I know what you wrote above, but that is an error on the game's part). If you are getting up to the 20 second respawn regularly, it's time to analyze tactics, techniques, and procedures. I'm not saying "git gud," but some reflection is in order.
---
Sounds like something a shill would say *narrows eyes*
---
Edit: /s
---
The secret about the Brotherhood is that the abomination was insude us all along. In other words--death is a preferable alternative to being a durn brotherhood member
---
I mean that's my plan but how do you know what most subscribers will do?
---
I got tht on my first go in the event today.
---
This is the reason I always look at the one and two star reviews on something I really want. Is it common? Does the seller/manufacturer rectify the problem? Was it on the delivery people? Don't trust five star reviews unless there are a ton of them.
---
No you're right. Not all positive comments come from PR shills. I'm sure some of the positive comments just come from idiots that refuse to see what is as plain as day in front of them.
---
I dont know but I got the bats paint aswell but I'm not sure if it's only for certain weapons or not I was planning on putting it on my handmade but nope
---
The point I'm trying to make is why spawn someone in the middle of the nuke zone if they died at drop site v9. Why not just respawn them at v9 and save them the hassle
---
From what I heard from someone in a group I play with, who I started playing with recently, is that the +250DR isn't bugged if it's the second legendary effect. I cannot confirm or deny it, that is just what I heard.
---
So far we have 2 ps4 hosts. I‚Äôll update you if we get other people that want to participate
---
I've liked each of the menu screens for their own thing but it'd be nice to be able to either pick which one you want or randomise it between DLC/content seasons.
---
To keep them in the event.
---
This so much. Allowing for blatant flaming under the guise of ‚Äúblaming shills‚Äù leads to witch hunts. Witch hunts often lead to bigger/worse witch hunts.  This is why most reasonable places of discourse ban them. 
---
They often come down to whoever shouts the loudest and whoever has the easiest message to resonate with.
---
A lot of people like fallout 76 because it's a fallout game they can play with friends, others just find the gameplay fun. The main reason this game survives (at least imo) is because there's no real competition, it's the only game of its kind, at least rn.
---
Same. I don't want any special treatment. The Atoms and Scrap Box were already more than enough to sell me the subscription.
---
Subscription basically replaces the other two. You get access to all the DLC while it's active and get free microtransaction stuff.
---
I play because I like playing with friends, plus the trade community isn't really replicated in any other game. I also like survival games like NMS and Dayz. Also because it lets me be a wastelander unlike other FO games
---
They're not bugged. The challenges are being released one a day. I think it says on the menu, when ya load into the game.
---
&gt;And I disagree about the MTX/Subscriptions piece. Everquest, World of Warcraft - those games charge for subscriptions.
---
I believe I said in my linked post and this thread, I am not 100% anti-monetization. I am anti-monetization when it clearly negatively affects the integrity of the game. MMOs are the original live service, many of them get the model right. The problem is that model of recurring revenue is being forced onto games that weren't build with that in mind.
---
And Warframe is F2P. Destiny 2 is F2P. Apex Legends is F2P. 
---
When did GW add a subscription? Was it less than 1 year after initial release while the game still has stability and content issues? I'd guess not.
---
And where is modding? Didn't BGS say modding would come eventually? I guess they haven't made enough from the Atomic shop to justify letting users fix the game and add content themselves.
---
What if wastelanders NPCs will only be possible on private servers? Essentially making it fallout first exclusive.
---
I still like the Fallout 1st addition.
---
It's a fashion faux pas to wear both glasses and hats, all fashionista know that.
---
I mean you gamble by not publicly stating that all the shill posts are paid sponsorships too
---
What about the gameplay of Fallout 76 do you find fun? Surely there are ‚Äúhundreds‚Äù of games to play with friends. 
---
Is it the Fallout world that you all enjoy or is there a specific aspect of Fallout 4‚Äôs gameplay loop that‚Äôs addictive 
---
(Not being sarcastic, just looking for depthful answers)
---
The atomic shop. It‚Äôs there. You just can‚Äôt access it due to a ‚Äúpayroll glitch‚Äù. These things usually sort themselves out. Make sure to leave your stapler....
---
They completely fucked my entire account so if you can play with the characters you‚Äôve had for a while consider yourself lucky. I have totally given up on this game in the last month 99% of it is because of what they did to me prior to this goddamn subscription bullshit. I was a die hard player since the fucking pre beta stress test but they are beyond forgiveness.
---
I take only the first reward.
---
Almost like a statistical standard distribution is useful....
---
If anything, I feel like 1st subscribers should get a pop-up "The location for your camp is occupied. Would you like to start a Private Instance on this server, move your camp for free, or try another public server?"
---
Now realistically, Im pretty sure most the uproar has come from people who dont play the game as there is a huge number of people I see in game now with the 1st subscriptions, infact i think when i looked yesterday i had 6 friends online, and I think all 6 are now 1st members, so its wildly more popular than this sub would have people believe, if I had more money I probably would be too as it is quite a good deal all things considered, I just dont like that the scrap box and tent are not free
---
I like the survival part of fallout and building my own camp, the community in game is one of the most wholesome one out there. 
---
I pay for certain atom items or fallout 1st because i got my money worth out of it and i don't mind spending some more if it offers me more content.
---
The current outrage doesn't really bother me, i mostly ignore it and just play the game when i feel like it.
---
I think it may be a real life vault-Tec experiment.
---
Its only for AR
---
It's kinda greyish. I like it. Reminds me of a ghostbuster suit kinda.
---
The Atom shop??
---
&gt;You're also assuming that people who purchase 1st are likely high level.  You have no data to support
---
I have no data but I sincerely doubt that most subscribers would be newcomers to the game. I also read a lot here on the forum and from what I've seen so far there have not been many (if any) newcomers with a subscription.
---
&gt;it seems like you were bullied playing online games
---
I used WoW and Stranglethorn Vale as an example because that area was infamous for its ganking. But it was part of the game, like you say. Which is why I never blamed the players for doing it, but the developers for making it possible. I wasn't "bullied". But thank you for the analysis, Dr Sigmund Freud.
---
I don't know why you seem to think that Fallout 1st players belong to some kind of special protected group that no one can be mean to in the game, or attack for fun or simply out of sheer boredom. When low level players are systematically targeted in WoW you call it "normal PvP", but if someone wants to kill Fallout 1st members for fun you accuse them of ruining the game.
---
And how would someone get into this line of work?
---
Saltuna. Melts on your fork, not in your mouth!
---
Amen I couldn't agree more. I can't wait for a time machine to go back to the pre 2010 years of glorious gaming üò≠
---
Nice one, feel free to message me on Xbox once you're on!
---
I think you move past the "all but" part and just quit. 
---
Doesn't have to be forever. Come back to see if Wastelanders is the saviour people are hoping it is or the dumpter fire as seems to be the only thing Bethesda can do of late.
---
Scrap box was imo too far. It should be avalible in game. 
---
I could get behind the tent being a consumable that gives you almost the same as 1st, but maybe it decays after like an hour or something.
---
Yeah? And how does every other game with servers keep them up without a sub? Most even without a MTX store which 76 has.
---
Is there a list of all the outfits that count towards the mischief night?
---
I'll be on PS4 tonight. I actually have a haunted house going in the ash heap, feel free to drop by all
---
Look bud. I've been here since December and I need to say this if you wanna cover 76 on a video.
---
The game? Is nor perfect but it's incredible fun to play, even though it has bugs but I don't see many same with disconnects I don't have any.
---
The community? Awesome, incredible, just beautiful people wanting to have fun with the game. We even have our own currency, the 5.56 ammo dew to the caps limit.
---
Why we spend money on the game? Well look, as I said I've been playing since December and I don't buyed a single atom, and I have genuinely half of the camp items and a few skins by just playing.
---
Pay to win? HELL NO. The game is far away from being pay to win, the kits are useless, the bot is useless, the fridge is useless and the subscription barely gives you an advantage with an unlimited scrap box because you obviously need to fill that box right? The tent, you can help everyone with it, it's accessible for everyone.
---
So my friend. Is fallout 76 good? Of course, but mediocre at the same time. 
---
You should talk good about the game? Well play it and have your own conclusions, level 30-40 is the minimum for having a good perspective about the game and talk with facts not with the things you heard on a video game journalist website.
---
So, hope to see you more around here &lt;3
---
Good that's the best use of money, most of them truly appreciate our support and show it in their games.
---
My bloodied handmade has this. I'm still looking for a replacement and when I get it I'll either scrip it ( probably not ) or have it gather dust in my stash hoping one day I can use it as it was meant to be used.
---
One year and counting.   And yeah - why do weapons still drop with this modifier? At least erase them from the drop pool.
---
I enjoy the game, simple enough.  I've played since launch and it fills that "hunt, scavenge, survive" itch.  I've bough things on the atomic shop to make my dwelling pleasant, the lore is pretty interesting when you can put the puzzle pieces together in your head, other players are generally nice (super good community!), and the map is damn fine to explore.
---
At this point I keep playing to min/max my character and farm low level legendaries to give away to new players until Wastelanders update comes out.  Its enough for me to kill an hour or two every day, especially with a busy work schedule.
---
I didn't see that anywhere, but it could be true. This post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm7y0g/nuclear\_winter\_paint\_unlocks\_by\_level/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm7y0g/nuclear_winter_paint_unlocks_by_level/)
---
shows that you need 14,000 XP to get the glowing skeleton costume. There is six rewards. If that means you need 14K XP in one day I'll be shocked if anyone who isn't a hacker gets one.
---
Mobile gaming somehow slipped everyone‚Äôs radar and picked up so much p2w steam that it is currently too big to fight against in many regards. 
---
Companies like tencent want a big stake in mobile for two reasons:
---
1.) they can cheaply incentivize you to share some social media and then harvest personal data. ‚ÄúLink to Facebook for $10 of ingame currency‚Äù is worth it to them 10 fold. 
---
2.) they can milk rich whales who want to believe that their victories come from ‚Äúskill‚Äù rather than their credit card.
---
Source:  I have fit the number 2 and paid into  mobile games a few more times than I care to admit.
---
I just kind of assumed they are lying regardless already, and brace myself.
---
Ceasers legion should have ur ass on a cross
---
Why so triggered?
---
the mental gymnastics you can see in this sub are comical. I really would not be surprised if most of the traffic this sub gets are from cringe hunters.
---
I love fallout76, but when I hear people actually payed for Fallout 1st, I couldn't play anymore. Then I heard the community was actively attacking Fallout 1st Subscribers, it made me so proud and immediately went back to playing.
---
My internet is fine... It's high speed and I don't live an area where disruption occurs a lot, I love 76 but hop off Bethesda's dick for moment.
---
Nice try George Clooney.
---
Oh, don't be confused here, I am not ok with the subscription. As I said earlier I got the 1st month then canceled right away because comparatively the ranger armor and the 1650 atoms for $13 was acceptable. The private server, tent and scrap box are just extra for 30 days and I wont be renewing those. And I have not bought any of the other non-cosmetic things like the fridge, scrap bot, or repair kits. So the best I can do is "vote with my wallet". I am willing to pay for some things, and I hope my purchasing history shows Zenimax (Lets be honest, these decisions are made by them) what I do and don't find acceptable.
---
I'm sure the rank and file programmers do. The management however, are the ones making the bad decisions. I'm willing to bet the real developers are just as upset at the way this was handled.
---
What do you mean "all the quests?" There was a story line, that carried you through the series of events that led to the Scorched Plague being released. There was a small swath of raider questline, but it definitely did not make you play the part of a raider.
---
My husband got that on his first play of the event today, i got the fireman uniform. I'm sure after this event, the price for the jumpsuits will jump. Lol
---
I think it is always in the 3rd slot.  It's a risk you take if you roll 3\* weapons.
---
I've made it to rank 106 with pure melee. [Here's](https://streamable.com/h2mfk) a slightly old match.
---
Ok so right off the bat Melee was recently indirectly nerfed, directly buffed, then stealth nerfed without any log in patch notes.  Of this i am certain. 
---
Currently Melee is better than it was but it's also harder at the same time. With the nerf to stealth boys melee has an extremely hard time soloing a squad. However now melee is more reliable loot wise as large crates finally have a melee drop out of them, whereas before there was absolutely no chance at all.  These two new weapons the polehook and the supersledge were op. With just a perk loadout there WERE oneshotting on normal attacks.  This has since been stealth nerfed and requires 30% bonus damage from some sources to oneshot on normal attacks.  They still oneshot on running attacks.
---
 Running attacks for the most part are your bread n butter for melee. However it costs a crap load of AP so only expect one running attack before you run out of AP.  Fury is your best friend hoard it, steal it, do whatever it takes to get it. You need it. 
---
Once you have your oneshot ready melee becomes all about decision making.  Not so much skill.  Where to position, when to go in, when to be patient. This comes with experience with flanking mechanics. Flanking is all you do with melee. You always have to fight on your terms or you run away. 
---
Besides Melee hit detection being absolute garbage, and frogleg spammers the bane of your existence melee works fine.  I average anywhere between 7-12 kills if i pass the early phase and get my oneshot working. 
---
Perk loadout is clubber, martial artist, incisor, marathoner, run for your knife, pharma farma, bloodymess.
---
Your goal is to find a grog axe, polehook, or super sledge and a couple fury or pschos.  Try to mutate and get twisted muscle. Pharma farma will help you get radaway after mutating.
---
I dunno how this game could possibly reach an eso level recovery when every patch either re-introduces old bugs or makes them worse like you said. Reeeeally makes me wanna see what development on this game is actually like.
---
Is NW the oooonly way to get the glowing skelly costume?
---
Yes, i bought this so Todd can lie to me
---
both sides are being petty and spiteful. i found a few posts,commented on one, that started playing out of spite because people disliked fallout 1st. calling others immature smh. doing things out of spite IS. pot calling the kettle black.
---
Sounds like you have an issue with Bethesda and anyone saying other wise is wrong... right... enjoy the lag and disconnects!
---
Ps4 i want the halloween pant suit already have the orange pipboy if u got it and want to trade/sell for caps message me on psn please DADDY1723 !!!!
---
I feel that was the plan with this timing.
---
You‚Äôd serve yourself better by finding someone to play the game with you, show you the ropes and formulating a more informed opinion. There is no shortage of YouTubers just spouting their opinions on a game they‚Äôve never played. Don‚Äôt be another one.
---
 Mine all are too. a couple of Chameleon makes the Combat Knives more fun. My main weapon. :)
---
lmao
---
It's not? An MMORPG is "An online role playing game in which a VERY LARGE number of people participate simultaneously" I wouldn't call 24 players very large at all. Normal MMORPG's support hundreds of players at once. Sorry. 
---
Fallout 76 is just like Rust or Ark it's a multiplayer survival game. You can try to label it otherwise as much as you want but it still won't fit the definition of what an MMORPG is.
---
I carry a VE railway rifle, VFFR handmade, BE combat rifle, primed B10 LMG (or B10 .50MG), and a SE pipe gun.
---
Weapon weight legendary armor is your friend, as is unyielding (with a low health build) with deep pockets mods.
---
My starting loadout weight with high cap backpack is usually about 195/375 pounds with all of those guns plus some food and 100 or so aid chems.
---
If they put Wastelanders behind a paywall, they can keep it.
---
I just love the Fallout world and lore. Gameplay is generally good. Playing with friends is cool too, but I mostly play solo.
---
It's pretty much the same thing as Fallout 4 (which I loved) except with a new map, locations to explore, and new stories, and that's how I play it. Even with its flaws, it's still fun and it's still a Fallout game.
---
The upcoming Wastlanders update should make it even more like a true Fallout game.
---
Good
---
Wheres the lie?
---
After how many years of fighting Zenimax though? Remember when ESO launched? How they locked an entire race behind a special edition? Back when it was box+sub+cash shop. I mean it's better now, but damn it took a year or two before they got their shit together. I remember half of my character's skills didn't even work for the first few months.
---
Sounds fun
---
True, which is why some are moving to call these behaviors gambling.  Which it should be. 
---
Sadly, there is nothing legally that prevents a game from just pricing product accordingly (instead of using gambling to crowdfund) if these behaviors are labeled as gambling. 
---
(Bad) Example: 
---
If my mirv is a rare drop from a fallout chest versus being 1/100 in $1 chests versus outright costing $100 it makes no impact to Bethesda‚Äôs bottom line outside of the money they make on the low money gamblers (my next $10 will surely get the mirv!) ‚Äî which is actually non-negligible. So maybe prices go up for the whales - but it is still a small hike.
---
Oh, for crying out loud.
---
Your drama, is soooooooooooooo **boring** right now. How's *that* for justification?
---
I have the ranger armor and no one has attacked me. One person did PM me and ask me to model my armor for them. Tourists.
---
Opinion: Fallout 1st was introduced to help keep all future story content free
---
Only because you don't understand the phrase "pay to win".
---
Sorry, you're gonna have to explain that a bit.  
---
You want me to step away from a product that I paid for that was never delivered upon?
---
 You are just confused. Still I guess its your turn to be outraged. ;)
---
But that's not really keeping them in the event. In fact that's just alienating them from the event. You may be "cheesung by doing it outside the zone but realistically like it has been mentioned before that juat gives players who play no power armour builds a fighting chance at actually being able to land a hit of a substantial amount of damage onto the queen. With them spawning in the nuke zone you're either trapping them in a death cycle, isolating them from the event till event spawn RNG puts them close to the zone borders or leaving them with such low health or in a vulnerable state to where they get taken down in a 1-3 hits from scorched minions.
---
Isn't it more accurate to say "That's not questioning that particular concept."
---
But not really, since my statements were not absolute. Did you misread the word "probably"
---
Yeah unfortunately, all those, and all the ones I got in total, didn't include any of the .03% drop rate ones.
---
I am pretty sure the money from the Atom shop keeps the servers on and pays for the devs and the profit justifying the continued existence of the game.
---
But their budgets are all their own and not publically available
---
Diehard fanboys willing to support Bethesda for anything Fallout related even if it‚Äôs bad. If everyone just said no to fallout 1st Bethesda would have to look at it and reevaluate but unfortunately that isn‚Äôt going to happen.
---
*I‚Äôm not dissing fallout fanboys, I am one or was one until recently.
---
Good for you. You should doubt it.
---
Your original comment is so full of misinformation and factually incorrect statements that trying to argue with you would be a literal exhausting waste of my time which would have no conclusion and no positive benefit whatsoever. 
---
As I said you clearly loathe video games and sincerely believe all the BS in your original comment which is both sad and scary. 
---
Take care.
---
I've always thought bicycles would work.  There are a bunch laying around and it would be fun riding them through Appalachia. Just make the speed a bit faster than sprinting.
---
I bought it specifically to annoy you. I even added a note to my purchase: ‚Äúhugs and kisses; love, Specter229‚Äù   
---
I want Bethesda to know how much you support them.
---
Hey I wasn't playing then, so at least you got to do it
---
All it will take is one scorch beast queen fight for him to have had enough.
---
Lol you have problems...
---
Funny how smooth you think it‚Äôs running for subscribers and how many extra bugs they added for everyone who doesn‚Äôt subscribe.. if shorty performance and bugs bother you, you‚Äôre going to need to find a different game to play for a while
---
I think most of these decisions come from Todd Howard himself.  He went from this nerd (I mean it in the best way possible) that loved creating masterpieces to this Tesla driving, leather jacket wearing, name dropping douchebag.
---
So a bunch of opinions?
---
Yeah its one of those things like, im sure most people, not everyone but most wouldnt have minded having to pay for a server, it was kind of expected since when mods come out they would effectivly kill the atom shop so making people pay for the servers garuntees they still get money, but there wasnt a need to give people the scrap bx and to a lesser extent the tent, like, the atoms is a good enough incentive cus you think "oh brilliant, i get the private server i pay for and I get some atoms"
---
I think it's pretty simple. They have every idiotic fan base. Why would someone pay an extra 99 dollars to a shit company that has lied time and time again just so they can keep the multiplayer going that has been proven to be buggy and glitchy
---
Fuck, wheres my check Bethesda??
---
Rewards are shite.
---
All the costumes look dumb. 
---
Best costumes locked behind pay walls. &amp; now common as muck.
---
No fachnut masks as I'm sure I read there would be.
---
We were told there would be no additional costs.
---
Yeah you only need one but it's fun to use a variety plus it makes it a lot easier to manage ammo if you're not using one kind.
---
Shillception.
---
I honestly don't have much of an issue with that at all, I know that some people's internet connection is a major factor to server crashes. I don't hate on Bethesda for no reason. I've played many titles and yet, 76 is the only one that crashes (occasionally). Everything is fine in regards to my Internet, sounds like you have an issue with people blaming genuine problems with the game on Bethesda... Am I wrong?... Enjoy looking like a clown in the forums! ü§°
---
I think Bethesdas awful and 76 is a mess but there is no way this is going to happen
---
Absolutely love it!
---
Absolutely love the private/personal servers too.
---
As an older gamer, with kids (including a 21 month old) I find it far more enjoyable to hop into a world and not have to worry about speeding to get to this even or that event before its over. I aslo like to be able to go full hoarder and enjoy the experience of grinding for materials.  I still play private/personal and public. I personally think a lot of the crying is coming from people who haven't tried private/personal server play.  Eight (total) people can still play on your server.  It's litterally a whole different game playing privately. 
---
Almost everybody I've encountered has been nice or helpful. The players as a whole seem great. This sub, sadly is as toxic as a high school.  Which make no sense.  All these posts about unistalling and hating people who payed for something is rediculous.  People here think they are the only people who play fallout 76.  Very comical.  
---
My five cents on the game.
---
&gt; I cannot for the life of me figure out why anyone actually bought the fallout 1st subscription.
---
Put it this way.
---
How much is the 1650 atoms worth? About $16.50. How much does the average outfit go for on the shop? Between $5-$10? So for $13 I can get a sweet outfit and some atoms, for less than their comparative worth.
---
To me, that seems like a worth while deal, so I got the one month and wont be renewing.
---
I feel I am not in the minority on this.
---
"from what I've seen so far there have not been many (if any) newcomers with a subscription."
---
Just because you dont see them doesn't mean they're not there.  I would wager that there are far more people that have the service and are brand new than people that are on here that you read from.  Furthermore, just because they're not here on reddit doesn't mean they dont exist.
---
Most online games are "famous" for higher level players sometimes ganging up on lower level, it's a risk you take when you play.  I'm dont think 1st players need to be protected, I'm just saying you're trash for wanting to single them out to attack them simply because they purchased a service you didn't.  Asking for them on here like that is what makes it shitty.  Defending the ability too makes it more shitty.
---
You seem to act like you were bullied by whining that you were always ganked because you were lower level.  Using your logic, are you saying developers should make it so higher level players can't kill lower level? What's the cap?  So if I'm level 100, what's the lowest level player I can kill? What if a lower level player tries to attack me? Can I fight back or would that cap prevent me from defending myself?
---
According to patchbot: realtime.
---
This is the deal for pretty much any device I own. 
---
"No, thank you. I don't want to pay you 25 euros to 'set it up for me' when the first thing I'm going to do is format and install a fresh copy of (OS of choice)."
---
So you're saying fallout 76 has the same level of depth and content and as many players as an MMORPG? Most MMO's these days don't even have subs so why would anyone associate them with subs?? 
---
And yeah it is outrageous? Again unless you're saying that fallout 76 has the same level of content as an MMORPG. 
---
Good luck arguing that lmao
---
So you're a STR build? It's pretty easy to accumulate rounds when you don't/barely use them. But if you aren't lucky enough to get one of the few OP weapons, you'll be burning ammo like crazy. You see, this is your problem. You assume 'pay to win' means you can't win at all, otherwise. That's not true. Everyone can win that boss fight. The winning comes from how easily you can recover to do it again. And having infinite scrap, is well, INFINITE resources. In a game based around resource management. You literally review the management part. How is that not pay to win?
---
But the game doesn't end with that boss. That boss can be farmed forever. The real game. The bulk of the game. Is scrapping and building and questing. And all of those things become exponentially easier with Fallout 1st.
---
It's not the best choooooooooooice, its Spacers Choice!
---
Or, a basement/bunker because I‚Äôm sick of totally not meshing
---
So basically a usual experience at The Whitespring when I‚Äôm bored but with a crappy one star spitting legendary, some decorations, and the chance for plans I already have, or a slim chance for plans exclusive to this event.
---
Glad my Playstation Plus membership expires tomorrow...
---
I miscommunicated, I wasn't clear enough on expressing its probable that many will
---
Agreed. I think they are going to adopt the eso method. All future dlc will be free*
---
*for 1st subscribers, and you can use the atoms from the sub to pay to keep access if your sub lapses.
---
Absolutly. I had expexted to pay about 8 dollars, since thats what I pay for my realm on bedrock. 
---
The extra incentive wasnt really needed imo.
---
Nope, Acer Predator G3-571.
---
Alright, so, first of all I love you Halo videos. Just wanted to get that out of the way. 
---
On to your questions, yes, I still play it. I just genuinely have fun wandering around. I do the same thing in New Vegas and 4. Sometimes you need to take a walk in the park down the road from your house, sometimes you need to take a virtual walk through a post-nuclear wasteland in your office, you know? And there‚Äôs still new players in the game. I enjoy helping them out. Giving supplies, helping with quests, that type of stuff. Plus, some of my actual fiends are still doing the main story, so of course I‚Äôll play with them. The scenery, especially in the Forest and the Mire is beautiful. Kinda like New Alexandria. Just...stunning for me. Sometimes I‚Äôll set off I one direction, and find out that in my 157 levels that there‚Äôs still a location or two that I haven‚Äôt discovered yet because of that. 
---
As for spending the money? I don‚Äôt *need* to. But I want to. I love Fallout, I love this game, and I want to see it do good. Everybody saying ‚Äúvote with your wallets‚Äù do have a point, but it could be a dangerous point. What if Bethesda gets so little money from this game that ZeniMax decides to just cut it? While I don‚Äôt agree with everything, I do agree with paying for future content. The big DLC is free, and the only way the DLC can even be made is by having developers. Developers that also have families and themselves to take care of, so they have to be paid somehow. 
---
And is there a little love-hate? Yeah, of course. I used to have a pet deathclaw at my camp. He was a happy guy; just kinda stood in the middle of the road looking at the Overseer‚Äôs camp. Make a bunch of new players scared until they realized that he wasn‚Äôt attacking anyone. Somebody even needed to take a picture of one for a challenge, and thanked me in a few stimpaks because they could use him for it and not be in danger. But then when Patch 11 went live, he disappeared. Right in front of my eyes, just clipped through the ground never to be seen again. I still haven‚Äôt gotten another one since...
---
But, the player interactions are great. Sometimes I‚Äôll just sit at my camp and somebody will come up, saying they like my house. We‚Äôll get to talking, and if they say they‚Äôve been spending time looking for something and I have that thing, I‚Äôll probably just give it to them. Mutations, modded power armor...if I can make somebody happy in game, I will. That makes me happy. I‚Äôm doing my part to help some compete stranger have a better time.
---
That was the tutorial, the rest of the quests had even more options regarding who to side with, what objectives to complete and how to complete them. That‚Äôs before even getting into play style choices. 
---
New Vegas gave you a tutorial with choices and lasting consequences. 76 had you boil water.
---
How about no.
---
Well ... I triggered a few people. None of whom gave an actual logical answer.
---
I predict there's gonna be a lot of these threads (like 5 already) if we don't get some more info on how to get them.
---
thanks for the reminder to login.. 7 minutes till the halloween event!
---
It's pretty obvious at this point that it won't be fixed, after they have announced it has been "fixed" for the 12th time in a row.
---
It's not the best chooice...
---
In the first season of Torchwood a cannibal was asked why he commuted his heinous crimes and his response was ‚Äúit makes me happy‚Äù.
---
No one told you to read it.
---
It‚Äôs at the top of the hour like meat week at WS

---
You're right. I'm confused as to why anyone would spend money on this subscription.
---
Uh, you can rename them.
---
ESO is an MMORPG. 
---
Fallout 76 is not an MMORPG. Are you saying Fallout 76 has the same level of content and depth as ESO? 
---
Also "you're whole shit makes zero since" is that misspelling or is your english that bad? I'm assuming you meant "Your whole shit makes zero sense" shit meaning the discussion on this post I assume?
---
Soon as I have a shower im jumpin on. NW first then prolly go adventure maybe private after a few hours/overseer wins.
---
....You‚Äôve been able to for months now.
---
They are? Where‚Äôd you see that? Link?
---
That‚Äôs impressive organization from a fractured community if true. I‚Äôd like to see it.
---
Personaly i wish they would place a marker were that area would be uncampable by anyone if someone on the game was camping there and the marker would show up while players were offline.
---
Yeah same, I pay ¬£8.63 for my minecraft server, which is a very fair price for a private server IMO
---
No that is literally all the quests have have any real outcomes. You can convince the Khans of a great deal of things but that has no real impact or effect on the game. In most outcomes they sit in their compound until the game ends. Only in one or two do they show up for a few seconds in the final fight. A minor change that does nothing.
---
um.. you cant?
---
Coming soon exclusively for fallout 1st subscribers!! :p
---
Umm... we can... Have been able to for months.
---
This one wasn't too bad, just had to shut down cortana and get rid of the acer "gaming" apps.
---
In regards to "cant expect new content to come out for free forever." - my 2 cents here:
---
First, Bethesta stated that all FO76 future content will be free. No subscriptions.
---
Two, take any random game, for example Minecraft. You bought it once, you get it for life with limitless updates. No extra payments. And has private worlds/servers. Works for a lot of games to be fair, maybe not to the extent that Minecraft does, but still. 
---
Saying what Bethesda are doing to be the right approach to monetization is like saying that slowing down before a turn is unnecessary. 
---
If you don't slow down, you'll go on a jolly painful ride down the hill. And Bethesda is just speeding up towards that turn.
---
It doesnt annoy me at all it just makes me wonder. Also do you wanna buy some beachfront property in Nevada?
---
Good luck, people have been trying to explain this shit for a year now.  
---
Everyone assumes that if they disconnected and they run to reddit to complain and someone else says they disconnected at some point that day then it's obviously Bethesda's shit servers... and not just the extremely likely odds that if you have a large enough sample size of players across the world that you're likely to have any number of problems occur between their different connection and Bethesda's servers that can cause someones connection to drop during the course of the day.
---
Message Bethesda support, usually they only need a screenshot, the character name and account name. This happened to me last week, after messaging them and then giving them the above they awarded me the missing atoms. Hope it gets resolved for you!
---
Whitesprings, near the golf club
---
scrapbox shouldnt exist at all.. tent should be free
---
Whoa, how?  I've never seen the option in my pipboy?
---
Honestly I just wanna know how anyone justifies this to themselves.
---
I KNEW IT!!! This type of comment would appear sooner or later, but it's actually funnyüòÇ
---
I stayed away from 76 until a few weeks ago due to the hype and bad publicity. My first night playing it made me regret waiting so long to pick it up. Sure, it's got bugs and it's not like the other games, but I'm having a really good time with it!
---
I can only play the other Fallouts so many times before they get boring and 76 gives me a HUGE map to explore by myself or with a friend if I wanted. While I do miss the conversations with NPC's, I know Bethesda is going to make it right in a few months. A lot of people claim it isnt a true fallout game, but I disagree, its still Fallout, just in a different form. 
---
The community, the quests, the huge map and most importantly the lore keep me coming back.
---
There are a few spots on the map that if you use it right you can have a basement it requires using the ramp foundations as the outerwall then snapping a normal foundation to the bottom side , most of those spots are in the toxic valley though there is a few in the bog also.  Also I think there is one or two in the mire but honestly I forgot where I saw them just that they were on the east side.   
---
It would be nice to have an actual premade that cuts through the world but I am guess that would be a lot of bullshit they just don't want to deal with.
---
Then get off this sub simple as that.
---
I made them angry.
---
OMG
---
dud ive been watching you for years now, i doubt you remember but i remember i was in grade 7 (im currebtly in grade 11) and asking you for advice while you were streaming Halo 1 in the library. 
---
To answer your question, I pre ordered Fallout 76, played it for a couple months all day everyday. I absolutely loved my time with it, yes there were bugs but everyone loved making small problems seem bigger then they are. 
---
I bought the E3 atom shop pack which came with Elder Maxon's coat from Fallout 4 and 1000 atoms. Pretty good deal, i had already saved up a few thousand atoms. I came back a few weeks before nuclear winter and continued the grind of trying to make a good build, i decided to swap to no power armour and melee. In case if you arent aware there are plenty of benefits to not using power armour and perks to make it possible. Then Nuclear winter came out and i played that until i got to level 32 and then just moved on to other games. Every once in a while i stop by and check out stuff. I absolutely love building my camp. Im waiting for the wastelanders update to get my 76 on. I want to build a raider camp or something, anyways i always stuck through the bullshit. The community can ne pretty bad sometimes especially now with the release of the private servers, i will be paying for them once they add the stuff they said they are working on for private servers. 
---
People need to stop complaining, i get Bethesda mislead everyone but its not like this subscription is harming anyone, its a crazy good deal for what it is. Id pay that price for just the servers alone. I think its great that it comes with an outfit and 1650 atoms. I cant wait to return to 76, i miss it so much.
---
Anyways, i cant wait for Halo Infinite to come out and watch your videos on it.
---
Ps love your voice no homo tho
---
That's not my favorite song, ADA.
---
All of whom are mad at me now.
---
Add in frostbite debuff - if you don't travel back to a camp with fire or go inside after x amount of time you are hit with Slower run speed, faster degrade of stamina, possible chance of freezing up (as if you were being frosted by a Cryolator). Would be interesting..
---
5000 hours??? That's more than it took me playing and finishing every Bethesda game ever released since the 90s.
---
So if the money from the atom shop keeps the servers on and pays for development of the game and profit and justification for keeping it on...
---
...what is the sub needed for exactly? 
---
I wonder how every other online multiplayer survival game with servers manages ü§î
---
Lol you're dumb. I buy whatever I want
---
Nah, I beaten the queen several times and I don't have enough
---
I carry three rifles.  Instigating Lever action, Instigating Fixer, and AAE Handmade.  The Lever action one shots almost every non legendary in the game. Instigating, in my opinion, is the most underrated Legendary attribute in the game.  I average about five-six shots for non legendary scorchbeasts.  Almost never touched anytime I do Westtech or Golf Clubhouse.  Headshots on SuperMutants at Westtech do about 2100 damage a pop when sneaking at night.  Chameleon mutation, all weightless BOS armor, and always sneaking, all headshots.  I'm crouched 90% of the time.  For Encrypted, I'll one shot Gutsys until someone activated the Pylons, then 700 damage per shot on the combat inhibitor.  For SBQ, I clear all the Scorched horde and let the PA players work on the Queen.  Free range is pretty easy solo, about ten shots on the Sheepsquatch, he refills health, rinse and repeat. Glass cannon, though.  VATS dependant.  All hail Gun Fu.
---
"How can we turn the fallout franchise into a bottomless cashgrab sham?"
---
Inspect the power armor. On PC open your PIP-boy, hover over a frame, hit X to inspect, and then rename it.
---
This was a great and thorough answer :) the type I‚Äôm looking for!
---
It doesn't seem to be always though, because the  guy that I heard this from was talking to another guy in the group who had it in the second slot on something. I'd ask for a screenshot, but I have other things to do, and would rather have it fixed than prove that it's only bugged 95% of the time.
---
I think you need to reevaluate your definition of dumb.
---
True. Also just slightly tweaked from the one 7 months ago.
---
That means their plan is working. They want to the game to die.
---
I named mine "The Pale Rider". Because I got the 4 Horsemen skin.
---
Good to know it is delayed! I clicked on them and nothing happened so I thought I was doing the forks wrong. haha.
---
Fuck I really putted 5000? üòÇ I meant 500
---
I guess
---
Ah I see. No worries. I retract my earlier argument then. My apologies.
---
You are the greatest, sir!
---
I reckon Id nail 14k in about 3-4hrs give or take
---
Ok in fairness, the scrapbox should just be a feature of the STASH, but you get my drift
---
Okay, I see the bait here. Either that or you‚Äôve never played the game.
---
I pay for the sub and before that I bought atoms so shitposters like you can have free dlc.
---
They should be included with the base game, and not be 100 dollars a fucking year...
---
Almost always yes
---
Now that's fixed, 5000 hours holy shiet, imagine that many content XD?
---
M
---
Nah, i factored all that under "miscellaneous expenses". Lol.
---
I did not buy the atom shop nonsense because it was several dollars for blue power armor paint. The prices on everything were silly, make the most expensive things like 2 bucks (200-300 atoms). Let me buy out entire categories for 100 bucks. Do not charge ten bucks for stuff we all know is a skin on an existing model. 
---
Go for volume not price gouging and leave the dang game mechanics alone. No exclusive game mechanics for atoms make everything unlockable in game that changes gameplay... youvv Can use atoms as a shortcut who cares. And for sure never break perks, a darn feature of the game, so you can support grind mechanics to sell repair kits. If I equip a perk it better work, that is core gameplay not a money grab feature.
---
Pair that with a game that is flawed at the best of times and it is a recipe for widespread anger. I vote with my wallet, my free spendin gun gaming dollars go elsewhere.
---
It also hurts that fo76 was a game I wanted to play for hundreds of hours and I think my total time was around 50 at most with half of that waiting for something or other (loading, server connects, recovering from bugs, trying to trade with people in a broken interface).
---
Thanks. I dont know why other people would rather get angry than have a logical reason.
---
Heck yeah! I love the scout stuff!
---
There isnt. We arnt forced to spend any money. Its just an option for people who wants to
---
It's terrible on console (ps4 pro) worse frame rates I've experienced since my crappy PC 10 years ago lol
---
14k xp from NW in one day! If thats true this is a perfect example of why people hate on this game. Is that even realisticly possible to do in a day!?
---
Because players were supposed to be the NPCs, but we were too nice to each other and raided less than expected. This was the real comment by Todd Howard.
---
The scrapbox is fine if it were available to all. The tent actually shouldn't exist because of the easy and free access to stash, scrap or normal, because it makes weight reduction perks mostly pointless.
---
Yeah, I'm guessing it's all the explosions. I'm trying one more time, and if it crashes again I'll just play another game
---
&gt; *"It‚Äôs not just having a private server,‚Äù [Todd] Howard explained. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs being able to mod. Once our games come out, that‚Äôs where our hardcore players play. And they‚Äôre still playing¬†Skyrim¬†and¬†Fallout 4. They‚Äôre the most popular games in the world and it‚Äôs because people are playing mods.‚Äù
---
https://www.twingalaxies.com/feed_details.php/2627/fallout-76-will-support-private-servers-modding-confirms-todd-howard*
---
Yeah, but the mods said that Beth isn't shilling here
---
Working pretty good on my PS4. A little chuggy during massive amounts of cars being blown up but not unplayable.
---
Largely because scorchbeasts/scorched killed Appalachian survivors prior to the opening of Vault 76.
---
Reminda me of the walking dead when majority dont wanna be raiders yet are forced too
---
Depends on when you left. I took a few month break and came back and it has been fun. I was staying strong for the wastelanders DLC but now it is just leveling alts and finding finishing looks and weapons for each character for now.   
---
If you played everything up to the raids then there really is nothing new other than the event this week.
---
You must be Fallout 1st member to view this post!
---
they were simply used to hide loading screens
---
This fuckin game turned into a joke the minute they decided to do that subscription bullshit.
---
They havent even addressed the issue....
---
Probably not
---
and see, another shill, they are endless
---
Stop giving them bad ideas
---
You're welcome
---
That‚Äôs actually alot less likely due to risking slander charges. Nobody can get in trouble for promoting their own game, but there are consequences for trashing someone elses work.
---
If the ESO model stays the same, This probably wouldn‚Äôt be fallout 1st exclusive.
---
We would probably be able to get a base horse in game with a quest.  Premium skins would be atomic shop/1st only.
---
Each horse would have level 1-60 upgrades for, speed, stamina, and Cary capacity. 
---
We can up grade 1 of the 180 stats daily, or buy the upgrades at a faster rate from the atomic shop, with 1st members getting a discount.
---
Yeah, quite a few are extremely defensive about the game. I think a lot of the players are just tired of the constant negativity towards the game because it keeps happening over and over again. If someone kept telling me the sky is blue over and over again I‚Äôd probably get frustrated after a while. I wouldn‚Äôt take it personal man.
---
Personally, I‚Äôve had fun playing the game. I was never really bothered by not having NPC‚Äôs in the game or some of the issues that a lot of people had with the game. I‚Äôm just tired of the way Bethesda are taking advantage of their customers over and over again.
---
How do you get the paint? I don't like nuclear winter do you have to be good to unlock it? Thx
---
Dont think it is hourly this is the 4th time I'm doing it and I haven't been playing 4 hrs
---
My brother did. But he generally has very good luck when it comes to loot in this game
---
I wish, but you're right no game is perfect
---
So you‚Äôre just going to skip over the fact that it was announced that private servers were going to be a paid service before the game even came out?
---
 Check the guide to returning ‚Äî&gt;
---
I dunno, it may also just be Obsidian's more laid back attitude. They are clearly confident in their game. (and rightly so)
---
Ah my bad then. Looks like i have been  missinformed.
---
It's definitely not worth 3 AAA games a year.
---
In a 24 hour period, yeah. But that's bullshit still, I agree.
---
Well it was in FONV and I know some folks have been asking for it so I would not put them having this "time saver" utility item on the Atom Shop real soon. A tweak to the drop rates for salvaged ammo would make that even more tempting. They said there would be more utility items recently when they basically went back on their cosmetic only promise pre-launch, so I would not be surprised to see this one appear soon.
---
Oh I‚Äôve been doing it every top of the hour I suppose it could be different for each sever I don‚Äôt know
---
they seemed pretty happy to beat innocents to death and rape/pillage seemingly for the sake of it
---
They're cheaper if you buy them without an operating system installed from my experience.
---
Glad I could help!
---
Makes sence
---
I‚Äôm more inclined to believe companies are sabotaging other, *competing* brands by blowing the backlash out of proportion. Essentially you‚Äôd increase and maintain a sense of group-think that negatively impacts the outside perspective of the view. 
---
I mean hell, the story or 76 actually tells of something eerily similar. 
---
Whether positive or negative, I consider people like you scum of the earth.
---
I'll try again. We were told there would be no additional costs.
---
Does Fallout 1st cost money?
---
i would rather have a 200lb global account wide mailbox than a free or paywalled unlimited scrapbox..
---
That is what they should have sold...
---
Imagine being the target of the original comment
---
Bethesda: We make shitty games now and charge subscription fees!
---
If you liked the game before return, it‚Äôs a personal preference...
---
This 
---
&gt; sub is not ran by Bethesda
---
does not mean this is true
---
&gt;Bethesda has nothing to do with the subs.

It's also buggy as Hell. You may end up getting completion and not get a notice and the quest keeps popping back up. Or you'll get the notice an hour or two later.
---
Just doing my job as a haut monde trying to keep the plebeians entertained.
---
Same here! I was even dumb enough to buy the helmet edition even with the crappy bag. Didnt complain about it didnt give a damn. I played the crap out of FO76 but I can only take so much nonsense before I start questioning it.
---
This is Bethesda‚Äôs masterstroke; they‚Äôre making Fallout 4 real by dividing us against each other. Who‚Äôs a Shill? Am I shill without knowing it? How many shills are among us, spying on us for the Institu- I mean, Bethesda.
---
Mods haven't been here since day one, doubt they will show up now.

Thought so :)

I think part of it Will be exclusive. There Will certainly be exclusive companions and my money thinks Dogmeat will cost real money.

Lol because there is literally 0 incentive!

Argumentum ad populum. 
---
Ignorance is bliss.
---
And I'm fucking kung fu panda,
---
Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me. But, then again they did say it‚Äôs free for everyonr.
---
No but you are given options outside of that. Events to do, players to help out, PvP. etc.
---
Your post and comments reak of r/iamverysmart
---
Sentry Bot must shoot ...for...ev...er
---
I was so tempted to buy that helmet üòÇ I couldn‚Äôt justify it though. 
---
You are well within your rights to ask questions about the future and behaviour of a game that you have spent a lot of money and time on.
---
&gt; There is no logical reason (at least business wise) that Bethesda would put all this in the game for free
---
One reason I can imagine is that it would encourage sales of the base game, as many people who did not buy FO76 probably did so because of the lack of living NPCs and dialogue. But it could be problematic to make the content exclusive for technical reasons anyway, it is integrated with the existing world too much (rather than being a separate region that can easily blocked off for non-subscribers), so there would essentially need to be two different versions of the game. At most I see a possibility of subscribers being able to beta test the expansion on some sort of PTS a few days to weeks before release, but even that is doubtful.
---
Yes it costs money. Does it cost money to you if u dont want it? No. Is it a bad idea? Yes. Do they force us to buy it? No. So, no additional cost
---
The problem with self hosted servers, and the reason a lot of games have moved away from it is the resources available to the average user are not to par to what it takes to host it. This tends to cause an unfair advantage to the host as they tend to experience less lag than remote players. "Because Minecraft works" is not a good comparison in this situation.
---
Because they spent a hundred mil on this game and it flopped, the cash shop didn't work well enough because they screwed that up too, and they needed a way to secure money for future content. So they did this stupid shit. And they had the stunning lack of common sense to not wait for Wastelanders.
---
Thanks guess I'm gonna hop on NW than. What about a a available date is it gonna be up all weekend than?
---
Hahaha! This is the best post I‚Äôve seen in awhile! I‚Äôm picturing you as some poor, downtrodden soul forced to wear a Vault Boy mask 24/7 and stand behind a counter spouting Bethesda propaganda!
---
&gt;I bought atoms so shitposters like you can have free dlc.
---
Well... Many people pre-bought the game (they gave Bethesda money to make the game as if this was some Kickstarter dream) so we could all enjoy this shitbugged game, so, it's not about what we do with our money, but about what Bethesda does with it. And most people are not happy with the resulta, one year after release.
---
From what I can tell, there are usually less than 5 NW servers active at a time in the North America area on Xbox.
---
Events are Defend the thing, escort the thing kill the thing. Pvp is lacking. Community is all this game has.
---
That's what I thought lmao instead I've been told im dumb. That's the best insult they have. I'm dumb.
---
Just had a freeze right before we completed it...
---
Feel like the only way they'd be able to do that with the same game world is to split first members and non first members up into different servers, which I find it hard to believe that they will do that.
---
Question, would playing it on a solo private server make it easier?
---
Talking about this one?:   
---
&gt; **"We made a post-apocaltypic survival game where you can do whatever you want and everybody's nice to each other. They don't go on killing/griefing sprees. They leave food and water for the newbies and wave to each other. I don't know about you, this should give us all hope for humanity when the apocalypse does come."**
---
&gt;at the very least my experience has made me weigh negative reviews while shopping online heavier than the positive reviews 
---
I just want to point out, that its not just positive reviews that use these strategies, companies do it with negative reviews against their competition.  My company has gotten negative reviews on products within a few hours of the listing going live, but before any product has actually been shipped.  It is likely not as widespread as fake positive reviews, but it does happen.
---
Yes but they are dead.
---
Or players.
---
And you're going to skip over everything else I said?
---
I don't recall private servers being said to cost money, but that is a non issue and isn't my grievance with F1st. Private servers have always cost money in MP games, that's not surprising. What is surprising is that these private servers aren't really private, the P2C (convenience mechanics), and the broken nature of the game overall and some of the subscription's items (stealing peoples scrap, namely). It's a half-assed cash grab and brings nothing genuinely new to the game.
---
It is top of the hour. If you hop after finishing quickly you can sometimes catch the back end of the 2nd.
---
Same, it sucks but I‚Äôll keep trying.
---
It‚Äôs not a terrible idea. I think it‚Äôs kinda been a thing for a long time that horses are meant to be extinct in the Fallout universe, but seeing as this is relatively soon after the bombs dropped- and since Bethesda made a comment way early on in a documentary that creatures in 76 are more diverse than in earlier games due to the relatively recent fallout causing more wild and varied mutations, with some of these creatures (such as the mega sloth most likely) eventually becoming extinct by the time of Fallout 4. So like, it‚Äôs plausible that some mutated horses could still be alive and eventually have died out in later years.
---
Haha touch√©!
---
It was fine until sentrybot and assualtron blew up
---
Oh wow sounds good thank you for the advice
---
Its a struggle for me to play 2 games straight of NW. This would require like 50+ games winning several. At 200xp thats 70 matches. 70, 20 minute matches is 1400 minutes which is realistic time for top 10 and that kind of xp, theres 1440 minutes in a day. Another event thats broken.üò¨
---
Yeah, couldn't of put it any better myself, I've just lost all faith now. Roll on Death Stranding. If I want to play game a service I'll stick to elite dangerous.
---
I think you need to re-read your own comments.
---
Hell your got soup, damn man share.  Also you can't really call someone a cuckold when video game attire angers you like a beta male.
---
I goddamn knew it!
---
Unfortunately, I can see this happening.
---
We were also told that we couldnt have a larger stash because it affects performance.
---
Your comment reeks of reductionism and simplification. The world is complicated. Being ignorant to reasoned argumentation and longform writing is dumb. Sorry if that hurts your feelings, I guess?
---
I love how you got downvoted once they realized their game is a far worse grind.
---
Because bethesda couldn‚Äôt be bothered and saved 1000s of hours cost in doing so?
---
Here I'll sum it up for you.  
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
IM ENTITLED TO PAY FOR A GAME ONCE AND HAVE CONSTANT UPDATES AND NEW CONTENT FLOWING MONTHLY BUT I SHOULD NEVER EVER HAVE TO SPEND ANOTHER DIME.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND ECONOMICS AND HOW TO MAINTAIN A STEADY REVENUE ON A GAME THAT REQUIRES CONTINUOUS UPDATES AND BALANCE TWEAKS.
---
Or something along those lines.
---
I'm joining a minute or two in to the event. It's been okay doing it this way.
---
Personally i think Fallout 1st is an atrocity and this game is now an unmitigated shitshow, but this paranoid shit by OP makes me want to actually do some "Fallout 1st is sooo great guys!" Post.
---
Is it really so impossible that people still enjoy the game, regardless of all the shit surrounding it?
---
There's a lot of going up and going down already in the game dude.
---
There is a chat mod on nexusmods that is pretty popular.
---
Its almost like they said that it would be free when they said they were pushing it back.
---
&gt;We‚Äôve been hard at work on Fallout 76 this year, including our biggest free update yet, Wastelanders.¬†

---
I really think this should be illegal
---
Next legendary gamma gun I get im gonna try this out.
---
Its definitely fun, when it works
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ I am crying at this
---
It'd be cool if there was a way for the disconnect message to give more information. Was it the server? Was it my crappy internet? Are there too many people trying to watch livestreams in the neighborhood?
---
typical, bethesda leaves it to the community to fix or add something that should have been there on day 1.
---
I died around the time the event completed and couldn‚Äôt respawn... so no loot from the bot. I hope I got the rewards at least.
---
 Fallout 1st is evil, explosion of rage. This is difficult for you to understand? ;)
---
I guess the difference between you and a shill is that you used to, while they still do.
---
&gt; GTA releases a new grief machine every month that requires either dozens of hours of grinding the highest paying jobs to unlock, or you can pay $20 and have it unlocked instantly.
---
Or you can glitch cars for a few hours and be set for the rest of the game.
---
But thats my stapler
---
People obviously like the game, after all a lot of people (misguidedly, imo) bought Fallout 1st access. Unless you think those are all Bethesda bots too.
---
Does it count if you wear a costume under PA
---
I get some 5 minute wait times between matches. Hopefully there will be less waiting if more people show up to grind NW for Halloween
---
&gt; Just because you dont see them doesn't mean they're not there.
---
Well, neither one of us can prove who's right so it's pointless to argue about it. The game was released a year ago so to me it makes more sense that those who bought subscriptions already owned the game.  
---
&gt;You seem to act like you were bullied by whining that you bla bla bla
---
If I knew this discussion was going to be about me personally and not the game I used as an example then I would never have mentioned it.  
---
&gt;are you saying developers should make it so higher level players can't kill lower level? 
---
That's one solution. There are plenty of games that do that. Another solution is to make PvP optional. Isn't that what FO76 does?
---
Yea true but it is worth the download
---
Ended up sticking it in my vendor for 8500 and someone bougjt it yeehaw
---
Oh and the damn hackers.
---
Banks would be sooo nice. Its such a simple thing.

I‚Äôm not sure, I‚Äôve seen some people doing the event in PA. But most are in costumes. You don‚Äôt really take any damage or rads, so PA isn‚Äôt really needed.
---
The challenge today asks you to earn 250 XP in NW. It's not hard. I played one match and got top 20 with no kills and made 211 XP, so it shouldnt take much effort, just live a long time.
---

---
Iv'e played 3 times on PS4 Pro and had blue screen in the 3rd.
---
"every other game with servers" don't necessarily have no subscriptions or microtransactions. Any game that's running a stable online server needs money to keep the servers up. One way or another, they're getting it. Because of all the negativity FO76 has been getting SINCE LAUNCH, game sales are probably not enough to keep the servers up. So if the choice is between an OPTIONAL monthly subscription of $12.95/mo or no servers at all, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say there'd be way more outrage if the game just dropped out of existence.
---
A lot of us have fun in here, but running out of new things to do could potentially be a problem. There's a new event today though! Hoping that'll be fun!
---
Awful, just awful, a wilful disingenuous twisting of this mans words.  
---
 Of course he meant entertainment per hour. You know that, we all know that, but you chose to try shame the bloke and have the audacity to say you feel sorry for him. 
---
 Awful.
---
I‚Äôve seen the displayed slots be ‚Äúout of order‚Äù before. But every time my 2nd slot has a ‚Äú3rd slot‚Äù effect on it, the 3rd slot has a ‚Äú2nd slot‚Äù effect on it. So I think it‚Äôs just a visual thing.
---
That reads like a textbook attempt at deflection, you damn dirty shill.
---
Sometimes the people I play with just leave after a couple games because the waits too long. And it's dramatically different since the original launch of NW
---
HMMM now where the hell is bos and the enclave
---
 &gt; Makes a new type of game they've never made before and tries to make a profit. 
---
This is the most intellectually lazy argument of them all. And deep down, you know it.
---
Nice I will give it a go then! Can you you see these challenges once in nuclear winter? Thx again
---
Thank you. I knew it was something like this but didn‚Äôt know there was a workaround.
---
Great. I‚Äôll look for a camp by the ash heap
---
Same, I'm playing on a base PS4. Having some lag with igniting bonfires, and fighting ghouls is mostly slash and pray, but it's working. It was working much better with just two of us on a private server, sure, but we didn't make it to the third stage before the timer ran out. And having seen the third stage now, I don't think it's feasible to try with less than four organized players.
---

THE SYNTHS ARE AMONG US REEEEEE
---
You think there are pro-consumer shills?
---
Who is paying for them? The ACLU?
---
Absurd false equivalence.
---
Oh I know what it is based on and I really want it
---
2nd event run and i got it. No patterns yet.
---
Haven't played since.   There are so many games that I kind of play, that I barely play any of them.
---
Happening in NW as well. Just happen to me. Makes it hard to hear. Wish they would figure it out like yesterday.
---
I think it really has been blow out of proportion.  You DON'T have to buy the service and if you do you are pretty much getting all listed for the price of the Atoms in the pack. Its not even pay to win.  It actually looks more like they want to make the premium service kinda like Elder Scrolls Online Plus Premium Service.  All the negative commenters that are blowning it out of proportion forget they have to find a solution for keeping the game running.
---
What platform?
---
There are no issues. F76 is the greatest MMO ever created. 3rd world nations are rushing to get working internet just to play 76. Blizzard, Epic all the major players are calling Bethesda daily for advice and guidance on how to make successful games that work and are fun. 
---
Just last week the Chancellor of video gaming in conjunction with Gamepro magazine awarded 76 "greatest game ever made" its a real award look it up. /s
---
I want to keep playing the game when Bethesda stops being predatory.
---
Turns out they'll only fix things if they can charge you for the fix.
---
Okay, sure. But if you buy Fallout First you're a shill.
---
anyone on xbox. got a halloween themed camp to share
---
You would have to redefine the meaning of words in the English language to come out right in this argument. We bought the game for $60 and were told there would be no additional costs. All future updates would be free of charge.
---
Nope me right your wrong :)
---
I'm sure someone will answer your question before me, but I'm buying it later when I log on, so I'll tell you then
---
Interesting how you seem very informed on this topic but are struck when someone calls out the possibility of the other side of the coin. (companies are sabotaging competing companies brand imagine). And yes they are risking defamation but given the anonymity of the internet I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs worth the risk. 
---
Unfortunately the hive mind is too strong here and most won‚Äôt see how you‚Äôre practicing the very act of shill, only in the opposite, right here right now.
---
Oh gosh, I wonder how much THAT would cost
---
I'll take note of the time when it pops next think it might be every half hour
---
I have 20% weapon weight reduction on arms and legs (80% less total).  I carry 6 guns: Vampires handmade, 2 shot handmade, 2 shot repeater, instigating repeater,  Instigating Crossbow, and a zealot's 90% weight reduced 10mm SMG.
---
Bethesda can happily pay me or not. I still like fallout. I still think it‚Äôs better than elder scrolls. I played borderlands 2. I mean ummm.   Outer worlds .  And I still prefer the fallout universe. 
---
Again. Bethesda could pay me to say that if they want to. Still going to say it.
---
For the 19th time, I'm well aware and have said this
---
I want it to come back. I preordered $80 for the tricentennial and supported them with $100 in atoms, it looked like a lot of people did based on liberty prime armor, bear outfit, sheepsquatch, rider skins, etc. but I guess it wasn‚Äôt enough for them. But I don‚Äôt want to be forced to pay for game features Bethesda said they couldn‚Äôt fix then monetize
---
Cuz no one's playing lol
---
I hate them. Especially charred feral ghouls with a passion. The stagger is deadly because you literally can't get away. They might as well slap your gun out of your hand to add insult to injury
---
aka extortion
---
Ubisoft definitely employs them
---
I've played since the beginning. I play every day. I love the game. It has issues but for some reason I feel like with a Bethesda game it's the nature of the beast. Is that good or bad to say? Take it as you will. 
---
I purchased fo1st subscription mainly to gain access to the ranger outfit. For a long time fan I don't have a problem paying $13 for one month of it to get the outfit. 
---
Now the other benefits that come with the "controversial" service are quite nice. I enjoy them, unlimited junk storage is nice. I'm not sure how I feel about it though in regard to fairness. Does it give a player an advantage over other players that don't have it? Maybe. It's more of a convenience than a tactical advantage to "win". 
---
The reason I pay money is because they offered a "product". I wanted it. It had a price tag. I could easily afford said price tag. I've had no major disdain for the game. So i bought it. 
---
I feel in a way it's naive to think, in this modern world, a big corporation wont change their announced plans with a project. That's where all the outrage came from. 
---
Is Bethesda being greedy? No, Bethesda looked at the gaming industry as a whole and made a big decision to push themselves to evolve. And the thing with evolution is only the strong survive. Time will tell. 
---
Until then I plan on playing the game until I find something else that catches my eye better or they shut this game down. Whichever comes first.
---
One week
---
They probably won't do any repairs to their name with Fallout 76 is the problem. Fallout 76 is pretty much a dead project if you ask me due to how terrible it was handled by Zenimax and Bethesda Softworks. The best way for BGS to get a good name again is to make Starfield as amazing as The Outer Worlds or even better (at least better in some areas. BGS, even at their best, don't have the best writers nor best factions in the RPG industry).
---
Nah, they are both pay to win. 
---
The difference is, GTAV at the very least, has effort put into it and was finished when it launched. And there are ways to get a ton of money. Bethesda allows you to earn currency in game, but ruin the experience by rotating items out of the Atom Shop and making things temporary. Which is way more sleazy than shark cards.
---
Rockstar are pricks the way they force PVP. But I log into GTAO around Christmas, and see that realistic snow and cold weather, and it blows my mind. This game? It has rain. Hell even a nuke just makes everything yellow.

Got the long suit first try. Just don‚Äôt wear it afterwards, everyone wants to trade with you (obviously for the suit) and some might harass you even more, like follow you around, hitting you etc. It‚Äôs freaking annoying. Just chill people, the event is up for one week and the chances that this outfit drops are around 10% of I remember correctly, you will eventually get one!
---
Damn :( this is unfortunately a bug on many (all?) events. It‚Äôs why I always switch to my vampire weapon when the queen or imposter sheepsquatch get to around 15% health.
---
I feel like you're confusing parts of FO4 with FO76
---
Well, if they said...
---
Nice German word
---
I equipped a sheepsquatch mascot head while in power armor, and the optional objective of equipping a costume said completed and went away. So I'm assuming I got the extra reward(s). Not sure what the reward difference of wearing a costume and not is though.

I think mods for sure. Bethesda has been trying to monetize it via creation club but their best bet was just to make an online game
---
Sounds legit
---
Very few people use TSE any more. Haven't in months. High powered weapons are necessary though to fight the robots. I've done it a few times with no issues.
---
I laughed like I was on drugs after I read this.
---
If this reminds you of the doomsday guy, wouldn't that mean doomsday happened?!
---
XD
---
Yup I do the same. I find that the in the middle ratings give a lot more detail about issues.
---
So then don't play.
---
That's not how it works. At all.  
---
Each day, starting October 29th until November 3rd,  a new NW challenge that requires you to gain a certain amount of EXP (The post you linked has the exact numbers.) will be unlocked. The previous one will NOT disappear.  
---
For example, today you are only able to get the Assault Rifle Bats paint. Tomorrow you'll be able to get the bats skin if you missed it today and the newly unlocked 10mm Halloween paint.  
---
After all 6 challenges are unlocked you'll have until November 12th to get as many as you can.  
---
Don't freak out, people. You'll have all the time you need.

Most people....yeah at most it is 10% of the people that bought it with 4% already set to bitch even though they spent money.   
---
Most people enjoy the game (see what I did there) Aso if you remove the day one bombings of 0 you see that the reviews work out positive in the end so most people really do like the game. Remember even 51% positive is most.
---
I'm honestly disappointed with the rewards. The only things worth getting are the costumes/outfits but I'm sure those will BARELY drop at all during the event. Sad.
---
No it isn't. They literally have never released a game like this before.
---
Exactly! I tend to be wary of 9-10 reviews as much as I am of 1-2 reviews.  Even if the person isn't a paid shill, I highly doubt the game was *that* good. Just as there are haters that live to smear feces over everyone else's fun, there are those will a little too much "brand loyalty" to give a fair review either.  
---
So instead I skim through the middling reviews.  You'll then typically see patterns emerge. The one guy ranting about how everything is shit is obviously not helpful, nor is the lone guy ranting about the apparent Jewish feminazi conspiracy to emasculate real gamers that is *clearly* present in said game.  But if you see even the good reviews acknowledging the same flaws in the negative reviews, and vice versa? Yeah that's solid info. Then just ask yourself are these points important to you or not? Do you care if the main quest is linear? Does the addition of survival elements alone send you into a frothing rage? Is the pvp the only thing that really gets your blood pumping?
---
TL:DR Ignore the extreme scores and see which talking points are repeated across both negative and positive reviews.  Then decide which of those talking points are the most important to you.  Don't blindly follow reviews, but use them as a guide.
---
I sure I hope I get the long one. 2 tries so far and nothing good but i‚Äôll keep trying lol
---
3 tries, crashed on 1 and lagged on the third. Managed 1 clean run for a Jack o lantern I neither know or care about.

Noce try Bethesda ;)

That's dumb the fireman helmets already in the game
---
Working great the several times I‚Äôve done it on a first gen PS4. One blue screen shortly after
---
Should probably add your console
---
Idk how it is now, but when I was still playing that wasn't even the case. The game was much more enjoyable that way because you could actually afford things, but you were usually making 1-3 million /hr if you were lucky, and you can spend 9 million pretty quick. 
---
On top of that you're limited to how many you could sell. Sell to fast and they lock your account.
---
I can imagine Bethesda ‚Äúbrand ambassadors‚Äù thinking ‚Äúwhy are you doing this to me??‚Äù every time Bethesda makes a goof.
---
They have made so much money on fallout first- why would they need to address one small section of the customers crying really really hard over something so small?
---
Sell your soul to Satan.
---
Nah it's probably just some petty fans who know they have no valid counter arguments to provide.
---
It is possible
---
Never said it was.
---
Also, we are not discussing Battlefield. Don't change the subject.
---
I already reported them to Bethesda, but I doubt they would do anything, the person is a fallout 1st subscriber
---
More like a fact
---
It's nowhere as simple as you seem to be describing. Everyone seems to have it in their heads that it's either your fault or theirs, but there's not a single *them*.
---
The connection from your computer to your router, through your ISP's subnetwork, through backbone providers, potentially several other ISP networks, through a datacentre provider's subnetwork and through the datacentre itself to the specific machine.
---
There've plenty of examples of connection issues due to specific ISP faults, backbone providers mistakenly blocking traffic and hell, even Cloudflare for HTTP connections.
---
With that said, the only times I've suffered a disconnect/crash to Fallout 76 (which at the time, were not infrequent sadly), I can be fairly certain the issue was close to the source. Considering the servers are also provided by AWS I've heard, which I have my own servers hosted by, I can be certain the issue was the software itself.
---
(Having played in large calls, with people located throughout the US and Europe, it's safe to say if we all disconnect simultaneously then the issue is the game server itself)
---
Gotta wonder how it‚Äôs legal
---
Not sure anyone covers the atom shop weekly updates. 
---
Might be nice to do a weekly video where you recap like evry 5 levels you gain or main quest done in a short 5 min clip along with the newest atom items and the details from last weeks inside the vault.
---
More like a condesnced news story with atom shop and inside vault, followed by commentary into state of game as a new player.
---
If it's not allowed the mods can delete the post
---
Is that the same as the Jack o lantern?
---
(With apologies if you already knew this) There is an intentional, non-bug accuracy penalty, applied on all weapons with the TWO SHOT legendary prefix. Might even be 30%....   
---
NOT just in VATS, btw.   
---
Easiest to see with my (never all that accurate) Gatling gun, as the bullets can be seen travelling in HILARIOUSLY different directions.  Aiming with a scope tightens the spread somewhat, but not entirely. To test this, find a wall that shows "damage", get a non-legendary version of same gun and do hip fire against the wall a few times. You will see the differing impact points. Much like a shotgun. Then try aimed fire (scope or sights) and you will see them group tighter, but not as tight as the non-two-shot gun. This has been part of the Two-Shot legendary effect since FO4.
---
Yeah the jack o lantern suit
---
Yeah, they are shelling out hundreds of dollars for old assets from Fallout 4, and broken private servers and unlimited scrapbox that literally deletes said scrap.
---
My news tab updated. It says one nuclear winter reward each day, collect all 6.
---
&gt; Of course he meant entertainment per hour.
---
Come on, please stop with this revisionist commentary. All references are directly how much is spent and how long that thing goes for i.e. cost per time. It's there as plain as day.
---
&gt; have the audacity to say you feel sorry for him 
---
The audacity for pity. Wow. I didn't even think that was possible.
---
yes.. or no... maybe
---
Try running a now weapons power armor build it can actually be pretty power full but its really hard to get there.
---
Thanks. That‚Äôs what I just got.
---
lol at whoever downvoted you for enjoying your fun weapon. 
---
The first bloodied weapon I got was a black powder rifle, and I had so much fun with it I reshaped my entire build around it. No regrets whatsoever (although now I usually use my automatic handmade)
---
Epic exclusives can be good. For indie companies the financial backing and distribition of a company like Epic is great if you need it.
---
Obsidian didn't need Epic. It was a cash grab by thier distributor. The Outer Worlds was going to sell well no matter what launcher it was on. All this deal did was piss off everyone who hates Epic and lead to a buttload of pirate puns

---
Soon as he subscribe to fallout first he became evil!

Probably going to be Fallout 1st exclusive.
---
Im not changing the subject. People are complaining about the price a crap. Other monthly rented servers cost more. Its a comparison
---
DLC is free
---
In spanish the same, but the Name plan is vault 76 jumpsuit
---
Well this is awkward
---
Yup, if this game was worth it for you then it was worth it for you.  For a big Fallout fan like you, the IP and micro-events can add value far beyond the raw time.  I would, however, **strongly** disagree that *"there's not a lot in the world that can give me 157+ hours of sustained enjoyment for an investment of $60"*, unless that's a comment on your personal tastes.  $60 for hundreds of hours isn't actually that good value in the media world, especially the gaming world.
---
I was going to do a list of comparable-or-higher value things with examples, but it boils down to this:
---
* Most streaming services, e.g. Netflix or its video-game analogs.
---
* Older games.  Most decent games that came out a few years ago (or more) can beat that.  Most RPGs, strat games, and whatever you call M&amp;B or X absolutely pummel it.
---
* MMOs.  MMOs have the most comparable pricing model to FO76 +sub (usually cheaper actually) and generally have far more content.
---
* F2P games.  Warframe and Path of Exile come to mind--only money I've spent there has been to tip the devs and 400 hours in PoE means you're in the casual-to-intermediate range.  Destiny 2 just went F2P, no?
---
* Books.
---
As for paying the devs for their work, my understanding is that Bethesda's parent company, ZeniMax, is pressuring its studios to increase monetization.  Partially to make up for flops/unrealistic expectations from other studios (e.g. Dishonored 2), partially because all parent companies are promising increasing yields to their shareholders.  Bethesda is the company's biggest moneymaker studio and they ain't hurting for cash, so it's a natural place to increase monetization.  I highly doubt your money is going to the people doing the work, more likely it's directly pipelined to the parent company + CEO bonuses.  Or being used to fund games from other studios.  Also, there are a *ton* of deserving devs out there in the world, many of whom work for independent studios with a much more direct money route.  I wish I had the money to pay them all what they deserve and it's a shame those companies don't pull in the big bucks (in general) just because they don't have studio brand recognition.
---
If you liked FO76 and are glad you purchased it, you don't have to defend yourself on that.  Enjoyment is subjective and you like what you like.  If you want to pay more to express your appreciation, that's fine.  A problem, though, is that such players often seem driven to objectively justify their decision, to make it *the objectively right decision*.  And when other people criticize the value (e.g. by comparing how much = money gets in other games), 76 fans feel the strange need to demonstrate that this game is *objectively* extremely high value and the criticisms are ridiculous, despite numerous counterexamples.
---
\*And likewise.  Good discussion is always a plus and if everyone put effort into it then the other discussions across this Reddit might actually be productive.  Alas...
---
What platform and was it long or short?
---
Lol, I'm probably 2 to 3x your age, just messin' around man, nothing personal.üòú

yes actually.

I can tell you that there are US politicians who hire people to shit on and ‚Äúsmear‚Äù competition in the US. These politicians usually run shell companies to fund various parts of their complain - and let‚Äôs ignore pacs/ super pacs.

As far as if Pepsi does that to smear coca-cola?   That may be less likely. But remember Pepsi had a blind taste test campaign to openly Shane coke - and it was sponsored by Pepsi itself.

So yes.

Hey that's neat, why not charge us for it when it's done....Ohhhh right this is Bethesda...nvm.

Play on a private server- runs smooth like butter

Yes, I made an edit. The news tab updated for me with the new info. Whew right? lol
---
Don't be a twat?.
---
Yeah, everything is more expensive now. And the selling limit is still there, but it's manageable, and pays better than anything else does. Easiest way to never have to grind, or to set yourself up for the easiest grind if you still want to play that way.

"Well, neither one of us can prove who's right so it's pointless to argue about it. The game was released a year ago so to me it makes more sense that those who bought subscriptions already owned the game. "
---
I'd bet I'm more correct than you are. You're using logic to assume that if the person is brand new to the game, they couldn't possibly have 1st, same if they're not on here and you haven't read it, they couldn't possibly be lower level with 1st.
---
"If I knew this discussion was going to be about me personally and not the game I used as an example then I would never have mentioned it. "
---
Well, you made it that way when you tried to justify the seeking out of 1st players just because you were killed a lot as lower level player in a different game (title notwithstanding).
---
"That's one solution. There are plenty of games that do that. Another solution is to make PvP optional. Isn't that what FO76 does?"
---
That's not a solution at all. Disproved it in the sentence following that. From my exp FO76 PvP is optional although I have heard of instances where that's not always the case. What games limit a higher level player from attacking/killing a lower level?
---
If your intention are specifically to explore it's worth it the Map is very large and full of interesting locations and all DLC is free
---
I carry dozens, but 4 of my armor pieces are WWR so I‚Äôm not sure I count, lol
---
I like your optimism!
---
No it's called whataboutism. Two wrongs don't make a right.
---
what platform you play on?
---
yeah, I assume the next game in the franchise will come out long before that happens
---
Outer Worlds has zero exploration, a lack luster crafting system, and the game area is cut up into tiny little play pens, and has no multiplayer at all. For it to be doing everything better it has to be doing the same thing.
---
Reddit has been over run by shill artificially upvoted trending for years it just keeps getting worse
---
Oh wow. You're paying child support and you spent money on this subscription?
---
I say this with all sincerity - I genuinely hope that you never ever regret paying for the Fallout 1st subscription.
---
All legendaries are transient, if you've moved up, you've moved up. Just be sure to return the favour down the road.
---
I think NCR ranger outfit should be free as well. It's something that should have been in game in the first place
---
Lol, at least all my good junk was in my stash box, he got the trash
---
Why do you act like payment is the important part? Being disingenuous is the point, and there are plenty of people who have strange problems with this game and Bethesda. As far as I'm concerned their contributions are worth as little as any shill, and they make the real criticism less effective and problems harder to solve.
---
If you're a critical player or former player with reasoned opinions or experiences to share, great. If you're an idiot with a torch or a plain old troll you can walk away any time.
---
If you liked fallout 4, it's probably worth 5 quid.  
---
Sometime early next year a huge dlc is coming out, and in the meantime there's plenty of content to keep you busy.
---
Terrible people who contribute to the dishonest narrative of corporate and "we live in a society" culture.
---
Reported you for witch hunting. The mods kept the article up, because it brings legit problems that need to be discussed.
---
The latter. Listening to short term financial gain never works for these companies. It always comes around to bite them back.
---
You make a great point
---
So you're a shill engaging in predatory buisness practices but your a totally good guy and we should believe you. I call BS
---
Sanjay here...
---
Solo the Burroughs 
---
Then nuke Harper's Ferry, and try it again
---
Holy shit?!?
---
They've fixed it a dozen times to bring it right back with the next update.
---
Looking less and less like professional devs and more like amateurs.
---
No we weren't! How did you somehow miss an entire years worth of public derision for these prices? I bought ten dollars worth of Atoms back when the game launched for the Rocket Suit. It was a huge rip off. The assets already exist, and the textures continue to be bugged for something they want nearly $20 for.
---
Hell, I'm willing to bet the entire reason behind this launch and pricing is because not enough people were willing to pay $20 for blue PA paint.
---
either be a raider or have the whole dlc be a waste of money
---
I'm not sure why but the writers have seemingly been pretty resistant to the idea of horses surviving after the bombs.
---
Yep, I got call of duty for $49 AUD ($33USD), And unlike fallout first, I can sell it on
---
Rose too. I just can't stand her voice. We should nuke her as well. We should nuke robots in general
---
You just dont wanna hear about the truth. You hate fallout 1st, and thats that. Im done
---
There is no face, just the flat dress and a space into the hat where your head would fit.
---
pc
---
some fucking good soup my cu... uh dude
---
I would also assume that there are also people out there who are working for other gaming companies that actively go around shitting on the competitors products every chance they get. Yeah just can‚Äôt trust anything.
---
Me and a friend played ESO since launch, we discussed the plus membership and assumed it would happen. The thing that gets me is when I first joined this sub everyone hammered me when I admitted to using the bug that gave you unlimited carry weight. Everyone said it was what was causing the server problems, same as in your post. Just like to say that it never made any sense if you have even the slightest idea of how servers work, It's all numbers. Anyway very insightful. I guess I'm pretty neutral on the changes, I don't like it but I could still play the game and have fun. Will I ever subscribe to FO1st ? doubtful unless they made a whole lot of changes. This coming from someone who had an ESO plus sub for probably 3 years. I like FO76 I really do but it just doesn't have the content at the moment to pay monthly considering I bought the base game... Anyway thats my rant.
---
Do you just not actually read any of the criticism?
---
Some do, some do not.
---
Ok. Stan says I may have dyslexia, but was willing to make the deal.
---
That would be an improvement.
---
These shill accounts should really spend at least 10% of their day posting in other subreddits to make it less obvious.
---
When you run a team of good players its easy
---
Crashed every time
---
Plus I remember them adding 40+ car garages around when I quit, which would make things easier since you can just store the cars and sell them as you want to buy something.
---
I think he‚Äôs voiced by John ‚ÄúBender‚Äù DiMaggio... so, by default, pretty sure you are wrong in this.

I did a quest for her and now every time I log on the first thing I hear is ‚ÄúYou know... I think I‚Äôm starting to.. like you..‚Äù and it‚Äôs like shut up damn thotty I‚Äôm tryna get this money
---
&gt; A lot of problems with online games can be attributed to your internet.
---
The phrasing of this just seems to point blame to the people using the service. Perhaps unintentional but it's likely how it will be seen.
---
Do you do anything but complain? Do you even play the game or just whine? You know most people stopped using TSE after they were nerfed months ago. Powerful weapons are also necessary to beat the robots.
---
Also they created a community that is now afraid to suggest an improvement in good faith because Bethesda will most likely monetize it.
---
I'm gonna make a company where we flood the market with 3-4 star reviews with mostly positive relevant information
---
I had it drop me a time or two and each time I still got my rewards so might want to check our inventory!
---
Still waiting on the sheep costume so the drones can get fucked with the proper attire on

Maybe try swapping some Perks around, experiment with a new play style just for the event. 
---
You might find an alternative you haven't considered before.
---
I'm dont have a good PC, running all low except shadows on medium and im fine if the cache is clear.
---
Nobody is mad at you.    
---
Everyone is mocking you due to your complete lack of originality.     
---
Either A: This is satirical. You know why people buy this (money in exchange for goods or services rendered), but pretend not to so you can feel smug as you post the 400th uninspired version of ‚ÄúHUR, DEA BETHE$DUH IS BAD!?!?‚Äù    
---
Or B: You don‚Äôt understand the simple societal concept of exchanging money for goods and services rendered. They tell you what you get in exchange for subscribing. It‚Äôs simple. Children understand it. You trade money for something you want.    
---
I don‚Äôt have FO1st, but if I did, it would be because I saw something offered in exchange for money and decided I would like said thing in exchange for said money. It the basis of society as we know it.     
---
So, what‚Äôll it be? ‚ÄúHUR DUR Look at me! I have an opinion! Oh god, please validate me!‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat is money and how does one read a list of items I can buy with money and how do I give someone money for the thing I want?‚Äù    
---
Either way, it‚Äôs just embarrassing. That‚Äôs why no one takes you seriously enough to answer you. They‚Äôre just too embarrassed for you. It‚Äôs not angering. Nobody is mad. it‚Äôs boring. Everyone is bored.    
---
At this point it‚Äôs easier just to mock you zealots. It‚Äôs the only way to salvage anything mildly entertaining from these boring, redundant, carbon copy reposts.    
---
This message paid for by Bethesda PR team (No, it‚Äôs not paid for by Bethesda. Yes, that is sarcasm mocking all the tinfoil hat-wearing lunatics brigading this sub).
---
I know. I was more talking about their attitude when posting. I understand completely, that it was a publisher call.
---
Wait, does this mean that I can kill shills by just looking at them?
---
what do you mean i‚Äôm new in reddit and the whole console thing. i play on pc so idk if that helps.
---
Right here, jump onto the outer worlds, borderlands, or one of the many other games out  there.
---
I agree.  They preached how they were going to communicate with the community.  Instead they dumped this on us.  If they asked or took a poll on what kind of subscription we would pay for, this would likely be the answer. For about 8 - 10 bucks a month. 85 for a year. And so many more people would buy it.  In my opinion. 
---
Source: I saw a cover of a sales strategy book once.
---
It could be me, it could be you, it could even be-
---
That‚Äôs a good point. I think I, like many other people, would prefer there be differences to builds before replaying with different builds but there‚Äôs definitely a place for meta-RPing your gameplay experience.
---
I just looked and it‚Äôs long.
---
More money, for more of all those things.
---
 LOL. I do that all the time. Its actually about a 1/5 level, depending of course. Its not a great place for legendaries any more, even on the couple of times it was nuked. ;(
---
Charleston Fire Station is not too far from the forest and there are no enemies there, just a few random bots on the upper floors. Also a weight set spawn that is good for lead.
---
It's not. An MMORPG is a large scale video game with a very large number of players all playing simultaneously.
---
It gave me an excuse to repost pirate puns so I went with it. üòÅ
---
I believe the proper term is peasant.
---
(Jk)
---
He's not wrong though. There are sites where you can sell your account to people that do this, and I was thinking of selling mine for a while. It's relatively old and has a decent amount of karma, so it's worth a lot more than a brand new account that could get discredited easily. You should look into it if you're skeptical.
---
Oh? So Rust and Ark are MMORPGs? They all have a very large number of players playing together at once? They have anywhere near as much content as FFXIV or BDO or anything?
---
Some of the names are deceiving. I haven‚Äôt learned any of the plans that I‚Äôve found yet but I‚Äôm assuming that they are all jack o lanterns. The one I got excited for temporarily was a vault door jack o lantern. I‚Äôm going to assume that I‚Äôm not getting a vault door that slides open lol.
---
just did. totally forgot. thank you
---
Congrats!
---
Oh? So rust and Ark are MMORPG's too then? They all have a very large number of players playing together?
---
yeah, pretty much. I wasn't even considering preorder after playing the beta, and that price is the only reason I gave it a shot.
---
I don't think I got to level 15 before giving up.
---
And?
---
Lol is that rare then?
---
Yeah kind of a downside of 1st you can own every workshop and with proper turret placements even if they are over ran everything keeps outputting.   
---
So back to lack of cap sinks.
---
Exactly it's a multiplayer online game. Like the thousands of others.
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
So what? The game is broken in the same way as all of their single player games. They have bugs from Fallout 3 still present. Being new is not an excuse for treating customers like crap. For releasing the game in the state it is, ignoring said state and focusing on tone deaf monetization.
---
Game companies release games they've never done all the time. None of them come out as broken as this one.
---
They literally modded Fallout 4 to be multiplayer. They didn't invest in a new engine to do what they wanted, they sold assets that were paid for years ago as a premium.
---
None of these problems have to do with never doing a game like this before. These are management level problems. They brought in people from ESO. So they had experience. Not to mention Bethesda may not have released an online multiplayer game before, but that doesn't mean the employees haven't worked on them in the past.
---
Also being a new genre for them doesn't excuse not beta testing the game properly.
---
I don‚Äôt think its crazy rare but its nice to have
---
Obsidian shills invasion haha.
---
OMG why do I have to blue screen and lock up multiple times every time I play?  I‚Äôm down to about an hour of game play because I‚Äôm so tired of constantly having to restart.  Was good for one day after Maintenance and now back to the same ol same. Hope with this extra time they can make stability a priority.
---
Actually am playing right now bud, You sure seem to know it all though right?. Hop off lol.
---
Yes, that exactly! Thanks.
---
I genuinely love the game. I love the camp building aspect, especially since I get to show it off to other people. The events are really fun, especially when multiple people join and more often than not, people are very friendly and willing to help with anything, anytime, anywhere. 
---
I‚Äôve made a post about this before but I think that the more quest-oriented you play the game, the more the bugs are apparent, and therefore the more frustrated people get. This is especially true with some of the Possum challenges and the Photomode challenges. 
---
I spend money purely for camp decorating purposes because it‚Äôs my favorite part! I also spend a lot of in-game money on plans as well :) 
---
I have met a lot of really cool people through Reddit or through the game itself. As I said above, almost everyone is very nice and always willing to help!
---
Because they haven‚Äôt figured out a way to reliably sell shark cars... errghhh I mean ‚Äúatoms‚Äù
---
No I asked why people would give a company money in exchange for a service they said they couldnt provide. IE the unlimited stash size. I than asked for people to enlighten me. Said people resorted to name calling. And than theres you running in on your white horse taking everything out of context to support your own theories.
---
How is it a "one of a kind game" it's a multiplayer survival game with a fallout skin? You can get almost the same experience playing rust or ark or fallout 4 with multiplayer mods? In what way would this ever be considered a one of a kind game? It's not grey that the game has had huge technical issues lmao it's a black and white matter. You can be in denial as much as you like but that doesn't change what the rest of the world thinks.
---
No offense, but could you post a picture?
---
My understanding is that explosive and faster fire rate are mutually exclusive.
---
I was more talking using the tent to farm workout rooms in vaults. It used to be kinda boring because with all the weights you gain like 600lbs. And had to walk slowly to a scrap station. 
---
But now we have a tent that has 0 cool down or penalty for placing in rapid succession.
---
Didn't know that, thanks for the info. 
---
Wandered in there for the first time last week, and got my ass kicked multiple times. Would get disoriented, then swarmed. 
---
Always my problem with sewer / tunnel maps.
---
what bad things?
---
That's fair.
---
I'm just trying to turn in this quest and he won't shut up
---
&gt;Why do you act like payment is the important part? Being disingenuous is the point, and there are plenty of people who have strange problems with this game and Bethesda.
---
Or they just have a problem with the game and Bethesda, like most fans right now.
---
Right? Like damn I just want my goddamn recipes and this dumbass won‚Äôt shut up about his 99 bottles of shit
---
Considering you can do it yourself...
---
Lead bottoming out in value. Guess its back to acid farming.
---
There is an ingame rationale.    
---
Basically (spoilers):  
---
&gt;!After the war, the survivors fractured into groups and were separately rebuilding.  There was some conflict and mistrust between the groups which weakened them, in some cases substantially.  
---
!&lt;
---
&gt;!The Scorched plague then started spreading and with no cure the fractured groups could not unite to overcome the situation and eventually were entirely wiped out to the last man, woman and child.  
---
&gt;!Vault 76 opens shortly after the last humans died off in the region, all that is left are legions of "scorched", former humans who are now enslaved to a sort of violent hive mind set on killing all it cannot infect.  The scorched plague is an existential threat to humanity, if it is allowed to spread beyond Appalachia it will wipe out what remains of humanity.!&lt;
---
I like decorating too ! But I‚Äôm really happy how my house came out last. Made a megaton esk house. But my main problem is no new content with goals you know?
---
Define predatory
---
&gt; Sees Prediction and then sees the predicted thing happen
---
*"I could have predicted this."*
---
That's top-quality logic you got there, friendo.
---
&gt;I'd bet I'm more correct than you are.
---
K
---
Anyway, if there was nothing else I think we're done here?
---
Maybe if you actually sought facts as opposed to listening to the internet outrage machine you wouldn't be confused. 
---
It isn't an unlimited stash, just unlimited scrap storage. If you understood that items represent data and that weapons and armor contain vast amounts of data (including damage for ballistic, energy, explosive, radiation, limb damage, over time damage, armor penetration, vs ghouls, vs scorched, vs players, vs mirelurks, vs super mutants, player health dependant, enemy health dependant, time of day dependant,etc. And that's just damage) that scrap has very little data (description, weight, quantity) and can be near limitless. 
---
The most expensive PA skin was nowhere near 2x 1650, it was 1800. Stop spreading bullshit. 
---
Personally I just did RDO's outlaw pass. It was 3 months of content for something like $25. That is if I had finished it by the end. Only thing I gave a crap about was the skull horse mask (I originally purchased the pass with huge misunderstandings)  Yes at ~$8 a month it's cheaper. Now ask how much those guys want private servers.
---
How do you start the event
---
Can I ask is it in the hour every hour?
---
Refund
---
As someone heavily critical of this game, I do agree. That thread is combative and only serves to start fights. Not sure why it's still up.
---
I don't know everything, that's why I asked a question. Rather than contribute to the conversation you chose to make ignorant statements and cry like a little kid with a skinned knee.
---
Isn‚Äôt that the whole point? For him to sound like a drunk college student? Considering they are the ones who made him
---
Yes, but isn't it a named location/quest area. So you can't build on it
---
The truth? I'm wondering why you're talking about the price of renting a server in Battlefield when we were discussing being lied to by Bethesda.
---
Creating artificial problems that Bethesda says cant be solved until they decide to monetize them, promising nothing except cosmetics in atomic shop then breaking that, adding subscriptions in a paid game when they should be kept to MMOs
---
only beacuase there is less data to transfer between server and clientside.
---
Yes, there are less players creating data that needs to be transfered, so it will assist with latency and lag.  This is the main reason private servers are more stable.
---
I grind Healing Salve, with green thumb I can fab about 280 a day, with perks thats 1400/day
---
Also vend cheap stuff for new low levels Lvl= BOS recon rifles at 160%, disease cures, etc
---
You're ignoring the fact that you're posting in a fall out 7I6 forum about your opinion of fall out 4.  And you do know that you can decide to work against the raiders that are in nuka world right?
---
I‚Äôm not struck it‚Äôs just more straight forward. If you are actively damaging a company you will go to court. Where positively promoting a company, unless it‚Äôs false advertising doesn‚Äôt have legal penalties to my knowledge
---
You're really making a hasty generalization based insufficient information, consequently seeing  me being identified as an internet mass rather than as an individual stranger you *know nothing* about.
---
Yeah, super great logic there.
---
Pretty sure most of the plans are different pumpkins.
---
I dont know that anyone has been punished as of yet for undermeshing.
---
Well this is an MORPG... might not be massive...
---
Anyway it‚Äôs voluntary. Who cares?
---
Slander has a requirement of being factually inaccurate. Someone having an opinion on the quality of something isn‚Äôt a fact, whether you regard it as factual or not. I can stand on the corner by the Hormel factory with a megaphone and scream all day about how SPAM is the nastiest thing I‚Äôve ever eaten and you couldn‚Äôt *pay* me to choke that crap down/*. I might be arrested for and/or charged with being a public nuisance or disturbing the peace, but as long as I limit myself to things I‚Äôm presenting as my opinion (whether actually my opinion or not), I can‚Äôt be charged with slander.
---
/* I don‚Äôt actually mind SPAM at all, though it typically isn‚Äôt my *first* choice of meat products.
---
It's because you need to have a pumpkin in your inventory to be able to craft it. The icons and text are a little confusing.
---
I clicked and thought it was a new post. Found out i wasn't.
---
To quote Bojack Horseman, "...and everything is worse now."
---
But they keep the increased exp needed so you will actually have to play nuclear winter next week too
---
I Disagree.  Grafton Mayor is worse.
---
10% same as pirate
---
You only have one reddit account? I use different accounts for different subs because I got tired of this exact situation... where some creep like you decides to go lurking through my comments to make personal attacks.
---
If you‚Äôve played The Outer Worlds, imagine Martin in his moon mask.
---
It‚Äôs spacers choice!
---
Any Questions???
---
I paid 40 dollars for this game and got 40 hours of enjoyment out of it. Even on launch game yes there were bugs but it was still playable. Yes I crashed a few times but it was less than a second to log in exactly where I was and move on like nothing happened. Compare that to the new CoD which was almost unplayable on launch and crashes damn near hourly. And when you crash you can't reenter the match you were in. So if you were playing with your friends you have to wait for them to finish. And thats a game that releases like twice annually. 
---
I haven't played in months but from launch until the summer they were releasing massive bug fixes every two to three weeks. You can shove that "ignored the state of the game to focus on MTX" up your ass. 
---
&gt; They literally modded Fallout 4 to be multiplayer
---
So what? New Vegas was just a mod of Fallout 3. Riddled with massive amounts of bugs. FUCKING MASSIVE. 
---
Obviously you never played the game. So I tell ya what. I'll buy you a key and you play the game until it becomes literally unplayable. That you reach a bug so heinous and powerful that its literally impossible to keep playing the game.
---
It's more the fact that they are no longer the only game in town when it comes to open world rpgs. They got a free pass for providing something unique. And that monopoly made them complacent. Not other games are doing it, and showing that Bethesda's excuses were bullshit. No more free pass.
---
Fair point, I am a huge fan of Seige, but haven't played many other games by Ubisoft, it was more of the communication I was impressed with. Bethesda has done none of that almost.
---
lol just because you dont read about it on here doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  With the sheer number of people that play the game, it's extremely unlikely what you said was even kinda close to being correct.
---
I get where you're coming from. Like I said earlier, I quit playing GTA online because some players would spend actual money to buy those flying cars and shoot lasers from space.  This gave them an Actual advantage in the game where as players who purchased 1st get nothing.   I choose not to do that but I was always getting wrecked by them and it made the game literally unplayable for me.  Did I blame the developers, no.  That is 100% on the players and you cant blame the devs for that.
---
They ruined the game for me as you are justifying doing so for players who purchased 1st.
---
Buying the game was supposed to be the voluntary side. I think I speak for at least a section of the player base who pre ordered in that it was a pretty tough time when the game came out. The price dropped to half a week after the game launched, bugs were endless, Bethesda took a break in December. Then content all but shut off last May. Most of us spent a decent amount of money in atomic shop to support the game. Then Bethesda rewards us with a ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù paid service, delay of DLC and silence. Wouldn‚Äôt have picked up this game at all if I knew there was a subscription coming for an $80 game.
---
How can you be right when you stated that they're locked behind a subscription, your contradicting your very own words.
---
The dungeons are released as DLC, like most new content in any other game. But ESO+ subscribers has access to all DLC content while their subscription is still in effect.
---
Your statement was incorrect.
---
_‚ÄúYou‚Äôve tried the best, now try the rest.‚Äù_
---
Thats a good one, "cry like a little kid with a skinned knee."
---
If you like this game you are wrong
---
You already can.
---
All the character data is stored on their end, so your good there. 
---
The photos *may* get removed, I don't remember.
---
You are supposed to since its a mmo but with the amount of bugs errrr... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Hence why the middle east is still a chaotic violent place. 
---
People just can't move on and find peace. They would rather poop over everything.
---
I'm crashing a lot too. It's awful.
---
Since its an online game, just install and reinstall. It's all saved in games servers. Most you may have to do is reenter your Bethesda account info.
---
That's fine, I only have one photo.
---
My favorite part about this event is how the game crashes EVERY time I participate. I‚Äôm on #4 so far. This game should be called Disappointment 76. I‚Äôve never played a game that is such a giant let down.
---
I paid $60 at launch. It was definitely a bit rough early on. Not the worst thing I‚Äôve played but it was buggy. It has gotten much more stable since then. 
---
The subscription is voluntary. You don‚Äôt need to pay it, I really don‚Äôt see the big deal here. If you don‚Äôt want the subscription, don‚Äôt buy it. I‚Äôm not buying it and still playing the game exactly as I was last week. Wastelanders is still free. Wouldn‚Äôt you rather they wait to make sure wastelanders runs smoothly before releasing? It has same instancing technology as the vault raids. Clearly there are some bugs they need to work through. I would rathe they not release some buggy mess before it‚Äôs ready.
---
1st should tank the global caps market.  Ammo, mats, legendaries, plans, etc. should be easier to farm without competition.  
---
.556 will always sell, but at only 1 cap.  
---
I sold a bloodied xtra 10% while aiming handmade for 5k and expect it to be worth less in the future.
---
It‚Äôs value is that when you are short on caps, they‚Äôre super cheap to make and you can sell them to the vendorbots for your daily 1400 caps
---
They've fixed most the bugs, but as with every game, there's always a glitch somewhere
---
Because I'm right it's pretty simple really if you were to use your brain.
---
If you play the game the story explains it. From a design standpoint it is because there are 23 other humans running around on he map. We are the NPCs.
---
At this point myself, I‚Äôm just slowly exploring at my own pace, I could never get used to fallout with people wandering with me, so this felt like an easier compromise to myself, the tent and scrap box are nice but not the main reason I got it.
---
Yeah your all good then. 
---
You could try having the playstation rebuild it's database, I've read it suggested a few times 'round here. 
---
https://www.androidcentral.com/how-make-your-playstation-4-faster-database-rebuild

Tent should be on private worlds only and Scarp box free to everyone. Just fucking sell skins for it you turds.

As an end-game player, I couldn't care less about the scrapbox. I don't need much scrap anymore, just what I need to make ammo. Even then, I go get the ores/acid and turn it into ammo right away. There are some other practical uses I guess, so I would lean towards the side of it being free for everyone.
---
I'm indifferent on the tent. I've learned to not get stuck out in the middle of nowhere over-encumbered. And if I am, I just walk to a vendor/camp/workbench. Caps aren't an issue, and haven't been for a long time, so paying for fast travel doesn't bother me. We can all set up a vendor to sell junk--you can make a lot of money selling simple stuff like ammo and junk (springs, screws, stimpacks, etc). At the very least, you could cover your fast travel costs.
---
I really like the idea of a private server, but what bothers me the most about it is once again, another feature was released without full functionality. I personally would drop $100 in a heartbeat if there was a setting that would turn every enemy into a max level enemy across the entire map. Of course, there are many other options that have been discussed. Until then, I'm not quite willing to shell out money on this. When they bring something substantial to the table, so will I.
---
If the reinstallation doesn't fix it, I'll try that. Thanks!
---
If you ( Fallout 76 players) are seriously tired of Bethesda‚Äôs bs than uninstall this game right now. If you care about the future of this franchise, uninstall this game. While complaining on these threads has had some kind of effect it obviously has been over ruled by Corporate in pursuit of more ways to monetize the 76 playerbase. The only real way to make Bethesda listen is by uninstalling the game. Go support a developer that actually deserves your time and money. Go play The Outer Worlds
---
That is awesome. Happy Halloween!
---
Oh sweet thanks! Looks like I'm gonna have to grind the event a bit. I appreciate the answer!
---
No, dude, it would not be worth it at all. Unless those lowly paid employees are willing to commit perjury it would be an incredibly easy case to win with potentially massive damages.
---
XB1, lvl92: I have played since day one, and I continue to play and enjoy.  Why anyone who no longer plays the game, or perhaps never did play the game, continues to gripe and complain about this game is kind of amazing to me.  I guess my time is more valuable than that... to me.
---
Cosmetics are how they are supposed to fund future content and keep the game running
---
He really did just go off on you out of nowhere, huh? Haha
---
hense my attempt at a laymans terms  TLDR explaination of internet infrastructure.
---
76 has been a shit filled dumpster fire from day one ... I refunded my original purchase to buy it on sale when it was 35$ a few weeks after launch and I still feel like I got ripped off.
---
[Relevant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1098/)
---
This is exactly what I wanted and expected when they first announced it.
---
Yes it is only one per day. They translated it like that in French.
---
Nice! The red door gives me insidious vibes.
---
Got the helmet, saw someone with the outfit.
---
Its been far more dead than this before. Trading today is pretty rough with servers full regularly.
---
That explains what I heard last week
---
Fps factor: 20/60
---
I'll work for you as long as I can be passive aggressive in the reviews.
---
I agree with this nearly 100%
---
Last time I was on a paint for armor was 3000 atoms it's been a few months I'll grant you that as for unlimited junk. Junk still takes up data. And people can collect quite a bit. That wont affect the performance of the game? Now I get that armor and weapons take up more data,  but how much more data intensive is 1 shotgun to 100000 lead, 1000 wood, 50000 rubber , 1000000 acid and however much goes into having an ammo farm all your own. If I'm wrong fine I'm ok with admitting I made a mistake. But even if I'm wrong dont you think it would have been easier to explain my mistake to me rather than being a patronizing demeaning ass. But I forgot this is reddit so I retract that question.
---
Ok, so this would be my rational. The armor is technically Riot armor, and considering how much rioting protesting took place in WV, it should've been around at different mine and factories where protesting &amp; rioting took place.
---
Ahhhh okay. Thank you!
---
Dont give them any ideas!!
---
Aw. Shame tat they had to kill him. :( Maybe they could move him to the ground floor or something, give the poor thing a shot at having nine ‚Ä¶ well, eight now .. .lives.
---
Adorable cat. 
---
As for the real one ‚Ä¶ yay for kitties! Give him a lil' treat from the Internet. :D
---
A good amount of people are experiencing this problem unfortunately.
---
The event auto starts every hour.
---
Post history fits
---
Yep yep.
---
Hey bff! Didn't you make a post saying I'm buying fallout 1st, change my mind. Just checking in on you. Seem a little all over the place with your opinions. Want to make sure your alright guy.
---
right back at ya
---
Not technically. You can just slaughter them all(which is great) but its not really ‚Äúwork against‚Äù since its way shorter
---
You're literally wrong, but either way, spend your time being willfully ignorant and oblivious to how The Elder Scrolls Online sells their DLC and whats included in a subscription fee.
---
What a bummer maybe I will just sit and wait and not participate in the hopes that I don‚Äôt crash. Kinda takes the fun out if it.
---
This is nothing but circle jerking
---
Yes I like it. No I haven‚Äôt spent any additional money.
---
Yes I  got the fireman  helmet and the uniform  just now
---
Nah I'm right you wrong :)
---
&gt;Did I blame the developers, no.  That is 100% on the players and you cant blame the devs for that. 
---
Well, that's where you and I differ. How is it 100% on the players if the designers left that in for players to exploit? If Rockstar made a button in the game that you can press to make everyone instantly die, would that also 100% be on the players?
---
Good to know. I‚Äôll keep it in mind if the problem gets worse on my end. Thanks for being patient with us technical know-nothings!
---
Revisionist, heh, its context, your narrative would have us assume he is playing the game without enjoyment for 100's of hours, is ridiculous, and you know it.  
---
 And with that in mind, it was not pity, it was an thinly veiled insult, and you know that as well.  
---
 I think you know a lot, let see if you know that this discussion is done.
---
Yes. Try keeping your view facing the ground some. Help reduce the explosions.
---
Cool, still playing though.
---
I have a history of being consistently downvoted in video game subs?
---
Thanks for the I‚Äôm tip!
---
You do you
---
Thanks we got that the first 200 posts.
---
My graphic card is what would have been best... for Fallout 3, so it is very complicated for me to play in areas with a lot of things in them, like the Whitespring, Charlestown, or Morgantown. I mean don't get me wrong, the event is awesome and the Morgantown map for NW is also great, but impossible to play in with a potatoe graphic card.
---
I have no ties to bethesda I'm a machinist. 
---
I still love the game its FAR better than it was at release I've played since beta day one. 
---
I am a very happy first day buyer of 1st.
---
I'm pretty I remember an option that let me recruit regular settlers to my settlements there. Either way, you don't "have" to be a raider.
---
Also, that was in FO4, not FO76. This is a 76 subreddit.
---
What do you mean by hardware bottleneck? My gear runs a more demanding game at higher fps.
---
If you‚Äôre wearing a costume when you do the event it‚Äôs a 10% chance for it to drop from the list of bonus rewards
---
Yeah, I noticed many translations issues in French too. Usually they get the words right but in the wrong context.
---
Upvote
---
It‚Äôs a massive world to explore
---
"We the community"  &lt;-- please speak for yourself
---
No way, seriously? Can you snag a pic of that?
---
Voice actor?
---
I agree.  Upvote
---
I was aware of.that, yes. Maybe others weren't. I know in FO76 sometimes in VATS the bullets will show a connect but not register a shot. That's what I was talking about.
---
Cool, I never knew this.
---
For the rewards/items you find - Do you only get them from killing the legendary at the end and for completing the event? Are there any other places that you have to loot? I found a tin foil hat at the beginning and put that on. Is there anything else I should be doing to take full advantage of the event?
---
my karma is up not down from video game sub votes, but thats besides the point because karma is worthless  and anyone who is actually karma hunting needs to sort out priorities lol. your posts are trashing Bethesda in general
---
'Continued development of the game'
---
That's the issue. That's always the issue with these "live service" games. Fallout 76 is barely even at a beta stage in terms of polish and storyline etc yet we're being expected to pay for its development? What was the price of the game for then? I don't mind MTX in games that are finished and have at least a competent level of finish but in FO76 it's just insulting and arrogant.
---
With the amount of time between installments in Bethesda's games the level of polish should be far higher. They need to sit down and reevaluate what they want from the industry. Either sell off its franchises to companies more suited to producing them and stick to publishing (something they are admittedly good at) or get back to what made its games so fantastic.
---
You can see it in the challenge tab under "Character" challenge. Thing is, I don't know how I can use this bat painting we unlocked today...
---
Got it first run, wanted the pirate one tho :p. I think it was around 10% to get an outfit, so 2.5%? Not sure tho
---
So I have gotten the blue screen five times logging in. I have gone to safe mode, rebuilt database and restored license. I still get blue screens logging into FO. Any other suggestions?  Please help a lady get into her game!!
---
how is this not illegal? just hard to catch a company doing it?
---
I have the outfit! Haven't gotten the helmet yet!
---
I got lucky, I got [this](https://i.imgur.com/NqJrLjG.png) on the first Mischief Night I did.
---
&gt; you can deny deny deny without sufficient proof against you.
---
Hey, speaking of "proof," I decided to ctrl-F this thread for the word proof to find someone asking you to provide some evidence of your claims, and your having done so. I haven't seen that in this thread yet. Indeed, not even any curiosity on the topic. Perhaps you could give an inquiring mind some reason to believe that you're not just trolling here.
---
I've completed the event every time I joined, and I joined it every time since it began today.
---
Only the first time I died and couldn't respawn but I still got the rewards.
---
It's being payed to lie to get people to buy products that are negitivily received.
---
How‚Äôs this for forgetting, I deleted the game.
---
That would be so freakin' cool!  I would even be willing to spend some atoms on that.  Upvote!  ;-)
---
Who runs a bank in the post apocalypse?
---
WHAT??!!
---
You are one of the lucky ones I suppose
---
Fallen Sword was definitely like this. People maxing out their credit cards to battle for the number one player spot.
---
They won't be exclusive to Fallout 1st.
---
But they'll take a lot of CAMP budget.
---
And they'll sell you the camp budget.
---
Lol. . . That kinda sucks.  But, maybe it's intentional.  The whole "trick or treat" thing for Halloween.
---
IMO everything but the private server should be free from 1st
---
Is the helmet the one you get from Captain Kid or whatever the robo vender is in the Whitesprings toy store? Or is there a secret fourth hidden outfit XD
---
It may be that you have to many friends.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know. I mean if you were caught trashing a company you can get sued for defamation or other things. But I‚Äôm not sure about promoting a company in positive light- aside from false advertising
---
Please tell me I‚Äôm not the only one who see broom up the arse with that decoration
---
Wait really? Since when was this a thing, do you have any proof?
---
You got it on sale. That's great. Most paid 70-250 for it. This game crashes hourly too. It also doesn't work on fundamental levels. Weapons are unbalanced, they lied about numerous features. Who cares about COD?
---
Bug fixes? Which ones? Because half the time, they manage to rebreak previous fixes. Or how about the simple bugs that they have yet to address? But hey guess what? You get a neat little label in the cash shop to tell you if an item is new! Yay! I mean most of the guns are underpowered, or overpowered and melee is still broken after nearly a year. But yeah they put a few cursory fixes in here and there. The game is still broken. How many patches so far have rolled the client back to a previous version and opened up the same bugs they fixed before?
---
Because a single player sequel isn't the same as re configuring an entire single player RPG for multiplayer. Oh and who is to blame for that? Bethesda. And you know what? New Vegas somehow managed to produce a better roleplaying experience and improve on the system adding many features we take for granted today, in HALF THE TIME. And Bethesda still managed to find a way to screw Obsidian out of their bonus for the effort.
---
Obviously you're so angry that you make up crap about me to make you feel better. I've been playing since I preordered the Tricentennial Edition back in 2018 (you know back when the paints weren't advertised as being for only 3 damn weapons). My character is around 90-ish iirc. Got a neat camp just across the street from the Nuka Plant (as I made Nuka Girl as my character).
---
So go ahead and shove that key right back up your ass. While I'm shoving my previous comment back up mine. The game rarely if ever becomes unplayable. 
---
But it's still a giant mess. Frankly it gets depressing trying to get those few guns that can kill things without blowing my entire ammo supply. Eventually I log off. Also gave up on ever taming an animal because the system is so restricted and half assed.
---
I actually enjoy the game to a certain degree hopping up onto buildings with marsupial is awesome. I actually came back last week, with one of the guys I got to preorder with me. 
---
That doesn't mean I'm wrong though.
---
NANI???
---
Now it is all about karma farming.
---
Haha get it? Because Bethesda bad
---
Pretty much. And losing.
---
It goes on an assault rifle
---
Double XP events if you can, sleep when needed for that 5% xp, make some food that give you 10%xp, do the lighthouse event for 5% more xp. Use mentats (normal or grape) and food and drink that give you more CHR and/or INT before you finish a quest, and you'll max out your xp gain like crazy. If you happen to team up with someone with the right perk, you can even add 15% more xp.
---
If they were in private worlds, how did you see them?
---
I am a fallout 1st subscriber and I thought it was common knowledge we had wasteland era already?
---
Just kidding.  Just trying to fuel the fire :)
---
I can‚Äôt even get into FO. I keep getting blue screen logging in.
---
No idea I've never seen that vendor. The helmet is red.
---
I know, it‚Äôs just sad.
---
What are you looking to learn more about? I can try to provide some clarity, I‚Äôm not trolling I don‚Äôt see exactly how you would gather that.
---
ITS GRAFTON DAY...AGAIN.
---
Biv comes off as endearing to me. I feel a little warmth when he invites me to come back again.
---
This isn't specific to this sub, it's in many gaming subs. Defend anything unpopular and you get called a shill, or whatever. Hate on anything popular and you're a hater. There's no consideration for the validity of your argument.
---
I want a Giddyup Buttercup!
---
Oh, I have a friend who's charging up fusion cores for me on his private server so it's not like I have issues getting any of the fusion cores etc. also I've bought some pretty cheap ones that are fully charged aswell from player shops. It's so cool!
---
I mainly wear it because I'm going heavy weapon (got the .50 gun thing, I want the flamer/pyrolizer but my luck is so bad lol) and I have the perk that... either ignores armor or does more dmg to enemies while I'm shooting a heavy weapon whilst in a power armor. 
---
I've found it quite useful to jump around servers and farm the fallen space station for space suits/helmets - they give quite a lot at the vendor aswell, apparently..
---
It is being paid to express the virtues of a product.
---
Probably some robot. Maybe tie it into a quest where you have to find a teller ai to upload to them. And this is how they "learn" how to use this item.
---
Sure but for an individual consumer the rules are different, not for competing businesses like Obsidian and Bethesda
---
They wont charge for it outright as that would certainly upset about 90%+ of the base but they will almost certainly give 1st members access first maybe 2-3 months in advance hints the name first it is not a coincidence.
---
No, your statement is factually incorrect according to the premise of the post where your statement was written as a reply. =)
---
yeah, what he said
---
Also, do your dailies, there are few quests that give you usefull stuff at level 50 so don't worry about it and aim for the xp.
---
I made a new character and hit 50 in a week by not doing any quest (wanted to see if the stuff was worth it at level 50) and I only gain my xp in the forest and in the toxic Valley by doing events and dailies.
---
What's your XBOX GT?
---
You still need to buy the most recent DLC though.
---
4 Tries today with 50% getting kicked with lag and not being able to return in time for the event on the Xbox.  I am going to try again tomorrow with the looking at the ground to avoid the ‚ÄúExplosive Lag‚Äù trick another poster mentioned, but holy heck, I wish they did not make blowing up the cars part of the objective.  Maybe try it out on a private server to avoid the lag.
---
I‚Äôm having same issue. I‚Äôve blue screened 5 times. I restored License and rebuilt database but no luck.  If I have to reinstall it will take 3 days   Any other suggestions?
---
Would be funny
---
not sure I remember that one what color and style? ballcap? fedora?
---
I mean 2/3 ain't bad and Elsweyr will get on there eventually.
---
7pm ps4 ran fine
---
It might be the same one then. Thanks for the info!
---
I and many spent the first six to nine months getting wrecked by the children of atom in this thread for making any criticism that they kept calling haters. Bugs and dcs swamped the place and you couldn‚Äôt say a damned thing. It‚Äôs been a long time coming for the backlash. I love this game, Hell im subbed to the monthly and hopefully it pans out to be worth it. But only thing I‚Äôm tired of is the you gotta pay for the servers somehow arguments and outer worlds card everyone‚Äôs pulling. They just want profit and outer worlds lives in the shadows of fallout new Vegas.  The game has problems and it‚Äôs gonna get voiced just the same as every stupid post about new item ideas for the store.
---
Lol still trying to argue when I'm just shit talking at this point I haven't read anything you said how do you feel knowing that you've just wasted time on nothing haha that is the reality here I am and will always be right in every shape and form and you will always be wrong no matter what you say or do.
---
I'll try this, last time I just walked around and lit the fires. Not the best way to have fun but I didn't crash so
---
Ok but lowkey, what if they leave it in, say its gone, but treat it as a running joke?
---
I am joking.
---
I'm not generalizing anything.
---
Comment OP clearly indicated the source he linked is an avowed leaker with several prove-able revelations attributed.
---
Your response was that anyone could have made those predictions, probably intending to discredit the source. 
---
That's a hindsight fallacy, you just assume the predictions were easy to make because you have all the relevant details after the fact.
---
Also, downvoting someone who disagrees with you is petty. Be better.
---
I encounter super mutants and mole miners quite regularly on the 2nd floor
---
Stuff does feel like it got tougher with the 1st update.
---
Its not just you. 
---
My whole crew were talking about it after our SBQ farm on private servers last night.
---
Um... what?
---
I saw a camp with a basement.  On the platform was an opening so you could step off, falling to your death and winding back up on the surface.  The vending machines were down there.  Very cool!  I came back to my CAMP and spent the next hour or so realizing I could not repeat it.
---
You did not have to jump off, it was free to fast travel back to his CAMP, but falling was way cool.
---
It was a wrap that covered the face. It was beige and looked like it kind of went with the long coat.
---
For event reward such as unique plans and things, yes. You have to complete the event. The legendary obviously gives legendary loot. 
---
There are witch hats on mannequins at the cottages, the usual WS loot inside the cottages, and if you trick or treat, you get real candy such as bubblegum or cotton candy bites. 
---
That‚Äôs all I can think of at the moment!
---
Since the start? Search on reddit about legendary and the green mist. You'll better understand why people hate trigger happy players on events. I learned it myself few month ago.
---
I would imagine that‚Äôs true, although OP just said she wanted to build around it. Not sure how close the game would let her place her camp tbh. Never tried before.
---
Fancy way of saying being payed to artificially make things look good to trick people into buying them. When anyone without money does that its called a scam.
---
Listen I have the most boring job ever at work tonight so I have to do something for entertainment.
---
If you liked FO4  there is a high likelihood you'll enjoy FO76. Very similar look and most of the basics feel like they've been cut and pasted from FO4. Vats is completely different, it took me a while to get used to 76's version though. If it's on sale for a fiver, then grab it, play for a week and evaluate how you feel after that.
---
I don‚Äôt think this is a consistent thing. I‚Äôve attacked ‚Äòpre-legendaries‚Äô before they‚Äôve finished ‚Äòupdating‚Äô and still had them become 3-star and drop 3-star loot. 
---
Now, if you end up **killing** then before they finish updating, you might not get anything. 
---
Is that what you mean?
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs called **Green Hood**
---
There was a Hunter‚Äôs Hood stolen from Dev rooms on PC at one point or-other...
---
Maybe
---
Yeah idk lol
---
Your welcome
---
Hunters hood has a red mask bandana. Dev room item as my understanding.
---

---
I‚Äôm glad you said this because I‚Äôve noticed it too and thought I was going nuts. Gone through a ton of stims playing the Mischief event today.
---
That's gonna earn you some bonuses the more passive aggressive the better
---
Spending atoms on cosmetics that you can't display in cases isn't a value add.  Would be nice to show off more stuff is what he's saying.  Including unlockables from NW like the helmets.
---
Todd Howard is Satan. It has to be true!
---
Not to be rude, but does this include the game from launch?
---
 I mean how much Bullshit have all us put up with from this company. 
---
A broken game at launch, and to be honest, it is worse now than ever before. To all the broken promises, and controversies. I get it, buyer beware.
---
 But we are a community of really brilliant people, and a few assholes in between. There is a place for everyone. 
---
But nonetheless we all have  made this broken down golf cart work, with all the bugs, and glitches. And continued to defend, and support the game when the weak gave up, and walked away in the beginning. 
---
We ask for the simplest things,  and get taxed on it as if it is a privilege, and not a right. 
---
To be honest, in my opinion, it takes to to make it work. 
---
Instead we keep getting the short end of the stick.
---
 I would have had no problem with paying for the subscription, but for what? 
---
More frustrating broken game play. More broken promises, like the NPC'S. 
---
I have said it before, I feel like a donkey, chasing a false carrot. 
---
This not how you treat those, who make an effort to help support a broken game. And this not how you treat your extended family of your game. 
---
Because I believe, we may be different people, from all over the world, with different views, and different Ideas,  but in the end, we all come together as a community, a family, and make it work. 
---
I really wish that Bethesda, would step into our shoes for once, and see through our eyes, instead of the bottom line for there investors. 
---
With out this community there is no revenue for there botom line in the end anyway. 
---
I apologize for getting carried away,  from your comment. But I am really not happy, and kind of taking this issue to heart. 
---
I truly wish you, and everyone the best. I hope that eventually we will all be able to find a  happy, and healthy medium. So that we can make Appalachia great again. 
---
Kindest Regards,

Jay Bird
---
I just don‚Äôt see this. When you sell junk, what you‚Äôre really selling is the convenience of time saving. There are still plenty of players that either don‚Äôt have FO1st and/or don‚Äôt want to spend their limited time grinding for junk.
---
Yes my PS4 blue screens before the event is over.
---
A giant one? Okay all of us, let's forget about fallout 1st, 1st priority now is to make Bethesda implement a giant giddyup buttercup moddable and rideable AND FREE
---
It is what I mean. Doing a crazy amount of damage is okay, but on my 3 evebts tonight, people were going full auto on the sentry bot, still updating, jilling it each time with only one star..

So are we

That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm guessing they aren‚Äôt available without trading crazy stuff for it then. :(

Nope. That's the best way.

No. You paid for a broken mess
---
How you people deal with all this crap?

It‚Äôs the hunters hood. Shame it isn‚Äôt available.

If only there were a series of missions that explained all that...wait...there is.
---
They mentioned they fixed enemy aiming or something with the last patch  
---
&gt; **Enemies:**¬†Fixed an issue that could cause ranged enemies to have difficulties targeting players.
---
I said I can't defend them anymore, so, that would suggest I CANT.

Okay, now I get it. Like, you can‚Äôt display an item that has an Atomic Shop skin applied?

I‚Äôve never tried that, so forgive my confusion.

But wait!  You can.

I know, right?
---
(the rad rats)
---
Not much you can do. A few months ago i was blue screening constantly. I installed the game on the ps4 than on an external HDD and it didnt help a bit. Ive been blue screening again since last week. Its the game most likely not a bad install or console issue.
---
Do you mean the [Wrapped Cap](https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Wrapped+Cap)? I think I've got one of them on XB1.
---
Fancy way of describing marketing.

I'm done. No time for whiny bitches that downvote to disagree.

Yep my GF and I play almost daily 4-15hrs depending since beta and we have been getting our ass' kicked. (Lvl 273 &amp; 180ish)
---
For a moment I thought I was at r/theouterworlds
---
No u. =D!
---
Nice try PR shill
---
Yes! I was thinking the same thing earlier.
---
Can You maybe help me with the right perk/mutations
---
You say you don't care either way, so you'll be content when you'll need to have a sub to play at all? Then the people who say "I subbed to support the game" , okay fair enough, but you also show you are willing to pay for digital nothings which encourage this shitty shit to begin with. Eventually its going to lead to a forced subscription if you want anything or any newer content and the base game have dead worlds while all this shills play in separate,more populated worlds while base gamers/Fallout 2nd class suffer.
---
The consequences of supporting digital nothings are far more severe than most people imagine them to be. You're on a side, you just won't admit it, everyone is tho. I want the game to succeed and or get better, but not have everything paywalled in the process. If that is the case, I will happily move on from this shit immediately. BGS is a company,yes...but they are not going to get a dime from me until the base game isn't in Beta anymore and all to most of the major flaws are fixed, I'm not going to pay for something that is still broken at its core.

They dont have much to be excited about anyways and frankly they shouldnt. At this point even if you are a fan of fallout and enjoy 76, you are going against yourself if you dont speak up, this will only get worse.
---
They are under floor decor, but you will need real pumpkins to craft them and place them at your camp. So hit up the pumpkin house and farm some pumpkins.
---
It‚Äôs called the hunters hood. Unfortunately it was a dev room item.
---
the ultimate lifeprotip about gaming laptops is: never buy a gaming laptop
---
and very few people actually have a situation where it makes sense to it instead of a desktop. It's also more cost effective to have a powerful desktop and a meh laptop.
---
For now with all the saturation of players it‚Äôs good. Afraid once people start afking in mass and nuking it constantly for the lols it‚Äôll just be annoying. Can‚Äôt seem to get any patterns but I did get the full suit so that‚Äôs something.
---
I'm a simple man, I see Free States content and I upvote it.
---
On the few occasions where I've become wanted, and didn't want to be, I sent in game messages to people on the map and told them I'd meet them at Vault 76.  It has worked every time.
---
I am become blue screen of death.
---
I prefer demonized.
---
Most likely. Ive never seen one in game or on the trading subs. Probably not worth it anyways. May come out with wastelanders.
---
That sounds cool. I could fux with that.
---
Touch√©
---
Where do you farm acid?
---
Well TIL. What the heck... isn‚Äôt this like illegal? False advertising. ‚ÄúMr Smith says this is great‚Äù but Mr Smith doesn‚Äôt exist. Some kind of BS if you ask me.
---
This basically reads as "I used to be a 'paid shill' so I am proof they exist, and since bethesda=bad and we call lots of people shills we can therefore assume Bethesda has paid shills shilling positivity just like we all have been claiming since we got upset in the first place."
---
Seriously, I have lost all interest in the game and am in no way defending it, but this is a pretty baseless post. Without going into Specifics like names, what type of company did you act as a shill for OP? What sort of product or service did they sell?
---
Has anybody even done a ‚Äúsloppy seconds‚Äù deal yet? Cause it seems prime time for it!
---
Who needs caps?
---
Nope, this does not include the game from launch. Promises and marketting bs in the start are not legally binding. I get everyone is pissed off with it and are letting their emotions cloud their mind. The game was and is still a shit show, there is no denying that. Here is where it differs.
---
False promises and such are not law. This new subscription IS legally binding, as we have signed a contract by paying for the subscription. Beth MUST keep fallout first as it is, otherwise it is unlawful and can land them legally in hot water. 
---
I get yes, their practises are quite questionable, but again, this is not law. Breaking contracts is far different to them lying about the game etc. Even things that have been said by reps, that are blatant lies are not unlawful. That is marketting.
---
Because Bethesda is shit and this game only serves as a cow to milk them money, the developers care but the higher ups dont, the game can be in the shittiest state ever but as long as there will be people stupid enough to give them their money, enough to make it a profit, they wont care about the rest.
---
I personally like there being actual factions in fallout. It gives more life to the game when you see lots of people settling together. Maybe don‚Äôt do it just cause someone spent 13$ on something. Everyone has their reasons for buying it
---
That's pretty nice of ya.
---
Make the choice. Spacer's Choice.
---
&gt; We caught our marketing 
---
so you don't know what your marketing is doing?
---
Most likely a limitation of networked physics - a lot of multiplayer games don‚Äôt support this unless it‚Äôs necessary to the core gameplay.
---
I haven't paid a penny for Xbox Live in years, because you can get it for free by simply using Bing instead of Google. I also get 200+ games free, including AAA titles day one, not a year or two after release. Most importantly, I also don't have to worry about hackers in my PvP lobbies, or underpopulated/empty lobbies. I own literally every console for the past several generations, as well as several gaming PCs. I never play competitive games on PCs as a rule. I know better. If you ignore a cost of 3-5 times that of a console, gaming on PC is pretty cheap, especially with piracy rampant, but the multiplayer PvP experience is also pretty cheap. FO76 isn't exactly that, but your last statement isn't about FO76.
---
unfortunately they're human, and damaged humans cannot be repaired
---
I find it odd,that the original poster didnt mention what company they had worked for..
---
But yeah paid shill,  is a job .
---
You assume they left it in as if they could foresee what would happen.  If the Devs designed a button to do that and warned people that this button exists, then yes.  If the intent of that button was for something else but players used it only for killing lower level/less equipped players, then that's on the players using them.  It still boils down to you wanting to specifically target players because they purchased an in-game feature.
---
Everything I'm getting here from you is telling me that because you had some bad experiences in the past from players that made the game unfun for you, you're okay with becoming the very player you hated in the past. You are okay with making a game unplayable for others.
---
Bloodied rifle build here...I carry 2 weapons...Bloodied Lever Action and a Bloodied explosive assault rifle...I carry about 3000 ammo of 556 and 45 on average...i have one piece of armor each weight reduction class....So, 20 to my ammo and 20 to my weapons....My carry weight varies according to my rads and health, usually between 355 and 455...My base weight I carry with everything is about 180-200 depending on mainly the aid I am carrying.....For SBQ I go PA and take off my bloodied build and use a TSE gauss and TSE lever...Lever for the adds and the gauss for the Queen...Sometimes I will go half bloodied and use my BE laser rifle and BFFR gamma gun....the laser rifle just breaks to damn much...I had to really tweak the build, rifle and bloodied are a hard mix so you have to kind of find a nice min/max and go with it
---
Your a bit hard on him tbh , y got to think he's been through ALOT.
---
Do you know the process/lore of actually making a robobrain? 
---
They take an actual human brain, usually a convict and literally mind wipe/reprogrammed aka like a cyberman (Dr who)
---
The ordeal usually makes the robobrain batshit crazy, the students actually did biv a favour by making him drunk af
---
Then put it in the Atom Shop. Pay walling the most requested outfit behind FO1st was a cold, calculated move.
---
joke's on you, it's a Vault-Tech experiment
---
I am glad its not just me I have noticed this as well and experienced the same issues.
---
Haha you're gay now.
---
They already know all about trying to make money from the creation club and how well that worked the first time.
---
Though they will totally do it again here.
---
Lips are sealed.
---
Those laws didn't affect ESO in the slightest and that's not the only game that was not affected.
---
I'm an imaginative person and I always loved the fallout lore. I played them all except for the phone game. 
---
1. I like to explore by running around. The map is huge. 
---
2. I enjoy trolling people's camps
---
3. I also enjoy killing things along with other people everyonce in a while
---
4. I like to roleplay different characters and different character layouts. 
---
5. I'm still discoverying how different mods effect different guns.
---
I honestly haven't really plunged into base building much. All I have is your basic 5 by 4 with defenses. 
---
Cons
---
Random disconnects. Lack of good repeatables.
---
boatflies
---
I can actually carry far more weight with my deep-pocketed armor so wearing PA actually reduces the weight I can carry.  As soon as I equip my PA, my carry weight drops by 50 I think, so I can't wear it all the time lol
---
I've also never bought any fusion cores but I do farm them sometimes but I can make them at my tinker station.  I also use a 3* Gatling plasma while not in PA but I dont have the perk for it I think.
---
I do the same thing with the straight jackets as far as vendor selling.  I get something like 48caps each?
---
You can do that.
---
Good tip
---
To be honest I though they added that then realized one guy had his mic on lol
---
except either Hines or Bethesda are fraudsters
---
the reason you see scrap boxes everywhere may be as simple as those who hate it aren't playing
---
My thoughts exactly. Not matter what, people are gonna shit on this game anyways.
---
I Feel like i Am using way more fusion cores then before.
---
Dude, "Fallout First" was literally copied from ESO premium subscription "ESO+".
---
The prices are similar, they both give you unlimited storage for crafting materials, they provide the same amount of atoms/crowns, except ESO has PAID DLCs, which go free with the subscription.
---
By the way, ZOS are probably even better than Bethesda in fucking up the performance of their game. Just visit the ESO official forums and see all the shitshow happening there since the start of the recent in-game event.
---
It's both funny and confusing to see people reacting completely different to the same thing depending on the most trendy opinion.
---
My melee character issue with ghouls has always been the rads they deal  more than the actual damage from them. I eventually started using diluted rad-x and that helped a lot.
---
started to wonder why i had to run from lvl 28 robots
---
Yeah?
---
TO CLARIFY: I was actually gifted the game. I basically agree with most of the ‚Äúgaming world‚Äù that Fallout 76 is one of the worst video games to release in recent years and has harmed my trust in Bethesda Softworks as a developer. I‚Äôm now skeptical of ES6 and Starfield. 
---
THAT BEING SAID, I don‚Äôt want my video to be one-sided, I have my own opinions, I‚Äôm more interested in giving a voice to those who DO like the game so that context can be formed. 
---
What I think the game lacks in quality and competence, it makes up for with how its COMMUNITY generates a welcome social space and I think it‚Äôs an interesting idea for a video: ‚Äúwhy does the community play it?‚Äù
---
Older gamer with kids as well. I usually play at night before bed time
---
My god don‚Äôt tell they will explode
---
Do you think anyone wants a fasnacht pole lantern in their camp? No. People want it because they want to collect shit. It still goes for thousands of caps. Same with other items.
---
Fireproof and dense chest makes you invincible against that scorchbeast scream. I stand in it with zero effect.
---
Ah ok
---
Thank you soldier
---
&gt;your narrative would have us assume he is playing the game without enjoyment for 100's of hours, that's ridiculous, and you know it.
---
Calls out an "assumption" by making an assumption...
---
Your hypocrisy is astounding.
---
Speaking of assuming, no I actually do pity the person if that's how they view the idea of justifying the value of the game.
---
Come on dude. If you're doing to attack someone's argument, at least do it with some basis of foundation, not hypocrisy and unfounded assumptions that just aren't supported by the facts.
---
I also felt like this was going on but was not sure. I think spoil rate might be off again maybe they screwed up and rolled back some fixes wouldn't be the first time.
---
So you were a person with no moral compass and because of feeble people like you we get idiot trolls accusing us of being "shills" when we express our real feelings.
---
Thanks mate.
---
Didn't know that they could upgrade, did know however that they could regen so as a solo player it has always been in best interests ( i thought) to kill the legendary enemies ASAP.
---
Not in PvP
---
Saltuna. Melts your fork, and your teeth!
---
Tbh there's normally a few seconds before the rads hit, so what I do is go to my pipboy and highlight the power power I have. If I respawn in the nuke zone, I go on my pipboy, place it, jump and then run back to the fight. After I collect it and highlight it again.
---
Not the best way I imagine but it's the fastest way I found
---
A few do, most are just being dramatic. Not coping, laughing at the FO76 drama queens.
---
oh oh PM me so I can abuse my private world.
---
Me please thanks papi
---
i only use the halloween costume skull mask, not sure if that is enough, i aint got a full costume
---
So if it's one per day, does that mean you can only unlock it on that one day? If so that's pretty crap since a good amount of us, myself included, are busy through the week and can't play daily.
---
Why PA?  Good armor is better than PA.
---
Just bought Pirate outfit and cap from Whitespring station vendor, someone obviously sold it to robot, so it must be pretty common.

---
This is the build I run that I use as bloodied sniper and swappable to a cammando its not built for pvp or anything but it suits me and should give you some ideas
---
Right now, 1st is a selfish p2w stab in the back. Why cant people benefit from people who "pay to support" a poor billion dollar company to keep the lights on (lawl). If Joe is going to shell out cash for whatever then in the same vein, it should better the game and us. 
---
Allow me to craft 3 to 5 sets of the NV armor for others (limited charges), allow ALL players to use the scrap box, but only subs can build them. Etc etc.
---
Seriously, we're all from the same vault here.
---
At the same time, wouldn't other companies do the same to discredit products from rival companies? Post negative reviews for rival products?
---
I feel like its a 2 way street and people just need to do more research into each game. You can literally watch game play on YouTube and make your own choice. Dont base anything you do off of what ANYONE says or writes. Watch the damn video muted if you cant help yourself.
---
There is a reason no one cares about Yelp reviews anymore. There is a reason people dont listen to IGN anymore. If a person has something to gain from a review, it WILL be skewed.
---
Pm me, please?
---
pm me? i got 1st but idk what you mean
---
Thats what i do at least. Returns for me vary widely though. I generally get about the same amount of acid as syringes spent
---
I wish i knew lol enjoy brother!
---
Bruh I'm in marketing. But also I hate big corps.
---
Run a buisness honest. If you had any right being in industry you wouldn't need shills.
---
Was it like that for fasnacht?
