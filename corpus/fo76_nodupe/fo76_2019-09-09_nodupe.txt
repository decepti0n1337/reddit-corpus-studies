As long as you actually have enough perk points that you could swap them out.  Someone with 1 perception shouldn't be able to lock pick a level 3 lock
---
---
---
An alternative to that is cooked scorchbeast meats if you've got carnivore mutation, not as strong but still 600 health
---

---
Earle died while I was falling down it after a respawn and it killed me.
---
On my sniper I pretty much just have the suit + Evasive with max agility, which is about 185 defenses total. Still fairly squishy, but everything pretty much gets dispatched too quickly to attack me, or my stealth never gets broken and they just don't find me, even when I'm dumping several magazines into their face.
---

---
On my unarmed character for nuke zones I run the suit with Barbarian and Evasive (with max strength and agility, for about +125 DR and +45 ER) and Ironclad (+50 DR/ER), and then the Scaly Skin (+50 DR/ER) and Grounded (+100 ER) mutations. These mutations are boosted 25% with the Strange in Numbers perk. I also run with the Empath mutation because (it seems) the damage reduction for the team applies to you as well, so that's about -25% damage taken too. Sometimes I run the Dodgy perk, which is -30% damage taken per hit but at the cost of 30AP, so good for fights with enemies who hit less often, but harder, cuz it'll drain your AP real fast if you get mobbed.
---
Edit - DR and ER have diminishing returns though, so stacking them only goes so far. Things that reduce damage by a percent are usually much better. 300-350 DR and ER is a good number to shoot for though (IIRC). Beyond that you start reducing damage less and less for each point you add.
---
I bought the chest and jet pack first thing after getting enough gold.  I like the vertical option.  Bloodied build but 2 cusioned legs and 1 piece of 50% fall dmg armor all but negate any dmg.  
---
FYI, use a spike board in your camp as a catapult to fly across the map, literally.
---
I agree. I have FO1st and totally understand that things change. So tired of people botching about what was gonna be offered and what is. Bethesda explained why they did what they did but they don’t listen. Having FO1st does not indeed entitle you to anything more then what is currently listed.
---
Monthly or yearly?
---
Steam, Beth's launcher, Console, or GamePass?
---
I’m too introverted............
---
It's also worth mentioning that document is over a year old and basically a compilation of random people's findings so while handy It's certainly questionable. I normally have no interest in youtubers but have a lot of respect for angryturtle, they definitely know their stuff.
---
It must be easier to do on console, because this is definitely not an issue on PC, or at least for me.  I don’t press Z much unless I’m in my stash.
---
[deleted]
---
I didn't realize that one. I've always got a few of those. Thanks for the tip!
---
Yep this exact same thing happened to me. It was set to recurring and it still stop working 3 days earlier than it was supposed to. Called Bethesda and they said call Steam so I reached out to Steam and they said only Bethesda could fix it.
---
Ended up just calling my CC company and doing a chargeback because I didn’t get the full product that I paid for :/
---
Not 100% sure, but: open the map (or friend list?) hover at the top bar where you can see your faction reputation. Click to set „new Public team goal“. It’s a bit hidden, but it’s there :)
---
I've reported one group, and even paid money to get their cheating program and then upload it to bethesda's official support about one month ago, but the official team **gave no actual response and I think they will never.** So the last chance is the next mantainance and updating, or it's time to leave their ATM game for IPO.
---
Because we don't need the general, mindless droning that goes on in zone chat coupled with the sporadic ego clashes associated with it.
---
Whoever at Bethesda thought it was wise to have those rewards available for just a few short days on a holiday weekend is an idiot.
---
I accept your apology for telling me I was wrong, when I clearly wasn't.
---
I mean there *can* be chill mutants but they’re the vastly tiny minority.
---
I spent caps because I have Fallout 1st and there is a general lack of anything I really want in the atom shop, so I had quite a surplus.
---
No regrets, tho - the Michelin Man power armor is as cute as a button.
---
Great. An emote that I will never use and could figure out from others in two seconds without a emote. What a waste.
---
They are supposed to be bringing out perk load outs in the near future. I am looking forward to them so I can do just what you explain. Only then I would have to simply click a label to change what I want (building, PA, gun builds) things like that. Instead of having to turn each one on and off. Maybe then I will make use of the 120+ level ups I have for my cards. LoL.
---
GET 'EM OUT BOYS, WE DID IT!!
---
Only when I show up to a base that has 15-20 weapons/armor and it's all non-legendary super common drops. Or if they have 300 plans and it turns out to be nothing but mounted plans.
---
Yeah....that one is going to be in limbo for a long time or deleted if too long.
---
And that’s fine; you chose to prioritise other stuff to the point of not spending five minutes checking something that you knew would be time limited.
---
So why are you so salty? This is the result of your choice.
---
another OTHER pro-tip: if you create your own group and are alone in it, the game still considers you on a team for achievements.
---
Also, AngryTurtle is the REAL Overseer. Change my mind.
---
I personally never have had a problem with fall damage when using the SS jetpack and that's without goat legs or any fall damage armor pieces. Although I do have bird bones.
---
If you hold down the boost shortly before you hit the ground you'll be able to slow your fall enough to avoid fall damage in most cases, unless you're doing stuff like jumping off the top of Seneca Rocks.
---
pretty much the same as you. hate this mobile-esque bs.
---
Yup. Not buying it since it's full price. Saving for mannequins and power armor displays.
---
Nobody's going to like this.  
---
But the atom challenges needed to go.  
---
Of course, it's going to be met with anger like this and lashing out, it was people's avenue for getting free atomic shop content. Taking it away means many people just won't ever get that content.  
---
But I regret to inform you, that's the point.  
---
The content on the Atomic Shop isn't meant to be free, the money people put down on that content is important to continued support and development of the game. It justifies the development of massive free DLC and content updates. The ATX content needs to be paid for, not given away freely.
---
Well they shouldn't be permanently available, but they should be available up until the BoS actually arrive.
---
Never said they would ban a single person. I said they *could*. They can ban you over intentional exploitation of bugs. **Technically** magic weapon damage a bug. No one ever said stop using them. No one ever said you would get banned for using one without knowledge. But I've already said that before. 
---
Fuck it, I'm done with this exchange. It's like arguing with a merry-go-round.
---
I’d play more if there were more repeatable things. I like dungeons that have exclusive loot, like the burrows. But why would I waste thousands of ammo and time when I can get the same rewards from a legendary rat?
---
I can mod it but won't be on until later tonight. I have all the mods unlocked.
---
because no text chat means no need to constantly update/police/patrol a profanity filter.
---
Those are great ideas!  Would love to see some of these.
---
no. but if you invite to a team (not a public team) they can
---
Also: Keep in mind it appears things from the seasons will be continually added as purchasable with bullion. Even if you don't finish the season, you still can likely get what you want.
---
Ok thanks
---
Nah I'm not talking seasons like summer, fall, winter, spring like just some decorations around the are like lights and banners but If that does happen I can agree some peoples computer might not be able to handle it and thats not that fair.
---
Sounds like something out of an Ann Rice novel.
---
I remember wearing the Grillmaster hat during the cook challenge. I’m pretty certain it worked.
---
There’s a text chat mod on PC and the people there are some of the nicest people I’ve ever met. Usually around 30-40 people active at anytime and the text chat is global across servers.
---
People have a nice habit of announcing events and accepting FR’s for you to join them. On the weekends, I usually find a few people running efficient nukes with the whole server (ACP, SBQ -&gt; ACP, SBQ -&gt; ACP) and tons of Encryptid.
---
Lag makes it even more efficient. (More height.)
---
Agreed on AngryTurtle.  OG Overseer
---
Sounds like college all over again
---
lmfao I hurt myself laughing at this.
---
Dammit. Now I'll have to get it.
---
But they were, all of them, deceived, for another Ring was hacked...
---
Should be out at least a month early to start decorating like IRL!
---
Do you have to activate it or does it do it on its own? Also, thank you.
---
Perk loadouts are supposedly coming soon.  Though I did find out yesterday that the PC already has a mod that does that, so I'm gonna be trying it soon.  Swapping perks is certainly annoying, so I'm hoping this is the QoL addition that will help with that.
---
Well whitesprings is pretty done up with mischief night but that is event oriented. 
---
Maybe we'll get a better Christmas event that'll decorate the settlements.
---
Ooooooh. Now I want earl as a mall Santa in the galleria.
---
I have the same with explosive effect, broken after two minutes of shooting
---
id rather have the r91 handmade rifle skin over the vertibird power armor
---
Has happened to me with black powder pistols as well. Can fire 2 rapid shots per reload consistently for some reason. Haven't checked to see if it's been fixed in a few months.
---
This sounds like dialogue from family guy
---
1st Fallout game!? Wow you picked an interesting place to start. Glad your here thou :)
---
You said you "think" they have made magic weapons a bannable offense. 
---
I said hardly.
---
My ultimate point was, is and has been throughout this interaction with you that Bethesda has not made magic weapons a bannable offense.
---
You have to activate it.
---
Yeah, the normal ones are too weak and the legacy ones too strong
---
Pistols are fine. Not OP, and a bit slow as you rank up to level 50. But with the right build it’s a fun build. You won’t solo earl but it’s fine.
---
For me and given my main char's mutations:    
---
Corn Soup and a few other plant-based foods. I would never be on IRL b/c Bacon is LIFE.    
---
Grape Mentats supply for selling to vendors. Ammo along with the Ammo maker.    
---
I have been doing Biv's daily but haven't gotten a new recipe in at least a week. I might have them all by now.    
---
I would love to eventually craft two sets of PA. The Excavator and another for doing SBQ and other 'must be in irradiated area' to do X quest. I sell all meat I get b/c no one ever buys it from my CAMP. My punch bowl is full and never of Nukashine.    
---
I wouldn't mind crafting a piece of armor and a weapon at a slighly higher level for someone so they're are somewhat upgraded.
---
Easier than adding text chat it seems.
---
oh yeah I forgot about that was pretty nice
---
I soloed the queen yesterday.  It was great.  It took me essentially the entire time limit.
---
100%
---
Also in Bay Area Fire zone. Near, but outside evacuation zones, so didn’t miss because of that. However, the brief periods of being home from work coincided with power outages from energy overuse by people for the heat wave and then for safety shutoff for the wind-related fire risk. Just squeezed in for a little bit and managed to get the rewards before the power went out.
---
Good luck with the evacuations. Sorry other users can’t build Atom Shop items in your camp for you with the missed window. If it’s any consolation, the collectron mostly just insults your camp.
---
mainly any mod that turns the radium rifle automatic
---
I open the emote wheel, click on the emote and instantly hit esc after. It's gotta be super quick. But I do it all of the time. Once you get the hang of it it's second nature. (Reposted under your comment, I always mess that up).
---
I like the idea of forever forgoing the "can you hear me bro? Bro do you have a mic? You got a mic bro? Yo you hear me?" Guy
---
I was wondering. Even asked my stranger team mates.
---
And the old game board is there, unfinished, taunting me. Sadness. No fireplace secret door and cool power armor. The consolation prize is the new Lodge Bundle with the stone fireplace. Just not the same, but I did acquire it.
---
They did used to be good and I can vouch Ive been here from the very beginning. I remember the first scorch beast killing meta, pirate meta, carrying like 4 black powder rifles so you had 4 shots before any reloading had to happen.
---
Yeah I gave up on this game and moved on due to restrictions placed on the player when it came to things like bullion and script.
---
Thnx!
---
Plus they are basically budget free turrets
---
This
---
It's not the light that makes noise it's the emitter or the machine that makes the noise and a machine can be silenced. Our computers are a good example. I want silencers
---
Script is whatever, since it's not the only way to get legendary items that doesn't bother me. With bullion you can only get it from the trade machines and the quests meaning its what I would call hard time gated. Script is soft because you can just go out in the world and farm legendary drops anyway.
---
This is true, and it's definitely the least graceful, if not poorly designed, aspect of ACP.
---
I assume the whole reason they did this was to prevent players with Jetpacks from leaping back up the tunnel and missing their *Thrilling Escape Sequence (tm)*.  Except there's no reason to escape.  And even if players could shortcut around this, *so what?*  It affects a very small number of players, who would even think of doing it that way, and more power to them for "outsmarting" the system.
---
Instead, it's a total F.U. to anyone who happens to be there at the end of the battle, or anyone who respawns up top and now has to *backtrack the escape tunnel* to get back to looting Earle.
---
A text chat would invalidate camp vendor stations. “Wts bloody footlong” 
---
Why bother setting up a nice camp station and spend money on a bland game store when you can just spam your trades on chat.
---
Edit: personal opinion here, I honestly don’t like the idea of text chat in this game. And they should get rid of the adventure mode single player.
---
Totally agree, a pistol build is very viable. Plasma pistols are great, the 10mm is very good, and recently ive been running around just fine with my new Q2525 pipe pistol
---
With the right gauss pistol and some patience, you might even solo Earle.
---
I dont mind the grind - its the not being able to grind because of the restrictions thar gets to me the most
---
Because activating it in the middle of the week is counterintuitive. Read this thread and the one from the guy who was evacuated from California wildfires and you'll note this screwed a lot of people. 
---
I'm sorry this game is the only thing in your life and you were aware of this. But not everybody was, and that's maybe (gasp) on bad communication from Bethesda...
---
Yea I remember people using the bp rifles.
---
Unless it returns with a discount I won't be buying it. Again...
---
Explosive bait because of massive controversy surrounding it.
---
I don't care, want I want is more actual content, which is coming in a week, so I'm excited.
---
Yasssss thankyouuuu you the real MVP OP
---
Believe it or not, not everyone speak the same language, and most console players don't have a keyboard hooked up. So unfortunately it's not on there priority list right now.
---
Best part about a strength build
---
Legendary modules on sale? Most likely not...rolling for more junk isn't what I consider a sale.
---
I just found out about it yesterday! I log in at least once a week... apparently that's not enough...
---
I think it's more about Russia than China really
---
The season is over
---
You said you stopped in after a "long fight" so if you didn't pick up anything while you were playing I guess you are even dumber than I thought...
---
Nobody knew what they were doing back then. Barely anyone was level 50 you could just do what you wanted. Except use a flamer, 5 fuel per craft that shit was tough
---
It was only 2000 atoms purchase, Steam
---
Those are issues any game with text chat would have and yet it still exists in many online games. Or at least preset messages.
---
Enrique gets me.
---
uhh I'm not sure the Fallout games get far enough in China for Bethesda to start worrying about Armor Ace getting censored
---
I mean... they’re absolutely not to blame that this guy had to evacuate, or do you think they started the fires?
---
My heart goes out to you. Californias full of wildfires..
---
Couple more days!
---
There's about 72k gold bullion worth of things up for sale right now.
---
At 1700 a week that's 42 and a third week's of daily playing needed to buy everything. If they increased the daily amount to 400 it'd take about 23 and a quarter weeks to buy everything.
---
No reason not to increase the amount of daily gold you can get at this point. Especially not since they seem to plan on making all new things cost gold too.
---
Tbh the entire theme of the game is every government sucked, that’s how we got to the post apocalypse
---
Don't China has its own fallout shelter 2 that's online. So it must be somewhat popular to get its own game.
---
I think it’s more about the level of imperfection. For instance I think it’s obvious Bethesda has become dependent on their community for bug fixes. Their last four titles and the most downloaded mod for each is the community patch pack. Seeing as how 76 is online they can’t rely on the community for all these fixes and it shows.
---
Heck, I just joined but this community is far better than most. It took Bethesda 5 days to reply with “send us DxDiag” when my issue had nothing to do with system specs and everything to do with AI and pathing. This community helped and fixed my problem within 3 hours.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy 76 but it has major issues that have been around a while. I don’t mind supporting a game but I would expect a bit more back and forth with the dev team and company for such a rough game. They should be embracing the community, taking in the opinions and concerns and fixing what the community deems necessary. We don’t need a re-skinned BRC outfit that was re-skinned from FO4. I’d much rather have more bug fixes.
---
PSA: don’t use the Legendary Run CAMP skin. It will break your allies at the very least.
---
Ok I had this same question and I really don’t understand why they wouldn’t allow atoms to be used if the board is still up? Even just locked to the ones you already have or purchased only. That seems like an easy way to generate revenue to me from last minute folx like myself who don’t pay attention because real life takes over my time. :3

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

---
\- Vending: Yes.  30 slots per machine.  A limit of 4 machines.  Note, if you're trying to sell multiples of an item, it will only take up one slot in your machine as long as you have it priced the same (and it's in the same machine).  So if you want to sell 30,000 rounds of 5.56 ammo for 1 cap each, that's only one slot.  But if you sell another few rounds for 2 caps, and that's another slot.
---
\- Allies: You can only have one ally active at your camp at a time.  However, keep in mind that moving Daguerre in won't cause you to lose Beckett forever.  You just have to "scrap" one out to fit the other in.  So run one storyline, swap and do the other.  (Note: As someone mentioned, server hop to sync ally swaps.  They do act as if you're a visitor when you first put them in.  So they won't give out missions until they recognize you.)
---
\- Power: Conduits are the cleanest look to me, but they can be tricky to master.  Some items still require running power lines to, so you can't completely get rid of those.  Conduits can also produce some awesome designs that aren't only limited to power use, but it can also eat up budget if you're not careful.  Do what works for you.
---
I also recommend the fusion generator.  If you don't have it, do one of the "Powering Up" events at the power plants until you get it.  It produces 100 power and (as far as I know) uses just as much camp budget as the other generators and you'll likely only need the one.
---
Also, have fun!
---
I didn't donate shit and got everything anyways...none of the atomic shop shit should be time gated anyways
---
on line now, nmart
---
I need to keep my eyes open for a good energy pistol for daily ops. Since stealth isnt gonna be a thing for those
---
It’d be really cool if they added perks to make more builds possible. Like a fire build that uses the flamer and molotovs. 
---
Some of the coolest weapons just can’t compete with basic rifles and .50 cal these days.
---
Sell all plans/recipes I have from all my characters at 1 cap each. Even rare ones.  Ammo 1 cap, magazines/boobleheads 10 caps. Screws at 3 caps. My inventory gets full quickly.
---
Hard lemonade and Sunshine Oil because I crave AP.
---
Radshield on one of my alts so I can give be it to the other toons.
---
You can buy 300 a week for 6k from smiley in the tavern by the overseer camp
---
I agree 100% with the OP.
---
What’s the controversy? I don’t know if I’m aware..
---
"Enjoy the event, don’t turn it into a job. That’s not Bethesda doing it to you, that’s you doing it to yourself" I mean literally all of games design and cognitive-behavioral theory says you're wrong but thanks Mom, good pep talk!
---
Where are you all when I'm plan shopping? Everywhere I look it's 300 for a mounted mole rat, 250 for basketball hoop...
---
I agree it literally doesn't hurt anyone. (Did you mean 1400 a week or is there some way I'm not aware of to get the extra 300) thanks to the guy who told me about the 300 you can buy for caps.
---
I was bummed the bloodied didn’t work! Had to cook everything in the damn normal one lol
---
Jen’s mother points out that life in the US was still leagues better in spite of that fact
---
you okay there, pal? You need a hug or something?
---
You need to be chased by Scorchedbeasts ridden by Colonel Gutsys when you put it on.
---
They could even just drop 25% charged cores and it would be at least something, seems really silly to exclude two guns in particular.
---
A 3\* wedding ring placed by a 1\* company.
---
Well what's a op or better weapon choice? I was going to go with pistols cause that's usually what I do in the other fallout games. They are lightweight and with the right mods in 3 and 4 were long ranged and powerful as hell. I'm open for suggestions.
---
Make new alt, leave vault for level, delete alt.
---
I had a similar issue today, I have like a smidge left on my reputation bar until I top out. I found out that Fishbones also give a rep quest, and its actually much easier (kill a small swarm of mirelurks attacking the camp)
---
I did not find out if the two dailies interfere with each other, does anyone know about that?
---
I also missed picking it up. Put it back up on the atom shop for those of us who we're away for a few days.
---
Couldn't even be mad about it cause it was just so glorious
---
Only only able to eat raw meat.  No bread for you.

You on xbox?
---
One day I was in the area and the mobs were in my direct path so I thought ‘why not clear em out’ so as I crest a hill what do I see, a scorchbeast cropdusting the area. And boom it completed, acorchbeast buddy for the win. So now I just always assume that this is always the case when it completes
---
I use my 'shakes fist' emote lol it's one of my favs now.
---
Yeah, from what I've seen that's going to be a tricky event to solve with the guerrilla build. Crowd control can be a challenge indoors. At least adrenaline works again.
---
Ended about 8 hours ago, sorry

The wooden cube of mounted head plans
---
How do you stream from your xbox? I have the app, but I thought it was limited to the cloud games on there.
---
Ain't nothing wrong with being a high ass level in nw just shows the person loves playing it
---
I would love a 'No thank you' emote, the thumbs down and the 'No Way' just seems a bit harsh when I'm telling someone I don't want to trade or join their team.
---
At least it probably means they're not pvping the new players who are just trying to gather ressources from public workshops...
---
I have alot of respect for them...they are the real pvpers of this game !👍💪
---
Time to get disappointing rolls twice as fast. 
---
Still looking foward to it.
---
I just want them to bring back the vintage football underarmor lmfao
---
Yea i found the updated terms a little far fetched
---
There's a sub reddit that can not be named which has a trade karma rating.  Modding is considered as a service in the marketplace.   If you find someone with 100+ then you're usually safe.
---
No disrespect meant to the kind people in this post who offered their services.  I've just seen so many people burned...
---
I'd play it more if there were more things to do. Lifting caps won't change that. All it'd do is not feel so bad playing when I do play.
---
They do say demeaning stuff sometimes, but some of the settlers also throw shade at times as well.
---
I kill either side when they pull that stuff. I'm an equal opportunity murderer.
---

How does having higher intelligence boast your experience?
---
I keep a "You're the dumbass" note at 30k on my vendor because, even if I sell the rest of my items, my camp will still work as a fast travel point for whoever needs it.
---
Okay that helps a bit but doesn't really solve the problem I still have to earn something like 5k plus bullion just for a slightly better set of power armor. I can play one day a week meaning I can get 500 a week if I also get the 6k caps. So it would take me 10 weeks to get that.
---
The discounted price seems like it should be the base price on that one.
---
Same
---
Ridden by Assaultron Dominators...... Wearing cloaks....
---
Don't wait. Hit them up every couple of days and keep doing so consistently until they respond. If they don't respond for a while, post all your attempts to communicate to reddits, official forums and their official social media account until you do get a response.
---
I think it sells too well, so they probably will be stingy with the discounts.
---
Now I can’t name myself after a serial killer and stalk someone, what’s even the point of playing.
---
You get 300 from Smiley in the Wayward for 6000 caps a week.
---
PSA if you do all of a companions questline and romance/flirt with them all the way through, after the questline is done and you sleep in your camp with your companion in camp, you get a lovers embrace bonus of 5% xp for 3 hours
---
But without the panicked sweat of FOMO on your brow as you browse the shop, you might accidentally notice that modders had made several times more content that was much better 2 years into Fallout 4's release and given it away for free.
---
Who cares. Why would you let something like that bother you.
---
I think the entire idea is to make it easier for them to ban and block if they so choose.
---
I recently got it for the first time and it's been very QoL. I *was* disappointed in a couple things with it, but the good outweighs the bad. 
---
For example, I thought I could jump off Seneca and do a little boost before landing for no fall damage. I also didn't think I could die from covering a massive horizontal distance going down hill (never dropped a large distance vertically but I guess it took the total distance into account). And lastly, thought having high stamina would mean boosting for longer but turns out it's % AP consumed.
---
I’m with you! This is way too easy to do by accident. I use controller on PC.
---
Definitely- or rather the wearer is constantly followed by a Wendigo....
---
Why not both?
---
Been happening to me for a while with my double barrel.
---
Edit: ok that's some funky text mine didn't look like that...
---
They could double the daily gold cap and still keep their time gate to around a year of daily play to get everything, the current limit just shows they dont wanna add new stuff or pay attention to their new currency system
---
Out of curiosity, what rifle are you using to solo the SBQ as a rifleman?
---
Could be. Admittedly never tried with Armourer because it didn't effect SS. Just assumed it wouldn't V94 either. Have to check when I get home, I guess.
---
I'm trying to fit both on my build but I like my quality of life perks too much hahahaha
---
I think that means they enjoy playing it.
---
where could we and how could we meet to mod my radium rifle?
---
We need a big scruffy nerfherder beard more tho

Bloody fixer when she’s on the ground and bloody lever gun in the air.  Hardened receivers on both.
---
Then you need to contact Steam. That is a different wallet.
---
Same here. Couldn’t loot his body.
---
Love it!!!!!!!!!
---
100% agree. I’ve played some level of Rifleman since the original Fallout. I was sad to feel obligated to make the switch, but Bethesda chose not show much love for the class and it sucks being 200+ and still struggling with the game. Night and day difference after switching to Commando as a Junkie’s build.
---
Mixed additive and multiplicative seems like an oversight since the change to additive for almost everything else was to make it easier to balance. I also find it odd more people aren't talking about Take on for the Team card more.
---
Lone Wanderer? Not sure if it's worth it but I use it. And I always forget to switch to other charisma perks when I join a group, lol.
---
Oh. Well sorry that someone pointed out your own personal loot source in an online game. I am sure every single player will respect your claimed property and never ever come close to the house at all.
---
Have someone share scrapper with you on a new character in a team
---
Just give people bloody chat already
---
Gotta draw the line somewhere.....
---
Love mine
---
I heard they’re coming for ammo factories. Looks like the population of the wasteland is going to be reduced by about 75% 😱
---
An all black secret service underarmor would be so nice! Hope they release it soon
---
I have both good and bad news for you.
---
Firstly the diverse build that you ask for will arrive with legendary perks and they are coming to the game fairly soon.
---
Secondly you have wasted all your perk points by switching your specs around and you need those to buy the new perks, and Bethesda didn't tell us and doesn't care.
---
I just got the jetpack blueprint and the red rocket jetpack worked so I think It seems the jetpack blueprint is required
---
If its a magic shotgun you don't need any shotgun perks.
---
I mean, that much is obvious. and of course it's working, I don't think anyone is questioning that.
---
but it's still undeniably scummy and total bs.
---
Fireproof sometimes doesn't work. It seems occured by laggy server.
---
Daily ops are a new game mode coming where stealth doesn’t work. Pistols are tricker than older fallout games cause so many perks are in the agility tree. But there are good pistols. That said the three best builds these days are commando, heavy gunner and melee, although melee is getting a sever debuff soon
---
I dont like the red on the BRC outfit. WV drifter + assault gask mask looks better imo
---
This is the only Atlas thing I cared about.  I donated like 20k leather just to make sure.  Here’s hoping for a couple good rolls out of 5k scrip.
---
The excavator armor really ain’t bad and is grind free, if you aren’t enjoying that grind, start doing a caps grind for serums so you can maintain your mutations, it’s honesty pretty rewarding to get enhancements that make gameplay more fun rather than just buff stats
---
haha Beth missles go brr
---
I don't want to assume it's obvious. Much like I wouldn't want to assume someone smoking knows they'll get lung cancer. Still want to spread the education.
---
I used it in nuclear winter and it surprised me how great it was. I killed 3 people when I normally just hide in bushes till the end. Granted I had perks for explosives because I figured, if I'm gonna have to play nuclear winter I might as well try to annoy other players as much as possible since I'm not that good at it.
---
This!!
---
I accept your apology
---
I had read the slots were opening up by milestone (lvl 50, 100, 150, etc) and the cards were ranked up by scrapping perk cards.
---
Do you mean the cards themselves will be bought with level up points? How does that even work? Either way, I haven't moved anything yet and have around 10 levels saved up with much more before I end up pulling the trigger on a respec.
---
I’m not sure it’s an oversight. The perk applies at a different stage of the damage calculation.
---
So tonight I was on and with everything I use on my bloodied fixer the highest damage headshot I got was 3300 I recorded it on Xbox if you would like to see it ask for gt.
---
Oh at least lower their weight
---
https://roguetrader.com
---
Already rocking both x-01 and ultracite power armour I just want the t-65 and as well.
---
That's the problem. We don't \*need\* each other, in the sense that we can all by and large operate in autarky for our daily needs. We can pretend that we do, and that's what a lot of roleplaying is, but it's what I consider "soft" roleplaying. It does not grow of the needs of players and instead is false and backwards.
---
They’re really going to have to rebalance a lot of stuff.  I hope they don’t just ignore the fact that half the weapons in the game are now pretty useless.
---
Junkies explosive automatic railroad rifle and spamming vats to smear your target.
---
Yep, a Bloodied/-90%RW is fun to carry around and shoot off ammo you find or rewarded from events.
---
Not working for Charlie either
---
I suppose. but at this point I should assume it's common knowledge.
---
I mean, we're all aware that we're inside a skinner box. one that's been optimized for profit, and not necessarily our enjoyment.
---
personally I'd like to think that the majority of the playerbase isn't stupid, and that we're still here in spite of their disingenuous tactics. not because of it.
---
Weird. I was able to read all of my message in English. Yours appears to be REDACTED.
---
Agreed.  It’s much too valuable.
---
Actually not everyone curses.  I have a best friend who has not since he was 18.  He turned 45 this year.
---
I 150% agree with you on the rest.
---
I have almost every mutation, I have agility maxed out luck is at 11 I believe, intelligence is at 3 for nerd rage, charisma is 1 for strange in numbers, perception is 14 strength is 8 or 9. So if you don’t think I can hit a 2k headshot with my bloodied fixer then just ask instead of acting like I was lying or acting like I was getting heated about it. Thanks
---
ave, true to Caesar
---
Exactly. Very rarely does anyone ask why, more so just that time gates completely blow.
---
People wouldn’t take issue with the atomshop IF THE GAME WASNT BROKEN 101 different ways. All the investment into stupid hats and goofy bullshit and the mainquest Is still broken!
---
Could the rockfall be to prevent slackers lurking above the arena just popping down after Earl dies?
---
Yeah I mean I would have bought them given the option just for completion sake. This really baffles me. At the end of the day I am not going to lose sleep over this but I would think they would want people to be able to buy out of this season until the next one begins.
---
If you’re into farming legendaries, you haven’t missed much. Queen and Earle and other bosses still drop one star wood and garbage melee most of times. Watoga legendary bots completely nerfed to zero. Whitespring ghouls reduced to bare minimum sometimes zero. The only positive part is after doing wastelander quests and farmed enough reps, you can buy plans and try to roll your own legendaries, including a few gauss weapons and secret service armors. I’ve been trying to roll an unyielding left arm, thousands of scrips later got a one star, I’m feeling pretty lucky.
---
This is why we can’t have nice things
---
Yeah.. its obvious the strategies they use. Strip away the "repeatable" aspect of 76 and its still an enjoyable game at its core. The community being the biggest influence.
---
Server hopping will yield better results.
---
Put in a support ticket.  There is always a chance they may be able to do something for you.  I've had good experience with support.
---
Its so crazy that the atomic shop is the only thing you can count on for any type of new content in this game and yet its just bad...like there's probably 5000 atoms worth of stuff id buy if i could but its not even in the shop. Its like they've never seen a good and effective mtx shop.
---
And be aware, just like Season 1,you can play every day and still fail thanks to the auto complete bug!
---
Why would I apologize to you for being a cunt?
---
I agree, but there would still be people “only a week?! I was out of town for a week wtf Bethesda”
---
Thanks for the heads up. I keep trying but no luck yet. And every time I see someone posting they have him I’m not online lol.
---
It's not 5k. The sale goes on for 4 days. It's closer to 8k scrip.
---
Good luck either way!
---
I play it near religiously every day. I understand what I'm doing and understand why the time gates exist. I don't mind and chalk it up to being part of the business. I'm level 500 with a number of alts all above 50 so by all means this isn't bashing 76. But I'm completely aware on the why part of how it's set up
---
Scrap a perk, get 2 perk coins. Gather enough perk coins, you can rank up a legendary perk, starting with 50 coins for a Rank 2 card.
---
Respec'd in the past? Each point you respecced is worth 2 perk coins. Those are gone for you, permanently.
---
In the end the main reason the two factions don't get along is because the raiders refuse to, so I sided with the settlers. 
---
Otherwise Appalachia could literally be a post apocalyptic paradise. If the settlers and raiders teamed up they could easily wipe out the other smaller problematic factions (like blood eagles, cultists, maybe even the scorched) and live in a more stable society. 
---
But the Raiders don't want to, so they keep living in their own filth. They literally live in a hole! Calling it a "Crater" doesn't change the fact that it's just a radioactive hole. Some of the supermutant bases are fancier. 
---
I mean let's face it, they're essentially throwing a massive temper tantrum about being here previously and now that they're back other people are here and they don't want to share and wah wah get over yourselves.  
---
Tl;dr - Foundation would have happily co-existed with the raiders. It's the raiders that refuse to play nice so I'll side with the faction trying to fix the wasteland instead of the one with an unearned sense of entitlement.
---
I know why I play video games, son
---
Why don’t you tag the ISS and take all 3 pylons?
---
I did not get it either. Was traveling with my family for holiday. Thanks Bethesda....
---
I'm a vats stealth rifleman build and I'm switching to commando with one wasteland. I primed my lever action and sniper rifle a year ago, but it's just not going to cut it in the future. 
---
I already have to switch out for certain events because either the stealth doesn't work all the time or the slow firing speed doesn't justify the damage they put out.
---
Thanks for the laugh.
---
Okay that was alot of big brain moment right there and yes it is helpful thank you
---
You should always apologize when you act that way
---
Empath too for the very same reason, you're in the team anyway!
---
A second gun. Or a third. Or those repair kits you have. If there’s a better way I’m as interested as you, but guns are gonna break when you use a thousand bullets. Much easier to be a heavy gunner with “magic” effect weapons.
---
I don't think stupid and undereducated is the same thing. Having information not available is the true tragedy. I'm undereducated in a lot of areas and welcome a bit of knowledge thrown at me. I'm hoping this post does that for some people and eases their mind.
---
Damnnnnnn.
---
I make it a point to buy 5 steel every time I launch the game. I often log out next to the purveyor just to remember. Literally nothing else to spend scrip on, even with this sale I have no reason to waste a thorn armor roll on yet another random weapon I'll never use
---
Hmm I don't use gunsmith either and don't have this problem, could be the mods u have for it definitely put on a forceful stock, could also depend on what percentage your repairing it to.
---
charlie and bravo are bunk havent tried alpha
---
I mean this isn't even what you would call a feature. Just a basic function of this type of game that anyone who played more 10 minutes would have noticed a lack of.
---
150 a day on five characters during the sale, assuming you can hit the game on Monday morning.  I always forget to add that in.  Good catch.
---
Actually it is in game. I got mine just after patch 21 dropped. Was doing dailies in the cranberry bog and got it from a mitelurk queen. Seems to be a very rare drop.
---
It seems obvious when you say it, but that never even occurred to me. Thanks!
---
The main menu that shows up when you first launch the game.
---
Not working either
---
Ah I see, so it's just another source of perk coins. That's fine, I'm only 160 so it's not like I'll be jonesing to fill out a whole set of legendary perks on day one.
---
that'd be good too but people still wouldn't use them much
---
Lost Home south of watoga has yielded the best results for me. I find her about 1 in 10. Is there a particular outfit you are looking for?
---
I filled 4 all unique. The perk does wonders
---
So...... I was just saying your username was interesting. No need to blow up...
---
I know it would be asking a lot but I'd think they would allow for filters etc
---
Follow the money is always the answer. These are professionals. They know what they are doing and there's absolutely nothing wrong with it. But it's best to know how it plays upon our psyche and why we feel frustrated.
---
Assultron, leaning over a log "Beginning sniff protocols!"
---
Thank you!!
---
Game mechanics.
---
I solo the Queen or Earle up to 2 -3 times before my gun breaks and i only carry one gun at a time too (BFFR or BE Fixer) I only have 8 points in intelligence as well running nerd rage of course and i swap full gunsmith and full demo expert depending on which gun im using
---
Ended today.
---
We definitely need each other at least on paper you can’t claim it’s all just pretend role playing.
---
The way the legendary system inherently works necessitates some form of player trading to deal with the extremely low drop rates in certain items. 
---
Trading arguably a big part of end game requires two to tango
---
People aren’t pretending to look for *that gun* they are actually looking for that gun.
---
A lot of events need multiple people. 
---
Do you solo every single event? There’s some I can and I don’t and there’s some I just can’t. 
---
Most people cannot and need other players help. 
---
So you can say we don’t need each other for the quests and I’ll give you that  -but  - so much of the rest of the game does require players to come in contact with each other. 
---
Could it be better / more involved - yes for sure
---
Just quit the game from the main menu when you’re inside the game. Then switch to the battle royale mode if you don’t have the fallout 1st mode. Once the mode loads, exit the game and go back to the main menu and start up the original game mode. Make sure to analyze the blood sample first before you insert the fuse. It worked first try on my Xbox
---
May as well check for other goodies while there
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i6sj3o/here_is_why_lost_home_is_the_bomb_yo/
---
Why is it scummy. Any longer term game needs to think about how players behave in order to keep them hooked in. Too stingy with the rewards and people get annoyed and leave. To generous and why bother, people leave. Yes gameplay matters but look at the posts here, people want their rewards. So obviously some thought has to go into how they are given out to make sure they aren’t too stingy or generous
---
Yeah, because Bethesda doesn't have any control over grind in the game and it's not like they place items that people really want at the end. I love that instead of adding more to do in the game, it simply tries to find more ways for you to grind with features that already exist.   
---
Entire game is designed around manipulating you into grinding, meanwhile the game lacks essential features.
---
It’s just a placeholder. I was Level 96 and couldn’t finish today and I’m sad haha.
---
I run 6 INT. 3 for Nerd Rage and 3 for Gunsmith (I also have a 5* Gunsmith, which I swap in for crafting and modifying).
---
If you’re able to do so, repair your weapon before a big fight with 3* Weapon Artisan for 200% weapon health.
---
I also recommend running with a forceful stock. It decreases AP cost as much as an aligned stock, and forceful also considerably increases weapon health.
---
So Apex Legends, the game that imo completely revolutionized both its genre and gaming as whole, has the best non voice chat based communication I've ever seen. Theres no way bethedsa could do what those devs did and certainly not the engine but damn just imagine
---
The bug can hit you at any time after the reset, not just at the reset! Any crash on loading a server can auto complete your challenges!
---
Sorry friend. The run is done. Don't fret. There's still fun to be had yet. You have season 2 to look forward too.
---
Alpha? I just burned two cards
---
Charlie isn't working either. I swear the universe does NOT want me to launch a nuke and finish this quest.
---
ZeniMax Media Inc.’s team of lawyers does not care about Fallout lore
---
It’s not, do you have the Chinese stealth armor? That helped me complete it when I soloed
---
He's just being a needlessly pedantic nerd. 
---
  
---
##"no no u cant say this nickname! NO NICKNAMES omg it propagates a bad understanding of video game mechanics ! nicknames r bad !"
---
 
---
what a pedantic nerd.
---
Ugh I wish so many of the hats didn't make the female toons appear bald :(
---
When I’m at my bench I repair to 200% but the condition bar is really small to begin with. I’ll check out the stock. I currently have a stab stock on it bc i hate recoil.
---
But frank, we've been friends for years
---
it's absolutely 100% possible. 
---
Also. You took a shortcut and it didn't do what it was supposed to do. That is not the games fault.
---
Used new code on Bravo and no go. Will try old code now
---
Edit..
---
Old code worked in bravo
---
Or maybe they could just add the ability to chat
---
What...🤯 thank you for the wealth of knowledge
---
I'd say there's a little wrong with it. If it weren't for the name fallout, this game probably wouldn't have made it this far along. They know it, and (at times) seem to take advantage of the fans loyalty.
---
Quit the main game and go to the main menu, start up a new battle royale mode or fallout 1st. Wait until it loads up, then quit the game mode once the game loads. Go back to the main menu and start up the original game, and it should work, the doors should all be closed like if it’s your first time entering the building. Also analyze the blood sample first before you change the fuse. It worked first try on my Xbox. If it doesn’t work first try, keep trying.
---
Okay then that seems fine. I'm just a little wary of mixed additive and multiplicative multipliers in a game because it caused a lot of issues for the devs and players of The Division.
---
and why in this day and age are they still gender segregated?
---
I am completely aware of that. But technically speaking they are like youtube where they cannot control what others say and do on an online platform.
---
What silo are you in right now? I have a nuke keycard, just make sure you put in the right code and I’ll help you. You do know what the code is, don’t you?
---
guess what?
---
First check and i have her. 
---
BUT i am going to beds in 5 minutes. GT?
---
It’s Thursday.
---
Not nearly as sad as shitting on someone for enjoying a game mode that you apparently don't.
---
Newsflash: some people actually enjoy NW.  Sorry if that shatters your sense of self.
---
this will get you started: https://www.usgamer.net/articles/fallout-76-how-to-complete-the-order-of-the-tadpole-quest-and-become-a-pioneer-scout
---
Im 90% sure its ur mods then, my durability bar is quite big.
---
thank you!
---
Great advice.  I didn't start looking at the daily challenges until a few weeks ago and still made it to level 90 just doing my daily grind during the day when work from home was slow.

&gt; **LEGENDARY VENDOR 50% OFF SUPER SALE (SEPTEMBER 10 - SEPTEMBER 14)**
---
It's on bethesda events site. I think it's this weekend
---
Do you seriously think that the same people working on atom shop assets are the same people who would otherwise debug the rest oft he game?  That's not how peoples jobs work.  They don't come in in the morning and decide if today they're going to work on modeling a new outfit or figuring out why fast traveling doesn't work properly.  Unless you're seriously suggesting they should alternate between hiring and laying off their staff so they're "investing" in the parts of game development you think should be prioritized at any given time.
---
Based on the number of times this question has been asked on this sub today I’m gonna go with no, it seems not
---
Apparently I do not know the code but yeah I'm sitting in alpha
---
Nice. Is it for 4 days?
---
The way they handled that and the red scare paints was really annoying. Asking for full freight on basic repaints.
---
Yes.
---
I use weapon artisan when I'm repairing at a workbench to get 200% condition and use the forcefull stock, this lets me do just under 3 Earle's before it breaks.
---
I couldn't log in all weekend.  Missed the BoS Collectron. So pissed.
---
I soloed it just got the wrong code
---
Last weeks code worked for me in alpha
---
are you using the forceful stock? I don't have gunsmith and my handmade ends the fight at around 50% health or more from 200%.
---
didnt even know this was a site thank you kindly!
---
I'm guilty of the fan loyalty part. I can begin to tell you the money I've spent in merch and game stuff. I don't drink/party/smoke and pay all my bills/save/no debt; this is "my thing". But surely there's a lot I tolerate simply because of the brand.
---
Only if the only thing you equate to content is cosmetics.
---
Okay send me a friend request and I’ll hop on your server. PSN is x\_Hardcase\_x
---
Bonus points for a Mr. Fuzzy hardhat.
---
I never said it was impossible i just did it solo and got a bogus code. Fair enough though on the doing it wrong.
---
Or maybe they could just make text chat a thing. That'd be cool.
---
Yeah I'm more into building my character and using certain weapons/armours to compliment my play style. Usually BoS armour or power armour with a jetpack (which I've only managed to build once, it took a long time to gather the materials and plans etc)
---
no
---
Gatling gun no gatling laser yes
---
Impressed if on console, not if on pc. Hacks and all. You sound like a dick.
---
Same in Charlie.  New code was a nogo....old code worked.  🤷🏼‍♂️
---
I’m being generous and not just saying playable content as that is literally just two things this whole year.
---
Its nearly impossible cause of the codes
---
Oh shit. I hope they don't have a grudge against Trevor Phillips....
---
If I had 8 points in intel it’d be a different story. Then I could run both perks, but I only have 5 and I can’t see a way to pull from any other special categories without impacting the build. My strength is only 1, perception 15, endurance 2, charisma 6 (tenderizer 3 and bodyguards 3), intel 5, agility 15, and luck 13. Maybe I should pull from luck and do without the crit perks? I only use crits on the megabosses and it doesn’t feel like it makes a significant difference.
---
I’m just as disappointed with my module rolls lol
---
More of fallout76s budget is allocated on the atomshop than anything else, thats the point and the problem.
---
Thats a lot of time for one person
---
You are misunderstanding, and still mention things which don't affect damage with the Fixer (like high agility).
---
If you were so kind to tell me which enemy you tested, distance, mods on the weapon.
---
I have the mutations which might affect damage, multipliers, etc. I really want to try your build to get those numbers. I am not saying that you are lying: I just can't get to do the math to cause 3K per hit with a Fixer. And I have been playing since release, all builds, all godrolls. All sets of armor: nowadays I have fun trying new things or giving away free items which people are willing to buy for 30K.
---
What are its effects? Are you using critical perks? Mods? Which perks on Perception? I have a Bloodied Explosive Fixer I don't use because my Bloodied lever does better damage. If your build helps me change that, then, awesome. 
---
Thanks in advance.
---
And if they ask and you cant/don't want to just say sorry you are unavailable. Dickishness in this game is exceedingly rare.
---
So, Beth's fault, if course. Nukacrypt is still (technically) always right.
---
My main concern with all of these companies doing this is that anything you say or do whether right or not could be construed as a banable offense. Like I said in the original post there are some people who are 100% there just to be dicks and everybody is more than happy when they get banned. Then there are some people who aren’t trying to offend anyone and they get banned because somebody doesn’t like their name. You see what I am saying?
---
There are some people in our group called PKOA that are on XBOX that could probably help you if ever need help with something.  Im on ps4 but if you want you can check us out on our sub reddit and find people.
---
Technically its the first from a chronological perspective if you ignore the intro to 4
---
Well, we do have a warehouse building set, so you might be onto something:)
---
Right with ya buddy. Speaking of merch, If you havent already, you should try the board game out. 👍
---
Where did you get Your code from?
---
I learned my lesson in Primal Cuts- no stealth available and semi auto trying to down two or three Yao Gaui or Fog Crawlers in full Danger.
---
If daily ops are like this, outside of overland content stealth rifleman isn't gonna be 100% viable. Still good however, but yeah for me and my style the writing is on the wall for my stealth build.
---
https://roguetrader.com/
---
I’ll look into it. Thanks!
---
are you really asking that? considering there are several studies on how to manipulate your playerbase? I don't know about you, but I don't like being played for a fool.
---
not to mention a lot of people play Fo76 solo, in a single player fashion. a lot of people never asked for it to be a service, or a long term thing. Fo4 did just fine without the mobile-esque shenanigans.
---
but of course if they allowed even private servers, actual local instances instead of their subscription bs, their profit model would take a hit. and we can't have players enjoying themselves, think of the money.
---
Yeah, but where this calculation happens still isn't really that clear to players.  It will say the same "+10%" (or whatever it is) value as anything else does, but as it turns out, many of those other things aren't really 10% anymore.
---
That is until it breaks due to Bethesda’s genius idea of durability being calculated per damaged entity
---
Alright thanks
---
I have the 1-4 player RPG board game... Got it on sale but have yet to play it. I have two curious children who surely would... Change the course of gameplay to put it lightly 😂.
---
Thanks for the info
---
Initial Public Offering?
---
I’m newer to the game. Can you elaborate? I’ve never seen it explained in SPECIAL or anything that you get higher experience with intelligence. If it’s there and I never saw it I’m going to feel like a real dumbass.
---
No problem
---
Nukacrypt, it seems legit. I assume it was an error on my part
---
No official... do you seriously think if the development team is going to do anything they'd prioritize or even ever bother with posting about it in someones fucking forum thread?  If they're going to do something about it that procedure doesn't require patting you on the back.
---
Im pretty sure ive fast traveled to camps that didn't have a vendor. Maybe it was a team mate camp or something.
---
Plus the point that I'm trying to make isn't that I don't want to grind it's that I can't grind every day.
---
What does it say about suicide? Do we need to remove Lou from the game? Hell, [I even took a picture of myself using one of his suicide setups.](https://i.gyazo.com/35ce4eb3e0fa81f26fbafdbd35c9a5ff.jpg) That's as close as it gets to my character portraying suicide.
---
But I’ll almost bet you that sooner or later that fireplace door or whatever else will come around in the atomic shop
---
Agreeeeeeeeeeeeed. Should be permanently in the shop for new and returning players. 
---
It’s so sad to tell people hey that no mic is here! For only one week! 
---
That’s not exciting to return and it comes off lame af
---
My guess is there is a bos bundle that will cost 900 atoms or something, not saying it’s fair, saying it’s beth
---
Cows? There are cows? Do they drop legendaries? I will log in every day until I know thruth.....
---
awat?
---
I have a full set of Marine armor, dense on the chest, unyielding and Ultralight anywhere else. The whole thing weighs maybe 12 pounds.
---
It's been a mechanic in every fallout game that more intelligence gives more experience, and in this game through legendary armor and buffs you can really push intelligence up to quite silly numbers!

So the first video I have on Xbox is a mole miner after adrenaline hits after 2 kills it was 2000 about 3 feet away. The 3k was a scorched about 50 feet away but adrenaline was hitting. I make sure I put mister sandman on then covert operative to hit 3.75 sneak attacks. I have to change it every time I log on being it switches back for some reason. So I’m always hitting sneak attacks for that damage. I have both a regular bloodied fixer with prefixes 250 damage resistance while reloading and 50 more critical damage and I hve a bloodied explosive fixer with +1 perception.  Are you on Xbox or where can I send you a picture of everything so I don’t have to write it all. It would be easier
---
So you’re angry with Beth for using the methodology of an online long term game on a game they have always said is a long term online game? I’m by no stretch of the imagination a capitalist but even I can’t really fault them for (mostly) doing what they have always said they were gonna do and use the tools of game design to design a game.
---
If you’d rather play offline, Fallout 4 is still there and you can mod it to an incredible extent these days for gratis
---
i'm still salty about that
---
&gt; But I have seen the mats on the build menu and I've seen many people on this subreddit talk about how they were disabled due to griefing
---
The mats have been there the whole time. They have never, at any point, changed spawning behavior in this game. There was lots of confusion and assumptions that they would toward the beginning of the game, including from myself. 
---
I remember being mad that my welcome mat was broken at launch and didn't control where my spawn point was. There were several reddit posts asking devs to fix the welcome mats and the devs told us that they weren't broken since they weren't intended to change spawn points.
---
Its a limited event, so its a limited reward?
---
A BOS *WHAT*
---
Mine was legible, nothing out of the ordinary
---
I just posted about this and how it relates to other time gated stuff in game.

May not be an answer we like but it's the model they likely use.
---
I had no problems until i had to accept the new terms about 45 mins ago
---
Yeah I hear ya, it should be weekly but a lot of players would only play 1-2 days a week then.
---
That said with the new legendary runs I think they could relax daily limits and move them to weekly and not lose too much in dau
---
It's 20 years into the 21st Century.  No MULTI PLAYER game should ever be released without a fucking Text Chat function....
---
Nice, I have a Anti Armor Explosive 2* I can dust off now.
---
Gatling gun no gatling plasma yes
---
Go for it and best of luck. I personally love auto 10mm, especially with FFR. The damage nerf is coming soon, which will definitely hurt gunslinger and guerrilla builds. On the plus side, pistol builds will be able to utilize Tank Killer soon, which might end up making them better than they are now.
---
Okay, this game is really getting carried away with the [FOMO tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out).   I mean, I can tolerate it to a certain degree.  But Bethesda is really be going overboard with this.   It's ridiculous that you had to go into the Atomic shop menu to claim it.  Even more ridiculous that it was there for such a limited time. 
---
 It really should just be an item that everyone can build without having to jump through that extra hoop.
---
its a great surprise - wait, did I shoot that mole miner? huh, this one, too? no way, I know I didn't shoot this one. OHHHH!
---
I also can't craft the cosmos jetpack to think I might need the plan ae

It takes some patience and constant rule checking, but it's super fun. Be ready for multiple hours the first go at it. I hope you enjoy it. 😊

I think you're on to something here.
---
You are looking for the king of them all..goes.by the name of Chally. Legend has it he doesn't eat meat.

I really can not wait! I need some caution tape around my tiny section of my living room for this.
---
I couldn't tell you the weirdest, maybe the old whitespring bot multiplication, but glowing behemoth would be a cool new trophy plan
---
Just because they weaponized FOMO to hell and back for revenue and it’s ‘legally ok’ doesn’t mean we have to like it
---
That and the “Why won’t you talk to me, so I’ll shoot you until you do” guy. Seriously, wtf is wrong with some people.
---
From Thursday night until this morning I could get to the main menu. But it wouldn't show the options for the atom shop or the legendary run and i couldn't click the options that WERE shown.
---
Until the changes are made!
---
Just jumping does the trick...
---
 98469385 worked for Charlie.
---
I don't think that is an intended effect. I am guessing that it   won't stay that way.  I'm going to buy ammo factory and hold off on the rest of them.  Ammo factory looks like a great perk that works and is unlikely to be changed.
---
No.

Tell me about it

Have a feeling we will wait a bit for it all to drip out sadly.

People use it to grief. I guess you can call me a grief dealer
---
I am on PS4, but thanks. Will try with full adrenaline and sandman tomorrow. I think I have enough free levels to max agility and lower strength as necessary.
---
Yeah currently it just says Play and Settings.
---
Edit: im also currently reinstalling. So 8 hrs later...
---
it is a bit odd in light of the lore. Wasn't there a serial rapist in New Vegas? Also what if your friend is a serial killer, or family member, I assume they only mean the ones who have been caught.
---
Like Skinners rat we get subjected to random aversive shock treatment; crashes, loss of gear, hackers and bugs which leads to a reduction in response.
---
Still interested?
---
I always ran lone wanderer until I read on here that even if you are in a public group the group perks work. I drank a herd mentality and dropped lone wanderer and added inspirational. Also be sure to share a card.
---
I play a lot anyway

I didn't have to reinstall,  it was fixed when I woke up this morning.

See I had ask strength so I could carry more and I’ve played since beta but started using guns and everything about four months ago and switched my whole build around awesome now

OwO Crop dust :3
---
Just tried ALPHA and the codes we found on Nukacrypt and RougeTrader aren't working either.
---
In fact Caesar was widely considered a tyrant, especially by some roman senators. He was a key character in New Vegas
---
Oh shut up before I start pressuring you for more supplies again.

---
I've tested the more players thing myself, both with Earle and the SBQ, they both take a lot less damage when not only multiple people shooting them, but multiple people being in the area.
---
I can Solo Earle in 6 minutes in my commando. As soon as another player takes part it mysteriously takes longer and a heck of a lot more ammo.
---
My commando, Heavy gunner and unarmed melee characters deal more damage solo than in a group of any size.
---
It's about time. The hey you got mic bro comments are at an end. Mostly.
---
It’s not like there is no other revenue streams for the game. 
---
They literally have a subscription now for the game so they could lay off the atom shop gas a bit and improve pricing sooner then later. 
---
That’s guaranteed MRR.  in some cases paid 100% up front.
---
Well i have to go to bed in a minute. I will have my wife check while im at work. This used to happen when i first got the game. The weirdest part was the all 1 Specials
---
there are several issues at play here. games like WoW for example need to be online, they were designed around that aspect. Fo76 doesn't, there's 0 reason why it can't be played offline. a lot of people do, in fact, play it in a singleplayer fashion, coop at best. and those same people would have no problem if the game was indeed offline or hosted locally, they never wanted it to be a mmo-light in the first place. Bethesda designed Fo76 to be service first and foremost, and forgot to actually add in the game. there are mobile gachas that don't ask as much time from their players as Fo76 does. and the list goes on and on.
---
not to mention that the problem is the methodology itself. yeah, I'm angry at Bethesda for using a disingenuous methodology to retain players. you can have a long term game (with the reservations above in mind) without Fing over your playerbase.
---
For ESO On console text chat was added it way later
---
It was voice chat only mmorpg
---
I guess I just don’t see how forcing everyone to login for 7-10 hours a week spread over 7 days vs 7-10 hours a week spread over 2-3 days, benefits Bethesda?
---
I keep seeing this argument.   It doesn’t make any sense to me
---
I run strength 2 (bandolier 2), perception 15 (tank killer 3, all 3 commandos max, concentrated fire 3), Endurance 1 (adamantium skeleton 1), charisma 4 (strange numbers, tenderizer 3), intelligence 8 (nerd rage, gunsmith 5), agility 15 (sneak 3, covert op 3, sandman 2, gun fu 1, escape artist 1, adrenaline 5), luck 11 (bloody mess 3, better crit 3, starched genes 2, crit savvy 3)
---
Build works great for me, i also run aligned attachments for ap cost cause my durability doesn't bother me too bad but I recommend you just play with it a little, maybe take a few notes from this chat and try some new things and figure out what works best for you my friend
---
Exactly. Its good to come to the table with knowing why before asking 'why' if that makes any damn sense.
---
Well yeah, serial rapist in new vegas, pickman who was a serial killer in fo4, and hell even the sickle man in 76. I am sure 3 had something as well. It was just very vaguely written and could screw some people.
---
Well said tbh
---
Best of luck. I always have to leave for work right before they change the stuff in the shop, and don't get home until almost 2am eastern.
---
Wow, would you like to share the power point from the shareholders meeting with everyone else?
---
Perhaps that’s it.. given the colors are slightly different from the bog standard CR
---
What you talking about it be extremely useful on console 
---
Usb keyboard work on console and multiple online game use text chat
---
Explosive weapons were very op at the start. A lvl 10 tse was better then a lvl 50 bloodied. So they nerfed the two shot and the explosive due to a lot of outcry from players from the non pvp side. Add in the dupes, everyone and their brother had a end game gun before lvl 25 that could oneshot any enemy in the game with the exception of the queen.
---
We all know that. September 10th (always on a Thursday) at 11 am eastern (always at the daily reset).
---
Its obvious, but a screeching fanboy wouldn’t take notice.
---
I think running only works in first person
---
It’s on the wording of the card. Most say increase damage by x%. They all add up now. But some say increase enemy damage taken. Those factor in at a different part of the calculation and the effect is multiplicative.
---
Someone said that Charlie and Alpha were swapped, BUT we tried the Charlie codes in Alpha just now and nothing....  Nukacrypt and roguetrader have different codes.
---
Fixers. I like to see low-levels earnestly getting about their quests near my base at Top of the World. If they’re not to quick to move in, I’ll craft one around their level and drop it for them. And yes, I realise most of them are probably mule characters.
---
Cool, thanks for the feedback 🤙
---
Some people paid for a whole year up-front. 
---
A lot of expectations stem from that and the slow drip of new content or desired functionality.
---
I think it prevents people from jetpacking away and makes you use the "right" way of escape.
---
If it stayed open, I would just double-jump it and walk away.
---
As a woman, I have been harassed more by griefers and perverts when they can hear my voice vs text chat.
---
Fuck atoms is useless reward when we can simple buy them lol
---
I rather have perk coin reward
---
That sucks. Im sorry.
---
Add to that the barn stars we all wanted back at the start too.

Do I winz the internetz&gt;?
---
 It is nice to have a way to show we can't communicate.  However I feel they will think that those of us who can't use voice chat for whatever reason will now be ok with an emote instead of a proper chat system.  Kind of feels like they are trying to shut us up.
---
Except if you give everyone a camo jumpsuit and a full set of unyielding ss armor and a be fixer at level 50 and tell people to go shoot shit for no reward people will drop the game. Because psychology. 
---
Look this clearly isn’t the game for you. And Beth are working on Starfield and ES6. But they take time. Maybe Fallout 4 Capital Waste mod comes out this year and you can play that instead? 🤷‍♀️
---
Wow, I read RIM-WORLD and I thought....
---
Nevemind, yeah that would be cool....
---
What drives me beyond crazy is the game asks you how many notes you want to trade, but 20 is the max. Why don't they set it at 20? 
---
A part of me believe it was supposed to be 1:1 and they made some changes.
---
Come again?
---
Won't be able to do that the same with one wasteland.  Plus I did do that, and while it was quicker, it wasn't like 2 min, more like 10-15 rather than 30.    
---
Pair that with the fact that you frequently have both  complete more than 1 event and claim a workshop, each taking 10 min if you are lucky 30 min is usually the fastest you get these done, and the average was closer to 45.
---
I sell most plans for 15-0 caps unless they’re especially rare
---
Haha, I'm excited for you! 🤣 Make sure you're using different voices for the characters when you read the dialog.
---
not necessarily. I've had those things for about 150 levels now. and here I am still. and trust me when I say it's not the bullion or score grind that's keeping me around, if anything they're the things sucking the fun out of the game for me.
---
and again, Fo4 did fine without any of this bs. curious.
---
I'm good. I refuse to work mornings lol. I only work nights.
---
Exactly. It’s like the ammo converter. Like no one asked to do their ammo like that. We all just wanted to scrap our ammo to make ammo we wanted but instead they do this weird workaround
---
Lol well done. You win 900 imaginary atoms.
---
Ok.  Sounds like I was basing my thoughts on bad info.
---
For the record, when im melting the bosses i do it on a private. Nobody wants to be that guy, unless they ARE that guy lol but i figure my first comment got downvoted cause someone thinks I'm depriving my fellow players of public server loots.. thats pretty frowned upon so i just had to throw that out there. Sometimes the dps gets away from ya for sure
---
What's obvious is you're one of those twits who can't back up their bullshit and decides to fall back on calling anyone that disagrees with them a fanboy.
---
It might actually bring more people to your camp if you can tell others exactly what you have to offer.  
---
Curious, what would be your issue with a text chat, especially if you can turn it off?
---
neither seem to be working now
---
FOMO if the fuel that runs FO76
---
Yes! Take that internetz. Today 900 fake fake dollaroos, tomorrow the world!
---
Fair point
---
This. This is the best ATLAS reward imo. Fortunately the sale is during my bday. I’m gonna reach the scrip limit and go nuts on that day!
---
Enclave grenades to call airstrikes. You'll never play Line in the Sand the same way after that. 
---
Scorched Earth also gets better with it.
---
I'd definitely play more and be more engaged if there weren't caps to how much bullion or scrip.i can get a day, but before that they would have to implement a guild/clan system because mmos live and die in how the community can interact. You can get through long boring grinds because you have your friends with you to make it enjoyable
---
What was the date when you checked nukakrypt? They could have been lSt weeks codes and not yet updated.
---
I don't need to give my family or neighbors new excuses to think I'm bat scat crazy 😂... But yes that's obligatory standard operating procedure there!
---
So you are forced to login everyday and develop a growing annoyance. 
---
The same thing goes if not even more for the No Mic emote which should be a permanent free instalment in the shop for all new and returning players.
---
Just so were clear, youre dead set on excusing bethesda wasting resources on frivolous nonsense when the base game is barely a shell with no end game content riddled with bugs exploits and broken quests.
---
And im a twit? LOL
---
No lol 
---
I’ll play more if we had dungeons and 8man challenging encounter ( raids ) . I least we got daily ops which I hoped there are like dungeons and have no daily limit 
---
I would also play more if this game had better equipment system like (gearset , gearscore and different quality)
---
Let's hope they double the daily limit on the legendary crusher at the same time. If they don't, the purveyor's lobby floor is gonna be full of bags.
---
I agree. Played the original Halo PC a few days ago (which was from 2003) and that had text chat. A 17 year old game has a feature that a 2018 one still doesn’t have.
---
Tse dragons could one shot the queen back then but I meant the condition overall I dont mind firing more shots if my gun can last more than ten minutes of playing and the ammo cost is ridiculous for so few rounds.
---
An interesting read.  Thanks for sharing
---
Yea pretty much the same as you, I never got the whole complaining about scrip limit until recently when I hit level 50 and suddenly my inventory is full of shitty 3 star legendaries and I can't get rid of them. Definately needs either removed or bumped up a lot imo. Would make the game feel less like a job having to log on constantly to get the daily amounts
---
I think you did the best possible job considering 76’s limitations (the biggest one being looking much different than F3)
---
Are you on PS4? Add me. Andreslamantis. I know maybe 30 mods, powerful automatic is one of them. Also know the silencer.
---
I am more likely to give you a better radium rifle and some plans than to steal from you. I am beyond endgame.
---
Crop dust must be much better than I imagined from that kind of response.
---
Better 10 Assaultrons than 1 Mirelurk King.
---
Yeah dont use the camp skin lol
---
When Bethesda announced fallout 76 and “free DLC forever” i was so against it because I knew they were going to monetize the game different. I prefer if it was paid DLC because the dlc will be better quality and more consistent product
---
Or maybe they shouldn't lock it behind limited time limits? Not everyone has 24 hours to spend on some silly video game.
---
The tune sounds like Baby Steps. Can anyone confirm?
---
Not that I’d ever report anyone for this but booting a rando off the team to make room for a friend to then have the rando start screaming at you through the tv till you mute them is highly annoying so...If that helps fix that up a bit I don’t mind
---
As a former psych major, I feel obliged to note that in the 5 years since that article was written, there's been much more research and data collected on all this, and the big companies like activision, ea, bethesda, epic, etc. have no doubt been at the front of that. Since gaming is in most cases a business rather than a passion project or hobby at this point, the lining of executive or investor pockets is the top priority and they would not be doing what they are doing if it did not lead to that, despite whatever people think about themselves or others
---
Honestly I think it’s just laziness rather than money. They seem to have gotten especially bad lately. Have you seen the atomic shop items for the past several weeks? They suck!
---
I believe bethesda was warned about the critter spawning from the PTS and they ignored it or did not see the info in time and that led to that issue. Believe it or not they have a handful of very passionate people that know the engine probably better then the developers, and they send very detailed reports sometimes with a fix. Bethesda just does not always listen.
---
I can't say for sure but think about it this way. The photomode glitch essentially allows you to phase through things temporarily. When you happen to spawn inside scenery or such, instead of being locked into a single spot, the game will "push" you out of the object. 
---
Some thicker doors can have several layers or the thickness may prevent you from getting close enough to "properly" phase through the door enough that you could simply push your way through the rest.
---
Thats how I was for 8 years. Until I got this new job. No more standing and sitting for 8 hours doing the same thing. I traded second shift for first, and getting paid to do something youtube could teach you in 5 minutes.
---
Dont think the type of people that still play 76 are gonna be into a role playing game
---
I would play more if there was less grind  and less RNG.  Also would play more if there was text chat, could actually do group content then.  Would definitely play more if they had pvp servers with faction wars.
---
I would buy the same amount of Atom shop stuff either way. Currently I buy only if I want something and can afford it.  Don't care if I miss out since it will be back eventually.
---
If you have the scrap collection, that's really all it is, it doesn't gather anything different, really sucky of Bethesda to only offer it for such a short time though......
---
Did you try both codes on there?  33701503 is the other
---
BRAVO  33701503
---
needed to see this, thanks
---
They like to be complicated in pretty much every way.
---
Yeah lol I got it now the site updated thx anyway
---
The camps without an active vendor doesn't appear on your map unless the owner is on your team
---
My two shot auto grenade launcher has 999 rounds. The bug happens when you change weapons using the shortcuts (left on PS4) and a weapon "thinks" it can load as much as the other weapon. I was switching from Gatling to launcher to Gatling and voila!
---
People love me at public events. Everything goes boom for minutes, no pause, no breaks. Good luck finding bodies to loot, though.
---
Yeah I got it now, that wasn’t there before but I refreshed it
---
Bethesda support haven't been sympathetic about any issues since wastelanders.
---
The first time I did it, I laughed, then I cried, because how accurate it was.
---
Why would I want something I used to get for free when I can instead pay *more* for it?
---
I wonder why they decided to do that huge terms of service agreement today, another ban wave perhaps?
---
Well, I’m a bit slow, it seems. Thanks for the insights.
---
There is a glitch that let's player place any collection, but it might be a ban risk...
---
&gt; No third party software or scripts. Mods anyone?
---
Yeah, the text chat mod counts as 3rd party so fuck deaf and mute players.
---
Agreed. This was the most consumable article I could find. I'm sure there's peer reviewed articles related to this with better science but my attempt was simply to add some level of understanding to how the things we may or may not enjoy in 76 are being built. Games like fortnite have made hundreds of millions of dollars on this model.
---
OK. If it was a lvl 14 person who was new to the game and didn't know the difficulty of the event, I would be chill with it. Honestly, I could go for some extra XP. But anyone over 120...no. Just no.
---
Probably just some basic updating in light of current events in the news along side of dozens of glitches being exploited and players saying they didn't know.
---
Weird we just did the 33701503 and that didnt work either...
---
I still haven’t rolled a chest that is worthy of keeping.
---
The one that increases the Chems and ammo you find. I tried it and I was able to make the daily 1400 caps in an hour of exploring and really playing the game.
---
When I play this I always have on podcasts/music, so I don't use voice and also may not hear you.
---
I would be very chatty with a text system though.
---
Oh you use to put in time and earn them for free? You were that guy..
---
Some weekly stuff would be nice but I can understand why they do daily, it is for business reasons.  Just don't stress yourself out about it, especially if you already have good PA.   Hell, I only bought my second SS plan yesterday, still need mods for it too.  My current armour serves me well enough and burnout isn't fun at all.
---
My god I was wondering if I was just hearing things. Thanm you for validating my sanity
---
Oh really, I just used that one and it worked
---
it takes like 3 minutes to get to prep if you're doing it the illegal way.
---
Nope. And I’ve been on them all.
---
I won’t level up everyday that’s for sure. I’m hoping they add the green house set  for gold bullion. I have around 10,000 gold bullion so I should be fine. I’m just getting to the handmade skin and calling it over unless there’s a lot more time
---
I know, but I have migraines and stuff, so the graphics that come with doing it the "illegal" way are a huge migraine and seizure trigger for me unfortunately.
---
It would make way more sense to save those and buy rank at higher levels when it takes more score points to level. Seems like a waste to buy rank before then.
---
Raider one? It's a resin of the regular scrap collectron!
---
I think you must have just found some less than sociable people, most will wave back and the like, some will even drop you a bunch of plans and recipes so it's definately worth trying to interact with as many people as you can. And the thing you were invited to would have been a public team. There's a few types of public teams all with different names like building teams or event teams. The names don't really mean anything, such as a building team not necessarily meaning you have to or should build. They just provide different bonuses. For example, building teams provide everyone in the team an intelligence buff depending on how many people are in the team, up to a total of +4 intelligence for a full team of 4. Other teams provide other buffs that you can see in the public teams menu. Again you don't have to do anything specific in the team, but if possible it's always worth being in one since you earn a small amount of caps for every quest a team mate completes, not to mention the benefits you are gaining such as the intelligence buff as well as the fact you are helping others simply by joining since they also get the same buff.
---
So whats your solution here exactly?  They fire the entire art team so they aren't wasting resources on anything other than fixing bugs?  They take the people whose job are modeling and texturing and all of the other stuff involved in creating new atom shop assets, lock them in a room together and see if they can "monkeys writing Shakespeare" their way through some bugs in the games code before the end of the day?
---
You're a twit because you claim that OBVIOUSLY all of their money is going straight into the fucking atom shop when in reality you don't know the bare minimum about how game development even works.
---
Fuck. Off.
---
Mine worked in bravo
---
I’m not going to lie this is very confusing for me, but thank you for the insight I’ll start looking for better armour and weapons
---
TSE Gatling Gun is legacy now?
---
Yeah I couldn't get either for Charlie to work just now
---
Could you *be* anymore helpful?  Lol
---
Its almost like they could add different tabs?
---
The codes on nukacrypt seem to be wrong the one for Charlie isn't working either wasted 4 cards trying.
---
Sorry, but how many hours someone has accumulated in a game doesn’t make them sad if it brings them joy. You wanna know what makes a person look sad? When they choose to pick on other people for no good reason. 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
I'm trying to do a good dps solo build for this alt.
---
Seasons end at 12pm EST on the last day, so be prepared for next season and get your stuff the previous evening or early morning.
---
Neither worked for me in Charlie. Did both codes twice and nothing.
---
Explosive energy weapons are legacy. Gatling laser, gatling plasma, laser rifle, cryolater, etc... people saying ballistic weapons being legacy are just uninformed or trying to scam people
---
Damn I did not prepare for this... I’ve got about 1600 scrip set back for it. 
---
Well I plan on spending it all on armor anyways so I should get some mileage out 1600.
---
Nothing of sexual character.... The whole game is full of teddy bear doing innuendos 😂
---
Question do items scale to your character level? Or will I receive level 45 and 50 rewards at level 10?
---
YAY.
---
Can I still claim my rewards that I got?
---
Needs more upvotes!! 😂😂
---
Already did, they send me to Bethesda support
---
I made a post like this too, a Dev replied to it and said it would be done eventually.
---
Honestly maybe it's more of a problem with the way the power armour plans are priced. 5000 gold bullion  is a lot for it.
---
The two support responses from Bethesda is nothing at all, or locked and still no response!
---
Goddamn it I wanted to make the high elf god Hodd Toward!!! (Any spiffing brit fans around?)
---
It's a sign of the times brother. If it can offend you, it's no good. Forget satire or nuance. Jokes are a tool of the devil.
---
My two biggest complaints are that some atom shop items are just grossly overpriced, and as a result can feel underwhelming when you get them because you paid a lot for them. The other being fallout first, locking private worlds behind a pay wall just feels wrong to me. Justify it how you want, but it just rubs me the wrong way. Also the scrapbox is very pay to win feeling, as most of my stash is taken up by scrap and so I can't really store any legendaries, which is a problem when you account for the daily scrip limits as I have to hold onto some legendaries because I can't trade them in yet, whilst people that throw more money at bethesda have more storage and in theory can store more scrip. I get that some people don't mind this but again, it just rubs me the wrong way
---
Nothing is working! 4 keycards wasted! Dice please!
---
So you hit them up before a weekend and a holiday? Cmon bruh
---
My guess is 
---
Bloodied weapon does more damage the lower your health is. Meaning the closer you are to dying. So it’s safe to assume your character would be covered in bruises and blood from being close to dying. 
---
So people that use bloodied weapons essentially call themselves a bloodied build.
---
I don't sleep much at night,  so I've been working nights whenever I can since my first job back in 95.
---
Earle died while I was falling down the shaft and I got trapped in the rubble, so I just danced until the timer ran out but missed out on all of the loot. 😭
---
Odd.. did it twice and it still rejected it. Does platform matter? I'm on ps4.
---
No
---
Yeah that’s ultimately my point.
---
My system super mutes the game sound unless I have a headset plugged in. Not sure if it's a game problem or my old fogey xbox. I usually mute it, sometimes I forget. I wish I could just play without it plugged in, but what can you do?
---
Hmm it shouldn’t, I’m on Xbox. Did u try the other code
---
Yes, you lost them.
---
Ok kiddo here it comes hope your diaper was just changed
---
Perfect comparison of launch but a vastly different approach and currently much higher concurrent playerbase
---
No Mans Sky. Was a broken heap of shit at launch, not a cent was monetized, and yet they still are running, online services function without micro transactions and have added multiples more content than bethesda has to fo76
---
Grow up, its ok to be wrong. Telling me to “fuck.off” with uneed punctuation doesnt put you in a better position. But being a shilling fanboy incapable of critical thinking, Im not surprised. 
---
Enjoy your nap 👶
---
Damn. It was only some scrip (not a huge deal for me) but I also lost 5000 caps
---
I got plenty going on - as much as possible given covid anyhow - I just bothered to take five minutes to check.
---
But here's the thing. People use the defense that you get more hypothetical atoms from the S.E.A.S.O.N.S yet here we are, finally admitting that the system was introduced to separate people from their money.
---
Also, what *massive free dlcs* are you referring to? Wastelanders(released 16 months after 76) with its roughly 11 quests? Or tedious backpack grind the game?
---
Keep in mind Fo3 dlcs were only 10 bucks. That's less than the price of most power armor skins.
---
Hell, even fo4 dlcs were at most $25(All of which were released under a year from 4, mind you). Or I could buy *two power armor skins* wow.
---
Uh, wrong. Rockstar will give away money just to encourage you to come on. Like if you log on and play at least once in the  month right now you get a million in game dollars in gta each month until it comes out on ps5. And all the time they are throwing these bonuses (this is the money you pay for). And while costs are expensive in gta it’s still quicker to grind what you need (and you don’t have to log in each day or miss out on what little they give you but play on your own time) with what they give you to make in game money. 
---
Their season pass for red dead I managed to start much later than the season pass on 76 and finished way before I finished 76’s and I wasn’t even trying to finish it, just playing the game. And I’ve managed to get quite a bit of free gold through different promotions mostly requiring you to log in. 
---
Bethesda so far has never given away free atoms just to get you to go on, they were already stingy with how much you could earn a day before the season pass, you barely earn any with it. And it took a lot of complaining before they agreed to stop doing really complicated ones or ones that requires a lot of luck to get. And they can’t even let you earn a few measly ones in the week or two between passes. Which honestly people would not even earn enough to discourage buying atoms at all and they can’t even do that. 
---
So yeah, bethesda makes rockstar look generous. And trust me, I bitch about rockstar’s model too... which is why I use them to show how stingy bethesda is being.
---
Purveyor items scale to your level.  
---
Certain weapons have a minimum level, so you can’t roll a 50cal until you hit 25, lvl 15 for a handmade, etc.  The same goes for plans.  You won’t see lever gun plans until you reach lvl 25, for example.
---
Of course, having a level 10 bloody/explosive/reload hunting rifle would feel very disappointing when you’re lvl 50+.  If at all possible, try to at least get to lvl 45 in time for the sale.
---
If you only have like 500 scrip, go nuts.  You can always gift a nice underlevel weapon to an alt character if a friend is willing to hold it for you while you swap characters.
---
No. Limiting trade to ‘guilds’ is a horrible idea. I don’t like most of the rest, but that in particular Is a hard pass.
---
That was probably the event that did it for me. Vats perks worked well with adrenaline, but the lower rate of fire with no stealth kinda killed it for me. I switched to a furious 10mm submachine gun and took down enemies so much quicker. It was annoying to do those events and switch perks in-between.
---
Commando or heavy gunner then
---
What a dumb ending to the game lol.
---
someone left a treasure hunt for their wedding proposal and u stole the ring smfh
---
Its been 9 years since skyrim was released. Still at least 2 or 3 years before es6, maybe more. So sure fallout 5 is a guarantee, if you dont mind the fact that it probably wont come out until we're closer to 2030 than 2020
---
By that logic, they owe us atoms(and free will) when they took out the old system, so they're still in debt
---
I wish I could disagree but it is just way too true.
---
Oh god... I placed my camp 2000 hours ago when I started the game. I’ve taken pictures of where exactly the foundations are so I could build it back up exactly how I had it, but I have no idea where my camp module was originally placed... I’ve moved it a hundred times around the camp.
---
I second this.
---
Guess I was lucky earlier.  No more nukes tonight then prob 😢
---
While previous ones never did, hopefully this time Legendary modules and Vault steel will also be on sale.
---
It is true that it is easy to progress. I didn’t play much this season and I got around 10 levels in a day
---
Nocturnal Bone Hammers...
---
His precious
---
That’s the plan!😊
---
Thanks. I take a lot of shots, and access to the emotes will open up an entire new world of possibilities.
---
Awesome answer, thank you very much
---
That’s so nice of you! I’ll have to do that too, if I can ever reach max!😅
---
Because Bethesda is under the false belief that missiles are powerful, even though they're the reason that they're not!
---
What was midnight on the 8th?
---
What a great experience!
---
I really enjoy the power fist, though I’m not sure if it’s the best
---
Hahaha🤣
---
I use a knife
---
Didn’t Beth recently change the description to make it proximity based though? I’ve resisted taking my HM serum because of the new wording.
---
I run 5 in intelligence. 3 in nerd rage and 2 in gunsmith. Make sure you have the forceful stock. I usually only have to use one repair kit at most for an SBQ fight.
---
It really does. Not only do you have the emote itself but as the animation transitions you can fix it or plan it to look like other things (like grabbing something or the likes). Have fun!
---
Happy to help.
---
I would play more if they upped the stash limit.
---
At least console players get text chat, but only player to player.
---
I know this is tongue in cheek but I can totally see someone getting banned for double sided walls and the community will explode. Just hope it's not me
---
Mate, they're reselling skins from fo4 a game I already had. So..ya, I did spend money on it. Then they did 0 effort and resold it to some poor saps who are out here bloating multi-billion dollar companies
---
I just booted up the game and saw the updated terms agreement and my first thought was "Great, I'm banned for the ammo factory" before I read it hahaha.
---
I have such limited time in my adult life crafting ammo is such a hassle and I've been having trouble finding the ammo I use in vending machines lately. I've been building a couple underground when I claim a workshop while I was completing dailys recently.
---
What have you heard about them going after ammo factories? Just random users on here speculating it? Before I started doing it, I'd claimed abandoned workshops that someone already placed them down at. I hope they don't end up catching innocent people in the process trying to crack down...
---
How does commando work? What weapon is its focus? Is there a guide for this build?
---
The book was awsome
---
Yeah happened to me on last day of meat week. Standing there at 12pm eastern waiting for the event to start.
---
So you can't fast travel when you launch duh
---
Legacy plasma. Jffr handmade, tesla
---
Have you tried Addictol?
---
Keeps happening to me on earl now that I can unload an entire lmg drum. Never happened on SBQ since she keeps moving and I have to use controlled bursts
---
Nope I tried both cuz it's all I have.
---
NOAP. 
---
Joining a building team is the first thing i do when I log on, if none is created, I just create a new one and enjoy the perk. I don't exactly "Get" the thinking behind it all, I just enjoy the benefits.
---
I really wish the jetpack skins worked with secret service!
---
The Lengendary Run ended
---
interesting, i didn't know plasmas were good. Ill check it out
---
The problem isn't all these things - it's the player base. A good portion of them came from Bethesda's other games, which are all offline single player PvE games. You might get a few on side for some of this but Bethesda's already tried numerous times and they've all mostly failed.
---
Survival worlds no longer exist. Nuclear Winter is a shade of its former self. Bethesda hasn't had the heart to euthanise PvP even though we're most of the way there. I bet you Hunter/Hunted is something at least half the player base is unaware of what it is.
---
Public teams aren't actual teams but a group of solo players in it just for the buff. There isn't even much team work for tent pole public events like Project Paradise or Radiation rumble, which is why it fails so often or often doesn't get even remotely close to max loot potential.
---
I say all this absolutely not against guilds and the like. I just don't think it'll get the following that people would like it do. Survival mode and PvP proved that.
---
I tried both and neither password works..wasted 4 nuke cards.
---
There was something about conning and scamming other players in there, so that must mean no more trap camps.
---
It’s all bugged right now.  You can try last weeks.  But it seems like neither are working.  Last weeks worked for me in Charlie earlier.  But same thread said wasn’t anymore a few mins ago.
---
Charlie worked for me last night of nukacrypt?
---
Bravo-33701503
---
From my understanding, Shotgun damage would be the better bet. Explosive damage only does 20% of your base damage, and Demolition Expert would only boost that portion of the damage.
---
33701503
---
I use shotguns and have 95% accuracy and completely miss every pellet. Just fo76 things
---
I tried that but didnt works
---
Thanks
---
Well legacy ones are good. I prefer vampires or maybe a junkies one if you're that type of build
---
This reply is bang on.
---
cheers for the info :]
---
I completely forgot about the bot rip :(
---
9.Hope they bring back the previous atom reward system
---
This is my trying to do something to bring back more of a community that you see in other MMOs like WOW. I just wish that it was more of an online experience like it was initially advertised.
---
Nothing worked for Bravo.
---
When your in stealth you can just switch it to the other view type and you can see it fine
---
i have, aae 90, be 15, ve 25, ve 15, fe 250, ZE 90, JE +1p, de, tse. Which one do you think would be best?
---
Maybe there could be an extra incentive to trade within your guild. Some xp maybe? Would have to be nonexploitable
---
I can hear the song echoing through the bus and into the ruins
---
This is also what I do. I rarely have a weapon break in a boss fight unless it is an explosive legacy or laser.
---
How do you do that 
---
Nvm I got it
---
I just switched to forceful. Huge difference in durability. Thanks.
---
12am is midnight, not 12pm
---
Same time the game updates everyweek
---
It’s the old ones
---
You should have a statue built in your honor if you're first!
---
I find you can encounter them more often in The Mire, also Raider Punk will send you on quests to hunt one occasionally!
---
Maybe something like that. I just want to try to bring people together more than the mostly solo experiences that I had.
---
Same, did some digging a few weeks ago, to check if its in the game and it is. so idk why they still didnt add those.
---
Oh and a hey noob come get this free shit emote
---
People have been asking for guilds for a long time. I don’t know if you mean big guilds like responders guild and BOS, but I think having small ~40 player guilds could be cool too. Maybe each guild could have a private instance and a treasury.
---
Yeah, unfortunately they don’t drop anything unique to them like the other cryptids, should at least drop alien blaster rounds or something. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
alright fine, let me eat a banana and watch a bit of netflix first, *jeez*
---
Plenty of guides out there, this is a[ good one by Captainoob.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6k_iq2f2UQw). Very similar to rifleman but the dps is phenomenal. Auto rifles and a high agility perception build. Basically the most popular build there is, with or without throwing bloodied into the mix.
---
yeah i know it's bethesda. even i don't care how many bugs there are,but membership is kind a different xD
---
You don't get wealthy blowing all your money on 18 dollar cosmetic items
---
I heard it from a random in game source, who claims to have heard it from a youtuber. Reliable? No. Worrisome if you’re bootlegging ammo? Yeah. I can neither confirm nor deny whether I’ve ever manufactured ammo illicitly, but if I had been, I might be concerned about either I need to be stockpiling ammo while I can.
---
holy shit. 
---
i thought learning of the legendary chicken made me impressed, this is next level.
---
Midnight is always the start of a new day, not the end of a day. The only time I ever marked midnight as an end of day event was in the military when you had to log 00:00 as the end of log and 00:00 as the start of the new logging day and that was stupid, ha.
---
I was thinking something like that. Maybe having different subsets in the larger Responder or BOS?
---
Yep it is. Score is earned acct wide.
---
I need a "Hang on I have to power up my dang headset" emote...
---
Thanks i tried my best! I loved the darker graphics fallout 3 had, really gave that apocalyptic vibe to the game
---
Welcome to the leap frog club.lol
---
What's the max scrip you can have on a single character?
---
What is bloodied and junkie? Ive read that junkie is using and being addicted to Chen's but, how the hell is being addicted to Chen's beneficial? Doesn't addiction give you debuffs?
---
that happened to me too, beth said "go to steam for help" but steam said " they can't help for service which offered by other company, not steam"
---
are you kidding me bethesda? xD
---
it would be the dumbest of dumb Bethesda moves to remove the double wall glitch, then give it back to the community, only to ban everyone for using it a few weeks later.
---
Q/FFR Gamma against bloodied builds
---
Who pooped in your cornflakes?
---
Lord knows I'm lazy but c'mon...it's all of 5 seconds.
---
It would be the most bethesda thing they could possibly do and I believe that would be the end of 76 as we know it if they ever did that
---
You don't HAVE to do anything really but some quests are required to do certain things. Like you have to complete a questline in order to be able to launch nukes yourself but if you're okay with just piggybacking then you never need to do that, most people don't even after they complete the questline ha. There are some really good storylines though that you will miss out on by not doing the quests.
---
They don't owe you shit. They weren't obligated to give away free atoms to begin with,  they only did so because in common practice it's meant to incentivize people into bigger purchases by giving them a little money to work with.
---
Yea, to be honest I am a little concerned about that also. But, I mean - I am not planning to change so if they ban me, they ban me. The Wow expansion is coming out next month followed by Cyberpunk in November so if Bethesda really does not want my money with FO1st, who am I to argue?
---
I believe this is the quest that is still not working.  Beth is aware but haven’t released a fix.
---
I'm tired of trying to chase them down
---
Gandalf would be proud
---
Your not lazy enough
---
Yea: If you want to lunch nukes, you need to do the quests. Also if you want to enable the gold trade.
---
Neither code for Alpha worked for me and now I’m out of keycards. Thanks Nukacrypt 😁👍👍👍
---
1k
---
So technically, shouldn't names like the Joker or any comic book villain count in this case?
---
Maybe even Batman since he kind of stalks criminals....
---
:D i hope there won't be any more victims!
---
It's a laudable goal. I'm all for that too.
---
The only way I can see that happening is that there is a direct incentive for people to do so but not in a way that they feel forced into it. 
---
A good example that seriously needs to be a priority is to tie event rewards directly to successful completion of events. Right now, you get rewarded individually during the event. So if even if the event fails, you still get rewarded for focusing on killing enemies or chasing after legendaries. Those that focus on events get pretty much nothing if the event fails whereas the other group always get rewarded so what's the point of helping to complete the event.
---
Once that's out of the way, then we need stuff that requires more group coordination. Text chat can help somewhat, especially in regions that have mixed languages, as it's often easier to communicate and understand people in text vs voice with thick accents. 
---
However, having events that necessarily require a group to work together is a must as well. Like with WoW raids. Aside from maybe a few, they're just impossible to solo. Have something like that with 76 but not in a way where you need a dedicated guild to complete it but it's intuitive for individuals to know what they need to do as a group to complete the event. Fasnacht and Meat week are great examples of this but we need more.

---
Hey there lil mama, lemme whisper in your ear
---
But, some of the prizes aren't, like perk cards and lunch boxes. so keep in mind which character you want to get those rewards when you click claim.
---
Junkie’s is a weapon prefix that boosts your damage if you’re addicted. Yes your specials take a hit but your damage is better. Bloodied is a boost to damage if you are low health. It synergises well with unyielding armor (boosting your specials at low health) and some perks and mutations. Both builds trade off some aspects of your build to increase damage and dps. Bloodied is a weappns’s prefix but also applies to a whole build that includes the weapon effect, adrenal reaction mutation, need rage perk cards and unyielding armor boosts.
---
Bs
---
plans just don't sell. ammo sells and thats about it.
---
Does it still work? This game does patch a lot does that have an effect? Or do you have to keep up to date on it with nexus, vortex, ect?
---
I made two characters to help with leveling the seasons and now they have some use as a builder and event grinder. Most of my plans go to them now and what ever is left over gets sold at 1 cap. (Except mole miner Gauntlets and ivory Revolver grips, those are free and nobody buys them)
---
Hey, you never know. His friend might be a deaf/mute... in which case, I am sorry regarding his disability (seriously - that's tough to deal with)

That claim window was bs. The BOS Collectron was the only reward from Fortifying Atlas that I cared about.
---
I don't know but whenever I met any wanted player, I pull out my Affr gamma gun, 3 to 5 shots, it always work.
---
Silly video games have silly rewards.  Do you reallllly care if you get them?
---
Then they didn't give me free shit, did they?
---
Pretty much. Sorry man.
---
Edit: have you tried the work around, where you put the blood in the centrifuge first, then put in the T fuse? That seems to work for some people.
---
Ask around for a fallout 1st member to friend you, I did it and was able to progress the quest on a private server.
---
the mini backpack plan is fairly easy to get FYI
---
ive been looking for a while and cant find a settler spawn where i can place my camp
---
I would play more if scrip limits weren't so low. After a certain point I get tired of dumping items.
---
Well thanks anyway.
---
It must have reset during that time &amp; nukacrypt hadn't updated their servers
---
Do you have to do the main quest chain to launch nukes? I just don't really give a shit about the overseer. The story, of what I have played of it, seems flawed. They try to portray this motherly figure out of the overseer and it just doesn't click with me. We understand that overseers are important but if you know anything about fallout lore you know that usually overseers were power mongering assholes. Usually, and what was done in 3 and 4 you were searching for an actual family member so the importance of that character was understood. There was an obvious bond there and a much better reason to leave the vault. The overseer? She was nice to you so you have to go find her? Basically its like "hey I wasn't an asshole so you better come find me!" Like what the fuck? Just lwt me out that big gear door and let me make my own way.
---
You lift immaturity and pettiness to an artform.
---
You haven't even completed all the main story or played many events, you sound like a spurious player just looking to hate on Bethesda for all the work they do
---
I’ve been melted several times by pvp’ers with a legacy explosive Gatling plasma. One of the most duped weapons in the game but it still destroys everything
---
I had to completely exit the game, and go back in 4-5 times in a row until it worked. This was only two weeks ago.
---
Wow. Ok I’ll try that. Thanks
---
But do you have to do the main quest chain to launch nukes. On my main i just got to the gold trade part but haven't really explored it. What can you get out of it?
---
high level players or folks who work to have a well curated stocklist tend to reach cap limits and sell only when things get low.
---
FFR weapons are top tier. I run with a junkie's 25/25 handmade.
---
not gonna lie but in a game with a checklist of objectives you could.. I don't know.. simply do what you wish to do?
---
The text chat mod is dependent on another mod called SFE and that one is broken by just about every update.  It also didn't work on the Game Pass version of the game.
---
But the mod author is a trooper and gets it working in a couple of days, sometimes before the actual patch goes live.
---
Only two things I regularly craft are cranberry relish and vegetable starch, cranberry relish is a great XP boost and vegetable starch gives me a reliable source of adhesive
---
I've been using mine since nearly beta and I love it. Second this.

---
And I imagine the Game Pass release increased the PC numbers quite a bit as well.
---
Aside from magic weapons and such, I think people tend to use gamma guns.
---
What do you play on
---
much love my friend
---
Three rings for the Raider kings high in the sky;    
---
Seven for the Brotherhood in their halls of stone;  
---
Nine for Mothman's kin, drawn to light;  
---
One for the Overseer on her Vault throne  
---
In the town of Sutton where the Shadows lie.
---
I was where you were and found a reddit post from 2019. It just took a few tries but worked.
---
Yeah, to clarify, the season ends at 12pm EST. Get your claims in early for the next season!
---
Ps4
---
Technically we sorta have one where you look around and nod
---
I saw a YouTube video last night that said the bloodied builds were taking a major hit with the upcoming patch. Also, does the new patch allow you to respec? I thought I saw that somewhere.
---
Armourer does work for vault 94 armor, reduces it from 12 to 10. Not much of s difference unfortunately, but it's better than nothing.
---
Exactly.  When I saw it the first thing I thought was cheap reskin.  Garbage.
---
The Overseer's quest isn't really the main quest, she just branches the main quests together by giving you a "reason" to visit the different locations. You can ignore her holotapes if you really don't care about her, though I personally found some of them really well done. You need to complete the Enclave questlines to launch a nuke which I believe may make you do some of the other main lines as well to reach a certain point, but it's been awhile so I can't remember exactly how they all intertwine. Also if you want any of the new guns and armor, you will need to complete the Wastelanders questline for one of the factions because that will unlock the new gold bullion currency.
---
I wish I could give my cows the Last Laugh perk card where they drop a grenade and blow up the mf who killed them.
---
There's probably some truth to this.  Bethesda doesn't quite seem to get just how enormous an undertaking an "online SAS game" is.
---
It doesn't really make sense for any of the rewards to dissappear before the new season starts/when the patch drops. 
---
But cmon 3 days? Not even a week?
---
I feel attacked. 
---
I move a lot, I've had super nice camps and super basic camps - my last camp was just all of my shit on a road. all workshops just randomly placed including my bed. I've become obsessed with building micro camps that can accomodate all tables, vendors and stashboxes. I still havent found an ideal layout, so lately, all of my builds are just boxes on boxes.
---
Are you willing to trade items or caps for that handmade rifle?
---
?
---
I run 15 int on my main, so plenty of room. Lowest I run is 3 gunsmith (all my tools are bloodied right now)
---
I actually spent atoms to buy the level awarding atoms. It made it a little faster to get to those sweet perk cards, and have no regrets.
---
Well yea I knew that the quests have you leveled loot. That's another thing too. Ive had so many people on here tell me to not do any of the quests till 50 because of the leveled weapons/armor they give.
---
start crafting your legendaries. at least you'll get the type of weapon you want
---
Anyone have a link to their TOS?
---
Been asking for a "no thanks" emote for quite a while now. The "no way" is not the sentiment I am looking to convey.  I got my reasons for not doing trades but I'm not looking to blow people off. "No way" should have been "no thanks" from the beginning; "no way" is childish and something I can't imagine I would ever use.
---
All builds are taking a hit, and bloodied being the most overpowered build is hit hard. That said everyone seems to think it will still be the strongest build. And you can respec now and always have been able to. 
---
It’s also worth noting that you can switch between bloodied and non bloodied without respecing. The bloodied perks are usually worth having anyway (nerd rage and serendipity) for when things go wrong) and apart from that it’s just a case of lowering your health with radiation to go bloodied or using radaway to stop being blooodied.
---
Your welcome bud.
---
This too. Aligned barrel, forceful stock.
---
Yes, you need to do it, then do another one in the silo to finally launch it. And for the gold trade, the Secret Service sells you cool stuff, and also the plans for the best power armor in the game (its really expensive though, each part cost like 1650 gold)
---
Just some legal stuff to make it easier to give you a lifetime ban. Fuck Zenimax, and most definitely Fuck Bethesda.
---
It is a subscription perk, they advertised that items will be in the shop exclusively to FO1st members. This was always the case, they just only recently started fulfilling that promise to us who do subscribe.
---
Yeah pretty much just a waiting game at this point for that quest.
---
I only regret fast traveling to camps when I fall through the floor because the building hasn't loaded yet, causing me to get stuck. I regret traveling to camps built up in the mountains, where I fall and break my legs when I fast travel. Same goes for camps built over water.
---
We should ask for a text chat.
---
Honestly I just need more stuff to do that isn’t complete repetition. I’ve completed the missions, killed the queen and Earl a buttload of times, got the items I actually want. There’s nothing left to do for me.
---
I haven’t picked a leveled lock or hacked a leveled terminal in over a year... I just got so fed up with swapping perk cards constantly. Most likely just random junk or some plans I already know in them anyways.
---
Now I want to replay fo3, if only it wasn't a headache to fix on pc :(
---
I think you misread what I said. On 7 I was agreeing with you.
---
Well, that escalated quickly!
---
This happened to me last month, it was so frustrating since I prefer to do some things on a private server.
---
Haha. Imagine if they dropped turbo fertilizer grenades instead. There'd be some many brahman sacrificed in the name of the gourd god. 😂
---
Looking for a kickass fixer,have one but only 74 damage,and not into bloodied.
---
How do you respec? By that I mean redo your special points. I know you can switch perk cards.
---
Didn’t they patch that?
---
Haha
---
If its a silly video game why do you care so much about a skin for a silly robot? lol
---
Wooo.. look at all those downvotes, i believe i proved my point
---
Can’t do that but I have like 7000 caps don’t have the fixer plan
---
No. PC
---
Literally this....suddenly I’m overencumbered, what? Why? Oh it appears I was “rewarded” with missiles....
---
To be fair, we have text chat on Xbox. Not in game mind you. Its really useful and has allowed me invaluable communication with other players.
---
It likely was not a hacked ring, more likely a glitch. I developed for a mod menu, and I can tell you its simply not possible to create a legendary item. The server is in total control of that kind of thing.  
---
Either there was some bug when the item was generated for the user, or they found some way to put two items into one using a glitch.
---
The aspects of the TOS you’re pointing out don’t exist because ZeniMax is actually concerned about details of player-to-player behavior; they function as an aspect of legal protection on their part, should someone bring forth a suit regarding it.
---
I've had a lot of people tell me not do quests till I hit 50 because of the leveled loot you get from doing them. Is that right?
---
Me too, but only if 'college' is synonymous with 'middle school'...
---
Thank you so much. I really appreciate the words if wisdom and the tips and tricks. I really want the 98th item, which is the Subjugator Outfit, and if anything I really wanna squad up with some people and work togehter and get to work cranking out those dailies.
---
I really want that diamond above the barn as wall decor
---
Not if you don't care about things like late game gear / content /.
---
Yes if you care about late game gear/ content. 
---
There is a reason pre wastelanders got a lot of hate and that is a majority of people just disagree with you on that one. Having played beta i can firmly tell you the game felt pretty much pointless in every aspect.
---
I agree! If they’re going to add more to the head area, I’d also like more tattoos/war paints 👏🏼
---
What an odd accusation. I am level 443 been playing since beta. took a month off before wastelanders and been waiting on patch 22, though i doubt it will make the game better, but i am curious about legendary perks and daily ops. But come nov 19 you know what i will be playing.
---
And i am not hating on Beth. If they dont learn from this glorious failure, someone else will, cuz there is the nub of a great game in there.
---
Can you give a source for where someone said they were only able to play three minutes (or anywhere remotely close to that time) a week? Or is this just a pathetic attempt to diminish the issues that other players are having with Bethesda’s anti consumer practices?
---
Once you’re above level 50 you can either choose a new perk card or a to swap a special
---
Please tell me it's from Luke Skywalker disguised as a stormtrooper banging on his helmet and shrugging like the mic is broken.
---
Edit: Darn.
---
Did you read the new terms of service agreement from start to finish?
---
I corrected it. Went braindead while typing apparently lol.
---
Not at an end, but they'll only have to ask once instead of repeating incessantly.
---
Any chance that cheating program had the initials "E.R."? Genuinely curious about this.
---
Honestly, the weapons and armor you get from questing is not nearly as good as what you can get from the random rolls. There are maybe two or three "good" ones but even those can be outclassed. I have two characters and on one I waited until 50 to do everything and I still ended up scripping all the rewards I got and have new, better gear anyways. When I'm talking about the new weapons and armor that actually are good, I meant the stuff you have to buy with gold, so you'll want to unlock the gold trade if anything, which is done by doing the Wastelanders questline for at least one faction (Settlers or Raiders). The rest of the game is broken down into other faction stories that all feed into the "main story" of the Scorched overall, with each of the original factions having quests of their own that then kind of weave into the others (Responders, Enclave, BoS, etc).
---
When it comes to every fallout/elder scrolls game I never start questing right off. I explore. Now I'll admit I didn't play it pre-wastelanders so I can't say what it was like but, I'd much prefer making my own story rather than playing someone else's. However, I respect your opinion given that you actually know what was like.
---
Oh... I only play in 1st person...
---
Pduch70 is psn...
---
Adding a mute function would be easy for a competent dev team. Team Fortress 2's mute function blocks both text and voice chat.
---
Yes. Do you think there’s something I’m missing?
---
Would you happen to remember last weeks code for Charlie?
---
Well your information is fucking wrong...? Everyone who commented here just wasted keycards.
---
Ok give me like 10 minutes
---
You can also just use nuka crypt for the launch codes
---
Hmm well full health is always good so either ve je or tse
---
To swap a special? Im tired so I might being reading that wrong. How do you swap a special?
---
Did you actually try to claim them? I logged onto my lazy friend's character and redeemed all his rewards today after the atom shop update and I know that 100% for sure he was able to get them. I even checked just now to make sure he could put the ghillie skin on a backpack since that was the last thing he unlocked and it works.
---
I just want to be able to wear stuff over the stealth armour
---
Ignore their date, it's wrong. Release is November 19th.
---
Their point still stands, though. Not to mention Valhalla on November 17th.
---
Fed76 is a good site to use. https://fed76.info/pricing/?item=gauss&amp;effects=TS/50
---
1k quick sell, on PC you may be lucky and get towards what you want. This isn't definite and the site states that. It is a good source to use though.
---
Move a point you dont want in Charisma over to Luck for example
---
Huh. I haven’t. I guess I will
---
Aka- Pipe pistols and black powder rifles 50% sale !
---
I have a method for extracting the nuke code using datamining. Currently all 3 codes are 0000000. I think they are trying to fix the issue right now.
---
I don't even know where to post this but I just did collosal problem and the weapons I got are instigating lead pipe and hunters golf club, I just wasted so much ammo for this shit
---
How do you do that? Do you visit an npc or what?
---
Looks like nothing matters and it will auto complete no matter what. Don’t waste your resources fellow vault dwellers.
---
tried both thought i misentered first try burned 3 cards sitting in charlie on pc pissed
---
I would also like to know if the legendary mods are in sale but I'm not able to log on
---
i am at launch terminal for Bravo right now and nukacryot says no codes are working right now.  wtf
---
Also the market Reddit is good but is very strict on rules, you have to follow the format set out on their rule page thingy. Otherwise it will get auto-removed.
---
Wow really only 1k? I thought it’d be more than that
---
What is operation tidy?
---
This is the quality shit-posting we need more of.
---
I keep one of those in stock to let people who don't like my prices know how much I care about their opinions.
---
No it’s just an option when you get into the perk screen. Once you’re level 50
---
Emmm yea its kinda true, also the enemies are gonna kick your ass, im level 76 (lol the coicidence in a level 50 X01 power armor (the best one agains energy damage) and the Mr. Gutsys there hit really hard. Same with the Assaultrons
---
How many times can you do that? Does it cost anything?
---
Im an explosive build and not even i want missles
---
“Ok google, what is the definition of a joke?”
---
Well if you want it your way then I should be able to put my fixer skin on my combat rifle !!!
---
Considering how much money is pumped into the game on the regular, they're doing an atrocious job upkeeping anything!
---
A bad idea.   All enemies will level scale to each player.  So a lvl 30 and a lvl 300 will see the same super mutant as being their own level.  Been playing for 1,000 hours?  Nothing is a milk run anymore.  Been playing for 20 hours and still getting killed by everything?  It won't get any easier.
---
Yeah that's if you want it gone. Discretion is advised. You could list it on the market place for the price you want and you may get that. The site states 1k for a quick sell in the vendor. But best bet is to stick it in your vendor for what you want if you get no interest in the marketplace
---
I think I may have been responding to someone else post but accidentally replied to you.  That’s my bad, I apologize
---
Once per level up. But you dint get an extra perk card
---

I claimed it!’
---
*F*
---
Yea don't get me started on the assaultrons thier face beam is a bastard and I learned tonight that protectrons can nuke themselves!
---
We've been complaining about that non stop, Bethesda actively lock all support tickets asking for help.
---
Yeah i noted that in my updated post.
---
Isn’t that building from Fallout 4?
---
Nice.  Upvote
---
Oh ok
---
I finished the pass 3 weeks before this season ended. I was on most days but like you said only for an hour’ish I did have a massive sesh over the dxp weekend where I got 66 levels other than that I just did the dailys/weeklys.
---
It should be just added to your account automatically
---
Just saw that
---
So it did work? I wonder why so many people are spreading incorrect information. You can't unlock new stuff but anything unclaimed can still be added to your account it seems.
---
12 pm, not am
---
Yup! I guess someone meant to say you can’t get anything new, and people misinterpreted that and spread it around, without checking
---
Hey I’m all for whatever works for folks and makes them happy.  I was just reminding some folks that spending atoms isn’t a requirement
---
Honestly I prefer players who join my team and have nothing to do with me, let’s me do what I want while we all benefit.
---
1000 caps at best IMHO.  Not really that great in comparison to so many other legendaries. I've seen much better weapons go for far less. I've scripped weapons better than that. Lots of legendaries out there my friend.
---
private server or server hop on public to get it done.  It may take a few or several hops but you can do it.
---
Apparently not!
---
Now we're just missing the most important one.  [https://youtu.be/TW19M3VCeWc?t=34](https://youtu.be/TW19M3VCeWc?t=34)
---
you are looking for a server that had a data reset and no one else completed the quest since then
---
That’s all I needed to know. Your comment is just another pathetic “joke” making fun of members of the community who are not able to put in as much daily playtime as you. I can see one of the original premises of this franchise was not lost on you.
---
Check out who OP is
---
What new player will ever need radaways or the other trash really? NOBODY! Especially now that the beginning challenges now award trash instead of atoms lol.
---
Jim Sterling has some great videos about this on youtube
---
I deleted people from my friends list for doing this shit. If I spent resources to kill someone and you run up and take all their shit, you are dead to me forever.
---
The tadpole daily to get possum badges for backpack mods.
---
Someone get my collectron some Nukashine.  Let's kick him into overdrive getting those bottles!
---
I would love to have such an item. Wish they were an in game item
---
We need either AmmoPoints or Ammo scrap.
---
All robots can(since they got a personal nuclear reactor) If you damage them alot without killing them, they will start to burn, after a while, they explotes (sentry bots always explotes if i recall well, but all the stuff they drop isnt affected, so just wait a while until they explote)
---
Yes I’d play more if I could grind stuff
---
If you are the group leader, open the map, hit the button that brings up the team/leave world screen. The first item should say "New public team goal" or something similar. Hit that and you can change the team type to whatever you want.
---
Edited title
---
I can confirm this is true. I logged onto my lazy friend's character today after the atom shop update, claimed all his rewards and added a skin to his backpack just to be absolutely certain it worked.
---
&gt;I do believe zenimax has gone mad with power .. This game is rated M .. how can we not use adult language? 
---
Seriously?  This is standard practice in probably every single professionally developed game out there.  I mean for fuck sake, even in games with profanity filters it's standard practice to suspend or ban people if someone else turns off said filter and complains that someone swore at them.
---
Why do people always treat the shit Bethesda does as if they've just invented some nefarious new thing?
---
I’m going to buy all of season 2 anyway and afterwards complain about content drought. /s
---
From my experience, lower damage faster deteriorating condition, things have higher energy res than ballistic. Was a nice fix though that anti armor effects actually work on them now, that helped alot.
---
Dude 75% of the content for Fo76 has been shit imported from previous titles or lazy half assed weapon/armor/pa recolors. The skins so far consist of a solid color/s slapped on a skin. This can be done on a pallet in mins and I can make them look better in 15min given access to the files and modding.
---
Last time that happened to me I only had to do the creating and registering of the biometric ID card.  Once I did that I could go right to the end and launch the nuke.
---
I like the items in the atomic shop, the prices were a little high at times but it was manageable. I loved grinding out daily weekly and world challenges and whatnot for atoms to get a new hat or outfit or camp item, gave the game life for me. Eventually I finished almost all the world challenges, Then they took away daily and weekly atoms for this stupid score shite... now there’s basically no way to get free atoms anymore, thus the prices are no longer justified on the atomic shop stuff. And that was a scummy move on Bethesda’s part. I get it’s an online service and they release free updates so they gotta have some kinda income coming in... But goddamn give us *some* way to make some free micro transaction currency. Give us repeatable Combat challenges or something, I’d trek across the map and kill 1000 blood eagles or 2000 scorched for 40 atoms. Hell that actually sounds fun. 
---
Other games like Fate Grand Order give out their micro transaction currency daily in the form of a present box on the main menu as a show of good will towards their players, a little something for the players who can’t afford to drop money on the game to save for something they really want, gives them a reason to log in daily. And they still make money off of gem sales.
---
(I’ve got Fallout 1st and even with that free 1650 atoms on the 5th of every month its still pretty rough... Wanted that new drifter outfit but it’s 900 atoms out of the 1765 I have, I just can’t justify spending half my atoms on a new outfit now. And I just can’t afford to buy atoms... Not when I’m already paying 100$ a year for 1st and another 50$ for PSN.)
---
Building bullion weapons, certain bullion armors and bullion power armor.
---
It said pm.. I kinda feel jilted we gotta wait a whole damn week to start next one.
---
Thanks for the summary
---
Serious question. Who actually finds it fun to grind challenges for literally pennies worth of atoms?
---
They removed the atom challenges so people will buy fallout 1st. It’s the only way to get atoms now.
---
I'm at the purveyor and the prices are the same.  The same starts in 2 days
---
 Sept 10-14 for those that are linkaphobic.
---
It’s hilarious to me that the community is generally in an uproar about any “exploit” except this one.
---
Have they fixed the grognak emote yet? it shows in the atomic shop but doesn’t show in the emote wheel even when equipped.
---
I hear a piano.  [https://youtu.be/7d8lg2dSlME](https://youtu.be/7d8lg2dSlME)

---
What I like about it most is that it retroactively makes the Jet Pack mod I've been running with in Fallout 4 for years lore friendly if not outright canonical.
---
I love the armor that problem for me is that bos combat armor has much higher protection and gives me a sweet look as the best thing the steath suit gave me was rad protection

Still bought it despite having floors

If your post is not about making a trade, please [message the subreddit moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
The alternative they want is that they get everything for free and Bethesda continues to fund the game off of sunshine and well wishes.
---
When the game came out they were flat out up front about the fact that it would be supported through cosmetic microtransactions and yet years later people are still OUTRAGED that they're expected to pay for cosmetics using actual money and not Bethesda Fun Bucks.
---
I think 40mm and missiles should work as frag grenades, we should be able to make them go "live" manually, like they do with explosives in Saving Private Ryan.
---
Well to be fair I thought he was just looking for the pieces to make a launch code and was letting him know that he could use nuka-crypt to get the codes.
---
Isn't the greenhouse a reward is season 2
---
Or is that something different
---
So you haven't tried full unyielding, try it not.
---
I love how our character pulls out a microphone from our asses and taps it as it just fecking implodes
---
Get rid of this battlepass bullshit. Its garbage. Its pointless.
---
Awesome, I'm looking forward to a fat stack of ghoul slayer's broadsiders and nocturnal gamma guns.
---
More story, less atomic shop. Wastelanders was great but, fallout could be so much more.
---
Can a teammate build it in your CAMP? I know it's not optimal, but if it might work as a stopgap of sorts.
---
I think that's a new one.
---
Can’t built atomic items unfortunately
---
It seriously should
---
[](/cc_sad)I would play more for a while, but then I'd run out of what little content there is left, and then quit. It's not what you want to hear, but there's real science behind the annoying time gating systems that shows it's got the highest odds of keeping us coming back.  
---
Zinga pioneered it with farmville, and nearly took over gaming with it. Now any live service game has to play by the unethical rules, or face death.
---
You should have known they'd still be monetizing the game because at the same exact time they were telling everyone about the free dlc they were also telling them there would be a cosmetics cash shop to pay for that free dlc... they never hid any of this shit.
---
My bloodied explosive fixer broke so fast, a friend gave it back to me. It's fun until it starts falling apart in the midst of the fight. 
---
If you can afford it, just equip Gunsmith after repairing the weapon to 200 percent. It makes a big difference.
---
*"Never before has any voice uttered the words of that tongue here in Imladris!"*
---
It would be nice if camps had a player rating. Just a - or + next to the camp when hovering. None the less that's not a goodie bag I would want to come home to.!
---
Also all Legendary robots will explode upon death regardless of how they are killed.
---
All legacy plasma are hacked weapons.
---
Unless it's a gatling.
---
Hmm, I should've tried that before rage quitting to another server. 😂😂
---
It’s probably just a reminder of TOS. The same as they’ve always been I assume. It’s basically every games TOS. Don’t be an ass don’t hack and cheat. It’s simple
---
Naw, OP is just shitting their pants.
---
You sound like a mega twat.
---
Some games have engaging content, others are glorified slot machines.  It's fucking sad that Bethesda has driven the franchise to the latter.
---
“It has been 25 minutes. The 3* legendary a scortchbeast is still in the air. My shotgun broke. I am out of ammo. I am wearing sunglasses”
---
The problem started on Friday actually, so I even gave them some time to accrue atoms to my account. Btw don’t know anything about a holiday, I’m from Russia
---
Gives people who *can* log in daily incentive to keep logging in though, which presumably is a metric Bethesda wants. 
---
I cant see Todd hurting daily login numbers to let folks log in 1x a week for the same result.
---
Gunsmith Rank 5 is non-optional in my book. I have 15 INT for the XP buff, so it’s an easy choice.
---
I do it here and there, if I'm already next to it by chance or if I need to knock out a challenge event.
---
That is a fact! I almost didn't finish, but I spent a lot of time just learning the game, so there were many days I didn't get the main dailies completed. I was able to make up for it over the last week with the double points.
---
Most of the dailies didnt even seem like that big of a grind for me either, and I am looking forward to Season 2.
---
People getting burnt out on boring daily grinds losing total players to trade for daily log in doesn't make sense to me.
---
In my opinion, most successful games have been able to follow the most important tenets of B.F. Skinner's work in positive reinforcement. This is creating a Skinner's box(video game) of positive reinforcement cycles that are variable(random levels of awesome, like random drops or loot boxes), and/or work to decrease reinforcement over time(more exp per level, longer, harder boss fights etc). Skyrim and Diablo 2 hit these pretty perfectly. FO 76 had so many parts done well, but started to waiver near the end game
---
Also I'm not sure why everyone thinks people woudo suddenly only log in once a week no one's forcing you to do it in one day.
---
At this point, the scrip/bullion/possum badge/(insert number counter)/and new atom shop stuff is the only reason I keep logging on, since I'm waiting for new content to drop.
---
Back in early 2019, when they didn't have new content or scrip or bullion and I ran out of quests, I simply stopped playing. Didn't log back on again for months and didn't seriously start playing the game again until Wastelanders.
---
There was nothing to grind since I had all the TSE stuff (old school meta) I needed already.
---
That's what I was referring to ofc
---
Legacy gatling plasma
---
Everyone would have also wasted their nuke cards without nukacrypt. The last time this happened was because Bethesda messed something up. Direct your displeasure at them.
---
Yeah, they can add a "pyromaniac" perk card set to buff fire damages.
---
I was just looking at a flamer I got and thinking that the damage and fire rate are actually pretty decent, and the range is way higher than I'd thought.
---
Scum tactic for sure, they know exactly what they're doing and getting away with it anyways.
---
I've noticed that quests will pop up for a bit and then nothing for a time. Why? No idea. But it's been that way since I remember. 
---
As for the servers, it's probably player fatigue and the fact that things are opening up again, people are returning to work, and in turn having less time to play. 
---
If you're getting bored, take a break. 
---
If you have the itch to keep playing but don't know what to do. Try building a cool camp, or hunting out items, finishing up quests you may still have left to do. The Mistress of Mystery quests are some of the best in game and are often missed.
---
They probably don’t have access to it. But broadly speaking, Fallout isn’t really about criticising China or communism, it’s more a satire of fanatical Cold War militarism from both sides.
---
It's just general corporate failsafes. More of a deterrent if you may. They're not going to do anything, but if anything serious came to the light of day, then they are covered with their ToS. The likelihood that anything serious would ever come from talk about politics is incredibly slim. However, they need it to cover their ass if such occurrences were to happen.
---
Then we'd just have people crying about their framerates if you use them during effects.
---
It may work, but it's a piss-poor business decision to make your customers feel miserable.  The negative mosaic these decisions create in the minds of consumers will eventually bite them in the ass.
---
Example:  Bungie used to be one of my favorite developers.  Then Destiny happened, and me and my friends say "fuck Bungie" now.
---
If you like it, roll with it.  Play the game how you want to.
---
I agree with using weapon artisan to repair 200%, I also bring repair kits and extra guns. I don't use gunsmith, that could help, but I prefer to use nerd rage and demo expert.
---
Yeah that's what I'm thinking.  Hopefully the info helps someone in the future though. =D
---
Thank you, I certainly try.
---
I came back after a break from the game last night and bought a couple of the things in the communist bunker set (the fence &amp; whatever other thing is in it) from the Atom shop, then during my first play session back I kinda liked the look of the bunker so I bought it through the camp system. Stupid motherfuckers decided to sell me the whole set instead of just the bunker like I was hovering over, immediately deleted the game and got a refund on my 1st. Definitely not letting these sorry ass “developers” waste more of my time &amp; money.
---
They did in Fallout 4 but not in 76. In 4 the different pieces of workout equipment gave different temporary SPECIAL boosts.
---
I remembered the very first time I solo’d Earl I was in that little square you drop down in because his big dumb arse couldn’t fit and I could jump to avoid his loogie attack. (Basically just like the Rock at the Terramorpheous raid boss fight in Borderlands 2.)
---
Killed him, immediately died to rubble falling on me, didn’t get to loot him. Lesson? F*ck that spot, stand literally anywhere else that isn’t covered in acid or on fire.
---
Imagine if there were guns in cod that couldn’t have a skin. Its not like any of the games skins are even great or mediocre.
---
I have a bed, four vending machines, three crafting stations and the computer for the astronaut, plus some stash containers and a generator, all packed inside the bunker. It is my camp: I need nothing else and it feels super realistic. I love it. 
---
The trick is to know that you can get the floating bug (some items seem to hover) and to know that certain terrains are better than others. But if you do things right and take your time, you'll be satisfied. A rug can stop the floating, for example. A small generator fits inside and makes your camp visible on the map: you need only that one.
---
Only sure thing is: if you decide to move camp, remove everything from inside, so the machines get blueprinted. Don't try to place the whole thing because you'll get the "can't place" bug, and will be forced to dismantle everything.
---
If you're on PC, there's backpack reskin mods, some that include making them invisible (only to you of course).

\#7 - I call shenanigans! I missed 3 weeks and maybe a couple of days; at first I didn't do the NW ones, but after a couple of weeks realized I needed to do the NW items and I had to use caps to finish the map. I did every SCORE item every day for the remainder of the season and was still 12 spaces short of completing.

I'm not sure why our experiences are so different, but I found there is some urgency when it comes to completing these tasks. Well, there was. It seems they tweaked the weeklies and dailies so things might be different this time.
---
RIP AND BRRRRRRRR UNTIL IT IS DONE
---
I've been loving the jet pack. The only downside is dying from fall damage. Usually I can hit the jet again before I land to slow down, but if there's any lag I'm dead.
---
I haven't rolled any fall damage ss armor yet btw.
---
Yea, perhaps ive been lucky and not ran into them as much, I usually run 4 to 5 silos a week. luckily I can host a server as well, so just gotta convince him to give it another try.
---
Much appreciated for the offer!
---
Oh man, I forgot all about my gauss miniguns!  I can finally use those as well!
---
Now if only Bethesda would release a new drum mod for the LMG that increased it's clip size to 1000 rounds
---
pretty sure
---
Are officers spawning at all? (since the quest itself doesn't work, was hoping the code devices wouldn't be flagged as a quest item and allow it to be displayed :p)
---
Go forth and reload every 3 seconds!
---
 pretty soft if you give up after one try. guess the wasteland's not for everyone even if they do sell it for consoles
---
Yeah even with all Rad perks and rad resist effects SS armour isn't quite good enough for nuke zone yet, so Stealth Suit is the best hazmat suit for non PA users by far. New legendary perks (What Rads) might change this, though I think it's still quite early to say.
---
For everywhere else, you lose out on 15 stars of legendary effects, a whole lotta dr and the ability to wear clothes and underarmour :/
---
It's been known for 5 years now since FO4 released.
---
How mysterious. Bethesda marketing team came through after all ;)
---
Im not sure, Would have to hop a whole bunch to try to find one by chance.
---
Plasma actually gets away with it a bit due to the damage split. So the ballistic portion at least works as intended.
---
Pure energy damage though? Complete and total garbage.
---
well, i guess not everyone can be as cool as you, I bet if you were in his shoes, you would have thanked the high levels, for taking the reward after you did all the work lol
---
New codes don’t work in alpha
---
I have a two shot LMG that I might try out.  I figure the tight quarters of the Daily Ops might be the perfect use for it.
---
Doesn't seem like they're spawning at all, my hopes have been dashed.
---
Well it's not just the microtransactions.  That's only part of it.   My concern with it is that it is becoming a common feature in online games.  The basic formula is 
---
1. Build in road blocks that inhibit game play 
---
2. Charge money to get rid of road blocks 
---
In the case of Fallout 76, the road block is limited storage space for crafting components. They sell you the fix with Fallout 1st. 
---
With other games, the road block is painfully slow leveling.  Those games sell you a fix in the form of XP boosters. 
---
And there's also the issue of time gated content. The time gated content feels like a form of extortion.  Your choices are to play the game every single day, seven days a week, or miss out on rewards.   The way around missing out, or course, is to shell out money. 
---
The problem is not just with this game having micro transactions. The problem is with what appears to be a disturbing trend in gaming.
---
Leave on bed: a single waste oil and a single rubber.
---
I managed to finish Season one with a week to spare even after taking a few weeks off and I only spent the caps that I would receive as rewards to advance.
---
I love the photography aspect. I run all the nice stuff through Lightroom and throw it in my online gallery LOL
---
Gathering scrap is non XP... exploring, though I think you get XP for unlocking stuff on the map.
---
Start a 2nd character to play by yourself, then play with your friend with this character.
---
Instigating was, is and will be great, depending on the weapon and the role you play. A rifleman with an instigating lever can oneshoot the wendigos in the mine, the scorched in Line in the Sand, the ghouls in Violent Night and 90 percent of the enemies in the game. My Instigating Western revolver does the same and looks cool, etc. Add Tormentor and whatever you didn't oneshoot, you crippled. 
---
Will it be great for PvPing Bloodied Unyielding Commandos? Well, no. But who cares? PvP is all about Teslas, magic weapons and a belly full of Quantum.
---
When I actually reported someone for being a full on racist with evidence, they didn't even bother to review it and closed the case without any response after like two months. So very unlikely you will be banned for some 'adult language' or bad behavior.
---
Reminds me of those things in Destiny 2, which iirc were fun as hell to use.
---
Thats probably not what their metrics say regarding retention. You gave your example on what behavior makes you not want to stay, while Im suggesting i feel differently. Clearly, this isn't a one solution fits all matter.
---
Remember, they have the actual numbers and the science behind their decision making.
---
One is likely the lesser evil, for them. If they will lose some people no matter what, new factors come in such as spending habits of the two different groups etc. You know what I mean.
---
Having to do dailies everyday is bullshit. I haven't played in a month with no energy too
---
You can't always tell if someone is in a silo, especially if the people that upped into your space went through the wall to save time. 
---
Sorry about your run though
---
Where do you get the raider collectron?
---
Hah that's so awesome!
---
What was their name? Sometimes some of the big streamers do stuff like this for content... other times it's just good Samaritans helping out.
---
SBQ fight: Hey I'll just do a little boost juHOLY FUCK I'M IN SPACE
---
I missed a few weeks of season 1 and still got to the 90’s without even trying to actively complete the quests.
---
I got the chicken coop so I’m happy
---
Depends entirely on what you plan to do with your character.
---
Not sure where your camp is but probably just leave it there and move and reset it once you're better acquainted with the game. 
---
Main quest and explore are probably your best bets. The end game doesn't start till around level 50 which is when you should be done with the wastelanders quests. 
---
Perks and builds before level 50 genuinely kind of just do not matter. There are some perks that you should get and Google is your best friend here.
---
However as far as what weapons and builds to use that depends entirely on your play style. More importantly if you are here for the late game it is gonna depend entirely on your luck in what weapon you get. 
---
Tldr; you'll probably have more fun if you do what you want to do and not worry about late game. 
---
There's a patch coming soon that will make the game easier for someone low level like you. I think its supposed to drop this month.
---
Stinging gets the best of all worlds.
---
Best I got was a troubleshooter
---
Yeah, seriously, these things will drop regardless of what is donated. You folks need to stop wasting your scrap. I've donated zip, zero, zilch an still got the cheesy cosmetics. Don't bother.
---
Happy cake day
---
If we could use them as decorations in our houses, I would totally keep them...  They look far cooler than they function.
---
I’d suggest sitting on the keypad. That way they can’t enter the code and steal your launch.
---
Worst case, they waste their nuke card while you laugh.
---
The second set of codes works
---
Seriously, nothing pisses me off more then obscure vendors especially un an ungly unimaginative dump of a camp.
---
Are you on xbox or ps4 by chance?
---
Find a Chef’s hat in the Diner’s kitchen in Summerville
---
No. Ask them to re-enable legendary run for a few more days as that seems to be the trend nowadays. We got people demanding re-release of BOS themed rewards everywhere lol so why not legendary run
---
Yes. Launched all three silos
---
Yeah it always happens to me with Earle. Must be a lot of mischievous ghost miners down in that hole.
---
Not yet
---
Use a 40mm grenade launcher. It will tag everything, but won't kill anything.
---
Yeah it seems to have broken completely on PC and xbox still has last weeks codes.
---
Honestly, even if you dropped it on Earle, it would have been a waste. You would’ve had 2 other people show up to the event and would’ve wasted even more ammo just to mutate it with 10 minutes left to kill. That event is dead. Bethesda fucked it up by giving bullshit pick axes, shovels and harpoons as rewards for killing the hardest boss currently in the game. Event is a joke.
---
Yeah, I just buy stuff. Work on my plan collection, get some of those plans I dont ever want, but still don't have. Buy gold bullion from Smiley. Buy a ton of ammo. Give some to another player as a random act of kindness. Anything to not lose it to the void LOL
---
Whenever I get aroudn 25K or so, I go blow some. I try to stay between 20-25Kish at any given time.
---
For me it’s a matter of what at some point each day the game becomes pointless to play. There’s no quests I’m interested in doing. No real way to work towards specific gear because rng on rng on rng. The npcs are embarrassingly flat and with less life than oblivion so I can’t even just rp. After a while I just find myself standing around waiting for a nice event to pop and get bored and quit which sucks because I want to continue playing but there’s nothing to do for that day
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
It's hard to find plans that people need anymore. The ones people still buy are event drop plans, drug recipes, weapon plans and alcohol recipes. I think I might be the only one still visiting Biv.
---
I sell everything cheap though, plans doubly so. 
---
Several times recently, I've had players over level 100 stop by and buy piles of crappy plans. I can't figure it out; they're over 100 but they don't have brahmin pen or lion statues?
---
If I see anyone in a silo I wait. If they don’t launch within 30 minutes, I go to a different silo and launch. I’m not gonna steal someone else’s nuke but if you’re taking too long that’s another story. On the flip side, check out some silo speed runs from Angry Turtle on YouTube. I’m not trying to bum anyone out but silos only take about 10 minutes if you know the way. 
---
BUT MAN!!! I’ll never forget my first time in a silo way back at level 30 something. Back before the door glitches... me and my friend got rocked for about 30 straight minutes. Finally got to the last room and I got dashboarded. Talk about rage quit. Nowadays, running a silo is a miner inconvenience to trigger an event. 
---
Sorry your nuke got stolen, if you’re on Xbox I’ll give you guys a card and take you through it. I promise it’s no harder than going from one end of Watoga to the other.
---
Wonderful....
---
I’ve made this mistake a couple of times, the problem is sometime you don’t realise it’s part of a bundle until it comes out and you’re like why do I own half of this.
---
That's crappy
---
Welcome to the space program.
---
correct. 'cool' is a relative description, like 'tall'. If everyone were as cool as me, then none of us would be cool. I don't know what kind of shoes your dad wears, but if he gets frustrated enough to quit after one silo run this is probably not the game for him. there are so many bugs and weird ideosyncracies maybe time is best spent elsewhere, as he would seem to agree.
---
I don’t remember, to be honest. It would be really funny if they were a streamer though!🤣
---
I wasn't talking about it as if it was something newly uncovered. Just mentioned I saw the post about this exact bug on the pts forums where it's meant to be seen by devs.
---
I miss the stark devastation of the capital wasteland.
---
New Vegas was easily a better game (parched...including community patches) but
---
It lacked the post apocalyptic feel of FO3 (and before anyone says anything I KNOW the fallout series has always been about post POST apocalyptic civilisation).
---
Then 4 just didn’t capture it the same as three did...and it was made worse by the settlement system being continually thrust in your face like it was duffman’s pelvis.  Boston was okay... ish, but a bit too intact for me.  The glowing sea was pretty damn cool but was so destroyed it went too far the other way almost.  
---
I want some of that vibe back in a new area, even if it is part of the capital wasteland, or the pit before it was the pit.
---
Only if I'm fighting the Predator in the jungle.
---
They honestly should have something similar running around, causing mayhem.
---
Hahaha oh man I love this.
---
It ended at 12 est today, it didn't run the whole day
---
Yup but monetizing DLC overall is more consumer friendly then cosmetic so that why I was against it and still am
---
Am I the only one that feels like this person will soon be posting a good bye post. Good bye in advance. Lol
---
Edit: oh and happy cake day
---
Fuck sakes
---
Toddsquatch?
---
One of the best missions in Ghost Recon Wildlands imo.
---
They even got the music score for the fight scene. Classic move by the Devs.
---
Or just add a different mode like Team Deathmatch that gives experience as well for the people who absolutely hate BR.
---
I run all my power on the roof where you can't really see them, and toss a generator somewhere out of the way too (roof often). I make sure each square of roof has a conduit on it and all wired up, this lets everything inside receive power without having to mess with conduit pipes or other stuff inside. no wires inside.
---
If you're building a more conventional home, most roof lines are taller than your line of sight, so if you place the conduits on the roof just right, you won't see anything from the ground, and it looks clean.  This is all on a single story home.
---
If ur PS4 I’ll help carry you through so you don’t blow any anmo
---
Well, I personally don't care if they ban my 1900h+ acc for mod usage. The game is literally unplayable for me without some of the QoL ones and I use literal sh*t ton of textures I made and several ones from other authors to make the game look less ugly/more bearable.
---
!remindme 8 hours
---
Lol no trust me not going anywhere. I have a soft spot for troubled games. If anything it won’t be the game shortcomings that cause me to leave but another taking my interest more which if marvels avengers or wasteland 3 ever decides to not constantly crash may be it.
---
I'll keep that in mind, now im bummed I didn't even think of that lol
---
Mk, the added a no mice emote
---
Has anyone around here heard any beeps
---
Tbh most of the stuff that mattered in TLR you will be able to buy with gold in the next update so just wait i guess. Sucks that happened to you dude.
---
Where can I find the old codes?
---
Ah ok that's good to hear. This reddit is already flooded with post like those.
---
Then what would be the point of the weapons themselves? And you couldn’t make them deal less damage, it wouldn’t make any sense. Plus I don’t think anyone can throw a 6 pound mini nuke or 3x 2 pound missiles
---
Working on a theory here: did you side with the raiders?
---
I second this, if you’re on PS4 I would be glad to play with you and your dad. DtotheR0CK88
---
Perhaps, tho TBH, i like the earle fight better than the queen. Cuz damn, that queen never seems to land lol.
---
At least Earle is newer. either way in the circumstance, its wasted!
---
Kinda wanted the 100 tier stuff. Waste of time grinding out all them boring ass dailies and stuff. I ain't playing the next season.
---
U know what madness is?
---
Trying to nuke and kill the sbq in the first months after release, knowing that you will get 100% a client crash and no one will be able to loot anything... and still doing that a dozen times each day.
---
And yet you still play their games despite saying that. If you don't, you're in the minority
---
you can tell when someone is standing in front of you yelling at you to stop lol :D
---
I mean I think those posts are just people’s way of venting. It’s healthy. Only game I ever really said goodbye was Sekiro. It was absolutely not the game I wanted from Sekiro. And even then I didn’t tell people on reddit I just deleted the game and never looked back lol
---
It definitely goes along way and other games I play are doing it (Dead by Daylight), but eh.. I Dunno. It's camouflages the fact these games are getting boring and I think I will probably move on whether or not I "miss out" on something.
---
Don’t launch nukes on Tuesdays. The codes are resetting. It’s been taking longer for some reason. And they keep changing the time and day they reset. Originally they reset on Mondays I think, then they moved it to Tuesdays, and at first I think they were noon on Tuesdays with the atom shop updates and now I believe it’s 8pm Tuesdays. So I’ve given up on launching nukes on Tuesdays all together since nukacrypt can’t even keep up with it (which isn’t their fault). Before anyone else says it, make sure you’re using the right code for the right silo also. I know I’ve wasted a few key cards putting in codes for alpha while standing in Charlie. 
---
Private servers are rehashed public servers so they need maintenance too. Personally I’ve found that private servers go down for maintenance more often than public ones because they’re public servers that aren’t in use (with exception of the people using them). That’s the layman way of putting it and even then I’m sure someone on here will downvote and say I’m totally wrong. 
---
I, and a few my friends, have all (and I mean ALL)the wall papers unlocked in the build menu despite the fact that we each only have a handful from the atom shop. However in the atom shop some of them are not even available for purchase, and the ones that are available are ones that we don’t own, but can use. So I’ll take it as a freebie and won’t mention it to the Beth.
---
The other day, I was at charlie and I'd just completed launch prep when I heard shooting. I looked on the map and two players had just come in. A 54 and a 98, I'm like "oh, I get to help someone pop their cherry!"
---
I'm always crouched so they wouldn't have seen me on the map. I head back to go team up with them, and when I stand up to day hi, *blam*...I'd forgotten that all the assaultrons respawned! 
---
Long story short, I never got to team up with them, they launched centered over the wrong fissure site! Missed the SBQ entirely!
---
You know what’s even better than all these emotes on everyone’s wish list that helps helps facilitate communication?
---
An actual in game chat window.
---
Trust me you aren't loseing anything it's very anti-climatic the only good thing from it is the 500 atoms.
---
Didn't knew the gun accuracy effect is a thing
---
Does actually boosting your luck as insanely as you can make any difference when rolling?
---
They unban people with MIRV miniguns, binocular rifles, and beam splitter .50 cals. Their TOS holds as much value as used toilet paper
---
I honestly feel pipe weapons are slept on
---
If we can add a rocket to a sledgehammer, a missile to a stick seems EZ!
---
This isn't for you dumbass
---
Nothing to do with fallout or bethesda in particular. They changed something for eso.
---
It's less about nerfing things and more about making it easier to balance them in the future. While I don't like that already weak weapons are going to be even more lackluster, ability for them to more easily adjust things without outright breaking them will be good.
---
That's why you have your main do all the easy ones, and have a low level alt doing the level ups.
---
I really really want to like 2shot weapons, but the damage nerf and the accuracy nerf from the originals coupled with the faster condition decrease makes me avoid them like the plague.
---
That sucks. Tip, either craft a Chinese stealth armor or grab one of the many hazmat suits and put in your favorites wheel. Soon as you step outside, or just before, put it on via favorites wheel. Saves you the time of pulling up your pip-boy and scrolling to the item, could be life and junk saving
---
Nukes, 40mm and Missiles are great for the ammo converter.  Not the highest for points but on a Saturday or Sunday of a long session, I can add 3-4K points (thanks BGS for lifting the cap, try scrip next ).  Since I use Ultracite ammo 90% of the time I spin all 5mm, .50 and 5.56 with it and it sells off quick.  
---
If you vend and want caps and people showing up, stock decent 3* weapons/armor, a few k in those three ammo types, save all the shotgun shells and plasma carts until you have 250-500 and roll those in.  Toss in some chems and serums and you got business all day clearing your machines.
---
The tos are generally from zenimax for all their games.
---
Introvert here - I now join a team immediately on login, events usually, for xp boost. Allowed me to use different perks besides lone wanderer, and people share perks :)
---
I didn’t have to talk to anybody.
---
Frodo was drafted.  Sam volunteered
---
"Have a nice day...."
---
Go to settings, audio, set chat mode to team, area, or off, and turn off push to talk. Have a good mic. I thought I had a good one, but all anyone ever hears is static.
---
I’d so trap it with nukanades and rad emitters
---
Our encounters with him are bad and everyone hates him.
---
That's what I was saying if I came across this I would think it was legit it just fits right in, perfectly balanced and not over powered at all.
---
Swarm of Suitors will get a ton of mirelurk meat of various types.
---
Black Bear Lodge hunting event usually pinpoints a few locations with lots of herds of things to kill.
---
Gulper Lagoon has slurry and other stuff.
---
path of enlightment has lots of radtoad meat (I think?, forgot what all they drop)
---
Hopewell/deathclaw island/abandoned junkyard/4th spot i forget all have guaranteed deathclaws for various stuff, plus eggs
---
leader of the pack event has tons of wolves to kill for meat.
---
Doesn't really matter. These events will complete regardless. Complete waste of time, dont bother.
---
Will cross post this for every upcomming "I want this back" post here on this sub.
---
What DMV stands for?
---
The upcoming 'Daily Ops' enemies can always see you, the strong chameleon effect of the stealth suit is entirely negated. I highly suggest something with more Damage Resistance even if it's just for running daily ops
---
Sent you an invite mate.
---
I’m literally starting a new character just run a full explosives build to use all these things.
---
If you want to hit in the 1000's on the queen you need to fight her at night, use the mister Sandown trick to get 3.75x multipliers use revenant in endurance to get 50% extra damage with either a friend or some lifesaving armour to revive you then switch back to full unyielding. Watch captain noob and tyrs speed runs they both employ these methods.
---
I do the same and hit in the 1000's, just do it before the 15th when damage is going to be greatly reduced.
---
Or you know... Buff explosives
---
I dig it!

War has changed.
---
It's no longer about nations, ideologies, or ethnicity. It's an endless series of proxy battles, fought by mercenaries and machines.
---
War--and it's consumption of life--has become a well-oiled machine.
---
ID-tagged soldiers carry ID-tagged weapons, use ID-tagged gear. Nanomachines inside their bodies enhance and regulate their abilities.
---
Genetic control, information control, emotion control, battlefield control…everything is monitored and kept under control.
---
War…has changed.
---
The age of deterrence has become the age of control, all in the name of averting catastrophe from weapons of mass destruction, and he who controls the battlefield, controls history.
---
When the battlefield is under total control, war becomes routine.
---
If I don't like particular cosmetics or I don't have the money to buy them then I can entirely ignore them and be no worse off.  If a new expansion comes out and you can't afford it then you're fucked, if you dno't like certain parts of it it's not like you can go ala carte and if you try to opt out of it then you're missing out on all related content that comes out over the following months.
---
Very sound advice. Well phrased and thought out.
---
76 is very finicky about Win10 sound settings as well, at least in regards as what is set to default &amp; when you change it. Changes made when the game is running are ignored until it's restarted. You'll probably want to verify in sound settings everything is working for sanity before using it in game.
---
No other game that I've installed on pc basically ever has been this stringent.
---
So looks like it's only specific servers that are broke. Like my private server is broke, but i went on a public server and the panels are all green and the quest works. Was also able to retrieve a code piece after activating the quest. Returning to my private server, the code piece disappeared.
---
Yeah, start new. It's a COMPLETELY different game since launch... for the better!
---
I want a function that allows to me “favorite” locations that like to frequent. Maybe they show up a different color on the map or I can quick access them from my pipboy.
---
Go bloodied and your stealth crit headshots should do like 700 damage, no chems or aids. 2 mags to mutate her and 3\~4 more to kill her. This is without any chems or aids or buffs. And people are wondering why Bethesda is nerfing damage
---
I finished on Sunday evening.  There were times, I didn't think I'd come close - especially during days that auto-completed.  The double xp and bonus challenges toward the end definitely helped.
---
Love it, always wanted to fish

Bro thank you.

---
Lol show us on the doll where the big mean game touched you.
---
Right as I start the run out to exit I slam diluted rax and two non diluted radaways.
---
This gives me enough breathing room to get my stealth armor on.
---
Then I just run to the end of the nuke zone, switch back, and kiss the edge till I get back to 81% rads.
---
Or...if someone center dropped it on the mine, i just go back to camp and love myself with the gamma gun.
---
One of my buddies has a similar thing with his grenade launcher I believe, it fires two shots occasionally. Might be a lag problem
---
Yeah can't wait to repair 3 weapons and claim workshops again. Boring af

The guy in PA in fallout 3 is on the left not the right but over all nice pic

A bug that will fix itself eventually. I came back the next day, toggled active, and cleared it.

Day 1 though all my waste became invisible when I got close to it.
---
Upcoming patch notes: 3\* legendary accessories have been introduced and can be found across the map
---
This is a bad story and I feel for you and your dad. Though without Bethesda doing anything, it's just not going to change.
---
If you feel it's warranted, you might want to consider letting Bethesda know that you're cancelling your Fallout 1st sub and not intend to renew it and encourage others to do the same until this issue is resolved. Sadly, it's the only way that Bethesda would even consider dealing with this issue as if they're not directly losing short term revenue, it's not a priority for them.
---
No one would use them when they could be using Fatman Lances. \^o  \^
---
ZENIMAX IS NOT ONLY IN CHARGE OF FALLOUT 76.
---
These tos are for all games of the company, mainly for elder scrolls online but also for wolfenstein, dishonored or any other game zenimax or any related company they own releases. 
---
to be clear, fallout isn't a big project at all for them, they mostly don't care about this game. Sorry if i sound rude, but reading the same stupid question over and over again makes me think you're all brainless fools.
---
If ur on xbox i can speedrun silo for you guys
---
Man im sorry what happened to you, i hope that doesnt happen to me and my friend when we launch our first nuke this week, i hope your father gets to launch his nuke though.
---
Soloing the SBQ is not as easy as the streamers make it look, even with a full meta Bloodied stealth commando build. It is possible however... Angryturtle did a no legendary, no mutation playthrough with a foodie build where he was able to solo her.. He did however use a power armor/melee setup, but if he was able to make that work you can probably make yours work as well. The RNG of the adds during the event plus how often she decides to land can make all the difference in world.
---
Yes, totally grind for it. We did the sheepsquach imposter event yesterday with a buddy who didn't have it and he got it on the first try. (this is the only place to get the Plan from, according to the Wiki)... unless you find it on someone's vendor.
---
They can be made semi-auto, fully auto, sniper, whatever your mood is. As others stated, they are stupid powerful if you get the right rolls.
---
Knowing the plan also allows for them to drop as rewards too, or just gamble for them at the purveyor.
---
I lucked out on the first try with a bloodied 3 star. Still not a god roll, but it does the job more than any other gun I have.
---
Before I got my Fixer, I ran an instigating lever action for about a year as my main weapon.
---
I really don't think pipe weapons should be on par with other weapons like handmades or assault rifles even
---
Best to start over again. Everything has changed so even your perk and special selections you may want to redo.
---
Aside from that follow the main quest but take it real slow and do all the side quests that you come across in the Forest. It'll give you more in terms of gameplay, story and lore but also modifies your pace so you're at about the right level to take on later quests on the main quest line without hitting a level/difficulty wall.
---
Which are always exorbitantly overpriced....
---
Doesn't work if they have already entered the code for that silo for the week.
---
I've made the gauss shotgun and minigun and haven't needed them which is why I was curious.
---
With the legendary rad perk coming soon, if u max it out and u have ss armor you can most definitely go into nuke zones w it
---
God I love jetpacking during

Meat week, SBQ and line in The sand those events if you time it right the lag and send you shoting up into the sky, I have been able to get on top of the building during line in the sand due to this little trick.
---
The invisible wall to that building is so tall! Whenever the enemies all drop in one group is the best time to fly I've noticed.
---
Man! I knew i lost my ring somewhere. Send me your gamer tag so i can get it back please. My wife will kill me if she finds out.
---
I just keep telling myself "just fo76 things" and hoping it's fixed the next time I go on.
---
Didn't work for PS4
---
Def minigun, ammo is far easier to come by/craft
---
Just came from a server with a nuke zone. Which codes are working. From other comments only bravos old code?
---
I always leave mine unlocked. I feel like it's a common courtesy and a thank you for checking out the vending machines.
---
I don't even drink purified water anymore. I solely drink inert flux. It's easier to farm, weighs less, and gives you a disease resistant buff.
---
Change your stock to forceful or precise. Only one point less accurate than aligned stock.
---
I wish I was on pc for things like that but im ps4. Thanks for the heads up!
---
If you wanna launch nukes or be able to get secret service armor, then i suggest you just do the quests, because they also give decent xp
---
Thank you so much I really appreciate you taking the time. ❤️❤️❤️
---
Why anything in the Atomic Shop is time gated is beyond me.  We should be able to purchase any item that was in the Atomic Shop whenever we want.
---
Who would throw away this used toilet paper was it you!?
---
I lost my quest progress 3 times so I had to go through it 4 times just to get it done.
---
One time it loaded the foundations in on top of me and it pushed me under the map. I fell for a few seconds then landed back above ground on the camp floor and died.
---
Are you on pc if so I'll give y'all the ammo to run again
---
Do you play eso? I’ve been debating whether to buy it for like a year
---
We must be masochists
---
Yup. There seems to be another thread mentioning the same issue. Oh well. At least you were able to launch!
---
Legacy gatling plasmas, tsffr gamma guns, pretty much any auto tesla, and other junkies weapons
---
No problem, BTW, I was doing some more scrolling and trolling after I saw your post. Apparently there’s something weird going on with the nuke codes today. Either Bethesda didn’t reset them, or when the team at nukacrypt deciphered them the codes were incorrect. So it’s not just you or your fiancé. Apparently it’s everyone.
---
sadly, i believe that, even tho this instance sucked, Bethesda shouldn't change it, I feel like if they made the Silo's "instanced" where this wouldn't have happened, so many nukes will go off and crash the servers, or, you wont know if someone is ahead of you in another instance until you try to launch it.
---
even if they made it so that if someone is in a silo no one else can enter, that would cause way more problems with easy trolling. just go in and sit there so no one else can do it.
---
Oh most definately hahahaha
---
Well its one of our bigger holiday weekends.
---
I will definitely look for Angryturtles video. Thanks.
---
now, that story deserves a huuuge "Womp womp"
---
I have a blank holotape in one of my machines for 30k. Partly out of superstition about the rumor that someone can get items from your stash by emptying your machines, but also because it's just absurd.
---
Graphics dont change
---
I'm mute, guess I just get to not take part in social aspects of the game I guess? Which, you know, were a heavily advertised feature of the game originally...
---
Well I guess that nobody has competent dev teams then because in most online games with text chat muting one spammer just makes more room for the rest. Team/group/party conversation is the only sane option. I’d rather keep chat the way it is in 76. I can either use a mic in game and mute the shitty people or converse with my party through Xbox chat or discord. No need for a shitty text chat box.
---
thanks peeps, I'll run it by him, tho he tend to just want to play with me and my sister. but I'll hit ya up if I ever need assistance down the road :P I do plan on making a 5th character for the next season, incase we have the BS of having to level up every day!
---
How about a chat box!
---
Thanks. I was not aware.
---
Thank you. I agree. I was more thinking about the safari crocolossus plan. 😉
---
Mmm, stroke having are you, unreadable it is.
---
Just killed one about 20minutes ago. At foundation of all places.
---
Just use nukacrypt
---
I may consider bloodied if full health does not work. I tried once and there is a thin line between succeed and die every few seconds because i did not look enough at the health bar. Maybe it is just me idk.
---
Shit, I’m jealous. I wish I had things so easy my challenge was scrolling down slightly on a game map.
---
Some servers are running last weeks codes, so they spawn. Any newly spun up servers looks like they're broke (my private server is broke) The code device will disappear when joining a server where the codes are broke.
---
I was so upset they didnt give you the option to kill the clerks after the quest was over.
---
I really, really wanted too.
---
No but I'll try that, thanks.
---
Hey thats my ring!!!
---
Since im now married, the +1 strength i need for all the household chores.
---
My once so muscled arms which i used to call my weapons have lost 20% of their weight due to the lack of time to workout anymore. 
---
The extra 5% accuracy i need for the use of the vacuum cleaner.
---
Welcome to marriage. Thats my ring..

Id play this game more if it had less grind mechanics, and brought back raids or something like instanced dungeons. As it stands i love the game, but the current end game is a deal breaker for me.
---
Yeah wasn’t sure myself either but eventually did pull far enough. My GF wasn’t close but with the double tasks week and such she finished with a few days to spare
---
I actually much prefer the gattling laser. Super efficient to prime. Holds 1k round with power user. Extremely accurate. Very high rof. It's my go to weapon. And iv played with all ballistic heavys (as well as ult gat laser and flamers) with junkie faster fire rate.
---
You want the ultracite gattling laser though, it has a higher base damage
---
The Title says PS3 and I cannot for the life of me figure out how to change it. Lol. Just consider it silly.
---
The key is to place your actual camp unit in a safe place. I think many people are unaware that it dictates the fast travel location. I built on the highest mountain peak I could find, but I've never had it spawn me on the ground below.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
The thing is that it doesn't have to be instanced. There are a bunch of ways it can be managed without needing to get to that but still allow the person who ran the silo to complete it.
---
Launch could be tied to the person that put in the nuke card. Could be that there is an instance but there is only a singular one and anyone not tied to that instance or that team to that instance is locked out until either the nuke is launched or there's some event timer that runs out.
---
As a part of your anti troll measure, you could have it so that you could lock out a silo for a period of time but you can only do a run through that silo once. So yeah, good luck spending 2k or so just to waste your own time to prevent someone going into 1 of 3 silos.
---
The problem is you can't have your cake and eat it. Either you complain about the current system with the understand that it has flaws that need to change or that you keep the current system and your complaints fall on deaf ears because you want to keep things this way.
---
Pick a lane, cause don't change a thing and complain is just whinging and whining.
---
The fact that it took them that long to give their ol "pass it to the devs" line for a bug that's been obvious for that long is quite laughable.
---
Past 5 times I have put the card in: 
---
1st one everyone knew to wait and passed it rewarded with the Fixer plan;
---
2nd one someone with a level high enough to know better started it up with only 2 of us there and barely managed to pass rewarding mascot helmet; 
---
3rd one only 3 people showed up after waiting a while and passed rewarded with White Wolf Fedora; 
---
4th one plenty of people showed up right away but no one took pylons (I forgot to bring stimpaks or I would've) and we failed;
---
and last but not least, the 5th one were a level 52 started it up with only 3 of us there and the timer had only counted down a little over a minute. I was pissed so I just put up the angry and no emotes the whole time while drawing the Imposter towards the level 52 to let him burn multiple times. We did not pass.
---
Oh wait.
---
This dude high on chems
---
I guess there are 2 type of gamers 
---
I would prefer a service game with quality content and the only way that happens is with paid dlc.. 
---
You best believe if the “dlc” were monetize they wouldn’t get delayed as much as they would be priority over cosmetic
---
Don’t forget you can still have nice damage while also using some protective perks like fireproof and serendipity. Your bloody damage should still be high while you have a little survival skill.
---
If only my ocd wouldv kicked in sooner, no joke im diagnosed with ocd and i didnt compare the trailer to the picture i made. If i saw that sooner, in a heartbeat i wouldv made my character stand on the left😂😂
---
* the weapons have legendary effects and can properly fire the ammunition over greater distance
---
* thrown weapons can’t have their damaged buffed enough to compete against a legendary weapon that can fire it
---
* make it weaker and lighter to make it throwable 
---
* it’s a video game and all I’m suggesting is letting basically letting us craft re-skinned versions of already existing grenades 
---
* why craft the explosive ammo at all of hand held versions already exist
---
* I want to chuck a bunch of missiles I taped together because it’s fun
---
* maybe they could be gold bullion rewards so they are only available in the late game and at that point you may already have a decent Legendary weapon that fires them and is a better source of damage
---
&gt;Stay calm, it’s a long journey.

&gt;Nuclear Winter is not required, don’t post your complaints about it being an option for SCORE. ( I did three Nuclear Winter Dailies for all of season 1).
---
I never played NW until season 1, I rather enjoyed it for a small change of pace. I'm absolutely terrible at it, but its still fun. When the challenge is outrageous I pass. Also I don't hide in a bush, play! Even if you are bad like me, way more fun.
---
&gt;Maximize your intelligence and experience output with drugs, alcohol, and soups. Sleep helps to. Check out AngryTurtle on YouTube.
---
Agreed and also start a low level toon, makes the 3 levels a week way easier. Plus a new toon! I decided to go heavy weapons on mine as the high level toons are melee/shotgun.
---
&gt;Don’t buy into the bitch threads about “the grind”. Just do the dailies and a couple weekly’s a day. I was never on longer than an hour total each day.
---
I like this new addition to the game, it gives me a reason to log in w/ my high and low level toons. Never felt like a grind to me. Well other than being melee/shotgun I cant kill a Scorched Queen in a group. I drunk bitched about it in filthy casuals and got banned :-/
---
&gt;If you miss a day or two, don’t fret. It’s not impossible. I took off 
---
TWO WEEKS and still finished a week early.
---
Agreed, and keep in mind its just a game! I finished over a week ago, there is plenty of time in the schedule.
---
&gt;Enjoy the event, don’t turn it into a job. That’s not Bethesda doing it to you, that’s you doing it to yourself
---
+1
---
That of course I agree with. Now if only that was the only bug and not a plethora of other unresolved issues that linger ever since beta...
---
Yeah we really need that red visor instead of cookie cutter pipboi as our lighting. Even fo4 mods have that done properly
---
True story, but an LMG was crucial vs legendary mirelurks in v94.  You needed them to be dead right away.
---
Criminally underrated post. Stopped playing as this became more and more painfully blatant. Seasons/fomo forcing daily engagement was the final straw
---
They were released alongside A Colossal Problem
---
Here’s my setup for my [Bloodied Stealth Commando Build](https://imgur.com/a/6hoCs7e). (An “On the clock” version for raid bosses and an “Off the clock” version for any other time when maximum damage output isn’t required.)
---
Using this build I’ve solo’d the scorched beast queen and Earl Williams with a B3325 Handmade and a B2525 Fixer. (Also just got a B2525 Handmade a few minutes ago as well, can’t wait to test it out against Earl.)
---
It completely went over me 😂
---
But the helmet its self is fucking ugly its all glossy and black not silver/steel
---
Na, when you power down the vending machine it hides the camp from anyone not in the party and anyone in the party will see the flask icon you see on a camp that does not have vend machines.
---
Adds new TOS but says FU to giving us Atom weekly daily challenges till season 2 comes out for 9.95 free if you are a fallout 1st member.  Yup I said them sonsa bishes are gunna fudging charge us fur da season
---
I don't use mic either. Emotes only.
---
So. Your point?
---
This is the worst reason I've ever seen that is applauding the lack of a simple feature, especially on PC where it's arguably crucial.  
---
It's always bad enough that games like this don't come equipped with a basic communication feature, but it's even worse that there are some people that think it's justified for really short-sighted reasons.
---
My 1st silo run was a sad site...almost 2 hours long.level 50 with a hunting rifle..lmao never again will I do that.commando for the win!
---
Also sorry to op.at least once a week I read story's like this and it kinda sucks
---
Na, it was happening to my friend who was online (there toon was standing next to me in my camp at the time). I went to there camp (we were ion a party together) and it spawned fine (I even bought something from there vendor) but it still showed grey the whole time. I assumed it was a bug because you know its Bethesda we are talking about.
---
r/ImSorryJon
---
99 percent of the fucking shop has stayed cosmetic and all anyone ever wants to bitch about is a fucking useless fridge and even more useless scrap and repair kits.
---
It's likely not entirely down to incompetence, but rather Bethesda's refusal to make a separate UI for PC. Also likely a good deal of incompetence considering how many issues the game still has. 
---
It's easy enough to make mute functions block both text and voice, simultaneously. Team Fortress 2 already has the option to pick between team and all chat. Another example would be Overwatch. There's absolutely no reason a competent developer couldn't do this.
---
Yeah ok nice to know
---
Now I'm even more upset I want able to get one. Cleanse Appalachia.
---
I just want to take a second to point out how cool it is that you and your pops play together. I didn't have that as a kid so your dad is a great example of the father I strive to be.
---
Yes. It's binary at this point; I don't play the game anymore-the current model is incompatible with grad school. 
---
Cut the bullshit and I'm happily playing again. That said, CAMP stuff is my favorite, so with everything I'm probably going to miss in s2 that might be a never, however.
---
After all of the food/water monitoring, constant need for ammo depending on use, spare scrap for the Stash to repair gear, I'm surprised we don't have a key to take a sh\*\* or pee.    
---
Despite what areas 'look' like water on the map there isn't much.
---
And pink
---
i think the helmet looks a lil wide as well. i prefer NV version.
---
Yep. I grinded through the Legendary Run but by grind, I don't mean I went out of my way to jump a fuckton of levels so that I was done super early; all I did was make sure to do all the weekly challenges &amp; daily challenges as I could, occasionally deciding not to bother with a kill 3 legendaries or a NW one. I was done a few weeks early &amp; only because I made sure to really do the double score weekends.
---
And I am so burned out I didnt remember to log on to get the BoS collectron (last reward I got was the beret or something oops). I have about zero interest in playing the new season. Any must get rewards? Is that power armor display (think that's what it is) an early reward or late season reward?
---
I just popped Master Chief Collection in after a loooooong time &amp; its currently in Season 2. I can go back and "purchase" all of Season 1's rewards AND I can choose the order of the rewards I get in each tier of of the season. And, as far as I know, there's no way to purchase the points you spend on the season -- if there is, its not bombarding you in the face with purchasing more.
---
If FO76 seasons were even a LITTLE more like that, I would play Season 2.
---
I want to share them with new players though. I mark the price down like 75% on all of them. The other day one guy level 20 was at my camp, then a minute later 2 or 3 more level 15 - 25 players were there and they bought like 30 plans. Made me happy.
---
If they put the mv in game without any ncr logos I'll be happy
---
Oh.  Well I guess now I have time to do something about the fact that all the factions think I'm a complete bastard.  sigh
---
I have the same problem with mines. By the time a mine goes off they’re out of blast range.
---
It's supposed to be the 10th-14th if the leather quota for Fortifying Atlas was made. Which I assume it was.
---
Damn this is actually a clever idea. All of you who sell .45 and 5.56 for more then 1 cap are getting some shit bags.
---
Hope every one gets their 1k plus scrip.half off is insane I'm already overweight I'll probably be dropping alot of heavy script on the ground!
---
Especially mines. Thats why i never use them
---
I would suggest swapping lucky break with ricochet (or however it's spelled). 
---
It doesn't say this on the card but it's supposed to avoid damage when that effect is triggered (based on Reddit posts you can find by googling). Low chance but still useful
---
Public or private server?
---
Good tip thanks.  You just loose junk though like stable flux right?  I saw my rewards list and there was some stable flux.  I wouldn’t have lost any plans right?
---
As a bloodied tank, I’m pretty excited about this perk too.
---
Hit it
---
Bloodied Commando build solo or with stealth team only is the easiest way to do ACP. Quick and greatest way to have ultracite ammo. 
---
Albastos lined chest mandatory, better with poison resistance armor
---
Just wanna say thanks for always updating the codes
---
I'm sure we all knew this by now. Reducing the concrete goal was a stunt to up the legitimacy of the event. It's all fake numbers no matter what.
---
If you're respawning while the event rewards are being awarded, there's actually a chance you miss all the rewards, plans included. Happened to me at scorched earth before, haven't had it yet happen during acp
---
There was a whole story IN WASTELANDERS about &gt;!Lou the Ghoul.!&lt;
---
This is a spoiler so I will tag it. &gt;!But, Lou was depressed about being a ghoul and ran away from  The crater. You make your way through a cave where there are several contraptions and notes  describing and showing how Lou was attempting to kill himself. You literally convince him to postpone his suicide and decide whether you care for his fate after using him for the endgame mission of breaking into the Gold filled vault.!&lt; 
---
The entire game is a rated M apocalyptic bleak wasteland full of mutated dangerous animals and pillaging gangs. Why in the fuck are Bethesda being so progressive and authoritarian? I thought they were doing so well, why did they sell their soul to Zenimax?
---
Only level 8?    
---
Start over. A lot has changed and you can get 10 pretty fast. Fallout has always been about the freedom to do almost whatever you want; with consequences.    
---
I would still use the "Nukes and Dragons" website to create a build and stick to it for the most part. Near the bottom after you've done it, there is a Level by level perk suggestion area. Click on that and save that page somehow. I have one main at 117 and two alts who I don't use often. So far that site does really well in helping a character progress.
---
It's bugged for me too, some of the effects say -4 instead of -1 but it seems like a visual glitch, however sometimes when the 50% less accuracy debuff isn't going down because of class freak my guns will have way less accuracy.
---
You'll get more luck, but a lot of it will be bad.
---
Agreed, I've donated nothing. They don't have the option for us to fail. Can you imagine the bitching? Can you imagine the blame the community would put on Bethesda?
---
I don’t know how ps4 works but could you have a friend log in to your account from their device and buy it through your account?
---
One more thing to add, it doesn't matter if it is easy to solo. The person who puts the card in should be able to start it when THEY are ready to, not some dipshit who didn't pay for it and is impatient. I usually only run it when I am nearby and personally hate swapping around perk cards (mainly because I forget to swap them back) for a quest that can take as little as a minute.
---
How do you plan on being able to use it?
---
The justification of selling Atoms was that you could ALSO get them doing daily and weekly challenges SO we jumped in the pot (Bethesda then turns up the heat) Bethesda gets you all who are bitching " it's too grindy I just want to explore" Explore fucking what? There is nothing to explore nothing to do. Rank dont mean shit. Earning atoms by "Grinding " was all I have to do. So you all are now complacent to Bethesda not even giving out Atoms through challenges and just rather pay the mother fuckers real money for a broke game to get atoms to buy broke shit. 👏👏👏congrats you lazy ass kissing fuckers
---
This would be a complete shock if we hadn't already known this for weeks.
---
I think they already stated the energy weapon numbers on the PTS are bugged and should be higher.
---
So angry over a single word. I’m guessing you know where this is going then. Would you consider the scrap box and survival tent cosmetic only?
---
Some people are happy to have help if they've been in a silo for over 30 mins.  Others are really annoyed at having company.  Sometimes it's hard to tell them apart as well!  And it's a public server, and public area, you don't have any rights to it.  Until they make it instanced..  so put aside your expectations that you earnt or deserved it because that's just not the rules of the game.  Yes it's 'courteous' not to, but then it's also courteous not to one-shot kill the nightstalker, or the Uranium Fever legendaries, but we know how often those happen..
---
Ugh. Yeah.  So that's why I lock thst door.
---
You get a projection lamp that’s as cool as the nuke cola one because it doesn’t work
---
With these rewards being 'earned' it's stupid to even have them in the shop in the 1st place as all scenarios lead to a segment of players being upset. 
---
Have them in the shop temporarily and you upset players like OP.
---
Have them in the shop permanently for free and you upset the majority, as they complain that the newbie player that just started 3 months from now is able to get something they didn't 'earn', thus removing the prestige of having one.
---
Keep them in the shop, but put a price tag on them after 'X' amount of time and you've just combined the first two player groups into one pissed off mob. 
---
Why they put them in the shop in the first place is beyond me. The easiest solution would have been to simply auto award them to all players logging in upon completion of the event.
---
I'd play the game more if Bethesdas entire upper-management weren't 100% focused on micro-transactions and Bethesda were ran by people who are passionate, like it used to be. I'm sick of lack-luster endgame boss fights and grinds that require super repeatable tasks and every day attendance. I absolutely hate the lack of transparency and the huge disconnect between the people who play and the people who make the game. I really just don't like Todd either. I wish like Elon Musk owned Bethesda.
---
Spent 10k trying to get a good roll without much luck... Random completion of a an event = bloodied handmade, so about right.
---
Debating to just buy weapons and try to get armour instead (vanguard)
---
Its need more visibility, but alas, random shitposts like * hi i finally hit lvl 50 with 10 kids * gets more upvotes
---
As the proud owner of a L100 caveman RP character who ONLY uses a spear... YES PLEASE xD
---
but if they get hurt you become wanted, just like irl
---
Tyfys
---
For me, just checking my strength special, it appears to be just a visual glitch. Unequip and reequip it and the stats readjust to normal.
---
50 cal does more damage per shot and have more DPS, with the same dmg numbers and fire rate
---
Is that still going? Not that I'd donate, F the BOS.
---
When does the sale start?
---
For the SBQ your in this state of the game junkies or bloodied. Melee, rifleman, commando, power armor/heavy weapon....doesnt matter. Junkies and bloodied are the king builds and prob the only realistically viable ways for the average player to have a prayer at soloing her. 
---
Theres other builds that are good/fun for everyday play and grinding. But that fight, solo in particular we are kinda shoehorned into playing a certain way
---
More repeatable things? You're joking right?
---
It's been messed up for months.    
---
I don't mind doing it b/c it can be done quickly. Most of the time I can fast travel away and then back and it's fine. Others it stays broken and after I'm done I'll wait till the next day and they'll spawn in another location.    
---
Todd would say it's not broken but a 'feature'.
---
Unless you can't fast travel... I'd like an option to return to camp when I click on my name at the top of the social menu.
---
Why can’t we just get weapon skins instead of this shit
---
Lol that’s probably what happened then.  I did get a cursed weapon but it doesn’t seem like Ingot anything else.
---
Fr tho
---
Hey, don't be too hard on yourself buddy.
---
No, maybe a different group.
---
Don't ruin the illusion dude you're stating the obvious but far beside the point.
---
Sale goes from Sept 10th-14th, though don't ask me what time.
---
For fallout 1st subscribers
---
And don’t forget whenever you get a BE it’s a pipe gun instead of any heavy weapon or rifle. N
---
It depends on your skills. If you suck, a quad ffr Tesla works like a charm. I use AA ffr handmade or furious ffr....
---
Someone opened a lunchbox near you and you got the Confetti Mess perk. Works just like Bloody Mess I believe but with confetti, obviously. Lasts for an hour I think.
---
Did you or someone near you open a Lunchbox? That’s one of the gifts you can receive from those. If anyone near you opens one, you get the benefit for an hour, which you can track in your STATS on the pipboy
---
I can see how the idea of participation trophies became the definition of achieving goals for some of you. If I don't play for most of a season, do I deserve all that seasons rewards? Should we just make it a box of toys that every player recieves, regardless of time or effort put in? 
---
I don't understand why you guys think you are owed rewards for not ticking the boxes. If I dont play much COD for a season it seems odd to get angry at the season pass for it.
---
Yeah, and they would need a decent and increasing cash flow these years.
---
Damn, I just decided to find/grind that recipe this evening. A month? F that,  I may just be your new best ballistic bock buddy. PSN Attinctus
---
Somebody opened a lunchbox near you. It's a temporary buff
---
Oh you forgot to say that you dont want to open the card packs.
---
Ooooh I had never seen that before!
---
Tbh I didn't know the lunchboxes gave you those kinds of perks!
---
Or they just weren't as obvious! 
---
Lolol
---
Thank you for the info!
---
IT JUST WORKS!!!!!
---
Now it’s time to get trash rolls again with my luck 
---
✊😔
---
Ah, turns out YOU are the raider who's been stealing these all along.
---
The event has too many bugs at this time, It’s probably best to wait 6 months &amp; maybe Bethesda might fix it or just remove it from the game...
---
&gt;, 
---
but how do I not use fireworks, or make sure I only get one shot out of my BPR
---
Depends on a server really, yesterday i rolled junkies+ 10% aim damage 4 times out of 5 (my character was junkies so okay). So if you have alot of the same shit prefixes, switch server. I had bashing damage spree, or explosive weapons spree, so all those *random* buys have some kind of a pattern
---
I'm sorry man I just picked up one and it's all spiraling out of control.
---
Does that matter?
---
I'll send you a friend request here shorlty, when I googled it some people got it fast. Not me tho. Its really been more like two months since I started the grind but this last month has been preety lax on the dailys.
---
Wait, project Atlas is still going on? Didn't the guy already steal all the supplies and go off to Vegas?
---
I hope your ok brother. I heard about the california fires and they just keep getting worse and worse. Stay safe man!
---
I like how they said you can get banned for talking about conspiracy theories.
---
Sounds like you didn't play this season ...tbh.
---
Ditto on that second point. The introduction of Fallout first really made me not want to ever buy it. 
---
A lot of us players were around in the beginning, when the game cost $60 and was released half baked. Bethesda knew it wasn’t ready for release but went through with it anyway.
---
Some of us stuck through it anyway and saw the game go from a terrible mess to fun and promising. And how are we rewarded for our loyalty? An expensive subscription service, bundling some of the most common requests from the player base (more storage, a second fast travel point, private worlds, NCR Ranger outfit), released right after Wastelanders was delayed for months. The timing of it all couldn’t have been worse.
---
My brother does tech repair, so I'm going to have it fixed, I just don't know if it will be this week, or this month, you know?
---
I did, for about 20levels as greymoore got released. It's a classic mmorpg, but didn't catched me.
---
Good suggestion. I have a friend with the game already installed. If I logged in with my PlayStation account on his system, I could totally make it happen.
---
No, but it's one small chain I could collect for doing what's Australian have achieved. And it's very lucky that, currently, big poli*** environmental condition is very favourable to us in my country.
---
Public.
---
On Xbox Neither codes work and the third one supplied by MODUS bot does not work
---
Still after a junkies handmade, got a zealots, that bloodied as 1* and a 3* hunter (bought).
---
Does the same count for armour though or haven't you noticed that?
---
But I like fight that big ol ostrich leg arm having greasy bastrad.
---
It’s not crucial though. You have options on PC just as there are anywhere else. There’s discord and other things as well.
---
Literally every MMO that does events like this throttles and controls them.
---
Appreciate you as always!
---
I was doing all my dailies and weeklies and still only got to 94. Bethesda really wanna us to play this shit like a second job
---
I've just been leaving insult notes. Sadly I'm down to 1 left so until the bot finds me again I might have to take up your suggestion.
---
Go into 3rd person, or focus on the blur as you can still make out where the center should be. Or if you're really hard up you can put a small sticky dot on the center of your screen. It's a small trade off for invisibility.
---
We were 40 million short last night. I have donated since the 500 steel. Wasn’t worth the effort and I’m sure 99% feels the same.
---
He should be at your camp, no? I JUST did this quest a few minutes ago. Was fine for me. Sorry I’m not much help.
---
Im already using it guilt free with prime receiver, fluorescent flux = whitesprings nuke
---
bad take
---
holy shit what a waste **WHY didn't you rename it the one ring before you did that?**
---
So it is or isn’t incompetence? Maybe they just don’t want to deal with the spambots and trash to begin with? It’s not an issue if you don’t give them the outlet in the first place, and there’s options for people that need/want text chat available, such as discord.
---
Cool, I'll be on tomorrow. Be good to have a supply until I find the recipe. I never did The Biv quests beyond the nukashine thing because they're a pain in the ass. So, thanks!
---
Relax, absolutely nothing will change about your daily gameplay. Don’t u got some alt right forums to post on or sumn
---
Definitely this. A Fat Man should probably ignore pretty much any resistance, because it's limited by weight, relative rarity of ammunition, a low rate of fire, danger to user, and difficulty of actually hitting the target. 
---
It would still be a wildly impractical weapon to use for many encounters, but it would at least have a use against the toughest of enemies, which should really be the point of a miniature nuclear device. If you hit a SBQ with it, for instance, it should do a decent chunk of damage, because it's still not capable of firing nearly as quickly or accurately as anything else.
---
I dropped 1000 of each item (except cement) so far. And, so far, the rewards have completely sucked duck penis.
---
Where did I say that everyone deserves all rewards just for owning the game? You are so blind in your defense of Bethesda’s predatory and exploitive business practices you miss the actual topic being discussed. No one is arguing that you should have been rewarded for putting in no effort, but rather that all effort be treated equally.
---
If one player is able to put in the hour and a half most users reported needing to complete dailies(10.5 hours a week), why should someone who is only able to play for a combined 12 hours on the weekend  receive substantially less SCORE?
---
With legendary perk maxed and all crafting perks you making 9 (yes NINE) ultracite plasma cores out of just 2, fusion cores have nice crafting numbers too (they are easy to get anyway)
---
Also, I saw your comment regarding sticks and body cavities, can you post that again so everyone knows the caliber on conversation we are having?
---
Yeah to be honest I find it very annoying and wish I could mute it...
---
They should go with 24 hour time to avoid the confusion.
---
If you had seen some unyielding/AP refresh/Sentinel's T65s, could you find it possible to turn some 3*legendary armors into accessories or power armor by editing base FormIDs.
---
I would pull the same thing tbh.
---
I donated 250 steel and couldn't give a damn after that. Thanks for your hard work!
---
tools are tools. weather they act similarly to another shouldn't be the point. if they don't do the job, then whats the point of having them in the game.
---
I play on ps4, I don’t use a mic because I have terrible social anxiety but I’m courteous &amp; respectful &amp; play daily, If we’re on the same platform &amp; you’d like a third for your team, I’d be happy to send you a Psn friend invite.
---
I’m pretty sure they did it this way because Bethesda Austin is running the train and not the main studio.
---
I have iOS though... no XCloud for me...
---
but the change they are doing is not balancing, its just going to make bullet sponges more spongey, and make people, who worked hard for their builds, do less damage than what they were rewarded for their hard work
---
I see this all the time and I don't get it. What's the deal with fishing?
---
Need to buy like 5-10 to see, i buy 2 star weapons only, and yes, ive seen several vanguard or uny gear in a row. There was some post, like, purveyor have 3 groups with rolls, people spend thousands of scrip to figure it out, just for science lol. You know all those *random* stuff still programmed in some way
---
No  problem. Off the next two days so I'll be in touch.
---
It would be even better to have this also work when over-encumbered. A single fast travel point is fine as an exception
---
Take some comfort in the fact that players who do that sort of thing are usually unhappy tryhards.  
---
I never mess with anyone at a silo because it takes all of 15 minutes to blow through a different one by myself.
---
I collect those notes, I'd be thrilled if someone left me one.
---
I realize a lot of people know. I’m just putting it out there for people who don’t and think were actually doing it legit lol
---
Just imagine if zenimax online was In charged of fo76... 4 dlc and chapter per year instead of this cosmetics nonsense
---
Id be happy to take one off your hands
---
What they need is a F OFF! Emote. Then people wont talk to you
---
Oh pipe weapons do their job really well. Just not as well as handmades
---
The nuke warning message should end with, "Have a nice day" in the DMV voice, really.
---
I solo'd her once the first time I tried and it was a breeze. (Bloody Stealth commando.) Tried it twice since and it was a disaster both times. No idea what caused the difference.
---
Not like “kill 5 radtoad” repeatable, repeatable as in Dungeons and Raids etc.
---
So, Gollum is just a really short Wendigo?
---
Thoughts from a relatively new player(lvl 55) who is generally not very experienced with online games and is a casual player.
---
76 monetization works very well for me mainly because I don't think they monetize anything that a player **needs** to have to enjoy the game.
---
*Atoms: Nice to have but at the end of the day I don't need them and I get a small amount from just playing the game. Not too artistic/creative but I understand that for some people this is a core part of the game. If a core reason I bought/played the game was base building/looks, I'd definitely be mad that this was paywalled but as I understand it, they were clear from the beginning that cosmetics would be monetized?
---
*Private Worlds: This is the one that I most see as a "should maybe be open to everybody". Personally though, I'm not sure I understand what people do in private worlds. My main need for this would have been if other players were aggressive/bothersome but in 76 I've never felt that. Obviously if this somehow changes I'd be clamoring for private worlds for free lol.
---
*Scrap box: As a relatively low level player that doesn't even hit the 150 scrip daily limit on extended plays my opinion here might be invalid but i'll give it anyways lol. I personally don't think this is a game breaker so far. While you can store more, you are still limited by the same daily/weekly limits as everyone and still require to play to actually maximize on this rather than some pay to win mechanic. At the same time I think it's an amazing improvement that gives enough value to those paying for it.
---
*Tents: Very nice to have. Not needed for play.
---
They probably did that so they wouldn’t overwork the employs working on ESO.
---
Laziness and incompetence are not mutually exclusive. It's also easy enough to mute people. That, and if text chat functioned the same as voice chat you'd only see your team-mates at long range. Thus any spammers would have to be close and mute should work fine for them. 
---
It certainly works fine for the tools spamming stuff in ...practically every game that has it. Also, suggesting Discord is a cop out. We're talking about basic functionality that should be expected from any major online game now.
---
Same, i was unavailable for 1 week and a half and still got to the end. And i skipped most lvl up challenges as im to high lvl to do those properly. And im to lazy to make a new character
---
What? Lol that not how it works
---
Yeah, Men in Black style.
---
Dont think there is a Black suit somewhere in the game
---
How does it work then? Isn’t that the only game Zenimax Online Media Group is working on right now?
---
Its just another hobby like raiding or murder.
---
I tried dense and it does seem to work as well as Fireproof level 3.
---
Yep, now we are awaiting Shadowed mods.
---
So many people bitching about how long S1 took, and I skipped a few days entirely and even some dailies a few time, and I finished way before the deadline.
---
I wanted to quit so badly while doing that freaking mission 😐
---
I literally had to go through that 3 times. I stopped mid-way through the first time to go to bed and it reset me back to the beginning of the quest. The second time my game crashed and it reset me.
---
By the time I got the end the final time, I honestly felt like I was going to cry.
---
What year is this?
---
For fatman lances to be really good you need to tame a deathclaw and then be able to ride it to charge your enemies down!
---
Though I've never done it myself, I'd say if you're able to solo radiation rumble, scorched earth should be a cake walk. The biggest issue in my opinion are the ground mobs. If you can take care of them and quickly refocus on the queen, she should go down easy.
---
Having the 2 is overkill
---
Unless you're mute or deaf, you have a choice. The person above you most certainly didn't chose to be mute.
---
The attitude of some people is mind boggling. By not having text chat, this game, and by extension Bethesda, says that they don't care about people with disabilities and, quite frankly, that should be named and shamed constantly.
---
They also working on a new untitled mmorpg 
---
When companies start expanding into more projects.. they kinda hire more people to support the workload lol
---
I exited the cave and promptly died of radiation exposure tonight.  No rewards for me either.
---
Yep.   Aren't there trade forums?   So that's against TOS now?
---
Did I miss something about seasons having a cost going forward? I remember Bethesda being very clear they were not going to charge for Seasons? Are you discussing a conspiracy theory? ;)
---
Check the room in the bunker, if it's in green across the board, last week's codes work. If it shows red, then you have to wait until they fix it. It seems newer servers (private servers and fresh public servers) are running on a different version.
---
5 characters been playing since beta. Never finished the quest once.
---
Makes sense to me.  Thanks.
---
So first duping was great, but now it's this vile thing that definitely is bad in spite of your previous statement about it being good? I don't see how backing off your initial claim to say your opposition is right really supports any argument against theirs, but I can only imagine it's some advanced rhetorical strategy or grand reveal planted at the start or something because it's so far beyond simple folk like me.
---
I'm also glad to know that community complicity somehow makes the long term issues not worth tackling or caring, because they're good. No wait, they're bad now, right? I get these things mixed up.
---
I agree with a lot of your points but again I don’t think greed is the right word. 
---
I deal with an upmarket business, and we get this thrown at us often that our prices are too high etc. But we work on very minor profit margins and generally only charge what we need to. It’s our running costs and accreditation’s that’s make us more expensive. We have more staff than other companies so our response is better and our accreditation (which is expensive) means we are held to higher standards and use expensive equipment. 
---
BGS need to pay for development cycles for new DLC, maintenance and patch work and general infrastructure. It’s not cheap. 
---
Although I will say that the game isn’t polished enough for the costs given to gamers especially with the quality of the items. 
---
Example being communist bunker £5 GBP and it’s unusable in most camp locations.
---
I'd also love it if we could see an aerial view just before it places.
---
Too late already down in the silo hoping someone knew
---
Why not 3* out of interest?
---
You can never truly randomise a random generation when you have to write code for it after all.
---
With the 50% off I guess it's a good excuse to do `science' for some armour rolls lol. Though I don't know if it's better to just roll for 2* to get a better chance of getting something worthwhile
---
I haven’t been playing long, but I an certainly doing this.
---
Bethesda makes a lot of bizarre choices with the Atom Shop that don't really seem to benefit anyone, Bethesda included. Some of the older stuff might not have been super popular, but you're not making any money on stuff that's been vaulted for over a year. Or when they bring back most of a series. I think they brought back all of the Mothman stuff a while back, except for the Mothman statue itself for some reason. And they add Unstoppable themed stuff to the shop all the time, but I can't remember the last time I saw the Unstoppable stash box in the shop.
---
Took me like 3 hours to do lmaooooooooo
---
Maybe rhe BOS stuff is only for junkie players who *need* to log on daily. Gotta get my fix.
---
Ok, murdering I get. So, fish murder? Whatever floats your boat, as they say.
---
And you can use the bag pack skins from the atom shop on it to.
---
No.  Ace the raider collectron says "I have lots of hobbies like raiding, murder, raiding...
---
My buddy said they should add an emote of a gift box with a bird inside for asshats that one shot bosses. That way you can give someone the bird. 😜😂🤘
---
Keep it or sell it to me if you are on of I know people who will give money for the things i have a few myself and it’s quite useful
---
I find killing the SBQ easier than encrypted.
---
It’s interesting to read some of these comments this morning, people have such different views on this. 
---
I think there is a common view that there is an understanding for the need for MT and monetisation but the general irk is that we are being charged for something that isn’t polished/finished. Whether this is he game or MT themselves, like the example given of the communist bunker and Ghillie suits. We pay for something that we need to then demand is fixed and often isn’t (or isn’t for a long while).
---
I do hope with threads like this community managers do report the answers across because it’s important to understand your customers. I think for example that after patch 22 if they were to say that further content is delayed for a major bug fix addressing all the outstanding issues from launch myself as a first subscriber wouldn’t be upset. I would in fact continue to sub and play knowing our concerns are taken on.
---
I just think they use the same tactic as retailers. Most people have gone in the shop to buy a drink costing £1.20, they only want one but the moment they see it 2 for £2, most will buy 2 either when they only want one to save that 40p. The bundle system is the same tatic in my opinion.
---
They also said "Yes we are charging for Atoms but you can also earn Atoms for free doing challenges" Is that still a thing oh that's right they just reduced the free atoms by over 75% so tell me Lover of "I'm not the lore guy" Pete Hines or "It just works" Todd lying Howard you go on and believe what HONEST Bethesda says.*pats you on top of your head*
---
If you end up on a public team with me or any other chatty player for that matter, just mute us.  No one should get offended.
---
Yes to all of the above. Don't even really have to do anything special with it, just give it a simple cast animation and make it a chance to either catch nothing, catch junk, spawn a mirelurk, or catch a fish. Then add display racks for trophy fish, fish tanks for smaller fish, new recipes to cook. Make it happen cap'n.
---
I can see that to a certain extent.  However, what about the conspiracy theory oddness?  Are they afraid a new Q is going to appear in their game?   lol    I mean, have you ever seen that mention in any ToS anywhere before?   I haven't, but then I haven't made a point to read these things previously.
---
MY GUY YOU JUST HELPED ME LAUNCH MY FIRST NUKE THANK YOU SO MUCH
---
This comment brought to you by the power of Yorkshire tea
---
Rule 1. The pie is a lie.
---
Not really. 
---
Honestly, my faith is at an all time low. I've seen stalwarts of the industry fall to EA style practices far too many times to have any left. 
---
Once a company gains a certain level of prestige, it seems all but required for them to stop caring about players and start caring about RoI instead. 
---
The hype surrounding Cyberpunk is cancerous, as it infects the developers publisher and ultimately forces them to 'play ball' the same way other companies are. 
---
Since Cyber is being developed by AND published by the same company, there is admittedly less risk of this (for now) but no...
---
I have stopped looking forward to games releasing now. I look forward to playing them once all the bugs are fixed and the loot crates have been revealed months later.
---
Don't try to fight a deathclaw straight out of the vault
---
MAMA
---
Don't ask anyone to trade. 
---
Don't run around with an open Mic.
---
 All I got atm
---
Actually, it's the oposite for me. I had some time to get on tonight and I don't know what to do with myself...
---
&gt;It decreases AP cost as much as an aligned stock
---
Oh nice! This is good to know
---
Don't let any other players tell you how to play the game. If the game allows it and it isn't against ToS, you do you. It's on Bethesda &amp; Bethesda alone to encourage bahaviours they want &amp; discourage those they don't want from their player base.
---
Not a bug, sorry those nice stairs only snap to a foundation and go down can't be used to reach the second story.
---
I mean, you could have explained without saying lol, lol. Makes you seem like you trying to act as if your smarter than someone else lol.
---
Ah alright thanks, so triggering having to use metal stairs with the rails :/
---
They have to because we all know that the rewards and events were preprogrammed a month ago to go live and aren't tied to the tracker at all. Meeting the goal is just an illusion.
---
Actually I think they said the first one was free and implied they hadn’t decided on the following seasons.
---
What do you mean and why do you think it's a bug? It might help to upload a photo or describe in detail what you noticed that bothers you.
---
Uh Frodo said hed take the ring...he volunteered
---
Don't one shot the legendaries
---
👏
---
I'd like to add;
---
Can we change doors that led to load screens to the 'Hold X' style that we get for sitting and resting?
---
I've lost track of how many times I've accidentally clicked a door that said 'Appalachia' by accident and then had to sit through 2 load screens just to get back to it.
---
nah...its called a complement. sam was a hero but he couldnt have done what Frodo did
---
Sorry my dude...upvotes whatever...but nah Sam would have easily succumbed to the Rings power
---
It’s clear they are covering the spread. I’ve been a huge Fallout 3 and 4 players, hundreds if not thousands of hours. But when 76 came out with a less than good review, I had more things in life and less gaming besides a casual hour here and there. Then once 76 came on game pass I said why not, in return I’ve gotten back into playing more often and although I’m ‘seasoned’ in the series, I know majority of the new game pass clients are sulking in the events and diving into the community majority of us have already embraced. Not only is Bethesda slowly raising their market base, they are providing public interest with these events. None of the new people are going to sulk in the ineptitude of endless bugs/glitches when they are being fed new content at the scale of, dare I say it, Fortnite or EA Ultimate Team Modes. 
---
TL;DR-of course they cover the gap, negative reinforcement is not going to satisfy the desperate desire for more content and incentives; which by the way are all attempts to regulate the in game economy and obviously suppress the impact of duperscoopers
---
wait how was this even possible thru hacking?
---
and if these exist...then Beth really doesnt give a fuck at all about this game
---
If the game can make room for mic chat, the game can make room for text chat.  This isn't some difficult procedure.
---
Communication in a multiplayer game is crucial, stop trying to downplay it.
---
I learned something today...
---
and knowing is half the battle!
---
Nah I’m not acting like that lol
---
Guess it forgot fishing. Either that or I don't live by a lake.
---
I agree. There’s just something about a thumbs down that cuts so deep. It’s like an “I’m not angry, I’m just... so disappointed” emote and it feels bad.
---
You know there are only a few you can craft and that it does not apply to vast majority of weapons...
---
Don't assume vendor camps are safe. 
---
Avoid pvping someone at their camp.
---
If you don't lock your resource generators(collectotron, water, extractors) don't get mad when others loot them.
---
Supply requisitions are a currency.
---
Hey codes are same as last week. Hit up nukacrypt website
---
Be nice to the newbies, because you were once one and people were (mostly) nice to you.
---
Your real American hero 😂
---
[https://imgur.com/a/vsYcqz3](https://imgur.com/a/vsYcqz3) i mean this section in atom shop, i don't have it. First  in a list "Fallout 1st". Then "Apparel", "skins" etc but not "Featured"
---
Because tacking online play onto the fallout 4 engine comes with a lot of busted things, I imagine
---
*citizencaneclap.gif*
---
If vendors are hidden or prices are way too high... Kill the Brahmin!
---
This. I can’t think of any business model that succeeds by going against basic economics and that a market responds to incentives and their own personal interest. Like for me, I still have hope I’ll get even just one 3* Handmade during the 50% off sale lol
---
What upsets me is that they didn't even try to remind the general playerbase about this event. 
---
Without going to the Bethesda website, it's hard for the average player to know what material is needed, how close the global goal is to target, and what the reward for the current slot is. 
---
If they had a pop-up each time a player logs in that was as annoying as those map fragment pop-ups, I'm quite confident the organic numbers would be exponentially higher than what they are now, whatever they are.
---
Bethesda expect us to no life this game and basically treat it like a second job. I was doing all my dailies and weeklies and made only to rank 94. I thought today was the last day according to the spaceship.  Was planning on buying the last few but they decide not to take peoples money the one time the option would actually be useful.
---
Ahhh it would kill me to destroy something so cool.
---
After all....why  *shouldn't* I keep it..
---
😅
---
And ultralite limbs....
---
I like to set up multiple guitars close to the Settler wander's guitar chair. That way, as soon as she is done playing her regular guitar solo, she walks a couple of steps and feels compelled to do it again!
---
.... Didn't think you could wear PA under like level 25... Isn't that a thing?
---
Take the banjo away from that old bastard at welch trainstation, I can hear him play that from across the town, drawing every enemy in.
---
Because the entire basis of the game is your from vault 76. If there’s ghouls and supermutants in there then something went horribly wrong
---
lol
---
I disagree: There is something wrong with it, in much the same way there's something wrong with how companies exploit addiction. In some cases it can cause legitimate psychological distress.
---
Working as intended
---
Visual glitch
---
Look, it is the fabled one, the one who actually read the new user agreement rather than skimming to the end.
---
The rest of us have probably consented to  giving all our worldly possessions to Todd upon death.
---
same :-\\
---
Play how you want. If you're having fun, roll with it.
---
Was specifically referring to items in the Atomic Shop that cost Atoms.  However, free items in the Atomic Shop should stay free and permanent.
---
It's not a real rpg without fishing
---
The Event was HORRIBLY implemented.  High levels already have all that stuff or don't want it, low levels don't have the resources to give.  The numbers were too high (even if people were interested in doing it);  Bad timing too considering people would rather do the new stuff (ACP, PTS) and were also probably suffering burnout from the season grind.
---
There's a lot more i could say about it but I'm sure i don't need to, including the doubt that we finished it legitly.
---
There is the perk that shows you your throwing ark.
---
As for mines, yeah some adjustment to mines would be good. I learned the hard way you cant throw down more than  2 nuke mines at once and promptly yeeted myself out of the map.
---
Thanks. Have a safe place to be for now. Closing in further on the main town though
---
What about a certain Super Mutant that love's handing out mini nukes, what's his name again?? pretty sure it's not santa clause
---
Alternatively make nw actually have content so more people will play it
---
It took me a week
---
It was actually quite short and to the point.
---
The whole section is missing? Haha I just checked on PS4 and it looks like I can only see the first page of Featured. 
---
I can see the tabs: Around Appalachia, Jukebox, Greatest Hits, Villains and Special, but I can only see Around Appalachia.
---
If that's what you mean then yeah, probably broken for a lot of people!
---
Whenever he refuses to talk the first time when i go to him, i just shoot him
---
Literally, just pull your gun out, and shoot him
---
That is the solution I have to the problem and it works every time.
---
See the only reason I don't main stealth suit is because I'm carrying too much shit at all times. If you're making it work then I see no problem
---
72 hours to claim is silly. It should have been up for a week or two at the least.
---
Honestly, rules are only as good as how they are enforced. You can write anything you want on paper as the 'rules' but if you do not enforce them, then they are nothing. Do you really believe FO76 has the resources to enforce these rules? They could not even deal with the duppers or the hackers. When you send a support ticket, all you get is an automated response. So, I doubt they will be able to enforce any of these rules.
---
I think the main thing that we should worry about is if they automate the suspension policy like Activision/blizzard does. They have it set up so that if enough people report someone, that person gets automatically suspended without human intervention. So, what people playing world of warcraft will sometimes do is to blackmail other players telling them to pay gold or otherwise their entire group will report them so that they get suspended. That is some fucked up shit right there. Hopefully Bethesda will not follow the same path.
---
Definitely not.  Radiation rumble is way easier than sbq
---
Shit, man, even EA does this with Titanfall 2
---
I've never considered myself disabled, but I have a speech impediment and text chat will make all the difference to me. I avoid talking to people on a discord group I play with regularly and have gotten to know, never mind talking to strangers.
---
😂😂😂
---
 I sometimes drop into a silo to help, but I don’t launch. I instead message them that it’s their nuke to launch and I’m just helping.
---
A simple laugh emote is all I want, just get do it I guess, I'm stuck with the thumbs up.
---
I believe the yellow hard hat is named the steel worker hat specifically.
---
I want to play cyberpunk, it looks very promising. The Witcher 3 i enjoyed every second of it, what a masterpiece.
---
😂
---
You're not confused.
---
So did you get it fixed, in the end?
---
If you’re a shotgun guy, gauss shotgun, if not maybe the plasma caster might interest you
---
Sooo now what do I do that someone put this shit in the wide open in my camp? I can’t delete it and I’m not re doing my whole camp, I don’t even have half the items people have built for me learned.....would take to long to rebuild. Only one characters since the beta too!
---
At least something - I took the watch back to Maggie just to complete it and there was nothing. Not even any of the usual crap.
---
Why don’t you just put on power armor or a hazmat suit before you get kicked out?  You already know you’re going to load into a nuke zone.  It’s not a surprise.
---
That's a thought. 
---
Maybe the shotgun just for grins and giggles?
---
I fully committed to commando on that one, so I've only got 5 points in strength and really can't afford to swap out those cards.
---
Meh. Too long. I spent close to 2 hours today trying to find a bottle of Old Pissum for the Biv quest. Not that I have anything better to do, but still...
---
Coming from PS4 and a bit of knowledge on the Xbox but we have digital keyboards and text chats in a few games example of MP's Ark, Rocket League, CoD:MW, War Thunder and a few SP's like Ark, Fo4, Skyrim &amp; Subnautica so I really don't see an issues to this hole keyboard conundrum.
---
at least the cake is real... right? ... right?
---
I miss the vault 94 raid :(
---
The legacy stash you must have in your player stash is probably outstanding lol
---
You should be able to rig an instrument with a nuke mine......
---
Legacy stash?
---
Weapon weights reduced by 20%... that is awesome. They should make jewelry with passive effects like that...
---
You don't want the 100 caps at the end lol
---
Certain legendary weapons were removed from the loot pool because they were too powerful (for example a bloodied explosive Gatling plasma). Those are highly collectible pieces.
---
Anywho - I’m on psn and we do queen runs and Earle (a new boss) usually every evening cst. Feel free to give me an add and jump in whenever we’re on. FaTaL1ty45
---
Thanks for all the answers. You guys are awesome!
---
I will consider bloodied builds with some defensive perks for survivability because, well, you know, dealing with mobs all around, SB and still have to have an open eye on my health bar is just not doable for me lol. 
---
Off I go find a good set of armor and a gun on vending machines! Wish me luck.
---
I like to leave Propaganda Flyers. You get fuckin tons of them with the Proletariat Collectron and no one likes them, anyway. Toss in some fertilizer for good measure so it looks like you wiped your ass with the idea of joining together to support each other.
---
i didn't even noticed that i can rank up, i tought i can buy missing steps after the season runs out. i had 3 week pause on playing because i was on holidaytrip, and i made it to level 94. and i agree, there is boring stuff, but that fireplace...
---
1 page would of been short. 
---
This was long. 
---
Pretty sure you guys work for zenimax lol
---
Just don't ask what it's made from.
---
So then you will have all knowledge of everything. Then what?
---
Try not to AFK when trading with a vendor...
---
So many people forget this once they have been playing a while. We all started with nothing and didn’t know a damn thing about the game.
---
I still think it's weird that they didn't even include an Energy Weapons deck. So many awesome energy weapons (Gauss, Radium, Plasma, Plasma Caster, Gatling laser/plasma, Alien Blaster, etc) and even though they have perks for heavy guns, rifles, shotguns, and melee there's basically nothing specifically for energy weapons, just whatever larger subset they fall under.
---
Honestly this games battlepass is isn't bad at all, you can level up at least 2-3 levels a day and the challenges are so easy and simple, nothing to complain about it honestly, it's in my opinion one of the best battlepasses that don't take too much of your time to level up at all
---
I read the new rules and its a joke, theres no way it is going to be enforced at all, anything and everything is classed as griefing and against ToS, i like playing the game like its.. ya know an unpleasant wasteland only for the strong and thats how i play, its the nuclear apocalypse game with raiders, murderers, monsters and thieves but if i roleplay a raider even a little then im breaking ToS? Well i guess bethesda had better just ban me now.
---
You have obviously not read any tos before....
---
Invite sent!
---
Definitely
---
Accepted! I’m heading off to bed in a few though and will be in tomorrow. If you have any questions just ask :) feel free to psn message me
---
I imagine a dial where they adjust the 'rng' suckiness like volume knob on an amplifier. Normally it's set to 5. When 50% sale comes, it turned to 11.
---
I have my instruments grouped together and Commander Deguerre (sp?) spends most of her musical time on the upright piano.
---
Hm might have to test to check, but a broken SS chest piece with jetpack might be handy
---
Oh man, they're gonna ban Grahm for sure....
---
That's really awesome. To be honest, the great community this game has will sometimes get me close to having hope in humanity.
---
I often tell myself that 'I could learn from the wonderful people here'... but then I just go back to being a drunk asshole...
---
Oh well. I guess we just have to appreciate the good things we encounter in life :)
---
I actually did my first silo a day or two ago and it took me nearly two hours. I was honestly kind of shocked no one stole it from me.
---
Sorry to hear things didn't go as well for you and your father. I hope you have better luck next time in not having to deal with douchebags.
---
I don't think the SS armor is pointless at all. I don't have all the rolls I would like and I'm running 464 DR which doesn't count the extra from various troubleshooters or mutant Slayer pieces when fighting those enemies. Yeah it looks like garbage even with camo or Gillie skins on them but I'm pretty tanky without PA on.
---
Yea mean take a lazy shortcut route to reduce need for more manpower? We're fucked.
---
True. But how much of a pain would it be to break that sucker?
---
Latter one. They can just listen in as you chat with npcs
---
But this is for my Berserker. 
---
The more DR I have the less damage I do.
---
Raider power armor gets as low as level 15, to the best of my knowledge.
---
Ghouls + mines = Hahahaha.... Ow fuck (quick changing to shotgun)
---
I hot the same.
---
Some dude just kept shooting me last night while I was looting at good springs with a explosive automanic rifle and I think a automanic gamma gun?? it was shooting really fast and I know the gamma gun is only a pistol type of weapon so I don't know what's up with that, but anyways dude kept following me around just being annoying trying to fight (i don't fight people in fallout or pvp cause I just feel that's cringey and just kinda dumb to do in especially in fallout) but yeah, dude just decided it was fun to just blow out my headphones with the loud explosive rounds and keep shaking my screen, I hate people on this game most times
---
Yeah it happens a lot to be honest. I got a level 15 on my team the other day and I gave them a load of stuff and crafted some decent armour for them. I’d you need any help add smithy_bmx I’ll happily help you with anything when I’m on and give you duplicate plans that I’ve got in my vendors. 
---
As for the public teams I only use events and building . 
---
Events for obviously doing events then building for everything else. Heard it gives you slightly more xp. Don’t know how true it is but that’s what I’ve stuck with
---
lol Not only have I read thousands, I've written some of them.
---
Yeah sure you have....
---
Now I want this.
---
I've only found a regular wedding ring with no stats, I can't remember where tho.
---
... and Chally.... She constantly follow Grahm around so wouldn't that be considered 'stalking'? That is against ToS!
---
Ah gotcha, haven't tried that build yet so I can see how it would be pointless to grind all that gold when a broken leather piece with the rolls you want are just the same lol. But like the previous reply a jetpack on regular armor is a game changer with reduced fall damage marsupial and bird bones
---
My only complaint is that they could be making *so* much more money via the shop, with just the tiniest bit of forethought.
---
They spend time and money making skins for unused items like the pickax and alien blaster...
---
They release broken items that don't work and word of mouth spreads like a ring of fire. Limiting the amount of purchases.
---
They prioritize novelty cosmetic items like over-sized bear heads and all but ignore 'survival' type cosmetics. 
---
CAMP items still cost budget. The vast majority of stuff I've purchased just get unused as I have no option without deleting other things I've bought. This limits the amount of purchases I make as it dawns on me there is no point in buying that new plushie, because I'd have to delete the plushie I bought the day before to even place it. 
---
I **want** to spend money on this game but there is so rarely anything worth buying and when there is the above issues come into play. 
---
I cut my teeth on MMO's in the early 2000's, City of Heroes exclusively. I don't mind paying monthly so long as I feel like I'm getting value from it and keeping the servers running in the process. With 76 though, I'm so often left feeling like I'm *not* getting value from my purchases, as I end up not being able to use them.
---
I have 1st, I buy from the shop weekly, but I'd be spending twice as much if they'd just start releasing actual skins and outfits that I can use.
---
Is it still working though... Asking for a friend
---
Haha, that was me when I first started! Drank some punch and ended up at the top of the map! Found a swimsuit and just snuck around. Now I hope whosever punch it was saw me
---
At least players will be satisfied getting the caps when they are killed for griefing 👍
---
Sorry this happened to you 🙁
---
Griefers, griefers never change!
---
Up vote for the warning!
---
honestly that might've been me - I swear to god am I the only person playing this game that's below the level 200?
---
They used the explosive bait exploit, so they didn't become wanted :(
---
I have like 15 supply requisitions? I find them in ghouls all the time
---
Can’t comment on last week but I know it’s ended now so I don’t know if you can stil but on the board or not
---
True true, I'm thinking of Excavator and 'Miner Miracles' quest aren't I?
---
Maybe "limited time" shit shouldn't exist at all in any of these online game stores... I have been waiting for the fish lamp to come back forever, meanwhile bethesda pushes put a ton of stuff into the shop every month meanwhile the things i want/would use atoms for are not on the store anymore, i guess bethesda doesn't want people to use the atom shop afterall...
---
"You will also refrain from participating in conspiracy theories, misinformation or fallacious comments."
---
Fuck. We're all getting banned.
---
I'm a level 153 and haven't even launched a nuke yet because I get annoyed how much ammo I need and how I always die so quick so I just restrain myself from trying again
---
Finally got it after 20 or so and a game reload pretty bs.
---
Like as in only good to be melted down and fashioned into some sort of bedframe?
---
Had 4 disconnects today assuming it’s because of end of legendary run
---
In my case i didn't have this section from time when i bought a game. I saw this section recently in twitch stream from some guy.
---
I like to leave 'I. O. U. Toilet Paper' or 'Pipe is life' notes...
---
2.13
---
"We do not allow petition or protest or public accusations of misconduct in chat rooms, message forums, or games."  
---
By agreeing to this, if someone in-game chat threatens you, and you say "You threatened me I'm reporting you"  
---
You Too have now broken the TOS by making an accusation.
---
My favourite thing to do is drop stuff for low levels in this game. I usually drop a bunch of food, radaway, stimpaks and ammo. If I can get them to stick around I’ll craft armour and weapons to their level too
---
Best thing you could do is hightail it out of the server and find a different one 👍
---
Bethesda needs to create a cheater/griefer server where all the cheater/griefers go when they get reported.
---
Mute your mic, nobody wants to hear you eat a while bag of chips, fight with your s/o, burp or gulp for the entire duration of an event, seriously mouth sounds right in my ear gross me the hell out I'll leave you alone in an event I swear to God.
---
Yeah 20 or so server hops and a game reload finally got it its bs.
---
Alternate theory: they used it as a way to lure out the duppers. If so, they may have got a couple, but no more than that.
---
I got 60 caps.
---
Well you’ll know by my psn because we spoke 😂. Also if your from Norwich and it is you I’m 100 percent not a stalker haha. Once your past 50 it doesn’t really matter anyways. It’s jjst to be able to get new perk cards and move them around. Otherwise it’s all the same you don’t really get anything extra
---
I think it's funnier that you guys think anyone except the person leaving it ever notices this stuff.
---
Approximately how long does it deal with the whole event
---
I do agree with the concept of fishing as a minigame, however we should also be able to Dynamite fish if and when we unlock the dynamite and dynamite bundles from the raiders. They would have an increased chance of obliterating the fish but it would just be fun
---
It's definitely worth considering. 
---
But then I'm going to have two separate armor grinds to deal with plus breaking that SS chest piece. 
---
Making legendary CP's until I find a viable one worth breaking and re-rolling armor on my level 1 mule in hopes of getting armor with fall damage.
---
Personally I don’t mind at all when a low level is around or joins my public team. I’ll go out of my way to go assist or help out if I see them go down several times but after a few times of doing that they are on their own unless they travel to the main group with us or ask for some specific help. When they are attacking stuff despite them not doing much damage in most cases, the effort is appreciated. I try to keep in mind not to kill all enemies too fast so they can get some kills too. I usually will switch to a weaker weapon. 
---
Also at this point in the game I always consider someone on a lower level is likely on an alternate character. Usually becomes more obvious once you see what they are wearing, but I don’t automatically assume every level 10 I come across just bought the game a few hours ago so there’s that as well. I myself have a level 12 alt I created during the Legendary Run to help with some challenges.
---
Cursed weapon is a reward from the event. You only get one item like a plan or a cursed weapon and some flux from the event as well as a random 3 star legendary.
---
Is it not a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small a thing?
---
:( don't remind me
---
Good stuff
---
Piss and shit grenades....
---
Go Junkies if you wanna stick with full health, a Fixer or Handmade, full auto. Use Berry Mentats, Overdrive and Psychobuff, then Ballistic Bock. Also add in a small guns BobbleHead. She will melt, not as fast as bloodied but it will look just as good.
---
This was me until wastelanders. I’d pick the occasional safe or terminal just to see what it had, but otherwise, I didn’t care. Especially not in a non-quest related area.
---
Only the Crimson Prospect and The Wayward have anything interesting in their locked boxes, and maybe something in grafton steel that is currently slipping my mind.
---
sorry.
---
Also - crafting ultracite 308s with ammosmith, duper and ammo factory. You can almost make a full clip for the lmg with a single craft!
---
I burned two cards doing Alpha today with a friend (he burned 3 cards). No nuke, just disappointment....
---
The only solution riflemans have is the plasma flamer... which really, really shouldn’t fall under that perk.
---
No u
---
I was out of town for a week and 2 days and did it without most of the NW. I’m level 449 and I’m having difficulty leveling up as my mules are useless for that aspect.
---
Thank you, it's not a pleasant feeling to return to your Camp and see only the skeleton :0
---
Rosered1230
---
I changed servers but they ended up in the same server after a while. Thankfully I did not repair my camp at the time. They were griefing other players...
---
After I found them in the world I was quite disappointed with myself. Before that my friend and I had a running competition for a long time to see who can get the most pies from the vending machines. 
---
These days I drop pies as a gift/reward for people that have an incredible camp or do something else I find cool. I’ve even started eating them because the weight built up haha.
---
Yup they need to fix it
---
I don't know why I'm responding to this.
---
Well, because you wrote your opening post, I have to say something then.... I hope you also have a great week and a RNGesus blessed Purveyor sale weekend. May you get the epic gear that your heart desires. You're breathtaking!
---
If you're on ps4 I'd happily come in and wipe out all the robots with my troubleshooters shotgun and then leave you to it.
---
You’re continued contributions to the community can’t be measured. Please don’t let things like this stop you from doing what you love!!
---
That really sucks. Tell your dad I. Sorry that happened.
---
Can they now please add:
---
Stop playing your loud awful music over the mic at events (emote)
---
Stop one shotting legendaries you selfish twat (emote)
---
Stop camping at spawn sites in events (emote)
---
Stop hiding/camping on roofs and cherry picking the legendaries (emote) could be covered by a “I don’t work for you” emote.
---
Don’t follow me around I was just helping you out with stimpacks (emote) could be covered by a “it’s just a stimpack not an engagement ring” emote
---
I can’t play the game for you (emote)
---
Add these and I’ll find a little more peace.
---
I don know why I'm responding to this response to my post but... because I'm here I thank you and also I'm not gonna go into detail cuz im pretty sure you dont care but I'm not gonna be having a good time anytime soon
---
Makes you wonder if those new codes of conduct were to cover this..
---
I work in the music industry, I have sent them out with collaborations, outlining what people can and cannot do with recordings.
---
I started season 1 with less than a month left and made it. I just nuked and played went from 190 to 297 and made 2 new characters from 1 to 70
---
While I don’t disagree that it shouldn’t be the week’s free item, it is available forever.
---
Good job, do not keep hacked items. It's not worth risking your account over such a blasphemous ring! Nice way to humor up the discovery btw :D
---
This really can be an amazing community. Sure, some people are douchebags but it is such a small amount of people that it doesn’t ruin anything for me. The sheer number of good people outweighs the bad in massive numbers. Glad you found some of the good guys. 👍
---
If you did write tos's as you claim, you certainly wouldn't be complaining about having to read one, as it's contents are extremely important, so go troll somewhere else.
---
I'm starting off on pc after switching from xbox
---
Legendary chicken?
---
I had to destroy the tuba. It was making me insane when they played it. I also got rid of Beckett. Annoying AF.
---
I need like a explosive shotgun with a terrific prefix, but if I don't get it, my Furious is perfectly okay.
---
Now all I do is just get my daily gold bullion get my mr fuzzy tokens and log off
---
I'm level 131 and am so bored lately. Not sure what to do other than chase rare plans. 😩 I miss playing the game and having actual quests to do.
---
Just close the damn doors of a player camp after you visited it
---
I'm giving you my good luck
---
Last time I ran all of them they all counted. During the last legendary run I always ran both and they always worked, as far as I could see.
---
Cranberry relish adds 10%, well rested adds 5% more
---
Other food/drinks that affect XP like canned meat stew or cranberry juice will cancel and replace the relish with the lower value, maybe that’s what you were thinking of?
---
The only way you get a bigger value out of the relish is from running a mutation (I believe it’s herbivore?).  Then you can get it to 20%, and I think maybe it gets pushed higher with the herd mentality perk active. I wouldn’t know as I don’t run the mutation or the perk.
---
Whatever you are going through - I hope things get better. Everything will be ok.
---
vast majority of weapons are shite...
---
Yeah I’m thinking the only thing I’ll want on my commando berserker is the chemists backpack. Otherwise I won’t grind on that toon
---
Oh I'll be fine thank you I'm just recovering from a big hurricane
---
My first run was like an hour and I was salty the whole time lmao I was around your level, I'm just a heavy build so I had a gatling. The part where you have to replace the mainframe cores was the worst for me as you can repair them instead of going on a stupid scavenger hunt for them but I had to get out of my power armor to use the tinker bench and I'd get annihilated and I couldn't find all 15 no matter where I looked lmao
---
&gt;-15 to all SPECIAL stats
---
FTFY
---
If the condition bar is so small for your weapon, what is the level of your weapon? If its at max level your condition bar shouldnt be so small.
---
That's all I've done so far. I've got 2k+ bullion on that toon and no ideas on how to spend it.
---
Yeah, and as I recall it you can still fairly easily outheal the damage with stimpaks, assuming you're not getting hammered by other enemies. Though I usually tank them with a vampiric gatling laser, instead of wasting stims.
---
The only possible thing is maybe daily ops are too hard as a berserker and having a suit of ss to use for that? My berserker is on PS4 so I d  on t know how feasible daily ops are without stealth and lone wanderer
---
If you are in an event or a group and you find a legendary, let people know so they can get in with a hit. This way everyone can get a legendary item.  
---
Do not assume that everyone wants to lose their rads, if you have perks to remove rads from teammates, turn them off when you join a public team.  
---
Try not to walk in front of another player while in active combat, this can kill some players with explosive weapons, or simply waste their ammo.
---
Do not kill brahmin you find in other player's camps, it is rude.  
---
If 2 or more players are dropping items and you are not part of what is happening, give them space to do what they are doing, when they leave the items are fair game.  
---
Decontamination arches should be out of the way, or be attached to a power switch as to avoid removing player's rads or mutations on accident.
---
If you already have a holotape game do not pick it up, you cannot get doubles.  Instead either leave it for someone else to find, or if someone else is in the area or on a team with you, guide them to it.
---
If you are considering starting an event like Encrypted, A Colossal Problem or Scorched Earth, check the server, if you have a lot of low level players (below level 50), maybe save the event for later as these events need decent firepower to complete. 
---
Be Excellent to each other.
---
Once you hit 100, completing the dailes should give 1 perk coin and the weeklies 2 coins
---
The INT boost has a max, as do all other stats that are boosted by special stat increases.  If J recall correctly, it’s somewhere around 25 INT.
---
You can see this in other stats. For example, at a certain point maxing your charisma higher will not give you better buying/selling prices. Same goes for how much junk you get from scrapping weapons (also affected by INT) at a certain point you max out how much steel (or whatever) you get per assault rifle (or whatever).
---
Generally a standard unyielding set with appropriately low health will reach these max amounts, even without associated perks such as hard bargain or scrapper.
---
About 5 days ago a Tricentennial 10 mm pistol magically appeared in my inventory. It now hangs on my wall.
---
Like Skyrim.
---
Your mic must be connected/Bluetooth connected BEFORE starting the game or it will never work 👍
---
Banning sex talk and swear words isn't progressive, it's far more linked to rigid conservatism. Either way, it has nothing to do with the game and everything to do with Zenimax ensuring they can't be sued or brought into disrepute over player behavior. 
---
Also Beth sold their soul long ago, and they sold the soul of Fallout with it, back in 2015
---
Just run down the exit tunnel that takes you back down to the mine to loot the body.
---
Aim the nuke so it's not touching V9 so you dont have to worry about Radaway every couple of minutes.
---
I'm surprised you were on your own, the scorch queen beast is one of the last few really community motivated events.
---
&gt;If you hold down the boost shortly before you hit the ground you'll be able to slow your fall enough to avoid fall damage in most cases,
---
This is simply not true. It never ever saved me or my friends from fall damage no matter how perfect the timing was. If you deemed to receive fall damage, the jp does not save you from that.
---
I find it takes maybe 5-10 seconds of exiting before the rad counter starts ticking. A good placement of the nuke and I'm clear before I take any damage. I do have a good Internet connection, so not sure if I just load in quickly and the game hasn't realised? 🤷‍♂️
---
For a boss event swap out grim reapers sprint for crit savvy. You could move other points around ... Mr sandman, chem fiend ... things that boost dps. You maybe don't need both rejuvenated and action boy/girl. Chem fiend? Maybe a rank of gun fu.
---
Also, prep and stack your consumables. Assuming you are a ballistic commando....blight soup, ballistic bock, maybe burn a magazine and bobble ... your psycho of choice and whatever else you can get to stack (calmex, overdrive).
---
Consider doing in a team, but not with them. Get strange in numbers going.
---
You don't mention you mutations, but eagle eyes ...
---
And for your weapon, prime it. Aligned barrel, forceful stock. What legendary prefix are you using?
---
The new skin for the armor work bench last week or the week before.
---
Plus I found out that the tab at the end on the atom shop is where the FO 1st deals reside.
---
It seems like you are the one trolling, TOS don't always have to be Multiple pages long to get your points across. Many of what they stated could have been summed up with fewer words "No Bullying" for instance could cover more than an entire page of the stuff they wrote. As long as they contain a clause saying it's their right to interpret the definition of "Bullying".
---
Are you on ps4?
---
I would play more of I can fast travel on the 1st attempt.
---
Between perks and armor, I've got stealth pretty well handled. 
---
He can more than hold his own facing the Queen, imposter sheepsquatch, or Earle. 
---
Daily Ops might be a completely different animal. Frankly I haven't really looked into that at all. 
---
I've been running rank two of inspirational instead of lone wanderer and haven't noticed much of a difference since making the swap. I've got 15 points in perception to take advantage of all the commando perks, 10 in agility, and 11 in luck. I'm using maxed out blocker, ricochet, and serendipity along with field surgeon, first aid, and tenderizer. 
---
I spent weeks scripping bad rolls on a level 1 mule to pull together a better than decent armor set for him. 
---
I'm pretty happy with it so far. 
---
And I'm not trying to come off as a condescending ass here, just wanting to explain in more detail. If you have any insights on a Berserker build, I'm all ears. I've kinda been winging it.
---
Shhhhhh don't tell everyone. Now I'll struggle to get my whole team in the second instance.
---
I really hate to drag real world politics into this, but this is what it feels like. It's in response to the current political landscape in the US. They feel the need to "Get Woke" so the new ToS. They really don't affect me or my gameplay any, I play solo with all voice chat off. Lord knows that if I did play with a my mic enabled in Adventure I'd probably be banned in about 2 minutes (I run a bloodied build, so I tend to die a lot and well let's say that when I do I tend to let the expletives fly).
---
Nothing says progressive and inclusive more than banning people who say things you don't like.
---
This should be higher in the comments or even in OP list. The daily login kinda-obligation will be over. Which is great news!
---
Can you use the rest of your junk? I mean, all of it is stashed in the scrapbox and still can be used?
---
You have my Bloodied Minigun
---
Simplier. One NPC that gives you those plans once the ATLAS is opened next week.
---
You dont have time
---
If you spawn outside and with the loading times etc..no go
---
Same here. I always drop stimpaks, radaway, purified water, and bobby pins. Then I have to pick it all up and chase them because they don't know what the gift emote is.
---
Unless you glitch a foundation on the second floor...
---
This might sound crazy but I think people wouldn't pay for fallout 1st if scrap boxes were included in the base game
---
I know but now ima have to go through the pain of having my stash always full of junk and bulk
---
Don't collect ore at radiation rumble. also don't heal the npcs. 
---
At scorched earth stand on a fence and constantly shoot the queen.
---
That’s the only reason I got it
---
Do you think they targeted you specifically because they knew about your videos and were hoping to get notoriety? Or do you think they were just being regular asshats?
---
Depends where you end up. If you get thrown out at arktos then no, we have only ever had enough time to get back into the event for the event rewards. If it just throws you back up the top of the mine in the waiting area then we just run down the tunnel.
---
When it's crafted it will be at full durability, but does not receive any more from intelligence or armorer - so you only have one bar to break through :/
---
OH my GOD you saint.
---
Wait you can't redeem whenever? So I cant get collectron?😖
---
Indeed
---
You'll be able to buy them with bullion
---
Even better than Atom Shop, they're gonna be sold by bullion vendors for 100 gold a pop in the next update
---
This haha
---
I'm still waiting for a chest roll since I bought the plan it the first week and started crafting when I can. And yet no chest (easy 80 chests later) like my actual chest so... Yay me
---
And also is it 100% you get the plan or is it just a chance
---
Yes, if your camp gets nuked, it will be destroyed, but you can repair it through your camp box. Same applies if world enemies destroy parts of your camp. You can always repair it. Just make sure to keep some junk/scrap Handy.
---
I keep holding my Atoms week after week because budget.
---
Oh nah i was mostly making a joke since this sub loves jumping on the legacy train haha
---
Both really, I am the ideal target. As I said they were griefing other players too and some friends of mine said they got their bases destroyed by these league of evil twats.
---
I dint know much about daily ops but apparently stealth absolutely doesn’t work in them.  If you absolutely can’t find stealth it may be a very difficult thing with no armor.... and enemies you can’t see till they attack. So I may not use my berserker as a breaker for them. Or I may just hug do those events on that toon
---
The cake is a fake of course.
---
Which platform I would love to help you guys
---
Thought I was the only one annoyed by this.
---
I didn't care about micro transactions in the game. I knew what I was getting into, before buying the game. Then they changed what it was. I would be very happy if they just stuck to what they said in the beginning.
---
I was once chilling in a nuke silo, waiting on my friend to join me and this little kid messaged met to "drop the bomb already" lol.
---
For sure, recently I've taken a break from the game because I finished the S.C.O.R.E thing 2 weeks ago and I'm just preparing for next season
---
Well, that's kind of a downer. I was looking forward to turning him loose on those.
---
I spent 20 minutes following a level 5 around the map to drop him stuff, poor dude was sketching out about the rank 170 that was up his arse for that long
---
This is my favrout way is to farm the blue ridge caravan event as theres one to three legendary enemy's just gotta keep server hoping
---
Have you been scripping and rolling for legendaries as well?
---
I lol'd at the named ghouls popping out after their numbers were called. The tediousness of the quest itself was so spot on.
---
Couldn't agree harder. FREEDOM.
---
yeah all trash
---
I bet Activision had something to do with it
---
It’s just as random as legendaries from enemies. Your best bet is vendor hopping
---
I feel the same. Originally I hated the grind of the legendary run but now that I'm finished... im bored af.  I've spent today just organising my vendors and stash box trying to get rid of shit... need something to do!
---
Maybe it’s something else. I ranked up once with atoms and then it greyed out. At the time I thought there must have been a once-a-day limit on how many times you could rank up, but nah - the option never became available again.
---
got no caps
---
And of course the bundle will consist by 90% of the items you already own.
---
I've been finding the Halloween costume and civil war era plans as well as trying to find the elusive red asylum outfit. Just mainly working on finding plans and stuff I don't have... Found a few pets... But I literally have no direction. Events don't seem to be happening as often and everywhere just seems dead lately.
---
Do you bulk and sell scrap? Sell any chems you have too, that’s 1400 a day right there. But yeah, everything else is random as fuck, I keep getting broadsiders and fatmans yet I’ve never actually used one, the RNG is shit
---
You have emotes. Text is toxic and fully of scam spam and seller websites. No text no spam to waste time controlling.
---
Nope. XD
---
This is why I never bothered to launch nukes after couple initial launches back in 2018. There's always someone else who can do it.
---
I still enjoyed the game up until this point
---
September 15th
---
Thx man.
---
What console you on? If its psn I can solo clear a silo in 15 minutes so if you want help I can.
---
just in case anyone is reading this later, the above link is the best place for this info
---
I have the respawn issue about 99% of the time in every event. I try not to die but on the rare occasion I do I have a trick...
---
Make sure youre in a public team with someone who's in the event.
---
FT anywhere close or to v76.
---
Go into your team list in social and click on person who's in the event and FT to them.
---
You're back in the cave.
---
You can also use this method to get to the fight if you've missed the timer *and* there's 7 people or less on the event. If there is 8 it won't work. I do this all of the time and it's great!
---
True that.
---
Really couldn’t agree more. I use grenades extensively and my biggest complaint is the detonation time. We definitely need a cook feature at the very least. The bouncing it pretty ridiculous as well but the physics of this game in general leave a lot to be desired. I think we’ve all seen the bouncing SBQ.
---
All mines are good for is selling to vendors. They should detonate immediately or after maybe one beep. I don’t know who figured giving an enemy a 5 count to walk past it was a good idea. Anything outside a nuke mine is pretty useless. A shame really as I enjoyed using mines in previous games.
---
&gt; Banning sex talk and swear words isn't progressive, it's far more linked to rigid conservatism.
---
2.2 You may not create any name, text or chat that negatively references a 'Protected Category' under applicable law. These include any name, text or chat which references or includes age, race, disability, sexual orientation, national origin, pregnancy, religion or gender. 
---
Banning any type of speech in general is progressive. Christian conservatives do frown on what you mentioned, but they strongly disagree with legislation contradicting the constitution.
---
I've been thinking that myself (re events)... i thought it was just the servers I've been on... but events seem to be few and far between... why??? 
---
Yeah nice idea. I basically live in my rocketgirl outfit and I think I have all the plans I need... so now I'm just twiddling my thumbs waiting for people to drop nukes haha
---
Wait so does this mean my camp, which is themed as a drug store because I sell chems, is now gonna get me banned?
---
EMP (?)
---
Start saving
---
Obligatory Cake day!
---
Sure is pretty though. 😍
---
Hmm. I thought it was on the news page when you log in.
---
I'm used to currency and faction grinds, time gates, etc, from other MMOs I've played. I don't love them, but I understand why they're done. But, IMO, the legendary run grind kinda burnt me out. I felt like I was just logging in to do random tasks rather than do a few dailies and then play how I want to play. I know I didn't HAVE to participate in the run, but... well, I did, until I just didn't want to play anymore. I'd rather see more end game content like dungeons, raids, and that sort of thing. (And a freaking text chat so I can actually communicate with people, since I have issues hearing at times...) Faction and currency grinds are alright to me as long as there's other content to support it.   
---
As for the atom shop, I know I'd spend more if it wasn't on some rotating catalogue, because in other games that's exactly what I do. Where here I just sort of think, well, maybe the next thing will be better. Or, I don't need it now, but maybe a month later I would buy it for a camp I'm building. But I'm not the type to buy everything just in case, so I end up not buying it at all.
---
Emote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; An actual text chat. 10/10. GG. /s
---
Yeah. Text chat would include all those who don't want or can't use a mic for whatever reason and I really don't see why some people feel the need to argue against it.
---
I was very happy. Buying a game is like an investment for me, have to talk it over with my wife, has to be a game I can play for long enough to justify the money spent. Also our currency are a lot weaker than the US$, was like 1:15 but the cost of living was 1:7 (I think) so a 60$ game cost me a lot more in food value than someone from USA. Also I don't care to much about cosmetics, and they said we would only pay for cosmetics... Lies all lies. 
---
In my opinion the content we got was good.
---
I only started about a month after the Legendary Run started so still have armour and stuff to try to get. And that's my end game by the looks of it. 😩
---
Who knows. The daily updates make it impossible to tell.  I empty my scrap box every time it changes though. Still need one of the heavy metal armor plans.
---
Wasn't there a note with " welacome baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack"?
---
I was busy and missed out on the couple of days where you could get the collectron. I had looked forward to it for months and months. Just about done with this game now.
---
YOU SIR ARE DISGUSTING BECAUSE YOU ARE DISCUSSING A CONSPIRACY THEORY YOU ARE NOW BANNED BANNED BANNED BANNED BANNED BANNED BANNED **SUPER DUPER FUCKING BANNED**
---
Same, I work as an RN in a hospital, and it's been busy af, worked 4 days with 12 hour shifts each day, so literally I get home eat, shower, and then go to bed. Hopped online after  my shifts only to  realize it was a 3 day window to get the BOS collectron after my friend told me 😑 was super disappointed bc it's like the only good reward from the BOS event. Honestly every week I want to play this game less and less, just cancelled my fallout 1st bc it's basically just a constant I wonder what the next thing bethesda will do to shit on us, a workbench for a F01st reward for the entire month like seriously? And August was a heart bed! Anyways went off on a tangent lol, but it's just bc this game is such a love hate relationship, and I'm super close to ending it lol
---
For what it's worth - it's pretty useless. According to the terminal I can set it to make Xmas gifts, but no, it continues to accumulate near worthless junk.
---
They literally spent three decades campaigning against gay marriage. Millions of them support locking up protesters. Being prudish and restrictive is a conservative trait. 
---
Zenimax insisting its users do not treat its other users like shit for being black or gay or pregnant bothering you is one of the most fucking stupid things I've ever read. Especially given they're trying to cover themselves legally.
---
The santatron setting only collects toys atm, it won't collect gifts until the xmas event is live.
---
I  didn't care about micro transactions in the game, infact I was happy that I would get new content free. I knew what it was I was getting into, before buying the game. Then they changed what it was. I would be very happy if they just stuck to what they said in the beginning.
---
Do you do runs through Whitespring golf club? One run today got me 5 Legendaries. I'm scripping them all to get to the 1000 scrip limit before the Vendor sale that starts on the 10th. That would be your time to beg Mama Mmmrgh for your new heavy gun.
---
&gt;It occured to me there's a possibility that we are deeply undereducated on this topic...  
---
As if this would ever stop people from complaining.
---
I've been trying to explain to people for years now that all of these systems that make collecting atoms/caps/scrip/bullion/score/etc tedious and requires them to log in every day isn't a "problem" that Bethesda is going to "fix" because people upvoted a thread on reddit.  It's all functioning exactly as designed in reinforcing behavior and setting schedules to make sure they can retain players for longer.
---
I have first on pc and could let you use my server tonight if you still need help. Pm your ign.
---
I was busy dealing with some irl things too and unable to log in for just a couple of days ... I had looked forward to that collectron for months since it was datamined. Feel properly back stabbed by Bethesda's shady policies by now
---
Did you do the Biv daily every day? 1 month is a REALLY long time
---
I only spent atoms last season because I started about 6/7 weeks late. I managed to get to rank 70 before paying up and using the atoms to get to tier 100. I hate having things incomplete
---
I prefer nukes being launched at the queen, cause it rewards repair kits at the end
---
I work out between NW games, if they cut queue times I’d do less reps and my gains would suffer
---
The rewards should just straight up be added to account, just like the mountain scout uniform
---
So happy to finally find a Tenderizer plan on someone's vendor today. Now there's a chance of a legendary drop.
---
No it's an opinion get it straight
---
Oh thanks. Good to know.
---
I literally accidentally moved mine earlier today😭 took me a few hours just to get everything back to how it was 😂
---
We’ll pack lots of stimpaks!
---
I replaced the original hard drive, yes.
---
NO YOU GOT **FUCKING SUPER DUPER BANNED** SO SILENCE FOOL
---
except you need flux to add a jet pack
---
Fallout 76 is my most played game currently on steam and Rimworld is Second. I doubt it’ll happen but it would be pretty damn awesome if it did.
---
It is the 4th (last) tab over and does not display progress or even mention the fact that you even get stuff back for donating. 
---
My point is if they really tried to market the current event happening in FO76, they really dropped the ball on this one.
---
Event based stuff have the advantage of public event notifications as an additional alert for players. This one sort of becomes forgotten after you first speak with Dorsey. I'm not sure if it's even a misc quest or has a listing :/
---
Except endurance when you have health
---
I meant the mods in 4 if you had them in the inventory as mods, you can switch them out
---
Exactly what I want to say, but much better worded.
---
About the server issue, they can just allow us to host private servers on our own machines.
---
I'd need friends for that
---
Lol. That's the plan!
---
True. But until it's broken my build is screwed. 
---
It's a tough call.
---
I assume X is intelligence and Y is a modifier? you know what happens in those gaps like from 15 to 20 ?
---
The jetpack is the best piece of kit for all non-PA players. I have an odd bug that prevents me from taking any fall damage, making it even better to use.
---
During SBQ it gets really laggy and I have flown up to 600 metres and landed without losing health.
---
Scrap his bar and rebuild it.
---
How do i "check the server"?
---
You do it doesn't state it before you purchase the bundle but once the transaction goes through it doesn't cost the full price it happened to me with the contemporary House bundle, I purchased the walls first but still wanted the porch, Sonu had to get the bundle and it was discounted
---
Why don't you vats shoot them?
---
I’m sure it has content edited out to fit the governments narrative.
---
It is a job because the challenges aren't fun in the slightest. I hate the battle pass idea. I want my atom challenges back. Those were easy to knock out or just ignore. They weren't a part of my game unless I needed atoms for something. Now this stupid battle pass is a part of my game because I don't want to miss out on the rewards :/
---
When you think about it, combat shotguns have the exact same model as the fixer and combat rifles. We should be able to equip their skins too, like the dark matter paint from the last seasons run
---
Could there be a true winner, be cause the true winner will be with who lost because ONLY GOD NO WHY!
---
Not a fan of 3rd Person, but I guess that would be a work around.   
---
Prefer my dot to still be on my scope though..
---
I also hate it when he dies whilst I'm being swarmed with wendigos and I then can't find his feckin corpse.  He needs to stop disintegrating.
---
Benefits of herd mentality without the herd.
---
The only thing that gives the disparity are legendary effects.
---
Backpacks+deep pocketed give you +110 carry capacity. Calibrated Shocks on your PA give you +100 carry capacity. Hardly a ridiculous disparity.
---
Even perks can be covered - if (like me) you run barbarian and evasive, neither of these work in PA. So you can replace them with travelling pharmacy and thru-hiker. This is why I go with chemist mod on my backpack - I can replace barbarian with something more PA appropriate. Less PA stuff in Agility.
---
+15 strength from full unyielding, 20% reduction on weapons, ammo, food, etc .... now the disparity comes into play.
---
And with that, different types of fish, like the nuka quantum fish that could be extremely rare and obtainable as a plaque on a wall
---
Why was it rightfully his, unfortunately not the case until the keycard has been accepted
---
I'm so glad there isn't one
---
Just...yes.
---
Playing fo76 and complaining about it is akin to ordering actual poop at a restaurant and complaining that it tastes bad. How anyone can enjoy this game is beyond me. Fallout 4 is already so removed from the original concept of fallout. Adding multiplayer simply loaded it into a cannon and fired it so far away it can never get back to anywhere near what made fallout so great. I hope they never make another game.
---
WILSON!!
---
A big fear is that mods will only be allowed in private servers. So mods will be locked behind a paywall. And unfortunately we really need an unofficial F76 patch mod. I'll bet the unofficial patch is one of the most downloaded mods for all previous beth games.
---
Scrap box. So, my character was a rifleman with shotguns as secondary, then shotguns got nerfed int to ground. I went with melee instead. Then with the PA disappearing bug I tried bloodied melee, was to OP, so I did bloodies unarmed, then bloodies rifle and commando, now heavy weapons. I have some pretty good weapons I don't want to get rid off taking up all my stash space. The scrap box would be a huge deal for me, a game changer. After the last Mumbles sale I was stuck at the rusty pic for a week, scrapping 3 legendaries a day.
---
It's an extremely clever, but  annoying and repetitive method of getting people to play their game longer and seeing as every company is implementing it it's turned into a market of "play our game"; Everyone is saying it but you can only choose one at a time.
---
I had a tap dancing Albino Deathclaw once. 
---
Got stuck in the death animation and was just hopping back and forth from one leg to another with both arms stretched in 'jazz hands'
---
I did the Mothman dance beside it for a screenshot but didn't think to record the evidence.
---
Yep. Benefit of Australian time zones
---
And to think that some people I was having a conversation with a few days ago thought that this was a terrible idea makes me laugh
---
Why, because I don’t need some internet random telling me why I should or shouldn’t play a computer game? Did I ask for their opinion? Thanks, but I’m a big boy and can decide these things for myself.
---
Well from a poor (poor compared to you) person, I didn't care about micro transactions in the game, infact I was happy that I would get new content free. I knew what it was I was getting into, before buying the game. Then they changed what it was. I would be very happy if they just stuck to what they said in the beginning.
---
1) don't tell me how to play my game  
---
2) don't tell me how to play my game
---
3) don't tell me how to play my game
---
4) don't tell me how to play my game
---
5) don't tell me how to play my game
---
6) don't tell me how to play my game
---
7) don't tell me how to play my game
---
8) don't tell me how to play my game
---
Drugs are bad mmkay?
---
Enjoy your grapes. I like the BOS electron just for the stuff he says, but he also picks up stims and circuits.
---
You'll come back crawling for that sweet no sneaking spray of lead death that is heavies ;) is hard to choose though, commando is really nice i just prefer running in and firing without care
---
Earle seems to drop fairly decent stuff and you get a second kegendary a few times for completing.
---
Time to feed your tamagotchi.
---
Now thats efficient posting! Love your work.
---
If you are on PC, PN me. Did a solo run yesterday and had an easy time with it, despite my character not being remotely optimized in any way. Can hook you up with the weapon I used or just go along.
---
There's the nuka shin challenge. Strip naked, take a shine. And make it back to 76. Only using what you find along the way
---
that's why you can't have it for free
---
When out of the vault, head for the cranberry bog at level 1
---
Oh and don't forget about the limit... i think 3 per day or something
---
Taking the fish out and cooking it XD
---
That idea is very mad max of you
---
Look what I have created. I, have made fire. FIRE!
---
🥺 nooooooo
---
1. It drops next week, the 15th.
---
2. Its a nerf to all builds/prefixes. It's to better calculate damage and won't really effect your play style. People are just mad they won't be able to insta-melt an endgame boss.
---
3. I don't use magic weapons and hope someone else can answer this.
---
4. Grenades and heavy builds/heavy weapons very much solid viable builds/guns etc. 
---
5. Bear Arms and Fixers drop from the Purveyor if you have obtained the plans already. Not sure about the ripper, never found a legendary varient myself. 
---
6. Even if you haven't contributed to Atlas you still get rewards from the Atom Shop, unless you missed the limited time to get them. Nothing special in all honesty. 
---
7. Caps for scripts? Can you elaborate? 
---
As for tips, I'd say watch Angry Turtle on YouTube, he does build videos, always up to date on new info regarding the PTS, fixes etc, what's coming next and is very informative all round on most things in game.
---
Yeah I totally get that and I wouldn't want them to remove it! Just reduce the sheer amount of it that we have to endure, as currently it would take 10,000 years to complete the game haha.
---
Would just be nice to have a little more freedom than constant waiting about
---
Ok, so similar concept then? Go from point A to point B just naked and without a weapon. Sounds interesting. Definitely going to try it out
---
4. Yep, unless... Well a miracle occurs. Also floater grenades are probably then new to you? Ps. Also crap and annoying to drop.
---
As a lotr fan, this is now my favorite post on this sub. If anything like this ever happens to you again... if by my life or death, I can protect you, i will. you have my fixer.
---
&gt;Nothing says progressive and inclusive more than banning people who say things they don't like.
---
This is one of my biggest problems with this. It shouldn't even be a political issue. Mandated speech is dangerous and I hate seeing it in my video game. Everything else you said, I agree with.
---
My god Assaultrons are just straight up broken. It was non stop blasting him in the face
---
I nuked with Charlie  less than 24 hours ago, I was trying to input the code from nukacryot, but the GUI for the bumped just exited. I tried to do it again and a message told me the code was already entered. 
---
Never hit a digit.
---
Nuked Morgantown, and the place was littered with dead glowing ones that did not respawn. In my private server.
---
...
---
Definitely not!
---
Yeah, I've been spending most nights server hopping looking for a good event. Usually spend 45 minutes doing that, get 1 half decent event then quit
---
Can also be done as a race if you have a few friends around.
---
I'm not familiar with the scavenger challenge. But probably similar haha
---
I'm just taking a break for a bit. Level 385, 1.3k hours in. This week will be a good breather. I'm looking forward to the new content coming up.
---
Am I missing something? If you’re being sarcastic that’s fine I just really don’t know
---
According to Bethesda it’s just the game getting better.
---
Is that new? I just reopened the trade menu to buy more when the PTS first opened.
---
1: I have no clue but its either next Tuesday or in 11 weeks
---
2: there are nerfs but I don't know any details on which specifically
---
3: yes there are some magic weapons. And even hacked weapons that don't get deleted. Some LMG are broken and so on. Most magic weapons are LMG. A different example of this is a Legendary wedding ring. If you find one, don't take it, it will get you in trouble.
---
4: if you mean Fat mans/auto grenades, those aren't that common. I sometimes see a missle launcher but other than that not many heavy explosive weapons.
---
5: only thing I know is that you can only get those weapons from an event when you can craft them.
---
6: as far i know, you don't get less rewards eventually when they arrive, the rewards you get now were decent, and we also got a collectron (robot that collects junk).
---
7: yes, you do get caps, scrip, and such from The Legendary Run (battle pass, next season it has a different name).
---
Tips: try to look at what build you have and how it stands up to the new enemies, because 'fire damage' has been added and almost to no armor has a damage resist for that, so when you encounter 'flamers floaters' your gonna burn to a crisp if you god a low HP build.
---
Also (if you haven't already) go after the new main quest to vaul 79. The armor plans you can buy there are really strong compared to other things like Marine and scout armor.
---
Yes yes yes!!!
---
When does season 2 come out
---
Look at the map.
---
It hurts every time...
---
I personally think they should be 50 bullion at most, but as other said they can be bought from bullion traders.
---
Hmmm I thought it announced, but I could be wrong. Im just on console
---
Didn't even have to pick a fight with a giant.
---
I'll do it once I get home from work.
---
**I FUCKING TOLD YOU THAT YOU GOT FUCKING SUPER DUPER FUCKING BANNED AND YOU MAKE AN ALT! YOU HAVE BEEN FUCKING SUPER DUPER FUCKING CUNTY PISS BANNED!**
---
Turn on pacifist.
---
My go-to is cream and rubber lol
---
Spoiled bio fluid also works great too!
---
So it's half of bullion's intake per day for +75% exp for an hour. Daily Ops here I go. I guess.
---
The scavenger run is basically just get across the map starting with 1 weapon and 1 magazine of rounds, only using what you find when you run out
---
I felt kinda bad when I started my secondary character because even wearing the outfit you get for finishing season 1 I got a ton of low level gifts and just felt like "y'all are too nice, especially when my main is lv 150"
---
At least I didn't have to feel as bad when leeching xp since I was getting babied anyway lol
---
All you snowflakes asked for this now use got it yet use still complain about it
---
Why did you drop that. Cmon.
---
Rights &gt; Duties.
---
Hopefully still has Proletariat mode, only thing keeping me alive .
---
No G3 Handmade skin,
---
I'm dead inside
---
You can use Empath with Strange in Numbers and Class Freak in a group to get close to the same defense boost. You're missing out on the AP Regen, but Strange in Numbers boosts so many other mutations the AP regen can be covered by eating a quick meal with Herbivore while being in a group.
---
With the updated TOS? Don't think so.
---
I think 50 would be the right amount for them, butI guess I can't complain too much? Out of all the multiplayer-centric aspects of 76, the lunchboxes have got to be my favorite thing.
---
This is incorrect, the reason you saw 20% instead of 25% at one point was because Strange in Numbers was not equipped/shared.
---
I must be using chinese 2nd grade bloody handmade and expired drugs then...
---
Strange in Numbers is the perk that boosts Cranberry Relish with Herbivore from 20% to 25%
---
And always remember to try to get 300 more if game get an update on Tuesday. The patch usually resets Smiley.
---
Or who don't enjoy chatting with random people.  Or who have kids sleeping in the next room.  Or who have adults working from home in the next room.  Or...
---
was that on PS4 by any chance a day or so ago?  I saw a random nuke on the wrong fissure site.
---
I think I just found a use for my "Your the dumbass" note
---
Do it while you can. You have 6 more days.
---
I had one last week, came to my camp in stealth mode did not know he was there until I got a thumbs up emote, just being nice I returned the gesture, he then showed himself and proceeded to throw around explosive bait, I was just about to fast travel to SBQ and when I got back my camp was f\*\*\*\*ed up, I remembered his gamer tag so I just blocked him, which I do with anyone who wants to be a prat
---
I kept the watch.
---
It’s just headgear
---
Right! Thanks for the correction!
---
Might be, depending on one's degree...
---
huh, i was wondering what happened to my old camp awhile back
---
Oh deer, now we are the synths.
---
Even better the entire marketplace of vendors will be people dumping legendaries just to dpare up stash space.
---
Do your own thing, like the others say, but if you could share a perk card (assuming cha is high enough) it's appreciated.
---
Forget Canned Meat Stew. If you're a Herbivore (mutation) make Cranberry Relish. If you're on a team (which you should be, even if it's a team of one) it gives you 25% bonus XP. If you're a Carnivore, use Tasty Squirrel Stew.
---
Yeah recently found out the pipe revolver does better damage than my 50 cal hunting rifle
---
If I’m not mistaken, its in the next patch or two. I believe they were testing it in the latest PTS.
---
For just $13 a month  all your stash problems can magically disappear. 
---
It just works
---
I heard that it kills you when landing so have avoided it, is that not the case anymore
---
I dont know wasnt the explosive bait glitched fixed? I tried it today and it didnt work against an annoying trap base.
---
that is because the other other players you have been raiding own the scavenger collectron, which has the options for junk and scrap. By the sounds of it, you only own the raider and BoS collectrons, which is why you dont have the other options.
---
Maybe you have so much junk saved up already you wouldn't need anymore next 10 years?
---
Sep 15. It's not like it's a secret... https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons
---
Get it to lvl 50 cuz if it is lvl 45 you are gonna get lvl 40 weapons
---
You'd also be getting level 40 weapons. Just get to 50
---
I just checked, you can keep buying as much as you want by backing out and opening trade again.
---
So nice! Ugh.. I don’t know how many people I’ve scared the crap out of trying to give them stuff... had maybe a level 10 near my base (ash heap) and he was ready to rip somebody up; took cover and drew his weapon the poor guy I was like, ‘not gonna kill you, you need anything?’ Of course heading my voice from the rough-looking schmuck that I run as is probably pretty laughable. Heh of course I ran into one person, they didn’t know it was multiplayer I gave ‘em some goodies and wrapped up an area mission so they got some stuff and exp. you can run into some not-bad people then ya get the odd ones; had one shoot my guy and startle me, I flipped on my mic and gave him an earful with what I refer to as my ‘parent voice’ like dude, if you didn’t shoot me I was gonna offer you ammo but you just wasted your ammo on me! Ran off pretty quick from my lil level 60(or so) self. If you’re on PS4 feel free to inbox me I can see what I’ve got that might be of use to you.
---
Thanks. 
---
7. Scrips and caps daily limits.
---
Grrrr that damn spring bundle. I just want the roof pieces. I already bought a few other bits separately at release. =/
---
I loved the hippie allé rhe first week at launch...
---
Now I hate her... lol
---
7. Scrips and caps daily limits.  
---
But I would be really surprised if they raised the cap.  
---
Anyway thanks. On this weekend, favourite sons of Appalachia is comming back ! :)
---
I think backpacks are probably the reason they don't.
---
Plus the jetpack doesn't show on my SS at all until I get into power armor and back out again
---
I would play more if at the end of the week you can either trade in your completed daily's or weekly challenges for score points or Atoms. I would play more if they fixed RNG to where I got a better chance at things unlike now where I got a better chance of seeing bigfoot riding Nessie. I would play more if they aloud mods so the real heroes the modders can fix this game. I would play more if you can pick a faction and kill the other factions. I would play more if thought was put into the atomic shop items i.e why do we need two freaking Classical music juke boxes and not some mini quest where we find records and be able to choose what gets played on said juke boxes. I would play more if they removed the perk card "Frog legs" from NW as it had ruined it. Oh and camp budget, pets, faction companions at camp.
---
It's absolutely ridiculous that a PA iconic to the Enclave gets no black paint.
---
I would be delighted if there were more tunes. Also, if you're playing an instrument in Crater, at least one or two NPCs should feel compelled to join in for as long as you are playing.
---
Sorry to hear this.
---
This is one of the reasons I always recommend to not use steam for fo76 :/
---
Lately I've been doing 2 kinds of nuke run challenges with a couple of people I team up with from time to time.
---
1) 3 people, 3 silos. The one who launches first wins a set amount of flux. 
---
2) 3 people, 3 silos. All launch at the exact same moment. 1 at FSP, 1 at the WS and 1 at Morgantown or around the Pumpkin house. (Queen + Violet / Fluorescent + Yellowcake / Cobalt.)
---
Probably only interesting for bored high levels but it can be fun. :)
---
The idee is great. I just wish they can tone down the popups and sounds a bit, feels more like an amusement park and not a post nuclear role playing game.
---
I know it's inevitable at some point, but I really fear the day I come back to my camp to see my  deathclaw Muffin brutally murdered. He's a good boy.
---
House by the Nuka factory IIRC.
---
Daily limit for scrips is still 150 and a 1000 at the same time in your inv limit. There's a new currency if you havent played after wastelanders, that has 200 daily limit and a 5k total at the same time in your inv.
---
I thought we did when I logged in but it was just the other long term stuff I haven't claimed yet. 8 billion wood for 40 atoms. Wooo -_-
---
OP is nuka crypt
---
He was in no way hostile and you come along being a passive aggressive baby. You sir, are a twat. You posted publicly on an open forum, the very nature of it invites people to share their opinions. Are you an idiot or just genuinely a bit slow?
---
Put a skin on those weapons .)
---
If you put a atom shop skinning stuff hides it from trading
---
The season has only just finished, where we got a lot of free items, atoms, scrap kits, lunch boxes etc. There is a short break until the next season begins, where we will get more free stuff. And you are disappointed because we are not getting free stuff in between? I've been holding back on these "no more free stuff/Bethesda bad" posts but seriously, c'mon. We are still getting free items, brother hood collectron, emotes etc.
---
I sell them real cheap.
---
Plans value is:
---
1-200c = sell at 1c
---
201c and over = sell at 2c
---
Jet pack plan = sell at 100c
---
Anything I think hasn’t sold in weeks = sell at 0c
---
The reason I don't like micro transactions is because the people who spend the most money on them (the "whales") are also the people who are most likely to cheat or hack. They have this "do anything to win" mentality.
---
It means that banning cheaters causes a the company to lose money. Generally companies don't like to invest in things that will make them lose money.
---
Also part of me dies a little inside when I think of how much more content their could be in this game that has been out in the atom store instead of placed into the game. The game would be that much fuller and gunner as a result! 
---
As to what I'd prefer. Paid dlc/expansions. It means that if a company wants to make money, they actually make the content worth it
---
I know that. It's at the bottom of the post. I'm not going to have skins for every weapon you know. Some don't even have any
---
How much .308 do wendigo spawns drop during the colossal problem at this point?
---
I think it's more the hole package, we managed fine before 1st. But having all the 1st features is very convenient. What I really want to see is an item bank shared between characters. I have several perfect armor pieces I would very much like to transfer between my character because they fit there build perfectly.
---
If Earle (Wendigo Colossus in the Monongah Mine) has been nuked already, drop a nuke on the Queen. It'll spawn Earle again as well. Two for the price of one.
---
Stupid question? Are companies legally allowed to change TOS after you payed for a product?
---
See, it’s not us being nice, we just need stash space... kidding btw
---
source?
---
If you have the plan 'Plan: The Fixer' learned, then you have the chance of getting one in a event as a reward.
---
Have you tried hopping to another server?
---
Fair point. It all comes down to what you said. The value isn't there. I won't repeat what I said earlier about betrayal and all that. I 100% agree that if the the value is there, we get what we pay for, there isn't an issue. However, £100 a year for what players have been asking for since day 1 is still abit if a middle finger to players. The main thing is, as you said, the game is not polished enough to be worth all the extra costs since so much of the game either doesn't work or is bugged. It's like buying a faulty product in a sense.
---
Anything that keeps her off the workbenches is a plus 😆
---
GG
---
They have just reset they need time to find the right codes I think they are still last weeks codes
---
I like this idea, would be nice to have a lock button for items too. Items locked work the same as skins.
---
So I’m a twat, idiot and potentially a bit slow for not needing their unsolicited advice? 
---
Been playing since beta, have over 3000 hours in, maxed all my toons, caps, gold, legendaries, etc.
---
Am taking a break since finishing the last season, waiting for the new season to start. Don’t want to burn out.
---
Pretty sure I understand my own motivations for not playing at the moment. But then again I don’t need to explain them to Reddit. In the same way I don’t need Reddit to tell me when, why and how to play, when I don’t ask Reddit.
---
So by all means go hostile and call me a twat, if it makes you feel better but know that your opinion carries as much weight as the person who offered me the unsolicited advice. None, basically.
---
And with this I’m done with this conversation. Thanks for playing.
---
I was at a camp a while ago where the player put her guitar on top of an outhouse. She was just standing there. Had to take a pic.
---
And my rolling pin
---
what about ap?
---
Guess my game i screwed up in someway, because it has always worked for me.
---
Should've called it "My precious" before taking the pic.
---
What's a modern MMO where text chat isn't dead or toxic? Sincere question.
---
Yeah i've tried it on 3 servers by now
---
Player vendors will be full of garbage in upcoming weekend.
---
To some extent this is true.  I did some spring cleaning a few days back.  Found a random level 50ish player on the map and dropped a suit of ultracite, t60 and x01 for them.  All suits fully modded in different ways.  Also gave them around 30 fusion cores
---
I needed to make space and I haven't used any of these suits in hundreds of levels.  No idea if they wanted any or took any of them after I left, but that's like 120 extra pounds of stash space for me lol.
---
I have like 3 mule characters so it’s not a big deal
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Support
---
ThE leAGue of EvIL seNDs theIr ReGARDs. That sounds so stupid it made me laugh.
---
But the precious!
---
That would violate rules as it is griefing
---
See, I don’t mind the concept of a battle pass in particular games. Like, in Apex Legends I don’t mind the battle pass because the daily challenges are stuff I’m probably going to do just playing naturally. (Hell, play two games is a daily challenge every day. Easy.) Stuff like get six kills, knockdown people with shotguns, outlive X amount of people, whatever. It feels natural to accomplish these. Fallout’s pass did not feel that way to me. I remember having to build six doors or something like that one day. I did it. It wasn’t hard. But it’s not something I’d actually do while just playing, you know? A lot of it just felt like a chore to me. And sure, it was optional, but eh... it just kinda left me not wanting to play.
---
It's on PS4 too.
---
Agreed. My mate rolled a ss uny ap wwreduced piece on his vanguards build. He's very, very annoyed he can't transfer.
---
Even though not everybody noticed, that's a really good idea for indicating that a character is an alt. I'm going to steal that.
---
That a Good Question? What About a Player Trading on purley soul.
---
But thats the PTS. Can't really take that a full face value, right?
---
If they just made a set of plain color paint skin for all weapons, ALL, people wouldnt be able to request your explo plasma, your fixer and your handmade all the time...
---
I wish I had an explosive plasma lol
---
If it works on PC it makes sense it would work on console. It didn't require any modding or 3rd party programs, its just a glitch with the blueprinting system.
---
I'd have nuked their camps.
---
If you're on PC, use the [Save Everything mod.](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148/)
---
(Alongside [Perk Loadout Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124), which I can't play without anymore nowadays. No, you won't get banned.)
---
because they're the ones forcing a lot of the banwaves and they want to feel justified so they bash the system rather than take responsibility for cheating and breaking terms and conditions. Fucking muppets
---
I remember a trap camp designed like that. A big sign telling you not to kill the cow. It’s corpse sets off the room and the people inside die
---
To expand on your idea a bit would be nice an option of higher and lower though
---
* Stash your scrap ASAP, never bring it to an event.
---
* Don't complain about thieves when you die at the SBQ.
---
* Don't instakill the SBQ on a public server.
---
* Don't force players through the decon arch just to get at your vendors.
---
* Don't have a Brahmin when you have shit in your vendor.
---
Yes, similar to when you set a  price for an item and the person can tell you why they declined it
---
Your father could use some of your resilience
---
Just sell them?
---
Yeah this happened to me yesterday as well haha took em out, but still what assholes
---
I’m sure you got something you could trade for one, there are plenty of them available lately.
---
Just like they did with PAs we should be able to get the simplest color skin for all weapons, even for a DCG, just splatter a few drops of paint on it and boom, painted and hidden from trade menu.
---
I love skilling in games so unfortunately I can’t say no, time to catch some 3 eyed fish!
---
Wait are you kidding? I donated too but hadn't gotten back on. That's so stupid.
---
AmmoPoints.
---
If you're on XBox, I have plenty of ammo and stims I can give you. Only ever launched a nuke once, but if you want back up clearing out the silo, I can help with that too. Also have 1st, so if the absolute worst happens and one of us is somehow kicked from the server but the other stays, he won't have to worry about the timer popping up to kick him from the server as well in a few minutes. Also have another friend that has 1st as well, so that's even more insurance if a server kick happens and they've done a silo run a couple times plus also play medic.
---
Or just like in Skyrim have your spouse (ally in fo76) set up shop and give you profits.
---
Just searched and could NOT find the limit. Im sorry for the incorrect information
---
Starting an alt erased all the photos from my main. Thankfully they were saved to the PS4 library but I was shocked when I saw my alts pictures as load screens for my main.
---
"Why not use the one ring against the enemy?" 😈
---
I remember when I was first doing I am become death. It took me 3 attempts to launch my first nuke. I was a level 39 at the time and I think I beat it at level 41. People kept launching nukes getting me kicked out of the silo. As a solo level 39 spending hours to clear a silo only for it to be reset was really frustrating. I completely understand you pain. Right now I can easily solo it in maybe 20 minutes but back then it took hours
---
No, you're a twat because of your response to him. As simple as that. Flexing your playtime means absolutely nothing and does not pertain to the original comment in anyway so I don't know why you did that. Act like a twat, get treated like a twat.
---
Like in Far Cry 😁 It would be so amazing, imagine Far Cry with the Fallout Story / Lore
---
Great idea!
---
some items already popped up in the atomic shop. im pretty sure, the others will come there also. but idk when, you should check every week and keep some atoms on side, perhaps they make a bundle.
---
Thank you 😊
---
So take a break for a week. It’s not gonna kill you. Go for a walk, play a different game, do anything else. Season 2 starts next week.
---
Hmm i'll have to try this out and see if it helps with disconnects, thanks!
---
You need to be at the radiation symbol when the nuke hits. Look at your hud at the bottom and head for it
---
It has to literally land on you to get it.
---
Hopefully not so it’s all the more rewarding for those who earned it
---
So they *can* be the same item and not 180 *different* types of items. Good to know I won't have to bother picking up coffee cups anymore. ;p
---
Don't just start an event, wait for some players to show up. If encrypted, don't start it unless you payed for the card.
---
Don't one shot legendaries. (We are not impressed by your DPS, anybody can make a ones-hot build.)
---
So what you are saying is that if you work hard for something and it gets stolen from you that it is rude to be annoyed?
---
This is the reason why all my characters are men. I really hate the female hairstyles. If they made all the hairstyles unisex that would be cool. The pony top knot men hairstyle would be nice for female characters too.
---
Get into melee range.
---
Im also unable to proc magic on heavies idk. But in the end its a glitch which shouldnt work anyway. Its working on shotguns for me and thats ok since they need a buff
---
Wow that’s a great tip
---
I don’t question why there’s a limit on what you can earn daily especially after coming of the grind that is gta. 
---
If you want to have fun you don’t earn money you actively loss it because you get charged for insurance on other players vehicles. Property charges and health insurance bills after you spawn.
---
They don’t make these games to please us anymore and it should be obvious. Skyrim has remasters and ultimate Editions that aren’t needed. Why? Because they make money off of Skyrim. 
---
They see what’s profitable and run it into the ground. Even elder scrolls online had to return to Skyrim to be interesting again....
---
The magic effect will not show on the weapon stats, you will just find your doing more damage than you should
---
Thanks for the reply back, I'm hoping they do as I liked the Captain Cosmos PA in Fallout 4's Creation Club. I'll be getting the Fallout 1st soon so I'll be using the Atoms from that
---
Well, they probably found a new way then. I'm not sure what they used.
---
Really??
---
Imagine all the sadness if this wasn't hacked but properly implemented example of future update with legendary jewelry...
---
Would be good to have finger necklace that gives you rad resistance &gt;:D
---
Wait - Some of the rewards from the legendary run are already or have already been on sale in the Atomic shop? Which ones specifically?
---
The only end-game are other players. Our Polish community has seen a recent surge in Roleplaying clans - the best fun I have now is watching Children of Atom and Brotherhood of Steel folks arrange convenient time so their characters would be able to shout at each other to "stop this blasphemy". They ridicule each other to wash themselves finally or step out of these tin cans, and they then thank each other for the session and arrange next date. An infinite goldmine of laughs.
---
F76 is a sandbox that's greater value is gifted to us by other players who we share it with. Socialize or start building a community. I haven't finished almost any of the non-main-questline of Wastelanders, barely finished the Legendary run missing multiple days, and yet my F76 planned-fun-list is infinitely long still ^^
---
I saved all the scrip rewards from the legendary run in anticipation for this sale. But when I checked just this morning when we were already past the point of no return, we were still missing about 12 million leather. I claimed all the scrip rewards and bought multiple rolls in fear of losing them when the next season dropped. I had planned this for weeks, only to be played like a fool by their auto completion.
---
Throwback to when the overseer fell into the fissure fighting the behemoth xD
---
Yeah I was seriously suprised aswell like I said I bought the walls but wanted the porch, and it didn't brake the full amount of atoms, I'm going to say that when your looking at the stuff in the atom shop it's game wide as in everyone see the same thing but when you actually make a purchase in then becomes  personal account only
---
ISILDUR!!
---
If the legendary run was an indicator, in the last week they'll be giving away SCORE.
---
Don’t one shot legendaries if there are other players around. People who do that think they are special, which they are... but not in the way that they think.
---
Checkout FAQ channel here:  [https://discord.gg/7fef733](https://discord.gg/7fef733)
---
Probably you are talking about the getting out of map glitch.
---
There's another way to do it (and much easier). Just google photo mode glitch.
---
They said all items will be in Atom shop if you missed them.
---
There are loads of scenes in the game that appear to show suicide. Skeletons sitting in chairs holding pistols in one hand, all slumped over. A specific example is near Helvetica, the big building on the outskirts. Upstairs in the kitchen there is a table with skeletons, plates, and rat poison.
---
Don't fix the missle launcher at Line in the sand.
---
I get you.  I usually do the angry face thing after first time and hot swop to my Tesla rifle in front of them (tagging clue). Some don’t care, others get the message.
---
seasons faq
---
[https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons) 
---
 Q: ARE SEASON REWARDS EXCLUSIVE TO SEASON PROGRESSION, OR WILL I BE ABLE TO GET THEM IN OTHER WAYS?
---
A: Cosmetic rewards are limited during a Season to players who earn them through progression. Utility items, such as Lunchboxes, the Ammo Converter, and Chicken Coop from Season 1 have been added to the Gold Bullion store to give players another chance to claim them.
---
My memory, and some googling, says the drop rate is between 2 and 10%.  
---
I can't be more specific because there was such variation in the numbers. Perhaps a data miner has a better answer, but between 2 and 10% is not inaccurate.
---
Vendors tend to be server based, not character based.
---
This means that even if in the live version of the game you can't simply go out and back in to get more, you will definitely be able to get more by server hopping, just like you can get more than 10 legendary modules by changing servers.
---
totally with you. finished season 1 like ten days ago and since then i just did some vendor hoping. im far away from having everything i want but i have absolutly no probs dowing anything (beside earle....) so im happy. now, im just waiting for next week to have a look at the legendary perks, scaling mobs and the real result of the damage nerf. since last week i got into thps again with the remaster, so im still grinding :D    
---
in the end, yes, its absolutly ashaming that they dont have anything for us to do in between the seasons. just turn on back the old atom challenges....
---
Don’t think it’s as high as 10% but around 2% feels right
---
yeah we need a big ol hillbilly beard. Dirty unkempt and long like down to the chest long. I've been playing the same male character off and on since beta and there's no razor to be found in the wastes so I've given him as big a beard as possible but it's not that long and looks too neat he should look like an old timey hillbilly
---
Ehi I'm done for good with the game, but I used to troll people with a broken mutation unarmed build with unbelivable mobility. You basically position yourself carefully when they are shooting something so you get hit once, then you oneshot them. It's still feasible? I think I logged in once in June and killed a few pepes like that, so I think yes, but I don't have the game installed atm. Try it next time ;)
---
https://bethesda.net/en/document/code-of-conduct
---
toxic gamers can really suck the fun out of games :(
---
Horde events.  
---
1. Tag the main legendary 
---
2. kill the adds.
---
3. Wait for adds to start respawning and kill them. Eventually, some will start spawning as legendary. You can farm this event for quite a while just killing the adds. When bored, kill the main legendary and finish the adds.
---
4. Be attractive
---
5. Don't be unattractive
---
6. ?
---
7. ?
---
8. Profit
---
i definitly saw the chicken coop. dont know which anymore but there were some.
---
I can help you guys if you're on PC. Just let me know, sorry to hear what happen.
---
Caps might have been raised, when did you last play
---
‘-‘
---
Consuming honey, lemonade, cooked (ferral?) Dog, mirelurk all help to boost this. (Honey might be the best momentary best.
---
10% drop chance, provided you have finished the Lying Lowe quest. 0% otherwise.
---
Wait, so they were selling the chicken coop for atoms and its also being added as a bullion reward? wth?
---
Good to know. Somehow i didnt even know that perk existed.
---
Both these guys are wrong, just walk to ground zero after it launches and has landed. Worked for me
---
I had the best experience doing that event last night with like 5 other players...total strangers and every single time a legendary would spawn not only would we all let one another tap it but people would motion emote so we all knew where it was! Killed the event as well. Felt hella gooood
---
Why walk away at all? Stay and pick up all ammo/junk from Wendigo bodies (and kill more of them) for the 2 minutes whilst the timer counts down to zero, and the game will eventually go black with dust and boot you out of the mine back to the start.
---
I played it 3 times already with once using the keycard from the quest
---
SWTOR.
---
WOW.
---
Yeah becausw fuck deaf or mute people. You abelist
---
3-4 months ago.
---
Me and my friend always try to do that but some people are little loot goblins that wanna watch the world burn
---
Maybe u/ladydevann or u/valseek can answer this and maybe give an incentive to keep on logging in?
---
People are assholes
---
Wow, but this is a good idea, we should be able to find this as an in-game item ;)
---
Good luck with that. We've been asking for different jukebox music for ever.
---
Actually, I'm pretty sure legendary enemy's and the purvayer get slightly different loot pool, I could be wrong tho
---
Hey man if ur in ps4 I'd love to help out to bring him back to the game!
---
Definitely...or have some insane legacy that melts them in one shot
---
Shit happens, it’s part of the game. Ever played RUST ? You’ll run away screaming
---
Ahhh, I see, the cap hasn't changed
---
 Its a nerf to all builds/prefixes. It's to better calculate damage and won't really effect your play style. People are just mad they won't be able to insta-melt an endgame boss.   
---
Not true, some may be upset by this. I am old, have a busy life and the last thing this game needs is yet another grind. Now on top of all the other issues, we get to grind for ammo. There is no evidence they dropped health of enemies (or the concomitant damage they do). The enemies are supposed to drop ammo, so that may help but a lot of people who are upset are that way because the nerf makes the game more onerous unnecessarily.
---
I have legacy’s but I don’t use them for uranium fever I just shoot it once or even punch it and wave people over
---
Good, hopefully they fixed it. These bugged weapons killing the end game bosses in seconds is ridiculous.
---
All currently avaiable events, right ?
---
That Legendary perk works better than just having the cards equipped, with it you automatically hack terminals or pick locks. 
---
I agree with OP saying certain cards should be passive, this is the first fallout where your choices in skills aren't really permanent, why block the use of certain ones behind a timer? Imagine if perks like scrapper or travel agent made you wait 30 seconds before it worked, doesn't that sound silly? But that's about how long it takes to change the cards... 
---
You should just gain the benefit of non combat/survival cards once unlocked. 
---
Or, they could make it so the S.P.E.C.I.A.L has two tabs, one for Combat/Survival and one for Passive/Quality of Life. This way if you have 15 strength, you could use 15 points of combat/survival cards and 15 points of Passive/Quality of life cards. Both tabs would constantly work, this way you don't even need perk load outs.
---
Imagine the pain of getting a god roll as lvl40 rather than its max of lvl50.
---
It’s a fun event when everyone does it right! Hopefully you get a good one in next time 🤞
---
No worries from me friend i jus like collecting stuff but thank you for you valuable comment!
---
R u really saying, “please don’t ruin my exploit”? 
---
It’s not an issue if you don’t try to exploit the spawn point. You want to exploit events, do it on a private server.
---
There’s an issue where some energy weapons screw up events for everyone, leading to extreme lag and horrible pixelation. This is not one of them. Otherwise let people choose their own build and weapons.
---
I have a furious one and love it. I was surprised to see that it was still classified as a rifle. I'd use it all the time if it didn't use a ton of ammo
---
You had no idea what you were getting into and they didnt change anything.. the atom shop is what it was in the beggining, purely cosmetic not "New Content". Wastelanders was "New Content". The Atom Shop had nothing to do with gameplay/game mechanics and it still has nothing to do with gameplay/game mechanics. Bethesda never promised players that as long as the game exists you would always get free atoms, but they did say however that the Atom Shop would only be cosmetic, and guess what it is? The only people that bitch about the Atom Shop are the people who are too cheap or too poor... If your too cheap then you shouldnt play games that rely on micro transactions to generate revenue. If you cant afford $5 to spend on an MMO but can afford the internet to play it, you need to rethink your life choices. But none of that matters becuase the atom shop is purely cosmetic... Which makes the only people that hate on fallout 1st members and the atom shop just that... fucking haters. *drops mic
---
Lately the tent placement is not working at all for me. I've tried all sorts of spots. I even photomoded someone else's tent placement as an example and replicating that didn't even work.
---
Photoshop !?
---
Yes this!
---
Sometimes I may move it forward like half a metre but the problem is I don’t realise till I’m like halfway through my build that it’s in the wrong spot.
---
Ikr, very annoying. Just use vats I guess?
---
Does this help with the texture streaming? Growing tired of all the texture pop ins (or textures not materializing at all!)
---
I tried that dozens of times. Never worked. I finally got it accidentally when someone nuked my camp while I was home.
---
Td did I just read lmao
---
Hmmm. Weird. Every one I've been to has all three bots working away.
---
Shoot I’m sorry dude..
---
Yep been saying this for ages like I can manual swap them out to make the most of all the perks but it’s such a waste of time. Want to build change perks, want to farm change perks, want to make ammo change perks... none of these things affect combat so it doesn’t matter.
---
&gt;That Legendary perk works better than just having the cards equipped, with it you automatically hack terminals or pick locks.
---
I am aware of that. My point was that you get the +3 to lock pick and hacking just from having rank one of the perk on. If you want to auto-hack/lockpick anything about a level 0 terminal/lock you have to spend perk coins to rank it up. I see most people just using the rank 1 version of the perk.
---
You know Season 2 starts next week, right?
---
I hope so and u bud
---
I don’t understand either as it’s the whole point of the event to fix/protect the mining bots. 
---
It’s not happened to me before. You are doing nothing wrong. Enjoy 76.
---
Wait, did we not unlock the purvayer sale ?
---
Yeah there is a week between seasons where we have no dailies or weekly quests.
---
I got this one when someone nuked Foundation, I was standing at the very top and the nuke basically landed on me, don’t know if how close I was had something to do with it
---
It's been in the game since beta.... I think at this point bethesda just doesn't care.
---
Nobody tell Bethesda im going to say the fuck word
---
I’m on PS4, but I will try to do it really really fast I guess.
---
If anyone does the exploit whikst im at the event out comes the Q2515. You wanna be a prick? Well guess what. So can I.
---
"No cheats involved "
---
Heavy doubt. Is there any way to contact them and have them destroy my camp? Im too lazy to scrap everything and wanna see if it makes it easier.
---
Block them!
---
I like the loot goblin term
---
I love it.  Constantly producing ammo of your choice.  Look up the raider rep glitch with rocksy.
---
If that's what you took from what I said then there's no convincing you otherwise and no need to explain further.  Good luck enjoying any online game.
---
What did you read please do tell?
---
By the time you get enough raider reputation legitimately to buy the ammo mation you'll probably have enough materials or caps to buy enough ammo so you'll never even need it. 
---
It is worth it if you put it in your camp and forget about it and don't rely on it for all your bullets. It is not worth it as your primary source of bullets. It can be used to create decent hauls for the ammo converter as well.
---
There is no quick way to level raider or settler reputation that is not exploits. Other than that it takes literally months worth of logging in every day and doing the daily.
---
Definitely, seeing the spring bundle again I want the roofing but I already have other items from the bundle
---
It seems too! here's a few issues I still experience using my solution. 
---
1. Drifting (almost mirage like) Textures when gazing around the mire. 
---
2. Sails on boats (Which there arent many) look like mirrors, they pop in and out of existence. 
---
3. Random FPS drops (Usually due to the environment like grass) 
---
Even though there are some downsides, I recommend trying my "Hotfix". It's an improvement and allows you to experience the game with less lag and fps problems than at 1080 default.
---
I’ve never understood this. Who’s carrying their trading stock around with them???
---
I am so excited for the new patch. So many new additions, so many possibly broken things. mmmmmmmm.
---
I'm on xbox, it's been on there for awhile. It seems it's becoming more common though, brazen even. Total lack of enforcement of rules in this game. Unless that's why they put out the TOS again, a cracked down is coming. But after the last one I doubt it.
---
I think it's worth it,  even though it can't make all ammo.  Sadly rep is just a daily grind. Make sure you do both crater and foundation dailies. Have your charisma high enough you can talk the raider into paying for the stolen goods from vital equipment.
---
Sorry to hear that...But till now, I don't know there can be more than 1 team in the silo.... I thought it is instance only for your team....And it is so cool to have a dad to game with!
---
Banning homonyms?
---
Sounds like they’re about to add text chat and are trying to get in front of the Chinese government’s inevitable concerns.
---
YE OK THANKS FOR TELLING ME WHAT TO DO HAVE A NICE DAY MATE!!!!!!!!!111!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11111!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!!!
---
This is fantastic! Now I'm going raise my prices just in case people want to leave free fertilizer and toliet paper. Times are tough!
---
No idea.  Team of griefers maybe
---
Right but I wouldn't put it past the devs to timegate something that was a reward from the previous season.
---
There are people like this for all Legendaries in all events. It is my biggest gripe with the FO76 player base.
---
People run bloodied and hide, cherry pick the Legendaries and ignore the rest of the mechanics for the event.
---
Guided meditation - sit atop the wall near the spawn points, kill all the Legendary foe and leave us to fix the hubs &amp; mop up the bone legendary.
---
One violent night - sit on top of the roof, pick off the legendary foe &amp; ignore the making noise part.
---
Radiation rumble is probably the one exception as the gouls come quick &amp; the staff we are protecting can not be fixed or revived.
---
In the past if this has happened, I’ve gifted some Legendary items to the lower level players &amp; happened to launch a nuke near the asshats base. Other than that, people will be entitled arseholes what can u do?
---
Yes, and I am sure that OP knows it, too.
---
It's the general problem of having nothing to do in this game because there is just no endgame.
---
Some of us will finish the seasons rather fast and then there's nothing left to do.
---
Other people have posted these ideas and with better notes.
---
Where's yours Samwise Gamgee?
---
I completed it last night and got a 3\* Cursed Shovel
---
Yeah I get what you are saying. On the one hand many of the stipulations make sense. You shouldn't incite hate or racism and all that. On the other hand it smells a lot like censorship or at least a reason to ban people that have a different opionon. Especially the conspiracy theories part is a bit too much.
---
What exactly is a conspiracy theory? 
---
Like we all know Epstein didn't kill himself. Can we get banned for writing that in our camp? 
---
What if a "conspiracy theory" is based on science but contradicts popular opinion?
---
Also, don't fix the missile turret. I've heard players get reamed out for that in chat.
---
Probably twats.
---
Hmm.. I just have to donate glass will get this benefit??
---
two years and people are still complaining about uranium fever? wow...
---
i tell you a secret: the enemys are lvl 40, so all they drop is lvl 40 aswell - literally worthless items, there are also way faster, easyer and effective ways to obtain legendarys to scrap or use/trade etc.
---
how about let players play their game and stop trying to tell everyone how you would like them to do so? you act like you want, and that's ok. but let others also act like they want. welcome to the wasteland...
---
oops by the time more people arrive I have usually already repaired the thing in case I have to solo the event
---
What a bunch of absolute spuds lol. "the league of evil" fucking clowns
---
Depending on the ammo type it can either be not that great, or churn out enough ammo that you will hardly ever need to craft ammo anymore.  If you use 5.56 it pumps out 200 rounds in just under an hour.  Depending on what you are doing in game and your build, it may spit out more than you use if you rock a handmade.  I have not crafted 5.56 in months since getting it, and use my handmade a ton.
---
Stuff like .308 and especially 50cal is super slow though.
---
I pick up everything.  'No junk left behind' is my motto.
---
Thanks I just looked it up I’ll try it tonight I also found that if I tell ward that I’m donating my reward to foundation my rep is going up quicker although they don’t have anything I want...
---
And my barbed cane
---
hah sorry, my bad here
---
Now you can get two times her shit...!
---
😊
---
This. Or give you the option when you enter to allow others to join.
---
I saw a camp that said Epstein didnt kill himself lol
---
What asshats there are..
---
If you’re on PS4 and need help for the SBQ Battle on private server send me a PM i‘d be glad to help
---
People are hoarders and after a couple years have piles of stuff they don't need, that has no value to sell, but they still can't bear to just drop. Eventually they have so much it's necessary to make some space because the game keeps giving more...maybe now they have 75 cleavers from hours AFK at meat week to save for a rainy day. They seek desperately for a low level player to drop them a bounty of things, the seed for that player's personal burden, but so many run in fear, not trusting that this kind stranger wishes only to be benevolent. And then they found you, and they were relieved.
---
And sometimes people just like to help out where they can. I'm more the first type.
---
Thanks for the replies. 👍
---
My favourite weapon is a furious  handmade and 5.56’s are exactly what I need thanks 🙏🏻
---
Because they use it maybe?
---
My fav answer so far today on any sub reddit I've visited. Have an up vote u beautiful person 😆
---
Auto 38 is p hood, bolt action on the other hand...
---
Look, if you’re trying to exploit the game, all bets are off.  If I’m at line at the sand, I want the event rewards, the rest of the stuff (XP and loot) can easily be had elsewhere.  
---
I don’t have to play nice with everyones “let‘s exploit these events and milk them for everything we can.” Goes along with everyone tagging legendaries.  Honestly I think the biggest change Bethesda could do for the game is simply make it the individual or group of individuals that does the most damage gets the legendary drops.  Not shared with 10 people at an event.
---
Or just play the event as intended.
---
Im crying when high level players doit
---
Only because you've read just the title.   
---
There's West Tek where mutants were created - might be still usable.   
---
There might be another hidden location where ghouls can be created.
---
Not sure if related, but I had entered a server, did some IRL stuff and came back 10 mins later to find a nuke was about to land on my CAMP. I'm over near the dry lake bed, so absolutely no reason to nuke that, but it covered two CAMPs including my own. Hopped out fast, not knowing if I was already too late and maybe they had nuked it already in the 10 mins I was away.
---
As someone else mentioned it is poorly worded in some parts. Conspiracy theories could come under harassment, misinformation, using online reputation to manipulate or even being insensitive (claiming 9/11 to be fake or whatever could upset someone who was a victim of it for example).
---
Leader of the pack spawns 3 easy Legendary wolves, the resulting horde task doesn’t (strangely). It takes 5 minutes to run, you pick up 4 random legendary items (3 from the wolves and 1 for completing the event). It’s random what you get, but all Legendary drops are. I trade them for Scrip and take my chances at the pick. 
---
All Horde events are easy and give you a Legendary with little effort. 
---
I’ve not tried the Tag and release approach, someone else mentioned to horde events, going to give that a go.
---
It won't cover your ammo consumption, unless you are using sniper rifle and even then it's iffy , but it is nice travel to camp and get a few bullets out of it. Worth it IMO.
---
Feel free to share.  :)
---
Well if they continue to target you just report them. Under the new T&amp;C isn't that kind of griefing breaking the T&amp;C?
---
Are you guys on pc? If so, I’d be more than happy to help you guys blast through a silo.
---
What about crafting 200 copper swords to get your Blacksmithing to lvl 15?
---
Had kind of the same thing happen to me I was running my 3rd launch at lvl 80 somewhere and as soon as it was ready to launch i died and someone else ran in and launched it instead, since i wasn’t on the I am become Death quest i wasn’t really pissed by that. I was pissed because i had just wasted nearly all my ammo on a high level silo.
---
Earle can still be solo killed in Patch 22. Follow Through will make up for the damage reduction
---
I would spend 60 caps fast traveling to get a 5 cap bounty.
---
So, what are the 'known'* ways in which people can grief camps and is it possible to defend against any of them?
---
I'm still a fairly new player, and I have had my camp destroyed a couple times (I re-locate every couple of days now anyway). Always just thought it was a random enemy doing it but this is absolutely terrible...
---
Like it even matters when the Scorched always just spawn in right on the sonic generator... It's not a bug it's a feature!
---
I saw that in a camp actually
---
The only thing I don't know is if the production rates will be adjusted at some point but so far they haven't since the thing was added so it's probably going to stay.
---
The machine does have a max amount it can hold depending on the ammo type, 200 for 5.56.  Make sure to head to camp once every hour or so to empty it out so it keeps producing for you.  The rate is something like 200 every .96 hours.
---
I think they may have been to cover the “unexpected” release of atoms in 76 &amp; crowns in ESO last week.
---
Bloodied has nothing to do with it!  Most times it’s magic weapons.
---
I've read this before and the statement applies to me pretty well:
---
If you're at Uranium Fever and people wait until everyone else has been able to tag, stay on the server
---
If you are at Uranium fever and people are behaving antisocially, change the server immediately
---
Hence the reason it's obviously not legit - nothing in this game is that well balanced...
---
It depends where the camp is for the explosive bait to work. A camp near Vault 76 has no creatures to attract.
---
Thats why I don’t understand the loot goblins at this event, but some just like being a ass.
---
#Nice Day Was Had
---
Why is this post marked NSFW?
---
XBOX has a shitload of newer players because they have 76 on gamepass, though its really not weird to see low levels on PS4 too (checking our trophies shows that only like a quarter of the playerbase made it past level 50)
---
It happened to me too the guy literally shot out my whole camp. I was defending a team mates workshop which was next door to my camp against waves of ghouls and somehow it turned into being contested without me noticing as I was just chatting away to my friend. I just walked away back to my camp but he followed me and shredded it..lesson learnt it cost me a lot of resources and time to repair 🙄
---
Upvoting for increased visibility.
---
Honestly, I've been playing everyday for the past month with the exception of this last week.
---
To find out that I won't be able to claim the BOS collectron is a punch in the gut to say the least.
---
I poured countless hours and atoms into the legendary run to make sure I completed it in time and now it feels like I'm being punished for taking a much needed life-break from the game.
---
I mean I'm still going to be no-lifing this game for the foreseeable future but it's just so damn unappealing to see how my time just isn't valued at all. :(
---
BRC outfit is hideous. It’s like it was designed by a colour-blind person.
---
I'm not at that level, could you elaborate, why don't I want to open card packs? Esp. with legendary mods upcoming, there should be something to do for your cards, shoudn't it?
---
Norwich as in Norwich UK? It wasn't me but it might have been my mate who started playing properly recently, was his tag "TimelordMD"?
---
groan
---
Yeah, let's none of us express controversial opinions ever for fear that someone's feels will be hurt.
---
If you build your camp near vault 76 they can’t nuke it &amp; there are no wild animals around for the explosive bait to work.
---
Most “trap” camps I’ve found are placed there to stop retaliation for their toxic idea of a joke.
---
I think they want to make a Thunder-Poon.
---
I’m with you. I rarely find myself wanted but it’s harder to get yourself murdered than it should be. Most people don’t want to go through the trouble of turning pacifist off. I’ll find someone, turn around and squat, execution style. Going around slasher style might make people just think you’re a jerk, who knows.
---
here are the drop rates:
---
- if you dont care for the plans at all and join encrypted randomly chances are 100%
---
- if you spend caps and place the recall keycard yourself and desperatly need the plans drop chances are -1%
---
Check the various gold bullion traders (vault 79, foundation and the crater). On the pc PTS  they have some of the stuff from season 1 for sale.
---
I really hope after the update that player camp damage is perm disabled.  With jerks like this and the max lvl npcs constantly attacking bases after one wasteland drops...camps are gonna get slaughtered.   Having camp damage serves no purpose...hopefully this is something that gets fixed.
---
I’ve been playing it off and on since release. Definitely my favorite MMO. It absolutely takes some adjusting, though, if you’re coming from wow, for example. It has active combat, not tab-targeting.  
---
If you use twitch, I’d recommend checking out some of the streamers. They have an official Stream Team. Overall, it also has a pretty helpful and supportive community, and has one of the least “pay-to-win” cash shops I’ve seen in an MMO.
---
My brother started playing just before the event began. He quit as soon as he realised that he was missing the BOS event rewards just because he didnt log on constantly. I've logged on to claim the rewards but haven't played at all otherwise because of how shitty it makes me feel.
---
Its sadly 50% of legendary weapons and armor specifically, so modules and vault steel dont count
---
they probably saved them
---
as much as I agree with your post, ibe found a way to bypass these interrupting asshats; run the silo in a private server, get to the point where the nuke is ready &amp; waiting for launch, then quit the game &amp; log back into public, your silo should be waiting in the same state you left it in, iirc
---
I’m on xbox and I’ve been seen it for a while now.
---
more commom with each passing day.
---
dozens at a time.
---
most people dont even try to hide anymore.
---
Wait, what are you going on about?  I can’t hear you over the sounds of my Tesla  😉
---
Annoying af to find the body on the ground and people doing the mothman dance on it
---
I personally just realised I had ten of the damn things in my inventory and wanted to use them up!
---
"You're playing the game wrong!!"
---
Ugh
---
That doesn't stop them from finding your camp if they see you and know where your camp is.
---
I'll check there as well, I'm on the PS4 so I'm not sure if it'll be the same
---
Random question; does the Polish community give out Faschnact Paczki in February?
---
Meh, just another single player game that I'll beat in a week and go back to the other games I was playing.
---
We are vault dwellers and we are pretty resistant to post apocalyptic shit. Why would that change here?
---
Thanks for the warning.     
---
I'm not sure.....where are you disabling the vending machines?   Does something particularly bad happen if they're destroyed, like you lose everything in them or what?  
---
BTW, thank you for all your videos.  (heart)
---
Silly using 10 as only 4 stack now. I've got 17 currently. Got 9 from level 90 odd on the legendary run.
---
Check after the new season starts: I haven't checked if those shops have been updated yet.
---
Just wait until one wasteland when they drop level 50 items. People are spastic enough at that event, going to be a shit show.
---
The mistakes, in the way the game calculates energy weapon damage, were painstakingly pointed out to them on the PTS forums. One of the CM’s acknowledged it, and was thankful for the exhaustive detail, so the ball is now firmly in their court.
---
Then again, it’s not like they’ve even bothered to say ‘we’re working on it,’ (at least not lately) when it comes to fixing energy weapons. Preferring to just pretend the issue doesn’t exist.
---
I have no issues you play your way I play mine, if you dont like it find a new server bro
---
Definitely recommend checking this site out every once in awhil. They keep the codes updated.
---
[nukacrypt](https://nukacrypt.com/)
---
It’s not all bloodied, but some who can’t interact normally with the events without dying lots (the trade off for bloodied) and bloodied gives you maximum damage to one shot from afar. So it feels like we are working for another player, we do the event while they hog the spoils.
---
Ultimately I found someone with their speakers on and did just that. Got down on my knees and he shot me in the head execution-style. Bless him.
---
Got mine unintentionally during fasnacht while server hoping. Spawned into Helvetia dead with the trophy.
---
When i had that Allie girl in my CAMP (not th commander Daguerre) she never stopped to play the guitar with the same song.
---
Id look up a guide to that quest, the markers are fubar for the last half of it.
---
I just ignore people who want to trade. They're either after my bomber jacket or my shotgun... it's like, if these things were for sale they would be in my vendor wouldn't they ?
---
2 mins ago on my server someone has shooted from Alpha. Nucacrypt codes broken
---
I reported them of course... Yep, they are breaking the new code of conduct.
---
☝️
---
Small point about Radiation Rumble - you can heal the 4 scavengers by hitting them with a shishkebab with Friendly Fire equipped. Also works for the Free Range Brahmin and at least some other protect events. 
---
This was common at Fasnacht but folks don’t seem to do it at normal events.
---
Absolutely if anything it just makes caps (after selling in vendors) but added with the ammo converter they can get you alot of ammo quick and cheap
---
Bodies all over the floor, you dont know how they got there but you guess you must have killed em?
---
No nukes on my camp. They were all on the prime fissure and monogah mine.
---
You have no idee what I knew or didn't know, no reason to get insulting. Anyway, I was talking about the micro-transactions specifically (I mean come on, it's what your comment was about and it's right there in my reply), they said from the start there was going to be cosmetic items for sale, and I knew it.
---
There was never any confusion about cosmetics and new content. What are you rambling about?
---
You are wrong, ffs man Pete Hines even admitted it : [https://twitter.com/dcdeacon/status/1185264327428886528](https://twitter.com/dcdeacon/status/1185264327428886528). Also not only the atom shop, a fast travel tent and unlimited scrap storage aren't cosmetic.
---
I never said anything about free atoms, what are you on about?
---
They also generate revenue from sales. I paid full price for the game, (even got  friends to buy it) I'll play it as much as I want. 
---
Yea, no I think having internet is much higher priority than cosmetic items in a game. I'll thank you to keep your opinions about how other people should life their lives to yourself.
---
Where did I say anything about hating on the atom shop or 1st members? Again what are you on about?
---
\*calmly pics up mic, wipes off shit, and gives it back to you.
---
Same!!
---
How do you even play it the wrong way?
---
Yeah uk. Different person then.
---
They always pay their debts
---
A few weeks ago they switch alpha and Charlie codes try that
---
Hey, I’d be losing scrip NOT getting disappointed right now!
---
So it just hasn’t been enabled?
---
Check out: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/)
---
It was initially started (don't take it the wrong way) by "older" gamers that don't have a lot of time to play. At 35 I find I like there more.
---
Still no chat on pc.
---
Probably some douchbags who've found out away to exploit it somehow, maybe.
---
I only exp bait trap camps. Narrow hallways with displays in the middle.
---
Exploiting glitches. They're basically complaining that the fps gets borked but it's them causing it. It's not a problem if you run the event as intended.
---
Im gutted because I rejoined F76 late, and missed out on the only things from the legendary run I actually wanted.
---
It's already confirmed this will happen.
---
The silos should have been made instanced interiors, but with the exception that only one instance is available per server, resetting after the players leave the instance.
---
I thought the same was gonna happen to me on my first launch.
---
I was soloing the silo, almost had all the boards replaced, and 3x 250+ level players come in and finish the last few boards. So I'm thinking that they're gonna rush ahead and launch, but I wanted to get the quest marker removed, and they had a public team, so I joined the 4th slot... the rest of the level was a whirlwind of uber-destruction, and when we finally get to the control room, one of the players says, "Go ahead, dude! Launch your nuke!".
---
It was awesome that they let me do it, and I hadn't decided even where I was gonna drop it, but since ACP had just come out, and these folks had been so cool about it, I figured they'd want Earle. And that whole battle was totally wild, too.
---
Sorry, your Dad's run was ruined, though. I hope he gives it another go.
---
beautiful!
---
👍🏻
---
Played in teams all night. (Literally haven’t gone to sleep!!! Lol!) And you’re sooo right. The free fast travel is awesome and has helped me open up a lot of spots on the map!
---
They only reason I can see is they just wanted to collect all the ores before the enemys started to spawn but I have no idea especially cuz you dont even have to go into the mine to get the quest completion. I use load bearing for smoke breaks lol just fast travel there and chill outside then when I get back free xp and junk
---
We need Mullet!
---
Yup. Yep.
---
It's normal on private. A new player has to enter the area. That's why  every 20 minutes i go back to a nuke zone in public servers. Gives me around 40 high radiation fluids. And i think you don't have to enter a code if you been in a server where someone entered the code in that silo that day
---
Thanks for the heads up on that! I played in teams all night, and actually no one appeared to be mic’d up. But it was cool bumping into each other randomly and emoting and completing a few events together.
---
Hey if it’s weightless, I’m buying 😎
---
A ship camp needs cannons afterall 👀
---
Fallout is about surviving in a post apocalyptic America, so I never understood the point of the whole “you both have to accept to fight” thing, I mean surely that’s the point? You should’ve been able to just wipe them out.
---
In 300 hours of gameplay I've only ever had 1 issue with other players. A guy came up who was level 40 and kept constantly hitting me, got fed up and just blasted him away, 2 other level 200+ guys with explosive rattling guns just kept following me every where killing me then made way to my camp, I just left. 
---
I generally avoid people though unless it's to trade.
---
Nothing no camp budget, I cant even put plushies out i buy let alone the run board stuff.....
---
We could get fixed damage values as well - fatman kills every monster  with 1 shot besides bosses. Missile launcher being weaker but could be used in many more situations.
---
You need to put down the Fallout 1st survival tent at a certain spot outside the fence. Someone explained it the other day, I think it was in front of the 3rd gate when looking away from the asylum? Apparently a person can also stand there to do it according to another comment I read.
---
Thats great on pc. I have 12 perk loadouts totally different and in 3 key presses i have totally different loadouts. (Mod)
---
Yeah... about that... I’m 37/F. My last console was a Super Nintendo, until my BF got me my Xbox a couple of Christmases ago. He saw that I was really into Destiny 2 for a long time (and then Minecraft) and when I asked if he thought I’d like FO76, he knew I’d love it. It’s got the building aspect and the quest lines, etc., so it’s the best of both worlds!
---
Well, at least they dropped the facade of "roleplaying as raiders". Not that it makes the action any less scummy... I just appreaciate the little bit of honesty.
---
Settler Wanderer: "You ever get a song stuck in your head? I'm gonna write one of those, one day."
---
This is also probably the real reason why Sofia has those headaches.
---
Yeh, that's right :(
---
I’ve come across lots of helpful people in the short time I’ve been playing, and only once was someone a megadick. Lol
---
Wait you can get Deathclaws as pets?
---
Isn't it funny that in this alternate timeline the same songs somehow go written but other people performed them?
---
I feel you, and I've been in the exact same situation ([https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/h0lxtj/more\_evidence\_that\_yall\_are\_the\_best\_community/ftovf6y?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/h0lxtj/more_evidence_that_yall_are_the_best_community/ftovf6y?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)), other than the fact that we didn't speak to the other team, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt.
---
Really demoralising though, particularly if you been through all the rigmarole of getting and decoding the code pieces manually.
---
Yeah, they’re talking about the geodesic dome. A lot of people use it as a greenhouse.
---
I totally forgot that the mission has to be finished first. I'm not even mad I've never gotten the plan because they're easy enough to buy but damn I really don't need to rush to that event every time it pops up now
---
&gt;Correction:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;You cannot name your account after anyone who isn’t you. This is to protect people/entities from being falsely represented, or misrepresenting your affiliation with said people/entities. This works both ways, as it protect zenimax in case Starbucks wanted to sue them for a user named Starbucks being overtly racist, for example.
---
"You will not create an account name that is in reference to or contains proprietary names, popular characters, or the names of modern era serial killers, individuals or groups who have committed crimes against humanity in the past. " 
---
So how does no Hitler or Trump not fit this?
---
&gt;Role play is not dead. There is nothing in the TOS about roleplay. Roleplayers do not name their accounts after pre-existing characters (a violation of aforementioned naming policy) and pretend to be them, if that’s what you’re claiming.
---
" If you wish to involve another person's character in a story or role-play scenario, please respect that individual's wishes and get their permission first. Failure to do so is considered "god modding," and is not allowed. "
---
Once again, how does role playing as a group who wants to role play not fit into this statement from the TOS. It's pretty clear. If you role-play with players who you have not asked their permission it is against this TOS.
---
&gt;Griefing is not defined, or even mentioned in the TOS. Stalking and harassment is, and it’s clearly defined. Taking advantage of bugs and exploits is mentioned, and is prohibited. There is no vagueness to be had, as the topic you claim has the potential to be abused by zenimax was never mentioned by zenimax.
---
The vagueness is in the fact that this game has mechanics that are promoted and commonly done that can be concieved as griefing. People on this sub complain all the time about pvp like players. People also post about nuking a camp for bad prices or some percieved wrong.
---
&gt;Videos showcasing how to utilize an exploit for your benefit have always been against TOS. Youtubers have plenty to talk about outside that, and most of the successful fo76 youtubers don’t even venture into how-to videos on exploits because it puts them at risk.
---
It's still in the TOS, so why does this statement matter. The bigger question is whether with this new TOS is Beth going to enforce these things.
---
&gt;The TOS explicitly states that they are under no obligation to monitor online activity, unless otherwise specified. They reserve the right to monitor your activity within their services, such as in-game and on official forums. There is no mention, even in the vaguest sense, that they will be cross-referencing their database with users posting to reddit.
---
" ZeniMax may investigate where it suspects there has been a breach of this Code of Conduct which could include reviewing other forums and websites available online which are publicly accessible. "
---
I beg to differ. Does not state official forum, states publicly accessible websites and forums.
---
&gt;There is absolutely no mention of owning two copies of the game being any sort of violation. Nor is there a listed violation for allowing your friends of family from playing on it. The closest thing in the TOS is merely a mention that you are still liable for what your account does, even if you claim you weren’t playing the game. This prevents people from trying to get away with harassment or cheating with the excuse “it was my friend”.
---
" You shall not share Your account with anyone. Joint or shared ownership or use of an account by more than one individual natural person is prohibited. "
---
Yep. No sharing. 
---
" unsportsmanlike conduct such as use of secondary accounts "
---
Oh look, reference to secondary accounts as unsportsmanlike.
---
&gt;Discussing the game with civility has never been against the terms of service, even if it leans toward conspiracy. I shouldn’t need to direct you to the official forums, or to reddit to see the number of people being critical of the game or spreading blatant misinformation with impunity.
---
" We also do not tolerate the deliberate and malicious spreading of false information or conspiracy theories about ZeniMax and its game studios, game(s), or employees. "
---
Well. This is embarrassing. I guess I should delete this post. I just made up a conspiracy theory about how Zenimax employees are padding the BOS event stats with no evidence what so ever.
---
&gt;Mods are not scripts, nor are they software. There is a lengthy paragraph that defines exactly what they mean by “unauthorized hardware or software”, and the word “mod” doesn’t come close to being mentioned. They are concerned explicitly with software that monitors and manipulates the data stream in any way. This is not just because it has the potential to allow players to bypass paying for items, but this has been a method used in the past to breach the PII of customers, and is a legal liability on zenimax itself.
---
" You are forbidden from using any unapproved third-party applications, programs, scripts or any other game modifying mechanic used to change the game play experience on a ZeniMax game, Service, forum, or other games or services provided by ZeniMax, including the distribution of said programs via ZeniMax Services, sites, forums, communities, etc. "
---
Any third party software that change the game play. Mods are third party and do specifically that. 
---
&gt;And I’m aware you adopted the “tongue in cheek” position from the below comment, but “tongue in cheek” doesn’t quite cover blatant misinformation. I highly recommend actually reading it yourself. Let’s try to approach this non-issue with reason, not inflammatory, paranoid delusion, even if it is under the guise of being a “joke.”
---
There is no misinformation. I pulled each one of these tongue and cheek lines from a specific portion of the TOS. As you can see I just referenced word for word those pieces.
---
TLDR: Had to laydown some quotes from the TOS.
---
Keep in mind that the fanfare noise plays twice for opening one
---
So what are you actually using, the T65?
---
Nope.
---
From what i hear, technically. The way it was explained to me, you use the perk cards to tame creatures by looking at them and use it on a deathclaw.
---
Havent tried it myself as i dont have those cards and dont want to invest in them.
---
Is anyone going to complain to Bethesda because some guy is going on about the world being flat? Probably not, and if they did, they'd probably do nothing. 
---
If someone got into a threatening argument over something, discovered a way to confront a player outside of the game and it became somewhat newsworthy? "We banned that player permanently as they were acting against our ToS" Like I said, they're just covering their ass. It's actually been more forefront of recent, Alex Jones being kicked from YouTube for example.
---
If anything were to become a problem, it would probably fall under the harassment section, so yes, a bit strange to include it. But at the same time, it will probably become the norm (the Alex Jones example hopefully explains).
---
My 2shot fixer does 2x2800 dmg per shot. I even have a quad explosive pipe rifle that does great dmg. 48 shots very fast. Reloading is super fast too and i can burn away my .38 rounds that i found. My prime lever action dmg is around 6k for a full andrenaline sneak critical headshot. I sometimes do that radiation event alone and get a good spot and every glowing one is 1shot. I level up 2 levels in the duration of the event. I do fail the event because i can't do the ore collection.
---
Most haven't yet realized that the pvp-trap with a wanted team member doesn't work anymore. So the wanted players just get ignored.
---
If you did every daily and weekly you would have made it
---
i thought as much, just the other day he told me a rando had given him a load of free shit, would have been a hell of a coincidence haha
---
Well i've been joining some Silo runs but only to help fellas kill robots. Also its a really fine place to farm Lead and Fusion Cells.   
---
I can't understand how people can ruin fun for others. That being said if i cant contribute to SBQ, Encryptid or Earl I'm not joining it but a lot of people are. That's a big dick move too and only because they want that 1 legendary item.
---
They said they don’t have plans for that
---
i'm starting to think the game is far worse on PC than on console
---
Mine sweeper in the bar, you gotta go round nabbing patrons drinks without getting caught or it will start a bar fight :p
---
&gt;	the people who spend the most money on them (the "whales") are also the people who are most likely to cheat or hack.
---
Source?
---
They are so cheap to make. I tried that weapon once and made some ultracite ones with almost depleted cores and get so much of them
---
Wow, did not know that, sincerely, thank you, I’m going to try that.
---
 *One Ring* to rule *them all*, *One Ring* to find *them*, *One Ring* to bring *them all*, and in the darkness *bind them*, In the Land of Appalachia where the Shadows lie.
---
This.
---
The minute I buy my plans, the next event they drop for me.
---
You can earn way more xp playing legitimately than you can from exploiting and even.
---
I agree with you here (900 hour player here). I personally don’t think the scrap box belongs in the sub though. Either have it for everyone or no one.
---
THE TAPE IS OUT  🥳🥳🥳
---
https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x7w1shn
---
? You make like 172 with a single craft and the clip is 75.
---
It is marginally helpful, but then bullion is really not hard to collect. I use it for fusion cells for my tesla which I use at events to tag as many enemies as possible, though it does cause strange shit since the last patch. Tip: build a room with no doors/windows at your camp for it and use build menu to change a wall to a doorway anytime you want access to eliminate thieves. I have an alt with 10 ammo factories that does a better job on other ammo.
---
Yet another reason I don’t play this stupid game anymore. I keep hoping it’ll get better and it just keeps getting worse
---
I played it “the way it’s intended” the other day and it took forever because the scorched randomly got stuck behind trees and walls and we had to run around like it was an Easter egg hunt, it was incredibly tedious.
---
I didnt think it would go up so damn quickly! Weren't the hat and flag around forever? This was ridiculous, I donated 5k cloth and got shit
---
The hat and banner were definitely around longer than the collectron. It’s bs
---
people pay 30 caps for those?
---
They are level 40 but it’s still scrip I can cash in
---
Me too. Never had to use it for gauss mini/shotgun or full ss armor.
---
If you're on PC i have some ammo i have some ammo i can give you.
---
Lol!!! I can now say I’ve experienced this! 😂
---
No kidding.    
---
I'm tired of typing, "All in vending" or something like that.   Getting to the point where I just ignore them.
---
Killing doesn't hurt. You got something cheap. What's the problem?
---
If you haven’t picked a good spot for your camp, maybe block them and pick a new spot?
---
Noobs like me do... 🤷‍♀️
---
I have 30 still from the legendary run.
---
Idk about mods so I won't comment on that but in any case it's not a current concern.
---
For the scrap box, I agree it's a game changer esp in the case where you want to switch things up every once in a while with multiple different builds. That being said I def think you'd be able to switch builds without needing 1st, but wanting to keep multiple builds' items like 3+ would probs need 1st. And that's my main takeaway from 76 monetization, I'm not forced to use it. I can still pretty much do anything I want without being forced to pay. It can make my life incredibly easier but I don't really need it.
---
when you put in the keycard it should give you a randomly generated password which you have to use as well as the other key to launch the nuke that way only the person spending the time and resources can launch a nuke.
---
Yea there's always some people like that, but for the most part they get a hit and wait. I've only had one twat do it, he was like level 200 and just ran around one shitting everything with magic weapons
---
Naw, I just sell what I consider easy basic plans for 1 cap and no one has ever bought a jet pack from me so I end up dropping them after a week.
---
Apparently honesty gets your downvotes 😂
---
HMU on PS4 if you’d like to learn the speed
---
run.
---
Different cookoo clock
---
But maybe it's a mule char with your dream weapon. ;)
---
I’m just curious as to the why. Like I said, I don’t lose anything valuable, but I’m genuinely curious as to what their motivation is. I know some people go into the game looking for PVP. Is that what they wanted? What are your thoughts?
---
This isn't a problem for me as my camp is small, but when a person spends upwards of 60 hours building an incredibly detailed camp, relocating isn't an option, so blocking them does literally nothing. Imagine wasting 60 hours because someone wants to grief your base and there is no way to stop them.
---
Respawning is the best
---
How do you buy rank ups on score? I had no idea I was 1200 score points from getting to level 100 on the first legendary run???
---
I just can't get the materials for it
---
Bethesda gives players zero incentive to do otherwise. Succeed or fail, these people you describe ALWAYS get rewarded.
---
Until Bethesda changes the incentive scheme, this will never change.
---
I figured I’d scored. Lol! Guess I was wrong. But what I’m really wondering is what their motivation could’ve been.
---
I don't think they ever gonna fix this game.
---
When I read the title I thought "Yeah I want text chat"... then this comment made me realize how the textchat in every mmo that has one looks...
---
the ammunition machine from the raiders
---
Yeah, was only a suggestion...bet Bethesda won’t do anything...
---
Normally just to fuck with people. Some are inventive trap camps some are just shitty.
---
You mean use the system that says 95% hit chance and still somehow misses 5 times? Lol.
---
I,ve  been playing 8-10 months and I've heard 3 people talk on mic 6 months ago, I stopped using my mic as no one responds but it is on just in case.
---
Right but west tek wasn’t a success was it. Grahm is fluke. So why would anyone subject themselfs to almost certain failure. Same with ghouls.
---
**WITNESS ME!**
---
Tbh I wish it was 😂.
---
And my Grognak ax.
---
Gotcha. I didn’t get pissed or anything. I just left that area for a while. 😂
---
? Use their trading stock?  I carry 3 weapons. Handmade. Fixer and a Q2515 tesla for events where people are being dicks. I don’t carry loads of anything. No junk. Limited chems. Lot of ammo but have bandolier. 1 set of PA and I sit at around 320. Why would anyone be carrying around weapons they want to trade???
---
* I feel like a lot of the atom shop items are a waste of their time. Some skins for example are just useless. Who needs a skin for the combat knife? Clean toilet skin, fixer skin, plasma gatling skin, laser gatling skin, ... would fly out the atom shop like cake at a weight watchers convention. Yet somebody seems to think it is a good idea to put time and effort in skins for weapons nobody uses. They're basically throwing away money.
---
* PA skins that don't work on the T65. Some look cool but I don't buy for this reason. Even though the PA's are very similar in stats, I'm not going to "downgrade" my PA to use a skin.
---
* Fo1st: I had it since it was available up to a week ago. I don't think Fo1st atom shop rewards should be increased. However, if I continue to pay for this game, I want it to run smooth. I just can't pay for a game that has this much lag lately.
---
* Fo1st: they are doing a better job advertising stuff as fallout first exclusive. That is good since it wasn't all that clear in the beginning, making players believe they're not getting anything.
---
* Fo1st: many promises were made ages ago like workshop persistency. I feel like we should have gotten at least a few or the basic versions of these promises by now. It takes so long, it is starting to feel like they lied to us again. Maybe they're working hard on it but we just don't know.
---
I haven’t had to purchase or craft 5mm in forever. (I use a 2 shot explosive Gatling) If I used a minigun that would be a different story haha
---
I think he doesn't want to search the right perk when u have 9999999 cards
---
Mix of t65 limbs and t51 torso and helmet for me. Also use my excavator from time to time for ore.  I could have transferred it to my mule but I'm obviously never going to use it after this long, so this way at least it MIGHT not go to waste maybe.
---
At the least, maybe they combined all the modded parts into something that improved what they already had or replaced what they had.  There was a lot of flux used on those 3 sets lol.
---
I can handle 2x 5seconds because i clicked too fast
---
do you think the other items are valuable enough for a subscription though? I personally don't think so. When I started and saw 1st, I was confused cause I didn't really see any value in it, but now I get the value of the scrapbox lol.
---
Just bought some t-65 and don't need it for that either 😀
---
I never understood why trap camps price their stuff so cheap and the owners get mad when you actually make it through and buy something,like if you're just trying to mess with me, jack those prices up and remove any sort of reward for making it that far, if you're gonna waste my time do it right dammit
---
I can't remember the exact location, but up near the Converted munitions factory is a small unmarked shack with distilling pot!
---
Shooting rats in a barrel is tedious. More so if you don't happen to be the person with a legacy gatling plasma. Even more so if you're melee. Glitching the event makes it incredibly unfair and no event should effectively rule players out.
---
The league of evil. My god you are top notch
---
I hate that i can't sell things that are in favourite (but has it's plus side) happened alot that i unfav radx/radaway/stimpacks sell a bunch forget to fav again and in a middle of a battle press hotkeys and think ooohhh shit
---
There is a very slim chance you'd run into them. But I highly doubt they will come to my camp
---
Yeah, there was!  It was great of you, Craig.
---
To fuck with people. The good ones lock awesome deals in a vendor if you can get by.
---
Last night I snuck through a trap and bought tons of serums for 200 a pop. And a few ultracite fusion cores for cheap.
---
When you get to a certain. Level can't remember which there is a perk in agility that prevents you from taking damage from punja, board traps when you sneak. I rarely carry much junk but when I do get caught out I like to equip it recover my stuff and drop some fertilizer there in its place.
---
I love assultrons they drop loads of good junk I actively look for them  my tse 50.cal fooks me up proper
---
On my 2nd char a sneak build with 3 strength it says something like. With that muscles you are not going to join the BoS or something
---
I guess you're a bloodied build? The gamma gun still seems to be the best option in pvp vs bloodied builds. They see your low health, they pick this gun. Cause the rad dmg doesn't get lowered by serendipity and sentinel effects. At least it once was like that.
---
Awesome, I’ll check out the site thanks for the tips!
---
Fo76 is dying and when the update to combat and weapon balances comes out it will be dead, the game is useless and Bethesda doesn’t understand fallout as the games have gotten progressively worse. Most big fallout you tubers have quit the game and the player base these days has shrunk tenfold so the people left just go round ruining others time on the game because they know it’s only a matter of a few months until the game is dead
---
Or 2 selectable colors for scout armor.
---
From the spawn, which general directron is the right one ?
---
I a tually forgot to sneak OUT of the camp and died. Owner was there I hopped on mic and had a good laugh. He showed me where the trap was and how he did it. Good stuff. I never have junk on me so I never lose anything and even if I did it'd be a trivial amount
---
Thats just the normal grey one
---
I have loads of weapons in my stash and because I dont have Fallout 1st my stash is sitting at 750/800, meaning that I can't out many more weapons in which is why I'm carrying about 30+ in my inventory and a lot of them are heavy weapons because I have bear arms.
---
When I said weapons for trade I meant weapons in general. I carry a few weapons with me just in case someone wants to buy them from me.
---
Would be cool but i changed to shielded road leathers because of the 3 agility
---
Why I'm on private server half the time ...
---
Way too many assholes
---
Crap doesn't it, I keep up with patch notes most of the time I must have missed it.
---
At max scrips i get legendary modules.
---
Stupid?  Aggressive?   Both?
---
All things being equal, Missile Javelins would be much lighter than Fatman Lances. Great idea!
---
Im down to help run the silo as well, and i know a couple tricks to help you guys conserve ammo as well. That way our friend Earle gets all the attention he deserves
---
time to sell my trash
---
That’s why people feel bored once they finished the grind, Bethesda’s poor game design leads to people habitually wanting to stop playing after finishing all the busy work.
---
Nope, the overall amount stays the same. Bugging this event just makes it easier.
---
Lol, at least with commando it's less noticeable, I feel bad for any shotguner builds
---
That would be interesting
---
Me too i have all weapon mods and serums etc. Just buying all types of power armor mod plans at this point. Then caps are only needed for the weekly 300 buillion and fast traveling
---
Got it during fasnacht, someone nuked helvetia, I think its because I was physically hit by the nuke and not just the blast
---
The chemist backpack mod is great
---
If I see a wanted player I will usually message them to ask if they want me to kill them. I ask they stash their junk and remove armor so I don't damage it and I do the same in case they decide to PVP. 99% of the time the player is grateful.
---
Don't mean the event, I mean I can make more hitting ws, then west tek, from there harpers ferry. Without any buffs. I can clear all those places before that event is even half way through.
---
yes and no they didnt put it in the barn building set, god knows why...  
---
but there are tons of not used building assets, more floors,roofs, walls, doors and such.  
---
I guess they wanted to give us just the basics to build with.  
---
here you can see some of these:  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeVqP3wZ8oo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeVqP3wZ8oo)
---
But pipe is life?
---
&gt;Take some comfort in the fact that players who do that sort of thing are usually unhappy tryhards.
---
That's what I always try to do. How miserable does your pathetic life have to be if *that* is how you get your jollies. Like, "sorry your dad didn't hug you enough or whatever, dude, I hope you find peace someday."
---
A sticky grenade would rock!!
---
How about a legendary grenade that created a new one to be thrown every 5 seconds?
---
And apparently they don't want us discussing it too much, as they removed a previous post on it that, for the life of me, I can't understand why they took that action.  
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ip1pds/zenimax\_has\_thrown\_the\_tos\_at\_me\_when\_i\_tried/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ip1pds/zenimax_has_thrown_the_tos_at_me_when_i_tried/)
---
If you sell the right things you max alot. I have a power switch on my vendors because it's happens alot that i reach max. Last time i rushed to enclave bunker to get the last mutation recipe
---
Unfortunately the perk doesn't show were the grenade bounces to
---
Maybe only solar or thorn then? But i have no need for that plans either
---
The reason I have been asking is it go's in the Atom shop it should stay and nothing should be removed give everyone a chance to have all the items !
---
Codes of Conduct or even Terms of Service are used mostly as legal and action-based guidelines for any company. Even with some of the clients I work with, they merely serve to define as clearly as possible what isn't allowed. I think before there were far too many areas allowing for public name-and-shame by people or groups, cyberstalking (which I've been a victim of), stream sniping and some others issues that have become a problem for agents to deal with. This at least gives them more of a rulebook to take action faster on certain reports by users.
---
I highly doubt that you can make as much as LITS can give.
---
Even if only 10 waves spawn in, that's over 20K in XP, way more than those 3 location combined.
---
I know this is going  to come as a shock to you epic gamer redditors, but people are able to play more than one game.
---
Going to sound like a hypocrite here as I dislike people who dupe and glitch their way through this game but...
---
I love it when people glitch this event .. we’ve been put through so much grindy BS in the past few months it feels great to get one over on Bethesda .. hell yeah I got 2 ‘free’ levels yesterday towards my perk coin grind
---
The first time I actually got one from a machine I was over the moon...couldn't believe that I had gotten one. Then I told my friend next time we were on (retired/disability so has a LOT of time to play) and he told me that oh yeah you get those over here whenever you want...I was so disappointed.
---
Of course now as a point of pride I only ever take them from the machine LOL.
---
With commando I get whole magazines wasted, the damage numbers appear but no damage happens...
---
Bolstering is only for.low health builds, and unyielding is the king of low health armor. I run a full health junkies and I run 1 piece each of troubleshooters, ghouls, zealots, and vanguard the rest.
---
Good idea but sounds a little op
---
&gt;I have an odd bug that prevents me from taking any fall damage
---
X to doubt. You're probably just using some of the fall damage-blocking gear or perks...
---
Worth It.!!!
---
And the other reason to just get the camp machine skin added grr
---
Console [Xbox] pleb here. Uh question: Who is 'League of Evil' exactly? Sounds like a bunch of trolls/kids who think griefing is 'fun'.
---
Anyways: Since the new ToS this is good news for you and everyone else, if you got video or screenshots of it I'm sure Bethesda will ban them immediately since it's a major breach of contract.
---
Regardless that really sucks that you're being targeted like that (Is it because of your videos by any chance? Speculation i know but it's a very big possibility especially nowadays)
---
But you said they attacked other players as well so I'm not sure on that one.
---
Either way i hope you and the rest of the PC players report them all and keep bringing it to everyone's attention. Best of luck to you!
---
&gt;To my understanding, its common courtesy to not enter a silo when someone else is there. 
---
It's common courtesy? Never heard anyone mention that before, maybe it's common courtesy to not steal someone's nuke when they're in there first, but there's nothing against going in a silo to help someone clear it faster. In fact, I actually quite enjoy showing up when other players are in silos since it's basically free exp from doing the silo run quest you get when you enter. I basically just show to help a bit and scoop up a little exp. Stealing the nuke at the end is the asshole move for sure, though.
---
I found a bloodied fixer yesterday.  1K caps
---
I can take of all armour and perks and survive falling off Seneca rocks. If you are on PS4 I can show you if you want.

Noice

There are other games that have implemented fishing and it is fun.  Fishing tournaments would be cool.  Not knowing if you going to pull up a fish, bones, old tire, or an angler or a mirelurk queen would keep it interesting to be sure. I would love to see fishing added to the game.
---
this.
---
i mean how hard is it to either change durability to = per shot or just ultra buff weapon durability for explosive weapons and amp their damage by reducing many enemies explosive resistance?
---
Dont bother, the game is better off without people like you.
---
They are kind of opposites. 
---
So depends on what you like the most and what weapons you’re running as well. 
---
Vanguard = full health builds
---
Bolstering = low health builds
---
Shit that’s good. Congrats
---
I only play on PS4, but based upon the comments I see here it seems that way. I've noticed an uptick in griefing a-holes recently, but they're still few and far between most of the time.
---
You should keep rolling and use what you get first . I have rolled about 30 secrets armor peices and havent been happy with any of them yet i run 2 unyielding 2 bolstering and 1 vanguard all with weapon weight reduction and most have str added . Id like the same kind of layout but ill also accept sentinels assassin if those are possible . I have 3 mismatched sent ass peices and it would be nice to come up on another 2 .
---
Explosive should probably do more limb damage
---
It drives me nuts that her humming isn't the same tune as the guitar.
---
Ignore everyone, honestly go bolstering, it's is the beat for for full health builds. Vanguards is essentially trash. 
---
I know I'll get down voted and people will tell me I'm wrong but I stand by my argument.
---
Try playing the game, all you do is complain like a child. Yes I did look at your comment feed, and all you do is make irrelevant statements and bullshit claims.
---
Also you're wrong, I've got a buddy who does it. Told him he's wasting time, both being parents and not getting much time to play. I Told him to tag along and showed him how much more xp can be gained in the time he's stood there like a lemon, with a bunch of lemons, getting sour when they don't get to tag fuck all.
---
People like you are lazy and here purely for an easy ride. If you knew the game you'd know there are many more ways to earn xp, and bigger amounts which is actually fun lol.
---
Lol! Yeah, I get it. But in this particular case, he literally waved me in as I was looking for the vending station. Weird.
---
The number of people who assume things about how this game works is too damn high
---
I think a friend does it because he's bored.   He likes to figure out things, and this is just one more challenge to him.
---
Theres a couple of interesting places actually. In the tracking unknows quest that takes you to the mire it leads you to a power tower that has a shack built half underground that a camp can be placed at. Also you follow the highway outside of watoga theres cracks all in the road and one has a tunnel thatll lead you too yet another underground shack
---
Technically, yes. But the pet taming system is full of bugs and issues.
---
Tuesday (15th) that's when Patch 22/Season 2 begins.
---
Hahahaha!! That’s funny!
---
Low
---
I have only used a couple of all those rewarded. 
---
I think I have around 38 on me atm lol.
---
Thanks.  Yeah, I was so surprised.   He had alot of great stuff.
---
While looking at the legendary run board, you should have options with coresponding keys at the bottom of your screen. “Rank up” is the option in question. On PC you have to press “R” if I’m not mistaken.
---
I wonder if they steal legs?
---
I could see that... That’s a perspective I hadn’t thought of!
---
Exaclty. I run into camps with Anti-BLM messages and swastikas regularly. But like that one guy who made the news for running "homophobic death squads" they want to sweep that stuff under the rug once ppl actually start seeing it.
---
I Sell every jet pack plan for 5 caps.  They eventuallysale to someone
---
Why in the hell should we be using a third party program just to have functionality that's been in games themselves for nearly *three decades*. There's no excuse.
---
Similar to the rewards from legendary being available for gold soon, I would not be surprised if the same happens with the BOS collectron etc..
---
I log on daily, so their plan must be working!
---
Yeah, he's a really nice guy too.   Although not one I'd particularly want to piss off.
---
On the legendary run screen, if you looked on the bottom of the screen there was an option to rank up. You were able to move up 1 level for 150 atoms
---
Son of a b-word. I completely forgot about it coming up and bought 10 legendary modules yesterday.
---
No this person is wrong only the usefull items will be put in game for gold
---
I wasn't quite sure myself and figured something in the 5-10% range, so I actually pulled up [the drop list for Encryptid](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/0046D296) and stuffed it into [akarnokd's drop chance calculator](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/chances.html?patch=P21A&amp;formids=0046D296).
---
So many things in there that should be rotating back in, or just make everything available at all times as a large catelogue =/ 
---
(I just want the rugs and wooden floors that haven't been in rotation since 1984..)
---
Can you get banned for what you name your character? I need to know fast.
---
I did a little camp jumping last night but nothing good. But I will continue to search being I hear all these stories of guys and gals finding hidden gems in vendors
---
I hope not I'd really like more closets
---
It’d be a good idea for a hypothetical “Squirrel” pioneer scout challenge. Take my updoot!
---
I do not get some of these terms as is to what is not allowed.  With all the drugs, racist terms, swearing, murder, and suicide in game, it just makes no sense.  Heck we have a quest involving a guy who enjoys a furry.
---
All good advice. Especially the angry turtle bit. He's awsome.
---
Same, haha.
---
Nope, only little fingers
---
I run a vanguards full health sneak build. 
---
I one shot everything that is not a boss type enemy. 
---
Not at all trash
---
The RNG gods seems to think that I want 15 3* chameleon pieces, and to add insult to injury, it only gives me 1* unyielding and 1* vanguards.
---
ow the edge  
---
do they all have middleschool syndrome? :'D
---
I can’t believe they only gave the girl one song. Even Skyrim did 3 lol.
---
"Then they changed what it was. I would be very happy if they stuck to what they said in the begining"
---
*Hands mic back to person thats here to argue about something thats totally beside the point of the original post?.. i think? 
---
Then whats your point?... If that wasnt a statement about reinstating the daily atoms then what did they change?... or what should they have stuck too? ... .. . ?
---
*glances at the mic and both nod in confusement, as if to say.. "what the fuck is dude talking about then?"
---
I’ll take a 1 Star uny lol
---
Vanguard has nothing to do with damage out put though, you would get the sane damage wearing bolstering.
---
Yeah. it's worth it if you're patient.  Day before, I found a civil war hat plan in one.
---
Was that on PS4? I just seen same at a camp😂
---
im pretty sure they're also changing the way legendaries drop in events with one wasteland as well tho
---
No I know. 
---
It was just to note that it’s not trash. 
---
So on top of my damage I have full health. And won’t be sneeezed to death by enemies. 
---
Like it wrote in my own comment. It really depends on how OP likes to play the game.
---
No that was on pc
---
Ouch, now I'm hurt.
---
Bye Felicia.
---
No clue at all.
---
things to do when someone has dumb-ass high prices: drop nuke
---
literally tarded
---
*Does* it work for their bottom line though?  It's clear that many companies do this kind of thing for a reason and evidence suggest it is usually profitable, but literally nothing else they have done has been competent, I would not discount the possibility that they have cocked up the monetisation of this game as well.
---
I got lucky with a guy with a super nice base.
---
I had no idea what base mechanics were, so I picked his locked water purifier, and I had no idea that it was a "crime", I just thought it was another thing to lockpick.
---
Naturally I became wanted, and the owner of the base came around the corner to see my dumbass just chilling.
---
Then he killed me, waited for me to respawn, and dropped a shielded harness and a bunch of Ultracite PA plans for me and like 25 super stims.
---
I was like level 35 xD
---
Ok, I'm still a newbie. I had two scorched come through my camp area last week ticking away with the codes...
---
So uh...what do I do with them exactly :)
---
If I come across them again...
---
Well that is pretty darn cool! Thanks for the share.
---
I have found stuff before it’s just been awhile. Like I said in a post the other day. Best thing I’ve found here in last couple months is a junkies pole hook with 40 power damage and +1 strength.
---
If non-exploited bounties actually were worth more than the pitiful sum they generally are worth, I’d kill for that. The PVP in this game is just poorly thought out (cough cough, Nuka Quantum Dupers, cough cough).
---
I love when people are creative with trap camps.  
---
Punji boards - blech.  
---
Ride on the Mr Fuzzy and get killed somehow: Hilarious!
---
Disabling the vending machines takes the camp's icon off the map. Can't fast travel to it or see it; you'd have to know where it is already to visit it.
---
Vanguards = lower DR when taking damage
---
Bolstering = higher DR when taking damage
---
Which one is better?
---
You're almost there. I'd totally skip the Vanguard's pieces (because Vanguard's really isn't that good) and add a Mutant Slayer's piece and either Hunter's, Exterminator's or a QoL piece like Auto-Stim or Life-Saving as the 5th.
---
No they made them in game items you can buy them 10 at a time at crater a lot better then atomic shop
---
Don’t forget the “Your the dumbass” note at Sludgeworks.
---
They should really let us craft with power armor on. I was in the exact same situation as you.
---
More like league of mommy is banging step daddy and doesn’t love me anymore so I’m gonna hop on my video game and be a complete douche bag . For all the hate fo1st gets for this reason alone not to have to deal with squeakers it  is worth it !
---
I'm trying to roll a decent Vanguards left arm and I've literally gone through 30 modules, not a single one, and while I did get a weightless with 20% weapon weight reduction, which isn't god awful, I'm still salty over the amount of scrip this left arm is eating up xD
---
with an Army of Floaters and Mirelurk Kings behind them...
---
I totally get you. No doubt. 
---
I’m just saying I have no problem with one shotting enemies. 
---
So does that extra damage really do anything real to your build if you can take much more damage from enemies?
---
But this is just how it is really. 
---
There’s pros and cons with both builds. And that’s exactly like it should be.
---
In the first run, you had to wait several weeks before you had the option to rank up with atoms. In the second run, you will be able to rank up with atoms from the start. Personally I would wait to use them until towards the end when it takes a lot more S.C.O.R.E. to rank up but to each their own.
---
Just can't shake this song, stuck in my head, forever..... just...why
---
Yes, it will be full of Villager
---
I've seen a player with level 6915 (!) at the caravan event.
---
Bethesda, we need a beatbox bot for our CAMPs now.
---
Okay thanks I'll check the Atom Shop then
---
Where are the bubble turrets on the PTS? there's nothing new in the turret tab
---
30 caps for a T-60 jet pack LMAO mine never sells at 1 cap, I usually end up just tossing the jet pack plans
---
Just because something hasn't worked for you doesn't mean your experience accurately reflect everyone else's, it does, or did work some of the time. Shortly after the jetpack became available I tested this by repeatedly jumping off Senaca rocks and found that with the right timing I could land safely. It's either a bug or some ridiculously small window of possibility though as the next time I logged in I died 100% of the time and then a few days later I survived about 1 in 6 times. I haven't bothered testing it since and i'm not confident it could be reliably repeated, but I'm not the only one to have jumped, without other fall damage modifiers, and lived.
---
I believe the bayonet on a dragon is no longer available but am not 100% sure
---
Would like to add to the nuka trip, you aren't allowed to use the map. Some say once, just to orient yourself.
---
I enjoy the event either way.  IDC if they repair it.
---
I can’t believe nuke silos aren’t instanced. Actually I can’t believe that launching nukes is even a objective to be sought after.
---
Sorry you got your nuke stolen, that sucks. Happened to me once a long time ago. 
---
Maybe they were sick of waiting for you to drop it; an hour is a long time in a silo (we can usually do them in 20 minutes) but they had two other silos to launch from so I think they just wanted to be asshats. 
---
I actually prefer the queen, she gives repair kits.
---
Don't waste these folks. The XP boost turns any old day into a double xp event. Armor Ace will have an xp repeatable. One note, you will be able to buy 3 for 100 gold. 4 at a time, save the rest.
---
Not really, you don't need to run at low health with bolstering armour. You can run full health, the effects only kick in when you start taking damage. 
---
So many people fall into the trap of vanguards armour without thinking properly. I run a full health junkie build, however i have nerd rage perk and adrenal reaction. That way when I get mobbed by enemies I get tanky as hell and can usually come away without wasting a single stimpack.
---
Why make new codes of conduct if they could just remove the ability to destroy others bases?
---
By Charlestown fire department there's 2 on a lake. It's right on top of the Ash heap #2 treasure map spot
---
Iirc it's 100 Gold bullion for 1 Lunchbox - so full bullion intake per day for +50% exp
---
I do
---
Yeah I have first. Big difference in junk weights. Also have 3 mules maxed out with weapons and armour in their stash. Should have a clear out really
---
They put more effort into destroying the camp than it takes to repair it. What a bunch of micro dick morons
---
In that case it sounds like you've accidentally discovered some exploit
---
I've been playing super casually for two months and have yet to encounter any PvP action. Usually I'm against it unless it's part of the lore meaning that people are *supposed* to kill each other. Like in fallout or wow where its supposed to occur.
---
I always offer to team up with them if I find someone in there, rather than steal their nuke. I have not been turned down yet.
---
I once used a recall card, and a fucking level 20 and 30 show up, start the event, and die upwards of 30 times, later into the event a couple level 200s showed up, so we did finish it in time, and that's the story of how I got my fixer plan
---
Haha just got out of the vault lol
---
Don't play during this 2 will gap, people will be bored and the fuckery will be crazy.
---
I'm thinking about harassing people with locked homes. They usually have something by the windows you can sneak in. They come home seeing you chilling in a chair in their locked house. Priceless. No more locked doors!
---
You are a genius. I never thought of that (I am new to these weapons though)
---
By the time Earl is dead, I have 300 screws and 400 fiberglass plus 500 shotgun rounds. Those two minutes are for running and surviving. It is a game: let's pretend we die if we stay.
---
OMG yes please
---
True heroes of Appalachia
---
That quote is especially ironic because Settler Wanderer literally only plays that one riff on the guitar, which absolutely gets stuck in my head.
---
I'm still waiting for the woodland camo secret service under armor paint I bought to be working...
---
If they are deaf or mute why play you can't hear anything any ways 😆
---
I use that massive amount of watoga fliers you find out there by that work shop. Works great.
---
WATOGA
---
Depends what you’re DR is. You get a diminishing return on DR over 350, and Vanguard’s will often push you way over that for little benefit. 
---
Personally, on my full health build, I mix the 2 with the objective of having my DR in the 350 to 400 range. So currently that’s an arm and leg of each, and a cloaking chest piece.
---
This 100%. Vanguard is the really loud short guy in a friend group that talks a big game upfront but abandons you at the first sign of real trouble. Vanguard is Justin Hammer while Bolstering is Steve Rogers. 
---
Bolstering is the smart pick because the more you get hit, the harder it is to take you down when you need it the most. It also means you can leverage Adrenal Reaction damage bonus for longer.
---
I’d be thrilled if I could set the ally to be quiet, or at least talk less.  Even Gramps is wearing on me.
---
I leave cream on their beds.
---
If you’re on PS4 then add me, psn is BasslineBonez, let me know what ammo you and your dad use and I’ll put together a decent amount for you both if you want.
---
You monster.
---
Thank you, nice to meet a fellow intelligent person that can see the obvious downsides to vanguards. Now the two of us just need to educate the rest of the player base.
---
Lmao dats funny props to the trolls
---
You should have just launched it, if he's in the silo it will complete for him, yeah he wouldn't have done it himself but it would have stopped those 2 from launching it.
---
thanks
---
The Legendary Run is over, but on the days you needed to kill 3 legendary enemies for SCORE, Uranium Fever was a good way.
---
Regardless of level, anyone who tries to burn down a legendary without giving anyone else a chance is a bum.
---
It's the same with the free emotes they keep adding, which are really just emotes that should exist by default for players without mics or that are deaf.
---
Why do they insist on adding these then removing them instantly? It goes against most good sales strategies as well. Free items are used to consistently lure people in. You plant a good few free, or trial, items and that gets people in to the shop and buys you good reputation with the community as they look at these and go "wow all these free things, these developers are super cool!"
---
I wonder how many people complaining about this didn't donate anything to the event to begin with.
---
Yeah, what you're saying is true.   I just get really lucky occasionally.   And plus, I'm bored.   There's nothing much for me to do until the new season drops.   I burned out on farming xp.
---
They are calles trap camps, there's this guy on Youtube that shows players getting killed and having a sinister laugh about it.. Different players go about the wasteland uniquely.
---
Get any idea of quickly increasing rep out of your mind. It WILL be a slow, agonizing grind. That said, you can do a few things each day that help with Raider rep.
---
Any time you see Raiders "in the wild", talk to them. Sometimes dialogue options give you a little rep boost. If you see Raiders in a fight, help 'em and then talk to them. They might be grateful and give you a little rep. 
---
Go to Ohio River Adventures and talk to the guy in combat armor in the biggest shack. He has a little job for you. There's also a repeatable thing here where you turn in Mirelurk products for some rep. Talk to the raider Blackeye. Mirelurk Queen meat gives you the biggest rep boost here. Mac's Farm and Cranberry Glade each have what I assume to be a guaranteed Mirelurk Queen spawn. Every time I've been to both of these places, one has spawned. You might have to run around and kill some Kings before she'll show herself.
---
Do Ward's daily for Foundation, and when you find the thief, tell them they can keep the stolen item if they talk you up to their friends. Another tiny, tiny slice of rep.
---
If you do the daily for Crater where you get the vacuum tubes, say you need no compensation and you'll get a bit of extra rep. I think the same thing happens if you use the 8 intelligence dialogue option.
---
I'm not sure if there's anything you can do with Rocksy's crater quest to get more rep than normal. You can give her the "Appalachia has a new corpse" line and she seems to like that, so maybe you get extra from it? Dunno for sure. 
---
And finally, if you do Davenport's photo opportunity quest and choose to photograph Foundation, you can take the pics to the guard at Crater and choose the option to just give her the pics for free, for another pitiful sliver of rep. 
---
If there are other options, I'm not aware of them or I've forgotten.
---
I've had it since wastelanders and I can't find a way to remove it. Not complaining though, it is quite fun :)
---
Use to serve a purpose long ago, in a galaxy far far away...
---
I just ignore trade offers.  There’s a 99.999999% chance I don’t need it or I’m not interested in giving it away if I haven’t dropped it for you already.
---
I saw the thing and didn’t get it because I thought I had more time lol.
---
Haha.. Big deal 😂
---
Yeah I can't play without it now.  So I'm locked on one character.
---
probably because there is a trap category and they want to use it on the most dangerous game. I mean what's the point of traps if they aren't used on people? ;)
---
And a 'crying' emote, I really need it
---
Peak laziness. Recoloring your Railroad rip-off a new, monetizable outfit does not make.
---
on the words of father elijah: “finding it, though, that's not the hard part. it’s letting go!”
---
There's one southwards down of Seneca Rocks, follow the train tracks. Camp device can be placed there.
---
whole point to run out is one box next to exit. but that box reward is joke.
---
You are probably correct, but it’s not for Bethesda to give incentive to be considerate. I’m not saying it can be fixed, but if the community talks about it and comes to some consensus then a more considerate culture in 76 may be achieved. 
---
Some people do this just to “grief”, others out of greed and some just don’t know any different. For the first, there is no help, but the other two may be swayed away by posts like this. Who knows? 
---
The risk otherwise is, it’s “can’t beat them, join them” then the game base won’t grow, new players will avoid events, get sick of the grind and leave.
---
they really should make nuke silos instances
---
How dare those players remain in the mine collecting screws and gaining XP
---
I do something similar but with mr fuzzy rides......
---
Where? They mentioned a few utility items will be sold, but they never said all.
---
Bethesda doesn't listen to any of this shit. Fuck Bethesda.
---
Lol did this to someone who had their entire camp locked. Used the cooking station to pull me through the window. Left some pa frames in the chairs as well 😆
---
The biggest noticeable issue with fps this far for me is the first few seconds of loading into foundation after a fast travel
---
1. It should be next Tuesday, 9/15.
---
2. Damage is being changed so it's additive instead of multiplicative.  Instead of base damage \* weapon perks \* bloodied \* nerd rage \* etc. it'll be base damage \* (weapon perks + bloodied + nerd rage + etc.).  Builds that used more, and larger, damage sources are seeing their damage drop more than others.  Bloodied should still be the highest DPS (and you get all the SPECIAL stat bonuses with Uny armor) but if the DPS difference isn't so big you might have more reasons to go AA, Junkies, etc.  We should be getting legendary perks with the 9/15 patch that will let you pick additional perks and either select more QOL or damage perks, I've heard some of those legendary perks are multiplicative damage but I haven't tested that in PTS myself.
---
3. Yes, explosive energy are legacy only and won't drop but are still tradable.  Magic weapons still exist, Angry Turtle did a pretty comprehensive video on them \~2 months ago on what they are and what effects trigger magic damage.
---
4. On the whole they're outclassed by guns/melee.  You can have some fun with a 2 shot auto grenade launcher.
---
5. Encryptid = Fixer plan; Project Paradise = bear arm plan.  I think ripper plans can drop from multiple events but ripper won't drop as legendary any more.
---
6. Since Atlas was a community event you did not have to contribute to get access to the rewards.  However, the rewards were only in the atomic shop for free for a few days after the goal had been met for that week.  You didn't miss much and will still get the 50% purveyor sale that starts this Thursday and a second meat week later this month.
---
7. Yes, wastelanders did bring a new currency with it - gold bullion.  That too has a daily cap limit of 200 per day, with a single 300 gold purchase once per week.
---
If you haven't played the Wastelanders quest I would start there.  Once you complete that questline you can buy armor and plans with gold bullion that are pretty strong, and it's new content to play.  We have public teams now, too.  They come with bonuses themselves based on the team type (building gives you +INT) and makes it MUCH easier to use team based perks.  Atleast on PC people on teams mostly do their own thing, especially on building teams.  A colossal problem was a new event they recently added, if you nuke monongah mine it'll create a public event where you have to take out a difficult boss.  If you're high enough level with a solid build and see that pop up it's entertaining to do.  It is a bit of an ammo hog, you can get ammo back from killing and looting the wendingo spawns.
---
The new patch next week should also be adding daily ops, they look fun but I haven't tested them myself on the PTS.
---
lets be honest smart trolls went extinct a long time ago in a mmo far far away
---
And "I don't speak your language" emote, I need it. For using this emote people will understand why exists uncomfortable silence between us... at least in this english language
---
No, they did not see those items in the Atomic Shop. The Ammo Converter, Chicken Coop and Lunchboxes will be available to buy for gold bullion after the next patch.
---
What the F is going on in this game man lol
---
Not for long as i have my raider camp nearby 😋
---
I installed a mod to prevent scamming. File name is idonttrade.exe
---
I use uranium fever and radiation rumble as a litmus test for a server. Project paradise is the ultimate test of a good server but even in good servers I see it get ignored.
---
Why does his followers that invaded my front lawn attack me every time they see me?
---
Correct. You can no longer equip a Dragon bayonet. It was a very rare drop and couldn't be learned.
---
Try to set fDefault1stPersonFOV in custom ini to something like 100.
---
If you dont have one, then create Fallout76Custom.ini in documents/my games/fallout76 and fill it with:
---
\[Display\]
---
fDefault1stPersonFOV=100.0000
---
as long as they don't take that as an invitation
---
I’ve seen him yesterday. Made me chuckle.
---
I don’t think it actually “scraps” all of the walls or floors.
---
One wasteland is going to make uranium fever viable for legendaries if the mole mine scale. Cant wait to find out. Any one on pc know if they do?
---
Dont worry my camp is instrument free.
---
And what of players that die to one of this events infinite glitches
---
Its not only energy weapons,melee takes a huge nerf too,it doesnt even matter if you use a legengary or a normal weapon, on pts they all feel the same,as for energy weapons everything needs a buff including durability,i have laser rifles that break 2-3 times in a boss fight.
---
Holy run on sentence batman.
---
The point being, if players can be super mutants, there’s be far more “friendly” super mutants than there should be.
---
Thank you for elevating the classic bag-o-shite to an art
---
Did you find the room at the asylum with the skeleton who has a pillow on his face and a  cuckoo clock on the floor?
---
Oh so you want to solo Earle while everyone else is busy looting since there's no time at the end? Got it. You take care of that, I'll get my screws and ammo, then we can all run out together. Holding hands, of course.
---
Thats the reason i don't do this event anymore. Im over level 300, i just grab some low level weapon and tag. But for some people is this to much work i guess.
---
For me personally I don’t like junkies or bloodied builds. I don’t like the idea that could get one-shotted by enemies. 
---
I’m just a sneak rifle build with full health.
---
And I have no problem with damage. That’s all I’m saying really. 
---
So the best effect for me would definitely be vanguards. 
---
I run with almost 500 DR and ER. Not bad imo. 
---
Again. It really depends on how OP likes to play his game
---
No, I get a lot of fixers plan with my account mule, dont are necesary, only for craft the key
---
This happened to me lol. I grinded Encryptid and never got the plan, I then caved and bought it for 10K and the very next time it dropped.
---
Lol let people play the way they want mate
---
Depends if you name your character "Adolf Hitler 1488" then yeah probably.  If you name them "John Doe" probably not.
---
I had a bug where all my ammo was inside my lever action rifle. But when I started the game the next day it was gone.
---
Yeah I have gone in to help clear before but never stolen the other players shit. Usually give them stuff. 
---
Those people were def asshats.
---
2h melee still oneshoting most mobs with 1k+ per hit, but 1h seems broken, damage lower like 80% compared to live
---
I have the astronaut at my camp, and she must not like my location, since my actual camp is on the very edge of the boundary, so she's constantly running from her console, then back to the center of the boundary circle. Back and forth, back and forth all day. Only time I hear her speak is when she notices a scorched on her travels.
---
I want the hair styles fallout 4 mods add, when modding comes to 76 I'm downloading the first hair style mod that comes up and add more styles.
---
Maybe when mods become a thing Bethesda will have to watch for cheat mods obviously but when doing so they will see the mods that have the most downloads and maybe that will show them what the community wants.
---
I didn't! I haven't spent a lot of time there, but I'll be on the lookout now that you mentioned it.
---
 Ok...I agree so far with the two comments made. For sure we receive a lots of free items on the legendary run. This is true and SEASONS are an asset and a motivation for the game. 
---
On other hand those who finish SEASONS ahead of time dont have any motivation to log in daily. I think BETHESDA could include extra XP or more ATOMS in the daily and weekly challenges for those who finish SEASONS ahead of time. It's just an opinion / idea.
---
Yeah no hate speech or anything like that. Obviously don't harass people sexually or any other way. But as far as cursing that is a little ridiculous. This is not a kids game.
---
These posts are invalid unless you begin by saying you've played since BETA.
---
Looks like it was redacted . . . for breaking the Code of Conduct, eh?
---
tape lol
---
it's about as good as a vhs edit, so I guess thats kinda accurate
---
😂 I’ll just try not to piss anyone off and that should cover my bases, right?
---
NO DO NOT FUCK BETHESDA
---
“I don’t think the heavy stuffs gonna come down for quite some time. I’d play through.”
---
Apparently that’s the consensus. 😂 This is my first FO, and I’m super new so I thought I had scored. Oh well. Lol
---
I got wanted when I was exploring a maze camp and picked a lock to see what was behind the door marked with Free Stuff. I knew it was a trap but I wanted to see how they set it up. I took off all my clothes and armor and went to find the nearest player. He gracefully put me out of my misery.
---
I can respect that. It was pure curiosity that prompted me to ask this here.
---
My friends and I had our first silo run stolen like this. We didn't die but we were all new and didn't really know what we were doing and some guy snuck in behind us and right as we finished the launch prep he swiped his keycard and took the launch. This was way back in the early days at game launch. Unfortunately these assholes have always been in the game.
---
I hope so. It makes sense!
---
On consoles it's the same button as vats, and for me (a vats commando build) I tend to spam vats, and general combat controls are also the same as pip boy buttons
---
And if it's another players tent?
---
Well I'm sure the game is a rigged bugfest as before, not my fault if I couldn't even kill Evan, what you want me to do? Also, the game let you do that, I didn't hack or anything because it just works. I don't see any wrong in making out my own fun a in broken game. Not like you can grief much, player loot is usually bad and they can always swap server. Moreover, I was helpful for everybody, noobs and not, when asked.. W/e, there aren't many chances but if you see me in game as a big muppet with claws ya know the deal
---
Armor is always worth the 3*, but for weapons, a 3rd star is less more important (90% reduced weight is nice tho). Only first 2 stars on ranged affecting your damage, like bloodied+explosive, or junkies+fire rate, or instigating+10% aim dmg for example. Basically im being a cheap ass 😹, 50 scrip vs 100 scrip for the same perfomance. 2star fixer gonna work the same as 3star you know
---
I was just about to link a small essay posted but someone showing the maths to prove your point. 
---
Then I noticed It was you who posted it.....
---
Omg
---
I guess all the downvotes come from those who think this post isn't a positive thought on the game. Actually this is my suggestion to improve it. I've seen so many people jumping off the game. But I'm still here. And now I see things like this, which isn't making people busier with the game.
---
Keep up the challenges, don't let there be this much gaps like now. Thats my message.
---
Honestly that's a good question I'm going to set up a pole to get the traps removed as it can't kill a mole rat but can kill us quickly. Thanks for the idea.

What is this?  A post-apocalyptic wasteland or Pottery Barn????

If I get a wanted level hanging out by train stations is a good way to lose them. They’re easy to fast travel to and people can store their junk before and after they kill you (if you don’t store it yourself first) hanging out naked at a train station let’s people know you’re not looking to fight them back so they can clear your bounty for you. 
---
You can always ask people to kill you but too many people know griefers use this trick so it doesn’t always work.
---
Should have looked on reddit first. Just wasted 3 keycards on Bravo. Disappointing
---
I thought there is a build limit?
---
You : 🤡
---
Btw you can't get banned for having duped or hacked items because not all ppl know some things are hacked or duped. Bethesda's own words
---
Bloodied is getting the biggest nerf but it’ll still be the best
---
I know what you mean. Hopefully they connect the dots and throw in something else(unless that was the plan all along).
---
Let us play our own notes or even record some for a contest every couple months. Crowdsource it, I don't care. Give me more than one loop.
---
okay, he is a better idea then:
---
Stop Wendigo adds from spawning after Earle is dead.  
---
Or Heck, why not spawn them at the exit (I really want 25 wendigo adds blocking the exit now)
---
We would just see an infinite amount of posts from people crying about losing their junk. Similar to 'Lode Baring' last year.
---
I'd love fishing and fish traps that I could place for some food supplys  near rivers and maybe a fish farm for on land
---
could you post the old code here or post the link? :)
---
Was doing this other day and a low level kept trying to block me and was putting ??? Emote.  Lol.
---
I had fun watching Grahm destroy my camp yesterday. He and his cow came walking in and the turrets lit him up. Then he went nuts slamming everything he could hit trying to get to the turrets. He destroyed walls, generators, resource collectors and even a set of stairs. NICE.
---
* Wait for other players to join events. Many events, especially the difficult ones, have a startup timer. Only do the action to really start the event if the startup timer is almost gone. Important examples are radiation rumble (wait to talk to the woman), encryptid (wait to actually start in the computer) and project paradise (wait to actually start in the computer). These difficult events in particular are close to impossible to complete by yourself, especially if you want max rewards.
---
* Don't start encryptid if you didn't put in the assaultron recall card. It costs 2000 caps and flux to make it. So if the person that put in the card wants to wait for their friends to join, let them.
---
* Don't ask for fish but ask to learn how to fish. ("how can I keep up with my ammo expenditure" instead of "give me some ammo please")
---
* Don't one-shot legendaries.
---
* Don't PvP with players under level 50. That is a dick move.
---
* Don't share rad removing perk cards, bloodied characters don't like that.
---
* in general: mic etiquette
---
* Don't melt Earl or the queen with magic weapons if you didn't launch the nuke yourself.
---
* Don't kill pets or brahmin owned by players
---
* If players don't want to trade, there is no point in trying over and over again.
---
Covers ammo consumption on a 5mm Gatling Gun too One of the most efficient guns in game. Seems like it creates more 5mm than other types.
---
Nice day for fishing, ain't it? Hu ha
---
Makes sense... I haven’t delved deep enough into it to even begin to think about traps. I just like my cute house. 😄 In my mind, when I saw traps were craftable, I figured it was for the PVE enemies. I should feel dumb, but I really don’t. Not since I’m so new to the game and haven’t played too many Xbox games at all. It was actually an interesting, kinda funny moment for me. I like to know what makes people do the things they do, and wanted others’ perspectives on it. I’ve certainly gotten that! Hahaha!
---
The problem, at least for me as a day one player that’s usually one of the highest level guys on the map, is that griefing/PvP tricks have made me highly suspicious of wanted players and PvP in general.  
---
I can’t be sure I’m up to date on the latest, cutting edge methods to destroy my house, steal my weapons, crash the server, bushwhack me or some other newly discovered trick designed to ruin my evening.  I’ll never underestimate griefers.
---
It’s safer to just steer clear of wanted players and PvP in general.  If someone is swinging at me and throwing out emotes and/or gang gestures, I won’t take the bait.
---
The amount of times I've had someone try to buy my fancy pump action from me is insane. Like you can see I have it equipped, why on earth would I trade it if I'm using it as one of my main guns?
---
Yeah. This was out in the open right by White Spring Station.
---
It kind sounds like doom music beat boxed lol
---
You can’t be sure that a raider discord group didn’t find a new way around PvP rules, either.
---
Some of us can't fit it in our stash so we carry it till we find someone that wants it or till we get sick of carrying it and scrip it
---
Yeah, not really, the pink one does spawn rather regularly. But from my personal experience, the yellow one comes up way less often than the forest one (it's just not as popular, hence it goes for less caps normally).
---
I'm level 119. Your not alone
---
Same, got one the very next time after buying. I suspect when they made fixer plans required to get legendary fixers, they also accidentally made knowing the fixer plan a requirement to get the fixer plan to drop. Lol.
---
It's right between the factory and The Sacrament at the highest point of the mountain. Straight to west from the factory!
---
This guy used to go by the name of AlexSloan. And he's been griefing since the very beginning. I have some primo video of him trolling me and my buddy if you want to see it
---
I use shotgun and 5mm when I’m not running my unarmed bloodied build. And it’s nice having free ammo waiting for me back at my camp. Considering it only takes me 1-2 bullets to kill something, it’s nice coming back once in a while to check my camp. To see 50-60 rounds waiting for me.
---
Well that’s a terrible oversight.  You kinda have to go out of your way to move your camp on PC.
---
That sounds like something a 14yr old hacker would say after filling their schools website with pornos. Except these guys got no talent and can only wreck things in a video game.
---
They were there, must have been removed.
---
Of course the nuke codes break the exact same day I finally get my B2525 Handmade and want to test it out solo on Earl... This is exactly my luck.
---
Besides the one I learned, I’ve gotten about 7 plans for the fixer.  I didn’t know they were in demand so I would just sell them for 100 caps each. They always went quick.
---
I never have really given a shit about seasons. Sure it's cool to get the stuff but if I don't it's not the end of the world. Im Still learning the ins and outs of this game. Hell, I'm still reeling over the fact that I'm playing fallout online. Just enjoy the game like you want. Besides I really think seasons were just a bow on top of all the bugs they fix (and don't fix).
---
To me, the shitty thing is how anonymously and cowardly these attacks are. Use exploits to farm probably, fast travel in, attack an unarmed and I'm suspecting camp, fast travel out. It's like crushing bugs, not impressive, kinda worrying. Still, greifing is classic fallout behavior,  but we should have a designated game mode for it. Omg I'd love a game mode based on camp v. camp warfare. Or they need to bring back the survival server.
---
Couple spots u can go.

West tek
---

The Bog region. ( I sometimes start at watoga and just work my way north.  Run into a couple of legendaries.  
---

---
i thought it was because i'm so close to a common nuke spot.
---
Only thing that bugs me is having to fix the radiation ring.
---
ah damn just as I wanted to see if they can replace my turret platforms
---
LOL!   I wish.
---
30 caps for a jetpack mod is a great deal if you havent unlocked it.  Not everyone experienced xmas over and over and over...
---
When I first load in, Class Freak is not working. I have to disable and reenable. It might be a visual glitch in the stats, but I have noticed a difference until I disable/reenable.
---
I used last week’s code and they worked, here’s where I found them

---
Intelligence determines the amount of xp you get, so might as well spend those intelligence points.
---
Heavy weapons and melee work well together, but melee in this game is all about strength, and does not work well with out min maxing, and you wanted to avoid that.
---
I run heavys, and stealth rifles.  An instigating lever action from stealth can 1 hit everything but bosses, with very little card manipulation. Once spotted, switch to heavy.
---
Legendaries apply per weapon. One hit guns do well with AA or instigating, and +10 damage, dps guns are better with executioners or furious, and explosive. 
---
Unyielding is stat, bolstering is resistance, Vanguard is full health resistance bonus. Resistance does not scale well, and is a waste after a point.  That may change.
---
Right now DPS is the way to go. That means heavys and automatics with faster fire rate.
---
Jetpacks really are. They stripped power armor of one of the few useful things it had left.
---
I tried last weeks codes last night and none worked. I have since deleted them because they served no purpose to me unfortunately.. but if I'm not mistaken this workaround only works if you have a server still open from before the code swap and if its a brand new server this cannot work
---
That makes no sense to blame the game and not the players doing this. It’s not like it’s happening in every server to everyone’s CAMP on every platform.
---
I've never successfully escaped the mine, so your idea would mean I'd never get any rewards.
---
Stealth suit?   If U don’t have it that would be good.  Just use it till it breaks and don’t take it off.
---
There's no way you threw it in. I'm sure you meant to, but I don't believe you we're able to.
---
What have you got in your pocket?
---
9. There will likely be NW challenges again, if you don't like it don't do them that's all there is to it, just don't come here complaining about them every day.  Some of us actually like them.

We are not currently on speaking terms. 😤😤 I will try talking to her tomorrow but *only* if she can show me she's changed.
---
you can loot during the fight. This last week we regularly 2 man the event, loot during it and escape. Do you not want at least the semblance of challenge in the game, accompanied by a sense of achievement when you've completed something?
---
Lol no you can't...
---
She left him .... for pubg maybe
---
Well, if I die, I die. It’s just a game, and the best thing about it is that as long as you’re smart and stash the scraps, you don’t lose much at all. I’d be so pissed if I lost my gear.
---
This happened to me about a year ago. Ran a silo solo, got to the part where you put your card in and couldn't. Someone else was there , invisible. They launched, and not only did they launch but they launched at my camp lol. Lesson learned
---
Go full health heavy gunner build. You can easily switch to meele and shotgun cards under strength. Dont invest more than 5 points in Inteligence as you can easliy boost INT with food.
---
"Ever get a melody stuck in your head?"

I’ve reported every single one of these camps/players. I was very happy to see the new agreement. Felt like Beth was actually listening for once. I love this game and see fallout community as one big family. It hurts me to stumble across a camp that has swastakas or the n-word every where. Trap camps suck but the racist ones make my blood boil.
---
Regardless of whose tent it is the OP knows full fucking well they are exploiting a glitch. It's extremely hypocritical to then complain about the state of things when doing so.
---
Huh. Guess I confused my numbers.
---
Artificial scarcity. They think this motivates everyone else to buy shit while its available.
---
Change the stock to a rifle one and slap some gunslinger and rifleman perks and you've got yourself a decent weapon right there.
---
Too lazy to catch small animals to kill.
---
That sells for 24 caps, and from what I’ve heard, you can’t display it.
---
does canned coffee work with it? I can imagine flying to the moon if it did.
---
Yes you can. In the 3 minutes you spend standing their like a lemon I could farm 3 times as much xp just wandering around, not even trying.
---
Yes! I love Fallout, but this is my first Online only RPG, so I expected to run into griefers and n00b chasers. On the contrary, everyone I’ve encountered has been awesome, giving my poor little Lvl 18 character plans, recipes, stump acts and even a power armor chassis.  I absolutely love this community, and I’m even going to invest in a mic so I can thank everyone with my actual voice instead of my ❤️ Emote
---
how come? Killed by spawns after Earle's dead, didn't find the exit, or did nobody do the 'come here' emote at exit entrance like any in our squad does when there 1st?
---
I suppose. As a big guns build I'm not gonna re-do everything haha
---
Aren't single shot rifles pretty underwhelming anyways?
---
The whole death thing in FO76 is a joke anyway. I love the game and I enjoy playing it even the way it is.. The problem is there is no real negative with death. See a huge boss run in swinging with bare fist because why not. I would love to see something like you drop backpack items but nothing in favorites. If that is to harsh then maybe a instanced get your stash back game. Loads of mobs with one boss holding your items. I know i am probably by myself here but I like the Adrenalin rush.
---
You have to keep an eye on fall damage. Perks help, slowing the fall helps (if done properly), and sometimes you die anyways. Best case is 2 peices with 50% fall damage reduction to negate fall damage 100%
---
People like you make me laugh.
---
I don’t believe in gameplay altering mechanics under a subscription. I also don’t like the idea of a subscription personally so I’m the wrong person to ask about if their is value. I know a lot of people wanted private worlds.
---
It must not safe be for work for some reason???
---
Just do ACP and be on windigo duty, they drop screws and their teeth which have acid in them. It’s amazing.
---
No... You can't... All things being equal (buffs/weapons) me tagging dozens of scorched every 20 seconds or so will gain me more XP than you running WS and WestTek.
---
I support this if they all come with a ball gag.
---
Very well could be buggy because after reading this i realized mine is stuck with the default mode when you place him down lol
---
Can't have shit in Virginia
---
This kinda made me giggle at the mental image.
---
I will drop everything I'm doing and fast travel to the other side of the map for a 5c bounty.
---
The real challenge is if I can get close enough to them that I have a chance to eat them before they can die.
---
Exactly! Took a small vacation during labor day, come back online, and poof! gone before I even saw it.
---
Meanwhile at the league of evil secret lair
---
They should atleast have an overflow for times like this, if a vendor purchase puts you over 30k then it has X amount of time it can go over the 30 before it disappears
---
Very true, certainly economies of scale there! 
---
 As a rifle build though... That 90% reduced weight is definitely appreciated and the reason why I carry an instigating black powder rifle as a 4th choice weapon (lever, smg, lasgun) though those 50 cal. balls weigh a ton
---
I have never really understood this complaint. If you don't want to go over the caps threshold, don't sell stuff.
---
And harpers ferry don't forget, I've seen the numbers ppl get from line in the sand being glitched. They're rookie numbers even with buffs lol. Silly boy.
---
Ok. Be honest. Of all the time you’ve played. How many weapons or armour have u traded in a random trade invite situation.
---
I know the legendary slots are account-wide (unlocked starting at level 50) but I can't find where it says if the coins themselves are locked to the character. I think they are...want to see what others say though.
---
oh yeah, the first image for example, is 3.1 MB as a png, and only 536 KB as a jpg image. takes a while to load if you are at a shitty connection like some unfortunate souls.
---
This happens every "down time." There is nothing going on, so players grief. Happens at the end of every special event.  Like fashnaught, once they had the masks, they turn to griefing. Bethesda has always been pretty quick to pick up on griefing techniques and has squashed most of them, but they did not get the memo on the explosive bait.
---
Like you said, its time to lay low.  Vending is not as profitable right now anyways.
---
Thank you for the extra info! It's hard to tell sometimes with this game.
---
Just, why?
---
Thank you!
---
And now I know what do do when I see people with some of the most common plans at base price. Nothing drives me more crazy then seeing a tinkers work bench plan or chemistry bench plan in a camp set at base price. I'm like 99% everyone has one or gets one of these at some point.
---
It's always worth it even if you just sell the ammo.
---
Seriously, man, blueprints are useless. I moved my camp from the river near the Wayward over to the Mire so I could glom onto a junk extractor, and literally none of the blueprints could be placed.
---
I know the Mire is notoriously bad for building, but the same thing happened the two previous times I'd moved my camp as well.

It was one letter you angry, pathetic little louse. If that's the *only* leg you have to stand on, then I've already won, and your pathetic desire to feel justified in your entitlement is horribly flawed.
---
You weren't arguing balance, or the merits of Fallout 76 being online, and neither was I. You were whining and moaning about how unfair it is that you get killed when you take over a workshop, even though you *know* they're the ONE dedicated PvP zone in the game. You're just trash that wants to feel like your build means something. It doesn't. 
---
The *best* part? I'm barely mediocre at PvP, I just understand game mechanics enough to give myself an advantage. More than you'll ever accomplish with the attitude you have, I guarantee you that. Instead of taking your losses as an opportunity for growth, you decided to dig in your heels and bury your head up your ass. How pathetic.
---
Well, if you are on PC I will buy that from you with a healthy amount of caps. My entire build is around pipe revolvers :'D
---
I am so jealous you don’t have to listen to her.
---
step trigger under the ride with a delayed rad emitter setup in the foundation. It is hard and time consuming but yeah it is fun. The hardest part is setting the trap plate just right to be invisible.
---
Minigun, because it goes brrrrrrt. But seriously I would go with the one that spins up the fastest.
---
I just don’t do this event anymore. Bloodied heavy but even with a normal weapon I’ll do way more damage than is my fair share. For me to not be a nuisance here, I’d have to use 4-5 RadAway and a normal weapon. Then when the events over I’d have to radiate myself back to 20%.  That means taking 3 minutes to drink dirty water or using the 10 or so toxic goo from west tek, so now I have to go farm some more goo. This is a lot just to do less damage so others get a shot at a foreman. I avoid it now.
---
I just wish the boundary wasn't a freaking circle. I mean, I understand why from a lore perspective (it radiates out from the C.A.M.P.), but it's unnecessarily limiting and makes building more frustrating than it should be.
---
Well god damn, I didnt know fo76 had such benevolent creatures!
---
Cringe
---
Ya'll are actually a bunch of babies. Nobody ever said the BoS Collectron would be available for free in store for a whole week. You just assumed that, and that's what you deserve.
---
I got rid of her in 2 hours.. holy shit is she annoying.
---
I still have 30 from the run. I pop one at Earle and usually others will as well.
---
I have 20 left from the last season, they take up weight 0.1 each and have no benefit. I have 120 weight left to use so I keep them, if weight ever gets tight they’ll be the first to go. 
---
If people were going to risk a ban for dupping I doubt they’d risk it for lunchboxes, but what do I know??
---
What the *Hell* are you wearing?? I’ve never seen that outfit before... Does PC have mod support now or something?
---
Shut up, Todd Howard.
---
I carry throwing knives for that exact reason. Get a little hit in and then back up, cuz I don't wanna accidentally kill it with my claw.
---
But it IS happening. And I can blame the game since player interaction is a big part of the game. Fallout could easily make CAMPs invulnerable.
---
If I kill you, at least have the dignity to let me eat you before you respawn.  I earned that meal.
---
Truth
---
That is weird
---
SHHHHHHHHH!
---
they will try to fix it
---
Dude I haven't gotten a good roll in 50 levels hahaha
---
Never bother with them. No interest in PvP and most, like yourself want to get killed.
---
They should have more health too I hope.
---
Hell yea! I remember many years ago, my siblings and I taught him how to play the OG Halo, and then he delved into Elderscrolls Morrowind. I knew I truly succeeded when he came by the Gamestop I worked at to get a new game, picked up Fallout 3, and Said "Hey, this is made by Bethesda, which means it'll be awesome but full of bugs, right?"
---
I shed a tear in happiness lol
---
These guys are not next level villains but pre level villains if you will.
---
It reminds me of some shit Skeletor would have done from the early 2000s he man show
---
Really? I don’t know how I missed that. I missed a few weeks and didn’t think I had a real chance to finish until this last week. Lol This has been a tough week for me, I’m lvl 148 and just found out about the duder selling gold at the wayward. I’m afraid I’ve been wandering the wasteland fat, drunk and stupid
---
You're right, for the most part, but I have on occasion traded somebody some serums I had on me.
---
Word is, there is also a legendary squirrel. The only strange legendary enemy I've come across has been a 2 star liberator. That tiny thing was surprisingly violent.
---
Weird reply to my hint that i will slaughter villagers because of my raider-ish habbits, but ok.
---
Supply requisition?? I get like 211 and the game won’t let me pick up anymore so I drop hundreds of them on the ground from time to time.
---
A level 58 broke into an area of my camp 2 days ago. He garnered a Wanted level, he was confused why I wouldn’t kill him (or he was confused why I locked an area of my camp), either way glad it annoyed him.
---
Easy rule: I see legendary, i wave players over, i bash it and am on my way again.
---
You wish!
---
If you put your card in a silo or at the terminal in Encryptid, it should all be you at that point. It's a shitty game mechanic that it's not.
---
Does it drop ultracite ammo?
---
I tried my best to get raiders hostile to my BoS character. I even took a fresh out of the vault character to crater to test, they weren't hostile and I couldn't hurt them.
---
Well I’ve been looking for a JFFR lmg and .50 cal lately, got the .50 cal around 2 weeks ago by trading for it. A few days ago I decided to turn in some scrip and buy some 2* weapons since my stash was getting full, and I got ... a jffr .50 cal.

Good to know thank 👍

Np xD

I usually get Assassin Baseball Bats. I've gotten like 6 in the past month or two. The JE Fixer was very surprising.
---
Can't shake these nightmares...floating in space forever.
---
Is it? It’s in the typically expiring shop stuff so the optics do not suggest that.  
---
Willing to be wrong if it means it doesn’t disappear of course
---
Cool dude 👍 I’m all about enjoying the game your way so I’m glad to hear it, I’m not very bloodthirsty either so I’ll just stick with punji boards and scarecrows to keep the mole rats out.
---
nope, cause next we'd have to do fishing challenges...no thanks \*gets WoW flasbacks\*
---
This, I almost leave the event every time someone repairs it because it’s so annoying. Only thing it does is be loud, cause screen shake, and steal XP from you, especially if you use the tent trick and all the scorched spawn in the center.
---
Exactly. I have one whole vending machine dedicated solely to pipe rev / bolt action that have been specced to use both pistol and rifle perks. A big sign on it that says “Pipe is Life”.
---
Very good roll
---
No clue. All I know is that every now and then my raiders get pissed off and try to kill my customers.
---
Omg, the repetition is maddening. I muteD my tv every time I was forced to play for daily challenges.
---
Omg, the repetition is maddening. I muted my tv every time I was forced to play for daily challenges.
---
Its kinda crappy. Mine just collects scrap. I gave up and got the raider one.
---
It's Teslas that are the issue regarding FPS, not glitching the event. You're jumping the gun stating OP is causing it by exploiting.
---
It should end the game since you are buried under a mountain :P
---
I can only imagine how empty your life is friend
---
You do not get to high levels by killing the bosses quickly, the mob spawns are full of XP.  The group I play with levels 400 to 800 will draw out queens and ACP for quite a while to farm the spawns.
---
Samir says ["Hello"](https://youtu.be/SrxEBBwG158)
---
I'm mad I listened to everyone on here and claimed the scrip I was saving for the sale. ☹️ I shoulda just risked it. Happy for you though, glad you didn't miss out on the rewards you earned.
---
yes, I think I saw something where a Bethesda spokeperson said The Fixer is just a skin for the combat rifle, thats why the combat rifle skins dont work, but apparently they will be making some changes to that in future update
---
Uranium Fever gives you three. Horde events usually give you 1, but sometimes I've seen horde events that don't have a legendary but instead have a crowned boss. Free Range gives you a legendary at the end. AWOL Armaments gives you at least one. Guided Meditation throws so many ghouls at you that often a bunch of them end up being legendary but I've also run that event and none of them were, but seeing at least a few is more common.
---
Hate speech doesnt exist .. its some bs term they made up..
---
Accumulating gold isn’t too bad, the reputation system is what really blows. Took me about a month to max it out with one faction.
---
I see this all different collectrons. Sometimes I’ll go adventuring for and hour or two and come back to camp to find a hoard of scrap. Sometimes only one to four items. Locks and whatnot all still in tact so I’m chalking it up to being random.
---
I would only ever go into a silo when someone is in it if they are on my public team and I see them struggle but other than that it’s a known unwritten rule that you don’t go into someone else’s silo run but sadly we got a lot of newbies that think they are vets.
---
When mine is on BoS mode it collects scrap at about the same rate as the "scrap" setting, plus I also get the occasional healing chem.
---
Nope, even without teslas the fps bombs with that exploit. Also, I didn't say yhe OP is causing it, I said they're well aware of it.
---
Doesn’t seem to work for me. I placed down the Santa one. Then the regular one in case I just needed to store and put them away to see if it would help. But doesn’t seem like it.
---
So posting a picture on reddit (sharing) of a funny bug you found could get you banned if they decide to do so? 
---
Not saying it will get you banned, for all those who read what they want and not what is written.
---
Legendary perks and daily ops are coming on the 15th.they have also introduced a new boss fight you can trigger with a nuke
---
Yeah the overseer isn't fooling anyone.  Spends all her time tinkering in the basement...
---
The "don't use atoms to rank up" should more be "It's fine to use atoms to rank up if you're gonna run out of time to finish the board before the season ends". Everyone is free to spend their atom points as they want but buying ranks for the first half of the board is kinda a waste in my opinion.
---
I think I’m over level 60 and still have no idea how nukes work or what they are for or how you get them.
---
Sorry about those jerks though.
---
Or even better allow us actually play or compose music just saying...
---
I can answer the second question. Gold is slow
---
 200 gold per day for 20 treasury notes. You get like 2 treasury notes per event, 3 for the foundation daily, and 8 for the new ACP event. You can also buy 300 gold a week from Smiley at the Wayward for 6k caps. And you need a whole lot of gold for the whole service set plus mods. 5900 gold not including mods, 2000 for the jetpack torso mod as well if you wanted that.
---
Yep me too. Player's responsibility to manage their caps/vending machines
---
Hate speech as in being a bigot pice of crap. I have seen it for myself in game. It is a thing. Being racist, sexist or homophobic. All that is in the vein of hate speech.
---
Me and 2 friends got him down to low health, looted, then finished him off and hauled ass but that was easy since it was just us 3.
---
I use mine for 5.56.
---
I don't actually use 5.56 as I'm a heavy gunner but the ammo machine generates 5.56 faster than any other ammo type, 5.56 sells pretty easily for 1 cap/ea in my vendor, and if no one buys in a while I'll convert a few thousand into ammo I actually use with the ammo converter.
---
It’s in every platform
---
There's also a dude with a demo plunger on top of the big wall
---
Yea thats called being a duchebag.. not hate speech
---
lol i used this setup for a shot as well. But it was more for satirical reasons, not cause i wanted to portray suicide. http://imgur.com/a/yhN5Jgu
---
That’s a bummer
---
Do you think you will make a video on this one Marta?
---
*They're basically complaining that the fps gets borked but it's them causing it.*
---
-
---
Hmm.
---
Why are you here just to complain
---
This is the way i understood it as well. Slots are account, coins character.
---
Modders support it, yes.  [https://www.nexusmods.com/](https://www.nexusmods.com/)
---
:) that's a bit too much. BUT what could work is a 5 minute minigame where you have to use that cursed pick axe /shovel game has been showering us with. LOL
---
Oooo...gotta try this. Thanks for the tip
---
Does putting a power switch on a vending machine not work anymore?
---
Shout this from the rooftops amigo!!!!
---
Hat speech
---
     
---
abusive or threatening speech or writing that expresses prejudice against a particular group, especially on the basis of race, religion, or sexual orientation.
---
"we don't tolerate any form of hate speech"
---
There is the definition from the dictionary.
---
While I agree with many of the other comments saying that people are probably aware that it's done for the money at the cost of player satisfaction, I always applaud anyone who is in favour of promoting education and understanding the facts and situation. So thank you for this.
---
To give my own opinion, I've played a number of games that use questionably ethical tactics to try and make money and keep people playing, and while I'm sure that most of them are effective, I also question whether the companies fully understand the longer term cost of it. Sure, the rewards systems etc. might keep people coming back and spending money for a while (demonstrable with studies), it's harder to know the longer term impact of those people who end up having a more negative view of the company/game because of it. It's much harder to see what the effect of this is, because it's harder to study, and the companies can't see what the effect would have been if their approach had been different. This includes spending habits (whether they continue to spend), duration of play (at what point they've had enough and get rid of the game), and word of mouth advertising (whether they talk it up to friends/family/random people on the internet).
---
One game I tend to play (not Fallout) has given me an impression for a long time that the company that make it are greedy, and their tactics are very underhanded. I used to occasional buy in game items - as much to support the game as anything else, but since realising this I refuse to spend anything. A number of my in game team mates (the main reason I continue playing) have independently said the same thing, although I realise that it's quite possibly the minority of the players that take this approach.
---
Bruh tbh thought I left the sub
---
That's the way the story should be
---
Doesn't make much sense when a thing called freedom of speech has existed since before most of us were even thought of.. stop being so sensitive.
---
Bro I’m just roleplaying as a raider this is what bethesda wants bro
---
Because it was only intended to be available for people actually participating in the event. 
---
Most people who were able to claim it even did so without donation. 
---
Why would you have timed event rewards be permanently available when they never have been for any event prior? That's the whole point of time exclusive.
---
"Hee hee yeesss, script machine go cling cling boom"
---
Yep, though I didn't find that one myself, I did see a post that showed a screenshot of it when I was searching the forum to make sure no one had already posted this one.
---
Now, if they really want to impress people, they'll put in some Caddyshack II references. :D
---
Homonyms. Ok can someone explain for my dumb butt
---
Nah man, it's cool! They are just "rOlEpLaYiNg aS rAiDeRs"! 
---
/s
---
Arguing petty semantics because my point is correct.
---
i can't do this cuz i have all 4 of my vendors full and meticulously set to certain cap prices. it's not that i sell too high its that i have over 400 plans and a few legendary weapons and armors i try to get rid of as well. I put all my vendors in the rocket garage so i can solve the max cap problem and just cut the power and lock up both garage door and regular door lol.
---
I never would have guessed this sub had a "retired suggestions" feature, based on the number of mind numbing repetitive posts about auto-complete, ounce of prevention bug, etc etc. If anything, an item for item trading system needs more traction so we might actually get through to Beth one day. Damn.
---
This is exactly how my first silo run went. I completely get that feel. I don’t tend to get too mad either but I did walk away for a few days. This was way before wastelanders tho.
---
This weeks really bad for endgamers...
---
No daily or weekly challenges with atoms and no nukes.. Bethesda and zenimax really love their player base
---
plus I'm pretty sure we won't even get a compensation...
---
Team Instances*
---
Freedom of speech does cover that your right. But Zenimax owns the game you are in. If they don't tolerate it then you can't do it or get banned.  Like if you were screaming obscenities in a store they owner has the right to have you removed. Not sensitive im stating facts.
---
PS4 needs text chat
---
It's not a nerf, nerfs are targeted. This is a rebalance and things needed to be rebalanced as a whole to get a max and low threshold for damage.
---
They couldn't accurately track how effective certain perks or weapons or effects were to adjust while things were still essentially multiplicative and creating abstract results that were hard to reproduce. 
---
Some people who only want to one shot everything in the game will be annoyed but it's absolutely a necessary process moving forward and I'd expect a second adjustment balance down the road once numbers come back tracked.
---
Jokes on you. It's your CAMP.
---
What i dislike the most about the nerf is not the actual damage. Its that buffs will be barely noticable. If you completely spec into a specific weapon i want The damage number to reflect that. Half the game for me nowadays is To see how high i can get The numbers. With The additive system it will barely make dent to put 9 perk points into a specific weapon.
---
This is my logic exactly though, it has to be the number one most requested feature in this entire game but yet we're not allowed to talk about it anymore on the subreddit?
---
To combat this issue I just lower my prices. If I’m at 30k or close to it I obviously don’t need to sell something for several thousand caps. Seriously. Some of y’all price stuff like it’s pure gold.
---
Some of have known since the beginning. It's not that big of a deal for everyday mobs.
---
well people are sensitive so im stating facts.
---
Chad farmer based
---
Put a Fasnacht mask and clown outfit on him. That was my solution.
---
It's not semantics. You literally stated it.
---
Same here but people are assholes
---
Also look for AWOL armorments
---
I drop them on white-springs often, Usually on a private. Just to resource farm.....
---
They don't always have to be on the SBQ fissure or earl.
---
More petty semantics.
---
And then I you want to play PvE just turn on Pacifist, right?
---
That is ridiculous. Maybe you could post to the official forum? I don't personally go there so idk if they moderate the same as here or not but it is definitely a conversation that needs to continue.
---
Tbf, I have my collectron (since anybody can get one afaik) and large purifiers locked because stimpacks are how I clear vendor caps. I go through hundreds of water. People are more than fine with 2 smalls since that's a complete bar if 0% water.
---
My prices on things are dummy cheap too.
---
I only do that event for the xp for all the killing lol. I usually ignore the legendary miner cuz I know I’ll either accidentally kill it or it’s dead by the time I figure out where it is.
---
To me, those goofy sound effects and over the top silliness are hallmarks of the fallout franchise.
---
I’ve jumped in silos lots of times just to help out. I guess I just don’t understand the desire to be that rude.
---
So regardless of which collectron is placed, the only thing that determines what it collects is the settings. 
---
I've never seen the BoS mode collect ammo, so maybe your gf was set to communist ammo and guns. BoS mode only collects the same scrap items they requested to be donated.
---
I also always recommend that people store and replace the collectron in between changing modes because I've seen it get glitched before not collecting until relogging.
---
The thing is people are probably going to act like I'm just some crazy dick head who cares about a video game too much, but like if this feature has been requested so many times and we're being ignored is that not something that the community should know about?
---
It won’t sustain any boss farming for sure but definitely helps. Ammo crafting is so tedious and painful.
---
Go big or go home. Leave a mini nuke and fertilizer with the notes.
---
Yes, it could. If they wanted to ban for that, that is. They probably wouldn't, but I can see them going after the person who spreads a really bad bug like a weapon dupe or some Score exploit.
---
I still have like 10-15 of them saved up from the legendary run so it's quite possible that someone who haven't used a single one of them would have a ton to open.
---
Yeah, right now the Perk Loadout mod is essential. the game should differentiate between combat and social perks.
---
That’s very true. The most exciting night I’ve had in a while was last night when someone launched a nuke then I launched one and then someone launched a third one. We killed the queen 3 times with in 30 minutes. Didn’t get great loot but the repair kits is where it’s at. Way better then going against bullet sponge earl. I’m excited for season 2 also, I usually get on do my daily scrip, maybe launch a nuke and do a quick run through normal areas. Then I’m usually burnt out by then. I can’t wait for more content
---
how is this a spoiler
---
I got a Junkie's faster fire rate fixer the other night.  That's probably the best thing she's dropped for me in a while.  I would say for every 10 weapons I get from her, 1 is something that I can sell in my vending machines.  The rest get scrapped back into scrip
---
Lol there should be an age limit on online games. You must be older than 12 to play
---
No worries they always bring stuff back, always. The limited time availability is just a marketing gimmick.
---
Can we bump this up to 35?
---
Once you have it, it's an infinite supply of extra ammo.  Unless you're a melee only character, it's worth more than it's weight in bullion.
---
Why? 30k is the cap, not 30k plus overflow. 
---
I'd you're close to max caps, flip off vendors. It's incredibly simple to do.
---
Datamind is in the description you have to put spoiler
---
Is that a new word you learnt today? Might want to check a dictionary.
---
Perfect! Something to watch tonight.
---
It should've been up for at least a week or two. A few days during a Holiday weekend is just plain stupid. With those behind this game though I'm not surprised. They mess up everything.
---
"The one ring to rule them all"
---
I think people who are on video game message boards care about the games just as much as you. Some more, some less, but we all have a common interest here. I also think a large majority of the community wants this feature and they have been asking for it longer than I have been around. It's not crazy and you are not alone. Keep fighting for what you want.
---
Yes. Just down the road from Camden Park.
---
*"..and complain to Bethesda about.."* \- This is a fanbased sub, if you want to directly contact bethesda do so in official forums.
---
*"has been blocked because apparently suggesting item for item trades is now considered a retired suggestion"* \- This has been done for a very good reason. If there was no rule againts this the whole sub would be filled only with complaints about the same issues. If you have a problem or a suggestion, again, contact bethesda in their official forum or make a ticket.
---
My precious.
---
And yet more pettiness.
---
You'll use that material up in no time on boss fights. But a machine that makes infinite ammo for free, even if it's not huge amounts?  That's invaluable.  I just clear the machine out before logging out for the night to be sure any time I'm playing next is making more ammo.
---
There are 2 ways to deal with those asshats, depending on how many others are at the event.
---
1. If they kill the 1st one quickly, then I kill the others before they get a hit
---
2. Open PIPboy, leave event, get in front of the offender, then kill them after they hit you, repeat this until event is done, it keeps them away from everyone else.
---
I’d love to have multiple allies. Having trouble deciding between Beckett in his Blood Eagles Jacket, Gramps in a Hunters Longcoat Black Cowboy Hat and Patrolman Sunglasses, or Raider Punk in a full Stalker Set.
---
That's because the mods don't really do anything in this forum unless you report it.
---
"Rule 10. No trading posts or retired suggestions."
---
You sure you didnt miss/forget the first half of the rule? 
---
That or I'm thinking the bot just accidently flagged your post as a trading post. It happens.
---
It’s been discussed to death, there is no other feedback that can be given that hasn’t already been given.
---
Open a ticket to complain, bitching here isn’t going to do anything.
---
the majority of the fan base want retired topics so we stop hearing about it
---
You didn't have a CAMP in fallout 4, you had a settlement. 
---
Many people already have a tamed creatures besides the ally, and they've talked about CAMP robots and official pets which I think is higher priority than stacking Allies.
---
I understand the initial motivation to build big, but once you start really decorating a smaller build it feels a lot more organic and real.
---
So far, I haven't seen a whole lot of actual "angst" from the folks on the PTS regarding the changes.
---
Personally, if you have a system where a single build is substantially better than everything else, you have to expect that changes will be made to rebalance things.
---
In this case, everyone is taking a hit, for the most part, but the builds are now closer to a baseline, so you have room to play with it &amp; see what works best. 
---
After a few weeks, people will settle back in &amp; you'll see a lot of this complaining go by the wayside.
---
I used last week’s code and it worked (Bravo and Charlie)
---
The whole ticket support is trash. 
---
Sent numerous tickets for bugs and glitches all
---
Answer automatically saying they will close my ticket in 24h if no reply , with no follow up and obviously none of these bugs have been addressed 1.5 years later. 
---
Gave up.
---
The only time I'll hop to a silo is if the people are on a public team, and I'll join then in it, I've got cards to spare, and I'm honestly content just watching the boom.
---
As a lot of others here have said, need a hand through the silo and I'm down to help, or if you and your dad want silo bouncers lol
---
&gt; homonyms
---
words that sounds the same but are written differently with different meanings.
---
Chinese being a tonal language has an abundance of these, for instance, 猩猩 and 星星 are both "xīngxing" yet mean "gorilla" and "star", respectively. 
---
As there are certain topics the Chinese government censors, Chinese netizens use homonyms to refer to these forbidden topics.
---
So, Bethesda banning the use of homonyms may be to allow them to enforce China's mandatory censorship, thus allowing the game to be available to Chinese audiences.
---
Yes!!!   This way I can fast travel to your camp and spend 15 minutes looking for your unmarked vendors, the whole time having to listen to two TWO sources of inane blabber and bad guitar riffs only to find out that your vendors are stocked with mounted head plans and turbo fert...
---
On XBox, last week's codes still work.
---
Launched three last night &amp; watched three more get launched this morning.
---
Especially with some of the extra damage from legendary perks if you have a good build it's still a good build. 
---
Unless you're a black powder rifle main, you'll probably be fine.
---
If you're on top of it with the stimpacks Vanguards is definitely the way to go, though it's up to you whether you want to go through the grind. 
---
I [crunched the numbers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z7IwVO6UEHs1RjT-QQFc5stAIrUtlHM36LRK8ZLWTPg/edit?usp=sharing) a while ago and, contrary to popular belief, there are no diminishing returns on armor rating, especially for high damage attacks. Fallout 76's damage reduction equation has diminishing returns when translating armor rating into damage reduction, but damage reduction itself has increasing returns on survivability, so it balances out and becomes pretty much linear.
---
Yeah that's usually how I make my 1400 a day
---
Even if you skipped nw you would have made it.
---
I like the golf cart jousting at Whitespring.
---
I solve this by as soon as I have over 20k i rush to The whitesprings bunker and buy serum recepie, and IF I own all of them i just transfer it to another character. Maybe you could lower your prices? Most stuff is not worth what People charge. Im not saying you are over pricing but it could be a selution
---
That's how it is working currently on PTS. Slots unlocked is account based, each individual character has their own earned coins though.
---
Oh yes I know. The smaller the building. The more you can decorate it, the more it feels lived in. 
---
At one point I had a farm camp. The Brahmin, the chickens, my pet radstag, the lone wanderer wearing her flannel shirt. It felt like a happy little farm up by flat woods. Until molerats spawned and killed my radstag.
---
Why not just rob their crops and water?  I do that even if I don't hate the person because I need caps.
---
That's a known error if you've got the armor equipped when you log in. Unequip and re-equip to show the jetpack.
---
72 hours during a holiday weekend
---
Tried 00000000 for science.  No dice as expected.
---
So I just started the game part way through the season and didn't realize until August what Legendary Run was.  While I have a soft spot for all the Hubris Comic stuff, but particularly Captain Cosmos.  I loved its CC content on FO4 and wore the Pink suit all the time, so I wanted it here.
---
So by the time I realize this exists, I'm in a situation where I need to save all my atoms and not miss more than 3 or so dailies.  It meant for most of my experience in this game, I've had to be entirely quest focused to get what I wanted.  I know that by starting the season when it starts, it won't be that way, but for me, season 1 was.
---
So, reasons because of conscious choices.
---
On the one hand, they hare asshats and I wouldn't want them to mess with my base.
---
On the other hand, I kind of like the idea of being fearful of a dastardly faction of players going around and razing people's camps in ways that are using the mechanics of the game.
---
Cant imagine they would be better with the "balancing" ....
---
Wait... I've got something for you...
---
*Checks Big Bucket O' Fucks*
---
Nah sorry, all out...
---
About the ammo thing, she only had the regular collectron, and then BOS one. So either she’s wrong and there wasn’t any ammo in it. Or something must’ve happened.  
---
But yea, I’ll try to store the collectron again. And not place him down right away.
---
I've always been a high-health build. I just never wanted to go through the trouble of having to maintain a low-health, bloodied character - it just looked like it was way too much work.
---
For me, I've found plenty of ways to be the monster on the map - including having solo'ed hundreds of Encryptid events, killed more Queens than I care to count, and routinely have Earle dead in time to get over to the Queen fight and kill her too.
---
I am not a one-shot guy, but I can put enough damage downrange to be in the solid middle. I don't expect the PTS changes will impact me all that much.
---
&gt;that the newbie player that just started 3 months from now is able to get something they didn't 'earn', thus removing the prestige of having one.
---
*sweets into brotherhood beret he unlocked day one of playing the game*
---
So glad i paid for nothing.
---
Only if they make your allies have conversations with each other. Sofia, sweetie, I know you still have nightmares, you don't have to tell me every minute im at the CAMP
---
Because the devs don’t want to add it? Because it doesn’t make sense ‘in universe’? Because it breaks immersion for a lot of people when there’s a block of text on the side of the screen? There are plenty of reason to not add it but “other games have it” isn’t a reason to add it. It costs time and resources to add it as well. Maybe they don’t see it as something worth the money to add just to cater to a handful of people.
---
So I’ve had the Santa, Raider and now BOS Collectrons. I hadn’t realized until now that a new collectron of any type can collect anything your  prior collectrons could.
---
I’m happy to have my BOS robo bringing me lots of tasty ammo and weapons on the raider setting he has access to.
---
Fun note: if you count the units of ammo per hour across all types, on the raider mode my collectron can gather almost as many units per hour as my Robco unit makes. 
---
(Though it’s spread across 5-6 ammo types)
---
Oh I never have vendors in my camp. I’m always at max caps, and if I ever spend anything (usually 2-6k) I can just make up for it in two days by selling guns to the robots.
---
I had to fight the names ghouls 4 times! I was running out of stims, ammo and the will to live. Like you I had left at one point thinking it would pick up where I left off. Nope. Back to the beginning. That’s why I stayed for the 4 named ghouls instead of giving up.
---
I hate that quest line with the fire of a thousand suns.
---
Nuclear Waste and a roll of toilet paper.
---
Sorry  [Spcmnspiff87](https://www.reddit.com/user/Spcmnspiff87/)  ... but "**less crying more playing**"
---
or change postapo F76 for some "more sweet &amp; peaceful " game ...like Barbie World ?
---
Awesome! This community is so creative and friendly, it's amazing to see what things people make. Looking forward to following for more.
---
just to put a final note on this, in case anyone cares, but after finding a reference on the bethesda forum to this error along with the comment that the user was in Egypt (which is where i am) i decided to try VPN again.  I used a different mechanism for the vpn and this time was able to get back in to the game.  played a bit last and again this morning and so far no issues (knock on wood)
---
Or when she says “oh...visitors, again”
---
What do you mean? This is MY camp.
---
Ok, better question: why is datamined in the description at all? You want "midwestern power armor" to be a thing. You having seen datamined images adds nothing to the post.
---
50k scrip and 0 items even worth keeping, alot of us unlucky people out there....
---
You don't need nerd rage anymore. Other than that it looks solid to me.
---
Do you have pictures of it?
---
You don't HAVE to have additional damage perks but that's what let's you get higher tier levels damage done and unless you're planning on investing in nothing but damage perks you'll have to choose a weapon to focus on. 
---
Some pair well enough, like heavy guns or shotguns with melee.  But if you want rifles and pistols too that's going to be building a completely different way or just doing less than optimal damage.
---
I run a T51b with Medic pump on the torso.  Between that and spamming stims I can usually hold multiple pylons as long as I avoid the ISS. 
---
I've never tried it, but I've heard equipping a full ranked Cola Nut perk and spamming Nuka Quantums is even more effective
---
I had a similar situation happen when i was taking a friend to his first nuke and guess what i did? They nuked for Earle. While the Nuke was dropping i ran to other silo and glitched trough with Power Armor straight to the control room, Nuked theyr team leader base while they were on the cave doing Earle and managed to engage the two other into PvP just to kill them and get stocked up on hundreds of fiberglass and screws lol.
---
Not much of a atom store fan, but how the fuck don’t we have skins for all weapons by now.
---
1 rank of Tenderizer in Charisma
---
THATS HOW YOU MAKE MORE BETHESDA
---
That IS interesting. Try it.
---
And each of those are NPCs with their own base scripting. Especially Ally's that have full enemy engagement.
---
When i first started last week i wandered by the dirt track where someone had apparently unlocked machines running, i didnt know any better and it didnt say steal, so i snagged a few things, got wanted for 10 caps. 
---
Then i had the opposite experience, i spent a little bit of time after trying to caft my camp and someone came through with a tesla and started zapping me, without me knowing they were even there.
---
But now i know not to touch that stuff unless its mine of course.
---
Mind you it wasnt the player at the track either, he just let me be on my merry way, with me none the wiser.
---
If you were PC I have a Junkies/FFR/Move speed while aiming LMG that I call Cricket (like the ex priest from IASIP) that I'd sell
---
16 times the detail.
---
Exactly yes, I mean surely the point of Fallout is to do whatever you want me post Great War, so they should let us do that.
---
Lucky you! I just tried on PC it didn't work.
---
Yes I sides with the raiders
---
The League of Evil is an Italian clan which is currently abusing the Explosive bait and have friends who have access to 3rd party programmes. They have developed a weapon which fires explosives baites tens at a time. Bethesda is aware of them with serious proof. They'll be taken down eventually.
---
Worse from what ive been reading on the PTS. As a handgun main im saddened to hear this.
---
But im sticking to my guns....pun intended... and staying a handgunner. Hopefully bethesda does another balance pass soon after one wasteland is released to address damage issues.
---
All slow fire weapons have taken a big hit on the PTS. The performance gap is between autos like the handmade/fixer and heavy hitters like lever action/hunting rifle is already large on live and even greater on the PTS.
---
By contrast that bard in Dragon Age Inquisition is so much better
---
Bad Horse has sent a letter in regards to these griefers.
---
*Bad Horse, Bad Horse*  
---
*A Stallion of Damnation*  
---
*An Equine to beware*  
---
*Has received the letter of grievances you’ve chosen to share*  
---
*An expression of apology*  
---
*The Bad Horse truly cares!*  
---
*He’ll make things right, a show of force!*  
---
*He’ll have these griefers feel remorse.*  
---
*Bad Horse, He’s sad!*  
---
*The true League does not condone this*  
---
*Resources will be spared*
---
*He hopes you will forgive the League of Evil*
---
*It’s the truth, he swears!*  
---
*Please enjoy your Wasteland*  
---
*With a nod and steely stare*  
---
*He expresses thanks*  
---
*The path shall correct course!*  
---
*Hi Ho, Silver*  
---
*Signed, Bad Horse*
---
Lol you tellin me you dont like ghoul slayers/ffr assaultron heads?
---
Mine had .45s in it yesterday, so she's not wrong. I thought it was weird too.
---
Honestly spawn killing during Queen is so rewarding, love getting masses and high radiation fluids for flux stabilizing
---
I was following Nukacrypt last night - and he said it looked like the PC codes were all broken, so yeah, that sucks.
---
Except do events, socialize, build camps, explore, etc.
---
So after a month go when I only had 300 scrip to spend and she gave me three bloodied weapons in a row. First was bloodied lever action second was my first bloodied fixer and third was bloodied Tesla that was the best she’s ever treated me. Since then it’s been nothing but crap crap and more crap. The last decent items I got out of 10k or more scrip was a junkies handmade and a quad guass shotgun and vampires gauss mini. I’m hoping during the sale tomorrow I can pool some amazing stuff. But we shall see
---
Actually, I’ve noticed that sometimes raiders do join in. But I think it’s just rng
---
If you have good stuff that can easily put you over the cap limit you NEED to set your vendors up in a room that can only be accessed when you allow it.  Here is my set up if you want ideas.
---
I have my vendors in a 2x2 room.  The front wall is the garage door with power running to the far left vendor.  The power continues to run through all 4 vendors and then to the power switch on the wall.  The power switch runs to a generator through a window on the back side of the vendor shop.  On the right side wall I use a door and keep it locked.  When I reach 20k caps I flip the switch which kills power to my vendors and closes the garage door.  By doing this my vendor icon disappears from the map and players can no longer access my vendors if they happen to stumble upon my camp while out roaming.  There is like a 0.5% chance someone will pick the lock on my door which would allow them access to the switch but that is a very small risk worth taking.
---
Do you mean kill the Queen in time to kill Earle? Usually the Queen is dead before the rubble even clears when both events pop.
---
It’s been around since the beginning.  No different than events where someone comes in at the end and one shots the boss.
---
Which leaves more than enough time to login to a game for 90 seconds to claim a reward. 
---
Hell, only one that really messed people up was the easter eggs since those were logins every consecutive day and if you missed any day you didn't get the end of week rewards.
---
I kept a selection of instruments around for her to jam on when she was at my CAMP. She liked to play the snare drum and Banjo quite a bit.
---
No, I kill Earle first - that should still leave about 16 - 18 mins to kill the Queen, which is more than enough time.
---
I think what everyone is overlooking is how our CAMPs are going to be overpowered by trash. There's no way turrets are going to hold off a gang of level 50 super mutants. One level 50 can wreck your whole CAMP.
---
Nice to see coming back for the first time that this game isn't actually being played for real still.
---
Ridiculous.
---
When was the reset because I used the codes last night for alpha and it worked. This Monday tho I messed up and put in wrong code for the silo. I thought I was at bravo but I was at alpha so I wasted a card. But I had 25 stocked up
---
OMG...those assaultron heads! She hands them out like candy at Halloween
---
Here is a link to their videos, which incriminate them and have gotten a positive response from bethesda in the matter being taken care of: [https://www.dailymotion.com/LeagueOfEvil/videos?sort=visited](https://www.dailymotion.com/LeagueOfEvil/videos?sort=visited)  
---
Clearly, cheats were and are being used
---
I usually drop the "Where's the damn key?" Note on their porch.
---
And your replying to me because of the word datamined Bethesda makes poor choice when it comes to power armor skins and the atomic shop isn't even canon so I'm just fallowing the rules ok I know whats the new power armor skins look like I just don't want to spoil it that's why I put spoiler's
---
The closes one I have was the sledge hammer with no head glitch  but idk if that counts
---
MY PRECIOUS!!! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!?!?
---
Of what
---
Have you tried actually collecting the silo pieces necessary to give you the proper code instead of relying on nukacrypt?
---
Hahahaha you're so fucking wrong it's pathetic. Just say you're salty over people exploiting events and move on. But absolutely do not try and bullshit everyone about XP gains at all these locations vs LitS
---
1 spawn is easily 20+ scorched
---
I've had 6-8 spawns per wave
---
Conservatively let's say 2000xp per spawn. 
---
42k XP per event? You're not getting that running WS / WestTek / Harper's Ferry. 
---
So keep on running your mouth... Ultimately you're just sour about people gaining XP easier than you.
---
Well I’d buy your 5.56 what platform are you on how much do you sell them for I’ve never got enough and am so over lead farming 🙄
---
&gt;  I would just sell them for 100 caps each. They always went quick.
---
I bet they did!  haha
---
Bloodied sneak is what gives those semi-auto's their kick, but in the PTS, that's not really going to help much anymore &amp; will be completely useless during daily ops.
---
Expect to see a lot more commando builds shortly.
---
When ever I want to trade just to see what they have they always go for my harpoon, their should be a thing where favorited weapons don’t show in trade menu.
---
I have this happen all the time too. It seems like a gross flex more then anything else. God forbid anyone not trying to BS exploit through a silo. I think in their mind " They going to be like, damnnn aha how this guy lap me in silo?" They need to change it so that if someone's already in a Silo you won't be able to enter unless you are on their team. Let's face it you can't have this game without bugs, but I'd like to see some change. I've seen countless friends have their whole weekend ruined because of some bored, high level ass hat. RNG be with you guys!
---
YEAH BETHESDA! GIVE US EVERYTHING IN THE GAME AT A 100% CHANCE!
---
THE WAY EVERY OTHER LOOT GAME IS SET UP IS WRONG
---
WE NEED 100% DROP RATE!
---
Dumb
---
Don't feel bad, most of us have been wandering the real world that way too.
---
Well you said it was data mined. And that you’ve seen the new power armor skins, so do you have the pictures of the new data mined skins or are you just gonna leave us with you saw something cool and not share it?
---
Right, I'll remember it for the next time.
---
I'm level 153 and just found out about Smiley last week.
---
Especially since you get 1500 atoms free for just completing the run so you could technically buy the last 10 levels and never pay a penny out of pocket.
---
Don’t do it, there’s no way to tell murmrgh you only want level 45 weapons, so you end up getting a bunch of level 40 weapons. It takes only a few hours of farming to reach 50 anyways.
---
They got added to the AA perk cards cards so its better in my book.
---
Ive seen it go too the YouTube channel called Bungo his video has a link to the datamined discord
---
Seems to me like it's still possible to min-max, but different things have priority now that everything is calculated differently. Crits for VATS builds and possibly power attack spam for melee builds became a lot more important. Honestly, it's kind of freeing not needing to slot 9 weapon damage perks. More room for time-saving QoL stuff.
---
Sounds like these people may be violating the new code of conduct? Anyone have the specific language or section they would be in violation of?
---
Man I'm more excited for legendary perks than I thought I'd be. Especially if electrical absorption is suppose to heal you like it currently does.
---
I'll have enough coins to max 3 cards, and get one to r2, and I'm stocked to get to it haha
---
I'm honestly thinking about going CAMP-less. At the moment, at least, there are enough CAMPs around the map that you can always use someone else's, especially if you join their public team and get a free fast travel spot out of it. I might blueprint my vendor building and just plop it down at random spots if I feel like unloading some inventory/providing supplies at boss events like SBQ.
---
We dod
---
I used them on the first half of the board when my next reward was 150 atoms.  That way I basically skipped ahead to the next prize and wasn't really out any atoms since what I spent I immediately got back
---
spamming stimpack is not tanking ...  
---
i make you survive but if you spend 40 stimpack for a 15 minutes event, you are doing something wrong
---
Cool, I'd love to see your CAMP with the ammo factories. What's your IGN?
---
thanks for the kind words. I hope people like it. and I'm always interested in hearing critiques so I can make improvements.
---
Ahh good
---
I think angry turtle said that it’s just a visual bug
---
PLOT TWIST it’s motivating people to stay off the game, oof.
---
What perk cards do u need to tame a pet
---
hope you like it. There's only about an hour of Fallout content right now but there will be more! I'm really having fun making the videos. Even if they do suck. =)
---
All of this. But regarding the fastest way to max out raider rep: Rocksy glitch it is.
---
See it In multiple camps on Xbox per server these days
---
Yeah like theres some free 'hide' emotes on sea of thieves, they have been free for ages and still there in the shop for free, so when we help out new players we tell the to go pick up those free emotes and are guiding people to the store
---
I really can't tell if you're serious or not.
---
I still after two years will find something new in game
---
In fairness, I don't think that understanding the underlying psychology of your target audience on order to make their experience better and in turn make more money is scummy. If benefits everyone, and I don't think anyone here would argue against that.
---
However, a lot of companies don't seem to do this - they use the psychology to understand how to manipulate players into giving them money without providing the feel satisfaction (or at least, also adding some resentment), presumably because it has a lower cost/return ratio (at least in the short term). That is what is often considered scummy, and given how many complains are posted here about various aspects of the game (in particular time gates, grinds and making daily gameplay logins feel like chores), I guess the general consensus is that either they're trying to do the latter, or just spectacularly failing to do the former.
---
The site OP link to says:
---
"Reinforcement schedules can be used for a wide variety of things in games. The most important thing about them, however, is that they make players want to keep playing the game and feel good about their achievements. Understanding these aspects of reinforcement schedules will help you build a set of rules for your game to keep it fun throughout the entire game, not just for a short period of time."
---
This is what the massively grind focus reinforcement that Bethesda have added fails on, because while it does keep people coming back, it detriments their enjoyment of the game.
---
In fairness to Bethesda, I do think some of the rewards in the game are done well. One reward system which I think is not mentioned enough here (and is one not often found in other games) is the rare but random encounters you can come across in the game, like the guy being attacked by a chicken, the observant radstag, and the pied eyebot. I've love those encounters and every time I have one it makes the game feel new and interesting.
---
Correct
---
Heres a little tidbit for reference to show how skewed things are in the current live game. Numbers are with no perks and the strongest receiver for each gun. Perks along mechanics such as crits and sneak further the performance gap.

Bingo doesn’t have a midwestern skin. Are you referring to the Enclave power armor skin. Because  I’m in the discord and have been subscribed for awhile. No midwestern power armor skins. Also if you did see it on a YouTube video you should link it in the post to give credit to the person who data mined it/showed the content.
---
The Season is over so there's no point to having them I guess.
---
Season is over. They'll be back in a week or so with a new season. Just give it a bit.
---
Yea i get lazy without an excuse to ‘have to’ play. Sometimes when I have nothing to do i play for hours, then there are times I only login and dump some scrips at murmrgh and be done for the day. Completely removing daily atoms isn’t a smart thing to do since they really want people to play some every day.
---
I think the line between prank and aggression is blurry when there's no repercussion.
---
Oh boy. The season is over so there's no challenges this week. When season 2 starts, challenges will return.
---
I never said it was datamined I said we need It
---
Is this on all platforms, I haven’t noticed this  on Xbox.
---
It’s great that more locations are getting a overhaul considering people have moved back to Appalachia.
---
To answer your question ; use the username/email that is associated on [bethesda.com](https://bethesda.com) 
---
you should have your PS4 account linked to Bethesda
---
Didn't they raise the level of turrets on the PTS?
---
It gives me 200 5.56 everytime I go to camp every other hour.its ok.not o.p
---
I noticed last night that I still have 18 left from the Run.
---
I wish to be able to build a city full of life in my camp, until they add a text chat at least cause i'm forced to play alone lol :D 
---
I still love this game anyway :D
---
At launch you could demolish whole camps without even being engaged in pvp . The dev team had no idea how much of this player base was going to be carebear/pusses/repairable pixel lovers
---
It's nowhere near enough
---
Some new music for radio PLEASE
---
It should either be automatically added to your account or just be in the store indefinitely idc if people who didn’t help get it, I’d rather be guaranteed my reward and leaches also get it than to not get it at all
---
I like to get one shot in with a pistol and walk away.but if there is an asshat that one shots the lego I'll do the same to get on that level
---
Not sure why this got downvoted, it might be true. Marketing is a very real thing, especially for this game.
---
I could give 2 sh*ts about trash bos redskins but this had no thought process by bethesda.  The whole event is rigged so you cannt leave it up for a week?  I get it you didn't travel for the biggest traveling weekend of the summer in the US, but alot of people did.  It is another sign(I love this game) that bethesda is detached from the customer base or dont care about your time.
---
If it took the entire 15 minutes then yeah you're right, it probably wouldn't be worth it.  In my experience, though, its usually over much more quickly than that.  Plus, more people know what they're doing now and I rarely have to grab multiple pylons.  With grabbing a single pylon, the spamming rate drops considerably.
---
best places in my opinion are the Charleston building, the generals Steakhouse, and white springs, and probably others I've forgotten but those locations are worth looking into since you'll find ghouls and mutants who can be legendary. and after you wipe any of those places out then server hop and rinse and repeat.
---
You said you looked at the ones which were actually datamined and think a midwestern would be better.
---
I remember when WoW did this years ago for the opening of an’Qiraj or whatever it was called. Everyone had to donate supplies to open a new raid. They incentivized it by only opening the raid when all goals were met. As a result all the guilds wanted to be the first to defeat the raid, so they had an advantage if they could be on the first server to open the raid. Made everyone on the server want to donate stuff, so their server could be called the best even if their guild couldn’t beat the raid.
---
Why fallout is missing is a sense of community or even consequence on a server. There is no doing good things for the benefit of the server. You can just hop off and get on a better one.
---
Animal Friend or Wasteland Whisperer depending on what you want to tame I believe! IIRC you need to be higher level than what you want to tame, it must be a solo, random spawn of that creature, and then you have to pray to Todd that it makes it back to your camp alive and doesn't get randomly get sucked through the ground texture or die to a super mutant taking pot shots from outside your turrets' line of sight. 
---
I think there are definitely some better guides out there if you hunt around the sub a bit.
---
They aren't changing that. You still need to tag them.
---
God damnit there's a sale tomorrow??? I just spent 200 scrip
---
I apologize I had misread the post, I thought you had said that you wanted the midwestern when it came out. I would like to apologize for misreading your post.
---
Best place when I was getting started was all of white springs.. a lot of ghoul legendarys use to appear there but now I’m not sure cause of the patches.. I haven’t farmed legendarys for a while. Sorry..
---
It’s going to be like the old days where 10+ people show up . Better pick the right spawn to camp
---
Last Purveyor sale I got 3 or 4 black powder rifles in a row. I think I might sit this one out lol
---
On PC, they appear to be broken.
---
On Xbox, the codes from last week still work.
---
I have quite a few left over from The Legendary Run.  The only time I use them are either when waiting for Colossal Problem to launch or during Scorched Earth and even then the most I use is four so they last a little longer
---
Literally just jumped back on FO76 yesterday so I didn't even know about this season thing. Thanks:)
---
I'd do Radicool instead of iron clad.
---
Do we have to support the BLM org?  
---
I dunno if i want to support people who can't stop burning buildings, harassing people who are eating at restaurants and blocking roads.
---
Agreed. I think it'd be a nice reward for completing beckett &amp; sofia's quests to be able to get them at your camp plus a normal ally, i.e. you could have 3 camp allies if you've completed both questlines. At the end of each questline I told each of them that they could stay as long as they like, but apparently one of them has to go out into the wilderness because of game limitations.
---
Even if there have to be alternate versions of beckett's bar/sofia's console added, say the normal one that's currently in the game and another version if you want the permanent ally, with the latter taking up more camp budget to make up for the server load of the extra NPCs. It'd just be nice to have the option.
---
You can also do Riding Shotgun (at the East End of the Big Bend Tunnel), guaranteed you'll see at least a few Legendary Blood Eagles in there.
---
I have been playing since beta, I'm only Lvl 194, I have possibly one of the best locations for a camp, up near Crater, with both a Lead deposit and a Junk deposit. I leave the junk one unlocked and a water purifier, as well as, my garden and Turbo-Fert accessible. Some Griefer came to my camp, took everything that was free, bought a flaming chainsaw from my vendor and attacked me with it while I was loading new items into the vendor. I let him buzz me for a second, then I came out of the vending machine screen and one-shotted him dead. Man, that felt good. I've been noticing that there's been a rash of stupidly-high prices at vendors, as well as, just a shitty pile of junk for sale lately. I have been using the "dumbass" note for a while. I am adding the "shit bag" to my repertoire, thank you!
---
I told my wife when this started that this wouldn’t and couldn’t fail, “please don’t waste your steel” she hasn’t, I haven’t, and as we suspected, all goals are met even the ridiculous ones.
---
Lol. I'm sure you're an absolute joy of a person to be around so I'm certain  your company loved having you around for the holidays. 
---
First off, it's an international game, so everything isn't geared towards US holidays. 
---
Second, the 99% of the player base had no problem getting it. 
---
If it is important enough for you to spend an hour rambling on reddit about it, it would have been something you definitely had the time to grab in game. You just weren't paying attention and missed out and it's easier to blame Bethesda than taking any personal accountability.
---
This would give a reason for why we only get 90% of the sale at least lol
---
You do know you can store/scrap your vendors right? If you're getting close to the cap limit, just put them away until you need them again. Personal responsibility is a good thing.
---
Guess I'll wait for "Two Wastelanders" to dust off all of the "some day" pistols I've been hoarding. ☹
---
Bethesda never fails to surprise me with their mess ups.
---
Its fine I'm here trying to make that a thing since Bethesda is reusing some of tactics Gauss weapons then they could add the power armor
---
this is on purpose. bethesda left this "bug" in so that players will have to rebuild their entire camps which means weeks/months of work so you're required to play a lot more than you were planning to. say what you want but todd howard is a genius when it comes to making money.
---
Imagine shooting that flying fuck and missing out on the mask
---
I deleted my post because I don't have enough energy to argue with people on Reddit about something I'm honestly already exhausted talking about with a subreddit mod about in my inbox. I know it thought I was making a trade Post but when I messaged the subreddit mod about it he told me he wasn't going to approve it anyway because it was "a retired suggestion" which is dumb and now I've got a bunch of people trying to s*** on me for wanting to complain about something that obviously other people care about and I'm not honestly paying attention to any of that because I'm somewhat new to Reddit and I don't care that much, I never even realized this was a fan subreddit otherwise I wouldn't be here. I'm just frustrated that I got my f****** legacy stolen.
---
NP.  I completely understand, it is a learning curve.  I'm something like 1300+ hours in, and still have a lot to figure out :)
---
  Short story is  what you see in the pip boy does not reflect actual/max damage inflicted by a given weapon.  The number can be significantly different depending on your perks and the type of critter you are fighting.   
---
Turn on display damage numbers in game settings.   Experiment to find what works best for you.
---
There's that challenge for killing 76 wanted players I believe so if I see someone wanted I kill them.
---
Yeah they kinda took the survival out didn't they. The most fun pvp I had was back when that was possible.
---
A lot of entitlement in this sub from them
---
Socialize... nice concept, except w/o chat not really doable.
---
Events... Why? If we have everything there is nothing left to gain there.
---
Explore... sure, but I highly doubt there is anything left after 2 years of exploring.
---
That leaves camp building, I'd LOVE to do that, but the building system is so fucked up that it's become too frustrating.
---
etc... that's exactly the incentive that I mentioned in my first post.
---
They also have micro penis
---
Also with how fucked the US is atm with covid you really shouldn't be travelling
---
Upvoted for using the word "twats"
---
To summarize, there really isn't a ton of new stuff in terms of mechanics. A new boss event, some new gear, but all in all, fundamentally the same game you left. The big new thing will be damage recalculation. Enemies will be a bit more spongy, but with One Wasteland lowbies and highbies can play together more effectively. That might be something that interests you. Check out One Wasteland and see if it catches your attention.
---
I haven't had a single turret at my camp in 1.5 years. I was surpised as hell a few weeks ago when I lost two blackberry bushes to a stray dog.
---
Camp placement &gt; camp defences. Don't place your camp on a spawn mode.
---
my favourite thing to do in game is to run at low level people in raider power armour i don't know if it's a fallout 4 reaction but a lot of them flee the ones that don't i give stuff to
---
Yee, and so afraid to miss out. Its just a 1* most times ffs.
---
I also think its not the best thing for everyone to circle it as bash it slowly to death. Besides id picture it horrifying on the mole miners end (lol), it can happen that one of the later arriving players rushes around the corner, sees how many ppl are already there and goes full force as a panic reaction.
---
This, plus the xp is good as well
---
Considering that this was said recently, I think you'll all be okay. `Next, we’re adding a number of last Season’s rewards, like Lunchboxes, the Ammo Converter, and Chicken Coop, among others, to Gold Bullion vendors. This will give players who missed these items during The Legendary Run another chance to snatch them up.`
---
Oh god no. Just no. I can barely tolerate having one in my CAMP especially after all of their dialogue has been exhausted. I got rid of Beckett as soon as his quests were over, Sophia lasted a little longer but not by much, I had the old pull my finger guy for about 10 minutes, the raider radio guy lasted about as long. The only Ally I could stomach for any length of time was The Settler Wanderer (wish we could name them).
---
What’s the fun in that only time I see it fit is when using a tesla
---
not if u stash it all in my box. u should be fine
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6B24sQjpl8X7fWxQS6PjyF/atomic-shop-weekly-update-september-8-15
---
Look here, at free items. Says it’s available forever.
---
Because the sub is full of trolls that can't accept alternative opinions to their own. 
---
Hell, have the active subscribers here have either never played the game or played for two weeks at BETA and just spend every waking moment coming in to trash talk while masturbating to pictures of the Mojave.
---
Just a bit of a tip but only animals spawning in random encounter locations individually can be tamed and sent to your camp as a pet, so that means you can’t just go to the deathclaw island and get one (I tried it many times).
---
My stepfather quit too because of these assholes. He plays fo4 now.
---
Point 1.  Start with a personal attack.
---
Point 2. Everyone knows its international game.  Still doesnt mean you don't pay attention.  Sure they knew it was Labor day weekend in Austin.
---
Point 3.  Make up fake number of redemption stats.
---
Point 4. Over exaggerate now 3 posts as a time consuming effort and make another attack about rambling.
---
Point 5. Say I am not personally accountable when I don't care and was offering support for people wanted a  new item.
---
Paint reddit by numbers.
---
Play smarter not harder! Plus more legendary spawns too
---
Excellent! Yesterday I blew 1000 scrip on him!
---
yay the hourly le appreciate le high level players thread! easiest upboats ever
---
I didn’t even know the collectron was a thing. I’m visiting with my grandma so I won’t be on till next Monday AT LEAST
---
I dont know how but that would be cool.
---
Turrets are leveled to you in pts.  They'll be as strong as the enemies you encounter
---
I'm curious how you deal with other players? It's an awesome idea, and I think it will turn out well. I just hope you don't have to deal with too many asshole immersionbreaking players.
---
Are you talking about the key cards or the codes (they’re useless with nukacrypt).
---
yes.
---
You can easily get 200 x 5.56 rounds from it in 15-25 mins.
---
They'll definitely still matter.  If anything, they're more important.
---
I would love for an account wide stash box.  Doesn't even need to hold caps but that would be nice too.
---
It's just visual
---
No problem, anything helps! I’ll give it a shot and see how it goes
---
I got rid of all the allies after a while. Now I want to set up a theremin and see what happens
---
Hehehe (shit, I almost hit report by accident!)
---
That's an image I don't want in my head, thanks for that : P
---
https://acleddata.com/2020/08/31/us-crisis-monitor-releases-full-data-for-summer-2020/
---
If you believe that BLM is filled with violent rioters, you might want to take a second look at your media sources you're consuming.
---
To summarize the non-partisan data: 5% of all protests since George Floyd were violent. With the majority of the violence being instigated by police forces.
---
Take that how you will.
---
Yeah it’s tomorrow. Half off everything. I’ve been trying to save but I spent 300 night before and didn’t get nothing good but I should have 800 for sale
---
A lot of people are probably in the same boat
---
Yeah let us buy improved repair kits or even lunch boxes.
---
Yeah, I have zero turrets at my camp. If you place your camp near a critter spawn (e.g. rabbits and fireflies), there are almost never any random mobs attacking. I've had maybe 3 attacks in as many months.
---
Point 6. Use poorly executed attempts to number distractions as a way to appear more educated than you are. 
---
I'm sure you think you're making good points. The rest of us just don't agree. 
---
And since it doesn't matter to you, then your opinions likewise do not matter. 
---
I'll probably never use the Bos reskin or fatigues but I grabbed them anyway, for me and my wife's account.  About 2 min flat both days. Somehow I found the time despite my busy life schedule.
---
The proximity things on stuff like team medic and medic weapons is absolutely tiny so  I'm hoping that's not the case. I can double check
---
Is that so? I might have to go back and try that out real fast. Interesting.
---
This is exactly why Fallout should never have been an online, MMO style game. Its just not suited for it.
---
Fallout has always been an RPG, and when you try and bastardize it for this sort of moneymaking scheme, the only result for the players will be irritation and frustration.
---
Sweet! Thank you
---
After 25 Gauss Miniguns, still no bloodied
---
Riding shotgun always has at least one 3 star in the middle and usually spawns a few more within the regular enemies. A colossal problem also gives a few if you can handle that event.
---
Wow that’s pretty sweet.
---
See? Not all of us high levels are assholes 😎
---
They dont thats why only casuals play this mess now.
---
At any given time, there's typically between 1 and 5 legendarys at WS.
---
Uranium fever has 3, but you may or may not get a shot in depending on who else is there.
---
With a decent auto/semi-auto, UF is solo-able.
---
There's 4 at Leader of the Pack (by tyler county fairground).  I'm guessing drops for this one will be better once One Wasteland happens.
---
Most I've seen at Radiation Rumble has been 4, but like UF, you may not get a shot in depending on who's there, and I'd venture it would be really tough to do at L40.  (If you cannot solo survive the WS golf clubhouse during a nuke, then RR is going to frustrate you.)
---
Pro tip.  You don't have to hit Fissure Prime to trigger SBQ.  if they centred it over the fissure immediately to the west, that's fine, that will still trigger Scorched Earth and gives the most possible room to fight SBQ out of rads - even though Fissure Prime is completely outside the blast zone.
---
Good point. Not a weird easter egg waiting to be found, have you really tried everyone you've come across?
---
I've been playing on PC and have yet to encounter griefing at level 80. I have encountered lots of players that love to give away gear to lower levels. Say what you want about FO76 as a game, but the community is top-notch.
---
The actual launch code itself
---
Damn you nailed me!
---
Kinky
---
It will be recycled back in 3 months
---
Site charlie
---
Their obvious goal is to get people logging on as often as possible so they’ll shop. This is clearly the idea with their popping free stuff into the shop for a minute.
---
You'd think they would, but they aren't. That event is about to get a whole lot more toxic.
---
Neither of them work on PS4
---
Eerily similar to the imposter sheepsquach.
---
Um...Yeah, that's why I'm dropping plans and ammo...not because I'm over encumbered...
---
Don't you be trying to take me.from my freedom of visiting great great aunt bessie on labor day you socialist.
---
I’ve run that one and barely made it out. Took a good 5 stims from me
---
My favorite of hers is "I was wondering if you're coming back". Well shit, sorry for inconvenience! You can go tell your side boyfriend that I didn't die again, maybe more luck next time when I leave for supplies and caps, something will finally end me!
---
Nwithe rif them work on PS4 :(
---
When they broke Adrenaline they also broke Tenderizer/Gun Fu; Gun Fu would switch targets but neither perk added the extra damage. The next patch specifically mentioned fixing Adrenaline, but they didn’t say if they fixed Tenderizer/Gun Fu too. 
---
I took them out of my build so I haven’t had the chance to test.
---
You need better handmade. Using furious on any rifle even automatic one is waste of ammo.
---
but you didn't have to mention the datamined stuff at all. you could just say "I want midwestern-themed PA skins".
---
""Yeah but then it becomes fallout 4 which is just a soulless fallout themed theme park with no life or uniqueness that makes fallout what it is.""
---
Thats not true, they added there own Lore and Factions and unique Storys and ideas but at the same time.
---
""so they’re bound to have the same factions but then they also added so much more unique stuff ontop.""
---
Like Bethesda. Or putting a entire Faction into the Game (Legion) that cannot survive against the Enemys they are facing and even and in the end the story collides with each other if it comes to the remains of the Enclave and the Legion.
---
""""Fallout 3 and 4 don’t have that same interconnected feeling that the original games had because they’ve taken so much from the old that the new stuff just looks average in comparison.""""
---
For you yes, not for everyone. Not taking something from older Games would be stupid and collides with your first Argument. 
---
The whole new Storys makes more sense then the standart stuff we got for example in Fallout 2 with the Enclave.Wich makes no sense in some parts.
---
I leave my doors locked simply to troll people who get all pissy about locked doors!
---
I used old codes and it worked yesterday
---
Well fuck me I have 2 scrip lol
---
I got a Furious/Swing Speed moleminer gauntlet from her a little bit ago. Hoping for the same effects on something better like a powerfist or deathclaw, but otherwise not too bad. I use it for bosses mainly, for everything else I got an instigating/power attack deathclaw, but that was from a player. 
---
That moleminer gauntlet is probably the best thing I've gotten from her though. Lots of knuckles, canes, and rolling pins...
---
Oh ok what do you suggest 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
I've bought two, and never gotten one from the stupid event since they added it.
---
Thats lazy
---
Thats why you might be able to extract some DNA material to make a serum that lets you keep your human self.
---
Hint: Company Tea. If you're an herbivore, it's a game changer.
---
Thanks for the help. I’ll stick to the lower ones for a bit and then work my way up
---
This wasn't a legendary run item though. Hope you're right of course for those that missed out, but I wouldn't take it for granted that it will happen.
---
""Took you 20 days to come up with that little zinger? Damn sure put me in my place :p""
---
Because i am not online all the time. :p
---
And again, People have a different Goal if they go to events. Dont get me wrong, i think its stupid too because i would take the Boss too. But thats the same level of complain like complaining about other Players not shooting a nuke where you want.
---
They should maybe update allies to only sit/walk around in camp. And muted, so you would have to active communication.
---
That is a great idea. I bet I could reduce Strength to 1 and sell/drop a bunch of the chems/aid I carry and move that over to Charisma for Tenderizer. Then maybe use Bandolier instead of Traveling Pharmacy since now I'm carrying thousands of 5.56 rounds.
---
I've literally never had anyone randomly try to trade with me in game
---
Unless you want to do bloodied or junkies, I'd say anti armor or two-shot.
---
The what now?
---
Interesting. Thanks for the info.
---
Yelling?  Can't hear yelling in local if you're in a party chat on PS4.  Don't know how it works in other platforms but I'd never assume someone can hear me
---
I want.
---
it will be back in 6-12 months
---
Charlie still doesn’t work on Xbox
---
I’ve tried every location. In silo gyms for example I didn’t jump from bike to bike but stayed on one long enough to see if a bonus kicked in. Really expected something from the ones at Hornwright Estates but alas I think they’re all the same exact model/specs.
---
It did last night.
---
Shhhh
---
""U mean the new players which are also get drowned with it? Did you played a new character recently? Every event, every quest and every player spams you with this crap.""
---
And everyone is doing Events ? I remember completle igonrig them at the beginning. Depends on Playstyle.
---
""Shouldn't be the season for everyone,""
---
Yeah you say it, thats why some rewards become placeholders for some Players. Or Nukecards, People complain they dont have much time for a MMO and some parts are too time consuming and now they are giving them what they want.
---
Remember, there are People who complain that they dont get any Ammo or common Junk.
---
Anyone know if this is fixed yet?  Bout to try a silo run.  Gonna hit charlie bc it worked for me yesterday.
---
They scale, yeah! Both XP wise and loot wise.
---
I use toxic water from grafton think it's about 30 rads a pop as I have to cure some rads and change weapons as well found a low lvl explosive lever action works great or just gun bash leg. And fair game on the rest.
---
Ugghhhh I can't wait until they allow mods on the consoles...if they ever do
---
I am next to a floater spawn - all three of them at level 50 has me thinking of moving CAMP.  I kind of like the idea of One Wasteland for leveling up for events, but the whole reason for building a CAMP in the Forest is for a little peace and quiet and minimal interruption. LOL.
---
Better yet turn all hacked equipment items into -15 to all Special attributes and make it automatically equipped and unable to be unequipped or removed from inventory.
---
So, about this Midwestern power armor that doesn't exist. Does it look like an ear of corn?
---
Ok. I can’t see it becoming a thing. Lore wise there would have to be a race of ghouls or supermutants that emerged that we’re civilised and human like. And they do like to keep the lore of the game.
---
I walked out on her a week ago and didn’t go back. The sale may draw me back in. She knows how to play me.
---
Oh duly noted then. My mistake.
---
I just had the same thought this morning!
---
Not with glitches and breaking the code of conduct bro
---
If you have any other questions, PM me so as not to clog up the feed.
---
The Npc's curse.  We should be able to.  I do use language, but not about other players.   It's usually "where the f*ck did that assaultron go?"
---
Beckett has a quest line that randomly spawns a traveling merchant that comes and chills in your camp. He sells “bulk ammo scrap” also and is quite worth it. One thing I don’t know is if his caps are shared to the railroad vendors
---
Not to be a dick, but if you put something into the public sphere, you should be willing and ready to stand by what you said, if you arent willing, keep it locked in your head.
---
If you knew it was because it was flagged as a trading post... why the misleading post here about how you were being censored?
---
As for your problem, almost everyday someone posts about how we need a better trade system. I myself have brought it up several times in comments.
---
I know losing an important item is very damaging for any of us, but always take some time to get your emotions in check, before you react.
---
I also know your new to reddit, but if you want to make thing easier, learn to always check each subreddits rules before posting, and learn to use the search function, its super easy once you get it. I can even try to help explain it if you want.
---
But most importantly, dont try to bs or mislead people, sooner or later someone will fact check you or call you out on it.
---
So the Police are the ones burning buildings, harassing people who are eating at restaurants and blocking traffic?
---
This just made me think of a youtuber called the spiffingbrit and his Skyrim videos.
---
PS queen doesn't land because people stand on things she can't find a path to.  Drop the nuke in a place that minimises the opportunity for people to stand on fences and she lands ok.  Also, don't stagger her while she's in the landing animation.  But it's fine for someone with a thousand levels to say this, however 99% of players are never going to hear / know about it and will keep on doing what they do :(
---
A collosol problem, if u survive at the end....just stay out of the way just before he dies and pop a stim.....will give a 3 star on earles body another when the timer runs out, you don’t have to escape the mine to get it and the chance of a 3 star harpoon/shovel/pick axe from the cursed loot pool
---
It also counts 3 people as protests so...... 
---
That’s inflated as hell
---
You’re always on the front page lol
---
Making a free item available for an extremely limited time during a holiday weekend known for camping and lake houses is just being a shitty to your community.
---
""  its common courtesy  ""  
---
Dont get me wrong dude, but its the Wasteland. Nobody needs to be nice to other Players. Is this a think i think its good ? No, not really.  
---
Do i think the PvP makes not much sense ? Yes.  
---
"" Ya'll are the reason why we have the best community ""  
---
Well thats my main problem with the Game, i would wich we get more Factions we can actually join to have a resone to hate other Players and to fight them. Well if they change the PvP System.
---
Maybe teach them the fasnacht music.........
---
Hmmm...maybe if I get really bored I'll try riding the cycles again, like all of them in a single location. See if something happens.
---
If you change the resolution on the ps4, it still renders in 1080 and then downscales to 720. So you are putting even more stress on the machine.
---
Have you used it? That weapon is actually fantastic
---
ok quick question since you are a person who reports people, would you report sings that say "No Mutants" because i have a sign like that in my camp a homage to [this](https://img3.goodfon.com/wallpaper/nbig/0/7c/fallout-postapokalipsis.jpg) or when i am in a fight with someone jumping around with the Marsupial mutation while they try to claim my workshop i'll often yell "get down here and fight like a Human Mutie" as once again a homage to [this](https://youtu.be/MzO54anEkMI?t=147) would you consider any of this to be reportable or just role playing a Enclave solider
---
Fair enough. Private worlds interestingly enough is the one that I thought is usually a freebie.
---
It's not been dead today, enough people showed up both times I did it, to finish it easily in time.  No the problem was both times I either died right at the end and the respawn counter stopped me from getting back to loot Earle before the tunnel collapse,  or the second time, I got RESPAWN (X) stuck and decided to watch Netflix instead.
---
The last 3 runs I have done I have straight up forgotten to loot him at all.  Not because I couldn't find him, just get distracted and forget until I end up outside one way or another.
---
That's like 2 one star rolling pins and 1 one star wood arm I have probably missed out on!
---
Bobcat fire?
---
I don’t run explosives so have blocker and bandolier in strength and radicool in endurance. Why have u got the pharmacy weight red perk if you’re bloodied?
---
Well, that's unfortunate. I had a level 170 secondary that was jist ripe to get me a load of perk coins for my main...
---
You're thinking of Tanagra Town
---
Awesome! That event is pretty difficult solo but I managed. Hopefully my buddies will be available to help next time
---
U soloed ACP at level 40?  How?
---
explain the fuck out of all the Chinese items in the atomic shop
---
You should be aware then that the Daily/Weekly Challenges for Atoms are gone forever.
---
Thankfully it's easier getting perk coins than initially thought, so you'll get there fine.
---
West Tek almost always has 2 legendary enemies but might be a reach at this point for you. I was able to easily clear it with my stealth melee build, because you can sneak around and they don’t gang up on you. With almost any other character though, it can quickly turn sour. 
---
Don’t see that anyone has answered your other question. You cannot trigger the events, they are on a cycle. Riding Shotgun is the only exception (except the boss fights like Scorched Beast Queen and the Wendigo). If you see a lot of people doing the SBQ you can join in at level 40. You will get at least one legendary armor piece out of it. 
---
Also, do the Horde events. Guaranteed one legendary,  some people have a strategy to milk a lot more out of those. There is a few threads in this sub that explain the strategy. I don’t have the patience for it personally. 
---
Also, One Violent Night is usually good for 2-3 legendary enemies if you count the boss at the end.
---
Lol, yeh rookie numbers that don't even add up kid, Go away and annoy someone else with your bullshit.
---
I may or may not have had a LOT of luck involved, grenades, lucky mysterious stranger pulls, and a lot of stims.
---
You can put it in a display, but it becomes invisible. Much like 60% of things we can put in displays right now.
---
oh, and unless the change the reward format, when meat week 2 comes back, you will want to run it as often as possible.  You will get a level appropriate weapon or armor if the event ends successfully.   
---
Bonus: if you have done the vault raid, you'll also get Treasury notes. 
---
bonus2: easy access to grahm, who carries some unique plans.
---
The game isn't exclusive to the US, my dude. Also, I live in the US and was able to get the prize.
---
I too am stuck in that cycle - i feel your pain
---
That's a good question and I'm thinking about getting rid of Traveling Pharmacy and replacing it with Bandolier. I carry a lot of chems but I may sell the bulk of them.
---
Bethesda: We took it down because we discovered an explout associated with it. We will release it in 2 years time with twice as many bugs.
---
Thank you for your sacrifice.
---
Some people don't get the 'online' and 'multiplayer' part of FO76 being an online multiplayer game.  Every time someone wants something instanced (or even private worlds imho) i just think, go play FO4?!  But I know FO76 is far more of a coop game than most, and it's fair for people to have different expectations.  But to believe there's unwritten universal codes of conduct and to feel cheated when someone offends you, though they broke no rules and did nothing wrong.. harden up people.
---
Its....bOs
---
Bird bones mutation. I haven't needed any fall damage reduction armor or perks since I got it and I run both marsupial and jetpack.
---
Most of the Chinese items have the phrase "美帝必败" written on them, meaning roughly "The defeat of the American Imperialists is inevitable," but that's all I can recall reading off the top of my head.
---
I want to find the person that picked the recording for the theramin and play it for them in loop.
---
Big rip. I just rolled 3 3* junk guns from purveyor last night.
---
Even with all that it’s hard to see how u could generate enough damage to dent Earle let alone kill the dozens of wendigos that spawn. Well done tho
---
How do I know if I have it? thanks
---
Can't believe I never thought to try this before.  My TV is only a 43" so I prob won't even notice much of a difference visually stepping down to 720. If this does boost performance, it'd be worth the trade off.
---
Gonna test this now. Thanks for sharing man! 👍
---
Lol no? Pertaining to the game “muties, ghouls, bos” I don’t think that would apply to real life racism and bigotry. Like you said it’s role playing. Here’s an example of a recent report   https://imgur.com/gallery/qlM9X67
---
And No it’s not the guy on my team.
---
It happens, no big deal!
---
What? the atomic isn't canon anyways
---
No, they are the ones putting their knee on the back of a defenseless man's neck until he stops breathing.
---
Like any rational person, nobody thinks *all* police are bad.... Not sure why its ok for protesters to be painted with the same broad brush then.  There is probably an equal percentage of "bad cops" as there are destructive rioters.
---
Place you power armour in the doorway  👍 
---
Keeps them out for a while.
---
I mostly deal with spawns during CP and help people with taking out Earl because shotgun build kinda not so great
---
Huh. Still, I wish that watch was at least worth something.
---
That's not robbery, it's just playing smart and making easy money. Crops sell for a lot.
---
Blocker really helps as well with commando because generally you’ll get swamped and it mitigates an awful lot of damage
---
It’s possible someone looted your collectron before you checked it?
---
I didn't buy a level until around the 80 mark - the one where you are awarded 150 atoms, (same price as buying the level)  Effectively, it was a free level.
---
Legit couldn’t care less
---
But you actually didn’t respond to any point I made in my post. Don’t worry though, you’re weirdo answer isn’t needed
---
That invis quest flag is a bish
---
Can confirm gun Fu works
---
I just stood in the bottom of the mine shaft, kept jumping and shooting his feet. The wendigos really didn’t bother me until I had to book it out
---
There has not been word on an upgrade.
---
lmao so darn true. Many people make up stuff and complain about it, I often wonder maybe they’re playing a different game.
---
Put their game tag here. I loved to nuke their camp
---
I took a couple month break before wastelanders came out and missed so much free stuff. So when FREE pops up next to the atomic shop I hop over there before even connecting to a server
---
Gauss Shotgun is life.
---
U stayed there and managed to kill him from under the mineshaft?
---
Xbox one games are forward compatible with the new console so I’m sure you will be able to play it. As for some kind of upgrade I highly doubt that will happen any time soon if at all.
---
You might want to sit down.
---
There's a huge nerf coming to the popular builds in a week or two.
---
The seasons event sucked and of course the one prize I really wanted was the second to last and those are my feelings towards the next season's board too: all I want is the greenhouse panels and its second to last.
---
well it was in talk before and recently again, so probably, but as it seems only for Pirvate World, as in 1st Membership &gt;-&gt;
---
lol who does that waste of time 😂😂😂
---
Literally server hopping to find one where nukes still work.  8 already hopped, all bugged.
---
This is frankly unacceptable.  This is the end game and it's broken :(
---
The problem is having to re-roll chest pieces until you get a 2nd good one and also they weigh a not insignificant amount =/
---
I just wish Commander Daguerre would stop complaining about her headaches after the quest line is finished.
---
I can't understand why people defend this mechanic. Every time it's brought up, you hear people say "jUsT sHuT OFf YoUr VeNDorS" or something else completely stupid. The thing is, nobody should have to leave an event or figure out some other "creative" way to shut their vendors off, it should just stop people from buying from you. period. Irl, when a vending machine is full of currency, the machine stops taking it. I shouldn't have to waste a chunk of my already bleak build budget to make a special room for my vendors that people can just glitch through anyway. I also shouldn't have to low-ball myself on pricing because I'm close to max caps. It's an issue and it needs to be fixed. Some of you sound like clowns trying to defend this nonsense.
---
Equipping the Adamantine Skeleton perk (even if not fully ranked) greatly reduces the rate at which the suit takes damage. Crippled limbs is a major source of armor wear and the stealth armor covers most of your limbs.
---
That, coupled with the Fix It Good perk when I do repair, makes having to repair my stealth armor pretty a pretty rare event.
---
the version of Ring Of Fire in this game is a slap in the face to Johnny Cash and whoever performed and recorded it should be drawn and quartered.  0 stars.
---
Like I said a lot of luck. I’m honestly just as confused as anyone else...
---
Maybe it was black people with the n word camps and you're a racist piece of crap for reporting them.  Also the swastika is a Buddhist symbol you narrow-minded racist tool.
---
Not when nukacrypt is down it's not, cause the in game codes are working and the game goes on.
---
“I’m not mad...I’m just disappointed.”
---
They have always recycled stuff back and forth, in both the game and atom shop. It will come back either as free or part of a bundle. Everything in this game is an asset and they won’t give any asset a lifespan of only three days.

I blew ~800 scrip the other day trying to get a legendary Tenderizer. I got one! It is Nocturnal :-|
---
While there has been no official announcement, I'm sure there will be. The question is weather it'll be free like CD Project Red is doing with Cyberpunk and Witcher or if they'll be like Rockstar most likely will be and charge full price. I love Bethesda and all but they clearly don't have the word free in their vocabulary.

Received .45 ammo in mine, among with most junk including Super Stimpacks.
---
Mine has collected 5.56, its definitely a thing it does. (When set to the BoS mode, the first 3 items I got were 2 cork scrap and 6 5.56 ammo)

Less music would also be acceptable if the only change is removing that cover of Ring of Fire.

Yup, and the vault boy cutouts work as well!
---
Speak for yourself!  ... wait,  what am I saying?  Lol
---
ahhh now i understand what you mean, i've met a few people who think i should take down my no mutants sign for being racist and being close to No Mutants Allowed which is apparently a right wing website which honestly confuses me since i was on that website for years and at worst it was anti Bethesda), still good to know i won't cop a report for just liking stuff in fallout games and trying to add it into 76, hell my next big homage is going to be [lost hills](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/2/25/Fo1_Losthills_Entrance_.png/revision/latest?cb=20150226174110) i got everything i need short of the bunker from the LR, got the fence from the communist fence and the sign from having in stuff all i need is the bunker and i will have a Lost Hills reborn
---
Why don't you spend your points until you hit 50? 
---
I started playing today and am curious
---
Noooo! Lol my worst nightmare
---
So you're telling me I missed the collection. Literally the best reward here and I missed it
---
Damn! That’s freaking awesome!
---
This guy's precious
---
No reason... they know they failed to understand our wants n needs
---
Yea i completely forgot about cyber and my preorder games...Im gonna need to go switch them to series x ...thanx for the reminder. Lol
---
I decided to list one for 15,000 caps a while ago because I figured only a true dumbass would buy it. Lo and behold: someone did.
---
same lmao
---
It was worth a shot. Already got one person banned when I found they had ammo factories on about 5 different workshops.  I'd say hope to see you in game, but I'd rather never see you for the good of the community!
---
Always check Thursdays for free atom shop items.
---
Fishing challenges were alright in RDO.
---
aint no Ardent's yet in Appalachia xD
---
Out of curiosity, what are you selling that pulls in 20k caps from spam buying?
---
The only satellite studio Bethesda has outside of the US is in the only country that also celebrates the labor movement on the first Monday of September. The other 2 satellite studios are in Texas and their headquarters is in spitting distance of the national capitol.
---
Well, the number one thing about the stealth suit, to me, is the stealth aspect. It is the reason for most of my success in game. The thought of regressing to only being invisible while not moving makes my teeth grind and my heart hurt. I get that you have to trade some things off for game balancing, I just don’t like it 😒
---
I know they have a lot of other pressing issues, but it would be nice if the Instruments worked more like SWG, and  the performer had multiple options on what to play. 
---
It would also be cool if they then added lootable songs to missions for us to grind out!
---
I smell commies!  What is yours is mine, what is mine is mine!
---
Haha! Thanks for being willing to avenge my death, but they won that fair and square. They played the game their way, and I’ll just keep playing it mine. 😁
---
After level 50, you are no longer given additional special points. The ‘points’ you get after 50 allow you to move 1 point over from one special to another special. An example would be 15 STRENGTH and 3 LUCK, you use one point after lvl 50 to move a strength point over to luck, making your total 14 STRENGTH and 4 LUCK
---
Whenever I play Sea of Thieves with friends and we play music together at random times, I always think "Damn, I wish Fallout 76 had something like this." Its soooo goooood in that game.
---
Market is flooded with them, so they are a 1c plan to me.
---
i just mean how much Chinese themed items there are compared to things like american army, BOS, Enclave ect, like there was just the Communist bundle and then there is stuff like the Chinese power armour and Collectron, plus China might limit what is in shop just to items that are pro Chinese
---
It might work out. Have 2 alts and one can be like the ammo guy, saves slots on the others.
---
If they made coins account wide, you could power level a new character for coins. That's why they don't do it.
---
High level bois need more love.
---
Doesn't this negatively effect Foundation rep though?
---
What do you play on? I'm on PS4 and it tends to be bad with me, even on a newer console.
---
Yeah it’s hard to not spend it being I had those amazing 3 rolls a month ago but I knew this was going to happen if we got the donations done. So I’m hoping it goes for a couple days so I can keep buying stuff. I don’t need legendary modules being I have all unyielding secret service armor. Prob could try for better prefixes on some but nope. I literally got both arms and chest after 3 rolls each to be 3 star unyielding but the legs prob took over 80 tries each so I’m kind of pushed off on buying them again. Lol I should try for bloodied guass mini and plasma caster and guass pistol being I have the bloodied guass shotgun on first try. But yeah having to roll the legs that many times makes me just spend it on guns.
---
I think having a higher Intelligence stat gives you a slight boost to XP and building public teams boost your intelligence by 1 or 2 points I think.
---
Ok, I’ll add that to the things I learned today. Hahaha! Any other little tips you could give a noob?
---
Half way through first episode. So far pretty entertaining.  Thx for sharing!
---
I do?  I don't even pay attention to what they make anymore lol
---
Stuff like this is why I’m taking another long break from the game. If i wanted to grind everyday I would just play gta 5
---
Grab a ~~radium rifle~~ gamma gun and shoot the floor with it. 50 rads a pop
---
I wasnt able to play for a few days because of poor internet signal. Thanks bethesda for making me miss it
---
Ive been using non-legendary Tesla, Homemade, and Lever-action rifles for the last 80 hours of gameplay on my main character. I cant find any legendaries for those, but I sure as shit can find 20 legendary pipe pistols and lead pipes! Better believe that!
---
Please let me be lucky!
---
Great idea thanks
---
Oops I meant to say gamma gun
---
Seriously. The fridge is a joke. And it can only  hold 15 things but they still take up space in the stash? Very dumb.
---
I imagined that in MODUS voice.
---
For 1,000 atoms
---
I just want to shout out to the awesome players that sell plans at lower prices for us new players. I just started playing this game and honestly part of the reason I'm even having fun is because sometimes I find a plan I want for a good price for my camp or even a weapon. Thank you so much guys!!
---
And so why do you not want to spend them now? Because you are worried you would change them later on?
---
Other People's Precious.  Yeah I'm down with OPP
---
same with enemy loot, im just level 30 something and playing with a friendt thats just below 20 and when we do public events often times high level players kill the endboss or legendary enemies within a second before we even notice they are there and we get no loot at all. fucking sucks.
---
Just kidding.   I don't use them
---
Haha that’s not a question you want to ask me, I could go on forever with useless and nuanced details about this game. But I would love to try to answer any specific questions you have, feel free to DM me questions and that goes for not just OP.
---
Would that imply he ate his friend after taking the ring?
---
I knew what you meant. Wish I had thought of it.
---
My daughter has recently gotten into 76 so we've been playing a good bit. Both low lvl. 26 and she's 12. We ran into a group of 250+. I was telling her we may die, just take it with dignity lol one walks up and gives her food and water. Another walks up and gives her an outfit and a few guns. The 3rd guy gave her a bunch of plans to build with. She was so excited lol I sent the "main" looking one a thanks msg and let him know the help he gave. He turned around and gave her 100 caps. 
---
 I know this game gets a lot of crap, but honestly it's got one of the best game communities ever!
---
Wait that's a thing?
---
Yea I did one time and man, didn't end smooth
---
One repeating the same shit over and over and using benches just as I need too is more than enough imo.
---
Still will require being like lvl 600 to max everything
---
Nukacrypt normally keeps pretty up to date records of the nuke codes. I lost a keycard to the pad because I tried the new number out before the old code, the old code worked when the new one didn't.
---
look up the code on the internet?
---
That’s actually pretty nice. You’ve given them everything you need to plant some corn!
---
Its not to avenge ur death. I just loved to see their face when their whole camp got destroyed. Its as entertaining for me as they had their fun on others. Raider style. Savage
---
What have you got in your filthy little pocketses?!
---
I dont wanna spend them now because I want my build all at once and I dont wanna have to move stuff around and be more than lvl 50 when I get my build
---
Freedom of speech does not exist with private corporations and it never has. If you’re going to wave that phrase around you need to learn what it means.
---
The amount of high level players that have seen me struggling on just normal quests/me walking places is astounding. I appreciate all you super high level players ❤️
---
Still think there should be a freezer vending machine that doesn’t expire so people can sell cooked food
---
There are a few new locations to explore, and several new NPCs.  Some old locations have been taken over by Mothmen cultist or blood eagles.   There are a few new events, and allys you can have at your camp.  They allies will send you on fetch missions - completing mission rewards a level appropriate legendary item.
---
Caps aside, If you can fast travel, you can get a decent amount of gold in a fairly short order.
---
Public Events award 2-4 Treasury notes per event.  (Each note is worth 10 gold, turn in limit is 200 gold per day).
---
Additionally, (Smiley at the Wayward) provides 300 gold per week for 6k caps.
---
Secret Service armor is approx 500 gold per piece, and you need legendary modules from Mrgph to craft it.  New PA, adn other armor, and a few new weapons.
---
Chinese stealth armor can be bought with caps if you have enough rep with Foundation.
---
BUT you have to so \*before\* you raid the vault.  If you wait until after, you have to buy with gold, and it cost 4000 gold.  Caps are easier.
---
Faction rep is much harder to gain - you only get a small amount per completed quest.
---
The graphics and stuff are perfectly fine when they actually work. With the better specs of the new consoles they should more smoothly at stuff like Queen fights and colossus, so there’s not much need for an upgrade
---
Great job on the story
---
Nice! That is 3 lvl 50 legendary chances. Nice.
---
It should be a 90% reduction in spoil time
---
Most people aren't expected to get to max everything. 
---
But considering that leveling up your character seems to be a major part of daily score challenges on this run as well, long term players are going to be getting there sooner than later.
---
We basically do have that - crafting then scrapping 200 radium rifles to get a single plan...
---
I want to ensure the cycle continues. Hopefully they have their own TP and a square to spare.
---
The nerf isn’t coming to popular builds, it’s going to every build
---
Steel
---
This is why every known plan that isn’t super common goes into my vending machine for 10 caps or the blue suitcase at the whitesprings train station.
---
Yeah. After a SBQ battle yesterday in which multiple Mirelurk Queens were defeated, I thought I’d save up the meat for my fellow Raiders. I naively thought the fridge would keep it for the days needed to turn them in. Whole CAMP smelled like dead fish.
---
Worst case scenario -- survival tent, if you have 1st, near The Whitespring since there is a full suite of crafting benches there minus the alcohol stuff.
---
Nah, that's not a good suggestion at all. That's the complete opposite of what would make this event fun, idgaf about escaping the mine. I want my junk.
---
not sure what you play on, but I don't have any noticeable FPS drop on Line In The Sand on XBox
---
&gt; claim a workshop
---
1-2 minutes (tyler county dirt track)
---
&gt;  1 event
---
Vault-Tec agriculture thing event done 1-2 minutes, maybe 3 if you include loadscreen
---
kill 15 robots/ghouls quests are potentially done with this too (my camp is next to huntersville so i can do a 15 mutant round instantly too, for scorched hop of to margantown airport)
---
to to a guy that sells ammo, buy 3 ammo, another challenge done you are at 3-4 challenge inn the firest 5-7 minutes of the day.
---
then you have 2 more to do in the best case (the 5 challenges will complete anyways) 
---
Give me more examples and i can ttell you how fast you can finish those :)
---
Also youre gonna level up over an 1hr play sessionn anyways which means you can relatively easily do those 
---
The only real problem i ever faced was "crits" i specifically created a pistol crit char (never used vats before) and im ABSURDLY enjoying it :'D
---
The great wall
---
Dude just quit, what kind of person plays a game they clearly hate then comes to the internet to tell people the game they keep playing sucks? It’s bizarre
---
Strength - Weights
---
Perception - Eye Test
---
Endurance - Bike
---
Intelligence - Overseer's Desk
---
Agility - Pommel Horse
---
Luck - Slots
---
I think there is a charisma one too but I can't remember what it is. Boosts last for a couple hours. You can build them in your settlements with the Wasteland Workshop DLC.
---
Edited: formatting
---
I’m seeing reports that the codes online aren’t working as well. Current theory is it might be bugged.
---
Ain’t that the truth lol
---
Doesn’t really explain
---
Yeah, I only carry one weapon, no explosives. The entirety of my considerably low carry weight (max 205) is for a single hm, a little food, and whatever junk I can pick up along the way. That may be changing if I can find a good fixer.
---
i wasted 3 nuke cards last night. so lame.
---
It's in China
---
Season 1 came and went.
---
A lot of bitching about the loss of Atom rewards for challenges, but I’m not among them. I had a very good time with it myself. I did complete the entire run.
---
Yeah but I get the feeling that this player is more casual. I am hard core player but my cooking skills are those of a filthy casual. So I only eat canned meat stew cuz it is super easy to get. Anyway, you are right, that those two foods provide much better xp buffs.
---
Bethesda needs to get this fixed asap.
---
I proc'd ACP the other day &amp; I was the highest level person (152) for the first 22 minutes until some others finally came &amp; helped. I just ran around helping all the lower levels, blew through all my diluted stimpaks picking them up lol. I don't regret it because it was actually fun.
---
It's just a chance, and it's the only place it's rewarded. I don't think I've ever seen it in a vendor thus far. 
---
Note: You MUST have completed this quest line too, called The Lowe-Down in order for The Fixxer to have a chance to drop. Otherwise don't try this event yet if that's your main goal.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The\_Lowe-Down](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lowe-Down)
---
The main event is Encryptid, down in the Ash Heap.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Encryptid](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Encryptid)
---
Check out the reward structure in the middle of the page.
---
The event can only be triggered for free once by someone who hasn't done it yet. 
---
It may be triggered subsequently by spending 1500caps (I think it is) at a vendor on a very specific component to re-create the other parts to make the event happen again. (Assaultron recall keycard)
---
In my buddy's case, someone just happened to trigger it within a few hours of him realizing he needed that plan and he luckily got it on the first try as a reward.
---
You only need to be in the event when it completes to get a chance of it. Also, I would recommend going in any time it triggers for more chances. You have better odds the more people are playing and the higher level or more powerful weapons they have. The Sheepsquach Imposter is a pain to bring down otherwise. Plan to die. A LOT.  Don't bother asking for revives, it's pure insanity, just die, respawn and try to stay around the edges and pick off all the robots. DO make sure to get a few shots in on the assaultron when it's un-cloaked so you can loot it after.
---
The other evnet rewards are really fun clothing or and some other rare plans, but the main one you are aiming for is The Fixxer plan.
---
Good luck!
---
It’s a 35. But I’ve made adjustments to the stock and magazine and now the condition bar is considerably bigger.
---
What's your IGN, I think you need a factory
---
Bethesda please fix your game. Thanks.
---
Like garbage. Furious walking canes and nocturnal Tesla's everywhere. Although I have been getting some great drops at White Springs in the last couple weeks.
---
Open your map and look around it, look for the other people who are on and move your cursor over them to check their level. Look at public teams to see what level players are on teams. Yes there is no easy way to check the server, but these are good ways to gauge if you would be able to succeed in these harder events.
---
I heard Adamantium Skeleton doesn't work. Also Enforcer, though I saw a comment a week or so ago saying it was working again, so not sure on that.
---
Can't confirm as I don't have either perks.
---
TBF i found the limited stashbox offensive. the main perk of 1st is the  unlimited scrapbox which i think should be standard. id buy 1st anyways because i again, supporting a game is important to me
---
Of course, my characters a herbivore, and ten percent is ten percent...
---
Probably another buggy bethesda thing, because I regularly die from using my JP to jump down from places. I read somewhere (although haven't tested properly) that the key is you can't just slow down as you land, you actually have to have enough AP to fly up just a hair, rather than simply slowing your fall.
---
Don’t forget a bunch if people bought the game at or around release and stopped playing because it was a mess
---
I'm sitting on a bunch of unopened card packs, so that's another menu I have to skip by to swap. I believe if you already have the max amount of a particular card, game trashes them if they pop up on a new opened pack. That's bad as those could be put to perk coins soon! So I've been keeping those packs unopened for quite ahwile now. Anyone please correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Exactly. Whitespring is a good spot. It has two nearly complete sets of workbenches (in the mall in the hotel, and in the Enclave bunker), there's a train station right there, too, and very often a few people have full CAMPs set up on the golf course. A survival tent near there and you're set.
---
I believe the xbox series x is basically just an xbox one with better tech. So any new games that come out on series x will work on the xbox one and vice versa. (at least for the first few years)
---
The last time i ran into a high level player was after I powered up poseidon, alone, in like  10 minutes? I made the grave mistake of claiming the plant yard afterwards. He galling lasered me to death, twice. He could have at least ASKED or threatened first and i would have left. I was level 52 and he was over 300, i wasnt gonna fight him for it. The times i have played in regular worlds its fun, specially with public teams now, but i play in my private server cuz i dont like all the mean people.
---
Im glad that there are lots of people that actually at least apply the core message of the game and help others to survive. 
---
Also sorry for making this an upset rant. But when i get the nerve to play in public servers and things like this happen i go back to private servers for weeks. So when i see good stories it makes me want to go back.to public
---
The secret is there is no wall
---
"limiting the weapon pool significantly"....your theory is wrong. the only way it would increase your odds of getting a handmade would be if there were weapon types that only spawned at level 50 which there are not. I would try getting rid of all your weapons that are not handmades, having only handmades on your character when buying from her. this may increase your odds, or if you fail miserably and are on xbox i have several handmades.
---
I don't understand why I'm being downvoted all I've done is state a fact, just because someone is in the silo doesn't make it their's there are way to many people who think they entitled to stuff just for showing up
---
I completely understand your anger &amp; it's justified, but I've learned enough about games like these that you just need to log on &amp; get the rewards when they're unlocked. Or just check up every day for like 10 minutes, you don't even have to play for real. 
---
But I agree in the end, I hadn't been on for 2 days &amp; only just managed to get the collectron on the 3rd day because I just happened to log in.
---
Broken.
---
If you visit the enclave bunker you can see if they are working or not.  Issue is some old servers work.  But this is only a matter of time before they reset and then no servers work at all.
---
Already seeing it now after hopping 12 times.   No working nukes
---
One made of societal and personal inadequacies, if Pink Floyd is to be believed.
---
Which is nonsense. People who get banned in 76 have their whole Bethesda account suspended. Bethesda should create a separate ToS per game. Maybe their own support given how much they make off of subscriptions.
---
I actually just did a white springs run this morning with a 10 mill explosive no buffs no cards and it held up really well had to do a little more  running than usual.  I'm also lvl 317 on pts so they were max lvl for me
---
ABSOLUTELY!!! Me &amp; my squad run Earl as follows... 
---
* We mutate Earl in the first minute or two. 
---
* Then we swap off tanking Earl's attacks, every 5-6 minutes. They pull him away from the other members.
---
* This is so we have large areas for mob battles. 
---
* Then in the last minute or two, we kill Earl.
---
It is am amazing opportunity to rake in XP. We then split the mats we collected off the bodies. We usually average 150-200 screws each &amp; countless other goodies. We run six to nine Earls a night &amp; have fun doing it. The trick is getting a selfless team &amp; working together.
---
Yeah I dealt with that a lot, which is why I try to help lower levels out in any event I'm apart of. It sucks not being able to get any loot. I feel like you should AT least be able to get a legendary off an enemy during an event, if nothing else.
---
Well goddamn. 
---
All of my good drops lately have been from the ACP event. (Even my magic minigun.) All Mama Mumbles gives me is troubleshooters 50 cals and nocturnal combat knives.
---
I would love that. I made a BOS inspired FOB for my camp and would love to have more initiates. On another not wish followers could wear power armor
---
Yeah the fridge was a total wasted purchase for functionality. I didn't realize it only holds 10 items... 10 !??!?! really?? 
---
Note: I really just bought it for the cosmetic appeal to my kitchen... was hoping to use the function as a secondary perk, but found it's totally a waste of time. It still looks cool though :)
---
It's a lot of things that aren't quest items as well.
---
Hey, do you inform on people IRL? Stalin relied on people of your ilk to remain in power.
---
Oh sure, it's SUCKITBEOTCH.
---
https://www.wearethemighty.com/amp/5-worlds-strongest-fortifications-ever-2554854244
---
I thought I was going crazy when I kept getting assaultron heads from her.
---
Oh wow. I just join other people's solos to help them out with my "get fucked" shotgun
---
ACP was good to me the other day, too. It gave me a Vampire's Explosive Handmade. I'm thinking about playing the lottery.
---
Nukes and silos are currently bugged. May want to wait a couple days.
---
A few weeks ago I got a Vampires Combat Shotgun. +50% limb damage, health regen when hitting an enemy, and +250 damage resist while reloading. Love it!
---
Also got a Two shot plasma gun and put the flamer barrel on it - that's pretty awesome too, but it chews through ammo like mad
---
This isn't even unreasonable, considering it has only 15 spaces. Pick a FEW things with buffs you like, and they're around for a week.... I dont see the harm...
---
Welcome to /r/fo76 where ppl love to complain
---
All walls can be destroyed, or players can glitch through them.
---
However it is possible to use the concrete foundations (floor) as a kind of wall. You can I think stack them but it requires a work around that I'm not sure on.
---
But, they can not be destroyed and they can't be glitched through.
---
pistols are finally getting armor penetration so all in all they're faring better than pretty much everything else.
---
the problem is that pistols are generally bad regardless.
---
There are plenty of Chinese players even now, so maybe a little fan service from the other side. And, lore-wise there was supposedly an entire third-column Chinese operation so it would make sense there would be Chinese equipment etc. to be found.
---
There are some Japanese-specific decorative items, too, though no real in-game lore-friendly reason for their existence.
---
Just ignore their shit. Period. Haha
---
Makes me wonder how I smell. I never get around to cooking all the meat, and I'm a click-scrap-hoarder, so I often find I have 100's of spoiled meat I'm carrying around. No wonder I have no friends.
---
Planning on a furious 10% aim fixer rifleman, had the same idea 5 in adrenaline and the legendary perks. The damage would be decent for full health stealth on hp buckets.
---
Instigating have to see with the multi the way it is. Haven't played the pts, just theory crafting. Doesn't look like follow through works on the first shot. Found Solar suit with asbestos chest and 3 fireproof, one of the pieces having poison resist, makes you almost immune to Earls domain. Only used one stimpack last time there without the magic mini.
---
900 for the drifter set? Those look like completely recycled assets from Fallout 4 railroad armor plus a construction hat. Atom shop is such bs.
---
String! Or Nothing!
---
I really miss having a follower to carry my burden
---
I would love a follower wearing power armour and a minigun. But I don’t think that’ll happen
---
I think I've encountered more decent folk than ass hats. But you're right, there are the occasional jerks who get greedy and just kill the legendaries. Thankfully, at least for me, they've been in the minority.
---
Edit: I will admit I have accidentally killed a legendary or two just doing too much damage in one shot. But I try to apologize and stay back on the next one.
---
Asshats aside, I went into a silo with other players in a team and, we were all set to do the same mission but, we got lost and separated within the silo so, we were all following the steps to get in separately. Every time one of us would complete a task, all of the enemies would respawn. We ran out of bullets and died on the 3rd trial because the 4th person got stuck outside the laser grid and the game glitched, so they couldn't get in but, it didn't stop the wave of enemies from going out to get them.
---
Same! I really enjoyed it!
---
Looking forward to S2!
---
.... and to the OP who's just returning.. clean out your inventory this week, re-adjust any builds, season2 starts next week, meaning a lot of easy grinding, lots more loot!
---
Incorrect. The Fixer is a separate weapon entry that shares all mods with the combat rifle, as well as having its own 'mod' to add its stealth benefits. To answer OPs question, the Fixer is getting an appearance slot in patch 22, and as it already shares all combat rifle mods, that extends to paints.
---
Yes you did.  Try turning it into a rifle and equipping rifle and pistol perks.  That thing does crazy damage
---
Lol.
---
But it really is this bad.
---
well the other day I saw someone at an event and me and my teammates started shooting them. this was because I had just left their camp and the prices they had in the vending machine were so offensive and ridiculous that they deserved to be shot. there was a message on the machine to text offers and everything was priced stupid high. seriously just put the price you want to sell at on them if you want to sell stuff.
---
I miss doing this. I'd make a lowbie toon of mine wanted and have my friends hiding nearby. Super effective. Fucking miss that shit.
---
It's enough to *drive* you crazy, that's for sure.
---
If I can remember correctly, I was seeing about 30 or so.
---
Thanks for the tag! I will raise this internally.
---
How do you get in on a sweet gig like that?
---
Cannibal perk is life.
---
All right I did what you said and now I have a fortified base thank you
---
Thanks so much!
---
You can have them pick up a weapon during a fight by dropping it right by them (with ammo) but it only lasts till you leave the server.
---
She finally gave me my first legendary compound bow. Ghoul Slayer's bash damage +1 PER.
---
Currently Nuke Silos are bugged. Codes can either be this week's or last week's codes; all last week's in my case.

---
Okay awesome. I don't play for a week because I finished my run and wanted a break... and I miss it... lovely.
---
"Or gang gestures" lmao what
---
Then they should share cards.. I just think it’s a missed opportunity. We have enough restrictions in the game. And more if someone isn’t a first member.
---
The Legendary Run has ran its course.
---
It would be funny if charisma was like a mirror that you just stare at yourself for 30 seconds and you get the boost ^_^
---
What platform are you on and what ammo do you use? I could give you a couple thousand rounds maybe. (Im PC)
---
Awwwwwww.. you're so cute.
---
Which is funny, because the game hinges on conspiracies.
---
the only way your method would work is if your character was a lower level than other weapon types spawn. for handmades the best level to use your theory would be level 15. lots of weapons don't go below level 20, so your odds would be decently improved.
---
Because season is over and we are only getting dailies and weeklies while season is on
---
There are different 'seasons', correct?
---
 MIRV miniguns? Shut up and take my caps!
---
Same here
---
Whats wrong with u Guys?
---
With all the knowlege about the fallout76 mechaniks and all the bugs u need to be some kind of special to have problems with the loot of Earl or SQ. My last char hit lvl 36 and from that point no one was ever able to steal my loot from any encounter. In my opinion Beth ist doing everything possible to allow us at any given time to run amazing dps. Everything u need is a combination of some compatible items and the pool ist huge. Actually its more difficult to dodge such valid combination to invoke a exploit than killing Earl with lvl 35.
---
Couple days? Does it take so long for them to fix a Important bug?
---
Do a Google search for "fo76 floating bases" there are a bunch of youtube videos that explain how.
---
Anytime I see someone wanted on the map I do a little prep and then hunt them down and kill them. *Usually* I don't take their loot but half the the time they don't bother coming back for it anyway.
---
About 1 out of 10 times they kill me and about half the time they are either already killed or have left the server.
---
Well, damn. I take back my thanks, then. 🤣
---
Being married to a middle Eastern person does not mean you can't be racist. It just means you're probably not racist towards middle Eastern people. Also, being religious is unrelated to whether you're a racist or not.
---
Why not cook it all and eek out that meager exp? Every little bit counts!
---
Lol oh yeah.
---
What are they nerfing?
---
They state that they follow ESRB rating, so why are there 10 year olds playing this game? I’ve heard a lot of little kids cussing up a storm on area mic, but let’s punish the adults who play the game, great logic.
---
Ah, I see. Certainly lines up with their way of thinking. Only give us the basics in building and (by their logic) every new building set they release in the atomic store is a noteworthy thing. Always thought that was a risky strategy. You’re not only expecting camp builders to wait patiently for more pieces, but to purchase them with atoms as well, when they *know* you have a load of pre-existing ones just sitting there.
---
Now that I think about it, and correct me if I am wrong- but I have never heard an NPC cuss. Also, they better not ban insult bot:(
---
Formula p I think does some kinda of gun accuracy buff
---
Got u bro
---
Yes indeed. The next one begins 9/15 so you won't start seeing more challenges until then unless you're on the PTS server, where it's being tested now.
---
Can't you just bash the enemies, or does that also one shot them too?
---
I usually use junkie melee so when I see a legendary I either change to a ranged gun and bash them or use molotovs/throwing knifes. Both are slow and annoying options but I rather do that than loose my ability too one shot them.
---
I am dying lmfo
---
👍
---
I haven't finished either and there are no dailies anymore!
---
Because there aren't any.
---
little lamplight fallout3
---
there is a shack bottom of the map in cranberry bog, halfway between the two pink tree spots. I think you just head south from the train station and its passed the farm with with mirelurks. not really any moonshine equipment, but does have a weapon workbench and an outhouse
---
Check Angry Turtle on YouTube, he tested it with his wife, also how it stacks with one for the team (spoiler - it's multiplicative with perks (which she additive in one wasteland), also multiplicative with one for the team plus some extra hidden bonus, maybe a bug). Watch his vids :)
---
demo expert is useless. those 5 points would be better spent on bandolier, traveling pharmacy or blocker. even as a sneak build, the queen is bound to hit you with her sweep for example. and it hurts, a lot.
---
ironclad, same. replace it with radicool for some free extra carry weight. I don't run gunsmith because rifles break every other week but your mileage may vary.
---
you should max agi for better sneak, although it's not as critical at 13. also personal, but I feel adrenaline is a one hit wonder. can't stress how useful dodgy is, even for a sneak build.
---
ricochet under luck works the same as serendipity. you may want tormentor to cripple things, maybe. and critical savvy + better criticals if you plan on going down that route.
---
I've never made that claim and I'm not sure why it's pertinent to what I'm saying there. I'm not part of a collective, I'm telling you how it is. You are being separated from your money, that's the point. The content is made to be sold, I'm not sure anyone could dispute that.  
---
Each year appears to lead into a massive content drop, delayed or not, that seems to be what they're intending to do. Wastelanders before, Fractured Steel next. Nevermind all the other minor content drops in between.   
---
Yes, the disparity in content amount between a feature complete DLC and a skin is pretty apparent to anyone with eyes. But the great thing about this is... You don't have to buy the skins. You won't miss anything. You're don't need the ATX content that gets pumped out every week. If you don't want to pay for it, don't. You just live with the fact that you don't get to use that skin. It's not the end of the world.
---
U can run back down as far as I know. I though about trying it in the situation you described and got about halfway down before the mine collapsed as I’d stood there swearing a lot lol. Fast travel I don’t think so
---
My dreams need to... settle down.
---
Judging by the number of posts where people have said there are problems with the codes, I am going to say there might be problems with the codes.
---
Give it to legendary sales man
---
Jeez the way y’all dissect shit is unreal. I’m not racist. Period. I have no problem with anyone.
---
I’m always afraid I’ll trigger my fireworks when I try to bash much.
---
You think a lot of people are visiting their grandma for like a week?? Weird!
---
I got that, and negative comments at the end of the final mission too. I read older posts about it which speculated that it was because I was in a public group at the time, were you solo or in a group? Hopefully being solo gives the NPCs the correct data, it absolutely ruined the end of the final mission for me to hear totally wrong responses. 😔
---
Thank you, i hoped you found a magic way to bring up a table or so. But it's a nice list, i support all points.
---
I’m blaming it on Dorsey, the BOS Collectron says “someone needs to do something about civilians launching nukes”, Dorsey sabotaged it, hoping to impress the BOS.
---
He's lookin pretty sexy there!
---
Unless you google magic shotgun and finally oneshot the wendigos...  
---
I was a bloodied built, now i'm a full life stacked shotgun and it's so much better!
---
Public Group. I guess that explains it, which is fucking stupid. So I got screwed because of that. Great.
---
I did exactly same as you, and was happy as well. Until I moved it, and everything was a mess. Pictures wasnt where they was, my bed coulndt be used because it got moved and I had aimed it with millimeter precicion for it to work. my bench was gone and stuff. I took pictures, it looks so bad.
---
The point is, yes of course it can be used and yes some people will like it. But that doesnt change the fact how bad it is compared to what it should be. They dont test things before releasing for some reason. Its always been like that. They do absolut minimal of what they have to do.
---
No negative effects? So I can just run around starving/ dehydrated all the time and it won't matter?
---
Kill me pls
---
I try my darnest to limit my cussin now that I have a three year old that repeats everything and will remember fun words, so I feel you.
---
That said, I let him watch me play, because he likes killin' robots, zombies, and monsters.
---
He thinks SBs are butterflies, too.
---
Only one of those three things is likely considered violent.  As for burning buildings, the extreme of the extremes on both sides do things like this and it is not typically indicative of the greater movement.  There is also a subset of people who look for ways to cause trouble.  They're the same ones who loot and start fires when their city wins a sports championship.
---
They can’t buff it. Well, I mean they *could* but it would get them a lot of well deserved flak. If they hadn’t been so greedy and made a dirty white fridge available to everyone, with, say, 500% spoil time, then offered reskins for it in the atomic store, then everyone would be happy. 
---
Instead, they wanted the atoms for that initial fridge purchase as well as all the different ones. So we’ve ended up with this halfway, half-assed effort that satisfies no-one.
---
fuck they need to change that imo
---
Ultralight, always.
---
It's getting downvoted because of your condescending attitude and the 'if I got it then it shouldn't be a problem for anyone else getting it' remark.
---
Buttressed is a must. And deep.pockets is great
---
Oh I have a magic shotgun but it's a DB so it's reload is very slow.
---
going to give it a try!!!!!  TY
---
if you're sneaking, things like scout might be better. for the shadowed options.
---
otherwise, depends on your build. but generally dense on the torso and deep pocketed for the limbs.
---
and buttressed, obviously.
---
I sell plans but at a certain prices, the other are dropped in my free stuff area if someone pass with ammo and 1 to two stars legendaries.
---
Buttressed and deep pockets
---
Unless you snipe with a scope, then it's stabilised.
---
If I spend the next 15 levels or so completely rebuilding all my specials and unlocking perks for a singular weapon yeah....
---
She treats me like I am a Captain Ishmael fan-boi. All harpoons and spears with a gamma gun thrown in for "variety". Her and the rest of her Jawa minions can suck it. I'm heading to Tosche Station for those power converters, dammit.
---
Ehh you win some you lose some.  This is the wasteland deal with it...
---
Def missed the mark with this. We can have ammo converters that magically turns ammo into another, ammo makers from the raiders, robots that collect stuff that isn’t there... yet the fridge totally sucks because they made it too “realistic”. I get food in a fridge only lasts so long, but after playing for an hr and a half all the fresh food I grinded is all spoiled? Everyone hates this I’m sure
---
I just saw someone selling an insult note for 285 caps, I was conflicted as to how I should react
---
Returning player,  so do i need to know the plans for her to drop certain weapons? Or does she have a pool it comes from?
---
The majority of the player base simply don't like PvP, so this might be a hard sell.
---
I personally doubt there will be an upgrade. They have enough problems on hand to keep them busy, I don't think they'd have the time or resources to do anything fancy graphically.
---
That's not what I, or the data said. Did you read it?
---
I'm saying that you're condemning an entire movement when only 5% were even violent. And the amount looting and rioting even less so.
---
Well, of course, and at least you don't disagree, comrade
---
Sometimes it's bad sometimes it isn't.
---
Wait... you saw a free thing in the Atomic Shop and all you needed to do was two clicks and you thought... Ain't nobody got time for dat, I'll get it later. hahahaahaa
---
What is this?
---
There is damage nerf across the board, people who one shot everything are annoyed it will now take 2 shots, while they complain the game isn’t challenging enough, constantly
---
But then how can they charge you for it months later?
---
I don't do it because I enjoy camp building as well and dont want that taking up phantom budget space even after its gone
---
no 2mm EC
---
but I'm also afraid of a ban, yes. otherwise I agree with you. farming mats is the bane of my existence.
---
It’s a consistency issue. You don’t do that as a game provider or any type of business related transaction at all. They put out an ask: donate materials and you will get said rewards. The past few items were on the shop for longer so users expect the next item to be just as long.  Its classified as a shady practice.
---
You still got a great roll you just didn’t get one you could use.  Anyone with a rifle/pistol build would pay good caps for that.
---
If you die and still spawn inside the mine then yes you can still run back down to the main cavern. Not sure about fast travelling once outside as haven't tried it.
---
The season is over, I think the next one begins next Tuesday.
---
Take a week off.
---
I saw an Angry Turtle video where he fast traveled from Earle’s corpse up to a team mate by the exit of the mine. He then looted the chest before exiting the mine. 
---
I was hoping you could do this in reverse.
---
Would Bethesda really ban people for doing the ammo factory glitch tho?
---
Psst, check who posted this ;)
---
2...allies....one to play the guitar constantly and the other to bang on about their headaches all the time 🤯
---
Agreed but this one was soooo close to fissure prime, and bang over the neighboring one
---
I do the same on private at white springs then farm queen drops for violet
---
non legendary tesla rifle with the charging lobber barrel. currently in inventories it will say charging barrel tesla and not say lobber, but if you inspect it should say lobber. not the best gun, but does make lots of pretty sparkles all over.
---
The faux-gating of atom store content is one of the scummier aspects of 76’s “liiiive service” (say it in Jim Sterling’s voice). The whole catalogue should be up there for us to buy whenever we want to buy it.
---
You can go to the Official Club for FO76 on xbox and create a looking for group post.
---
I have lvl 68’s at my camp all the time now, will they be 200’s after nerf.
---
&gt;eagle eye
---
Thank you for the tips!
---
Wait... Nukacrypt has a Reddit account? Did not know this.
---
(I don’t usually look at names on Reddit...)
---
They could add some timegating to perks. Like scraping 3 perk pards per day. Missed oportunity by bethesda.
---
Earle should have had a big swinging dick that fires acidic urine in your face.
---
Thanks 🙏
---
thats what alts are for. You have 5 characters: cant you let one be a famous ammo  manufacturer? You can always delete him later and poof go the factories.
---
Well boo, what fun is that?!  Mods should be for everyone to enjoy...at least the cosmetic ones
---
If you use Power Armor, an Ultracite Gatling Laser might be a good idea.  Since you are already sourcing Fusion Cores and probably have the QoL perks for them, you don't have to worry about ammo on top of that.
---
If not, Minigun.  With two perk cards, your ammunition is virtually weightless and 5mm is easy to manufacture and produce.
---
I ran out of time.
---
Oh, well those are good reasons. Carry on, you brave warriors.
---
I've actually been thinking about getting away from VATS since I think the sneak perks don't activate in it. When I manually aim, I get the 2.5 damage message from Covert Ops on every shot and never seem to get it in VATS, but maybe it just doesn't flash the message since VATS blocks other UI elements, too. If I do, I wonder if I should also ditch Concentrated Fire for Ground Pounder.
---
Ha! Finally people will have to do it how it was intended to be done.
---
I think i got the cursed weapon but nothing else. Oh well I’ll bring a hazmat suit instead of PA next time.  Takes too long to load in
---
ASBESTOS LINING
---
Sorry but you are wrong, it does affect the server stability when people are places dozens of these things. 
---
Granted it shouldn't, the server stability is already dreadful, I don't care if people want to use them its up to them but to claim it doesn't affect others is outright rubbish
---
I can't see however the advantage you would gain. Ammo is easily obtained threw trading weapons/armour/aid items  on market place.
---
I haven't  crafted regular ammo in over a year now, 
---
I wouldn't ever report someone for using the ammo glitch because the punishment of losing camp budget is enough for me.
---
I did the quest alone and in my private world without being in a group and it still messed up for me... Made a ticket to see if Bethesda could reset the quest but I’ve yet to get a response after they elevated the ticket.
---
Dude. Posting and encouraging exploits isn't allowed. What is wrong with people who cheat?
---
And get over yourself about a game where you murder and steal and blah blah blah.
---
I wonder what the mountain scout headgear even looks like?
---
Uhhh explain all these free player icons lining my pockets😎
---
Yeah, they do a little bit of self promotion and respond to comments/concerns/criticism on here with it
---
Certain sites are posting the wrong codes for some reason. You’ll just have to look for someone posting the right one
---
Any stable flux perhaps? That's the usual reward.
---
She keeps giving me gauss mini guns. Bloodied/33/-90. Were pretty tight for now. I’m planning on using the legendary perks to add heavy weapons to my rifleman/commando build.
---
Okay, so I started Episode 1. I agree, it's an interesting take, and I've never seen it done. 
---
The Good: You really play into it. Your voice isn't annoying, for the most part, and you are keeping it fairly lore friendly thus far. The reaction to the dead body and robots were extremely well done. The "character" is believable. I may add to this as I keep watching. Please note, these are big and good things, so this paragraph may seem small but the things in it are more major. 
---
The Bad: The initial portion talking over the opening sprawl isn't for me. The meta, like, "why won't this med kit open" is similarly not to me. I'd have rather you pretended it opened and you took some asprin. Or ignored it completely. The hung over thing is getting sort of old, but, I'm hoping that doesn't last too long. 
---
The wishful: I wish you had edited things so that the dialogue of the robots for example played while you were looking at them without the dialogue boxes viewable. In my mind, this would be done by recording the video of you looking at them for a length of time, and then recording the audio of them speaking separately and overlaying it. You're probably leagues better at video editing than my feeble knowledge, so take that with a grain of salt as I don't know. Also, it's a little choppy when you "turn" to look at something. I'm not sure if that's a framerate thing or your settings make it so jumpy (I'm totally aware you are limited to what is in the game, so, that's why this is in the wishful). 
---
I'll try to keep editing as I watch
---
if you do, you probably should, yes.
---
but the sneak multiplier *does* trigger with vats. it doesn't trigger if your target is in combat with anything else though, player or mob. so in an event like ACP for example, unless everyone in your group is sneaking, you won't be seeing that 2.5 multiplier.
---
with or without vats.
---
I was on the private server.  I was testing how it goes and of course it went FUBAR. lol
---
&gt;Every friend of mine who owned it, hated it on release and never came back.
---
These friends are not Fallout fans ;)
---
I ignored all the hate hype and loved it every day since day 1. The people that love this game far outweigh the people that hate it, never played it, blog about hating it because other bloggers are hating on it to be cool, etc. It's still an excellent game.
---
You also got a completely different experience than they did at launch too... so there's that. Still, it's been an awesome ride, regardless of all the hate, bugs, crashes, etc.
---
I like farming Uranium Fever, 3 guaranteed in there, everyone is usually friendly to let everyone get a shot in before killing them (make sure you show the same courtesy in that event). Just hit it with something low powered and walk away so others get a chance.
---
Radiation Rumble is excellent for farming, just tag everything you can, I've seen a half dozen legendaries in there before, the more the merrier. You often don't complete this event, but that's ok. Just tag EVERYTHING. Explosive weapons are good for this. It's so insane in this one that nobody will hold the legendary for anyone, just kill anytihng on sight or you're dead. A good safe spot is just as you get to the bottom of the tunnel, stand on top of the forklift and shoot anything that moves.
---
Riding Shotgun usually has some, but it's rare people hold the legendaries for anyone, everyone is trigger happy anytime I do this one and usually 1-shots the legendaries. If you get to it first, just hit it with low powered and step away for others.
---
Guided Meditation at the Palace of the winding path event usually has 2-3 legendaries, but its so spread out you don't often get to see/hit them all or any for that event. Just have to be vigilant and stick around the middle, and vats hit everything from afar.
---
I've recently started enjoying farming Monster Mash at Watoga High. It's a PVP area during th event, so dump your junk beforehand... but I've never seen anyone in when I was in, people avoid that one. I did find if you can 1-2shot ghouls, then it's a super farm in there. I usually get at least 3 legendaries, one in each wave. Marsupial mutation is good to have in here so you can just jump around between balconies and over mobs. It can get intense in there if you don't keep them under control. Your main sitting spot is on top of the lion's head in the center of the main lobby. Wait for the next candy bucket to spawn, then run over get it... run back to the lion, shoot anything that moves. Rinse and repeat for the next several mins until it's over. Good XP in there too if you get your XP boosts and join a Builder team for even more XP.
---
Other than those few.. i hit up all the easy stuff for event rewards... Swarm of Suiters only takes a couple mins, ManHunt takes less than 30 seconds, Fly Swatter takes less than 10 seconds. The BotStop events are only 2-3mins long each and stupid simple (especially if there's only one of you in it). The Enclave Event A Real Blast that happens in various locations are also doable in under a couple minutes each. Marsupial and birdbones mutations are good on these since you can jump over and around to each satellite dish to click on them. I hop between all of these any time they show.
---
If you want some low-end legendaries to farm/upgrade/sell to lowbies, I enjoy doing this from Leader of the Pack and Wolf Hoard (back to back). I usually get 3 super low level legendaries here. I upgrade/sell the good stuff cheap for new players, and then scrip the rest.
---
Keep in mind all low level junk = scrip = gamble for better more specific stuff from Purveyor, so none of it is absolutely useless.
---
Check around all the suitcases and other storage areas at all train stations, people (myself included) often dump a ton of legendary junk in there that we just can't carry or scrip... free scrip for you! I sometimes find upgrades in there too, and a ton of plans and ammo.
---
Hope those help. I should write this up on my blog one of these days LOL
---
Yeah on my Xbox they look ok when it's all renders properly.
---
But most of the uptime it's very flat and missing detail. So I think the new console will just work better  which will make it seem a lot better at least.
---
I'm on the older Xbox one like the launch model, so it's pretty bad.
---
NSFW?
---
I always have good luck at generals steak house.   I walk around fissure sites too I find scorch beasts are more than likely legendary
---
Wait what, I missed it? 
---
Seriously wtf
---
Still no announcements on it being fixed. Possible it never will be or wasn’t even complete so Bethesda just said it was a bug
---
Wait what the hell, the BOS collectron was on the atomic shop? I took a break from the tedious dailies to finally get some fresh air and I missed it?!
---
Just gonna say this, if you are going to exploit do it on your own private server. Make sure to farm a lot of aluminum though and use wade airport you can fit over 100 ammo factories on it.   
---
Me I am more paranoid they will ban those with the blueprints but I have friends that like my private server and I take use of their ammo factory stacking. They play for an hour or two we drop some nukes they collect ammo I stay on for a but more make 556 to sell in the ammo converter and profit as I enjoy my 22k in 2mm EC and my 150k in 5mm all from 2 hours of play.   
---
Myself though nope I like my account clean so I do no fuckery aside from camp budget glitches but sometimes those are honest mistakes.
---
I have a solid group of guys &amp; girls I play with. We all help one another &amp; want to see eachother do well.
---
It's just random I think
---
That is the weirdest part
---
if your on xbox ill come have a looksie, i love plans
---
Loot bags are up for grabs. If someone dies with 1000 Lbs of junk, that's their problem and not yours.
---
I could do that, make it look like nick cage in lords of war
---
Dude just pay like 100 euro and skip all parts! :3
---
lol... really?
---
Faster load times at least is my guess.
---
Because Bethesda doesn’t care enough about us to give us back atom challenges for the week we’re off season.
---
Communist detected on American Soil.  :-)
---
It's still nice, it can shot 3 bullets with its higher rate of fire in vats.
---
If you check the vending mahcines you might find some, i do.
---
Wow.  So I know I'm a month late to this thread, but this blew my mind.  I never noticed it before.
---
I didn't know that about encouraging exploits. I expect they will pull my post then. 
---
I don't really think "cheating" matters unless it somehow affects others. I have never seen a server where I found ammo factories crash or slow down. 
---
So you don't use a single glitch? Not even in the silos? Sounds like a boring confession for you poor priest.
---
No worries, thank you for passing it along :)
---
Dam, I missed it too, I thought we didn't get the event done, that sucks, I feel you bro
---
very interesting
---
Nuke codes are messed up right now
---
:-D Feel free, if you have a link at hand. I really should go through my posting history and bookmark one of my more comprehensive write-ups about this. With how strange the damage calculations are in this game, the question does come up pretty often and the answer is somewhat unintuitive.
---
The chicken feed amount of ammo you get from that thing isn't worth more than my camp budget. Also if you're spending more than 15 minutes a week on gathering ammo materials there's something wrong with your build. I can't even use 5mm at a rate that exceeds the amount the game drops me.
---
Cheers
---
I went from rifleman to commando, back to rifleman. I liked the extra power, but missed some of other aspects and quality of daily life improvements. That may change when the nerf comes. I'm still messing around and tweaking things myself. There's so many combos depending what your goals and needs are.
---
Fomo is the key to Bethesda’s marketing
---
Any info on if I can get my character rolled back or something by Beth?
---
Unless I'm mistaken, Bethesda said "we are removing the atom challenges," not "we are removing the atom challenges for the time being."
---
sweet pipe revolver....make a pipe revolver build and you will be amazed. mine does 3-400 dam per shot on the queen and earl, vat crits around 600. most other enemies in the game will not only be one shot but also explode into a gory mess. I think I can hit 4k damage at times with it.
---
The same thing happened to me. Ra-Ra was shitty at me by the end despite doing everything the exact same way I'd done the first time I did the quest. Gail gave me the third degree about it, too, even though she conceded she thought I was alright despite what Ra-Ra thought. But when I got to the vault mission everyone had done a 180 and liked me again. So weird.
---
Buttressed, deep pocketed and ultra light in case you just want to store some
---
No I don't use glitches or cheats or exploits. It's a game. The fact that you can't play without cheating says something about you, not me. 
---
Ammo? There is so much ammo in this game it's rediculous. Sorry the only people that have ammo quantity issues are people that think the solution for everything is to get one weapon and spray their ammo all over. Or because they have a magic weapon.
---
The simple fact is. You don't know how to play the game. So you have to cheat and exploit. I bet you cheat at Animal Crossing too.
---
Definitely one of the best MMOs out right now for console. I was just following the hype bc everyone was saying I’d hate it. They also don’t know me that well XD. 
---
As for farming goes, thank you so much. This is super helpful. Usually I’m on a private by myself or with friends. Also, is a builder more effective than an event group when farming XP?
---
Cream and a deathclaw hand makes the place feel lived in.
---
Hmm...Even if that's true, F076 seems  to run better doing this solution.
---
New personal challenge: solo kill a deathclaw at level 2.

From what I understand it doesn’t actually screw up anything in the world, it’s “just” some lines of dialogue. So just gotta grit and bear it... your actual choice about which side you help is saved correctly at least. Paige has the correct lines about my choice
---
Thanks dude, I'll look!
---
What are your results?
---
I have yet to find a legendary scorchbeast, but I have killed a few. Again, a very long process and lots of stims and Rad-X/Away.
---
It's not really in the game anymore, but I have a legacy Hunter's explosive plasma gatling with a splitter mod attached.  That thing spews fiery death and melts through Scorchbeasts and Sheepsquatch like nobody's business.  The downside is that even with fireproof and dense chest mod if you get too close to your own explosions it's instant death, but once you get to know your weapon that is minimized.
---
They should have brought them back while we’re off season, it wouldn’t kill them or bankrupt them. 
---
No they’d rather try to bleed us dry and try to price gouge us.
---
Good tip 👍
---
YES!  I don't place any instruments due to this.  I don't use that ally because I want to break that guitar over her head.
---
I was joking, because griefers tend to think they’re in some kind of sad gang.
---
I always buy Vodka at player camps if it's less then 10.
---
Here is an easy solution.  Make it a scout / Bullion reward then sell the skins in the atom store.
---
They messed up adding the collectron and fridges.  Just offer us a basic version then sell the pretty skins.  Non cosmetics have no business being sold in the atom shop.
---
Yah next time I’ll just take a hazmat suit.  I just never carry one around usually and when earle is nuked I’m usually not in a spot to grab it.  I carry PA but it obviously takes too long to get into lol.
---
Ballistic Bock, High Voltage Hefe are popular. I buy bulk every now and again. Can never find a steady supply though, on xbox that is.
---
Ballistic Bock and High Voltage Hefe
---
I think I had something similar happen.  She was rarely at her console.  She was constantly running laps around the boundary of my camp.
---
What is FeverClaw?
---
i literally made a whole new character and built around a bloody pipe revolver. it can 2 shot scorchbeasts. nobody is messing with you, that gun will hit hard! and when your pipe gun build is finished you'll be able to pick up any single fire rifle or pistol in the game and be able to use it effectively.
---
I've said it before but they should make them require power and then at minimum make them as strong as Good with Salt 3, and also keep the CAMP budget as is.
---
They had said along time ago that they were going to share in some way with all the characters on accounts. I think they may have also said something at the very start of testing the legendary cards about you would have all the cards unlocked for all your characters, but you would need to upgrade them for each character.
---
They seem to have gone back on this idea and made making more characters for fun even less viable as you have said :(
---
Not really sure what the condescending antagonistic tone is for, but fair enough.  I did participate in the previous events where a banner and beret were given away, but even then that's not the point, because EVERYONE had access to them regardless of participation.  I had to travel for work for an extended period of time, without access to my Xbox, hoping to login when I got back and claim the event rewards.  Alas.
---
Yah i think that’s what I didn’t get maybe?  Which is ok I have plenty.  Just didn’t know if plans aren’t granted as well.  Seems like i only got one cursed weapon from the ordeal, but oh well there’s always next time
---
I got mole miner gauntlet plans :-) I know, contain your jealousy folks. Some of us were just born lucky
---
How else are you meant to know?!
---
Nothing in this game is explained properly anyway, you either have to guess or test it yourself if you can. Honestly your best bet is just *assuming* based off past experiences
---
Thanks man appreciate it :)
---
Hmm, from now on maybe I'll ask players under level 50 why they are wanted and find out if they want me to kill them. In that scenario, and most of the time, I let them have their loot back.
---
I can't imagine playing it if we lost gear.   It (the gear) is just too hard to come by.
---
Rad-Ant Lager sells pretty well! Ballistic Bock.
---
Ballistic bock, rad ant lager sell fairly well
---
Some people buy nukashine.
---
VINTAGE NUKASHINE
---
Yeah, it's either one cursed weapon or one plan. They're pretty stingy on the rewards.
---
I wish it was possible so they don't use their ally item or anything else really! No workbenches, beds - since those can't be used in PA.
---
Yeah, but not 2 seconds after completing Scorched Earth, eh?
---
OK, so the ewok village type place with the leather. I think I have it now, thanks.
---
Look it up on youtube, you have to blueprint it than save it. Actually surprisingly easy. Go to the workshop, clear it. Than blueprint the wire connecting to the terminal from the factory and you just have to try it a bunch of times, once again. Use youtube
---
I’ve had a couple of really good experiences. Very nice after playing rockstar games
---
*Snatch them up for bullion at first but then for atoms because bullion got exploited and oh, you can no longer earn said atoms en masse in the game during normal gameplay so just buy a couple hundred with your cash monies cause these lunchboxes are worth it!
---
Trying not to be salty about it but I'm really not digging the inevitable switch over to atomic shop that you know will happen on these.
---
Yeah, my husband vastly prefers Cash also.
---
some weapons like fixers, bows and bear arms, you need to know the plan to get the weapon in drops.
---
I remember this as well. Which makes it sting even more lol
---
Thanks bro
---
It's not a plan, it's an exploit.
---
Why are people downvoting the people who didn't get a chance to grab the protectron?
---
I know this is a month late to this discussion, but I'm just now getting to a point where I can solo the bunker, and nuke zones.  With all that gear, what do you use to combat all the radiation with unyielding gear?
---
I had this happen at a workshop while I was there and he just randomly stopped and walked away after a minute or 2.  Was so bizarre and actually happened again at the same workshop (Sunshine Meadows food manufacturing or whatever it’s called).
---
Oh, you're one of those kinds. 
---
Fair enough, best of luck to ya.
---
Fair enough
---
Disease
---
My main char is 117 so will have 3 slots.    
---
I have 2 alts who are less than 50 so they can't use them until 50 right?    
---
Since it's account-based then are they locked until teach char hits 50, 75, 100 etc. or do they get as many as the highest character?
---
A disease in fallout 76
---
just outstanding
---
Their TOS is pretty vague for that reason.
---
Absolutely
---
completly fogot about my comment on this post and funny enough im stil have no access to that elevator. ive completed all the main quest long ago so now i have no idea how to fix this. but i can still glitch thru with power armor trick so no biggie i gues xD
---
Right? It really makes no sense that we can't. It would save so much time getting in and out of armor for dumb shit in other areas too
---
These days, it seems as if folks only join these events to farm legendaries. I was wondering why other players always turned off the jukebox at one violent night and gave us the thumbs down when we turned it back on. Honestly, I am not even that much interested in the legendary enemies, I just want the event completion as I'm still grinding for the shielded raider under armor plan. But most of the time that I play one violent night with a random group it fails.
---
I usually check the game's website and this subreddit.
---
High Agility &gt; CSS
---
Even before I went bloodied with my Vats sniper, I had mid 20s agility which allowed me to crouch walk circles around almost any mob in full daylight without being spotted and without needing the CSS,  a stealthboy or chameleon.
---
With daily ops adding enemies that negate stealth abilities, I think your slowly going to find less and less viable usage from the CSS in more end game type events, and will have to get more DR/ER to survive as you wont be able to hide as easily.
---
As many slots as have been unlocked in total among all characters but only the coins earned on each individual.
---
I would venture to guess they will re-release it and call it “remastered” or some shit at full price. Bethesda did that with Skyrim.
---
They're not so bad when you take out their legs
---
No🥴🤪
---
That’s exactly why I said it’s not the healthiest lifestyle...
---
"The scorchbeasts should have just flown you to Belching Betty. Why did you walk? "
---
From what I hear it’s the same flag but yep agreed
---
I tried both new and old codes on Xbox both didn’t work for silo Alpha. Also I still appreciate what you guys do!
---
It’s an exploit, you don’t want to place one of those things at your camp because it’ll take up space and there’s no way to get rid of it.
---
It will start on September 15 for ALL platforms. Everyone will have to download and install an update, and then once that's done and the servers are back up, Season 2 will be live.
---
Just flee in the other direction and pretend you didn't see it. Lol
---
I don’t know about op, but in my case, that usually amounts to serums.  He bought all my scrip armor, then all my serums which pushed me from 9k to 29k.
---
I jumped servers to private before he got to my weapon vendor.
---
15th on all platforms
---
Which one are right sites?🧐
---
The Perk Card system is the most frustrating aspect of the game for me after 270+ levels. Many (I'd argue most) of these are skills rather than perks. For example, once you learn how to pick a lock, how would one forget this (aside from not practicing the "skill)? How is Cannibal a perk? That is a lifestyle choice same as Herbivore. Ammosmith and Super Duper are skills as both indicate a level of expertise in crafting. The current system indicates that you are unable to function as "America's best and brightest" without a card to give you that knowledge/ability. 
---
To me, Perks modify "hard" numbers in the game. Anything that can be learned from a book or through practice is a skill and passive as it is always "equipped" in your brain (again, as long as you are using it). So, Mysterious Stranger is a perk as is Rifleman. Aquaboy/girl is a perk; Happy Camper is a skill as that is more of a mental state of bliss when at "home". Scrapper is a skill by knowing how to break down items more efficiently; Class Freak is a perk as it reduces impacts of mutations. Marksman is a skill as is Gunsmith, but Power User is a perk.
---
The loadout concept is marginally better, but you still need to map those loadouts AND the implementation of scenario-based swapping has to be flawless (and we know how that story ends). On top of that, there needs to be a loadout for every possible scenario - heavy weaps with AND without PA, unarmed team medic, crafting, workshop build &amp; defense, etc. That's not what we will see in reality. So, it's not a real improvement other than adding convenience to a convoluted and broken system.
---
No need to get salty. I like 76 itself. I just hate the limited time events like the board game and meat week.
---
Okay, you want something new I like? Colossal Problem is a lot of fun. Everything else since wastelanders was a tedious grind.
---
Boohoo.
---
Thanks for all the suggestions.  I'll try a few of those on my vendors and see how they go.  Now if we could just sell kegs full.
---
Release date is 15 September 2020 currently, haven't seen anything about release dates being different depending on platform so should be then :)
---
Not sure why the downvotes.  He has a valid point.  Bethesda could control this if they took the time and/or made a dedicated PvP server which is what the community wants.  I get that the griefers are the issue here but the game allows for it whether or not it’s against TOS.  If they hacked the game that’s another story but if so then just another thing Bethesda needs to clean up.  I love the game but there are a lot of things that they should’ve been able to fix in 2 years so the programming is typical Bethesda.
---
Until they explicitly say whether it will be or not I wouldn’t count on it given it’s not a season reward. 
---
EG: They didn’t bring back any of the other community event rewards
---
Same, No turrets. I actively look for nice scenic spots where only friendly stuff or nothing at all spawns. Then the next few play sessions, I continually warp there to see if anything spawns. 
---
Turrets take up a HUGE amount of camp budget too, if you can eliminate those you have a lot more budget to build with.
---
The only time this backfired on me was my last camp, found this perfect spot on top of this hill. Nothing but friendly mobs spawned. I spent 2 days building my new home... When all was done, I found out there was a settler that spawns there. He happened to spawn under my raised porch, so there was space for him, but no way I could move him, kill him, or no way for him to despawn. SO for a good few months, he sat there and raked, complained about the weather and kept telling me how good sonny's hoagies were. LOL
---
On a mobile so couldn’t direct link your previous post.
---
I get that, but as well know the devs frequent this reddit quite often so don't we want to show them a better side of the community that's built 76 up to what it is?
---
I definitely can relate with the frustration as I have missed out on quite a few items. However, I also understand how much money it costs to employ a team of devs, managing servers, providing updates. I don't mind throwing some cash at the atomic store every now and then if I know that it will help keep some devs employed :)
---
Again, why are you doing something you find tedious then coming to the internet to complain about it? Wasteland 3 just came out, it’s great.
---
I personally really enjoy 76, but if I didn’t I wouldn’t keep playing then come to the internet to disparage others from playing, I’d just quit, like a rational human being.
---
I think it's a real disincentive for having more than one character.
---
This is a great point. My camp in the forest is in between two spawn points. Both are level 5 spawns, but from what I understand they’ll now be level 50?  They would wreck a camp pretty quickly. It may be time to pack up and head to a quieter area.
---
That makes sense. Especially is serums are priced to move.  I can see someone picking them up for a reasonable price and then turning around to sell them at a markup
---
Once placed you cannot love it and it takes up a lot of budget.
---
I run 1 strength with that point in Bandolier. Get the chemist mod for your backpack and you don't need Traveling Pharmacy.
---
There is all crafting benches outside of blackwater mine also, and they didn't require a loading screen, like ws does. Just need to negotiate with moleminers first 😹i always run there during my daily scrip/cap things at ws station
---
why would anyone do it tho? if im not mistaken you can NOT build at your teammates camp in any public teams, no?
---
Typical Bethesda style, building team that you cannot actually build.
---
:/
---
Everything. I agree with the person above who said it's a good thing as people won't one shot sbq anymore.
---
Yeah I was just asking cause I have a AAE RDW minigun and a AA FFR LVC gatling laser which do u think is better personally
---
Cushioned for legs if you are getting jetpack, buttressed all around, and deep pockets for arms.
---
This is the build I’m going for. I can’t help but scrap everything I see when playing.
---
Witch hunting is against the sub rules
---
Yes! I've been saying this forever!
---
I also bought the game day 1 and have about 100 hours invested in the game because I wanted to love it like I love all the other Fallout games. So I didn’t just pick this up for free and play it for 10 minutes before giving up on it.
---
**Real Talk**: It actually is keeping people away
---
I have a terribly hard time convincing friends (who’ve played and haven’t) to return which is sad bc they’d actually enjoy themselves. 
---
That is if they weren’t turned off immediately by the immediate bitterant that is the atom shop and Bethesda’s intense predilection for FOMO and artificial scarcity strategies.
---
They’d rather not start at all then try and miss out. 
---
It’s a twisted wisdom but I do get it.
---
This makes sense.
---
Codes are bugged this week.
---
🤷🏼‍♂️ NukaCrypt had the wrong ones yesterday so I just googled it and found correct ones
---
YES.    
---
I wish we could get it sooner than max Raider level.    
---
I have an alt who's a shotgun/melee I"d like to get it for the CAMP.    
---
If you have a strictly melee char probably not. However, it can be a side source of income as you can make whatever it can and then sell it through your vendor.
---
Furious Fat Man and Ghoul Slayer's Cryolator were the last ones I pulled and crushed before I heard about the upcoming sale and stopped for now.
---
Building teams were just meant like "hey lets give each other +4 INT and some perk card share, nothing else :D
---
I agree. Why focus on multiples when it takes a lot to build one. Like I mentioned before gold, reputation and those badges.. now legendary perks.
---
It’s rubbish anyway?
---
Hehe eh it’s ok they go on all the time and this is the first time it happened to me so was just curious.  I was late finding earles exploded corpse.  Late getting out of the tunnel.  Usually i suit up in PA before leaving.  So I was trying to suit up at the outside entrance and wasn’t enough time for the animation LOL.  Think the bomb placement was so that I wasn’t able to sprint out easily either.  Now I know to bring a hazmat suit!!!!
---
You are the Frank Lloyd Wright of the wasteland.  Absolutely beautiful.
---
I highly recommend seeing the trans allegheney lunatic asylum (Fort defiance). Those tours are legit.
---
Edit: Also while in Morgantown checkout Woodburn Hall at WVU (Vault Tech University)
---
It’s also a miasma that strangles this games potential
---
I got that from a girl once, don’t tell anyone.
---
It’s accurate. There’s nothing in this post that pertains to *actual* datamined content, other than your referencing of it (which you barely even do that). To have “spoiler” flaired for this post is nothing more than clickbait, as there’s nothing in here that actually spoils anything.
---
This entire post is lazy.
---
Buff all refrigerators, past present and future... 
---
How does this get them flak? 
---
They can continue to sell new versions, just make them all worthwhile....
---
Private servers have an increased cost to run, it makes sense they would cost money
---
I've haven't recieved from the event. I did find it from a player vendor for 2000 caps. Since then I have received 3 Legendary ones  and swapped out the one from that quest.    
---
Once you learn the plan, then you have a chance at getting it as a quest reward or from the Perveyor.
---
A lot of F76 players seem to think everyone can play the game at any given time and day just because they can. Not everyone plays this game day in day out, and a 3 day time frame to get a reward people put up a lot of materials for is pathetic.
---
Only if it was a free item honestly. I want to be able to set up a saloon somewhere and just sell food and drinks, but not really an option when the food rots...
---
Rubbish to you, but maybe not to others?
---
It’s the “I got mine” attitude on full display - 0 compassion for anyone whose missed out because of real life.
---
Very cool , awesome idea for a family trip
---
What is good with salt 3?
---
Ok found a spot. When facing the stage at the entrance. On your left you can jump “jetpack or marsupial” and sit on a ledge. You have full field of firing room but limited viewing if earl runs to your left side.  But it keeps the ground a holes from getting you. I’ve done this 3 times successfully. Now I assume it will have someone there already when I get down to the fight 😂
---
You vs Bethesda, smartass, get back in the game!!!
---
https://youtu.be/qRdLWbOAUEY
---
I feel you.  I know others are in similar positions.  I’m glad you spoke up. 
---
I donated materials but missed out on the beret and banner.  I wasn’t able to log in and thought they’d be automatically added if you participated.
---
If the community unlocked these rewards, they should be available to everyone with an active account during the event period indefinitely.
---
Having the event be limited and the rewards also limited just reinforces the feeling that they’d rather have players shackled to the daily grind.  Which I get, but it feels unnecessary.
---
People should want to play because it’s fun.  Not being they feel like they’ll miss out on something they want by not being around for a week or even a few days in this case.
---
Who’s earl
---
I wouldn't consider myself "high level" as I am only level 200, but I do like to think that I take the heat off folk by distracting Earle and all the spawns like a psychopath cause I'm bloodied and honestly survive way longer than I should doing all that. Though there was a level 50 that seemed extra thankful as he bought some of my plans after the fight. 
---
It always breaks my heart to see people leave the event cause I can't think of what could have made them turn tail and run since I'm the one neck deep in fire/poison while Earle curb stomps my face until I look uglier than him. Not like I can find any solace by finishing the fight, I literally can't do it without at least 2 other people.
---
Nuke codes are bugged this week
---
\#RespectYourGrandma
---
For 3 charisma points in your specials, you can share any 1 star perk cards you have. This is awesome if you get to share perks that compliment each other, like 1 shares tenderizer and another shares suppressor, or   some armor condition perk and a weapon condition perk etc.
---
It's the only item that is worth it
---
IMO we were all confused and so new when it came out.    
---
Someone gifted me some things after I started. My main is 117 and I help when I can. If you're on PC my CAMP is N of the Wayward. It has a garden, PA station, and all the crafting stations.
---
Maybe my previous comment was too much for you to read; I said I like/enjoy the game. I even like a couple of the things they added this year.
---
It's a big game, I can still enjoy it and ignore the annoying crap they shovel on top
---
Could u write these codes here?
---
Builder = XP for everything because of the extra INT... Event = XP only for event completion.
---
Consider a few events on their own ... Line in the Sand (especially the tent glitch where it aall spawns in the middle).  With Event, you only get an XP boost at the end on completion, nothing else. With Builder, you shoot something explosive into the mass spawned mob, making it hit everything, then everyone else kills it all... you get an easy 1400+ XP per spawn... and it spawns about 25 times during the event.
---
Think about Radiation Rumble, or SBQ, or ACP... all those mobs you kill, dozens and dozens.. or even just hitting them once, if someone else kills it.. you still get a MASSIVE amount of XP from all those kills since they count as your kills too.
---
Crafting stuff, cooking stuff, killing anything that moves, all of it gets bonus XP with builder.
---
It's a much better way to go IMO.
---
I guess, but everyone and their mother runs bloodied/one shot builds. That's fair if you enjoy that playstyle but I absolutely do not
---
I’m getting married Saturday and spending our honeymoon in a cabin in WV to tour some of our favorite FO76 hang out spots. I’ve been researching for months but I still really appreciate your list - it has a few on it I didn’t know! Thanks!
---
I just never remember to do that since I only eat dog food or stuff I find on the ground LOL. The meat is always a byproduct of getting scrap, and I forget it's there. But yeah, very good point!!
---
I don't care how long it's been since they died. It is the apocalypse.    
---
I tend to leave them alone and don't see them often.
---
Just buy one :-/
---
wait fallout 76 is now doing what diablo 3 does and is a seasonal thing?
---
Except it won't launch the officers with the code pieces either. Also there are no codewords to decrypt even if you manage to find all the pieces needed.
---
Clickbait ha that's not clickbait ok  i missed used the spoiler tag i'm just trying to fallow the rules I'm not trying to bait people I said it in the description what I mean
---
I’m about 1/3 of the way there with around 2500hrs
---
Haha that's awesome. It sounds like you have a really cool family. Glad to see your dad has been indoctrinated too lmao
---
You could run PA jetpack, but it's not quite the same, indeed
---
Yes, but after he was forced to go to Rivendell with the ring.  I see that as more as volunteering for a mission.  In a way Frodo was drafted into the war of the ring since Bilbo left him the ring.  Sam willingly volunteered to join Frodo in the war of the ring.
---
vendor hop looking for player vendors with lots of junk, a lot of people have tons of excess screws they are selling for cheap from A Colossus problem.
---
I agree with you it needs to be addressed. I found these removable screen crosshair decals. Helps a lot to get on target faster I think, especially when the pips of the game crosshair go away, or are invisible. The decals are 'hip shot dots'
---
amen to that. I booted NW tasks for 1/3rd way and read everywhere that there barely enough SCORE to reach 100, and then started doing them, and then i realized 2/3rd way i really dont need them. even still I regret gridning so much. I reached 100 about 10 days before the end. Especially from 80 to 100 went super fast.
---
I did that as well towards the end because I just wanted it over with
---
Yes. But not by much. Trade off that depends on your goals...
---
Thanks for the tip ill check it out. Gotta farm the rest of the black trit too lol.
---
This is absolutely ridiculous 🤬
---
I have pics of most of them. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND The Greenbrier, Pt Pleasant &amp; Palace of Gold. They were AMAZING! 
---
The Greenbrier is nearly identical to in game. 
---
The Palace of Gold is much less so, but perfectly captures the essence of the location.
---
Damn, you must be a veteran in the wasteland!
---
Its possible and I guess I can see someone like a die hard fan dumping almost a whole year into the game but 300 days is a lot
---
Lol at the downvotes
---
It's actually pretty cool!
---
Sorry...😯😪
---
The users of this reddit have peanuts instead of brains. Don't take it personally when they down vote you, it's not their fault that they can't read! 😂😃
---
Oh no idea. I’ve tried fast traveling into the mine when I died and got spawned outside. That doesn’t work
---
clearly you weren't around for new year's 18-19.
---
I thought this morning. Legendary run still says it will end yesterday in-game.
---
I run a grenadier, and just came back after more than a year...was excited for new items!.... Those things are crap... I never pick them up now, drop immediately.
---
You on Xbox? I’ll donate screws to you if so.
---
And... With a Flechette Mod... *Magic* Day!
---
The game is exactly the same on all platforms
---
There's a cool Alien reference at AVR Medical Center: a Jangles plushie w/ a toy alien on his face
---
This is half the game! Helping others and hearing storeis about it
---
Double harpoon day lmaoq
---
You can only have deep pocketed OR ultra light though correct?  I was wondering too because I just purchased all the plans and need to keep grinding for the mods now.  Had 4800 bullion now down to 500 after buying it all LOL.... another few months... edit: if they didn’t have the daily cap on bullion I would probably be able to get the mods today
---
Negative was not. Refused to buy the game without a story line (as I played fo3, new vegas, and FO4. Bought it because wastelanders which was disappointing anyways
---
I get that.  
---
Other chars below 50 can they equip them or not? Having to grind another char to 50+ just so they can use them doesn't seem 'fun'.
---
I see what you did there...
---
What would Elder Maxon think?
---
The markers are messed up. You're not on the correct floor
---
To be honest, at the end of the Legendary Run, I decided to not really quit, but stop playing "Keeping up with the Kardashians: Fallout."
---
I'm no longer grinding dailies/script/notes. I'll turn in my stored points for the Purveyor Sale, log in for fun looking events, etc, but trying to log in every day to assuage my fomo was having a negative effect on my mental health. 
---
I'm limiting myself to sandbox games like Elite: Dangerous because you play those when you want to play, not because you feel like you HAVE to play.
---
Lol two nights ago on PS4 a 110 was trying to get me (37) to leave the same workshop, but kept just doing everything but attacking or trying to claim it.. he thought he caught me off guard I guess but he put some bloodied I'd assume cause he lowered health then tried to shoot me and idk how but I killed him pretty quick lolll
---
Take a look around the fire station at the whitespring.  It has a weapons and armor bench. Also the laundry building has benches too. No load screen required.
---
There is no cow level. Wait, that was another game. 😉
---
Good with salt is 90%.  Fridge is 50%.
---
Yes! Really adds up over time.
---
Lol!
---
Well I'm going to blow through all my scrips when the vendor sale starts and hope I get a Legendary Tenderizer!!!
---
😂😂😂 I was salty
---
to be honest, i dont really see anything in lunchboxes.  I never get anything really beneficial, or even cool, +%10 damage to animals, +%10 robots etc. Maybe just confetti explosion for kills.
---
You really overestimate how common hacking is these days.
---
I’m only about 120 hours in
---
reduces spoil rate by 90%
---
It'll extrapolate in the gaps. Yeah X is int. If you search in xedit for that file name you can find the records that use this table as well.
---
Alright cool.
---
Yeah but I’ve got magic weapons coming out of my cloaca. And sure with lock and load and the firework glitch it’s pretty cool. I think I am going to sell them for like 25 caps.
---
Damn it then.
---
You can place a camp where there already is 1-2 NPCs spawning, and add your follower, a pet, Brahmin, chickens and a Colletron. That's as close as you can get so far.
---
bottom line is that whatever you're feeling right now is the ongoing theme with Fo76.
---
since 2018 in fact.
---
To me it seems very limiting that you need to have 2 legendary perks that do so much more dmg for a specific group of players. Sneak damage is boring for me and many players don’t like playing on teams. Now stealth teams is just another meta for the game rather than making any build workable. 
---
What’s the point of having new perk cards if 1/3rd of them have to be sacrificed to have comparable dmg to what we we’re already doing now? Earle is hard enough already and I usually have to carry it as a melee build. My build will be worthless against Earl once this releases.
---
Get buttressed
---
Odd, i wonder if its working on private server.
---
Sure your mouse/controller isn’t on the edge of death? I’ve got to replace a mouse that loves to double/triple click from one press.
---
I've got 3300 hours and I know there are people higher than me.
---
buttressed
---
Bought a normal lvl 50 fixer for 1000 caps from a player vendor (not sure if i overpayed) but i want to have a legendary one
---
You completed the motherlode quest?
---
I have a furious handmade and it tears through everything but the queen and earl, it works great.
---
Thank you.
---
Yea I am. GT is the same as here if you want to add me.
---
Are you implying the game gives paying users advantage? The gal!
---
Can’t wait for them to put a camp flag that says “we’re sorry” in the atom shop for 500 atoms
---
For all parts ?? Any other things
---
Fridges needs to freeze.
---
Aight, my GT is Art Degree. 
---
I’ll join you after I’m done with my class.
---
Shoulda waited for the vendor sale, would have doubled your Nocturnal Tenderizers.
---
Yes
---
Thank you so much!
---
My other builds in case you haven't seen them. [https://imgur.com/a/wKlGKJm](https://imgur.com/a/wKlGKJm)
---
Thanks again man appreciate it
---
LOL a cheat item that actually could be pretty cool if it was in the game, imagine we can buy this from SS vendor and random craft it  like SS armor.
---
I use buttressed on all parts.
---
I was just talking about this on discord with some people. I even saw the tweet that it was going to be made available and thought about getting on so I wouldn’t miss it, but convinced myself not getting for a few days while I dealt with other things would be fine. I should’ve known after playing this game for so long to always trust the fomo lol but it is just aesthetic and hopefully they add it back in later. It does suck especially after grinding out the legendary run each day, but it is what it is I guess. :/
---
I managed to grab it and I still totally agree.
---
It's a "Community Reward". As in, it should be for the whole community. Not the part of the community who happened to be online during a specific timeframe.
---
Imagine donating 10.000 mats and then missing out on claiming the reward in time. That would be a real punch in the guts...
---
I really hope they bring all the community rewards back for good on the ATX. Timed exclusivity for stuff we collectively EARNED is fucken BS and everyone knows it.
---
I made a post about this and I got downvoted to hell, I don't understand, seems like a dick move to me but apparently I'm the bad guy🤷🏼
---
Are you sure that the nuke does not have a cooldown active?
---
I’ll try to find them. I’m not 100% sure which site I was on last night. It had a very generic white background layout
---
Maybe if we ever get the option to have pets or additional bots in our camps.
---
This! I keep shooting my friends in the back by accident, thank God for pacifist mode
---
Controller? nah, probably not. It's in great shape.
---
Oh wait. That could mean I get to buy a new controller. I like that idea. I can totally blame that controller. 
---
Lousy controller.
---
j2525 pipe revolver :(
---
100%. Checked silo tape and I haven’t launched since yesterday
---
Especially at night.
---
You get it from Mirelurks
---
I mean buy the plan :p I've seen 3 legendary fixers on vendors and one was at a camp where he priced everything at 10 caps. I bought a furious one for 5k too.
---
The plans are usually 10-12k but it's worth it.
---
I have one for 10k on pc if you want it.
---
When you learn the plans you can get legendary ones from the purveyor or events.
---
Yes you absolutely can run down the escape tunnel to get back to earls arena. 
---
I respawned in the waiting area and the entrance drop caved in. He died right after I did. I wanted to loot the body so I just ran down the tunnel, passing my team mates running out.
---
When I got down there I met about 20 wendi babies and had about 15 seconds left. No idea where earls remains are. So no loot that time.
---
Nope I'm at 1841/7600
---
Interesting. I didn’t realize that agility could improve stealth to that degree. My agi is already maxed as it is with max sneak, so maybe I’ll test it out with the ss armor I already have. If it goes well, I’ll get back to grinding out the right ss armor rolls. Thanks for the tip.
---
I bet your mother dressed you funny too.
---
If you make a list of what you need left I can see if can get it all.
---
Harterman did it in the first week
---
I always say yes to free ammo.
---
Wow. How do they keep managing to mess things up? It worked the past, what, 6 moths+?
---
Since fallout 3
---
THIS!!!
---
I just use default pricing most of the time or even lower it. Unless it's a god-roll weapon, it's just not worth what you all think it's worth. Yes, there's a website that calculates things at 1000's of caps... but there's also what the market is willing to pay.
---
All ammo is 1cap for me too. I vendor hop a lot for ammo. Those selling stuff for more than 1 cap is an automatic pass, Those selling for 1 cap, I buy them out. I also sell all ammo I don't use for 1cap too, they're hot items, I move a lot of ammo!
---
You should also manage your caps better. If you're closing in on maxing out, and you got a bunch of 1000+ cap items... You know there is always a chance someone will buy it.
---
That said, what do YOU need max caps for? Always leave a buffer. I try to stay around 15K-25K at all times.
---
People selling god-roll stuff for over that amount... Forget that. I've bought plenty of god-roll stuff for way less than that, and I'll just keep searching till I find it. Your crap is just going to sit there, unsold.
---
This is the same mentality people have with a garage sale. Your stuff is just not worth what you think it is.
---
Cheaper Mass Quantity tons of selling &gt; Single High Price Items that sit and only sell once in a while, then end up maxing you out.
---
Its way harder to plan for that 10K item to sell vs a bunch of 1000K items or bulk ammo/chems/etc/plans/etc. Smaller stuff is easier to plan around for the cap limit.
---
It helps people more too, more traffic to your camp.
---
I logged in an hour ago, and have been idling maybe 40 mins after doing  couple easy quests, just surfing Reddit. While sitting here, I've made 3K caps in ammo I usually just throw away. It's been a busy morning!
---
Buy stuff, sell stuff, it keeps your caps flushing through and you shouldn't run into that limit.
---
... and what others said.. just stop selling stuff. Disconnect power from your camp. Then the only people that see it is team mates, less likely for people to visit. Or build one of those fortresses around it so nobody can get to it, and only have it open when you want.
---
West Tek building. That's a good spot to find legendaries
---
last night I saw a pic that you couldnt get the codes the regular way either
---
Decent price! Or Scrip 'em?
---
It just depends, on PS4 I could sell ultracite jetpacks at 50 and every other at slightly increased to the next up to like 200 caps
---
Yep. Same here.
---
Don’t worry, luckily bots on parade still functions properly 😒
---
You can fast travel away at any time
---
It’s you not the game. Because your in PC and have messed with things.
---
It’s amazing.
---
Pretty frustrating. Odds are it ain't getting fixed anytime soon either.
---
Are you doing the Davenport one as well?
---
I tuck settler wanderers chair close to a table, all immersiony and stuff, and she can’t sit down to play the guitar so she just wanders around. Your welcome.
---
I even remember them telling that Legendary Perks would be account shared between all characters, but 16x the detail, maybe I just dreamt about it.
---
Wow sorry to hear that 😭they’re still messing with the codes then
---
Yeah, the fridge should STOP all decay or have it so slowed things last a few DAYS real time.  I'm so disappointed in mine, the only one I bother to have in a CAMP is the Nuka one because .. its' Nuka Cola.
---
I will try that too.  Can you fast travel from inside the mine, out of the nuke zone, and still get rewards?
---
butt to the tressed is the best.  for dr.
---
What platform are you on?
---
sounds like you wish you could just stop this nightmare. do you feel like you're just... floating around in space?
---
Damn, you're on XBox. I would love to contribute to a group like that on PS4. Most of my core friends hardly pop online anymore. I need to be adopted by another good group of people lol.
---
Ward's daily quest, Davenport's photo opportunity, and Raider Rocksy's daily quest, except you convince the Raider to join Foundation.
---
I saw an ally with Secret Service armor the other day.  If nothing else, might be a good trick to store your heavier pieces.
---
I try to save Mirelurk Queen meat for the Raider faction daily quest, I rarely make it more than a day before it's garbage.
---
I once had a player shout all sorts of threats and racial slurs at me. I’m not sure why. I was at my camp and he got mad.
---
None of it was acceptable. 
---
That’s why.
---
You're correct. Enjoy downvotes from absolute shitters who can't make it through a silo in under an hour. It should only take 5 minutes
---
“Damn dirty synths, grobble grobble”
---
Not even free, we actually had to work to earn it.
---
Because it’s a paid for item that now offers a good bonus. Sure, you have weapon and scrap kits, but they’re more of a ‘pay for convenience’ thing. Giving the fridge a big buff would mean you could remove ‘good with salt’ from your perks and at its top tier, which the fridge would exceed, that gives you back three perk points. 
---
It’s also moving the goalposts -  selling the fridge as one thing, then deciding to make it another way down the road, would torpedo Bethesda’s already shaky credibility. Like I said, make it available to everyone and they can tweak it however they like. Of course that’s a moot point as it’s not going to happen.
---
Are you on PC?
---
But is it an item or something?  I have played since beta and have never heard of it.
---
Xbox
---
Whenever i see a low level player, I wish them to ask me if I could craft the best armor and weapon they can wear/use. Id drop few hundreds of ammo, steel, wood, plastic, 100+ diluted stims and radx, radaway too. 
---
few days ago lvl 20ish guy offered like 5 stimpaks to other teammate that was lvl 11ish, I got my so sentimental i dropped both 100+ stims, radaways, ammo. Today they saw me and said how it improved their gameplay experience, its less of a struggle
---
I turned in the photos to the raider when I first got it, and now I think he won't give me anymore of them. Does he give anymore quests if you do that or are there any ways to get him to give me one?
---
last time i played i got a bffrfr lmg
---
I not sure people only do it for the legendary items, it’s more, “I’ll do the event for plans and drops but I’ll be buggered if the person on the roof gets to cherry pick legendary’s while I do all the work, waste the ammunition and take all the risk”. But that’s just my opinion.
---
Flechette mod cursed harpoon gun, with fireworks glitch  is the new meta.
---
Hi! 93 nub here. Who is Mumbles u/SuitsAndStripes u/_the_indifferent_?  
---
Much obliged :)
---
Definitely agree there! As a dev myself, I know the unique challenges this group faces and the vitriol they constantly face. I also understand the atomic shop situation has nothing to do with dev teams, it's absolutely on the operation management team and their bottom line is stockholder versus customer. Always is, always will be.
---
Having played since beta and plunked down on the tri-cent pre-order, I am no stranger to throwing cash at this game. I am a little embarrassed to think about how much I've thrown at the atomic shop but that's neither here nor there. My ultimate point is balancing the gameplay to both incorporate in game capabilities to earn atomic shop currency while still making it possible to blend consumerism into it because hell yes I will throw down cash for the next ridiculous item they have.
---
Dense can be added to the torso unless you're dead set on buzzing around like a gnat everywhere you go.
---
In trying to build a complete set of unyielding Secret Service armor I have crafted .... 60 pieces that aren’t unyielding and have scrip from now until the sun explodes. And I can’t sell those, or trade or anything
---
This whole area of food and recipes is such a let down. It could be much more fun if the food didn’t expire.   Find a way for us to can it or package it. Give us a freezer.  This area of the game could be an entire build.   Why suggest a world full of culinary exploration with recipes and unique foods just to have it all expire the next day.  I want to be a butcher dammit but no one is going to buy less than 100% quality cuts.

i want my allies ro be my orher characters

It may be weeks.
---
yeah screws are flowing from ACP.  I have 1200 and never use them because i have like 70 advanced repair kits from Queen.  But nukes are bugged now ss I may have to start using them again.
---
I miss the melee pvp haha . It used to be everywhere and now it’s just nothing
---
Mumbles is the affection nickname for the Purveyor located at The Rusty Pick. It's where you trade in legendary scrip for weapons, armor, or modules.
---
Yea people who like to explore huge beautiful maps love this game and people who were expecting a more character driven (new Vegas style) rpg hate the game.
---
As far as I know, the only events you can trigger are the big raid boss events: scorched earth, colossal problem, and encrypted. You might want to level up a bit more for those. The first two you just need to bomb the right spot: prime fissure site or mononga mine. The other is a bit more complicated.
---
Ps4. Guess I should have mentioned that.

Did you try blowing on it ?
---
better not share coins, someone might actually replay the game!
---
Good sir, have you ever traveled to someones camp in hopes of finding GOOD MARINE ARMOR and realized that it's all apparel priced at ridiculous prices?
---
It’s a perk card
---
3 days was pretty low on their part, but then again, if it were on indefinitely, everyone would've got in on it...
---
photo opprotunity is repeatable.  I do it everyday.  but im not maxed with either yet.  It may be bugged.
---
im on PC sadly
---
Ok
---
DM me your user name and I'll find you when I log on in a bit and give you some caps if you'd like.
---
All events that reward a legendary weapon will have the chance to roll one. It's also possible to get them from legendary enemies.
---
Armor Ace and the Paw Patrol

i added you , whenever you can get online im here

Thank you

Yeah
---
Unless we’re talking original Fallout High Elder John Maxson in which case he’d be thinking "Hell if I know."
---
I wish to have at least 2 allies setup, but also for a tamed pet OR an ally to be able to join me out on quests...
---
What do you mean? It stays in your inventory, and you can just wait to spend it on the sale
---
I have a pistol build , uses bloody explosive .44 and BE 10mm auto, similar damage to BE handmade, before the nerf .. I mean balance 
---
After probably crap but so will everything else..
---
I see. In that case...
---
I agree with you. 
---
Again, it's ONLY 15 spots.
---
Buff fridges... Give one for free to everyone. Make it the first reward of the SCORE board or something...
---
Make the rest 'skins'
---
...and screw any whining from the folks who 'paid' for their fridge (myself included).... it wasn't working ANYHOW
---
Excuse you, but your camp needs to be built to serve me.... /s
---
Build as you want man, its your peice of wasteland.  People are self involved asshats and think the world revolves around them. I hope you sat up high and did the mothman dance and waved everytime the yelled at ya.

Mate, if u are on PS4 I’ll give u 30k &amp; one good plan which helps you earn 1400 daily wo special efforts. Lucky-markus2012

They're hoping people buy it to go with the reclaimed deep mining mask.

Get an air horn and give them the reply they deserve.

I owned the salute emote but it’s no longer in my inventory

Nobody on this subreddit knows what griefing is.
---
Hell, I've seen "friends join private world even though I swore I tagged party only" called griefing
---
I think a “ randoranderson is perusing your goods “ or something like it as a message would be nice , I hate when I’m in a vendor and the player server hops. I even check my own vendors before I do just to keep from doing it to people
---
Understandable, I've blown grenades on my face a bunch of times that way.
---
And there should be a fishing competition set up as an event!
---
I was planning to be at max scrip before redeeming it, make some purchases during the sale, and then redeem the board scrip, so I would have an "extra" 500 to spend during the sale. It's not like I lost it, I just could have bought 10 extra weapons with what I had left on the board if I redeemed it after the sale started. Make sense?
---
Oh. Even if you give the photo to the raiders?
---
They're continuously hampering their sales by these timed offers and expensive bundles that contain unwanted stuff.
---
The BOS collection is always saying stuff like this. Just being goofy, LOL!!! 
---
I really do feel bad for the players that got the short end of the stick on this. 
---
I logged in the day before it was gone and freaked. I called all my friends to let them know to get on the game ASAP, because it was going to be gone in a day. 
---
They should’ve made it at least a week...
---
Thank you.  Hahaha.  That makes the 3 make sense
---
Only Enclave is required
---
Yeah, ill just bring him to 50. It's a 4th character I've been using as a scrip whore. Too bad it's already lv 20 or I'd have wanted to spend it on lv 5 rolls to see what i can get that's cheeky.
---
I can't message but I always penguin their loot bag until they return.  So when they do they know I'm only there for the atom challenge.
---
Sorry for late reply was clearing some miners.  All I need now are screws about 30
---
Shitter, that's not so good!
---
Yeah man, it's a struggle at early levels. but once you hit that tipping point caps are worthless because you have all of them in the world
---
Also make it so i can put a fence all the way around my stair hole. I hate leaving the one side open on the upper floor.
---
JE25 Lasergun with Nuclear Winter scope
---
I did some research on this a while ago (though I don't have links handy right now) and read that, if you don't make noise, more legendary ghouls will spawn. Of course this might not apply for everyone, but it seemed like a good explanation for why people get upset when you play the event as intended.
---
I blast baby shark into my mic from my phone , learned it from a friend
---
You're welcome.
---
you can chose each.  So ideally now you would take pics of raiders and give to Ward and decline reward.  Always decline reqard for best rep gain
---
If it only has 15 spaces then it's unreasonable for anything stored in it to go bad at all.
---
Right now the cooking system is largely pointless, because not only to most ingredients go bad before you can use them, the effort of making something good is a waste too, because the finished product will go bad just as quickly.
---
Pretty much the only thing people use the cooking system for is to make extremely simple food from crops they can plant at their base. Carrot soup anyone?
---
Wait are you insinuating that a duped copy is weaker than the original?
---
What platform are you on? Because I'm hearing Xbox users can use codes from last week
---
I love seeing a camp with 20 to 40 weapons for sale, travel to it and they’re all priced at 3k to 15k and I’m like bruh you hurtin for caps?! And all the weapons are usually trash. Oh you want 7k for a trouble shooters 90RW FFR level 35 western revolver? Yeah shut up and take my money. Sorry your one star bloodied bone club isn’t worth 4k. .50 cal round for 10c each?? Let me open some holiday gifts to make sure I have enough caps to buy the 38,000 you have available. 
---
You have 20 weapons priced at 10k to 15k each? So you sell... what? One gun and you get mad and log off because that inconsiderate jerk put you over 30k. High tier weapons never go in my vending machine. They only go up for trade. Everything else is scrip (for me at least). 
---
Don’t put all your eggs in the basket and get mad when the whole basket sells. I got blasted the other day because I cleaned out a dude’s vending machine of bulk adhesive he priced at 50c each. Cost me about 3k. He was mad that he lost out on 1,000 caps because it put him over. So a couple of things he could have done to avoid this, lower the cost of items, put less items in the machine for sale, put the machines on a switch, turn the switch off, put the machines behind a wall that can’t be accessed. Stop blaming the shoppers because they put you over. Earn 30k, go blow 5 to 10k on ammo and scrip and junk and turn your machines back on.

If you like fighting earl the asbestos lining for your torso will prevent you from dieing to fallen embers, sadly it takes the same spot as the jet pack.
---
Server hopping is one thing. But refusing to accept trade invites after accepting the first time is another level of dick behavior
---
Really?  Seriously asking what you use it for. Doesn’t transporting away negate any benefits?
---
Thanks I appreciate it! I already logged off though in frustration lol
---
I agree 100 percent . But they want you to spend money and to log on daily . Sucks game studios no longer in control of their products.
---
Good With Salt is a Perk card under the Luck category. Rank 3 reduces food spoilage in your personal inventory (**not** the Stash) by 90%.
---
Mirelurk hunters to be exact.
---
Think of every gun in the game.
---
Add stalkers legendary perk to them
---
That's what I have obtained.
---
I'd use it. If I was bloodied. I think AA/E/90 is my current main.
---
R/pkoa (Peacekeepers of Appalachia) has a really active bunch of ps4 players
---
I’ve been having this problem as well. It is SUCH a big grind. I’ve honestly been on it almost every day, for at least a couple hours, for about a month and I’m still pretty damn far from any max rep. Call me casual if you will, but I still do the dailies and everything every time. They just give so little reputation it hurts. Really have been keeping my eyes out for any good guide on completing it quick. And I get it’s not suppose to be quick as it’s the end game, but after doing the same shit for so long I have such a hard time seeing how to get there.
---
Oh those are “ whatchugots “ they don’t even wanna trade just look at your gear and even in some cases report you for having legacies, some people are jackasses
---
I couldn't agree more, bigger ramps would be awesome too.
---
I wish we could change the floor type on it too so it matches the rest of the floors.
---
Yeah the first THREE, LITERALLY THE FIRST THREE I crafted were unyielding. Then the next 60 were Hunter, Nocturnal, Assassin, Poisener , etc.
---
One time i joined a group when the event wasn't reachable, i was in the mine but not not in the event and i stayed at the end for 20 minutes in perfect silence...

You don’t have to pay to spend atom points I’ve never bought any I just work hard on those challenges
---
You need 9 shots to get full 45% dmg bonus. On the first shot furious does same dmg as non-legendary one. You need to shoot about 14 times to do more dmg than anti armor would. Unless you fight boss you are wasting ammo.
---
I brew and sell Nuka-Cola Dark, high voltage hedge, and hard lemonade. Need plans for ballistic bock. My bootlegging operations sell a fair bit.  Just keep doing Biv’s quests.
---
I agree. Player base is way too used to being the God of the Sandbox and having every character groveling at their feet. They don't like it when they see stronger players or enemies. They can't wrap their heads around teamwork.
---
We need another bot that goes: Space. Space? Space! Spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace! Spacespacespace...

Profit.

As an aside, Mutant Hound Meat, when cooked, actually sells for decent caps, especially if you have the Hard Bargain perk card maxed.
---
LOL, I've been playing this game for a while and still haven't got any really good weapons! Either from Mama Stingy or from drops! Oh well, the game is still a blast and I'll see about respecing my character after legendary perks drop to increase my damage. Maybe I'll finally drop a nuke before patch 22 comes out, I still haven't done it yet.
---
Nails on a chalkboard would be better than that fate.
---
That plan is the first thing I move to an alt.
---
Pretty much
---
That still works ?
---
This rule is more about names like *"Pedo Hines"* or *"TODDler Lover Howard"*
---
Ouchy! I'm working through them a limb at a time. Getting nowhere fast! HaHa.
---
Mate, I'm pretty sure that's in direct violation of the geneva convention.
---
Its great if you want some extra melee damage for a really tough enemy and you know for a fact that you can kill it before you teleport away
---
Gotcha. I think I redeemed most of my scrip, if not all, earlier. I just haven’t sold my legendary weapons yet
---
Truth. There aren’t very many day 1 players left out there.
---
The Rocksy rep gimmick is definitely not fixed, at least on PS4. I mentioned it to a friend last night - he's been saying for weeks that he wanted to use it before it was patched, and I taunted him that people were saying it's already gone. He ran up and tried and it worked fine.
---
if there are a lot of players doing collosus problem, tp there and damage the wendigo spawns, let the other players kill em and get like 8 screws per one dead wendigo
---
These should have automatically unlocked when you turned in scrap. Going and claiming the rewards after the fact is dumbass
---
Thanks everyone :)
---
I don’t know about you but around 75% or more of the pieces I craft are *** so scripting them at 24 scrip at a time means only six pieces at a time max. Add to that all the cursed harpoon guns- at least they’re 90% weight.
---
I make sure each of my characters has a 'tagger' weapon for events like this.

2 of them are explosive vampire pipe pistol (nothing says I'm not one-shotting like a pipe pistol)

The other is a B/33/90 10MM - it tags a little harder, but still gets the job done (sticking to torso shots and no pistol perks means they survive several hits)
---
One. One that didnt bug out when on display. A couple 90% weight reduction harpoons would look nice on my pirate ship to help repel customers...I mean boarders.
---
Ima have to disagree with you there
---
Yeah ! So that’s not only me !? The harpoon gun doesn’t show in the heavy weapon rack.
---
perk card, found in Luck
---
Like a Shotgun, yeah!
---
DB shotgun can shoot 3 times in vats at its higher rate fire so if it's a two shot, 3\*2, it seems normal.
---
lmao you really don't need a master's degree in psychology to realize that the only reason why we are limited in the amount of things we can have and do is because of money/greed from bethe$$$da....
---
An amazing camp plan would have been an accordion made from his neck and jaw
---
This is another problem, the in-game announcement for this item was up before the item was actually available.  So I saw the announcement, tried to get it, couldn't, and then took a few days off and missed it.
---
Noice! Good to know
---
Yeah sounds about right bud! HaHa.
---
Yup it's nice when it's not. But of course I just did uranium fever and the only other guy just 1 shots all the supervisors because people are assholes
---
Corner stairs like what I don’t know.... are already in the game??????
---
Lately I’ve only run across those types of people that cherry pick and one shot kill.  All they need to do is bash it a few times with their gun and wave everyone over.  On the other hand the very last two events I ran by myself LOL nobody showed up
---
Whisky is easy and with the alcohol perk card gives you +6str. I'm always buying it if I see it reasonably priced.
---
The firework glitch? Yeah. But I often have to unequip and re-equip after changing weapons. Sometimes after fast traveling.
---
I think it’s worth it for the rifle builds absolutely. I alternate between .45 and 5.56 like most commandos. 5.56 is 200 rounds at about 40-50 minutes, .45 gets you like 333 or something like that in about an hour and a half. Totally worth it. If anything it’s just extra ammo on top of what you craft. Also with the raider collection if you have that he picks up 5.56 and .45 quite frequently. Just about every time I empty his bin I get about 40-50 rounds of each along with some weapons to scrap for steel.
---
Can we please get this thread upvoted!
---
I intentionally put crops and water specifically for people to loot. It’s a nice way to say “Sorry you didn’t find what you wanted at my vendor. I’ve reimbursed you for your travel at little cost to myself.”    
---
Locking is a well understood mechanic. If they don’t lock their stuff, it’s a high probability it’s a gift. The best evidence is when there are 1-2 locked purifiers and the rest are unlocked. The locked items are the proof that the unlocked ones are for you. The exception proves the rule.
---
Aaaand that's why multiplayer is cancer. Game should be offline single player.
---
Personally, I appreciate Bethesda giving everyone something to do during this bye week. With no challenges available, they have given us the opportunity to post about the nuclear codes not working.
---
What do you mean? Did I miss something?
---
Probably not the first thing to get.  I would recommend getting any armor first (SS Chest + Jetpack if you use normal armor then the rest /PA), then your weapon, then the ammo machine.
---
Great info. 
---
Finding and looting Earle’s corpse is potentially another problem especially if it was turned to ash. 
---
It would be tough to use the in game camera to look for the corpse while the Wendigo spawns are staggering you.
---
They're starting to turn into the new mounted head plans at player vendors. Six weapons for sale, neat! Oh wait, they're all cursed weapons.
---
Major code sites have codes with note that they are all bugged and probably will not work
---
u/Ladydevann is aware I believe.
---
That's insane. I hope they buff the right things in the future. Lever action rifles and sniper rifles should be hard hitters
---
I'm a level 220 and it happens to me often as well. Jerks one shotting the legendaries, very frustrating. I always try to wave everyone over to get a round into the target.
---
Handy that they're 90% Reduced Weight, so can carry one just for giggles. ;)
---
im here just for le ebin EPIC upboats (just like all of you)
---
I saved 95% of mine from season 1 and will use as a last resort if needed in 2. It's my plan B in case life goes sideways for me.
---
Pneumatic on the chest piece helps alot against getting staggered durring events.
---
Yeah, going rate around here is 8-10k. I was sitting on a bunch so popped one in my vendor for 10k and sold in a few hours lol
---
No I made a post similar in 76 settlements with the same thought. I brought up the bay windows and corner wooden stairs that are in most open buildings could easily easily be implemented. They should have come with the contemporary bundle.
---
Last time I got killed browsing the vendor when the game decided to give me a wanted status (just for joining the server, didn't even pick a lock, only spawned at an occupied workshop). Asshole took some of my junk. Blew up part of his camp.
---
If you are standing in the waiting area faceing the drop in to earls arena, the tunnel you would run down is on your left.. there's a minecart track there.
---
No wonder I haven't been on a single server that dropped a nuke.
---
It's doing work for you that requires no engagement. I'm pumping out 556 as it's the fastest and will convert it for 50 cal ammo since that ammo is slow. No matter how you cut it making ammo for free is going to convert to something in some way (either by straight converting it or trading/selling it). So it's worth the gold for sure.
---
Take my imaginary gold 🏅
---
I want a pipe organ or harpsicord that plays Toccata and Fugue.
---
Go get your own screws.
---
No worries, can you send an invite?
---
One thing that will vary dramatically, is the "gain a level" bonuses, as it's much easier to accomplish this when you're lower level (particularly with the new teams, making fast travel to the higher level events both cheap and safe). A 10th level guy at "line in the sand" isn't in much danger from the "scorched horde", although his ability to gain experience may consist of timing on his grenades.
---
Oh, interesting. That's cute! :P
---
You got an updoot from me!
---
Missile sticks. Like throwing knives but more useful, and with a big kaboom
---
I’m not sharing what makes me money! Get off my lawn!!
---
Same.  What's up with that?
---
Use herbivore mutation with a company tea drink and I'm pretty sure you'll regen full AP before you even hit the ground with it, super fun to just fly everywhere
---
I just bash it to tag it so I don't do much damage, and I highly recommend that.
---
Some cuck was sprinting around in power armor one shotting them with his hammer. The first time I thought maybe it was an accident, it does happen. But he literally killed all three, no one else got anything. He kept doing hearts at everyone. Ultimate asshole. But that's the world we live in.
---
As the other have said, Pneumatic, Dense or Jet Pack anything else is almost certainly a “poor choice”
---
Oh and Buttressed, only resistance mod worth thinking about and it was dumb for Bethesda to even offer others being that we can go straight to the best.
---
You can do all the bitching and name calling you want without the mic on. I don't want to hear your 10 year old self crying because you died or didn't get a legendary from a level 80 sheepsquatch with your level 5 pipe gun.
---
No, we are all visiting u/TrimHawk 's grandma for a week, hence we all missed the BoS collectron.
---
If you're specced into them and have good aim, they hit **hard**. Plus you aren't spending all your time scrounging for ammo.
---
Autos &amp; big guns are a lot easier to kill things with, but you can build semi-auto rifles that one shot a lot of enemies.
---
There is absolutely no reason to NOT have fishing. 
---
ESO has fishing and while it's not my personal favorite, it's still fun and can be super relaxing.
---
I have a junkies 10mm set up for auto that does a little more than half the damage my handmade does.
---
It has a smaller mag, a little less range, and way less damage.  The only reason I use it is for fun I suppose. 
---
It does have a quicker reload and thats really the only advantage. 
---
Buff pistol damage!!
---
Yes they/we do. Check us out.
---
No, no - it's like Disney movies. Get it now, before it goes back in the vault (not sure which, maybe 94?) for decades!
---
24 hours? I was launching and watched others launch all night between 10 pm and 4 am.
---
I donated once and got the machine. Sorry man :(
---
Yeah, it lets me play a few games from my back log for once lol I do wanna know what happened though. What caused it
---
I sure hope so! I wanna know what happened/caused this
---
Not to be rude but I don’t think they can handle making a functional rolling animation that won’t break the game. 10/10 on emotes, some people are trynna play Caps Tycoon™️ and should go bankrupt.
---
Snagged it with 2 hours left on the timer. I was surprised.
---
I completed it but I did use 450 atoms to reach the Chicken Coop. Aside from buying 3 levels I did the rest naturally.
---
I saw whats on the next run &amp; I'm pretty excited about it.
---
She's bakin quite good cookies, luv visiting her!
---
To be fair, people who were actively participating in the event got a **3-days heads up** on when the Collectron was being added to the shop to be claimed by [looking at that week's Atomic Shop post](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/aziPqMpE2SiBmqWPiAxUb/atomic-shop-weekly-update-september-1-8) on the main website. After it was added, players had **3 days to claim it**, which imho is plenty of time for people who are active players.
---
One could easily say that because of how little time Bethesda gave players to claim it, they were only interested in awarding the players who actively play the game and are actively paying attention to the event (not like the back-seaters like in [Project Clean Appalachia](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/cm1RPKthQ75aMdF9dQY4m/fallout-76-project-clean-appalachia) who had literal MONTHS to claim the rewards.).
---
Just an observation.
---
I've got seven. HA
---
I’m not a first responder I’m more like a second responder
---
Don’t know who that is but it’s not possible..
---
Lol.  I hope its already been listed.  I need to do more quests with Biv.
---
If you have the contemporary building set you can use the white posts to plug the space. One on each side makes it impossible to fall down.
---
after my previous comment earlier, made another 4K caps.
---
Then vendor hopped... found a radiation emitter? NEVER seen that before.. 7600caps.. sure that's rare I guess and I didn't have it.
---
Next vendor... that bloodied gold roll combat shotty I been looking for for 15K caps... I was a bit salty from my previous purchase, but then remembered my tirade on over priced stuff and was like ..Forget that.. ill find another later.
---
Meanwhile some level 600 dude BUYS OUT all my 50cap lowbie 1star weapons that I spent time and material for modding for the lowbies.... sigh. Prolly just going to scrip them all.
---
yea i did. if i remember correctly im geting this problem right after I finish that quest was like 3month\* ago befor i made my comment here
---
HOW DARE YOU LOCK YOUR DOORS!!! 
---
...oops, wrong "you must build Your Camp to My rules' moan. 😁
---
Seriously, some folk need to suck it up and learn what" My Camp, My Rules" means. Can't wait for instanced interiors, hopefully it means I can keep the riff raff out even more securely.
---
If you’re looking to add to the group then I’m interested in tagging along, I’m level 290 right now looking to hit 300 hopefully some time soon and I’m getting bored of my usual runs between huntersville, westek and the golf club
---
Poseidon power plant claim it and it has a fusion core generator
---
Oh I gotcha. Yeah I don’t see how they would be so difficult to add. Especially if it’s already an asset in the game.
---
That’s the joke , he can also launch nukes from his pipboy and won survival mode
---
I’m not answering that!
---
Yup that's happened to me 5 or 6 times this summer. But only once or twice they took the workshop. It can make me salty but I try to remember that I did pay 25 caps to except the warning I'm opening my self up for an ass whopping. I run a melee build at lvl 140 so the sneak builds take me before I find them. One night I spent 20+ minutes (trying to ) fight this one, for the player to thank me for a good pvp. ( I was a pin cushion, he still kept the workshop) good times
---
Take a break for a week then the next season starts
---
Just... why?
---
If you actually think that nuking somebodies camp does anything you are delusional at best...
---
I must be too old to get the reference
---
I'm playing on a private server to prevent interactions with players.
---
Though I am thinking that I'll need to add some players to make things more interesting eventually.  
---
Could be funny to have some non-RP types messing with me while I stay in character. It would either be really funny or a total disaster and end up on the cutting room floor.
---
Prolly take over a power plant workshop for a day. 
---
Alternatively you could hop power armor spots but they are not gonna be full
---
Don’t craft them
---
This is unfortunately what happened to me personally with the Legendary Run, as much as I had been looking forward to completing it and hyping it up to friends. If the game expects me to hop on almost DAILY to complete the pass, and as I had ended up falling behind, why bother coming back? And my attention fell with other games. Granted, I suppose that’s the price of 76’s battle pass being “free”.
---
I have gold, but I haven't found anywhere I can spend it?
---
Skyrim has it
---
Except that with ACP, the best mod at this moment for chest is albastos, and more with daily ops in patch 22....
---
I had some bugged challenges &amp; contacted Bethesda. They gave me a miraculously easy fix so I'll share with you so you can see if it helps. I'm on Xbox so if you're on a different platform I don't know where you look for this but you delete LOCAL SAVE ONLY. Bam. Actually fixed a few issues I'd been having ie: on one toon I was unable to speak to Ward. Deleted local save file &amp; it fixed that too.
---
I don't think that's rude at all. There's a mod on Skyrim that allows you to roll and it works pretty well surprisingly. Like you said though it could be pretty cumbersome. Literally. I see a lot of scrip going for 3k but I don't have the time to individually message people and explain why their prices are bad, nor do I have time to argue if they think I'm being rude but I feel like a gesture might nudge them a bit
---
my group of people, me being 290, another being 330+ and the other sitting around 280 will occasionally help out lower level players, if we wanna fight with people one of us just leaves the team and we pvp with each other.
---
He solos Earle.  Super mutants make him laugh.
---
Buttressed and albastos for chest for ACP and future daily ops. The others depuis pocketed or ultralight if it comes in patch 22
---
The best way is to locate power armor frames and loot them from those
---
I would say Events in the first place,  then buying from other players. I pay ~100 caps for a fully charged core, i think thats fair.
---
You can of cource also jump from Power armor spawn to Power armor spawn and try to loot All the fusion cores. But i think none of them is fully charged, at least i never saw one i think.
---
Crafting is what i would Not recommend as its the resource heaviest way i think.
---
And: If you not already got it, get the Power User perk in the intelligence tree. That makes your fusion cores last twice the time they would normaly do. At Max level. In Weapons and in Power armor 
---
Gl
---
Oh wow, it totally is broke!
---
Happened again last night, figured out the dude had an underground section, went down and he had a bunch of unlocked glitched ammo generators from the munitions factory, so I glitched thru his wall and took all the ammo, he shortly left afterwards
---
Amazing.
---
Imagine trying to roll in power armor
---
yeah i got the perk but i just didnt know about the power plants all my cores have come from generators,suits,and from others
---
I went to find wolfs trap the other day not nothing it started a event that was recommended level 50 (I'm 34). Then suddenly two level 100+ plus come out of nowhere and complete the event. I didn't even bother trying to get any loot at that point I was just keeping my self alive and just got the event rewards. I didn't even get chance to see there names to say thanks.
---
you can craft them at the Thunder Mountain Power Plant (I've never done it... so don't know exactly how it goes)
---
Or just walk around and look for generators.  
---
For example, there are 2 at the Camden parks and 2 (or 3?) at the Mount Blair Trainyard.  
---
Once you know where they are, it gets easy to find them.  
---
Also I assume you already use the "Power User" perk card at level 3 if you are a Power Armor user.
---
I’m giving them away for free in my vendor hoping the low levels will take them but I still have like a dozen. I just wanna know why
---
Cool.  I’ll brew some up!
---
Well im on ps4 and i just cant see to find someone selling the plan
---
Did you ever manage to figure out a way? I've been trying for a long time to figure how to plant my trees in an underground garden using soil tiles
---
It would be silly, and not even fallout silly, just absurd. The fishing poles are in the game because they are legitimately usable as weapons realistically, along with canes and pins, blunt and heavy. and the poles and meat hooks were introduced in fallout 4's Far Harbor DLC, and the story to those weapons was that they are used because that's all they had access to after the fog pushed the islanders to the harbor.
---
Until they address unyielding, bloody will be king.
---
Uranium fever. If you loot the mole miners after the event you get quite a few plans. If I'm not mistaken it's a level 35/45 weapon plan
---
Thank you for the feedback!
---
I really appreciate it. And the feedback about removing the dialogue boxes is totally doable. What I can do is stretch out the video length before the dialogue box appears while leaving the audio the same. Then cut before the box appears.   
---
I also can try turning my HUD off during dialogue. I have been keeping it on because I learned you can't loot corpses when the HUD is off and some items won't interact properly when its off. Really annoying.  
---
I'm also planning to add cuts to my face during conversations so when I talk you see my face and when someone like Duchess talks you see her. I forgot to record that footage before I had finished episode 2, so expect that in episode 3. I'll also try to fix the dialogue boxes for episode 3 too.  
---
ya the jumpiness is caused by framerate. I play on Xbox and I'll be honest...the computer I record to and edit on is not designed for this. Its an old server I built to run a bot a few years ago. I need a new computer but can't afford one yet. I'm sure once I do there will be a huge quality jump in my videos.
---
You don't like hunting through 3 floors of a floating build to find their vendors that are all sideways, behind a wall, and the only way to access them is by looking through a window (inside the building) at stupid angles?
---
Because I have had to do just that.... several times.
---
I will take you up on that! I think my name is Mckron in the game, too. 
---
I'm a bit shy in the game so more friends the more it will kick me out off that nonsense. And thanks!
---
after the nerf, bloodied is going to be around 50% stronger than junkie's. whether that's worth the hp penalty is up to you.
---
If it makes you feel any better, I'm only able to play for two weeks a month, due to my work schedule. I miss 95% of that shit.
---
Not to mention better legendarys off the spawns then the queen usually.
---
they say the resources are too much to get and carrying em are too heavy but i mean if you got the material why not craft it . you can do it at yo base if you find the right stuff
---
angryturtle posted a video a few days ago detailing every mod.
---
Sinseer got it months ago
---
Yeah, I remember the three struggles early in the Fallout games, stims, caps and ammo. And then you will have more than you can ever use of all three later.
---
If you play on ps4 i would gladly help
---
I wonder if it includes Legendary Scrap this time.
---
Well Al, I got a minute care to share?
---
They respawn until the event is cleared for each area, but it's a pretty generous timer and you can hack the turrets to keep bots busy.
---
Worth it for use and for selling ammo.
---
He killed me twice withing like 2 minutes. He killed me just after i finished claiming, and then once i respawned outside the plant, cuz my camp is right in front of the train station and i didnt think to spawn there.
---
Yea it spawns couple here and there but it’s not something crazy but I’ll probably hold on doing that nuke run I’ve been seeing people say that the codes aren’t working rn
---
If using steam how to make a new account. Like will I have to make a new steam account and purchase the game again?
---
I have a full farm despite having the carnivore mutation. Never know when someone stopping by will need it.
---
Howard said it’s embarrassing that they can’t climb ladders in fallout games. There is an interview on it. Pretty funny.
---
And I am SURE I bought stuff from your vendor before! :D
---
Man I would love to visit these places, but America is scary in these times
---
I'm a leech. I contributed literally nothing to this event but made sure to follow the threads and log in every time there was a reward.
---
When you turn in Ward's quest, donating the rewards to Foundation gives bonus reputation.
---
Thanks for the heads up.
---
I'll look it up thanks.  Travel safe.
---
I'll never understand people who say bloodied is op because of unyielding.
---
unyielding doesn't do anything you shouldn't already excel at. it also doesn't add to your damage or make you any tankier.
---
post is removed F
---
2 things. 
---
1. Did you ever manage to get this to work, im desperate to do something similar. 
---
2. Did you save the picture of the rooftop garden
---
I don't think you can go back and have the machine make you them but through the help of others who chose the different named inoculation drinks you can get them
---
Ah dang. Yeh I have spent hours looking for the plans a few weeks ago when I was looking to buy one.
---
My best luck is with people who
---
have only a few plans, like less than 50 so they're not all monster heads and the like.
---
Lmao I can't tell you how many times I've done this
---
The screen shake would give me a migraine lmao
---
You can get them from other players who chose the other options.
---
I sometimes see them in player vendors for 20-50 caps
---
Mine was giving me the same stuff as the raider one after I switched them, but might be a glitch
---
If you find out let me know. I’ll run solo earles or in groups idc
---
This probably need further confirmation, but I am pretty sure that, if you accpet to log in a world where you can't place your camp (because someone else is here), your food is actually not considered in the fridge.
---
That's what I was wondering, will it just show up as Nuka Cola my bloods in it regardless of what the player chose or will it be what the player chose.
---
Ok perfect, thanks!
---
I’ll try it on a private server, but as far as I know when you turn off the music the ghouls dry up.
---
Yeppp lmao and this one adds food and water to that list
---
Every power plant has a fusion core generator. They require 100 power to run. You can either a) power up the power plant, which will give you enough energy to run the generator, or b) plop down a fusion/nuclear generator right next to it and use that to power it, or run a sequence of lesser generators that together add up to 100 output. If you run just one fusion core generator for a while, you'll have plenty of fusion cores. If you go on a spree and take all 3 power plants at the same time and run all 3 fusion core generators at once, you'll be swimming in them.
---
This will be only a personal opinion and if they work for your play style that is great, but I run the emergency protocols on chest and calibrated legs on both legs. Haven’t added mods to any other piece.
---
I believe you can buy them from others and you can also get them with alt characters.
---
I think TECHNICALLY you could capture a bunch of workshops with a team, and build those up, since that's like an infinite building journey in itself haha. But in that scenario, building teams \[or just regular non-teamed peasants!\] would duke it out over workshops, thus transitioning into BATTLESHOP teams fighting over workshops instead! 
---
That don't seem too intelligent none at that point, now huh?! 😁😂
---
I'd rather they add a canning system, let me can my food so it doesn't go bad after 5mins of creating it.
---
I missed it also. Why would you not put rewards up for at least a week?
---
I just hit Quarry X3 daily as there is a fixed Queen spawn there.
---
Jump to my mule
---
Also thanks for taking away my vats, now 3 of my characters are trash....😡
---
Yes it does if you're meelee. 15 extra strength gives you a LOT of damage
---
The game will "pause" and you'll see a pop up notification  in a box saying something along the lines of the server is not responding. That can carry on for a minute or so before you get kicked.
---
Oh shit that’s true. Mayhaps time will tell if it comes to Appalachia. Might as well go pistol build and be McCree if so.
---
Too often.  It's been well over a year and Bethesda still hasn't bothered to separate Clothing from Armor, or denote how many Legendaries are for sale at a CAMP.
---
The only insight we've gained is that, sometimes, you can find a user through the Public Teams feature and determine their level.  Not that this precludes the odd Lv. 400 player who sells nothing but generic outfits...
---
It's supposed to be like this.
---
Watch angry turtle on ut
---
My thing is that it mostly likely going to be sold for scrip.  What is the worst that could happen with me tagging it with my pistol.
---
This makes me sad, but it's true.
---
I hate that they're moving AWAY from elements like this...  
---
If anything, put it in a separate mode. What 'survival mode' should be. Hunger thirst and sleep that MATTER, hostile rad storms... fun stuff like that... probably a separate post by its self...
---
You can also do davenport's quests. take photo's of foundation and instead of giving them to him give them to the crater
---
yeah, melee being the obvious exception. but melee comes with its own slew of problems and is getting a massive nerf, moreso than the rest.
---
Dont launch today.  it seems the nuke codes are bugged.  But it will take you an hour or so.
---
If you use .45's or 5.56's then yes, absolutely. In about 1 hour real time, it can craft 200 and hold of the 5.56 ammo type. It can hold 333 of the .45 ammo type, but it takes a couple of hours to craft that much.
---
Anything that builds on its sneakiness. Sneak and Covert Ops are good in agility, as well as agility points overall as they impact stealth. The Fixer is a combat rifle so it responds to the rifle and commando perks, so maxing either of those out is good. Tank Killer is good for armor piercing and Bloody Mess for higher damage in general.
---
Me too, and the clipping
---
This is simply the way of the gaming world right now. Like it or not, post-purchase revenue is the key to padding your corporation's bottom line. Plus, a "self-funded" (read: microtransaction-driven) game keeps your brand in the zeitgeist, so you can pocket more dollars as opposed to investing in marketing at a certain loss vs. new players. "Traditional" game devs are taking cues from mobile game devs in this regard. Because you are willing to pay $10 to unlock something in Candy Crush, Bethesda knows you will do the same here. And, those who say they never buy anything from those "free" games, I suppose they ignore the ads in-game which accomplish the same goal. A lot of people seem to think that because your game sells a million copies that you are rolling in the money. After factoring in OPEX and CAPEX for each of those units moved, very little comes back to the cash account of the company.
---
Look at it another way. There are 272,000+ members of this subreddit, but there are only 3600+ playing the game (at the time of this writing) (also, no idea where this number comes from). I've never seen this number over 6,000. If more people on this subreddit were playing consistently, then more people would be buying atoms. More people buying atoms means potentially lower prices in the atom shop. Right now, there's a very small percentage of the community (in and outside reddit) that are regularly playing and spending atoms and/or subscribing to 1st to "keep the lights on". How many of us have ever actually paid for atoms (aside from 1st subs)? I'd argue very, very few in comparison to how many people appear to own the game. Just look at how many are upset that there is no atom grind outside of the seasons now AND it is significantly reduced from "before". Atom rewards are free money for literally playing a game. And still we complain. Everybody likes free stuff, but Bethesda has made it harder to play forever without investing even a little money into the world.
---
Do they have code integrity issues? Given how old, fixed bugs come back, yes. Do they have QA issues? Apparently, based on the previous answer. Do they lack proper project management to prioritize bugs and clean up the code base? Yes, I think this is abundantly clear to anyone who has worked in software dev or tried to use GECK. Has the game improved? Yes, and if you say it hasn't, you're simply hating for the sake of hating. What we have now is a washed, raw diamond in need of proper polishing &amp; cutting to turn it into a gem/gems. That takes money.
---
That said, there are a lot of complaints, and I, like others, have a love-hate relationship with the Atom Shop. However, I'm level 278 on a single character, but on 2 platforms, PS &amp; XB. I've definitely gotten my money's worth out of the game investing hundreds of hours in playing. Many of us here have multiple characters meaning exponentially more hours played. I believe a lot of the vitriol stems from many of us playing Fallout 3, NV, &amp; 4. We had a lot of the assets we are having to buy in 76 available in the vanilla build menu from FO4.
---
Bundled items should *always* be available as separate purchases, IMO. For example, I wanted the tiled roof because it was a significant camp budget savings. However, I did not want anything else in the bundle to get it. Is a roof texture worth 500 atoms (\~$5 USD) alone? No, not in my opinion. But, I am the consumer here, so I can choose to not spend my atoms at my discretion. That said, I am also a 1st subscriber - on 2 platforms - with ZERO regrets. The tent and the scrapbox are great, but I most enjoy having a private instance to get the single-player feel I want. I am technically buying \~$16 worth of atoms a month at a discount with a bunch of other perks/rewards thrown in. Do I spend them all each month? Nope. I'm still stingy with how I spend those atoms even though I already paid for them.
---
On that topic, should the scrapbox be free? Maybe, probably, but how do you pay for the server real estate needed to process/catalog those items? It's a balancing act, and consumers are not going to get the better end of the deal. Ever. Same reason we have folks charging 5000 caps for a weapon that their neighbor is charging 500. Both vendors are seeking a certain profit margin to allow them to invest in something to better their experience/reward their efforts. What Bethesda is doing is the same thing - they are trying to keep the lights on, so to speak.
---
Holy shit, this right here. Whatever dev decided each unseen food item should take up as much fucking budget as a bobblehead should be fired.
---
Yeah, I get that from time to time, rare, like once a month.
---
Last time, was someone who randomly kept meleeing my level 40 alt while crafting in my camp.
---
So i disable pacifist, and while he was taking stuff from my unlocked collectron (I intentionally leave it unlocked so others can benefit form it), I unloaded two shotgun rounds to the back of his head. One to enable PVP, one to end him.
---
It's kind of annoying; fast traveled to white spring station to sell some crud and got nabbed by him at the door; then after selling stuff and trying to walk out I got nabbed again :/
---
It adds STR, so if, like me, you're a PF user, it adds damage. It adds INT, which increases exp gained...and so on. How are you so dense?
---
That sucks. Best way I’ve found to give new players an edge up is just to put non legendary BoS armor and non legendary fixers in the machines for cheap. Usually 100 or less caps. No high level player is gonna spend 50 caps on a level 20 fixer (well none have yet at least). That’s what The combo I use for leveling new toons at least. Others may do the same. 
---
Graham usually has the radiation emitter plan. I don’t remember the price of it, maybe 800 or so? I checked him every time I saw him during meat week because the plans he carries change every now and then, but I’ve also stopped collecting plans I already know, except for the limited time reward ones. So it’s not super rare. 4k may be a bit on the high side, but if you’ve been playing for a while and haven’t seen it yet then it’s as fair a price as it’s gonna be. 
---
I usually snatch up items that should be reserved for trades when someone has them in their machines (although cost does factor in sometimes... except for the one time I got a BSS+strength super sledge for 700c). I’ll only drop big caps, like 10k+, on things I’m actually gonna use. Never more than that if it’s something I’d just trade off. 
---
I have a penchant for cleaning out vending machines of any legos that priced under 100 caps when I don’t feel like hunting legendary enemies (gotta feed the scrip monster lol). Probably gonna be the case this week since we’re in between seasons and nuke silos are bugged.
---
Silos are glitchy at the moment. I'd wait a few days and don't waste your keycards.
---
I lost my junk in that mine without the event even happening.
---
Warped in for  radrat hoarde event. It spawned me inside the mine entrance, was a little tiny 1 man room. Before I could warp out, I was "crushed" to death. 
---
Sigh.... Glitched even without the event happening haha.
---
I just shoot the prizebot whenever I encounter it.
---
Now I might be asking a silly question but you’ve created a Bethesda account right?
---
Yes, yes you have.
---
She’s just a fandom encounter so any random encounter location
---
Everything’s fucked right now. I’ve already burned 3 cards before realizing it’s bugged out.
---
I find them literally everywhere. Swear to god it’s every other mole miner and it’s loot in a lot of cases. They fall from the goddamn sky
---
9. ”Smart use of game mechanics” will save you a month and give bethesda no $$$
---
Literally just went through Charlie put my keycard and couldn’t find the codes so I’m guessing it’s bugged
---
haha facts
---
I’d much rather they either let us scrap ammo or fix the ammo converter so I can trade in any amount of ammo.
---
Well, at least that answers it :/
---
Kind of annoying though since it's the first time I've seen her before despite playing for quite while.
---
Wouldnt be so annoying if the wiki didnt say she had a sidequests
---
Oh well, thanks
---
Gotta love it lol. I'm in pacifist I'm pretty sure but he kept hitting me so I just started running backwards, got a little space between us and then wound up the minigun. Then watched as he hit the ground lol. He's still messaging me calling me trash and demanding i fight him again 😂
---
like I just said to another user,
---
&gt;yeah, melee being the obvious exception. but melee comes with its own slew of problems and is already getting a massive nerf, moreso than the rest.
---
and extra exp is hardly op. so yeah, I still have no idea what you're going on about.
---
They will keep coming but it’s merciless. People are posting here that nuke codes aren’t working though right now.
---
An ammo box would be a nice thing to have.
---
Same, don't feel arm mods to be worth it in general for PA.
---
It depends on the build you run.
---
Wow that’s annoying I just used my last one 🤣
---
I really just want an option to scrap ammo to get lead and steel back, that'd be great, might render the converter obsolete tho
---
I will have to snag that after my next atom farm
---
Fix what?
---
You have way too much free time sir
---
I feel your pain brotha. Computer died right before a two day trip for a basketball tourney for my son's team. Didn't have time to get back and get things working again.
---
People want to pvp in the game. I get it if you don't neither do I, but initiating pvp is difficult in most cases. You tubers that do it can be looking up to 9 hours to get some pvp
---
id say so unless they create some sort of penalty for dying.
---
I believe it's in sale this week but I'm not sure the price.
---
Iv had a few people on my private team do that... Slap a swastaka in my camp XD
---
Hell I even had a guy do it in my camp and workshop and then threatened to get me banned if I didn't give him my gun.....
---
Thankfully haven't been banned yet due to that bullshit.
---
Damn, I would have kept it 🤣
---
This worked very well for a long time, ofc few times idiots showed up (they got nuked, meat grenade or pvp’d).
---
Its almost hard to believe camps were not protected for a good while after launch 😄
---
For now, being lvl 1000 does not get you automagically more powerful than a lvl 50 player.
---
That's what I thought and which is why I turned it back on, but then I get the thumbs down emote. Never tried it on a private server though as I don't want the event to fail ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
“Big hitter, the Lama.”
---
Well shit I missed it as well
---
It’s actually easier solo. The enemies spawn more or less depending how many people are in the silo so it’s not uncommon for me to be solo and only get 5/10 enemies the entire launch prep
---
For real. 
---
The ground could be flat asf and open asf and it would still say “cannot intersect with another object” or “must be supported” 
---
-.-‘
---
There are no challenges. The season is over and until the next one there are no daily and weekly challenges
---
Well, Because it's 5 flux (one of every kind) for 1 fusion core and you can get tons of them for basically free from power plants.
---
Maybe when Ammo Factory comes out and if the rounding down for ammo doesn't happen till the final product will crafting fusion cores be atleast decent value.
---
Fire an issue?
---
If you gave the photos to raider/settlers, you have to go back to Davenport to end the quest, he won't give you the repeatable quest until you close it out first.
---
There aren't any until the new season starts next week.
---
Can anybody here tell me if pipe pistols when modded to a rifle are still affected by pistol and rifle cards both? 
---
They were sleeper monsters back in the day because of that, before I took a year break. Did that get patched out?
---
When I started out, high level bros always gave me a hand, dropping me legendaries that I want to work and level for, plans, ammo, caps. You name it. This game was supposed to be a grind but it never really felt like it.
---
Now I'm a level 200+ and when I see fresh blood, I always do the same for them hoping that once they get to high levels, they'd do the same for others too.
---
The pay forward mentality in this community is just terrific.
---
Yeah, it's kinda useless otherwise, as ultracite lasers leave a lot to be desired.
---
That's good to hear. Most of the super hostile players are bloodies, so keeping a gamma gun on you is always good, low weight and super effective.
---
If it helps, the reward is useless garbage.
---
Would you be interested in a ve90 flamer I can’t comment on your post
---
Right. ANY way to preserve it. Fridge, freezer, canning, Mason jars, monosodium glutamate injections... anything...
---
Where r u? Im waiting
---
Haha that's awesome, glad to hear you're enjoying it, and tolerating the teams! Get some sleep!
---
Sometimes a controller can break from a functional, not visible point.
---
I’ve had controllers that stopped sending the pressed button (or in your case, got stuck in a loop of sending said input). Personally I’d assume it’s the controller
---
Hmm..I’m going to have to try this instead of jamming away on a banjo for my smoke breaks lol
---
Everybody has that because the seasons over until season 2 drops next week, no point in issuing the challenges under their new system until then
---
It almost feels like they are intentionally letting NW die off.  I play with a lot of people that almost exclusively play Nuke Winter and with the lack of updates and mediocre attempt at bug fixes they seem happy to let it go away.  "let's just toss in more explosive weps" seems to be an option instead. And now those die-hard fans are just leaving for other games.
---
Would be a kick in the atoms though as i see more skins and outfits in nuke winter than i ever do in adv fallout.
---
I think it would be amazing to make the launch more instance-based from adv mode.  If you get bored in adv mode you can just head over to vault 51 to launch NW rather than having to back out and re-launch then sit in the lobby for 100 hours or however long it takes now.
---
I agree
---
The legendary run is over. No challenges till next Tuesday.
---
I didn’t have any machines in my camp since I recently moved. I also sell stuff VERY cheap cause caps really aren’t hard to come by and I was helped many times when I started off and now I pay it forward being 130+ level
---
Digging the sound of higher level worlds actually
---
Why not? And I'd have to take something out of the bundle but yeah that'd be my second option for that weapon
---
I think you're going to have to choose a tone at some point. Right now it's *mostly* semi-serious with some meta moments here and there. Which is fine, it's a choice. But having players non-RP REALLY makes that choice for you and could cross a creative line you might not be able to walk back over. I'd think pretty carefully about that. You COULD probably enlist some RP friendly friends/redditors to hop on your servers and do some takes. I'd be people would love the chance.
---
But still, don’t shoot people just cause they vend highly; take the high road
---
Nukacript.com go to that website for the nuke codes
---
There's no more daily/weekly challenges until season 2 starts
---
That’s the website I use but all the codes are crossed out
---
Will have to try this out. I am like level 35 i think. I had a 120something but created new character for wastelanders.
---
I am honored to have this wholesome and wonderful comment on one of my posts &lt;3
---
Makes sense. I was actually basing the freebie comment on gtao which I believe uses a peer to peer model rather than hosted servers
---
Agility makes you more tanky if you use dodgy. Perception helps you doubling damage because of the vats headshots. Luck increases damage because of the vats crits.
---
And thats just damage and defense. Int gives you more exp, charisma more caps, str more carryweight.
---
And you if you play melee, str adds directly to your damage.
---
*new years 2019 flashbacks intensify*
---
Get weaponsmith max and use it while you are using the Gatling laser
---
Nukacrypt
---
Would be better for the players, but worse for their sales numbers. They enforce an artificial scarcity due to time limits. You might not spend money on items because of this, but plenty of people do. Ultimately the atom shop is a business, and they wouldn’t do it without numbers/research to back up their sales model.
---
This is correct.
---
My bloodied handmade get's the same damage boost from nerd rage as it would from all 9 ranks of commando, it's weapon dependant how bad the nerf is but some perks are out performing others even on the worst effected weapons. Heavy guns appear to be the least effected so you'd probably still get mileage out of good rolled junkies. If you use power armor then there's no reason to run full health when you can have emergency protocols.
---
Eh I find tons of beta and day 1 players. I am one myself
---
I set up a camp on the pathway exiting vault 76, set up unlocked purifiers, tons of crops, built a huge sign that said free soup above a vending machine a blind man could see, made like 40 corn soups &amp; sat there pissed off for a good 10m when I realized I cant put soup in the vending machines.
---
For me it happens at random but only every now and then and not very often
---
My favorite post about Zorbo or the run.....thank you.
---
I should've mentioned that im in power armor, I love it too much to not use it and hoping emergency protocols makes things manageable.
---
It’s actually my fault - I should have known something was up. 10 server hops before I tried to launch one. Each server was dead and silent. Wasted a couple nuke cards trying to do it thinking I typed in the wrong number on accident
---
I've seen her a couple of times in the area sort of between The Generals Steakhouse and the Fissure site(the one closer to the glade) that is near there. 
---
The last time I saw her, she was close to the Primal Cuts location in The Mire.
---
Strength directly impacts your melee damage, so having those extra points definitely makes a difference
---
They changed some of the damage output calculations from mulitplicative to additive.
---
It more of a recalculation and adjustment than a nerf, but nerf is all that some understand.
---
Makes the power curve more linear and easier to calculate, which should help with rubberbanding and future power balancing.
---
The recalc affects all builds, but builds that utilized a ton of multipliers like bloodied will likely see the biggest hit, but still reign king.
---
Not going to happen. You're saving atoms for that spiffy suit that comes back who knows when, but this week they have an awesome camp bundle. So you decide wth, you'll have time to grind those atoms back. Well turns out next week that PA skin you can't live without is back in the shop... For 24 hours. So you do the math, buy the cheapest atom pack to cop the skin and question what you spend your money on after crafting it.
---
This is literally me waiting for the Playtime PA.
---
How much does it weigh? I hear a lot of good about it so I'll have to consider that. But I have bear arms so my heaviest big gun is the minigun I used at around 4 pounds lmao
---
Nobody knows what the hell they are talking about. The symbols are not the same. If the ‘wheel’ is turning to the right, it’s a swastika. If it’s turning to the left, it’s the Buddhist sign for good fortune.
---
Remember it this way: ‘lefty lucky, righty Reichy’. It’s best if you avoid the “good version” anyway, because the general public won’t know the difference.
---
An actual practicing Buddhist would know this.
---
Will give that a shot then, thanks.
---
Also, unless you want to use the excavator armor, craft it at the lowest level to save on screws and materials.
---
The issue I have is like today me and the wife were playing uranium fever just me and her, 3 quarters through the event someone else turns up and starts giving my wife angry emotes because she killing the mole miners, like oh I'm sorry your majesty we didn't realize it was you
---
Sure
---
For real.  I just wanna put a few Glowing meats &amp; Mutant hound meats in there for SBQ, Rad rumble etc etc. When I need that extra Bloody Powerfist buff.
---
Had no clue about that tbh. Awesome, thank you so much
---
They should require power and make food not spoil at all.
---
There was a level 35 guy standing in the murder pile area at line in the sand, when a level 100 joined that didn’t have pacifist mode on, the 35 took the opportunity to kill that guy a few times. Just judging from what I saw, this was a pvp character trying to force pvp on a regular server.
---
That’s actually decent
---
For everyone out there, when low level players join, most of us have no intent to share the loot. Some of ua just come for xp. Honestly, I would rather level up than get screws.
---
No I’m saying that even though it‘s legacy its still one of the most duped weapons, making it considerably less valuable, but still overpowered. It’s like someone using a hacked pipe pistol.
---
It’s to cover crap like Qanon, which started out as a farce, accidentally grew out of control with sincere members, and has now become a full-on delusional paranoia hate-group.
---
You can’t write fiction more absurd than reality right now.
---
ADD A HURDY GURDY, MTX, QUEST REWARD, WHATEVER .
---
^hurdy^
---
*GURDY*
---
I sell cooked meats all the time &amp; make most of the daily cap allowance from vendors.  SBQ or the Wolf horde event make mad caps.
---
What
---
Alright thanks for the input, I shouldve mentioned that I run a set of t-65 so combining that with emergency protocols and dodgy should make for a great combo.
---
Around Gad. The dry river/lake bed is pretty open and flat. I also think the road around the pumpkin house might be good--it's similarly flat and free of too much other stuff.
---
You mean on that submit a ticket website?If that then yes.Can i do that on my ps4 too then?
---
ya I wanted to try for total immersion in the meta...that being said, I do have plans to break the fourth wall on occasion, even if its just really subtle. 
---
For example, in an upcoming episode, when I'm chatting with the lady in Flatwoods and she's telling me about the responder mission boards, I say something like, "all their missions are on terminals? that sounds dull."   
---
I may get less subtle in the future. Its all spur of the moment since I don't script it out in advance.
---
it only adds 5 more procs of dodgy. if you're sneaking, then it doesn't really make a difference. and if you're not, then this is what happens: https://streamable.com/svtgyn
---
the only case I've seen perception truly help is with pistols, which perform terribly as it is. for everything else, your weapon's range is much more important than per. and if headshots are your point, then concentrated fire more or less renders it moot.
---
the breakpoints for luck are 15 and 33, it makes no difference otherwise. unless you have a 15% vats weapon, but then you don't really need unyielding anyway.
---
and the passive bonuses from int, cha and str are hardly game-breakingly op in my opinion.
---
Adds damage if you're a melee build. I had a half assed build with 15 base strength and an unyielding monster. 3 hits if the queen was on the ground.
---
Craft gattling lasers instead of straight up making cores.  Each gun you make comes with a core and uses common resources, at least I've been told but I've never tried it to confirm.
---
Or just attend line in the sand. 2 full cores as a reward every time you complete it and it pops up pretty often.
---
Enforcer seems to be working again for me. Still can't cripple anything on the Queen, but Earls heads get crippled almost immediately now.
---
Do you need a participation* hug?
---
Gatling Lasers have lower durability than ballistic weapons. Once you get used to it it's not that bad. I use them as my main weapons.
---
I only buy discounted stuff now.  The betrayal I felt when the bungalow went half price....
---
I usually just do the Spruce Knob Lake since it's so close to Foundation.  That's not the point though, I hate spending the ammo to kill it and would rather be able to put the 2nd Queen meat in the fridge for the next day.
---
You can still purchase without power. All turning off power does is removes the trader camp icon on map.
---
Wow, great point. 🙄
---
The game should explain how the game works. You shouldn't need to hunt around like that to find out information that the game should overtly articulate to the player.
---
&gt;halfway, half-assed effort 
---
Would that be quarter-assed?
---
Yeah but imagine someone in power armour doing it
---
Ok thanx
---
I did that i use it for the 50 cal setup as well.
---
The part that really raises my hackles is when an object is green but you still can't place it.
---
Wolf Horde is my jam. Three legendaries for almost no effort, though most of them are crap level 15s, and tons of meat to cook &amp; sell.
---
Once we get into the next patch, it'll be harder if the wolves scale... but it also means the Legendaries they drop will scale with level, making them more likely to be useful.
---
Crap! i thought you meant at some point. Logging in now...
---
I got a plasma caster out of crafting it. Just keep trying. Wish these was tradable
---
Ignore these paranoid delusional “commie menace” conspiracy theorists.
---
They want to cover homonyms because of the assholes that use them for vulgar reasons, like “PlowLittleGirls”. When they get banned, they could say “wHaT dId I sAy? i’M jUsT tElliNG liTtlE GiRls tO gO pLoW. YoU kNoW, liKe iN a FieLd.” I report clowns like that constantly.
---
Fuck them. But no, it’s an ‘elaborate conspiracy with the Chinese’. Jesus Christ, people.
---
Absurd sure. But whipping someone with a fishing rod hurts like hell. It's a video game. Adding a little bit of fun never really hurt anyone. "Legitimately usable as weapons" sir they are not. It's junk in the game. Thanks anywho. Good scrap instead.
---
The game explains how the game works, and people still miss the information. (speaking of other instances, not this exact one)
---
They do burn through durability very fast I have a Two Shot Limb damage gat laser that burns durability
---
NMA is not right-wing as far as I know. They just hate absolutely every Fallout game outside of the classics and absolutely bash anyone who disagrees. The community there is pretty toxic and they get on cyclical arguments with clearly baiting trolls over which Fallout is better. Frankly, I've seen some of the regulars there claim Fallout 1 is the only good Fallout and all others are shit, so they're pretty irrational when it comes to the series.
---
On another topic entirely, I'm also making something like Lost Hills! But it won't be exactly like it. Thinking of placing it somewhere near Atlas and make it some form of Brotherhood FOB.
---
Thanks for the answer =] that's exactly what I wanted to know.
---
I got 2 BFFRs over the course of 1-2 months while trying to roll a JFFR, ended up scripping them both because I hate bloodied. I gave up after rolling a J5025 and haven’t tried since
---
Just sell on the trading sub.
---
There are no daily challenges right now.
---
I got one
---
All % Damage Reduction is done after DR. Unless there's some math shenanigans behind the scenes it's been tested quite a lot.
---
And yes until you have enough DR to bring damage taken down to minimum value (1%) there are no true diminishing returns.
---
What people are referring to as "diminishing returns" is "diminishing effectiveness". 20% more damage reduction is great, but when that 20% damage reduction brings 5 down to 4 when you have 400+ health it's not as effective as the initial 20% which brings 100 down to 80.
---
DR could be more effective in One Wasteland with levels for everything going up to 100.
---
I have a bloodied one.
---
laying it on thick here.
---
TIL that my little backpack can be recrafted for a better version. Thank you.
---
I’m a little lost. You need a Bethesda account which you create on their website. You then link your psn to that account but you have to actually create a Bethesda account. I mean I guess you could on your PlayStation in the web browser. The ticket submission is done through Bethesda not PlayStation. And having a psn and the game does not mean you have a Bethesda account. Sorry if I’m misdunderstanding.
---
I'm glad it doesn't. When it was working, people were running around with tubes one-shotting.
---
Don’t know exactly where to find them but I know they came out of those presents that got mass d*ped a while back, if someone hoarded some of the plans you should be able to find some fairly cheap
---
&gt; NMA is not right-wing as far as I know. 
---
that's what i thought but when you got someone screaming at you over a mic that NMA is a right wing group you kinda either have to agree or get attacked for "being a alt right supporter"
---
I get what he's trying to do but be polite about it when it's clear that other players aren't willing to participate move on.  Or go claim a workshop I find the PVP at workshop claimings to be quite fun.  Sometimes I'll claim a taken workshop just for the PVP that will inevitably occur.  But as far as trying to trick people into PVP no one is going to appreciate a game mode they weren't trying to play.
---
So how do you get 33 luck without unyielding? Concentrated fire is great because of the 20% bug but not on your first shot. And why should per work for pistols and not for rifles?
---
Craft a gatling laser. Should have a full fresh fusion core for the materials that it takes to make the gatling laser
---
Bethesda has had over 2 years with this game and they have limped it by not addressing this issue. So you get capped out but have a lot to sell so I need to ask someone to transfer caps to another character is silly. 2 years people who risk trading items because Bethesda can’t make it a both party agree to trade feature. They add new stuff to put in our camps but we have very little camp budget. Add how stupid it is to have displays like comic books that eat big chunks of the build budget. So many bad, lazy and stupid things about this game but I still play it because I love fallout. I thought destiny 2 was the worse game to screw there community over but Bethesda took that mantle. Retodd Howard thank you.
---
If your house is burning down or you’re evacuating for a hurricane, the last thing that should be on your mind is “damn I missed that collectron”
---
There will always be disasters happening someplace in the world. People will always be starting work or school somewhere, there will always be riots somewhere. None of that adds to the point. It’s not a big deal they didn’t claim something that was just a reskin of another item. 3 days is plenty of time for a player who has enough time to at least have donated once. If you didn’t donate at least once, then don’t complain you didn’t get it.
---
I ran one yesterday, twice I wasted a key code with the wrong launch code so I searched and found these codes. I can’t speak to alpha and bravo, but the code for site Charlie works. Seems there is a bug somewhere.
---
Alpha - 34959739 
---
Bravo - 33701503 
---
Charlie - 98469385
---
“obviously anyone with a legacy weapon isn't going to trade it”
---
Really? I thought the #1 rule with legacies is that they are strictly trade-only. Selling them for caps seems kinda impractical.
---
Well I guess this is why- [Link](https://bethesda.net/community/category/299/nuclear-winter-pc-support?language%5B%5D=en)
---
Every other post is someone complaining about the hackers.
---
I completely agree. Its a dangerous gamble. I thnk you're right that having some RP friendly people would be better than random players.
---
I actually did my initial recording of episode 1 on a public server and someone came up in the middle of my dialogue with the settlers and started shooting me until I paid attention to him. I had to reshoot the whole thing on private.
---
I assume that was the intent it just seems like kind of a rude way to do it.  Workshops are pretty much made for this sort of gameplay.  go contest a popular workshop I can guarantee there will be some PVP based on that.  I generally don't like PVP but when I'm in the mood for it a good workshop battle back and forth is a great deal of fun especially since both participants are enjoying it.
---
I played a game of cat and mouse over a workshop for about 2 hours with a guy of a similar level and it was a great deal of fun for both of us.  Neither one of us kept any junk on us so we didn't really lose anything when we died but some of the creative ways we found to claim the workshop and then to hide were quite fun.

I havent donated a single thing and ive still gotten all of the rewards

Go back to the nuke zone after like 15-20 minutes, they will respawn, or next time clear the area then do the silo for 15 minutes and they will respawn shortly after the nuke.
---
Dr. Broomstick did a video like that
---
Unyielding:
---
More Carry-weight and Melee damage,
---
Better VATS accuracy,
---
Better Vendor prices,
---
+30% increased xp gain,
---
More AP and harder to detect while sneaking,
---
+22.5% flat increased Crit meter gain per hit
---
Yeah. I personally just avoid pvp as it isn't fun to me
---
I had my camp out at the Aaronholt farm for a bit just behind the shed that spawns a suit of PA, and that was a pretty good source of cores. Not that I needed them, but... There are also generators at the 3 public events related to the prison, where both locations have a generator and a PA spawn location so two cores for potentially free. I think Scrounger can also rarely spawn them in ammo containers, I've found up to 4 at times.
---
The power plant workshop is probably just the best though if you want sheer quantity.
---
Yeah that is true, but that’s why they need to nerf the tube. The gauss Shotgun needs a nerf as well. Both them can easily two shot without adrenaline. Adrenaline is the only thing that can help commando builds take down teams that run gauss Shotgun/tube.
---
I want robots in our camps. I mean if the wayward can have both a sentry bot and assaultron then we can have bots. Think about it, 76 housed the best and brightest, surely some of us worked at RobCo and know how to maintain the bots and where they stashed the schematics. I’m fine with it using Camp budget as long as they increase the budget or make it reasonable.

Fireworks Glitch is Fixed in Update 22 so. Enter use it while you can;)

People should lock their shit but they also shouldn’t complain when I come along and lock pick it
---
If people are poaching the legendary from outside (usually on the roof) others may turn the juke box off and stop playing, this causes the event to stop progressing (at least it has every time I’ve done it). The aim is to get the poacher to come off the roof, the risk is the event fails if it times out.
---
It seems petty but why waste ammo, stims etc so someone else can take all the legendary enemies? The event can’t progress without someone maintaining the juke box or playing instruments, you can’t do that from the roof. 
---
This is why I said it feels like working for a manager; we do all the grunt work &amp; they take all the bonuses.
---
I’ll sound like a dick, but there’s always shit happening. This is also super American oriented. Never seen ‘dear bethesda’ requests for refugees fleeing bombs or genocide. Almost always Americans whining about free shit and pretending like their problems deserve everything to change and make it better.
---
There’s always bad shit happening in the world that will impact someone’s ability to participate in a limited time event. 
---
But I’m guessing none of those issues you brought up were affecting you. That you’re just using them to deflect from the reason you didn’t get them. You forgot or didn’t bother to check the details. Because I bet you wouldn’t be on here bitching about missing a collectron if you were losing everything.
---
Do the main quest, it will explain it all. Those codes are useless though, not only because they're tedious to actually use but also because they expire weekly so by time you do the main quest to that point they'll likely be expired.
---
Scrap kits are the shit. They’ve saved me at least 5 times from having to drop stuff or run to the nearest stash box
---
The second caster I made was Bloodied 25/25
---
I stopped once I landed a Q3390 figured I wasn't going to get better.  Oh a bloodied would be nice for sure but man I love me some quads.

I knew it.  That makes slick a raider. raiders can spawn as legendary, sellers cannot.

"oh my god, 55 weapons :D" - 55 pipe weapons level 1
---
Lol y'all really thought the BoS would give us technology? This is unintentionally lore friendly
---
you don't. but the other side of the coin is that you can't achieve a 1:1 cycle without unyielding. so nerf or don't nerf it, some mechanics need to be tweaked regardless.
---
with or without a fixed concentrated fire you're probably not hitting that first head shot anyway. I miss half of them. so you might as well just aim for the torso.
---
per does matter for rifles, but their range alone is enough to make them effective with vats. the unyielding bonus is just that, a bonus. kinda like 33%. pistols on the other hand absolutely suck without unyielding, so let's put it this way: if you nerfed unyielding, rifles would barely notice the difference while pistols would become even more unusable.
---
We have a day which literal translation would be "Fat Thursday" in February, which is mostly about Pączki indeed, but it's just Pączki, no Faschnat

I don’t think it does anything different than the base version if it makes you feel better.  Just different dialogue
---
Wait, what kinds of ammo?

on pc or xbox because im on rn and everything's still full price

I didn't donate one scrap and got everything

I heavily doubt this actually happened. Most people have no idea what NMA even is.

Are you kidding? Have you ever spent a few moments in the "lobby" of Radiation Rumble waiting for players to show up? 4+ NPCs spouting the same 3 lines over and over.

Well they already broke midgame a few weeks ago, now endgame, next you won't be able to leave the vault (or did they break that once too already?).

Must be working for some people on PC, I still saw new nuke zones as of this morning. People on chat are saying some severs work, others don't.

I run ricochet with EP and dodgy, it adds an 18% chance to avoid projectile damage, this includes the scorchbeast scream rings and the instant damage part of earls poison spit.

Power plants have a item you can power that pumps them out like candy.

Hey everyone! We've isolated the problem with the nuke codes and are pushing a fix out. They will be resolved soon.
---
i just checked on an example (short assault rifle) with and without scrapper perk and the results I got are as follows [https://i.imgur.com/cyEEPLw.png](https://i.imgur.com/cyEEPLw.png) they don't seem consistent in what's in the file, any idea why?  
---
the only idea i can think of is that this formula does not multiply the total steel but some extra value of steel, besides like a default amount
---
don't blame you for doubting it, but a one in a million encounter is still a one in a million encounter if i had it recorded i would show you but i don't so i won't act like your stupid for saying it didn't happen
---
I know posts aren't showing right now but I've already addressed all of that in response to other users.
---
except for the sneak bit, and in regards to that you should know a full chameleon set makes you stealthier.

I live in the San Francisco bay area too while you look for tha Queen i'll look for earl
---
It'd also be nice to be able to do a wider range of ammo conversions. You should be able to turn 5.56 into Ultracite 5.56 instead of having to craft Ultracite ammo completely from scratch.
---
She gave me 4 nocturnals, 2 assassins and 2 quads the other day, all weapons were plasma rifles/missile launchers and various pipes. I more or less payed her for the contents of her trash can In guessing. We have not been on speaking terms since.
---
Yay! Now to go solve em!
---
Will this be a hotfix or a patch?
---
Ill play in hour &amp; check my Main. If i have plan ill give it to U too

Hey there! They found the issue and are working on a fix now. This should be resolved soon.
---
I see your point, but in my situation it was me and my friend who started the event [edit: and we were both in the room, sharing ghoul kills]. A minute in, the first random joins, turns the jukebox off and walks to the door where the enemies come through. My friend turned the jukebox back on and received a thumbs down from the random. Another minute in, two more joined. One of them turned the jukebox off. We turned it back on and received another thumbs down. We experienced that scenario in multiple events. To me it never appeared as one turned it off because someone was only taking the legendary kills. It's so odd in my eyes.
---
That's why I asked. I only mentioned Fasnacht as it's the only ingame source of doughnuts.
---
Ok good to know ! Thanks all
---
Really !?
---
You're whole post probably just means you didn't even contribute to that challenge and you are adking to receive the reward ?
---
I don't wanna be rude, but i really really wanted to get all the legendary run rewards, but i came back on the game 2 weeks ago...
---
I'm just trying to show you here the value of your comment. I'm sorry if you put alot of heart into it, but it means absolutly nothing. You gotta be there when you gotta be there.
---
I have the game since beta...but i bought all the Fasnacht and Chrismas plans i could buy. Do you see where i'm going with this ?

 &gt; Hey there! They found the issue and are working on a fix now. This should be resolved soon.

Easy one is to give all your missiles to a low level.
---
It won't require any downtime thankfully!
---
If you're well set up right now, I'd hold off and see how it feels next week. Blocker is a good choice for the new daily ops.
---
Gave up on pistol build as once you get into the higher levels you’re really handicapped by ammo per reload and damage done. 
---
I’d have to use a drink, a bobble head, chems, and whatever else I could find to do decent damage. 
---
I found that mostly, only exploding pistols were worth the effort. So I gave up.
---
This is r/fo76 I think you meant to post on r/libertarian
---
So awesome!
---
There are other glitches that allow a certain degree of player permeability. One uses power armor, another uses photo mode, some work better on some doors than others, etc.
---
It gives you +25% xp. Four lunchboxes = 100%xp or double xp.
---
Scrap all scrap everyone and everything 😁 Scrap is life, scrap is love.

Awesome! Thanks for the quick reply.

*gets blasted by a lvl 6,082 player*

There’s tons glitches that can be used to get through walls, they probably used one you’ve never heard of before
---
What..
---
I already commented on Bethesda Forum ;)
---
Take a ton of chems, you’ll thin out real quick
---
Those are real? OMG man very cool.
---
I’m not sure how old but I’m sure they did the photo mode glitch to walk threw your door
---
try search or google?
---
question has been asked and answered dozen of times
---
Thank you, so its my bad RNG not my plans.
---
Sometimes you can enter locked structures before the game loads them completely. Happens to me quite often. If that happened with people who had just fast traveled to your Camp, then this could be the reason.
---
Only time I ever hit someone is to grab their attention when I want to drop something for them. I always dread it when it becomes pvp.
---
Basically running junkies or bloodied with sneak is the only way to make pistol build viable. Pistols can be useful as a side weapon used for clean-up duty on lower leveled enemies. I have a strength based shotgun/heavy weapon build that dabbles in pistols and my junkies gauss pistol can be useful at times but I would not want to use it full time.
---
On the other hand, I also have a bloodied sneak commando and I picked up a bloodied pipe pistol and decided to test it out with the Guerilla perks since I had a bunch of level ups saved. It clears Huntersville and Westek pretty easily using sneak and is a good way to dispose of .38 ammo. I probably would not use it for the big boss fights unless I was solo and could remain in sneak.
---
The nuke code system is bugged right now. But normally, yes, slow and steady wins the race (just bring enough ammo)
---
If your locked door is close to the fast travel point, people can just run in before the camp objects have a chance to load. More stuff you have, more time it takes them to load.
---
Other way is to use power armor animation to glitch through any door.
---
Thank you! I said this in some other post and got  downvoted to hell, I thought I was crazy for a sec
---
Ok i feel better knowing its a thing
---
They'll probably put it in the store when the BoS finally show up. Might cost atoms tho.
---
Nothing to do with your post just a level 29 struggling to maintain ammunition, idk if I post this question it would get taken down so I'll ask here! Any tips besides tinker making bullets, and the bullet changer machine!
---
That makes sense. Thanks
---
depends what area of the map you want to be in, and how far away you want it to remain flat.
---
toxic valley as a whole is relatively flat.
---
there's an open field between the Overseers house and the Wayward.
---
Another around the big farm as you are headed N to deathclaw island.
---
northish of the farm across the street from the lumber mill near v76.
---
Lots of flat space between Generals steak house and Watogo, but that has its own set of hazards.
---
In the riverbed between Gorge bridge and Flatwoods.
---
Both North and East of Gorge junkyard.
---
Between the bottom of the ski lift (top of the world) and bolton greens.
---
NW of bolton greens, but before Morgantown.
---
several hilltops or small valleys in the Forest are relatively free of trees
---
A lot of the websites that make lists of alt-right websites will throw any website on there that gets flagged by their keyword search, and some of the keywords they use aren't even related to racism. Some of them consider sites where members deny climate change to be alt-right.
---
If you're looking to be competitive, then no, they absolutely aren't worth it. For casual play, though, they're pretty fun. I've got a pistol guy; it's a neat way to mix things up. That said, the only real trick I know of is that pipe revolvers can benefit from both pistol and rifle perks, though I'm not sure if that combo stacks up to a nicely-modified western revolver.
---
A standard one is only about six pounds, but I've grabbed modded ones that weight like 2.5 or something like that, that might also be with perks, I don't think so though.
---
They can't or people will cry p2w
---
Earle good for xp farming. I’ll drop him down to a few shots and farm all the wendigos for the rest of the time. It’s been time I was farming so much that I almost forgot to kill Earle. The wendigos, screws, extra ammo, and event prizes are the reasons I do the even. And when I run with other people, that’s what I usually do. Let them have fun with Earle as I mow down the wendigos. When time gets far down, then I’ll kill him for everyone. Plus, I hate wasting bullets on him. One to 2 shots on a wendigo yields around 5 or more bullets back and screws galore. Great investments.
---
Claim a power plant workshop, then, if it's not already done, power up the plant. Outside in the plants workshop there will be a fusion core generator (looks like a regular resource extractor). They're already hooked up to the plants power output by default (although you need to do the "powering up [plant name]" event to provide enough power), but it's always bugged so you'll have to disconnect the wire then reattach it. It will pump them out slowly and it will store a maximum of 3. All the fusion cores it makes will be 100% charged.
---
We’re* visiting your* grandma
---
Dude...
---
It happens all the fucking time and usually during an event.
---
The Responder fire outfit is a very rare drop from Forest/Responders events. As for camp location I put my firefighter between Mount Blair and Abandoned Mine Shaft 5 as there's a broke down fire appliance there.
---
*Adds it in as part of a 5800 atom bundle full of other stuff no one wants*
---
I liked the part where they will ban you for forcing other people into role play situations against their will. 
---
Also that they specifically mention that we can't discuss bugs in the game, or make reference to any zenimax employees. (Those Todd memes must be chafing)
---
Damaged mainframe cores...  
---
Bane of my existence.
---
There was a wild Appalachia unique heavy super sledge. The heavy mod only existed on that weapon and can not be put back on if removed.
---
You get the outfit from the quests, but you can also find one in a display case in the Overseer’s house. A well-placed grenade can shake it out of the case for you to retrieve. Haven’t tried it myself, but my buddy got one for me with this method. Doesn’t have the helmet, but the regular firefighter helmet still looks pretty cool with it, and you can find those around.
---
Ditto. Icing on the don’t come back for a year or so cupcake.
---
I don’t understand, I wasted two keycards using what should have been the right code, went and found another code and it worked fine.
---
All i want is a god damn key ring.
---
I suppose you could get the bait to not activate when in radius of a CAMP, preventing the spacing of an animal.
---
I was under the impression that when a vendor does this is because they want trade offers, not caps
---
As has been pointed out already, nukes are a bit wonky right now so better wait until it's fixed.
---
That being said:
---
Solo is the best way as that's basically easy mode. Out of the 12 nukes I've launched yesterday (I had 15 keycards in my stash and they aren't exactly lightweight) the max I had during the final phase were 10 bots. A bit boring but once you're a high enough level dropping nukes for sport is the real endgame. XD
---
Go stealth or with a set of troubleshooter armor and you're pretty much set. Nothing is stopping you from going loud but I wouldn't suggest that for a first run.
---
Be warned, though. Some people tend to get a bit impatient if they see someone entering a silo with no nuke leaving it max 30 minutes later, so you might at some point get a visit to help you get it done.
---
That doesn't happen very often since there are 3 silos on the map but if the other 2 are in cooldown mode it's a possibility.
---
Basically, if you have FO1st or a friend with it, do it on a private world.
---
And don't forget the nuke card. Nothing is more frustrating then making it through only to find out that you left the nuke card back at camp. :D
---
That's the thing though, damage reduction has increasing effectiveness. If you're at 0% damage reduction and bring yourself up to 20% damage reduction, your effective health multiplier goes from 1 to 1.25, or a 25% increase in how long you will live getting shot by a given weapon. If you're at 60% damage reduction and increase it to 80% damage reduction, your EHM goes from 2.5 to 5, or a 100% increase in how long you'll live. Against trash mobs its true, it doesn't matter, but those tend to be dead before they can deal any damage anyway. When it comes to armor I care more about things like pairs of glowing yao guais, hordes of level 62 ghouls, and tanking Earl with my shotgunner, and there the additional DR makes a very noticeable difference in how many stims you end up using. The approximate EHM for normal armor against a 250 damage attack is only around 2, so every bit helps.
---
As for power armor, the wording on the wiki about how power armor works is really bad, so I could definitely have it wrong:
---
&gt; The damage the player takes is reduced by a flat 7% per piece on the frame, while the radiation damage reduced by 15% per piece, so a full set reduces damage by 42% and incoming radiation by 90%. Damage and radiation resistance provided by each piece is then applied to the remaining amount, making power armor the *best* protection against direct damage bar none. 
---
If you have any links to actual testing numbers it would be great.
---
You actually expect Bethesda to give you something because you bought the game and played every single day for the past few months?
---
Hahaha. No, slave. You shall log in EVERY. DAY. You do not get breaks. You do not get to decide when you play. You shall do as Bethesda orders you, or you will not get shiny new stuff.
---
Now get back in the fucking mines.
---
What's the plan?
---
My wife and I launched nukes from 8p-10pm solid last night
---
I had a camp behind Foundation for a while. Somewhere between Spruce Knob Lake and Spruce Knob Channels. Upstream from the behemoth spawn. Upside: Abundant water, can run to Foundation, middle of map for best fast travel budget. Downside: high-level mobs will attack your camp and destroy it, few resource nodes.
---
I'll have to look at the esm later when I get home and see if I can spot anything like that.
---
Most of them come from the savage divide and CB area. Always open those lvl 3 lockpicks.
---
I wholeheartedly agree. It’s built into the game because that’s how the game is meant to be played. Well said.
---
I’m lvl 53 but can’t seem to pass this by myself. Willing to offer caps for anyone who can help after it’s finished. Just trying to get it knocked out.
---
Name on Bethesda is BlxckTxpes. 
---
A group is welcome as well. Just want someone who can help me finish this. 👍
---
Thanks again! Hit me up to go hunting if you don't mind a low level squishy running with you.
---
I’m in Long Beach. I’m gonna kill your rhagstad
---
What level can you start doing those?
---
imho, fridge should be 95% reduction, just enough to be noticably better than perks, and then they should have a freezer, which eliminates spoilage entirely.
---
Yup. Guess a search would have told you that.
---
Got one after 10 modules. 
---
Keep going you will get it.

Pumpkin house festival in October (2021)

Because its fun. This is an online game with no win condition. Most players have done every quest, have 95% of all plans, and finished legendary run. All thats left is measing around witb other players. Trap  camps are an intended mechanic in the fame

According to journalists all the fans think the refrigerator is already too good and it's pay to win that makes Bethesda look evil for breaking their no pay to win promise.
---
Also Trump hates the military and thinks war dead are suckers.  - Journalists
---
That seems cruel 😂 they will just put them in their vendors for 25 caps each and never understand why they don't make any caps and have no room in their stash
---
Sounds cool but man were the Firebreathers a let down in the game. They built up this faction as an offshoot of the Responders which reminded me greatly of the NCR and the Desert Rangers. I know it's a stretch but I see it. I wish there was more to them...or at least more you could do rather just joining them and then that's it.
---
On PC two days ago at Line in the Sand. Someone did the tent exploit and I couldn't get near the meat piles without my whole screen lagging like crazy. It was impossible to pick anything up.
---
Last time I got a troubleshooters switchblade, reduced weight and +agility. Threw it right back at her.
---
My opinion on your changes...
---
1- the ability to transfer between characters, if implemented, should be for anyone and not just FO 1st members (yes I am a 1st member) and should be limited to 1-5 items per 24hrs or 7 days to prevent duper’s from taking advantage of the idea. 
---
2- not sure about this one as it could just encourage duper’s to trade items easier. Which leads to #3 
---
3- I would like the idea of a board that could be used to highlight things for sale or things people are looking for. It would also be nice if this incorporated the idea of a mailbox too so a player could leave a message for said seller and vice versa. 
---
4- I would want to see how the new leveling turns out before changing the world. Also, I keep a few lower damage weapons around for when I am just chilling and don’t want to kill things so easy. Novel concept for some, but an easy work around if you find the game becoming too easy and there are lots of weapons that do less damage.
---
Its also really good for steel after 4ish runs i got 1004 steel
---
Marine tactical helmet.....sells for like 25-30 caps each and takes like 1 glass 2 rubber 2 plastic.......

She gave me a Bloodied Fixer as my first legendary Fixer after buying &amp; learning the plans just a couple of weeks ago. Honestly, I don't care what garbage she ends up giving me for at least another month.
---
I am through game pass
---
Thanks might try it out, what type of mobs?
---
I use a pipe rifle/pistol build, I saw the OPs post and I don't even play bloodied!
---
Sure are a lot of people that don't play the game yet complain about it every single day still...
---
By fishing poles I meant the pole hook, It was a misunderstanding on my part as I thought you were referring to the pole hook when you said the fishing pole is already in the game. That was what I was referring to as a legitimate weapon.
---
Is there any benefit to locking your doors? I leave all my doors unlocked. I like having people check out my camp, inside and out.
---
Honestly, when I see a camp with locked doors, I will actively try everything to get inside. No malicious intent, I just want to see what’s so so special.
---
Unless they change something between now and then, next week's balance pass will totally wreck Gunslinger.  My Gunslinger struggles on the PTS, and she *is* Bloodied Sneak.  Her only saving grace is having a Bloodied Western Revolver that crits every-other-hit and has a +50% crit damage perk.  That, combined with Adrenaline and Tank Killer now applying to Pistols, allows her to hold her own in tougher areas.  But only just.  Like, if I have to rely on the 10mm or Pipe Pistol, it's just not feasible.  It takes a whole magazine of the 10mm to destroy a single Laser Turret in the silos.  And the Western Revolver is an unsilenced gun, so it's very much kill-or-be-killed with it.
---
One thing I definitely *wouldn't* recommend is taking all the Gunslinger perks.  Taking one of each - Normal, Expert, and Master - gives you 30% damage.  But the 9-for-60% tradeoff won't be worth it in the rebalance.  I'd also invest into Adrenaline and Critical Hits.

It's really my own stubbornness that prevents me from making her a Commando like the other two, which is *easy mode* in the rebalance.  I want to make this work, but the rebalance fights me every step of the way.
---
Wasted 5 cards today on different servers for Bravo ( Alpha/Charlie worked for me ). Hope the fix is fast...
---
I don't know about you but in my own very realistic real life fridge IRL, a lot of the food lasts for weeks, some of it months!
---
You know you probably could have just started a thread politely asking them to return it to the shop and eventually get if not the same response a more gracious one.  Not everything needs to be passive aggressive.
---
Launching nukes is currently bugged on some servers so you're better off waiting until it's fixed.
---
Also, keep your caps. Your best option is to team up with a bunch of high levels and ask them if they want to help you. None of us need caps and it's always fun helping the little ones run their first silo.
---
In game Myrddyn1984 , I can help you...
---
I‘m using a b3325 fixer, raider underarmor and a full unyielding set and I always vats aim for the heads and my first headshots hit. Always. The vats bugs dont make em count sometimes, but they hit. And if they count its +100% dmg.
---
If i wouldnt use unyielding or 33 they wouldn’t hit and id have to aim for bodies.
---
Right and since I don't care about being competitive I should be fine. Like I said, I don't have to be the guy doing the most damage. Just kinda wanna do my part of the damage. I definitely prefer the western revolver to any of the other pistols. I just wish there were more options.
---
I will help for free.  But I would hold off until they fix the nuke codes.
---
i allways just accepted the fact of diminishing returns but never bothered to really look into it,
---
having a clue about how the equation works is nice, even though ill need to take my time and read through it one or two times more before i really get whats going on 
---
anyways, nice post and interesting topic.
---
thanks for taking your time to clarify this 👍🏼
---
I feel like my idea of a grand slam would be Nuking Queen, then Nuking Earle, Finally (even though its unnecessary) Doing the Encryptid in a Nukezone; and doing it quickly enough to keep all 3 Nukezones active in the map.
---
For me, this is the true "Grand Slam"
---
1) Earle
---
2) Earle / Queen
---
3) Earle / Queen
---
4) Radiation Rumble
---
5) Riding Shotgun
---
6) Encryptid
---
7) Project Paradise (optional)
---
Not necessarily in that order, but that would pretty much tap out a server.
---
I'm a explosive build so I also use Fat mans and that is probably the best way to take out the wendigos in there 🤣
---
If bloodied a .38 auto receiver is the bees knees.
---
Not sure, but Mods have confirmed they found the problem &amp; are working on a fix.
---
I live in Egypt too. I tried logging in and i can't. I haven't tried vpn though. I'll try it but honestly i didn't like the game. it was boring and bland same as fallout 4. I wish they remastered 3 or new vegas instead.
---
PS4 player here, level 2xx (not masking, just don't remember). My wife also plays, and she's 17x. We've never encountered this, and I don't remember reading this bug on this subreddit. This honestly sounds more like something with your controller. Have you not seen any other oddities like this when playing other games?
---
One run of line in the sand can get you over 1200 steel.
---
Ok thx for the information.
---
LadyDevann confirmed that they have found the problem &amp; are working on a fix.
---
Oh god dammit. Hopefully a few days then.
---
Yeah honestly it should be a freezer and last indefinitely. You should also be able to list items in your vendor that are stored.
---
https://np.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ipjtk1/nuke_codes_still_not_working/g4kiarr
---
But what about freezer burn???
---
Manufactured scarcity at work...
---
Ug just wasted 3 nuke cards putting in the various recommends here for Charlie on xbox
---
For real though. And that is the only other argument that makes even remote sense with defending the way fridges and freezers work in game. A whole ghoul child can remain in a fridge sized shelter for a few hundred years, but my mutt chops I made 40 minutes ago are about to spoil in the fridge😅
---
Yes. Set out to craft 5mm. Best choice, 200 bullets per hour, container fills up in five hours.
---
Or set to 556. 200 per hour, but you will need to empty it every hour as bullets are five time as heavy.
---
I must be doing something wrong then, because I have the same handmade and still missed half the head shots I took. ended up switching and just aiming for the torso because the end result was the same.
---
Nope, just this one. I'm playing two other games and we've had no problems. Doesn't mean it's not starting to go, troubles have to start somewhere. I have a back up and I will start using it and see. Might need cleaning.
---
you can do this anytime though. and you have the time to line up headshots and stuff.
---
I read this as "Turbo-Fart," and immediately wanted one. Sad to re-read it and see it's not nearly as fun. 😂
---
I'd prefer a boba fett style backpack/jetpack/missile launcher.
---
I’ve found her a couple times on the road up the hill from the white church in Helvetia.
---
That sounds great. I will keep an eye out for that plan.
---
C-CAN YOU HEAR THAT MUSIC
---
I am definitely getting more in the swing of things. It’s just a learning curve. 
---
One thing I just can’t figure out - I bought my first thing from the Atomic Shop - the Vault-Tec Clock (like a little house) and I see I spent the money but I can’t find it ANYWHERE in my things I can build. Any idea what could have happened?  https://i.imgur.com/ob7TzSS.jpg
---
They've been messed up since the code reset yesterday. It had nothing to do with the shop update. Also they are aware and a fix should happen soon.
---
Thanks.  As that post was downvoted it didn't show up.
---
I just want to boil water at the brewing station.
---
Yep, they do
---
Edit: as in, rifle and pistol cards do stack on pipe guns
---
According to the original video about the game...the intent was to build a community. It showed people placing camps together and bonding to fight off scorched and enemies,etc. 
---
It was not portrayed as a game to hunt down and kill fellow vault dwellers. So while it is the wasteland...coming together is important.
---
I almost never get those when I’m playing my low level junkie alt but it’s hilarious when it does happen.
---
I shouldve put an or, that's my bad. What I was saying is that using ultra light is good for storing armor if you want to have multiple sets.
---
i got the similar variant but in a LMG
---
bloodied 
---
explosive
---
250 dr while aiming
---
Hahaha. A purple water purifier skin, a chally lamp and some cool spikes for your shovel.
---
Yesterday is the atomic shop update as well...happens the same time
---
Good on you. But keep in mind the wendigo mobs drop ammo as well. It might not be the case for other low levels but when I was starting out having the right ammo and enough of it was a precious thing.
---
I honestly am faster w/o power armor. Not everyone will be quite the same though- depends on build/perks/etc
---
Yeah! I've got an instigating one and I've gotten up to 2400 damage in a single shot! And I'm not really trying.
---
Also heard glow sight might not be working.
---
Yes I completely agree but measured, always in contrast with the stark reality of the desolated wasteland. Not in your face all the time. I believe it's what gives you that feeling of nostalgia when you think back on older fallout games. Now there is no more contrast just animates popups combined with mobilegaming reward sounds.
---
One complaint people had about Fallout 2 is that is was too silly. Obsidian learned from that, that's why in FNV you could choose wild wasteland.
---
Nooooooooooo
---
Ah ok cool!  Gonna be a bit before I can purchase them anyways due to the bullion cap so I prob won’t even create the armor yet LOL
---
The Cranberry Bog basically has no inclines, but you have to deal with an assload of trenches everywhere.
---
I'm pretty sure I have spares.....ill check tonight if you dont wanna take the other guy up on his offer....its a semi rare plan.
---
If it makes you feel any better, the new BoS collectron is not all it’s cracked duo to be. The new loot option produces much less scrap than the baseline normal atom shop scrap collectron. I mean a lot less. Everyone I speak to who has both agrees. They deliberately made it produce less to twist everyone’s arm into buying a real one. 
---
I really wish they either a) just let everyone have a normal scrap bot or B) make the bot actually hunt for something new we need (like ammo)...but went with the most evil and greedy option c) a nerfed version of the default scrap collection.
---
In the end, all you really missed out on was a BoS themed collectron. As far as function goes you still need to buy the ones you want.
---
There's a problem with how Bethesda reset the underlying nuke code puzzle. Nothing worked for us on PC. Consoles might be different
---
I use mostly melee under lvl 35, ranged weapons in that 20-35 range is a bit of a shit show.
---
Scorched are probably your best bet at that level, and once you get some armor penetration, Super mutants drop a fair bit of ammo, but can be spongey af if you dont have armor penetration.
---
Low lvl Blood eagles/raiders might be okay too, I havent farmed them much on new ish characters.
---
One rank of the ammo finding perk under luck can be useful early game too.
---
Lucky Hole mine for lead and the Armco ammo machine you can buy after getting max rank with the raider faction helps too, but might not quite be in your wheel house yet.
---
Also check player vendors, I often have a few .38 and other low lvl ammo on for 0 caps.
---
Unethical fo76 hack- join a public team at A colossal problem, tag every wendigo you can, while stimpacking teamates that go down, loot every wendigo you can = profit!
---
Pro tip. 
---
Go cut your neighbour's lawn. Take the 10 bucks. Buy atoms. Quit whining.
---
I use that security gate door, so there's a window to see in if you're curious. Just trying to add an extra layer of security to my extractor and arch.
---
Give an ugly one to everyone for free. Make all the rest 'skins'...
---
What would you say about base? Such as a lv1 vs a lv1 in power armour
---
ipso facto, quid pro quo!
---
Yeah,sometime last year, I saw a Legendary hostile chicken near the train station that is closest to the meditation temple,but that was around the time when lots of mobs accidentally were being named  Legendary  before you killed them, and most became regular after the fight
---
I was so sad,  no loot, well except chicken meat if I remember right .
---
Now I wish I had a picture of it,but oh well  grats on your picture though
---
Is this the new karma grab meta? I think there has been a gilded post with this exact title every day for the past week.
---
I guess we alternate between appreciating high level players and shitting on annoying low levels.
---
And? The two don't have to be related, especially since the Atom Shop update is basically just a scheduled activation at 12pm EST (and the codes don't go bye-bye until later).
---
Yaassss! I love this! Thank you for sharing the video!
---
It's also worth occasionally checking your junk and sorting by weight. Some stuff doesn't autoscrap, e.g. I once discovered a load of deathclaw hands and various sheepsquatch parts adding a lot of weight to my stash.
---
For the hole I build floors where the staircase will be and place the shorter wooden defense wall where the longer side of the hole is and then remove the floors. That defense wall floats. Then I place my 2x1 stairs there. The smaller opening left I usually place a shelf or some object to keep from falling down. Currently I have my terminal there. Haha
---
Yeah, this is ridiculously frustrating. I ran a commando build up until level 70 and when I finally ran completely out of ammo, lead, aluminum and acid I decided to call it a day and began an unarmed (non-bloodied) build which has by far been my favorite build in the game. Though I suppose it was my own fault for jumping into ACP about 2 dozen times in a row with my commando character lol
---
I just get this crazy temptation to run a pistol build and always stop myself but the other day I decided to just go for it again. Now here I am, questioning myself yet again. So are you trying to tell me that not only are pistol builds currently not worth it, but that after the rebalance they'll be completely worthless?
---
I know now Bethesda checks the subreddit from time to time but maybe everyone who missed out of the bot would have a better chance of Bethesda putting it back in the shop for a week if everyone opened tickets instead of creating another thread on here.  Sorry if this sounds harsh, I truly hope that anyone who missed the bot due to the fires is safe and sound.
---
Watch out for OUTER WORLDS! THE FALLOUT KILLER!
---
Who's post release hype train died in less than a month as did its community.
---
Whats the glitch exactly? I’ve launched 4 nukes since yesterday and the NukaCrypt key worked since the very first one
---
I went looking for those exact plans last week. There are a number of set spawn locations that can have the plans.
---
NAR Repair Yard by the workbenches
---
An open train between NAR Repair Yard and the Train station.
---
Drop Site C2
---
Roof of the General's Steakhouse
---
Ranger District Office, in the building that has the workbench
---
Camp Venture, in the unlocked barracks building in the area with scorched
---
Harper's Ferry in the building on the corner right when you spawn in. First floor and on the upper floor you can get to through the train car.
---
New Appalachian Train Yard, by the workbench in the main building.
---
98 NAR Regional, to the East of the road from the train yard in an overturned train car.
---
These are just a few of the locations that are easiest to get to. Took me around 5 rotations, with 5 server hops, to finally get the right plans.
---
It kind of sounds like Kid Rock - [Bawitdaba](https://youtu.be/6J9ayHYClw8?t=38)
---
Thanks Unemployed guy
---
Well season 2 rewards are on the PTS.  So in a way they are being tested.
---
Ugh...fanboys defense of Beth.  Can I just be mad that they don’t work?
---
Power armor has a built in 80% speed modifier i think, and I’m not sure if this was placebo or what but I felt like I was going faster with emergency protocols (so, normal running speed) despite typically reaching max speed with speed demon
---
We have tested them Meno
---
and we can confirm
---
they are bugged to shit
---
regards
---
Well it shouldn't be in 1st, and I'm a frequent subscriber. 
---
It shouldn't be unlimited, maybe a couple of hundreds of lbs. Maybe the same for a free scrap box. 
---
There is a slight difference between scrap and ammo, at least when it comes down to cores in that they have a condition bar. Still it shouldn't be as much data added as weapons have.
---
Im Lucky. Ive seen 💥nuked Wastelands today😂🤪
---
Can anyone tell me what that thing collects?
---
So 600 is twice as effective as 300?
---
What's the numbers?
---
Not crazy here a reward to make up for your downvotes. Remember sometimes people downvote on Reddit not because you are wrong but because they don’t like hearing what you are saying.
---
At least on Xbox the bio scanner doesn’t load in most servers and the codes don’t work, this week or last.
---
Imagine letting people unlock them on pts to actually test them and see if they’re bugged ahead of time?! Would be nice..
---
True I’m on PC so I can’t confirm, have u tried using a jet pack to bypass the bio scanner
---
I don't pay money for skins and I never will. I would pay for quests. My point is, Bethesda has established that full dlcs can cost less than a single 76 skin. 
---
So thanks to this shitty business practice. If I want content, I have to hope Bethesda scams other people out of their money.
---
I *literally* am not allowed to pay for what I want
---
This last Meat Week was my first world event and using a lunchbox that then sets off a lunchbox chain from everyone else was such a satisfying experience
---
Workshops are PVP zones. That's how that happens. Nothing to do with challenges
---
Read the first sentence, got my hopes up then bam!
---
Yeah I tried that and get to the launch prep.  2x and diff silos.   Then the codes don’t work.  I guess I’ll just wait until all is back to normal.
---
I suspect that as part of the rollout they are running script to update database, the only other way around this is to update database on player login, which will extend first login time but will allow seamless version transition
---
Oh that’s right, I forgot about the choice in NV. I definitely picked wild wasteland and found lots of skeletons in compromising positions.
---
Naw you have a good point and I tried but once again the site is being weird. Every time I try to submit it boots me back to the beginning lol
---
Well that explains why I couldn't find it after returning to the game after a few days off. Nice!
---
Damn that sucks, cheers
---
So the comments aren't going the way you planned.
---
I agree. I also missed it while (foolishly) trying to spend time with my girlfriend, friends, and family. I guess Todd doesn't want his breathing ATM machines to do anything other than pay him 24/7.
---
Happy cake day!!!
---
If you have 1st, take a plant or three, power up the processor at the plant, and have a good time.  You get 1 core per processor about every 7-1/2 minutes.
---
  Failing that, when I was a really low level and didn't know how common cores were (compared to say, FO3 and 4).  During daytime play sessions, I got really tired of high levels killing me, taking my junk (and  the plant), so....
---
  I would wait until 2 or 3 am before I took a plant - (lower server population, so less chance of losing it) - drop down some normal generators, then power up the core processor.  On a good day, I'd get 6 or so before I either got killed or got too tired and logged off.   
---
Eventually, I learned (and started looting) the spawn points, found a few static spawns, got high enough level to do things like line in the sand....
---
Haven't taken a power plant since I was L25ish (I'm 241 now), have not looted spawn points in IDK how long, give away or drop cores under 50%, and still have way more cores than I'll be able to use for a long time.
---
Lmao who takes the time to play test their stuff? Ridiculous
---
I'll do what you recommend and I've recently heard of builds and got rid of all but my pistols for a gunslinger role, but as said only done this recent and up until lvl 25 I was randomly choosing my perks so I've to wait until max rank to fix this, so you say I need to just pick up the other guns and melee weapons for now until lvl 35? 
---
(Tryna figure my best path)
---
I want my perk load outs and I want them now. Lol 😆
---
But I'm already maxed on scrip since I thought the sale started today. :(
---
I guess I'll still login to clear caps, pretend to find and turn in Ward's missing doohickey, and convert some Treasury notes to gold before calling it a day.
---
My “Grand Slam”:
---
1. Find Excavator Boy in a workshop
---
2. Kill him and he drops a lot of junk
---
3. Start shooting his legs to break them, get a 
---
picture when I’m done
---
4. He still hasn’t respawned yet, so I start     breaking the rest of his PA
---
5. I finish breaking the rest of his PA and get another picture for my loadscreens
---
6. He starts talking MAD shit over area chat because he’s salty
---
7. He respawns and goes to his CAMP, and I follow
---
8. He repairs his excavator and hits me with his All-Rise, I retaliate and level his CAMP, breaking his armor again as well
---
9. I get called a hacker, he logs out
---
10. I was recording the whole thing and now have a new grief session to jerk off to
---
You're the best!
---
Truly unfortunate lol
---
Really can't find enough to do after the legendary run, game just feels a bit dead and boring right now, end up logging out after 30 mins.
---
Thanks! &lt;3
---
3XP weekend during the first weekend of Season 2.
---
To know what your even talking about.
---
Lvl 131 on xbox my wife is lvl 70 something we play together every night havent fought Earl and we are getting bored just exploring WV by ourselves if anyone wants to add me my username is DSGxCuThroat
---
This demonstrates how broken they are nicely...
---
 https://imgur.com/WKl5Ftx
---
I missed it because I was on the PTS the whole time it was up.  I figured I'd have time to log in on my regular account after a 3 day weekend cooldown from all those Ops I've been running.
---
But at least I'll get a tiny banner to add to my camp in place of the BOS collection right?/s
---
Underrated reply lol. Junkie characters with 5+ addictions should physically thin out and have idle animations where they get twitchy and restless
---
The C.A.M.P. items in the Atomic Shop, like the Vault-Tec Clock, can be built while you are actively in the building screen of your C.A.M.P. (some items can also be crafted once you’ve claimed a workshop). Basically in the area of your C.A.M.P. hold down the button that looks like 2 rectangles to go to the build screen, and using the bumpers tab over until you see the Wall Decor tab. I do not have that clock myself but that’s where I bet it’s located. Atomic Shop items you own (have the plans for, essentially) will have a yellow atom icon next to them in the build screen. The item won’t show up as buildable until you have the correct materials (scrapped from junk) on hand. Hope that helps!
---
What I would suggest is waiting for this change next week and see what ends up happening and what the fallout is from that.
---
Dont u have problems in nuke silos today?
---
Free nuke day would crash the system
---
Lmfao some mole rats chewed the wires
---
Non-auto pistols have a half dozen options that are like budget lever action rifles (high damage per shot with a moderate rate of fire) so it's easy to make them viable against trash mobs. The gauss pistol and black powder pistol are also arguably better in most situations than their rifle counterparts due to higher ROF. So semi-auto pistol builds are not bad for headshot sniping weak to moderate enemies in one or two shots. Instigating is the best prefix for those weapons. They'll be getting tank killer in the upcoming patch so they'll get that much more competitive with a rifleman build. But one-shot builds are getting hit harder by the incoming damage equation nerf than multiple shot dps builds, so rifleman and gunslinger are both going to suffer disproportionately.
---
Where they really come up short is in sustained damage per second. I have a junkies pistols/shotguns character that can only frustratedly plink away with a 10mm as scorchbeasts circle. I do ok with my shotgun once they land, but it's an annoying wait. Anti-armor is probably the best non-bloodied prefix for that weapon - after the nerf it will be about the same damage as junkies. Pipe pistols have higher dps, but have to spend more time reloading so overall they're a little worse than the 10mm but will do in a pinch. Either way you'll have trouble against Earl, scorchbeasts, sheepsquatches, and SBQ.
---
It would be nice if there were just the one set of damage perk cards that applied to both semi-auto and full-auto pistols, then you'd have a reasonable sustained dps option for a dedicated pistols build, but there aren't enough special points currently to spec into both. People are saying it won't really be worth maxing out your weapon class damage perks after the incoming nerf, so maybe it would be effective to hybridize by putting one or two points each into all six.
---
What I've been doing is double specializing - I've got a rifleman/heavy gunner, a pistols/shotgunner, and a slugger/commando. The single shot kill weapons are fun and conserve ammo, while the alternate can be used for boss dps.
---
Oh no. In that case buy three modules and max out again.
---
I was on a private world. It was locked. And if somebody had joined then it would’ve said “somebody has a bounty”
---
Hey, y'know what, if a low level takes down my high level...I usually go tell them GG and offer them some stimpaks. Because that's amazing.
---
I'm a melee build, and use the following mods on all my PA
---
Motion assist servos on the torso (+2 STR).  Melee benefits from high STR.
---
Optimized Bracers: Reduces Action Point cost for Power Attacks
---
Nice to have:
---
Targeting hud
---
Calibrated shocks
---
Bethesda owes us nothing for nukes randomly having issues.
---
Wait a sec is that lynx from fortnite? There’s two games in which I never thought anyone would mix
---
If ur level 200+ and ur water purifier is locked ur a dweeb
---
What you are describing is odd, its almost like he’s holding the event for friends to arrive. Some people, I’ve noticed on here, say don’t start an event right away, wait for others. I don’t agree with that, we all have our game to play and time constraints, why should I wait 10 minutes just in case you might be bothered to play?? 
---
The only exceptions for me are Cryptid (somebody else paid for the ticket so it’s their show) and Radiation Rumble (I’ve not found a way to complete it without at least 3 others, but then I am a bit shit).
---
There’s lots of etiquette that can be debated, my rule of thumb is if everyone played the same way would the event complete? Everyone on the roof in one violent night would cause the event to fail the first time the juke box breaks.
---
Thank you. I’ll look into it
---
Only if there were more of these people... This is one of the legendary high levels that don't feel like "God"...
---
How do you get the C.A.M.P refrigerator I thought that was only an Atomic Shop thing?
---
Most of the time, I had low-level ghouls or animal spawns. However, at least once per day, I had a group of high-level (read: 60+) Super Mutants or Scorched swing by and shoot at a chair until my house fell down while my turrets watched them do it. Or, you get a swarm of mole rats who eat your scarecrow then eat everything while your turrets ignore them. Your mileage may vary. Still, I had good traffic for vending as people would run down from Foundation. I just got tired of rebuilding my camp each day.
---
If it's locked it's not being shared.  I only ever lock one of my 5 water purifiers and I'm pretty pleased when I find them empty because someone wanted a drink.
---
Paddle ball added to nuclear winter
---
No SBQ was killed today. Great day in Appalachia))
---
If I ever bothered to put down a purifier I guess I’d leave it unlocked. The drugs in my Raiderbot are mine tho.
---
1. I think you have some pretty solid points here, especially the first one. It should be for everyone but should be limited. 
---
2. I understand your point on the second one but at the same time there has to be a better way to trade high value items other than drop it on the ground or trade it for zero caps and hope the other person holds up their end of the deal. Maybe limit the number of items you can trade and only one trade per hour with that person? Idk, but they need something different
---
3. I like the idea of the mail box. I think I’ve heard that one posted here too but I’ve always liked that idea. Sometimes I just want to tell people when I like their camp.
---
4. I’m with you here. I would like to see how things change in the newest patch. I wouldn’t even expect this to happen anyway truthfully because it would be such a huge change.
---
If it's unlocked, I will help myself. I figure the owner isn't too worried about it and therefore, neither am I. Conversely, last night I came upon a camp where the *chicken coop* was locked. In this case, the message was clear to me: keep your hands off my shit.
---
60 FPS. No stutter.
---
Mole rats chewed the wires..
---
And my Drill
---
The missing BOS collectron did it.
---
Light weight scrip
---
Im just thinking whats better: one dupe day or 60 fps😂
---
I recall a black powder rifle with Furious on it. Does that even work?
---
I'm in too IGN Meidara
---
You missed the boat
---
you mean the challenges for the seasonal rewards? that ended.
---
Idk The previous community event rewards were never re-released.
---
I would say that one of the big frustrations is the Gauss Pistol.  In theory, this is a great weapon that should fill the role of a more damaging 10mm pistol, since it has a big magazine and can be silenced, unlike most revolvers.  But the VATS bugs absolutely devastate its usefulness.  You cannot hit the broad side of a barn with it, even with "95%" in VATS, and its range is pitiful.
---
i did that for the first time the other day. headed out and then got thirsty, went to my inventory to find i had forgotten to grab fluids... i was in the middle of an event so i was pissed lol
---
😂🍻
---
A good amount of us have been playing non stop since the beginning so we know what it was like to start out................... that and we have insane amounts of supplies that we don’t like going to waste. I check every day around the world for low level guys and gals and ask them if this is their first time playing and then I drop low level legendary gear, ammo, stimpaks, rad away, food, and other items. That is the only downside about one wasteland. I won’t be able to drop legendary loot for new players now because they will always be maxed out on each drop.
---
I think i might be confused.
---
Are you saying Damage Reduction doesn't have diminishing returns or that  "DR" the armor value doesn't have diminishing returns.
---
Also, I'm not talking 0% to 20% vs 60% to 80%. I'm talking 0% to 20% vs 60% to 68%. Both of those are 20% less damage taken, but one has higher effectiveness.
---
I guess it’s done deliberately because they didn’t want the fridge to come over as “pay-to-win” considering the only way to get it is from the atom shop
---
We all can tank him the whole time. The reason why we don't is so we all get Mob XP
---
Sounds like communist propaganda to me. Death is a preferable alternative to communism.
---
Just kidding though. If I truly care about a resource (i.e. my lead extractor), I'll lock it with a level 3 lock, inside a room with a level 3 locked door. If someone really wants it, they'll get wanted status, and a 10c bounty.
---
Is the C.A.M.P banner gonna be back to? That’s the one I missed out on :/
---
They are in the future.
---
I have a wierd little crew, and I'll gladly die for your tadpole badge.  Will be on tonight around 4PM Pacific time with some other Beastly Casuals on PS4, add Meidara007 and see you then.
---
Yes, please!  It does seem like it'd be a natural next step for simple stackables with only an item count stat to track.
---
About the only problem I see with this is Fusion and Plasma Cores, which have an intrinsic additional stat to track and therefore don't stack cleanly into "AMMO TYPE .45 - COUNT 1272" in the database.  I think they'd probably have to exclude those, sadly.  This may be a reason why an ammo stash hasn't happened yet, since it'd just be another poke in the eye for arguably neglected power armor wearers.  "Everyone gets a huge chunk of stash space back... Except for you guys who are dependent on the heaviest ammo in the game."
---
The often suggested Fusion Core Battery CAMP object: dump fusion cores in, get a stockpile of power points (perhaps losing a few percent in the process), withdraw 100% full cores when needed.  The ammo converter already has that functionality for simple ammo (although the efficiency hit is ridiculous), so the concept is sound.  I think others have suggested core combiners (two depleted cores in, one full core out), but the points based system seems cleaner.
---
Good point. I was not thinking of all the player-related assets that need to be rebuilt when there is a code update. QC would not have that, or certainly not to the extent of 76. Still, how long would that first-login delay be? Seems to be a decent trade-off if there is effectively no downtime.
---
I actually bought the ultralight mod for Secret Service chest ( not available for limbs) just to reduce stash size
---
I get her a ton of times on the random encounter loop I run- especially at the bend in the road south west of the little red rocket in the mire
---
Wow, you're a piece of shit.
---
For the love of god please give us a key ring.
---
Stealing is caring....
---
I for one am very happy they did something. I too am old and have a life. The big thing for me was the game was becoming very hmm easy. I started to question why I would need any other weapon/armor when I could slap anything to death with a pencil. I am testing the PTS with a low level 32 and all I can tell you is it is much more fun but could use a bit more of a challenge. This is all my opinion and I am not saying mine is the correct way for everyone. I just do not understand the fun of one shot kills unless there is a massive amount of mobs that make it a challenge. To me the fun was having the whole server fighting tooth and nails to bring down this massive boss. Now its just hurry  get there and get a shot in before billy fires once . I wish they could split up the servers for people like me that want a fun challenge and servers for people that want easy kills but that would split the player base I guess.
---
You bought that weapon for real money didn't you.
---
Orange sky, red sun, yup... same here.
---
This is EXACTLY what i was about to post!!
---
I wouldn't say I've been *missing* them...ba dum tiss
---
wtf bro 😂 r u ok
---
I hope a Snallygaster steals your baby.
---
Probably as well as a faster fire rate harpoon gun
---
They used to run constantly but now they only run during seasons. Last season ended on the 8th, next season starts in about a week or two I think.
---
I don't say these things for upvotes clout or acceptance. I know and think a lot of people enjoy the game, look forward to these things and life has been getting in the way more lately than usual and it would be nice to get a break from our favorite past time. I stick by that regardless of the comments.
---
Primed Gatling Plasma can convert 2 plasma cores into 3.6 ultracite plasma cores on average with ammo smith.
---
If ammo factory works like I think it does it'll let you turn 2 into 9.6 Ultracite cores on average. Amazing value for 1 flux.
---
In my last play through I found someone with a coop with a level 3 lock, and I genuinely laughed. Like you said, message rang clear - bruh takes his chicken shit quite seriously. 😂
---
If anything is unlocked it's free for the taking.
---
ive had several high level players come up to me, shoot at me to get my attention, and then drop a ton of plans, gear and supplies. one time a guy tried to teach me how to phase through a the door to a bot vendor at a train station. i never figured it out but i thought it was cute that he tried to teach me anyway lol.
---
PA base movement is 20% slower than normal, but sprinting compensates for that and makes you sprint as fast as outside PA.
---
No I got it for free from a player that quit the game
---
Wtf i stopped playing for 4 days and it's gone already?   They didn't even say when it was due for collection
---
Oh snap
---
Will be back in 6 months for 800 atoms knowing bethesda
---
Don't bother right now, they broke nuke codes yesterday on a lot of servers so you might find the silo non functional when you finally beat the robots which would be a huge bummer.
---
Hopefully it's fixed soon.
---
I hear where you're coming from. Realistically, no one forces people to use bloodied or junkies.   
---
Try doing your game without mutations or legendary equipment. Trust me, game is doable, but much more grindy. Nerfs like the one they are doing now are an excuse for programmers to avoid doing large parts of their job - namely fixing the game more broadly. Instead, rather than making AI more cagey, or creating more interesting and varied environments, the game is made "harder" by making bullet sponges ever more spongey.
---
concentrated fire is broken on rank 3 for automatics.  broken in a good way it applies bats accuracy like it’s none automatic
---
Jesus, what a bunch of crybabies, grow the fuck up.
---
I don't know... PC servers have been busy as ever. I still see most people on the server in INT teams which makes me wonder if they know the run is over...
---
Yes. I’m not sure when it’s coming, but they plan on removing the negative effects. You can still benefit from the buffs and stuff if you decide to eat/drink. Personally I think it’s absolutely ridiculous and a terrible idea.
---
If you're on XBOX drop gamertags so we can party up. I can never find anyone to do Earle with. I'm lvl 102 and can't do it myself.
---
Thanks for the lengthy explanation, trust me I needed it! Definitely going to keep all of this in mind.
---
Also...I completely forget to mention in the original post that I was also wondering if there was anything I could run alongside pistols since they aren't truly viable on their own. I do run single shot rifles alongside my unarmed melee character and it seems to work nicely. I do like the idea of a pistols/shotguns build. The weapon variety helps. Are pistols able to run alongside anything else?
---
That nuke keycard vertibot....
---
Make it fly at ground level. Then all is forgiven.
---
Can you no longer destroy someone’s camp? I’ve never tried
---
if your on xbox i might be able to help you with that.  i dont remember exactly what is needed, but if i have it i am happy to help out.
---
Just my two cents. I always leave my water purifier unlocked, in case some young'un happens by and is in need and for the most part the same goes for resource collectors I honestly don't care if someone wants to take some steel or copper from a resource collector I've set up. Crops? Have at it. I  have the carnivore mutation so generally crops do me no good anyway. Manufacturing adhesive? bah adhesive so ridiculously available in normal game play making my own is a waste of time.
---
In the PTS the structure is there to test but we cannot claim any of the rewards. We could test the challenges and collection of score, see the board, and see the rewards.
---
Was wondering why it was so quiet today
---
Honestly, w/o is probably a tad faster
---
No problem sir. I understand. Can't wait for the next patch/update. Hope it goes smoothly. I want to try those legendary perks.
---
Nah PS4 but thanks for offering
---
Somewhere in the Lights tab I think.
---
My 2nd caster was bloodied.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iitbzh/pts_damage_comparison_junkies_and_antiarmor_does/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Really nice test with actual numbers. Bloodied still does nearly double the damage as junkies on the PTS.
---
Just build underground. There, it’s all flat
---
You know - that’s a great point I hadn’t considered. I also have the carnivore perk, but I never considered growing food for low levels. Hmm - you may have just converted me there. 👍🏽
---
It's a random encounter, but I've seen her the most at Berkley Springs. Usually in front of, or around, the 3 story building full of scorched.
---
From a tone standpoint I think I'd like to achieve a semi-serious tone with light moments and the occasional joke. I want the character to be serious but that doesn't mean the situation he's in is serious. Or maybe I crack a bad joke at the worst time. I dont want to break meta often. Save that for special occasions.
---
The Enclave Beret...that we know was in one of the previous datamines.
---
i agree
---
Bethesda if we are paying 500 atoms for a fridge
---
let it chill our shit
---
If you got your water purifiers locked ya moms a hoe
---
I didn’t get it either due to being on holidays
---
Sounds good. Friend me up and we can go from there. Name is Mckron in the game.
---
If it's unlocked, I assume it's on purpose and fair game, but I still personally feel weird actually taking anything. Most players who have them set up should know to lock them if they don't want them emptied, though, so I would say if it's open, it's fair game (unless some jerk picked the lock before you got there - not like you'd have any way of knowing if that was the case, though.)
---
Step 6 in a nutshell
---
Ive got a bloody buddy
---
Yeah when they shut down the legendary run something seems like it went haywire. I haven't crashed for months and since the reset I've had 4 CTD during fast travel and sooo much lag when picking up items and opening containers on some servers.
---
Funny enough, the servers with the worst lag are the ones that still apparently have working nuke codes (I've been server hopping for nuke zones to gather flux).
---
Also could be that they were running around before OP’s camp fully spawned in.
---
you're not the first person to critique the third person viewpoint.
---
I had thrown that in for alternate camera angle usage. But if its immersion breaking thats fine.
---
I had been planning to switch camera to face me when I'm talking in dialogue with another NPC. So its not just sitting on one camera all the time.
---
I also really want to include other dwellers. Most of my friends don't play this game so I need to find someone who wants to get on camera.
---
Expect it to take way more TD than this dude claims. 5 TD to get to Elder. What luck!
---
With unyielding set  you get:
---
- 45 extra carry weight, and 80% increased melee damage, 160% for unarmed IIRC
---
- 6% better hit chance (.4% per preception), 168 ft increase of compass range 
---
- cheaper prices, easier speech checks, 75% more XP and caps from group quests
---
- 30% more experience, 66% more scrap yield, 75% better crafting condition
---
- 150 more AP , 75 more sneak rating
---
- 27.5% extra crit meter fill per hit, looted items have up to 140% more condition
---
With the added damage, and sneak you could include less ammo consumption, and less weapon/armor repairs aswell
---
No other legendary effect comes close to being that beneficial, especially when deminishing returns of DR/ER are brought into the equation.
---
It's always a holiday somewhere...
---
All the standard is what I have noticed.  No ultracite or Plasma, but 5.56, 38, 45, 5mm, 10mm, .50 cal. Etc.
---
I leave everything in mycamp unlocked. Ammo machine, water purifiers everything. I have everything i want for the most part. Free water for everyone
---
They need to make the legendary items roll into your inventory for being part of the event.
---
E.g., There are 3 legendary enemies that are killed, you get 3 legendary rolls in your inventory at the conclusion of the event, as an event reward. Or a currency we can redeem at the purveyor for a legendary roll.
---
I lock mine just because some people were leaving fertlizer on my bed, stove and porch.
---
I am in steel node and even my steel extractor is unlocked. just like my water purifier. take as much as you want.
---
but my chicken coop and brahmin pen are both locked.
---
My cow and my chickens are unlocked for everybody. If you want fertilizer go ahead and grab it. I don’t care. It’s not hard to obtain. Not a lot of stuff you need to build requires fertilizer. And the few that does, it doesn’t take long to get some. 
---
My ammo machine is obviously locked because it’s ammo I need. It’s not there for people to take for free. 
---
I don’t really use water purifiers. So can’t give me opinion on that. Because I rather collect inert flux or just boil some water. Then again you find so much water and alcohol throughout your adventures that I’ve never been in a situation where I didn’t have something to drink. 
---
My collectron is locked because he is collecting junk for me.
---
My camp, including everything else is unlocked for people to see and explore.
---
Pretty sure its capped at 30fps on consoles?
---
Well this makes me want that collectron now lol
---
I recently had a 200+ help me w several missions and it was amazing. He really didn’t need to take time out of his day but was super cool about it and thankfully I was able to assist him w some very minuscule stuff in return. It’s really nice when there’s a few bumps in the road you can’t seem to manage solo. Nice to know good people are out there.
---
Maybe don't by a game that is nothing but micro-transactions if times are tough. I didn't.
---
Revelation 21:6; I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life, freely...
---
18675309 is the code for alpha
---
I’m surprised myself.. just got it today.  I was expecting a long haul on that one.
---
We can’t claim them and use them. So yes the rewards are on the PTS, but we have no way to test them to see if they have bugs.
---
Their site has a note saying codes are bugged
---
I use an unyielding ap refresh sent/cav/sneak combo for my armor pieces just for that purpose. Don’t know if 5 sentinel pieces help dramatically
---
u/ladydevann
---
Not to discourage you, because I f'n love my handguns, but pistols are one of the weaker builds currently.
---
But the good thing is, they share a lot of special point allocations with rifles, so you can kinda double dip with both classes.
---
76 unlike previous games, kind of penalizes you unless you pick one ish main form of combat.
---
I say ish because some builds complement each other, ie Handguns + Rifles both use a ton of perception and agility perks, so you can reduce max damage of one build while still making the other somewhat useful.
---
Melee+heavy gunner can also work together not bad, at the loss of max possible damage.
---
About lvl 20-25 mobs start to get more noticeable DR/ER. This is where I usually find that my ranged weapons start to feel weak.
---
No lie, lvl 25-45 are probably the hardest lvls to grind in the game.
---
This is where I use a crafted machete til I get Tank killer @ lvl 30. If you can get your hands on an antiarmor rifle/pistol/heavy it will really help in your 20s/30s. Head shots help too, but arent always easy to hit consistently.
---
After you get some armor penetration, your bullets will become less spongey and you'll find yourself needing less.
---
I remembered a decent place to farm scorched, hit up the airport in Morgantown, inside there is a few if you got time, than do the Collision course event if its available.
---
I found this to, though I havent used it https://www.falloutbuilds.com/
---
Most use nukesdragons https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Go visit the site. Codes are crossed out and the note says codes are currently bugged
---
I’ve been on SGT forever. RNG hates me.
---
The whole camp building menu needs adjusting.
---
The glitch has been around for a very long time. It’s extremely easy to do. You can do it to get behind locked doors without having to pick the lock or hack the terminal. 
---
If you want to mess around and scare your friends or players, you can use it to go next to the vendors in train stations. And it’s also extremely helpful when you want to launch a nuke but don’t feel like doing all the requirements for nuke launching. 
---
It’s called the photomode glitch.  Go up to the door. As close as possible. Activate photomode. Now zoom into (with your analog stick/camera) into your character and the door in front of him/her. Then simply exit photomode. If done correctly you should be able to walk/run and bypass the door. Might take a few tries to do until you get the hang of it.
---
That's the way of the Wasteland. Some people lead, others scavenge. There's no shame in it.
---
34 luck + crit savy rank 3 is a crit proc after every hit. No need for 15% weapon.
---
30 luck NO crit savy is a proc after 2 hits.  In order to this without unyielding you need rank 3 crit savy and 15 luck.
---
15 luck, a cirt fill weapon and 1 point in crit savy acheives a proc after 2 hits
---
Yeah that should work. Not tried it........_yet_.
---
Atomic shop update was at 12.  Nuke was at 8pm.
---
i get the sense from your post , you've not much else going on in life.
---
kinda feel bad for anyone that approaches an open world game like this.
---
griefing lower level players wont make your mom love you dude.
---
I don't get the pvp most of the time. Ok, you get 50 caps? Maybe some junk I was toting around. If you get super lucky you get 1 or 2 stable flux if I did ACP recently and forgot to store it. Then what? The hard pee pee? I just stay dead and wait to respawn. It's just not fun to me fighting someone who has magic 1 shot weapons or 1hko stealth builds. Hell, the workshop killers don't even care about the workshops and seem to log off shortly afterwards..
---
I will again post on here that I have not found td in almost 3 months. I use to find it everywhere but after I turned in a run around 3 months ago I have not found anymore. For some reason ppl think I’m lying about not finding it or that I’m a noob and don’t know where to look. Has anyone else had this problem?
---
Here is my take...
---
Micro transactions are a double edge sword.  They come in two versions;
---
1. Cosmetic items that provide no edge to players to get ahead of other players who are free to play.
---
2. Items that have items like weapons or armor with better stats than what free to play players can (refuse) to obtain.
---
Fallout 76 falls into category 1 with the exception of things like the Fallout 1st scrap bin and things like collectrons.
---
Personally I like micro transactions that allow me to add more to my collection of skins, outfits and camp items.  However I am fortunate enough to have extra income that I use mostly to fund my gaming addiction.  Not everyone has a way to pay for things like that.  I do feel like the items and bundles are a little on the expensive side, BUT you have to consider the Legendary Run that is absolutely free compared to games that charge $10.00 or so.  Regarding Fallout 1st, I feel that it is worth the cost since youre obtaining Atoms every month that is worth what you pay, plus extra items/outfits on top of that.
---
My biggest complaint about the atom shop is when they try to sell is reskins of the same item.  For example the new outfit that looks just like the Blue Ridge.
---
As long as Bethesda doesn't pull the same this that Black Ops 4 did and start putting new weapons that provide an advantage in the game that are locked behind a paywall then everything will be fine.  Every player should have an equal opportunity to obtain new items that provide any advantage over other players.
---
Mine was the guy throwing dozens of grenades in a row blowing corpses all over the map during Line in the Sand while instigating a fight with everyone at the event over his mic. Great, now I have to chase down loot. Including everything glitched into surrounding structures that is now unclaimable.
---
September 15
---
You don't, because they don't exist.
---
Thanks now i have to lock everything
---
I'm already over these complaints. Posting new threads won't accomplish anything.
---
A good chunk of libertarianism is allowing people the freedom of choice and to do as they please. Your post seem to be you telling people what to do and how to act.
---
Atomic shop
---
Add me Montykoro,  when they fix the servers I gonna help you, for free :)
---
With ACP just remember, his balls are heavy.
---
Man, this really help bring perspective to my hoarding problem.  Currently around 5500 screws and 485 improved repair kits.....feel kind of ashamed to say that.
---
I totally empathize with you there, but from an outsider’s perspective that is hysterical 😂. Can’t say I blame you for locking it
---
This. Just did this exact thing on my last Earle run. Be prepared to compete with the rushing Wendigo spawn and bewildered looks from your team mates running in the opposite direction 😛
---
No joke she made a cake last night lol
---
Someone did that for me when I was level 2.  I had just made it out of Wayward and to the overseers camp. Some guy started shooting at me. Level 300 something. I pulled my .38 pipe pistol out and tried to get after him while he stood there shooting Santa’s Gift Bag sitting on the ground. So I went and checked it out. He gave me water, food, stimpacks, Radaway, and a level 10 sniper rifle. Now, at level 108, I do the same for other people. The real struggle is getting people to figure out how to look in the bag.
---
Pipe is life,i have a rifleman with a bloodied explosive pipe revolver rifle, it benefits from both pistol and rifle perks,it only needs 3 points on licenced plumber while gunsmith needs 5 for 60% and the dmg is insane.
---
How did you come to that? I am still unable to even get a quest to trigger to collect code pieces.
---
Edit: ok it took me 30 minutes to get, but you got me lmao.
---
And here comes the Reddit armchair therapist; passing judgement on someone they don’t know.
---
I haven’t played ESO but I feel like they could make some changes to the atom store that would make the players happier and make them more money.
---
Every individual item should be available at all times. Items that shouldn’t always be available are holiday stuff, like Christmas or thanksgiving, or bundles. Bundles would just be the items bundles together but with a pretty high discount so people would still buy them.
---
Have daily sales, 1-3 items a day go on sale for maybe 10-20% and weekly sales, 3-5 items + 1 bundle on sale for 20-40%. This would give you incentive to not buy anything at base value, but if you’re impatient you’re still able to.
---
It's a rebalancing of the nuke cycle. The nukes are causing to much damage so Beth has rebalanced them. It's important to find other activities that don't cause to much damage during this time or it could be rebalanced.
---
Only one here to blame is you. It was announced weeks ago when the thing will be available in atomshop. And the time limit on 1st of september.
---
Workshop people are usually the worst. And yeah I always store my junk before fighting just in case anyways. I always hope the workshop people come when I'm at the ammo factory as I turn the basement and the little room leading to it into a panic room and I have turrets surrounding it and inside in the windows which I repair nonstop. And then when they keep focusing the turrets I peek the other window or open the door with a minigun or 50 cal and repeat lmao. Usually works well and I keep my workshop but have to repair everything when they get mad and destroy all of it
---
This is kind of already happening. One of the Daily Ops rewards is a plan to craft Whistle in the Dark, one of the Survival Mode weapons. Presumably future Daily Ops will include others.
---
I have enough of "With muscles like that you wont be joining the Brotherhood." "Oh I'm so tired. Or.. am I still spoilers(?)?" "What would Elder Maxson think of that state of your ghoul guts." -Clank clank clank- Your armor workbench is already in use. "oh hey you're back!" "All these people lawnchin nukes got dang it!" "something something Unstoppables yada yada"
---
EVERYONE SHUT UP! -frog noises- EVEN YOU!
---
It’s hard for some people to say nothing rather than something dumb.
---
I'd also add the Canaan Valley Overlook in Dolly Sods Wilderness, Monongahela National Forest. Absolutely gorgeous view. If you're lucky, you'll see vultures gliding below you. It has a really nice, flat path at the top; it goes the length of the ridge.
---
EDITED: I preffer the atomic shop. The crown store not only has loot boxes, but theres certain items u cannot purchase with crowns, but you can purchase them with a secondary currency that you adquire for opening said loot boxes, in the case the that cool mount you wanted dint drop. Ofcourse itll take u like 90 crates to get enough for it, but thats what it is.
---
To make another point, ALL dlc of ESO are PAID. You only get free access to them if your an ESO+ member, were as in Fallout, its all free.
---
Shit let me find ppl that are quitting so I can get one. I sure as hell ain’t paying 70 dollars on a shady website to have a gun in a game
---
Flash! Bam! Alakazam!
---
Can i play wit u
---
This was some BullSh\*t. I got mine and told my girlfriend that plays on her days off and she was super excited to get it and when her day off comes around the next day it was gone. she was so let down. They removed the ability for me to put collectrons in her camp so she can't even get one from me.
---
I'd help, but I'm on PC, and also stupid busy.
---
Then you don’t understand the post or libertarianism.
---
You shouldn't be attacking low levels who don't want to pvp anyway but to each their own lmao. Dude definitely didn't say gg though he just came back for more and I ignored him as I wasnt gonna push my luck and by technicality I won and he was very mad about it lol
---
Saving up all my scrip for my birthday which just so happens to be during the Purveyor sale lol
---
I assume you don't mean build legendaries so I won't mention bloodied or junkies. 
---
Secondary traits are usually faster fire rate but explosive is nice. If your a vats user you may want at least the 3rd trait to be related. 
---
So non build related primary? Instigating would be good for a sneak build. I kind of have a penchant for quad or anti armor, bonus anti armor might become a good roll after the next update.
---
I just finished ep 2. You're time jumping a LOT, and it seems to be jumping faster and faster. It's a bit abrupt.
---
Is this only on pc or every system? I was able to use nukes last night on Xbox. Do the codes refresh today? Never paid attention as I only launched 5 nukes in two years but have 30 nuke cards. I just started launching them lately. Being I want more excitement
---
Buy. The. Plan.
---
Good, you are awake.
---
I was having a hard rime finding them as well. My usual spots were dry.
---
Na then I can’t play for 5 more years 😂
---
Bethesda... compensating... hahaha, good one.
---
Actually, fireworks probably doesn't matter, I think the max fire rate on the harpoon is capped at once every 4 seconds, regardless of reload speed. As long as they don't fix magic weapons it is still formidable, if you're a sneak build.
---
Missed it too.
---
Production wing of the bunker.  Cost around 5000 caps but well worth it.
---
Where is the plan for sale at? I didn’t even know there was one
---
Thank god someone finally says same thing. Like did they move them. Dude I used to have like 100 on me and would just sell them to vendor bots and after finally doing it 3 months ago I have not found any since
---
Lights. If you have the electro fireplace from last christmas it shares a space with that one.
---
The Wendigo Colossus plushie is separate from other plushies because it uses circuitry in the crafting recipe, and makes a sound when you activate it.
---
I've seen him twice. "I made this little guy sing!" Eyebot, not singing. 
---
Ok den..
---
I wish I could Solo Earle
---
Enclave base, whitespring bunker, production hall trade
---
I just want a smaller scrap box model this thing is huge!
---
I find the Crown store to be super confusing honestly.
---
What I'm getting is that effective health increases from 2.1 to 2.75 for non-PA going from 300 to 600 armor rating at 250 incoming damage, or from 6.9 to 8.9 at 10 incoming damage. The curve is shifted up from the origin so the return on investment isn't 1:1, but it's not kinked or very curved, so there isn't a point at which it starts drastically reducing.
---
I just went away for the holiday weekend and apparently missed it.  I been participating in the event the whole time too except for those 3 days...   Bethesda really needs to work on the communication for time specific items.
---
Step #8,172 on how to kill and already dead game. Take notes
---
Upvoted for the pun alone. I just can't resist!
---
This.  Make sure you have flux though before wasting caps on it.  Think it's 5 violet per leg.
---
I’ll have to save up a couple days oh well thanks for the info
---
&gt;Why would they not allow us to buy ranks on the last day when the legendary run Is still in the game 
---
Many things Bethesda do if intentionally or not seem designed to piss off as many players as possible, this being a fine example, they give no leeway for mistakes.
---
There are ways, but that's extreme overkill in almost every instance.
---
I'm super jealous. That sounds awesome. There's some YouTube vids of people visiting places from the games, but that's the closest I've gotten so far.
---
Lmao have some sympathy for those in ultracite please
---
One of my last runs I died while Earle had a sliver of health so they died just as I respawned up top so the drop down sealed up. Soon figured I could run the wrong way along the daring escape route. I earned that 1* lwad pipe,.damnit.
---
melee has its own slew of problems and will be nerfed harder than everything else.
---
the bonus hit chance is irrelevant to anything but pistols, which need all the help they can get. rifles have enough range and perform well enough as it is, without unyielding. the per bonus is just that, a bonus. it doesn't make or break a build.
---
a chameleon set is stealthier than an unyielding one. and the extra crit fill irrelevant unless you're at the breakpoint, unless you have a 15% vats weapon. but then you don't really need unyielding.
---
the passive bonuses are just that, passive. one could even make a case they're not game breaking by definition, seeing as how they're, well, passive. and it's also important to note that, just because every other prefix suck, that doesn't make unyielding op.
---
Thanks lol that was the whole point in it :) look for my next post in a few might get a kick out of that too.
---
We know, we were all there
---
True that’s real pain lol
---
Batteries included for the ammo
---
Came here to say exactly that! Rad Ant Lager has saved my hoarding butt so many times trying to get back to camp to scrap!
---
Grilled meat steak cranberry cobler these have great affects and getting the items take no time at all as long as you know where to look and play the game and as far as spoil it doesnt matter cus when i need to eat cus im starving spoiled food works without waisting effective cooked meals even tho they kinda were cooked meals lol i guess 30 grilled meat steaks I can care less about 22 that spoiled
---
Thanks, it worked!
---
That bag.. lol
---
I always leave my resources open for anyone to take, apart from my scrap collector. I regularly help myself to open water purifiers and ammo machines
---
Got it thanks. Its never been a light. What a stupid place to put it.
---
Where are the pictures?!
---
It took me a few weeks before I knew where I could contribute to the event and everytime when I knew what to donate and when I got the scraps to donate, they already moved on to the next junk. I donated 1 time.
---
Purely in response to the amount of these posts I now believe it wasn't pulled fast enough. I reckon an hour would have sufficed for those that really wanted it.
---
usually the turret that shoots at me is indestructible as well.
---
if anything i'd implore you to seek out some therapy &lt;3
---
The shielded under armor plan took me so long after getting all the paints, I usually drop one off if I'm in the area after checking the nuke silo launch room. Before that it was about 3 each from sugar grove or whitesprings bunker per server hop so it only took a few hours in total.
---
If it is unlocked, its mine.
---
If you don't want to give away your water, junk, acid, copper, steel, lead, ect, then lock your resources.
---
I check all resources when I find someones camp.  If they are unlocked, I take whats there.  
---
I have been doing this since January 2019
---
Ad victoriam? I guess.... Enclave seem so much better off. Here's hoping for Steel Dawn to be as good.
---
I lock my ammo machine everything else is open meaning help yourself. If its unlocked its sharing.
---
&amp; always near our camps when we join👍🏻
---
I can't upload them here. (Sorry, I'm new to Reddit) 
---
They are posted in some of the Facebook groups I am in.
---
I don't care, I leave everything unlocked. I like to be generous but to be honest  if I lock shit up i know someone will just try to break into it!
---
Yea I do not use special builds anymore for that reason and I am building a strange combo build to make it more fun for me. I just want it the way it was when the game first came out.. (not the bugs mind you) . I liked the big events were everyone was running around like mindless chickens. I do want them to fix the the AI and most parts of the game also. I think one thing they should add is an arena that has two functions. 1. Endless wave spawner that the mobs increase in level for each round forever. Just try to get as far as you can and your name gets on a leader board each day/week/month. 2.) a PVP arena jump in and its free for all random map sections kinda like the winter one but not battle royal and you join it from a door in game. There is no waiting for players ect.. its just always going.
---
Yeah. It’s a grind. I obtained the shielded plan a couple time during my process.
---
And I started playing somewhere around June.
---
Ohh you know the answer...
---
Afk is hardly playing is it?
---
😂😂
---
I wish we could use the display cases as vendors.
---
Then low levels shouldn't tap my workshops. 
---
Y'all always think I'M the aggressor 100% of the time. I've actually had lowbies bold enough to walk up to me and tap my workshop lol.
---
I got lucky and it was there literally the first time I looked. That said do what other people have suggested and buy the plan. About 6k caps but worth it to save the effort.
---
Buttressed is a separate slot from utility. So for DR and Energy Resist go buttressed. 
---
Utility a lot of people like dense but with the new fire resist legendary perk coming I'd switch either to the new ultra light (coming with patch 22 with the legendary perks) or deep pocketed for total 40 extra carry weight
---
Edit: would recommend jetpack for torso 100%. -1 AP is nothing and the jetpack are randomly useful
---
Just flight of fantasy😂
---
Guess at 413, im a dweeb.  I have one purifier, and its locked.
---
So is all the rest of my stuff.
---
If you are that hard pressed for water, learn to craft a purifier.
---
Ets Fix - patch 24
---
Are we allowed to know your farming route? :)
---
Whenever the servers are fixed, I'm down for it. DM for ign.
---
The way I see it, this is just using traditional Bethesda workaround techniques.
---
lmao yeah
---
Inventory management
---
We can eat some freezer burn in the wasteland. I regularly drink from toilets And i only know the flavor of dogfood.
---
The old codes worked on Xbox.  But PC a lot of trouble.  I will try again soon as somebody managed to launch one when the enclave bunker tickets were glitched so it might be fixed.  
---
No idea as of yet unfortunately
---
I have no idea what you are all talking about!   Lol  not played f76 for over a week.
---
I guess the vibrant silly explosion of color is meant to be in contrast to the horrific colors of the end of the world.
---
Fallout has always had that bittersweet feeling , a brutal cold apocalypse,  but funny party hats and shiny vault suits with it..
---
mods are fun  
---
 [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/643](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/643)
---
Now its just pay-for-useless. I feel like the game hands out atoms at a decent enough rate that the atom store, when used wisely, is pretty fair for everyone.
---
I mean, in some way beatboxing is singing, yknow xD
---
Same thing happens if you side with the Settlers. Radcliffe acts like you made a different decision at the end and so does Jen 🤷‍♀️
---
Going out on a limb here...
---
BUID = Bethesda User ID
---
Seems like an interim indentifier until the account gets associated with an actual Bethesda account.
---
This FAQ touches it on it https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/45320/~/why-am-i-getting-a-upgradeaccountinvalidaccounttype-error-when-creating-a
---
I googled- "buid" fallout
---
I noticed it was superquiet today too, along with zero nukes.   Also noticed twice that people were in a silo and yet nothing ever launched.
---
Yeah that's not what this post is talking about. I said they were following me just attacking me hoping I'd attack back. That makes them the aggressor. No one is saying you can't defend your workshop lmao if you're following people around hoping they attack you knowing you can one hit kill them, then this post is talking about you. If you're defending a workshop from what happens to be a low level, this post clearly isn't about you lmfao
---
I've been calling the number you see in the pipboy Armor Rating since Damage Reduction is the generally accepted term for how much the incoming damage actually gets reduced. It would be clearer if the game used BR and ER for ballistic reduction and energy reduction, instead of DR and ER.
---
What I'm saying is, the damage reduction you get from the number you see in the pipboy, either the ballistic rating (DR in the pipboy) or the energy rating (ER in the pipboy), sees diminishing returns. But effective health vs. damage reduction sees increasing returns. Using the numbers of 0% damage reduction increased to 20% vs. 60% damage reduction increase to 68%, you'd see survivability increases of 1 up to 1.25 for the first, and 2.5 up to 3.1 for the second. It's a smaller percent increase, which is the same thing you'd see for a linear increase of your base health, but it's actually a bigger boost to the number of seconds you stay alive in the face of a given attack (+0.25x vs. +0.6x).
---
This. It ain't Candyland. We're supposed to be in a post apocalyptic world. It's sad that Bethesda watered down so much of the survival aspects. There should be constant threat of death. I miss logging on and sneaking through different areas because I was afraid someone would come mow my lowbie ass down with slap damage.
---
Try all this on pc! My god, majority of players are top class assholes
---
This reminds me of all the high level players coming out of their private servers to do meat week or rather afking the event all day. Now they are back to duping and exploiting the ammo factory.
---
Stop complaining and let the players play the game the way they want to?
---
How dare people sell what they want in their own vendor.
---
If I crouch it works - but occasionally I get spotted at ACP and the Encrypted events somehow.
---
I like spiral.
---
I had some fully modded other weapons and they just say, the ones with at least 1 star usually sold quickly from lower level players.
---
But that sounds like a nice idea too, esp with the fixer and better armor... I think I may keep a set of those on vendor at all times :) Thanks for the idea.
---
Just checked the bunker after reading this and immediately found 2 tech data.
---
How can a nuke cause too much damage?   Isn't that the point?    How did they rebalance them?
---
Tonight after work I’m going right there and trying to find it again. I want the paint jobs
---
The legendary run ended. Season 2 starts next week I believe.
---
Enjoy getting wopsies.
---
Side note: have minimum food and water plus a rad-x/rad away active to get -150% disease resist
---
the end
---
I usually use the pink neon lights and write Free! on a water purifier so people know to just grab it.
---
End of season yesterday

---
Lol, pretty much exact same thing happened to me. Only I was downed by falling debris having made it back inside. Thankfully a kind member of the event team still looting Wendigos revived me. For all that I was rewarded with a 2* Troubleshooting Minigun with 25% FR.
---
I have gotten a few levels just from my cooking binges i do after fat-waddling my way back to camp. And yeah selling the stuff gets me a good way into the cap allowance for the day too which is nice. Another good one to do is purified water. Sells very nice.
---
Fort defiance ammo bags and military duct tape easiest way to get it. What do you play on I have a good bit I can give you
---
Fraid the seasons ended, no SCORE challenges till 15th when patch lands.
---
I played when it first came out but my friends didn't like it and stopped playing. I spent a while being destroyed in higher lvl areas solo and kinda left it at that. Started back up a few weeks ago.  Once my daughter got on I knew it would become a normal for us. Been a lot more fun this go for sure.
---
I have never had a problem getting my ass kicked. I got killed two or three times by someone a couple of days ago. He was a sneak build, invisible, melee that absolutely destroyed me at the Poseidon plant. I would be standing right next to the console, it would say he was trying to take the workshop and then boom, I was dead. It was pretty cool. My turrets got him once though. I was already dead and they shot him up while he stood next to me. I chuckled. 
---
I see no point in getting upset about that. That is the point in the game. Now, when they chase you down and constantly harass you, that is a different story. I switch servers when that happens.
---
You forgot the /s lol
---
Maybe you’ll mature by then. Lol
---
"Here you go my good... lady?" /eyesquint "Could I please get your finest shotgun?"
---
Hands me Medic western revolver.
---
"ah.. no thank you. A shotgun if you please."
---
Hands me a Medic single action.
---
"uh.. no, no thank you. A Shot Gun. Please."
---
Hands me a black powder rifle with furious.
---
"Closer, but no. The one that uses these plastic shells please."
---
Holds up a gamma gun..
---
"Look lady.. I'm trying to be patient here."
---
Umm getting the Survival mode legendary wasn't that hard, if I spent more than 15 minutes total in Survival per character (3 of my older characters have The Unstoppable Monster) and never PvP's with anyone (the few times I even saw another player they were doing the same thing I was, just trying to get the legendary).
---
Fast Travel to a location in Adventure, hop over to survival, do the required thing, hop back to Adventure. A lot of the tasks to get the legendaries were insanely easy things like kill 5 creatures I couldn't tell you how many Opossums and Brahmin died because I wanted whatever the reward was.
---
What pisses me off about the instruments is that they just play some terrible really small loop over and over drives a man insane....... I got a theremin as it fits my comic shop and is the least annoying imo.
---
I sell almost everything for 1-25 caps. Some stuff it’s a bit more, but I’m not kind enough to sell a three star level 50 gun for nothing. I’m hurting for caps tbh but it feels good not making people pay as much as I’ve paid for stuff that I wanted/needed.
---
Its these little green pouches you find them in the asylum and on military places brotherhood places. The best is to look in the fallout Wiki or youtube guides. There are vids on all resurces.
---
I mean just ignore those users, the benefits of text chat significantly out weight the negatives.
---
Is here a video of this by any chance? Thanks for the info
---
Don't put it out with your boots ted
---
Supposed to collect the same junk supplies that were needed by the BoS event. Although I've read players saying that it also collects screws and ballistic fiber - haven't put mine in yet as I am happy getting ammo with my raider one.
---
Yeah but when it’s called a community reward, the entire community should get it, not just people who are online at the time.
---
I find ammo bags in the starting barracks area of all three silos. They’ll scrap down to ballistic fiber
---
Thank you for the link! This will be very useful for me.
---
Hope Todd sees this bro
---
How many mods can you apply on the torso, limbs and arms? Can you do asbestos and buttressed snd deep pocketed on the torso for example if there ox a jetpack already?
---
I'm on PS4
---
100 percent this
---
I sell ALL plans at $22 caps. What do I need them for?  Sometimes I just take them to a newb and drop them because I have so many. “Not another plan for rugs!!!”
---
thank you thank you thank you
---
Yep.   Absolute horseshit.
---
Thank you for the advice!
---
Limited time events and rewards are limited time events and rewards
---
I find vanguards useful when using a heavy vampire weapon. By the time I'm hit a second time I normally heal the damage from the last hit. So I'm constantly getting the full or most of the DR from vanguard. 
---
But that being said this is a very specific situation. Otherwise I agree with your loud short guy analogy
---
There’s a shit ton at camp McClintock, no enemies to kill either. I go, clear the place out and then jump worlds, do it a couple times and you’re sorted
---
Me too. I'll add I'm sure people that still really want it would pay atoms.
---
This is a little misleading. The currency is an added bonus for players hoping for some of the rare items in the crown crates. Say a rare item you want didn’t drop, you can get this item by saving up the currency and selling duplicate crown crate items.
---
ALSO while you're in morgantown i'm just letting you know that Steelheart is fully charged and ready for action.
---
It will still be labeled "conspiracy theory".     
---
heading towards idiocracy at its finest
---
Damn! I was pretty determined to try and finish it. I've never really participated in seasonal challenges in online games, much less actually complete them. I only had to notches left on Chapter 2. Well, better I find out now I guess. What am I supposed to do now?
---
There is no active seasonal event right now, therefore no daily/weekly challenges.
---
Got it now too - really awesome. Thx!
---
Weed, beer and instant ramen makes the world go ‘round.
---
Just spend a month on the trading sub trading up, it’s not hard to get one. I got a JE laser after a month of trading.
---
I want all of this 5800 atoms is a steel already lol
---
Sometimes when one of the turrets gets hit it goes berserk and attacks friendly targets. I don't know if this is intentional (such as the targeting computer is damaged or something). The fix is to let it get destroyed (you can't hurt it but the other turrets and the super mutants can), and when you repair it the turret should be back to friendly. Sadly sometimes nothing attacks it and you're stuck with taking unnecessary damage.
---
I'll give the camp a try!
---
Not when they’re advertised as community rewards. Every other game will deposit rewards to each player, even if it’s a limited time event because they contributed and do not put FOMO on free rewards. Just Bethesda being Bethesda lol
---
Downvote this if you’re racist
---
It should just be 100% reduction, there's no real reason not to. If you are wasting atoms on it, and your food needs to stay in your stash taking up space, at least get rid of the stupid timer. Not like it's hard to get food in this game, it's just a chore and makes it even less worth it to find the specific resources
---
I used about 20 of the legendary modules and got a bloodied faster fireoate one, I used it for a few days then found something new, wish I could trade it to someone who would use it
---
How many mods can you apply on the torso, limbs and arms? Can you do asbestos and buttressed snd deep pocketed on the torso for example if there is a jetpack already?
---
Wish I had some high level people to quest with
---
Play the game, like usual.
---
Wait you people actually say this shit 😬 yikes
---
It is a wonder how people still play this game
---
Not even beat boxing the 2 times I've gotten him to spawn. Unless my audio settings are jacked up. But, it is Bethseda.. so I figured it was just bugged.
---
I've seen that they need identification to be entered. How would I go about acquiring it?
---
Sadly, they've been de-atomized.
---
I missed the bugs thing.   We can't discuss bugs in the game?  WTH?
---
Out of an orange colored sky!!!
---
The calculation gets pretty messy for sentinels and cavalier, since it starts involving probability, and tbh I don't know if it procs on multiple pieces at once, or if additional pieces just increase your chances of getting that 15%. Either way, more is increasingly better since we're talking about actual damage reduction instead of armor rating.
---
...its a boy
---
I've had the same issue with them being very uncommon recently. I've still found a few, but only in locked safes or in the desks in the Whitespring bunker. I don't find them in any other desks or in any file cabinets any more.
---
I also joined the game only just this week and am amazed at how amazing most people have been. Of course I have come across the general trolls but I have met some amazing people too. On my first day I had someone build me a camp, I was give an excavator power suit and so many plans and caps and items. It's been amazing.
---
Yeah its sad. I believe left the join my public team emote in the atomic shop for about a week or so and it’s still there today.
---
Ah, it’s a long quest chain. You should look up something along the lines of enclave quests.
---
The whole settlement building system is a glitchy steaming turd if you want to try and build anything more advanced then a 2x2 cube. It’s so frustrating to use and I’d personally say a way worse system then fo4 settlement building, definitely needs some sort of overhaul
---
What platform do you play on? I've just started playing too
---
It’s doubtful but one can hope lol
---
You are one the greatest minds to ever walk the earth, if not THE greatest.
---
Moocho caps 4 a Chally Mask😎
---
Sounds like you've ruined other people's experiences.
---
Whoosh

Mf’s be bored lol
---
I’m glad so many people can relate to this.
---
 Its worth tagging it in crafting to teach you what has it.
---
 https://imgur.com/8nErxI7

This should keep me occupied for a while. Thank you for the help!
---
I sell mine for 3-4 fr lol
---
I'm too lazy to even bother using the dupe(though I really should) but when I did I only ran it on my private server just in case it does hinder server performance
---
All parts butressed+ SS shieded underarmor.  Gives me DR a bit north of 340, ER and RR both in the 240s.  
---
Combined with the +4 STR from the underarmor...Great for a melee build :)
---
Got lucky and most of my rolls were 3\*, so bonuses (for me) are WR on each piece, one chameleon, one faster AP regen, one poison resistance, and one RR.
---
You can buttress all pieces and have one additional mod to each piece.

Edited the post. Its been like 2 years since I played ESO so I forgot some of the finer details.
---
You can easily eat stuff with freezer burn. Don't be afraid of putting a few hairs on your chest.
---
Not quite sure it would work. This is becoming a real life problem.
---
I have an R rated Playboy center page shot of a Scorchbeast on my Xbox😀😀
---
It doesn’t have any effect that I have noticed.
---
Haven't played ESO in a year now but I think the atom store is nicer and more exciting. ESO shop changes monthly I think and gets quite a drag waiting for anything interesting. Much prefer atom store with weekly updates.
---
I probably spent a bit on the crown crates, was the only exciting thing in the crown store to be honest but the gambling is not fun, gems are a nice help but still had to spend to get any except for free crate giveaways.
---
Not really. I’ve barely joined many public events. I didn’t realise about ‘tagging’ until recently
---
The more time you invest in another character, the less you'll be able to level up legendary perks on any of them.   The slots share across characters, but not the perk coins or perk levels themselves.
---
Line in the sand for a huge xp chunk.
---
It's going to be a long walk back to camp
---
Any other dev would have added the reward into your account for participating, but No, Bethesda has to be Bethesda and time gate a community reward
---
while cooking i got killed by someone who was claiming the camp - sneaking up behind me in stealth armor.  i wasn't a threat (then lvl 25?), so i figured it was a mistake.  a-hole killed me again when i returned and sat down to finish cooking !  unbelievable the things some people do for no reason
---
I'd want those empty metal shelves to be turned into displays. They'd be perfect to create a "lived in" camp. Display random junk items Abraxo etc.
---
Thanks for the info!!!
---
Golf course at whitespring, west tek and maybe fissure prime? I circle those sometimes xp grinding. Or events.
---
Full health junkie's commando build could be fun. High dps for a non-bloodied build and can tank with full health. Keeping ammo in stock is a whole other question...
---
I wish score rolled over ( not gonna happen) cuz I've been done with the run for a month or so and by now I'd be damn near a quarter of the way through season 2 already if not more
---
To be fair it was virtually impossible for non 1sters to contribute to this event, the only resource i ever have 250 of is steel, and i grab everything.
---
Unless they have a sign up saying, "take what you need", I consider it stealing.  You never know when some jerk broke the lock and the owner simply isn't aware of it yet.
---
After opening gifts I always drop the plans at either vault 76 or overseer's camp. Mostly mounted creatures but lots of good prime plans as well. I'm on Xbox (jt2slow). I just opened a bunch yesterday and haven't dropped so hit me up if anyone's interested.
---
Don't lock your doors, what are you afraid of?
---
Its so cool seeing people enjoy the state im from. WV gets trashed talked a bunch, but im glad Bethesda took the effort to highlight the natural beauty of the state
---
I think that they should put them back in for a week once the full event is done for final redemption. I didn't miss getting them, but I think it would be a nice highlight to cap it off.
---
Nuked events like the new one, or ws. Uranium fever is good, radiation rumble, uhhh just mass high level enemies
---
Yep, I'm one of those too.  I sell workshop plans for 1/10 of their base price and weapon/armor plans for 1/5 to 1/4 of their price depending on how rare the plan is.  I have a ton of them sitting around from just doing stuff, so why not help others get a nicer camp/build going?
---
Exactly! Don’t understand why the players can’t use them on pts to test them if Bethesda isn’t going to test them
---
I know... it’s more or less wishful thinking
---
Uh huh.   I built them just so  assholes can have all the water they want and leave absolutely zero for me.   Which happened before I realized locks could be broken.
---
What about those plans for the strangler pa
---
I leave everything unlocked for the sole purpose of anyone in need to swing by and grab it if they want. Enjoy comrades!
---
When you learned about it doesn't change the fact that if you were one-shotting legendaries in public events, you were inadvertently screwing over other players.
---
But it's good that you know now and don't do that anymore.
---
I never repair the turrets. Fuck the warden, I want all those kills for myself. 😤
---
Season 1 has already officially ended, so there are no daily or weekly challenges right now during the off-season period. SCORE does not roll over so if you finished early all those SCORE points you earned after completing rank 100 went into the void. It’s obvious they are not adding atom daily and weekly challenges back.
---
What platform currently has daily and weekly challenges? PC doesn't.
---
The punishment for them having to fake the community challenge completions.
---
Could I completely max rank of pistols and still use assaults for a side weapon/ for fun.
---
 I just want to Be able to be a good player but have fun same time, should I dabble with other guns for now until I'm strong with pistols. 
---
I have a 50 ball pistol with a really good legendary it rips into really high lvl enemies like I beat a scorchbeast lvl 60 and a lvl 40 wendigo so I'm doing ok but need to fix my ammo problem to keep this going and also it breaks after a couple of high level kills or when I use it to save my life from a mob 
---
I really wanted to be ajack of all trades but that isn't available so I choose pistols as my fav type!
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
We had a working silos. Had. Its gone now. Broken.
---
I went through this recently. PvP favors the person being attacked. It levels the playing field regardless of player level. No damage is done until the person being attacked responds with an attack. Then, it is almost whoever shoots first.
---
Haha that's fantastic
---
😀😀😀🤩
---
Note on the stelth armor: if you pass a speech check during a mission, you get it as a reward automatically after the mission completes.
---
No spoilers on details though, sorry
---
I had this problem in the Ra-Ra quest, Beckett quest, the quest with Jen's mum and then the final quest with the Vault. I picked what I would consider the more positive options, and spared everyone related to those quests - but at the end of every one I was told I was mean, or that certain characters had died. It ruined the story entirely for me, and I tend to just not think about it anymore because it feels like nothing I did mattered. Really dissapointing!
---
Guided Meditation gives you many, many ghouls to fight. I have leveled up during that event many times.
---
What do you mean, the gauntlet is the best weapon in the whole game and the plans are soooo rare I’m selling them for 1000 caps, you down?
---
Let's slow down on the "earned" part there, my dude. The numbers ain't exactly authentic.
---
I'm not sure, all I've got is this silly BE 1P gatling Plasma. Can we do 1:1?
---
Yes I’ve gotten all of the bos paint skins and everything else except the welding mask
---
I personally felt these events were too short.  I’m a newer player (~6 weeks of being here) and I barely knew what the current challenge was let alone was prepared to participate though I get it was more for the long time players.  That being said I don’t see why they didn’t stretch these out to being the usual weekly update (Tuesday 12p-Tuesday 11:59a for EST) and then more people could’ve participated and then the rewards could’ve spanned that same range the following week.  The only reason to have such short windows is to try to drum up daily logins which is such a stupid measurement of a game because it creates fomo and also burns players out - I know this because I’ve burned myself out on ESO quite a few times trying to max out events.  Either way the people that missed out maybe didn’t have FO76 as their top priority in life (shame on them!) but Bethesda did put the windows out there for the events and I believe the rewards too so yes this wasn’t some sneaky effort to make people miss it just typical annoying log in every day so we can have our statistics BS.  Sucks for those that missed out and hope you guys are able to snag during S2 from the bullion vendors!
---
Missed It too..
---
There aren't any dailies or weeklies active right now, so I have no clue what you're talking about.

Makes no fucking sense

You don't need flat spots for a semi decent looking camp, mine is in a stream valley :-)

Yep.   Or start gathering that dirty water and wood.   For diluted health items, start gathering caps to buy purified water.
---
I got a bloodied 10% aim 15reload I wonder what the best possible roll is, I’m using this one til I roll a bloodied faster fire gauss mini.
---
Well to be fair the game comms is awful, but my post was about have I fallen into the bloodied, unyielding trap. As I said I probably only killed a few legendaries and the murkqueen after a nuke.
---
I didn't realize that was a thing with the legendary modules. Thanks for the tip!
---
\+1 on the exceptions (Encryptid and Radiation Rumble, though I would like to add Project Paradise); if I can't solo an event, I definitely wait for more to join, but that said, I like your rule of thumb and will take that into consideration. In the meantime, I will continue to turn the jukebox (back) on... until I get the plan. Afterwards, I might just focus on getting in the way of the person who's on the roof.
---
When?
---
Do you feel more ghoulish?
---
To be fair, workshops are fair game for PVP.
---
Monster mash is good too
---
what?
---
oh interesting. i'm playing on xbox.
---
I have never seen the event. What triggers it or is it like a 1/1,000,000 chance
---
none of them do. OP is either severely mistaken or blatantly lying.
---
literally yesterday was the last day for season one. season two starts on the 15th
---
Don’t know shows as an event on my map from time to time
---
fear not - you will swimming in caps before you know it.
---
I never had more than a few k at any give time until I got past L50.    When I managed to save 4 digits, it was immediately spent on those those expensive PA plans....and yea, the bear rug, too : )
---
Once I got past 50, and most of the expensive stuff was out of the way, my balance started creeping up....now average about 21k.
---
  Next time you head to WS, either fast travel, or come on from top of the worls and stay in the trees on the \*left\* side of the road until you get to Blackwater, cut across to WS station, then the WS gate, then the front door.  Its faster than coming in from the new gad side, and you will likely not encounter too many things that'll kill you, if you encounter anyhing at all.
---
Bloodies are rambling cuz radiation ate their brains. They to become zombies soon, dis is why they attack randomly.
---
No one said they weren't. I talked about how I fight off the people that just try to take it and then leave the server, never said they were non pvp areas.
---
If only. They could save themselves a lot of time and money if they put the rewards along with the atom shop on there to test.
---
they were showing up for me until a day or so ago
---
I would give you it if I could it's kinda a piece of shit
---
Run around watoga high school collecting candy but loads and loads of high level ghouls spawn

50 cal is well known for its amazing durability compared to every other gun. Gatling lasers/plasmas are known to break fast, especially the legacy explosive ones.
---
I'd recommend you to obtain flamer for such occasions. Serendipity can't help them evade all the hits from fire.
---
Yeah, I wasn’t being a dick about it or saying you were....I was just saying they weren’t as bad and I expect them.
---
Or have just woke up from a 2 week long coma without realising it.
---
He’s being sarcastic.
---
You mean during Season 1? That has ended, and there are no active challenges available to anyone.
---
Sucks man... we've been asking for this since fallout 4 - nothing from Bethesda yet.
---
Yeah, having to wait like maybe a minute or less is the worst in the world.
---
Me too. Common plan sales for 1 cap to complete the dailies or goes in the blue suitcase at train stations.
---
I think you sneezed on your keyboard at the bottom there but yes I am down to trade pls and thx, it’s a loss on my end but I’m a generous trader
---
Fair point!
---
And season 1 ended yesterday. So now they are gone.
---
With the Armco machine ammo isn't nearly as bad as it was  ... as long as you don't want 50 cal.
---
You won't be OP anymore, and that could be frustrating, but you can still have fun with a more casual build. 
---
Heresy, I know. :)
---
Or you could just build somewhere that's not one of the excessively popular spots. You'll live without having 2 deposits to put extractors on or a lake with 20 large water purifiers, I promise.
---
Ehh they're pretty bad. Destroying everything you've built, taking it, and then leaving is completely pointless. If you want the workshop, fight fo it. Don't clean it out entirely just to leave so I have to clean up your mess.
---
Just make sure you’re in the metal rafters or whatever in the large room where you fight a bunch of them. The second floor is where they spawn.
---
Monster Mash also, but that event can be hard at low levels.
---
I also feel that explosive weapons are unfair too
---
I wish I could find players this awesome on pc.
---
Yes I am
---
It does if you know how seasons work.
---
how so?
---
Thank you for the link!
---
Interesting. On the one hand I don't HAVE to worry about eating and drinking when I'm not fighting but on the other hand it does take away some of the immersion.
---
We all grow from life experiences such as these.
---
Thanks.   Pretty funny actually.
---
I have a high capacity vampire flamer with extra 10% damage while aiming and faster reload, didn't even think about using it lol good idea. Now I will burn them all lmao
---
Dieing because:
---
1. Fast Travel fails causing you to die. 
---
2. VATS misses multiple 95%'s allowing enemies to kill you. 
---
3. You fail to respawn and the game hangs. 
---
4...bonus round...you respawn in a Nuke Zone, double bonus if its directly in to a fissure.
---
I also have an equally valid theory that involves wormholes and multiverse theory.
---
We chatted about this and agree that three days for the BoS Collectron reward wasn't quite long enough. We want to make sure that more of you have a chance to get your Collectrons, so it's going to return for a full week starting with our next Atomic Shop update on Tuesday, September 15.
---
When I built my base I didn't realize how popular a spot it was, it's just across the road from pleasant valley station it has a junk extractor but pretty uneven terrain so not an amazing spot but I don't want to have to move my base again.

&gt; It is a dog-eat-dog, Darwinian survival of the fittest, post apocalyptic wasteland.
---
I mean, not really.
---
In the lore, sure, but the game itself is fairly easy. It's not especially difficult to get power armor, decent weapons, plenty of ammo, easily accessible food and water, or a way to remove radiation. Even if you can't find *all* that, death is fairly forgiving. Survival mode isn't a thing, any more, and this game is far from "Darwinian". You respawn after death, have a chance to reclaim some overall common items that are dropped on death, and pay a few caps for a spawn point. At worst, it's a mild inconvenience. With the talk of removing the negative effects of starving/dehydration, it's only going to get easier.
---
Don't get me wrong, I lock my (single) water purifier because that's all I have at my C.A.M.P., but I'm more than happy to give half a dozen or so to anyone who asks. I don't bother selling or giving away my .38 ammo, I convert it, but I don't mind giving a hefty stack of .38, .308, .45, or 10mm to anyone who needs it. I either don't use those rounds at all or they are so common I don't worry about them. The stack of 4k+ shotgun shells I've had has lasted me for months, and I find them so often that I usually end up gaining ammo from the time I log on to the time I log off. I already have 4 characters permanently full of caps, with my main usually fluctuating between 20-30k-- I don't need to sell ammo at this point, it would just end up eating up space in my stash.
---
To me, it seems like you're taking this way too seriously or, at worst, looking for a reason to be a dick to other players. What you're saying isn't technically *wrong*, you aren't forced to give away your stuff, but you're saying it in a way that makes a bad impression. Believe it or not, that makes a difference.
---
Don’t be so lazy.
---
LOL
---
Nope. Accuracy and durability are still going to be shit.

All the daily op mutations are meant to push you out of your comfort zone and try new things on your build. It's easy to adapt to them. After doing them couple of times on pts they really are not that bad. Every combination so far i have been able to solo with my stealth commando with the time for highest rank.
---
I had quite other problem with those rewards being available only via Survival mode - it actually made it impossible to find enemies there, because 4/5 of the server was after the rewards. There should be no PvE rewards on PvP servers - but the idea of rewarding specific roll for completing a challenge was great one. It just seems better to have PvE rewards being rewarded for PvE activities on PvE servers :p
---
Truth..
---
Good point, I feel better now.
---
Good news!
---
They've given Colletrons away for free twice now though
---
Get back to your bunk bed!
---
That's not how game design works, or microtransactions for that matter. If you're asking them to make quest content you had to buy, you understand how polarizing that'd be? It'd effectively be what we already have except you're paying for the content updates now.
---
That machine is extremely under rated. I don't know how it is for a full auto build but with my lever gun and fixer I get more ammo than I can ever use thanks to the Armco machine. I had 4,000 .45 rounds in my vendor recently just because I couldn't use all of the rounds I was getting.
---
I think gunslinger/commando is going to be good since Tank Killer ends up doing double duty. Commandos have good dps but struggle a bit with ammo so using pistols where you can is beneficial.
---
The only combinations that are really excluded if you want to max out your weapon class damage cards is trying to combine shotguns, heavy weapons, and/or melee, since they're all strength, rifleman and commando since they're both perception, or gunslinger/guerrilla since they're both agility. Also going power armor and melee is a little problematic because I find the need to run Traveling Pharmacy, which forces me to give up a melee damage perk set.
---
Here are my builds if you're interested:
---
[Rifleman/Heavy](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=dd33e73&amp;d=pp2ic4lt2i12s12eh2ip2sq2s32sr1sb2s01pd2pk2pl2p60an2s72ao0cu2&amp;n=Heavy%20Rifleman) (instigating black powder rifle, final word, TSE lever action (that's not so good, instigating or junkies would be better))
---
[Slugger/Commando](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=ff53b25&amp;d=pg2ph2pp2sm2s42ss2ee2ic4lt2i12pi2pr2se2a01s12eh0l71sb2c81&amp;w=sn2&amp;m=cf8h&amp;wp=w2&amp;wm=1b2133&amp;ad=0478a&amp;n=Swinging%20Commando) (junkies bone hammer, instigating super sledge, anti-armor fixer)
---
[Gunslinger/Shotgunner](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c9938a5&amp;d=pb2pc2ee2so2sp2sd2ad2ak2al2lt2ic1i12ej4cu2l71s12sb2pp2ar0&amp;w=eh2es1&amp;ad=0478a&amp;n=Jay%20Dub) (quad double barrel, junkies gauss pistol, junkies 10mm, and I'm looking for an instigating pump action or combat shotgun for stealth)
---
Very fair point. I do often feel that the ‘product’ isn’t performing well in that sense also. I think I’m almost desensitised to it to an extent!
---
That's one of the most popular spots in the game.
---
My advise is move. Take it from someone who had a camp there for 2 weeks.
---
If you want another location with a junk spot I can recommend south of Whitesprings to the right of the memorial is a spot my camp has been at for at least 2 months.
---
You underestimate the power of hard pee pee. When you're level 420 in full SS when else are you supposed to do? (Besides being a good person and enjoy the game without being am annoying prick)
---
Oh I got plenty of hair, now I want something that tastes good!
---
I've heard antiarmor was going be better than now, comparatively speaking. I've been stocking up on those. I'll have to keep my eyes open for any two shot also, thanks for the heads up. I dont think I've ever actually had any two shot drop for me, at least in awhile. Strange.
---
Anti-Armor would be the least affected, but I think it's still inferior to Junkie's in net damage (especially if you're stacking armor piercing from other sources).
---
Splatting all the mobs in hold the line. Could barely get any
---
Your squad sounds amazing. I hope to connect with people like this in game someday!
---
I highly disagree. I'm a level 213 bloodied build and I have 500+ stims I need to dilute using purified water.
---
I guess you haven't tested Carki-/Herbivore mutation with Strange in Numbers. You get crazy good stat boosts from food, look into it
---
Hey, mentioned this [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ipe2es/thank_you_for_putting_the_bos_collectron_up_for/) as well, but the short version is we agree! The BoS Collectron is coming back for a full week with our next Atomic Shop update on Tuesday, Sept 15 so that everyone has another chance to pick it up.
---
You are correct, I forgot Project P.
---
I'm so glad that they added it. I just plug a keyboard into my Xbox. Learned some of the chat commands, can easily use chat all the time. I haven't played in a while, but that's where a lot of my guild chat and trading on zone happened

99%, and food needs to stack.

This probably rings true for a lot of people. 
---
I don’t find a great deal I like in the store anymore. Someone else said here if they placed a clean toilet in the store it would be gold, and I’m not going to lie that’s the kind of shit I would buy (pun intended).
---
Yeah and if you don't have a friend you trust it means you gotta buy a second account. They had the chance to link the scrap box account wide but didn't i mean its unlimited why not share between characters?
---
Burrows, run through, server hop repeat, scrip legendaries and repeat.. if you max out intelligence as much as possible you’ll level up several times an hour.
---
You don’t even need to run through it all.. I usually avoid the area where you go to get to the robots.
---
I tried googling "fallout 76 Buid" and I found no results. Thank you for taking the time and helping me.
---
True, but my statement is also true.
---
Bethesda wants to rule your entire life.
---
yeah. and sometimes it happens when swapping stuff between characters and you sometimes lose it all. It's FAB
---
And how a gun can barely last longer than a few mags.  Who knew they were so disposable?
---
Use it well, brother. For the Enclave! For the America! Purge this land; bring glory and prosperity to this nation!
---
I generally leave it because resources are so easy to come by, and most of the time I'm in a camp I'm unloading weight so I can carry more legendaries. I have two level 0 locks in my camp so that if someone wants a bounty they can get it. However if I see super overpriced stuff in someone's camp and I've got lock pick I'll probably lock pick their stuff for the fun of it.
---
I prefer to live like a civilized scavenger, thank YOU!  :)
---
On its face with no other perks Junkies does on average 4% more damage than AA on PTS.
---
Bro, I’m already getting triggered just thinking about it
---
Bloodied&gt;Junkies=AA&gt;Furious&gt;TS
---
TS does close the dmg gap with the update. Basically junkies=AA=furious=TS in regards to theoretical max dmg, but the negatives for TS are still the worst of the bunch especially the accuracy issue which can kill the dmg boost.
---
Got it, thanks for response.
---
Send me a friend request. Gamertag is same across everything. NedReckGames
---
oh sweet. moving there now.
---
I think I'm just gonna find a spot that gets decent traffic for my vendor has decent terrain and is close to a vendor, don't really need a junk extractor anymore, thanks though.
---
There are still a fair few character and world challenges with atoms. They’ve even increased the reward for some. 
---
Dailies and weeklies however have gone. 
---
For a higher level most will already be greyed out.
---
I think that's what it comes down to ultimately. The product isn't 'finished' or 'complete' in a sense and that's what upsets people. If the game was polished more and not as buggy and had less glitches, people would be more accommodating of micro-transactions. 
---
Also, for your last statement, Bethesda have been known for having bugs and glitches in games but the community loved it has they become a meme and they are more acceptable in single player games. For us who have played their games in the past, we expect and find fun in alot of these bugs and glitches.
---
Don't have a cow man.
---
For anyone still having an issue with this bug, I just server hopped half a dozen times, and got a server where it worked (on xbox). I did t fuse first, and terminal second.
---
Where? I’m a bit confused sorry
---
I have a date with her tonight. Fingers crossed, I get lucky.   Wait, that didn't come out right...
---
Underground in harpers ferry
---
I remember the datamine group had released one for the Fasnacht one, not sure if there's a collectron loot pool table for all different settings.
---
I remember reading about them ending up in the atom shop
---
I’d love to!  I don’t know how to add friends. My Xbox name is the same as my Reddit name.
---
They mentioned something about certain items being available in the shop like the Ammo converter. I know a lot of people would appreciate it
---
Yeah I've heard the damage hierarchy won't change, it will just be less beneficial to have a junky/bloodied build than before.
---
Some will. For example, they already announced that the Ammo Converter will be going the Reg's Bullion shop.
---
There are 2 easy ways to do it: the old method using the camera view and another method I believe not many other people are aware of (it's an exploit not a hack). If Bethesda had a bug bounty (ha!) then I'd tell them but nah.
---
Why?
---
You won't get banned, enjoy your presents.
---
Most of this was pretty much common sense. Don't be a racist, don't be a bigot, don't throw expletive showers at people, don't be a general dick, don't cheat etc.
---
My issue came when they were talking about 'hindering other players gameplay in ANY way'. You can get fucked, right there. That is entirely subjective. I took a kids workshop, and he's salty? "He's hindering my gameplay!". Someone doesn't like that I won't trade them something, or they can't scam me? "He's hindering my gameplay!"
---
Don't even get me started on them selling/sharing your information whenever THEY deem fit, based on your relationship with them. 100% illegal, especially with privacy laws already in place, and an in-game ToS doesn't supercede those laws, thankfully.
---
The blanket statements made in the new ToS are dangerous, and in the right case actually open Bethesda up to litigation, not protect them. It would behoove them to redo this ToS with less blankety statements that aren't up for misinterpretation. As it stands, they're sticking their toes in boiling water... I'm waiting for them to fuck with the wrong player, and have their asses raked across the coals for thinking this 'Woke' bullshit will fly.
---
Well im hoping all items do, at least in rotation, so people get the chance.
---
fallout community is wholesome. just sayin
---
Yeah that’s a point. 
---
I think this is the first BGS game I’ve played without mods and community patches. 
---
Or the occasional quick save, tgm, murder an entire city, tgm, load save cycle because a guard said ‘ooo let me guess, someone stole your sweet roll’ and I snapped.
---
We really could have used those detonators. I understand why you did what you did, but still.
---
Go on...
---
That's good to know at least, guess I'll just have to wait and see if the hit is too serious on my plasma though, cause if it is I'm definitely out until they fix that, my character is completely focused around X-01, and all the plasma legendaries I spent far too long farming and buying from other players, not to mention how expensive that ammo is lol
---
I play the way you just described, more or less. What I probably failed to get across is not that players should or should not lock things or give things away. It’s that players should lose the sense that they are entitled to any other player’s stuff. If you, like me, are the type to give things away freely, then that’s good and you should do that. If you’re not, then you shouldn’t be harassed for it. By harassed, I mean outside the mechanics of the game, i.e. through chat or on Reddit. By “mechanics of the game,” I mean that if you don’t like someone’s locked purifiers or 1c ammo, and you want to pick their locks or even nuke their camp, DO IT! It’s okay to act like a Raider in this game, in my opinion. I, for one, play these games for the escape from reality it grants me. I enjoy being someone else for a couple hours. When I constantly hear people whining about not getting what they incorrectly feel entitled to, it annoys me because it reminds me of reality, where that same sense of entitlement is so pervasive. That’s all I’m saying here, maybe poorly.
---
Dang I’m on Xbox
---
Glory to the Enclave, and glory to MODUS because he's the shit lol
---
I don’t understand how these things are even a issue when they can use a lot of what eso does with currency, stash box and a universal scrap box but on eso it’s the crafting bag.
---
Do you know how that gap changes when you add Tank Killer+Stinging Magazine, or Stabilized, or Incisor?
---
Yeah I heard the same thing, I plan on collecting as many AA and TS guns as I can. I wouldn't be surprised if a decent amount of people end up redoing their builds.
---
Happy Birthday 🎁🎊
---
And a card holder.
---
I mean, his user is xxxobamaxxx with raider flair. I'm not surprised in the least.
---
Ok.
---
Why do you even have to go to the atomic shop to claim it?  I mean, we got it done so we earned the damn thing. Why can't it just appear in the crafting menu?
---
wait, theres more than just 2???
---
Limited times though.  3 days only to redeem the BoS.  Already there are lots who were busy with IRL that didn't have time to (pardon the pun) collect the item.
---
When I came back to the game after wastelanders, I had to pay for the collectron.  I obviously missed the original one.  They need to have then available for new players coming in.  It's a big staple of every camp.  Now one would argue they removed the free atom challenges.  So aquiring one is a lot harder now.
---
Multiple characters say shit, at least two say fuck out loud, and even Weasel cracks a good 'Fornicate you, friend!". There's already ample cursing in-game, so the idea that adult players shouldn't curse is laughable.
---
I fully get that. Murdering a city's inhabitants was my favourite pass time. Along with using exploits to make a dagger do insane damage.
---
I love being right :)
---
Nukes also causes players to feel upset when someone killed the queen too fast before others could tag the queen with lead pipes and assaultron heads, the rebalancing will calculate the chance for the queen to spawn. If there are too many high level players on the server, the queen will simply not spawn so that nobody will feel upset. This is much needed rebalance and will bring even more quality of life improvement than the broadband weapons nerf.
---
It's what they should've done for all utility items. Made the base version available for free through an event or a loot drop and add the skins to the atom shop. But we're way past that ever being a thing now.
---
Yeah that makes sense. It will be interesting to see if the makeup of the community (build wise) shifts in any particular direction.
---
Wow a race card? Really?

Need to up the amount stored, allow items to stack and increase the time it takes items to spoil, and allow it to apply to vendors if you have it in proximity to them so people can sell perishables without them becoming spoiled meat/fruit.
---
I see. still not very useful for me tho. Im lvl 200+ and dont care about leveling up or rest of the perk cards I havent picked yet, nor the repeatable part of the SCORE really much.But it would be useful for legendary perk cards in the future i guess, where we will scrap perk cards for points.
---
Thank you. I will try it.

That would be great but it would depend on the materials cause I have almost no flux if it requires that then I wouldn’t be able to but I appreciate the offer so much either way :)

Utility items from season 1 will be in the bullion shop.
---
Silencer has no texture
---
What about armor skins n the like?
---
No worries. I'll see if I have enough flux to cover it if need be
---
Before Bethesda overhauled the NPC vendor inventories, the jet pack plans weren't this easy to find and thus more valuable. Same with the Handmade plan. Player vending through machines wasn't even a thing yet. But since then, you can find the plans at different locations *and* way better end-game armor options were added so PA has lost a lot of users to those.
---
can we really built at temmates workshop ? :D That i never tried
---
They haven't said anything about them.
---
I leave my water purifiers unlocked for anyone visiting to take. I lock my collectron and lead extractor. Go find your own lead deposit.
---
I asked for a pension, but all I got was tension.
---
Anywhere with Super Mutants so West Tek, Huntersville, Abandoned Bog Town, Isolated Radio Array, and Harper's Ferry make for a good run.
---
~~As much of a dick he was for annoyingly meleeing you, it doesn't absolve you of being a dick by one-shotting every legendary.~~ misread who was one-shotting.
---
If you don't have the weight to spare for a weaker weapon, fine, just let other people hit it first. I'm almost level 350 Junkie's build and I still go out of my way to wave people over to the legendary and bash it instead.
---
Good thing you don't mind because at least 60% or more didn't donate a thing yet claimed every reward so far.
---
Yupp you could, but there is a better option if your okay with some damage loss.
---
The damage cards for each weapon type start at 10% and increase by 5% for each rank.
---
That means 3x max rank damage cards give you a 60% dmg increase at a cost of 9 slots.
---
But 3x one star damage cards give you a 30% boost and only cost 3 slots. Half the boost, but a third of the cost.
---
That means you could slot max damage for pistols (60%), one star damage for rifles(30%) and tank killer maxed (which after patch 22 helps pistols too) for 15 perception slot cost. This leaves 0 room for QoL perks or concentrated fire.
---
Another stack is 3x one star pistols(30%) 3x one star rifles (30%) tank killer and 1-3 star concentrated fire.
---
A good chunk of your damage with pistols / semi rifles is going to come from headshots and crits, so unfortunely agility &gt; perception and I usually max agility with my build before/if I do max perception, so you might not have 15 points to put into per.
---
I usually run 1 star / 2 star damage perks to open up room for picklocking, other QoL perks and situational stuff like glow sights.
---
Honestly almost all builds can be viable at end game, some definitely do better than others.
---
I am much the same as you, I play to have fun not to see how much damage I can do, match your cards to the way you want to play or the drops you get and you'll be rolling over enemies in no time.
---
What system are you on? Maybe I can help set you up.
---
Seriously, I would not consider making any changes at this  point. With Bethesda, you really have to read the fine print- very closely.   The statement they put out made this "nerf" sound more like a first draft of an ongoing weapon re-balance.  I don't think they are anywhere close to being finished with making changes to weapon damage.
---
100% duped
---
WOW I AM CHAPPED. I didn’t even know this thing existed because I’ve been so tied up with trying to figure out shit in my life that I missed it. Bummer my BOS dude would have loved the for his camp.
---
They talked about adding them to the bullion shops, not atomshop (on pts they are already in there).
---
Unfortunately, licensing Ring of Fire with Johnny Cash and Take Me Home, Country Roads with John Denver probably costs more than all the other music licenses for the game put together.
---
I definitely would - I'd expand it to show me my existing Pipboy as well, so I could see and tinker with my SPECIAL and other stats, and do other stuff offline during the day while I'm at work or otherwise not in front of my PS4.
---
Ultimately though, this would potentially stop you logging in as often, which Bethesda don't want, so I suspect we'll never see this.
---
i  just have really shitty luck with events spawning in  i usually spend abt 20 mins server hopping trying to find mire events but theyre never happening
---
I trade them to my friends pretty often tbh
---
They were talking about bullion vendors, not atomshop. Not once have they said anything about atomshop.
---
Better then trying to bash and forgetting your using a cursed pickaxe oops I left in shame and dishonor lvl 190 fml 🙃 😅  build was fun but its fr only viable for big enemies queen and for the love of God dont 1hit th imposter sheepsquatch Infront of everyone they dont like that unless you wait
---
Awesome, thank you.
---
Shut up Sanjay! No one likes you! You're second only to the mayor of Grafton.
---
Though still upvote for the comment. Had a goid chuckle.
---
A lot of people seem quite taken with Deathclaws so I'm not surprised this one turned its charm on you.
---
Ah, well. Regardless, though, I appreciate the kindness.
---
Duped, but enjoy.
---
Did you hit up the Giant Teapot in Chester yet?
---
I've always found it very sad that the disease healing water is not in Berkeley Springs as it should be.
---
My TSE minugun is better on live servers than PTS, so, as it sucks in live servers...... what do you think  :-)
---
(It's great with magic armour piece, but that's patched in PTS)
---
Me and one other person did this mission alone. With some awesome teamwork it went smoothly. This is an easy mission if you know what you’re doing.
---
Same, sounds like a great location!
---
Where at? Because I call bullshit
---
Bonus: even tho the friendly fire perk shows a flamer they still don't work to heal things
---
That RNG weirdness is something else. I bought four modules yesterday to create space for scrippinv and dailies before the sale and made four SS left legs. Two of them were unyielding with endurance, and one had reduced chem weights and the other reduced junk weight. 🤷‍♀️
---
Levels are meaningless above about 50.  Its not like you get any stronger.
---
In terms of random trades I once dumped 10-15 at 10-15 caps per scrip cause I was loaded with crap from the purveyor after scripping all I could for the day
---
Other than that a few here and there
---
Not yet. I haven't made my way through all the map to learn what is real versus what isn't... and if it is real, is it something we can visit. I wanted to go to Wavy Willards but from what I can find, that isn't a real place but is instead based off an old public pool

So I'm hanging in Silo Charlie right now.  Was helping someone else run the silo and didn't realize there was an issue with the codes.  Any chance this will get fixed soon so I can launch or am I just SOL and should just leave.
---
I would think the slayer type weapons/armors will become more valuable
---
I already carry a TShooters gun and 1 armor piece because.. fukka ASSaultrons...
---
I could see myself picking up mutantslayers gear as well once 1wasteland shits on us
---
Bethesda out here like “did you ask for a nerf?”
---
Was in a work meeting today with some folks from cali and they said "its orange outside". They were not kidding, apparently. Very cool.
---
A lot of folks would be extremely grateful if the entire BoS collection (beret, banner, fatigues) could also return for that period.  
---
It’s a difficult time and not everyone who participated and donated were able to claim their rewards.
---
It would mean so much to those people in this wonderful community.  And it was a community effort, after all.  We should all want everyone to have the items if they want them.
---
Still. At times like this let's joke about racism.  /s
---
I put a camp north of site v9 where everyone gathers for SBQ.  It’s great except I end up having my camp nuked once a week cause if they really position the nuke awkwardly, they can hit the fissure and my camp together.
---
So so handy! A long time ago, in a wasteland not so far away... If you logged off then on again, wearing Excavator PA, you got an extra 100lbs carry weight on top of all it's other bonuses. That was the greatest thing since sliced tinned Cram!
---
Lol
---
When I was level 30 which was like 2 weeks ago a level 300 gave me a full set of X-O1 and a boatload of guns and materials just because he was bored
---
I have kept raider radio man around the longest because I kind of like his vocal exercises and I needed someone to put a BoS uniform on and man the camp. The fact that he sits at a radio is great.   
---
But I wish I could go to the ally and say "could you please not say the same stuff over and over no offense"
---
Were visiting our* grandma. Corrected it for you comrade
---
Well from what I understand, all weapons are taking a hit. TS and AA are taking the smallest hit as they utilize fewer multiplicative bonuses. So while a TSE isn't getting any better, a lot of other guns are getting worse (to a higher degree than TS weapons). That's atleast what I've taken from it.
---
Hmmm maybe you’re right. They did have a pip boy app for FO4 that was basically what you’re describing and I was soooo bummed when they stopped supporting it! When you used the app your phone screen looked exactly like the display in game so you could place your phone in the replica pip boy that came with the collectors edition and it functioned like the real thing! Now I just have a replica pip boy with no screen :(
---
I don't know about the others but I think they brought the Scorchbeast icon back a few months after the 'kill scorched' event.. I missed the BOS banner thing cuz I took a break, stuff we EARNED needs to stay available longer than a few days....
---
Definitely worth it especially with the ammo converter, I havent crafted ammo in weeks and I have about 25K .50 cal, 5K 5.56, 5K 308, 10K .45, and about 1K 10mm. for some reason it makes 556 quite faster than others and i find it full 200 often. keep it unlocked at my camp so people who need it visits me and perhaps check out my vendors :3
---
I just wish they could retrieve a bit more information *before* you joined a server.  They don't even have basic stuff like "Is this server full?"  Let alone "Are these coordinates blocked by a CAMP?"  Or "In a nuke zone?"  That sort of data should be known before it attempts to make the connection in the first place.
---
Perhaps there is some technical reason why they can't, but as a substitute, having the option to place the user's CAMP *when it can* wouldn't be a bad idea either.  If whoever is currently blocking the space logs off, just stick my CAMP there.
---
Wasn't defending him, just making a remark about his maturity.
---
Exactly
---
He has a point. I, too, would rather not have the pipboy on my arm.
---
Could you please quietly pass onto the team to better manage the manager who keeps making these boneheaded calls you keep having to change due to public embarrassment? You know, gently push back &amp; get them to actually make sensible decisions. 
---
There isn't a single person in the community who thinks releasing these rewards for three days was a smart move. Even dumber to not give plenty of warning upfront and everyday for those 3 days.
---
If you could do us this solid Valseek, that'd be very much appreciated.
---
Did you read the post? Cause it says his friend one shot all the legendaries, meaning I got no legendary weapons or armor drops because of it. Because he was one shot killing them all. And then they followed me around meleeing me afterwards so he could try to kill me. But yeah I'm at fault lmao
---
Sounds like Cornholio from Beavis and Butthead. "Tee pee for my bunghole!"
---
Is scrap box still fallout first only?
---
Oh no... you won't be able to absolutely demolish everything. That is terrible.
---
This is great to hear!
---
Yeah it’s nuts but I got my full set. No weight reduction But all sneak ones which at the time I was mad because I always built my character around carrying the most. I have played since beta and prob Scrapped so many god tier guns and I’ve sold legacies to vendor bots back in the day before player trading. Because for one I didn’t know they would be taken out and for two I only used the weapon that I had ammo for or did most damage and at the time without messing with perk cards it was my two shot ultrice gat laser. And I used carry weight glitch so I was so overweight I dropped everything or sold it. Took a six month break and came back and started messing with perks and making it to where I could carry the most. But it wasn’t until I got a two star bloodied combat I changed my whole build around and then got lucky enough to get bloodied fixer and realized the sneak ones where my best rolls. If I get carried away with hoarding like I do, I have a nocturnal ss right leg with weapon weight reduction and a chameleon marine armor left leg with weapon weight reduction. I truly love how I have changed my whole build around after two years and I’m still learning ways to perfect it. So yeah rng is crazy but it’s also makes it a better feeling when you roll that amazing piece.
---
Of course they don't encourage breaks from the game. The whole game is designed for you to log in at least an hour a day. The moment you feel as if you can safely step away is a moment when you may realize you don't want to come back.
---
Probably to get a couple more perk cards/coins on deck for 22.
---
*bubbling bong sounds intensify*
---
Unfortunately for me, I am fully-primed, so I can't use it to make my ammo.
---
They still have played longer and most likely have far better gear, especially better legendaries. So no it's not entirely meaningless. Shows who's most likely been playing longer and most likely has better gear because of it. Not always true but in my experience it tends to be the case. And they should definitely have better things to do than bother lower levels, especially when I'm not even in the hundreds and he and his buddy we're almost 300.
---
I am on Xbox! I've found a site for builds and one is for pistols I might mimic it when I get to max rank and merge new ideas into it, i even got fallout first to get a movable camp to stack stuff fast and enemies all seem to mostly match my level in my server even though it's just me in the world I do it for the less lag also. I will not be getting the subscription again as by then I'll be ahead and can maintain myself better later on. And the fact it's not worth the money I just wasted but ah I'll look at the bright side lol
---
It really bothers me that some manager at Bethesda thought that making a community reward availble for only 3 days was a good idea.
---
Why is it that the community makes better decisions than what are supposed to be industry leading game devs?
---
It worked! Thank you so much kind sir/madam/robot or etc.
---
It was for pc on eBay
---
I understand that Bloodied builds are the current meta, and in my own way, I do a similar build with PA and shotgun using VATS  a lot. But rather than being a glass cannon that dies when a random ghoul smacks you from behind, I find it more fun jumping into mobs and thinimg them out one by one. Basic enemies such as ghouls, scorched, mole miners are one shots, Yau Guai, Deathclaws and Mirelurk Kings are 2 or 3 shots, with the traditional Sheepsquatches, Mirelurk Queens, and Scorchbeasts requiring a different approach than shotgun and VATS. Throw in legendary and you have to work a little harder, but not not by much. If playing a public event  all you have to do to avoid one shotting the legendaries is to not VATS them, shoot normally and step back (which in the middle of a SBQ fight, clearing the ground creatures and a 3 star Yau Guai rushes you, is a little harder to do)  it does take a little practice to NOT simply VATS and shoot, but it does avoid pissing people off.
---
If you're considering a complete change from bloodied sneak style, perhaps look into Vampire based weapons to allow you to get into big mob fights without worrying about your health too much.
---
Hey I’m level 19 just starting off is there anyway I could nab a couple of those
---
Thank you for explaining all this to me, I didn't knew anything you just mentioned. Really appreciate it
---
I remember that app. I think I used it early game to spam stimpaks when I didn't know what I was doing. Didn't they market it as somebody sitting next to you managing chems and food mid fight, that sort of thing?
---
in that sense, to save ammo, go melee then. Furious is pretty good. (I use furious fixer. Headshots, legshots usually kills or cripples or significantly dinks the enemies. No need to artifically lower your HP to gain magical damage bonus, which is what, no more than double.
---
put a silencer on a handmade and just crouch headshot (or legshot) enemies, you would do 2x damage anyway. and in case some enemy sneezes on your way, you would tank some damage and live.
---
My bad for $7 anf another for $10
---
Screenshoting your message for future reference thank you, you've been very helpful
---
No you don’t have to do that! I just got off but I’ll be back on later! I’ll try to grind out some flux then.  Thanks again
---
They were letting people into the TNT Dome officially during Mothman Festival last year. That's another thing worth seeing.
---
I have to arrange a couple hundred pounds of empty space in my stash and dump stuff so I can get in power armor with a little carry capacity for materials. You only need an active nuke zone for the stabilizing materials. 
---
If you have the time to wait, you can drop a nuke for flux and let the nuke zone cool off (2 hours) while you do other stuff.  Then you can harvest the flux without worrying about rads.
---
You're more than welcome.
---
Thank you for listening to us :)
---
Super sorry, I misread that and thought it was your friend doing the one-shotting.
---
What's with this copy pasta? I already saw this exact post yesterday.
---
To be fair, it's only powered. Who's to say it actually has any Freon in it?
---
Also, always check the official forums first. The CMs are more active there and your much more likely to get a response from them there or see an official response vs here which is more fan based.
---

---
Nope. Junk is garbage. Just carry what you will use.
---
Raid ammo extractors for ammo
---
I thought stash dispensing machines didn’t take up extra budget after patch 20? Did the fridge not get included?
---
Reeee
---
Sorry, I am new. What does aa stand for?
---
Honestly I can’t remember the marketing on it and don’t think I used it until I had played for awhile...I just remember coming across it in the app stope one day and thinking how cool it was to have my own pip boy lol. I feel like they could have made it something significant to this version of the game especially just due to the online nature of it.
---
Even my pristine nuka cola machine still counts against my budget so I don't think so. My base is literally so full my machine stops filling at 13/15.
---
That's a big oof. And then there's people like me who contributed absolutely nothing because I didn't know what this event was and now I got an annoying protectron that insults me and my camp lol
---
Anti-Armor
---
You clearly haven't played this game long enough.  Time does not equal better gear or being more capable at the game.  There are literally only like 5 weapons in the game that matter and none of them have anything to do with skill to obtain.  Either someone hands one to you or you trade someone for it.  All the other guns and builds pale so much in comparison, that you're just needlessly making yourself suffer for no reason at all.  Once you do have one or more of those 5 weapons, then it's about trying to find something to occupy your time, as there is nothing else to "get" in the game, other than meaningless bobbles that no one will ever really look at anyways but for a second while they use your vending machine for the buy/sell item to player daily.  High level just means more jaded and generally less friendly person to play with, if they aren't, they choose to be blind to their surroundings.
---
Haha you're welcome fellow vault dweller
---
Please tell me English is only your third language.
---
Just so u kno in the upcoming update to get legendary perk cards u need extra perk cards to get perk points. Might not be great time to change ur special points around until you see if u want any of the legendary perks.
---
I don't even try to sell them any more. Used to sell missiles, mini nukes, and 40mm grenade rounds for 1 each and they still wouldn't go. Now I just drop them in the middle of my own floor like a fucking barbarian, and they stay there till I log off.
---
Thank you comrade
---
just focus on 1 faction while doing dailies for both, there is very little negative faction rep whatever you do.
---
Bugged out atm. For now you’re better off not launching any nukes or looking for someone who was able to launch successfully since they will keep the code they entered throughout the week
---
Get a life
---
Its all good. I wouldn't do that and I wouldn't team with people who do that, there's no reason to hog the legendaries. I don't have very many good legendaries yet either so I'm always trying to get them and uranium fever is a good way to ensure a few drops until a guy like that shows up and just takes them all for himself. Its a major bummer
---
Can confirm.  Tried all three silos with different failed experiences at each.  Yeah, OP, agree.  We launch 3 or more damn near every day.
---
No, you can have 1 Resistance Mod (Buttressed) and 1 Utility Mod (Dense, Asbestos, Deep Pocketed, Jet Pack)
---
If you did the van Lowe quest you can craft the assaultron recal cards you need to start the event
---
Thought you were talking about the season reward fireplace door, that's under doors. But generally all fires, candles and lights are under Lights
---
Well we have pizza rolls that are useless to herbivores.. so there is that.
---
Most likely they will not based on precedent. 
---
For a company that loves milking the cash out of anything they can sell, they really don’t like circulating event specific items after they’ve been used. We have yet to see the max son outfit and piper return, no suggestion that players can earn the mountain scout uniform in the future, and lots of other skins that were rewarded at certain times in game history that haven’t resurfaced.
---
If there isn’t a utility to the item, I wouldn’t expect it to return.
---
I think there's bigger problems in this game then people being too busy to claim free rewards
---
The mighty pepperoni roll
---
For what it's worth, I've been rocking some sort of suppressed pipe revolver since day one - I'm currently level 65 (I think, haven't checked in a while). It's still my primary weapon for sneaking around an encampment picking off enemies, packs a decent punch with headshots and Concentrated Fire, and the ammo is plentiful (.45 rounds).
---
It very easy to start, just have to buy a recall keycard from a vendor, fix it at a tinker bench, then start the event on the computer at the site...it’s getting the right people there with you to complete that’s the hard part!! I have a card ready to go and am down to do it tonight!
---
DMV, Golf Course, Westek, NIRA, Huntersville.  Rinse and Repeat.
---
I would love an equipment slot to replace the current way we equip armor In fo76  that be major QOL update
---
Pipe is life...
---
Very neat idea, but too much work for not much to gain. also there are already vendor machines, and it could be problematic for new players to understand whats going on and you might lose some sales. Im sure vendor allies would move away and even disappear :D We would need somethging like Beckets bar tho, which would defeat the purpose i think.
---
I forgot this one, it is definitely a good spot.
---
Make sure you fill your scrap box as much as possible while your subscription is stil active. You can still take from your scrap box after your sub runs out, you just cant add anything new.
---
Too bad im on ps4, but you should check out the filthy casuals and the pkoa subreddits, both groups are amazing, pkoa is more RP oriented.
---
She's a national treasure, that woman.
---
The gap shouldn’t change at all if you’re equipping the same perks to each, since it will no longer be multiplicative
---
I modded the game to remove doors so I don't have to fuss with photomode
---
I will say at least that type of griefing does provide some level of grief.  not that that's good but slightly more effective than intentionally getting shot by people in passive mode.
---
Thank you so much! Sorry for the stupid question
---
Your very welcome, shoot me a dm if you ever have another question and ill see if I can help.
---
They've tried twice &amp; this is sadly the best that they could do.
---
You'd think it logical to keep trying until you get a world that is free or say none of the world's are free the first time you develop this but this is Bethesda we're talking about.
---
MODUS wants you dead mate.
---
Word of advice: DO NOT  limit your search to the damn white springs bunker.   Sure, you should look there, but  there's countless other places to look.  If you don't check them all, it will take forever to get all the paints.  [Here is a great thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ba3oyb/technical_data_hunting_some_tips_and_data/) on farming tech data and all the places you should check. 
---
It took me an insane amount of grinding and I farmed every single one of those locations daily.  If I only had checked white springs once or twice a day, I would have never gotten them all.
---
Thank you so much! Are people usually interested in doing it or no?
---
Luckily I’m going from heavy to melee so no switching has been done
---
Stock up on Legendary Modules from the Purveyor. You'll need them for crafting the new Legendary Weapons/Armor, via Plans bought with Gold Bullion, which becomes available after the Wastelanders quest line. Get working on building Rep with both factions asap, as you'll then unlock the new gear.
---
Man the nuka cola machine, and drink dispenser, Halloween candy bucket, etc shouldn’t be counting towards budget for items inside. Bethesda strikes again
---
Pretty sure Bethesda mentioned they will be patching the accuracy a bit on TS. Can’t remember where I saw it, maybe a forum post. Formula P can fix that problem though!
---
If I leave it unlocked, it is for you to take.
---
I mean it's obvious I haven't played long when i make it obvious I haven't and am getting harassed by those who have. Also, I'm not the type to think the only point in playing is to get the best of the best stuff and then do nothing else. I enjoy helping other people progress, I enjoy finding new items, whether they be cool weapons or good items for display. The events are enjoyable. Lots of stuff to do besides harass people. If you think all there is to do is get the best items, that's you. That's not how everyone else thinks. You kinda seem like you don't even like the game much, so why keep playing? Lol
---
What is with the X axis scale on the ehp chart, it just starts at a non zero value, ignoring the part of the chart where all the lines start out and diverge away from, as no armor means an effective multiplier of 1, so those lines all converge quite sharply down at where the light blue line begins. And that first part of the graph is rather important.
---
And it's really a matter of secondary costs versus benefits. 
---
It is super easy to get to a respectable 300 or so armor, but getting up to a significantly higher threshold is hard, and requires you to sacrifice options, resources, and perk slots in order to get those higher thresholds. getting 5 ranks of ironclad to get more armor is almost always a waste of perk points compared to getting fewer ranks in other perks, like getting lifegiver instead for more base health, and spending the excess on another perk like blocker.
---
If you could get an easy extra amount of armor then you should, but if you have to start giving up something else to get more armor then you probably should not.
---
Yeah, hoping for a comprehensive list by setting type. Let's see what we get. This group has been pretty amazing so far with what they have created.
---
For the most part yeah but sometimes there’s just not enough people on server or worse a lev 25 goes to the computer and starts the event before everyone can show up! But usually in my experience it’s all good
---
OK but if you have a meltdown when someone picks your lock, don't cry about it on here.
---
Go jerk off to Charlie Kirk.
---
I too have seen this.
---
See, when I get bloodied builds trolling me, I go to my camp, if they are desperate and follow me, I hide in my house (On the other side of the door is a inactive decontamination shower) and when they follow and keep going, I turn it on. Sure, they can fast travel, and really it's not a fantastic counter, but it's my personal amusement.
---
Take over workshop at posidon energy plant and you can get the fusion core machine working
---
I guess we should just be thankful it doesn't just delete our bases as well as the materiels.
---
We saw them this past weekend. They were pretty underwhelming, but cool to see none the less.
---
Idc he's still cool and I'm not dead so it's all good he can want whatever he wants
---
Found her again
---
He’s not lying I just never looked at eBay. I see there is some.
---
I love those folks who do that, like on the uranium run (or whatever the name is) event when a legendary pops up.
---
I usually dump off unused ammo into suitcases at train stations.  If you're on PC check the Grafton train station lunch box I almost always dump handgun ammo there.

Oh goodness I bet you give them quite the thrill or shock! You never know... I remembered I tend to have problems with carrying too much crap so I use my power armor a lot. That likely doesn’t help me look friendly plus throw in a Grognak’s axe and I certainly don’t look like someone who’s going to ask if you need a stimpack lol
---
With what I’m hearing about how unarmed is underperforming in the pts I might be goin the opposite way from melee to heavy. Same thing tho , all under strength so no moving special needed.
---
But I wanna farm both lead and junk!
---
Line in the sand, get explosives and just toss them into the mass spawns. People say the bug doesn’t work, but they are wrong
---
ill play with you guys if you would like lvl90 username skilledfoil886
---
Guys like this are why I’ve started packing my quad ffr gamma gun around. That thing melts bloodied builds and I’ve got no supporting perks for it.
---
I want to be able to use purified water in place of boiled water (I have 10 industrial water purifiers at my camp).
---
I wish plans showed what the crafted item looked like.
---
Just open them, don’t keep them.
---
I have a question. How do they make money? I'm serious when I ask this. Because although I play this game. Where does the money come from? I don't buy any atoms with cash. I don't see ads like on YouTube. My only cash investment is my initial payment for the game. Do I still line there pockets from play time? Or is it the people who have fallout 1st and also invest in atoms for purchasing skins and such? I always wondered how this all works.
---
Posiden energy.  The power plant.  There is an event near it called powering up Poseidon. With someone's help you can complete that and you will get the plans for the fusio  generator eventually.  Every time you complete the event you will get a random set of plans for a medium, fusion or large generator.   Once you have that you can power up the fusion core genetrator at the workshop there and about every 10 minutes it makes you a full Fusion core.
---
Only on bolt action and revolvers last I checked. Doesn't work for regular pipe guns.
---
I literally dropped the plan at whitespring station earlier!
---
Cleaning up those dirty bloodied bois lol
---
Agreed, I went 3-4 MONTHS at 10-20 a week to go from Knight (Which my wife gave me) to Knight Sergeant (Causing me to think I had broke the chain as I didn't find Knight myself). 2 Weeks later I got Captain and Officer in the same weekend, 1-2 Months for Paladin then 2 weeks later Elder, which I'm farming. Got a few Shielded plans (2/3?) during the last two months.
---
I trafe everyone so I can buy nuclear keycards
---
That's literally how the last three Fallout games worked. MMOs still do paid for content expansions.
---
It is now more controversial to pay for new quests than 3d models that were in a previous game I own?
---
Just enjoy the break. Explore Appalachia. Walk around instead of fast traveling. Do events you do not normally do. Rebuild your camp. Or if nothing interests you aside from grinding day after day, then take a break. 
---
The vendor sale starts soon or just take a break and enjoy the real world till the 15th. Go outside, start a new hobby, etc.
---
Industry leading game devs :DD
---
I'll definitely have to grab one when i can, melt away the trolls with it 😂
---
Regarding that last line, it's because the initial reaction to release drove away anyone who was unable to see the good in things, while the rest of the players who stayed were the ones with the ability to keep an open mind.  Open minds are always good for a community.  
---
I mean, I loved the idea at release - we were the NPCs, we could mold the future through our actions, etc.  I like the idea of a progressing storyline that happens over real time for everyone.  But most people were like "This isn't exactly what I'm used to!  My expectations are paramount! Boo!"
---
I'm so glad that crap has died down for the most part.  Only a few straggling super mutants are still hating on the game.
---
If she gives me a quad explosive double barrel/combat shotgun during the half price sale she'll be on my good list
---
I do try to keep it off though cause I know for the good guy bloodieds it's annoying to accidentally hit.
---
I just saw you were level 10.  Are you on PS4?
---
Just FYI, workshops are pvp zones, so it’s best to be crouched if farming fusion cores at Poseidon. This way other players can’t see you on the map.
---
Haha, you should have gone with something like "Maybe if those people had been socially responsible and sheltered at home rather than out spreading Covid-19 they wouldn't have missed the reward"
---
What are they
---
100% westek
---
Ummmmm...my trading character. Lol I’m playing around but I understand what you mean. The worst thing is when I load him in for one person and then all of a sudden I get swarmed
---
If you can afford it in caps the traveling merchants that show up at your camp always have 5-10 on them and are always 100%. Make sure to use the Hard Bargain perk if you have it but otherwise workshops that have fusion core generators are free!
---
Enjoy it while you can.
---
What's the matter smoothskin? Never seen a ghoul before?
---
I just cant get it no matter what, even on a toon. 
---
Same as Sludge lungs! The very first basic disease everyone gets! But my Achivements says I never got it lol
---
I didnt even try to get other disease, I just let diseased enemies hit me once or twice, and i got  all of them except Whoopsies and sludge lungs lol
---
"Draw me like one of your French ghouls!"
---
Yeah I've never seen it either
---
How about these items should be directly deposited to every player. The idea of clawing these rewards is counter productive. The community completed a task so the community should be rewarded without having to sign in to claim the reward from a space in the atomic shop that should be giving a free item anyway.
---
I completely agree with this.
---
It becomes a BOS base doesn’t it? Shit.
---
Got the same view in Humboldt.
---
Yeah, there are wandering "PVP" groups (I call them that loosely).  They think that 3 or 4v1 with 3x the levels and broken builds is PVP.  I just switch servers when that happens.  Oh, and I block the player killers. 
---
It makes me laugh when they talk smack on mic, because they have such large cojones. /s
---
If they want real PVP, this really isn't the game for them.  What happens in the this game is more like fly swatting.
---
While we're at it can we just remove artificial scarcity altogether!
---
While this is the best way to farm cores it does of course come with the inherent risk of someone murdering you and using an explosive weapon to play corspe hackey sack.
---
Yeah, they make it from the people who continue to buy. Many people have played hundreds or thousands of hours having only bought the game at launch or even during a sale, and that's fine for them. But there are people who have multiple accounts for mules or for cheating - it's honestly surprising how "loyal" of a fanbase the cheaters are, many of them have fallout 1st on multiple accounts. The 1st subs are probably the biggest contributor to their income, if not an outright majority.
---
Atoms have imo a pretty bad conversion rate from real money to atoms, considering what you can earn in-game, but people buying them also contribute towards that.  
---
The seasons payments probably contributed to that too. Having ways of paying through a grind is very lucrative for game companies, since there are people out there who make large amounts of money from their job or retirement but don't have the time or desire to grind all day. So it makes sense for them to spend the wage from one hour of working if that cuts out X hours of grinding and lets them have what they want. To the people who value their money too much or their time not enough for that, they can just play and grind. 
---
Only bethesda really knows how well all of this is working out, but considering they haven't gone to the easy cop-out option of some form of loot boxes, they must be earning enough for comfort from what's already in the game. And as much as people complain about overpriced atom shop items or them trying to monetize things like the seasons, it means that it allows the rich minority to fund the game from being cancerous for everybody
---
Well. I hope you’re happy 😂
---
I’m still waiting on a bloodied fixer or bloodied handmade above one star. I’ve had good rolls but not those yet. One day.
---
Also, yeah pretty pleased with the reduced chem weight one. First four rolls on a ss leg, can move on to other limbs quicker than expected.
---
Dont think it' will go live for about 13 hours.
---
Because the sale is from Sept 10-14
---
My CAMP is on an Acid node.  My Extractor is locked.  My Ammo machine is locked.
---
My Purifiers, crops and Collection are open.
---
If you leave it unlocked, I will help myself.
---
Will check them out, will be researching tonight my best ways to farm all loot. Need to take advantage of this but ive not gotten much done at all last two days as I was at a loss for what I could do. now I have a plan I will begin tomorrow thanks to your help! The fallout community is the best one I've had in a game in a long time, yes there's griefers but there's you guys ty
---
What does blocking do? I mean i know what blocking someone is, i mean does it do anything in the game.
---
Noooo!!! So sorry pal
---
her
---
My bad
---
Also Mount Blair Trainyard is a great farm for cores like you mentioned that are not 100% full but free and you can server hop so you can really stock up only thing is the mole miners there are high lev so you would need to have someone with you maybe? There’s an awesome legendary perk card coming that when equipped, you will have the core that is currently in the power armor you must be wearing at the time, fill up incredibly fast when attacked with energy weapons! Sounds like a must have card for any PA player
---
Thanks for the specific date
---
Yeah.  Private server helps.
---
any updates?
---
Have you closed and restarted the game? I know my menu options will sometimes stall after an update or weekly changeover on PS4 until I do. Also, sometimes those options won't load until I've actually joined a world, I've just accepted it as the norm coz it just works...
---
New players can buy the utility stuff for gold, cosmetics they are out of luck.
---
Happened to me as well champ, go on public and quit out you should be able to get in then
---
Oh yeah good point.
---
Buttressed asap for maximum defenses, and for me, I'm going with brawling on arms (cuz I'm an unarmed build) and custom fitted on legs (cuz I love sprinting). Jetpack on torso is just too cool to pass up, especially when combined with marsupial.
---
shame about that weapon weight reduction.
---
Sounds like they’re bugged on all systems right now man. That’s a bummer sorry!!
---
I just put some for sale for 20c each, how much are you needing?
---
LOL, you might want to take a few minutes and scroll through some posts, my dude.
---
Yeah so I never messed with getting fixer plans until I changed my build around and then I went to market got plan for 5k caps. I got a mutants 3 star fixer with decent prefixes, then couple days later I got zealots fixer with better prefixes. Then one fateful night I was able to roll 3 times and each roll she gave me 3 bloodied weapons in a row , 1 was bloodied lever 2 was first bloodied fixer (250 damage resistance while reloading and 50 more critical damage) and 3 was bloodied Tesla. I then had a nice player give me a bloodied explosive fixer +1 perception because I had a post on market asking for a b2525 fixer for my extra tenderizer plan. And I had someone offer me one but then someone got on there and talked shit on the guy and I snapped on him because it was my post and the guy wanted to trade but he ruined it and then a person came and defended me and gave me that fixer for free. Amazing. I have a 3 star bloodied handmade I bought off another awesome person for 10k caps. So I’ve been lucky with them.
---
Good thing is you won’t need another card next time you try to launch!
---
I got a powered sentinel left arm the other day. It was regenerating :s
---
best time to start one is after a scorched earth or a colossal problem. Make sure you don't start it properly until people are there
---
Yeah, perfect first and second stars, whiff on the third.  Gotta get that chem weight reduction.
---
Yes, but after you unlock the armors and weapons and all the best mods for them
---
Because the purveyor is a she, not a he.
---
Meh, lots of fragile snowflakes in this thread.
---
The government should tax people $5 per-post to complain about this specific topic. I call it the "For Christ sake, we know! Everyone in this sub has been hearing about it for almost two goddamned years" tax, and with it, I will balance the federal budget.
---
Yeah, if you need the workshop. Have it. But, just logging off afterwards? Like.. why? Oh no, you stopped me getting 3 fusion cores! I don't even lock em, need it? Have it. Unless.. they are logging off to have a furious wank after their super l337 kill on someone. Hmm.
---
I have a lot of scrip ready for tnrw. Fingers crossed
---
K thanks tho I write this in hurry so I don't checked the other posts
---
"Why is this game too easy. I want a challenge. No. not like that."
---
You cant recharge them (so far). Nuclear power plants have fusion core generators, you might try capturing those and farm. At some point you might have to keep a plant for a while. Back in my time workshops were abit more competitive, especially powerplants. But one very late night I captured thunder mountain and kept it for several hours until i had 100 cores and had enough. But since then I never dropped less than 50 on me, even tho I use Power armor, run, and even VATs. So if you can get about 10-20-30 etc, and keep collecting, you might get by.
---
But if you are lvl 10 only, you wont be using power armor or gattling lasers until about lvl 15 (or for real lvl 25), so you can collect the ones that lay around.  There are some places (tho maybe not alot in forest region) that has cores laying around. Lumber yard, Poseidon enerrgy plant, aktos farma, wade airport etc.
---
Also, if you can find a gattling laser plan, each time you craft one, you get 1 full fusion core and they require basic materials, no flux.
---
I started doing this instead of carrying around toxic goo and it's been a game changer. Even have a bloodied gamma gun that's fun to play around with sometimes.
---
Are you on Xbox? I’m low leveled. Can I tag along?
---
Wait until next week's update.
---
Meta builds are going to rapidly change because of the damage calculation changes.
---
As someone who’s lived in WV for almost all my life, seeing people have a reason to like the state (a fallout game) makes me very happy. I moved out of WV recently, from Morgantown, and while I don’t regret it, playing FO76 makes me remember just how beautiful the state is.
---
Radiation rumble is a good xp event, just tag enemies and let the other players finish them off
---
My giant, round, 3 building laboratory says Hi! This building system is *so easily* bent to your will, I seriously don't see how people think it's hard to make amazing and unique looking buildings. There are myriad glitches, tricks and other fun stuff you can do to create imaginative things. Flamethrower trap to merge things that shouldn't be (roofing tiles, workbenches, vendor terminal into walls), raising/lowering of foundations for unique height differences, ALL the rug glitching, the doorframe glitch for double walls, the doorframe glitch to make round buildings, blueprinting items to shove into corners/under stairs that they have no ability to place there otherwise, 'snapping' the barbedwire fence to foundations... the list goes on. 
---
Yes, this system ABSOLUTELY needs work, you're 100% correct. We shouldn't have to rely on easily performed glitches to achieve things that should already be possible in-game. The fact that we're still missing things from the Fo4 system is mind-boggling as well. The system, as it stands, need the overhaul you speak of. But to think that it isn't quite easy to do way more advanced building is rather disingenuous. All it takes is a bit of time familiarizing yourself with the system, and deciding *how* you want to break it/work around it's limitations.
---
Just wasted my nuclear keycard at silo alpha 😑 seriously tired of this game
---
I don't know what the tone of your  comment is supposed to be, sarcastic or compassionate, but I appreciate it either way.... ;)
---
I am merely lvl 60 but it is time for me to pay it forward. I have started hunting low levels and building modded guns to their level and chasing them around. I don’t care if it’s your alt, pls just take it I have nothing better to do between quests and events.
---
Guy comes in delivers facts gets downvoted. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Of course lmk and I'd be happy to help?
---
My usual Queen is deliberately failing the first part of the Suitor’s event.
---
I want me some plans! My GT: Chrisgamefreak
---
Blackwater have 5 benches (including cooking) and 2 times closer
---
It's called shooting the messenger :-)
---
A really good point.  It has always surprised me that it tops out at 999, which really isn't that hard to hit on many ammo types.
---
Yeah good point that is a huge bummer. At first I thought you were saying you couldn't fight them. They could definitely drop something more significant
---
As far as I know the basic one collects random junk, raider one chems and BoS the Atlas event materials.
---
OP maybe consider doing an Earl or SBQ fight first--it'll give you an indication of the strength of the player base in your server. People are triggering those events constantly and I use it to work out if joining 'harder' events is worth my time.
---
It saves you burning like 2000 caps to summon the bitch and you end up washing out because nobody has a clue what they're doing.
---
Thank you for the prompt reply. I feel more enlightened today. I guess my only contribution to Bethesda after I bought it is. My friend bought it. Also my brother bought it too. Hehe I kind of coaxed them to try it. I wish my other friend would play too. But he's a die hard Skyrim only fan. Anywho thanks again! See y'all in the wasteland!
---
Holy shit, was it on Xbox yesterday? I think we probably stepped into the same guy!

Where to farm all the things guide ---&gt;  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic

And yes, Fallout community is best community!
---
Good luck out there, and forever may the Mothman buff your RNG!
---
You can definitely still be op with a legit gun.
---
Really?  I maintain a farm exclusively to brew those and Whiskey.  (And Rad Ant Lager when possible.). The issue is that it sells as quick as I can make it, so I make it often.
---
Absolutely! That’s give a lot more value to farming complicated recipes like Deathclaw Wellington.
---
If I ever have children, I hope I can have this kind of relationship with them

if any players want to team up. im a first time earl player. ive been out of country but am a level 221. would love to hook up with some good players.

Doesn’t have all of them listed. But it shows you the items broken down by rarity of what they each pick up.
---
Just get t65, it's easy, much quicker
---
Even legendary enemies ? Not kidding ? no way :D thats a game changer :\]
---
Even though this guy was being a twat, not all high levels following you want to cause trouble.
---
I have fun putting on my Pint Size Slasher outfit and knife and following them while in stealth mode. It's fun to see where you can hide so its just your mask peeking out staring at them. It's some harmless fun when you don't have anything to do in the game. And eventually I play Pint Size Super Hero and bail them out whenever they find too much trouble.
---
Is it bulk or single scraps? I would be happy with ~250 and am willing to pay.
---
My dude, if you're level 1000 you've put in thousands of hours into this game. Yes, you absolutely will have better gear than a dude who just hit level 50 and has 100 hours. I hate this stupid "gUnS dOnT LeVeL aFtEr 50" bs that people love to spin
---
Dw bout me chief i got my protocoled + calibrated shocks strangler heart ;;)
---
Sentinel's is always less damage from players as primary.
---
If its unlocked, it's mine.  If it's locked, it's mine, but with more effort.
---
Dude just go for it. I'm level 170 and still feel like a virgin in a brothel. Dive in man! Just ammo up. Or don't. Learn either way ;)
---
It has already been like that since beginning , but there weren't really that special weapons, I once got a legendary bow and a few gauss pistols from legendary enemies. So its possible.
---
Two shot gatling laser...can't remember what the second star was
---
Man wish I could meet people like you in game
---
Legs: Cushioned (for Jet pack) or Deep Pocketed
---
Arms: Deep Pocketed

Torso: Jet Pack
---
Some individuals are too narrow-minded to consider the possibility that individuals have priorities outside of Fallout, ones in which accessing their consoles/pc isn't an option within 72 hours.
---
Luckily, they will be bringing the collectron back into the atom shop on September 15th for a full week.
---
Then why the fuck it is still in the menu? They cant just hide it and dont confuse people? And thanks for treating me like a dumb ass i hope you get some aids. Fucking average Redditor
---
What weapon are you using for your commando? Is it bloody/junkie/AA or any major prefixes?
---
Thanks for answering!
---
Unfortunately, Fusion Cores do not recharge.  You'd either have to find another Fusion Core or craft your own.
---
That’s awesome that you had a good time! It is a really fun event in my opinion and tackling it at even high levels can be quite the challenge. Keep leveling up and fleshing out your builds and you’ll be kicking Earle’s ass in no time.
---
Xbox?
---
You may not do anything in our game that would offend or trigger soyboys, simps, or plebs who will never become men or get laid without paying for it....
---
In that case can I place an order?
---
Still waiting on an update please
---
God Bless America. Death to the Deserters.
---
And that's fine, that wouldn't have bothered me. I'd have laughed my ass off if I was getting attacked by the pint sized slasher lmao. But his friend making sure no one else got legendaries and then him smacking me with a claw weapon while I was vending and stashing for 5 minutes isn't that. They wanted to cause problems and I'm tired of finding people like this everyday so I gratified him and he wasn't ready for it. Then he rage messaged me for 30 minutes demanding i fight him again when I didn't wanna kill him in the first place lol
---
But i have a crippling fear of wendigos until they classify them as ghouls. And theres so many of them. But i don't fear the colossus.
---
What kind of volume are you looking for?
---
Not long been with this page or reddit so please kindly suck a fart out my arse
---
My theory too. If I want it, I lock it. That generally only applies to my ammo maker, though.
---
Western revolver is good for hard hitting. And an instigating black powder can pack a punch with a pistol build. 10mm pistol...not alot of fun
---
For real I live in Bumfuck Nowhere WV and I get vendor traffic (Well I used to... I removed my vendors as I'm rich and fukn crazy). 
---
People will travel. 
---
Dunno if I'm alone in this but extractors are overrated. Such low ceilings in them that you can't leave them unattended for too long, yet noone wants to be going back to CAMP every 30mins or so....
---
I agree. I end up naming all of my gear Zz ll, Zz rl, Zz la, Zz ra, Zz ch, but that can be confusing sometimes too.
---
I am struck on "Meet up with Johnny" their in the room behind the intercom, the door on the left is open but it acts like it's closed..
---
I always give my duplicate plans away when I see a low level
---
B2525 Fixer, BE25 Handmade and V5025 Radium
---
aside from caps and the calling card, Id say 3-4 or maybe 5 high level high DPS tanky players needed, assuming at least 1, but preferably 2 or 3 of them can be the pylon and tank the pylon damage. If all done correctly, it really takes about a minute or 2 to fight the impostor. I usually take all 3 pylons and jump up on the shack and use stims cuz many, many players dont understand how to damage the imposter or PMS bloodieds usually wus out of being the pylon.
---
lastly, its good idea to start it good 10-15 mins after the SBQ or earl event. That way you can check out how many players active and they would be done crafting stable flux and will be able to see the event popping out.
---
She grew up on games as I've always played them. She discovered Skyrim at 6, fallout shortly after. I came home from work one day and she had 100% Skyrim so i got her her own setup shortly after. That honestly made it that much more fun for us both. Completely worth it!
---
So. I got another nuclear keycard, what if I used again with the same code?
---
This won't be resolved today.
---
Are you 100% sure, or just talking out your ass? It says nothing about it being *JUST* Weapons/Armor on any piece of information on it. Just a total 50% Off Legendary Vendor Sale. If you can pull an actual source, I'll gladly eat crow pie.
---
Don't worry this still happens when you're high level. If they see you have a nice camp they seem to like to try to goad you into pvp so they can wreck it.
---
Interesting. So were you able to stealth? I thought the awareness mutation was supposed to make stealth impossible
---
Did he drop a Jazzclaw Hand for you?
---
No stealth still don't work. But the build i was using was basic stealth commando.
---
EDIT: With minor tweaks depending on the mutation. Like replacing stealth for dodgy, concentrated fire for ground pounder etc etc
---
Treehouse village??? Unreal! I just set up a camp in a power tower near there like 4 days ago. Just remarked to a friend how cool it'd be to have people living there. I love this spot, 2-4 bloodbugs everytime I come. I call it Bogton and it's my lil fishing village =)
---
Feel free to stop by on PC
---
If you want another Chally mask, I’ll sell you one for 3000 caps.
---
I didn't down vote ya bud
---
Slightly off topic, but earlier I herd one of the settlers asking Ward if he'd like another brew/coffee, or words to that effect, not heard it before. He responded that he would and the settler replied and carried on in the backround, her voice fading out as she walked off to fetch the beverage, I thought it was a real nice touch.
---
Thanks for this summary, Im just getting back after a bunch of months and was trying to optimize my armor, had this very question.
---
hoenstly I've always found that higher level players are nicer than lower level ones, I've had some if the nicest interactions in any online game in fo76
---
Have there been any community events where the community has failed to get the highest tier unlocked?
---
The more the better tbh, normally pick up 50-100 a week. All depends on how I'm feeling lol.
---
Only FO1st. It’ll always be a pain but you’ll eventually learn how to control it. I’d suggest no more than 200 of any junk item at best. That’ll leave you with 2-300 for items you want to sell or keep.
---
Doggone business hours. Can't dare work after!
---
Dang, thank you
---
They are broken due to a bug right now, there is no correct information.
---
And banisters, it's a major health and safety issue!
---
That's what you get for letting all that meat from your kills go to waste.
---
Thanks for the long response, very helpful. I might try a healthy tank power armour build next.
---
I played every day till I finished the run, taking a much needed break, then I'm ready to jump back in for armor ace.
---
I can't wait to see what kind of fertilizer I can make from legendary spoiled meat and veggies.
---
Gotcha. Seems lame if they were that easily defeated by a commando with a B25 fixer and you got the highest time marker. I don’t get why every piece of content they add just goes from impossible to a cakewalk with just a couple perks and the right gun. 
---
Were you getting a good return on your ammo?
---
I always have tons of water. I usually make a run through the airport and take out the few decaying humans in there. Then I sell their guns first and all water after. I sell a couple hundred waters every day that I play. With hard bargain it’s 5 caps each.
---
Thank u/DerGudy, it's their explanation.
---
There are other quests you can do to get that backpack that don't need another player.

Athlete and Swimmer are two I used.

Cursed food

Woah! Where's the NSFW warning?

This is some steamy stuff.

We used to have 400 at the start!!1!!11!!!!
---
get rid of missiles and nukes and fusion cores. check misc for gunpowder. sell it for 2c each.
---
you don't need 69 stimpacks and 420 radaway. Sell to vendors or in your vendors or give to newbies.
---
learn what junk you need to repair your gear. Keep a little bit extra of that. Learn what junk is common and easy to find. Keep less of that. learn what junk is harder to find and keep more of that.

use this to find junk

if it's scrip either scrip it or sell in your vendor. 3\* weapons usually go for 400-500 caps. 3\* armour 250-350

Perfect answer! Thank you!!

I've been making the transition from a bloody melee to heavy weapons with an emphasis on explosives. while explosives still feel a bit underwhelming, I've been having alot of fun with it. If anything, it's worth it to see all those lil pals of Earls going flying into the distance as i spam mini nukes like a mad man.
---
That's taking advantage of an exploit/glitch tho
---
Probably catch a few down votes but being honest you gotta play this one like a survival game not a fallout or elder scrolls game. Hording is not your friend and wasting cards on weight buffs is a waste of cards. Learn to run light and stay light because you will f yourself trying to manage all sorts of weight buffs every time you put on PA or need to do significant damage to enemies when you are alone
---
PM'd.
---
Good to hear junk has lost its value. I had 100k of almost everything you can put in a scrap box on PS4.
---
I want this so bad.
---
More stuff to collect would be awesome.

Scorchbeast King Confirmed
---
Thanks a bunch for the help
---
if you want to spend your time playing the game and having fun with one of the wackiest guns ever then get the shotgun.
---
if you want to spend your time farming materials to make 2mm ec and barely playing the game then get the minigun.
---
If you want to be ridiculed by your fellow wastelanders then get the pistol.
---
You mean rewards? I agree. That and badges and other things. Imagine being able to choose one of 5 different skins you can only get if you achieve 100 kills for example, and so on.

---
Scroll to the right to see all the others. The BoS collectron will be added shortly, but it's a 95% for scrap and a small chance for drinks, grenades, and ammo.
---
Yep or add a shitty looking fridge as a new quest reward or something so it's not "pay to win".
---
When I was still using PA often, I took several hours on a weekend and took over the Poseidon plant on a private server and then just checked in and emptied it every 30 minutes. I did this over two days and stopped when I hit 100.
---
It has taken me a over a month to get down to the 30(not using power user) I have now. Don't mess around with hopping around looking for 25% full core spawns, that is a total waste of time. Next time I do this, I'm gonna get multiple power plants online so it doesn't take as long.
---
Hit private server
---
Take over all 3 plants with the fusion core generator(Poseidon, Mohogwah[sp] and Thunder Mt)
---
Do a circuit every 30 min to retake and empty
---
Profit!?!
---
The elevator on the workshop dlc for fallout 4 was the best, I still wish they carried that over to 76
---
yes
---
Im level 149 and sort of building bloodied. I did the quest for the first time the other day and the amount of times i died jumping down into the 'fight arena' was annoying. (so be careful jumping down, unless your in PA) but apart from that other players seem to do a good job at keeping the Wendigos away. Store all junk before going and you have nothing to lose! Give it a shot, its quite a good fight
---
That sucks.
---
Over and done.
---
Exactly.    
---
IMO, "If you expect everyone to play nice and fair, you're missing the point of an apoclypitic world and won't last long."    
---
Don't complain about the people who destroy your CAMP or take your loot should you die and can't get back fast enough.    
---
Don't complain b/c for the most part caps are hard to come by.    
---
Don't complain b/c you hoard everything and have poor organizational skills.    
---
By level 20 everyone should have a good understanding of the base game mechanics.    
---
I don't/can't do things to your level but I frequently help and most of the stuff in my CAMP is cheap. I want stuff gone not sitting in my STASH at inflated prices so I can be some subjective in-game rich person.    
---
I have a short list of people who have slighted me since it came out. I'll help if I can and those people......I might help or do nothing.
---
I doubt it. They usually happen Tuesdays. A hot fix could happen at anytime for any reason though. Who knows though.

See the present looking icon on the right side of the screen? Click that.

Basically you spend IRL money, than you can use it to apply awards to peoples comments or posts.

AFAIK it's only the Raider one.  But I saw someone say if you have it you can use it on any, so you should be able to purchase the Raider and use what you want.  Right now he brings me weps and ammo.  The weps are lame shit, but the ammo is useful.  I usually just leave the weps in there (it seems to only grab 4 or so) then just collect the ammo.  Great for those, scrap a weapon challenges though.
---
Damn, that's almost nothing to be honest 
---
thanks a lot for these, the links will definitely be a great resource 😊
---
Yeah I never engage in pvp really ever but certainly not near my camp as ive seen people be griefed. Its just really lame to see so many members of the community be toxic as hell. People say they rarely experience this but I see people like these guys in almost every server lol
---
I think they represent want most payers want, a docile peaceful wasteland where everyone helps everyone out and players run coffee shops. I miss how awful raiders were and want to demolish all coffee shops.
---
Purveyor refuses to be bound by gender labelling... 
---
... Or give good rolls. 
---
Her pie machine pays out more than she does. Proven.
---
Lemme know if you have other questions on storage. I spend like half my game time some days making sure I can afford to store all the semi-valuable heavy weapons I keep getting from the purveyor
---
How do you snap the barbed fence to foundations?
---
If you mean the ammo you can pick up.. I generally didn't bother with looting them but seems like you do get alot of the ammo back. Especially with hard hitting weapons like bloodied, as you are not spending that much. Bloodied still kills enemies (even the lv100) with couple bullets.
---
EDIT: Solo will be doable for most players that have some experience in the game. In a 4 man group it is a joke. Speaking about highest rank. There is way more enemies in a 4 man group but the objectives timer/bar move faster the more people you are with, making the op faster. Atleast when people learn to stay within the range of the timer thingies (forgot name).
---
The grind continues...
---
I lucked out. I am a courier (through the largest Facebook Xbox Courier Group, not through here) and that has helped me meet a lot of great players.
---
Finished yesterday. New season starts 9/15.
---
I bought it for 5K, done the event probably 30 times. Nada. One time i got a legendary fixer randomly from somewhere else. Thats it. All imposter outfits...
---
Usually on Tuesdays starting at around noon EST.
---
I haven't heard of anything for tonight or tomorrow.
---
Open them when your daily caps reset, they usually give you a lot of aid items and junk you can sell.
---
If you're not adverse to them any of the magic effects work on both guns, it's pretty hard not to get a good roll if you use them. 
---
With Ammo Factory coming next week (hopefully) priming them is the most ammo efficient if you've got the flux, if you haven't then daily ops with the gauss shotgun will help you keep your minigun feed with the large ammo vs return the shotgun gives. 
---
The wiki explains all the mods, and there's not to many to choose from.
---
Minus the adolf and 1488, that’s what I’m worried about, it was a long while back when I first created my character, I would go to SBQ events and blare hitler speeches over the mic.
---
When me hungry, me tear limb from dead enemy, me then eat limb of dead enemy, enemy no like, but I no longer hungry.
---
Yeah! Fuck Coffee Shops!
---
I spent 660 script, and guess what, only 2 of the 3* items were good
---
True. 
---
Alas, while my char is excessively strong and highly perceptive, she is only 1/2 way up the smart scale and has the charima of a rock. :)
---
I am  glad you had an enjoyable time, I  wish I could have been there to see this for myself. 
---
On another note I  find it very astonishing to find a level 1000 player, I am level 500 and I have played this game for over 3800hrs, so I am finding this to be  possibly someone that has used an XP glich to exploit the game at some point, just saying I have a friend that is 4300hrs in and is at level 585, so I find this to be very intriguing  to say the least. But nonetheless it is what it is, you had fun and that all that counts.
---
Disciples for life
---
Unfortunately i am on xbox
---
Keep them. They can be used to trade for good guns or armor. I've had people see my vendors and dm me asking if they could do presents instead. I've done the same, sometimes you get a no but sometimes you get a yes, I've also had it where a guy bought some high price items from me and said he didn't wanna short change me for the other one he wanted since the total would've been over max caps and he gave me an exchange of presents instead.
---
This is normal, till the next season starts. No atom challenges, no score, nothing.
---
Sometimes it doesn't bug, the bug is caused by tent placement by the fence.
---
Whopsies is extremely low and annoying. I sat there for 5 minutes at -150% disease resit to get it. (Rad-x enabled to not kill the mirelurk spawn with passive damage)
---
Pocahontas County (Watoga) is beautiful! I hope you hiked up the mountain to the Cranberry Glades, I loved them.
---
ok.  Someone should be able to drop you some to hold you over
---
I’ll just have to take advantage of that before they apply another damage balance then! Sry last question, is there any time limit to loot corpses like with ACP or are you free to just walk around after you’ve finished the op?
---
Lacking a build is going to harm you more than being at lv 53. Earle won't aggro you unless you are the highest damage dealer to him, or you're right next to him.
---
Meanwhile, Wendigos wont aggro you if you stay in hidden/caution. Otherwise they are hp sinks with at least 1.2k+ hp, I think may be closer to 2k.
---
You need to ask yourself how quickly can you deal 2k damage to a lv 75 enemy, and if it's too slow, how to make yourself more efficient. Remember, the wendigos are the trash mobs. If you're struggling against them, something needs to change.
---
I think both those games modes might be great fun!  
---
Not sure if you are xbox, but if you are, here's hoping I come across you in the wasteland. Ad Victoriam - or whatever Raiders say :)
---
I walked away and got the chems (and booze) I needed to pass the check then came back. Breaks immersion but works
---
What's the shelf life for the fridge food?
---
There is no active season right now, so no challenges.
---
The West Virginia Tourism website has an interactive [map](https://wvtourism.com/fallout76/fallout76-interactive-map/) identifying all the inspirations for in-game locations!
---
They don't truly snap to foundations, sadly. Hence my quotes lol But you can achieve the same effect by lining them up with the side of a foundation, extending one of the posts slightly past the corner, and snap another one at a 90° angle. If done correctly (since the fences are wildly finicky in how they like to line up/collide with certain objects) both sides should be evenly spaced as close to the foundation as possible, creating the illusion that the foundation is fenced. I used this technique to force an appearance of a base being fenced in for security, without having the weirdness of just fences out in the open. Works best with slightly elevated foundations, but I pulled a snazzy one off in testing with the foundation as close to ground level as possible. Tinker with it, you'll love the results!
---
100% agreed, make it a hold button or a combo of buttons, not one of the most commonly used
---
There are so many of these kind of posts, I've had great experiences with high levels but I wish the mods would do something about it
---
It's not in the menu, and most of us aren't confused, because we can read.
---
pork chop sandwiches!
---
Well damn maybe you scare some people off with that name, kkk 😂
---
I think I make about a dozen at a time.
---
I just want variations of the current 2x1 staircases with actual floors instead of the stupid open grating. Hell, I'd be happy if we could merge the half and quarter upper floor pieces into the grating like we could in the beta. I still don't know why the hell they removed that.
---
I remember an Angry Turtle video where he said AA was about a 20% damage boost whereas Furious was 50%. Did the numbers change?
---
I saw they had quad lmgs for the first few weeks of the game. Did you ever see any on there? I would like to fet a magic one
---
Damn you right
---
Once you hit 50 and you know you're gonna keep playing spring for a month of fallout 1st. And then for the month you have it collect as much junk as possible. Fill that scrapbox like it's an olympic sport. And then cancel FO1st. You can still use the junk your collected.
---
I didn't stay and try actually. I just left after finishing. But there is plenty of time to loot enemies while doing the op. Enemies come in waves and there is a little wait period between them.
---
Whatcha need? I can spare some (purified) water to help get ya going
---
Im full health heavy gunner so I love myself a nice extra DR and ER with vanguard SS.
---
You will likely waste another card.
---
BGS has acknowledged there is an issue, and a possible fix is in the works.
---
Keep an eye here and on the official forums to see when it gets fixed. There is a stickied post on the official forums.
---
If you keep getting doodoo rolls, either wait an hour or server hop.
---
Haha id play but I’m Xbox /:
---
I literally farmed out the recipe for a month and it didn't work on heavy guns. Awesome. Bethesda gotta get their shit together. The wastelanders quest still bugged and now nuke codes dont work
---
AA is a 28.8% damage boost. However, AA will remain multiplicative while junkies and furious will become additive. This change basically makes them all equal in damage.
---
I like laughing at peoples thoughts, too. We should hang out
---
You are gonna want 15 perception for any rifle build and a lot of agility for both Vats and sneak perks, other than that charisma 4 is always handy for either inspirational or lone wanderer depending on whether you are in a group or not and 5 intelligence for gunsmith.
---
For weapons an instigating Gauss Rifle is as good as it gets for snipers.
---
 Create a second character and get a trusted friend to help you transfer all the weapons/armour/ammo you are not using onto it. 
---
Bulk your junk and dont horde too much.
---
Take advantage of weight reduction perks for food and chems. 
---
Make sure you have broken down all junk before storing it. 
---
Check to see if you have learned plans,  most have next to no value so dump them. Things like armour plans and mounted creatures
---
Try not to store chems, food or drinks in your stash. All can be easily farmed as required so just carry enough on you to keep you going. 
---
Make check your misc tab for thins like ore and gun powder.
---
Dont horde crap legendaries, keep enough to get the next 1-3 days scrip depend how much you play sell everything else
---
Dont store non legendary weapons or armour. Just scrap them
---
Make sure any power armour pieces you have are put onto a chassis. That way the chassis will weigh 10 no matter how many pieces are on it
---
If you have the ammo converter use it to convert ammo you dont use into points and dont spend them until you need them. Any excess put in your vendor for 1 cap, except 38 &amp; 44, just drop them
---
Dont store explosives, missiles and grenade are useless so just drop them
---
Finally work out what scrap you actually use and find a balance that you are happy with. There is no point in storing 300 lead if you ha e plenty of ammo already.
---
It does take a little while to get the balance of stash space right but once you do it is easy enough to maintain.
---
Ultimately if you are really struggling then cough up for fallout 1st for  a month. Spend the entire month farming for scrap and filling the scrap box. Then cancel your subscription. You can still take scrap out you just can't put anymore in.
---
I'm kind of surprised people are reacting this way to a trash collector. Did everyone forget about the Easter eggs?
---
I think part of the lore is watoga bots malfunction every once in a while
---
Challenges aren't missing. They aren't active when there is no season.
---
The perk power user doubles the charge fusion cores have, it helps a lot.
---
Thank you Valseek. I appreciate your response 😊
---
The bethesda bugs got to them.
---
 Literally and figuratively.
---
I don't like that one, since it should be "you're the dumbass" it makes me seem like the dumbass and that's not funny :(
---
We wanted to, but it was pretty late when we made it there. It was an add on to another location we went to. But we did get out &amp; walk about for a little while.
---
Instigating Shotgun. You won't regret it.
---
Yep, stuck here too. What gives?
---
My grandmother quite abruptly died when the BoS flag reward was available, and I was out of town 530 miles away back at my hometown to help with her funeral and stuff for 5 days. So I wasn't able to get the flag despite contributing materials for it. 
---
Honestly missing any of this stuff as someone who finished The Legendary Run and then bothered to donate Steel/Cork/Concrete and stuff for nothing in return feels so bad.
---
Be prepared to die....a lot.
---
If you want to see it done right, ride along with me.

GT: LAWRENCEANDHENR 
---
I solo the event all the time.
---
https://youtu.be/HTZMHMd1wBs
---
I hope you get it when it comes back though
---
Especially since the middle option for the Ammo Converter is 1000 rounds.
---
I concur.
---
Good on you for jumping in and giving it a crack. Keeping the Wendigos off the high level guys and reviving them when they go down is way more helpful than you think. Also if you loot the bodies of the Wendigos that you killed they sometimes have the ammo on them that you killed them with as well as screws and acid from their teeth. 
---
Keep jumping to that event when you see it pop up and hopefully you will end up in a successful one soon.
---
Huh?
---
that's genius dude, I'm gonna do that when I get paid first thing, I'm level 65ish at the moment
---
Okay thank you for the quick feedback bro 💪🏻, would you know of any spots to find ammo (mainly .308) and also where I could find good guns? I’ve only found the marksman sniper and the other marksman gun
---
Ok chud
---
I tried harder one time with two partners, not completed but so much fun.
---
I saw a camp with fences along the foundation lined up in such a way that the foundation was flush with the gap under the fence. But the foundations were so high up that the posts weren't touching the floor, so I I'm not even sure what they were attached to.
---
Would like to use them to make interrior walls within my Silent Hill styled camp but their too tall to fit between the ceiling and the floor when inside. Heck their too wide to easily sit between 2 foundations even without angling them slightly.
---
Haven't been able to find any good guides on fully utilizing their raw potential.
---
That's what she said!
---
Yeah, in college we always had our due dates by 11:59pm Friday, or whatever, because people are stupid
---
thank you so much for the tips dude 😊
---
I love those things when your low on caps,I've had so many of them at one point my weight was maxed out,also they are good to go e to a mule or alt character to get them started with caps and meds
---
That graph's axis were a little wonky, fixed it. The damage tables also start out at 25 armor rating, I can add 0 armor rating but not many people run berserker builds. The EHM lines sharply converge down to one, but the point where it starts becoming a rapid change is at around 60 armor rating, which isn't really an armor rating you'll be seeing at max level. Once you're up past 100 or so the curves steadily increase with no discernible point where things drastically start to diminish.
---
I agree that for normal armor it isn't really worth what you have to do to get the last 50 or so points, 5 perk points is a lot to spend on Ironclad, but it's because that perk is a ripoff rather than that armor rating has massively diminishing returns at some point. If you're trying to decide whether to run buttressed SS armor vs. BOS heavy combat armor though, or full vanguards versus a mixed set, you're still in the range where a bit extra helps.
---
The numbers are more relevant when you're talking about power armor. If there were something magic about 350 DR, you wouldn't feel much of a difference between wearing raider armor and T-65, but your EHM at 250 incoming damage goes from 3.1 to 3.7, which is significant. I haven't run max level raider armor but during ACP my shotgunner tank with lifegiver and 9 points of endurance is noticeably less survivable in excavator than my heavy rifleman with 3 points of endurance in T-60. I'm definitely saving up for a set of T-65 for the shotgunner.
---
Defending predatory capitalism, what are you a chud?
---
You finish off that raider for Rocksy, you tell her "Appalachia has a new corpse", gain that little bit rep and jump out of convo immediatelly. Repeat.
---
Lol. I bought this when it first came out, and I tell you it was one of the biggest scams to date. I don't even think I have used it since.
---
thank you, I really appreciate it , I'm only level 65ish atm
---
No thanks, I would never log out again.
---
Update: Two days into the week break - OMG you were so right.  So. Many. Posts.
---
It’s absolutely worth it if you use 556 or Shotgun
---
I heard it from someone who worked in the industry. I don't have a source.
---
Thx
---
that's a good way of thinking tbh, I've never thought of it that way 😊
---
it's the best thing to do. take it for a month. cancel it. take it again 3-4 months later. fill the box. cancel after a month. etc blah. 
---
yeah the tent is great but. not worth that much a month.
---
There was a BOS collectron...?
---
Yup I waited 30 m and nothing so I used it
---
I launched 2 last night, and other group did the 3rd. But yeah, I've seen lot less nukes the last couple of days, don't know what's up
---
I’m a kleptomaniac. Can’t walk past a desk fan or typewriter, whether I need them or not. I’m always struggling with my stash limit. 
---
Just make sure you’re bulking up your junk at the Tinkers bench regularly - you’ll be surprised at the difference it can make.  
---
And prioritise the mats you want to keep and sell your bulked excess of the stuff you don’t need to vendors.
---
A Bloodied or Junkie's The Fixer is as close as you get to the Overseer's Guardian from FO4. (my favourite FO4 rifle) 
---
Even when you are running a Commando build The Fixer is great for long distance sniping.
---
They would've eventually put it back in the shop. 
---
I think they just want to encourage people to get on more. Any time I miss something I usually see it back in the shop a few weeks/month later.
---
You can also search specific sites with *site:bethesda.net*
---
Ah I see, thanks for clearing that up.
---
a quick question,  does the armour go away? I mean the ranger one
---
Ok cool! Looking forward to it for sure. I’m tired of all the repeatable events requiring a nuke and 1/3rd of the server. Just getting to fight more mobs without getting low on supplies will be a nice change.
---
THERE WAS A FLAG?!
---
Ok simpleton.
---
I can craft you a standard Fixer if you like and sort out some ammo too
---
GT Hoss Style THC
---
I literally do that too 😅
---
not gonna lie I haven't been doing that at all, I'm going to go on in a little while and do that right away 😊
---
I found the ops really fun change from ordinary grinding and boring events. Have to wait and see how long that feeling lasts :D
---
One day you’re just gonna start googling and everything is going to click lol. I had it somewhere around lvl 90 and all of a sudden the gameplay became so much more easy. Outside of trying to keep my vendors empty...
---
If they multiply like the Technical Data, how is selling them an exploit/glitch?
---
Then don't sell them and throw them away if it makes you fell better, it's not worth the few caps to feel guilty.
---
I think you lost most people when you mentioned travelling during a pandemic.
---
Welcome to insanity!
---
First of all if you wanna do pvp you gotta arrange a playdate with a person or group, don't bother doing it randomly. Stock up on super stimpacks, nuka cola quantum, berry mentats, and stealthboys. Faster fire rate over explosive unless its a legacy. Most will run with a qffr tesla or a je laser so energy resistance over ballistic but have some different sets of armor ready.
---
if you have a friend on the server everyone leaves the nuke zone, then you can leave the server, and rejoin them. if you own the server and are the one who launched the nuke then everything will re-spawn when you rejoin the server and enter the area 
---
also you can clear out the area and do this again to force everything to re-spawn 
---
rinse repeat again and again for the hour the nuke zone is there 
---
works great in the white spring area or burrows
---
The Overseer’s Guardian is definitely the best sniper on FO4, I used it myself during my run on FO4. Where could I find these guns you are talking about?
---
Predatory capitalism? Everything about the events were free..
---
I see.
---
I’m very sorry for your personal loss, compounded by an already difficult year. 
---
I fully understand your frustration.  And something like this should not be something you, or others that are in a similar position have to worry about. 
---
I understand the business necessities of a live service game, but the heart of a game should still be a game that brings enjoyment and escapism with as few frustrations as possible. 
---
Something that’s suppose to bring a community together shouldn’t create negative feelings that some in the community have missed out.
---
My only hope is that these stories from a generally very genuine, passionate, and well intentioned player base will not fall on deaf ears.
---

Being meleeI think that the freezing is the worst one.  Overall the daily ops are great and hope they are in the game soon.
---
That sounds like they built the fence on top of another foundation, with just enough touching the main foundation, and then removed the extra that supported it, possibly then dropping the height slightly via trigger tricks. I saw a gentleman in the Cranberry Bog, the day after they came out, with something quite similar. 
---
Try destroying your ceilings with the flamethrower trap, lining up your fences how you want them, and then hitting 'Repair All' on your C.A.M.P. Device! Should allow the ceilings to merge with the tops of the fences. Though I'm quite sure the barbed wire would clip through the roof in a slightly ugly way. If so, I'd also recommend doing a Full Wall with a Half Wall on top, to extend your vertical space, to allow the above technique as well, but hopefully allowing the barbedwire part inside. 👍 A Silent Hill camp sounds AMAZING, and with the upcoming holiday, I'm sure you'd have a huge hit on your hands.
---
Was too much to hope that we would get atom point challenges during the down week.
---
I've been to Charleston, Summerville, the lake, Beckley, Pt. Pleasant (drove out to the TNT area but couldn't find any domes), WV State Pen, Trans-Allegheny, Morgantown, New River Gorge Bridge (and been white water rafting beneath it!), Flatwoods/Sutton, Bald Knob, Green Bank Observatory, probably more.
---
I didn't realize there were so many other places so see, places that are actually real.
---
I'm from Toronto, Canada. But had an uncle in Charleston, spent a lot of childhood there and at his cottage in Mt. Nebo. Tubing on Summerville lake, visits to the Beckley mine and other places he thought was cool. Started driving through it on our way to Florida with my kids, so I started dragging them back there to see neat stuff.
---
And the best pizza I have ever had is at Padrino's in Beaver, just outside Beckley.
---
You want to see surreal, Google Stayton Oregon red sky.
---
I was planning on avoiding the pistol, but I DO enjoy making people laugh...
---
Just punch it, or toggle a low level weapon. Pick up the shovel and go to town.
---
Thanks friend
---
if you made it you keep it. but you cannot make another
---
Honestly if you all are on xb1 I wouldn't mind helping out and giving some pointers, I recently found a pretty cool group that kinda adopted me into it. I'm a day 1 casual, but I've got a decent handle on builds and weapons if you need a hand. Not to mention I'd be happy to give you all a hand in camp building if you need it. One thing I do believe in is paying it forward.
---
There's  no reason to join any other group though.
---
Finally someone with the guts to help.
---
You joke but there are a couple collectron exploits, nothing specific to the BOS one though.
---
Funny you say that...our team logged in last night and we couldn't drop nukes so we had to find something else to do. It was rather amusing to see 6x level 300+ doing events like project beanstalk and death blossoms.
---
The sbq, 0.00000001 drop rate XD seriously though good luck finding something that isn't vents or a jetpack from her, ultracite calibrated shocks are like unicorns
---
But then bolstering is a tall, silent guy that comes very reluctantly, late and slowly, half heartedly joing the fight, where the fight might have already been shifted in favor of your enemies. Short guy makes noise sure but doesnt leave the fight until he takes up a good beating.
---
Wouldnt you say when you fight, you would wanna put up a good fight asap, hit first and hit hard, rather than wait for your opponent to have a good swing at you lol
---
besides, what are we gonna do with these thousands of stimpaks?
---
Probably the best answer here
---
&gt; Recently did Colossal Problem with a level 1000+ player. 
---
A.... a *what?!*
---
As much as I loved the Season run it did kinda wear thin towards the end. A lot of people are taking a break. I personally have spent more time in private server completing other challenges etc and exploring areas I didn't go through thoroughly the first time.
---
The player base isn't gone they're just taking a nap. That's how I see it.
---
because people were playing for the wrong reasons
---
Some of the vendors sell it in bulk. I know the railroad raider robot south of foundation does for sure.
---
It doesn't matter what they say anyway, they're unconscionable agreements.
---
I will tell you the same thing I tell all the new players asking for free stuff.
---
GO PLAY THE GAME ! Believe it or not everything you need is all in Flatwoods and I mean everything all the way up to and past level 50 : )
---
It is common filler for RPG's, so people always ask for it. My first thought was "not worth it", but... well, it makes more sense in this game than many others, especially if they add in mounted fish and aquariums. It's a grind for decor, which could work.
---
BasedLordStark on Xbox, send a friend request, like level 91? Or so
---
I am doing the challenge ‘kill 1100 robots while having no weapon equipped’. different pace. very quiet indeed today.
---
Not yet on the PTS, but one can no longer place tents to trigger the special feature.
---
Tips help more than items, thank you
---
Just waiting for new content. Lots of single player fallout fans are doing their best to love the mmo
---
All the same scrap as the normal collectron, however my friends claim it also has a very rare chance of giving stimpacks, radaway and ammo, I've never seen it provide those though.
---
Damn, wish I'd known about that when I was on the grind!
---
It's a bug where those bots were dead already, but the server took a couple seconds to tell your computer that after you arrived, and them tipping over dead when the data finally synced
---
Yh they did that so people who didnt help out still have a chance I agree with op with 3 days wasntvlong enough and using the 'its Bethesda fault' makes you sound like one of those nv fanboys
---
Equip glow sight for the wendigos. There are a couple spots where you can hide and snipe. If you can, mod a chest piece w asbestos lining for this event. It negates all of the falling debris damage.
---
**This is what I'm talking about!**  
---
Awesome! Thanks. Never doubted that someone would come through. Cheers!
---
Ok, thanks guys! I never doubted that the community would come through!
---
I will, for sure. I like getting insulted by a robot that I built just as much as the next guy. Still wish there was a gold Insult Bot collectron. I'd actually pay atoms for that.
---
One flew over the cuckoos nest
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
Pretty comfy ngl
---
Grab the Rad-X and lots of it, cause that ain’t love out there!
---
Agree, but no Elvis. I like the lesser known artists and retro vibes better.
---
Vanguards lol Because as soon as I take damage (which will be reduced by vanguards) I will pop a stim and go back to the fight with high DR/ER
---
Note: I got 100s of diluted stim and radaway. Even without, I dont see point on saving your DR to the near death experience.  I dont have nerd rage. Maybe you combine it with the Nerd rage, then its pretty cool then. I dont even get that low in HP so I think Early extra DR/ER might save my life and allow me to stim and live. where late DR/ER might be too late to even stim. Heck you might get mobbed so badly that neither Vanguard or Bolstering could save you, in that case, I rather die so i dont waste stim and in hope to survive. I havent died in the game since i was lvl40ish in the forest, mobbed by lvl52 charred ghouls.
---
Collectors are a renewable resource, the stuff inside goes to waste if the owner doesn’t clear it out once it gets full so I’m not afraid to help myself. (There are times I don’t event visit my camp in a play session so I assume other people do the same thing, it’ll be full by the time they get back.)
---
Most likely scenario they left it unlocked on purpose for other players anyways.
---
I’ve only logged in to craft ballistic bock and blight soup. Literally all I’ve done since ACP dropped and since I finished the legendary run a couple of weeks ago. Now that there’s no nukes or limited time events, my beer and soup are getting stale.
---
If it was in the game somebody is bound to have it, I would think. Unless it completely missed all the dupes and nobody had saved one at all/all the ones that exist are hidden in stashes. You can find most things there though.
---
Interestingly enough, I googled the Quad LMG and there’s a post doubting its existence, one person says their friend has one from week 1, and there’s a single picture of one online. If you can find it, it would be an extremely rare piece for sure. I imagine you’d have to give up a legacy or two for it.
---
Im not struggling against them if im in PA and have a melee weapon. But the answer to 2k damage is simply no. I do not have anything close to that DPS. Well.... I only have 7 points in STR, but Early game I was built on shotguns, so I have quite a few perk cards for that. I also think I have a "magical" minigun.
---
Because there isn't a reason to grind, only tomorrow during the purveyor sale but that's it.
---
Not here to "win people"  I also never said I traveled during the pandemic.  I was at work on a golf course watching people not socially distance.  But its cool.
---
It's based on how fast you are falling. Eventually, you reach the point where the jetpack at full blast does not negate the fall speed, and you splatter on contact. If you feather your thrust to avoid that terminal velocity, however, then you can fall a serious distance without damage.
---
Oh, and the damage on hit seems to be based on distance traveled, not speed. So screw it up even slightly, and you die, even if you barely miss the velocity limit.
---
Yay cool. I’ve been really liking ACP, so hopefully this and the expeditions are going to represent a good change into more enjoyable grind content.
---
well of course you can have it
---
for a small monthly payment of 9,99 of course
---
1.they are giving something that would cost 5 pounds for free of course it's not gonna be as good as the payed one
---
2.there is a scap bot that hunts fir ammo if read the description of the raider bot it gets chems ammo and guns
---
3. Your  last point about it being nearfed well yh there giving something  you get fir 5 pounds for three they're not gonna give you extreme op stuff
---
Oh that looks good! Now I’ll try to experiment with different environments, thanks!
---
The title of the post, “an ounce of preservation”
---
10 4.  well i dont have any legacies, I just started playing again after wastelanders.  I mofo can dream
---
It's alright, it wasn't exactly random. Though I definitely didn't really expect it when it happened. She'd been deteriorating in health for nearly a year at that point. I just didn't realize how truly bad it had gotten cause I lived so far away and couldn't visit her every day like I did back when I lived in my hometown. 
---
She was basically my mom since she had joint custody of me with my dad and grandfather (Her husband.)
---
Geez, meanwhile I’m struggling to keep buying gold from Smiley to feed my SS armor grind.
---
The Gauss rifle plan is sold at the Watoga vendor, ammo is crafted at the Tinker's Workbench (ammo smith perk under agility boosts this by 80%).
---
Legendary weapons are dropped at random by legendary enemies and Gauss rifle requires level 35 I believe, all the bad ones you get can be exchanged at train stations for scrip that can be exchanged for a random legendary ranged weapon at the Rusty Pick (Ash Heap). Otherwise check player vendors once you have 8k caps or so in case they are selling one.
---
As a low level player I recommend you just follow the Wayward quest since it gives you a pretty decent legendary hunting rifle if you pick the rifle reward, don't bother with legendaries until you are level 50 since they will be worthless once you level up, just gather as much scrip as possible.
---
Sorry for the wall of text.
---
Do you happen to know of other similar groups? I love the Peacekeeper thing and love the Reponders, but my factions, in order of importance, are:
---
1) Free States!
---
2) Responders
---
3) Settlers
---
I'd be super into finding a group like the Peacekeepers with a similar mission that isn't Brotherhood. 💙
---
Which might explain why some asshole was screaming about it.
---
Can you send me an image of where on the map it’s located?
---
Yeah feeling guilty is for losers.
---
It’s definitely hard to adjust but once you do the game is way more fun , all that time wasted on weight management makes people feel like it’s a boring game when really it’s just them making it boring when they could be off killing stuff and things
---
Thanks for this.  Especially since it was Labor Day weekend and some people were entirely away from their computers.
---
Fair, maybe just some from time to time
---
Amen to that.
---
Does it show in your Atom Shop?
---
1400 ateast
---
Clearly you never worked an essential business
---
It may be a problem on your end.  I play the game on both PC and PS4 and have never had a problem with that quest being bugged.  BTW, I'm with you on the fast travel bit.
---
Compare this post to the others that are being vastly upvoted.. Its amazing the differences. They are being praised, you.. not so much.. I just came back to this sub to see what was going on and saw this being one of the main issues. There is zero reason to have 3 days for an item to be available to claim when the normal time span is 7 for a shop update. The people saying if you (being anybody in this case) didn't donate you shouldn't get it anyways, how do they know you didn't donate? You didn't have to donate during those 3 days to get THAT item while it was claimable. You are just talking about one particular item that for all they know you could have donated a bunch before just to clear scrap out.
---
Bethesda needs to realize that real life problems happen. Yes there are always things going on in the world, but does that mean that they have to make time constraints shorter and shorter to keep pushing people towards that play every day or don't play at all lifestyle? In the long run I think all they are going to do is keep burning out most of their player base or causing people to realize if they can't get things they worked for or that most other players are getting simply because they go on a vacation (or lets see how things go when people go out of town for the holidays and miss a 3 day claim themselves) their daily log ins that they want so badly are going to go down in the long run. Especially when they have issues keeping things like nukes working alongside the other string of bugs still prevalent years later, yet they want to do something they should logically know will upset a good portion of their players with it being a holiday weekend. They're asking a lot of their player-base when they themselves have yet to go the extra mile to fix what needs to be fixed first (*still* actually) instead of worrying about pushing new stuff with more bugs that just adds to the pile. If they have a No Mans Sky moment it'll be a great thing for the game and the players still here, but they don't seem to be going in that direction imho.
---
I might swap out bloody mess with ricochet, we'll see.
---
I own every damn collectron there is in this game.
---
I’m tryin to let this guy know the loss of BoS collectron is not as great as it appears. I’m not giving a scathing critique of Bethesda and if I didn’t it wouldn’t be over this. There is plenty of major shit to chose from.
---
Why are you so butt hurt? WTF is your major malfunction? Are you Todd lurking on reddit?
---
See, my boyfriend has this shotgun that can wipe out those level 75 Wendigos. I can’t do a thing to them, even with my strongest weapon! :o I’m gonna have to learn more about making my weapons better :)
---
People who are picky about pinching caps traveling aren't going to be your best customers by a long shot.  Find a nice out of the way location (though don't go as far as the corners) and you'll be fine.
---
I picked a nice spot a while back out by Johnson's Acre, a ways SW of Watoga.  A little canyon with a stream, few hostiles, and a decent view of the nukes hitting the prime site.  Well off the beaten path, and I had *plenty* of traffic there.
---
People looking to spend thousands of caps on a nice weapon or armor piece aren't going to be worried about 20 caps to get to the vendors.
---
No.i only build 1 character.that is all im intrested in.being able to build a different character tells me,yeah you are going to get bored at some point.if they just kept up with adding new content that would not happen.it would be different if you had different classes of characters,you know like a real mmo rpg.but this game doesn't.its same damn thing over and over.there is really no indistinguishable difference.you know what mean?if you have a fighter or a builder you would only use items for that character and class.my wife plays bdo.she is a gm and has 7 different characters.each with unique skills abilities amd weapons and armor.that is a reason i would have different builds.but here i have my character setup to do anything and take on anything.i have a collectron and extractor grabbing scrap.so i do not need to do junk runs.i nust go in and grind for treasury notes.i have already bought everything you can for gold bullion from  foundation and crater and the secret service except the T-65 P.A..I'm almost done with that.then there is nothing left to do in the game for me anyway.im only a level 230.
---
Far too late for that.
---
Its a glitch that went public short after the launch of wastelanders. Its not that present anymore because it got temporarily fixed but worked again a month later.
---
Hey mate you need a private world I'm willing let you use mine if your on ps4
---
A lot of people are burned out after the run. The new event was a nice addition but after doing it 30 or so times it gets kind of stale. The bugged nuke silos also kind of left myself and others with even less to do.
---
It’s a known issue, others have faced where Bethesda has addressed it but it’s been over a month, they said they tried a hot fix last month but it didn’t work, I’m also on Xbox so maybe that I dunno
---
Thats an interesting way. I considered it before secret service armor but couldnt really find good legendaries. I know with vanguards and SS armor, you might get some diminishing returns, but also would be the same for Bolstering then. So I say just keep vanguard.
---
He did say that though.
---
Really? That sucks...I appreciate the offer very grateful but unfortunately I’m on Xbox =(
---
Agreed. Don't mistake my post for supporting that freak, but getting the achievement is getting the achievement, and he got it months ago.
---
You can get a new Jangles at the Camden Park parking lot pretty much any time you want, btw.  Ive probably gotten, and scrapped, several dozen of them by now.
---
I never said you didnt own all the collections I'm not but hurt and beep bop I'm a robot explaining where you were wrong beep boo
---
season ended and people probably need a break
---
Oh I'm sorry to hear if you ask around or wait most of the community is real nice add the xbox help flair
---
That's why I put in a theremin.
---
People don't tend to post when they go a week without seeing a hacker.
---
Sams a badass, Frodo was just annoying....in the movies
---
Yes but when you get mobbed that tactic just doesn't work.
---
I agree 100%, I’ll spend anything on a Halloween bundle.
---
I know some guys who grinded the hell out of the repeatable xp challenge and I gotta say, not surprised to hardly ever see them playing now. One of them pops in for a little bit here and there. The others are done.
---
Your not
---
so what happened
---
WTF? What are you on about?
---
Yh dont blame them lol
---
Pipe revolvers are actually nice.
---
Burned out from being forced to log in daily, and nothing left to do.
---
When was the weapon nerf, got a link? or is that continued sarcasm?
---
I knew they'd come through for me but damn...😅
---
Drop your psn and Ill drop you some.
---
I just huffed my fourth one down in the cranberry bog.
---
I can get you on my Xbox private server if that will help compete that quest.
---
So you have looked and probably bought.
---
Yeah there wasn't a lot about them, but there are some holotapes I hadn't found before, that had more info on them. Roleplaying them is actually really fun. I made a fire station and called it "Firebreathers Second Company, The Hotshots."
---
I personally burst earl in about 30 seconds, then kill all the adds while it collapses. (You don't actually have to escape) If I wanted any junk or anything else of the sorts I just trade the Reclaimed Miner Helmet for em. The best xp farm you can do is go into a private lobby and take over every single workshop. Don't defend them, wait for them to turn into retakes. The amount of xp you get by going around and retaking workshops is amazing, boosted my buddy from 1 to 60 in about 3 or 4 hours doing this method.
---
Only on the contemporary bundle foundations!
---
Angry tutle on yt has a good vats sniper which could be modified into fitting yiur needs
---
Chances are you are not short, but we will need more info to be able to Help you.
---
Whats your current level? Whats your Specials? (It may help) 
---
list what you have (Nukes and Dragons may help here)
---
Absolutely.  Weapon and armor plans (and weapon mods, at that level) are your key to a bright future in FO76, and decent building plans help you create a space of your own that you’ll enjoy coming back to, and will encourage others to come and enjoy.
---
so i just wasted my time?
---
I run ricochet bloody mess starched genes one gun army class freak 14 pts in luck, I consider them all essential but if I dropped one it would be one gun army, then class freak.
---
My advice become wanted most players and teams will hunt you down
---
Never seen a fridge. What does it do?
---
Good for you!
---
Yeah what lethal said, pvp is more fun when you’re doing it as a play date. 
---
I make one wrong move against my friends railwayrifle and my tesla isn’t fast enough to down him he melts me with his railway spikes, it’s so funny.
---
Lighten up
---
Well he does. He’s a garbage person that only cares about money.
---
Quite, Rifle Gaming on Youtube has a couple of videos where he goes around to different parts of West Virginia and compare them to the game. He has also gone to Fasnacht in Helvetia.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Evsy04Iukyw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Evsy04Iukyw)
---
I had a Guerrilla build at one ppint.  I carried a furious ffr 25% less vats and a furious explosive 25% less vats auto 10mm's.   With the right load out and mods it was pretty much unlimited AP which combined with concentrated fire, gunfu, and adrenaline was actually a pretty fun build.
---
I hope they bring back the Halloween stuff to the shop well ahead of the actual holiday, too.
---
I mean I’m willing to give it a try to see if that’ll work, cause i tried server hopping and all that none of which worked my gamer tag is Makhshikyan
---
Appreciate the help
---
Its utterly senseless. With even some mediocre legendary equipment levels doesn't matter anymore from lvl 50 on. Anyone can kill everyone when they get the first shot.
---
I'll bet they were stoked. "They totally do sell at that price!"
---
I dunno.  My plans aren’t 5 caps, they’re 25, but they ARE all ultra cute.
---
Sadly, I couldn't for the life of me figure out the code for Project Purity.  After I looked it up I felt like such an idiot.   
---
Subsequent playthroughs made me feel even worse.
---
I'm gonna be grinding events tommorw your welcome to join if your on ps4
---
If someone told me Bethesda accidentally made the game think the SBQ was a 2-star, I'd believe them. Two star is about the best I remember getting from looting that thing.
---
Yep
---
I actually just set up a diner/bar built suspended up inside one of the powerline towers and I distill and sell alcohol and assorted berry drinks since I sadly can’t sell food. Or when I have visitors and friends I’ll cook up my uncooked radstag or Brahmin and give out free food
---
Yeah if only it had sentinel...
---
One effect away from a Batman build
---
Yes you can lol! I believe you’ll get there. GL homie
---
Additionally, please add some more music to the radio.  
---
Classical, Appalachia Radio, Raider Radio, the works.  
---
(The FO4 raider radio was amazing, especially Red-Eye singing)   
---
I enjoy the radio for the atmosphere, but it gets grating hearing Julie repeat her heartfelt story or hearing Old Man Mose over and over again.
---
You have loaded into a nuke zone. You can stay in this world or try and find another world.
---
I got one a little closer to what you an I want but not exactly. SS unyielding +1 str wrr right arm. It's better than anything else.
---
Still not fixed when will this issue be addressed it's been all day already. This is a little ridiculous
---
All I know is that I can tank tesla shots a lot better in full Assassin/AP/Sent Leather than I could in Assassin/AP/Sent Heavy Combat.
---
That's pretty neat but what if they just clip through the door
---
Gamer tag is nethaq, invite incoming.
---
There should be a deep freezer that's earnable in-game, that completely stops food spoilage, but maybe it continuously requires some resource, like cryo cells.
---
Get a lot of great reactions from what I've got so far, just am constantly wrestling with the maxed out budget. 
---
Can't wait foe those mannequins but without the instanced camp spaces not sure how I'd ever get even just 1 to fit.
---
Really hoping those instanced spaces are a dynamic space we can adapt as we need and not just an oversized prefab that wont snap anywhere in a way that looks good.
---
Am really hoping it's something more along the lines of us converting a built space to have an instanced interior with maybe special doors and or trap doors (think the floor safe stash) to allow us to integrate them smoothly. 
---
Suspect it will just wind up being whichever is most inconvenient for us tho.
---
Does anyone know if the Halloween smoke machine is separate from the Mothman smoke machine limit wise? I missed out on the Halloween one last year,  and I see that the Mothman one is limited to 1 per camp, 2 if it's a workshop oddly enough. Am hoping that's separate the Halloween one. 
---
I love setting up a pitch black room with smoke as the transition between the misty and nightmare sides of my camp.
---
Gotta find me at least one of those red nurses outfits before October. XD
---
One great annoyance I've not been able to work past is the direction my camp faces.
---
The way its supposed to work is I enter a normal looking house,  but a hidden door transitions to into the nightmare that goes some 5 stories below ground level to a creepy burning alter.
---
I got it to work using a cliffside to build a second large house behind the smaller front house below the cliffside. Using various tricks their perfectly aligned allowing them to share floors and ceilings. 
---
The problem is that the front of the house faces south. Meaning no matter how far I move the camp device south of the front door it always spawns them in the middle or back of the house.
---
Had to use up a big chunk of budget to get people to spawn between the 2 structures, then having to set up arrows and lanterns to guide people back to the entrance.
---
If they move too fast tho upon fast traveling they get stuck in the foundation or fall off the cliff and are on the backside wondering why they can't open the door to the vendor room.
---
Really it severely damages the surprise they should be experiencing in the transition because of they even manage to find the front of the house now they know theres a giant structure in the back.
---
I looked far and wide and just could not find another cliff face with a straight drop of about 3 stories that faces the north. Let alone one that shares a random assault spawn point. 
---
I love returning to camp and always having some wackiness going on, usually allowing me to retrieve stims, scrap, exp, rep, and legendaries several times per day.
---
It's just east of foundation south of that big crater. 
---
I saw that theres one directly north of huntersville that almost meets my needs but the cliff drop is only like 1 - 2 stories at best. It's by that rest stop and parking lot with that stocked nuka cola machine.
---
Man thinking about it now would be ideal to represent that toilet Silent hill 2 starts in if I can just get the drop to work better. Will have to wait and see how the instanced spaces work out.
---
What I hope is that with the instanced space I'll be able to set up an insane nightmare realm with lots of manniquens and fun creepy set ups and loot to be found.  As an award to those patient enough to go through the entire experience I set my vendors up with the cheapest prices I can manage even for quality gear and plans.
---
With all that in the instance tho will allow me to free up 2 thirds of the budget deck out the front of the camp to better up the creepy clinic vibes.
---
This is pretty awesome! Can’t imagine all the though that went into this
---
i read you have to keep 2 animals alive for a chance of getting the plan. 
---
I bought the plan recently and i've been making them and giving them away on the xbone. They cost almost nothing to make and i am surprised more people don't sell them or give them away. The medic badge is one of the easiest to do
---
Seen that, walked past a camp that had the ammo factory ammo machine in it. I think I figured out how to do it, but not going to bother. I'm thinking attach something and blueprint.
---
It really depends on the day and the server.  I have had major disappointments with it and I've also been pleasantly surprised.  If you can get at least one good tank in a couple higher level shooters you should be fine.  It sucks to invest in the required card and then have the event fail immediately so I suggest waiting to do it until you don't feel like your caps are worth much.  If you are still penny pinching caps it's probably not a great time to do it.
---
I will be spending all of my atoms on Halloween stuff. I hope they bring back things I missed but I really am looking forward to whatever new items they add
---
i like this.
---
Best wishes to you and your family.
---
Hey, i know that song!
---
He's on PC, its a hacked weapon. There's all sorts of stuff like that all over PC
---
&gt; bugged nuke silos
---
What happened to the nuke silos?
---
How about the people that didn’t know you had to get the rewards from the atom shop for the first events? I donated over 20k resources and didn’t get the banner or the bos beret because I couldn’t get on to claim them. I think all the rewards need to be re-released several times leading up to the drop of the BOS content, especially as they are community challenges, meaning all members of the community should benefit regardless of whether they helped or not
---
Freedom of Speech. Okay, you're either American or an idiot, let's be generous and go with American.
---
First amendment, in full: " *Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or  prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of  speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to  assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.* "
---
Show me the place where it says private systems, citizens, or corporations cannot dictate the limits of that freedom when on their property. Hell, point out the part where a *state* cannot deny those same rights. Freedom of Speech means that Congress (And thus, by extension, the US federal government) cannot pass laws to curtail that speech. That is it. Nothing more.
---
Further, hiding behind "freedom of speech" when it does not apply is the first and most common sign of someone who has no idea what hate speech is, or even worse, has no problem with its use, usually because none of it applies to them but they can gleefully apply to others.
---
Ahhh, thanks!
---
I think they should add a consignment bot at White springs and each player could sell one specific item there whether they're on or offline.
---
I just put it on my excavator power armor yesterday, did you claim it from the game board?
---
Here is my old Stealth/Rifleman build.

Took a break as well and fortunately was able to get the award but damm, at least a week sounds good. Hope everyone got it

You can display them but they always revert to the same picture regardless of what you originally picked up.
---
you need to server hop at lot to get it done or do it on a private.
---
ONLY A QUARTER ASSED EFFORT, PRIVATE? DROP AND GIVE ME A HUNDRED!
---
Mmmmmm.i have a 3 star quad shotty with skeet shooter maxed and all shotgun perks maxed.its a 1 shot killer.my fav weapon.besides my fully modded guass shotty.that thing is like a shotgun sniper rifle.turns them into tato paste.
---
I’m level 47, but I’m down to help clear spawns with my quad double barrel! Butcherpete4 for anyone who wants to run it i got fallout 1st too
---
Good stuff, man.  I plugged mine with gas lamps, which are fine but don’t match at all.
---
I meant the people who go 'bethesda shouldn't update fo76 and delete it and should only work on docs and remakes of nv' those kind of people
---
Probably just saving on memory, they likely have it set to max at 1023 and just have it show 999 so it's less obvious
---
I have a job, thanks.
---
It's not "whining" to want to be able to get the Atoms that are earmarked for players but that can't be gathered, nor is it "whining" to want the system that was in place (daily and weekly quests) restored when the replacement (the SCORE board) isn't being used. 
---
Thanks tho!
---
Error with the code input.. right code but a glitch wouldn’t process as correct. People wasted a few nuke key cards. I did.
---
This but unironically
---
Its great for queen fights where she refuses to land. I've got a QE25 one and as long as I'm hitting her she can barely move, makes it that much easier to deal with.
---
Sometimes don't have any terminals in the silo for one.
---
What...so u are like this
---
code arent working right now.  You cant even do the leg work and get them the old fashioned way.  Even the screens in the command center are bugged.
---
I've done it on second story floors.
---
They can be annoying for heavies to deal with, especially for those with charge up weapons, since they stagger. 50 cal might help you get rid of a few just due to the big dps. I like using my junkies UGL or 50 cal when in Earle with my heavy full hp fella.
---
i would love recycled crap from the year before because i wasnt here the year before to get it.  not everyone was
---
And you have Fusion Cores?
---
Ditto this.  I've been picking up most of those sturdy and heavy armor plans in vending machines over the last couple days.
---
Yep. I'm in Oregon right now. My first thought was that I was in a radstorm.
---
Yh the argument fo76 is pay to win just because they add 3 items with function ti the atom shop is so bad
---
MSG, CADET? THAT’S COMMIE SAUCE!
---
I really miss the guaranteed heavy combat armor piece you'd get from the Scorched Earth event. I got a full set of Vanguard and Unyielding from that, was working on getting 3 star parts when they changed it, now all I get are freaking 1 star Mr. Handy Buzzblades and other nonsense. It's so rare I get anything good there anymore.
---
I mean... the CHANCE at something amazing like a Fixer drop is nice I guess, but a guaranteed "good" drop is better sometimes than a tiny chance at an RNG god roll on literally every possible drop in the game. Besides, we already get that roll on the actually drops from the mobs.
---
Hopefully the rewards from the upcoming daily ops and other new content will be a little more consistent? It'd be nice to be able to farm something specific again with regards to legendary instead of ALWAYS being at the mercy of RNG now.
---
Every time I display one they end up blank.
---
This is one of the coolest things I've seen someone do. Such a smart idea.
---
It wouldnt work for you either... If nerd rage is multiplicative with bolstering armor, that saves you then. I havent got mobbed to death over 200 levels, about 150 of them was without any particular armor or legendary.
---
No I was looking for a build and it suggested the weapons with prices because googles weird like that.
---
Ok just counted again twice and im not missing a perk point but I did level up twice but the game didn't allow me to bank the points
---
Oh I'm definitely holding out, gonna get a feel for how my current build works in the new model.
---
Let me know if you need help, I can consistently get 4-8 TD over an evening session. Some places to look are less worth the time than others but my top 3 are Charleston herald, whitespring bunker, sugar grove. In that order.
---
TIP - IF IT DOESN'T HAVE TD, DON'T LOOT IT!
---
Thanks!
---
How could you possibly want to cover up your excavator? The default excavator looks so badass
---
Why, so I can unwillingly and unknowingly walk under it easier than before? I say nay, and good day, sir!
---
I never even saw the original items, I wouldn’t mind 2 separate bundles maybe
---
18 on me, yeah
---
I've been getting 1* for months now.
---
This totally explains the lack of nuke zones anywhere since about Monday...thanks for spreading the news.  Hope it gets fixed soon.
---
I sell 95% of my plans and ammo for 5-25 caps at best. More often than not I just drop them for lower level players. You will find a few asshole high level players trolling your workshops but most are glad to just get rid of the plans. They eat up space lol
---
That's what I usually get too. I just don't remember ever getting any 3* legendary stuff from her.
---
Yep. And the tent needs to be placed before the event is initiated. I just did that yesterday and it worked great. I was on a alt that was level 20 and had 30 molotov cocktails with me.  Two 200+ showed up.  It was a good time, spawn started, i threw a cocktail, they wiped them out afterward.  I gave them a bunch of thumbs up and hearts and gained 3 levels.
---
A good fridge:freezer that is always available in The atom store. New characters are swimming in Atoms from easy challenges. Or make it a settler purchase option withbullion
---
What platform are you on and what build are you running?
---
I have quite a few things I don't use now that you might find useful!
---
So useless i never use it. I honestly prefer going with the "Good with Salt" rank 1 perk card. I just never think to take a look inside my fridge...
---
It just seems to be more easy for me to manage my food when i already have it my inventory.
---
same as with the budget for camp building, you gotta look at it from a performance standpoint.  just because you don't physically see items in your stash all the time doesnt mean they arent there taking up resources.  they designed it in a way to reduce as much lag for most players as possible with it being a multiplayer game with so many people on one server adding to it with their camps and inventories
---
Hey everyone!! I up voted this post :)
---
Sprinting is the same AFAIK.
---
Sept 15 is patch 22 and new season of legendary run
---
Damn I can't get it to clip to anything other than the bundle foundations, it's description even says it only connects to that.
---
Idk, it's not that bad but it's RNG after all. I'm sitting on 5 copies of elder that took maybe 7-10 days of regular playing to accumulate. 15-30 per is probaby a fair estimate, if a touch high.
---
Ps I assume it was 5 tries AFTER all other paints were learned.
---
How much are you over encumbered vs carry capacity in power armor?
---
Oh no... Not another one to collect
---
You may want to check out [Cladrite Radio](http://player.radiocoalition.org/cladrite). It's the bees knees!
---
Agree, never bought a fridge before because it's useless.
---
My feeling is anything that counts toward stash space shouldn’t  count towards budget.
---
I agree the fridge doesn't work any better than 1 rank of Good with salt! At least make food last 2 times longer if you it's going to take up camp space and I have to fast travel back to my camp to retrieve the food!
---
I would check the bethesda website and see if they made a patch to overencumberence because in all reality, you shouldn't be able to be that over encumbered in the first place. Every other game caps your movement especially being hundreds of lbs overweight.
---
Just today I had a high level come by my venders,I'm lvl 13 they invited me to a party, built me a nice generator and water purifiers, threw up some home decor. Really was the nicest thing anyones done in f76 I was super appreciative. Oh also they crafted me a sick lvl 15 shotgun.
---
I GUESS I’M A RACIST YOU COMMIE LOVING BASTARD!
---
But no, I downvoted *because* you pulled a bullshit race card at *this* time of all of them.
---
Yeah best part of the next season is there are gonna be loads more weeklies to get us to the end.
---
I'd buy that off you if you didn't already scrip it!
---
Love the one in Watoga with the vertabot in the background!
---
Funny enough in 900+ hours not one player begged me for anything.
---
They did it with the Mountain Scout Outfit with Wastelanders, but that was baked into the update files. These rewards needed to be awarded or not awarded multiple times a week, and to have the same code to auto-add them would require pushing an update file every 3-4 days, which can't happen on consoles due to the approval process.
---
The atom shop however can be changed server-side, since all the assets are added in an update ahead of time, and the game asks the server which ones it should show, all without ever having to wait for Microsoft and Sony approval to deploy the update.
---
Sounds scary.  And have all the items work and cause no glitches or bugs.  Now THAT would freak us all out.
---
I just want a medieval knight costume to complete my knight-errant roleplay. We got samurai and gladiator costumes last Halloween, so it's totally possible.
---
I’m on Xbox. I’m not really doing much aside from being a scavenger really. I tend to use my sniper rifle more than anything though. I’m squishy.
---
10:1 about my going rate for ‘would anybody ever want to buy this’ versus ‘this doesn’t fit me at all, but SOMEBODY will want it.’  Best thing I got from Mumps recently was an Explosive Troubleshooter +25 VATS which I occasionally pull out when I need to smoke a bunch of robots.
---
If I wanna be over encumbered and stop moving to refill my AP every 10 seconds while everyone gets to run on, shouldn't be an issue.
---
If me carrying a lot of weight while not specced into % weight reductions that's in the game is more game breaking than bloodied one shot builds... I dunno
---
INT is the new casual, you know. ;-)
---
15 seconds before the event ends just go stand by an extractor. Free easy rads
---
Has it been confirmed that perks coins will be part of the next update and season 2.  I'm waiting on making ammo so I can use legendary perk and make a ton of ammo.
---
I thought the billboard up on the hill just east of Blackwater mined that has a whole bunch of cats could also be built on.
---
isnt unlocked resource mean FREE? Only locked thing in my camp is the secret fake fireplace door lol... water, ammo, scraps all good for the taking!
---
Also, I never had Sup Req as currency lol, bobby pins and propaganda paper on the other hand, a few times.
---
You can have between 800-900 more pounds than your Max Carry Weight in this game before you are unable to carry more.
---
I would like a secondary perk card loadout that would make it much quicker to swap between a main combat loadout to a C.A.M.P. crafting/building loadout and back again.
---
Damn, I literally dumped about 300+
---
Yes - next week
---
And I doubt they will ban folks for the Epstein meme. But there are conspiracy theories and groups that directly encourage violence and the threat of violence, like Q-anon and their *totally* nonviolent militia supporters. that's what this TOS change is about.
---
This is ass coaverage, and nothing more. They updated the language to be clear as fuck, so that the next time they get an anti-homo hit squad, they can ban them and point at the TOS and say "that was all the warning we needed to give".
---
Ill play with you whenever my GT is Denon Channy
---
You know that Gutsies are a satire about American jingoism and McCarthyism right?
---
Has this been a thing before? Been playing for 6 months and this has never been an issue for me.
---
Just checked, even without bandolier equipped I'm at 740 over my weight. That's within the limits you're saying
---
Music is difficult cus they have to get the rights and all that legal nonsense.
---
Yes because NV is better than 76
---
\*push to talk\* how hard could it be. extra mouse button on the side is perfect. even in action packed FPS games, its easy.
---
Great. Good to know!
---
When is the sale?
---
I randomly logged in after 6 months of not playing and grabbed the collectron haha.
---
Most of the negative comments are taking it literally saying if you're house is burning down you shouldnt be worried about this. I could have worded it better by saying communities are being routed and over all tension is high with players due to so many factors outside of themselves. But I decided against fighting back and hoped this type of post finds a good place. Many of us are just running around trying to keep afloat and using a game to keep our brain floating until the next storm. I know for me it always ended up being something small that either had me in complete tears or excitement. For some something as small as a free BoS trash collector could be a light they needed. But it's fine that my post gets smacked around. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe the world is not as bad as I thought and it's all in my head 😂
---
From an earlier thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bce5f4/stash\_management\_tips/ekpw0yg](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bce5f4/stash_management_tips/ekpw0yg?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)
---
So they should stop all updates to a game quiet alot of people enjoy to work on a game that doesnt work on moden gen consoles to make a few thousand people happy can you not see flaws here
---
The bigger vault tec stairs won't let you fall down the sides at least. The "smaller " ones sure have a gap but it's still less than normal stairs.
---
I want one like those lab eye wash stations that like shotgun your face with water.
---
Oh i will go take a look! Thank you!!
---
&gt; Good with salt is 90%. Fridge is 50%.
---
Which in itself doesn't do justice, until you think about what it means - it's a % reduction, not a boost.  So in a sense, good with salt is 5x as strong as a fridge.  
---
If something lasts 1 hour.  With a fridge, it's 2 hours.  Good with salt, it's 10 hours.  Huge difference.
---
Yeah this thing was back in fallout 4, so it's been recycled twice now for this game.
---
The whole point of the fridge was too be aesthetic because if it gives too much of a bath then it is clearly a pay to win item. If I have scorchbeast steaks or cranberry cobblers premade ready to go for a long time that puts me at a significant advantage
---
Very cool
---
Hell. I could make use of nocturnal pipes; it's these damn bone clubs.
---
I have Sofia and love it when Athena shows up (not that she ever has anything I want to buy, but I still get a kick when she finds new butterflies for her collection).  The problem is that I also always seem to get the wandering merchant at the same time.  Add my Collectron to the mix and things start to get mighty noisy around there...
---
Sadly, cores are not the heaviest, that title remains with the glorious Mini Nuke. Which, I have a habit of hoarding.   I love all you players that just drop them
---
Sweet.  Going to have enough ammo for fighting a army.
---
But... but i do sell the games for about 222 caps. I do ask for my teammates tho. 99% they dont care... magazines 39, bobbleheads 55 caps, they all sell like butter.
---
You still get a guaranteed 2* mystery pick from the event itself.
---
This will be an incorrect statement when legendary cards come out. But for now you are correct.
---
Yes, it has been a thing for a long time.
---
I forget the exact time, but a few months into this game's life, they gave you a carrying cap to avoid exploits and glitches.
---
So if your Carry Weight IN Power Armor is 255, you won't be able to move well if you're holding around 1,100 pounds of stuff.
---
Bandolier is reducing the weight of all your Ballistic Ammo, and bringing you below that threshold.
---
I raise to you my Gs2525 minigun.
---
That’s the reason I hesitate to get too many animals.  I already go ballistic if I hear a random molerat chomping on my mine car planter.  If I heard them harassing my pet my head would fly clean off.
---
My sentiments exactly
---
Wait, what? I love my doors open, quite welcoming.
---
I've posted about this before, and I still think it's a dangerous gamble by Bethesda, not giving us any daily or weekly challenges all week. I mean sure, playing the game at a slower pace felt nice for a day or two (and I have some chores left to do in game, of course, like topping up scrip on five characters, and I should really work on doing the vault heist on my fourth char before 1W goes live and the dang assaultrons level up even more, but who likes to do chores, right?), but some of the people they are driving away will not come back next week.
---
Don't worry about me, worry about the player base dwindling.
---
dug on wendigos!
---
totally agree with this!  I love having a little town going on, as my base was made to act like a little watering hole full of life.
---
Got Sofia walking around aimlessly with my deathclaw watching over the camp area to protect my vendors for passerbys.  Id love to get all the allies at once honestly, on the condition you have to fully complete their story missions, I think that would be fair but Im sure it has something to do with lag, latency or something like that :(
---
Maybe they changed it in a patch or maybe it's just a build bug I had
---
No, because without bandolier I have 984lbs when my carry weight is 240. That makes me only 744 over the carry weight. Well off the limits you're talking about.
---
Not that many people PvP anymore on PC. What did you want to know? I am always up for a fight if you want someone to shoot at.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
wait wait,  where do you place the tent for that glitch to happen ?
---
Most cool things we get to do are bugs.
---
AGREED
---
Lol mad cuz bad
---
It might be a lower number then. I forget if it's a fixed number or a Ratio. I can carry up to 1,200 lbs when my Carry Weight is 350.
---
But it's clear that that's your limit. It's not a bug, or a weird interaction with Bandolier.
---
Damn.  Only play at night
---
There’s lots of info on this on the pts forums. And hard fact info not peoples theories etc. Anyone who wants to know all about it I’d suggest going there and doing some digging cause man there’s a lot of misinformation and bad math being spread. I don’t mean this post I mean in general.
---
Gotcha, well thanks for the input anyway!
---
Not unless you've been to a fight or event together, no!if you just see a guy thats fighting something while you pass by, and they die, maybe.
---
but for me, I never loot if i see someone dying, and if I see hungry looters I just  sit on the loot bag till the owner comes. Some people really spend a lot of time and effort to gather some materials. You woulnt know until you run out of something.
---
Also don't forget that even if your only financial outlay on the game is the initial purchase, Bethesda can still make money from your game play.  
---
Gamer count figures, regular players, average hours played, daily login's, are all financial numbers to companies.  If they can demonstrate to investors, banks, financial institutes, that "their product" can generate gamer involvement,  they can get more investment, lower cost loans or even defer payments easier.  
---
It's all about money..
---
Ever onward...I have 3 pieces of 3* Unyielding, and I think one has +1 Agility, but the other legendary effects aren’t what I want.  I figure it’ll be awhile before everything gets settled.
---
&gt;"My version of the incident is more or less the same as the public  has taken it, the only differences being the fact that I don't hate gay  people. It was just a late night of having fun and after the first  encounter (seen on my channel) we felt it would be fun to offend them  somehow. You can call that evil but I think it's just playful  immaturity.  
---
&gt;"I do not regret the incident. I will not apologise  given the opportunity. I don't plan on doing anything like this in the  future but to be fair I didn't plan the initial incident, I just found  them and decided to go through with it."  
---
That was the response from the "cleanse the aids" anti-gay hit squad leader last year, after their *three day ban*. The world is a shitty place and getting shittier, and people are using all sorts of excuse to be blatant fuckwads and then say "bUt YoUrE tAkInG mE oUt Of CoNtExT"
---
Zenimax is covering their asses by including every possible angel they can think of that would cause this sort of shit and saying "You can be banned for this, watch your ass". That's all this is. They're not going to ban you for shouting fuck after you get dongpiled by earl again any more than they banned everyone who bought those bullshit hacked weapons. They could not give two shits, that's what the "M rated interaction" bit covers. Cuss it the fuck up, you're not the only one. Fuck earl! I say it right to his face!
---
But now, next time they get something like the guy above, they can ban them and point at the TOS and say "we warned you." When some asshole grabs the latest trendy word to use for "black" because they already know they can't drop the n-word any more but this latest option hasn't been picked up by the national media yet, there is the TOS. When a pile of dickwaffles says "we're just roleplaying that lynch mob", TOS. This is a preemptive action taken so they can quote the rules after they ban someone for being an absolute muffin.
---
(And never mind the Freedom of Speech arguments this will inevitably create from my fellow Americans, because anyone who makes that argument here has never once read or understood the US constitution).
---
They do if you bash them with it, which is just weird!
---
As a newcomer, this makes a lot of sense now.
---
LtntHairyDumas
---
You rock!  Genuine write up from someone who enjoys the game. I didn't do much damage either until I leveled high and used perk cards wisely. Perk cards are important
---
Never had this issue before. Didnt have this issue when I played earlier this afternoon like 5 hours ago. If I wasn't over my limit when I signed out, why I would be over my limit when I sign in?
---
lol i usually leave fertilizer. But if the price is too high, and you kill the brahmin, loot all the razorgrain as well so they cannot immediately repair lol
---
The max weight you can carry, before you can't pick up anything is around 1850.
---
I was away for a week and completely missed my chance to get the beret from the shop which kinda bummed me out so I hope they so this.
---
Being 744 over carry weight is just plain stupid on anything but a mule.
---
I'm just kind of annoyed that for how expensive FO1ST is, you don't get much and very obvious QOL features are absent.  I speak, of course, of how the scrap box doesn't let you scrap weapons, clothes, armor, and mods.
---
Don't prime it/make ultracite ammo for it yet! Wait for The ammo factory legendary perk, you can turn 2 normal cores into 9 ultracite not including super duper!
---
Shits getting real for us in Oregon! Stay safe,to all fellow Wastelanders
---
Thanks for the info, man! I'll definitely check that out. I didn't know where to get legit info outside of youtube videos and the like.
---
That's true, I meant the "Slow Speed" Forced Cap.
---
I have the same plasma and I'm super pumped for that perk😎
---
Ah btw, how much luck would you need to get a 1:1 ratio with a crit refill gun and rank 1 crit savy? Since we can use legendary cards to go over 15, this could be interesting.
---
It's caused by ash piles. If you get that, go inside defiance and back out to reload the cell. Radiation rumble too, fix ya right up but doesn't stop unlootable ash piles from blocking your precious sadly.
---
Meaning you can't tell people how to, say, duplicate your gear, or get infinite atoms, or other such things that have happened.
---
Any one know the timing of the raider collectron? An item every 4 minutes, an I am every 5 minutes?
---
You might have had a food buff like Radstag meat or a Chem that buffed your Strength active that expired.
---
Thats what I always what i do. "You are wanted, friend, you need dying? want me to kill you?" lol
---
Oh, I get it. You want to have the last word. No problem, just reply one more time and it’s all yours.
---
Do you have any advice on which ones work the best? :o
---
They don't care about that. They care about "there the f\*ck did that n&lt;\*\*\*&gt; player go".
---
because season has finished
---
I tried fast traveling back to the area but it didn't help. If it happens again I'll try that. Thanks!
---
Herbivore and healing factor. Don't use carry weight items. That's why I use % weight reduction armors/perks
---
Thanks for the advise man that was pretty helpful
---
I met the Fo 4 Deezer today selling lemonade and Lemonade recipes at stand near the Wayward today, that kind of content can make your gaming session for the day, if you recognise it.
---
I love you. Thank you.
---
If it gets the jump on me, I will obliterate it. If nobody else got a hit, tough shit. I’m not dying so everyone can get a hit.
---
No problemo 😎
---
Yes. However, gauss weapons can't have the explosive legendary effect, because gauss weapons have explosive damage by default.  The Demolition Expert perk does indeed add damage to gauss weapons though.
---
Another great idea that will never be implemented. Thanks Bethesda!
---
A level 0 lock costs almost nothing. If you can't be bothered with a level 0 lock, then I assume it's either free game, or you don't care enough to give your stuff even a token defense.
---
Same as here BUCS_LIFE_1976
---
Appreciate it! Add me I'll find you when I'm on next!
---
You need anything? Caps or junk etc?
---
Who has a meltdown about that? I have a policy about all locks on my camp: I don’t want you to take my shit, so I lock it down. If you want it badly enough and you can pick the locks, then fair game. You get the prize. No one is melting down or even getting slightly annoyed by someone taking 5 bottles of water or a handful of collectron scrap. I thought what I said was fairly clear. How is it being misunderstood so thoroughly?
---
I haven't played in a few months so I'm new to this whole S.C.O.R.E. business
---
My usually busy vendor is not seeing many visits
---
All rewards will either be repeated in the next run and/or available for purchase with gold bullion
---
It’s level 60 or so is when you can theoretically have a complete build. My PvP commando build was finished at 57.
---
Hurr hurr hurr
---
I want that as a looping emote!
---
You said it all...
---
Legendary cards dont allow over 15. 15 is still the hard cap.
---
Crit meter fill rate = (Luck x 1.5) + 5
---
Using 15 luck as an example. 
---
- (15 × 1.5) +5 = 27.5. Aka 27.5% meter fill per hit.
---
If only using 1 rank of crit savy and a crit fill weapon, you need about 44 luck to get a crit proc off every hit.
---
Bullion would be fairer.  500 for a camp plan.
---
Np, good luck with your build.
---
The [framed lighthouse photo](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Framed_lighthouse_photo) shows up correctly in the display cases. AFAIK it's the only one that does.
---
GUYS... I didn't put the samples in the centrifuge.
---
I placed the fuse - went and got the ghoul sample - analysed samples from doctors pc menu - went straight into the weird tube thing. 
---
At no point did I touch the centrifuge. I originally came here finding out what would happen because I skipped the centrifuge all together by accident. But I passed the quest anyway.
---
Hope this helps 👍
---
Just checked, no it doesn’t.
---
Yeah the only time that happens is when I'm having a heavy battle. I'm a big guns build so all my damage perks are in the strength tree, so is all the carry weight stuff. Between that and the fact that your normal armor unequips when you get into PA, yeah my carry weight is high af.
---
When I'm not doing just big guns damage and I'm not in PA it's something like 280/355 on average. Really very reasonable.
---
Glow sight does not work on the wendigo spawns they just look like glowing wendigos.
---
Murgle’s Coffee Shop is definitely not in the lushest of locations, but the warm purple glow at night in that spot is really attractive. Don’t knock it till you try it!
---
I don’t think this is accurate?
---
The only people that try to initiate pvp with me are level 2s fresh out of the vault with either their bare fists or a machete. My camp is across from the wayward so I get a lot of them.
---
Yeah explosives got nerfed into oblivion in the first few months of the game! You want fully automatic ballistics for the best damage.
---
Nuclear material
---
Thanks for this, it was very informative and is much to take into consideration.

As a matter of the certain amount of ~450 DR being an effective ceiling, it sounds like it's just been shorthanded so often down from "if you're asking if the grind is worth it, there's nothing in the game that will kill you in T-60 that won't kill you in T-65" to instead "anything past 450 is too little for too much", eventually conflating the actual stat effectiveness with the player returns for time and effort.
---
Only hearing often of this colloquial of it though, I just assumed it was like Skyrim with a hard % cap, in which case, yeah, it would all be valid. I had no idea resistance went up to 99% instead, which changes everything.
---
That said, to me, "diminishing returns" is still more a concern of what I'm having to give up for said returns, be that a disproportional amount of time and effort, RNG grief, legendary stars, perk slots, etc., in return for how much I'm getting back, so I can see how this distinction gets blurred easily. Like, just one piece of +25 Poison Resist is "doing a hell of a lot more for me" than if I ground out five of them for what +125 gives instead. Likewise certain perk cards not being worth their points given the alternatives, no matter which way you flip them, which is why I fathom this probably came about from primarily the divide between T-60 and T-65, and therein that 450 number, as nothing is technically keeping *everyone* from getting a set of it but the cost of their own time.
---
There are also other implications to me that arise from reading this, and of scrutinizing the FO4 formula properly for the first time. Like why something like a TSE Minigun is so *ass.* All those tiny shots don't match up to equivalent hard-hitting slower shots—or in the case of melee, one-shots, which explains so much—they're all getting stuck in that viscous gel of a formula trapping small damage, whether or not there's a lot of it at the same time. And that energy damage not getting armor penetration isn't a FO76 issue, it's all the way from damn FO4.
---
Also, if talking effective health, it should be mentioned then of not just Damage Reduction% and DR armor stat, but also straight-up Health itself, like Lifegiver and whatever Endurance still works. At some point it's going to be worth more to simply get more Health to take full advantage of the reduction of damage coming in, be it for time spent or in the actual math itself.
---
Angry turtle showed in a video, that you can go over the hard cap with the new cards. But 44 still will be hard to reach. Is 44 with or without a crit refill gun?
---
Can't figure out how to properly quote so I'll just post the link to the reply:

That ain't love out there!
---
Yeah, the only drawback to this, although very small and bullion is what I would prefer, you’d have to finish wastelanders to acquire it. I run herbivore and I’d love to not have to carry  around 30 corn soup, challys feed and cranrelish.
---
Oh you got me there, i will give it a try! Is not that I'm in the camp that often lol
---
If it was JUST supposed to be asthetic in the first place, it should've been STASH skins that looked like refrigerators.
---
All they need to do is make an ugly one obtainable through game play, then they can still sell 'aesthetic' skins... 
---
Giving all players a few slots for food isnt game breaking.
---
Tomorrow, it doesn't work on legendary modules or Vault steel though.
---
I claimed everything, I believe.
---
As I said, I got the atoms from clicking on the last square, took this photo.
---

Cause nobodys nuking the mine, theres no atoms or dailies to chase. The past few weeks have been busy with meat week, earle and the run and now theres just nothing except to finally get rid of notes and scrip. They really just let all that momentum come to a total stop.
---
9 hours? That’s just stupid. Play another game if you really want PvP.
---
I cant believe these are not been fully mentioned but: Have your camp available to EVERYONE !!! Meaning, dont make a big box camp where you hide everything behind a locked door. Not only people can glitch in, there is nothing to hide lol let people visit and explore your base. I often make a detour to visit someones camp to dump my junk and see their items on sale, only to find out I cant even get in! Guess what, Im not gonna buy crap from you buddy.
---
Have your vendors at an easily visible places.Have at least 1 workbench easily accessible, possibly all workbenches, actually.Have stashboxes readily available places.Keep your decontamination arch at easily available places BUT somewhat away from the central cluster, and add a switch, dont force people to go thru it.Rest is not ethics per se, but Id say kind to provide.Have at least 1 water source (Preferably 1 dirty and 1 purified)Have at least 1 soup plant, like corn, razorgrain, gourd, where people in need can cook.Have at least 1 decent bed available, a musical instrument is a big plus too.
---
Sure!  But it depends on how you wanna kick ass.  Which means which weapons you want to mainly use.  For instance, I use my fixer a lot as my go-to.  It's an automatic rifle.  So I stacked up Commando perk cards under perception.  I do a lot more damage per shot.  Combined with a bunch of Luck cards which help with extra damage and crit shots, i can wipe out enemies without a panic.  
---
There is no right or wrong way to set up perk cards, but try to do so at your advantage. Base it around what weapons you have, and make sure you read the descriptions of what the cards do. However, when I was in your shoes at a lower level, I had to use a lot of perk cards for strength simply because I needed the carry weight.  You can always move cards again once you become level 100+ just because of all the perk points you'll have along with better legendary armor.  
---
Have fun.  You can't screw it up
---
Score is over for a week
---
3700+ hours in, still a way to go.
---
No problem fellow Wastelander!
---
I feel that on a personal level. I'm lucky I even completed the Legendary Run. A lot of atoms went into that, let me tell you.
---
With a crit fill gun. Ill have to checkout his video.
---
It still really bothers me that even when someone agrees with you and fixes the issue it's more important for people to feel the need to still complain and bitch about what ends up being a moot issue. 
---
Learn to take yes for an answer.
---
There's an area if you take the river south just a little bit of the dandelion graphic on the map that has three brahmin perma-spawns.
---
Yeah, the youtuber Dr. Broomstick said it in one of his videos once he spent like 9 hours searching for enough pvp to make a video. That video had like 2 players he fought in it
---
Food in the mini fridge should never go bad.. the only way it would be useful.
---
I don't know what to tell you. You're trying to argue against a mechanic that is in the game. Something happened that affected your Carry Weight, and you hit your Cap. That's it.
---
The only reason to finish quickly the Queen is to run Earle. If that happens I don't complain.
---
Also discount the legendary modules and Vault steel, with gold bullion weapons and armor I really need to roll as many as I can.
---
Luckily the post is now being upvoted at least despite the comments. It might just be a run off from the other posts but meh, who cares, at least it'll be there for people to see along with the comments being polar opposite. You are absolutely right though, sometimes with all the crap going on we as gamers just want that little something as a pick me up. Considering how many people have been clamoring for BoS stuff these items in particular were in high demand, hence the outcry for Bethesda's original absurdly high bar to reach those rewards. Not that I think the community should always get everything, but the math put things literally out of reach unless every single person could farm on private servers as a full time job.  
---
I know I'm digressing a bit but game companies who go out of their way to do things for customers/gamers without having to be told/asked to do so gain such a great reputation. Those who don't,  well just look at the mess with EA putting commercials in UFC (yes I know it was in replay mode but still.) They knew it was going to be a huge issue. Most companies know things are going to be an issue before they do it, but if they do a bunch of those "things" then the community usually only choose one or two out of the bunch to push back hard against. Then if it gets changed they rejoice in victory praising the company for listening, when in reality they still lost all those other battles they didn't push as hard for and the company knows it.  
---
Honestly, I feel old for saying it, but I miss how things used to be lol. Complete games on release. Zero microtransactions. Plus even when online games did come about it seemed most of the ones I played would do things for their player base and send random rewards and thank you for playing through in game mail. I was happier (less frustrated really) as a gamer back then and so were pretty much all the people online I grouped with. In FO76 I couldn't wait for BoS to join the world, but I cant handle still playing every day after having pretty much doing so for season 1 and having the mindset of being a collector with how things have gone these past months, so with season 2 I think I'll be playing something else and see how I feel doing so. If I knew for certain that every item I would want would be available for gold later on, then that would help so I could still play at my own pace and keep my sanity from a collector's mindset. Which is how I'm sure many felt about these 3 day item claim periods. It's all the same thing in the end. After "beating" the game most I know turned into collectors as well. It's what keeps us playing despite the repetition. Our bug filled repetition.
---
Do you have a citation for that? Also everyone on the trip said that didn’t happen so why do you believe that?
---
Remember - One Wasteland also goes live, along with the damage nerf.
---
So mobs will be higher;  you'll do less damage.  You are going to need that extra mmo :)
---
Then it wasn't claimed.
---
Do you have the Jangles Stein, Captain Cosmos Gameboard, or Planetarium Lamp available to build in your CAMP/showing in the Atom Shop?
---
I should probably actually work on a legitimate build lol. My go-to build in Fallout 4 was “take a ton of drugs and hope for the best”. Doesn’t work nearly as well in Appalachia
---
I do Paddle Ball Vs. Paddle Ball
---
All of them I doubt. On the PTS you can buy with bullion, the chicken coop and the ammo converter. Also lunch boxes. That’s it so far. Also the rewards for the next run are all different except lunch boxes and scruff like that.
---
Not sure why all the hate for nocturnal on this sub, but it makes it nice to find cheap rolls
---
I’m tired of seeing people complain that they missed it. It’s been scheduled for a long time and if you can participate and grind to don8 for the event then you should be able to set an alarm for a free Collectron. 
---
People are mad because it was in the shop for 3 days during a holiday, a work holiday. You all should’ve been home checking the shop because of this event. I highly doubt a lot of the people crying even participated, if you played recently and knew about the event details then you would notice things like free stuff in the shop. Bethesda is the sucker here, rereleasing it because everyone cried.
---
44 with 15 crit refill. Damn so it doesnt work, i thought about using savy on rank 1 and 4 leaf clover on 3 and a refill gun to get even better than 1:1.
---
Btw: you still have only 15 points for perks with the new cards but the special stat shown in the pip boy grew.
---
The Easter eggs while nice, don't provide an ingame benefit like the collection does.
---
Don't tell him its in the raw chicken.
---
I feel like if this game didn't have artificial limits set on all the different currencies, budget, weight, etc, that people would be a little less giving.
---
However, since we do have those limits turned on, it definitely gives people who are probably NEVER that generous an easy opportunity to be. I mean... only a total jerk would delete stuff out of spite rather than just give it to a low level. Even leaving stuff in the suitcase at a train station is better than just deleting it and I come across a lot of stuff in those suitcases lol.
---
Maybe all the Grinch's that started out playing FO76 have now turned over a new leaf and will find themselves helping out lower level players in the next game they play because of it.
---
You need to set your perk cards before you go into a big fight.
---
Use heavy gatlin type guns.preferably 3 stars.grab alot of stimpacks rad away and rad x.get some bufftats huge help.get or make foods that give you buffs and extra xp..i use a 2 shot gatlin laser 3 star with burning effects.plus a guass shotty fully modded.also make sure you have really good armor.if you are low level focus more on the spawns and reviving each other and other players.that mirv launcher is garbage since they nerfed them.
---
And that is dependent on Strength, as that is the actual carry limit. 
---
If you have max carry+1 you are already at slow speed, and the walk of shame is just stalled by amount of AP you have.
---
There is no set number that is valid across the board.
---
I sided with Foundation because the people there are actually nice.
---
I vaccinated the raiders and they still threaten and insult me constantly. screw that.
---
Needs an Legendary Auction House.
---
For people who weren't there when they were released the community was having a fit about P2W atom shop items at the time so released fridge was essentially useless and utility was severely diminished. 
---
Pretty sure intentions were to release a more useful item initially
---
This is amazing!
---
That must have been the one I saw. Thanks for the info.
---
Cool, good to know. Was wondering if it gave you some sort of effects.
---
IS THAT SOMEBODY WHO NEEDS ME TO KICK THEIR ASS?
---
Complete build is not necessary to do everything in game.  I'd be willing to bet you have plenty of things in your build that arent needed just nice to haves.
---
15th
---
I do what I can (though I don't always consider level ~110) to be a high level. But I always make a point to allow the "little guys" get some hits on the legendaries and other important ones.
---
When doing the event up at the Son's of Dane Compound for making noise etc I always make a point to hop into voice chat to remind people to let EVERYONE get a hit on the end boss. I get a few people who will either go on VC and get grumpy but I mostly get emotes of thumbs up. I know sometimes people forget to let the little lvl 30's get a hit on so the event was worth it for everyone.
---
Oh okay thanks
---
The real ammo value is already in memory so this makes no sense.  More likely it is limited due to UI design only leaving space for 3 digits.
---
Nah.  For real just have fun with your boyfriend.  Explore all the map.  Just have fun even while dying.  There's a lot to do.  You'll level up quick and earn level 50 legendaries.... then worry about your build.
---
I agree with you 1000%. My problem, then as now, is they haven't done this. So increasing marginal utility of item whilst not letting other players access it, is against the ethos
---
Anyone on xbox? I need help leveling up and some stimpaks would be helpful
---
Many thanks for the award!  Was not expecting that at all.  Cheers!
---
Im with you on that.i need 2mm ec big time.no one sells it and i burn through them quick.especially with the guass mini gun and shotgun.
---
Right but it's not a guaranteed heavy combat piece anymore. The SBQ itself drops a random legendary, so I'd prefer the event drop just went back to offering a guaranteed drop of some level of usefulness. Even if they rotated it. Have it be heavy combat one week, leather the next, trapper the next, etc. Whatever. Everything being a random roll is starting to get old.
---
Edit: Either that or allow us the ability to disable or "unlearn" plans. I know entirely too many garbage plans for random rolls to be useful to me.
---
Absolutely not. My build only has two weight reduction perks, but that’s so I can carry all the aid I use. All the others directly affect either my damage, my ability to avoid/mitigate damage or in the case of ~~Tenderiser~~ Suppressor, their damage.
---
Game lets you bank points. But your point will only unlock the perks available for the level when you got the point.
---
So if you banked points from lv 2 to 10, you will have 9 pts. Your lv 2 point can only unlock lv 2 perks, lv 3 pt for lv 3 perks, etc etc.
---
The Bethesda forums can be pretty cringe worthy beware. But it’s the best info for sure on what’s going on in the pts. It’s been a while since I looked so I’m not going to go spewing out numbers🤣 But I’m pretty sure that everything is still the same in regards to what builds do the most damage vs the least just the super highs are going to drop much more considerably than the more rounded builds. It’s just a change in order of operations for the damage calc. So the more buffs you use the more you’ll notice it (cough cough bloody melee). It stings a bit but I mean if I’m going to be honest it’s probably a good thing cause man I kinda miss getting my ass kicked once and a while.
---
And do as much drugs as you want.  There's an addictol that spawns at Biv's tattoo shop
---
Ah! But mini nukes could be stored in an ammo stash, since they don’t deplete. So you’d be good stocking enough to... uh... destroy the world again.  Yeah.
---
I'm not though? This is just an odd hill for you to die on. Either the limit wasn't a thing before or it didn't work properly. Bethesda's never said anything about as far as I've seen in my 6 months of playing it nor can I find anything in their new patch notes that would suggest anything's changed. If I could move in power armor when I signed out, I should be able to move in power armor when I sign in and literally nothing's changed.
---
SmallAsainChild
---
I'm in sounds fun
---
Good luck. I'm sure you've figured this out by now, but I'll mention it anyway, if you're in that area and are looking for her, check your HUD for a yellow dot, all the non-threatening NPCs show up there.
---
I can see why they haven't it would mean retconing the power armor hud
---
Max Weight +1 is just Walking Speed though that chews through your AP. There's another threshold where you're moving like the Walk of Shame regardless of AP. And then there's the "Can't carry more, can't move" Threshold.
---
A chance to have Ballistic Fiber with Scrap ? Nice ! I change it immediately :)
---
"Have you ever had sexual relations with any species considered non- human?"
---
That's curious, that was my original fix but found loading through the door was as effective and much faster.
---
Go ahead and try it, if it doesn't work they you may have a different problem. Me and my group of 6 other regular players have this on a somewhat regular basis (less so lately as word gets out about energy weapons)
---
I was in the atom shop and accidentally dropped my controller.it bought a damn monicle for 300 atoms.
---
I was so pissed.lol.
---
I've  noticed that after selecting where I want to trave to pause for a couple seconds and then confirm the fast travel seems to work.
---
So maybe it's more so not doing it so fast? Either by trying to center the cursor or by pausing, you're taking just long enough for it to load?
---
Too long of a wait...I guess I will be playing madden this weekend
---
That was from Rifle’s recent video. I haven’t got to try it since they broke the nukes.
---
At first I was gonna blast you for how stupid of an idea that is, but then I remembered what game we're talking about, and... Yeah, that wouldn't surprise me.
---
Because it was a thing that existed before you started playing.
---
It's been a mechanic for at least a year at this point, if not more.
---
There's so many factors that you could have not been paying attention to. Class Freak, Strange in Numbers, food Buffs, Chem buffs, Team Buffs, etc.
---
You're trying to argue that Water isn't Wet. This a mechanic. It's been a mechanic before you started playing, and just because you can't come to terms with the mechanic, doesn't mean it's a bug.
---
if I had to guess it's likely related to latency. a lot of the problems with this game are caused by latency. any quick action more often than not results in failure.
---
hell, even vats.
---
All I want is a box where I can put something, select which character I want to move it to, and send it off. Then on the second character I can pick it up.
---
To be fair, mounted plans don't scrip.
---
True. UNLESS, we make the wasteland a commune, share whats extra because someday we gonna die and we are not going to carry our precious .38 that drops from all enemies and containers and worth 0.001 caps, but really useful to low lvls, to the grave...
---
I have near 30K caps, already sold 1400 to vendors... What would 6 huge water purifiers do for me anymore? lol No obligation. I already have what I need. what would anyone lose if a low level suffers a little less and makes few more caps? Especially in a fantasy world lol
---
Some do whatever it takes to survive, some do whatever it takes to bring back the civilization and humanity...
---
Dude I've considered all the mechanics hahaha
---
You die hards treat this game like it's your own child, I swear hahah
---
WHO’S READY TO HAVE THEIR ASS KICKED?
---
Going rate should still be about 20 cap per scrip. So 800 cap for a 3 star. These don't take up much inventory weight either.
---
Im not sure if its Opt-in as my xbox is on an Insider build, but there is a Streaming option in the app. Which remote turns on my Xbox.
---
Basically my Phone Connects to my Xbox acting as a display/controller input then the Xbox is connecting to the internet.
---
Edit: looks like it is currently for Insiders, but hopefully this feature is part of that September 15th release for xcloud/Game Pass
---
https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-streaming/console-streaming
---
Is that with or without healing factor? I still wouldn't go back to using it given that's what caused mine but it'd be interesting to know if it's something that makes the bug more prevalent.
---
That'll be 700 atoms to lighten up thanks. Our arrangement isn't light.
---
Especially if you are trying to get our of Vats as a Sheepsquatch is chasing you but you can't move out of the way, because you are trying to exit Vats too fast
---
It reminds me of this guy that performs at this farmer’s market in Virginia that I stop at every year on my way to North Carolina for vacation. He does all these really great covers of songs but whenever he sings Johnny Cash I actually want to blood eagle him its so horrible. He doesn’t sing in the right tune and skips entire syllables so it sounds really choppy and half the time I don’t even know what song he is singing.
---
Yeah. They did fix it, it’s in the patch notes for 20 but must’ve broke it since then
---
Just wanna say good find doing some testing with perk cards and other stuff I'm guessing. Good luck with getting BGS to eye ball this bug and get it worked out.
---
If you kept yourself informed, you wouldn’t have missed it. But also you’d have learned that they are going to bring it back next week for a week.
---
yup, i'm good as far as the coc is concerned.
---
Wasn't around for that, did the game have the daily free atom missions at the time? If so why did people complain?!
---
