The Enclave science wing basically confirms that its canon. A *lot* of studies, data, facts, and other lore tidbits explaining what they are and how to artificially replicate it. They reverse engineered the mutations into serums, so we know the mutations arent exclusive to the residents.
---
I have a staircase that has been stuck at my base since before the first meat week because of this bug. Rebuilding isn't something I want to do so it's just there pissing me off.
---
Yeah I'm just highlighting public events are making possum badges a lot harder. Even the challenges because several rely on these public events like backpacker for the s'mores which you get from camp fire tales and the musician challenge as well
---
They could even be removed from the game altogether a certain amount of time (like 6 months) after being declared legacy, which should be enough to find something else. Perhaps with a one time option to re-roll the effect that makes the item legacy.
---
Lol no way. Why punish people who got a nice weapon to drop?
---
&gt; white picket fences on sale
---

---
I got those thinking they would be cool.  They are terrible to line up, they just free-float, no clipping, no direction.
---
Why punish everyone else by making overpowered gear exclusive to a few who obtained it early, and to dupers?
---
that isnt fair to the people who got them legit or people who paid 2 caps limits or more for them.. even though surely many of those people duped the fuck out of them..
---
fuck the guys who bought from ebay tho.. Ive no sympathy for them
---
I dont think they should be removed.. just made untradeable
---
There are plenty of droppable weapons that are overpowered as well so might as well take those out of the game too lol
---
My only real issues were/are robot plans (many, spawns, see wickadelychickadely) and, of course, plasma nade plans.
---
Visit secondary fissure sites, use a scoped weapon from a distance and look for dead Deathclaws - you can usually loot a hide from the corpse,  and grab some Ultrasite while you're there
---
Almost waiting a year for the spiked armor now...
---
I see a lot of atom shop items in game..
---
I would really, really like this. I've thought about that before too. It would make it so much easier to purge stuff!
---
Ooof lol
---
same.  I was like "wait, you want me to do what?  nah.  the standard backpack will be fine..."
---
316 24 hour days and 16 extra hours for 20 atoms. Makes sense.
---
Crab Bretheren? Look like Bretheren, taste like crab ?
---
Thanks to everyones responses, I just sold a couple serums for 500 a piece, going to make more, put them in my vending machines and sell 2-3 each day to vendors
---
Up north by wavy Willard’s you might find a spot
---
If you come to my camp you'll see atom shop items all over the place, but I haven't spent a cent on them.
---
It was always good. Make up your own mind.
---
But they have never shown up in the other games, so maybe they just..died out after awhile maybe?
---
Out of the 6 I've launched I got disconnected as soon as I entered the nuke zone on 3 of them. The devil's share I guess.
---
Should be at least 100 for the dedication
---
nice catch!
---
I cannot see how it can be fair to let people permanently own god tier legendaries that will never be available to anyone else. Either they need to be removed (with the owners compensated in a way that makes it not unfair), or rebalanced/nerfed and restored as regular drops that everyone can get and use.
---
I still do them to sell the recipes. And Biv gets lonely. But yea that was my reaction too when I found out.
---
Run around. Explore. What system are you on? What main quests are you doing?
---
in situations like that I use a tesla rifle
---
Why? If you already know there are posts like this, why would... why??
---
Just get off reddit and play the game for a bit. Decide for yourself.
---
I just want a cool skin for scout armor, like orange and black camo for the holiday
---
you know you can carry more than one weapon?
---
I’m on Xbox and all my quests are too high level for me
---
How do I make up my mind about a game a haven't played in almost a year?
---
The game crashed my PS4 multiple times when it first launched, which is why I'm asking if the big issues were ironed out. I also asked about the difficulty of catching up to the current player base, which is a problem many online games face.
---
The least hostile answer I got, which I appreciate
---
It's really somewhat tedious if you're trying to "catch up" with an established character. 
---
But if you recently created an alt, the various tasks are more like a self-guided tour through Appalachia, and it's all stuff you would be doing anyway.
---
IIRC, they're working on that for patch 14. For now, I use a low level 10 mm pistol for events but sometimes I don't get anything because, evidently, I didn't do enough damage. Anyway, it's kind of a crapshoot whether you are low level or high level.
---
On the other hand, the folks complaining about one shots are often the ones that take their sweet fucking time getting around to taking a shot and never repair the reactors (uranium fever) or add kindling (campfire takes), or hold off mobs at the jukebox (violent night) etc. I use a Tesla. Tags everything but doesn't one shot. But if you're taking your sweet time while I'm holding off three mole Miners, I'm going to switch to my bloodied shotgun...
---
Maybe, or you can just chalk that up to the idea never existing before. We see new stuff all the time, that didnt exist because no one thought of it before. Im sure we'll get a concrete answer with fallout 5.
---
Yeah, it's like 20-25% for me.
---
And there is no reason why they need to be the most powerful weapons in the game.
---
Make them a novelty collectors item like doubles. Quad is better than double but people still want them for collections.
---
As is it's unfair that the only high end trade item in the game is no longer available. I've got a trunk full of high end gear collected over 2,000 hours and I can't compete for bids because I didn't get a legacy weapon during the short 3 month window that they were available.
---
The mistress of mysteries!
---
Run around and explore, do the lower level events for xp, grab cranberries at Aaronholt(sp?) Farm in the Northwest and make cranberry cobbler for 5% bonus xp and rest for another 5%. Keep these active for a 10% xp boost at all times. Farm junk/guns/ammo from low level areas or pick up everything you can and go sell it to raise your caps supply for later. You'll hit level 25 before you know it.  I was doing leader of the pack every  time I saw it come up, at worst it's 9 scrip and at best it's 15 scrip or a 1* item or two you can make use of now.
---
Shit my bad! The one I know / am on is for Xbox.
---
I’m a sneaky shotgunner which I heard wasn’t common. I run all the shotgun perks and run junkies all I’ve been using my instigating pump shotgun a lot more lately. Don’t use vats and most of my shotguns have the 10% more damage while aiming effect. 
---
Kinda hope wastelanders brings back poison and bleed legendary effects, if they still stack on a shotgun that would be nice. 
---
I can share my full perk layout in the morning if you want?
---
Yeah and make deal actual damage while you're at it not the piss stream of a 80 year old man with a swollen urethra
---
The horsemen sweet
---
I wish I could get anything but uh I’m broke school
---
(I upvoted you’re comment, not sure why someone downvoted it?) 
---
I agree it has been a deal from the beginning, I don’t take workshops since I get most materials just running around so I just never took them. 
---
I’m more amazed how people don’t read the warning that pops up when you take a workshop! lol
---
Always had my handy notched pickaxe with me for such things
---
I’ll join you guys on this.  
---
Came across this post because ... I haven’t logged since the backpacks.  Totally lost now and I don’t even think I had good gear in the first place let alone now. 
---
On PC if you guys want to help each other sometime
---

This one gave me a good laugh
---
Just your average response to these kinds of questions: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning
---
Good on you. I carry similar things for that reason, or I just use trigger control when running full health.
---
Like several have suggested, just run around. Don't worry about quests. Just have fun. Explore. And make friends. Fallout is best with friends and the community is mostly great. The new event system is amazing for low levels. Everytime a public event is up just go and there will likely be others there to help you.
---
Damnit where's the enclave stufff
---
The quests are mostly crap in the middle anyway. I usually spend ages exploring the forest and the regions to the north and south. Once you're high level and well equipped, then you can check out the more dangerous areas and quests. My newest character is level 30.
---
Twin Lakes is great.
---
Well now with the legendary vendor it's basically "a matter of time" before you get some good gear. Personally I think the issue is more people min/maxing for no reason (aka killing legendaries so fast that folks can't tag em and/or loot doesn't spawn) so to me it's not worth what people are asking for top tier items to end the grind and have no reason to play.
---
Or the opposite, you place something on a second/third floor and it appears on the foundation.
---
Those 1x2 platform/star combos are the worst for this - I had such high hopes for it, but nope - basically useless.
---
I got an executioner's vats-y The Fixer from Murmurgrr. I was over the moon, perfect weapon for my sneak rifle woman. I HAD to get it to asap. My wife was on, but about to log. I get to her and of course we can't trade. Impatient I am, so instead of logging off and back on, making my wife wait, I just drop it. I JUST DROP IT. Gone. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 
---
After that it was hard to enjoy my Gaming.
---
Like I said. I want to know if the major bugs have been ironed out, I can't find out about that by playing for a bit. I also asked about the difficulty of catching up to the player base, which I also can't find out from playing early game.
---
I really like that war raider skin
---
It's worth if your primary goals are pvp, killing SBs or SBQ. Other than that, sticking with normal ammo and speedy receiver will serve you plenty.
---
They're mad because they know that if their shit gets nerfed they won't be able to win every bid for all of the new weapons.
---
Most probably have a mule with a stash box full of them.
---
Ikr, it's so obvious
---
Problem is the atom:dollar ratio...
---
Lower atom shop prices and no one will buy because challenges will get them enough atoms.
---
But if they increase the atoms you get by helping to fund and support the game... That's a bit better. A bit at least

I own a few legacies and had to trade an arm and leg to get them. But they are a problem, especially when it comes to pvp not that it’s everyone’s cup of tea. 
---
As sad as I would be to see my explosive Gatling plasma removed I think they should either remove legacies from the game or add them back to loot pool with a reasonable nerf to what they can do. 
---
Also fixing the goo piles they leave behind stopping things from spawning would also be nice 👍
---
Very sufficient response. Thank you
---
That’s actually a really good idea
---
That would be enough to make me happy. 
---
Keep your God tiered weapons, I'd just like to have a fair shot at bidding on new weapons when they drop.
---
Here's another silly restriction - Why can stairs only snap to the centre of a floor piece? In FO4 they could snap to either side and also snap to half/quarter size floors.
---
At low level you want to do the leader of the pack event. Guaranteed legendaries for low levels.
---
First thing I do is find a nice mellow sever without a bunch of asshats! Late night PST is the best! Everything goes to shit once the East Coasters wake up lol
---
Those are still equally available to everyone, it is not the same. Legacy items that can be traded would be fine in theory, if it was not for them being duped and/or sold for real money on eBay. Perhaps the developers hoped that those items would just slowly die out of the game once they no longer drop, but that is not how it turned out in reality.

Math is hard and now I have kids who need help with math homework. :(
---
I hope so. I know we see new stuff alot, and some lore breaks and idk, lore breaks really get to me sometimes because I just question it when I see it
---
Rads are best mitigated with the backpack, but only when you need it. High capacity otherwise. I've tried trapper armor and the leaded mods but they don't reduce rad dmg by any significant amount if you already have the backpack on.
---
We are all missing it, literally
---
That probably is the best compromise we can look forward to.
---
Why does it matter if the droppable weapons are extremely strong too? Legacy weapons aren’t some insurmountable advantage. I know because I have a few that barely use
---
Thanks for all the advice, I went for it tonight, did my first solo. Went round in circles for a bit, but got it done in about 40 minutes.
---
Nuked fissure prime and had an unusually difficult time, lots of sub L100 players showed and a few were considerably underpowered, so it took a while. I died 4 times, went through nearly 3000 rounds of .308, all my grenades, and a good chunk of meds, but we did it with 10 minutes to spare. I had just enough time to grab a few legendaries, check I'd got my flux  and then the server crashed :)
---
Well in defense of those level 500s one shotting everything, of they don't, they do die. They have 14 hp on average after all.
---
a cap sink for capped-level players, less so for low level players.  low level players are not rolling in caps.
---
Well mod anything you can, it doesn't have many mods.
---
Though the most important is the speedy receiver, makes shooting waaaaay faster.
---
Not sure if this still works but used to be able to spam punji boards and anybody sneaking around with get a huge wanted status if they walked over or disabled them.
---
I actually was able to have someone build it in a camp I had when it was released as part of that bundle and have been able to keep it ever since.  Always stored it whenever I moved camp locations.  I’m sure if I ever accidentally scrapped it that would be the end of my pretty little dome.
---
I don't think they should remove them, but they need to be knocked off of their pedestal before Wastelanders drops or it will be an absolute shit show where legit players are excluded from a fair opportunity to compete for bids on new gear.
---
If you look at the market for the Fixer right now 80% that are up for auction are requesting legacy weapons, 10% want a different Fixer, and the other 10% are shit rolls. So In a nutshell..... don't bother bidding unless you have a legacy weapon that was probably a dupe
---
I didn’t mean to come off as “hostile,” but you literally acknowledged there are a lot of posts like this. Almost every day.
---
Some people answer with snark, some sincerely, and usually someone points to ongoing discussions of the same type that already cover what you asked about.
---
I went with snark because you seemed aware it’s a common question and still posted anyway. Assumed you were trolling.
---
At any rate, I still stand by the idea of playing more and deciding for yourself instead of watching reddit replies. Whatever anyone says here about catching up to the player base isn’t going to help any more than actually playing.
---
That’s called slavery.
---
It would be better if you could take off the helmet and throw it as a weapon like the Headless Horseman. 🎃🖤👍
---
IMO ore is a waste of time anyways.
---
I wasted time going back for the wrong mainframe cores and looking for a blank bio-card rather than an old used one, plus i had a bit of a nosey round. Next time I'll concentrate and see if I can knock my time down from 40 to 20 mins
---
Because people with Bloodied Fixers right now are requesting trades for only legacy weapons.
---
It's an absolute shit show!!!
---
BGS has been leaving money on the table not being able to increase CAMP budgets.  I don't buy anything CAMP related in the Atom Store except for very special items (junk bot) simply because I don't have the CAMP budget to do it anymore.  CAMP items would be a steady stream of  Atom store revenue, but they can't take advantage of it because of the build limitations they have to enforce.
---
How do U get in the dev room tho
---
Oh I see what you’re saying. The downside to explosive laser rifles is that it breaks in 10 minutes. I got all mine from vendors for nothing Lolol. I guess I was just lucky.
---
Yes, that's what I meant. They should decrease the dollar cost of atoms, not the atom cost of items.
---
Ideally, they should have been nerfed in the first place, and not made legacy. Maybe the devs were afraid of the possible outrage, and thought that legacy weapons would gradually disappear over time (because of people quitting and their inventories being lost), but in practice dupers kept the supply of those items alive.
---
Not true lol. People just want rare stuff which MAY include legacies. Not everyone is asking for them and fixers are only in demand because they are new. They aren’t way better than any other strong weapon.
---
How do you think the children of atom started? These trendsetters right here. The OG Children of Atom.
---
That’s harsh. I was lucky and got a 3 star legendary Gatling gun, but it’s only effect is extra damage to super mutants, but it’s something. Right now I am playing another game so I can step back a bit and try to calm down.
---
standard commando or rifle sneaky/vats/crit would make good use of that
---
I hope something else comes along that pvpers can get into.
---
I know a good build, it involves selling this to me hahah solid find mate
---
Just wait a month or two and it will steady out. BE Gatlin Plasmas and Gatlin Lasers are the only overly used Legacy... and most people trade those for armor pieces/sets. Every game involves luck. Have you played many mmorpgs with active markets? Lol. This is nothing new.
---
Legacies are nothing insane... bloodied handmades are the real god tier weapon in game right now. Lol.
---
I lost a excavator right arm, no way I sold/dropped/scrapped it, t was just gone. I have lost multiple peices of legendary armor, but I can't be sure I didn't scrip them, though pretty sure I didn't. Usually one at time .. just weird. Dropped a 3* the fixer to trade to my alt, dissapeared😭😭
---
Thanks man
---
(sorry for formatting) for better or worse legendary items are what people will seek out and gravitate towards.  so increase the drop rate of 1 star legendary items with lower minimum level requirements.  adjust the value of 1 star items for scrip trade in to prevent hoarding by high level players of these items.  conversely allow high level players to turn in a very large amount caps directly for scrip, and/or for some kind of random chance, slot machine style, for a random piece of 3 star gear.
---
I think the problem is that the game code is too complex for them to need explosive on only one weapon. That is why they eliminated them from the drop pool.
---
The developers need to come up with something though because I'm sure a lot of long term players will bail on the game if they feel like they are being excluded from the new content. That is how it feel with the Fixer right now..... I've got 2,000+ hours in the game since BETA and I can't even compete for the newest gear.
---
Having the same issue. Have your tried re-installing your internet connection? Can't think of much else to fix it
---
I always buy the $10 bundles that give you an extra 50% of Atom value for free and an outfit. I just sit on the Atoms until something comes along that I want. It’s a much better value than the standard price. 
---
The price of each item isn’t the issue, it’s maybe that the price of Atoms is a bit high. Still, with how easy it is to get Atoms in game, it’s hard for me to really object to price.
---
I traded my whole gear setup for 1 legacy... yeah that’s a great idea. 
---
(I trade my gear setup so I can enjoy grinding for new sets. It keeps the game interesting and challenging)
---
Pervert.
---
I've been itching for pvp. Nuclear Winter is nice but it doesn't replace the traditional pvp entirely.  I tune into Hunter/Hunted a lot but nobody ever really tunes into the radio station.
---
Stealth commando+VATS. That’s the perfect weapon for it.
---
Still working on Alpha unfortunately, got a few possibilities but I think you want a guarantee lol
---
Alpha: 04490528
---
Long as you don't go round being a jerk then awesome! Hunter/hunted is really enjoyable, could be a good short term thing to PvP in instead of survival
---
I remember rushing like crazy to get that plan unlocked immediately after backpacks were released, just because I wanted it personally, and was hoping to make a few caps by selling bags with or without the high capacity mod.
---
Boy was I massively disappointed when I found out they were character bound...
---
Definitely one of the more confusing decisions they made, especially since they released player vending not too long before the backpacks.
---
See, this is why I'm asking, getting conflicting opinions again in this thread, it's as if no one really knows. 
---
I'll just have to test it for myself. 
---
Thanks though I'll try upping my rad resist, but in standard armor and mutations (no rad-x full strength) I'll have to make Radshield I think.
---
Forest&gt;Toxic Valley&gt;Ash Heap&gt;Savage Divide&gt;The Mire&gt;Cranberry bog/Watoga  
---
Sneaking is really your friend in this game too.  It might be tempting to rush in and loot a new area but if a high lvl player passed thru recently its going to spawn higher lvl enemies.  So sneak up on an area, and check out whats going on first.
---
I understand your point. I tried to stay as polite as possible to avoid people confusing me for a troll but I clearly didn't do a good job.
---
I looked for other posts but they all seem to be players who quit after playing for quite a while, I'm starting from level 10 I think so it's quite a different POV.
---
Problem with trying to catch up is when big games focus on their existing player base and the gap between new and old players just grows wider without anything to close it a bit. I had a similar problem with Warframe a while back which is why I asked. 
---
No hard feelings mate
---
Lol
---
Agreed the price of items in well tuned to the ingame atom grind. The cost of atoms in a bit out of proportion and I think that's turning off a good chunk of possible buyers.
---
Yeah let us catch mutated fish that weigh 50 lbs.
---
Thanks.
---
I’ll come back to this
---
I'd like to see people trading to finish an armor set or for a better weapon that fits their build.
---
Right now the Fixer market is  flooded with requests for nothing but legacy weapons or other Fixers. It's becoming a problem.
---
I don't know if it’s considered the best but i use 
---
Long barrel -for a bit more reach 
---
Prime receiver - ups damage but only has a chance to drop from the queen. Otherwise go with speedy receiver to raise fire rate just a bit
---
Comfort grip - better recoil
---
Extra Large magazine - better ammo capacity
---
I personally avoid  the front ring sight because i have a hard time shooting with it but maybe you’ll have better luck. 
---
I absolutely love the gattling gun especially a two shot version but it has very little mods compared to other guns. Gattling guns also seem to be rare loot. Iv only ever seen three on my level 80 heavy gunner play through. I suppose you could get the plans from watoga or white springs and farm mods that way.   
---
If your looking for an alternative try the .50 cal heavy machine gun. Theres a few that can be found on the map and ammo is pretty common in player shops. You could max the ammo doubling perk in the agility tree and max the super duper perk in luck. Those two will keep you swimming in ammo if used right. super duper also comes in handy for anything created at workbenches, chemical station  and cooking station.
---
Doesnt any armor pen perk bypass resists?
---
i had that problem long time ago. it eventually went away.
---
Oh wow, that's very comprehensive! I'll add a link to your post in the guide. Though it seems there really aren't any spots where fiber optics can be found in large quantities.
---
if i had any bloodied weapon worth trading I certainly would just for the simple fact I dont run bloodied..
---
if youre looking for profit.. i dunno.. i dont think about it in those terms
---
also.. fukka bot
---
Nope not really sadly
---
Bullshit bruh!!!!!
---
Ain't nobody trading a Bloodied Fixer right now for a pink baseball bat.
---
You're suffering from cognitive dissonance.
---
You're a lifesaver, thanks!
---
I'm kind of getting there. 
---
With Fireproof 3, Dense chest + Poison 25% resist, 1 arm 25% poison resist. My three remaining pieces unyielding. If I chug some Radshield I will try standing in the green cloud and see what happens.
---
 I run with dodgy 3, serendipity 3, lone wanderer 4, no PA so emergency protocols no relevant. Fingers crossed, should be fun.
---
https://youtu.be/vZ91LOwV3_M
---
Submitted a couple tickets (Again) just in case, in short this is either another stealth nerf which makes no sense or a set of errors that also don't make sense, but 30 second fix.
---
It's just there so Bethesda and the player can track hours played per account, though you theoretically could have gotten it a few weeks ago if you had played 24/7 since release (with a give or take for update downtime). We'll be in year 3 or 4 before madlads and lasses who put 6+ hours a day in start legitimately getting that challenge.
---
They could win some legendary goodwill among their most loyal fans who do log that many hours in Appalachia over the game's life by giving you 7600 Atoms instead of 20.
---
It's been 10 months since they removed them from the drop pool.
---
So basically 11 to 12 months is your time frame?.....just 2 more months and every thing will be fine?..... LOL
---
I’m talking about your freaking out about not being able to get a fixer...
---
You named one item🤦🏾‍♂️ you clearly can’t navigate the market lol that’s why you still haven’t gotten a legacy or a fixer 😂
---
Thank you for your work. What a great asset.
---
When trading legendary armor, sometimes it’s hard to remember what DR is light/sturdy/heavy across all the different styles and mods.
---
The best solution would be if the game actually stated it somewhere, but this is the next best thing.
---
Thanks, got fireproof 3, dense and poison on 2 armor pieces now and various perks for damage resist. Time to test.
---
That just seems like all the more reason to remove them. Don’t get me wrong I don’t want them removed. I’d rather they added them back to the loot pool and nerfed them at the same time. We can’t deny that legacy weapons haven’t been good for the game or the market. Something needs to be done and if they won’t add them back to the loot pool and nerf them , I personally think the game would be better off without them
---
Get the auto grenade launcher instead, but they break fast.
---
Nice.
---
Pretty sure I saw her like a month (maybe 2) ago on the main road going down the Mire.
---
Explosive weapons are often not really worth it, since they are nerfed for balance reasons. And with this I do not mean weapons with explosive modifier, just things like the M79 and the fatman
---
Honestly its not fun killing a level 15 over a workshop. They need the resources more than I do and they need the experience to get better and learn the game. I've even taught people how to play the game, giving them ammo and stimpaks as a reward for each thing they complete. I just love to pvp, I'm just not a straight up asshole killing low levels for fun. I only ever pvp with people who want to. I love Hunter/Hunted but I really encourage anyone to join so they can have experience with pvp and to get some more kills under their belt.

Thank you!  Does this apply to all gatlings?  My other toon has an FE one.
---
Good answers dude!
---
Bunch of level 500s? 
---
Look dude, I’ve played for over 10 months and myself am lvl 248. 
---
In all of my playing I think I’ve seen 4 players ever at 500 or above, and none of them were in the same event.
---
And I’m checking the market. Plenty of people trading those without asking for a legacy. Some people just make up stuff for outrage 😂😂😂
---
Seems like you would like the idea of needing to grind for a new replacement for your Legacy. Freshen things up a little and let someone else get a shot at bidding for the latest and greatest gear.
---
B25 gatling gun
---
Yeah you are pretty much an a hole
---
im gonna record audio for this and put it in the game when mods come out.. oooooooo
---
[The perfect icon for it has already been a meme for a while now.](https://i.imgur.com/wNVvkwK.jpg)
---
It depends are you trading the B25 away or are you trading for it.
---
If someone is stupid enough to trade you a B25 for an I25 then go for it.
---
If they would like some voice overs I libe in Tennessee. I wouldn't even have to fake the accent.
---
I've been buying legendaries on PC at around 20 caps per scrip. That works out to:
---
* 60 caps for a 1 star armor (3 scrip)
---
* 180 caps for a 2 star armor (9 scrip)
---
* 480 caps for a 3 star armor (24 scrip)
---
* 100 caps for a 1 star weapon (5 scrip)
---
* 300 caps for a 2 star weapon (15 scrip)
---
* 800 caps for a 3 star weapon (40 scrip)
---
B25 50 cal or lmg
---
Working as intended, they specifically exclude heavy weapons, will only work on "Small Arms"  
---
Don't like it, but clearly done intentionally.
---
Stop leaning on your duped legacy as a crutch and git gudder bruh.
---
So you have no comeback that your original post is a lie?😂 ok you win 👍🏽😂👍🏽
---
Ok let's say that I dont usually do queen fights. Instead I shoot a lv62 ghoul in the face. How am I gonna do? Two shots?
---
So you're deflecting away from the topic?
---
That's weak.
---
Maybe Wastelanders will add settlements and they can add an option to "donate" anything you don't want in your STASH directly to your faction, making the items available at a faction vendor for a price based on how many donations have been given relative to faction population. I'm assuming most donated items would end up being cheap scrap and low tier ammo.
---
I reread your op and I notice you mention repairing the reactor.  Don't do that.  
---
Just make a hard left as soon as you get in that room and push to the door.  Kill anything in the immediate area, pick the door, go into the next area, hack the terminal, and proceed.  
---
That will shave a ton of time off the run and reduce the amount of rads you need to mitigate.  In PA or a hazmat suit you won't even need a full radaway, at most a diluted will be more than enough if you even need to bother.  
---
An explosive weapon speeds up smashing the mainframe cores ultra quick.  1 or 2 shots per bank of computers and it will wreck the entire bank.  Any explosive weapon will do, it doesn't need to be some high end gun.    
---
Lastly, learning the various locations where mainframe cores spawn will get the time spent on repairing the mainframe down to a couple minutes.  There's only so many possible locations.
---
No I grind to sell my gear and get a legacy lol. Which is why I buy a RW one... so it looks nice on the wall lol.
---
I got a 3* Vamps grognak's axe reflects 50% dwb +1 agi from a super mutant at West Tek earlier 
---
But I do agree that there should be a much higher chance of 3* items from 3* enemies, if not 100%
---
.50 is outstanding in every way.  Just don’t drop your steel scrap, and remember to use ammosmith and superduper.
---
Flechette harpoon is also fun and wild-wasteland.
---
I’m guessing stuff will be added next Tuesday. They’ve been updating biweekly since the beginning of the year, and next week will be the perfect time to roll out decorations, costumes, etc.
---
My neighbors, the early adopter ones, are just starting to put up decorations IRL. My wife puts an orange wreath on the door and we call it done. It offsets our neighbor who creates a full graveyard in her yard and has blinking orange lights covering the house.
---
I don't need a comeback.
---
Y'all are trading duped legacy gear. Be happy Bethesda didn't ban you and put your legacy crutch on a display shelf.
---
They aren’t so bad, there’s only 2 challenges that are literally tedious, I can’t remember what one was but it it was probably the one where you had to get the stimpack diffuser or whatever &amp; the other is where you need the plasma grenade. Collector is easy but you’ll need the trade market for mags.
---
Bro this ENTIRE thread started because you can’t buy a bloodied fixer lmao. Trading is about being patient and risk taking... buy up and continue until you find the right person for what you need. You are just wanting the easy way out...
---
The game has vastly improved since launch...yet bugs persist. 
---
The online community is freakin awesome though.
---
I usually will just melee bash with my rifle to make sure if anyone one shots it I'm good it's not a great fix but I find it helps I usually just rush the boss and people assume I'm one shotting but I just tickle it with my rifle butt
---
😂so not defending yourself when you are caught in a lie is cool now? Cool. and I don’t even know how to dupe but good try tho 😂😂
---
They are all fantastic in junk mob PVE fun. 
---
They are all weak against armored foes, and in particular the SBQ has crazy explosive resistance in addition to her shit-ton pile of hit points.
---
I have a few I bomb around with, but they are only for fun - not serious targets.
---
Reducing scrip drop before the 50% stretch?
---
Would I use gunsmith to assist that?
---
No this thread started because the Wastelanders update will be introducing new weapons (like the Fixer) and it's obvious that OP legacy gear is going to continue to destroy the market.
---
No i have the bloodied shotgun. I'm not a bloodied build. I play rifles.
---
Ove only ever seen her in the mire...as posted before.
---
The challenge is currently impossible too since 7600 hours is almost 1 year and the game hasn't been out for a year and even then you would've had to keep your game running from release to this point without ever turning it off. It should be 500 atoms
---
Fucking donkeys. How can you fuck up your code this badly ffs ?
---
Still not gotten a single badge from those!
---
By the Hwy 65 road sign on the map by chance?
---
I guess I’ve been pretty lucky. Both my alt and main got one each today.
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
[indeed](https://media.giphy.com/media/1cjYPNLvodoBO/giphy.gif)
---
Happens to me too. I don't mind the free loot and stuff, so shhhhhh.
---
F in the chat boys
---
Gatling Gun is definitely more ammo efficient and a bloodied one can one/two shot most mobs. So for everyday use it’s better. However a bloodied .50 cal is better for big groups of enemies and does better against endgame bosses
---
I just destroy a wall, deposit all my junk in the STASH they'll have inside, use the benches I wanted, then destroy their decon arch. Your asshole tax is one of each flux.
---
I've gotten the backpack once, on one character, they need to release the restrictions on this item so people can sell them, or so I can move them to my alts! What's the point in having an intelligence crafter if he can't work for my other characters?
---
I can appreciate that.  Whether it’s worth it or not I still think only you can decide.  
---
My only legitimate advice is that finding a team/group you can play with that you trust and are helpful will definitely streamline progression if you’re returning at a low level. 
---
Old bugs have been fixed, new ones appear, some have just sort of remained and it could theoretically be getting better and/or worse depending on what you expect out of it.
---
There are plenty of friendly community members that make it fun and totally worth it, and probably would be more than willing to help out to keep the content from getting stale for themselves. If you can find some of them that you enjoy playing with then it’s a thumbs up. 
---
If it’s only toxic bored people you encounter, you’ll probably never get a leg up. Hold out until people start reviewing the wastelanders update and post here again for likely similar responses. 😜
---
People don't even ask politely anymore.  Fallout player base just makes demands.
---
I've played alone since day one of the beta and never had a problem, there were some pvpers early on but PvP in adventure is now limited to workshops, otherwise if you don't shoot back they do 0 damage
---
If they're just annoying being trolls block them and switch worlds, the chances of meeting them again are infinitesimal
---
You can absolutely enjoy this game without grouping up, the only thing I've had trouble doing solo is the vault raids, but people have solod them, and my biggest issue was hurting myself with my explosive handmade, I'm looking for an anti armour handmade to try again
---
Things like the Scorchbeast queen (endgame boss) people will show up, but you don't actually need to interact with them directly, just pretend they're a group of NPCs you're helping
---
If you're really unsure about buying it, you can sometimes find copies really cheap on eBay
---
i would be happy with an increase of 2* drops.. lol
---
Whoa, some rebuttal you had there. You must be a regular wordsmith in conversation. Clearly I have met my match, I bid you good day
---
I got mine for 10k. Only difference is bloodied not anti armor. I think you got the better one but still a very rare one. Superb find!
---
So you've not met Biv or not started this quest line or?
---
You’ve always been able to play it alone, there have always been quests, side quests and tons of lore and exploration. For that part of the game, it’s honestly better solo. If you like the exploration and lore of the prior games, this one doubles down on that stuff. 
---
In my opinion at least, multiplayer is the wrong word for 76. It’s a “Shared world”. You choose how much or how little you want to engage with others. Griefing is rare, though it can happen. PvP isn’t something you need to engage in in the main game and there’s no requirement to team up with others, though eventually you will probably make some friends. 
---
As for the quests, 99% of the game can be done solo. The final boss battle is a group effort, but it’s a public event, broadcast to the entire map, so people will almost always show up. There are a few other repeatable events that are geared toward groups as well, but they work similarly.
---
Same here tbh lmao I definitely agree
---
Maybe 3 or 4. Depends on your perk set up. I'd say 2 is average, and if the enemy got more damage resistance then it will take more shots to kill. It also depends on the modifiers of your weapon, assuming it is legendary
---
The environmental story telling is one of the best parts of the fo series for me. Nice catch.
---
This would be for fun. Which enemies are "armored" targets??
---
Sweet thanks. I'll give that a go
---
There's also a Breaking Bad reference where you can see a skeleton burying a bunch of plastic barrels in the dirt. There's pre-war money there too I think.
---
Agreed. I enjoy finding creative things in the environment outside of the marked areas on the map.
---
I know that one of the low chance ones is Possum - Chemist badge. You need to get the plan for plasma grenades which is apparently super rare. That is literally the only thing I need to do to finish all the badges. 
---
The other one I struggled with was the Possum - Collector badge, where you had to obtain all the Unstopables magazines. With the addition of vendors, this has been made easier, but it is still rather difficult to track them all down.
---
It is great 👍🏻
---
I quit doing them immediately after unlocking the first backpack...so boring and grindy.
---
Fury is definitely my go to, but I run out from time to time and had been using the buff. as suggested by /u/Pacoboyd I'll try psychotats when I'm out of fury.
---
"Shared world" is a perfect description.
---
This is spot on in my experience. A lot of really good stuff is trade only, but you can still pick them up for caps on occasion. Everybody is so focused on the meta god roll weapons. Try the same roll with something weird like a baton or golf club for way cheaper.
---
It's been a bit tbh, but i remember there was a break in the road just before i saw her (heading south)
---
That would be awesome, i would think to make it more worth-while is that you could have a chance of angering a legendary mirelurk ( queen/hunter/king) or something
---
A long time ago, when I first got that quest, it would never complete.  Now it just pops up daily, and gives me a couple hundred xp for completing.  When it updated today, it said something about a 'Core' quest.  Just odd.
---
It's definitely not poison...think I'm wrong about the fireproof perk though.  I'm going to test it out once again - it may be/probably is useful for the SBQ.  I probably saw what I wanted to see when I removed that perk.
---
Solo player here!
---
There are builds that allow you to kill nearly everything (minus SBQ and Imposter). There are now vendors that make having a shared world enjoyable. People generally leave you alone or help you with quests. The community is generally lovely!
---
Some just dont want the pa if youre not heavy guns why go for if?
---
Never trade without caps as collateral, it just isn't safe!
---
Also buying up all the serum recipes really cuts into your caps  ow that you can't farm for them anymore...
---
I have never seen campfire tales. No idea what it ia or where.
---
I did cop a squatter last week (on purpose) and now ever since then, every time I log in, it says I have it as a daily. Same with the Grafton mayor bullshit. I think daily quests are bugged right now
---
I’ve been there. Most of the challenges were bugged back when I did them. Got me even more frustrated. Also for some reason my plan duplicated itself when I completed the challenge. Sold it for 25k caps.
---
Ummm.. 15K seems WAY overpriced for a fixer with mediocre legendaries attached to it.  I mean you're just really getting better anti-armor and a modest CATS improvement  on it which is nice to be sure but not nearly 15K nice.  Frankly I wouldn't have paid over 2K for it myself.
---
Really if you don't shoot back they do zero damage ? That's cool, I've read there is a pacifist mode, where you can't damage others and they have reduced damage against you. But thought they could still kill you if they are strong and persistent enough, with good weapons, etc.
---
Thanks for the post man, really helpful. Based on that I'll buy the game and try it out.
---
I tried making a ghoul but the blemishes and skin damage available wasn't convincing enough. I think the same would hold true for a Freddy Krueger. (Lol predictive text suggested Krueger automatically)
---
Great work. Dare I ask about maybe in a future version adding weight? It's probably unimportant for PvP and min-maxxing etc. but for exploration it would be quite useful to know.
---
Duuude! I'm on this weird mission now . I've been going town to town, walking everywhere I go looking for these!
---
I miss it as well...not that I ever played it, but when it was around I wasn't constantly being attacked by bored people in Adventure mode.
---
Any gun can just about one or two shot kill you, if the person has the perks for the gun.  Takes me two - three shots when I get my M79 nade launcher. I've been two pieced by a dude w a crossbow.
---
Ever play destiny?
---
Two words "stablilty issues".
---
The community is outstanding and it's pretty difficult to grief other players unless you are taking workshops and stuff that is PvP-oriented.  I actually can't remember the last time someone "bothered" me that wasn't related to me messing with their workshop.  The world is large enough and the server pops are small enough that you might not even run into other people on every play session.  When you do, it can be a passing thing to just wave as you move on or you can stop and help with an event or whatever.  There are definitely still some bugs, but it's so much better than at launch.   The story is a little weak, but exploring the world is outstanding.  My opinion is probably unpopular, but I think it's the best looking fallout world to just explore that I've played in (I did not play 1 or 2).
---
I play on Xbox and it's going for $40 there and I'd say it's worth it.  You'll get many dozens of really good hours out of it.  I'd bet you can find it cheaper on sale somewhere for PC.
---
I'm not sure the endgame is where it needs to be yet and it's definitely not a perfect game, but if you're just aching for more FO4, this is definitely what you're looking for.
---
The nice thing about the Diffuser one is you just have to use them not craft them. So bought some from a player vendor and got that one sorted. Plasma Grenade Plans is a different story.
---
Yes!  Exactly. Love it. Kudos. Agreed.
---
I bought my s'mores recipe. Either off Grahm or the bot that sells recipes in whitesprings. Can't remember which now. So it's not exclusive to campfire tales.
---
Thanks for the helpful post. Very informative.
---
Gemini Gaming did a  video about this. She nearly went mad... and never found a red one.
---
https://youtu.be/_4AXZI2eevY
---
At the moment, I'm talking non-legendary. 4 shots seems kinda lame for a ghoul. Granted I could take out groups with 4 shots. Also I'm using all associated explosive perks. Also Stabalized and One Gun Army.
---
I'd unleash unnecessary anger, but I just got done with Guided Meditation.
---
This coming from a level 60 something. If anything you should hate the missile launcher more cause that can actually one shot.
---
The badges are listed under Challenges. If they were listed under Knock It Out In A Few Minutes you would have a point. 
---
Honestly, other than the RNG elements of some of the challenges like having all the grenade plans there isn’t much that is all that difficult. They are time consuming which is the point. Otherwise this would be a thread about how getting badges was way too easy and Bethesda really needs to come up with something to challenge their players...
---
L185. I only play alone. I have pretty much run out of things to do. While waiting for the Wastelanders DLC I'm just polishing my armor I guess.
---
I see it as just a resource dump
---
Cop a Squatter spawns the enemies you have to kill when it appears in your log. If someone or something else kills them, you get credit for it. If your CAMP is far enough away from the spawned enemies and there's no one nearby, it'll suicide the enemies to clear the cell to prepare the spawns for the next player who approaches if you fast travel to your CAMP and you'll still get credit (you may have stumbled across mobs of enemies spontaneously dying; this is the cell clear suicide glitching).
---
While getting credit for someone or something else taking care of it is nice, Cop a Squatter does have the annoying bug of completely disappearing from your log unlike other dailies if you log off or the server crashes before you complete it.
---
Side note, when I got it today, the spawns were at the Brotherhood forward station near Fissure Site Prime. Someone launched a nuke at it seconds after I logged in and I thought "Oh sweet, free daily." I was very nervous about finding out what the single enemy that survived a nuclear blast was, but apparently it was just a bloatfly that got lucky.
---
It wasn't wrong in the code. It was wrong in the article. Try reading the BethesdaReplied before posting.
---
Ah okay, I did notice it wanted me to do a daily again after previously doing one but wasn't sure if that was a bug lol
---
Dude your amazing. Thank you
---
The reduced damage thing is out of date. They changed it a few months back. Now it’s zero. Supposedly there are a few ways to exploit it but really, it’s just not an issue. I’m pretty sure 95% of the player base is allergic to PvP. You’re far more likely to have a random show up and give you a bag of stuff than have anyone try to fight you.
---
Yeah pacifist mode is just so you can't accidentally start PvP by hitting someone else while fighting one of those dodgy bastard mole rats for example :P
---
"Just play the raid for 15 days" probably didn't come out sounding the way you intended it to
---
Gunsmith doesn't help much, auto gl is best for when you know you're gonna be fighting something big but it's horrible for "regular" combat
---
I'm just getting back into the game after a long hiatus.  I'd love to have a crew to hang with.  Rock the Grim is my GT.  Will hit you up when I get home tonight.
---
If I see one fucking christmas thing before thanksgiving, everyone dies.
---
I'll keep the auto as a secondary for event bosses and SB. This is a good tip. Thank you.
---
Haha I've played since launch. 4 characters and 550+ Hrs. Doubt 99% of us will ever see that 7600 hour mark lol
---
I'm so looking forward to the next few months of holidays where every fucking week this month we'll have people complaining about when they'll finally add Halloween stuff, then on Nov 1st switching over to complaining about what's taking the Thanksgiving cosmetics so long and then switching to complaining about the lack of new Christmas stuff on Nov 29th and on through all December.
---
Haha ok, thanks for the heads up. Now it sounds really good, I can't wait to explore fo76.
---
Valseek as contracted the whoopies.
---
When it kills me I lose health and my rads don’t get worse from all the versions it gives. Maybe it’s energy and that’s why everyone is confused on what it is.
---
F
---
There is a toy Nuka-Cola truck in the game as a junk item. They should just use that cause it already looks pretty cool.
---
Jesus i need some of your luck, been server hoping for days looking for any decent automatic weapon with reduced vats cost and cant find one, meanwhile you get this masterpiece.  Congrats.
---
[removed]
---
So sorry mate =(
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Game is decent, with a lot of bugs and issues. 
---
But it is MUCH better with friends.
---
Bad mechanic
---
Having all grenade plans are pretty damn difficult when plasma grenades and mines have a .5% to drop from one specific event.
---
seems more like the normal RNG than a conspiracy theory to me...
---
Grindy? Force sensitive/Jedi grind in SWG, now that's grindy... This is tedious to be sure tho...
---
Nah. I like how the Children of Atom are as it is.
---
I'm sticking with Disciples of the Glow.
---
Yeah, the ‘item limited to x days!’ is a valid micro-transaction strategy (albeit an unpalatable one), but it’s obviously only a matter of time until things grind to an awkward halt unless you have a steady stream of *new* items going in as well. People used to rightfully complain that it felt like the atom store was getting too much attention over the main game, but now even that is being neglected. I’m sure some will say that they’re just ‘making room’ for the Halloween and Wastelanders items, but I’ve never, at any point, felt like the atom store had too many options. Let alone to the extent that they were making it difficult to navigate. 
---
Having this feeling of scarcity, when they’re just about to release the biggest bit of content for the game so far, is pretty disconcerting.
---
This dudes a power armor player disregard anything he says 🤣
---
I always turn off my vending machines before claiming a workshop or contesting one, helps me avoid this
---
Heck just give us the "blueprints" to the pets once we tamed them once ... Problem solved
---
it's a low level quest in the forest, on the smallest landmass right in the middle. the one with the Nuka-Cola factory at the bottom.
---
You could probably get a lot of caps for it by vending it or do a custom trade for something better on the Market subreddit.
---
they are great for taking out jumpers.. aim where they will land..
---
That’s the new dupe bug
---
You’ll be wanting to off-load those mine yesterday mate
---
I found a brown bag the other day with about 300 cryo mines in it the other day, and well...I now have 600 caps.
---
Todd Howard is watching you...
---
Sounds good. I bought it from a vendor for 25 caps. Max level
---
Smart! Never thought of that
---
They're also never bugged
---
That looks cool I want to try it. I think there’s an anti armor perk card in intelligence for heavy guns that should be good. I plan to make a build like this I might use yours as a starting point 😬
---
Jumpers are also horrible at aiming any gun aside from grenade launchers........easy to take them out with literally any gun if they themselves don’t have grenade launchers......................triggered?
---
Too bad hindsight can't reverse the situation. Will have to do this in the future.
---
Well that's a pity, thought maybe it was just a bored high level =/
---
NO! WTF you think this is communism?
---
Bloody mess would also help. Its a luck perk. Gives you 30% more damage
---
How can you say there isn't proof when a player recorded it and Beth reset his and his wives characters back so they get their gear back? Jw
---
thanks I'll take a look for it
---
I heard the curator at Prickett's Fort excavated a civil war soldier's remains. You could always give the body a burial in Philippi Battlefield Cemetery.
---
If he could get out of his chair without glitching into the floor or a nearby wall I'd be concerned
---
Thnx
---
Awww broke fish is mad he's not a whale.
---
Go do some challenges or work more so you can afford to buy the stuff you want.
---
The store is priced to vendor cosmetic crap to whales who will spend bank on useless crap cause they can afford it.
---
I would like fancy cars to be cheaper but that's not how life works and I would be a fool to ask or demand that of the companies that make them.
---
Idk, video games suck now that you have to spend hundreds if dollars just to get all the content.
---
I am selling at least one, maybe three, recipes for s'mores in my camp for 25 or 35 caps.  If you're on PC, find my camp.
---
Hence why it's the most trusted
---
This is my first attempt at making a Heavy Gun build lol I was brain storming befor I start flipping my skill points all around. Right now I am a stealth Sniper build so I have a lot to work on.
---
Just give me a fishing pole I can beat the Mirelurk Queen with
---
For Tadpole badges, though.
---
I have had that quest on/off from launch. Done it 10+ times. Sometimes is goes away for days/weeks and then re-appears.
---
Could be smart to drop suppressor and gunsmith and put points into luck of the draw and power armor abilities. 
---
(I’m not sure if the proc on LotD would outweigh the gunsmith passive. Just know you shoot a lot of bullets lol)
---
You'd be better off asking in the other 76 reddit. The market one
---
It’s a bad mechanic that’s being exploited. Aside from a handful of griefers and sadists, nobody likes CAMP destruction. They should just get rid of it entirely. It would be much simpler for everyone.
---
My first reaction on seeing an amazing camp these days is ‘wow, I hope they’re okay.’ As I imagine the person who built it is now rocking back and forth in the foetal position, sobbing quietly, while whispering: ‘Object floating. Structure inaccessible. Cannot place. Cannot place.’
---
If you run in groups and have mutations get stranger in numbers for sure. A good chunk of the heavy weapons cards are in intelligence and strength I believe.
---
Yeah I saw a vanguard's, disease resist, cavaliers leg the other day in the machine. Bought that right away )
---
Just possum. You gotta do the three easy tadpole ones. Athlete, Archer, and swimmer.
---
Just one quick question. Lore?
---
My thoughts exactly. Anti-armor is mediocre at best. And other effects aren't really that good either.. I'd pay 3-4k max for this. And just for testing purposes.
---
People keep stealing my crops, so I keep my CAMP fully enclosed. Sorry if you wanted to use my work bench but Harper's Ferry isn't too far away.
---
Server hop the power station NW of watoga.  There is a deathclaw fighting ants in there.  Now that they actually put hides on deathclaws it's not rare.
---
I had a couple of their hides in my vendor for a month for 40 caps, nobody would bite.
---
They have admitted they test on a private server and will start testing on a public server. I bet this game runs just fine when they're the only ones playing it.
---
Just RNG mate. I've gotten several today including a nice gold roll unyielding before I logged for the night.
---
aye.. if you have pacifist enabled.. your camp should be safe even if you get workshop'd
---
Very mediocre legendary effects on a a nice gun. You paid waaaaaayyy too much for this. But i guess its kinda useable because its the Fixer.
---
AA/SS/+1 str fishing pole would instantly de throne the shovel. Imagine you get your ass wopped at a node with a fishing pole! That shit would make the local news!
---
Are you sure?  (Sorry for the delay)  
---
There is a line in the main script making them 1\*'s, unless I'm reading it incorrectly..
---
Bethesda gangsta till the pet bugs start making Wastelanders NPCs spawn dead at your CAMP.
---
Sorry for the delay, got flooded by messages, will add that!
---
Sorry for the delayed response (got flooded by 400 messages)  
---
Reported and hope we get an answer soon.
---
I’d pay $ to increase my camp and stash budgets like I pay apple to up my iCloud space. Most people seem to want more of one or both of those things and I’m sure that could make more then it would cost to upgrade the servers.
---
Thank you
---
That’s very similar average pricing to what I see on Xbox overall from vendor hoping
---
No sign of Halloween...when a lot of games are already doing their Halloween events. Huh.
---
Read up a bit on Junkie's. With about an initial 1-2 hour investment to set up (and NO ongoing addiction maintenance) I have a base damage increase of 50% with Junkie's weapons. Faster fire rate adds another 25% to my DPS (if you are lucky enough to find a JFFR heavy weapon). Add on the 60% you get from 9 points in Heavy Gunner and not much stands in your way. And this is all at full health. I run full Bolstering Sentinel armor along with quite a few defensive perks so I very rarely die.
---
With my Junkie's LMG, I can take out level 100 Alpha Legendary enemies in a matter of seconds, sometimes before they can even do their heal phase.
---
Yeah, Bethesda are simply idiots when it comes to cash shop pricing. I barely touch the cash shop, and if it ever gets to the point where it’s necessary for competitive gameplay, I’ll be quitting.
---
yes.. you seem to be.. I agree
---
Some can say any gun is over powered. 1 fat man. 2 gernade launchers. 3 Dragon/black powder guns. 4 TSE. But yet there all there so. STOP CRYING!!!
---
I have finished all but two badges. Wasn't even tedious or hard. I used all my 37 years of gaming to get it done. Clearly those 2 extra years were key.
---
Here come all the triggered grenade launcher users! Lmao at least crossbows, sniper rifles, etc. take skill to aim. And any automatic weapon, even with all the right perks (which I have equipped) does not “one or two shot” so don’t give me that. I’m a level 59 myself so I’m no newbie. Grenade launchers with ridiculous splash damage take no skill to use. Same with the Tesla rifle before they nerfed it. They’re absolute meme weapons.
---
Or trying to get Goulbane....fuck that weekend. And it was for my friend's character.  We farmed that bullshit in shifts.
---
Haha that guy is raging so hard right now. He decided to just now spam all my posts with my comment reply. He’s just been stewing for a full week 😂
---
I'll take your useless caps.  There are still plans I dont know in vendors.
---
What's frustrating is when the steps don't trigger as being finished. One of them for me is powering up a power plant...just won't do it no matter how many times I power them up. It's really damn annoying. So I can't complete that badge :/
---
They most definitely were duped
---
This is what I aim for 20 a scrip. Sometimes 25 if I just need to sink some caps anyway.
---
\-That is a classic, will document!    
---
\-Do you remember what other chems were on the list?     
---
Trying to run this one down, but the Atom's quests I think are stored server side.  
---
\-Wondering if this isn't related to it being linked to the Stimpack Default Object manager for the healing quick menu...
---
Local hero right here folks!
---
Would that apply to using vintage Nukashine?
---
It is a counter to keep track of how much you have played, not a goal to complete.
---
Shotgun builds are rare (probably even more so on console because they cost a lot of AP for VATS and only have one useful Agility perk, even if it is the best weapon crippling perk), Bloodied has limited usefulness compared to rifles, pistols and melee weapons because each individual pellet from the shots has reduced overall damage, so you have to be fairly close to maximize the damage you get from it and FFR is barely discernible on combat shotguns because they already fire more or less as fast as you can pull the trigger with the hair trigger mod, but you should be able to flip it for a lot more caps or get a decent 3* from someone who *is* running a shotgun build.
---
The only combat shotguns worth holding onto are Vampire's if you aren't running shotgun or melee (and need the above mentioned perk to cripple Scorchbeast wings quickly to force them to land). The healing procs for every pellet that hits, so each shot at close range is basically a stimpack. Only full auto Vampire's weapons can match Vampire's combat shotguns for weapon healing speed and amount and they require a lot more ammo for the same amount of healing.
---
more and more people are being a\*\*holes and doing stuff like this. Had a very similar situation happen on ps4 about 2 days ago. was helping some people get crystals for camera film by using a workshop that had a crystal ore spot. while doing this we got attacked by a guy that seemed alone. We took him out easily enough and didnt think anything of it. not even 1 minute later one of my friends that was at my camp grabbing some water is freaking out in the chat we had going cause apparently some guys just popped up and started shooting the place up with mini nukes. he didnt hit anyone and he had pacifist mode on. a few minutes later we get a message from the guy that attacked the workshop saying if you want the attacks to stop then you must drop your weapons and give all your caps to me and we will know if you are hiding weapons or caps. needless to say we reported em all and hopped servers a couple times to continue our business. so needless to say you arent the only ones having issues with people and workshops.
---
I HATE that electrician is bugged!
---
lol!
---
I’m talking about battle royale buddy. No legendary weapons, no fat man, no powder rifles. Try again!
---
Triggered cause I made a statement? Homie I use shotgun and explosive build in NW, don't use frog legs what's so ever.
---
 Sorry for the delayed response (got flooded by 400 messages)    
---
\-Will peak to see if it's texture related, if it is, doubt they will fix it.  
---
\-That is one I've seen before, I think the only way to fix it would be to break the Fuel tank into a separate ArmorAddon (doable) but not sure Bethesda would, I'll submit it!
---
Oh can you show me your junkie build &gt;.&gt; I might just build a junkie build xD
---
I want to take workshops but I don't want to engage in pvp. Fallout has always been one of my favorite PVE games. Now when I try to play I find a lot of the time I just get frustrated and turn it off.
---
Luck of the draw procs on trigger pull... Heavys benifet from this the least of any class in the game.
---
I ran out of end game content months ago so I did all the tadpole and possum badges for S&amp;G minus the plasma grenades. I'm doing the badges for my alt character atm and got most of them done in 2 days.
---
If you use heavy weapons with power armor, the use stabilisera perk. One Gun army is Good too.
---
Did they fix dolly sods to actually give out badges now?
---
I do too. I ran by a group of try hards who repeatedly shot at me and egged me on to fight them. I want away briefly, turned off Pacifist, came back and killed two of them before they got me. Good times.
---
So am I a dummy for hot buying his 150 dollar bffr revolver?
---
Maybe make it so atom shop items don’t apply to budget. With a limit or something. Like the first two or whatever don’t, depending on the item. With a lamp you might want four or five but maybe like a billboard you get two of each before they count. Just an idea.
---
Ye that’s why I said idk the proc lol thanks
---
No , they got that weird message. “X person has left the vault and their items have been returned”
---
Even without frog legs explosives are op lmao. You’re just mad because you know it’s true and you’re trash at aiming
---
Haven’t played since it’s removal. Just too boring. And I’m so use to the damage differences in survival, that I don’t really find PvP in adventure fun
---
its extra frustrating because it's been bugged for well over a month, and bethesda has acknowledged this..
---
 
---
**Issue: Engineer's Uniforms Fuel Tank clips through backpacks**
---
Clothes\_BoS\_Engineer\_Scribe "Engineer's Uniform" \[ARMO:000DEDE7\]
---
Visible clipping, community is decided how "bad" this bug is.
---
Fix:
---
Split the Fuel Tank into a separate Nif and ArmorAddon, sharing the same slot Rendering as the Backpacks
---
In theory would be roughly an hours work to edit and test.
---
725c.  Thats what 25 per scrip costs if you on an average. 
---
Starts out great but ends like a excavator at a workshop.
---
I've been a solo player since Beta and literally zero problems as a solo player. Everything story and side quest you can do by yourself along with virtually all of the events and while there are some things that really need multiple players (certain events like the Scorchbeast Queen fight and the Encryptid fight leap to mind) they go out to server-wide alert and generally speaking lots of folks show up most of the time.
---
There is ONE thing I CAN'T do tho: Vault 94. It's an instanced Vault raid that involves endless waves of enemies and multiple simultaneous objectives that need to be completed in a time sensitive fashion and while it is technically possible to do solo on the easier levels I still have a 0% success and -0- willingness to try again.
---
Nerd Rage and Radicool are pointless if you aren't planning on soaking yourself with radiation to activate low health bonuses for a Bloodied build.
---
Yeah
---
I’ve been getting them pretty regularly
---
I do agree QOL would be better if there were more places to spend your Caps to add more value. There is an inflation issue where I completely agree with you. However I disagree with your views on how this will/should impact the market place.
---
*“A seller shall always have the right to set a desired price or not sell.”*
---
   
---
The reason you make trade exclusive posts is because any of the following reasons:  
---
1. You want to trade high value items worth so many caps it would take multiple accounts to transfer. From a convenience perspective this can save a lot of time, uses less trust and can be easier to work with a middleman.
---
2. You are looking for a specific rare item, and to filter responses/leverage the crowd to offer what you want, offer a high demand exclusively for what you want.   
---
3. You simply have a good Gun and want to switch it for another good Gun, you want simple business, not playing the buy sell game.
---
It can be annoying when you see something you’re looking for and don’t have the means to buy it.. However it is a free market. The rarer something you’re looking for is, the more power the seller will have. That is basic economics.
---
Gun smith by 500 miles in this case.
---
Wanna know, how we know, you disn't read the OP?
---
Just lost 10,000 pounds of 9 months of accumulated junk due to a weight bug, will be pushing this issue! (Less than 1,000 pounds with perks)
---
I've played alone 98% of the time, and I've never had much of an issue with anything.
---
Yeah well what the heck do we expect with Bugthesda.
---
I use the grenade launcher for range and shotgun up close. I'll blast you once w a double barrel and you'll died lol. Doesn't matter what gun I use, if I goto automatic build I can one-shot people doesn't matter.
---
This is Grafton Mayor
---
Good information, thanks!
---
Little bit, yeah. A VATS pistoleer can take a Scorchbeast down in a few shots with those, they're worth a lot more than 150 caps.
---
Well, that's something I guess. Thanks!
---
I did the kill scorched with a \_\_\_\_\_\_ atom challenges at poseidon and kept hoping at least one would finish of the badge. Nope.
---
Yes most certainly. As when items are dropped they clearly drop outside of a bag. Congrats Sherlock. You solved the case
---
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuc
---
Fallout 76 taught me to ignore reviews and just play games. I'm ashamed to admit I passed on this when it came out due to the negative press. I was lucky to get a copy for free from
---
A friend purchasing an Xbox that included the game. The reputation was bad enough that he just gave it to me. This started a renewed love of the franchise and an incredible gaming experience for me , and IMO how all future Fallout titles should be.
---
I play alone almost exclusively (my son and brother occasionally). Only time I deal with others is when I travel to their camp or it’s a group event like the queen.
---
Done by a player who probably didn’t like something in your vending machines.   Well know trick using MAX weight.
---
Vault raid is boring and the armor pieces look goofy af plus nothing of value is resell-able from the raid.
---
I’m fine with shotguns, you actually have to find a way to get close to me before you don’t aim while doing damage lmao
---
The problem is that this game is designed for you to grind out those weapons, plans and items. Once you have all the ones you want, nothing to do. 
---
I have 4 vendor stations up and running, which I have selling things very cheap and still manage to hit the limit constantly.
---
This forces me to do 2 things: 
---
1. Sell my stuff even cheaper, undercutting other vendors around. 
---
2. I'm forced to go seek out expensive or rare plans and items etc.
---
Having the cap limit as well as allowing me to have 4 vendors seems be at odds. The reason for the cap limit is maybe so you can't create new characters and just buy all the best stuff and go around griefing (like GTA Online lol) but it's counter productive and actually FORCING me to go buy stuff instead of grind and play and quest for it.
---
Yeah, honestly that’s when I lost interest in the game. I kept with the updates and such before that. When I saw the list of ridiculously tedious badge missions (and you have to earn MULTIPLE badges) I decided to play other games and never really got back into the game.
---
The amount of people in this thread who are taking the challenge so seriously and aren’t realizing this is meant to be used as a tracker of in-game playtime is really surprising. I thought it was pretty apparent from the low payout that it wasn’t supposed to actually be achieved.
---
Stealthboys allow me to sneak up
---
I’m expecting a bunch of posts coming in the future asking why players can’t login... and why did I get banned?...lol
---
So... why? What does that benefit me or the other player?
---
There was a group on PS4 earlier tonight doing this, main one was a Mizz\_Raider\_2U (or something similar), a 200+ level a-hole. They were trying to get me to PVP and I refused, next thing I knew they had grabbed my workshop. Just bored kids wishing Survival mode was still around.
---
Yeah that’d be cool if stealth boys didn’t stay active after your first shot in battle royale
---
PC social menu is a piece of shit rn
---
Just to mess with you.  It is kinda fun to do too.
---
*Im not too sure they play the game before adding anything*
---
Another meme-tool
---
So, someone did that one time, I left, they came back and did it again?
---
I got the backpack plans on one character and I’m never unlocking them again
---
I’ve done all of them that are possible. Unfortunately for 99.9% of Xbox players the chemist badge is impossible because the plasma grenade plan is so rare it may as well not exist. I wish you were on Xbox I could help you with the other badges!
---
Turn pacifism on and avoid workshops and other people can't even attack you.
---
It's always been playable solo and people actually complained because their first "high-level group content" (The Burrows) turned out to be clearable solo in ten minutes. When they finally did release raid-tier content that requires a group and preparation, everyone hated it because the rewards suck for what you have to sink in ammo and healing items and bugs and crashes ruin your progress.
---
I still haven’t gotten the damn backpack
---
Grenade launchers are bad enough, auto-grenade launchers should be removed.
---
Assuming there’s an influx of new players come wastlanders the mid tier market should revitalize and if the update “fixes” the game and offers a truly fulfilling experience I’m hopeful it’ll last longer than just a couple generations-I noticed an upturn for that market after free week so that’s where I’m basing my assumption on
---
How it runs is irrelevant here
---
Someone had to.  https://youtu.be/JdQy_y_IYgA
---
It is people duping. It’s been the all over this reddit. Only doable with droppable or throwable items.
---
This should be a perk card that effects tools:  
---
1. Pitchfork doubles crops.  
---
2. Pick axe doubles ores.  
---
3. Chainsaw doubles wood.  
---
Also FYI, unless I misunderstood you, the excavator suit does not give 4x ores.
---
The description is “provides x2 ore with both arms equipped.”      
---
Not each arm equipped.
---
Completely agree. Even if they don’t nerf the regular grenade launcher, fine. At least take the auto out
---

Wow. He actually gave you the right answer and you raging at him?  
---
This is what it looks like when exploiters dupe throwables. Hopefully it's patched soon.
---
I agree
---
Same thing JUST happed to me as I logged on came here looking for answers....filled my whole [kitchen](https://imgur.com/gallery/IGpHh4p)  in my camp with 1000+ nuke mines 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Is it really that funny? It's a god awful eyesore.
---
Already got it. Thanks though. Does the perk that shows arch of explosives and extend range work with the grenade launcher?
---
In a nuked zone it should be at least an 80% chance to get a 3 star weapon or armor from a 3 star enemy cause they are all over level 50 and it is end game. If you're just out an about and run into a 3 star it could be lower. But I haven't got a single 3 star drop in about a week now. Hell the imposter should be a guarantee 3 star too. Far more difficult that the queen
---
or even rotate which horde we get. ghouls are played tf out
---
Sounds good. Always ready for a new scavenger hunt
---
Have you nuked prime back to back to back yet?
---
&gt;There's no such thing as the Vault Raid "Bug" that completely wipes your character.... No solid proof &amp; a screenshot isn't proof..
---
Bethesda has a [pinned post](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/364694/regarding-lost-items-in-vault-94?language%5B%5D=en) on their official forums which acknowledged the issue, and promised to restore items for affected characters. The post also states the issue should be fixed as of Patch 13.
---
Yes and no. I tried to take out a level 100 Alpha Sheepsquatch with Vintage Nukashine (using unarmed) and it's challenging to get all the factors just right. However, using Heavy Weapons  you would not get a damage boost with Vintage Nukashine. However, there are other damage boosting consumables that can increase your ballistic and/or overall damage.
---
as a pvp player that is inclined to pull this type of crap.... i agree with you.
---
It was a major grind for me to get the backpack BUT! it made me such a better player and I was able to experience so much more in the world. I look forward to continuing the grind to get the mods for the backpack. :)

---
It's actually your new companion! Enjoy!
---
And ur just mad u got blown up lol
---
Yeah, with a 3 str I carry 2...
---
Bethesda is aware. They don't give a fuck and never will.
---
Yes, that's true. However, generally I only use PA in nuke zones and I find that I am more effective at DPS  on the SBQ if I stay in caution, in a hazmat suit, and use unarmed melee on her chin and do ~1,000+ per hit. Using my Bloodied Explosive 50 Cal is fun and all but I go through too many bullets and much of time I bug out and it stops registering damage on the queen.
---
While i do agree that a better cap sink is needed, I think the main problem is just how damn easy that caps are to get. This makes prices inflate of some items to be over 100k sometimes. Cutting all cap supply by 90% would be a simpler way to fix this problem
---
Yup! Exactly. Because blowing someone up doesn’t take any skill
---
With 800lbs stash, no one is going to keep a lower level 20lbs gun to sell.
---
I have it every day, but that's because I can't figure out how to DO it.
---
How do you get the wendigo to put on the clown costume?
---
To me it seemed more like a way to prolong the DLC. At the time there was a bit of an issue with every new DLC update being completed in basically 1 day or so (even without just grinding). I think they made the badges intentional difficult to counteract that.
---
The silos are where I get mine.
---
Lol!
---
No
---
I normally find a few in the Charleston Herald building. Not really secret, but it's somewhere to look.
---
https://instantostrich.com/
---
"Nothing is selected" gets my vote for the most infuriating message.  I don't even know what it means.
---
I do hate the imposter, I'm not bloodied but I am a dps build, I don't have an over abundance of health, so the pylons are hell
---
I'd be on board with that, slightly higher chance all around but a much higher chance in nuke zones, and yeah the queen and imposter in particular should be improved
---
Something else, both related and unrelated, I'd really like to see more, higher difficulty horde events
---
I would love deathclaw or snallygaster hordes, anything like that, having more of them would help with the legendary drop rate too
---
This is the only way I've played it (not saying much since I've only had the game for a week or so) and I find it fun. Kinda lonely, but perfectly enjoyable. Just like real life.
---
Hey that’s sound awesome. I’m up for it. And would love to join you in your raids.  I’m on PS4, I hope that isn’t a problem.
---
I just use the bloodied build on the queen, havn't tried junkies yet. But with a bloodied 25% faster fire rate gatling gun i deal around 140 dmg on the queen in combat. The stablizer adds 50% armor penetration  so its like using a bloodied anti armor weapon.
---
Mirelurk queen horde!! Lmao
---
Right? Or at least like a queen and 10 kings or something :P

Queen horde in the bog and King horde in mire and then the less strong hordes in other regions

Watch out we got a badass here. Those lv40 mole miners didn't stand a chance
---
Need to know if your using PA or not bud. If you are stabilized is a must. I prefer to run dodgy in the agility Tree as I never use VATS with heavy. 3 points in one fun Army is only useful for queen. You can switch out a lvl 1 and 3 version for more stuff. 
---
I always run nerd rage. It’s a nice what if... I also prefer to use thru hiker in agility for versatility.  Class freak isn’t that much a benefit for heavy gunner unless you’re running twisted muscles for a melee backup. 
---
Just fine things to consider man. I love face tanking with emergency protocols and nerd rage and adrenal reaction. Only thing I commonly die to is Murlock king.
---
Some robots, super mutants seem to resist .. and Scorchbeast.
---
If you still need to get the uplink it’s in the basement of the ski resort right next to top of the world. Right under the vendor there, go down the stairs. The keycard to open the security bars is under the mat right in front of them.
---
You would think, but as of now, if you’re engaged in PvP, your CAMP is fair game. Workshop PvP will engage it even if you have pacifist mode on.
---
Yeah that'd be the perfect way to do it too, didn't even think about it :)
---
For now the closest thing we have is the super rare census violence at thunder mountain substation tm-02 just north of watoga, at least that spawns deathclaws
---
Wow, it's like they hired me to do the math
---
Sadly it’s ps4
---
I bet I could carry a couple versions. Mutant slayer and troubleshooter
---
I run pretty much the same thing, with a few exceptions. The 3 I have in Endurance go for Fireproof, the 3 in Perception I use Concentrated Fire, and I have 11 in Intelligence with Gunsmith/Demolition Expert/Stabilized and just 5 in Agility for Adrenaline. 2 points for Strange in Numbers and 1 for another random Charisma card, Tenderizer is a must. I main an Anti Armor Explosive .50 Cal for PvE and a Mutants Explosive LMG for PvP. Still looking for an Executioner’s Explosive Weapon to switch to when the enemy’s health drops.
---
Glad I’m not the only one being stalked by the mayor and rose. It’s ridiculous. 
---
He has a dead body and she keeps saying how much she likes me.
---
Yes.  Platform?
---
I'm surprised they didn't do that from the beginning to boost the sale of Atom Shop items. Especially if that's the way it worked from the beginning, I don't think it's something people would be complaining about too much.  If they changed it now, there would be a small amount of complaining, I figure, but nothing major.
---
Honestly can't even recall the last time I've seen that event pop up. Almost forgot about it. If this is all just RNG I have seriously bad luck. Must have done something to deserve it lol. But it sucks to invest so much time and materials to not even be able to max out the scrip machine for the day....
---
Xbox
---
How much?
---
Vanguard to me is the best armor for my full health style but those are bad suffixes. Aqua boy gives me the same and charisma is a joke.
---
In white springs the ghouls will respawn still, it takes a while though. In fissure site prime the enemies in the trees will respawn as well. Other more random sites are totally hit and miss though, I know what you mean.
---
Wow aren't you proud. You sound like a cool guy with tons of friends
---
I don’t understand how it’s bugged. I finished the electrician badge Sunday, along with all the rest to get my high capacity mod and armor plates mod. Everything worked for me 🤷‍♀️
---
I've only found it like 6 times since launch, I think it's the rarest event I know of lol, when we needed deathclaw hides for pioneer scouts I tried hopping to find it, couple hours of "it's gunna be the next one, it has to be" later I gave up lmao
---
cool man whats your name in game i can help you level
---
Yea I noticed the missing wrist too. And was sad when I seen the skin was for a machete, already had a good knife ready. But I got lucky and found a junkies swing speed +strength machete in a vendor( junkies build)    Very lucky on my part.
---
Thanks, I'll try it.
---
Yeah, and I find Rose's voice much more annoying than the mayor.
---
Armor paints. Simple cans of paint you apply to armor pieces or costumes to change some basic color schemes. 1000 caps a can. Easy sink right there. Each can applied to one piece of armor. Some armor, combat armor for example, would have secondary color slot. 5k-10k cap sink there. And not even counting headwear either. Apply those paints to weapons too, even more caps!
---
15k point respec. Keep all cards, stats set to 1 and points refunded. 
---
purveyor same category, ie, minigun, legendary reroll.
---
5k for 1 star, 15k for 2 star, and  25k for 3 star.
---
That's just to name a few.
---
My new fav is "cannot place in water"  Quit registering the texture under the dirt!
---
I’m a pretty effective heavy. Your strength perks are spot on. Some of the others are spotty. (Refer to the other comments.) 
---
I focused my build on heavy commando. I have high perception and high strength. There are a lot of options   
---
Good build except the low health stuff which will only help against her majesty.
---
Player vending has helped, but there really needs to be more cap sinks. I’m hoping Wastelanders will add more vendors and create more things worth buying. More quality consumables would be excellent. Pricy drinks that provide strong resistance poison, disease, etc would be very handy. The existing items are great, magazines and food, but obviously not enough to get players to fork over the caps to keep on hand.
---
I do hope there are items to earn through faction credit, kinda like the pioneer scouts. The game does need more unique items that are hated behind an effort barrier. I don’t like the idea of being able to throw money at anything. Some stuff should be earned through deeds.
---
I know this will be a wildly unpopular opinion, but I think there should be incredibly valuable items that sell/trade for astronomical prices. As a high level player, the game needs white whales for end gamers to chase after. If Joe Sixpack can just save up 30k caps to buy a bloody fixer or legacy laser rifle, where do we all go from there? 
---
Any healthy economy needs a range of goods to appeal to various levels of wealth. Would I rather have a Porsche 911 in my driveway instead of a Honda Civic? Of course. Do I think I deserve one? No. If it was a priority in my life, I’d work hard towards it and gain the satisfaction of earning it. In 76 terms, earning and farming elite gear is hard, as it should be.
---
I dunno about new players, but I know I'm dying to level my last character slot in wastelanders. I've already got 4 characters, lv300, 200, 100, and 50.  The only reason I haven't filled my last slot is to save it for wastelanders.
---
Too bad, but good luck with your sales, and thx for the reply 👍

If you you don't have the fixer plan yet, you should be buying recall cards for encryptid to blow off caps.
---
I think the garbage reward is just their way of telling us all to get a life lmao
---
Actually if you think about it, the Scorched are already slaves to the plague/the Scorchbeasts, so us enslaving them would be like. Double slavery.
---
ok thanks
---
How long does this last?  My gaming rig is out of commission until friday.
---
Usually start with the thumbs down emote, then if it continues my friends and I will search for his camp and do a speed silo and nuke it...  Bad form old chap..
---
I use an ultracite gatling laser. If you don't mind farming it's ammo it's a real nice weapon. But you need to use Batteries Included for reduced energy ammo weight as fusion cores weigh lots without it.
---
Encryptid only takes maybe a dozen runs to get all the drops including the fixer plan. I've run out of cap sinks and just buying random stuff at vendor camps just adds to inflation :/
---
Here's what I run on my heavy Junkie's PA tank build.  I use a Junkie's FFR Gatling Gun on everything but the SBQ - I have a Junkie's FFR 50 Cal for her.  If you can get those two weapons, you don't really need anything else.  With Blocker and Suppressor, and Medic Pump on my PA chest, I don't need to run Dodgy, so I can use Thru-Hiker to free up stash space.  About the only time I need to watch my health is if there's a mob spewing poison.

I do like the idea of C.A.M.P's being part of a players specialization, although I feel like that should be standalone from factions but factions should have C.A.M.P bonuses for sure. (although that BoS 3 star loot drop just makes me want to troll tbh)
---
I figured out a workaround that helps deal with budget issues. Its hard to explain it in writing so I might take some time and make a YouTube video showing how it works. Meanwhile I can try and explain the concept so those that done similar things before can get an idea how its done - it basically involves not buying things from Atomic shop until Bethesda stops being silly and reworks budget restrictions. You're welcome.
---
There is a picnic area just north of the fairgrounds  where the trick or treater can spawn.  Also, on a camping hill between US 13C Bivouac and National Radio Astronomy Research Center and near a waterfall west of Gulper Lagoon.  They're all random encounters, but I've seen the trick or treater at all 3.
---
Yeah and how would you go on four wheels
---
If you do the math, that's a quarter of a cent per hour they pay us.
---
Yeah that’s them. Collector is forsure doable now, just annoying work to get. Unless someone duped a bunch of plasma grenade plans or they make the drop rate higher, I’ll sit it out on chemist
---
Speedy receiver for me.
---
You can build foundations out onto water if you wish. Like as floating shack.
---
No, it isn't. "work the market" is a terrible answer to the problem "inflation is out of control and we are returning to a barter system."
---
Oh shit I thought I out had to make em... but I thinks it’s the same as the one for the plasma grenade, which still is a no go to 99% of us all
---
I'd put it up for 1.2k with good stuff around it it will sell. Like i said thats a baller primary followed by 2 very meh.
---
If your not surrounding it with good gear.. 999 is the price and if the time comes in couple days toss it in the wood chipper. Wood chipper does not discriminate and you can drastically narrow down your choices.
---
I felt the same about the two missions at the prison. The one where you protect the robot has a guarantee weapon plan drop. Back when you couldn't buy the handmade plan at just about every vendor this was a solid place to get it. Haven't seen it in 5 months now probably, so long I can't even remember the name..
---
wood chipper?
---
Fellas, gimme a minute, I need to go scrap my junk...
---
This build works well for a heavy Bloodied build as well, BTW.  Just move one point from Strength to Endurance for Radicool and use Dodgy instead of Thru-Hiker.  That's what I use on my heavy Bloodied... He's a gunzerker/max DPS toon, but he's nearly as tanky as my heavy Junkie dude when I use Emergency Protocols.
---
Pipe revolver gets suppressor.
---
At least you don't have scortchbeats corpses following you
---
The scrip machine. Its always worth 29 scrips there and you can gamble for more
---
these are pretty good
---
When you hit the sprint button the power armor "transforms" in a way, the character leans forward.  Front wheels are on forearms.  Rear wheels are on shins.
---
Dunno why it'd need to be .38. The .44 pistol already does less damage than the other .44 revolvers.
---
What they need to do is add more challenging areas on the map.  Personally, I'd lie to see them redo the Burrows with lots of Super Mutants...
---
ah ok gotcha
---
50% sale is coming so stock up on it. 50 scrips will get you a random 3* of the variety you want.
---
Even bad or ok legendarys are good :)
---
I've managed to get campfire tales to pop up twice in roughly 20-25 hours of play since it started
---
The first time it glitched out and the second time I just got random crap as rewards  
---
All I want is that smores recipe so I can finish whichever badge it is that requires you to eat three of em, then I can be happy
---
Softandwet1
---
Although what I meant by I hate the leveling system is the card perks, lack of real special stats and the same issue as fallout 4 with no more skills
---
PVP in FO76 is trash, they should have just made it solidly COOP PVE with NW as the PVP mode.
---
Like with ESO, I'm sure a majority of the Devs don't play the game. There is probs a handful but other than that I can't say
---
Thanks!
---
Nice find for 40 scrip.
---
My account has almost 2k hours and my characters are locked and loaded. You know what my "endgame" is? Turning garbage legendaries into the purveyor and deciding between 3* melee for a chance at a bear arm, or 3* ranged for a chance at a fixer. That's it. That's the endgame since you can't get those as world drops.
---
I've found 4 or 5 good rolls in world drops and exactly 1 god roll.
---
You're better off gambling or buying what you want odds wise no 3* is to be shamed when the return is better odds at what you want!
---
Someone literally already made a mod to fix the textures on the responders outfit. It infuriates me that I need to use a mod to fix an issue that shouldn’t even exist. They made the pre-war flag different from the current American flag, but can’t be bothered to consistently use it. 
---
I appreciate you added the engineers outfit to the list. It’s not one that actually affects me, but one of my friends has been dealing with it.
---
Oh I’m not tryna sell it was just a piece of advice. 🤣🤣
---
Imagine similar action to entering into light cycle on Tron Legacy.  Same motion, less digital and more mechanical.
---
Yes, some of the time as intended. RNG is sometimes frustrating on FO76 for sure.
---
The power up the power plant part is bugged for a lot of people. It just won't check off. I've powered up multiple power plants multiple times and it won't work.
---
The 100% most reliable spot is the military bunker. You find them in any building that would have been “owned” by the government. Also in the vault raids. lol
---
I do hope they up the drop rate - not so it's common, but a bit more frequent.
---
Damn, I'm jealous  
---
I'm sitting here with my bloodied, swing speed +1 str combat knife wishing it could look like a kitchen knife!  
---
Also upset about my wrist.
---
I know the one you mean lol it was fun, was it jailbreak or something? I didn't end up getting the handmade plan until that update that made the plans at vendors more common
---
I miss mu companion cube. ...
---
Bloodied is much better than AA if you are willing to commit to the build.
---
I’ve put over 1000 hours into this game and am still amazed by the skyline and sights in it all the time.
---
A max of 5
---
10% damage per addiction and the damage stacks up to 50%
---
I play 95% solo and really enjoy it. However being it's a shared works with alot of generous people , it is well worth venturing to people's camps and checking out their vending machines. Lots of good weapons can be had for cheap prices.
---
Another tip use this builder planner. Mess around with it and get familiar with the perks. Each special max out at 15. You get to to choose 1 special per level. You also get to pick 1 perk card per level, and you get a perk pack every 5 levels (contains  4 free perk cards). You get special points up till level 50. At level 50 and up you get to either pick a new perk card or move one of you special points around. Nice thing about this system is specials can be moved to allow you to respec your build. Perk cards can be removed whenever  and swapped around for situations. 
---
One key thing that I didn't realize is when you select your special point when you level you DO NOT need to select a perk card in that specials category , you can scroll to the other specials and select one of their cards instead if you want. For example when you level, you can put a special point in strength, but select the bloody mess perk card, which is a luck card.
---
Here's a good build planner
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
There is a leveling map it gives you after you create your build to help to distribute your points and pick perks efficiently .
---
Why can't more PvPers be like you?
---
This is Grafton's Mayor...
---
Jailbreak was the one on top of the prison where mad dogs gang was escaping. That one was fun too. I think it was called pardon me.
---
1) eso is in waaaay better shape than fo76. I've been playing eso for years.
---
2) fo76 and eso have different sets of devs from different companies. If the two could somehow collaborate, i think it would be beneficial for fo76.
---
Because the game doesn't have a .357 magnum 😀.
---
Haha plz come take all my mines and grenades - I drop them constantly
---
In Aion I farmed  [**Chaos Dracus**](http://aiondatabase.net/us/npc/211800/) for 9 months to get the Chaos Spear, and it finally dropped only after I decided to level my character past 35.... so I just sold it.
---
It doesn't have .38 special either. The .38 is a 9mm. Note how it's used in semi-autos.
---
Missing:.
---
* Fire Proof III  
---
* Stabilized III  
---

Don't need:

* Radicool

* Ghoulish

* Suppressor  
---
* Dead Man Sprinting  
---
Dubious:  
---
* Starched Genes: The only time you need this perk is when you're clearing rads. It's definitely a must-have, but not a must-have-at-all-times.  
---
* Class Freak: Ehhhh... Not sure the drawback from the mutations you've selected are bad enough to justify the three stat points. Might get more bang for your buck shifting points to intelligence instead for stabilized, power user, and other power armor perks.

Yeah, not sure why someone downvoted this though lol.
---
Atom shop items shouldn’t count towards budget imo
---
Shit you could probably fit 2 guys in power armor on that door
---
That would be awful for server stability which is kinda the whole reason budget exists
---
All I want in life is to catch a massive mutated dolphin/shark. Is that too much to ask Bethesda? IS IT!!!!!
---
They won't change because there are what some refer to as 'whales' which are those people that spend obscene money on mtx that make up for everyone else not buying them
---
Ty for the reminder
---
Lucky. I still need Whoopies to finish the challenge.
---
I’m pretty sure it’s radiation, I mean they do pop out of the ground which is full of nuclear material
---
Did you even read his post?
---
They can afford things in the atom shop and he can afford to buy atoms, they choose not to because the pricing sucks, 14 or 15 euro for a power armor skin is too much, 5 euro for a fucking ceiling fan is too much. The question of this person's ability to earn atoms or ability to afford them is not up for debate here, the prices at which items are set is.
---
Holy shite
---
Sometimes, I'm just standing on the porch of my camp in the Forest, listening to the sound of the leaves rustling, and the crows cawing in the distance. Then I think to myself, "where are all the damn crows?"
---
I tried to murder someone’s death claw with my junkies exploding .50HMG. Nothing happened except some awkward glances between myself and the owner and his buddies.  They killed me rather quickly. I asked him why I did no damage to it and he gave me a convoluted answer and I just “climbed aboard my starship and headed for the sky”
---
I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU ALL FOR THE TIPS SO FAR. Yall are way more helpful then I expected on this post.
---
Pretty much all multiplayer encounters will just be you and another person's waving at each other and that's it
---
Hit me up on xbox sokc I will give some tips and some XP items. We can head an get some lvls
---
^ this has ALL the info you need on a junkies build. Currently running 5 addictions and I’d recommend some Daddy-O to EVERYONE!!!
---
Doin the Lords work.
---
Do I roll the mole guys 3 star weapon to get the junkie stuff or is there a mission or plan I can get it from?
---
Come sail away
---
It would be quite the undertaking. Then we would need to factor in modifiers and legendary. 
---
I'm of the opinion that armor is essential to your character, whether they're running 1 STR or 15 STR so the weight isn't even a factor, for me.
---
If you're inclined, feel free to use my information though.
---
Commando&gt;rifleman as far as dps goes
---
Yeah I was getting mixed signals as to whether or not you can just casually kill animals or if Bethesda fixed it so you can't, so idk. Some clarity would be nice.
---
No, you don't. It means INvoluntarily CELibate. Just because you want to use it to describe a specific subset of those people doesn't mean they are the only ones it applies to.
---
Makes sense, but ever replaced a perfectly good working phone for a fancier one? I believe this is the model they're working under.
---
I have a vampire Gatling later that sucks up health incredibly fast
---
That's interesting, with me he said something along the lines of "A spitting image of one of our founding fathers" when he took my picture. I thought this was everybody but maybe it's because I was wearing the Tricentennial Outfit
---
I mean, even if you aren't doing a melee build why is your strength so low in a survival game?  at the very least you need it for carrying stuff, no matter what build, not saying it has to be 15 but you are probably the only player in the entire game with that low of a strength stat...  I don't think I have seen 1 build on nukesdragons with a strength that low...
---
I've always really enjoyed playing alone, especially fallout. I love building and collecting stuff and exploring to learn the secrets of the fallout universe. The only time I've accepted team invites from other players has been when they come from players I actually know in real life.
---
I also find satisfaction from aiding other players (especially low levels) during spontaneous fire fights and even receiving help myself when I'm in a bind by pure happenstance. It makes it feel like a world where humans are truly teaming up against the atrocities brought about by the wasteland. 
---
I really thought I was going to hate this game, and while I do feel the story could have been so much better as a single player story with human NPC's throughout the main questline, this has without a doubt become my favorite fallout game. I highly recommend it.
---
I'm level 93 and my next goal is to launch a nuke completely on my own and get the first shot off on the queen before I hit level 100.
---
Yeah, I've lost a couple. Then there was that damn annoying Radstag that suddenly started living under my house. He would stick his antlers up through the floorboards every now and then, but one day he just disappeared.
---
Where is the Excabator Power Armor in the Lore?  It isn't.  Maybe this would be better in "Fallout 5: Murder (Motor) City".
---
Damn just got off
---
True but I kind of view that as being in a slightly different category than the traditional revolvers, since it can be modded into a rifle. But either way I forgot about that one
---
I run a PS4 pro connected to a good receiver using a toslink digital connection. Five speaker surround, with a 15 inch subwoofer. The sounds in this game are really incredible, the chirping birds, water flowing. And when I hit the ground in power armour,  pictures damn near fall off the wall.
---
Also, have a look at this:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bclykn/yabs\_junkie\_guide\_or\_how\_i\_learned\_to\_stop/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bclykn/yabs_junkie_guide_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/)
---
I've played solo the entire time. You need people for the queen but if your drop a nuke in the right place people generally show up.
---
I've attempted the raid once with people I found on discord. I thought it was pretty lame way to waste resources so I havent done it again.
---
In my opinion it's great solo. Similar to the old fallouts with less depth (hopefully wastelanders helps). That's not to say currently the story isnt good I just miss running across others. End game is a little shallow but I'm yet to make a second character, I enjoy collecting supply's by consuming the supplies I am collecting lol.
---
Until October 15 according to de oficial web.
---
One can hope it means they moved their asset team(s) to work on Wastelanders
---
no as long as you are in pacifist mose no one can harm your pet cept enemies
---
They created a gold standard for caps, I guess it keeps the economy stable?
---
Yep.  I got FIVE out of the WS Bunker today. Usually only get 2!  
---
Haven’t done the raids yet but if only for this reason, I may need to.
---
300k for high capacity plan you say? I got an extra.....
---
You have to acquire the recipe and make them not eat them mate, but good luck finding the other rare recipes to complete this particular challenge. I haven't seen any of the rare recipes yet
---
Alright good to know
---
There's still so much stuff I'd like to get but I only have ~600 Atoms and I don't want to purchase any with real money. Does anyone know if the raider gas mask (the one with the helmet) if it protects you from airborne hazards?
---
Scrapping
---
I wasent talking about legendaries eather smh i was giving examples.fuck i got a dragon i use that aint legendary.
---
ty for looking that up
---
Lol gears 5 is killing itself with the prices of their store and makes this games atom Store seem generous af
---
Thanks man.
---
Lore friendly way? It's a little late to be asking for things like that, the lore forest has been pretty much clear cut
---
I have one of thoes floating homes and even with most cut out i still run out of budget.
---
My shop if full of midteir 3 star legendaries all prices under 2k... exploding faster fire bloodied... 
---
I sell all the time and save up to get around 25k caps or so then buy some god tier over on the trading Reddit and the cycle continues
---
As a player approaching 1000 hours and level 300 I still find caps valuable
---
I have had such a bad time completing the challenges I almost don't play any more, I have no idea how to complete anything without having to watch several 30 min video walkthroughs and that just seems counter intuitive
---
Really? Where did you learn this magic?
---
I keep my stash at 400 as a level 300 player just so I can do this. I don’t have any junk or stuff in my stash and use improved repair kits for all my already modded out god tier gear. Just gotta grind my man.
---
Brotherhood although I'm not really down with their motives/methods. I 'll just play it like 4 and just looted yet another downed vertibird. 
---
Responders just is meh to me. Like the free states but with less of a cohesive community. 
---
Enclave would be cool too but I don't think they'll have as many cool toys as the brotherhood (I will come to regret saying that. I know enclave have proprietary plasmas and the orbital platform and I know they most likely won't add usuable vertibirds but I still prefer the brotherhood)
---
Possum are harder than Tadpole -good luck. 👍
---
No problem. Here is the link, if you ever want to check out what's new you can just scroll down to "News" and it will link you to the latest stuff they added: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4A7NTnbcR27ioluqhvqpBX/atomic-shop-patch-13-items-and-sales-october-8
---
Thanks for the info.
---
It'll probably work. You might even be able to place the witch hat and skull mask into the display cabinet's
---
Haha, I wish. Nah it just spawned in as a dead scorched deathclaw with the name "Deathclaw" as the corpse container. I knew it was my pet because scorched deathclaw corpses don't randomly spawn in the forest.
---
Saw one in a vendor - not cheap. 40 caps is nothing, I would have snapped those up.
---
I only need one more.
---
You've inspired me - I will.
---
I don't even bother with the enemies unless they attack me. I just sit up high and wait for speakers to break, the go and repair them. I can't be bothered to push for the legendaries. Lol
---
I sold a peppered one for 4k
---
I'm not quite there yet although I can 2-3 shot most non-legendaries. When I do get there though yeah, of course I'll be doing it and trying out new builds and different toys like you said. But I'll always keep my tesla gun for tagging stuff at events. There's a ton of other places to go all out with your best gear and just mow through crowds of scorched or super mutants or whatever without ruining the experience for other players.
---
Don’t worry, I’m sure some dude will let you “clap his cheeks” if you keep trying and don’t give up. Go get em, Queen!
---
That's a shame haha. Maybe they'll add tombstones to the Atom Shop for Halloween so you can give Sprinkles a proper burial.
---
Pretty sure I have a smores recipe in my vendor for 10 Caps, yours free if you're on Xbox?
---
Exactly!
---
Don’t get me started on BFA. Trash xpac
---
They're seriously not that bad. None of the individual objectives require excessive grinding, and there's enough easy objectives to be able to get your first backpack mod without too much hassle. The only really bad ones are the bugged ones, and Collector since it depends so much on magazine RNG.
---
(Or maybe the problem is that they're *not* grindy, and you actually have to go out of your way to do and find specific things instead of just throwing yourself into a meat grinder a million times.)
---
Yeah me too, considering it would get them more money it's surprising there's none.
---
The smiling medical mask is rubbish. The mouth is on your nose. I got it to match the asylum outfit and hat.
---
PSA: if you get a free icon it will auto-equip it. If you want it but don't want to use it, you'll have to go select your preferred icon afterwards.
---
Me too dude. To bummed to play, my home is gone 😞
---
a trio of griefers who tried to blow my camp up with artillery fire. either that or they were just trying to be annoying, I'm not sure.
---
besides them, there used to constantly spawn a super mutant primus, often legendary, on the very high cliff above my old camp location. he'd stand up there and take pot shots all damn day. I'd come back to my camp with walls gone and lights off because that dick destroyed my generator.
---
Somehow I had the high cap mod before i got the backpacks unlocked even. I did campfire tales a bunch, wondering if that will drop the unlock from there?
---
ah okay, cool thank you.
---
I guess I must have then. I was pretty certain  I had it from a NPC vendor though I've had it a while so I may well be wrong.
---
I would gladly take your 300k. But I'm maxed on caps... 😂
---
I still haven’t received some achievements. I’ve caught all diseases. I’ve been at a ground zero. I’ve picked the melon blossom. 
---
Give me atoms.
---
Oh my god it's one of the reasons I want to uninstall the game
---
Oh, c'mon. In GTA Online you can earn 3,5kk game $ in two days. Or in one day if you have a team and good in heists. And your ingame income is absolutely unlimited. No shitty limits like 4 boring (!) dailies for pathetic 50 atoms per day.
---
This is equal to real 50$. Can anybody say, that GTAO is unsupported by microtransactions? You want players to buy more things? - Add more content.
---
did you modify the ini files?
---
All of it
---
I'd rather have decent servers, thank you.
---
Not pissing anyonr of is easy. Use a tessla. Keep a spare one.
---
I like the possum ones but hated tadpole. I just got enough of them done for the basic bag two weeks ago and I’ve been playing since beta.
---
Lever gun with max rifleman perk cards are nice. The extra ap with luck critical savvy perk card while pressing fire and crit button same time will do heaps of damage. Crouching with max sneak and covert operative perk cards are a plus.
---
Secret R&amp;D lab located in WV, goverment contract to create faster power armor for scouts/shock troops
---
I just want to have fun. Even pvpers can be supportive in different ways.
---
The pets should always re-spawn or repair-all should work on pets as well.
---
Supposedly, each pet has a limited number of respawns (unless it bugs out) after which it will be lost.
---
I hate how hard it is to find a pet only to randomly loose it. It should be permanent with the option to "set it free" if you wish to remove it.
---
RIP my lovely mirelurk king, you are missed.
---
They do a bit more damage and are a drop from the SBQ(everytime).there not sold elsewere,only from players who got one and dind read it
---
The fixer plans rewarded from encryptid event are cool. Very nice of players whom learned those fixer plans and rolled out from purveyor to sell legendary fixers in their machines.
---
You paid a right good price for a great rifle. Try to use it with a vats crit sneak rifleman build. 8 mutations.
---
It's all that glare
---
If you have a spare legendary that you tend to use for the SBQ it is worth putting it on just to help out with the extra damage. Gatling plasma with the fusion core perk doubles the ammo so that is nice.  The plans are dropped by scorchbeasts rarely and the SBQ always gives one (at least in my case)   
---
Some of the ammo is assinie to make though so it would need to be a special occasion weapon.   
---
But honestly they are nothing super special just a QoL to help out.
---
They should be removed, like cap mines were. People Will get angry, but lack of balance Is dangerous.
---
Could have used you earlier tonight, where it was me (lvl 99) and one other player (lvl 136) at One Violent Night. And that other player hardly contributed. Melee attacks exclusively, with three 3* ghouls and the 3* wendigo as part of the fun.
---
oh yeah you're prolly right
---
Yup have the ones they sell, still need to fill out the rest.  Current weapon is pretty OP (QE handmade) so will probably sit on this until it's specced out.
---
I hear ya,so damn annoying!the a”holes waiting @ the door so nothing gets past it and even running outside to kill it first...

---
They're adding another set of badges soon too aren't they?
---
The budget is fine. You have too many things in your CAMP.
---
I have 2 bloody prime LMGs and I absolutely love em. They fucking shred the queen. U get a good group using prime weapons against her and she just melts. You can buy flux for 100c per if u try hard enough. If you run alot of queens I would say its worth having one for those.

Just south of top of the hill, beckwith farms. I've been there since last November and have no intention of ever moving. There's a pond, cliffside view, close to whitesprings for good vendor traffic, close to a train station, a red chest, 2 plans and a random mod that regularly spawn, an ammo case, it's a relatively central location so fast travel never gets too crazy, and 3 enemies spawn there every time someone shows up so I dropped a few turrets and let them do all the work for free scrap/meat
---
I have had the queen fallow me tho it was dead. Also been a mutated torch for hrs but never got any fire damage.also had the box from the airport fallow me everywere.
---
There's also a receipe for s'mores. I just made them myself.
---
I have had my number of Scorchbeasts being dropped on my yard, but never a care package
---
It is the best realised fallout world to date. I spend a lot more time wandering and immersing myself in the world than I do questing or grinding.  
---
It is a shame so many people boycotted the game because of the launch and other reasons, as I know if they could ignore that stuff they would find a really excellent new fallout world to explore.
---
Beta player here for 588 hrs.
---
looks great man👍🏼
---
Inspired by this post I went and grabbed the high capacity mod. Totally forgot about using the badges to buy stuff so I had some saved up. Why the fuck would you even get that mod? -60 energy resist and -60 rad resist? I mean if you use PA all the time I guess I could see that, but for someone like me that doesn't fuck all of that.
---
I have been playing the game since launch and only just started exploring blast zones. Damn what an awesome atmosphere! The Burrows is another notably good atmosphere as far as sounds go.
---
Yeah, light billboards like mothman and nuka cola ones require about 12-15% camp budget, iirc. They really need to start putting budget requirements in the atom shop description or remove budget cost completely for each first atom shop item you build like the other guy said...
---
That's true. I have no problem with PvPers, you guys deserve to have fun too. But it's the ones that contest a workshop just to kill me when I actually need resources from it that I can't stand, since I'm not WANTING to PvP.
---
If you decide it's too expensive, or you don't like it, you can always switch back. I run a Prime Plasma, and I thought it was gonna be hella expensive to make ammo but honestly it's super cheap.
---
Yeah, its a little over 316 days played with zero breaks. Maybe if this was going to be a 10 year game or something then I could see it by the die hard, but as of now it is just a timer.
---
Thats why I leave the server if I hit like 28k when someones buying.
---
I remember even WoW faction farming to be a lot more tenuous than fo76. For an MMO it's really not that exhausting.
---
I seriously don't get what issues people have with fo76. So many of them are far worse with many or most comparable games.
---
I'm on the possum badges for 2 months now. If I'ld solve the hardest, longest questlines to get the rarest items within days, what would there be left to do?
---
Just buy 556. Its basically a 2nd currency
---
Yup, it the recent atom bundles for 1500 atoms have been so much better with the exchange rate for me to buy.
---
High capacity is dumb.  Armored or insulated all day
---
They have multiple characters
---
They probs have the caps on their other characters and are adding them all together
---
This. The possum challenges complete themselves over time on a new character
---
Then how can you trust them to buy something for more than 30000 caps Can't they just cheat you
---
No, not everything is ironed out. They probably never will be. 
---
Who fucking cares, it's fun when it works. If it works for you, play it. If it doesn't, don't.
---
No it doesn't.  All we are gonna catch are magikarps.
---
I thought they would have been out that night.  Lied to yet again.   Ooo piece of candy.
---
I have a shitty 10mm I use for events. I'll plug a leg in each thing, and wait for everyone else to get hits. If the things are then dead, great, if not I'll bust out the bigger guns to finish stuff off.
---
good plan, I'll probably do the same
---
You can tag them from your junk menu, even if you have all of them. Just look for the component view and then highlight which ones you need
---
Learned the Hard way lol had to drop a couple shoppers when I realized what was going on
---
thanks
---
Yes, but if that happens they are blacklisted from the reddit and they won't be able to trade with people who check vendors blacklist
---
I personally enjoyed camp destruction as it was when the game came out. Even bethesda i beleive said that camps were meant to be movable during launch and that enemy forces could destroy it if you werent going to protect it. I think there should be a warning alert when someone is shooting your camp and that walls should be more durable but i definatly think that they should bring back camp destruction and the bounty system. I think the bounty should be twice as high for camp destruction as well. Getting rid of camp destruction ruined the bounty hunter role play that exsisted before they got rid of it. Many players I know with high end gear would roam servers and watch out for players griefing camps and would fight them for their bountys. and i would always give something to the poor camp owner who couldnt stand up for themselves. I vote bring back camp destrcution
---
Barbarian and Ironclad aren't worth it on a low HP rifle build. Better of putting those points into either Luck for Serendipity, Intelligence for Nerd Rage, or Endurance for Rejuvenated
---
You can't but if your buying mutiple armor pieces (set) let's say for 30k you can buy each piece for 5k at a time and the last piece for 10k, or a weapon I bought for 40k i had to friend him and did 20k on two characters. I could see he was a high level vender with a friend helping him with holding caps. So I chatting to him and he seemed legit. But not everyone will be the same.
---
You could join us. IGN is AmberdaFriendlyGhost.
---
I get very rare disconnects these days, as do most peopel I play with. Could be an issue on your end, the servers are not that unstable.
---
I think asking other people here is fine. Most people are rather helpful.
---
Bonus is they don't weigh much, so it's not that big a hindrance.
---
Nah its fine man if you don't want to pvp.
---
How about no....Scott
---
That's why i sell all my ammo for one cap
---
You probably pressed Take All when spamming the buttons, or accidentally hit it with your finger.
---
There is no "take all" for the stash.
---
Generally i sell stuff for what the vendors offer.  At least that lets players save their caps for whats important or gives them enough caps to spend on something frivolous.
---
Seems to be as accurate as the really random RNG 😞
---
Most likely ppl exploiting duping glitches and crashing the server.  And on that note, if you come across tons of landmines scattered around, leave em be.  Using duped items can get you banned.  
---
And yes you can find ppl to team up with here.  Ppl also like to invite everyone on a map and hope someone bites.
---
Shielded lining is the top upgrade for any underarmor. To get shielded lining you must complete events that are tied to the faction or location.
---
Except it isn't and we're not.
---
Work the market.  Play the game.
---
You can change the view in the pip bou. I think right stick on xbox. Itll show you all materials that make up junk. You can tag and untag I individual base materials this way.
---
wel not for the enclave one you can just go grab it for free
---
No, they shouldn't. Pay your money you meanie.
---
Keep on repeating that platitude and it might make sense, prices on every market are skyrocketing because caps are losing value and you cannot deny that. The player base is increasingly sitting on max caps with nothing to spend it on. The only items I  want from the market are QFFR25 and not a single person in the world will sell those for caps. Not to mention that the market is flooded with duped fixers and legacy gatling plasmas. I want in-game ways to spend caps, not markets full of duped legacies people are asking 5 to 1 exchanges for. If you did any amount of trading you would know the game economy is facing massive inflation.
---
We need more cap sinks to balance out cap creation.
---
"work the market" what a joke.
---
and on rhe trading forum which i wont mention here you have a karma sysytem and is mostly reliable
---
where is it?
---
tanagra there is a shed with a coded door ...you would be better off just googleing about it
---
Yea I don’t know how you can build external service, I’m on PS4 which really doesn’t allow much customization/3rd party plugins etc. When I want to pvp I simply play COD hardcore Free-for-all, a mode I had always hoped that FO could incorporate.
---
Haha woof 'em down
---
where is the bos one?
---
technical data?
---
Since the last Patch I finally got some Badges from the daylies. So it should do know. But before that it was the same for me, did the daylies really every day and never got a badge.
---
yup
---
No I was just saying those who spent lots of real world money will complain the most when ‘survival’ was removed. I don’t think all PVPers use duped stuff. But those who do ruined the experience for both pvp and pve players.
---
how do you trigger the quest i can never get it to work.
---
Beta player here, I'm sat at 1100 hours and I still think I won't hit 7600 hours.
---
Now factor that into the stats 😂
---
I play when I can but I've played since beta, this is the first fallout I have played that I have a cap issue. I'm only a level 57 with modest gameplay and I basically grind the stuff I got from the purveyor.
---
It's better than 4 or 5 dead scorchbeast falling from the sky everywhere you go
---
I second this I'm a one shot melee build but I always keep a low level rifle on me for events like uranium fever etc
---
Cool, I'll add you when I get home.
---
I still can't get my Tadpole Mamologist badge as no photo I take of a Radstag seems to count (dead or alive), plus I have never seen a living one just called 'Radstag' without anything else. The photo ones are just buggy as...
---
It totally could be on my end. I'm just not sure how. I play Apex and most other games without an issue. Weird that only this game has disconnection issues...
---
I giggle when it happens. Maybe um just soo use to all the bugs.
---
That's amazing! Thank you so much for the great work.
---
Could you include the Armor you get from the Raid in Vault 94? (Solar, Thorned) Just a suggestion.
---
These are the people that made it obvious they used the disarm XP exploit.
---
I had no idea there were duping glitches (I didn't really think about it though).
---
DCs and CTDs are as it turns out 'part of the experience'.
---
Said that server stability has improved - again, we seem to go up and down on that one - and is not unusual - at least for me - to go 4-5 hours without experiencing one or the other. In fact I don't remember the last time I was bothered by either and flawed as I am I tend to remember these things, probably worse than they were.
---
Which is fair enough I guess? Even with a carefully and meticulously curated load order this could be me playing New Vegas and only a bit 'wonkier' than FO4.
---
Regarding lfg can't really say; I am my own party of me, myself, I and that other fella that looks a lot like me.
---
You can store 30K caps on each character. You can have up to 5 characters / account.
---
Ugh. Collect bug bits, scrap by accident, rinse, repeat.
---
You sound like a literal piece of shit. Good riddance.
---
That's a sweet helmet, too.
---
Repair deathclaw &gt; requires two deathclaw hands, deathclaw meat, deathclaw skull. 
---
Hello frankenclaw.
---
She can also spawn in between the crashed plane and big maw in the Mire. There’s a little pond there with a random encounter spot.
---
&gt;The only items I want from the market are QFFR25 and not a single person in the world will sell those for caps.
---
Sounds like a personal issue rather than a Bethesda game problem
---
&gt; If you did any amount of trading you would know the game economy is facing massive inflation.
---
I know that I can always find what I want if I work the system long enough - thanks for the condescension tho !
---
I think we should all get ponies !
---
Scorched animals yes, scorched humans no.
---
And then they introduce Nuka Balls with better catch ratio than Ultra Balls!
---
The game also works for me a lot worse in the past 2 weeks. Sometimes i run 2 accounts to transfers caps/ items / complete challenges but lately it starts stuttering and crashing when i run 2 accounts. It worked fine for a few months though.
---
Yeah, it's not really the DCs that bother me, but the fact that if i'm in a building or area it puts me outside that area when I log back in. Sometimes it puts me where I was like 30 minutes before...but I still have the stuff (and encumbrance *sigh*) from right before I got dc'd.
---
You keep saying work the system, do you really think you are doing something special by checking player vendors nonstop or checking the trade discord nonstop? You should be well informed about the price trends. Good for you that you can find what you are looking for. The last weapon I bought from the trade discord cost me 55k (check my post history) and in 2 days I'm back at max caps again. Inflation is out of control and you are ignorant if you can't see it happening.
---
&gt;The last weapon I bought from the trade discord cost me 55k (check my post history) and in 2 days I'm back at max caps again.
---
You're so 1337 I fail to see what you issue is ??
---
Prime receivers for most of the gun not only add some damage to best non-prime receiver, but on top of that you'll also get bonus damage (35% since last patch) to scorched and SBs. It comes with the cost of ultracite ammo, which require fluxes and ultracite scraps to craft, but it's worth it (since last patch they've also increased the amount crafted with each flux). I have both my Bloodied .50 Cals (BE+B10) Primed and I love them - they shred everything in seconds.
---
did you happen to do collision course recently?
---
Trash because you are bad at it?
---
I wish they did like WoW Set time and day.
---
That's your problem, sorry that the in-game economics are above your head. I saw your comment on that AA fixer you said isn't worth 15k but it would be if it were vampire's. You really are a fool.
---
30 minutes rollback is pretty extreme, I don't think I have ever experienced back myself. 5 minutes is the longest one I could track, because a trade took place that the server decided it didn't take place but it decided to send the items involved down the devil's anus anyway.
---
The spawning however, that is by design. It will - or should anyway, is not flawless - spawn you in the last 'notable' location you visited.
---
The reduced vats cost is what makes this gun nice. It's overall a very good roll
---
Indeed I doubt that things will ever change as this sub reddit has really taken a turn for the worst. Maybe the wastelanders dlc will change things for the better but i guess only time will tell.
---
As long as the owner is in passive players cant do anything. Greafers already tried that at my Steel wall floating home. They even tried with a fat man and a missle launcher. Nothing worked for them.
---
i had the government supply crate everywhere i went too, end up calling it a night cause of it
---
You seem to be getting awfully mad about someone who just has a different opinion than yourself.
---
1 stab.
---
yeh and it was dropping like 4 crates at a time then
---
This is a perfect weapon for VATS auto, can easily solo sbq with it.
---
Lmao 25 reduced vats cost is the best minor legendary effect you can get and you call it "bland". Go troll a different subreddit. And did you forget that the fixer has higher base damage than the handmade?
---
Good luck to you brother.. keep grinding!
---
Awww buddy let's agree to disagree. I'll keep sitting at max caps on every character and you can keep "working the market". whatever that means.
---
I got one 2 weeks ago from the daily where you have to get Sweetwater honey. Don’t normally bother with dailies but since they now give scrip I’ve been doing them. Got a travelling leather coat 2 days ago from a daily.
---
If you don't mind.  I found exactly zero info on the pencils or the comic.
---
Yes theres that reason but the market suffers due to a lack of gear or purchase opportunities, it creates a crazy hyper inflated market for buying high end weapons and armor
---
Completely agree on making it harder to gain high end gear and also cap sinks.
---
That's more than I have done lol.
---
I got the small backpack plans from Morgantown Airport, built the level 50 version and decided that was good enough .
---
No even wearing a power armor suit ;)
---
i play asian mmos. stuff like "kill 3000 of these" are normal quests. f76 is boring in comparison. make what you will of that.
---
Thank you!!
---
I felt pretty bad for them. The three i saw at the silos were all around level 50-60. Wish i could give them a nuka cola and a pat on the back
---
Yes, you’re a shitty gamer
---
Corn soup.  And I don;t have to pay 15K for it either
---
For comparison, I have been playing Warframe every day for a reasonable amount of time since launch in 2013 and it's my most played game ever since I made steam account in 2010, and I have just under 3000 hours in it. :D
---
You mean, these mmos somehow achieve it to offer boring tasks in a more pleasant way? Or that f76s tasks are not sufficiently tedious? :D Please explain!
---
That is because is not a GSC, is... [The Luggage](https://discworld.fandom.com/wiki/The_Luggage)
---
I found a three star bloodied lever action in one once. Only level 35 but it is still utterly lethal
---
tedious like Call of Duty Dark Matter, yet still we grind ;)
---
You know, it would be nice if you could address my actual talking-points instead of attacking strawmen like some greasy, under-handed, money-obsessed merchant.
---
I didn't say "as long as there is a pvp mode;" I said, "open pvp mode," by which I meant open-world. I don't want just any pvp mode. I want something very specific. Survival mode, basically.
---
Furthermore, how does us being a minority equal less revenue (as if that should matter to begin with), considering this is not an either/or proposition? It's a proposition of inclusion, which, practically, could only equal more revenue, considering the fact that there are people such as myself who will not play at all if there remains nothing in the game which makes it worth playing. So yes, the only way our exclusion could increase revenue (again, as if maximizing revenue should even matter), is if the cost to maintain an extra server is so outrageous that those of us who play survival could not cover the costs. But, frankly, I'm not sure there's any  actual evidence of that. 
---
And lol You have a problem with me because I want to enjoy the game I paid for by having them not axe a game mode which already exists? lol Ok, bugman. I'm very sure it doesn't have anything to do with your sense of inferiority in the face of opposition and the bitter resentment which comes from being killed in PVP and being too weak to do anything about it.
---
And frankly, that they could make more money by doing this or that is irrelevant. Bethesda have an ethical obligation to put their fans and the integrity of their art before greed. And I'm sure you'd agree...if only the shoe were on the other foot.
---
And lol You don't get to tell me what games are suited to me, guy. If those games were suited to me, I'd be playing them. I know from experience that they are not, however.
---
Also...you believe I deserve to be treated as a second class citizen because I want survival mode back?  Are you serious? lol Yes, yes...I believe you are serious. Such is the nature of the mass-man, after all. He hates anything besides himself--anything exceptional, anything strong. He wants to opress it all so he can carry on feeling good about his medicocrity. Thus, as can always be expected from democratic societies, we get the tyranny of the weak. lol How absurd. I don't believe you should be treated poorly or have your opinions dismissed because you prefer PVE, but because I prefer something you don't, well...I'm hardly a person, eh? lol Such a fucking clown world. *honk honk*
---
Lol i only once got disconnected right after I pushed the launch button....
---
The musician badge isn't bugged anymore on xbox
---
Literally telling the person inhibits the goal of robbing them thats a fact. We aren’t talking about how ethical the playstyle is
---
Ah yes how could I forget that guns drop with Corn Soup as a legendary effect.
---
 Do you always act like this or just when you know you are wrong? It's adorable
---
Me and my girl router up (2 TVs, 2 ps4s)
---
She had the crate curse for like 2 hours, I kept laughing at her, then like an idiot I got curious and tried to open one and I got cursed. About ever five minutes another empty crate dropped that only I could see. Went back to my camp and one fell through 2 floors into my garage! Tried to remove the wood sub floor, it dropped to the grass then I couldn’t replace the floor, got pissed moved camp a little ways down and it just stayed there smoke and all, taunting me every time I went back!
---
It stayed about another hour until I logged off. 
---
I have 22 govt supply holos that I’m too scared to use now.
---
Ummm.. 15K seems WAY overpriced for a fixer with mediocre legendaries attached to it. I mean they were selling this for 35 times base price (!!). You're just really getting better anti-armor and a small VATS improvement  on it which is nice to be sure but not nearly 15K nice (imho) .  Frankly I wouldn't have paid over 2K for it myself.  For 15K Ids be looking at explosive effects and either a bloodied or vampire legendary attached. Also for 15K I'd be looking at a much better weapon type with all due respect.
---
If you say it then it must be true, we are best friends after all. You comment on all my posts!
---
Turrets eat up ALOT of camp budget, so the only workaround I've found to have a lil more budget is to build a Camp somewhere on the outskirts of the map or the zone with no enemies at all thefore with no need of turrets.
---
No.  You can't solo a SBQ with a mediocro Fixer - LOL !
---
&gt; Lmao 25 reduced vats cost is the best minor legendary effect you can get
---
Yeah - who needs Two Shot Explosive legendaries when you can get what amounts to a serving of corn soup for your Fixer.
---
ROTFLMAO !
---
I'm kinda agree with you. 
---
During this event, I was trying to be nice and tag the legendaries and wendigo boss in the end of the event with my lowest damage pistols; so other people could get a hit too. But guess what happened? There was like 4-5 other people and they took their time to kill the wendigo. And then the wendigo and his ghouls army proceed to kill me. I was dying, asking for help, and nobody wanted to stimpak me. So I respawned the same time as the public event completed. I dropped ALL my junk. Someone stole my junk and left.
---
So in the end of the event, I lost all my junks and only got 1 star legendary from the wendigo.
---
&gt;  been server hoping for days looking for any decent automatic weapon with reduced vats cost 
---
You should know that corn soup, hard lemonade or a variety of other foods will greatly increase your AP regen and have essentially the same effect - and instead of paying 15K caps all you need are some veggies.
---
You occasionally get 4 of something because small ores can be mined sometimes twice. Large ores found as deposits can be mined up to 3 times I think maybe 4.
---
I'm glad we're in agreement.
---
Two shot is primary, explosive is secondary, still waiting for that minor effect.....that means the third star if you can't figure that out.
---
Here's a handy chart to help you out.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a2n39c/this_spreadsheet_shows_which_legendary_effects/
---
WTF are you talking about now??
---
re we even playing the same game?
---
Quad Harpoon, Vampire Gatling.
---
I always repair other players turrets that need it, does that count? “You better come out here or I’m going to do you a favor by repairing your defenses!!!”
---
But you get the recipe from campfire tales and that's basically the only way you can get them. Or if you buy them from other players.
---
Long live John denver
---
Heck, even the note saying that the super mutants are getting riled up by the sounds is still there. So yeah...
---
You can team up and do the Vault94 raids for some decent rewards
---
&gt;  That fixer is better than anything in your inventory 
---
Although I am impressed by your psychic abilities - it's still a mediocre weapon.
---
If I didn't know better (and I don't) I would begin to believe that you or one of your alts latched on to this POS and decided to make this post in hopes you could get some poor schlub to buy the weapon at an exorbitant price.
---
It was easier before public events, but there was sadly a time where possum badges didn't drop because of bug...
---
Thanks. Is there any relationship between the type of armour you wear and how detectable you are?
---
Yeah, more or less. FE is a great combination, that will serve you well basically in any situation. I use VE (non primed) for general PVE activities, it will chew through anything sans the biggest targets; also primed ZE/Z25 for SBs and SBQs and primed EE/E25 for PVP.
---
It spawns Shielded without the need of the previous 3 levels?
---
You realize the fixer has higher base damage than a handmade with the same fire rate, cheaper ammo, and 2 extra legendary effects for free. But please tell me more about how mediocre it is because it isn't bloody. You aren't a clown, you are the entire circus.
---
I'd guess someone fall in love with Appalachia by those numbers.
---
Very nice, Chaos Marine much?  (At least the top part)
---
Gatling Gun is quite economic - if you have Fireproof, you don't even have to worry about close range explosions with it. The speedy receiver is great but the prime is too slow for my taste so I'd recommend priming an FFR only.
---
Lately, I use a Primed AAFFR .50 Cal for fighting the queen (22 dmg/headshot, \~11 shots/sec) because many players now tend to do massive damage to her and they won't give you enough time to inflict 1500 damage to get loot. Ammo is expensive to make but is now plentiful (360 - 460 rounds per craft w/ SD on average).
---
As for the legendary effect, AA is perhaps the safest bet (if you aren't bloodied). Next would be one of the versus (Mutant slayer's, Ghoul slayer's) which add bonus damage and thus reduced ammo consumption if you tend to farm their respective enemy types.
---
Man idk, I would like to say it's just bad luck, but surely by now I'd have gotten another reward other than the hat.
---
Just do the Stings and Things and Cleanup dailies. I haven't done a single actual challenge and I have collected well over 25 possum badges by now.
---
Idk but people at one violent night are more likely to be dicks.
---
Yeah, I think I've met a few of them already. Hopefully I'll meet some more as I get further into the game (level 17 right now)
---
Well I've seen the plan selling for 5k-10k at player camps and you can get one on the trade discord for around 15k if you want.
---
If there were any value to fishing if it were implemented there would be duped catfish everywhere.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Nothing like running in to join the fight and finding the fight finished so long ago the corpses have despawned!
---
As a hardcore gamer myself, upon seeing what I would have to do, I said I value my time too much to sacrifice it for something as degaraded, and as such, I haven't unlocked full-sized backpack on any of my 10 characters
---
What console are you on?
---
PC
---
Ah ok I'm ps4.
---
They should have made these sort by of parts behave in the same manner of the Salvaged Assaultron Head, for example, where it remains a salvaged piece of junk until you specifically scrap that part.
---
I think it makes the camp go away also. At least it did a few patches ago
---
Ha, I had this yesterday. The body randomly followed me. I think it was one I had helped kill earlier as it still had some minor loot on it.
---
I’m with you he hasn’t a clue
---
Because for some people the plan IS NOT EASILY ACQUIRED from the quest lol. I'm one of them like someone said above, did it about 20 times since the quest started, successfully, and never get the damn thing.
---
Last night triggered it and died after  imposter regenerated and under half health. The never ending loading screen and had to quit game. 2nd time about the same, but died and fell under map forever. So don't think I really care anymore to have the plan. It's bullshit though that people playing since the fkn game started have these kind of problems but others are getting awesome legendary fixers. Happy for them though...
---
Do you feel better now?
---
Yesterday a guy was creating massive lag with cleavers. I shot them all over with a shotty explosive and he and friends were so mad ahahaha. No mercy and hope i don't find a pile of explosives.
---
I know this to be true the other way around.
---
When I log into a world and the CAMP spot I use is taken I mute and block the player - thus avoiding future 'conflict' and the person's CAMP marker disappears from the map for me so I will go out on a limb and say is probably the same for them.
---
yes!
---
Log out and back in. I had this same issue and logging out to main menu and then back in fixed it.
---
I've tried that on multiple occasions unfortunately
---
No problem, spread the word!
---
Haha !
---
I lost my pet claw too yesterday after a good month.

My camp is close to toxic larry,so unless i kill the snallygaster there everytime,i risk that some low level kite them to my camp. And that happened. Sometime i wish all the old way of pvp were still there.
---
I'll try to deactivate that PoS then.
---
I feel you brother + add bugs that stoping you from completing one (or more) of them
---
do remember the bug your talking about, is the quest marker itself, pointing you to the wrong location. happened also on ' speak to rosie ' , but rosie is nowhere to be found, and the marker is pointing underneath the top of the world. It either sorts itself out, or just go searching. try doing something else, and come back to it. cant quite remember, but yes, part of it does involve obtaining something from the mutants.
---
Mammologist and hunter are easy.
---
Athlete I've not yet done -- hate those obstacle courses.  Swimmer needs someone to help you.
---
Was this re-built from a blueprint you made or from the *stored blueprint* created when moving the camp, the later always remains stoked for me, my own blueprinted vending machines are always empty.
---
A primed B25 .50cal is the best choice if you looking for max damage.
---
Actually the high cap backpack mod gives extra 120 lbs carry weight.  I only use it when I get stuck. Don't have to walk back to camp from Watoga anymore.
---
The quest marker itself is telling me it's on the level of the mezzanine area, but the "go through this door to access area of quest" icon is showing, but there is no door
---
Second one. I never heard of this before and I keep seeing people complaining about having to restock.
---
Oct 15th I believe! :)
---
I kinda agree on the base model fixer, but the purveyor dropped me an Executioner's one recently, I'm actually really impressed with it. I don't do bloodied, and I usually use a AAE handmade, but the increased sneak effect and sneak speed are pretty great. I don't think what he paid was entirely ridiculous. Anyways, it's just caps.
---
O.o ??
---
I've completed the Task solo while accidentally reviving someone while doing an event. It seems that you don't need to be in the same team.
---
I enjoyed them. Apart from being unable to complete chemist due to the rare plasma plan, I've got every badge.
---
It just works!
---
Omg im so glad i logged bk into 76. Whent to whitesprings killed 3 3* legendaries at the cabins got a 3* beserkers shotgun,3* goul slayers combat knife,2* hunters gutar sword just in 1 run no reloading.
---
I can't even get a camera so I can complete most of the badges.
---
Grow up it’s a game not an actual store.
---
been 6 months since i did this, my markers would point me to the lift, always !. went off and did something else, and came back a few days later, and all worked and progressed thru quest.
---
Hmm, maybe I should leave it for a couple days then, sounds plausable, thank you!
---
Get a quad tesla and make him evaporate.
---
oh don't you worry man they have atom shop exclusive skins coming
---
Where did this come from?
---
Well ppl were complaining about How the game isn't hard enough, thats their karma lmao
---
&gt; Quests and Events
---
&gt;
---
&gt;    Bucket List: The Personal Terminal, which can be unlocked for free in the Atomic Shop, now includes an entry that will lead players to the current location of the Tourist corpse.
---
 &gt;       This quality of life improvement will help players more easily begin the Bucket List Quest and obtain a ProSnap Deluxe Camera.
---
OH THANK GOD

---
get a vampire explosive weapon . and you are imortall. use nuka colas as healing have medic pump and born surviver working at the same time with stimpacks and super stims. you dont die in pvp or pve. this build is for both.
---
And you have no caps
---
You seem to be getting madder and madder about this.  You seem... pretty invested in it.
---
Go delete more posts, your mommy might see
---
Maybe wastelanders will bring more challenge for higher level players
---
You know that you can farm legendaries if you don’t play the jukebox and instruments all the time. The more music is played the faster the wendigo comes and less ghoul waves there are in between. People usually mess this up by rushing to the end when you should take your time
---
How do you know the event is about Halloween? They just said there would be an event, no more hints. As far as I read from official news.
---
Sounds like you want to buy it and want to lowball the guy. This gun easily falls into the "trade only" category when put on the markets.
---
I'm a player that used to frequently do this and just quickly killed all the enemies. It wasn't me being rude it was just me killing the enemies because they're usually always super aggro on me. Every single time I stop to let a person or two get a hit, they take forever to attack the enemy as I'm just standing there tanking everything. The problem isn't really people being "too fast," but as an event where everyone works together, we should all just get shared loot and maybe even exp. But for now I just suggest grabbing a tesla rifle and shooting everywhere to make sure you get hits in, what I've recently started doing.
---
"I lost all my junks and only got 1 star legendary from the wendigo". That's a tshirt I would buy lol
---
I kept doing my daily challanges and have had 2 high cap backpack plans
---
You need to do stuff for rose so she trusts you
---
You need to gain her trust before missing like will complete
---
Have you put power to the vendor? if not it won't show on the map, but if people find your CAMP they can still buy the things you sell.
---
When you seel things you'll get a "Cha-ching" and a message in the top right corner advising who and what was sold. And you'll receive 90% of the value added to your caps (The other 10% is Bethseda tax)
---
To have your CAMP undamagable by Player you will to have pacifist on via the game options. (A Play can still Nuke your camp though, so becareful of location)
---
10mm exploding pistol..tag n retreat unless someone's 1 shotting then I sit on the blue pipe with a TSE lever and show them how to 1shot properly
---
They can "steal" crops, water, and items in a resource extractor, but you can put locks on purifiers and extractors if you want. They can't steal anything else. You will get a notification on your screen if someone buys something. You can cancel having an item for sale, and it will simply sit in your stash.
---
1) cap sink systemlike others have said
---
2)  New weapons, legendary effects and perks. Or at a minimum,  major rebalancing what we currently have. Right now everyone seems to run the same builds.... and seek the same exact gear. There is only a limited amount of 3* BE handmades (just an example) with a perfect roll out there ...but everyone wants them...why? Because bloodied stealth rifle is an amazjng powerful build so lots and lots of people are running it. In return since there is such a high demand , seller can ask ludicrous prices and get them. Can't really blame the seller for making as much as they can off a sale can ya?  There needs a larger selection of viable builds that perform on par with each other, not one or two build types that greatly out preform others. This would open up the market for people to seek out different items, lowering the demand for the ones everyone currently wants, helping bring prices back in check.
---
So if you completed the Signal Strength, then you are on Flavours of Mayhem and since you stole something from super  mutant camp, the next objective should be an area leading to feral ghouls.  
---
Check on that and maybe you will be able to proceed. However you should be able to go to Rose's level and you just need to examine the body in the cage for Missing link to complete.
---
Yup! Maybe next week
---
Ewww, you're new to Fallout.
---
I agree they are tedious, but then I've got the high capacity backpack mod twice from doing the challenges because I have 3 characters and want the increased carry weight on them all. They are  somewhat acceptable to do the first time, it's a way to force you to do content, but second and third time? Starts to be a joke. They should add a system so that you can buy it on a second character for free without having to do all the challenges again, just make the plan non tradable and people wont be able to sell it and abuse the fact they got it free.
---
You don't need to play with anyone else.  The "revive a player" bit is easy enough to do at the Encryptid event.
---
They'll most likely release the Halloween stuff with the Halloween event. Hopefully next week!
---
Doesn't need to be an ally.
---
Just do Encryptid and revive any downed player.
---
I only have one outstanding, because of the plasma grenade plan. Been farming battle bot et al but no luck yet.
---
Do you always agree with yourself from alt accounts? And how's that search for str bobbleheads going? Not sure why you want them when they don't stack with any other bobblehead, but I'm sure you have a master plan for your unarmed and str bobblehead combo.
---
Hell I enjoy the world so much I’m not even really progressing the game much.  I’m enjoying just kinda living and surviving in the world. I’ve become a moonshiner. I sell my wares so I can buy plans to improve my bar/brewery.
---
I’ve never been able to successfully blueprint my camp.
---
What platform you on?
---
First you write that you put some crappy items in the vendor and later expect us to come and buy your stuff? Really? Lately I leveled my alt and only after that I've build a vendor. Only one, since I didn't want to put crappy items and waste people caps to fast travel to such vendors. Respect peoples' time and caps and build vendor when you'll really have something worth fast travel...
---
I did not see that coming
---
Don't sell magazines, bobbleheads, 5.56 ammo and aluminium/lead/ultracite without actually understanding the market for them my man. for example lockpick bobblehead is a novelty item while unarmed bobblehead is V94 raiders' best friend (one is worth 50 caps other 400), or lead can easily move if priced 3 caps per piece (I see many fellers price it for 1 caps)
---
This is The definition of a dad joke
---
This is the beauty of bloodied builds, you can just run full health and the weapons damage turns back to normal. 
---
But people don't seem to do it for whatever reason.
---
I agree with OP. But I did them anyway. Because I have a problem.
---
The only one I don't have is chemist. Because plasma grenade plans. Which you don't even make at a chem bench. FFS!
---
My favourite is the church full of skeletons with glasses and a big empty pitcher, and the back room full of rat poison.
---
Try earbuds or earphones
---
Radshield, diluted radx, and a glowing blood pack I get no additional rads. Dodgy serendipity, and blocker help with melee attacks, and the green piss she drops during her strafing passes are easily advoided buy running and jumping away.
---
Count me in. You got me on psn already
---
I’ll join, PSN: kappers_1
---
At least there was a warning, and no sudden disconnect. It feels like the shutdowns are getting more controlled in the last days.
---
Damm wish you were on PS4 I'm a master trapper with over 1000kills and 100k+ junk from player's falling from my cliff trap bases on all five characters, I have cannibal equiped so I can eat them before people can stimpak them when they fall and go to there knees haha I would love to teach and get more of us out there especially with wastelanders coming out because we're so out numbered with people calling us griefers. But it wouldn't be a fallout without Raiders. ROSE WOULD BE SO PROUD.
---
Been playing since FO3 but never used anything to pacify animals except a bunch of hot lead.
---
Hey mate, I'm not really into that ranking shennanigans, but I do like taking workshops, building weird shit in them and fighting for them. Do you have a discord group?
---
I hear the curator at Fort Prickett found the remains of another solider and could use your help burying it in the graveyard.
---
And more important: Make an announcement, that the "lost complete inventory" bug is found and solved. Thats why most people just don't go in there at all. My whole team is still not doing it, since there is no official note about fixes. The statement they made "we improved something, hope this might help" is no fix. 
---
Tell me if I'm wrong, I'd really like to do the raids again.
---
Just tried fighting some Scorchbeasts and died fast. Waited for green mist, I don't have a problem killing them with bloodied Handmade if before they gas bomb.
---
This is not to do with SBQ, I don't do nuke zones... yet.
---
Standard leather armor.
---
Chest dense 25% Poison rst, Right arm 25% poison rst
---
Fireproof 3, Dodgy 3, Lonewanderer 4, Serendipity 3
---
So you must be absolutely correct, NOT poison, rads then and my rad resits was **5** LOL
---
As a bloodied build I have no buffer to manage such damage, I'll have to avoid the gas or go power armor or chug chems.
---
Thanks for your help!
---
It only works if they're not using pacifism, which most people who lock crafting sections are too braindead to realize even exists.
---
If they are using pacifism, it's just a hard nope on their vending machines. I don't care if they're filled with 5-star legendaries for 5 caps apiece, you're a bad person and deserve nothing if you won't even let people use workbenches.
---
Hide Owned / Show only Owned  
---
This would be a blessing &lt;3
---
hot
---
Go to a train station and read the posters.
---
Not poison, still died fast with 50% poison resist, could not stim fast enough. Must be rads as my radiation resist in leather armor is only **5**.
---
Will try again while under the influence of some chems.
---
xbox1
---
Just curious, steal what stuff?  I leave my door wide open.  I do lock my junk collector (that's why I live there...) but everything else is open to the public.   Other than resources, I can't think of anything I need to lock out.
---
Same here. Possum badges are rarer than cryptids.
---
Oh man...i had 5000 5.56 disappear last night as well.
---
Train Station Mosaic Floor.. makes me cry everytime i see it in another’s Camp :’(
---
I have a Yamaha 5.1 dobly surrounded system hooked up to my Xbox and the game sounds incredible. But when hooked up earbuds to my controller the sounds were mind blasting.
---
I only did them to get the cute possum scout uniform
---
and even worse if you want a second character it's all over again
---
I would pull out my hair but I don't have any, you could indeed have a point, I just died from green mist and my health *what I have of it* dropped like a stone but rads did not increase. I did not take that into consideration, with 50% poison armor resist the only other thing must be energy.
---
Energy damage from green fog? Really weird. But my energy resist is quite high.
---
Leather Armor resists - Dmg 237 - Poison 50 - Energy 419 - Rads 5
---
Corvega Backpack.
---
In more colours, like Black.
---
Still died fast with 50% poison resist. Rad did not increase, but health plummeted.
---
This is the yellow with black accents one? If so yeah, I'd like it too.
---
I should get another high capacity backpack soon if you wanna trade for it. I’ll be posting it later tonight if I get another badge.
---
Acid, what damage type is that? Physical damage would be nothing like the others.
---
Hmm. I know when I get poisoned from stuff it puts a green glow over my character so that’s a way to double check it for poison. Maybe take a quick clip so you can look at it more closely.
---
&gt;...what would there be left to do?
---
Literally everything in the world. I love playing games, but the things that require an intense amount of time are a real drag. The game has cool stuff. I paid for the game. Give me the cool stuff that I paid for. Of course a lot of the fun is the pay-off of meeting challenges, but the challenges need to be accessible to people who aren’t playing for several hours every day. There’s a difference between keeping things interesting and busy work. I get enough fucking busy work every goddamned day of my life. When I play a game, I’m here for the fun.
---
Me either, not the first possum badge. I still wear my scout uniform. My real life Eagle Scout was easier than the first level possum badges.
---
Swimmer, just post on here that you need someone to help or randomly message someone in your world. Never had an issue getting someone to help
---
Can't be, another comment states rads don't increase and I confirm I died as health dropped but rads did not increase.
---
Maybe acid as someone states here, what can we wear to resist acid? I'm in full leather.
---
I keep a stockpile in my stash so when I’m ready I just pull out what I need and fast travel. Activate and complete without going anywhere.
---
&gt;I play with my wife and a bunch of others who don't cry over people using the gear they want.
---
He DID say he plays with folks who don't mind him using the armor.
---
And it does seem odd to blame the player for a game glitch...
---
My leather armor gives me,
---
Dmg 237 - Poison 50 - Energy 419 - Rads 5
---
Just died from the green fog, my health dropped like a stone but rads remained the same so it may well be some hybrid ballistic. I really wish someone could data mine, I have no idea if that is even possible.
---
Server hop and do campfire tales repeatedly, that's what I did for my high capacity plan, you also have a legendary at the end.
---
Nothing more annoying than sneaking about and hearing that damn hissing noise of you "buddy box" appearing behind you
---
Agreed, I almost killed someone's deathclaw today. There's no indication that it's a tamed creature! I thought I'd be doing them a favour by killing the deathclaw in the middle of their camp.
---
It's not for you its for whales.  That's the freemium model. Otherwise it would be a subscription model.  They don't care for you guppy.
---
Rather have Halloween stuff obtainable as rewards for a Halloween event, not everything should be on the atom shop.
---
It's a heavy metal wet dream.
---
People... My trap base has over 1000+ player kills and 100k+ junk from them. Raider life 😂😂
---
Rose will be so proud.
---
I have absolutely no shortage of money. One reason for that  is I don't like to spend them where there is no value. And 8 dollars from a fallout 4 outfit I already own is no value.
---
I keep my scavenging bot and my resource collector locked in a room. Now they need a passcode to get in so the survivor whores that are in adventure don't have any locks to pick because they need to guess my passcode now. If they can guess the passcode then I won't even be upset they got in.
---
If you want I can add shielded to your brotherhood under armour? Just bring me the materials as I'm low on all of them: 11 ballistic fibre, 15 nuclear material and 4 pure violet flux.
---
I've been playing for a whole lot of hours and i have never received a possum badge from those repeatable quests. I've given up.
---
&gt;Train Station Mosaic Floor
---
I had to look this one up, now I want it... :sobs:
---
I mean yeah, I get it. I dont even have doors lol, but how are you gonna tell someone else how to set up their home? It's their camp, we're just visiting there. Another thing, I've never seen anyone destroy anything if they arent engaged in pvp with that player. Still not sure how you are doing that, but it's a good way to get capped quick lol.
---
dont have any violet rn :(
---
You dont have to. If you reset it down it happens automatically.
---
My bad the quest will be completed after you complete the whole chain.
---
That's the spirit. Wish you were on PC!
---
Nope, nothing at the moment. Just been curious if any other raiders out there looking to group up.
---
How do you know he speaks for everyone? I don't believe for one second that his "friends" are happy with the lag from his armor. I play with the Fever Clan discord group, look us up we have thousands of members across multiple games. I know plenty of people with that armor and it's a douche move to use it at the queen.
---
Put it this way, it's not my fault that meat hooks are bugged so they use one handed and unarmed perks at the same time, so they can do incredible damage and let me solo the queen before most people do enough damage to even register and get credit. 
---
I could go around robbing people of credit for the queen. Should I? I love my meat hook, I should be using it, right? Seems odd to blame the player...
---
People with maturity don't screw over the people around them.
---
i Carry a shit weapon to plink but its hard to switch from fully radiated to fullhealth and back. We dont carry toxic goo or much rads with us. its a pain to do.
---
Worse then shooting down vertibots for nuclear keycards? I think not ;)
---
Arent you cool with your "lack of money shortage" flex.  You may not determine it to be affordable and thats okay.The people that decide it's affordable buy it and Bethesda continues to function as a business.  You don't get to dictate market prices as the consumer.  It's a freemium model that targets whales not the average consumer.  Why would you be upset that it's a bad value if you could afford it ya know ?
---
What daily ?
---
I'm a lone wanderer. I can confirm the game is fine solo. There is only a handful of multiplayer stuff but it's fairly avoidable and some of it naturally connects you with other people anyway. I've never struggled with being a lone wanderer in fallout 76
---
LOL !
---
You're an alt account of someone trying to sell that POS aren't you ?
---
I managed to do it solo this morning, at level 44 thanks to a shitload of stimpacks and  a nuclear keycard given to be by  a friendly high level. Launched the nuke from silo Alpha at Fissure Site Prime. Had a nice turn up for the ScorchBeast Queen and took her down as well.
---
So now I'm out of Main and side missions. What do most people do at this point? Cause i see people running around being level 200+, how did they get to be so high a level?
---
What gun do you use?
---
You're welcome !
---
Try adding in that rad resist perk card as high as you can go and see what happens.
---
Strange brew. It’s the one that says visit the giant teapot.
---
I had the travel bug last night. I went to join the SBQ event from Charleston Station. I had to join the event since a lower level center nuked Prime (PA Heavy gunner isn't scared of rads). 
---
I was sent to that Wolf event in the Forest.
---
Thinking back Charleston and the Ash Heap are places that the travel bug has happened at other times.
---
Yeah... I'm not having a conversation with you.  Good luck selling that crappy gun tho ...
---
You've been replying to me for hours, now you get shy? I thought you knew how to "work the market"? Cmon let's hear what epic loot you have since AA fixers aren't good enough for you.
---
Also go into the Atom Shop, pick up the Personal Terminal (should be free) and build one in your camp. The terminal and the posters should direct you to most of the new content.
---
Divide two numbers then multiply by 100.    It was someone’s job at BGS to get this correct.    
---
And we wonder why we get red tires in the atom shop, the Mayor wanting us to bury a person every time we log on and a constant ebb and flow of weapon buffs/de-buffs and legendary drop changes.    (I can’t blame the Random gods any longer).
---
SMH.   
---
To OP:   Nice catch and callout!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Ok, that answers it. Not the first time I thought the wrong thing lol.
---
This. They already said there is going to be a Halloween event
---
I have done this quest maybe... Hmmm... 150 times now?
---
If you want the light raider armor plans is the way to go, create character, finish quest, delete character, rinse, repeat until you get them.
---
In my experience when this 'leg' of the quest bugs is either the chest in the basement of the main administrative building in the National Isolated Radio Array or the chest in the shack in Safe'n Clean Disposal, North of The Whitesprings.
---
I usually visit the latter first becuase there are only 4 SMs there in al small space so is a 30 second job to check.
---
Uranium fever isn't worth the hassle, I mean its level 35 drops. If it was the old way then yeah, but having to fight through a crowd to tag is a definite no.
---
This would be awesome if it was you, I don’t get to play much anymore, so a huge thank you for giving me a good moment that night :) it’s moments like this that make it a great game, bugs and all
---
Good idea, I'll do that next time I fight a SB, sure to get this sorted eventually.
---
To raid the raider
---
If they don't have pacifism on and you turn it off, you can destroy their CAMP items. The bounty you get is nowhere near as much as the fluxes it costs to repair a decon arch.
---
Or just kill their pet. You should REALLY know better than to lock your crafting area if you're trying to keep a pet.
---
Survival mode has been shut down, blocking access to crafting areas is just an inconvenience to other people now. If I see a CAMP icon on my compass and start heading towards it, it's usually because I'm expecting to find a workbench to scrap junk and a cooking station to cook my raw meat. People are probably not walking to your CAMP to shop 90% of the time, remove your vending machines if you wanna lock your doors.
---
Translation: why are you taking bone shards for free when you can buy them in my vendors for one cap each
---
25% reduced vats cost on a combat rifle is VERY bland. Automatic combat rifle (fixer is combat rifle) vats cost is 5AP per shot... Reducing it by 1 is great to you? Don't talk when you obviously don't know NOTHING about game mechanics, you just make yourself look like an idiot. Also did i say somewhere that i don't know about fixer being better than handmade?
---
It was mine!
---
I trap people in my camp and kill them when they do this.
---
Well do hit me up if you're up to something. Also discord;  *mylkoo#9849*
---
Name a better effect lmao. 15% reload? Reduced weight? 50 defense while aiming? I already linked the full table of possible effects and 25% less vats cost is top tier.
---
Don't they go bad?
---
This should be the only reply to these kind of posts
---
If something can be stolen there's always someone to steal it that's life
---
Mine died from climbing a power pilon and then jumping off a week later!
---
Well on the bright side these quests are optional, and if you are able to slog your way through enough shit the rewards are kinda worth it
---
I love checking these machines for goodies like this but have never found anything this nice.
---
I managed to get the robot legs while treasure map hunting (I think, either that or random drop). I was going to farm harpers for them, but I found them before I felt like farming that place. 
---
I, like everyone else, don't have the plasma plans.
---
Worked for me at:
---
Berkeley springa
---
Abandoned bog town
---
Mega stop
---
Giant tea pot
---
Grafton super duper
---
She freaks out if you actually succeed in pacifying that one!
---
You're missing the most important Heavy Gunner perk: Stabilized. Multiplies per-shot damage threefold against sbq
---
I do sort of hope they add the ability to have companions. However they would need to balance them slightly. Instead of getting a specific character you would get some random Joe and you have to try and guess their name. if it's a name they can't pronounce then obviously they would just stay named as "companion". The storyline permits could simply be that they wish to follow you around to learn how to survive in the wasteland. Your human companions can also where in the atomic shop apparel you happen to have purchased. It would be worn over top of any armor like it would be on your player.
---
also sometime in the future I would love it if you could build your own robot companion, what's custom atomic shop paint jobs.
---
As for my perspective of does the game need human NPCs. I do kind of agree that the wasteland itself is kind of dull with just generic scorched enemies that say the same lines over and over again it would be nice to have some variants sure they eat human NPCs will probably act similar but just new voice lines in general would spice it up a little bit. it would also be cool to see how the scorched end up turning a human someone who isn't vaccinated against the scourge plague that's kind of something I'm looking forward to a little bit.
---
TL DR, maybe the game does not need human NPCs but I would like to see it anyway
---
The Vualt Boy and Girl power armour helmets. I saw them when I went to bed and woke up and poof! There gone
---
Don't look at me!!! Lol
---
First of all, I'm sure between your 35 years and my 35 years playing games we've had worse. Memories are short and games used to be shit hard and very buggy in the 80s. Remember some of the shit we paid for? These days there'd be a class action lawsuit against some of those software companies.  
---
But apart from that even the main quests are a massive pain in the arse. Trying to complete them for the second time round reminded me why I almost quite the game before I'd started. If the devs playtest the game it's on a test server with no lag FFS.
---
Case in point: Camp McClintock.

They somehow shoehorned a timed assault course into a laggy, buggy game that is impossible to complete if there are more than 3 people on your server at the same time. You have activate the buttons, wait for the server to respond. Click again and hopefully get it to clear before you are allowed to move on. By which time the fucking timer has expired.
---
Then the damn targets don't activate in the marksmanship section. No enemies spawn in the final 'challenge'. And what should be a test of your character's training is instead a test of your resolve and perseverance with a truly terrible game experience.  
---
The whole badges crap I swerved, I'd rather just manage my weight efficiently or just dump everything on an alt account or two.
---
EDIT: Got the quests confused, Signal Strength with Flavours of Mayhem which is what this 'subquest' is tied to; it all blurs into one in my mind.
---
Still, I might have done it at least 20 times with my various alts so the following still applies.
---
I usually visit the latter first becuase there are only 4 SMs there in a small space so is a 30 second job to check.
---
If you're on the super mutant part of Flavours of Mayhem, there is only a limited number of locations where Rose might send you, because the place must be somewhere that always has super mutants.  [Relay tower HN-B1-12](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Relay_tower_HN-B1-12), [Summersville](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Summersville), [WV Lumber Co.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/WV_Lumber_Co.), or [New Gad](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/New_Gad) are some of the likelier candidates. You might want to check those out and see if looting the final chest in each of those places doesn't advance the quest.
---
Happened to me once, I got the server shut down notice a couple minutes after launching.
---
I wish there was at least a 1 hour notice
---
Sure, of course. Did you just learn what sarcasm means?
---
"You're really starting to piss me off"
---
Jesus dude, chill! It's a fucking GAME!
---
Only the radaroach meat spoils but there is always one around Dolly Sods.
---
I see what you are getting at..... I've found as a heavy gunner....... Any Gatling backed with a Vampire's MG42 is unstoppable as long as you have the ammo and weapon artisan.  Gats are 'slow' comparet to other automatic weapons, but each bullet is a hit to the mouth.  This is the closest to 'world of tanks' I've had.  Just trundle through WesTek, thunk, thunk, thunk an then swap out to the MG as a stimpack while moving through the place.  MG is an ammo  hog, but super fun to use.
---
In my personal opinion, the only ammo worth converting into ultracite is that of plasma cores and fusion cores. plasma course because they do scale upwards with your intelligence so I can craft ultracite plasma cores with 350 shots instead of 250. ultracite fusion cores in back that you can use power user to double their capacity from 500 to 1000.
---
Your terrible attempt at drawn out sarcasm aside, they arn't being intentionally mean in order to make it frustrating for you to build your oversized mega fort. 
---
I'm sure if they could they would push up the budget in a second. But what is that going to do for the performance issues that the game already has. 
---
Would you like to work in the current conditions where you can actually stuff quit a bit of stuff in, or would you like to work with nothing because the game crashes every 17 seconds from that guy who insisted he needed a thousand plushy dolls and teddy bears in his CAMP?
---
How are you able to do this?
---
I hear you, i'm happy that they introduced the small standard backpack so i can have one.
---
Since i can't use mic and talk with others i play mostly alone and i can't do the "resurrect someone" thing since i can't communicate with anyone to ask for help, tried to ress someone during event but had no luck lol, too many ppl around everytime.
---
It's a shame cause i can't even buy anything backpack related (i love the nuka cola one) from the store since i can't use those on my small one lol
---
To be honest i still have to try those things that you are saying but i fear them.
---
Anyway i'm managing to have fun in other way, i love this game and i'm trying to do alternative things that i can lonely :D
---
Oh, is that the only part? Damn, I should stock up and grind that. Damn! Thanks for the idea!
---
There should also be an indicator on the pet that names the owner of the pet as well. Occasionally if you are still loading the camp in (not sure if it is you loading the camp or if the camp is just new to the server) the pet won't have the owner tag and can be damaged even if pacifist is enabled. I have tested this by hurting my own deathclaw as soon as I load into the game. I can vats him and deal damage to him until he gets my owner tag onto him.
---
Really good points. Us who have endgamed long ago are wanting new no matter what it is. Unless I have to will not have a NPC companion. In Skyrim it was nice at first but hearing the same dialogue over and over ruined that. And let’s face facts, Bethesda can’t give them hundreds of hours of dialogue to make us content. On the other hand being able to protect a family fresh out of a vault settle in and build a settlement is the type of thing that I look forward to. The possibility’s are endless. The robot companion would have to have a voice shut off for me, the scrapbot has left me crazy until I got rid of him. Many ways to look at it.
---
Also whenever the atom shop fails to load, you end up playing with no emotes!
---
I lost my pet Deathclaw yesterday as well. I logged in and he was nowhere to be found.
---
Oh my God lol :D
---
Lock the doors with a rank zero lock when they come in. Design your camp with no other exists. Lol. I’ve actually made junk this way. My camp is a giant raider skull. I don’t do it to everyone, just the people who take my bone shards.
---
\&gt;   I don’t have the budget to replace them 
---
Then don't build them. Same goes for everything that another player can destroy, like veggies or the brahmin.
---
As for the why... Because they can, as simple as that.
---
It states it must be Red Rocket Stations, not train stations. I was able to get 5 photos, but only worked with the exact 5 out of the whole list (2 were different than for bj-hill86). So it's doable, but still broken ;)
---
References like this totally break my sense of submersion.
---
I do this with legendaries but if I tag a group of ghouls that runs in I'm not gonna let them irradiate me, hurt my armor, ruin my vanguards effect with said radiation, and possibly drop me so everyone can tag them.
---
That’s the first thing I do when I log on with both my characters. The plans sell/trade very well
---
They're slow with updating. We're probably at 22-25 million right now if not higher.
---
I believe you must have animal freind at max rank in order to tame animals, wasteland whisperer just add more animals to the pool of tameable creatures. If you want to be on the safe side you should have both perks fully maxed out and make sure you are over half the level of the creature you are trying to tame.
---
 You also cannot tame just any creature, it has to be a specific creature that spawns at designated random encounter locations on the map. You can look up where these locations are. Specifically you are looking for scene type random encounters.
---
Just some more info on animal friend and wasteland whisperer, animal freind allows you to tame animals like cats, dogs, wolves, possums, rats, and brahmin.
---
Wasteland whisperer allows you to tame megasloth, deathclaws, and snallygaster.
---
You can also tame mirelurk but I am not sure which perk they fall under, in fact these lists may be in accurate, but they are what I have seen from countless testing and searching for rare pets.
---
Nuka girl rocket suit
---
Ok you lock them in, but how do you kill them?
---
Ah yes, your personal Companion Cube!
---
I've eaten the feral
---
ghoul
---
They’re really not that bad. I’ve gotten about 23 of them through the challenges, Campfire Tales, Stings n’ Things, and Operation Tidy. I bought two high capacity and traded one, an armor plated, and the Possum scout uniform.
---
If you ever need help let me know. I couldn’t have done all these things without my brother and some decent google-fu!
---
There is. Perk card that starts with a P under intelligence that doubles all usage of cores. Its not the crafting but the usage. I forgot the name but that is what was doing that.
---
I get the same issue. It only seems to update every couple days for me. It's quite frustrating lol
---
I just instantly saw something waaaaaay off, and then when I really started reading, OMG they were all fucked up.
---
It's not some important mistake but they say it's the little things that shows, and it's funny as fuck to think they got elementary math wrong lol
---
When they pick the lock it makes them wanted. Do make the lock rank 0. People can’t resist
---
Its so bloody difficult to get these to pop. Im standing at all different angles next to these stops but nothing
---
Cause event's already in the game, and everything's known about it. You just need to know where to look.
---
Spoiler alert:
---
It takes place in Whitesprings, and revolves around vandalising the place. Taging walls, blowing up cars, destroying robots, and forking up lawns. You have to wear costumes while doing it, and I think it's called Night of Mischief or something like that.
---
When was I ever dictating anything?
---
Also in the context of atom store pricing there is no thing as market price. Bethesda has monopoly over Atom store items (duh I know) and are therefore price makers. Also don't go calling strangers on the internet broke and then complain about them "FLEXING"  not being broken.
---
Tag it from the crafting menu. Try crafting a Cryolator and you can tag for search from there.
---
So you’re saying the reason grenade launchers are in the game is for taking out either hackers or people who are simply better at aiming than you? Lol seems like a good thing to have in a competitive game mode
---
Power User.
---
ESO also came out 7 years ago.
---
I’ve burned though 4K scrip and not a single fixer.
---
Every Character you have can have 30K. So if they have 5 Characters that's 150K. If they have a family account on Xbox or PS4 then they can have even more quite easily.
---
Not one person has commented “I disagree. Grenade launchers DO take skill to use.” Everyone knows they’re cheap.
---
You mean fourteen bucks for a pretty power armour skin is a bit too much?
---
Floors..mostly the yellow and black tiled.
---
Get a low level Tesla you can easily tag all the mobs and not kill them.
---
We can dream... Bethesda might up the chance. Someday. Or maybe duper’s can make it easier. At this point, I don’t even care. Just want my last badge done. Worked my ass off for it.
---
I love all the sirens and car alarms going on near Watoga. Like, wha?
---
Not if you uninstall the game.
---
This is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever heard.
---
Ahhh...I did that one a while ago. That really sucks!!
---
The ones in my vendor aren’t there as the result of hours of careful building...?
---
Keep an Assaultron head. You can build your rads back up without having a lot of stuff on you.
---
Touché. 👌
---
Agreed I hate the new event system. Ecerytging is too crowded and the event spawn rate is too low.
---
Basically, people suck. 🙃
---
That's exactly why a carry a 10mm Pistol on me
---
Sale
---
you can have up to 5 toons, simply transfer your caps to and other character and you have room for more caps. 
---
ppl do the same with stuff, if you want to load some weigth use a 2nd character to free some stash space as well.
---
Plus weekends have higher rates
---
Cool idea but I'm at work :/

This is the Heavy weapon Power Armor build I primarily run. It mainly focuses on furious Gatling gun,flamer,cryolator, and 50cal
---
It makes perfect sense. They aren't going to invalidate a huge questline by allowing players to sell bags to each other.
---
Of course use it on sale, you'll be able to gain 1000 per character at least twice before DLC will be released.
---
The High Capacity Backpack isn't all I hoped it would be, I have renamed mine to "Rad Death Backpack", it's for Emergency use only, and unequipped as soon as I get where I'm going, in case you didn't know, it reduces your rad resistance significantly.
---
Haha
---
why dont they just fast travel?
---
I’m not sure. I don’t think there’s a legendary effect / armor mod that protects against acid, but I could be wrong
---
Someone did this to me also. I don’t even know why they can be disarmed. It’s not like they actually make you hostile or anything. They are mainly decoration.
---
I'd suggest that you not even walk through a workshop zone while carrying junk. You don't have to have it claimed for someone to use it to initiate pvp. If you're in the area then the other person can start claiming it and kill you without you even attempting to claim it
---
It could be an NPC like Ma'iq The Liar, whom directly references everything the game community gets angry about before release. He's in all the Elder Scrolls games starting with Morrowind. You'll even find him in the MMO.
---
Spend it on the sale! I'm certain you can max out your scrip again before wastelanders! Good luck!
---
Ok so the stupid ones die while the smart ones fast travel away. I understand now.
---
Befriending is pretty easy, if you have the wasteland whisperer and animal freind perks you can attempt to pacify them by aiming at them and following the prompt the game gives you to pacify yhem. Taming animals is a whole other thing. 
---
To have the best chance at taming an animal, you should have a fully maxed out animal freind, adding on a fully ranked wasteland whisperer should give you a larger variety of tameable creatures. You should also be over twice the level of the creature being tamed, this is usually not a problem as the strongest tameable animal is the mirelurk king who has a level of around 30, deathclaws will only be level 21 and most smaller pets like cats, dogs, rats, possums, and brahmin are below level 10 I believe. There have also been reports that charisma affects the types of charisma, but I have 8 charisma and haven't seen any issues with taming. You will also need an appropriate amount of camp budget to accommodate your pet, my experience puts it at around 10% of your camps budget. You can also only tame one pet at a time, any new pet will override your current one. 
---
To find a tameable creature you will have to visit as many scene type random encounters until you find a lone animal that is much lower in levdl than than is typical of the species and is behaving very different from typical members of its species. For example, prey species sitting still/ patrolling an area and predator species being weirdly nonviolent.
---
Once you find one you should be able to aim at the creature with a ranged weapon and you will get two prompts, pacify and tame. If you only get the pacify option you either do not meet the requirements to tame the creature or it is not a tameable creature. You should also be able to walk up to the creature and the tame prompt should appear.
---
Once your pet is tamed it will immediately start running towards your camp. You have several options at this point, follow your pet and defend it on its way home, or fast travel away and hope all the enimies near it despawn so that it can make its way to your camp safely. 
---
I personally prefer the second option, I make sure there are no players nearby and fast travel far enough away the the cell should unload all the enemies, then I wait around for a while before fast traveling back to my base. I have only tamed creatures that can fight back reasonably well (deathclaws and wolves) so your mileage may vary.
---
It's a joke based on the name of the game.
---
How much is the max? I’m still new.
---
Not normal to get disconnected constantly. How is your connection? Are you hardwired? Do you have any issues with your ISP? Is your hardware up to minimum spec?
---
25 crashes? That’s not normal.
---
Two nights ago me and a buddy played about an hours worth of pvp with 4 other people. It was so much fun. Levels ranging from 68 to 238. My character is only 123 and my buddy just hit 61. It honestly was the most fun I’ve had in over 1000hrs of playing this game. It was my first pvp experience and I loved it.
---
Glad you liked it :) I’m getting pretty old too ;)
---
Haha that’s a great question
---
I am hardwired. 100mbps down and 10 up. Done have any other issues with connecting to other games. I thought it might have to do with graphic  settings and things not loading fast enough...but I have a 1080 and 16gb ram...so i dunno.
---
1000
---
Also others can take stuff from it if you don't lock it. Just like the water purifiers.
---
You just have to pick the easiest challenges. Photographer is the easiest. Then Archaeologist, Musician, Gardener, Rail Enthusiast, Miner, Backpacker, and Atomics Fan...
---
Collector is good if you already have all of the Unstoppables magazines, which apparently are the most difficult mags to find. I have almost 100 mags from Pannapictagraphist and I still haven't found issues 3 &amp; 5... The rest of those badge challenges are simple though.
---
The leather, metal and robot challenges are good if you already have plans to craft full sets of armor for all of those.
---
Don't even try for Electrician and Chemist as the game doesn't register for the Electrician challenge when you power up any of the power plants and the Syringer challenge for chemist is bugged as well.
---
Side note:  I've done both of the Pioneer Scouts daily events every day since the patch that allegedly fixed the issue with them not giving badges... Haven't received a badge once.
---
Agreed give pets and the Cow either essential status or make it so we can repair them back into living since hunting a pet down is a lot a work especially if you one scorch beast attack from losing it. Also when becomes covered in acid attack the beast is lost and becomes scorched.
---
Exactly, most of the smart people are nice enough to not disarm the chimes though.
---
They should have known this would have been an issue, and known the solution, as other games have to deal with it as well. Guild Wars 2 is nothing but public events and it handles large crowds nicely by scaling enemies up to match the expected damage output of the crowd. It feels like none of the developers have played an online game before, despite some of the people at the top having developed MMOs.
---
Honestly I never even check mine. It’s essentially cosmetic. If people want to help themselves to the scrap they should
---
Every time I go somewhere all of the enemies kill themselves. I was at Toxic Larry’s and all three of the glowing snallygasters killed them selves
---
There should be a small indicator nex to their health bar stating who owns them, similar to turrets found at camps. This indicator should always show up but I have had it delayed in showing up when I load into a new server.
---
I also believe that you can not hurt the pet if the owner is in pacifist mode, I have had multiple people attack my deathclaw and nothing happens although I have been able to hurt my own deathclaw if I am fast enough when I initially join a server.
---
bulk is good for lead and aluminium, it reduces the weight, I would bulk everything else just for selling it, no weigth reduction.
---
wow i dont understand i got mine ages ago, it was one hell of a grind but i did it, infact we helped another friend do his. its hard... its meant to be otherwise we all would be running around with them on
---
i found taking the picture of the price sign (similar to what you can place in camps) managed to trigger the challenge
---
My friend has 2500 hours lol
---
I thought when you block it’s only for session, like the time you’re logged in, is it permanent now?
---
The globe with the explosions. I didn’t start playing until a month ago or I would have bought it first day I played.
---
Yeah thx. I ended up getting them using those mentioned earlier. I couldnt get sutton to pop
---
...the soldier, that is. Not the curator.
---
I once fast traveled to whitespring train station and had all 6 scorchbeasts I had killed while at my camp spawn around me. They travel in flocks.
---
Yeah only problem is when you’re a level 30 being mini nuked by a party of 3 with power armor.
---
I pay respects for your lost pet.
---
Now you have to try and find a replacement and I don't envy you. Maybe you'll find a glowing legendary this time, or you'll just have to make due with a boring level 21 deathclaw. I wish you the best of luck in you endeavors.
---
I myself have been on the lookout for tameable albino or chameleon deathclaws, but they may have disabled variants for those specific spawns, at least when a creature goes legendary it can morph into either a scorched or glowing variant.
---
It always has. But that doesn't mean that base weapons with no mods are better for VATS just because they are lighter. Craft a level 4 10mm, mod it and run your own tests to find the sweet spot.
---
As long as it’s an option you can toggle, I don’t mind, but I’d really rather not see a bunch of dongs.
---
Yes
---
Ok, I just found the strangest fix. It looks like my front panel USB jacks are going. I ran a Windows calibration and noticed that all three controllers were showing some Y axis drift. On a hunch, I moved them to a different port, and the drift went away.
---
Here's the thing. It wasn't a significant level even in the config utility. Y axis was slightly higher and less stable. Most games don't notice it at all.
---
So why does Fallout? What is wrong with the controller sensitivity in this game, specifically, that it's that touchy?
---
Rose asked me to do it.
---
In the social menu you have both options; block for session and block.
---
lol you are something special.
---
Yes. It spawns as shielded.
---
took me 8 hrs but yes i got the witch costume and hat as well as the skeleton costume....they still spawn its just a rare one
---
The piles are there because of how the glitch is done. Basically you trick the game so that you can toss out a thrown item and it'll dupe it everytime you try to pick it back up. Each time you attempt to pick up the originally thrown item up it spawns a new one. So people set up the glitch and just so the hell out of it then collect what they want and probably hop servers once they feel they have enough. It really stresses the servers when you spawn that many items so hoping servers after would be the smart move since it can crash the server. I don't really see a point to doing it though. From what I understand the best scrap you can get is steel and wood. Both of which are super easy to farm ridiculous amounts of. A few weeks ago I farmed up 15k steel in about an hour and I'll be needing to do that again soon because I'm running a bit low on ammo
---
I’m terrified I could never get it back in the same place: it’s on a hill between a few trees with outposts on ledges separated from the main plot.
---
What they really need is not to blueprint the connections, but the actual pixel-perfect placement and rotation angle.
---
Let us fully template the exact condition of the camp with guaranteed ability to re-place exactly as it was.
---
People take em? I'm too busy walking through them over and over just to be noisy.
---
When you make the machine part of a blueprint, it saves everything inside them. Best trick is to mount them on  foundations or add signs to them.
---
These PvP griefers will ensure the full removal of PvP from the game outside of NW soon enough.  Survival mode is dead and with NPCs incoming, the timing has come to remove garbage PvP completely from the adventure world.
---
I would be interested as well. Ps4
---
Thanks....good to know it still shows up at least, rare or not!
---
In passive the only thing they could do is kite something to your camp.

I'll be on in about 3hrs and I'm happy to tag along with you. What level are you?

You have to find a new one in works, if you have more than one in inventory it is broken and will not restart quest.  You can always finds some in the White springs bunker in the desks in command.
---
My camp is in the Forest.  
---
Walking home one evening, I saw the SB sonic cones way up the road.  Though they were attacking Monongah.

 When I got to camp...not much of anything left.  A nearby player told me it was a pair of L80 SBs...

About a week or so ago, I did Uranium Fever with a new Bloodied build Character, I was around level 30, and 2 level 200+ players showed up using 50 Cals, they were killing everything as quickly as they could, and dropped the first legendary before I could get a shot on it, I flashed the Angry emote and one of them flashed the scared emote, so I switched from my ordinary low level 10mm SMG to my Bloodied Explosive Combat Rifle, neither of them got a shot on the next 2 Legendary enemies, and they were flashing angry emotes at me, &amp; shooting me when the event was over.
---
I would like to think they learned a valuable lesson that day, but if they haven't learned it by level 200, they are simply inconsiderate a$$hats who will never learn.
---
Just a few days ago i was in the middle of the bog and just stopped. The fog, the trees, the far off laser sounds from watoga, the whistling of the wind. It was all so beautiful.
---
Wow, thanks for the unexpected flashbacks.
---
yeah I said they should double the atoms per dollar amount - there is plenty of things people would keep buying specially if they were half the price - also it would mean in game atom gains would not have to be reworked
---
What is the monologue you're getting from Rose? If it's the "I've come to like you but don't cross me" thing, you're at the start of the "Key to the Past" sub-quest, which was buggy for me as well. In my case, the thing resolved by itself once I server-hopped a few times until I found a server that was capable of running the quest scripts without bungling it up. At that point I got the quest completion splash for Flavours of Mayhem and the official start splash for Key to the Past. Otherwise, you might want to check if going to  [Blackwater mine](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Blackwater_mine) shakes anything loose as that should be your next objective.
---
Generally, I find it useful to untrack "The Missing Link" while doing any of the sub-quests (Signal Strength, Flavours of Mayhem, Key to the Past), because the map marker will continue pointing at the 3rd floor of the Top of the World, while there is nothing to do there because that quest is stalled until all three sub-quests are done.
---
If you're playing in Pacifist mode, no players can kill your pets... This however does not stop Grahm from killing your beloved Mega Sloth... RIP Sammy. Gone, but not forgotten.
---
Hi Vector - thanks for taking the time to reply. My interest in either of the perks is that I'm not a true sneak player and do mix it up in CQC. I have been killed or greatly damage by my own explosive weapons. I avoid PA for the most part and I do have Nerd Rage maxed out and a point in Rejuvenated. Thanks for the suggestion on Serendipity, I'll check that out.
---
The key driver in asking about using Barbarian and Ironclad together was to get a handle on the math to make sure that I didn't waste points when I could benefit from other perks.
---
Cheers
---
What if they made atom shop items for your camp with considerably less? I'd get around it. Although I'd obviously prefer the incremental increase because I don't generally buy from the atom store much
---
^ This
---
Get a Tesla, it helps with tagging enemies.
---
I traveled from FS Delta to Watoga Station last night, and it rained a large Flock of SBs on me, that happens when you don't fully loot them.
---
OK, then what should happen is that you return to Rose, which ends the quest "Flavours of Mayhem" and starts "Key to the Past". This part was buggy for me as well. The next objective should be to go to  [Blackwater mine](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Blackwater_mine) so you might try that place. For me, this problem solved itself when I logged into a server that was capable of running the quest scripts without bugging out.

The ratio from Atom Shop points to Dollars should be way, way lower. 18 bucks for a power armor skin when i can get the game itself for 20 bucks is outrageous.

I'd rather just pay the 15k caps for a good weapon than have to micro manage food buffs.  15k isn't that much imo.
---
Sometimes they follow even when fully looted.
---
Stabilizer must have
---
You should be able to do a "Repair All" from your CAMP beacon.
---
Some would probably say it would bloat the selection of weapons without adding anything of substance but I'd love to see those added. Another option is the 5.56 pistol, aka "That Gun"
---
That's awesome dude. Partslist?  I only recognize Patriot prime left leg and liberty prime chest
---
1 Boss for PC

1 Boss for PS4

"Share ideas and work together"
---
Only if it was that easy 🤔
---
From a practical point of view, adding more weapons to the Legendary pool lowers the chance of getting any one specific weapon. And adding new weapons to the game without also adding them to the Legendary pool is kinda pointless because of how strong the Legendary effects are. So while I can understand the desire for more variety, I'm kind of against it on those grounds.
---
I like this joke. Thanks for the smile.
---
I use intelligence on my heavy build for stabilizer, the perk that reduces energy ammo weight (fusion cores / plasma cores), the perk that makes fusion cores last longer, and first aid.
---
Unless you’re using guns with explosive they last quite a while.  I think 5 in guns is a waste you can get better perks for heavy in intel.  Plus you probably have a load of repair kits you can use on the fly too if needed.
---
They are full of shit.
---
if they get invicibility, or whatever, they need to remove their ability to defend a camp/attack a player.
---
I tamed my mirelurk king with Animal Friend 2 and Wasteland Whisperer 1.
---
Cool, send me your psn and I'll add you when i get home
---
I'm still laughing...meanwhile i'm going to give the body a proper burial...
---
I WOULD LOVE TO USE MY LIBERTY PRIME ARMOR! 
---
but after a while the shouting becomes annoying. which sucks because it looks amazing and it only requires 1 piece of the armor to make the voice work. 
---
I really hope they have a mute option or make the voice pack a "mod slot" in the armor so you can remove it and added on your own accord
---
Do the dailies instead for possum badges.  Toxic waste and insect parts.  Stock up on insect parts when you kill them, so you don't have to go to all the spots each day.
---
Tadpole badges - unless you want the extras, you only need 3.  Easiest is to do Archery, Hunting and Mammologist...  cripple the yao guai with a shotgun or something else, then finish off with a bleedout syringer.  The yao guai at Philipi Battlefied is often much lower level than the one at Dolly Sods if you need an easier target.  3 repairs of crossbows is easy, never repair beyond 100%, and bashing with them does a number on their condition.  Don't even need the revive in water, just go to Encryptid or other big events where players die often to do kindness.
---
I thought that one was still available?
---
Hacking is more prevalent in PC lobbies, sure. That’s not unique to Fallout. I play on PS4 and not once have I encountered someone who I suspected was using an aimbot. I agree, it would be nice if Bethesda was better at detecting hackers and at fixing bugs in general across all modes/platforms. But leaving a legitimate mechanic in game that puts you on par with hackers is not an appropriate fix to the hacking issue, especially in PS4 and Xbox lobbies where hackers are relatively uncommon. Assuming there won’t be any hackers in your lobby, it leaves the game incredibly unbalanced and pushes away a lot of players who crave a competitive experience. There are plenty of elements that spice things up in NW but aren’t fundamentally game-breaking, in my opinion. NPC’s, perk cards, radiation, hacking, lock-picking, chems, mutation serums, even nukes.
---
I don’t know about the rest of you, but as soon as I hit Level 100 and unlock all of the NW skins, I’m out. If I want to play a balanced/competitive Battle Royale simply for the experience, I’ll play Apex Legends. Know what that game (which has a monumentally larger player base than NW) doesn’t have?? Noob tubes.
---
Thoughtful enough for you?
---
I’m saving up for 10k atoms. 71% complete so far
---
The officer with beret
---
I guess our 'Fren' finally realized he's a fucking idiot and went away? Almost sad. I was very nearly enjoying educating you on the use of language in text.
---
I don't have Vending machines at my main characters camp for just such reasons.
---
Makes sense. I’ve had pretty terrible luck with legendary items in general so it hadn’t crossed my mind.
---
On the other hand, it’d be cool to have some new skins for the favorite weapon of your choice.   Damage aside, a new (or favorite) look and sound would be nice to have.
---
Fuck The upvotes are either on 666 or 669
---
War Rider Power Armor Skin for the head and left arm (available on the atomic store for 1400 Atoms right now)
---
Liberty Prime chest and left leg (not available atm)
---
Raider Waster Power Armor Paint for the right arm (available on the atomic store for 1400 Atoms right now)
---
Thanks! I haven’t really used it and thought it said only block for session, thanks for the heads up!
---
That would be the 'stop beating a dead horse' rule 10.
---
The war rider is the left arm and helmet, then the  new waster skin for the right arm and standard x-01 for the right leg
---
Ya know paragraphing?
---
That Gun has ended up being one of my daily carries on almost every play through of FONV for me. I really miss the 9mm pistol as well. Just looks really neat, would be awesome to see it on a modern engine.
---
Ignorant idiot, it's perfectly fine to put the adjective which describes the noun AFTER the noun it is describing in some sentences.  You need to go back to school well BEFORE tryi g to educate others on a subject you so obviously failed to grasp.
---
Yes, this is me. I assume we can keep this just between us? My poll numbers are shaky as it is.
---
Hahaha 🍻
---
How does he/she have time for friendship? They would have had to have played roughly 6-7 hours a day, on average since beta, to get 2500 hours haha.
---
Cap Sinks like being able to upgrade our workbenches with different bonuses or consumables that give small chances for double legendary drops would bring more value to our caps I think
---
One of the finest firearms of all time.
---
Noted 👍🏽
---
I really like the idea of paying caps to start an event. Not all events, but a few could require an outlay of caps either before starting, or maybe even before joining.
---
It's a classic plus really fun to shoot.
---
on xbox there are a community of us that will go around and just cripple stuff when we see lower level players in the area esp a nuke zone and such .. share the xp and loot i say.
---
I agree. I always found it funny that players don’t get a bounty for stealing chimes.
---
I like having shit thats hard to get. The game was incredibly boring when everything was handed to you. Suck it up and rise to the challenge. Literally.
---
did you even read my post?  every build needs it to carry stuff to survive, this is a survival game, food and water weigh a lot
---
Agreed. I almost went with one awhile back but I bought two Smith and Wesson M&amp;Ps instead. I like higher magazine capacity.
---
I have the refrigerated and the high capacity mod it only took me months of doing dailies
---
I agree. I saw the requirements and didn't even waste my time for anything beyond the standard backpack.
---
I play games to have fun, not to do chores. There are a million other things I could be doing, or even other games to play instead.
---
the number of low S builds may be more than 1 but you are certainly in the minority.  it's a survival game, how do you carry what you need?
---
Sale.
---
Chances are most of the stuff you get you will want to convert into scrip again and the limit is 150 per character and cycle.
---
Just through it, there will be plenty of chance to replenish before the DLC hits.
---
Besides with the planned 'balance pass' that comes with it is entirely possible that our current equipment will become just scrip fodder.
---
I have yet to be able to place a blueprint that is auto generated.
---
This worked about the first 6 months of the game. Then when they screwed it all up to defeat the concrete stacking.. All has been screwed since then.
---
Sounds pretty dumb.
---
Very much so, FO76’s “new” content got old fast, I know a lot of people just sitting and waiting for a game changer
---
Most of the time, at least for me, i dont need the full buff from bloodied, Only for high level areas. But yeah I know what you mean, it's not ideal. And can always just pick up a vanilla weapon from a dead enemy.
---
Athlete is actually pretty easy if you manage your sprint and pay a little attention to where you're going/need to go. Hell, I beat the course with all the booby traps the first go just by sprinting down it and ignoring the traps. Most of them actually went off behind me when I was sprinting through.
---
Hunter is obnoxious more than difficult because of the Yao Gui challenges. It's also stupid. Like what part of *hunting* involves deliberately taking on a wolf with just a knife? Or *killing* a bear with what's basically a tranq gun?
---
Archery is easy as long as you use a low level crossbow during the challenge and don't over-repair it. Otherwise breaking it enough to repair it three times is a royal pain.
---
Wait wait wait. There’s really a recipe for s’mores
---
I haven’t logged in since survival was removed, yet here I am...
---
I still find entertainment in the rage filled posts from players that get killed in their workshops, but that’s just the psychopath in me.
---
I hear ya on that. But still a 1911 would really round out my arsenal lol.
---
They proved that to me with the remarkable waste of time all of that stupid shit you had to do for Rose the raider robot in the main quest was. "When in doubt, *FETCH*."
---
Since each gun can be modded to fill a wider variety of purposes, for new weapons I like to think about what gaps haven't been filled yet in the game's arsenal. For pistols, there are a few.
---
The 10mm Pistol is the only semi-auto/full auto pistol in the game that isn't pipe or energy. A .45 Pistol or .38 Pistol alternative would be awesome; or a stronger pistol with rarer ammo, like the 12.7mm pistol or a .50 pistol like the Desert Eagle from the old games. They teased a Gauss Pistol for Wastelanders, but personally I'm hoping that has the same charging mechanic as the current Gauss Rifle.
---
Oh, and an integrally suppressed revolver would be really cool, since the current revolvers can't be silenced. Especially if it didn't use .44 rounds, but I'm just annoyed every revolver other than the pipe revolver uses the same ammo type.
---
It’ll probably be my next purchase.
---
It would be easy to add. Like Biv can have a rival robot brewer he wants you to summon and kill daily. 3k caps to get part. 3 star legendary fight requires 4 people to kill. 
---
Watoga can have a vending machine that activated a scorch beast siren and a legendary scorchbeast shows up. 
---
Shit load of possibilites.
---
I mean, 2014 was 5 years ago but, okay
---
Would you go with a colt or kimber?
---
Good luck ever seeing Campfire Tales pop since they fucked up events if you only play a few hours a day. Drop rate for badges seems pretty good now for the other two events you can still trigger yourself, though.
---
Exactly. That's why you don't build shit you can't afford to repair constantly.
---
But survival removed just 9 days ago, lol
---
That's hilarious. A piece of cloth works fine, but not a 900 Atom Cap gas mask.
---
I almost have all my badges, only 4 to go (2 from possum and 2 from tadpole) and each of those only have 1 or 2 conditions left. 
---
I have loved every second of earning the badges. I even decided to do things slower to enjoy them, for example, I walked the entire length of the train system without fast travel, carrying a railway rifle to visit all the stations and train yards. It was a really fun experience that I would recommend. I discovered a bunch of locations I normally miss and even had my first encounter with the flatwoods monster (Alien). 
---
I agree that some of the challenges are on the tougher side bust some of those have been my favorite. I would even love another level to the scout badges with harder challenges to earn a eagle scout award or something of that nature.
---
I’ve only shot a Kimber once but it jammed on me twice in one magazine. I’d definitely try each brand again before purchasing but we’re I stand today, Colt.
---
k
---
I was really struggling with Fo76 being a lifelong franchise fan - (I actually loved CAMPs!) but the backpack quests is where I threw the towel in. 
---
Who the fuck decided that was a good idea? Maybe I’ll pop back in after wastelanders drops, but I think I’ve learned my lesson.  I love old fallout games because they’re OLD. They’re not going to be made like that again. At least I have cyberpunk 2077 to look forward to! :,)
---
This. I just stopped scrapping the other stuff for acid and usually have everything for the daily or at worst need to go kill one thing.
---
.44 should be changed to .357, that was the SA revolver actually has some more damage being a .44 to compensate for the slow reload speed, just my opinion.
---
Thats like saying whats the point of locking doors. When it just takes 1 player to pick the lock to get in. And is 1 reason i dont bother with doors anymore.
---
Yes.....lol
---
More Ideas:
---
* Does this Sheepsquatch Mascot Costume Make My Ass Look Fat? emote
---
* Please Don't Teabag My Pet Mega Sloth emote
---
* Let's Do ~~Drugs~~ Chems! emote
---
* Why Are You Calling Me Homophobic Names When You Have A Rainbow Icon? emote
---
* Who Wants These 5.56 Rounds From the Scorchbeast Guano? emote
---
* What Do You Have In The Way of Porn Mags? emote
---
See! It works!
---
This really only makes me excited because I love s’mores in general lol but I’m also just surprised because i had no idea
---
You're barking at the wrong tree!
---
A 1911 would be nice given that they were around long before where the Fallout universe splits off from our timeline.
---
yes
---
I have a 156 NW player (and an 83), which is all I use Fallout 76 for, so have been highly committed to the game mode since it launched. 
---
Without the M79 antidote I would have quit a while back after the free to play weekend seemed to spawn a massive crop of new PC cheaters.
---
Personally I don't mind being killed by an M79 from time to time because I know at least it's probably not an aimbot. Clearly the console communities have no idea how bad the cheating is we are trying to put up with on PC.
---
I'm not part of them, but it sounds like these guys would  be right up your street.
---

---
Like the silenced .22 from NV? Admittedly that's not a revolver
---
It’s a shame because that event usually yields good XP and rewards and drops.  But it’s the worst set up because of such tight quarters.  
---
The last time I played 5-6 others were running the event like clockwork.  Tagging enemies, fixing the jukebox, and playing the music.  It was actually going well until we heard the wendigo boss growl and all of a sudden I hear two blasts and run outside and here’s a guy that spawned in right at the end and hogged the legendary drop.  God I was pissed.  Me and another guy eff this so we gear up to PvP this tool and he logs off the server.  
---
So not only were they one greedy bastard but a chickenshit to boot.  
---
I haven’t returned to that event since.
---
Yes, people are tired of that question.
---
...I had no idea it was in NV lol
---
I have never been able to do a full build, and then move camp and replace it. always messes up even if the outline is green.. something with the overlapping peices according to google..   
---
now i just build a bunch of 1x1 huts and link them, putting all the crap in and on top of it.
---
yea i guess but i kinda like it as well as you have to plan what perks to use to boost your specific needs. there is a semi skill to planning you character.
---
He’s level 11, calm the fuck down.
---
Yeah, and PC problems shouldn’t be what dictates how the experience is ruined for console players, which are the majority of the player base.
---
I'm lvl 118 and still haven't earned the first rank. Because I'm not into mindlessly doing tasks that aren't actually fun.
---
They should add that. It’s just says disarm and then they’re wanted haha
---
It amazes me that they fixed this, and did it well, but their player base can still go fuck itself for Plasma Grenade plans.
---
I enjoy the badges, something to do. If you're trying to rush through it all, ya, you might not enjoy it.
---
That little level twenty-something bastard at deathclaw island is only a few caps travel from the vault. Do that thing every day and you should have them fairly quickly.
---
r/pkoa are a pretty rp heavy group that always like to help
---
"Time to die, mutie."
---
Yes its probably best if everyone just stops playing because Bethesda doesn't seem to be able to please anyone. Here comes Modern Warfare with full cross platform PvP ...
---
Just burn through it, there will be plenty of chance to replenish before the DLC hits.
---
Bug bite should absolutely be tagged as essential while doing that BS quest so we can't accidentally scrap them twenty damn times.
---
Not that I did that. 👀
---
Completed 8 possum badges in three days of recreational play.
---
Git gud.
---
I think that's a urban legend, because we made it a lot and we didn't have any problem, even when we crashed during the boss fight.
---
Do you specifically have to acquire it? or do you just need to craft them them? I see that recipe all the time in people's vending machines for 50caps or less.
---
I too am frustrated by the amount of fetch this, do this impossibly boring task that, do this thing that you need a level 4950436505 character, even though this is a scout mission for children (why would a child have that high a level?)
---
Then don't look. 
---
Sigh
---
There's always at least one.
---
Can we force all of the old employees to take part in a gladatorial battle to the death?
---
All of them come from challenges, not a single one from event.
---
The challenge was fun.
---
Try doing some of Dofus epic quests. Those take literal months to complete.
---
my only suggestion is make sure they are released for “free” in the Atoms shop
---
To be fair even at level 11 there are options... Looted Fusion cores (can't use PA yet and will become common later), gunpowder easy to come across from mutants, midrange crafting supplies they won't yet need like rubber and gears, craft healing salve to sell to other low levels. Recipes are random so especially low levels, worthwhile sharing duplicates.
---
Just a thought
---
Yeah. Something just a bit weaker than other revolvers, but the silencer is built into the gun (it has to be for revolvers) and can be the perfect revolver for stealth builds. Maybe chambered in .45 or 10mm.
---
DMed
---
I love finding all these hidden story pieces and references to other things. It's funny even if you pass by it a million times, then one day, you are in the right frame of mind, or see it at a different angle and DING! I GET IT!
---
I’m aware of this. 
---
So it’s not unusual that I’m still here? I’m just trying to understand your comment.
---
Much thanks!
---
Same, fusion cells, plasma rounds, common bullets, crossbow bolts, all one cap.
---
The World badges are so boring to achieve, but I really want the backpack cause aesthetic.
---
Ik someone who sells them for 100© each
---
If it provide protection it will not be cosmetic item...
---
Haha! Do you USE that combat knife? I've got a three star shovel I keep. Lighter, faster swing speed and... something else. I only keep it to bury that damn soldier!
---
BURIALS ARE NON-NEGOTIABLE
---
You can kill the Yao Guai with grenades as long as you have the syringer equipped. That's how I did that one.
---
I have a two shot combat rifle that I primed and it’s also hooked up as an auto with 20 mag clip.  Reload speed is secondary effect on mine. 
---
It’s a great weapon.  I’m running 169 dmg with all the perks and if I hit the chems it’s over 200.   I did SBQ this morning and just melted that mofo.
---
Swiftly tell me :)
---
Yeah but new weapons are cool. They're never going to hold back on adding content to the game just because it makes legendary grinding more difficult.
---
In fact, they'll probably add new legendary effects, too.
---
The keep out backpack.
---
The environmentals are amazing. I mean it's the FO4 engine, which we all marveled at when that came out, so I would expect no less.
---
I've got a nice camp overlooking some farmland, that goes from daylight, to super orange, to dusk, with birds chirping and trees rustling behind it. It's amazing to watch the day cycles sometimes. The fog at dawn, etc. Even with all the irritating crashing, I love this game still.
---
The issue for me is that in playing wasteland, fallout 1 - 4 etc is that it used to be more rpgish and the npcs played into that. I loved doing the quests, but 76 only has dead people giving quests. So I just burn through them because it doesn't matter the story, since they're all dead. I dont care of Suzy needs steel or whatever because shes dead. 
---
I've met people in game, but none of you have given me any quests so I only use other players to help with the queen or buy stuff from. I dont play with others and have no plans to. I cannot fathom how people who've played multiple other fallout games can handle not having real npcs. I'm guessing a lot of the 76 players are new to the franchise? Because I cant see anyone who played earlier games would want pvp either. 
---
Years later I can still remember some of the NPCs in fallout 2, the lamp lighter kids in 3 one of whom made it to 4. Preston? The dude with the tree in his head, harold. Come on man, this final 180 with wastelanders will finally finish the apology tour and give us the game we should have had at launch ... well minus the pvp cancer
---
Thennnnnn make it a gas mask skin, not difficult to solve the problem.
---
Greenthumb! I run through nuke zones for plants, but only to get me some of that excellent inert flux! I never seem to have what I need to stabilize this stuff, so it works...
---
I haven't even had a chance to boot it up. Sorry. 😢
---
Peak r/fo76
---
I know. I was saying the challenge made zero sense in the context of a scouting badge. You don't kill things with tranq guns, you knock them out. The challenge should have been something like "knock a Yao Guai unconcious with a syringer" or "immobilize a Yao Guai with a syringer".
---
But you never come back once the tree can talk.
---
I would LOVE to see it, assuming it's not a huge pain in the ass! I've got all the shotgunner perks (all nine of them, which I question the wisdom of...) and scattershot, but somehow, my shotguns are a letdown. Like everyone else, I do know about the nerf, but it would be REALLY nice to not use all of my ammo on one scorchbeast/mirelurk queen...
---
I thought me supporting the game was spending $60 on opening day, telling all my friends how much I loved it, then they went out and spent $60 on it.
---
I understand that online gaming needs cash coming in. Someone has to pay the developers, server costs, support team to keep servers running, etc. But I too feel that stuff costs too much in the atom store. I just wait it out for a sale, or ... it just wasn't meant for me to have. I paid my money and trudged through the glitches.
---
then it should reward like 1 bobby pin not atoms.
---
These are amazing
---
I'd also like Pointing like the thumbs up emote, a belly laugh emote, and a sorry emote
---
I know a few. Brahmin milk, Radaway and radshield. Also the decontamination shower
---
No worries :)
---
I prime every hunting rifle or pipebolt I get because crafting prime .308 is far easier than normal .308
---
I've got your name and everything. I'll find you! Are you on most weekends?
---
I like to PvP and don’t even mind the camp damage aspect but what I am finding is it’s all about players teaming up and luring you in either at a workshop or some other PvP opportunity like an event. 
---
If someone initiates PvP with you their teammates should not be allowed to pile on unless they also initiate PvP.   It’s far too easy to get into a 3-1 or 4-1 situation and very rarely have I been able to escape those exchanges.
---
Very nice! (Stats/spreadsheets are fun!!) Thanks for putting this together.
---
Also, if this doesn't change much, and especially since it fits on one sheet, convert it to a PDF. Easier for more people to open without worry of margins or other oddities from opening spreadsheets.
---
I've been writing lots of articles and stat type stuff for Magic Arena lately, so I appreciate the work put into this!
---
I've got a Fallout76 section on my site for things like this if interested.
---
Will do this evening.
---
I assume that perks that reduces weight have nothing to do with the original AP costs, because otherwise it would be possible to run heavies with a VATS build.
---
Read the last word of what he wrote again in the context of the thread subject and ask yourself which one of you missed the joke.
---
Right? I wish they would just fix the core PVP experience in adventure mode instead of using NW as a substitute. I want to pit the gear I spent hours grinding for against the gear that others spent hours grinding for, and to be able to approach PVP (or not) in an open-world scenario.
---
For me, playing survival mode was the most exciting part of this game before they removed it. I understand why they got rid of it though and it needlessly split the player base.
---
Bethesda should add the option to toggle pacifist mode on/off in adventure mode, and give an incentive to have pacifist mode turned off. If you have it turned on, you get the existing slap-damage experience. If you have it turned off, you get unrestricted PVP but you also get +20% experience. And you only drop junk when you die either way (no aid items). I think that would be the best of both worlds.
---
Pint sized slasher outfit? It's not the right colors but the stripped shirt is there.
---
It amazes me what gets past QA in gaming companies these days. Does nobody check anybody's work anymore?
---
Well you can't add a friend or accept a friend request so why fix it?
---
I didn’t mind camp damage as it really forces you to make good decisions.  Do I PvP or not?  Do I keep my player vending option (open) on the map?  Do I want to get a bounty if not fired upon first? 
---
Now, people can screw with others pretty easily without much recourse.
---
I normally sit in the back and just cripple one of the leags for majority to all of them then everyone goes at them with a melee
---
If you build a personal terminal in your camp it will put a map marker for the tourist so you can find the camera. They added that feature in a couple of patches ago if I remember correctly
---
Nice
---
i left the game befor the sheepsquatsch update and still wait for a good reason to come back...
---
Nuka-Grape
---
That's the point
---
5th grade can be difficult........ 😞
---
I love this one too.
---
[deleted]
---
This is why I run in with a low powered, fast shooting, fast reloading weapon and just sit in the middle to tag everything as quickly as I can. If I see someone struggling, I'll go over to help/heal. 
---
If it's all higher level people in there 1 shotting stuff, I'll get my big guns out and do the same. Maybe they will see the error in their selfish ways when someone else is shooting stuff out from under them.
---
The players are the one that need to invest in some better manners when running into these events.
---
Don't hate the game, hate the players ;)
---
Once you go black cherry
---
You never go back, cheri
---
I’ll see myself out.
---
Happiness is having a good laugh at a dad joke. Thanks!
---
and nuka grape, -400 rads
---
Are you both sure? I knocked it out on my new character in about two or three days when I finally remembered I hadn’t yet. 
---
One tip: if you mark the challenges you have chosen to attempt, they will show up on your map as a reminder and you will get an on screen pop up every time you complete a task that counts towards it. It makes it a lot easier to focus on it.
---
My friends and I always do it as a group, if someone is being a dick we hop up on the roof and start blasting away with explosive gattling plasmas. 
---
Last time I did it there was five of us, everyone took turns pecking at the legendaries to make sure everyone got drops,  if someone got swarmed and went down or fired their explosive weapon at an enemy that was too close we'd take turns reviving people.  One asshole showed up trying to take all the kills but a few nuke mines took care of it.
---
Ty Sir
---
I felt the same way about those cargobots until I realized you can just shoot the engines out and it'll slow down considerably. Now I shoot them down anytime I see them
---
No, I got that part also, just because a joke was attempted doesn't mean one was made. Besides which, a lot of people get that one wrong on accident, the internet is no place to try a joke that just makes you look like one of the uneducated masses.
---
True, true you have apoint but it would be nice if people did the right thing by other players and just do a quick tag and jump out of the way obviously if you are backed into a corner and you are being swamped then it's open slather, I do a quick tag and then move onto another one just to be fair, its the same at the AWOL event once quite a few players turn up some of them think the event is put on just for them alone, it is great when players work with each other and everyone get's a bite of the cherry.

Just imagining someone laying face down driving around

Uranium Fever is one of those "I need to bring a pea-shooter" events or attend a webinar "How do 6 people carve up a mole miner" first.
---
I think for all public events people shud use a low level gun or a melee so everyone can get a hit in. Especially on legendary enemies
---
It has happened to some users. And it's a serious problem. Even if the chance is small, I'm not gonna risk all my stuff I have collected since the beta...
---
Woof? I only just started Rose because I went to her early in my game, and the first thing she wanted me to do was go shoot some yao guai with her peashooter. I died so many times. Is it going to turn into some go fetch thing that makes me sad?
---
Well now you have to go get the plan then...Sometimes it is in player vendors otherwise you have to hope it drops in the mentioned events.....and who doesn't love smores? lol
---
Lol its so fun if ur there with a couple people that understand it.thumbs up!
---
Dont forget the sulfur fountain at the Whitespring
---
It's because "it's there"   :D
---
Go raid Freak Show once a day, you'll get 82950654785903 bones and caps from that location.
---
Also, because bone chimes are a "trap" and not a "decoration". As such, Traps can be disarmed. You just happen to be using them for decoration.
---
I fully agree, but I found out the hard way as I was a melee build and each time a ghoul would come through the door someone crouching upstairs would take it out before I even had chance to get near it so that is when I started using a low level gun.
---
RadShield is a improved version of Rad-X therefore it does not remove rads, increases rad resistance.
---
I got this quest after finishing it. Now there is just a unfinished quest with 'suspicious person' who doesn't carry any items
---
You can store them in your stash.  I have around a dozen of everything at all times.
---
I'm dealing with that royal pain right now. I built the lowest level crossbow I could, didn't remember to switch perks, now I have a 200% durability crossbow. Time to burn through some bolts
---
OH wow, that's nice! Love the art style, Reminds me of Zombicide.
---
It's basically a half-mask, and it doesn't make sense for facial hair to pop out of existence
---
Sulfur fountains removes disease, not rads.
---
Well thank god you're here to police that.

If you're on ps4 I'll help you with the revive someone part. My PSN is damian_13_666. Send me an add and when I see you online I'll just fast travel to you and kill myself so you can revive me. I'll even replace the stimpak you use if you don't have many

Welcome to the community! Connect way less common than before. I used to get 1-2 per session, but idk if I've had 2 in the last 2 weeks (I play 1-2 hours per day consistently).

Bugger off, buddy, nobody was policing anything. You shouldn't urinate in your own breakfast food before going online, it's made you rather crabby.

Okay so for the fisherman's challenge go to whitesprings, go to creekside Lodge and purchase fisherman's overalls from cunningham (they're around 300c) he will also have the hat for 12c. Then all u have to do is kill **aquatic** creatures. Mirelurks, gulpers etc
---
Mary Pop-Popins
---
You are correct. My bad
---
He's apparently gonna shut up next patch but in the mean time you can pick up the remains from prickets fort and just keep them in your inventory to keep him from talking about it
---
I'm pretty sure the right leg is T-51 with Outcasts paint (NW reward). Excavator legs don't look like that.

Guys we found Sierra Petrovita's reddit account

I will totally agree about the PvP or should I say forced PvP being a huge problem. I myself in past FO games never used to travel with NPC companions unless for a quest then I would send them on their way. The problem for me like I stated was the same vocabulary over and over. Also I felt that some companions held me back from game play. This could be a big change though. I’m very neutral on companions. I was just like you about not teaming up with other ppl until I hit level 150+. There was something that changed on the way I looked at needing their help. Then I found the bonus of having teammates such as trades, having tips for me and helping in places I didn’t think I needed them. I guess it all depends on who you choose to team with. At first it was an occasional there and there then as I seen the benefits it changed my outlook. Now don’t get me wrong, I still spend 50-75% of the time by myself but having a 20 yr old son as a teammate gives us bonding time and cool conversation outside of the game. I’m hoping for big things with the new game play.
---
It's not *supposed* to work that way.  It did in the past, but it was patched so that PvP was confined to the boundaries of the workshop.
---
I'm wondering if maybe one or more of the players you thought were part of the team weren't actually teamed up?  Say for example, you get one dude who actually contests the workshop; his buddies are running around, shooting at you, so it *seems* like they are on a team.  But then when you return fire, thinking you are just defending the workshop, you are actually initiating open-world PvP with them.  Not sure if this is what happened or not, but it would be devious.
---
there's about a 1:4 chance, meaning that if you do both (clean up and stings) then you have about a 50% chance of getting a possum badge each day. I have 4 toons with HC backpacks, all gotten through only doing events, two of which were done after campfire tales ceased triggering. It take about 16 days of doing the two events each day.
---
It's important to farm you bug parts well - kate's grindhouse for your stingwing barbs, new river gorge resort for bloatfly glands - the tick sacks and BB probs you should have no issues finding multiples of. Leave 10 of each in your stash, and each day, log in, do your legendary sales, do your vendor sales and do your 2 scout dailies. Honestly, it takes about 10 minutes per toon.
---
If you don't have any on you, there's radroach meat at the Carson Family Bunker right next to dolly sods. 
---
Always turn up with exactly what you need straight from your stash - trigger and turn in.
---
Also, it's often best to do clean-up in your power armor because it's pretty rad-heavy.
---
That's my tips!
---
I'm honestly surprised we still don't have a laugh emote but we have a "let's cook!" emote
---
If you're on PC, I humbly suggest my mod, "Silent Liberty Prime," available on the Nexus.
---
Try out a speedy receiver on that gatling gun, you might like it better than a prime.
---
This made me laugh.  I jumped on the roof of my CAMP to shoot down a cargo bot when I discovered this.  There they were, 10 plants on my roof.  I was like "So THAT'S where they all went!"  Freed up some much needed space too.
---
Yeah, I just gave up and made a new crossbow that I was *much* more careful to make a weak as possible with how much trouble I was having burning it up. By the time I was done with that badge, I was *really* wishing that bashing things with your weapon damaged the weapon.

I kill the legendaries in one shot on purpose simply because I can. Maybe just get good?

Hey yea its semi normal sometimes i get dc after and hour or 2 then other times i never get dc so i think it all depends on server. I do know its alot better now then before. Whats your name in game ill add you.
---
It's sooooo stupid that it doesn't. Honestly, shouldn't using a pistol (for example) to hit something break in *more* than firing it would??
---
Easily made mistake, everything is radsomething :D
---
Depending on how things go after Wastelanders ( namely if my friends come back or not ), I'd be interested in any settlements on ps4 that need a merchant.  Ideally for a player town.
---
ugh he better. thanks for the tip!
---
Sale because even if they add new weapons, they wouldn't likely be temporary.  So you can get what you can now, then you have all the time in the world to try for new things.
---
I agree with others too, you can make more scrip in the meantime.

Radaway, diluted Radaway, milk (challys is better) &amp; Nuka Grape

Its not an item, but before I went bloodied I found the sun kissed perk to be the easiest way to remove rads.

All good, it happens

I agree with you 100% on your son. Mines 8 and 2 so I'm just playing minecraft with him. But yes I'd team with him in 76.

I try to build in the bungalo thing. Theyre neat asf. Use 1 space insted of 4 floors 8 walls and 4 roofs. But i cant decorate them cause things never stsy inside.

I've been tryna farm legendaries and put em all on my mule to turn that mule into a ammo/arms dealer of course my stock of what I got is shit cause I dont keep up with the meta or the demand of the best quality gear but yea I'd like to do that too. But first wastelanders.....

Not Invincible, but should have to be repaired like in any camp by using caps to revive them. Honestly It'd be pretty cool if we could also spend caps to level them up since the ones we CAN tame are so darn low level.

Supposedly there's a shovel near a tree right where you need to bury the remains but I never see it. There is one at Whitespring however.

Dude must be hurting and want company, or bored and not give a shit. Sucks to be him. Cheers!

A dense chest piece or a few points in fireproof help with the explosive damage.
---
This is so frustrating especially when you don't have room to fix it.  But there is a fix:
---
* If you are trying to remove stairs and get this error, build another set of stairs, off the same floor, leading to a foundation.  The temp set of stairs must be connected to a floor that's connected to the set of stairs you are trying to remove.  Remove the original and replace it.  Then remove the temp set of stairs.  Or remove both if you have a third set of stairs.
---
* If you get this error trying to remove a wall, build stairs up to the wall and build a floor connecting the stairs and the wall.  Remove the wall and stairs.
---
* If you get this error while trying to build above a set of stairs, build a post (they are in the stairs tab) at the bottom of the stairs.  That will allow you to build a wall on top of the bottom stairwell.  Build a post at the top of the stairs to build a roof overhead.  Remove the posts once you've built your wall or roof.

I turn up to a player's camp the other day on my shopping activities.
---
I see a deathclaw!
---
Arrgh!
---
No - wait - I see that it's his property - it's been tamed.
---
But guess what - it's spawned as a 3-star legendary.
---
My emotions at I stood looking at his:
---
https://i.imgur.com/e2oz04i.mp4
---
Thankfully, he logged out and solved my dilemma before I had to make a decision.
---
I know a lot of us want to bury the mayor of Grafton instead.
---
I still use sun kissed quite often as bloodied. In fact is my first choice if I can use it (outdoors + daytime) if I need to reduce my rads after inevitable exposure.
---
That perk is fantastic.
---
Exactly how I have handled it. Some dick with a DCG one-shotted the first manager and then did the puking emote when I called him on it. So that was the last legendary he got for that round, hope the one star item was worth it.
---
Luckily it's only happened that one time. People are usually pretty cool about it.

Not enough content, Bethesda solution make it tedious and frustratingly long.

If this sale hits 50% definitely spend every last bit you have on 3* items. Buy a gun for 50 scrip and turn it in for 40. It's a no brainer deal. If you are at max scrip before sale and get your max 150 per day each day of the sale you should be buying 1,600 scrip of weapons that can be rescripped for 1,280 scrip across the next week and a half after the sale.
---
Princess bed and anything else pink I missed.

Also High Cap backpack mod destroys your defense and you can die from  lvl 10 scorch, at least it makes it a challenge to fight them lol.

Unarmed build and strength bobble head is for collection moron. Alternate accounts?? My only account fool.

P.s collection complete

Definitely agree

I do it to kinda "grief" people

Being serious here.  Try grabbing a minigun, stand near the spawn point and do circles shooting it.  You'll likely tag everything.

---
Most of those calculations are based on using bloodied or junkie builds, which aren't a lot of people's cup of tea. Instigating is better suited for melee, IMO. Berserker isn't viable for most people. Enemy-specific prefixes are obviously situational. Furious, I can definitely see, and am using on my current character.
---
10% while aiming isn't great, but aside from explosive or fire rate, it's a crapshoot anyways. The only tertiary effect I'd rather have than cheaper VATS is faster crits. Since Fixers get a damage bump over the combat rifle as well as the stealth and movement bonuses, as well as the fact that you can't acquire them without knowing the plans, it's obviously going to go for more caps until the market becomes more saturated.
---
Basically, they're excited about their acquisition. Let 'em have their win.
---
You can now craft legendary items via V94 steel) but they ain't tradable.
---
If they allowed crafting and rerolling legendary items, and trading the materials would be possible, there would be two effects. Now we have totally random RNG, and with this change we'd have targeted RNG - still RNG but with setting yourself goals and following them. This would reduce the prices of top tier items, as well as generating caps sink for the crafting materials.
---
Maybe it's just me, and maybe (read: likely) I'm just complaining, but I miss the old atom shop layout, too. Navigating that new front page of theirs is a pain when I just want to get in and out.
---
That said, did they change the music in the atom shop? I like it!
---
Arizona Ranger, or Texas Red
---
Word on the street is INT helps with scrapping for plans. I've had my INT up to 27 with no luck so your mileage may vary.
---
Yeah, as much as I'd miss the versatility of having one on an otherwise semi-auto character, it ought to be automatic.
---
Similarly, laser and plasna guns with the Scattergun attachment should benefit from shotgun perks.
---
NO! Don't hurt my friend Chui !!! 😯
---
We became friends, thanks to Rose . . . &lt;sniffle&gt;
---
The point is that many people are capable of one-shotting most event legendaries. Did you really think you're the only one that can do that?
---
White wanderer, yellow same team, red not good very very bad
---
Craft up some radshield and take radx diluted to not diminish mutations.
---
Thx dude.
---
White neutral.
---
Red enemy.
---
Yellow ally/teammate. In events you're automatically allies.
---
HUD is a great thing.
---
You need to understand context. and in the Context of Kill/ Death - higher than 1.0 is positive
---
Example, is 4 a lot?
---
Depends on the context. Dollars? No. Murders? Yes
---
And if you STILL don't understand. Then you do need the lords help.
---
You've never killed a sheepquatch? It's possibly my favourite enemy in the game! Come back to the dark side, friend. We have giant irradiated (angry) sheep!
---
Cannon Fodder, because Pistols are less than weak in FO76.
---
Red Deb Revolver
---
Oh my god, yes!!
---
In college I would often play Skyrim in the living room. Anytime I found piece of hide armor, I would turn to my roommates and say “Hide armor?! But I just found it!”
---
Repeat ad infinitum, until my roommates preemptively cringed every time they saw me start to loot a bandit corpse.
---
Cat.
---
Weaker than automatic rifles yes, bit still very viable as a build. Especially the pipe revolver, as it benefits from both Gunslinger and rifleman perks.
---
&gt;Yellow ally/teammate. In events you're automatically allies.
---
Thank you, this clears up my confusion!
---
Possibly, but for a brief period of time, it was free. You could buy it in the atom shop or you could casually just build one, since it was unlocked. So it may still be in the shop, but they locked down the free globes.
---
Awesome Dead Wood character. Love her
---
I don't even USE power armor and I want this one!! I want it unlocked for the inevitable day that I really want Liberty Prime to shout at me (and everyone else)!
---
Where did I say he speaks for everyone? I simply quoted what HE wrote. We can't say whether or not his friends or family don't like him using it; They would have to reply to this thread. Anything else is simply stuffing words in their mouths.
---
And where does one draw the line on "unacceptable" gear? You can't use legacies, you can't use meat hooks, you can't use Strangler Armor...
---
Also, one CAN use Strangler Armor responsibly- As an Endgame-level player, I know how much damage I need to do to the SBQ to get credit, yet leave enough of her for other folks to get their hits in as well. I also know to fire in bursts, so that the Acid animation has time to fade away, as opposed to over-burdening the graphics engine.
---
Just curious - if game automatically ally you with others who do the same event does it mean my Lone Wanderer perks still works (since technically we're not in team)?
---
Max sneak and covert operative perk cards on ranged weapons are very very nice
---
Or a hefty stack of bug fixes that don't trigger regression bugs + a bigger stack of new ones.  
---
Boredom + frustration in a virtual environment?  Nah, I already have a wife, thanks.
---
I haven't not played this game for months now i heard there is a battle royale now and yes i'm planning to play this game again i'm currently level 120+ i think and TSE weapons were Overpowered
---
SILENCE IS PREFERABLE TO MIGRAINES
---
Same here, never killed a sheepquath before
---
haha nice! i couldn't find the double rimshot sfx from opening a perk pack but thats the sound that playd in my head
---
I think that's a bad thing, but I'm not actually sure. Did you still get to loot them?
---
I just want to run the vault raid, can never find a group for it. Lvl 122 here.
---
If I was going to join a group or do any 'lite RP' it would be some type of raider group, I get what you are saying. Not to say I don't help newbies but when you spend hundreds of hours in a game customizing your character you get a mental sense of who they are in the world.
---
I picture my character as a ruthless vault dweller with a background in engineering and science who created a heavily modified power armor chassis he slowly built up to gain an edge in the wasteland going on raids and decimating super mutant camps.
---
Where is it?
---
This is such a silly complaint to me. People one-shotting legendaries I get, but who gives a shit about the generic ghouls? I've seen several posts about it too so now I just sit on the roof at OVN until the wendigo shows up. If you're that concerned about the xp and shitty loot you're welcome to earn it.
---
I never had more fun in this game than taking out 9/10 people only to find someone who can absolutely smear me FINALLY. 
---
I am not even that good, I just have an understanding of some of the finer mechanics. Tweaking/planning my build to win more, lose less. It's the only reason I bother playing anymore. 
---
Someday I will figure out how to kill SB users because I hate it how so many people will walk away from a fight if someone is using one. I never have any/suck at using them effectively when I do. 
---
Rambling.

---
Vats crit sneak rifleman build. Lever gun's are great
---
Absolutely, ive never tried the shotgun mods on the energy weapons. I had actually assumed they  did benefit from shotgun perks. Shame on me for thinking thats how it would be just because it makes sense. Kind of like the prime receiver on a combat rifle changes your ammo to .44.
---
Who the fuck buys bone shards.
---
The wendigo gets the miscellaneous quest objective 'Kill a player wearing a clown costume'?
---
That's just Harold.
---
I’d consider it a heavy gun
---
that's unfortunate, as some more cross collaboration (quest/event structure wise) would really help.  as with any bureaucracy, i'm sure there are layers of communication where information and intention get lost but, y'know, its nice when veteran qb's give rookies some tips (if the rook isn't a sh\*+head about it).
---
also, team is a spirit, and you can't have no in your heart!  Life is a garden, dig it!
---
I watch the map A LOT. I also die in the map a lot when I don't get revenge notifications cuz lag.
---
And all your junk!
---
**Do players use prime weapons?** 
---
Yes, but generally only for dedicated anti-SBQ weapons, where the bonus damage is worth the ultricite ammo's flux cost. 
---
**What are prime weapons worth?** 
---
There's typically no cost differential for prime weapons. There's lots of players offering crafting services to prime weapons for you for nominal costs, particularly if you provide the required materials. 
---
**Why do you never see prime weapons for sale?** 
---
Modifying to a prime receiver costs flux and the seller doesn't know if the buyer will want it primed or not.  Also the seller doesn't know if the buyer  will know the prime receiver plan. If the buyer doesn't know the prime receiver plan, they may not know how to make the corresponding ultricite ammo.  
---
**Where do prime plans drop or are sold?** 
---
The plans drop reliably from the SBQ, and rarely from any ordinary scorchbeast. Players also sell them in vending. I usually see prices from 500-750, with a few outliers at 1,500. 
---
As a side note, the LMG and gatling plasma are two of the best weapons to prime since their ultricite ammo craft costs are reasonable.
---
Try shooting out its eyes and thruster, run around the structure out of los.
---
You could just research strategies for better survival and dive into the full mechanics of the game instead. Get a few kills in, you'll love it.
---
Nope, I never got to hit them. I was preparing to snipe them and then I hear all three of them die at the same time
---
This was true, I hope it's a bug that the last few times I claimed a workshop with someone else standing there - the claim bar would not move AND they did not go red no matter what. Total crap.
---
Right! I totally forgot about that one.
---
Because pushing a favorites button is too hard ???
---
Just an easily observable indication of the lack of good management @ Bethesda.
---
Give him green hair, a colorful suit, and put him on a talk show.
---
This is about the plasma pistol/rifle; not the gatling plasma, which already is a heavy gun.
---
It doesn't matter.  No one will ever see your character name.
---
Jane Wick you could say she is John Wicks twin sister.

The high cap backpack? Man, I can't even stomach getting the regular one lol. Hate all the Tadpole stuff. I don't know if I'll ever do it.
---
I kill Nia unintentionally with my Tesla :-(
---
Only if it's weightless/chameleons. 🙄
---
Sure. Not sure if the OP wants to consider sun kissed or a friend with rad sponge.
---
There are too many issues with the game as a whole that need to be address/resolved before I would spend additional money on this game. I have not even spent the free atoms I got on the store, because I don't want them to include that in their numbers as justification to continue.
---
I tried using VATS to take out eyes and thruster, but it didn't have much effect.
---
Went to High School football game last week.
---
Cheerleaders and band in the stands get fans to sing along to one song... and one song only.   Yep it was Take Me Home Country Roads.
---
Wish I had advance notice, would have recorded it.
---
they really are like, inorganic, to how someone plays the game.  you definitely have to go out of your way to do some of these.  the greatest difficulty i had however was in challenges that require a buddy (or even a rando).  ive made my peace with never getting a stimpak diffuser.
---
another thing: i'm glad they added a quick n easy way to unlock the camera.  b/c sooooo many other things relied on that.  had to actually resort to server hopping (which i h8 to do) to finally get mine.  i very much enjoyed the exploring/chronicling adventures in between the shoot-em-up's &amp; scavenge-a-thons.
---
not so sure that giving away the backpack was the right idea tho, esp since it doesn't really seem to need a quest.  actually unlocking it was a grindy achievement with tons of pseudo-quests and the award was easily displayable on character.  yes, i'm also rocking the Mr. Fuzzy Mining Helmet...jealous?
---
there's def an experimental feel in the way this game works (deep breath, andthatsOK....) the ammo/health vending machines are prime examples.  if we can highlight what are the enjoyable, fun elements, hopefully we can influence(r) the direction of this game and community.  Ad victorium comrade and don't feed the Yao Guai's!
---
God damn, you honestly sound like such a cry baby. Maybe this game isn't for you.
---
Done and done! 👍🏽
---
Yeah, the $14 for 1 paint skin is alittle crazy to me
---
i agree, the platforming in 76 def has much to be desired.  i still have nightmares of falling off the giant bridge (shudders...)

Nice catch!

It would be cool if they came out with a new outfit like once per quarter and sold the plan for caps instead of as an atom shop item. They could do it through the two Whitespring clothing vendors and charge like 10-15,000 for the plan and I'd probably buy every one.
---
I use Prime receivers in all of my Gatling lasers and Gatling plasmas.  The extra cost is minimal for the extra damage.
---
totally disagree with waiting.  it is not hard to find scrip once you level up.  During this sale you may find something that will help you level up faster.
---
If you find a level 35 AAE handmade or something as cool it is still going to be better than most level 50 weapons. 
---
Wouldn't worry about the market either, get stuff you can use.  if you only have that much scrip i assume you aren't walking around in full legendary stuff.
---
Ally and grouped are 2 different things.  If you are groups no lone wanderer, not matter the distance (from my experience)
---
How do you know a joke is a dad joke?
---
The punchline is apparent.
---
Agreed. Sometimes rather than fast travel somewhere I just turn on the radio and jog down the road just LOOKING at everything
---
My Bloodied Explosive Pipe Pistol does 591 damage and that's not a sneak attack.
---
Bloodied Western Revolver 351 damage also no sneak attack.
---
Junkies Explosive 44 does 270ish damage if I remember correctly.
---
Disclaimer I do use nerd rage and 1 level of each of the gun slinger and Riflemen perks. Demolition Expert I feel does not add enough value for the cost.
---
Pistols could use a buff but not all of them are weak.
---
Yeah, well, he's saying wanted ppl can get sparky ppl to turn red still.
---
Did you manage to fix this issue? I made a similar post 2 months ago. The gravel/soil isn't in allignment with plants/small rocks and the collision boxes, though only 2-3m difference. Still looks very ugly.
---
It really isn't that hard to be VATs aware.

It was really finicky for me. I found being outside, facing the station with the sign in view worked, but I had to be in just the right spot. It was super annoying, but it did eventually work.
---
If you are on xbox i can give you a nuclear key card for your troubles.  also don't go launch a nuke if you can't handle the radiation.
---
Lvl 230 here, If you want to team up in about an hour or so pm me ur ign and i'll help you as much as i can
---
Ok thanks. I'll try a few more positions.
---
I run about wanted all the time and can never get the sparky ppl to turn red for me. I also never get to come back invincible. Boooo
---
I’d go
---
The Wendigo Cave?
---
that's what she said.
---
I enjoy it running solo.  Just like previous versions, 76 has its quirks, sometimes mildly annoying, sometimes maddening.  But its still FO.
---
You can get to endgame without being on a team.  As others stated, certain events are easier when there's a group, but you just need to be present. 
---
OTOH, when I needed to collect a large quantity of violet flux, a random group of players helped me.  They didn't have some of required mats I did - The only thing they asked in return was a couple of stable each.
---
You have to stand at the Gas Sign (where they show the prices for coolant)
---
At least that worked for me
---
Skull mask is on sale. Nothing new, though.
---
Red Rocket Pack, and Greenhouse.
---
I'm suspecting there will be some triumphant returns of a lot of packs at Black Friday
---
Yes. I spend a week replenishing my ammo and 1 day using it all.
---
I know, a plasma gun in a flamer barrel to me would be considered a heavy gun similar to fallout 4 last I checked
---
I usually play after 9 ET. Gt is AaronCarr. Any of my higher level characters can clean out that place if you need some help.
---
Doesn't surprise me, there is one in FO4
---
Weird enough, i live nearby a Grahm spawning spot and he usually walks besides my Mireluk King Cat, they never agro each other
---
And actually *gives* you rads.
---
Is the health bar for your pet white or red? The Mega Sloths I have tamed always have a red bar which I think is the cause.
---
That is awesome. I am glad I stumbled upon this part of reddit. I will shoot you an invite tonight. Trying to break level 50.
---
Thanks for that, much appreciated. But what has happened is I relaunched the game and now there was no enemies around in the area. Strange. It has happened before. I ran into a large scorpion thingy which I could not beat. At my next session it was replaced by much easier enemies. Is this how it's supposed to work?
---
Berry Mentats show them when they're using a stealth boy. Maybe you knew that already, idk.
---
I did that quest at about level 25. The game gets a little easier at about level 20 I think. It wants you to be part of a team or to grind more and have a big pile of ammo, chems, good weapons, good armor, etc. before each successive quest stage. I think the difficulty is high the first time through for a solo player. That's why you see so many very high level players running around. Do they want to start another character? No way.
---
Work on getting the best equipment for your build and level. Have everything fully repaired. Go in loaded for bear. Figure out the best strategy. Grind to do the same for the next part of the quest. Find partners if you aren't a dedicated solo player.
---
That’ll make them one shot more stuff
---
Heavy build basically requires PA for Stabilized.  You are gimping yourself by going without it.
---
This is true.
---
You need a couple hits on an eye or a weapon with more damage.  You need to destroy the armor first next few shots should destroy the part.
---
You've obviously never played Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy  haha
---
You need the recipe, and to craft 3, that's all. If I ever decide to log in again I'll have to check more vending machines, I've yet to see it anywhere.
---
I like your style, Raider Khajit :)
---
He’s the Preston Garvey of this Fallout 😁
---
I've spent a decent amount of time idling in my camp in the mire with headphones on while working in my home office. I agree that this game has a fantastic ambient soundtrack.
---
As someone with a Semi Pistol build, i say no xD
---
Had exactly this at a double nuke fissure prime last night. Joined the event as soon as the boom went and by the time I spawned 3 scorchbeast were already downed including the queen. Spent the caps to join and the time and got zero. No rewards, no XP and no loot
---
We keep asking for solutions for this issue that has been put there since launch and keep getting told NOTHING from the CMs. 
---
I hope threads like this finally garner some response because it’s just soul crushing to go out and tame things nowadays. It’s like playing Russian roulette with all chambers loaded and you have to hope the gun jams instead.
---
I’m actually really reliant on the audio and hate playing without it because I’m always getting bum rushed by strung out ghouls who have 4.3 speed.
---
That’s such a good part of this community. Those who have questions will get answers if they ask and most people will go above and beyond to help out others so they can enjoy the game. Great share 👍🏽
---
Burying him doesn't shut him up. I did it and the quest just came back on its own. Ridiculous how long what seems like a simple quest bug has been in the game.
---
Slap an Assualtron head on that bad boy instead and we’re all effed.
---
personally, i feel subscription would've taken care of all those needs, but they saw all that fortnight money and just got cartoon dollar signs pop up in their eyes. + subscription actually demands real, continued production whereas, these GaaS/mtx storefronts dont -- they just need like, more products
---
I spawned in to uranium fever the other day... a level 20 was starting it up... all by is lonesome... then he ran and hid in a corner... didn’t say nothing... my teammates were offloading their last haul... that level 20 got NOTHING! I won’t carry your weight if you don’t have the decency to Atleast ask.
---
Sir, I bow to you.
---
check out this theremin!  whooooah!  Price: zero dollars, my time, patience, energy, and zero cents!
---
I would cleanse the Wasteland of him faster then I do with Brotherhood of Steel scum.
---
Yes, I think better weapons and armour would be great, but I do not really know how to get that. Can I just craft it if I have the right materials? I tried modifying a weapon, but there wasn't much available in the menus. All I do was get a longer barrel.
---
My most powerful weapon is the Anti-Armor Somerset Special, but I couldn't get enough shots in before I was killed, and now I'm out of ammo for that.
---
They were using the Grafton Mayor's calculator function
---
Thanks man, yeah I just got really into giving him all this help I had to say sorry a few times because it was just.. alot of info, but he appreciated it all. I know his quality of life is going to go up some, because when we first started playing I noticed he wasn't picking up things sometimes, and then everything unfolded from there. Had to prepare him for wastelanders! Hopefully I'll see him again so I can see how he's doing.
---
\*Badum\*
---
I like to hang out at my treehouse camp in the mire and watch the shadows creep across the landscape. Nighttime, it’s time to sneak around the area. Everything glows out there. Nothing cooler than seeing an angler fight in the distance when it’s pitch black.
---
 Yeah, because I can’t figure out how any sane person can justify $14 for those PA skins. Since you can earn some atoms in game let’s lower it to $10 worth of atoms for the PA skins, 1/6 the price of the game for not 1/6 of the content, what kind of fucked up inflated pricing is that??
---
"dear customer: you've overstacked the flow limit and now owe us $10,000 dollars.  we will accept google play or target gift cards."

Where are my 300k caps?

Wendigo cave, need marsupial mutation, enter and to the high upper right is a passage leading to the wendigo.

Are you online?? I’m an unarmed build but I can clear that place out for you
---
Why would you say something so controversial, yet so brave?
---
But enemy's spawn to attack your C.A.M.P
---
by accident not 'on' accident
---
I agree I feel safer with Mr policeman here
---
I see what you did there!
---
Most places can spawn different enemy types (somewhat random) and at varying levels (depending on player level), so if some other players were in the area yes this can happen.
---
Not right now. I will be tonight.  Still learning the perk system to get my build just right.
---
lol
---
I used to be a "pioneer scout" irl, so it's nice to help others. Especially if it makes others enjoy the game. I know the game had a rocky start, and I just wanna make sure we keep everyone we have. Plus, I cant really get off this game.
---
It looks like a dick made from foundation blocks I had to stop the video I was laughing to much.
---
Says the bloke who missed the joke &amp; so insulted another poster because of it. And now won't back down .... :D
---
Hunt some scorched and super mutants, loot their weapons and scrap them, there is a chance you'll unlock new mods based on your int. 
---
You should get the plans for the hunting rifle fairly early if you follow the responders and overseers quest lines. 
---
Then when you craft one you can choose the level to craft you should always craft the highest possible you can use but it requires more materials, but if you want to unlock mods craft and scrap the lowest you can or loot from enemies.
---
 Same goes for armor wear the highest level you can, also look for heavy version plans of the armor it really buffs the protection. You can use updated heavy leather a long time.
---
Peak r/DMDadJokes right there
---
And you needed to involve yourself because... Why exactly? I didn't miss the joke numbnuts, it wasn't a well crafted joke. Go try annoying someone else, I'm not interested.
---
Well I can help you if you want I’m in the UK so soon as my boys asleep I’ll be on. GT is lowlifescarab86
---
Run the leader of the pack event in the forest a few times. You will have to kill 3 legendary wolves during the event. You should get weapons and armor to help you . I recently did it on my alt and got a level 10 AAE SMG.
---
Did u tell him about the reddit market any goodies haha i helped a guy out one time and he had no idea what a legacy was and had no idea about bloodied weapons/builds being so op he thought they were crap and i was like bro go to the reddit market and get ur caps that was a while ago havent played with him in a few months hopefully hes doin well
---
I played fairly consistently since an early alpha (10/03) and BfA is what killed it for me. Impressive given how bad WoD got..
---
Ffs, yet another idiot who thinks they can educate a professional writer and editor on how to use the English language in print. Seriously, you're just flat out wrong there, it's interchangeable, and you look more than a little stupid trying to split such fine hairs anyway.
---
Rose is such a bitch.
---
"I'll never let go Jack!"
---
Second he dies...."Yea, peace out, Jack."
---
From my experience, it's not the "Level 500" players doing this...but the around level 100 Bloody builds who have gotten hold of a marsupial serum and are running &amp; jumping around like fleas one shoting/hitting everything.
---
Thanks! I will shoot you an invite as soon as I hop online.  All my friends that have an xbox look at me like I have 3 heads for playing Fallout.
---
Nope
---
I already pre ordered 2077... ;)
---
No it won't let you stack em like that, the only ones that technically stack are the weapon damage perks that have the expert and master ranks
---
To clarify, I very much understand the difference between "emersion" and "submersion." I've never seen anyone be this offended by something that was 0% offensive.
---
Furthermore, I absolutely love the Easter eggs Bethesda puts in their games, so there's that.
---
TBH after you deliberately being a jerk more than once without reason I'm just gonna block you and move on. I don't care enough to engage with yet another idiot.
---
And even those you can only have one of each equipped.
---
Gotcha, worth a shot I guess, would have been awesome but I see how some would become overpowered
---
Whaaaat. They demanded your Guns and caps?  Im all for raider role-playing but that is just...
---
Many players agree with you. I don't have a dog in that fight, but agree that it would be nice to find a solution that suited everyone, or at least more people than it suits now!
---
dont know if i agree with the unaffordable premise so much as bad value.   there are tons of other games, dlcs, and videogm bric-a-brac i can spend money on.  idk if these prices are competitive in this market, but i certainly havent felt compelled to plop cash down for atoms, like i did for a copy of far harbor (or copies of fo3,fnv to introduce my friends, can't even gift atoms if im not mistaken)
---
they can also say cosmetic stuff is "content" which clearly its not what is meant when using that word.
---
add'ly appealing to whales has a kind of insidious corollary; if i can feed an addiction for a profit, why not?  some ppl are cool w/ that and others not(doesanybodyhaveacigaretteicouldborrow?)
---
we'll see tho.  there have been some strides in the right direction.  does everyone forget the free stuff we've gotten in the shop?  + tying shop items/rewards to community events was inspired and hopefully we can see more of that
---
Yeah, Supply crates were dropping really close everywhere I went for about two hours straight on Saturday last.  One actually landed on me.  Didn't take any damage but did get "bumped" aside - lucky I was wearing Power Armour.
---
Beauty. Thanks for sharing!
---
This looks great! Does the volume of a gun have an effect on stealth? I can hear my shotgun echo through the area, so it's not very... discrete.
---
There are definitely some very specific "I have a god roll weapon, and I"ll only trade it for a wood left leg with these specific effects" posts, but you can still buy tons of awesome shit with caps. 
---
A lot of people who make "trade only" posts are doing so because they're at max caps, but they can often be persuaded by a pile of 5.56 ammo instead. They've pretty much stabilized at a 1:1 ratio, so I just buy up every bullet I find from other players to avoid maxing out my caps, and then barter with the bullets when I find something I want.
---
The Nuka T51 for right leg, left leg and torso are Liberty Prime ones
---
Mostly teasing.  How could caps be useless when my main use for them is the totally useful pursuit of getting plans that I will likely never use?
---
My armored gas mask works , and without -2 perception
---

It’s the Nuka World T-51 for the right leg

Nah, junk jet that fires pumpkins.
---
Really? I guess everyone has something they've never killed before. I've never even SEEN the Flatwoods Monster before. I'm totally convinced it's a myth!
---
yep only thing he got was a bullet to the head and many reports due to the fact that he was able to say the exact amount of caps i had. i tell no one the exact amount i have like i might say i have 10k  but its more like 12545 which is to be expected. the fact he said the exact amount is very suspicious
---
I am not wrong. And you speak like someone for whom English is not their first language. So I was being kind to you.
---
&gt; - By accident is the standard, accepted form in print.
---
&gt; - On accident might be common in spoken American English, but it isn’t an acceptable form in writing and publishing.
---
I'm using a prime gatling gun, prime mg42, prime gauss and a prime. 50cal. All bloodied. I Do have some standard Versions aswell to save uc ammo on low Level targets.
---
I would laugh the first couple of times, and then start getting really annoyed. That would get old if it happened all the time.
---
Indeed it is!
---
You 'were' being a jerk. Plus see if you can guess were you should have placed a comma in that sentence.
---
I want BoS paints for weapons and other PA
---
Agreed! Sunkissed/Healing factor was one of my favorite combos.  I have diluted radaway hotkeyed now.  I find enough of them that its the lowest effort option for my play style.  I might have to make a batch once a week, if I spend a LOT of time in nuke zones.
---
I don't have testicles, numb or otherwise, Mr Professional Writer. I'm a girly

Had this happen twice, and despite being one of the last to the body still had players give me the thumbs down even though I just got there. Dusted my mic to put them on blast and suddenly everyone had somewhere else to be.
---
I'm a tadpoles and a raider and I resemble that comment. I'm just workin' your scoutmaster for whatever I can get out of it. Once the well runs dry, that dip shit is going in the lake; the mirelurk can play volleyball with his chatty ass.
---
Are any settlements donating to his reelection campaign?  If not, he doesn't care.
---
I'm telling Mom ....
---
I think it's because it's a daily. Someone comes to do their daily and then walks off with the shovel. Then it's not there for the next person. I've found that shovel once or twice, but that's once or twice out of Every. Single. Login. So I keep a legendaty shovel with reduced weight just for this. 😆
---
So that is what happened to my bone chime!!
---
Those self-righteous jerks!
---
Annie....as in pistol Annies
---
Must have been the wind
---
Possible. I never see the shovel there and if I need one, usually go to Whitespring as there's always one not far from the fast travel point.
---
You know usually I can get it within a few server hops near the flooded train yard spawn, but with yesterday’s challenge I went there, creekside and overgrown and nada! 🤬🤬
---
I agree they should do this, the plasma guns are some of my favourites, also hope they allow friendly fire in charisma to work with the barrel, could make for very interesting builds.
---
Oh fod no! Don't say that! Then we're going to get a thousand atom challenges to take a picture of it!
---
Sshhhhhhh!
---
Do you have a pipe revolver as well? If not, why are you using the rifleman perks?
---
Charleston I think? There's a responder vendor there that has the most important one, *Brotherhood of Steel*.
---
Best you can do is have the same card stacked at different levels, but only equip one stack at a time.
---
Conc. Fire for example, you can have a stack of 1x, 2x and 3x and then swap in whichever stack best suits what you're doing at the moment.
---
I'll use something like this when I want Green Thumb, so swap my 3x Conc. Fire for a 2x while I'm harvesting things.
---
there are so many things that need fixing in this game before the Atom Shop gets ANOTHER new facelift
---
I just wish the discounts on the sales were more gracious.  30% off feels like nothing most of the time.  It's that 40-50% that is the sweet spot with the current prices of certain items.
---
Thanks
---
I have read somewhere that it depends on how much Resources (food, water, extractors) you have in your CAMP. My alt character has a camp to the east of Valley Gallerea, near the border of the map and not a single enemy has spawned for 2 months to attack me (no garden,no resources except for 1 small water purifier). But my main character's CAMP which is located near Site Alpha constantly suffering from enemies cause they spawn to chew the plants in the garden I suppose, or maybe it's just a coincidence I dont know..
---
Bone’s useless - unless you’re one of us haha 😈
---
Represent dude, not enough Raiders in Appalachia IMO - a girl gets lonely being the only asshole in the neighbourhood! 😁
---
They do announce, on the official forums and twitter.
---
The thieves struck!!
---
Or let CAMPs "grow" if they aren't moved. Fixed CAMP gets more budget.
---
I live in hope.
---
Wait.. is there a flamer mod for the Gatling plasma?
---
yeah, there should be at least some level restrictions for some events. Having level 1 players at scorched earth doesn't make much sense.
---
You bastard lol 😁
---
The Riflemen perks work with bolt action pipe pistols and revolvers. I might have forgot to put it was a bolt action.
---
Decent policy ngl. Love your username, fellow Raider.
---
Thanks. I've added a PDF version to the OP.
---
You just had to go there... lol
---
🔥🔥🔥
---
Well, it's a violent night.
---
I love Freak Show!!!! Got to get the baseball bat out to tip those baskets over lol
---
The same defense levels OP is referring to?
---
We can’t disobey our goddess.
---
yup. spend or transfer some caps and store your vendor until you do.
---
I always super jump way up in the air, trying to land JUST on the edge of the table so I can look down, but inevitable tip the basket over and they spill all over the ground.
---
And the dad joke of the day award goes to..... mixxbgg.
---
Yes. The beam splitter mod turns non-explosive plasma gatling guns into an ineffective green flamethrower.

Nice technique...
---
I would never have thought to try this. I mean, sure, and Xbox controller works, but it's a Microsoft product, so that makes sense. Nintendo don't like to share their products, so without making some pretty serious modifications to (read: ruining) your rig and switch, I doubt this will work.
---
That said, if you DO find some magical way to make it happen (pixie dust?), please do share!
---
Really? I've seen it a dozen times, and killed it once. It typically shows up and then poofs before you can do anything. Its kinda like mothman in that regard, except mothman is more likely to stick around and fight than the flatwoods monster.
---
I, too, use explosive weapons. Do you have Fireproof equipped? I only have the first one, but it's enough that I don't blow myself up with my own shotgun. Which may or may not have happened when I first got it...
---
I haven’t even gotten through the basic badges for the standard backpack. I can’t find the goddamn camera because it won’t  spawn. I’ve checked the various points. I’ve spent roughly 5 hours just in server hopping and roughly 1-2k caps in fast traveling
---
Wasteland Widow

Wendigo wants some atoms for a fridge. Those arms and legs go bad after a few hours you know.
---
People get too emotional over Sweet Home Alabama
---
I tried a bloat fly syringe for giggles.  I got the giggles but no loot or XP cos my damage was so pitiful.  So i crafted a minimum level Fixer configured for .38 and use that in events.  Then switch to my BE handmade if others are being 1 shot jerks :)
---
If your opinion is unpopular, then I guess mine is, too. I LOVE this map. The variety and size alone make it a winner for me. Walking up from Cranberry Bog into the Mire is one of the best looking strolls I've taken!
---
Aww, I've used beam splitter it looked like regular plasma rifle beam splitter and was crummy.
---
I put my vending machines behind a roll up garage door so when my caps get close to max I cut the power to my machines so my camp doesn’t show anymore on the map but ppl can still shop if they stumble across your machine so I just roll up the doors until I can go spend some caps, it’s awesome to be rolling in caps!
---
I used to work for an MMO company on a game (which has since been shutdown) and we would have mandatory play sessions followed by a feedback session because the developers would rather play WoW than their own game.   
---
One of the sessions was focused on mid to late game content where the LEAD DESIGNER said (and paraphrasing here) "Why is our game so difficult, why do we punish the players for playing?".   
---
The response from the Game Director was (again, paraphrasing here): "Players don't know what they want, we give them an impossible challenge so they can feel rewarded when they complete the challenge."   
---
With that philosophy it's no wonder the game was shutdown after a year.
---
they recently added it to the terminal, it will mark the location on your map
---
What?
---
for sure the best is the Prime receiver.. shoots slower and more damage.
---
That’s pretty slick, good idea!
---
I don't lol, I did at first but I found it was able to keep enough distance that I didn't get hurt 90% of the time, vault 94 is just so cramped that's impossible lmao
---
Now we’re talkin’.
---
I don't want to completely overwhem him yet! I just started getting into the 76market since I know what I'm looking for now Haha! it's so weird explaining it to people. I didn't know what one was too at first, and then.. I became it. This guy was basically me before I had help. I never wore legendary armor in fallout 4 or at first in this game til I actually took time to piece things together and then bam, stronger. Il have to tell him which weapons to keep and which to script next, maybe il give him some more caps to start him off. I cant imagine wandering the waste with 800 caps in my pocket.
---
Does anyone buy bone shards? I always seem to have some. Maybe they reproduce in your inventory like technical data
---
we all float down here....
---
Really doesn't matter. Your character's name is never mentioned again after leaving Vault 76.
---
True. It sort of defies logic that the suppressor on pipe revolvers even works, since the cylinder is still wide open. But I don't mind. 
---
One day, they're going to patch the pipe guns so they don't double dip on rifle and pistol perk cards any more, and while I won't be drinking anyone's tears, I'll definitely be taking that day off from reddit.
---
There loss
---
What? The prime receiver?
---
Yeah same for me
---
I similar issues..much after the game crashes and I have to run a scan and repair as it says I have modified files.
---
And conversly heavy to light/sturdy. Im sneaky.
---
They fixed the Syringer issue. (Unless it broke again in Patch 13). Have you tried Electrician recently? It might be fixed as well. I got the last 3 Badges i needed since the last patch so they do drop but they might be rarer now.
---
I did this at 18 or so. Was able to sneak down and get the duplexer. As long as you get it you can advance - even if you die shortly after.
---
The 14mm/12.7mm would make a nice top end. I'd say the Gauss Pistol, but it sounds like they intend to make that part of a separate line of weapons, so it'll probably benefit from different perks.
---
They work with the standard pipe pistol too, and if you make it automatic it benefits from guerilla and commando as well.
---
Just crap it and craft a new low level one. Use it to bash 4 or 5 scorched to death and it will be ready to repair again.
---
If you are crafting lvl 45 crossbows they take forever to degrade.
---
Wow, that exists
---
&gt;True. It sort of defies logic that the suppressor on pipe revolvers even works, since the cylinder is still wide open. But I don't mind.
---
This is a game where the 10mm pistol does significantly less damage than the .45 pipe revolver. Where laser weapons have recoil. Where "combat rifles" fire pistol rounds and "assault rifles" are water-cooled light machine guns. Don't think too much about it.
---
Anecdotally, I've noticed the same thing.  Drastically shorter friends list in the morning ever since this change happened.

Having fewer events in a world already bereft of them was a feature literally no one asked for, which means the only reason it happened was because they wanted to slow progression and limit Legendaries even more aggressively than they already have.  Then, you have this ridiculousness of needing to wait until Patch 14 for them to adjust a simple timer.  Why is it hardcoded like this?  They wrote this new system.  Did they not think adjustments might be needed?
---
I haven't tried the Syringer lately, but I do power up plants a couple times a week. Most recently last night. I still haven't gotten credit for it.
---
Campfire Tales was changed to a Public Event its much much rarer now as it doesn't trigger every night.
---
It was only level 15 but still, yeah, I think I just need a new one that isn't as well built.
---
Because you are wearing under armor... not external clothing.
---
We see the threads and have sent feedback like this to the Dev's on taming creatures. I don't have any new information yet on creature taming but we will share it with you in an Inside The Vault when we do.
---
That has been my luck so far. Every time I try there is a legendary king at least 20 levels higher than him. The closest I got to getting past was using a stealth boy that conveniently ran out right next to the asshole.
---
There isnt event much being added to atomic shop now a days that isnt a reskined rereleased items or just a full on rerelease, only new things NEW these last 4 weeks were wall paper an a few weapon skins.

Thank you, that’s all some of us needed to hear
---
Hey all,
---
We've seen the discussions on these frustrations with pets/taming and know that some of you are pretty passionate about this system. We've brought up your feedback and experiences with the dev team and will continue to do so. I don't have a status update to share right now, but will let you know as soon as I hear any new information. The community has offered up some great suggestions and we'll bring those up as well. Thanks!
---
Its trappers armor. Mine was doing the same for over a month now. Find new armor they dont care..
---
I who uses rifleman instead, think that's a awful idea ;)
---
but Honestly it doesn't suit either, closest is heavy weapons but that's just because it has cyrorator and flamers in it.

Just get rid of the mutations or seek revenge and kill them.
---
Haha! Made my day right here.
---
I like his way of playing. It is far more entertaining.
---
That one tales tape was messed up. The one where the boy goes into his dad's room (who is turning into a Wendigo) and it is assumed that he eats his son. Damn.
---
It seems people keep forgetting this isn't a Shoot 'em up, but an adventure and exploration game.
---
For the people that want a thrill there is already Nuclear Winter mode, and the the "Survival" mode while it lasts. 
---
Please let the people that want a relaxed game experience have it without having to worry about some angst gunslingers.
---
Its server roll backs. Happens to me randomly when building my CAMPS too.
---
That's nice.
---
They started destroying my base
---
This one is with the nonsense. 
---
I took a guy's junk earlier only for him to come up and snatch a couple of stable flux I had dropped for a friend. I couldn't even be mad, lol.
---
Next Patch he'll be a bit quieter!
---
All they said was that the problem has been "mitigated" which suggests that it has not been solved.

Yes, this is what I came here expecting to see
---
Bless you sir.
---
Thank you. That's what I'm saying. They are watching it. It's not fixed.

I would hang out here. Nice job!

NOOOOO,  die in Watoga and respawn  in the north?.. Hell no!
---
Anti-Armor 10mm SMGs are fairly viable. Lighter, high capacity, plentiful ammo.  45 round drum mag lets you shred a group of ghouls if your aim is good.  Everyone is so hard up for 5.56mm ammo, so it's easy to find 10mm stocked in their vendors in the 1000s.
---
What is sad is that a fully kitted 10mm SMG has higher damage than a fully kitted laser rifle.  The laser rifle still needs another buff to be usuable, either 100-200% more durability, or 100% more damage with 50% more durability.
---
Scrap em
---
Drop em somewhere, they're easily replaced.  Just make sure they're empty before you get rid of them!
---
I think you can scrap them at a workstation, but I don't know if they give any materials in return.  Same warning though, make sure they're empty.
---
That bloody is nice if you wanna trade
---
People marvelled at the FO4 engine?
---
Agreed! The scavenger bot pretty much works the same way I wish a tamed creature would.
---
Wash those 2 mutations off... that's what I did..
---
drop them if they are just frames....don't place down like you are entering them.....drop them from your pip-boy menu like you would drop a gun or extra junk
---
If you’re in pacifist it won’t hurt them at all. Best solution to AFK players at vendors is to lure enemies inside. I lured a bunch of scorched from Berkeley springs down to the station recently because an AFK player had been there for 5 minutes. The scorched didn’t kill him, but he sure got off the vendor fast.
---
My thoughts.
---
Keep the Bloodied, that's practically a god roll of bloodied pistol builds... or just regular Bloodied Builds sidearm. The Suppressors... eh... some people like them for sure, but not very many.
---
Thanks! We're going to get that updated as soon as we can today.
---
Also, bloodied/sneaky guerilla is the build for those.
---
Dang yeah and I got it again in overgrown sundew grove this time a scorched megasloth but I went maybe 15 hops and got him again
---
Ok, please read carefully:
---
"Alongside the release of Patch 13 yesterday, we included an improvement that will mitigate this issue going forward, and we will continue to monitor."
---
Where exactly do you read, that they fixed it? Just they they did something to make it less bad and continue to monitor.

Bone chimes? I thought they were crunchy snack ropes :-(

I wasnt aware of that. Must have already had both plans by the time I realized it.

Wait TSE are still overused? So did they not nerfed it?
---
You can't say a fully modded Skyrim or Fallout 4 don't look amazing.
---
The engine can do a lot more than they have it doing.

Your stuff is safe! Our internal data shows no new cases of this issue occurring since we implemented [our mitigation fix last month](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/364694/regarding-lost-items-in-vault-94?language%5B%5D=en).

When i get off work, "Super_POG" is my name.
---
You’ve spent how much on atoms??
---
Thank you very much!
---
Anti-PVP player here so you understand my position..
---
But you have the solutions.. wash the 2 mutations off that are attacking back. If you don't do this... then you ARE attacking back and thus you AGREED to the PVP..  and this is why they are killing you.
---
Looking back you will see that I always agree with the anti-PVP side but this one time I see the point of the PVP'ers.
---
But youre dead before you're done throwing because they quad ffr tesla has incinerated you.
---
When is this exactly? Also im at the circle for stingwing barb but theres nothing, idk what im looking for
---
Not really, I use bloodied weapons. Some players like the TSE but it seems a decent chunk are bloodied, and the then there's the chunk who have Legacy's or want them, which are OP I found out recently, least against me. The rest are just following their own dreams. Idk, I save my tse weapons to sell for some quick caps or trades but it seems like people are looking for other things now
---
I log in every now and then to check the weekly challenges. Might try to tweak my camp but get bored/frustrated with the camp system and log out within fifteen minutes. 
---
My PS+ sub is expiring at the start of November, so will be keeping a close eye on this Reddit to see how Wastelanders is received. God knows I wouldn’t be renewing my sub just for Sony’s largely mediocre monthly games.
---
I tried a bunch last night and this morning with no luck. I better not play the lottery today.
---
Right... But it doesn't seem so bad when you break it down per hour. Plus I had it to spend so I'm not sacrificing elsewhere.
---
4pm pacific time
---
You can't kill him, hes in cased in the materials as the black box for airplanes hence why he survived the triple nuking I gave him last night.
---
Same. I hate buying things full price and then it goes on sale next week. I’m just gonna buy from the sale from now on.
---
My skeleton costume mask I'm wearing for Halloween month works fine. Before that I just wore a bandana. Also worked fine. Yet a proper gas mask doing it's job??? That's just to easy for Bethesda 😂😂
---
If they do change it, change so both could use it. As a rifleman myself we don't have as great access to dps or raw firepower as commandos, and I'd be gutted to lose it.
---
Oh damn, if im not done with the quest sure! Im trying to invite people on the map but no one accepts lol
---
Think of all the foot traffic your going to see with you being the only camp out of the blast zone.. It's vending time.! And the launcher was clearly insuring you were not hit.
---
This is a favorable condition. Please do this to me too!
---
I got the plans after seeing just her body twice with plans gone, on the third spawn I found she had it all. Got the skeleton plans as well while farming her for approx 3 days, 7 days ago ^,..,^ 😍 Saw the vampire trick or treater too but nothing on him.
---
Woah neat, well i think i still have my TSE collection my inventory currently on Playstation
---
Go find out who is a pacifist by smacking everyone on the server.
---
I wouldn't have a problem with microtransactions if they were reasonably priced and the content was good. I feel the same way about Expansion packs. The problem is the original games are purposely half-assed among other things like making it more grindy to try and incentivize you to spend more money. Then the actual extra content you buy isn't even worth the exorbitant prices.
---
Doesn’t help that my challenges seem to be completed on their own without giving me the atoms when I play NW first. O
---
I had to double check where the decimal point was😳😳
---
I’ve only spent real money on the actual game...none on the atom shop. I feel your pain nonetheless.
---
&gt;RIP my lovely mirelurk king, you are missed.
---
I'm up to my 8th or 9th mirelurk king by now... At this point, poor Howard is more Jesus than frog.
---
You are welcome. Rifles and pistols have access to silencers allowing them to hit the 3.75x damage. That makes stealth a better build for them over bloodied. However, stealth doesn't work well in team events, so if you plan on spamming SBQ or something or always running with a team, bloodied may be more reliable damage.
---
Its part of the law of the wasteland where we need players to be raiders/greifers so if you don't want bone chimes to be disarmed then don't have them kinda of like if you don't want to be robbed then don't have nice stuff.
---
I’d copy all this and send it to Bethesda feedback and also put it on the Bethesda forum page.
---
I usually do solo, i have the perk cards for solo.  I like helping people out though
---
Right on, I bought both raider armor skins just so I could mash them together, lol.  It doesn't wind up nearly as eclectic as your setup because they are all the same color palate and similar in style  but I dig the fact that it's unique as I never run into anyone with the exact same appearance :)
---
Great idea! I'll be doing that for sure. Thanks for the reply.
---
Don't worry they do lower prices part of the atomic shop house cleaning where they remove a lot of items at once to prompt you to buy them before their gone.
---
&gt; I've happily spent $629.75 on Atoms
---
The man has purchased his B1tch1ng rights!!! B you NEED to listen to him..
---
I just want the darn backpack, i havent played in like 10 months and im enjoying the game again. Kinda silly those quests but oh well. I just kill like 3 stinwing but no barb :(
---
Is that even a good place to nuke?? Like is there anything there worth it?
---
Damn you’re so right my bad dude
---
You on Xbox?
---
\-&gt; Assaultclaw or Deathtron, sounds interesting
---
It went away after I re installed
---
It's more the inability to vats them that gets me killed.
---
While I'm not 100% happy with the pricing in the Atomic Shop, like I said, I happily bought the Atoms. It was a way of expanding the enjoyment I have with the game. It would have been nice to get a bit more for the cost though.
---
I never thought of that. It stayed a blast zone for about for about an hour or so afterwards, I walked through it myself, just a couple bloated ghouls and high level scortched but that was it. No traffic at all.
---
And that's true with the vending, I get more people buying my stuff when a couple of my friends are at my camp.
---
Challenges if you haven’t completed it yet is to scrap power armor pieces...
---
That's a great idea! Thanks!!
---
They made a change to 'mitigate', meaning to reduce the problem or issue.  Since there's no way to say 'it is now impossible for this event to happen under any circumstances', that's the proper term to use.
---
Since that time, have there been any reports of the same issue happening again?  Not the 2 or so times it happened before the mitigation, but since then.
---
And everyone of them looked the same.
---
I just now did the tadpole quests so i could use the black shovel backpack skin
---
Please god no.  The loot pool is dilluted enough already.
---
I spent my $60.00 on the pre-order and your right the game is CHEAP when it comes to entertainment/hr.
---
I have just under 1500 hours which is about $0.04/hr for fun... where else can you get that???
---
Apparently radiation damage still works for killing people.
---
Which challenges?
---
I’ve been asking Bethesda for this for months! Having initially misread the quest, I spent a day searching for a clown wendigo.
---
That's a little much, methinks. Make old employees who want to stay play the parts of the games they're responsible for. "You see that bug? You get to fix it. It doesn't just work!"
---
Get Quad one and make it automatic. Best event weapon
---
I dont even know how good back packs are i still need to unlock em haha. I feel like my build perk build is so random but yeah
---
Not really. I immediately hopped into my power armour and wandered into it. At no point during its time there did anyone go into it. I only ran into a handful of high level scortched and a couple bloated ghouls near the watch tower, no legendaries, so nothing special.
---
The bloodied is obviously great. The AP reduction one is pretty good too because it lets you reduce vats AP costs to zero.
---
Name of player in pet name would also help... just saw a sloth at a camp and it showed red so I waited and nothing... turned out to be players “pet”. 
---
If it had a name or an owner name that would help a little.
---
I have an extra 60 weight
---
I'm all for Bethesda holding off releasing new raider stuff (3rd atom shop update!), if they want to focus on squashing bugs.
---
Probably. For someone just starting out though, that can be enough to make you switch weapons lol.
---
Not bad, i have the excavator power armor with 9 power cores should i just always run with it ? I remember having no armor outside of power armor cause of weight problem so
---
Oh my I like that one!
---
I had an early camp near the Whitesprings. I figured I was far enough out to be clear of the nukes, until one day a nuke just sliced off one wall of my 4x4 square shack. I moved pretty soon after.
---
Sometimes If I can place a fence on a lower part of a slope I can snap another one on to it and it'll sink partially in to the ground. I've had better luck with the tire barricade sets. They count as floor decor so you can stick them on a rug and get them to sit wherever I need them. They're an atom shop item though.
---
Right on, good to hear people with a positive attitude to stuff like this.  Win or lose you should always end with a gg, yet some people around here equate pvp with murdering innocent puppies.  
---
It's just a game people, there's nothing you can lose in pvp or from getting your base trashed you can't easily replace ;)
---
Uhhhh.... well when ppl like you no life a game you run out of things to do.
---
I’ve been playing about three months about 3 hours a night and still have plenty to do.
---
😂😂 I didn't understand at first. Which is the worst part.
---
I know they often monitor their own forums but I agree the little fixes even aren’t getting fixed. 
---
For example, the cabinet that can’t be placed on the wall...lol yeah, small issue but seriously that’s been broke since day 1. (Yes I know that’s way low on priority levels). 
---
I’ve been playing since the beta and no plans whatsoever of going anywhere so they have me anyways...ha!
---
Bureaucracy and red tape are probably what's holding up a lot of the fixes unfortunately.
---
It would be great if all factions got new shop items and bundles. But Bethesda will probably not make several available at the same time, so this poll could be considered a survey on what faction bundle the players of F76 wants to come first. If this poll makes it happen for the winner faction of the poll (one can always dream), then a new poll can always be held afterwards for the losers, for a new motion to Bethesda.
---
Sfrapping them sometines give mats. Ive had occasional rubber and plastic off them wth scapper perk on.

Same!

Indeed. He could be Danse in disguise.

---
 good info..
---
They really get me with the camp building related items and skins...
---
LMAO.
---
Bet you can't just barely hit someone's camp!
---
Launcher: hold my beer!!!
---
As a semiauto rifleman the only 76 exclusive weapons I benefit from are the blackpowder rifle and the crossbow... My whole arsenal is the same as Fallout 4, no new assaults or snipers. But at least we have more choice than pistol builds.
---
Directions unclear, dick stuck in tree
---
Preach! And Thanks!!
---
I personally want Responders items but BOS an Enclave would probably have more unique an interesting items.
---
Three months in and still having a great time but you know I didn’t endure the beta or launch or leveling hacks or duping or secret room so yeah I can see how ppl like you are bored.
---
Oh and here is your Founder medal that no one cares about.
---
Yes sir!
---
I just don't understand how this stuff happens liek the casual armor lining that was missing and other things like that..
---
I quit using power armor a while back. I have a stealth build, much better without it.  I use the hazmat suit for nuke areas.
---
Wait back up. How much on atoms? I didnt know there was that much stuff in the store.
---
Depends on if it’s a double xp weekend or not.
---
If it is, I can grind xp for hours at a time. 
---
If not, I just take it slow and easy.
---
same lol.
---
We've already gone far beyond the point of 'cosmetic-only' and Bethesda didn't give a dime so they might as well give a gas mask it's right function
---
but I'm with you in the boat of Bethesda should have let the Atomshop be actually 'cosmetic-only'
---
Love this idea throw in some ghouls wearing different clown outfits and could nuke the area and get a supermutant behemoth dressed as a monster like Frankenstein's monster and have it like same challenge as sbq
---
Trash cans, bathrooms, and an outdoor smoking area with ashtrays would be a good addition.
---
Even if you go through all the effort and make this work, they will still get in and destroy your crops. If the game can't make then a path you your generator/wayer/food then it just spawns them inside the area they're at.
---
From map &gt; Challenges &gt; Combat &gt; Craft or Scrap Power Armor XX/76 worth 80 atoms when complete.
---
I take them to the Vault 76 exit, wait for a noob, and tell them how to enter the frame. Great early armor boost.
---
You can unlock a high capacity mod for the back pack an boost it up to 120 carry weight. With my build an armor I have 525 carry weight its pretty legit since I'm a collector / hoarder.
---
Had no idea that existed,thank you.
---
I’m wondering if there was someone there before you spawned in?
---
i complained about this months ago, very few people put up a fuss :/
---
Absolutely. It IS auto. It should profit from those perks.
---
Thanks eckserah, we'll bring this up with the team!
---
Truth, forgot about this
---
The easy, low-hanging fruit are the fixes that can save them the most at this point. There's still FO4 bugs in the game.
---
If you’re on PC the bloodied would be worth 5K caps to me.
---
In still going to be stubborn and try every Deathclaw :) 
---
Thank you very much for the info; I have updated my 'All The Obtainable Plans And Recipes' lists.

---
 &gt; Thanks eckserah, we'll bring this up with the team!
---
"Best" is a matter of perspective and opinion.  
---
Bloodied deals the most damage, full stop.  It's also a huge pain in the ass that forces you to spend a lot of your game time into an annoying mini game of never ending rad management.    
---
Catch a few too many rads, gotta pop a diluted radaway and then accrue just enough to proc nerd rage.  Nuke zone?  Gotta drop to \~50% rads so you don't just outright die to rads, then after you need to get those rads back to \~19%.  It never ends.  
---
People love seeing huge numbers when they kill shit but to me the main question I have is: why do you need to deal 2k damage to an enemy that only has 600 health?  Is all the hassles balancing rads worth it knowing full well you can still one shot that exact same enemy but never have to worry about getting your rads to \~19% ever again?  
---
Personally I used to have 3 bloodied builds and I've migrated down to just 1.  My non bloodied characters are absolutely capable of handling every situation in the game with no issues.  
---
So yeah I get the appeal of bloodied but imo there's plenty of other ways to excel in the game.
---
Sadly, probably true.
---
This. Every one I find I grab and drop off to people. This is what was done for me when I started. Thank you "yourboydanny". I've never forgotten.
---
I named the ones I have “.power armor name”. Like “.T51 Power Armor” The period pushes the name of the item to the top. Easier to quickly find.
---
Possum badges are the real end game.
---
haha... With their aggressive pricing, it's maybe 1/3 of what's available. And I usually buy bundles, and on sale items.
---
What do you typically use instead of bloodied?
---
They most certainly did not. The themes were similar, because they were all in the same region, but each one was uniquely detailed. Every area in each TES game so far was handcrafted. Same with Fallout.
---
Since the recent patch? My buddy has like 11 of the death claw extra claw mods. I've found 3 myself.
---
The only reason to ever take Daddy-O is to get addicted to it for a junkie’s build lol like does anyone actually take it for its actual buffs?
---
This gonna work
---
Damn dude. I've yet to see anything worth real money yet, just earned atoms. Maybe wastelander will break me.
---
Gunnilingus
---
Mods are obtainable, the plans to craft the mod yourself aren't. That's what OP is talking about.
---
Clit Eastwood
---
Aw man I didn't know that, I'm hardly there when they spawn. I thought there would be some rule as to where they can spawn at. I don't have the perks yet for the laser or missile turrets. Are they effective against high level mobs and do they destroy camp items?
---
Thats crazy, not sure im at how much i think my power armor gives me +100
---
Yep...Xbox
---
You can do events to get them instead of just challenges - not guaranteed but can often be a little less madness-inducing then trying to align all the conditions.
---
While I agree it's frustrating - we have to consider the monkey's paw factor here - what if you get what you wish for?
---
**Example:** The current alternative for a time-sink content grind is something similar to the  mr fuzzy tokens and that scares me more then the badges do.
---
PS the high cap backpack also has a fairly high DR cost so keep that in mind because I did not initially
---
Thanks for the tip. I think I have extra atoms to spare. I may not keep them out but it would look nice at least.
---
Excavator does give 100 but if you relog while wearing it you can get a bug to give 200. Then with the shocks installed you can have an extra 100 for each so 200 total.
---
That is a recommended place to find one. Someone else got to the stinging first. Gotta switch lobbies or find another spawn.
---
Exactly.
---
What even is the point then... They can't look good aesthetically AND they don't serve a purpose 🤦
---
For pve I don't think it matters all that much.  Like if op has a bloody explosive 25% less vats cost lever as the best rifleman option and 1\* bloodied assault rifle as the best commando option it would probably make sense to start off rifleman.  
---
Down the line it's easy enough to switch as the build is the same only thing that changes is commando perks instead of rifleman that uses the same exact SPECIAL stat.  
---
The other side is that the only time commando &gt; rifleman is vs bosses like SBQ, Arktos alpha, ISS, etc.  Rest of the time you will 1 shot mooks all day long with rifleman and use way less ammo.
---
he is talking about the trapper chest piece wich clips through outfits same thing was the case for raider chest pieces a while back (dont know if the raider chest is still bugged)
---
Not having enough people working on those fixes and over working them until exhaustion is also on that list of possibilities. People need to wake up to how negligent these gaming companies are in regards to it's workers.
---
Pay2win 🤔
---
Joking, btw
---
Rose's quests while being annoying - definitely had more . . . life in them then a lot of others.
---
Watching new or low players try to shake hands with a deathclaw always brings a laugh or two as well as watching people screw up the damage timing on the syringer.
---
Have to say you don't get that with many other quests *(which due to the way the game dev works - especially in this case - is always somewhat of a fetch quest)*
---
I think the problem is that for a lot of us we got them after we had been playing for a while and thirsting for something to do. After getting my first backpack I stopped actively seeking them and was just mindful of them. This way they were a great opportunity task. A lot of them got done without me realizing and by the end the reat were just a minor inconvenience away. The only one I thought unreasonable were the chemistry ones as they require me getting new perks. It helps to not rush for advanced backpacks the extra space one specially makes it much harder to switch in/out of power armor and the others lower the standards capacity. Now I have 3 special backpacks and find the only ones worth it are the ones that bring up your defense. I also got extra badges from something, but no idea where they came from as I never see them pop up on the event or dailies.
---
I do the same thing for weapons and PA.. but I use an "\*" good way to find it in a hurry
---
Thank you for the wonderfully quick response!
---
Yeah i left and rejoined couple of times and got one
---
I think it would be awesome if they could unionize, but that is a topic for another forum.
---
I get this a lot.  I think if you loot it empty it will stop.
---
The government really really really want you to have what’s in there.
---
It’s not a door Beth, it’s debris.
---
LOL OMG a 'Frankenstein'  Behemoth would be awesome!
---
yeah Bethesda has a too ancient and outdated management strategy I suppose, higher-ups declare months ahead what gets done or fixed, if some new bug arises it'll just get put on the list 'for the next months' and if devs can't explain how they could profit from 'fix A' directly then it probably gets put lower on the list even if it effects most of the playerbase
---
Shocks ? Also my leg broke and i lost all the boosts feels bad
---
You don't need to bring a lot of ammo if you are using Gatling Gun so weight isn't a problem.
---
5mm is like unlimited as you get a hell lot from mutants and Ultracite has to be made with Violet Flux, the DPS difference isn't that significant, and the speed provided by the speedy receiver is overwhelmingly handy.
---
But that made sense. The same with swords.
---
Good point
---
Thank you.
---
With dolly sods you can save insect parts and just bring them. The hardest to find is the bloatfly gland. Just have to remember not to scrap them or cook the roach meat.
---
Nah. People need to stop whining and realize this is a wasteland, not disneyland
---
for sure.. I really like the plushies..They are cute.. Only other items I seen that I "had to have" are the Excavator PA skins, Hunters rifle Camo skin, pink pip boy, and a few of the make my toon pretty items.  If I have to look at this toon for 1500 hours... she better be pretty!!!
---
High agility plus speed demon plus high criticals and concentrated fire. You can hit for 500 on headshots.
---
What do you think this is? 2019? 
---
Jokes aside no, there isn't but there really, really should be.
---
No, because that's the game. That's economy. Want to love it fast, low price, know what some people are willing to pay but not sell as fast? Price higher. It's one if my favorite parts of this game now. The market
---
Nice bud. I build a lot of CAMPS. If you want some inspiration for stuff feel free to look at my post history. I've posted a few videos of my most recent ones. Also here's a few links to some of my older builds picture galleries.

Have you seen the reference to "into the wild" yet?
---
There is a whitesprings shuttle bus sitting in the forrest at cranberry bog. Near the spot where the meat week event is, guitar inside.
---
Then put your camp nearby.
---
The missile turrets are great. They do not damage your assets. My camp is also in the savage divide, and I have 20 missile turrets that cover the entire perimeter and they make pretty quick work of anything.
---
Recently there was a patch that made it to where anything killed by your turrets, even while you are away, counts as loot you can pick up. I've come back to meat piles with legendary items in them occasionally. 
---
The main thing is to just be mindful of where the enemies typically come from, and if possible make sure you have atleast one missile turret pointed at every possible place outside your camp, and even one or two facing your camp in case they make it that close, or get spawned in past the turret's LoS.
---
Missile turrets are definitely effective. However, I'm not so sure about the laser turrets 🤔
---
Developers? Unlikely. Community managers? Certainly.
---
"I am a basic white girl on building at the end of the day. " what? Would a black man build a better base?
---
It is possible. I am assuming the person that launched it probably wondered around a bit and a few other people before they realized nothing was there and buggered off.
---
Just make sure you have multiple, not just one.
---
Haven't you ever came back to your camp and heard the noise of a mongrel attacking, only to find him inside of your locked generator room? This may also have to do with how assets are loaded, from the foundation up, allowing them to move past an area that should have a wall that just isn't loaded yet.
---
Well I like Starbucks and if I could I would wear ugg boots. So I am who I am and that's all I am.
---
They are a mod for the armor. You can probably find someone to mod it for you for dirt cheap or free. Or you can buy the plan to do it yourself from a vendor in White Spring but it's like 3-6k caps. You should also build a power armor station in your CAMP to repair if you're gonna be running power armor.
---
Exact thing with me, but there were three of them
---
I think I have a spare copy of the recipe in my vending.  I can check when I get home.
---
What about puncturing mod for power fists?
---
I don’t know what some people are willing to pay, hence my post. Some people “seem” to know, and they’re getting their information from somewhere. The question is, where?
---
Yeah, still gotta get around "scrap by accident"
---
Well I use power armor because it gives extra weight and armor itself weights alot... Im at 229 right now out of 235 without power armor
---
Have you tried adding the game to Steam and tried if Steam Input with the switch pro controller enabled works?
---
no, I never suggested everyone plays the same way, I said the majority of builds, in game and on nukesdragons, have at least 5 in strength.  also ew to cannibal.  also also LMFAO at the suggestion FO3, NV, 4, and even this game are FPS and not rpgs...  wtf are you even talking about?  go play Fortnite kid...
---
Im the Bot!
---
Hi The bot!
---
You get those by scrapping.
---
Oh, I do.  I always check to see if the scrap bot box is locked in a new camp I visit.  Sadly, most of the time it's locked. LOL
---
that ones learned from scrapping power fists
---
I was afraid you would say that
---
Yea.  L47 mothman with purple eyes, and the SB was L50 or 65, I forget which.
---
Last time I found those two working together was near the fissure just S of the WS golf course.  
---
Good times :)
---
I hear ya, and that's why it's addressed to Bethesda and not the developers or community managers. I'm certain they are doing the best they can with what they are given.
---
It's impossible to know.  Basic supply and demand type of ideas.  Set a price and just wait. If it doesn't sell, lower it.  Unless you're really hard up for caps, I usually just leave it at the default price or lower.  Kind of a "I dont care if it sells or not" concept.
---
If you REALLY wanted to find out, you could research the forums to find out what people are asking for versus what you have to offer.  Post about what you're looking to sell to see if anyone here bites.
---
and doesn't always necessarily make anything better... just different.
---
I dont understand why take out the legacy's there fun and was amazing to have chance to get one I hate cheaters but if they are able to keep the flow of legacies coming into the game then I'm all for it I didnt think that tse was much different than running bloodied or junkies I mean at this rate wont have much choice then everyone start using blooded if really want power. I dont care much I'm right at lv 200 my damage sucks and my damage resistance I dont like trying to switch cards or keep chasing a certain build type. Why I liked tse but I'm starting to go towards anti armor I just want to have fun and want to be able to carry a bunch of stuff lol and on the legacy's part saying they were op I thought that was the point to get crazy good guns so can have fun at end of game they keep nurfing guns and taking things out everything ends up pretty boring
---
That’s a little disappointing. Also, how do I pick a tag like you gave? Raiders, BoS, etc.
---
There's probably some truth to that...
---
To each their own I suppose.
---
The mod comes up regularly at the Watoga vendors though, and at 49 caps doesn't break the bank. I bought two of them yesterday - different server each time.
---
Yes please
---
And thank you for keeping up the posts.
---
I love the idea of number one. For two and three, however, since gaining pets requires perk cards that aren't restricted to end game level players, I think it would be better to make vaccines and hp boosts and such be quests you can complete to earn plans that don't require flux. 
---
Otherwise you're making it so that people who want to enjoy the full features of having pets have to wait until they're a high enough level to be reasonably able to get flux before they start using those cards. 
---
Yes, the game would benefit from some more endgame content beyond launched nukes and the queen, but I don't feel like vaccines and hp boosts for pets are the way to go for that.
---
My 1* bloodied lever does 1600 for sneak headshots. More if I put on the sneak damage perk or suppressor at night perk. I only have rifleman 1 and expert rifleman 1 (and lots of low hp perks) so I would say bloodied is best. Instigating is good but if someone hits it first you lose the extra damage. Antiarmour is only like 30% more damage
---
I think they patched the PvP for the 'character' when you're out in the wastelandes ,so they can't sneak up on you while one contests the workshop, but not the actual C.a.m.p. PvP
---
You can't lose loyal supporters. That would make them... not loyal
---
Well, I guess I will be hanging on to the one I have in my stash; if this isn't fixed soon, it might drive the price up :)
---
Drop them somewhere,  line them up in front of your camp, or line them up at Vault 76. I just drop the extras in front of my camp,  they stay there a while, eventually someone will grab one.
---
There is some option on the sidebar. I am on mobile atm, so I cannot quite remember where it is on desktop site.
---
If you want to get technical with the wallpapers, even the newest wallpaper (yellow flowers) is just a yellow version of an older wallpaper (blue flowers). Which is nice, yes, and I'll be grinding for the atoms to unlock it, but still. If they're going to keep recoloring wallpapers, may I suggest purple flowers? 😍💜
---
The quest is just going through a silo and launching a nuke, which you can do whenever you want.
---
I’ve gotten up to 8 from one server at the bunker. They aren’t super common in the raid but I’ve found a few. If you’re a decent level and have some friends I’d reccomend the raid for sure. They are pretty fun. Well except the one this week, it’s really tedious
---
Oh! Found it ty
---
What does it matter if they're tradeable? Traded, they're still in the same number of hands as before...
---
I wouldn't worry too much about it. I completed it myself solo 2 days ago. I enjoyed the quest but you don't exactly get any story or anything. You completed probably as intended. You could always run a silo solo for the experience but don't threat you completed it fairly ☺️👊
---
You can kill players with the radiation from nuke mines and you dont initiate pvp or get a bounty
---
Just go run a silo, you didn’t miss out on anything don’t worry. That’s just the introduction to the silos
---
I mean.. I do like E-Peen.
---
Yep, still only like the wood one. I dont care for the bright crazy ones at all. Litterally everything they have added these last few weeks is a reskin. Or the same skin on a different item.
---
Nah I don’t have this armour but when I get it best believe I’m at least gonna try it once haha
---
&gt;Stimpacks now weigh something but I can get a perk to make them weigh less?
---
Not logged in to the game at the moment so i can't check the exact name of the perk card I have enabled to lower chem weights (stimpaks included), but I believe the perk is called traveling pharmacist and I'm absolutely certain it's a strength perk.
---
Dude I can barely sell bulk gears...just take your bone shards out of the machine and make new chimes.
---
How about those that end the event in 5 minutes. It's like, how many times were they dropped on their head?
---
I had this experience the other day in person at a Lan Festival. Someone came up and asked if it was Fallout 76 we were playing and we told him ya, he asked to join up with us. He had played since the beginning alone and was in his 90's on level but said he was struggling some and we found out he also had no idea about a lot of inventory management tips and money making. He was so incredibly excited when we showed him these tips and then explained how mutations work in the game. Was fun to pass on the info and see how much fun he was having afterword.
---
We can blame the players who continue to do this and Bethesda
---
I used the hunting one in my kids room (they're into camping and the pioneer scouts) and have the blue flowers in my husband's and I's bedroom, but my favorite is definitely the wood one. Would love some Whitesprings based wallpapers.
---
That said player "sure got off the vendor fast" implies said player may not have been AFK.
---
I'm sometimes at a vendor for what seems like forever - mainly because I've been out looting, thus selling off all weapons, apparel, aid, and junk I've picked up, and I often have enough on hand to hit the 1400 cap limit in one sale session.
---
As you are likely aware, the controller response time when you scroll those lists can be stupid long.
---
OTOH, I'm mic'ed and in area chat, so if I notice someone enter the area, I'll make some comment so they know I'm activiely using the vendor.
---
We can have both.
---
Hey man, you can use LFG on xbox, it will be way more effective than spaming this sub.
---
It's not dead if it's still an issue.
---
This is the result of buying the game once and not having a subscription. 
---
I’m fine with it.
---
Then just have numerical limits. People don't need to spam 100 plushies.
---
Ok mate,never use that before
---
Oh yeah. I should be finishing my set off tonight. Def going to try it
---
To op, are you in pc? It seems like most of the complaints on it have been from pc
---
Would you if you were a developer? Imagine spending the last couple of years of your career working on a game. You know nothing is perfect, but you've done your best. "Let me check out how my work is received," you think, and you come here. I can think of better ways to spend my non-work time.
---
There's also a view that an idea presented by one person not in the employ of a company should not be accepted due to copyright and payment issues. If you present a great campaign idea with characters and everything, and it is used in a game, you would have a pretty good claim against the company. However, when many people ask for something or have a generally similar idea the community manager can take the aggregate to a development team and maybe something happens. We've seen that in some of the changes to 76.
---
But developers are people, too. I bet some have come here. They wouldn't be able to be open about their work.
---
 I have spent nothing on Atoms, and am not going to. If I can't scam up enough Atoms in the game, I ain't buying it. ;)
---
Awe man took me forever but I've got two spots that I've learned to check for him and mothman they show up in same spot. Biggest thing has to be night time or much much better to be night. Cranberry bog. Spawn at superior sunset farm run towards the thorn "star icon" and in between you can find him. There is a spot that is a random spawn that all kinds different thing's show up in the dry creek clearing. But after 8pm I believe I always go around 12-4 and have good luck. And once you see where the spawn location is you'll know what I'm talking about. I've seen sheepsquatch robots supermutants ghouls and the wild dogs all kinds oh and the mannequins standing in a circle.
---
 Other location is up northeast corner I spawn at east ridge lookout run north towards freddy's fears house of scares. There is and big hill in between these two locations just keep the street on your right at you run towards freddy's and run up the hill and at night of corse and I've killed mothman and flatwoods there few times.
---
Maybe this will help
---
I’ve had this, where the game just short of freezes just trying to scroll through your inventory, taking minutes just to sell a few items.
---
Im not sure about magazines, but there are no mining perks. The best method is to wear a full set of Excavator Power armor. Having both arms doubles mining yield.
---
Us an auto launcher. And herd them up jump up on something and clear the mob it 2 shots
---
You know a lot of players are now going to do this because they now know it'll crash the event.
---
Human nature means some people are just dicks
---
Because I'm sneakin' over here!
---
Yeah that would be nice. I could see that working. Most my CAMPS are kinda realistic wasteland stuff so I guess I just haven't found the correct places to fit em in.
---
And tip shoot him before he spots you so if it's the ones that flee you make him fight you
---
Apparently some stuff shows up in your camp budget as doubled if you replace them (example being when you change tiles on floors), so that might be something that happened to you.
---
I don't think so I'm pretty sure it's an intelligence perk. I may be wrong though.
---
Community managers keep a finger on the pulse of various communities, and pass that info on to the devs. Devs don't usually like to waste their time defending their design decisions, explaining why certain ideas are impractical, or fielding questions they can't answer. And there are better avenues to pass along bug reports.
---
Looks like they were aiming to nuke someone else's camp.
---
It was my understanding that patch 9 protected the camp in this situation because people trashing your camps when you owned a workshop used to be rampant.  It was kind of a two-part deal.
---
The first part changed it so that PvP only occurs within workshop boundaries; this prohibits you and the other player from being hostile toward one another if not within the boundaries, which is what keeps them from sneaking up on you out in the wastelands.  At the same time, they also made it so your camp can't take damage from someone unless you are hostile against one another.  Ergo, someone contesting your workshop cannot trash your camp unless hostilities between the two of you have also occurred outside the workshop's boundaries.
---
Absolutely true, you’re right. Usually if someone is AFK at a vendor I simply leave rather than wait, since I can always go elsewhere. However, I’m talking about the Purveyor. There’s only one of her in the server and you cannot sell her anything at all, nor can you buy much from her. There’s little excuse for being at her stand for 5 min. I imagine the player likely got off quickly and killed the scorched attacking him because he was in the room with the game but not playing, in which case it’s rude and thoughtless to leave your character actively at this particular vendor. I should have been more clear that this is only something I do when people AFK the Purveyor.
---
You need to increase your Preception, get the Targeting HUD or eat a Berry Mentat
---
The point is, it's been asked 23847238 times already, and asking again doesn't really add to the discussion.  That's the whole point of the rule.
---
I'm not sure I understand the purpose of this AMA.  Are you answering questions about datamining in general or something within FO76 that isn't public knowledge yet?
---
AH, ok thanks
---
I just redoenloaded FO4 and have that mod installed. It's a fantastic mod and I do wish they'd implemented it in FO76. I know how to craft something at a higher level or in a stronger armored version, but don't know how to fix up my low level gun to a higher level gun or take a light armor piece and make it heavy?!
---
The deathclaw plan?
---
Was it on the dead guy out front? I always drop a ton of extra stuff on him before I log out for low lvls.
---
Yeah people can be very cruel and unfair for sure but having the community manager (I’m assuming they work for the fo76 team) filter the info and pass it along is a good idea. And as a developer I would certainly have a social media manager, helps get info out and look for opportunities to improve the game and getting more money
---
That's not how verbal math works. They've lost my loyalty and my support... for now.
---
Fair point, I just think that making quests for that is a whole lot less “simple and implementable” than new recipes getting added to the game. I agree that dedicated quests should be added for this, but I’m also trying to make it simple for the devs.
---
I’ll edit the post to offer a non endgame alternative
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/df9l3u/psa_no_pet_is_safe_from_bugs_pet_ownership_is_100/
---
Agreed.
---
You can’t nerf human nature.
---
It sounds like the point of the rule is to silence ongoing issues.
---
Thank you very much for this, completely missed this!
---
Any question that you have in regards to the game.
---
    What is the drop chance of X Plan?
---
    Where can i obtain it?
---
    Does the scorchbeast queen scale?
---
This will hopefully clear out a lot of the misinformation regarding the game.
---
How'd you have a Scorched deathclaw and not have it rampage and destroy your camp?  My first pet deathclaw got scorched after some troll kited a SB to my camp(was in Toxic Valley) and after getting scorched, just started rampaging and destroying my camp and I couldn't do anything to stop it. I had to find another pet to tame(2hrs later of server hopping) and then put my original pet of of his misery. 
---
Since that attack, I've moved to a much more peaceful area in the forest. My new pet pet deathclaw has been happy in my camp for a good month now.
---
Idk if they do regularly but they gave us fridges which was a community idea more specifically one user who i dont remember off hand but there was some stink about it
---
Did you read the post that you just replied to???
---
I don't care if people have them. I only care that they are fucking up the market.
---
You can run around one shot killing everything in the wasteland if it makes you happy  just don't come into trading markets with your legacy weapons because it's not even close to being fair.
---
I don't think this works for Ultracite Ore though? Everything else yeah.
---
High level pets have a chance of spawning scorched or glowing. My deathclaw was stuck in a semi rampaging state (attack stance but no attacking motions, refused to patroll) till I pacified him, this turned his name from red to white/yellow and he patrolled normally.
---
Sadly pets scorched by scorchbeasts never can be pacified.
---
I put them into three categories. Decent, good and great. Decent weapons sell for 2500, good sell for 3750, great go for 5k. 
---
I'm sure I can get more for them. I routinely spend a lot more on weapons than I would charge. You could probably double my pricing scheme and still sell stuff in a good location.
---
I'm only selling stuff that I loot or get from the purveyor and at this point I have to pull something out of my stash to fit it in my vending machine. So it's all priced to sell.
---
That's half the appeal, annoying the shit out of others.
---
Thank you for downvoting me, I'll make sure to go **** myself the next time I have a question
---
Honestly, the stars on tameable just make players shoot them even more, heck I had people trying to goad me into PvP so they could kill my 2\* DC
---
It was a nice surprise finding a legendary to tame, but don't think its necessary ;)
---
The plan to craft the extra claw on the deathclaw gauntlet.
---
I totally speckled wrong, gonna need to stack some levels to swap perk points 😝
---
Then they'll be traded until someone doesn't want to trade it. I really doubt it's that's intrusive in the market.
---
I mean, if you're trading on the forums, you're paying too much anyway. I just got a bloodied/as fixer for 5k caps.
---
Just yesterday I spawned at a camp _right_ next to a deathclaw, and it attacked so I started filling it with lead.  Luckily i realized it was attacking a scorched behind me before I killed it, as it was someone's pet.
---
We need something that more clearly indicates which animals are pets, and I think pets need to be made essential, like dogmeat from fo4, where they can be downed for some period of time but not killed.
---
they haven't lost me, and that's what matters.
---
I think 2 shot for consistency
---
You don't even need to pick up the remains. Just talk to the curator and that shuts him up. It's what I did a day or two ago and I haven't heard from him since even after multiple server disconnects.
---
Avoidance may be the best policy with this, seems only anecdotal evidence is available, all this time and there is no definitive answer.
---
Thanks though!
---
I'd scrap or drop any empty frames. unless you have them to spare, remove the fusion core first.  If you have custom painted the parts, you have to remove the paint before you can do anything, otherwise, the part is destroyed on drop.
---
If you are so inclined, keep a full set of each type you have thats L45 or 50.
---
Although you cannot sell the frame, I seem to remember seeing the separate parts at bot vendors.
---
So ... you can 
---
1. find a lower level player and give the set to them in person 
---
2. sell the parts to a bot and scap the frame
---
3. take the stash weight hit and put them in your vendor...IIRC, the T60 right leg is/was hard to find in the wild.  
---
Or .. 
---
just drop them.  Another player that can use them may or may not find it before you log off or the server resets.
---
You can't realistically change a 2-door car into a pickup, or a laptop into an ATX. The bases of armor are the same.
---
It's just cosmetic, no headware in the game gives bonus armor lol.  The gas mask does work though.
---
If any of you are doing a Queen nuke on PC later, let me know, and i will prove for you that you dont need to mess up the game for others.
---
After the Bios tweeks i did in another thread in here, the most i get is a 1 / max 3 sec lockup, no more full or long lockups.
---
I have had several of my team friends with me in queen fight, just  observe and the have not experienced anything at all.
---
On a Ryzen 2700x and a new 570x mainboard...
---
I never keep my trigger pressed for a very long time, bit do semi long burst fires with my BE gatling plasma inside my Strangler tin can :)
---
The problem is that the same weapon or armor piece will have different values according to the build of the buyer. 
---
Some rolls are inherently better in general. Like +swing speed and +strength on any melee weapon. Or ffr +vats on automatic weapons.
---
Well ... the Excavator PA comes to mind ... quadruples your output
---
Regardless of any negatives about 76, the positives of it can and likely will be used to enhance the next mainline Fallout.
---
No, but you can add some extra material to a shoulder pad.
---
They could have saved scrip to max limit and been shopping slowly based on what they wanted. 
---
I can easily spend 5 minutes there with 1000 scrip.
---
It's a problem that will not go away. Markets need regulations, you probably wouldn't like it if the SEC let billionaires manipulate the stock market.
---
...yet
---
Link pic please?
---
Nuka stash, Nuka girl suit and whatever the red floor was called. Essentially anything red, white and Nuka-Cola!
---
I believe it works for all mining nodes. Besides that super-duper helps when converting.
---
Its just reddit mate ... some people downvote everything but their own stuff
---
PvP only occured within workshop boundaries and one of them was still destroying my home CAMP. I'm well aware they were in a group due to their actions afterward, as well as them going after the munitions factory, together, immediately after leaving my CAMP.
---
I have pacifist mode permanently on unless I'm claiming a bounty on a wanted player (where I turn it off immediately after and make sure they get their junk back). I did not engage any of them outside of the area.
---
Oh yeah, let's compare trophy legacy items to billionaires.
---
there is a bot that auto downvotes on this sub it's been around for a while
---
7600 Atoms, proper reward lol
---
I just blueprint the machine with the lettering on it
---
Don't tell me you're an occupy wall St type leftist who is suddenly pro capitalism because you're the billionaire with your legacy gear.
---
Grahm and Chalky walked right by my pet deathclaw, Angel the other day. Her healthbar is also red when you look at it. They just ignored each other, I even stopped Grahm to see what he had. I think she made 2 new friends that day.
---
I wish the mosaic floor tile would return, as well as the hazmat skin for my zerker build.
---
It's also good on the skin ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
All good man. The cash I spent on eq2 and world of warships makes up for it.
---
I didn't know that, that's pretty evil haha
---
Fucking dead
---
Very nice of you :)
---
Could you check both the scout masks for me ?
---
Don't think any of them drop at all after patch 13.
---
Urban forest scout and Urban Scout.
---
Some claim they do, but are more rare, but haven't seen any real proof.
---
👉🏼🚪
---
Agreed, I haven’t tried to get one yet but my understanding is that it’s a process so I respect players time and energy getting it... so having it yellow maybe like the Collectron is or non hostile creatures would be great. 
---
If it’s in CAMP it also shouldn’t be able to get killed
---
I use Hard Lemonade a lot. It’s not difficult to craft and neither are the rest of the items. I don’t even have a farm at my base. I make one trip to Billings Homestead and I’m good for a week or two.
---
2 shot is better vs full health enemies and executioner is better vs low health enemies.  There is no clear "best" for all situations between those 2 options imo.
---
Same, although my group and I are really waiting for the ability to make our own server. Assuming they follow through on adding that functionality.
---
In and of itself it doesn't bother me that someone could damage my CAMP. What bothers me is that I'm set to pacifist mode and should have only had the PvP contained within the workshop boundaries.
---
It was the cheap shot, "ha ha let's gang up on a player while he's building and then break his expensive stuff while he's distracted," crap that bothered me about it. Sure, I opened myself up to PvP. I also lost. Fair. CAMP should bot have been allowed to be touched.
---
Nice! I'll have to stash a few away.
---
With enough data you can know a lot. If we could track all the weapon sales we could know in real time. We “know” the value of stocks in real time. Surely we could track this.
---
This time it was in a bag. The dead guy is a good spot too! Hard to miss and most folks loot them.
---
The rulers here want a more lively discussion set, and I don't really blame them for that, at least on principle.  Having every Xth post about the same subject doesn't make for a healthy community discussion, and if you look at it from the outside, makes for a pretty boring sub to browse.  It's not about silencing issues, it's about promoting a more interesting place to visit.
---
Ah, I saw "AFK" and "vendor", but completely skipped over "Purveyor."
---
That makes a huge difference in my repsonse.  
---
The only way I could give benefit of the doubt at the Purveyor is the player had a 4 digits of scrip to turn in....even so, purveyor transactions are usually speedy...can't imagine more that a couple minutes to burn that off, even at discount pricing.
---
Oh my god! YES!
---
Decent, good and great are highly subjective though.
---
Nope. And none of the raider gas mask variants provide environmental resistance even though other atom shop items like the space helmets do
---
I'll try it out tonight and update!
---
excavator PA + superduper when smelting.
---
Hahaha.I will see myself out.
---
Can you explane how it works LFG?
---
Ok so there’s some objective measures. We could come to a standard base price (at a given time frame) based on this. 
---
I just wish all the trade data was available then we’d see what market really is
---
&gt;Burying him doesn't shut him up. 
---
It does if you stay the hell away from the Toxic Valley and neighboring regions.  About as close as I get is the munitions factory.

---
Please. I play in pacifist mode but I still see players try to kill my Angel. I can understand, seeing a deathclaw at someone's camp can be startling but she's harmless to players. I think a white healthbar(indicating essential and friendly) would be great.  She's great defenses as well, for the few low level mobs that wander over from Kanawha Nuka Plant.
---
But at the same time people are bitching about the lack of new stuff to load into their camp.  And about the camp budget.  And about new content.
---
I'm with you personally, they could hold off everything but bug fixes for a while as far as I'm concerned.  But other people have their own priorities, so no matter what you do, it will piss some people off.
---
Actually there is at least one... it’s only 1DR though.
---
Your analogy is terrible. 
---
You realize they can basically just print more money, while legacy items are severely limited in availability, right?
---
You may be thinking of the perk that makes chems more effective. I have those enabled as well and I'm pretty sure those are in intelligence.
---
Yeah, doesn’t work on Ultracite. But it is 4x on everything else.
---
The analogy was actually about you being a hypocrite.
---
Make the recipe obtainable via a quest so that even though the recipe doesn't require flux, you still had to put some extra effort into earning the recipe.
---
Which happens to silence the issues. And seeing 2-3 threads complaining about this every few days is hardly an issue.  Can't say I'm concerned about those who don't play this game browsing this sub or not. 
---
Hmm. Where did I last hear about an institution ignoring the issues for the sake of being "interesting.". Oh, right. It was the news media. Look where that got us.
---
...yeet
---
Yes, it was obvious that's what you're attempting to say. I'm just saying your brain isn't thinking very well.
---
Eight?!   Just from the military wing?  Or are they found in other areas of the bunker?
---
You may be right
---
Ok, fair enough I see your point. It seems (i say seems because im basing it off other posts here as i can no longer see your OP) you have AOE mutations that are hitting these other players and that's what's starting pvp.  This is one reason I got rid of those mutations, that and the visuals from them irritated me.
---
Maybe I'd take you more seriously if your argument had substance and wasn't just another legacy owner arguing to remain relevant.
---
Yes and no.  There are plenty of things that fall between those categories, and that will be a personal choice.  But there are plenty of things that simple don't fill *any* role in the game, and outside of their scrip value, will rarely if ever be worth anything.
---
The other issue is, with the 'age' of many of the characters here (level or experience), 'great' is really broken into a couple camps:  1) This would work perfectly well, and 2) this is perfect and the only thing I care about is perfect.  1 will get you a lot of caps frequently.  2 is no longer even being sold, so don't even bother pricing them.
---
(I have sold a lot of 2's, even at 25K caps, they disappear from my shop in no time.  I have, and continue to, sell 1's but fewer and fewer people can/will settle for them, and they take forever to move).
---
I'll definitely check into this. To be honest I haven't setup my perk cards towards any  specific build, so it's something I need to do some more research on for sure. Thanks for the info!!
---
 Two shot is useless. Destroys accuracy.

Go play runescape
---
I look at my CAMP as my home. It's in the wasteland and I built it myself, so it's a bit ridiculous for it to look like a castle, thus it's simple. However, it should also be sturdy since I live there, so most of it is made with brick walls. Yes, this is the wasteland, so a fancy house makes no sense, but on the other hand I want where I sleep to be cozy, so it's perfectly reasonable for me to put pretty flowers in the room my husband and I sleep in and then put the hunting wallpaper in my kids camping themed room. I try to make my house look like the other houses around the wasteland, but intact and reasonably clean since it was built *after* the nukes were dropped.
---
The actual best armor to sneak around in is shadowed wood
---
But i got board
---
They should unlock dmg in the lobby, and make it a melee weapon free for all.
---
But if they do, and you have certain mutations, all bets are off.. - Right?
---
That requires known which servers to get on.  You set a price based on this data and could server hop for days and not find anyone willing to buy. 
---
Which is why I added the research the forums and post about it to maybe entice sales.
---
Where did you find yours? I've had 2:2 for finding my pet deathclaws in the Cranberry Glades, in the parking lot. I've not found any other tameable there, yet.  My story is that I found an abandoned deathclaw, lost in the parking lot and I came to take her home.
---
I kinda love and hate the TES caves, because you know, there is always another cave AGAIN.
---
lame!
---
[Did someone say settlements?](https://media.giphy.com/media/utANe8Y2fGD8k/source.gif)

Someone did a random low level area earlier and my husband and I were watching the 4 lowbies in that area to check if they got out. We fast traveled over to get some photo ops with the nuke hitting and were nearly screaming as it hit when we saw one of the poor newbies get vaporized since they didn't leave in time.
---
Nice bar, almost as nice as mine.
---
Also, having them stay inside the CAMP would go a long way ... I can't even count how many times I have to pick up my Elvis from the chinese neighbors (living next to a liberator spawn)
---
Just wanted to confirm this for anyone wondering. I've had a little Halloween display for a bit and it DOES let you place both the witch hat and skull mask, in addition to the plastic pumpkins :)
---
maybe they overwrote something with the last patches, where the 'workshop PvP' script locks the PvP to the workshop but somehow when fighting the other dudes the 'normal PvP' script still triggers :/
---
Once you get strong enough, executioner will be your favourite. It feels like a "late instigating" because you hit once and the second shot finishes the job. 
---
One of my favourite weapons is an executioner faster swing Knuckles I use with my ninja.
---
It makes the power armor you install it on look exactly like the picture. If you use Pale Rider, the T51 design on a T60, it will look like a T51.
---
usually, yes :)
---
Month...? Cosplayers? 🤣
---
Enjoy the silver ya filthy animal.
---
It's so funny when someone got their camp nuked.
---
Yes, this, exactly. But mostly because I want to tame an orange tabby and name him Ser-Pounce-A-Lot but have been told kitties have one hp and this means you'll be lucky if they even survive the trek back to your camp.
---
I'm chairman of the board
---
they aren’t banning people for using mods?

During there event. Otherwise in some random event spawn locations.
---
Thought that was a bugged description and it doesnt actually give a dr when worn?  You're talking about the tattered mole head right?
---
Sounds nice. I've done a bit of everything from a single player home - full town. If you want to check them out I have them up in my post history. I'd like to see yours too if you have a video or something.
---
I asked about this here yesterday and someone said that only rads from grenades can hurt another player.
---
I think they are missing out on a Mothman Halloween event
---
It's okay that you find it a bad value.  Unaffordable doesn't suggest your broke only that you have determined the value is not affordable.  It's a basic freemium model that targets whales, not you.
---
Braxon's Quality Medical Supplies.
---
From the spawn point, go up the hill a bit. If a Squatch isn't there you might have random place holder mobs or legendaries. Server hop and try again.
---
You can also try the area around Welch Station, A Squatch is often fighting Moleminers near some destroyed buildings in the area.

---
Oh, so super rare spawn then I guess?
---
Nah. I think it’s so people can wear kooky hats without stressing about min/maxing their stats ;)
---
Its actual endgame content i mean what do you expect? It should be harder than excavator because its free. I love it there making this game like runescape worth quest locked content, it's great, i mean it only takes like 2 hrs to get the pack but the upgrades a bit harder having to do camptales, maybe give tadpole badges for forrest/toxic/ash area and possom badges for mire/savage/cranberry scout dailies as a 25% drop or somthing. 
---
 if your prepared and so the running archery and hunting
---
Syringer plink somthing down then bash it with a syringer btw
---
Do you know why? I’ve heard this a bunch but never seen an explanation. I’ve been using a two shot lever for a few weeks and haven’t noticed a huge drop off in accuracy.
---
Yep, had to hop for a while
---
I just got it on some store credit I had because I figured why not, it's been a while since launch and i love living in the Fallout world. Damn, I'm actually really enjoying it. I wish there were NPCs. That's the only thing really. Otherwise this game seems great.
---
I've begin to use that as well :)
---
sounds like you and the hubby just wanted to help out, i give ya complete respect for that. i personally have never gotten stuck in a nuke zone before a launch, like you i just travel to closest none zoned location to get a good photo op. 
---
i got thrown off by where it was launched, never seen one in that area before. always been the bog or white springs
---
I thought that was learned through scrapping DCs?
---
it is possible, one of my best friends in the game has a camp literally beside me to the north of my camp..... if he had of been on at the time his camp would have been right on the border of the nuke zone, i think he would have gotten destroyed
---
Hm, good to know. My level 21 Angel already scares the lower level players that come around, I've even seen level 11s take a wide detour around my camp to avoid her. I'm sure a level 91 glowing would be even better lol.
---
&gt; No, because I don't want to mess with having to craft those items or remember to check buffs. 
---
Gaming is so haaard
---
&gt; dont find it that hard to make caps, I probably make 10-15k just from playing the game a few hours on weeknights. 
---
Ohhhh... you're so so 'leet  🤣
---
But couldn't you say the same for body armor?
---
I kept them at first because I did not have a shovel. Then I just decided to for the hell of it.
---
I will try to look into this for you, and thanks for the interest.
---
The problem with 76, unlike TES, FO3, FONV and FO4 is that the map is too easy to explore fully.
---
TES is caves and dungeons galore
---
FO3 is twisty winding subways leading to hidden areas with a wide wasteland dotted with interesting buildings to explore
---
FONV has twisting canyons and the same smattering of buildings
---
FO4 has the greater Boston area and plenty of highs and lows to see
---
FO76 on the other hand.  It does have plenty of great sights to see, and in many ways has more towns and cities too visit.  The problem it has though is that each of those places is limited.  Only a few buildings have interiors, only a few landmarks have interior cells.  There are no cutoff city areas similar to FO3 that you have to pathfind to.  SuperDuper marts are a good example. Most are just boarded up and unexplorable.  Most major interior cells are visited as part of main or side quests.  The few that are not are very small with only a few floors to explore, not like the sprawling interiors you found in FO3 and FO4.
---
Ruins are the equivalent of skyrims dungeons HOW DO PEOPLE NOT GET THIS
---
Hmmm maybe they fixed it. I’ll try next time I’m on.
---
So far I haven't. I did come back once and heard my generator blow up but no enemy was around and I have seen the wall that encloses the generator broken. That's why I thought they had to go through defenses first.
---
Trash song in a trash game? so meta.
---
Im using 6 at them moment
---
Get off the trade forums. I don't use them, only those with too many characters and caps go there. You're literally asking to be price gouged by using forums. I literally have one legacy weapon I found early and will never trade it because I love gauss rifles. You're being obtuse at this point. And a complete ass.  Also, insane. You just want to feel righteous. Gtfo.
---
Mutations aren’t limited. Im not sure what the issue is tho.
---
I'll try that when I get the points to unlock them.  Legendary loot waiting for me when i get home would be great lol. If only the scavenger bot would be able to collect it or any regular drops.
---
How do you get scammed in this game? I haven't traded with another player yet only used their vending machine

You jumped on a thread from last night and still have yet to make an argument as to why trading legacies is beneficial to the game despite Bethesda attempting to remove them 10 months ago.

Put your legacy on display and move on if you don't care about trading it. That has nothing to do with this topic.

just completed the quest twice and got NO plans for rewards.
---
Thanks, we were hoping to maybe drop off some plans for them. I have to wonder if they were tabbed out or something and they missed it since it was on PC.
---
I understand that, but I'm level 20, and only a few missions into the main quests. Each and every time I go to one of the main quests they are at least level 40, 50, or 60. My point is we shouldn't have to level THAT much.
---
I don't know the exact location, but head west on the highway from the red rocket workshop and you'll find a scb, deathclaw, and sheepsquatch
---
Instanced vaults for building would be cool. A lot of people seem to be doing the underground glitch but I dont care for them. I built under a bridge with my bunker on my alt wich is technically underground but that's the closest I've gone with it. The technology is definitely there maybe one day. Hopefully after Wastelanders they start to look at revamping CAMP an stash systems.
---
The best armor for headbanging is metal.
---
How many unreleased items are actually floating around in the files? I remember in a datamine for the freestates atom shop bundle there was a picture shown of wood armor *with a mask*, painted, but I don't think it was ever added? There's also the bull barrel for the .44 with even shows up in the winter camo skin picture from NW, but we can't get the mod. There's weapons with open mod slots like the death tambo, but no mods.
---
I hadn’t considered the idea of a BF sale in the atom shop. Would be nice for them to bring back all the stuff that’s left the shop so those who missed out have a chance at some cool stuff.
---
I've got an AA fire rate fixer.
---
The topic has nothing to do with the Fixer it's about legacy weapons and their impact on the market. The Fixer was only an example of what's to come with Wastelanders. Sorry if you misunderstood that.
---
Scaling doesn't work that way in any game I've played, certainly not in any online games anyway.

Light and Heavy Raider Plans can only be obtained from Signal Strength.
---
Sturdy Raider Plans can drop from:
---
- Signal Strength
---
- Daily: Someone To Talk To 
---
- The Messenger (Savage Divide Region) 
---
- Uranium Fever 
---
- Distinguished Guests 
---
- One Violent Night 
---
- Guided Meditation 
---
The way it works (only for Signal Strength) is that:
---
Player level &lt;15 - only light plans can drop
---
Player level &lt;25 - only light and sturdy plans can drop
---
Player level &gt;=25 - heavy, sturdy, and light plans can drop
---
Signal Strength can drop all Raider underarmor plans as well as Raider armor mod plans. Or even none at all. Since it's main story, you can only use one character per quest attempt.
---
Welcome to the grind.
---
Which is what you do when you upgrade the armor piece. But you'll never make a plate carrier into an EOD suit.
---
that's a very interesting point. the erstwhile saving grace/hope of 76 is (supposedly) eventually all those locations would be filled out.  if every house, building, location got the tattoo parlor treatment that we saw....
---
ppl didn't like burrows, but i sure did and hoped that we would see more of that
---
All locations are trash compared to Whitespring, Prime and Harper's Ferry
---
You aren't meant to just go straight through the story line. It's supposed to lead you to a new area so you find new side missions and new areas to explore. You can got to Whitespring and fight the ghouls at level 5 but your are going to die a lot. The game can't scale enemies up and down for every player when the enter an area where a higher level players has already been.
---
Okay that map is very helpful! And Borderlands, Destiny, The Division... all those have proper enemy scaling for PvE.
---
Sounds like if the first shot takes you to 40% the second would do the job regardless. Ex would be good for sniping deathclaw, Yao guai, etc
---
Hi moving out, I'm Dad.
---
Was this on Xbox on Monday afternoon by chance? If so my crew launched on a griefers base while we kept them busy in pvp.
---
Especially when it should literally just be a simple as adding or removing components
---
Does it really make that big of a difference if I add and then remove 3 rolls of toilet paper?
---
I spent hours/weeks to get that PA and I'll be damned if I take it off. I will rub it in everyone's face while I hold my vault flag high. I will pass out baskets of sour grapes to the peasants for I am now a Strangler God.
---
I've got a plastic pumpkin, gum drops, Halloween skull mask and an Upper Skull in my display case right now, for Spooktober
---
sometimes, late at night -- i like to wildly speculate: (when they said instancing technology for raids i thought it meant like a randomized dungeon every time u ran it)  imagine if it was like daggerfall 2, and like every dungeon was random, just modular vault sections?  "that zax has powers over time and space, y'know..."
---
I agree hate the new like the old 1
---
There is a TON of stuff that is in the files but not in the game.
---
They have even categorized things that have been designated cut content but left in the game files.
---
Is the chance of any tamable creature spawn equal, or are some truly rarer than others?
---
The candy cane skin
---
I'd really like to understand if the dense combat armor plans still drop, I haven't seen one since early in the year...if they do drop what are the chances and from where. 
---
Thanks for this effort folks!
---
The mods haven't deleted anything because I haven't broken any rules.
---
You on the other hand are continuing to troll.
---
One has to wonder why you are so invested in promoting this mediocre weapon for such a high price.... but in any case I think I made my point and no one is going to buy that thing for some tens of thousands of caps :)
---
Also your two alt accounts that keep you at +2 and leep -2 to any comments you don;t like is pretty obvious and is  going to get you into a heap of trouble with the Admins sooner rather than later :)
---
Why Harpers?
---
Wait is the wendigo wearing the clown costume or does the player have to wear a clown costume
---
It is. My big iron build does just that.
---
Would you want to take down the scorchbeast queen with a level 10 pipe revolver?
---
There's plenty to do in the game and plenty of side quests to work on that are lower scaled than that. It's a really big map. Go explore and find overseer holotapes in the Ash Heap. Do side missions like the one that starts at Wavy Willards in the Toxic Valley. I waited until level 40 to do Rose's quests. I get the frustration, but there's more to do than just the main faction quest.
---
Ding ding ding!
---
Where it at tho
---
One thing that makes 76 feel smaller to me is that there's little reason to go to the Forest region area after like level 50.  The same can be said to some extent for the ash heap and toxic valley as well.  I spent the vast, vast majority of my time in the savage divide and cranberry bog after level 50.
---
In Fallout 4 playthroughs, I was all over the map pretty much for the entire duration.
---
Cosmetics aside, it would only buff non PA builds furthering the disparity between PA and non PA users.  PA desperately needs some love.
---
Okay, that makes a little more sense. It's just highly frustrating because I only have a few missions, and I'm not sure I can do any of them. Which requires me to wander randomly until I find quests just to level me up to do what I actually want to do. Might be just the way I like to play, or the fact that it's entirely different from traditional Fallout in the sense that I'm required to do these things before heading on.
---
That would be neat for 76.  I never got into WoW.  I would assume there is some way to extract the data on what some of the more sought after items up but I can't see how you'd get that from the game other than frequent of items bought or sold.  I see online forum sale/trades taking place more often than not.
---
I haven't experienced that yet but I have noticed that there is a infinite reloading glitch. I just got a good lever action rifle so i don't know if that's a new bug.
---
Yes, please. It's too much effort right now for something that can be gone just a minute after you've earned it.
---
I hope not. I really don't understand this trend of putting fishing in every single game
---
Take it further and have a radio station with a human dj? Not 24/7 but on the weekend evenings maybe. That would be awesome.
---
Why not.
---
I don't know how people can fight that "queen" or did so many golf course runs. I could only play it enuff to get 2 chars up to 50 and 100s, got to bite the bullet and level up a couple more so I don't have to respect everytime I wanna play another build.
---
Guess so. 1400 in the Atom Shop for the accountant. ;)
---
I get confused by these “commando is better” posts.  How is commando better when a good rifleman build with a decent gun kills 99.9% of adventure mode enemies with one bullet?  It’s way more efficient than commando, so you’ll save money.  Which means you can buy better gear, which makes you stronger.  The only time Commando is better is on a long fight (SBQ), and there aren’t many long fights in this game.
---
" This will hopefully clear out a lot of the misinformation regarding the game. "

It is October. No better way to get in the holiday spirit than RP a character from the best Christmas movie of all time.
---
With all the perk cards you’ll hit for well over 2K on a typical shot.
---
I have like 19 mutations. No cap
---
The Messenger in my opinion would be the best to grind for the shielded. I believe you can still purchase the first three at the vendors. Also my crew and I have yet to get any kind of raider armor. We range from lvl 250-500 I'm curious if anybody has recieved sturdy raider plans from those quests.
---
Try to keep your gear up to date and scrap any weapons and armor you find to unlock mods. You can make 1400 caps a day selling to the robot vendors which is also a good goal to aim for to help you buy better gear. If you are exploring near a train station, kill the enemies and sell all the weapons and junk you don't need for caps. There are a lot of players selling good leveling gear in the Forest region for decent caps now. This fallout forces you to build less of the do it all pack mule that the previous games allowed many of us to do. I'd also recommend picking up the Blocker perk card since most of the enemies are melee oriented. Check all the plans at the train stations to get a feel for price to. You can often find good plans cheap from player vendors but it also good to know a baseline so you don't buy the overpriced stuff.
---
nah this guy just went full picker and snatched up all the good stuff first.  I kid I kid

Ho-Ho-Ho.

I’m with you bud. I’ve done everything I needed to in the game, got some decent endgame loot and spent a week building an awesome camp. Realised there was literally no point in grinding for anything so had to put the game down for a bit. 
---
Logged on today but nothing has changed. I’m hoping Wastelanders really will be the update we need.
---
For what it's worth, wait until you are at least level 25 to finish Signal Strength so you can at least get a shot at getting heavy Raider armor plans.
---
Did you happen to use a rad x by accident?
---
That can be looked at separately no? I do think it should be buffed for PA users considering they have way less than non-Pa
---
Use concentrated fire with nothing but face shots as well.🤣
---
Ugh, I have a 1 star deathclaw and felt so fucking cool. Now I have anecdotal evidence of some nerd with a 3 star? 
---
You should've taken him out.
---
there is a huge chain of your posts below that say REMOVED and a few more that say DELETED. you aren't fooling anyone chump
---
As long as they are instigating shots for that one hit kill yes
---
Edit: and gun fu
---
Roses quest quickly takes you to areas where down-scaling is not applicable (savage divide and mire.)
---
Following the overseers quest will keep you more or less in level appropriate areas.
---
Te best thing to do is back burner Roses mission until you have gained experience and levels working on the other questlines.  
---
The benefit is the rewards you get from Rose will be much better.  
---
I did not return to rose the first time until about L54.  The reward was worth the wait.
---
General guide:
---
Explore the forest until about L17.  Find camp mcclintock and riverside manor.  Explore Charleston.  At about L17-20,  go N to the big alligator (toxic valley) until about L27.   At 27 or so, head south. You may be able to do whitesprings non-nuked.  It will be difficult, but doable with the right weapon.
---
At L30, head towards the ash heap (bottom of the map).  Find the mining headquarters.
---
At 45, go anywhere on the map you want.
---
While you are roaming the respective areas, figure out what weapons work well for you.  Do events, do side missions.  Walk, dont fast travel.  You'll discover more, gain more XP, and save some caps.
---
Yeah, It appears I just had a very different idea of how the game works as far as leveling goes.
---
Ms. Patsy
---
I kept grinding Signal Strength repeatedly and pulled shielded from there. I did get sturdy raider arms though last night from The Messenger.
---
And, cmon, we have to admit that a lot of those caves are duplicates of each other with some different mobs thrown it. I still liked finding them but as soon as I entered them I was like "oh, it's this cave again."
---
They can still have an outfit override though. Coming from MMOs and other games it's just strange to have one piece of outfit have no stats and is just for looks. A helmet nonetheless. The stats can even be SPECIALS and nothing more if it's a concern for min/max
---
Prick 5,000
---
So damn good
---
I came from vault 76
---
All good. Just wanted to let you know that that's the only quest that can drop those plans and you have to be at least 25 for heavy to be able to drop. Since it's a once per character quest, you only get one shot.
---
Thanks that is good to know.
---
I don't really recall many similar caves in Skyrim but you know, full of caves as if they can't make anything but caves.
---

How is the VATS usage between the 10mm and the plasma pistol? You previously did some testing with the reduced VATS cost legendary effect and mentioned that laser/plasma pistols/rifles have different AP VATS reduction with their automatic barrels vs. automatic receivers.
---
I assume low VATS cost for your 2-shot FFR auto-plasma pistol is the reason why you use it with a VATS build.
---
Didn't know that, sweet
---
You guys have an official statement in this thread from a Bethesda rep.   
---
Bug was fixed 4 weeks ago and zero occurances since thence.   
---
Why are y'all arguing as if it's still at thing?  
---
Even if it happens, they can and will restore stuff.
---
I wouldnt know, i sell all my rad x immediately so i dont do it by accident.
---
Nice pic!
---
No you didn't.
---
Possibly my favorite thing I've gotten so far. So wierd and dumb and cool.
---
Haha there wasn't much good stuff/ stuff I needed aways. If there was I'd offer to buy it at least. My stash by itself is at 780 because I need to move stuff to my alt lol stash is such a bad mini game
---
I think you are inhumane..scorched are basically ill people who need help...what next I suppose you'll be killing endangered species like bats because they're a bit of a hand full and a bit bigger than normal...wasteland Hitler!
---
I get that, but I’m just putting them in the correct order.  To me, Rifleman is clearly the build most people should start with.  You’re efficient, will make more caps, etc.  then you can build another less efficient character that’s a Commando or one of the other builds.  When I talk to players who tell me they never have many caps, this is one of the major contributing factors.  Have a solid build, prioritize your gear correctly, etc.
---
I laughed. Have an upvote for smartassery and general excellence.
---
I want to wear it with the wasteland trapper mask
---
It appears I had a much different idea of how the leveling works in the game. I just dislike that type of restrictive gameplay, but I'll learn to get past it because I do enjoy the game.
---
 have you tried gently kissing his face with a mutant super Sledge?
---
Ah yes a joke from 1960 dnd, I see.
---
Even with maxed out class freak? Because I have that maxed out and my SPECIAL is showing the same on my pipboy as it is in the perk menu. I did, however, go from a 315 carry weight to 312. If the mutation is definitely gone, then it disappeared after the serum wore off, which means I lost out on caps and wasted a serum. Good thing the serum was cheap at least.
---
Goood.......goooooooooood....your entitlement gives you focus!
---
I could see certain public events having associated Legendaries, and have the public event that gives a unique reward rotate on a weekly basis.
---
Of course there would need to be event specific bonus goals that would need to be completed to receive the reward, and standard completion would still not standard rewards.
---
I sell most of my radx but keep a few for nuke zones. Very rarely use chems and make sure all my radaway is diluted as well.
---
I can help you too.
---
What does troubleshooters do again?
---
I honestly dont know how they can fix PA but putting on PA more than halves my DPS.  I loathe putting on that clunky, awkward, death trap so godamned much... but nuke zone loot keeps callin me, am I right?
---
Knowing my luck, I'll repeatedly get every mutation but what I want. May not have any other choice though. Oh well.
---
Its just another farming mechanics... Its not going to change.
---
Those are your posts that are being removed.  
---
Targeted harassment
---
Damnit! Has Gary been out drinking and talking shit again? That guy...
---
 My Instigating Lever Action, with a short NV scope, I'm invisible a lot of the time and that scope works, is extremely accurate. I do head shots out to its limits all the time.
---
 My TS Auto Grenade Launcher is wildly inaccurate, but in its case, its a bonus. ;)
---
They should make the rewards PvP based to both please survival fans and encourage PvP in Adventure such as Hunter/Hunted
---
*snorts* What a magnificent question. Is it one of the stretch goals? Oh! Maybe it's locked behind an atom shop price tag! &lt;/sarcasm&gt; 😂 I am so upvoting this.
---
 I've never used VATS so I have no idea how that works.
---
I can't see the picture. Direct link?
---
Ok the door would definitely sink with one guy in power armor!are you crazy?
---
No I would not like to see this. The rewards themselves are what enticed me into playing survival in the first place. Eventually that was the only mode I wanted to play. 
---
I would be in favor of bringing a new set of named weapons into adventure challenges. However, I think the survival weapons should stay right where they are.
---
Exactly that too.  Like in the upper sections of the Forest and Valley.  If you don't explore those early they're meaningless. Then even if you do explore them, there isn't really anything there.  Oh yeah sure there is the saw mill, camden park, the car arena and the mothman town, but those places don't really have anything to them. Camden has those dailies but they're overly repetitive and a slog.  Each of those locations have nothing super interesting and nothing really worth grabbing.  The cool stuff takes tokens that take forever to build up.  Mothman only has mothman eggs, the car arena isn't really used at all and the saw mill is pure junk and mutants.  It's just disappointing.
---
 I left the Vault and turned left, Ended up building my first CAMP just above the WV Lumber Company. 
---
 Flatwoods was quite a bit later. Excellent screener. ;)
---
All of them.
---
First, your name makes me laugh. Keep being awesome.
---
Second, I second your WAT? I don't understand what this person is going for, unless they're an inland mermaid...? Or a fortress of water?
---
That site is exceptionally useful for weapon planning. I see that bug you mentioned. Setting the mods to standard is giving me the AP costs I tested in game.
---
I wonder if it is possible to find enemy limb bonus multipliers. It does not seem to be universally +100% damage for shooting a weak point. Testing on a Yao Guai suggests their weak point only gives +25% bonus damage. It may vary limb by limb, enemy by enemy.
---
scan and repair what, sorry to necro this post ;)
---
Something something storage space, yadda yadda max production per hour. I can find you where it was explained to me, but the gist of it was that a large number of purifiers is pointless.
---
 I have never had a problem aiming the Lever Action. I have a Short NV Scope on it, as I'm invisible a lot, and that one works great. Heads shots are the norm with my Lever Action.
---
Understandable. Apparently you have been shot in the face!
---
I have 14 mutations and have since before meat week. My bro in law logged in to speed demon no longer on his list but he was still losing water with his actions so I assume he still had it.
---
One may not have the authority to tell them what to do but is certainty free to give suggestions  (just as bethesda is free to ignore those suggestions.)
---
If you use a serum with Starched Genes equipped, it sometimes bugs the fuck out (I learned this the hard way after I popped Speed Demon and my character started flipping from "Even faster than Speed Demon should be" to "Even slower than overencumbered walking"). Temporarily remove Starched Genes and take another of the same serum to fix it, no need for any decon showers.
---
I have 80% of my dream armour set and still feel like ive got 1000s of hours ahead of me. A lot of that is because I'm lucky enough to have a really amazing group of mates to hang out with. 
---
I'd totally recommend trying a new playstyle. Try bloodied melee, try a flamer build, try a junkies build, mess around with things you normally wouldn't. Avoid nocturnal, that's objectively garbage
---
Sounds like you have it, then. You'd lose 10 carry weight solo due to losing 10 strength, but a 75% reduction would turn that into 2.5 lbs which would be rounded up to 3 lbs and explains the loss.
---
To your edit, I think if you just change your perspective a bit you will find that it is not as bad as it seems. Even a casual evening gamer should have little problem reaching level 50 in under a week of play. Once you reach that point, you are going to find yourself asking, now what? 
---
Eventually you may roll another toon, and another. Sooner or later you will realize that the unique rewards in the story line are scaled to your level at the time you complete that part of the story. Then you are going to kick yourself and want to run the entire story line and all side quests only after you have reached level 50.
---
I have used the combat knife once...  just because I snuck up on a friend of mine while chameleon'd and then proceeded to jump out of nowhere and stab him in the face (with pacifist mode turned on...just the surprise factor).  Usually I say hi to my friends by sneaking up on them and unloading whatever explosives I've happened to pickup in the wasteland.
---
I too have a legendary shovel...I love the fact that I always have a shovel on me now to do that burial quest.
---
Really really! Never even the purple glow. I've seen a half dozen mothmen, but not a single Flatwoods monster.
---
More like 9 to 10 months.
---
I agree.  When I level an alt, I just park him/her outside the Whitespring back entrance and kite ghouls to the robot guards to kill until I'm high enough level to kill things on my own.  There isn't enough content to level you up, so you have to make your own way - which isn't great game design.  But 76 is a bit of a hobbled together mess, hopefully the new content coming up will help bridge that gap.
---
The most overplayed Skynrd song out there... *sighs*
---
sorry buddy, the only guy with multiple accounts here agreeing with himself is you.
---
If I had a cookie I’d give it to you my guy.
---
Making an alt is about all there is to do for myself now. I started one but even that's just been meh. I even took a 6month break from the game..
---
Thanks man. I just love my basic dotted reflex. But I’ll give anything a go at this point
---
They could also bring back a "Wacky Wasteland" perk card, which could make all wendigos wear clown suits and various other humorous things.
---
With a handmade, that makes sense. My shotgun doesn't have enough range for me to justify not having it on all the time. I have an explosive .44 as a backup weapon, and could probably manage without fireproof for that one, but the shotgun? Not a chance in hell.
---
I agree with everyone else, make an alt that way you can completely customize that character different from your main.
---
There's also Nuclear Winter.
---
I got mine right after release. I have no idea if that has anything to do with it. But it’s a stalker lever action so that’s why I’m reluctant on switching out.
---
Yes it was. And that would explain alot. One of my best friend's camp would have been right inside the border of that nuke zone. He is literally beside me to the north. Btw.... Nice shot!
---
One of the serum recipes needs bone shards...
---
My fucking man!have you seen the trailer for season 4 yet?
---
I do my daily atoms and cap run then log off now so bord.
---
Bethesda always makes me feel like they chase one bug at a time with a hammer. Their games are excellent! I love every one of them that I've played! But I can't pretend not to see the bigger picture. We soldier on!
---
Photo bombed!!  💣💣
---
New content and updates are actually what made me buy the game. Looking forward to it. Yeah it's not in the best state but I do enjoy playing, and it's a good game at its core.
---
Skyrim's dungeons sorta stank, though.
---
Fallout 4 is a better model to aim for.
---
That is a very good point :P I've never had an explosive shotgun lol but now that you mention it yeah every shot would be like a bunch of little explosions in your face lmao
---
I have an instigating and an executioner's western revolvers I use for my backups lol, they're awesome
---
Good tips, thanks.
---
Now when you say good times...? I'm imagining a lot of cussing and shouting.
---
Oh i def think start out rifleman or melee for sure. Ammo and caps are hard to come by at the start
---
I was disappointed in the amount of inaccessible interiors in FO76, though FO4 certainly had it's fair share.
---
I server hopped for two hours one day trying to get the robot chest plan to spawn at Harper's Ferry.  When they finally did spawn and I picked them up, the server disconnected.  I bet I spent another two hours over several days server hopping before I got them again.
---
Completing any of these badges shouldn't depend on blind luck.  Each should be able to be completed through productive work, not server hopping and replaying the same events 200 times.
---
Yep, I just killed one between the red rocket station and the excavator while finishing the Personal Matters quest.
---
Thanks for the pro tips! I'll keep my eyes open!
---
the answer is that mutations are bugged. I spent a lot of time farming them on new character and sometimes they wouldn't show. their effects are active but they're never listed under "effects".
---
this is bad because you might want to farm for 1 mutation and take serums for the rest, or assume you have no mutations because there's nothing listed, and them gulp 5 very expensive bottles. only to find you had a hidden empath.
---
That will work WAY better for me. And we have a long weekend this weekend (not sure where you are, but it's Thanksgiving in Canada on Monday), so I should be able to be around a bit.
---
Hmnmm./  I may have to get myself some charisma :D..   I only have ONE point of that... Serum would cost me 5000 and the recipe is 25000
---
That ambiance with the soft radar pings used to give me chills when I first got FO3.
---
You could always mod it to something cheap and then switch it back. It's hard to tell how to fix some of the issues because even their features have features lol. Best of luck to you.
---
What is the highest percentage of harder to detect while sneaking you can get? What % bonus does the harder to detect while sneak legendary provide? Does chameleon armor add to this or is this separate from it? What bonus does wood armor with shrouded provide?
---
Jack skellington build plz. Explosives, pumpkin grenades, flamer, bone club, Halloween skeleton outfit
---
I'm with you there too.  I enjoy the game enough that the lack of content isn't really an issue, though it's getting to that point for me (but I've got quite a few hundred hours in already).
---
I upvoted. Wasn't sure why someone downvoted!
---
It's true. The next one would be to get said clown wedigo drunk and take it as your companion for campfire tales. 10 atoms. Good luck!
---
Damage against robots
---
Commando rules DPS.
---
I’m making THIS right now.
---
Amen
---
Take a break and play something else until Wasty Dlc, nothing wrong with doing that.
---
Really the only reason to play in the future for me. Ive made and lost 30+ friends in the game. Can't get anyone i know to try it or come back. I haven't  tried either the raid or group mini dungeon. Id like to explore those things with some sort of health reduction mod like conan offers for solo play. I'm hoping wastelanders has at least good solo end game function. One of my concerns though is that server stability is a coding issues entirely. Which has mostly been proven by duper/exploits. But who knows what else triggers it.  So irregardless of a low load of 1-few it will still crash as consistently as public servers.
---
Just on time for Halloween!
---
Awww crap.  I'm in Blackreach again.
---
There should be a quest to override him with the MODUS ai after you complete the main quest, giving harder variants of the missions and replacing the voice.
---
MODUS is infinitely less grating than the mayor.
---
I like the dungeons we do have but I agree we need more, The Burrows was an ok addition, I mean it's more free content
---
It's pretty clutch! Someone always seems to walk off with the one that is supposed to be there. 😐
---
Well.... long story lol
---
If you have the plan u can get legendaries. Just talked a guy into selling me the plan for 10k caps cause I did encryptid seemed like 50 times never got the stupid plan...
---
Does the flee benefit from the heavy gunner perks?
---
https://imgur.com/a/bCYvXzR
---
For me, the Vault 94 raid grind was the best time I've ever had in this game. Not much left after completing my sets though, so I agree with you about that.
---
I am not sure why it is not working
---
Flatwoods monster has been a real pain in the ass. Ive seen him probably 15 times. One time he stayed around for the fight. Mind controlled like 2-3 ghouls as well. Every other time he ran away after being within aggro or one bullet landing on him.
---
Its free ~~real estate~~ caps.  I think. Im sure its free. so...yea
---
That dam on the right side of the map spawn there and server hop. Keep that semi between you if you can't melt it.
---
Not sure, saw a player do similar, though on the ground at WS Station and with Tomahawks.  I assume some kind of glitch or something.
---
How well do they work? Your pistols, I mean. I just started my first alt, and she's rocking pistols. I'm leaning towards the pipe weapons for the revolver/rifle tweaks, but I don't really like how they look...
---
could be 25/7 when Wastelanders comes
---
Where to get the plan?
---
Duping for caps or steel.
---
You were seeing the most recent duping exploit
---
I have been looking into this for a few weeks now and it's been extremely difficult to answer any of these questions. There are about 4 different ways that sneak can be affected and each perk/legendary does something different. I'll try to dig up some more info by Sunday and hopefully give you a better answer.
---
its a dupe for throwable items
---
wow, what game have you played that wasn't broken?
---
You did the right thing.
---
Flatwoods monster should cover alien. I've encountered it during queen if the hunt. I've encountered it in the wild 3 times in 300 hours. 
---
Not sure about the queen.
---
Since when does Super Duper work for smelting?
---
If Beth wants to pay a dj?
---
Bring in the dog and put out the cat.
---
We all built our bases around Sutton as a vending settlement and occasionally get a pack of dbags that will pick locks and attack an afk team member and proceed to damage their base. No boggue, we just wait until they eventually fast travel and linger at an unmarked location and usually get lucky and figure out where they hang their quad faster fire rate Tesla rifle at night. Once that happens, it's game on. One of us is always in a silo so it doesn't take very long.
---
I think I got it at the Encryptid event.
---
It is kind of nice not to feel the need to wear a specific headwear.
---
That challenge is currently unobtainable
---
I want to take pics with all sorts of enemies now. I am working on the World Challenge as well that you need the Prosnap cam for. Unfortunately it is hard to take pics of living creatures so most I killed first so they would stay still. It still counts.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Piecemeal Power Armor
---
what?  not live, like every other Fallout game.  did you really mean a live DJ?  what game has that?
---
I think there’s a legit reason to want pvp and would love it as an option. I don’t think the solution is to make is optional. I think the solution is to make it less impactful. I think that if you’re killed by a player you should just drop random loot, not your own supply. Still get a reward for killing people. It’s not great to die, but it isn’t infuriating where you lose 30 stimpacks and 1,000 steel
---
NW is only really playable for 3-4 hrs.  After that, it's a 15 minute wait for a lobby to "fill" up to 20.
---
What would you consider a 'great' piece of gear?
---
I agree with you 100%.  I played the original Pong in the 70's and the old Adventure and Zork games.  While FO 76 is amazingly complex and something I could not have even dreamed of as a kid, it sometimes has no soul to it.  It could be named Fallout: Rinse and Repeat.  
---
As far as engagement time goes, I find I would play a lot more but my inventory and stash get full, my caps are maxed, and I have already cashed in my legendaries for the daily 150 scrip.  Once you get a routine in place to farm everything you need, you quickly lose a sense of purpose in the game.
---
I really dislike Two Shot on long range weapons and executioner's on a high damage weapon that you should be trying to get one shot kills on most creatures is less that ideal.  I think both are better on either closer range or faster fire rate weapons.
---
I get what you mean.
---
I agree with you
---
This is the kind of wholesome (post-apocalyptic definition) content that I come here for
---
Euro truck simulator multiplayer has that. Lmao
---
Was just some little dream I had I don't think this is anywhere near something Bethesda would do.
---
Some sort of lag? I'm sorry for your inconvenience, is it just caves, not buildings?
---
The pistols are great, I only use level one of each gunslinger and I can take most basic enemies out in a couple shots (like supermutants or ghouls)
---
I actually use an instigating pipe Bolt-Action too lol, it is wonderful, with rifleman, tank killer and gunslinger perks it's pretty much unstoppable, but I throw in bloody mess for good measure lmao
---
The handmade I keep for fast paced fights like the queen, I got an AA handmade yesterday so I'm going to try vault 94 with that soon lol, rifle worked but they respawn too fast to deal with the slow reload
---
Must be hard not cutting yourself on that razor sharp edge. What about people enjoying something makes you so miserable?
---
I am in the same boat, I have a build that is perfect for me, the best weapons, armor, etc. There is really nothing to to grind for, we kill the queen in a couple of minutes regardless of who is there. The group that I play with makes me look forward to playing.
---
You spend 80$ on the game.... and 630$ on the atom store......  
---
Where do you think their priorities are going to be? In fixing the game? Or keep adding to the atom store?
---
And yeah they're kinda ugly unfortunately lol, I'm really hoping they bring out a nice clean skin for them in the atom shop
---
Perma rad storms, the green sky would make it super creepy
---
I can't imagine it is lag. I have a 150 mbps connection. The only times i encounter some lag is when there are a lot of people fighting the sbq. But even that is more of a rarity.
---
And as far i know it's only in (these 2) caves. Haven't had the time to try more caves.
---
Also haven't tried buildings like whitespring.
---
Not a good idea
---
Why?
---
How’s this?

Do you know what causes your pet to become scorched during the attack? I live in the ash heap and always have to deal with scorchbeasts attacking my base, but my deathclaw has remained thankfully healthy throughout all the attacks.
---
I was going to say stick to doing forest events and all that or group with someone to help out here and there. But definitely understand where you're coming from
---
Being hand crafted doesn't change them looking the same. They were all literally unique sure, but going through each of them still felt exhausting and samey. You can only redress the inside of a cave so much before it just starts looking like another cave.
---
The 76 map is significantly larger and has more stuff to see, this is the first time I have ever seen this complaint?
---
Honestly there are too many place where you have to be level 50+ to explore I just wanna go through the lore filled terminals and not have to fight a legendary sheepsquarch
---
where might one find that list?
---
Welcome home
---
I would say the same about caves in real life. Or tombs from certain cultures. All ancient Roman temples are similar, same with Greek ones...
---
No stalking.
---
*FBI has entered the chatroom*
---
It’s not stalking? She was cool but she hasn’t been on fallout in a while.
---
The vault 94 raids are the worst experience I have ever had. There are so many bugs and glitches that constantly ruin runs and force you to restart hoping it doesnt happen again.
---
We kinda already have them. The difference is that, unlike previous games, Fallout 76 isn't cut into little pieces and taped together through loading screens. If Bethesda were to make a dungeon out of every location that could be made into one, a la Skyrim and Fallout 4, then we'd probably have way more dungeons than any previous Bethesda game, but then you'd spend half your playtime in loading screens and your friends or especially strangers wouldn't be able to join you in adventures as easily. Instead, Bethesda opted to do what the gaming community has been asking for for decades - a world almost without loading screens. Of course, as exhibited, this makes the world ironically feel smaller because you can actually explore everything easier and faster, even if the actual map size and dungeon amount is larger.
---
It's Stalking.

With that info I dont think even Liam Neeson could find her, maybe next time the words hey do you mind if I send you a friend request would be a good move not trying to be a dick if it comes across like that

---
 Is the largest map in the fallout world but has no dungeons. Why???
---
That's why there should be a game mode for level 50+ players in which all enemies are at least scaled to player levels.
---
Nuclear Winter is one of the worst BR's imo and the wait time between matches makes it more unbearable.
---
It's their acid attack they do. I've also witnessed it happening in the wild with it.
---
I personally like playing it. But I agree the wait times are ridiculous.
---
Are you able to craft shielded raider lining? If so, can you mod mine?
---
Can you not just msg her then
---
Nice, does the same apply to Nuka grenades?
---
I think mom is leaving you too
---
You could name her after the Starlet Sniper
---
Okay but that doesn't translate to video games. We know the limits of what were generally going to see and find in Skyrim or Fallout already.

Exploring caves and tombs in real life comes with the thrill of actually being there and exploring them. And even the hope of discovering something new or seeing something you haven't seen.
---
Yeah I log off after I fill up on scrip. Over 1800 hours in and I felt like I ran out of stuff to do early on. Kept playing to help friends or get them loot for their builds but they dont even bother to log on
---
2 on Deathclaw Island as well.
---
That may be why they take your bone chimes. Having the audacity to sell bones when you just flaunt them everywhere in your camp?
---
Yes!
---
I need more frank Sinatra also I'm surprised that uranium fever wasn't part of the sound track since ya know Appalachia is a mining state
---
🙄 It does when it's an open world sandbox RPG. You could go back through many of them and probably notice things you hadn't seen before. Happens all the time.
---
She haven’t been online
---
Then you’ve found her, not sure how you thought anyone here could help you with that.
---
None.
---
I would like to see a bundle that has a set of Riot gear.
---
I noticed this the other week when I managed to place down my camp after moving it.
---
What i do now if i move is build a 4x4 square of floor (separate from main camp). Move all my vendors and display cabinets onto this. Then once I move I can just place this down and move the vendors/displays where I want them. No restocking needed.
---
No I meant on social media
---
I get that... but you read my post right... like many others they are losing me and other big spenders. I’m sure if given the choice there’d prefer to keep me vs finding a handful of low lever spenders to make up the difference. Now it’s just to what level it’s worth it to them... if they even see this or care. But that’s the whole point.
---
The Free States bundle, missed out on it last time and the  military suit it comes with looks nice.
---
Grafton's Mayor is the new Preston Garvey
---
I’ll be on around 930pm pacific time tonight. I’ll help you clear it no problem. GT is Lordboh1788.
---
I still haven't gotten the laser gun plan.  No matter how many I scrap.  Where did anyone who has it find it?
---
Why? The challenges in survival were easily done by bypassing most of the progress of the challenge in survival.  You just needed to prep for them in adventure and hop to survival when the timing or place was right.
---
Excellent. Remember with a flamer to use it semi auto. If you hold down fire you'll waste ammo!
---
Why not post your tweaks, or link to a post listing them?
---
I think the biggest issue with a bag is they despawn both randomly and when you do.  I don't think items placed into a container despawn until the server reboots/crashes.
---
thanks!
---
A few in my group have been messing round with fun builds on new characters. Beserkers, medics, flamer build, power armour if you don't already etc
---
But really I come back for my buddies
---
What are you? 12?
---
Don't stalk her socials you creepo. That's not cool.
---
If she wanted you to know thise details, she'd tell you.
---
I do believe so
---
Just let us dual wield. Dps would still lag behind rifle and heavy builds but it would be fun as hell
---
Notice what? I go into a building in Fallout and I know immediately I am going to see the same assets I have seen hundreds of times by now, I know what kind of enemies I am likely to see and I know reading terminals will almost always be about a shady business. 
---
In Skyrim you're going to walk into another grey cave and fight Draugr majority of the time. The layout changing doesn't make it any less repetitive.
---
It's not restrictive, it accommodates the players in the area. They have it zoned so that lower level players always have somewhere they can adventure around in, and so do higher level players. Otherwise there would never be any challenge for the higher level players, because everything everywhere would just drop to the lower level player that just entered the area, and the loot on them would drop as a result. There's a reason it's structured that way.
---
One option would be to go the way ESO did and not calculate enemy levels until someone taps them. That makes it where you can literally quest anywhere you want, because the enemies always stay at your level.
---
Best bet would be to ask her personally if she feels comfortable doing that. From my first-hand experience of guys adding me on my social media from games, it can be a little weird without asking and getting permission.
---
Ok thanks, this should help me protect my deathclaw a bit better.
---
Amyyy95? Haha you’re searching for my irl girlfriend, what’s your GT? I’ll ask her
---
Edit: why the downvote haha we’ve been together for 7 years and have a child together. This is so weird.
---
Maybe she's avoiding stalkers.
---
Maybe move on to a different game series then. Although if the attention to detail in these games doesn't please you, maybe you should just give up gaming in general. Are you having a bad day? I've seen negative people before, but damn man. Take a zoloft and perk up.
---
Nexusmods should help out these sorry devs...
---
They won't see your camp at all, it also blocks their camp from you.
---
That’s stalking...don’t be Thatguuyy.
---
If you wearing PA (well, most people visiting Lucky Hole inside Excavator), switch the camera to third-person mode, this will fix the problem.
---
My boyfriend has way too much fun with his One Punch Man build. Unarmed perks and an Instigating Powerfist.
---
Oh shit, lol, you are straight stalking her, or trying to anyway. You should let this one go before there are consequences.
---
I'm replying to your original comment. I explained to you why the dungeons in Skyrim were repetitive.
---
🤦
---
Of course it is 🙄
---
In the crater/sink hole between Freak Show and the Monorail Elevator I've seen one a few times, usually a bunch of scorched there too shooting at it.
---
It’s super weird how repetitive FO76 is as opposed to fo4. The events are interesting two or three times, but the rewards don’t justify the bullets spent.
---
Except they aren't any more repetitive than any other caves or dungeons you would explore in any other geographical region in reality. So. Yeah.
---
It doesn’t matter. The Wendigo will get stuck in the ground anyway.
---
If you’re talking to me, give me your Gt and you can join a party with us. I’m sure she can clarify and you can explain why you’re trying to stalk her social media.
---
And I explained to you the difference between how exploring in real life would work vs in a video game.
---
Do you know his build by chance?
---
It's alright... I never really was your dad, that's why you've never seen me.
---
I'm trans-parent.
---
Welcome to reddit lol
---
Your life would be so much better if you just let people enjoy things
---
Heey, we have completly useless bunkers with 1 room to explore.
---
Isn't it a Lasagna oath now
---
OH FOR FUCK'S SAKE, IM TAKING THE DOG WITH ME NOW, I HOPE YOU HAPPY WITH YOURSELF.
---
Finally Sound Design gets recognition!  Yes it is very good.  I wish it was 7.1 but I will take what I can get.
---
Huh, I only have the odd super mutant here or a mollrat from time to time so maybe I can streamline my 5 turrets
---
Maybe she blocked OP
---
Wasn’t trying to stalk. Just trying to talk to a cool girl
---
Lol I've upvoted you this is priceless
---
But she hasn’t been online
---
Are you serious? That's crazy.
---
Haha we’re both so confused. She gets a lot of creeps so ends up having to block people. If we had OPs GT we can find out what’s going on and figure this out in a party or something
---
Why would I give a random guy my GT man. I was just trying to find a girl I thought was cool.
---
Because amyyy95 is sat next to me and you’ve literally made a post to find her.
---
Me too, Wastelanders can't get here fast enough.
---
I've done both, I get it. It's not THAT different, in that most caves look really similar, with some exceptions (statement applies to both)
---
More creepy that you’re pretending it’s your girlfriend mate.
---
Exactly, one turret can eat up to 10% of your budget, so just observe how one turret deals with the enemies and if it does a good job, remove the others
---
Yeah that's your down but what's your up? I get issues like that when my up takes a shit.
---
If you can enjoy exploring repetitive caves in a video game then you also someone that would be stimulated by dangling keys or exploring copy paper.
---
Depends on the particular weapon, but unmodified handmade with legendary -25% AP cost will have 3x greater AP cost than this same rifle on any automatic receiver, and if you further mod these rifles to reduce AP cost this 3x can actually rise much higher.
---
How many crits you do per single AP bar without any refill? My commando guy and my guerilla guy can put there few dozens.
---
With proper build and without holding the fire button, you still oneshot things and use same ammo quantities to clear thrash. For bosses you spend more, but your DPS is few times greater.
---
I really didn't like how alot of the houses are boarded up and not used, but I'm guessing alot might get used in a later update. Like wastelanders. But if you look at even ESO, for example, there are still many places to explore and dungeons. I wish they took lead from how ESO went and applied some stuff from there
---
And yes I know it's a different company but it came out to be a great game I used to go back to, until I got into fo76 really hardcore
---
I’m dead, We’re dying my lord. Literally giving you an opportunity to talk to her, Which is why you made this post. Must be another weirdo she had to block.
---
Getting 2 sets of strangler PA kept me motivated for a couple months but now that I'm done with that I'm back to grinding for good gear.  
---
As I'm closer and closer to ideal gear for my characters even that pursuit is starting to dwindle.  
---
I'm looking forward to Wastelanders mostly because it will bring new weapons like bows, so I'm planning to make another alt once that happens to try and leverage whatever new weapon classes they implement.  Until then I mostly just farm legendary's for scrip and run dailies for atoms while hanging out with friends in discord
---
He doesnt want to now since he knows she isn't single lmao. Bet.
---
Been running my version of this for 6 months.
---
We’re laughing so hard, this is the last thing we ever expected to see, someone just sent her screenshots of this because she doesn’t have reddit
---
I’m pretty sure he isn’t her boyfriend. Just another random.
---
Lmao you played with her once and you suddenly know if she has a long term bf or not? You are delusional, my guy.
---
How did you get started (recommend a way for someone to learn) and what tools do you use?
---
No he’s just trying to stir the pot
---
i’m expecting the dlc to be FO76 2.0.
---
I mean, anyone leaving the Vault who's under 25 did, seeing as they would have been born in the Vault
---
Lookin' real spoopy.
---
Haha if he hasn't pm you already I think he may be on the blocked list dude
---
Yeah, that's what I said
---
Use the gift emote!
---
I just feel like it’s something she would have mentioned
---
You can ignore Preston, Mayor Grafton can't be ignored when you're there.
---
He’s making it up
---
Literally PM me your GT and I’ll tell her to send you a message, isn’t this the whole reason you made the post
---
I understood the pricing.
---
To achieve that, I first gathered extensive information about builds that people use, then information on how prevalent is the the knowledge about these builds.
---
The more appropriate given roll is for given build, and the more popular the build, the higher the price. Things can be useless, useful, good, great and perfect. Useless 10 cap per scrip, useful 1-5k, good 5-15k, great 15k + or trade, perfect trade only.
---
Popular builds gets like x2 price modifier, most popular builds gets like x3
---
I don’t understand why you feel the need to blatantly lie when I’m just trying to find this girl I had a laugh with
---
Ms. Raider, thankyou... 😁
---
Yeah, all girls should introduce themselves by saying "hello, my name is __ and I have a boyfriend"
---
Lmao you cant make this shit up. It's not relevant to the game, so its unnecessary to mention unless asked.
---
Scarecrows...
---
Then she's obviously got other shit going on that's more important. 
---
Stop. Being. A. Creep.
---
If you’re eating them, friend, go ahead and disarm.
---
Pure ballet.
---
Then why was she even talking to me and not her “boyfriend”
---
I need that plan badly
---
How am I lying? Why would I go to the effort? I am literally trying to prove it, not that I need to. I’ve offered you party invites and that I can get her to message you? What more do you want haha. My GT is streettriple765. Look how not difficult it is to type your GT.
---
Why dont you send him your gt then if hes trying to troll you block him but if hes not and she msg you you can have some mad awkward 3 way convo with you, some girl you trying to find and the girl you trying to finds boyfriend
---
There’s no set formula but after a while you can get an approx sense of what typical price ranges for certain weapons and their legendary combinations. 
---
It also varies depending on where/how you want to sell items. Selling in game thru a vending machine is far cheaper than what you’ll ever see on any trading market forums. A god-roll handmade marked for 15-20k in a vending machine might seem outrageous to some players, but the same gun will get bids over 50k on a dedicated forum. Good Fixers are going for even more. 
---
The market changes all the time too so there’s no way to standardize it. Ultimately an item is worth whatever someone is willing to pay, which can vary drastically from person to person.
---
Pretty cheap from the bots.  Should be in whitesprings.
---
Why you mad mate?
---
*creepiness intensifies*
---
Not compared to heavy or melee.
---
Look guys, 
---
If she doesn’t want to talk to me she’ll let me know. We had a laugh together and that’s it 
---
I just wanted to get to know the pretty girl that liked fallout better
---
That’s it
---
Because We’ve found some creep on the internet trying to stalk her socials and given you every opportunity to talk to her again and you’re just being a dick at this point. It’s kinda obvious you’re a weirdo and that she must have blocked you. If you wanna send your GT for a party inv or whatever, that’s fine, we can figure it out but if not I’m kinda confused as to why you even made the post
---
What's the story with the Presidential area of the enclave bunker? Has Bethesda added anything to that since launch?
---
And that's the reason peeps shouldn't rush in, level up to 50 and smash the main quest line.
---
Take your time it's not a competition. 
---
There's plenty to keep you going, 
---
I've been playing for the last ten months 4-6 hours a day minimum and still find plenty to do.
---
Ask Grafton Mayor
---
It would be great if they let modders complete this game.
---
Agreed, they go 1:1
---
This is a wild ride lmao
---
I have 2 accounts. My primary account has 5 characters, my main has 25000\~ caps, the remaining 4 characters have 30000 caps.  
---
My second account has 5 characters.  Main has \~25000 caps, 3 others have 30000, and last one has 29700. Periodically, based on need, I trade caps between the characters.  
---
Is this clearer for you, now?
---
I have read about it, but havent done/tried anything. That was why I posted on here in the first place, but it seems no one really uses it.
---
The burrows back lash was due to the hype Bethesda made for a very very weak dungeon. Also it wasn't instanced, how many people where in there doing it for the first time and some TSE or bloodied asshole ran passed them and cleared it all out. Now the loot and xp is gone and the story isn't even completable unless you jump servers. The burrows are great now that less people go there.
---
Got it. Now if it'd show up properly in my pipboy, that'd be great.
---
I think you might want to look at that Skyrim map one more time, friend.
---
Pretty much
---
Il save you the trouble we are all Amy
---
Yeah I only own the switch controller, and Ive seen the nonsense about no keyboard rebinds (which is insane that they havent fixed that)
---
I just spent the money on the game and didn’t want to have to spend more money, or jump through hoops to make it enjoyable you know?
---
I'm still looking into it, but try looking in:
---
- Event: Patrol Duty
---
- Arktos Pharmacy 
---
- Charleston Capital Building
---
- Charleston Herald
---
- Clarksburg Shooting Club
---
Imo you just suck at the game, not trying to defend bgs
---
WestTek is a good spot for XP and legendaries.
---
R/dadjokes
---
Anywho...
---
At -4 rating, you're not making sense to many people
---
I'm fine with a new set of legendaries! Back when FO3 launched, Bethesda had a create a perk contest. I'd be well pleased if they had something similar to promote the (hypothetical) new challenges, having the community pitch potential legendaries.
---
I use bone in almost all my decorations but I also collect enough of it around the Wastelands that I don't see how someone would be so in need that they'd take it from another players bone chimes.
---
I added the game to Steam because of the screenshot management and fps counter but not using a controller
---
Silent Hill Woods.
---
Then there wouldn’t be enough fighting to satisfy the other half of the players
---
Either lower prices or raise the worth
---
Right? All I wanted, from the start, was a 2 player experience. My friend and I, roamin' the wastes.
---
honestly there's no big secret.  Learn the events that spawn legendary enemies like project paradise, encryptid, uranium fever, scorched earth etc.  Spawn the events you can, and wait for the ones you can't.
---
I try to run SBQ at least 2x per day as I know I'll get a minimum of a 2 \* armor and a chance at at least 1 3\* drop from the queen.
---
The old spots still spawn legendaries like Whitesprings, west tek etc, but they are less consistent than they used to be.  You will get fewer legendaries but they tend to be 2 or 3\* more often than in the past.
---
But the main key is that you literally need to farm thousands of drops for each "god roll".  max out your 150 daily scrip and get legendaries from the purveyor as frequently as possible.
---
Ultimately it's about VOLUME.
---
Using any mods?
---
Great effort fellow fallout player. Keep I going
---
Wrong
---
In Adventure mode, I do a few atom challenges, and maybe farm legendaries. Make some ammo, repair gear, sell. Other than that, I'm in Nuclear Winter.
---
I didnt even rush in. My main thing was exploring for a long time, than trying to figure out how to nuke, than the story and finally loot hunting. Game just feels stale and empty especially with a massive lack of endgame content. Making builds for non-pvp is also kind of boring. Of course everyone wants unyielding, bolstering, vanguard or weight reduction rolls but even than its not really all that necessary for pve except unyielding for melee. Weight reduction is helpful but boosting your def in pve  can make things a bit easier but modding non-legendary combat armor will do just fine. Not much in game that provides a challenge enough to wear high def legendary armor besides PvP, SBQ (kind of) and the Imposter sheepsquatch. Its like there is so much you can do to feel more powerful or tanky but why get to that point? What are you going to use it on? Its easy enough with normal armor so why grind like crazy just for a bit better armor?
---
Damn! I've been scriping them thinking I'd never need them lol. Thanks dude will make sure to hold on to troubleshooters next time 👊
---
Yeah sorry but what? Bs flag coming up on that who ever really did sbq alone that's ridiculous...
---
Dude I don't think you're suppose to fuck the boss.
---
Trust me by the end of it he'd seen every emote ever available 🙈
---
Dude I think you need glasses
---
I've had that problem multiple times with mine. I just switch weapons and it goes away.
---
Dad jokes never go out of style
---
Being a single player gamer doesn't mean shit, if you suck you suck. Don't let the door hit you on the way out
---
You can make a set of excavator look like X-01, because they all share the same skin.
---
So you didn't figure out that you need to mod the Syringer with a Bleed-Out barrel ?
---
I’d rather have survival and adventure
---
Ok?
---
Coke&gt;pepsi
---
I can craft Enclave, Raider, BOS and Vault Suit IIRC; however, I'm currently out doing errands rn and won't be home for a while. If you absolutely need it ASAP, you can put out a request on the [REDACTED TRADE SUB THAT MUST NOT BE NAMED] and somebody that can craft it can happily put it on for you. If you can wait a few hours, I'll happily DM you for it and we can go from there. I'm on PS4 though, so if you're on XBOX or PC, I would refer to the former option unfortunately. :)
---
Thank you. This was a perfect explanation to help me out.
---
So uncivilized
---
Mom gets half of the dog in the divorce.
---
Lol I hope not.
---
Bloodied builds have no excuse for doing this - they can always reduce their damage by increasing their health - and yeah, it's rude.
---
Bring survival back so i have a reason to log in other then turn in scrip and look for players to loot at workshops.
---
Same
---
Exactly the same, except I'm just waiting for Wastelanders to disappoint so that I can feel good about myself. I played the game to death, hated the end-game, hated Bethesda's practices and incompetence, felt everything I did was for nothing. And so here I am, stopped playing the game a few months ago, occasionally lurking this subreddit, seeing people's reactions and waiting for the miraculous update that will add meaningful (stable) content to the game (which won't happen).
---
Or even like a guild-owned server! I'd love that.
---
lol, I wouldn't get too excited.  All the other dlc's released over 3 months or so.  
---
I doubt it will be a massive dlc will just drop on day 1 and transform the entire game.  Rather I expect it to drop in stages each adding a bit and only once it's all released will we have the full picture.
---
Did the second and so far no takers so i will happily wait for your arrival buddy. @Scummey on ps4. Also, do I provide my own materials or you take caps?
---
If someone wanted to be a douche, I doubt they would've used something as terrible as a TSE. You probably just saw BEs, JEs, etc, chief.
---
Was she glowing green?
---
How often do you guys/gals login?
---
I find the loading screen rather enduring.
---
Wish I could manage my character stats or browse the map while logging into a server.
---
You had me at massive ghoul horde
---
Tell me more of this 1960 D&amp;D.
---
I believe the worn-out Mole outfit head has a 1DMG resist still. But it's a bug.
---
ikr! the bladed bull barrel was awesome and looked mean af but just the bull barrel itself is enough to keep me happy :) i can get nuka world tee shirts but no bullbarrel
---
Wouldn't it be more reasonable that the people outside are more suited to physical stuff? Seems like in a world where being strong is a large part of survival that they would remain in greater numbers.
---
I have access to a gym and let me tell you about all the time I don't spend there.
---
Conversely, having dealt with all the shit and rads they are Ubermensch and the vault dwellers are a bunch of limp wristed sissy lala’s...
---
I really enjoy nuclear winter. It is a lot of fun and ads variety to the game. I get why some people wouldn’t like it but I don’t think dropping a game mode that is pretty stable already is productive.
---
Wastelanders
---
Sorry, but you missed your chance to do it. It's fixed. 🙂
---
I'm level 77 and when I get bored from playing another game. I go to 76 and walk around.
---
Survival is so similar to adventure though. I like having something actually different. Plus I’m working my way through all the lore in the vault lol
---
Doesn't really matter what it was I'm explaining a scenario where someone just fastly kills everything, buddy.
---
I meant 70s, but here. You can look into this obscure game that managed to have player agency 50 years ago.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons
---
Rejoin a new server again. Might have to do it a few times. Happened to me while leveling my alt.
---
I was just messing with you, calm down 😂
---
I thought the "chief" would make it pretty obvious...
---
Pretty sure it takes up a sizable budget. At least it did months ago when I tried. Haven't messed with it in a while because they are broken.
---
Do you have any skins on your armor? My fiance had the same trouble until he removed the black rider skin from his Excavator suit.
---
Yeah the Problem is that ive started it done one thing inside the quest but it wasnt finished and then the Server didnt replied and after the i joined like 7 Servers and it didnt came back ive spoken with the Mayor but the quest wasnt started
---
There’s no pvp in adventure and that’s what hinders me from taking a multiplayer survival game seriously. That’s just me tho I guess
---
Hi, I launched those two nukes :P
---
Yea that was really weird.
---
One guy got legendary loot, the best I got was 6 stimpack.
---
Also noticed She didn't regen at 50% HP or take off once grounded.
---
Someone tag LadyEvevevevv pls.
---
Good. I kinda hate VATS. But even without it, I never use it, there are problems with stuff 5' away. I often put one right into the middle of em' and ... nothing. ;)
---
There literally have been 0 improvements or changes to this game within the last minute.
---
I get it, I know. I prefer not to think of it as grinding, as in I’m playing a game grinding, but that I’m actually living my life, trying to survive in a sucky world. Not 100% role playing, but taking an “it is what it is” approach. Just trying to make it to the next day, hoping something better comes along. In this case that “something” happens to be Wastelanders right now.
---
Which is why I advised it depends on the weapons you have available.  If you read my post I basically said "rifleman makes sense if you have a god tier rifle that doesn't support an automatic receiver but only a mediocre option that supports full auto" and I stand by that advice.
---
For what it's worth a handmade with a powerful auto receiver is about 40% more DPS than one with a hardened semi auto receiver.  40% is a lot of additional DPS but its not "a few times greater" :P
---
Crits are a separate topic as not every build leverages crits and not every weapon maximizes them.  But yes, auto weapons are indeed more ap efficient and thus generally better for crits.
---
And I do agree commando is better for bosses, though I also am confident commando is not a requirement to beat bosses as I have a bloodied sniper that can switch between both commando and rifleman and it does work in either mode.
---
Get help.
---
Thanks, mate. The wife came up that gem while watching me do a nuked WS run. You can see I get no respect at home lol.
---
Once you are built you are built. The game is mainly about building characters and once that's done it does kinda let you down a bit.
---
 I have 5 now so I just build a new one and try to do something different`. That's harder than it might seem, after you kinda own the game.
---
Someone downvoted me lol ok
---
Just want to add the fact that the map is way smaller.
---
They are pretty fun! We have several in the Denver area now and sounds like more are starting up in other states from the announcements I heard at ours. Ours isn't huge but has been running for a lot of years. Here's a time lapse of ours https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR2FQVCD1bw&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
I have a few friends who use this sub and I reference it a lot when searching for things and has been super helpful but also have had several friends who left it due to some of the negativity on here.
---
That's how I've been doing it for the past couple weeks. Trying to immerse myself in the "living in a post apocalyptic world from day to day" kind of thing. It's enjoyable for sure.
---
Get the scrapper perk early on. Make sure it’s equipped when you scrap all the weapons you’ll be picking up. It’s a quick way to get a lot of steel and lead early on for making ammo.  Also do you have a specific build in mind for your perk load out?
---
P-V-P. Fight the toughest and smartest things in the wasteland... Other people.
---
I tried doing this today. Kill a death claw, go to deathclaw island where one ALWAYS spawns. Nothing. Kill Bohemoth. My camp was on a lake just SW of Solomon’s Pond for a month and every time I went there, I mean EVERY TIME, there was one sleeping in the lake. Today, nothing. What’s it worth like 10 atoms, you can’t give us the easy ones? Seems like they changed the spawn rates. Don’t usually complain about the game nor does this really bother me I just found it strange.
---
We have 1v1 and 2v2 tournaments for PvP with various rules including no vats and non-legendaries. They can be pretty fun and the community we have gets together for rewards.
---
Ahh I see. So you guys camp not far from me.

I and my friends too have gotten tag by a bunch of dbags. One killed us on purpose to steal our shit. Once we tracked him down, we were about to attack him but the wise ass does the "wave" emoji and logs off. Him and his friend were both level 200+ and used modified Tesla rifles
---
Thanks for the advice I appreciate it. I haven’t really looked into builds all that much so I best get on to that, tbh I’d settle for something fairly simple tbh, any recommendations for builds?
---
They would've turned red if you shot them or if they shot you. I just tested it out yesterday with my brother and it went just like you said. The claim bar didn't moved and he didn't go red until I shot him

It's not even taking that long. I think both times we downed her in under two minutes.
---
There are too many things I love about this story. Your reaction and attitude, their five month long grudge, THEY REMEMBERED THE EXACT DATE?! That's dedication, a true grudge. Ggwp
---
Yea, or just sell something lol
---
DA:O's dungeons were not repetitive, each area was super different. DA2 on the other hand...
---
Deathhole sounds like where Deadpool was born from.
---
Even Origins had unique dungeons. You're thinking the random encounters which all just so happened to take place in Southern Ferelden from the geography
---
Lmao, I've been hitting that tunnel hard and fast.
---
Perhaps down the line, but only 25 years or so after, they would still mostly be the generation that experienced the bombs, and were developed without radiation as kids so I suspect that along with a very physical lifestyle would mean they're as good if not better than any of the vault dwellers
---
Fully agreed, there's often no need to hyperspecialise, i.e. I have a toon that can shoot for more than 10k damage per bullet and I would never consider him like this a strong one, no fun to play like this all the time (quad assaultron heads are ridiculously cumbersome to load).
---
I've experienced that glitch with her on the ground, but I've been getting legendaries along with the kill... also I haven't noticed anything wrong about her dying quickly, it might just be because overleveled players in the game or something.

Praise be to Him and His Powder. We worship.
---
Yeah I played steady up until meat week. A good break until Wastlanders is good for the soul.
---
Skyrim had dungeons based on race that built the dungeon which is why they looked similar. Dwemer always used Dwemeri metals, Nords all built with brick and mortar, Dunmer blended brick with chitin, Falmer always used Chitin, Ancient Nords always built using iron and brick etc etc
---
I could disarm them for you?
---
would give them some use besides "i need to mod/make this item and then never have it equipped again"
---
*laughs in 30 minute dwemer ruin*
---
I frequently find one at the Sundew Grove near the Moonshiner's Shack in the Bog. 
---
Also a few times had one show up at the rest stop near the Investigator's Cabin in the Divide and fight the group of regular hostiles that spawn there.
---
Do you want It? Because that’s how you get It.
---
There’s no reason to revisit any areas except for whitesprings and westek right now and it makes me sad.
---
Nope, what you see in the Atom shop pics is how they look on every armor type.
---
So back to this. I killed a 3 star Mole Miner and a damn mole rat exploder blew his body away....🤬🤬🤬🤬
---
On one hand, I'm glad I'm not the only one. On the other hand, this shouldn't be happening to anyone.
---
I thought we were doing that old Terrance and Phillip skit?
---
kiss me
---
Glad to see a fellow PowerBoy!

If you are on xbox, I would be happy to make a modded weapon or decent armor for your level if you need (and I have enough mats).
---
&gt;playing online game for story
---
I know you saw the Bethesda logo, but I'm not sure if 76 has much of a focus on the story
---
There’s an old post here “known cap stashes” that I have marked that is pretty solid.  The mappalachia program may have that as a searchable object for more thoroughness.
---
And you are right you can rake in the caps like this.  With a bonus search I’ve pulled over 300 caps from a single stash, and that’s without a caps bobble head.  I ran a pretty good route when I was caps hungry long ago, I really should run it more often.  My personal view is that luck boosts caps BUT I have no solid proof.
---
Yeah I know I really play fallout for the 50's vibe I love that style of technology and I love the music
---
I am not great at builds but it all depends on what weapons you prefer, if you want to use power armor or not, if you prefer to sneak around or just run into the mix, etc.
---
I’m really hoping the Raiders expansion brings new life into the game.
---
I will say, however, as a player whose played since beta and has 5 different characters, finding a solid group to play with completely changes the game, at least it did for me. I stopped playing last December and then came back this summer and very quickly met a group of guys. I now have two characters close to level 200, compared my three others when I played by myself, none over 60.
---
It truly is meant to be a social game and sometimes that falls by the wayside.
---
do u use perforating? I heard armor pen stacks poorly so with perforating it should be 40%+36% of 40%. Tank killer is 36% right?
---
I hope that the mod scene comes through for this game.
---
no
---
God no. The 10mm is like 4-5 AP per shot. The only thing redeeming the Plasma pistol, which is costing between 20-25 AP per shot, is the increased damage, extra projectile on critical hits, and critical meter gained per shot. It eats up AP quickly, but I am able to maintain a critical hit on every single target, so it manages the high cost well. I did not realize the extra projectile would work this well with Vats.
---
Well the total ap would be 40% + (1-40%)36% = 61.6%
---
I'd rather them being back the survival challenge prizes by bringing back survival mode. Not your fault, otherwise it's a good idea!
---
Some people just want to travel Th e wasteland with a buddy man.
---
It happens to me alot. It'll say 95% and be less than thirty yards away with a scoped lever action, and it'll "miss" although I assume it's just weird glitchy lag that the game refuses to acknowledge.
---
What's a "geruntee hit"?
---
Thx
---
It’s no lifers man you see this crap posted in literally every game sub for the last 15 years.
---
If you’re bored play something else everyone thinks something is owed once THEY get bored.
---
I’m still having loads of fun and guess what when I get bored I’ll just play something else I won’t come here posting like a damn entitled tool.
---
Pvp dies in the game and everyone starts wondering why late game players are bored. There is no point to high end loot and OP weapons if there is no use for them. Wastelanders will be a lot of fun, but I'm not sure it will help much once people finish the quest line. Imo they took the survival out of a survival game and their attempts at filling the void with 'raids' has fallen short.

Imagine if you could unlock boarded up houses and create your own house inside it like youll have a Camp and a House

Nuclear Winter is the most stable and replayable game mode available in Fallout 76, which was true even when it was in its pre-Beta form. Having played Adventure since the Beta days, I can confidently say that Adventure today, a year after release, should still be labeled "pre-Beta." Adventure at its best has never been as stable as NW at its worst. NW has also been massively popular with players and critics alike, which isn't true of Adventure.
---
It is never a good idea to abandon your success, leaving it to fail, only to try to bail out a sinking ship.
---
I've always wanted to see a large interconnecting tunnel/dungeon system like Skyrims Dwarven ruins.
---
Germany Heat, after Miami Heat goes to Europe.
---
Well, she isn't dropping legendaries, she isn't marked as Legendary, and she doesn't regen at all. So there's definitely something wrong.
---
Crafted a basic low lvl combat rifle and tried it out with a friend in power armor it does work
---
A couple of weeks ago I was in Flatwoods, and killed a Legendary ghoul at the Red Rocket - got a 1* level 1 😯 Troubleshooters Pipe Revolver;
---
Later that night I helped with "Back on the Beat" in Morgantown, and looted a 2* level 5 Bolstering Leather Chest armor (+25 Rad Resist).
---
Modded the pistol into a .45 revolver rifle with True stock / barrel and Hardened reciever, and Modded the armor to Studded / Deep Pocketed. 
---
Used them both for awhile, then repaired to 200%.
---
Watched V76 for an obviously new player, and walked up in my 76 suit (no weps / armor equipped) saying "This is your lucky day . . . "
---
Yeah, dropped 100 ammo, stims, water, disease cure,  and some Opossum Bacon, too
---
Crits do bonus damage or they won't be called crits
---
right! i completely forgot about this.
---
Black bear wallpaper
---
I certainly don’t know, but it was my impression that they were survivors... a tune leap seems silly...
---
That's awesome! Bet you made their day!
---
there's 2 things to consider: one, nobody knows for sure whether the displayed damage accurately represents your actual damage. explosive gatling plasmas for example seem to output far more damage than the displayed numbers.
---
and two, because of how armor works in Fo76, weapons with lower tooltip damage (such as autos) benefit far more from armor penetration than hard-hitting ones. a weapon that hits for 3000 damage per shot is far above the Queen's 300DR "treshold" for example, so it's gonna ignore her DR, kinda. you're never dealing full damage but if your damage output is high enough, armor is essentially negated.
---
and I'd imagine a semi handmade, instigating at that, falls within the second category. it's also worth noting that armor penetration itself works similarly, in that you need to hit certain tresholds.
---
That's true, but also sad. I've solo'd that event. Adventure is so dull. Eventually, you reach a point that there's nothing exciting anymore.
---
They typically deal twice as much damage, but some weapons, depending on mods, legendary effects, and the Better Criticals perk can deal a substantial amount of critical damage, I would guess around four times instead of twice the amount.
---
They do also guarantee that a hit will connect, as long as it's a ranged attack, as V.A.T.S is pretty unreliable when it comes to melee attacks.
---
I hope I answered your question!
---
Well, hell. Give it time and someone will find out that if you pull the rug from under them, while on a slight incline and have a team member power hit it 3 times is the next fix.
---
Gerun is the leader of the Occuria in Final Fantasy XII.

I’m guessing it’s a T-shirt (tee for short) with his pic on it that is likely to succeed when it goes to market.
---
I like the 50s atmosphere of 3. I wish they'd bring it back
---
76 would benefit from camps being saved on servers regardless if the player is online.  That way it would really feel like we were rebuilding America.  And, prime real estate would become that much more precious.
---
I would rather have the furious.. but thats just me ymmv
---
Mhm, mhm. They all looked the same and had lame puzzles without any story told within nonetheless.
---
Fallout 4 has a comparable amount of flavor text to Skyrim, but in fallout 4 it's *always* tailored to the location it's found in, and thus always is an essential part of said location.
---
Personally I'd go with instigating, you'll kill things in 1-2 hits pretty easily in VATS.
---
That said, a furious would be significantly better for longer fights (4 or more shots per mob).  So if you plan to bring it to an SBQ fight, or don't consistently use VATS headshots, go with furious.
---
Or, get both!
---
Worse
---
agreed
---
They do your total crit bonus to base damage, not affected by any multipliers (perks drugs or weapon bonuses) 
---
So if you run bloodied cookie cutter build, you will see extremely small damage boost. Talking like 5% for 3 perk cards. 
---
Not saying crits are bad, I run a 33 Luck Crit Savvy  build myself, it's definitely worth it. I'm just saying the damage boost is low so that makes the perk cards, and legendary effect pretty lame. 33% fire rate or explosive are both much better.
---
They need more difficult PvE content, and better raids with better bosses. And I hate to say it but a big bullet sponge enemy with like phases and spawns swarms of adds, like a typical cookie cutter raid. That'll give the end game weapons and armor a purpose. 
---
Unfortunately Bethesda is fucking terrified to make content that isn't completable by a level 10 player for some reason.
---
Furious is better because you will do more damage over time and if you stay on target, instigating is only bonus damage if target is full health, instigating is best on gauss, snipers, 2 handed melees for the most part, but after the 1st shot it's just base/perk damage. Hope this helps.
---
I really liked the mid century modern houses in sanctuary hills tho they really need to add a nuke town reference (idk if they have and I'm just really oblivious)
---
Commando&gt;rifleman as far as benefitting from armor penetration goes
---
The problem is that I've already played games that actively encourage you to engage... my 15 years of WoW would attest to that (though the latest expansion makes a dumpster fire look enviable). But FORCED engagement through challenges that basically require dumb luck or lots of server hops or quest chains that are stupidly random like the damn camera are the antithesis of fun.
---
And before anyone feels like saying "well challenges are optional" realize that a REAL challenge would potentially be fun and something I'd look forward to doing. Chugging 10 booze is easy, but not fun or challenging. Tracking down a LIVE megasloth in Cranberry Bog is in the same boat though infinitely more difficult unless I feel like server hopping AND have at least decent luck.
---
Thank you most everyone is saying to go with furious so that's what I'll do
---
There are 2 reliable ones at West Tek when you first spawn there and head past the barricade there will be in office covered with bone chimes and there is almost always one there.
---
There's another inside close to where the boss spawns
---
This only happens to me with legendaries that have the 33% VATS hit chance effects, and the gaus rifle. The effects seems to either not work or not display correctly.
---
I find the long load times to be opportunities for productivity. I work on my novel and due to the long load times I’m nearly finished with the 960-page first draft. 
---
Once that’s done I plan to read War and Peace in every language in which it’s been published. I’ll have plenty of time to learn the languages I don’t already know.
---
Game can barely run as is
---
Skyrim also had a tremendous map. A lot of room to place all those dungeons. If 76 want to guarantee their longevity they'll need to expand the map further.
---
Good choice, weapon should be a beast on full auto/hipfire.
---
I have yet to launch a nuke. I openly admit I'm too chicken shit to run into the silos solo (my group is people at or below 60, I'm level 114). 
---
White springs and fissure prime are nuked regularly. I've seen Morgantown get hit a couple times. I've never seen anywhere on the ash heap get hit. The only other places I've seen hit are Harper's Ferry and Grafton Steel, the latter which has tons of high levelled super mutants.
---
Eh I never use full auto just not my thing and it doesn't work with rifleman and tank killer
---
Try walking around Appalachia too. If you have a daily in the Mire for example, like Stings n Things or the cryptid hunter one, try walking to each location. You will be surprised how many random events trigger on the way that may have a legendary. The key is a lot of these events that spawn mobs only trigger if you are walking toward a destination, and not if you fast travel there. If you tried farming the responder vendor for outfits you would be familiar with this.
---
What do you mean? If your talking it just being an interior cell with enemies then of course all caves are the same but you could say that about every level in every game, but no two caves were the same in Skyrim as they all had different paths, even draugr caves and dwarves ruins were each unique in their own ways
---
My current weapon is a tse lever action but I don't like the fire rate and frankly irl I hate lever actions I prefer bolt actions but sadly that takes forever to fire in game and doesn't do that great of damage
---
Hope I did 😀
---
He was jumping around quite a bit and throwing heart emotes. No mic, but once it was clear that he could hear me I coached him on conserving the .45 ammo, crafting the rest of his armor, how "Durability" works, and getting him oriented with the world and the map 
---
Told him what I always do: Entry-level Legendaries are pretty rare, so when you finally outgrow that gear repair it and pass it on to another starting player
---
The 50s theme of every single fallout game, you mean?
---
I'm just about finishing my raider guy, got to tweak my rifleman lots and I haven't even touched my heavy weapons guy after getting him to lvl 70. So I got quite a bit to work on. But if Wastelanders is delayed until 2020 and there's absolutely nothing to look forward to until it drops, I'll probably take a break from this game until then. After that I'll probably make a new character the day survival returns.
---
well, beth is privately held so we can't really take a peek at those p&amp;l's but i suspect that you are right about finding the right amount of profitability by gouging those customers with this (inflated) fiat cash.
---
 is blades making as much cash as fo:shelter?  y'know, konami is making a mint off those metal gear pachinko machines (actually i think they are...)
---
i'll have to disagree in reference to complaining.  my grandma's soup is always too cold, and overpriced if you ask me.  but hey, i'm just customer survey information and no corporation ever wants to know that kind of stuff, sure.  please do be aware that it would be erroneous to ascribe parsimony to youthful entitlement as well.  what the youth of today need to do is stop complaining, and get off my lawn.
---
They would probably get boring just like they did in Skyrim.  They probably won't have the same amount of detail as the regular map.
---
Is that’s supposed to be a hint lol?
---
PC or console?
---
Alright, thanks!
---
Ahhh ok. I’ll try that when I get to play tomorrow.
---
Just as it’s always been I see
---
I meant that I haven’t played the game in a while lol
---
I love a good survival mode revenge story haha.
---
That'd be real convenient for me. I'm trying to collect all the raider armor sets and I'm mostly looking for Sturdy but get everything else.
---
The raid is actually way more stable now. Raiding in adventure now has the same performance of raiding in survival and my team is made of a brasilian,american and 2 european.  You guys should try raiding instead of reading wrong opinions here.
---
   Little trick: assemble your team at the menu,the game will put you in a low population server to accomodate 4 new people and the raid will be smooth. The quality check is right at the vault door terminal and its reaponsiveness.
---
Is the game easy to add to steam?
---
PowerGirl actually
---
So you didn't figure out that I'm **not talking about the in game function of the syringer** but the idiocy of having killing a bear with a tranq gun as a challenge for a hunting scouting badge?
---
I try to always make it a point to get a picture all funny staged scenes when I find them. I get totally bummed when I'm with my char that doesn't have a camera yet. Just learned today that they added it to the terminal so I'm going to go get it as soon as I get home from work. Lol
---
Also, you won't learn the base weapon plan when scrapping, just weapon mods.
---
Glad you had a great time,  I get my best moments from this game when I'm helping lower level players with crafting,  aid, or backup muscle / firepower
---
Are we friends on fo76?
---
Marketing. Way easier to create big empty map and sell it as "biggest map ever!" instead of decent sized map filled with lots of explorable areas.
---
If you count interiors, diamond City and the verticality of Boston I certainly think Fo4 has way more explorable content than 76
---
Either way, the furious will not disappoint . Full auto or single it will still do work.
---
Good point, my mistake.
---
If not here is my thingy
---
MY1SIN
---
PS4
---
We should be friends.
---
I've settled with putting up lots of orange lights at my place.
